The purpose of Phase II is to provide an implementa- tion plan to address port development opportunities and problems that were identified in Phase I. Accordingly, this report analyzes institutional arrangements and specific priority programs and projects for develop- ment of the Saginaw resource. The study was designed to produce a balanced de- velopment plan that recognizes the needs of recreational and commercial interests. The need to translate that plan into action is equally important. We believe our implementation plan is realistic and consistent with the needs to manage and develop the Saginaw, and action is indeed justified.

The plan includes a number of recommendations related to improvement of navigation channels, development of commer- cial and recreational facilities, and coordination of these three efforts. The needs identified for priority attention in Phase II were the channel project, and conmercial develop- ment. The pertinent Phase I recommendations were as fo'llows: Channel Project An acquisition program to provide a site for a new dredged material disposal area for river maintenance dredging should be initiated promptly. This should. be part of a continuing program to identify and pro- vide spoil disposal areas for future bay and river maintenance and improvement dredging. 9 Advocacy of Federal Project improvements is needed in order to assure the benefits of deeper channels. An immediate request for official study of the improvements identified in this study should be forwarded to the Corps of Engineers. A formal port organization is needed to provide pro- ject advocacy and initiative, and liaison between the Federal and local interests. The port organiza- tion/port project sponsors should be Bay, Saginaw and Midland counties. Commercial Development Any significant new investment in marine terminal facilities, if needed, should be innade along the lower reach of the river, Bay City/Grand Trunk Western Bridge to Bangor/Essexville, because of the transpor- tation economies from deeper water and better prospects for continued channel maintenance and improvement there. A feasibility study of incremental channel deepening, is recommended, along with more detailed economic feasibility studies of the new terminal facilities this study has identified as needed. Specifically, an export grain elevator, and a dry bulk materials terminal or terminals JLor feed exports and/or fertilizer receipts. e Pro motional efforts are needed to assure construction of new marine terminal facilities, and better utiliza- tion of existing facilities. The port organization needed for Port Project sponsorship would be equally valuable in port development. It should be created promptly. The Phase II analysis in subsequent chapters addresses these needs in terms of: (1) Management - the institutional arrangements consistent with multi-use management and development of the river resource. (2) Programs - the development initiatives that involve a series of goals and require a continuous ongoing effort, with specific reference to commercial devel- opment. (3) Projects - the development efforts that involve a specific identifiable goal. In this case ' the pro- vision of additional port facilities to develop port commerce. 2 I. sun.4ARY AND CONCLUSIONS Approximately half of the following reportis devoted to the chapter on Port Development Management. This is an appropriate weighting in view of the importance of managing the Saginaw resource. An organized approach to the Port Development Programs and Port Development Projects covered in subsequent chapters is essential to assure positive results. The review of port management systems and options recognizes the unique role played by Michigan state agen- cies in providing port administrative and development ser- vices. The study's conclusion is that this arrangement reduces the role of local port agencies, but does not eliminate the need for them. Instead, this should be viewed as an opportunity to obtain the benefits of local initiative at minimum cost. The review also noted that the local perception of the need for a port agency varies widely, and it is unlikely that any one of the port man- agement options would meet immediate, universal approval. Recognizing both needs and realities, this study has recommended that initially a bi-county Port Commission be created by Bay and Saginaw counties as a \"minimum manage- ment\" minimal cost administrative device to provide coord- ination in the separate exercise of planning and regulatory powers of the two directly related governments. The study also recommended that the Port Commission use the resources of the existing planning organizations for administrative services as needed, in order to provide expertise most economically, and a basis for continuing inter-county coop- eration and perspective. 3 For the long run, the study has recommended the creation of a tri-county Port Authori.ty by Bay, Saginaw and Midland Counties. As shown', the benefits of the au- thority organization are numerous, particularly for de- velopmental programs and projects. The role and budget of the port authority can be sized to meet the require- ments of the Saginaw's ports. The study also recommends a program for use before or after creation of the Port Commission that include a comprehensive determination of port economic benefits, and the establishment of formal liaison with the ports' business community. The Port Development Programs addressed in this study are the Port Project, Spoil Disposal and Port Pro- motion. They are all activities that require coordinated, continuing local efforts. As suggested by the Phase I Study, and at the initia- tive and request of the Bay County Commission, the Corps of Engineers has included the Saginaw in a current study of channel improvements for Great Lakes Harbors. This timely action saved several years of effort typi- cally required to initiate an independent offical study. To take advantage of this opportunity, timely action is needed to determine the priorities of local interests and present these to the Corps via an update of the relevant sections of the Saginaw River Port Development Study. The substance of these recommendations will be quite differ- ent, depending on whether they represent Bay County in- terests only, or all river interests. There is another Corps of Engineers study under way to determine the location of a dredged material disposal facili.ty to serve up-river dredging. The consultant team 4 submitted to the Corps the site identified in Phase I of this study as the best and most economical long run solu- tion for spoil disposal up-river. Currently unutilized, the site is also a candidate for inclusion in the expanded Crow Island State Game Area. This site may be the last opportunity to provide economical spoil disposal for the Saginaw area. Spoil disposal requirements will continue there, with or without channel deepening, unless dredging is discontinued. As in the case of channel improvements, a question of local priorities is involved. The choice of the consultant team would be to pursue use of'the property. The study reconmendation is immediate action by Saginaw County. . The initial propo.sal of the consultant team for an arrangement to reactivate the Dow Chemical/Bay City Sea- way Terminal as a public marine terminal was not attrac- tive to the owner. There was agreement that it would be desirable to preserve the public terminal use of this facility consistent with the owner's needs, to provide a way to build up the port's miscellaneous or general cargo traffic. A continued effort will be needed to locate a suitable operator and/or the requisite cargos to utilize this facility for trade development. The Port Development Projects evaluated in the final chapter were an export grain elevator, and a multi-purpose bulk terminal. The conceptual desig@is indicated that these facilities would be physically feasible, compati- ble with adjacent land uses, and consistent with better utilization of the waterfront. With an estimated employ-. ment of 50 new, full-time jobs, the facilities would pro- vide significant economic benefits and transportation 5 cost savings. The economic analysis indicated the elevator might be a marginally viable independent enterprise, and that except as an integral part of a proprietary distribu- tion system, the bulk terminal would not be. This report does not find that these projects are impossible, just difficult. The facility concepts should be used as a sales tool to find the combination of public and private enterprise that will make these facilities viable. Based on the indicated demand in Phase I and the fact that elevators and bulk plants are being bLiilt at other ports, the analyses should not be used to dismiss the potential of port development on the Saginaw. It is evidence that port development requires a multi-year sus- tained effort. 6 II. PORT DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT Background The commercial ports of Michigan handle over 90 million tons of waterborne commerce annually. In terms of tons, the state ranks first in the Great Lakes area, and sixth in the nation in the importance of its ports. 1 Although Michigan enabling legislation has provided for the establishment of C, special purpose governmental units to administer and develop 2 its ports since 1925, only a handful have been created. The state has recognized the importance of waterborne trans- portation, and is one of the few to dedicate significant support for that mode via a state DOT. Overall, howevq_@r,. states with far less waterborne commerce than Michigan, as well as those ranking above it, have much more elaborate institutional arrangements to support their ports' develop- ment. Some of the reasons for the notable absence of local port administrations in Michigan are: 9 An abundance of natural harbors that eliminated the need for extensive channel improvements at most ports, at least until commerce was well established unlike Texas ports. 1,-- - 309.1, Louisiana 1977 tonnages in millions: Texas 258.8, New York - 212.7, California - 112.9, Pennsylvania 109.0, Michigan - 91.8. From Corps of Engineers' Waterborne Commerce of the U.S. 2 Port Districts: Monroe and Detroit; Port Commissions: Benton Harbor, Ludington, Manistee, Muskegon. 7 9 The predominance of large volume shipments of bulk materials, and the related propensity for private enterprise to provide needed port facilities - unlike many tidewater ports. * -The arrangement unique to Michigan, whereby the Michigan State Waterways Commission -acts in behalf of local interests in providing assurances of cooperation required for Corps of Engineers dredging. In brief, there is a high degree of homogeneity among the major users of Michigan ports - a relatively'limited number of firms who compete with or sell to each other, but are at least acquainted - and a minimum of problems. As a result, most port problems have been addressed on a coopera- tive, ad hoc basis. There hasn't been a need for the number of formal port organizations that exist elsewhere. The management of the Saginaw has been typical of Michigan practice. Historically the initiative for channel improvements has been provided by the U.S. Corps of Engineers. The Corps-established pierhead and bulkhead lines, and the Corps-administered permit system in combination with state permits, provides some administrative control. As needed, albeit not always promptly, Bay City and Bay County have provided the local cooperation assurances required in connec- tion with Corps dredging either directly or via the Water- ways Commission. These local assurances princlDally involved spoil disposal areas, and the siting of the Saginaw Bay Diked Disposal Facility involved a classic cooperative effort by port users. A,more unusual and earlier demonstration of ad hoc coopera- tion was the voluntary assessment scheme agreed to by port users,.to pay the cost of reinforcing the New York Central bridge over the Saginaw to provide for channel improvements. 8 In the case of the Saginaw Bay Diked Facility, Bay County's Port Coordinator played a key part in organizing the coopera- tion. In the case of the bridge rebuilding, the state worked directly with-port users. An honest assessment of the management of Michigan ports in general, and the Saginaw in particular, has to recognize that the system works reasonably well in resolving problems and at a minimum cost. Its weakness is that it does not provide for local initative in addressing either problems or opportunities. Its dependence on state and federal agencies precludes its effective use as a local development resource. Phase I of the study identified the need for local initiative in addressing several problems and opportunities. This analysis is to identify the form of port administration that can do this economically and effectively, and complement the existing agencies of government. Management Options Every U.S. maritime state has provided for some type of agency to develop, own or operate its ports.. The pre- dominant form of administration is shown in Table II-1. Where the state has a secondary system, it is indicated by an asterisk. Tidewater states are listed geographically followed by Great Lakes and riverport states in alphabetical order. Michigan has just two port districts, Monroe and Detroit, with the broad powers comparable to the local authorities that are the predominant port administrative system in most states. By contrast Washington state has the most local authorities, 57, with Texas second with 18, In neighboring 9 TABLE II-1 U.S. PORT ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS BY STATE State Port Authorities City/County State DOT State Local Port Depts.

As indicated by Table II-1, most of the states that have opted for a centralized system - state authority, DOT, or in the case of Alabama, state docks department - have only one dominant port in the state. Where the state has more than one major port, the centralized system is often. perceived as favoring one port over the other - as in Vir- ginia, and to a lesser extent the Carolinas and Georgia. This could present a problem in Michigan also, if the Dort- related programs of the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Transportation were centralized in a single strong port development agency. The various institutional arrangements that could be applied to management of-the Saginaw are: State Government. Any inventory of management options has to include the existing state agencies. They are, as noted earlier, very effective in providing the basic ser- vices that would otherwise be required of a local port agency. To that extent, the need for a local port agency is diminished. The need is not eliminated, because: (1) at some point these state agencies have to interact with local interests in providing the services they do provide, and (2) most planning and development activities require local initiative. Planning guidelines are passed:down from the state level, but planning and implementation have been from the bottom up, by mutual choice. Were the State of Michigan to -centralize its port- related programs in a single, strong development-oriented agency, the need for a local agency would be virtually.nil. In the case of the Saginaw, this could be advantageous in treating the whole river as a resource. The philosophy underlying Michigan's port-related legislation is not in this direction however, and the inherent problems in ap- plying centralized control to the Michigan port system virtually preclude this as a possibility.- Municipal Government. There is considerable prece- dent for municipal port management, not only on the Saginaw but elsewhere in the U.S. The responsibilities of port management can be assigned to existing units of city govern- ment, in whole or in part, or port departments, commissions, or port administrative positions created, under the geiieral or special powers available to municipalities. Where the responsibilities have been assigned, the Department of Public Works or its equivalent, has fre- quently been the repository for these responsibilities. In Connecticut, which has the double distinction of not having county governments nor any provision for either state or local port agencies, each port has a \"Harbormaster,\" typically someone in the public works department. The assumption of certain port responsibilities by Bay City's Director of Community Development has considerable logic, but it is a practice rarely followed elsewhere. The best examples of specific departments created to handle the full range of port managmeent responsibilities are at Los Angeles and Long Beach. Significantly, both these \"harbor departments\" have financial independence; they are almost indistinguishable from \"port authorities.\" A number of communities on the Saginaw do operate waterfront facilities now - for recreation purposes. In 12 the distant past almost every port city provided a public wharf or wharves. The trend for many years, however, has been away from city participation in port management; there is too much competition from other municipal ser- vices for the available funds and management talent. As two competing harbor departments on the same waterway, Los Angeles and Long Beach have been highly successful. Although two port agencies might be better than none, the Saginaw does not offer the opportunities to support dupli- cation of effort, and the need for coordination is rela- tively greater. County Government. There is limited precedent for county governments that participate directly in port man- agement by way of dedicated personnel or departments. Partly this is because most ports are also within some municipal jurisdiction. The Bay County Port Coordinator position was unusual. There is a growing trend for coun- ties to be involved in port management indirectly, via countywide or city/county port authorities or commissions. Largely this trend is the result of the departure of cities from active port management. As with cities, the powers of county governments under Act 66 permit the assignment of port management responsibil- ities to existing entities or individuals, or the creation of departments, commissions or positions for that purpose. The merits of independent or duplicative county action are the same as with cities. Inter-county cooperation in manage- ment of the Saginaw could be facilitated by via certain exist- ing units of government. Specifically, in the Saginaw Ports' area the East Central Michigan Planning and Development Region is a 13 multi-county agency with multiple port-related functions. -Originally created as an Economic Development District, it was reconstituted in 1973 as a Planning and Development agency under Act 281 of 1945. At present, the Region acts as the coordinating and project clearing'house agency for a 14-county area. It is a creature of those county govern- ments, funded by them and created by joint resolution, with its charter defined by its By-Laws. Subject to amendment of the Region's By-LaVs, which requires approval by 75 percent of the sponsoring govern- ments, this. agency could provide coordinated management of the Saginaw. As such, it would be a limited version of port commission where the powers exercised are those de- 3@ived from the parent\" g'overnment(s) - but with even more limited ability to implement development plans. As a clearing house agency, the Region would have to rely on local agencies to \"deliver\" projects or programs. It would offer expertise in port planning and development as an ex- tension of its present activities. An alternative to coordinating port planning and development activities via the Region would be a more systematic interchange of information between the county agencies responsible for these activities. These include the Metropolitan Planning Organizations for the respective counties or their supporting staffs, and the respective recreational and economic development agencies. In the case of recreation, there is informal coordina tion now via sporadic meetings of the recreation directors of Bay and Saginaw counties and other political subdivisions. In the case of economic development, there is a built-in 14 bias against mutual action. Accordingly, the most -promis- ing area for improvement of cooperation is in port-related planning, specifically by way of liaison between the multi- modal transportation planning entities. CI Si nce the Metropolitan Planning Organizations span an array of planning functions and act as clearing agen- cies, the most relevant level for port-related liaison is at the staff level. Two counterpart organizations that have been identified as most appropriate for this are, the Bay City Area Transportation Study and the Saginaw Metro- politan Area Transportation Study. They have been created by their respective county commissions with their charters defined in By-Laws. Since the study groups are not bud- oeted as 'such but depend on contributed staff of other* C, units of county government, they are not candidates for implementing programs. On the other hand, they could assist coordination of port management most economically. Multi-Government. The powers available to cities and counties under Act 66 of 1952 may be exercised by those polit- ical subdivisions individually or jointly. Accordingly these statutes offer one of the few options for a Port Commission or equivalent entity to provide mutual management of the Saginaw. The relevant sections of Act 66, paragraphs 281.541 et. seq., Co@npiled Laws of Michigan, or 5.2768(11)(12)(13) Michigan Statutes Annotated, are as follows: 281.541 Definition (Section 1) The term \"political subdivision\" used herein is defined to mean any county, city, village, township or district of this state and any other governmental C> agency or subdivision, public corporation, authoritv 15 or district in this state, which is or may be autho-_ rized by law to adquire, establish, construct, maintain, improve and operate harbors, channels and other naviga- tional facilities. Whenever used in this act the term political subdivision shall include any combinations of political subdivisions acting jointly. 281.542 Waterways; harbor guards, ordinances, harbor masters (Section 2) .A political subdivision is hereby authorized (a) to adopt and amend all needful rules, regulations and ordinances for the management, government and use of any waterways, harbors, channels or other navigational facilities under its control, either within or without its territorial limits; to employ harbor guards, police or a harbor master with fullpolice powers; to fix penalties for the violation of said rules, regulations and ordinances and enforce such penalties, (b) to adopt and enact rules, regulations and ordinances designed to safeguard the public upon or beyond the limits or harbors, channels, connecting waterways or other navi- gational facilities within such political subdivision or its political jurisdiction, which rules shall be consistent with and conform to, as nearly as may be possible, the laws*of this state, (c) to vest authority for the maintenance, operation and regulation thereof in an officer, board or body of such political subdivi- sion by ordinances or resolutions. which shall prescribe the duties and powers of such officers, boards or body, and (d) to employ a regular harbor master for the harbors, channels, connecting waterways or navigational facilities under its control, or in cases where a harbor board or body is established the harbor master may be employed by such board or body. 281.543 Same; jurisdiction, contents (Section 3) All powers., right and authority granted to any political subdivision in this act may be exercised and enjoyed by 2 or more of them, or by this state through its appropriate agencies and 1 or more such political subdivisions acting jointly, either within or without the territorial limits of either of them, and contracts may be entered with each other for the herein provided and authorized joint action. The port commission, harbor commission or equivalent entity created under Act 66 is not a corporate body. It derives its powers as an extension of the governmental unit(s) 16 that create it. The power to tax, issue bonds and/or own property resides with the parent government(s), and those powers in turn are subject to the limitations imposed by laws other than Act 66; specifically the Waterfront Improve- 3 4 5 ments Act , Municipal Finance Act ,Revenue Bond Act. The creation of a port organization under Act 66 involves an authorizing resolution and ordinance creating the organ- ization and defining its powers, passed by the governing body of the parent unit or units of government. A vote of the public is not required. Financially the port commission is a part of its parent(s). Capital needs or operating expenses in excess of any revenues are provided by the parent govern- ment(s). The port commission is an appropriate form of organiza- tion for providing an advisory body, particularly if no professional staff are to be employed and the budget is nominal. The St. Joseph River Harbor Commission (Benton Harbor - St. Joseph) is a good example of two-city cooperation through a port advisory body. The limitations of the com- mission form of organization are most apparent when there is a need to retain professional port management, provide fa- cilities and/or achieve self-supporting status. The Muskegon Harbor Commission (city-county) is a good example of what can be achieved and the difficulty in doing so via a port commission organization. 3Act 66 of 1941; par. 123.601 et seg. Compiled Laws of-1948 (MSA 5.2768(l)(2)(3)(4). 4Act 202 of 1943; par. 131.1 et. seg. Compiled Laws of 1948 5Act 94 of 1933; par. 141.101 et. seg. Compiled Laws of 1948. 17 Special Government. Michigan law provides for two forms of semi-autonomous port organizations with the broad powers that are comparable to local port authorities, the prevailing administrative system in other maritime states. Act 234 of 1925 provides for Port Districts. Act 639 of 1978 provides'for Port Authorities. Under either law, the port .organization is a body corporate that can encompass one or more counties. Additionally, port authorities can be spon- sored by combinations of cities and counties. As a practi- cal matter, the port authority form is the only available option. The older port district enabling legislation provided for a truly independent body with the power to own and oper- at,e properties, issue debt, and levy taxes for debt service and operations. These powers are broad and comparable to those of Texas' Navigation Districts and Washington State's Port Districts. Act 234 is codified in paragraphs 120.1 - 120.56, Compiled Laws of Michigan, including the amendment thereto providing for cooperation with and matching grants from Michigan Department of Commerce under Act 251 of 1966. The law is lengthy and comprehensive, but events have made it academic. Prior amendments to Act 234 allowed the county govern- ment to exercise budgetary control over the port district and to provide administrative services. As a result, the Wayne County-Detroit Port District became indistinguishable from the rest of county government. The only other port district, Monroe, has had a close and continuing relationship with city of Monroe, and results have been happier.6 6 Max M. McGray, Executive Director. Section 9 or Act 234 requires at least two of the five Port Co-m-mission Members to be from the county seat of the county in which the port district is located. 18 The Port Authority Act (639 of 1978) has a \"sunset provision\" covering port districts. Section 30 provides \"Act 234 ... is repealed Cbut not until) the constituent bodies of each port authority created pursuant to Act No. 234 of the Public Act of 1925 and in existence on the effective date of this act participate in the creation of an authority pursuant to this act...\". The Wayne County Port District is in the process of converting to a port authority. As of September, 1980, the Monroe Port District had V-0 nia-ns to do so. 7 Act 639, the Hertel-Law-T. Stopczynski Port Authority Act is codified in Michigan Statutes Annotated paragraphs 5.2190(l) - (30). The principal parallels and differences between the port district and port authority acts include: Creation of the port district requires an approving vote by the voters of the county or counties in which it is situated. Creation of a port authority requires a resolution requesting incorporation by the governing body of the \"constituent units\" (couTities and/or cities) and authorization by the governor after consideration of the recommendations of the Departments of Commerce and Transportation. (Sec. 4 of Act 639). Appointees to the five-person governing board of the port district (called port commission under both Act 66 and Act 234) are allocated to sponsoring governments by formula. The five to seven member- ship of the port authority board includes one guber- natorial appointee but i-s otherwise determined by local option. (Sec. 5). The powers of districts and authorities are equally broad in permitting acquisition, ownership, operation and disposal of port facilities. As defined in Sec. 2(e) \"Port Facilities\" means those facilities owned by tho port authority such as: seawall jetties; piers; wharves; docks; boat landings; marinas; ware- houses; storehouses; elevators; grain bins; cold storage plants; terminal icing plants; bunkers; oil tanks; ferries; canals; locks; bridges; tunnels; se@aways; conveyors; modern appliances for the eco@ nomical, handling, storage, and transportation of . freightand handling of passenger traffic; transfer and terminal facilities required for the efficient operation and development of ports and harbors; other harbor improvements; or improvements, enlarge- ments, remodeling, or extensions of any of these buildings or structures. 7Max M. McCray, op. cit. 19 Port authorities are empowered to regulate and plan the use of waterways including pierhead lines, safety and environmental protection similar to Act 66 Port Commission powers including \"Do all acts and things necessary or convenient to promote and increase commerce and recreation within its territorial jur- isdiction\". (Sec. 10(d)). 9 Unlike port districts, port authorities can issue revenue bonds but not general obligation bonds. The constituent governments can pledge their full faith and credit for issuance of port-related bonds, but without any increase in taxing powers or bond limits. (Sec. 12, 13). 9 Properties held by port districts were required to pay \"payments in lieu of taxes\" on income-producing properties. Port authority properties used for 11private purposes\" are taxable as private property, butwhen used for public purposes are exempt (Sec. 22). 9 Both port districts and port authorities.are required to prepare comprehensive port development plans. In the case of port districts, the plans are required prior to building port improvements. In the case of port authorities, the comprehensive plan is required \"within two years\" of the authority's crea- tion. (Sec. 23). Budgets of port districts were subject to the ap- Droval of the board of supervisors of the countV (or a budget committee for multi-county districts). Authority budgets are subject to the approval of the governing bodies of the constituent (sponsoring) local governments and Michigan Departments of Commerce and Transportation (Sec. 24). Port districts were eligible for matching state grants for facility planning and acquisition, sub- ject to appropriation of funds. Port authorities are eligible for 50% state funding of operating bud- gets. Matching funds for an approved port authority budget are required to be budgeted by the state's Department of Transportation. That budget in turn is subject to legislative approval. 20 The port authority is the organization form of choice when there is a need to retain professional port management personnel, provide facilities and/or implement programs, and a self-supporting entity is desired. It is not appropriate if programs and budget are to be nominal. The matching state funds available to an authority also obligate it to be more than an advisory body. Without development as well as management functions it is unlikely that incorporation of the authority would be recommended by the Departments of Transportation and Commerce. Unofficial Institutions. Michigan law recognizes, through the enabling legislation for port districts, and port authorities,,that port management is complex.' It cuts across a number of planning and development func- tions and institutions, and often requires a unique solu- tion. The sections on municipal and county port adminis- tration are additional evidence of that. In brief, the enabling legislation for spec-ial purpose port agencies was not arrived at lightly, and should not be dismissed lightly. In addition to the official entity charged with port administration responsibilities, whatever its form, most ports have a counterpart organization in the business com- munity, composed of interested port occupants or users. In respons e to the Saginaw dredging crisis in the 1970's, there was.a temporary example of this port phenomenon. In many other ports, a similar citizens group has preceded the formation of an official port'entity. In most ports with an official port entity,. that entity finds it advan- tageous to work with an organized group of port users. 21 Citizen groups unite in response to a perceived need. Some factors that appear to minimize that perception on the Saginaw are: (1) the businesses interested in commercial and recreational uses of the Saginaw do not view it as a mutual resource, (2) the business interests do not.have an umbrella organization that bridges the counties involved to view the Saginaw resource in its entirety. This study is intended to help in that respect. It would be desirable to have some type of unofficial institution to assist in the management of the Saginaw. Very likely it would be a necessary p3@ecedent to a more formal administration system. Evaluation of Options As shown in the, preceding section, there are several options to provide more orderly and effective management of the Saginaw. To evaluate these options, it is necessary to define the Saginaw's needs, perceived as well as real, and based thereon, the role of port management. Also, although Phase II addresses only priority commercial development programs and projects, it is appropriate to define management needs in terms of balanced recreational and commercial development, in line with the plan produced in Phase I of this study. Independent of other studies, Phase I of this study identified numerous opportunities for both recreational and coLmercial development. In many cases, these oppor- tunities or related problems were identified in earlier studies. Phase I went beyond the previous efforts princi.- pally in its attempt to quantify the needs, benefits and costs of specific developments, and in relating these to the entire river resource. 22 Recreation. The public perception of development opportunities in this field very nearly approximates the findings of the study. In fact, very few of the proposed facilities were original, and the study effort was directed toward determining the appropriate sizing and location of the facilities. With the exception of the two large regional facilities proposed for Middle Ground and the Saginaw Bay Diked Disposal Facility, the recreation@faci- lities are within the capacity of local interests to finance, either with private funds or a combination of local and other public funds. Overall, there is general agreement between the study and the public perception that local initiative is adequate for recreational development. The study's concern with aistributing that development over the entire river, to avoid overbuilding the river mouth and to make recreational activities upriver more attractive, was not matched with expressed interest in more formal coordination of local efforts, either during contacts in the course of the study, or in the recreation plans of the separate entities. Commerce. Phase I identified several development opportunities that included industrial coal, other bulk cargos including fertilizers, and increased grain exports. The significant benefits avai \"lable to the agricultural sector from deeper channels was recognized in the earlier 1978 Saginaw River Port Study9 that suggested channel deepening for a Bay City area grain elevator. Remarkably, 31976 Bay County_Recreation Plan 1980 Saginaw County Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan 1976 -@e`gional Perspectives -- Recreation Facilities 9Bay City Area Transportation Study, Saginaw River Port Study, May 1978, pages 18, 19. 23 despite the potential benefits, the upriver elevator operators have shown no apparent initiative in pursuing channel deepening. Despite the fact that this agriculture- related shipping is now concentrated in Saginaw County, the county has not participated in channel maintenance programs. This anomaly may be attributable to-the perception that further commercial development of the Saginaw will benefit Bay County. The Overall Economic Development Program for Saginaw County noted \"Generally local people consider the whole Saginaw-Bay City Port underutilized. However, major new improvements are.perhaps more favorable for Bay City as the river channel and highway bridges are less of a problem there.\"10 The present waterfront elevator operators understandably view another elevator as competition. Since transportation savings flow to shippers and receivers and particularly in the case of grain, to producers and the income from cargo handling is widely dispersed, a parochial view of Saginaw River port develop-- ment is inappropriate. The Region's 1977 Overall Economic Development Program recognized the river as a regional transportation resource: Water transportation appeared to have the best chance for expansion of all the transpor- tation modes. The Region has an international seaport and a foreign trade zone. The committee Saginaw County Metropolitan Planning Commission, Overall Economic Development Program for Saginaw County, June 1976, revised March 1977. 24 .felt that expansion of these facilities and in- creased use of all port facilities would reduce the cost of goods received throughout the Region and would increase the Region's competitive position in the sale of goods. In addition, increased use of water transportation would provide potential employment opportunities for people living in at least five counties.11 A better appreciation of the widespread benefits and regional significance of the Saginaw ports could be pro- vided by a study comparable to the 1976 Economic Benefits of the Port of Detroit. 12 That study quantified*the benefits applicable to the cargos moving through the Port of Detroit.on a commodity by commodity basis, and also allocated those benefits to the counties in the port's hinterland. Although there are numerous other port impact studies, the Detroit @study was unique in identifying benefits by geographic area. The Detroit study was part of the overall effort by the Interagency Task Force for Detroit/Wayne County Riverfront Development directed toward' producing a more effective port organization. That effort, the benefit analysis, and the Task Force's conclusions and recommendations are summarized in its report, Partners for Progress -- the Land and the River.13 llEast Central Michigan'Planning and Development Region-, Overall Economic Development Program, December 1977, page 184. 12 Dr. Asil Gezen, Economic Benefits of the Port of Detroit, A report prepared for the Interagency Task Force To-rDetroit/Wayne County Riverfront Development, May 1976. 13 Partners for Progress -- the Land and the River, the Report of the Interagency Task Force for Detroit/Wayne County Riverfront Development, published by the Office of Economic Expansion, Michigan Department of Conmierce, June 1976. A definitive port economic impact analysis is beyond the scope of this study. The Economic Benefits of the Port of Detroit involved some one and one-half man-years of ef f ort. In lieu of a scientif ic analysis that identif ies the specific cargo origins and destinations and flow of expenditures, Table 11-2 provides a rough estimate of the dispersion of benefits for a hypothetical Bay City grain elevator on a Seaway-depth channel.

It is offered to illustrate a point; that the public's perception of the benefits of port development may not be correct. A comprehensive analysis would include all commodities as well as their hinterland origins or destinations and the specific port facilities used. Industry. Compared to previous studies performed by or for the local governments, the Phase I report was more optimistic in regard to development of commerce'on the Saginaw, less optimistic about specific industrial develop- ment opportunities. Port improvements that have been suggested earlierl4--a heavy lift crane for machinery shipments, the replacement of the D&:M bridge at Bay City *to allow construction of the largest size lake'carriers could not be justified on the basis of foreseeable business. The use of a foreign trade zone would not significantly improve opportunities to use imported materials or local labor supply. A realistic appraisal of industrial development opportunities recognizes that new installations requiring large waterfront sites are few and far between. The new shipyard recently located in Ontonagon is evidence that they do occur. The port development plan of Phase I was designed to provide a balance' of recreational, commercial and industrial waterfront uses, based on the premise that increased commercial and recreational activities would produce supporting industrial activities. Partly for that 14 Bay County Economic Adjustment Plan, a report pre- pared by the Michigan Department of Commerce and Marten Hoffman and Company, Inc., 1975, pages 46-55. 27 reason, the report did not recommend concentrating all commercial facilities at Bay City. To an even greater degree than commercial development, industrial development will depend on perception of the whole river as a mutual resource. In brief, there is considerable variation in the perception of Saginaw River development opportunities. This is paralleled in the perceived need to manage that development. e The Bay City Area Transportation Study's 1978 Saginaw River Port Study recommended a full-time port director and suggested this be via a two- county port organization.15 9 None of the Saginaw and Midland County studies and plans reviewed in the course of this study evidenced interest in a port management organiza- tion. The East Central Michigan Planning and Development Region's 1977 Overall Economic Development Program recommended the establishment of a tri-county or multi-county portauthority.16 In view of all of the foregoing, it can be assumed that none of the port management options, including doing nothing, will have universal appeal. Since the Phase I study and other studies of the river -- found a real need to manage the resource,-the evaluation of options has three goals: (1) To identify the minimum management system consistent with real and perceived needs. (2) To identify the best system for management and development of the Saginaw. .150p cit, pages 18-19. 160p cit, page 184. 28 (3) To identify a strategy for going from (1) to (2). Minimum Management. Literally \"doing nothing\" is a local option in Michigan because of the unique services provided by the Michigan State Waterways Commission acting as local cooperation guarantor for the federal channel project, and the Michigan DOT in coordinating the develop- ment of the state's waterways. It is because of their effectiveness, not lack of it, that doing nothing would be unacceptable. These agencies represent a significant investment of state funds, and are a resource to be used for Saginaw port development. They can be effective only when there is at least someone local \"to answer the phone\". Similar to the interaction between state agencies and local interests, there is a need to use all of the local development resources available within the Saginaw ports area. As a practical matter, if there is anything less than multi-county port management system, it is likely to involve only a Bay City, or more likely to involve only a Bay County port agency. In that case, the lack of partici- pation by Saginaw County in port affairs would be a self- fulfilling prophesy. A Bay County Port Commission would be hard pressed to explain or justify any efforts to improve or maintain the navigation channel to Saginaw -- including spoil disposal areas, particularly when the principal 3-Mpact at Bay City would be more bridge openings. Perceived or not, Saginaw and 11idland Counties have an interest in management of the river. A minimum management system requires the participation of Bay and Saginaw Counties, and the exercise of the powers available under Act 66 of 1952 to harmonize the regulations and planning of the two 29 counties relevant to the river. As an administrative device utilizing existing units of government, the merits of a bi-county Port Commission are compelling. Creation requires the initiative of the Bay and Saginaw County Commissioners. This report recommends that the initial port organization be a Bi-County Port Commission with the following features: (1) Create the.Commission by joint resolution of Bay and Saginaw Counties. Implementing ordinances can be adopted by the counties severally. (2) Provide staff support as needed by utilizing the expertise provided by existing planning organizations, alternately one or both counties or the East Central Michigan Planning and Development Region. (3) It is suggested that two members of the Commission be elected officials of the two counties, two members be representatives of river users appointed by their respective counties, and the fifth member be alternately, nominated by the appointed members or determined by any other mutually acceptable formula. Maximum Development. The Port Commission as described in the preceding section would be quite adequate to coordi- nate the planning and assist the development activities of the existing agencies within the Saginaw ports area. The need for an agency to provide development initiative is a matter of perception. Phase I of this study indicated there was such a need. This is based on the business prin- ciple that when there is identified work to be done, the way to get results is to assign the responsibility to a specific individual or agency. 30 To be effective as a development agency, the port management organization needs a separate corporate identity, the ability to own property, employ specialized personnel, and be self-supporting. In brief, this is the port authority provided for in Act 639 of 1978. Subject to the public's perception that the Saginaw is a multi-county resource with broad benefits, the option of choice would be a tri- county port authority, representing Bay, Saginaw and Mid- land Counties. In the interim, an educational effort is' required to clarify the public perception of the role of a port authority. Universally,the creation of an additional unit of government is viewed with suspicion by existing political entities. The initiative for creation of a port authority is too much to expect of County Commissioners. Within Michigan, the role of a port agency of any type has been clouded by the acrimonious debate in Detroit over public versus private participation in waterfront development. That city literally 11 missed the boat\" in utilizing its resource because a small segment of the community has viewed the public agency as competition instead of providing complementary services. Locally, and probably universally, another new public entity is viewed as \"more taxes\". There may be some element of truth in the last concern-. Compared to some other ports\". the Saginaw has been remarkably free of local obligations that involve significant cash expenditures of public funds. Considerable ingenuity will be required to provide spoil areas for upriver dredging without payment for fee title or easements. Since the bur- den of these payments would fall on Saginaw County, it would be to that county's interest to have a multi.-county port authority immediately, in order to have a vehicle for sharing the cost of local cooperation. For that reason, 31 the immediate creation of a port authority to address problems of spoil disposal would guarantee an unfair public perception of the role of the authority. The classic definition of the role of a port authority was stated by a former manager of the Port of Toledo: The reasons for establishing a public port authority include the desire for orderly develop- ment of the harbor with planned facilities and nondiscriminatory access for shipping, as well as the necessity of providing the data in rate cases, in national legislation, and in obtaining adequate harbor and channel appropriations. Another primary reason for the establishment of port authorities is that they function in an area'not attractive to private capital. -For instance,private industry cannot obtain long- term financing at the interest rates available to public bodies,. can-not acquire land by eminent domain.... Still another reason for establishing a port authority is the direct benefits bestowed on industry in that facilities constructed by public funds are usually leased to private firms on terms profitable to the operator. Few public port bodies operate the facilities they own. In addition, the public port agency in its promo- tional efforts and in its solicitation of cargo serves as a sales force for the private operators in the port.17 This study recognizes that the opportunities of Toledo are not those of the Saginaw. Fortunately, neither are the problems of Detroit. The role of a port authority on the Saginaw need not be as broad as that described by the Toledo port director. It can be a significant and useful one nonetheless. The role described by Mr.. Jewell is a valuable guide. 17 Government Control of Ports, by E.O. Jewell, Western Reserve University Law Review, December 1959, page 85. 32 This report recommends the,ultimate incorporation of a Tri-County Port Authority with the following features: (1) Contract the performance of planning and regu- latory powers and duties contained in Section 10 of Act 639 to the existing planning organ- ization(s), in order to preserve the continuity of inter-county cooperation established under the Port Commission, with the Port Authority Board retaining the oversight exercised by the Commission. (2) Exercise the primary (developmental) powers and duties contained in Section 8 of Act 639 by employing a minimum.professional staff. Unless otherwise justified by specific port programs or projects, this staff would be one executive and one or two supporting staff. (3) Vest the ultimate ownership of the Saginaw Bay Diked Facility and any other lands acquired for similar public purposes in the authority, for port related development, commercial, recreational, industrial, regional or otherwise as consistent with applicable plans. (4) Operate the authority as a public enterprise, so that consistent with its development obli- gations and the philosophy that private enter- prise should provide facilities and services when willing and able, the authority's long- range goal shall be self-support. Strategy. This report has recommended the creation of a Port Commission on the initiative of the Bay and . Saginaw County Commissioners. The following three stages would be an appropriate route to consideration of con- version of the Commission to a Port Authority. Absent a bi-county initiative to create the Port Commission, step one and possibly step two could be helpful precedents. (1) A comprehensive economic impact study of all Saginaw waterfront activities that identifies the distribution of benefits. 33 (2) Creation of a Port Committee or equivalent citizens group with a representative membership of port occupants or users as described in the preceding \"Unofficial Institutions\" section. (3) An examination of the operations of represen- tative port authorities by representatives of the Commission and Committee. This report suggests the following candidates for visits and/or exchange of information: 9 Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority (out- standing rapport with business community) Seaway Port Authority of Duluth (industrial development emphasis) San Diego Unified Port District (multi- jurisdiction, recreational development emphasis) Lorain Port Authority (small but effective) The Lorain Port Authority's activities approximate those required for the Saginaw. That authority's policies, 1980 work program and budget are attached to this study as Appendix A. Financial Analysis Substantially the same amount of effort is required in the establishment of a Port Commission or a Port Authority. The commitment of financial support after creation or incorporation will largely be determined by the projects and programs undertaken by either organization, but there are significant differences. The creation of a Port Commission carries no obligation to spend any money on personnel, pro- jects or programs. It is possible to exercise the powers of the Commission through use of contributed staff with a budget that is nominal. 34 The incorporation of an Authority does imply an obligation to have a professional staff and action programs. As noted in an earlier section, it is unlikely that incorporation would be recommended without this. In addition, the Port Authority Act (639), requires a \"Plan of Development\" to be prepared within two years of creation, and this study does not constitute the comprehensive study required under the Act. As a partial offset to these obligations, the state may provide 50 percent of authority operating expenses. Under the Minimum Management/Maximum Development op tions for the Saginaw, the minimum annual financial commitment could be zero for a Port Commission, in the $15',000 - $25,000 range for a Port Authority. The cost of the latter is predicated on a minimum level of development effort using a part-time professional. A more realistic level of effort and expense for planning coordination and promotion by the authority, would be in the area of $50,000 per year. The financial estimates are based on the actual experience of the Lorain Port Authority. Until two years ago, their staff was a part-time but very competent pro- fessional with secretarial assistance. Similar to the Saginaw setting, that authority was not endowed with any revenue-producing assets. The authority has built up an income by acting as the financing vehicle for port-related facilities. Initially, income consisted of interest earnings on escrowed funds. Their current formula is one-half percent of the face amount of the issue plus one- half percent annually of the amount outstanding. The facilities that have been financed include a shipyard expansion (Amship), tank farm (Ashland), and most recently, a bulk handling plant (Republic, Steel). The Lorain authority now has a full-time professional with-secretarial assistance. The authority's 1980 budget 35 is shown in Appendix A. Assuming an identical level of effort and income for a Saginaw River Port Authority would produce the following results. TABLE 11-3 ESTIMATED INCOME/EXPENSE SAGINAW RIVER PORT AUTHORITY Personnel $ 45,200 Supplies & Services 10,500 Development & Sales 11,540 Miscellaneous 2,100 Total Expenses $ 69,340 income 24,600 Deficit $ 44,740 State Contribution 22,370 Local Subsidy $ 22,370 Findings As a leading maritime state, Michigan is unique in the port administrative and developmental services provided by state agencies.- This arrangement, which is not likely to change, reduces the role of local port agencies -- but does not eliminate the need for them. The services provided by the state should not be viewed as competing with a local authority's, but complementary -- an opportunity to obtain the benefits of local initiative at minimum cost. 36 Michigan law recognizes the need for local partici- pation in port administration, and provides several optional forms of organization to manage and/or develop port resources. Within the unique setting of Michigan's port-related infrastructure, this offers an opportunity and a challenge -- to adopt an organizational form that is best suited to local circumstances. The local per- ception of need varies widely, and it is unlikely that any one of the port management options would meet immedi ate universal approval. Recognizing both needs and realities, this study has recommended the immediate creation of a bi-county Port Commission, and longer-range, the incorporation of a tri- county Port Authority. In the interim period, or if necessary as precedent actions, the study recommends. determination of the economic benefits of the Saginaw ports, and establishment of formal liaison with the ports' business community. Ultimately, the value of any local port organization will depend on it being perceived and used as complementing and not competing with existing political institutions and business enterprises. 37 III. Port Development Programs Overview Phase I of the study identified a number of port development problems and needs. Some of these are regularly recurring, and are typical examples of the needs routinely addressed by established port organizations. The Phase I report suggested that they be given priority attention, presumably by a new port organization. The study @dvisory Committee directed the Consultant team to address these in the Phase II study. For a brief period, the consultant team functioned as the port authoritv. Port Project The Phase I report analyzed the need for dredging of the Saginaw. The purpose was twofold: to identify any need for deepening of the navigation channels, and to test the logic of terminating dredging of the channel upstream of Bay City. Both the deepening and the abandonment of\" dredging have been suggested prior to the report. The report found that the major beneficiaries of deepening would be agricultural interests. Unfortunately for them, the export grain elevators are at Saginaw. A .preliminary cost-benefit analysis indicated deepening at Bay City would be justified, but not to Saginaw. There are several alternatives, including a grain elevator at Bay-City. One necessity is a definitive cost-benefits analysis and justification for the dredging. As noted in Phase I, the procedures for implementing channel improvements and their official study are lengthy. 38 1r An ongoing study by the Corps of Engineers of the Great Lakes connecting channels and harbors provides a convenient vehicle for an official study of Saginaw improvements. The Saginaw was not included in the original study scope, and the Phase I report suggested a timely request to this effect. In September, a request for inclusion of the Saginaw in the Corps' study was made by the Study Coordinator, in behalf of the Bay County Commission. Were there a port organization, the request would be a typical respon- sibility. In support of that request and for use in sub- sequent Corps studies and public hearings, a local port agency typically would produce in-house, a study comparable with this report's analysis of the needs and benefits of -channel dredging, but with a stronger advocacy of improvbments. Dredged Material Disposal Federal improvement and maintenance of a waterway customarily involves certain \"local obligations\" such as providing rights-of-way and relocation of utilities as may be needed for dredging, assurance that wharves and similar structures will be built and the waterway used, and disposal areas for dredged material. As noted in the Phase I report, local obligations are subject to negotiation, and may be more extensive. In Michiga n, the Michigan State Waterways, Commission acts as the contracting agency with the Corps of Engineers, to provide assurances of local cooperation. When necessary, the Waterways Commission may require a subsidiary contract with local interes ts, to support the guarantee to the Corps. This unique arrangement for local cooperation agreements arose from the circumstances under which the Waterways 39 Commission was created. Act 320 of 1947 charged the Commission with the development of the ports and waterways of the state, with the immediate purpose of securing the construction of fifteen harbors of refuge. The latter required the power to provide the local cooperation assurances, Thereafter, the development of commercial harbors was assigned to the Michigan Department of Commerce in the 1960's, and to the Michigan Department of State Highways and Transport- tation in 1973 by Act 327 of 1972, but the power to contract for cooperation assurances remained with the Waterways Commission, In the case of the Saginaw Bay Diked Disposal Facilities, the site was state-owned land, but an agreement with Bay .County was required in order to provide for ultimate owner- ship after use as a dredged material disposal area. The dike itself was constructed with 100% federal funding under P.L.91-611. That law provides that the ownership of a diked disposal area will not remain with the federal government when it is no longer used for the purpose for which it was built. In the case of the Middle Ground dredged material facility, Bay City provided a city-owned site and diked it, because it was advantageous to use the dredged material in the adjacent city sanitary landfill. Since that landfill operation must be discontinued in the near future, this study and all parties concerned with river dredging have identified the need to provide a new mid-river disposal site. The Phase I report emphasized the need to acquire a large enough site to serve for an extended period. This is reinforced by the Corps' determination that the new mid- river facility's dikes can be funded under P.L.91-611. 40 Diking is a significant expense. Should local'interests be required to pay the cost of future dikes, it would be dis- advantageous to constrain the size of the P.L.91-611 funded facility, and advantageous to build it where it could be expanded economically. The Phase I report recommended an area on the west side of the Saginaw, southwest of James Clements Airport and identified on some maps as the \"Clements Seaplane Base.\" The,report recommended a site of 330 to 700 acres, depending on acceptable dike heights, to accommodate dredged materials to the year 2020. For comparison: the Middle Ground facility is 12 acres; the 17-mile Brownsville, Texas channel has 20,000 dedicated acres; the 25-mile river- ine section of the Houston Channel has about 2,500 acres but the dikes are taller than adjacent houses. Concurrent with the completion of the Phase I Port Development Study, the Corps of Engineers announced a \"Public Workshop Session\" for August 28, 1980, to consider four spoil disposal facility sites that had been identified during the Corps' one-year search for candidate sites. The Corps' sites were: (1) 45 acres, Northwest portion of Clements. Airport; (2) 40 acres, Southeast portion of Clements, Airport; (3) 50 acres, North of and adjacent to the Farm Bureau Elevator at Zilwaukee; (4) 40 acres, East Bank of the Saginaw across the road from the Saginaw Veterans Memorial Park, north of the Bay County- Saginaw County Line. The first two sites are owned by Bay City, and the City preferred site #1. The other two sites are privately owned. The first three sites were considered in the Phase I report, 41 and deemed unacceptable for stated reasons. The fourth site was not considered in that report. It was the generally preferred site by the attendees at the public workshop. Figure III-1 following, shows the preferred site at the public workshops cross-hatched and the sites recommended by the consultants (Maxwell preferred). The west side sites were submitted to the Corps for consideration, by letter dated September 4, 1980,from the Study Consultants. Copies of the Corps' notice of the public workshops, and the consultants' Iletters are attached to this report as Appendices B and C, respectively. As noted in the letter, Michigan Department of Natural Resources has denied a request by property owner Maxwell for a permit-to fill that property, and DNR is now negotiating the purchase of that property and assembling acreage to create a state game area now called \"Crow Island West.\" Preliminary inquiry by the consultants at DNR indicate the state is not receptive to using all or part of the Maxwell property for spoil disposal. However, the DNR Wild- life Division did indicate that use of part of the present (east shore of the Saginaw) Crow Island State Game Area could be considered with the provision that local interests would be required to mitigate the interim loss of the game area, and restore it after use. \"Mitigation\" customarily involves dedication of more-or-less equal acreage for the same use, but recent efforts of the port industry have produced some innovative solutions where the trade-offs are more flexible. At the present time, the 40 acre site preferred at the public workshop appears to have several limitations. Since it is privately-owned, fee title or a long-term easement 42 Figure III-1 Proposed Mid-River Spoil Disposal Sites o 7 D.e Oz 0 COle r4l*4@ 0 'SC-4v 4L o\", 0-01 S A G 1-1, FA_W_ C 0 7 10 .......... + 4. @oadside Par 7 2 it de 1> A I L W A U /,E -] .. .. . 1-J!\". 1_Z %8ji 29 ISLAND STATF AREA HOW Soiirce: TERA, Inc. 43 must be purchased, and an undefined amount of mitigation committed. To avoid prejudicing the state's negotiations for the Maxwell property, the consultant refrained from contacting the property owners. A clear indication of local support for use of the Maxwell or adjoining properties would be appropriate before pursuing the matter further with DNR. Port Promotion The Phase I report on \"Commercial Development\" identified two factors that will have a significant effect in determining whether the Saginaw achieves its full potential. They were (1) improvement of the navigation channel, and (2) promotion of the port. The efforts already initiated in regard to a review of the federal project and provisions for disposal of dredged material will be helpful. The Phase I report proposed reactivation of the Dow Chemical owned Bay City Seaway Terminal as a public facility under the auspices of a port agency@as an activity that could initiate a port promotion program that combined incentives with the possibility of self-support. The relevant sections of the Phase I report were shared. with executives of Dow Chemical U.S.A. The substance of the consultants' discussions with those executives Is: Dow Chemical is interested in reviving the operation of their Bangor facility as a public use terminal consistent with Dow's shipments through the facility, as a use that may incidentally benefit Dow, but principally to demonstrate corporate responsibility in port development. 4 4 Dow would prefer an arrangement with a private terminal operator, such as the previous terminal operation by Oglebay Norton Company. e The Dow executives are convinced that the potential general cargo traffic of the port will not provide enough business for a viable public terminal operation. 0 Dow is not about to make a commitment at this time to a public port agency not yet in existence, and whose form of organization and operation have not been defined. In summary, the proposal in the Phase I report was not rejected outright. Neither did it produce an immediate need for a public port agency. As noted in the Phase I report, Mr. Bernard Surath -acquired the former Oglebay Norton general cargo terminal in Carrollton. He has now reactivated it, and anticipates scrap shipments and receipts of pig iron by vessel. His is a classic example of the entreprenuerial spirit needed to develop the Saginaw's ports. Because of his proprietary interest in the Carrollton terminal, he is a remote candidate to operate the Dow facility. The alternative to public terminal operation of the Dow facility to revive the Saginaw's general cargo traffic is to produce the need for a public facility first, by identifying and attracting a sufficient volume of neo-bulk or other cargos compatible with.the facility, i.e., Scrap handling would not be appropriate. The Dow executive for further contact in regard to the terminal is Mr. Donald E. Janish, Site Manager, Bay City Plants, Michigan Division. (517) 684-1330. 45 Findings Appropriately, the federal project study of channel improvements, the provision of spoil disposal areas and the initiation of a port promotion effort have been addressed as ongoing programs. As noted, there has been some initiative in these areas associated with this study, but real progress will require continued effort. Provisions should be made for updating the relevant sections of the Saginaw River Port Development Study to assist in making the Corps of Engineers study of channel improvements productive. There is an opportunity now to provide a long-term solution to a new mid-river dredged material disposal site. General agreement at the local level as to the desirability of the proposed site is a prerequisite to what will have to be a concerted local effort to dedicate the site for spoil disposal -- an effort comparable to that involved in the Saginaw Bay Diked Disposal Facility. A continued effort should be made to locate a suitable operator and/or the requisite cargos needed to reactivate the.Dow Chemical facility in Bangor as a public terminal. 46 IV. PORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS Overview Phase I of the study identified most commercial port development opportunities to be associated with the agri- cultural sector--grain and animal feed exports, and fertilizer receipts by vessel (both domestic origins and imports). An export grain elevator on Seaway depth channels was estimated to offer higher returns to the local grain producers. The cost of a minimum suitable elevator was estimated to be $7.5 million. Further analysis of a multi- purpose dry-bulk terminal capable of handling both feed exports (in pellets) and fertilizers was also recommended, with no estimate as to cost. The Study Advisory Committee determined these two facilities were the top priority projects, and directed the consultants to investigate their feasibility in Phase II. This chapter presents the conceptual designs, underlying assumptions and estimated costs for the two facilities, not including site acquisition costs. Facility Sites The Phase I report identified the need to use the commercial waterfront of the Saginaw more intensively, by consolidation of uses where feasible as with the oil terminals, and the desirability of consolidating new significant in- vestment in marine terminals in the Bay City area, where the maintenance of channel depths is more economical and more likely. Figure IV-1 shows the recommended uses of C) the waterfront in the Bay City area for commercial purposes, based on the integrated development plan of Phase I. 47 FIGURE IV-1 10 3 \"A INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2 @\\F- BAY CITY AREA WATERFRONT USES nG4#w 0 0 FLARE n R 419*c' 0 Hoht Say Harbor Mwina DowchemIcal U.5 A. )61 Romp , , I tk -wil4er Ro d don Q of -a ',I Z F G 3?% R MAST FR 0 0) Anvw Of Company I E.@rillf I E) :6 1 17 1 3VerlLl* Occ R 2 F R Be- IR n R 21soc F a / OSIA 0 G 12 LA CP-0-1 CA C'\" m, c a, BASCULE BRIDGE etinin 00 T ritted Weldv DO L .1 1 1\"104'1 CILL 1- 11 total petroleurn Inc. f .

For those locations with reasonably acceptable rail and road service, the next priority was to find existing underutilized terminals that would offer suitable sites. The final major criterion or factor was to provide for future expansion of the facilities. This analysis identified the two sites shown on Figure IV-2. The owners of the two properties were contacted to determine if there were any objections to the consultants' use of the sites--at least on paper--for preparation of conceptual plans. Both parties readily agreed. Mr. Frederick Fletcher of Fletcher Oil Co., owner of the grain elevator site, welcomed a project that could make more intensive use of that site. Mr. Barron Berger, Senior V.P. and General Manager of Newcor-Bay City, indicated his company's property was not needed for corporate purposes, and an alternate use for the property would be welcome. The consultants were aware that a portion of the Fletcher property has been designated an archaelogical site because it had been used by Indians, and there might be resistance to its development. An effort was made to identify the specific boundaries of the designated site (apparently none) and the legal restrictions on its use (likely a delay in issuance of construction permits regardless of the presence of artifacts). The prime portion of the Fletcher property centers on the \"India n Mound\", and although this area has been thoroughly mined for artifacts, the consultants considered it ineligible as the elevator site. Accordingly, the presently developed portion of the Fletcher property was used as the proposed 49 FIGURE IV-2 LOCATION MAP- Jill GRAIN ELEVATOR AN dIINAL SITES D BULK TEr n @ 4#*c 10 Hoist 4@ Heil, '* Yacht VOIC Bay He(\" Marina 101 Bey Yacht C a n..

That portion of the property has been filled, indicating that it probably never was used by the Indians. Michigan State University, the organization that had nominated the \"Mound\" site for the archaelogical register, indicated two days of core borings could conclusively determine whether this portion of the property had archaelogical value. The principal reasons for selecting this site despite the potential controversy are: e The Fletcher site provides a unique combination of rail and highway access in the Bay City area. As an elevator site there would be demonstrable benefits from deeper channels. The anticipated upstream limit for deepening the Saginaw is the Grand Trunk railroad bridge immediately upstream of the Fletcher property. The favorable cost- benefit ratio attributable to the elevator would apply to all dredging downstream. The general location of the multi-purpose dry-bulk ter- minal was chosen because the south bank of the Saginaw between the Truman (highway) bridge and D&M (railroad) bridge is a prime marine terminal area and not being used for that pur- pose. The specific location next to the Bay City Wastewater plant was chosen because it presented the possibility of building a wharf structure offshore from the plant, and thus making multiple use of the water area and providing an activ- ity suitable for viewing from the proposed riverfront mini- park. The design was constrained by the size of the Newcor property, and field surveys will be needed to determine if the indicated rail access impinges on existing structures. Alternately, the Bay Chemical property could provide rail access or a facility site. 51 Traffic Patterns As indicated, land transportation access was a key determinant of prospective facility sites. Similarly, the impact of trains and truck traffic on the adjacent community was a key consideration. The operators of the present waterfront elevators at Saginaw have both considered Bay City as a location, but considered the lack of good truck access from Interstate 75 to be a severe disability. If the site is on the south shore (such as the proposed bulk terminal) and the access is via the.I-75 business route through downtown Bay City, their perception is correct. Analysis of the access via Wilder Road convinced the consultants that a north shore location for the elevator would be feasible. In addition, the Fletcher site is served by Conrail with a direct link to the elevators in Saginaw. This will provide better service for shuttling grain between the elevators, and minimize grade crossing interference with highway traffic. The prospective tonnage to be handled by the bulk terminal is smaller than the grain elevator, and peaking of traffic flows will be far less. In addition,,due to the new highway bridge over the Saginaw, truck traffic can be routed via Wilder Road for access to 1-75. Environmental Considerations The conceptual design of the two facilities includes' those features that are current best practice in environmental protection. 52 The grain elevator employs an inclined belt for elevating grain to the top of the silos in lieu of the -traditional vertical bucket elevators, in order:to min- imize the creation of dust and dust explosion hazards. This makes the facility relatively more expensive than older designs, but is state-of-the-art design. Both the grain elevator and bulk terminal are designed to trap surface runoff water, from rain or other sources, and divert this water to sedimentation basins or treatment facilities when necessary, before discharge into'the river. The sp.ecific impacts addressed in the conceptual design are: Visual. The grain elevator silos are not obstructive, and the architectural symmetry should be pleasing, absent the traditional \"headhouse\" for elevating legs, which is usually twice the height of the silos. Noise. Receiving and delivery capacities at both T-acilities have been designed so that rail switching service will not be needed more than 16 hours per day. Grain elevator truck traffic normally peaks at the beginning of the business day, and is lowest during the midnight-6 All period. 9 Dust. Both facilities are designed to meet EPA air and water quality standards, with the most cost- effective equipment. Conceptual Designs The design objective for the two conceptual Dlans was to provide, consistent with good safety and environmental protection features: An export grain elevator of minimum feasible size at the lowest possible cost, conservatively estimated. 53 A multi-purpose dry-bulk terminal with relatively high tons-per-hour receiving and delivery capacity and generous storage space and bagging facilities, with a substantial multi-purpose wharf. In effect, the facility is over-designed to provide a basis for terminal expansion in the future. The general site plans for the grain elevator and bulk terminal are shown in Figures IV-3 and IV-4, respec- tively. The design criteria for these two facilities were as follows: Grain Elevator. Based on the estimated elevator needs shown on pages 139 and 140 of the Phase I'study, a \"deepwater\" elevator would have potential annual exports independent of those via the port elevators in the Saginaw area as follows: (In thousands of bushels) 1980 - 14,763 2000 - 19,843 1990 - 17,302 2020 - 24,923 Based on an annual throughput of ten times storage, and the length of time it will take to provide Seaway channel depths at Bay City, the market will support a minimum-size export elevator of 1.5 million bushels capacity by the time that deepwater elevator is reality. Long-run, provision should be made for increasing storage capacity to 2 million and 2.5 million bushels. It is assumed that about half the grain received will be by rail from other elevators including the port elevator at Saginaw, with the other half by truck -- either from other elevators or direct from farms. It is assumed that virtually all shipments will be to vessels, with an occasional trainload loaded out. The vessels are likely to be maximum size \"salties\" loading about 700,000 bushels. Based on 15,000,000 bushels per year, indicated annual traffic in about 7,500 trucks, 2,187 rail cars, and 20 vessels. 54 mm M.m = = m = m = m FTGITRE IV-3 GENERAL SITE PLAN - GRAIN ELEVATOR LLLUJ PC*T 4w 0--e DeVILM@At\"T 0 A' tA &- *1000, WWI$ \"Wo rLIVAT04 TIMISIAL w Cm.

Loading and un- loading of trucks can be accomplished at either end of the elevator. Vessel loading facilities will use an elevated gallery the length of the berth with gravity spouts to reach all hatches without vessel shifting, maximum combined loading rate, 45,000 bushels per hour. The supporting structure will be the lowest-cost alternative, bulkhead, caissons, or piling. The flow of grain through the elevator is shown in Figure IV-5.

CAR The Brownsville operation is based on single-shift operation, no more than two simultaneous operations. A -15 million bushel per year volume at Bay City would likely require two-shift operation several months per year. In addition to elevator personnel, directly related employment includes grain inspectors (3 as needed) and vessel trimming crews (5 per spout as needed). The combination of permanent, part-time and full-time employ- ment for the Bay City elevator is estimated to be the equivalent of 40 full-time jobs. Bulk Terminal. Estimates of dry bulk fertilizer receipts and feed exports were shown on page 128 of the Phase I study. Estimates of available facility capacity -to handle these two commodities were shown on-pages 137 and 138, respectively. A summary of these estimates and the indicated facility needs is as follows: (Tons per year) 1990 2000 2020 Feed Exports 50,000 90,000 90,000 Present Facilities 30,000 30,000 30,000 Expected Facilities 30POOO 30,000 30,000 Needed Facilities - 0 - 30,000 30,000 Fertilizer Received 75,716 213,262 267,818 Present Facilities - - - Expected Facilities 75,000 150,000 150,000 Needed Facilities - 0 63,262 117,818 Two possibilities were considered in sizing the bulk terminal: (1) as a prototype for the proprietary facilities expected to be built, or (2) as the multiple-user additional facility for which there is an indicated need starting in 2000. Under either scenario, the prospective volume for the facility would be about 100,000 tons per year initially, with ultimate expansion to 150,000 to 180,000 tons per year. 59 Accordingly, it was decided that the.most useful design would be for a multi-purpose facility that could handle and store both feeds and fertilizers since the storage space requirements are similar under different scenarios. Four of these scenarios are shown below: (Quantities in tons) Annual Storage Scenario #/Commodity Volume Turnover Required #1 Feeds 30,000 3X 10,000 Fertilizers 75,000 5X 15,000 Total 1990 Expected (Proprietary) Facilities 25,000 #2 Feeds 30,000 3X 10,000 Fertilizers 63,262 5X 12,652_ Total 2000 Needed (Additional) Facilities 22,652 #3 Feeds 60,000 3X 20,000 #4 Fertilizers 150,000 5X 30,000 The optimal facility is one long and narrow clear-span building parallel to the vessel berth, connected to a solid fill or free-standing wharf with a wide apron where a moveable loading tower can reach all holds of the vessel and/or a moveable or mobile crane can reach all holds. Movement between storage and wharf is by one reversable or two conveyors, or alternately by vehicles. A dockside hopper would receive cargo discharged by self-unloading vessels. A single reversable conveyor in the peak of the building, with interior elevating legs fed by mobile equipment -- plus cargo doors -- provides'for movement into and out of storage. There have been numerous variations of the small bulk plant concept in other ports -- purpose-built facilities in Savannah for fertilizers and clay, in Brownsville for ferti- lizers and feeds, in Galveston for sugar, and conversions of general cargo transit sheds in New Orleans for feeds. The 60 Bay City facility shown in Figure IV-4 reflects certain site constraints. The flow chart for the facility is shown in Figure IV-6. It is assumed that all feed exports will be received by truck and loaded to general purpose \"salties\", that virtually all fertilizers will be received from a combination of vessels barges, self-unloading lakers, and some 11salties\" with about 80% of fertilizers delivered out' via truck, with the balance rail. Based on 30,000 tons of feeds, 70,000 tons of fertilizers, indicated annual traffic would be 5,700 trucks, 250 rail cars, 20 vessels. Based on the Brownsville bulk plantestimated staff would be: 1 Manager 1 Foreman 2 Clerical 2 Maintenance 5 to 30 operating personnel as needed Financial Analysis A definitive determination of the feasibility of the two proposed port facilities can only be made based on the specific requirements of a specific prospect related to a specific site -- and would likely require the sharing of proprietary data. This study is a pre-feasibility analysis to define the financial parameters, so that contact with potential prospects will be realistic and productive. It is based on generally available information. Grain Elevators. In the past decade, virtually all U.S. port elevators have been built with public financing, for operation by major grain firms. In part, the public financing reflects the capital intensiveness of elevators', and the marginal return on investment in the facility per se. In part,it is due to the fact that when most elevators are 61 FIGURE IV-6 FLOW CHART7 BULK TERMINAL FERTILIZER VE HICLES MOBILE BLDG.

The predominantly private operation is due to the fact that a major company automatically has a volume of business for a new facility. Also, the blending of grains within the elevator is its most profitable aspect, and the advantages are lost in a true public facility. Because of the public financing of elevators, their construction costs are public knowledge. Recent construction has cost about $5 per bushel of storage capacity. The Burns Harbor elevator under construction by Cargill is expected to cost $18 million for 3.4 million bushels of capacity. On the satae unit cost basis the Bay City elevator would cost $7.9 million, versus the Phase.I estimate of $7.5 million (page 104). Because of the private operation of most export elevators, virtually all operating cost information is proprietary. The sole publicly-owned, publicly-operated export elevator is at Brownsville, and information for this elevator is shown. Table IV-1 shows an itemized cost estimate for the Bay City elevator prepared for this study. The indicated cost is $14.82 million, or almost $10 per bushel of capacity. The Brownsville elevator has a present capacity of 3 million bushels storage, built in increments with an overall cost of about $2.25 per bushel, and handled an average of 14.5 million bushels per year in the past five-years. Although somewhat larger than the proposed Bay City facility, its operating results are believed relevant.

A rough estimate of the Bay City elevator revenues based on 15 million bushels per year related to Brownsville revenues is $1.275 million. Since revenues may be even more sensitive to site specific conditions than expenses', the assumption has been made that Brownsville's average net revenue per bushel handled (i.e., cash flow after direct and indirect expense, but before depreciation) will provide a 'more realistic indication of the Bay City's facility to service debt. On the basis of a cash flow of 3.5(,% per bushel handled, and an annual volume of 15 million 'bushels, the Bay City'elevator could produce $525,000 per year as return on investment. Currently, 9% interest, 20-year money, is probably the best available elevator financing via tax-free revenue bonds. That requires equal annual interest and amortization payments of 11.746% of the issue. When interest rates were lower and 30-year money was available 8% would amortize. Based on the $14,821,900 estimated cost of the conceptual elevator design, 9% 20-year money would produce annual charges of $1,740,980. Alternately, a $7.5 million invest- ment with 9% 30-year money would produce charges of about $587,498. Bulk Terminals. The fact that there are numerous public and privately-owned bulk terminals means there are more cost figures available. Unfortunately, very few of those terminals are similar to the proposed Bay City facility. 66 The Brownsville terminal is comparable. It has a 100,000 square foot warehouse with a 250 ton-per-hour conveyor system connecting with the wharf. That facility therefore has more storage, and about half the handling speed of the design prepared for this study. The Brownsville facility cost about $1 million fifteen years ago. Escalating for inflation, that indicates a current reproduction cost of abo"
