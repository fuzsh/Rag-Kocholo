Workshops include hands-on practice related to disassembly, cutting,and lifting/spreading. It addresses the capabilities listed in NFPA 1670 for a Operations Level Machine Rescue Team.\n\nKey Points: EMS considerations, Types of Machines, Terminology, Incident Management Considerations, Energy Control for Rescue, Stabilization, Lifting &Spreading, Cutting Operations, Disassembly Options, Rescuer Safety and more.\n\nRope Rescue Awareness / Operations\n\nThis 40-hour program exceeds the capabilities required in NFPA 1670 for an Operations level team.\n\nThis is a hands-on, practical course specifically designed to address the needs of fire and rescue agencies which may be called upon to perform rope based rescues from above or below grade including the rescue of workers suspended on fall arrest as well as in support of operations at confined space, trench and structural collapse rescue incidents.\n\nWhile the emphasis is on working as a team to complete the rescues, there are numerous individual skills are critical to that success. Throughout the program there is a strong emphasis on basic skills and safety. There fundamentals are important, not just for class, but as a foundation for all future rope rescue training. Each of the techniques presented has been tested and proven; and some will be proven again as a part of the program, especially in the belay workshop. After successfully completing the course, participants are able to work safely at rope rescue incidents, operate the commonly used systems (lower, raise and belay) and be familiar with the techniques used for the typical rope rescue incidents.\n\nNFPA & OSHA Standards\n\nStandards Operating Guidelines\n\nSafety\n\nPPE\n\nHardware\n\nSoftware\n\nKnots\n\nAnchoring\n\nRapelling\n\nSelf-Rescue\n\nBelays\n\nLowering Systems\n\nMechanical Advantages\n\nLadder Systems\n\nLow Angle Litter use\n\nRoof-based pick-offs\n\nGround-based pick-offs\n\nFall Protection Patient Packaging\n\nRescue Scenarios\n\nFor more information, or to schedule a rope rescue program for your department, please contact: Dave VanHolstyn at vanholstyn@ersintl.org.\n\nRope Rescue Technician\n\nThis 50-hour program is a combination of classroom and hands-on, practical activities specifically designed to address the needs of fire and rescue agencies which may be called upon to perform rope-based rescues that exceed the capabilities of an Operations Level trained organization. It is also intended to address the specific rope rescue related needs of an Urban Search & Rescue Task Force or Regional Technical Rescue Teams. The program addresses all the capabilities listed in NFPA 1670 for a Technician Level Rope Rescue Team.\n\nWhile the program includes a brief review of some operations level skills and techniques participants must, as a prerequisite for this class, be familiar with basic knotcraft, anchoring, lowering systems, belaying and pulley systems.\n\nThe classroom portion of the program focuses on the basic physics of rope rescue as they apply to anchoring systems, friction, resultants as well an introduction to artificial high directionals and horizontal systems.\n\nThe hands-on portion includes advanced anchoring, pulley systems ranging from simple through complex, hot change-overs and the use of the CMC MPD.Â Considerable time is spent performing a variety of high angle litter work, both with and without an artificial high directional (Arizona VortexÂ©). Â Rigging to support operations at confined space incidents is addressed, and participants will construct and operate a tracking line offset and a horizontal system to support swift water rescue.\n\nThis class also addresses pick-off rescues, using techniques that allow a two or three person team to perform the rescue.\n\nBecause rescues involving tree workers are increasing, a module on the rope equipment and techniques used by arborist is also presented.\n\nFor more information, or to schedule a rope rescue program for your department, please contact: Dave VanHolstyn at vanholstyn@ersintl.org.\n\nStructural Collapse Rescue Awareness/ Operations\n\nThis 40 hour program meets the objectives of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 1670 and 1006).Â The search workshop in this program was developed from Michigan-specific structural collapse incidents (tornado in Springfield Township, explosion in Flint, explosion in Wayne, tornado in Dundee, and tornado in Dexter).Â The building and wide area search methods and techniques taught in the MUSAR course have become the standard for collapse rescue teams throughout the state.Â These Michigan-specific procedures are not found in other state or FEMA collapse rescue training programs.\n\nThe MUSAR Collapse Rescue training programs are being used in all of the state regions that have been mandated, by the Michigan Department of Homeland Security, to develop urban search and rescue capabilities.Â The use of a single training curriculum has provided a standardized response throughout the three largest urban areas in our state.Â Those regions are Region One (Lansing area), Region Two (Detroit area) and Region Six (Grand Rapids area).\n\nThe MUSAR Training Foundation continues to work closely with MI-OSHA to provide training on updated procedures for safety concerns that are found at rescue scenes throughout the state of Michigan.Â Since Michigan is not a Federal OSHA state many of these âMichigan Specificâ methods are not found in any other collapse rescue training curriculum.\n\nCourse Content:\n\nAwareness Level\n\nRecognizing the need for structural collapse search and rescue\n\nIdentifying the resources necessary to conduct structural collapse search and rescue operations\n\nInitiating the emergency response system for structural collapse incidents (Michigan specific USAR Response System)\n\nInitiating site control and scene management\n\nRecognizing the general hazards associated with structural collapse incidents, including the recognition of applicable construction types and categories and the expected behaviors of components and materials in a structural collapse\n\nIdentifying the five types of collapse patterns and potential victim locations\n\nRecognizing the potential for secondary collapse\n\nConducting visual and verbal searches at structural collapse incidents, while using approved methods for the specific type of collapse\n\nRecognizing and implementing the FEMA Task Force Search and Rescue Marking System, Building Marking System (structure/hazard evaluation), Victim Location Marking System, and Structure Marking System (structure identification within a geographic area)\n\nRemoving readily accessible victims from structural collapse incidents\n\nOperations Level (Structural Collapse Rescue Level 1)\n\nSize-up of light frame, ordinary, unreinforced and reinforced masonry construction collapsed structures\n\nDetermination of potential victim locations\n\nDevelopment and implementation of collapse rescue incident action plans\n\nSearch of light frame collapsed structure (Michigan specific curriculum)\n\nStabilization of collapsed Operations level structures\n\nImplementation of collapse support operations\n\nRelease of and removal of victims from entrapment by components of collapsed structures\n\nLifting and moving heavy loads\n\nBreaching structural components\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for Structural Collapse Technician.\n\nFor more information, or to schedule a collapse rescue program for your department, please contact:Â Dave PotterÂ at DavidPotter376@gmail.com.\n\nStructural Collapse Technician\n\nThis 60 hour program meets the objectives of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 1670 and 1006).
