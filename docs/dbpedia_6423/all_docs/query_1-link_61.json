Those of you who recall the conditions prior to formation will recognize the change that has come in the intervening years. Prior to 1920 we had a variety of unrelated agencies, each entirely on its own, with a succession of inefficiently conducted campaigns, with much wasted efforts, with no standards enforced on any agency. Practically all of the agencies were living on a starvation basis. They were inadequately financed. The people charged with their operation were required to give much of their time to more or less unsuccessful effort to raise funds for operation. In many cases, also, the cost of raising funds was very much out of proportion to the amount that actually went into the work of the agencies.” The First Quarter Century: Saginaw Community Chest, Report of the President, Arthur O. Cook, January 17, 1945"
