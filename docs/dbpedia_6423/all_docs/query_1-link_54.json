        "text": "Opened September 1957\n\nCost: $1.22 million\n\nCapacity: 324\n\nLarzelere Hall was the second residence hall built in what would eventually become a quadrangle on the northwest side of campus. The location of this quad was the site of the Vetville complex that temporarily housed veterans after the Second World War, although by the time construction started on Larzelere, the barracks that had once stood there had been sold and removed. Its architectural plans were closely based on Robinson Hall, next to which it was situated. The interior plans copied those developed for Tate Hall the previous year, which featured a suite-style layout that would heavily influence residence hall design until the construction of the Towers complex in the late 1960s. Larzelere Hall shares a dining commons with Robinson, Calkins, and Trout Halls.\n\nThe $1.22 million building was designed by Roger Allen of Grand Rapids, who designed many of the other residence halls built during the period of campus expansion in the 1950s and 1960s. The building was opened for occupancy in September 1957 and officially dedicated on May 18, 1958. It was built as a men's residence, which it remained until 1959. Women lived there from 1959 to 1970, after which it became coed. It was designated the Honors residence hall in 1972.\n\nThe building was named for the longtime head of the Department of History and Social Sciences. Claude S. Larzelere headed that department from 1900 to 1939. He was born in 1866 in Iowa. He received his Bachelor of Literature from the University of Michigan and did graduate study at the University of Chicago and Oxford University. He received his MA from Harvard in 1900. Before coming to Central, he was the superintendent of schools at Lowell, Michigan and Jefferson, Ohio. In 1912, he received an honorary Master of Pedagogy from the State Normal School at Ypsilanti (Eastern Michigan University). Larzelere specialized in Michigan history and government, topics on which he wrote several books and articles. He traveled extensively, visiting Europe, Egypt, and Palestine. He and his wife Lorena had two sons and a niece who lived with them. He died on January 20, 1946.\n\nOpened: 1955\n\nCost: <$1 Million\n\nThe building that is now Ronan Hall was originally built as a library that would replace the inadequate library facilities located in Warriner Hall. Architectural plans were initially drawn by Roger Allen and Associates of Grand Rapids in 1951 after Allen and several College officials toured modern library facilities on campuses around the Midwest, including North Dakota State College, Colorado State College, and Kansas State Teachers College. Funding for the nearly $1 million project was approved by the state legislature in 1953. Plans called for construction of the new library north of Keeler Union (now Powers Hall) on the corners of Hopkins, S. Main, and S. Washington Streets.\n\nConstruction was underway by fall 1954. The cornerstone, which was laid in October 1954, contained materials that reflected the campus environment at the time. It held copies of the college bulletin, directory, social calendar, and yearbook, as well as a list of the library’s book selections and magazine subscriptions. The building was nearly complete by the end of the spring session in 1955, although relocation of the library would not be completed until January 1956. Local students were hired over Christmas vacation 1955 to complete the relocation. The new library was dedicated on April 27, 1956 at a ceremony attended by College officials and the architect. Ralph Ellsworth, director of the library at the University of Iowa, delivered a speech entitled, “The Significance of a Modern Library for a Modern College.”\n\nThe new library building was a major improvement over the existing facilities in Warriner Hall. The three-story, 65,000 square feet structure held over 200,000 volumes. The modern open-stack system provided students with direct access to over 90,000 volumes. In addition, there was study space for a quarter of the campus population at the time, as well as classrooms and reading rooms. In addition to the main library, the new library building also housed special collections within the Clarke Historical Library, which was dedicated on December 8, 1956. The building was renamed the Charles V. Park Library in March 1965. Park was the head of the library at Central throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and the dedication of the new library in his name came shortly after his death.\n\nAlthough what was by then called the Park Library was designed to be expanded with the future growth of the university, by 1967 construction of an entirely new library was underway. The new Charles V. Park Library, located on Preston and Franklin south of the University Center, opened in 1969. The old library building, now vacated, was remodeled into classroom and office space. It also served the University in a variety of ways over the following decades. The building housed the Center for Cultural and Natural History from its inception on March 30, 1971, until it moved to Rowe Hall in 1975. At one point, the University's closed-circuit television studio was also housed in the building.\n\nThe naming of this building has a somewhat confusing history. For a decade after it was originally built, the building was known as simply “the library” or “the library building.” In 1965, it was dedicated as the Charles V. Park Library. However, when a new library was built in 1969, the new building was named the Charles V. Park Library. The original library would receive a new name within a year, however. Ronan Hall, a residence hall built in 1924, was demolished in 1970. The remodeled and repurposed building that was the old library was renamed Bertha M. Ronan Hall in 1970. Today, Ronan Hall is home to many student support services, including Academic Advising and Assistance, Career Services, English Language Institute, Enrollment and Student Services, International Affairs, Residence Life, Student Affairs, and Study Abroad.\n\nThe hall was named for Bertha M. Ronan (pictured above), who was a professor in the Department of Physical Education from 1903-1923 and Dean of Women from 1923 until her retirement in 1942.\n\nOpened: 1973\n\nCost: $5.5. Million\n\nRenovated: 1990, 2010\n\nThe facilities that would eventually become the Rose Center and Ryan Center were first proposed as a $5.5 million physical Education building in October 1969. Designed by Daverman Architect and Engineering firm of Grand Rapids, the building's construction contract was awarded to the Christman Company of Lansing in 1971. The building was planned for an area on the south side of Broomfield, part of the continued expansion of campus to the south. Indeed, Broomfield Road was widened to four lanes and a median was added to facilitate the increased number of pedestrians that would be using the new athletic complex.\n\nExcavation was underway on the project by summer of 1971, but problems delayed the opening of the new building. In January 1972, high winds caused the collapse of several steel columns on the partially-constructed building. Later that year, three workers were injured when a steel beam fell over thirty feet to the ground.\n\nThe building itself, which opened in the summer of 1973, was an impressive addition to campus. The complex was twice the size of Finch Fieldhouse, which served as the primary location of the school's athletic pursuits prior to this point. It had separate areas for wrestling, handball, dance, gymnastics, and physical conditioning. There was a specially equipped facility for students with disabilities. There was also a 6,000 seat basketball arena that could be converted to classroom space, a six-lane competitive pool and separate diving pool, and a turf room that featured a Tartan turf surface similar to that installed at Spartan Stadium. Outside, the complex also included eight tennis courts and four softball/soccer fields. In January 1973, it was announced that the athletic complex building would be named the Daniel P. Rose Center, after the long-time athletic director and winningest basketball coach in CMU history (pictured at left). The academic wing would be named Grace E. Ryan Hall, after the health and physical education instructor who served for 35 years from 1923-58 (pictured below). The Rose Center remained the hub of both intramural and recreational athletic activity throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nHowever, with the continued growth of the student body and increasing demands from students for an expansion, Trustees approved financing for an expansion to the existing Rose Center in 1987. Dubbed Physical Education and Recreation Phase II, the plans called for a $14.9 million, 179,000 square foot addition to the Rose Center. The addition was designed by TMP Associates of Bloomfield Hills and built by the Christman Corporation of Lansing. The new expansion would feature six racquetball courts, a three-lane jogging track, a twelve-lane bowling alley, six multipurpose gymnasiums, a pool, weight room facilities, and two auxiliary gymnasiums. In 1990, University officials announced a name change for the facility. The entire athletic complex would now be known as the Student Activity Center, while the basketball arena would be known as Rose Arena. All of the facilities would be under the supervision of Campus Recreational Services with the exception of the arena, which would remain under the Department of Athletics.\n\nDoors to the Student Activity Center officially opened on September 3, 1990. Students and faculty were required to show their campus identification card, which contained information about whether that student had paid the annual fee, to enter the facility. The complex was officially dedicated with a ribbon cutting ceremony on October 4, 1990. CMU President Edward B. Jakubauskas, Chair of the Board of Trustees Margaret Riesker, and SAC Director Tom Jones were among those who spoke in front of a crowd of about one hundred gathered on a converted section of one of the basketball courts.\n\nBy the early 2000s, University officials were again discussing renovating, or even completely replacing, the existing events center. A new building was prohibitively expensive, so in 2007, the Board of Trustees approved $21.5 million for renovation of Rose Arena and the surrounding complex. Designs, by the Smith Group, the nation's seventh largest health care architecture firm, were approved in July 2009. The general contractor for the project was the Clark Construction Company of Lansing. Construction began in the fall of 2009. Construction required the relocation of 32 trees and the removal of 80 trees from the site; 80 new trees were planted in other parts of campus to make up for the loss of those on the construction site.\n\nThe new events center looked to create a more welcoming appearance and expand both the available space and usefulness of the facilities. 50,000 square feet of additional space was added to the old complex in the form of an atrium grand entrance, a practice gymnasium, and an expanded wrestling complex. The arena itself was renovated through improvements to the existing seating and the addition of a 12 x 30 ft. scoreboard and video system at the west end of the arena. A new lobby and ticket office and significant expansion to the fitness center were also part of the renovation. The project was completed in different phases over the course of 2010-2012.\n\nAs the new arena neared its opening in the fall of 2010, the University announced that it would be named after the McGuirk family of Mt. Pleasant, which had donated the requisite $2.5 million for naming rights to the arena. The McGuirks owned McGuirk Sand and Gravel as well as United Apartments, both influential local businesses. The basketball court within the arena was renamed Kulhavi Court, in honor of former Trustee John Kulhavi, who donated $1 million. Kulhavi was a 1965 CMU graduate and senior vice president at Merrill Lynch in Farmington Hills at the time of the dedication. CMU offered naming rights to the entire events center for $5 million, but failed to find a donor willing to accept the offer.\n\nProblems plagued the construction process. The opening of the fitness center was delayed slightly when asbestos and high levels of lead were found in the space being converted from the old wrestling center. Additional funds had to be allocated when the integration of the old and new construction met difficulties and design errors forced crews to investigate and adjust their plans. Funding also caused some controversy, as the University's website provided incorrect information about the public nature of construction funds. Although officials had been transparent in the process of allocating these funds, skepticism over a project facing many other problems grew among some students.\n\nEven with these problems, construction proceeded steadily. The new events center opened in time for the fall 2010 basketball season's start. The expanded fitness center was ready for use by the spring of 2011. The project was fully complete by 2012. The new events center received the 2012 Building Honor for Architectural Excellence from the Detroit chapter of the American Institute of Architecture. It was the second University structure to be recognized by the AIA, after the Education and Human Services building won the award eight years earlier.\n\nOpened: 1958\n\nCost: $1 Million\n\nPartially Razed After Fire: 1998\n\nCollege officials announced plans for a new college elementary, psychology, and education building in 1956. Groundbreaking on the $1 million building, designed by architect Roger Allen, took place in May 1957. In December 1957, President Anspach announced the new building would be named in honor of Eugene C. Rowe, and in May 1958 the cornerstone was laid. The cornerstone contained signatures of all the elementary students attending the school in 1958, as well as a photograph. The building was designed with flexibility in mind, featuring movable dividers between classrooms and movable cupboards and storage within classrooms.\n\nThe building was opened in the fall of 1958 and saw some significant renovations over the next few decades, including a renovation of the office wing in 1969 and the addition of an elevator in the 1980s. The former gymnasium now houses the Center for Cultural and Natural History, which relocated to Rowe Hall from Ronan Hall (the old Library) in 1975. The Museum reopened to the public in April 1978. A Native American art gallery, started by a donation from Olga and G. Roland Denison, was dedicated in 1994.\n\nIn June 1998, a fire broke out and significantly damaged the east wing of Rowe Hall. This wing had until this point housed the College of Extended Learning, and the fire left many faculty members without office space. In addition to the loss of CEL space and materials, other offices were left covered in soot and the Museum of Cultural and Natural History also sustained smoke damage. The Museum remained closed until September, and temporary facilities for the departments displaced by the fire were set up in the Student Activity Center, Warriner Hall, Powers Hall, Park Library, and Woldt Hall. Cost of the clean-up and post-fire renovations reached $400,000. The 16,500 square foot east wing was determined to be too heavily damaged and was razed. A new entrance was built on the east side of the building, new brick facing was added to the section of the building adjacent to the demolition, and sidewalk and landscaping improvements helped integrate the renovated building into the exiting surroundings.\n\nThe building was named after the founder of the Department of Psychology and Education at Central. Eugene C. Rowe was born in Monroe, Michigan, on March 8, 1870. He received his AB from Olivet in 1897 and his PhD from Clark University in 1909. He came to Central in 1902 and retired in 1936. He was the first faculty member at Central to have a PhD.\n\nRowe was a prominent psychologist. He offered the first Mental and Sex Hygiene courses in the state. He was a clinical psychologist for the New York City Police from 1915 to 1916. During World War I, he was the US Army's Chief Psychological Examiner, attaining the rank of Major. He helped design the Army Alpha test, which is a fore-runner of the modern IQ tests. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a life member of the American Psychological Association. In addition to his work as a psychologist, Rowe was also a pioneer in the controversial eugenics movement. He died on December 31, 1946."
