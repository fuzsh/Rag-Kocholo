        "text": "2. Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, better known by her stage name Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, activist, record producer, businesswoman, fashion designer, philanthropist, and actress. She was born in March 28, 1986 in Yonkers, New York to Cynthia and Joseph Germanotta .\n\n3. Lady Gaga attended New York University's Tisch School for the Arts. At the age of 11, she was accepted to the Juilliard School in Manhattan, but instead attended a private Catholic school in the city. Gaga was granted early admission to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts—she was one of only 20 students in the world to receive the honor of early acceptance. While there, she studied music and worked on her songwriting skills. She later dropped from school to find creative inspiration. To make ends meet, she took three jobs, including a stint as a go-go dancer, while she honed her performance-art act. She didn’t take any private lessons.\n\n4. First Big Success(s) Lady Gaga’s first big success is the song ‘The Fame’. It was released in August 19, 2008. It was a studio album. The awards that she won for this album was: Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Echo Award for Best International Newcomer, Brit Award for International Album, Echo Award for Best International Rock/Pop Female Artist, Billboard Music Award for Top Dance Album.\n\n5. Lady Gaga’s aunt, Joanne Germanotta inspires all her music and art. And an indian physician, Deepak Chopra. She had take influences from many musicians like Madonna and Micheal Jackson.\n\n6. I learned from Lady Gaga to be daring, and successful in life. And never to be afraid of anything, and face what comes to you with letting go. And also to have goals/dreams set in your life and chase to achieve. And have fun in life.\n\n7. I chose Lady Gaga because I love her songs. And she stands against anti-bullying. I also love her fashion styles. And she inspires me a lot.\n\n8. Lady Gaga has 14 tattoos."
