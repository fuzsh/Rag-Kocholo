        "text": "Both Zarek and Asya decided that they wanted Orchids, Tulips, Lilies, Hydrangea, and Chrysanthemum for their flowers for the wedding. The color of the wedding scheme was to be an olive blue green with white gold and brown. Their parents loved the color template they came up with and soon came the planning of what else was going to be apart of the wedding. As for the photographer, they asked the cousin of one of the teachers who worked at the same school Asya worked at, since the cousin was a professional photographer. Next came the location of where they were going to have the wedding. Coming to a conclusion they decided to have the wedding at Historic Ashland since they saw pictures and agreed that it looked the most beautiful.\n\nZarek and Asya needed to figure out what was going to be on the menu for the wedding. For the appetizers they decided to go with cranberry chicken salad on apple slices, bacon wrapped dates, and butternut squash apple bruschetta, along with for the kids' tomato soup and grilled cheese. The main courses consisted of Cornish hens with apple-cranberry rice stuffing, pan-fried sea bass with miso, lemon, and thyme- glazed rosaties, or pork chops with fig and grape agrodolce. The dessert options they picked were berry tarts, plum and almond galettes, praline pumpkin pie, apple pie, blackberry pie, and for the wedding cake they went with a semi naked buttercream cake.\n\nThe flowers were done. ✅\n\nThe color template of the wedding was done. ✅\n\nThe photographer was decided. ✅\n\nThe location of the wedding was decided. ✅\n\nThe menu was completed. ✅\n\nThey still needed to include who was going to be in the wedding, the clothing, invitations, and how many people were going to be there. So, there were some minor things the couple needed to do before the wedding, and no they were not stressing out by any means of the wedding since they had a while to go. Asya knew her choice of hairstyle she was going with, and it was the vintage chignon. Her makeup was going to be fall related but natural. Her dress she didn't know what to decide so she left that for last. Zarek knew he was going to go with a nice clean hairstyle look with a curly undercut. He still didn't know what to decide for his wedding outfit."
