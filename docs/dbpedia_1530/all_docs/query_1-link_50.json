        "text": "\"Pnevmoslon\" is a Russian rock band, at the origins of which is a famous singer, musician and author of tracks - Oleg Stepanov. The group members say the following about themselves: “We are a mixture of Navalny and the Kremlin.” The musical works of the project are saturated with sarcasm, cynicism, black humor at its best.\n\nHistory of formation, composition of the group\n\nAt the origins of the group is a certain Lord Pneumoslon. Immediately after the band appeared on the arena of heavy music, its project began to be compared with the Leningrad group.\n\nOleg Stepanov (Lord Pneumoslon) is known to his audience thanks to the activities of the Neuromonk Feofan collective. Artist, originally from the cultural capital of Russia - St. Petersburg.\n\nFor the appearance of a rock band, one should thank not only the Lord, but also the second \"father\" of the group - Boris Butkeev. The creative pseudonym of the latter is a reference to the work of the bard of Russia V. Vysotsky “Song of a Sentimental Boxer”.\n\nThe guys founded the group in 2018. Before Boris had time to enjoy being in the team, he decided to leave the brainchild. His place was vacant for a short time. Soon the talented vocalist A. Zelenaya joined the team.\n\nAsya is the owner of a specialized education. At one time, the girl graduated from the Institute of Culture of the city of St. Petersburg. In addition to performing on stage, she teaches music. With the advent of the Green Song, the groups began to sound even \"tastier\".\n\nLord and Asya are not the only members of the group. During concert activities, musicians come out with the guys, whose names are not advertised. The musicians play the pipe, drums and bass guitar.\n\nThe peculiarity of the team is the observance of anonymity and the appearance on stage in makeup. Mysteriousness not only stirs up interest in Pnevmoslon, but also saturates the entire concert hall with special energy.\n\nThe creative path and music of the Pnevmoslon group\n\nThe guys work in the style of ska-punk. In addition, some tracks are \"seasoned\" with electronic elements. The musicians emphasize that it is not their intention to limit themselves to a certain genre.\n\nThe frontman of the group has repeatedly said that it is important for him to delight fans with high-quality sound and singing without using a phonogram. By the way, each performance of Pnevmoslon is a charge of positive emotions and the use of lighting effects. For such performances, Lord independently makes equipment.\n\nThe musical works of rockers are “impregnated” with foul language. Guys don't see this as a bad thing. Moreover, they are sure that if the obscenities are replaced by synonyms, the fans will not enjoy listening to the tracks. It is easy to guess that the performance of \"Pnevmoslon\" is designed for an adult audience. In a way, attending the band's concerts is a \"musical\" psychotherapy.\n\nThe group creates for the people. Artists draw inspiration from there. They compose tracks based on the requests of people. In the plots of the songs, every inhabitant of the Russian Federation, Belarus or Ukraine will recognize himself and hear about the problem that worries him.\n\nPresentation of the debut mini-disc \"It's been five minutes of fun\"\n\nAlthough the group officially met in 2018, the first tracks of the guys were available online in 2017. In the same year, the musicians presented a mini-album. We are talking about the disc \"It's been five minutes as fun.\" Among the presented tracks, music lovers especially appreciated the composition \"Everything went to ****, I'll sit on a horse.\"\n\nIn 2018, the group's discography was replenished with the studio album Counter-Evolution, Part 1. Fans were genuinely delighted with the song \"Seryoga\". Her character is a friend of the lyrical hero, he considers himself smarter than everyone, and, of course, loves to teach everyone around. The release of the disc took place at the Glavklub Green Concert and at Cosmonaut.\n\nIn the wake of popularity, they released a collection of minuses for the record. \"Fans\" got a unique opportunity. First, they sang along to their idols. And secondly, they could independently play their favorite tracks at home.\n\nSoon the discography of the group was replenished with another disc. The collection was called \"Counter-evolution, part 2\". Longplay was saturated with ironic tracks. After the release of the record, the guys performed at the prestigious Invasion festival.\n\nThe year 2020 did not remain without performances of the team. This year, the rockers delighted the inhabitants of Moscow and St. Petersburg with a bright show. In addition, at the concerts, the musicians presented the long-play \"The Tooth of a Famous Person\". Fans were genuinely delighted with the new products. Not without a “favorite track”. Of the songs presented, the audience warmly greeted the song \"Garage\" in a special way.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic motivated the frontman to create a \"thematic\" track. So, the musicians presented the song \"Coronavirus\". A video for the new track has also appeared on the network.\n\nInteresting facts about the Pnevmoslon group\n\nThe main critic of the team's creativity is the wife of the frontman.\n\nA distinctive feature of the musicians' tracks is conciseness and short duration. For example, the debut album, which consists of 13 tracks, will take the listener only 33 minutes.\n\nLord Pnevmoslon loves football and is a fan of the St. Petersburg \"Zenith\".\n\nThe frontman has several masks.\n\nLord says that he considers the Leningrad group to be the main competitor of his project.\n\n\"Pnevmoslon\": our days\n\nThe kids keep getting active. At concerts, they delight fans with the performance of new and long-loved tracks. In 2021, when the concert activity of the artists improved a little, they appeared at the venues of St. Petersburg and Moscow. The program included an autograph session, as well as a presentation of material from the new LP."
