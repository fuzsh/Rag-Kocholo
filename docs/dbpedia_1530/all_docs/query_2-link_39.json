        "text": "Asya Satti, a Swede of Sudanese heritage, had a childhood surrounded by an eclectic range of artists who became the key influences behind her own music: from Aretha Franklin to Badi Mohammed Al-Tayyib & Umm Kulthum.\n\nAsya spent her formative years travelling between Sweden, Egypt & London. She started to write her own songs at the age of 15, inspired by the everyday conflicts of life & love. Her international adventures also make her social profiles intriguing, often shining a light on locations & cultures rarely examined in other media.\n\nRecently, Asya has been celebrating her Sudanese roots by sharing her takes of some of the nation’s pop songs originally sung by male Sudanese artists. By reimagining them with a modern twist, she has divided the online Sudanese community. Some comments, from men in particular, have demanded she stop performing the songs, whilst others have encouraged her to continue in the hope that she can help to change such attitudes.\n\nCollectively, Asya’s music finds the common ground between Afro-fusion, soul, blues & touches of modern pop, her iconic vocals and strong rhythmic backdrop giving her music an hypnotic feel. She writes about women who are strong & conﬁdent, who also reveal an arresting honesty and deep-seated vulnerability – much like Asya herself."
