Fateyeva does justice to Adolphe Sax's invention. She is one of the best in her field.\n\nAsya Fateyeva sees no limits for her instrument and constantly brings the saxophone back into the focus of the music world: with innovative programs and great skill. In this arte documentary, viewers experience how she thrills classical audiences at the Elbphilharmonie and go on a documentary journey with her."
