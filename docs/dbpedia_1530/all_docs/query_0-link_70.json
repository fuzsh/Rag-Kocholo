        "text": "The Alternative Eurovision Song Contest 33 was the 33rd edition of the Alternative Eurovision Song Contest. The contest was held in Lithuania after Gamka won the last edition with their song \"Uraganas\", with a total of 446 points. It was the second time that Lithuania hosted the contest, and third time the contest had taken place in baltic area. Three live shows took place in Žalgiris Arena, hosted by Monika Liu, Monika Linkytė and Monika Marija.\n\nLocation - Kaunas, Lithuania[]\n\nLithuania, officially the Republic of Lithuania, is a country in the Baltic region of Europe. It is one of three Baltic states and lies on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Lithuania shares land borders with Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and Russia to the southwest. It has a maritime border with Sweden to the west on the Baltic Sea. Lithuania covers an area of 65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi), with a population of 2.8 million. Its capital and largest city is Vilnius; other major cities are Kaunas and Klaipėda. Lithuanians belong to the ethno-linguistic group of the Balts and speak Lithuanian, one of only a few living Baltic languages.\n\nKaunas is the second-largest city in Lithuania after Vilnius and an important centre of Lithuanian economic, academic, and cultural life. Kaunas was the largest city and the centre of a county in the Duchy of Trakai of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Trakai Palatinate since 1413. In the Russian Empire, it was the capital of the Kaunas Governorate from 1843 to 1915.\n\nThe Venue - Žalgiris Arena[]\n\nŽalgirio Arena is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the New Town of Kaunas, Lithuania. The arena is located on an island of the Nemunas River and is the largest indoor arena in the Baltics. The arena's maximum possible seating capacity for basketball games is 15,415, and 20,000 spectators for concerts (when the stage is in the middle, and 17,000 when stage is in the side of the arena). The Žalgiris Arena replaced the Kaunas Sports Hall as a major venue in the city. The Žalgirio Arena is used to host basketball games as well as concerts. The arena's namesake basketball club BC Žalgiris, which currently competes in the domestic LKL and the EuroLeague, uses the facility for all of its European and LKL home fixtures.\n\nFormat[]\n\nDesign[]\n\nOur newly crowned winner Gamka is portraying in his winning entry \"Uraganas\" a story about the illusions life makes us believe in, and the daydreams we fall into. It talks about the rush of feelings and emotions our experiences make us live, until the point of feeling like in a hurricane of feelings. All captured in an 80s inspired instrumental, which creates a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThus, this edition's theme art is portraying this vision. The center piece is the feelings hurricane everyone is feelings, especially our competing artists which have to deal with both the excitement and happiness of preforming on the stage, as well as the nerves that come with the responsibility. The slogan, \"Realizing Reveries\" sends a message of believing in your dreams, because even the most utopic ones can be materialized. The style is inspired by 20s-era cinema, which plays homage to the feeling of familiarity Uraganas gives off.\n\nPresenters[]\n\nMonika Liu, a dynamic and talented Lithuanian singer, captured the hearts of music enthusiasts with her captivating performance in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022.
