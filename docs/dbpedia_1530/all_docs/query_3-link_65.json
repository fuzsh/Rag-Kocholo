        "text": "Asya is the Course Director for MA Media and Cultural Studies. She is also an integral part of the teaching team for BA (Hons) Music Industries. She also teaches and contributes to BA (Hons) Media and Communications, MA Global Media Management, MA Public Relations, MA Data Journalism, MA Multiplatform and Mobile Journalism, MA Media Production, and MA Events and Exhibitions Management.\n\nAsya is committed to internationalism in education and the value of cultural and knowledge exchanges. This is central to her role as an international exchange academic lead for media students via Study Abroad.\n\nCurrent research and publications for Asya include studies around heavy metal in popular music heritage, folklore influences in contemporary Bulgarian popular music, and the Canterbury Sound as an opportunity to study aesthetic, continuity, place and myth in popular music cultural identities. Asya co-leads the BCMCR Popular Music Research Cluster and is involved with a range of journals, edited collections, and projects.\n\nAsya is the Course Director for MA Media and Cultural Studies. She is also an integral part of the teaching team for BA (Hons) Music Industies. She also teaches and contributes to BA (Hons) Media and Communications, MA Global Media Management, MA Public Relations, MA Data Journalism, MA Multiplatform and Mobile Journalism, MA Media Production, and MA Events and Exhibitions Management.\n\nAsya works with students at all levels within Higher Education – from Level 4 or Year 1 of a standard undergraduate degree, through MA, to PhD. She is committed to exploring co-creative, empowering and inclusive student-centred teaching and learning practices. Asya supervises Major Projects at BA and MA levels as well as PhD research projects.\n\nWhile her research is mostly in popular music culture, Asya has developed a broad teaching portfolio which includes areas such as:\n\nResearch methods\n\nPopular music cultures\n\nMusic Industries\n\nMedia and creative industries\n\nMedia theory\n\nYouth cultures\n\nDesign and visual theory\n\nAsya has also participated in international teaching exchanges such as the International Teaching and Staff Exchange Week at the Oulu University of Technology, 2018 and 2019.\n\nAsya’s PhD, supervised by Professor Shane Blackman at Canterbury Christ Church University and supported by full scholarship, was an ethnographic study into the creation and articulation of popular music within the social and political contexts of contemporary Bulgaria. Asya’s doctoral research became the basis for the monograph Popular Music in Contemporary Bulgaria: At the Crossroads (2019). This strand of her research – concerned with East European post-communist contexts and popular music – has produced a series of new research, especially around subcultural scenes in Eastern Europe.\n\nSince completing her PhD, Asya has also been involved with research dedicated to the value of popular music for the heritage and contemporary identity of places and their communities. For example, Asya has been working on developing a study in collaboration with Professor Paul Long, focusing on the local and international significance of heavy metal. Working with Professor Andy Bennett (Griffith University) and Professor Shane Blackman (Canterbury Christ Church University), Asya is the first editor of a collection on the Canterbury Sound in popular music.\n\nAsya has been actively involved in organising research and impact events such as the one-day festival Canterbury Sound: Music, Place and Myth (2017) in collaboration with the Canterbury Festival, and the Home of Metal Symposium at Birmingham City University (2019). She is also part of the dissemination committee of the international project Keep It Simple, Make It Fast: a biannual conference with a leading role for popular music, youth studies research, and cultural activism. Asya also engages with outward-facing, research informed activities as part of events such as Flatpack Festival and XChange Festival.\n\nAsya is involved as an editor, advisory board member, and reviewer for multiple peer-reviewed journals with international following such as Riffs, Metal Music Studies, YOUNG, and Journal of Youth Studies. As a co-lead of the BCMCR Popular Music Research Cluster she is committed to nurturing the collective intellectual project of the cluster, the development of impactful projects, ideas, and publications.\n\nSelected research publications\n\nDraganova, A.
