This fresh track seamlessly combines R&B grooves with a melodic rap flow, showcasing Asya's exceptional and mesmerizing artistry.\n\nIn Asya's own words, she describes the inspiration behind the single: \"When I first heard the beat in the studio, I immediately jumped into the booth and started freestyling. The concept for the song came to me instantly, and I wanted it to be a symbol of my 'come back' after taking a year-long break from releasing music. 'Soul Cry' not only reflects the challenges I've faced but also embodies my plans and aspirations for the future.\"\n\nPrepare to embark on a journey of resilience and ambition as you immerse yourself in Asya's latest musical masterpiece, 'Soul Cry'.

Stay tuned as Asya continues to captivate audiences and carve her path in the industry.\n\nAsya sat down with Wordplay Magazine to answer our infamous 10 Questions:\n\n1. So tell me, how did it all begin? What sparked your love for music?\n\nGrowing up my dads friend owned a recording studio in his garden and I would go there after school every week to record covers of my favourite songs at the time. I was only 9 years old when I first started recording there. This was around the time that I realised music was a big passion of mine and that I wanted to become a superstar. I have a family friend who is 3 years older who introduced me to the idea of singing too, as she owned a karaoke machine. We would spend hours rehearsing and performing to our parents. This is where it all began for me.\n\n2. Who are some artists that influence you and that you want to work with in the future?\n\nJhene Aiko, Juice Wrld and Dej Loaf are the top 3 artists that inspire me and that I would love to work with one day. All uniquely different but all provide me with the same warm, emotional feeling when I listen to them. Their flows and lyrics stand out to me the most and I would love to be able to write and deliver like them one day.\n\n3. What projects do you have coming up and can you give us any info on them?\n\nRight now I am just focusing on perfecting my craft, so I spend a lot of time in the studio experimenting. However I know that I want to work on and drop a mixtape before the end of the year.\n\n4. How would you describe your sound?\n\nI would describe my sound as versatile. I think it would be difficult to describe it with one word, but the style is definitely Melodic Rap.\n\n5. What's your proudest moment to date so far as an artist?\n\nMy proudest moment to date so far would be hitting over 1 million streams altogether on music platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music."
