        "text": "Summary üëá\n\nIf you like this content, send it to a friend ‚¨ÖÔ∏è\n\nHello, how are you?\n\nAraceli Tzigane | Mapamundi M√∫sica | +34 676 30 28 82\n\nAND NOW THE FLOOR IS FOR:\n\nASYA ARSLANTA≈û, FROM ASYA MUSIC & MANAGEMENT\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: I really give importance to musicians grounding on their own cultural music in this superficial time. I am not conservative nor have limits but we need to know our cultural motifs for carrying it to the future even if it is metamorphic. I believe someone could have more to say as long as she/he comprehends their own culture. That‚Äôs what is happening today. There are talented groups achieving that.\n\nThe sincere approach to music is as important as being a master player to me. Some local and humble musician get me more than world renowned masters. I enjoy listening to songs that have soul whether as masterfully or not. Perhaps I have this approach because I am not a musician but I think that I am able to distinguish the essence of performance as a loyal listener. Because it speaks to me. Music already requires us to make progress in its nature, pushing the performer to more but in case the source of motivation is to be ‚Äòthe most known one‚Äô I think there is something missing. That‚Äôs why I am interested in music directly. That‚Äôs what is directing my portfolio.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Which are the professional objectives you would like to achieve in the mid term?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: My aim is to create conceptual musical projects not only booking concerts. I did this in Izmir a fews years ago under ƒ∞zmir Metropolitan Municipality cultural and art activities. It was a first world music days that attained great interest by audiencies in Izmir. I created and managed all the processes which consisted of 10 concerts taking place within 3 months. It was a musical journey around the Mediterranean from Greece, Crete, Serbia, Spain to ƒ∞srael extending to Turkey. There was a soul in these musical days and great effort. My career precedence is creation and sharing, not only booking. Nevertheless, the current unstabilized situation doesn‚Äôt let us shape the future. Music market here is getting worse. That‚Äôs why I want to expand abroad.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: From your training, education, previous experiences, which ones of the skills or knowledge you got have been the most useful for your career as an agent of musicians?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: Having Geography education put me so much and broadened my perspective. It branches many subs like anthropogeography, physical geography, cultural, political, medical, oceanography, urban and more in it I can‚Äôt count here. For instance, we were able to study both the Pacific ocean floor, jet streams, agriculture of South America and a traditional wedding ceremony of middle Asia at the same time. This gave me both a local and universal point of view while I was into discovering the world. Also I took research methods lessons. So I knew how to research and approach other cultures, as having a full formation. I consider music as like a personal geographical element interacting with each other and at the same time I can hear the unique differences. Besides, I was organizing the official process of international people face to face when I was at the government department, so this made me obtain the ability of organization and recognize differences of foreign culture.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Apart from that or those skills, which other do you think are essential to succeed in this field of work?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: Definitely requires to be patience and practical thinking. There is no determined method to this job, and no one guides you. So you should play your own game. People might think how easy this job is but inside of it is the opposite, as you know very well. Musicians have a different rhythm, personalised expectations than others. No matter what, you should have mutual respect for artists you work together with. This is a collaboration, not a chain of command. It is not enough to provide the stage and backstage needs, we should have a sense of co-creating during the process even if for only one concert.\n\nWe should keep up with our music space and tendencies to be aware and stay up to date. Mapamundi Musica and Transglobal World Music Chart are some of precious sources for that purpose which I have been following for years.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Any particular advice for a fellow newcomer or someone who wants to get started in this field?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: I can advise that they should have work planning if anyone decides to get into this field independently. There is a huge difference between personnel of an agency which is already known, or working as a private agency. As a small scale agency, the first steps hardly pay off, portfolio and opportunities are limited, you are not recognized, you face financial borders. But we should not give up. Because all these experiences lead you to have an individual, particular way which is resulted in your own signature.\n\nEverything goes along with the help of contacts today. Even if we have the best, no one discovers us unless we promote us to all suitable stages, halls, festivals. And most of them would never respond to you! So better be determined and don‚Äôt take it personally.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: You are settled in Turkey. Could you give any tip to our colleagues or to the artist about how to enter the market of Turkey, if it makes sense to try?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: There is a huge interest in Anatolian music by European musicians. They are coming to take workshops, search, be part of performances or make projects. I am going to share my musical archive with a French musician tomorrow for example. But there are no any foreign world music agencies here. I see that some agencies promote Turkish music, which we left behind, as a Turkish music on European stages.This is like re-listening to the 70‚Äôs,80‚Äôs to us. However I must grant them the right that this is the easier way considering Turkey‚Äôs economic issues and even while we are thinking of expanding abroad.\n\nAgencies should be aware that Turkish music audiences have an extended musical taste, there are potentials on diverse genres, and but on the contrary unfortunately not enough concert halls to work for world music and totally mentality of work which mostly goes through persons on these stages. World music is remaining as a limited field of interest in Turkey.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: And now, for the artists. How do you choose the artists with whom you work?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: I am being told by my circle of musicians that it looks like I manage the music which I like. That‚Äôs true. No matter if it is famous or not, I prefer work for artistic and deep music. I mostly take into consideration the level of instrumental performance, and content of composition.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: I‚Äôm sure you get requests from artists every day to be their manager or agent. I am sure because it happens to me too, and many colleagues tell me the same thing. Do you have any recommendations for the artists, so that they can improve the way they communicate when they do it for this purpose?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: Yes I do. I can understand artists in this sense. They need someone who can represent them properly, however there are not many agencies working on the world music field. But I am not mainly an artist manager, I am project manager and book agency. I have only one group that I am manager of, Sinafi Trio. We have to go for fit artists for stages, hall, festivals; so mostly we have to say no regardless how great they are.\n\nThese are the Sinafi Trio, the band of which Asya is the manager, performing Arnisi, a piece composed by Elena Moudiri Chasiotou, the singer and percussionist:\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Do you think it makes sense for the artists to try to find an agent? Have you ever started a stable collaboration with a band or artist that approached you in their search of an agent?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: Do you think it makes sense for the artists to try to find an agent? Have you ever started a stable collaboration with a band or artist that approached you in their search of an agent?\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: I think there will still be, at least for many years, a lot of artists and a much smaller number of agents, that is the current situation. This makes me think that we are not in a very interesting business, otherwise there would be many more agents working in world music. Nevertheless, it seems that the artists require us. Something seems to be wrong, what is it?\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: We are not in popular culture so it doesn‚Äôt make money. People like us feel the need to have another source of income besides music. We need to have ground to get forward. Interest of musicians for world music is growing but there is a deficiency of supply from the stage side. It seems that we are a sort of demand before the stages, supplier before the artists. I think that‚Äôs the way it is going to be unless world music turns into popular culture. Most good artists make market music to get by. Who can blame them?\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Explain in one or two sentences, to the wider culture community, the reasons to book musicians from around the world that give a relevant presence to their roots.\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: The answer is in its name, which is world music. This is about how cultures influence each other by remaining their cultural core. That‚Äôs a personal preference depending on my musical background as a listener. I am thinking that if I worked on only my own culture, I would stick in a narrow perspective about music. Moreover, the world is not only about our own habitat, we contribute to each other by cultural transmissions. People listen to others when it comes to music. There are no meaningless nationalist polemics in it. It is not only about the neighbors. For example I remember a Japanese was into Teke Region music or a Portuguese was playing Ne≈üet Erta≈ü from the heart by sensing. Shortly, I like these interactions.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Please, feel free to add anything else you want to share.\n\nAsya Arslanta≈ü: Thank you for interviewing me. It is very informative to share personal experiences in the same field.\n\nSHARING INSIGHTS FROM THE EXILE\n\nBEHZAD POURNAGHI, CO-FOUNDER AND BAND MANAGER OF THE IRANIAN BAND RASTAK\n\nI‚Äôve listened to it again now and I really liked it again. I sent it to my mother, which is what I do when I really like something. She also liked it a lot.\n\nWhen I was in Istanbul in February I learnt from Kutay Derin Kuƒüay that the band Rastak had left Iran and settled in Istanbul. I find it terribly painful and I think they deserve a space to explain a few things. It seems that the world is getting worse. I refuse to believe it. I am very grateful to Behzad Pournaghi for sharing these reflections. If you are interested in talking to him about hiring Rastak, I talk to him on his LinkedIn and he also has Facebook. His phone is +90 552 662 7086 and his email is Behzad.p@rastakmusic.com.\n\nI have no business relationship with them and have not been paid. I have not been paid for any content in this newsletter. I don‚Äôt refuse, but if I ever include sponsored content, it will be clear that it is advertising. But I would like Rastak to be able to continue making music. I will now give way to Behzad‚Äôs declarations.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Tell me in a paragraph what is Rastak (foundation year, styles of music, number of members, instruments you play‚Ä¶ some basics).\n\nBehzad Pournaghi: Rastak is one of the most well-known bands in Iranian contemporary folk music, formed as an experimental music group in 1997. Rastak seeks to collect, record, and interpret Iranian folk music for a global audience. With a focus on Iranian folk music, Rastak has become one of the most famous ensembles in Iran, playing a mix of tunes from different parts of Iran.\n\nRastak incorporates language, culture, and history, merging traditional instruments and forms with contemporary rhythms. Rastak has tried combining well-known tunes with less well-known ones to shorten the generational gap and create a geographical bridge in Iran‚Äôs music.\n\nCurrently, the band consists of 8 musicians from various ethnic backgrounds and is based in Istanbul. The band members play different Iranian, Traditional, and folk musical instruments. Rastak put all these instruments together and practically used them in their orchestra.\n\nSiroos Sepehri: band director, tar player\n\nSeyed Farzad Moradi: lead vocalist, divan, setar, dotar, qupoz, tanbur, oud\n\nSeyed Behzad Moradi: lead vocalist, percussion, tanbur\n\nMaedeh Doosti: kamancheh, kamancheh alto\n\nMajid Poosti: percussions\n\nAkbar Esmaeilipour Farsangi: tar, setar, oud\n\nSahar Rashidi Torbati: qanun\n\nSelami G√∂rdeli: zurna, duduk, mey\n\nMM: Tell me 2 or 3 selected links to learn more about you guys.\n\nBP:\n\nWikipedia\n\nInterview with Indian Sound and Steps\n\nRastak Website\n\nRastak Official Youtube Channel\n\nThe Daily Star\n\nMM: I‚Äôve learned recently that all the band has moved to Turkey. I have to tell you that I was very sad to hear that. It seems like a critical decision. I think I and all readers are aware that the situation in Iran has been difficult for a long time for musicians and now even more so. But this seems like a decision with no turning back. Perhaps you would like to send a message to the international community related to music rooted in the identity of peoples about this. Please say what you consider.\n\nBP: The Migration. We have been independent of any government or private sector since the beginning. Despite the group‚Äôs financial challenges, we maintained our financial and operational independence during these years. Of course, we could only do it by implementing a system with financial and business discipline, which is exemplary for music groups. It sets us free of limiting and restraining boundaries and enables us to follow our passion for new ways to improve our music and performance.\n\nThe life of Iranian musicians in Iran is difficult. Despite Iran‚Äôs long and rich music history, the government has imposed strict regulations on music, making it difficult for musicians to present their creations freely (learn more in IranHumanRights.org). Musicians must adhere to the government‚Äôs moral standards, which can severely limit their creative freedom, such as female artists‚Äô involvement, lyrics censorship, and even in the purest folk storytelling.\n\nFor instance, unfortunately, Iran‚Äôs government creates many obstacles to women‚Äôs activities in art, especially music. We have fought against this problem for years in our ways, including refusing to perform without our female members, and endured many difficulties. Despite obstacles, we have been among the few groups that insisted on having our female artists in the band during the 25 years of our activity.\n\nThese regulations have significantly impacted Iranian music bands‚Äô ability to participate in international music festivals. Iranian bands are not allowed to perform at international music festivals abroad without a permit from ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.‚Äù In fact, for any live performance inside and outside, musicians need a permit from the ministry. Furthermore, Iranian musicians are prohibited from performing in specific venues and countries considered ‚Äúpolitically unacceptable‚Äù by the government.\n\nThese restrictions and rules have led many individual musicians and bands to migrate to other countries to find a more tolerant environment to practice their art.\n\nMM: Besides making a concert, do you offer any other services? I mean, for instance, studio musicians for recordings, composition for films/documentaries‚Ä¶ whatever you are offering to the world in the frame of the music of Rastak.\n\nBP: Ongoing Projects\n\nBorderless at Home\n\nIn 2019 we started a project called ‚ÄúBorderless at Home.‚Äù In this project, we are working on the music of Iran‚Äôs neighboring countries to be a messenger of peace while depicting the beauty of Middle Eastern music and culture. With all the limitations in Iran, working on that project and collaborating with international artists was tough. Since we moved to Turkey, we have been aiming to work on the project more. We have already met good artists and look forward to collaborating and working with them. We plan to expand this cooperation to other countries.\n\nListen to ‚ÄúBorderless at Home‚Äù on Spotify.\n\nUpcoming Projects and Initiatives\n\nIn the coming years, especially in 2023, we look forward to attending world music festivals and promoting and introducing our music to a broader audience more freely. Music festivals can help us reach more audiences and expose us to new fans who may not have heard our music. In addition, it can also help to generate buzz and excitement, which can lead to media attention.\n\nBesides live performances, researching, and creating our music, we have made film music and documentaries. Please check it on our Youtube channel here.\n\nSince the beginning of its journey, Rastak has been collaborating with great musicians from different parts of Iran. Now, we are welcomingly open to working/collaborating with international musicians.\n\nLastly, we are open to working with game developers to make music for games that need some Middle Eastern music touch.\n\nIf you like this content, send it to a friend ‚¨ÖÔ∏è\n\nINTRODUCING A NEW WORLD MUSIC SHOWCASE FESTIVAL\n\nTALK WITH PETER DIMITROV, DIRECTOR OF A TO JAZZ\n\nIf you like this content, send it to a friend ‚¨ÖÔ∏è\n\nCALL FOR ARTISTS FROM ANGOLA\n\nNTWALA OH YEAH!

The team from the Ukrainian Institute were unable to reach in time because of the complicated situation in the city, with frequent power outages, so this newsletter is open again to a voice from Ukraine. The fateful anniversary has passed and the madness continues‚Ä¶ I am glad that Mariana and Svitlana can continue with their activity and thankful for their insights.\n\nAccording to their own presentation, the Ukrainian Institute Kyiv is a state institution acting in the field of cultural diplomacy. The institution‚Äôs activities are aimed at improving the understanding and perception of Ukraine in the world and the development of its cultural ties with other countries. Established by the Government of Ukraine, the Institute operates under the administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is their website.\n\nI send some questions to them. These are the answers.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: What is the current situation for the musicians in Ukraine? Is there still any possibility to make a living by performing for the ones settled in the country?\n\nMariana Bondarenko (MB): Many musicians have united now to protect our culture and our democracy, they all give numerous benefit concerts in Ukraine and all over the world to spread a word about Ukraine: they played in the subways in Kharkiv to support families with their kids and pets who have been living there already for the first months of the war. Arthub Odesa launched an online music marathon ‚ÄúCultural power‚Äù featuring concerts to support Ukrainian army and refugees fleeing from occupied and dangerous territories. Music battalion started its activity already since 2014 and constantly provides benefit concerts and other initiatives in Ukraine. In Lviv since March Music cultural front was initiated, who started their first activities with jazz concerts at the railway station to support refugees and then organized many live streams from the bomb shelters. Many Ukrainian jazz musicians organize charity concerts all over the world.\n\nFor concert venues it has been challenging time, but luckily some jazz clubs reopened already since April in Kyiv, Odesa, Rivne, further also in Chernihiv, Uman, Drohobych. Lviv hosted a lot of musicians from all over Ukraine and thus made it possible to continue making music and performing. It inspired Institute of cultural strategy in Lviv to initiate a new project ‚Äúrelocation‚Äù who was premiered in the frame of Jazz Bez festival and engaged musicians from Lviv and other Ukrainian regions like Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, and others. Our brave festival organizers managed to make real wonders and held Kyiv Bouquet Stage, jubilee Art Jazz Festival in Rivne and Jazz Bez in Lviv, Przemysl, Rivne and Uman with international line-up. Music has never stopped ‚Äì whether on the stages, during sirens or in the bomb shelters, it keeps people alive and gives hope. CDs are being released despite all the struggles musicians are facing now.\n\nFor those musicians who have been working for cultural institutions or music schools, academies etc., it has remained the main source of their income. For freelance musicians it has become a real challenge, as after difficult Covid-times with online concerts that were not that much successful as one could imagine in the very beginning, the full-scale invasion has completely changed the way of life for many of them. Some had to leave Ukraine and look for new perspectives abroad, some others tried to find some new gigs, a lot of them went to Ukrainian army and changed their music instruments to weapons. Unfortunately, there are also quite many musicians who have left their main occupation and had to look for new jobs in other spheres of life, as they were not able to continue to play music and live for that.\n\nSvitlana Lenchenko (SL): Many concert halls and clubs are not able to organize events in times of war, especially after the missile attacks that damaged power line infrastructure and caused the blackout. But still, there are events, concerts and activities of the Ukrainian musicians taking place not only in Kyiv, but almost in every town and even in de-occupied Kherson. Most of these are dedicated to fundraising, and many have been done without electricity. The use of generators for concerts and rehearsals has become a regular occurrence for the Ukrainian music scene.\n\nIn addition, many promotional groups and concert agencies have gone out of business because it is not manageable now to invite international guests to the event in Ukraine, not many artists took up the challenge and came to Ukraine in 2022. However, it turns out that Ukrainian musicians are in the spotlight and the public is very appreciative of the opportunity to attend the concert, listen to Ukrainian music, spend some pleasant time and of course make a donation to the Ukrainian army, which is almost everywhere included in the entrance fee.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: The mission of your organization is ‚ÄúStrengthening Ukraine internationally and domestically as a subject using the tools of cultural diplomacy. We promote better knowledge and understanding of Ukraine internationally, and develop cultural relations between Ukraine and other countries.‚Äù Since the beginning of the war, have you had to rethink your objectives, your way of working, your messages or any other issues, to keep on with that mission? In what way?\n\nMB: UI is a young institution, this year it will celebrate its first 5th anniversary. So, the mission we formulated has started to realize in challenging times: 2020 and 2021 of COVID and then 2022 the start of the full-scale invasion of Russia. Since 24th February we faced the situation that our budget for programmes was fully frozen, and having an actioned-packed programme ahead without any budget we had to fully restructure our programmes and the way of work. Luckily, our European partners gave us a helping hand and many of the planned events still took place. Moreover, we had to put focus on advocacy of Ukrainian identity in culture, showing our country as an independent and free democracy that tries to get rid of colonization by Russia.\n\nOne of our tasks is also to show art and culture in the war, as many of our artists have left their main occupation and went to defend their country with weapons in their hands: we first presented at WOMEX an exhibition ‚ÄúUkrainian jazzmen at war‚Äù. Now the exhibition is in Warsaw and then will be exhibited at Budapest Ritmo and at jazzahead! Since the beginning of the year Ukrainian Institute is also working on this topic and is looking for the stories from different spheres of culture.\n\nSL: After Feb 24th, we officially asked our international partners for solidarity and support and called them to put on pause collaboration with Russian cultural scene until the end of the war they began, to suspend Russian participation in international cultural events such as festivals, biennials, exhibitions, art and literature fairs, to cancel any cooperation with Russian artists, and to help Ukraine by stopping any cultural cooperation with the Russian Federation and communicate their decision publicly. So that became one of our key messages, together with our strategic objectives and programme priorities that didn‚Äôt change very much ‚Äì the representation of Ukrainian culture and the strengthening of Ukraine‚Äôs voice had already been our baseline.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Have you noticed a greater interest on the international scene in your proposals? If so, has it been sustained over time, now that a year has passed?\n\nSL: Now, one year after the start of the full-scale invasion, we can say that the solidarity shown by the international partners was really enormous. In addition to the projects which had been planned beforehand, there have been numerous new requests and enquiries from representatives of the international music industry to advise Ukrainian participants of different musical genres to take part in the festivals, concerts, panel discussions, interviews, etc and to programme their performances. Our team did not only succeed in implementing the plans, but also in organizing a series of new events and collaborations.\n\nAs for the interest in our proposals and the Ukrainian context generally ‚Äì I think now it‚Äôs not just a sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but it is also a matter of discovering the diversity of Ukrainian music and reinforcing its international positions.\n\nMB: One of the most important partnerships we gained last year is the one with Europe Jazz Network that succeeded in further projects and initiatives:\n\n‚Äì the interactive list of Ukrainian musicians who had to leave the country since the beginning of war, was published on EJN website and spread among all their members, in such way helping them gaining more visibility among international actors of jazz industry.\n\n‚Äì joining Jazz Panorama programme adding Ukrainian jazz guide on EJN website.\n\n‚Äì we also took part at EJN conference as delegates at the official opening ceremony with the concert of experimental duo of Dennis Adu and Koloah.\n\nWe have started a big chapter of cooperation with Swedish partners. We are greatful to our friends Musikcentrum √ñst who provided residence for Ukrainian musicians and composers staying in Stockholm. Special thanks to Semente Cultural Productions in Stockholm for 2 big joint projects: first participance of Ukrainian jazz bands at 5th International Women Jazz Festival in Stockholm with the focus on Ukraine that is a real statement and great sign of solidarity. We also will have a collaboration project DUETS concert series by Ukrainian bandurist Georgy Matviyiv with Swedish drummer and percussionist Peter Danemo.\n\nThanks to cooperation with Knutpunkt, there was a unique possibility for 2 UA bands who participated at International Women Jazz Festival to make a #standwithukraine tour from 9th to 12th March in 5 Swedish cities.\n\nIn 2022, Ukrainian Institute together with jazzahead! team also initiated first official participance of Ukraine at jazzahead! in Bremen featuring the first Ukrainian national stand, delegation at the conference as well as concerts by Ukrainian musicians. The first printed music catalogue ‚ÄúJazz from Ukraine‚Äù was also presented there. It was a really historic moment, as all Ukrainian jazz community has dreamt about it for ages.\n\nFruitful work and negotiations at jazzahead! has succeeded with the first official Ukrainian delegation at WOMEX with national stand, exhibition, film screening, participance at the conference networking sessions and concert of Ukrainian-canadian band Balaklava Blues.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Could you recommend any online resources to get deeper into Ukrainian culture?\n\nMB: Here are some links that we gathered with our team that could be interesting for you:\n\nIntroductory course ¬´Ukraine: History, Culture, and Identities¬ª developed by the Ukrainian Institute, educational studio EdEra, and the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, offered on Coursera\n\nUkrainian Culture : Understanding the Country and Its People online course on Udemy\n\nOnline course ‚ÄúCrimea: History and People‚Äú\n\nTimothy Snyder: The Making of Modern Ukraine, Yale University course\n\nTimothy Snyder: Germany‚Äôs Historical Responsibility For Ukraine\n\nUkrainian-German historical dialogues ‚Äì 4 seminars organised by the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance and Bamberg:UA (Deutsch)\n\nThe Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine by Serhii Plokhy\n\nEnglish-language podcast ‚ÄúExplaining Ukraine‚Äù\n\nUkra√Ønica ‚Äì a database and syllabus-building tool to help you teach Ukraine created by The Ukrainian Research Institute (HURI)\n\nForum for Ukrainian Studies\n\nUkra—óner a platform of information about events in Ukraine\n\nWebsites ukraine.ua and https://war.ukraine.ua/ both created by Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and Ukrainian Institute.\n\nSL: As a sign of solidarity with the Ukrainian people, you can receive scores of music pieces by Ukrainian composers and perform them in support of Ukraine in your city.

It is truly important to showcase and support Ukrainian artists, bands, musicians and producers. Many of them lost their income, and the war tour schedule is something that is incomprehensible.\n\nOur modern, classical, jazz and indie music must become more recognizable at the international level, so helping us with building cultural ties and representing our music is a strong act of support in this day and age.\n\nMB: We would be happy to proceed with the Extra Sound programme elaborated by Ukrainian Institute ‚Äì it‚Äôs a long-lasting programme that foresees participance of Ukrainian musicians in international key music events (showcases, festivals and other initiatives) to provide intercultural dialogue between Ukraine and the world. So, we are inviting international music festival organizers to include Ukrainian musicians in their programmes.\n\nWe are also looking forward to music media cooperation. It is important that Ukrainian music is presented in radio, TV shows. Special thanks to Mapamundi for this interest to Ukrainian music and our situation now, and your professional approach. I am really happy these materials will be spread among your audience. We are ready to provide professional audience with information on music in Ukraine, music in the wartime, artistic proposals, and further information needed to help better understanding UA culture in order to provide intense international collaborations among musicians, cooperation on institutional level and finding partnerships among festivals, concert venues and other representatives of music industry.\n\nMapamundi M√∫sica: Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to add?\n\nMB: On behalf of all representatives of Ukrainian music sector I would like to thank to all our partners and friends abroad who have their open hearts and are willing to support us, to cooperate and to see Ukraine not as a victim, but a sustainable partner to continue professional intercultural dialogue between our countries. I strongly believe in cultural diplomacy, altogether we will definitely win.\n\nThe portraits are from the website of the Ukrainian Institute.\n\nIf you like this content, send it to a friend ‚¨ÖÔ∏è\n\nCALL FOR CONTENTS FROM #AUXSONS\n\nBRIEF NEWS FROM THE MEDIA, CHARTS AND SISTER PROJECTS\n\nTwo recent editions of Mundofon√≠as have been dedicated to productions made by Kutay Derin Kuƒüay.
