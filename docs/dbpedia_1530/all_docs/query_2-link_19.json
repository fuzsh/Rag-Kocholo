        "text": "Asya Fateyeva is a trailblazing virtuoso saxophonist whose performances are taking the instrument on exciting new adventures.\n\nCrimean born Asya Fateyeva performs both original works for saxophone and arrangements of baroque, classical and romantic compositions.\n\nShe engages in projects incorporating jazz, contemporary and world music, thus expanding her horizons and working with new artistic collaborators. Fateyeva sees herself as a multicultural and multifaceted musician - her music-making and artistry uniting diverse influences.\n\nWhether it's an early baroque programme, Bach's Goldberg Variations arranged for cello, accordion and saxophone, music from the 1920s by Erwin Schulhoff and contemporaries, or an encounter between organ and saxophone – everything is possible!\n\nAs a classically trained saxophonist, she stands out as one of the leading representatives of her field and is the recipient of numerous awards. In 2014, she became the first woman to reach the finals of the prestigious International Adolphe Sax Competition in Belgium securing 3rd place.\n\nAsya Fateyeva has performed with conductor Robin Ticciati with the DSO Berlin, Dirk Kaftan with the SWR Symphony Orchestra, Michael Sanderling, Kristjan Järvi with the MDR Symphony Orchestra, John Axelrod, Sébastien Rouland, Christoph Matthias Müller with the Göttinger Symphoniker, Vladimir Fedoseyev with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. She has also played multiple times with the Moscow Virtuosi under the direction of Vladimir Spivakov. Additionally, she has guested with the MDR Symphony Orchestra, the Tchaikovsky Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Bochum Symphony Orchestra, the Dresden Philharmonic, the Symphony Orchestra of Wuhan, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn, the Staatsorchester of Frankfurt/Oder and Kassel.\n\nShe has performed at festivals in Lucerne, Moscow, Cologne, St. Petersburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Dresden and Schleswig-Holstein, the MDR Musiksommer and the \"Spannungen\" Music Festival in Heimbach.\n\nFateyeva was a student of Prof. Daniel Gauthier at the HfMT Cologne from the age of 15. Important impulses came from additional studies in France with Claude Delangle and Jean-Denis Michat, along with advanced chamber music studies at HfMT Hamburg.\n\nFateyeva teaches classical Saxophone at the Musikhochschule Lübeck and the HfMT Hamburg. She lives with her family in Hamburg.\n\n„In Debussy's Rhapsody for Saxophone and Piano the young Asya Fateyeva plays the alto saxophone with such elegance and confidence that the beauty of the sound she creates is enchanting.”Harald Eggebrecht, Süddeutsche Zeitung\n\nThis biography is to be reproduced without any changes, omissions or additions, unless expressly authorized by artist management."
