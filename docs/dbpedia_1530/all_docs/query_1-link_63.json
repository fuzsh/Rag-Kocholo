        "text": "Voting Rules\n\nA breakdown of the famous friends of Lizzo.\n\nThis list is all about the famous friends of Lizzo. Who is Lizzo's best friend - and are they famous? Are Lizzo and Adele friends? What about Lizzo and SZA? All of these questions will be answered with this list of Lizzo's closest companions.\n\nLizzo has been friends with SZA for almost a decade, while Lizzo and Adele first connected at a Grammy party. Lizzo and Harry Styles started as fans of each other's music, but when they finally met, a friendship blossomed. Other Lizzo besties include Cardi B, who she has collaborated with, and Rihanna. When it comes to BFF's, Lizzo counts creative director Quinn Wilson and DJ Sophia Eris at the very top of her friend circle.\n\nWhich Lizzo friendship is your favorite? Take a look at this list to learn more about the friends Lizzo considers to be “Good As Hell.”\n\nIn 2019, Harry Styles covered Lizzo's song “Juice” during his appearance on BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge. A few weeks later, the two superstars met when they shared a private jet flight to Miami, where they both were performing. Harry invited Lizzo to join him on stage in Miami, and the rest is history.\n\nHarry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994) is an English singer, songwriter and actor. His musical career began in 2010 as a solo contestant on the British music competition series The X Factor. Following his elimination early on, he was brought back to join the boy band One Direction, which went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Styles released his self-titled debut solo album through Columbia Records in 2017. It debuted at number one in the UK and the US, and became one of the world's top-ten best-selling albums of the year. Its lead single, \"Sign of the Times\", topped the UK Singles Chart. Styles made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan's 2017 war film Dunkirk. His second album, Fine Line (2019), debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with the biggest first-week sales by an English male artist in history, and was listed among Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2020. Its fourth single, \"Watermelon Sugar\", topped the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nBorn : 02-01-1994\n\nBirthplace : Redditch, Worcestershire, England, UK\n\nSZA\n\nLizzo and SZA have been friends for years, and the pair got even closer during the pandemic. They even hosted an Instagram Live joint meditation session, focusing on self care, during quarantine.\n\nSolana Rowe (born November 8, 1990), better known by her stage name SZA, is an American singer-songwriter. She was born in St. Louis, Missouri, later relocating to Maplewood, New Jersey. In October 2012, Rowe self-released an extended play titled See.SZA.Run, which she then followed up with her second EP, titled S, in October 2013. In July 2013, it was revealed that she had signed to Hip Hop record label Top Dawg Entertainment, through which she released Z, her third EP and first retail release, in April 2014. SZA is an PBR&B and neo soul singer whose music is described as Alternative R&B, with elements of soul, hip hop, minimalist R&B, cloud rap, ethereal R&B, witch house and chillwave. Rowe's lyrics are described as \"unraveling\", that revolve around themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment.\n\nBorn : 11-08-1990\n\nIt appears that Lizzo and Cardi B first became friends around 2017. Since then the pair has collaborated on the song “Rumors,” and they both appeared in the film Hustlers. They regularly share their love for one another on social media, too.\n\nBelcalis Almanzar (born October 11, 1992), known professionally as Cardi B, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and media personality. Born and raised in The Bronx, New York, she first attracted attention for discussing her career as a stripper on social media; coupled with her \"no filter attitude\", she became an Internet celebrity through Instagram. From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York. In February 2017, she signed her first major label record deal with Atlantic Records. Her debut single for Atlantic, titled \"Bodak Yellow\", reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. She has worked with artists such as Migos, Bruno Mars, 21 Savage, and Juicy J.\n\nBorn : 10-11-1992\n\nBirthplace : Bronx, New York\n\nSophia Eris\n\nDJ Sophia Eris has been friends with Lizzo since 2008. Eris even tours with Lizzo to this day, and they regularly share their love of each other on Insta.\n\nBorn : 1988-05-21\n\nBirthplace : Dayton, OH\n\nIt's unclear when their friendship began, but Lizzo performed at Rihanna's 2020 Fenty fashion show. Lizzo has said that the famous friends don't talk much about work, rather they share sexual, playful conversations.\n\nBorn in Saint Michael, Barbados, Rihanna is a global icon known for her significant contributions to the music industry. Her full name Robyn Rihanna Fenty conveys her Caribbean heritage and she has often incorporated elements of this into her work. She was discovered by Evan Rogers, an American record producer who happened to be vacationing on the island and quickly recognized her talent. Rihanna's debut album Music of the Sun was released under Def Jam Recordings after she moved to New York City. The album showcased a blend of reggae, R&B and pop influences that were indicative of Rihanna's diverse musical taste. It peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart, paving the way for further success with albums like A Girl Like Me and Good Girl Gone Bad, which included Grammy-winning single \"Umbrella\". Over time, she became renowned for continually reinventing her style and sound. In addition to music, Rihanna has been involved in various business ventures including fashion and cosmetics industries. She launched Fenty Beauty line which received widespread acclaim for its inclusivity promoting a broad array of shades suitable for different skin tones. Furthermore, she debuted her Savage X Fenty lingerie line, aimed at promoting body positivity among consumers. Her entrepreneurial efforts have been lauded as much as her artistic prowess, making Rihanna not just a successful singer but also an accomplished businesswoman.\n\nBorn : 02-20-1988\n\nBirthplace : Barbados, Saint Michael Parish\n\nLizzo and Adele first met at a Grammy party, and they became fast friends. In an interview with Andy Cohen, Lizzo explained that they are both Tauruses, and they love to laugh together.\n\nAdele, full name Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, is a globally renowned singer and songwriter hailing from Tottenham, London. Born on May 5th, 1988, she made her way into the music industry with an impressive debut album titled 19, released in 2008. The album was named after her age at its creation and was met with massive acclaim for its mature sound and resonating lyrics about heartbreak. It featured hit singles such as Chasing Pavements and Hometown Glory. Her prowess didn't stop there; she took home two Grammy Awards in 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. In 2011, Adele released her second studio album 21, again reflecting her age during composition. This time around, the commercial success outdid even that of her first release - it topped charts worldwide and broke numerous sales records. Hit singles like Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain propelled Adele to international fame while also earning six Grammy Awards including Album of the Year. Adele released her fourth studio album titled 30 in November of 2021. The album 30 is inspired Adele's divorce, motherhood, fame, heartache, and hope. Beyond these achievements are further milestones that solidify Adele's place among musical greats: In addition to winning an Academy Award for Best Original Song with Skyfall (the theme song for a James Bond film), she returned triumphantly onto the scene after a hiatus with another chart-topping album ‘25' featuring hits like Hello. Despite personal challenges along this journey — vocal cord surgery in late-2011 being one — Adele has consistently demonstrated resilience alongside unmatched vocal talent.\n\nBorn : 05-05-1988\n\nBirthplace : England, London"
