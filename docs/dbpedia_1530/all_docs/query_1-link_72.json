        "text": "2\n\nParties of Asker and Gulchohra are diverse and wide-ranged. Image of major hero, dreaming about great love is expressed in the aria from the first act. The words are from the famous ghazal of great Azerbaijan poet Fizuli. In the second act Asker is quite different: he is excited, resolute, happy, and enamored. First Gulchohras aria from the second act is full of melancholy, pensiveness, and expectations. She dreams about real fine love, and these feelings are expressed in the next aria from the same act. The music of this area expresses inspired impulse, relaxation, and desire of freedom.\n\nThe next two vocal units  aria of III act and weeping-aria from the IV act, both return us to the primary mood of the heroine. They as though symbolize the sad fate of Azerbaijan woman of those times.\n\nImages of other heroes are expressed as genre and manner art. These are jolly songs and dances, inputting vividness, merrymaking, and comic colouring into the scenic events. They are songs of minor characters, duets, and comic sketch where servants declare of love: Jahan's couplets, Suleyman's song, Jahan, Suleyman and Veli's couplets and dance, Asyas couplets and dance, Sultan-bey's song, Vely and Telly's duet.\n\nActivity in Arshin Mal Alan develops very dynamically, there is no background or commenting items. Sole chorus of girls recreates national aroma and spirit. Composer delicately reproduces inflexions of Azerbaijan folk dances and songs. Inflexion of Azerbaijan folk song Galanin dibinde are heard in chorus of girls of II act, song Janlar ichinde janim  in Sultan-beys aria, inflexion of Terekeme  Asyas dance, and inflexions of song Boynunda var sarilig  in major melody of the overture.\n\nUzeyir Hajibeyov created bright and original vocal style in his music comedy. This style combines tunes of folk songs and mugam. European classic tradition of cantilena and national melodies are gone well together. This innovative achievement of Hajibeyov, combined with effervescent intrigue caused really world success of Arshin Mal Alan.\n\nThe scenic life of Arshin Mal Alan is incredibly gorgeous. The comedys premiere was held in Tagiyevs Theater, Baku, on October 25, 1913. The following actors were performers:\n\nHussein Gulu Sarabsky (Asker), A.Agdamsky (Gulchohra), A. Hussein-zadeh (Sultan-bey), A. Olenskaya (Asya), H. Husseynov (Vely), Gulsabah  khanum- (Jahan). Hussein Arablinsky, outstanding Azerbaijan actor and producer, headed the performance.\n\nAfter splendid premiere, Arshin Mal Alan started its triumphal parade on the stages of Trans Caucasus, Russia, and then all over the world. Arshin Mal Alan was translated into Russian, Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian, English, Persian, Turkish, Arabian, Polish, Bulgarian, and Chinese  66 languages in total.\n\nPopularity of Arshin Mal Alan was phenomenal. Here it is one of the numerous facts: they named cafes, restaurants, shops, etc. Arshin Mal Alan at the Caucasus. In 1915, in Tiflis (Georgia), there was performance of Arshin Mal Alan in four languages (Azerbaijan, Russian, Georgian, and Armenian) at one and the same day simultaneously (chronicle of theatrical life).\n\nThere were film versions of Arshin Mal Alan. The first attempt was carried out in 1916. The following actors performed the major roles in this film: A. Hussein-zadeh (Sultan-bey), Hussein Gulu Sarabsky (Asker), A.Agdamsky (Gulchohra), Y. Narimanov (Jahan), M.Aliyev (Suleyman). Trio of famous singer Jabbar Karyagdioglu supported the silent film. They performed music by living voices.\n\nFortune of the second film version of Arshin Mal Alan was scandalous. Producer from St.Petersburg G. Belyakov made it without permission of its author Uzeyir Hajibeyov. The film was not allowed to distribution after Composers active protest.\n\nIn USA in 1937 they made film version of Arshin Mal Alan, issued by Armenian producer R. Magalyan, where even name of Uzeyir Hajibeyov, author of music and libretto was not mentioned.\n\nAt the time of the World War II, they made a decision to produce music feature film Arshin Mal Alan. It appeared at the screens of the former USSR in 1945. Then it was distributed worldwide. The following actors performed the major roles in this film:R. Behbudov (Asker), L. Javanshirova (Gulchohra),A. Hussein-zadeh (Sultan-bey), L. Abdullayev (Vely), F.Mehraliyeva (Telly), M. Kalantarli (Jahan). Niyazi was music editor of the film, R. Takhmasib and N. Leschenko were produces, L.Arakishiyev, and M.Dadashov, cameramen  L.Atakishiyev and M. Dadashov, author of scenario Sabit Rahman. The State Prize awarded the film in 1946.\n\nNew coloured music film Arshin Mal Alan was made at Azerbaijanfilm studio in 1965:authors of scenario  T. Tagi-zadeh and M. Dadashov, producer  T. Tagi-zadeh, music editor  F. Amirov, major roles: L.Shikhlinskaya (Gulchohra), H. Mammadov (Asker), H. Yagizarov (Suleyman), A. Gurbanov (Sultan-bey), N. Melikova (Jahan) and others.\n\nIn 1972, Moscow firm Melodiya issued recording of Arshin Mal Alan in Azerbaijan, Russian, and Persian languages. There is a lot of literature as reviews, comments in mass media, scientific publications in magazines, books, and booklets.\n\nMusic star of Arshin Mal Alan is shining within world arts for 90 years. Music history of romantic and affecting love of Gulchohra and Asker excites and attract the listeners from all over the world."
