        "meta_description": "ASYA: Directed by Murat Aslan. With Lucas Bl√©ger, Marie-Ange Gontara. The elderly Pier spends the last years of his life alone. He has reached the age of seventy and has been living with a tumor in his brain for years. The tumor is inside his head, but he pays it no mind. In fact, he makes fun of his illness. Once a famous singer, Pier's only remaining thought that keeps him going is his past stardom. He still believes he is a star and spends his time in Mulhouse cafes, wondering if anyone remembers or recognizes him. Everyone thinks Pier lives in a grand mansion. Yes, every morning he dresses elegantly and gets into his sky-blue 1956 Rolls Royce parked in front of his house to take a tour around the city. However, this image does not reflect reality; Pier lives in a small studio apartment consisting of just one room and a living room. His children, one in Paris and the other in Nice, are both married and living their own lives.\n\nOne day, a thief breaks into Pier's house, and his life changes. As the thief robs the house, Pier wakes up and confronts the intruder. The thief hits Pier on the head with the golden microphone he received during the peak of his record album sales and then escapes. Pier is taken to the hospital, where tests are conducted. While the blow does not pose a problem, he learns that his tumor has tripled in size due to the incident.\n\nAt first, Pier does not dwell on the fact that the tumor has grown, but as time passes, the tumor's effects cause him to lose bodily functions. This situation further deteriorates Pier's mental state. The once-famous composer Pier Lauren begins to struggle with even the simplest tasks. After much contemplation, Pier decides to undergo euthanasia. He discusses the details with the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. Pier contacts his children, informing them of the situation. He does not mention his illness but insists that they come on his upcoming birthday when he will reveal an important decision. Upon his doctor's recommendation, he also requests a caregiver from the social insurance agency.\n\nAround this time, the unemployment agency sends Asya to work as a caregiver for Pier. Asya is a woman who grew up without much support, a single mother trying to make ends meet. At first, Asya and Pier have trouble getting along due to Pier's aggressive behavior, but over time, a friendship develops between them. Asya's uncle is knowledgeable about Sufism, and she introduces Pier to him. Her uncle, Kemal Baba, is a Mevlevi Sufi master. Pier watches a Mevlevi ritual for the first time in his life and is deeply moved. He asks Kemal Baba some questions, and Kemal Baba provides him with concise answers, leaving Pier profoundly affected. Kemal Baba prays for Pier's recovery.\n\nPier eventually informs Asya of his decision to undergo euthanasia. Asya is devastated and strongly opposes the decision, leading to a heated argument, and she quits her job. On Pier's birthday, his children come to visit. After a beautiful day, Pier brings up the topic and reveals his decision to undergo euthanasia. While his children are initially shocked, they eventually respect Pier's choice. The day of euthanasia approaches.\n\nOne night, Pier has a dream in which he sees Mevlevi dervishes and himself participating in the Sema ritual. When he wakes up, he finds that he has miraculously recovered, free from all his illnesses and no longer needing a cane. Pier, who previously had no faith, changes his mind about euthanasia after this extraordinary experience. In his healed state, he visits Asya, who is overjoyed to see him in good health.\n\nAsya has bought a birthday gift for Pier from an antique shop and gives it to him. Pier opens the gift box and discovers that it contains the gold-plated microphone stolen from his house. Asya didn't know that the microphone she bought was the same one that had been stolen. When she sees Pier's astonishment, she initially thinks he doesn't like the gift. However, Pier, deeply affected by the series of extraordinary events he has experienced, tells her that he now believes in miracles.",
