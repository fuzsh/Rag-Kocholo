Hello, let us introduce to you

The new tandem between Araceli Tzigane from Mapamundi Música, Spain, and Asya Arslantaş from Asya Music & Management, Turkey.

Two women from each corner of the Mediterranean and a common objective: to disseminate the artistic legacy of the music from the peoples, taking care of both its carriers, the musicians, and the essential third part, the client, whose trust and complicity enable the public’s access to this heritage.

A century has passed since the Treaty of Lausanne, that meant the largest mass population swap up to that time. But the thread that connects the music of Greeks and Anatolian peoples has not vanished. This project celebrates a common background, in a turbulent time, in which music creates new shared spaces.

The proposal consists in a double program with a concert by Sinafi Trio and a concert by Ali Doğan Gönültaş, with a shared part at the end. It can be enriched with extra activities, to discuss with the client according to his/her needs, that can be interactive workshops, talks, conversations with the artists… Let’s discuss your specific needs.
