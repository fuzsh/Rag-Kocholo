Brief Bio: Meet Nina! Nina was rescued along with a few other strays that were found abandoned on the streets. A rescuer was able to get them off the street and brought to the vet for a full check up. Nina is a sweet girl who deserves a home to call her own. We are looking for a home that understands the responsibilities of owning and raising a pup. Nina is patiently waiting!
