The lovely and incredibly sweet Nina – she is a real doll, with huge ears! Nina is very dainty, extremely cute and an absolute sweetheart. She enjoys her walks, interaction with other dogs and most of all being around people and having her tummy rubbed! Quite an amazing story really – Nina was seen running along the curb by the Norman Niles Roundabout for weeks. All attempts to catch her by various volunteers proved futile. Eventually we had to resort to assistance from Sean at Pet Transportation who was able to catch her before she became another road kill statistic. Dorin from Woodbourne Kennels again came to our rescue and took little Nina in until we had space for her up at The Ark. It is here at Woodbourne that Nina met her now kennel mate Diva who was another rescue being boarded and awaiting a place at the Ark. They two became fast friends and now it is wonderful to see how close they are and how they look out for one another. We truly hope that they can be adopted together!
