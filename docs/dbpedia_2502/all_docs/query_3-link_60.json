I knew that when I called and spoke with Angela, she would have the resources and connections I needed to put my mind at ease ... At the head of my team was Nina Pirrotti. I have so many things that I could say about Nina and her work, but her stellar reputation can speak for itself. However, it is very hard to put into words the feelings that working with Nina will provoke within you. From the first meeting I had with Nina, it was clear her unwavering commitment to justice is more than just a job for her – this is a passion. When I began to retell my experience and expressed my feelings, it was evident that Nina was fully present; she constantly gave me her undivided attention. Nina’s genuine interest in understanding my situation created a safe space where I felt comfortable opening up about my concerns.

Nina showed me what it means to be a strong, unapologetically intelligent woman. I pity any who oppose Nina, because she fights with professional ferocity, goes above and beyond in all aspects, and never quits.

I always felt like her only client - she was responsive and would get back to me very quickly throughout. Nina successfully settled the matter on my behalf in the best way possible. I have no doubt that she is the only lawyer who could have done this. She is a force of nature, who commands endless respect even from her opponents. I feel very fortunate to have found her and would recommend her fully and without hesitation. She is simply the best.

She is 100% the real deal! — S.C.\n\nNina Pirrotti – Nina represented me on an issue I had with my employer. From the first day I walked into her office I was greeted by her amazing staff who made me feel very at ease. Her paralegal Debbie was just the most efficient, warm, kind and understanding woman. Then I met Nina and she was amazing. I was so nervous, and she made me feel so comfortable. She explained every detail to me on how she would proceed with my case and took the time to answer all my questions. I knew from day one that she would fight for me and win. She didn’t let me down. I have recommended her to friends and I will continue to recommend her. I have never met an attorney who truly cares about you as a human being.

From the very first contact, including with her assistant Angela Mauriello, I was treated responsively and professionally. With Nina, I felt like I had a true ally in my corner who not only had the knowledge and expertise that I needed, but took the time to painstakingly explain the process, the legal terminology and ramifications, and went out of her way to keep me well-informed of every step along the way, as well.

Nina has made a tremendous impact both personally and societally.

Having her by my side was a lifesaver right from the start. Working in an environment where sexual harassment and hostile behavior were normalized, Nina explained my rights to me, validated my complaints, and gave me the courage to move forward with my case. I will never forget the day before we were to meet with the defendants to mediate. I was so nervous, but Nina was more than ready to take on the challenge. She said with complete confidence, “I live for this!” Nina can stand up to anyone! She is not only honest, kind and super smart — she is relentless, tenacious, fierce and dedicated right through to the end.

I would highly recommend her and her firm. — E.P., Ridgefield, CT\n\nAttorney Nina Pirrotti elevates the terms advocate and counselor to a new level. Throughout the process of settling my workplace complaint, she was very patient with me, quick to understand & untangle all the details, clarifying what is just plain rotten and what is patently illegal, explaining the legal process every step of the way, a superb communicator, always uplifting and reassuring.

As I told her directly after she obtained a positive resolution, contacting Nina was the smartest decision I made. She is a most trustworthy, honest, and capable attorney and I unequivocally recommend her to any CT employee requiring sound advice and a professional advocate if/when they are faced with a seemingly impossible to navigate workplace situation. — K.L.\n\nNina Pirrotti is an outstanding lawyer in every way possible. She is extremely professional, encouraging and saw the big picture, even when other attorneys I spoke with at other firms weren't able to connect the dots the way she did. She led me through the process very strategically and thoroughly, and without her expertise and reputation we would not have been as successful. She went above and beyond and made this awful experience as good as possible, to the point where I miss working with her! She is a rare gem and I feel so lucky to have found her. Five stars all the way!! — D.C.\n\nI unreservedly recommend Nina Pirrotti, Esq. and the Garrison, Levin-Epstein, Fitzgerald & Pirrotti Law Firm. Attorney Pirrotti saved my career, and my belief in legal justice advocacy work focused on Title VI, VII, and IX rights.

Having to work in an hostile and discriminatory environment is incredibly difficult and disempowering. Attorney Pirrotti not only believed in my case, she believed in me and the importance of the work that I do—she offered me a structural and interpersonal framework of support that empowered me throughout every step of my process to legal justice. Her legal brilliance, her connections to an expansive community of justice professionals, her compassion, her commitments to an anti-oppressive workplace, her extensive experience, and her fierceness for justice make her a truly exceptional lawyer and person.

The results were very positive and timely. Nina has my unwavering recommendation. She is AMAZING! — M.L., Greater New Haven Region, CT\n\nRecently, I was unceremoniously let go from my job that I had held for 35 years without any advanced notice and was told my last day of employment was two days later. I was devastated. I was handed a general release agreement to sign, which would have provided me with a little severance, but I was the main provider for my family and knowing I had no other means to support my family I didn't know what to do. I was then referred to Nina Pirrotti, who listened to my story, and told me I had a case worth fighting for, and immediately agreed to help me. Her kind words and encouragement were just what I needed and through her efforts I came away with a larger severance package, which I would not have been able to negotiate on my own. Her support of me and her tenacity to fight for me was extremely appreciated. — A Former Client\n\nProfessionalism, dedication, commitment, compassion, empathy, and wealth of knowledge are just a few adjectives to describe Attorney Nina Pirrotti.

Her work got me the satisfaction I wanted to receive from my former employer. Nina helped me get through a difficult time in my work life. I recommend her highly! — J.M., Orange, CT\n\nThis testimonial for Attorney Nina Pirrotti is something I felt compelled to write.

I have never encountered an attorney who went so far above and beyond what she was required to do just to be sure I was comfortable and protected. — Anonymous, North Haven, CT\n\nI was referred to Attorney Pirrotti by another lawyer -from another state- to handle a hateful situation I was facing with my former employer. I was in a very bad moment in my professional life, yet I was about to give birth to my first son. My heart was broken and I was living in constant anxiety.
