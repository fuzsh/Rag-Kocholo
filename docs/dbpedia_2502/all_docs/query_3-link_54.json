I have a cute grin, floppy ears, and charm that will knock your socks off. First things first - I'm a big fan of face kisses. Yup, you heard that right! There's nothing I love more than smothering my human pals with slobbery smooches.  I'm on the OHS Run Team! Let me tell you, there's nothing I love more than pounding the pavement with my humans! Strap on my harness and I'm ready to roll!  Tasty treats are my jam, so if you've got some goodies, I'm all ears - literally!  When it comes to adventures, I'm your gal. I just ask that I am the only dog on our adventures.      Shy and Nervous:   I can be a bit nervous when it comes to new people and places. But give me some time to settle in and I'll be strutting my stuff like nobody's business.   The type of home I'm looking for:    When it comes to my ideal home, I need a  home  with no other pets and prefer a calm environment where I can take things at my own pace.  So, what do you say? Could you be the one to give this goofy gal a forever home?   Click here  to learn about the adoption process.  You can also stock up on food and treats using our online store by  clicking here.",
