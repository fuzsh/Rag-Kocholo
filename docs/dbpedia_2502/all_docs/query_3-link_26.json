        "text": "Laekenois are a Wonderful Breed of Dog. They are not for everyone as they do require a committed investment of time in positive interaction for a lifetime. They do not thrive in life as a Faberge Egg on display. Laekenois enjoy time with their people and can be very demonstrative with them. With Strangers they can be initially reserved.\n\nAs a first time dog owner a Laekenois may not be the best choice, unless the breeder is able to connect the proper dog for the household.\n\nLaekenois are dogs that prefer to please their person. In this context it is important to understand that giving guidance for your expectations for your Laekenois is essential. Knowing what is expected of them is an important feature of their thinking process. They are most comfortable operating this way.\n\nFor example, as a habit directing your Laeken maintain a particular spot by the door when people arrive, is a good plan rather than leaving your Laeken to it’s own devices to make a decision about the people on the other side of the door.\n\nRemember the first role of the Laekenois was to guard flax fields alone. They are very capable of sound decision making, You must be sure their decisions line up with what your desires are."
