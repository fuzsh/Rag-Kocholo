        "text": "The Labrador Retriever has been voted one of America's top family dog. Anyone who has owned one can easily tell you why. Our Nina fulfills all that makes the Labrador such a great family dog, but also carries the lines within her to produce excellent field and hunting dogs.\n\nNina has both the ability to be mellow and at ease around our family or to spring into action, go for a walk or fetch a tennis ball.\n\nClick here to meet her 2013 litter\n\nMeet Nina's 2012 litter.\n\nClick here to see her 2011 litter\n\nClick here to meet her 2010 litter\n\nNina has consistently produced puppies that mature into big dogs. One of her first pups, \"Chester\" went on to become the stud for Graves Labradors. It is a great compliment to Nina that her pups are chosen to be studs for other breeders. The favorite female at Graves Labs is also a Nina pup! Both of these dogs are working hunters, and both had excellent on their OFA. I just received an email from a man with one of her and Buddy's 09 pups. He is not quite a year old and weighs 95 lbs. This dog is being trained as a working hunter also.\n\nTo see her pedigree, click here. Note that there are over 10 champions in her lines. Also, there is no inbreeding in her pedigree. This is important to maintain the integrity of the breed and to deter the genetic weaknesses that follow if you engage in these practices.\n\nTo the right, Nina's attention is on Jessie as she obediently waits for my daughter to throw the ball. Below, she keeps her eye on the target as she watches the throw.\n\nNina's Prelims showed normal OFA results. And, then we OFA'd her hips and elbows in 2008 to make 100% sure that they would clear. Grateful to our Lord, she passed with flying colors. Click here if you would like to see her certificates.\n\nNina also had a son OFA tested in 2008 year and he, Chester, also passed with an excellent rating. He can be seen at Graves Labradors.\n\nLynn, at Graves Labradors, also was OFA tested in 2010 and was awarded an excellent rating from OFA. She was a Nina pup in 2008.\n\nWe \"CERF'd\" her eyes and they are excellent. She also tested clear on both her CNM and EIC tests.\n\nRead more about health concerns in Labrador Retrievers by clicking here.\n\nClick here for Nina's CNM results\n\nClick here to see the results of Nina's EIC results"
