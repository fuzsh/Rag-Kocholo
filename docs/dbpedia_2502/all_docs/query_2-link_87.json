        "text": "When Nina Camplin was studying street art for her degree in fine art in 2003, she came up with an idea that would still be shaping her work almost 20 years on. Jessica Brown speaks to the Welsh artist about her journey\n\n“For one of my units, I came up with an idea of using dogs in public spaces in response to street art that I was researching at the time, in particular Banksy and his rats. I aimed to do a legal version of this kind of art,” says artist Nina Camplin.\n\n“It occurred to me that you rarely see stray dogs in the UK these days, and if you were to walk along a street and see a lone dog wandering around, it would really catch your attention, and the likelihood is that it had been abandoned or lost.”\n\nNina contacted DogLost, a service that helps owners reunite with their lost dogs, to ask if she could do this on their behalf.\n\n“They were willing to help me out by providing me with a list of local dog owners who had lost their dogs,” she says.\n\n“I wanted to put life-size dog paintings in public spaces, so that passers-by would do a double-take, thinking it was a stray dog walking the streets. I first came up with the idea of using these stray dogs as a way for people to try and find their dogs that had been lost or stolen, by putting WANTED posters nearby to the dog painting.”\n\nShe contacted local businesses with blank spaces on their walls and found spaces to carry out her work.\n\nAfter this project, Nina, who’s based in Rhondda, Wales, went on to work with DAWG (Dorset Animal Workers Group) and used the dog murals to raise awareness of the plights of some of the dogs who ended up in rescue kennels.\n\n“Each mural had a painting of the actual dog and a small write up nearby explaining how the dog had ended up in the rescue home,” Nina says.\n\nAnd the artist loves the general public reacting her murals.\n\n“They bring a smile to people’s faces when they see them,” she says.\n\nAlthough, some dogs don’t quite appreciate her work as much as humans.\n\n“Not all dogs react in the same way. I have seen some get very aggressive with the dog murals and try to pick fights with them!”\n\nAfter doing these two projects, Nina began to get enquiries from people who wanted to have their own dogs painted on their walls after seeing the ones she had already done.\n\n“To begin with I was doing these for free as I felt it was a great way to get my name out there, but I started to get too many bookings and eventually had to start charging people,” she says.\n\nIn another project she named Diamond Dogs, Nina became artist-in-residence of the Pembroke Dock VC Gallery and pained its corgi mascot on the side of the building. Soon enough, other shops on the street wanted a piece of the dog action, and she ended up doing more than half a dozen on the same street for various businesses.\n\nNow, Nina has completed around 50 murals, and on top of her usual dogs, she has also been commissioned to do a few murals of pet cats.\n\nNina says it takes between two and three hours to do a dog mural from start to finish, and estimates they will last up to 15 years, depending on weather conditions.\n\nShe has travelled from across the UK, to Poole, Bournemouth, Swanage, Isle of Wight, Haverfordwest, Pembroke Dock and Pembroke, to do her murals.\n\nWhile she has owned dogs in the past, Nina currently doesn’t have a dog of her own due to her living circumstances but hopes to have one in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, she is still creating murals. Nina has a few more planned and is taking new commissions."
