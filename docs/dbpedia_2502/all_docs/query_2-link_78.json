        "text": "CVI DATA\n\n©Bailing Out Benji 2020\n\nAll research and information was done by the volunteer team at Bailing Out Benji and therefore must be cited as such when shared or quoted.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n“We don’t buy from puppy mills.”\n\n“All of our puppies come from small, local breeders.”\n\n“We visit every breeder we buy from.”\n\nWe have all heard these sentences come from the mouths of pet store owners and their employees. They paint this beautiful picture of puppies running by a pond and parents frolicking in the fresh, green grass… Sadly, 99% of the time that is a bold faced lie. The pet store owners know it, the employees might know it- but the customer is completely in the dark.\n\nThis is why we are here.\n\nBailing Out Benji is a small nonprofit that started in Ames, Iowa and now has volunteer teams all over the country. We are all committed to raising awareness about the puppy mill issue, particularly the connection to pet stores.\n\nSo what is the truth? What is the public supposed to believe when the nice store owner and employees paint such a believable and beautiful picture? Again… This is why we are here.\n\nVolunteers from Bailing Out Benji devote their free time to researching puppy mills to create puppy mill maps for the worst states, as well as raise awareness about notorious pet stores and breeding operations with huge violations.\n\nNOTE:\n\nBefore an animal is transported out of state, a veterinarian, accredited by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), must examine the animal for signs of “infectious, contagious or communicable disease” and, if no disease is found, sign the certificate for approval to transport.\n\nMany breeders also sell to dealers, such as Choice Puppies (formerly known as Hunte Corporation) in Missouri, J.A.K.’s Puppies, Inc. in Iowa or Nebraskaland Pets, Inc. in Nebraska, who, in turn, re-sell the animals to pet stores throughout the United States. You will see that some of the breeders below are also dealers and buy puppies from other breeders and re-sell to pet stores.\n\nTo make this easier, we will be breaking our article down alphabetically by each pet store and connecting them to the various puppy mills they use. For any questions regarding the information presented below, please visit us on facebook.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n25 Dog Service Inc- 511 Central Park Ave, Scarsdale, NY 10583\n\nKathy Brown, Novinger, Missouri- 184 adult breeding dogs, with a history of violations including: dogs living in standing muddy water, inadequate shelter, dirty water receptacles, etc. To view USDA inspection photos of this kennel, click here.\n\nKelli Hynes, Hays Kansas- Dog Broker who buys from relative (on the same property) Izene Hynes who has 160 adult breeding dogs and a history of violations including: dogs with significant hair loss, scabs, eye discharge, and horrible teeth issues.\n\nJo Ann and Ron Shadow, J&M Kennels.
