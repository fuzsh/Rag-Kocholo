        "text": "Meet Nina\n\nMACH C-ATCH UKC Ch. Leigh-Hi’s Keepsake MXS, MJC, MXP, MJP2, MJPB, OF, RN, T2B, CGC, TKI, CL4-F, CL4-H, CL4-R, CL4-S, chST, ITD, SCN, VTX\n\n5/3/07 - 12/30/18\n\nWe lost Nina unexpectedly from cancer. I miss her so much. You can read her final tribute by clicking here.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, The Association of Working Shetland Sheepdogs awarded Nina with one final title, Versatility Dog Excellent. A fitting title, for my incredible girl.\n\n**News Flash** In October Nina became one of the first shelties in the state of Minnesota to earn an AKC Scentwork Title!\n\nFrom the moment she first stepped out of her crate I knew this girl was special. She comes from a fantastic breeder out in Michigan named Kristi Walker, Leigh-HI Shelties. I saw this girl online and there was just something about her. After talking to Kristi, I knew I had to have her. She finished her UKC Championship undefeated from the puppy classes with 3 competitive group placements. She has gone on to earn 47 titles from 4 different organizations and is still going strong at 11 years of age.\n\nNina is my “rock” sheltie. She has the most awesome temperament. She is very outgoing and loves everyone from adults, to kids, to other dogs. She is often used to socialize puppies due to her gentle and loving nature. Nina is a smart girl and is willing to do anything I ask of her. Her super sound body allows her to be very athletic. As the reigning “princess” of our house Nina can be found cuddling in a chair with her people or clearing the yard of evil birds when she is not training or trialing. Nina is truly a dream girl and I am excited to see what else the future holds for us."
