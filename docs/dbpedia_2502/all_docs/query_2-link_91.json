        "text": "One measure of intelligence is being able to learn the name of an object after only hearing it a few times, a cognitive ability known as 'fast mapping'.\n\nHumans can quickly associate an object's physical features with its abstract label — a word — but it's been unclear whether other species could do it too.\n\nDogs are also capable of rapid learning, according to a study by ethology (animal behavior) researchers at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, whose experiments tested whether dogs could pick-out new toys with specific names.\n\nThe tests were done under two conditions: with formal training or social interaction. In both cases, a new object's name was only mentioned four times.\n\nFormal training involved an 'exclusion-based task', where a dog was presented with seven familiar toys plus one novel object. Social interaction involved playing with their owner, who would say the object's name. After 2 minutes, the dog was then presented with a choice of two new toys and asked to \"Bring (the object's name).\"\n\nIn the first part of the study, researchers tested two dogs: Whisky the border collie and a Yorkshire terrier called Vicky Nina, both known for an ability to recognize their toys. In a baseline test, Whisky correctly retrieved named toys 92% of the time (54/59 trials) whereas Vicky Nina managed 64% (27/42).\n\nBoth dogs were able to identify a new object during exclusion-based tasks, but only through a process of elimination, by excluding familiar toys and fetching a \"new toy\" rather than remembering its specific name. That conclusion is based on the fact that the dogs couldn't distinguish between two new toys during a choice test.\n\nFollowing formal training, Whisky and Vicky Nina didn't fetch the correct toy beyond the 50/50 that would be expected by chance (40% and 60% respectively).\n\nBut the dogs were able to choose new objects after having learnt their names while playing with owners: Whisky identified the right toys 71% of the time (17/24) while Vicky Nina achieved 75% (15/20).\n\nThe memory of names was short-lived, however, as both dogs were less successful in the choice tests after 10 minutes (with an even lower success rate after 1 hour), which suggests that reinforcement is needed to create long-term memories.\n\nFast mapping allows us to remember thousands of object names by toddler age. According to ethologist Adam Miklósi, \"Such rapid learning seems to be similar to the way human children acquire their vocabulary around 2-3 years of age.\"\n\nOnly some dogs seem capable of rapid learning, however.\n\nIn the second part of the study, the ethologists tested 20 dogs who were not known for an ability to recognize named toys. The results showed that, overall, those dogs didn't map words onto novel toys, even after playing with their owners.\n\nThe study therefore suggests that an ability to quickly associate objects with specific names is limited to gifted dogs like Whisky and Vicky Nina, so the researchers have launched the Genius Dog Challenge to further investigate the number of words such clever canines can learn.\n\nWhile it's tempting to describe dogs as intelligent based on recognizing objects, it's important to note that learning words isn't necessarily a measure of cleverness, as intelligence tests focus on what we humans consider to be appropriate metrics.\n\nOnline lists of the brightest breeds are often based on a survey of over 200 dog-obedience judges from the book The Intelligence of Dogs by psychologist Stanley Coren, for instance, so 'Smartest' dog actually means 'Most Obedient' dog.\n\nMy own disobedient Jackapoo knows the difference between Pheasant and Toucan, Squizza and Phil Mitchell, but won't fetch her toys if she's not in the mood.\n\nAs any owner of a naughty dog will tell you, their pet understands words —especially commands — perfectly fine... sometimes they just choose to ignore them."
