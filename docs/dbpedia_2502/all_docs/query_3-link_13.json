        "text": "Hi, I'm Nina. I am a 20lb Moyan poodle. I live with an amazing family. Below are some sweet things my human family says about me.\n\nâ€‹\n\n\"The best part of the world is the part where we have dogs. Dogs are more capable of loving then humans. Nina is no exception. She is so loving and always happy to see you. I wish I could say I am Nina's favorite person in the world. Truth is Nina LOVES everyone and everything the same. A true social butterfly. Our baby girl even believes that Nina is her biological sister. Our home is always chaos with a toddler, 2 dogs, husband, myself and random foster dogs coming and going and Nina is always there to pull us together again and make us laugh with her crazy antics. Nina is my angle, my therapist and my best friend. I couldn't have asked for a better dog. She is happy and smart and loves with everything she has.\" - My Human Mom\n\nEmbark Genetics"
