        "text": "Privacy Statement\n\nLucky Pet Supplies is aware that the security of your private information from the use of our web-site is an important concern. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Therefore we would like you to know what data we maintain and what data we discard. With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about our security measures.\n\nCollection of Data\n\nYou can use our web site without disclosing your personal data. You are not required to provide personal information as a condition of using our site, except as may be necessary to provide you a product or service at your request. When you use our web site, data may be stored for various security purposes. This data may include the name of your internet service provider, the web site that you used to link to our site, the web sites that you visit from our site and your IP-Address. This data could possibly lead to your identification, but we do not use it to do so. We do use the data from time to time for statistical purposes, but maintain the anonymity of each individual user so that the person cannot be identified. In cases when personal data is provided to others to provide you products or services you have requested, or for other purposes you have authorised, we rely on technical and organisational means to assure that applicable data security regulations are followed.\n\nCredit Card Details\n\nSensitive credit card payment details are never stored on our website or within our internal database system. All payment details are securely transmitted through an encrypted eWay gateway in real time to our banking partner ANZ.\n\nIf you place your order with us over the phone or request a partial refund of an order placed, one of our Customer Service team members will need to obtain your credit card details to process the transaction. Immediately following the call the credit card information will be destroyed.\n\nWe will never request credit card information via email or instant messenger. These forms of communication are not secure enough for transmitting personal financial information. If you receive a request via any form other than on our website or by phone for your credit card information, please notify us immediately via the contact page or by calling 1800 565 333 so we can notify the appropriate authority.\n\nCollection and Processing of Personal Data\n\nWe collect personal data only when you provide it to us, through registration, completion of forms or e-mails, as part of an order for products or services, inquiries or requests about materials being ordered and similar situations in which you have chosen to provide the information to us.\n\nThe database and its contents remain at our company and stay with data processors or servers acting on our behalf and responsible to us. Your personal data will not be passed on by us or by our agents for use by third parties in any form whatsoever, unless we have obtained your consent or are legally required to do so.\n\nWe will retain control of and responsibility for the use of any personal data you disclose to us. Some of this data may be stored or processed at computers located in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. In such cases, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the data that are equivalent to those that apply in the country in which you live.\n\nPurposes of Use\n\nThe data we collect will only be used for the purpose of supplying you with the requested products or services or for other purposes for which you have given your consent, except where otherwise provided by law.\n\nRight of Access and Correction\n\nYou have the right to review and amend any personal data stored in our system if you believe it may be out of date or incorrect. Just send an e-mail to the address given in the imprint or contact the Privacy Officer at the address below.\n\nRight of Cancellation\n\nYou have the right at any time to withdraw your consent to the use of your personal data in the future. Again, just send a message through the \"Contact\" facility in this website or contact the Privacy Officer at the address below.\n\nData Retention\n\nWe only retain personal data for as long as is necessary for us to render a service you have requested or to which you have given your consent, except where otherwise provided by law (e.g. in connection with pending litigation).\n\nUse of Cookies\n\nCookies are small text files that are stored in the visitor's local browser cache. Using such cookies it is possible to recognise the visitor's browser in order to optimise the website and simplify its use. Data collected via cookies will not be used to determine the personal identity of the website visitor. Most browsers are set up to accept these cookies automatically. In addition, you can deactivate the storing of cookies or adjust your browser to inform you before the cookie is stored on your computer.\n\nSecurity\n\nLucky Pet Supplies uses technical and organisational security precautions to protect your data from manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorised persons. Any personal data that is provided to Lucky Pet Supplies by you will be encrypted in transit to prevent its possible misuse by third parties. Our security procedures are continuously revised based on new technological developments.\n\nChanges to this Privacy policy\n\nWe reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable to the web site. We do not make any representations about third party web sites that may be linked to the web site.\n\nAcceptance\n\nTo make use of this website you are required to accept and comply by the website Terms and Conditions. These include terms, conditions, notices and disclaimers. You should read these before making use of the website. Your use of the website indicates your agreement to the following Terms and Conditions:\n\nVraca Willis Pty Ltd (trading as Lucky Pet Supplies) can at any time make changes to the Terms and Conditions without notice to you. If using this website following a change you are agreeing to the amended Terms and Conditions. If you do not wish to be bound by a change you should discontinue use of the website.\n\nContacts\n\nIf you have any problems, questions or ideas, please contact us using the in-website contact form or by post to:\n\nAttn: Privacy Officer\n\nLucky Pet Supplies\n\nPo Box 313, Sunshine, VIC 3020\n\nTel: 1800 565 333"
