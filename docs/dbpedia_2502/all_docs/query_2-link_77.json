        "text": "Beth,\n\nThought you might like to see some pictures of Harley. At just over 9 mo. she is my bundle of energy. Very smart, great sense of smell, beautiful coat, and very strong. She loves the water. Don taught her to run across the pool cover and she would stop and try to get two balls in the middle where it would sink down into the water. She blows bubbles trying to get the ball. Now that the pool cover is off she detours when playing fetch to step on the top step so she can get into the water. When she figures out she can swim it will be hard to keep her out of it. Her favorite game other than the water, is tug. She is to strong for me and my husband can only do it for a little\n\nwhile cause she pulls so hard and shakes. We love her so much and she is Nina's buddy. When Harley gets Nina going it sounds like Nina is dying, she bark/grows at the top of her lungs and runs after Harley who runs away and then back again. It is hysterical to watch. She also likes the sprinkler, she is like a little kid. She weighs between 50 and 60 lbs now. She is my forever buddy.\n\nThank you!!!\n\nI forgot to ask you what happened to that little pudgy bundle you handed me last\n\nSeptember? Tee Hee\n\nBrenda"
