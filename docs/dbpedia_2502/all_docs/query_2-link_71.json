Here is what would work best for me in my new home: -Personality: Big handsome sweetie pie with nothing but love to give! -Can Live with Cats: No, was surrendered for fighting with other cats in home -Can Live with Dogs: Yes, has lived with dogs previously. Prefers older, calmer dogs who won't pester him. -Can Live with Kids: Yes but a quiet, calm home may be best. -Needs Indoor Only Home: No, was an indoor/outdoor cat previously -History of Litter Box Issues: Yes, but possibly due to stress of other cats in home. He primarily went potty outdoors in previous home. Offering an uncovered litterbox with unscented sand litter may be the best option for him. -Energy Level: Medium -Bite History: No -Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: No Additional Information: Aldwin is one cool cat who wants nothing more than to be by your side. He loves being pet, having his chin/ears rubbed, and even allows a tummy rub if he's in the right mood! He is very affectionate and isn't afraid to let you know his enjoyment by drooling. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website (www.whatcomhumane.org/adopt) or in person at our facility. We recommend calling into the shelter after your application has been submitted so our front desk can give you next steps on our adoption process. View full description »\n\nHi, my name is Anais!

Here is what would work best for me in my new home: -Personality: Cautious, affectionate when comfortable, energetic, still learning to trust -Can Live with Cats: No, unless they are also FIV+ -Can Live with Dogs: Maybe a gentle, calm dog who will respect his space.

It's likely that once Barry is comfortable in his new home, he'll be an entirely different kitty! We think he will be a playful boy who solicits attention when he wants it, but he may always be a bit on the timid side when it comes to strangers and new situations.

Harley does have the tendency to get reallllyyyyy ramped up with play and will zoom all over. When she gets this way her sense of personal space flies out the window and she wants to be on your lap. She can be a bit nervous with quick movements and objects going over her head, so a patient home willing to work with this would be ideal! Harley is bonded to her friend Bunny and they are required to be adopted together. They're both HIGH energy and will definitely need regular exercise and mental stimulation to keep them occupied.

Would do best with another YOUNG and ENERGETIC cat. Not a good match for shy or senior kitties. -Can Live with Dogs: Unknown history, but likely yes pending a proper introduction -Can Live with Kids: No, Joey will need an adult only home -Needs Indoor Only Home: No - may benefit from responsible outdoor time -History of Litter Box Issues: No -Energy Level: HIGH! -Bite History: Yes, ask staff for more details -Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: No Additional Information: Joey is a misunderstood kitty looking for someone with cat experience and a little bit of patience. He was surrendered to the shelter due to biting and acting out in his previous home - this sort of behavior is common when cats aren't properly socialized with other cats when they are young (it's called singleton kitten syndrome and it's why we have a \"two kitten policy\"!). Joey is a young and active kitty who understandably gets bored when he's not given appropriate outlets for his energy, which in turn leads to him acting out. We think Joey would benefit from having a playful and tolerant companion - ie. a young/active dog or cat - to play with in his new home. He may also benefit from some responsible outdoor time (ie. in a catio, on a harness, etc.). Joey is a super sweet boy who enjoys affection - he just needs someone willing to give him a chance.

Both dogs were left alone for 8+ hours a day in his previous home and were not exercised as much as they needed - this is probably why they're a bit on the chunky side.

Kovah is a super sweet, people-oriented boy who would do best in a home where someone is present often. He was left alone for 8+ hours a day in his previous home and was not exercised as much as he needed - this is probably why he's a bit on the chunky side. Kovah would benefit greatly from having an active person willing to help him on his weight loss journey. He's never had formal training and may benefit from one or two positive reinforcement based lessons. Luckily he's super treat-motivated and eager to please!

Like many labs Milk will eat just about anything, so we recommend working on crate training at home to make sure he doesn't get into anything he's not supposed to.

I'm a PURPLE pawprint, which means I will fit well into a home that meets some specific criteria. Here is what would work best for me in my new home: -Personality: Shy, independent, still learning to trust! -Can Live with Cats: Yes, I have lived with other cats previously. All introductions should be supervised and done slowly. -Can Live with Dogs: Unknown history, maybe with a cat-savvy dog who won't chase him. -Can Live with Kids: Yes, recommending cat-savvy, 12+ -Needs Indoor Only Home: Yes -History of Litter Box Issues: No -Energy Level: Low -Bite History: No -Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: Yes, a neuter Additional Information: Saxophone came to WHS from a less than ideal hoarding situation and has been having a hard time adjusting to the shelter environment. He will need lots of time and attention to get used to a new environment, to be comfortable, and look his best. It would be preferable if his new home would be on the quieter, calmer side and he could have lots of hidey places he can go to when he. If you're ready to open your heart and give Saxophone his forever home, please fill out an application at the front desk!

I'm a PURPLE pawprint, which means I will fit well into a home that meets some specific criteria. Here is what would work best for me in my new home: -Personality: Shy, affectionate, quiet -Can Live with Cats: Sigourney was dropped off with another female cat and kittens, so she would likely do well in a house with another cat. -Can Live with Dogs: Unknown history. A slow and supervised introduction would be best. -Can Live with Kids: Older and/or cat-savvy kids would be ideal. -Needs Indoor Only Home: Encouraged -History of Litter Box Issues: Unknown history, uses litter pan well in shelter -Energy Level: Moderate -Bite History: Unknown history -Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: Yes, she will need to be spayed/microchipped before going home. Additional Information: Sigourney came to us as a stray with another adult female cat and seven kittens, so she was very nervous at first. However, as time as gone on, she has slowly but surely regained her confidence and become an affectionate purr-monster. She is still hesitant about meeting new people, but she loves pets, and will over time become a great lap cat.

I'm a PURPLE pawprint, which means I will fit well into a home that meets some specific criteria. Here is what would work best for me in my new home: -Personality Active, energetic, sweet, sensitive -Can Live with Kids: Unknown history with kids, but has been a bit fearful/sensitive to handling. Kids 12+ may be okay pending an initial introduction here at the shelter. -Can Live with Cats: Unknown history, but appears to have a prey drive - no cats. -Can Live with Dogs: Yes, pending an initial introduction done here at WHS -Can do Apartment Living: Ideally no, but may be okay in a larger apartment/condo (NO studios, tiny homes, etc.) so long as he gets lots of exercise and mental stimulation. Up to counselor's discretion. -Potty Trained: Appears so -Bite History: No -Positive Reward Based Obedience Classes Required: May be required to attend one private lesson depending on adopter experience -Energy Level: High -Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: Yes, a neuter -Additional Information: Titus is an active young pup who was surrendered to the shelter for reportedly not eating in his previous home. Unfortunately his owners didn't provide us with much more information, but we think this behavior could have been caused by stress. Since being at the shelter, Titus has not had any issues with eating - he enjoys his breakfast, dinner, and treats - and we think he's ready to find his forever home. Titus can be a bit fearful in new situations, but once he's comfortable he's a total sweetheart. As a one year old shepherd mix, he's got LOTS of energy and will need plenty of appropriate outlets for that energy. Titus would benefit from consistent positive reinforcement based training - he's a super smart boy who is eager to please and will likely excel! Titus would do best in a quiet home with an active adopter who will take him on lots of adventures (ie. hikes, jobs, bike rides, etc.).
