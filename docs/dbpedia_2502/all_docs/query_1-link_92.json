My e-mails have always been answered very nicely and quickly. I find it also very nice that EVG offers so many different tests and of course breeder discount is very pleasing. So I highly recommend working with EVG and looking forward to the future collaboration.’’\n\nVesa Kallionluoto, Connection & Siljans int´l papillons, Finnish KC DNA collector and Microchipper\n\n‘’Every time that I send an email, I receive a reply within a few minutes. The EVG team is always very fast to reply and always very efficient. I have friends who are also breeders and they also are very satisfied with EVG services and we all agree to say that they are a very serious laboratory! Every time people want to order some genetic tests, I suggest they order via EVG. The results come out very fast compared to other laboratories and the prices are very reasonable.’’\n\nJennifer Bellebeau, Biotiful Gems Kennel, France\n\n‘’Controlled breeding with purebreed dogs obliged the responsible breeder to choose genetically certified individuals. The EVG genetic Laboratory is also cited as an accepted recommendation on k9data.com, the most important evidence for the Golden Retriever breed. My Golden Retriever Kennel rely on EVG data working with them with a great pleasure.’’\n\nSvetlana Andric, Sanitacteam Day Kennel, Serbia\n\n‘’I just love the site, simple but very professional at the same time and so easy to explore and find all the information you need.
