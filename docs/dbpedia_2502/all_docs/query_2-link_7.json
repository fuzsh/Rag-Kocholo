        "text": "My name is Nina Pustova, and I have dedicated my life to the well-being and care of animals as a veterinarian in Ukraine. For the past 20 years. However, when the war started in Ukraine and a Russian missile destroyed my farm, I was forced to leave behind everything I held dear. Determined to make a difference despite the challenges I faced, I decided to share my knowledge and experiences through the power of books. Early Life and Passion for Animals: From a young age, my heart was drawn to animals. Growing up in a small village in Ukraine, I discovered a deep connection and empathy for these creatures that shared our world. Stray cats, dogs, injured birds—I would care for them all, tending to their wounds and nursing them back to health. My love for animals shaped my path, leading me to pursue a career as a veterinarian. Career as a Veterinarian: After completing my education at the Lviv National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnologies, I embarked on a fulfilling career as a veterinarian. Over the course of two decades, I have worked tirelessly to provide exceptional care and treatment for animals of all kinds. Whether it's performing routine check-ups, diagnosing illnesses, or mending injuries, my goal has always been to ensure the well-being of the animals under my care. Expertise and Versatility: Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of pets, each with their unique needs. Cats, dogs, birds, rabbits, reptiles—you name it, I've cared for them. My expertise extends to preventive care, guiding pet owners on responsible practices to maintain their animals' health. Moreover, I have gained extensive experience in treating various ailments and injuries, employing both traditional and innovative methods to provide the best possible care. Challenges Faced: Life took a tragic turn with the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. The devastation hit me personally when a Russian missile destroyed my farm—a place that was not just a home for me, but also a sanctuary for the stray animals I had taken under my wing. The loss of my home, my animals, and my livelihood left me shattered. It was a heartbreaking moment, but I knew I had to find a way to rebuild my life and continue making a difference. Sharing Knowledge through Books: In the face of adversity, I chose to transform my experience into something meaningful. With the realization that I could no longer provide hands-on care for animals, I decided to transfer my knowledge and experiences to others. I embarked on a new mission—to write books that would serve as comprehensive guides to pet care, covering a wide range of topics, from basic animal health to specialized treatments and emergency care. It became my way of continuing to contribute to the well-being of animals, even from a distance. Exploring Breeds: One of the focal points of my books is providing readers with detailed insights into various pet breeds. I delve into the distinct characteristics, temperaments, and specific needs of each breed, enabling prospective pet owners to make informed decisions about which breed best suits their lifestyle and preferences. From popular breeds such as Labrador Retrievers and Siamese cats to lesser-known breeds like Norwegian Forest Cats and Bernese Mountain Dogs, I aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of the diverse world of pets. Understanding Care Requirements: Beyond breed exploration, my books delve into the specific care requirements for different types of pets. I discuss essential topics such as nutrition, exercise, grooming, and mental stimulation, tailoring the information to the specific needs of each breed. Whether it's understanding the dietary needs of a particular dog breed or providing guidelines for proper feather care in birds, my goal is to equip readers with the knowledge and skills necessary to ensure the well-being of their beloved pets. Conclusion: Through my books, I strive to share my wealth of knowledge and experiences as a veterinarian, providing readers with comprehensive overviews of different pet breeds and practical guides on how to care for and nurture them. By offering insights into breed characteristics, care requirements, health and wellness, training and behavior, and emergency preparedness, I hope to empower pet owners to provide the best possible care for their cherished animal companions.\n\nRead full bio"
