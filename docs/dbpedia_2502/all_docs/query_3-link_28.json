        "text": "A kennel with Amstaff and Cane Corso as a specialty – our quality requirements and principles..\n\nAnnica Nina’s Kennel is run by me, Annica, and my husband Bengt and we started 2018. It has been, and still is, an exciting journey to invest time and love in a project like this. I have been around horses and dogs all my life so it is really a dream come true. We both work very hard to build this wonderful Kennel. You can read more about what is happening day to day and about our litters on Facebook.\n\nWhen you buy one of our puppies…\n\n…we will try to help in every way, to make it as easy as possible for you. If you don’t have a car, we will pick you up and drop you off at the nearest train station or airport. If you need to stay overnight, we can help book a hotel room.\n\nAnd you’ll have plenty of useful things to bring home that will make it easier for your new little friend to become part of the family.\n\nOur goals, quality requirements and principles for the kennel\n\nOur goal is for all our dogs to be happy and healthy both in mind and heart. To be included in breeding, the dogs must have undergone a proper examination by a veterinarian, be X-rayed, have their heart checked and have undergone BPH or equivalent.\n\nInbreeding index according to Swedish Kennel Club’s (SKK) guidelines.\n\nThe well-being of dogs is always our highest priority and must never be bypassed. The kennel is inspected by the County Administrative Board and approved without remarks.\n\nOur kennel\n\nThe kennel has an apartment for each dog and is built and located like a small village. We have deliberately built the houses so that there is a natural demarcation which minimizes disturbance between the dogs. All houses are well insulated and heated and have tiled floors and equipment adapted to each dog’s needs and well-being. Each apartment has its own exit with patio and lighting.\n\nOur competence\n\nI have long experience of dogs and horses and almost grew up in a kennel. I have supplemented this with the SKK breeder training, which makes me feel confident in having the skills required to run a professional kennel. Not to say that there is nothing more to learn – we do every day!\n\nWith love and wishes for a wonderful dog life!\n\nAnnica & Bengt"
