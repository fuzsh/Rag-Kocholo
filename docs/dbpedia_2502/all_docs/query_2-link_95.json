        "text": "Service Dog Training Program\n\nService Dogs of Excellence\n\nWe select, breed, and raise golden retriever puppies exclusively for our service dog program. The golden retriever is outgoing, devoted and affectionate, fostering exceptional partnerships with their handlers. We have been developing our line of golden retrievers for health, temperament and conformation to build a better working dog.\n\nBreeding our best service dogs allows us to capture, preserve and advance health, temperament and conformation traits. Each of our breeding dogs completes two years of training for Therapy Dog and Service Dog in addition to Puppy Head Start, On Leash, Off Leash, and public access training. Breeding dogs must also meet our rigorous health and conformation standards.\n\nOwner, Katie Weibel, graduated from university that specialized in breeding service dogs for over 40 years. The university's research is applied to our screening and selecting breeding stock, whelping practices, and early handling protocols giving our puppies a monumental advantage to succeed in health, temperament and trainability.\n\nA service dog is a financial and emotional investment and we guarantee a sound, working service dog for our clients. We do not accept existing pets into our program as health, temperament, and trainability are traits that cannot be overlooked.\n\nApproved service dog applicants will be matched with a service dog based on application requirements, medical recommendations, task(s) required, and lifestyle. You will meet with our service dog trainers and approve of the service dog selected for you. Training will then be completed, and the dog delivered to your home over several days of training.\n\nTypes of Service Dogs\n\nThe applications of a PTSD/ Psychiatric service dog are many; this is not an exhaustive list. PTSD service dogs are never trained to bark at, act aggressive towards, or used in any way to help 'protect' their handler. PTSD service dogs are friendly, highly social dogs suitable for public access that encourage the handler to become engaged with those around him or her. ​​\n\nService Dog Delivery\n\nService dog costs include the dog, training, care, veterinary services, and equipment. Fees range from $20-30,000 and are based on the type of service dog and tasks required. Payment terms are offered in 6 months or 12 months and will allow time for fundraising to help cover the costs of your service dog. Costs and payment terms are identified in our Training Agreement.\n\nOnce your service dog is fully trained, he or she will be delivered to you. Delivery is conducted in your home from morning until evening over the course of several days. You must be home and schedule all appointments and activities you regularly attend such as therapy sessions, grocery shopping, dining out, and religious services. Costs you must pay include the final payment, our travel to your home, lodging, and meals.\n\nService Dog FAQ's\n\nQ: What breeds are service dogs?\n\nA: Service dogs can be any breed, however, we select the most human-cooperative breeds for service dogs. Service dogs must have the desire to please and work for people. These breeds are Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Poodles, Doodles, and Shepherds.\n\nQ: Can I adopt a service dog?\n\nA: Service dogs are trained specifically for you. Because the training is tailored to you, there is not one for adoption. Service dogs require one to two years of training. After application approval, you are matched with a service dog for your needs, then highly specialized training begins.\n\nQ: How expensive are service dogs?\n\nA: Service dogs start training at eight weeks old. They have extensive testing and perfect temperaments for the job, upwards of $3000+. However, the puppy is still the cheapest part of training a dog to become a service dog. Training, lasting 18 months on average, accounts for most of the costs of a service dog. The national average cost of a service dog ranges from $25,000 to $50,000. We strive to keep costs well below the national average to help make service dogs more accessible to those who need them most.\n\nQ: Is there funding or grants for service dogs?\n\nA: Some local and federal agencies may be able to provide you with funding towards your service dog. This usually involves contacting local agencies (such as your local Family Center) and requesting assistance.\n\nQ: Service dogs are expensive; how can my family afford one?\n\nA: Many families do not have the funds ready to pay for a service dog. Several options to help with this challenge are split payments and fundraising. We do not require that you pay the entire costs all at once.\n\nQ: Is fundraising available?\n\nA: Fundraising is an excellent way to offset costs for your service dog. While we do not organize your fundraising events, we often join them! Options are virtually unlimited. A few ideas are: a dog wash, car wash, spaghetti dinner, sidewalk sale, a walk-a-thon, just to name a few!\n\nA go-fund me page with updates is another excellent way to reach many people without even leaving your home. We provide periodic updates for you to post about your service dog’s training journey. You also get to share the daily and weekly training pictures we post on Facebook and Instagram for everyone to follow.\n\nUse your talents and contacts (sewing, mechanical expertise, gardening, friend’s business etc.) to think of creative ways to share an enjoyable experience, service, product or gift in exchange for a donation. Many clients raise funds well over the costs and well before delivery day. You will be pleasantly surprised with the support from your community.\n\nQ: How do I apply for a Service Dog?\n\nA: Applications can be completed online, or you can request one to be mailed to you. We will review your application to better understand your needs and how a service dog may best mitigate your most significant symptoms.\n\nQ: What is the process for getting a service dog if my application is approved?\n\nA: We select a dog for you and invite you to the Training Center to meet your dog. If the match between you and your service dog is approved, we enter into a training contract and begin training your service dog. You are encouraged to visit your service dog periodically while he is in training over the next 1-2 years. At completion of training, your service dog will be delivered to you with a in-home training to ensure you master all of your service dog’s care, handling, and training.\n\nQ: Does my service dog have a guarantee?\n\nA: Yes, we have a detailed health guarantee for our service dogs which takes effect when your dog is delivered to ensure your dog’s health and your investment. We do not health guarantee a service dog when you purchase your own puppy/dog to be trained. We also provide support training for life, for both you and your service dog. In addition, we require that your service dog attend refresher training in the first year to ensure his training is maintained and no task changes are needed. We support our working service dog teams for life!\n\nOwner Trained/Self Trained Service Dogs"
