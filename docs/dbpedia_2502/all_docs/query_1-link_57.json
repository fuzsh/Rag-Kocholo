        "text": "Kim Deal, photo by Kristin Sollecito\n\nBreeders singer and guitarist Kim Deal has shared a new solo song. “Coast” was recorded by the late Steve Albini at his famed Chicago studio, Electrical Audio. It’s Deal’s first single for 4AD under her own name, and it’s available to listen to below.\n\nJoining Kim Deal on “Coast” is her twin sister and guitarist, Kelley Deal, marching band Mucca Pazza, and rhythm section Lindsay Glover and Mando Lopez. Deal wrote the song in 2020 after witnessing the “revelatory levels of low self-esteem” from the house band at her friend’s wedding, the Grape Whizzers, while they covered Jimmy Buffett’s “Margaritaville.” That, combined with an off-season vacation on Nantucket back in 2000, served as her biggest inspirations.\n\n“Coast” is not Deal’s first foray into the world of solo music. She started a 7\" singles series that extended from 2013 into 2014, tallying up a total of 10 songs—the most recent of which were “Biker Gone” and “Beautiful Moon Clear.”\n\nAfter leaving Pixies, as their original bassist, in 2013, Deal has poured most of her time this past decade into the Breeders. Once she and her sister reunited the band’s “classic” lineup, with bassist Josephine Wiggs and drummer Jim Macpherson, they issued the new album All Nerve, in 2018, rolled out two anniversary reissues of Last Splash, and dropped the archival song “Divine Mascis,” featuring Dinosaur Jr.’s J Mascis. Deal also covered Michael Nesmith’s “Joanne” in 2018.\n\nRead about the Breeders 1993 hit “Cannonball” at No. 22 on “The 250 Best Songs of the 1990s.”"
