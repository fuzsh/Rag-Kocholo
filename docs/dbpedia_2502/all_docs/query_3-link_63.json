        "text": "NORTH OLMSTED, Ohio -- On one extremely frigid day in March 2022, my friend and her son were traveling on snowy roads in Geauga County. They noticed a black object on the top of a roadside snow pile. It was a cat’s head!\n\nThey stopped. It looked like the animal was giving up in its attempt to escape the snow.\n\nAs they dug the cat out of the pile, it took off and ran under their car, getting its head wedged in part of the engine. The cat’s head was stuck!\n\nWith the car hood up, my friend tried to reach the cat from above while a Good Samaritan who stopped to assist was on the ground, trying to reach it from below. They eventually freed the cat’s head.\n\nMy friend and her son had a box in the car and put the cat in it for the ride home. It lay quiet and motionless from being cold and traumatized.\n\nAt home, they put the cat in a playpen and gave her time to decompress and warm up.\n\nKnowing they could not keep the cat, my friend reached out to me. At the time, I was not ready to take another cat, but I agreed.\n\nWhen I brought her to my home in North Olmsted, I kept her in a cat playpen to decompress and become familiar with her new surroundings.\n\nShe was understandably frightened, hissing a lot and scratching me numerous times. I often wrapped her in a blanket and held her. In time she was given room to roam and explore.\n\nI named her Nina. She eventually adjusted to her new home, warmed up to my other cat at the time and to Willow, my St. Bernard.\n\nNina is now a very affectionate cat that gives hugs, sits in my lap and sleeps with me. She even nuzzles Willow.\n\nI am so glad she’s mine.\n\nCarolyn Kolodey,\n\nNorth Olmsted"
