        "text": "Nina‘s Story\n\n❤️Nina is Available❤️\n\nPlease READ the bio and adoption requirements first to make sure you are a perfect fit BEFORE APPLYING.\n\nHello, my name is Nina. I am estimated to be 3-4 years old, Female, poodle/terrier mix that weights around 13lbs.\n\nI am an absolute cuddle bug that enjoys the life of leisure lounging on the couch or on a big comfy dog bed. I do get spurts of playfulness where I will run around with my foster siblings. I walk great on a leash, no pulling! I will seek out affection from my people by putting my head on their lap. My coat makes me unique in that it’s curly and straight in other places. I have a tiny baby patch of hair on my head that looks like a Mohawk. I absolutely love belly rubs and am learning to like treats. At first I wasn’t sure what they were or what to do with them. I’m house (potty trained) and crate trained. I currently use a doggy door at my foster home,\n\nDuring the week I get up at around 6:30-7 am with my foster family. I go outside to potty then eat breakfast. The rest of the day I lounge around inside or sunbathe outside. I do use the doggy door when I want to go outside. In the evening I eat dinner around 6-6:30. My foster mom lets me choose where I want to sleep at night. I can choose to go upstairs to sleep with her or downstairs in my very own crate.\n\nI'm working on basic commands such as shake, stay. I have somewhat got the hang of sit. I am learning that treats are really good things!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS:\n\n- Fenced in Yard\n\n- Patience for Training\n\nIf you meet all of the requirements and live within 1,000 miles of Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, please apply at www.doodlerockrescue.org\n\nNina is fully vaccinated, HW-, sterilized and microchipped."
