        "text": "Meet Nina!\n\nHi, my name is Nina! I am a 12 week old baby Fennec Fox. Oops, sorry, I mean Toy Poodle/Chihuahua mix. Everyone keeps telling me how much I look like a baby fox that I sometimes believe it! I'm looking for a home to call my own - do you have one to share? I love to play with other dogs my size (no big dogs for tiny little me, I don't want to get squashed!). I think cats are pretty awesome too, but they need to like dogs since I like to wrestle and play with them! I think gentle, older kids could be in my future too (12 years and up please!). For more information about how to make me your next 4-legged family member, please contact Michelle at michelle.p@poainc.org."
