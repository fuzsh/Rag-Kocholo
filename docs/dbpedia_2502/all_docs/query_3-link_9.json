        "text": "I am a UI/UX engineer and a dog breeder from Pirkanmaa, Finland, and my passions are technology and dogs.\n\nIn my own projects, my goal is to combine these two passions by renewing and enhancing dog breeding practices with the help of technology and data. I also want to offer better tools for dog people in all areas of the industry. My goal is to participate in the creation of user-friendly, research-based tools that promote sustainable and ethical dog breeding.\n\nWhen working with clients, I am meticulous and detail-oriented. It is important for me to understand what the customer wants and I always want to make sure that we are on the same page. Above all, my desire is to help and also be empathetic towards the customer, because the technology jungle can be a really confusing and even stressful environment for many. In that jungle, you need Nina, who helps, advises and works genuinely for the best of the customer.\n\nIn my spare time, besides spending a lot of time with my beloved dogs, my hobbies are drawing, knitting, gardening and agility.\n\nDegrees\n\nBachelor’s degree in Engineering (Information and Communications Technology)\n\nVocational degree in Information and Telecommunications technology\n\nWebsite design and implementation\n\nI got my first Geocities.com domain at the age of 7 and started exploring the world of HTML and CSS. From HTML pages, I moved on to familiarize myself with content management systems (CMS). I used Joomla 2.5/3.0 for many years until I decided to try the content management system everyone was talking about – WordPress. Since then, I have built several websites with WordPress, both for my own projects and for companies and associations.\n\nUI Design\n\nI have done several client projects related to UI design as a freelancer and consultant. The work projects have included a wide variety of user interfaces and user needs, ranging from control panels for production environments to various management systems.\n\nFrontend development\n\nI have strong expertise in frontend development. React.js and the Material UI library have become particularly familiar. I’m also familiar with modern development processes and version control (Git).\n\nProject management and planning\n\nI have done project management and planning in both my own and customer projects using DevOps methods. I also have experience using Jira in project management and documentation.\n\nRead more about my work experience and the courses and training I have attended in my LinkedIn profile.\n\nDogs have been a big part of my life for over 15 years. I have been breeding dogs on a small scale for over 10 years.\n\nOn the field, I have been more and less active, mainly in obedience and agility. In obedience, I have competed with two of my dogs at the national level.\n\nI have been involved in the activities of several dog associations and through that have organized and held various dog related events and dog training courses.\n\nWith dogs, I am particularly interested in their structure, movement and anatomy as well as genetics. I am passionate about the dog world through the perspective of dog-orientedness, ethics and sustainability."
