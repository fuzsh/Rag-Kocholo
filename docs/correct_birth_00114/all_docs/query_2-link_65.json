        "text": "Lewis Alan “Lou” Reed is credited for helping invent punk rock and has greatly impacted the culture of rock ‘n” roll. Lou Reed was a singer, guitarist and a songwriter. He was known for being the lead singer and songwriter of Velvet Underground before his departure into his solo career. Although Velvet Underground was initially deemed a commercial failure in the late 1960’s, Lou Reed’s solo career brought him considerable fame and placed him as one of the most influential rock artists of his era.\n\nLou Reed was born in Beth-El Hospital on March 2nd, 1942. His father Toby was an accountant, and his mother Sidney was a former beauty queen became a housewife after. Although he was born in Brooklyn, most of his childhood was spent in his Long Island home where he grew up in a Jewish Family. Reed’s interest in music emerged very early during his high school years. During this time, Reed learned how to play guitar and played for several bands. Reed also underwent electroshock therapy during this time. It was intended to cure him of his ‘disease’ that was bisexuality. After being ‘cured’ of bisexuality and recovering from his therapy, he resumed his education at Syracuse University to study writing and film. At Syracuse University, he met poet Delmore Schwartz who would later become a prominent figure and inspiration for Lou Reed. Reed regards Schwartz as one of the greatest people he has ever met. Reed went on to graduate in 1964 with honors and a BA in English.\n\nAfter graduation, Reed moved to New York City; the city where most of Reed’s lyrics were based off of. After moving back to New York, he began writing and recording for Pickwick Studios. Very early on in his career writing music, Reed distinguished himself from his peers as a gifted songwriter. Although Reed was often the lead singer in bands and even made a career for himself going solo, his voice was known for being monotonous. This goes to show just how powerful his message was and how skillful he was in writing songs. According to Reed, he found that making music was both an intellectual experience as well as a way speak out against a growing overly conforming society. Ultimately, this notion and belief that he led would later lead him to a prominent role in counterculture movement of the 1960’s. The movement of the 1960’s that rebelled against a culture that appeared to be oppressive aligned itself with much of Reed’s song writing material. Many songs encapsulated the daily struggle of city life and use of counter-culture drug use.\n\nAfter scoring a minor hit with his parody song “The Ostrich”, Reed’s career began to pick up. Pickwick hired a band in order to backup Reed’s very monotonous vocals. From Pickwick’s development for a new band for Reed, Reed met his future bandmate John Cale. John Cale was a Welsh viola and bass guitar player. They would later become collaborators and roommates in a Lower East Side loft before their career in The Velvet Underground.\n\nTogether, Reed and Cale later recruited guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker to join in their band, The Velvet Underground. Both of these new additions were friends of Reed that he made while he attended Syracuse University. Briefly after their establishment, the band caught the attention of iconic pop artist, Andy Warhol who was “hypnotized right off the bat” after the first time he saw them perform. Warhol would incorporate them into his parties and introduced them into the art scene in New York City. Eventually, Warhol took on the responsibility of being the band’s manager and producer. Early in the rise to fame, Warhol convinced the band to take on European model, Nico to be a singer in their debut album. Despite the band’s initial opposition to the addition of Nico, their album The Velvet Underground & Nico is considered one of the most influential albums in rock history. In this album, Reed served as the primary composer, song writer and lead singer in the album. Although initial sales seemed to be unattractive for the band with 30,000 copies sold, the album still had an adverse impact on those who did buy the album. Brian Eno famously stated that “everybody who bought one of those 30,000 copies, started a band”. Although very slowly, the album went on to sell an eventual half a million copies. With Reed at placed in the center of the band’s new widespread fame and popularity, the band became a mainstream success. A velvet spider that lived underground was recently discovered and was named Loureedia in honor of Lou Reed and his band’s legacy. With a short lived success, the band eventually began to crumble because of clashing personalities amongst the band. When the band recorded their next album, by then, Nico and Warhol were not affiliated with the band anymore. Eventually, tension grew between Reed and Cale which lead to Cale’s eventual departure from the band.\n\nIn 1970, Reed finally decided to leave the band and went to his parents’ home in Long Island. Reed found a job at his father’s accounting firm and worked their briefly before starting a solo career. Reed signed a solo recording contract with RCA Records. His debut album, Lou Reed did not reach the success he had hoped for. In 1972, after collaborating with David Bowie, Reed released Transformer which contained only one hit single, “Walk on the Wild Side”. The song paid tribute to transvestites and hustlers Reed met through Andy Warhol’s studios and warehouses. Many hit singles soon followed with “The Factory”, and “Perfect Day”. After the release of Transformer, Reed recorded a number of albums ranging from all kinds of differing styles eventually creating an antagonistic and erratic persona. His 1975 album, Metal Music Machine in particular, brought a widespread criticism to him. Over the course of his long career, Reed released more than 16 albums.\n\nIn 2013, Reed became very ill and his diagnosis was later revealed to be liver failure. Reed later received a liver transplant that May in 2013. He later died on October 27th, 2013 with further complications with his liver after his transplant. Much of the music world mourned his death as many regarded him as a “visionary”, and an exceptional singer, songwriter and musician.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/macaulay.cuny.edu/presentation/d/1exfpFgSRHy4ESC4iOjJagoqHm7GM3_A3oxbvVA9vX58/edit?usp=sharing"
