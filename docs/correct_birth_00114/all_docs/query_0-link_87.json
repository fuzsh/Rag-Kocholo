        "text": "Ragamuffin Parade (also known as the Calithumpian or Callithumpian Parade, the Rangers' Parade, or the Mardi Gras Parade) was an annual tradition in Freeport for many years that took place on Thanksgiving Day. Participants dressed as hobos and would go door to door and ask, \"Anything for Thanksgiving?\" The parade also raised money for the poor. In 1915, $46 raised by the parade, was distributed to those in need.\n\nRagamuffin Day started soon after Abraham Lincoln proclaimed Thanksgiving a national holiday.\n\nThe Nassau County Review in 1914, defined a \"callithumpian\" as \"a noisy parade or serenade, in which horn blowing, the beating of tin pans, and the use of other discordant instruments are the principal features.\"\n\nWilliam \"Barney\" Bornscheur is created with bringing the Rangers' Parade to Freeport around 1893. The parade attracted many people with crowd sizes reported to be equal to that seen when the circus came to town. In 1915, there was a Callithumpian Association that organized the parade, games, and a ball. Committee members included: Jack Mauersberger, William Pearsall, Otto Gottschaldt, Bernard Loonam, Jr., Angley Preziosi, Bert Haff, Russell Randall, Albert Forbes, Wilfred Smith, Anthony Fedden, Norman Dean, Harold Loonam, Jule Raynor, Mervin Schloss, Clarence Trubenback, Harry Kerley, Waldo Wufling, Oliver Golden, Frank McKeon, George Preziosi, Thomas McCaffrey, George Wufling, William Bornscheur, William Enkler, Frank Moran, Gordon McCarthy, and Sylvester Greenblatt.\n\nBeginning in 1922, the Callithumpian Parades were organized by the Henry Theodore Mohr VFW Post 1310 under the direction of Bornscheur. Bornscheur was made an honorary member of the post and the permanent chairman of the parade committee. In 1943, the parade was canceled due to World War II.\n\nThe last documented Thanksgiving Ragamuffin parade in Freeport was in 1966. For 25 years, during the summer there was a Ragamuffin Parade for children ages 4 to 7 on the Nautical Mile. That tradition ended around 1995.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Callithumpian Parade.\" Nassau County Review. November 19, 1915, 1.

He is considered the “Father of Freeport” and financed the excavation the Woodcleft Canal. He was prominent in Long Island and Brooklyn real estate. Part of his house, “Woodbine,” still stands on West Woodbine Avenue.\n\nIn 1885, Randall purchased 80 acres of land known as Oak Tree Place or the Bedell Farm in northwest Freeport. Randall called this section Randall Park. He laid out many of the streets, measured off 100 foot plots, and planted 1000 maples and 1800 evergreens. At one time he was the largest taxpayer in Freeport because of the amount of land he owned. In 1900, his company excavated the channels and canals on either side of Woodcleft Canal.\n\nThough Randall never held political office, many in his family served as mayors of the Village, including: brother-in-law William G. Miller; son Ernest S. Randall; nephew Raymond J. Miller; and grandson Russell Randall. Many streets in Freeport have a connection to Randall and his family: Randall Avenue; Ernest Street (now North Long Beach Avenue) named for his son; Jay Street, which took its name from Randall's middle name; Lena Avenue, named for his granddaughter Lena Randall Willetts; Overton Street, named for his second wife Mary Overton Randall; Miller Avenue, named for his brother-in-law and business partner, William G. Miller; and Woodbine Drive (East and West) that was named after Randall's home.\n\nClick here for images related to John J.

Randall organized the First National Bank and Trust Company and was its president for 14 years. In addition to serving as mayor, Randall served several terms as a Village trustee. His father was John J. Randall.\n\nRandall's first wife was Bertha Randall, whom he married in 1892. They had three sons and a daughter: Russell, Leslie, Clyde, and Alma. The couple divorced in 1922 after their son, Russell, gave testimony concerning his father's infidelity.\n\nRandall was a member of the Elks Club, Odd Fellows, and the Junior Order of United American Mechanics.\n\nIn 1934, Randall died of pneumonia during a cruise through the Panama Canal on route to his winter home in Santa Monica, CA with his second wife, Lucy. He is buried in Greenfield Cemetery, Uniondale, NY.\n\nRandall lived at 56 North Long Beach Avenue. At the time of his death, he lived at 394 South Ocean Avenue.\n\nAs mayor, Randall was preceded by Roland M. Lamb and succeeded by Sidney H.

In the early 1830s, a stage coach operated between Raynor South and Hempstead. Passengers were picked up three times per week from the Raynor & Mead storefront. At Hempstead, a connection could be made to Brooklyn. In a history of Freeport from 1900, the store was described as follows:\n\nAs far back as the memory of my informant 1837, Raynortown had two general stores. The larger of the two was that kept in the building still standing in what is now Pine Street, between Church and Main Streets. It was kept by Riley Raynor and John Mead. Its stock was not large but answered the people's necessities: dry goods, boots and shoes, hardware, etc., and last but not least, we are sorry to say, the indispensible [sic] annihilator, liquors.\n\nThe tavern was later acquired by Michael and Abraham B. Edwards. In February 1841, a fire destroyed the structure. It is unclear if the business was rebuilt, however, a 1846 article mentions a hotel in Raynor South owned by Michael Edwards.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Fire at Raynor South.\" Brooklyn Daily Evening Star.

She was the daughter of Captain Thomas Raynor and Miriam (nee Pettit).\n\nThe Main Street property had been in the Raynor family since 1839. Between 1864 and 1870, the original farm house was replaced by a home that was later described as a mansion. Around 1837, Henry Street was cut through part of the east side of the Raynor property. Martha Raynor was known for her gardening skills, especially for cultivating Night Blooming Cereus.\n\nIn 1914, it was reported that Raynor sold a piece of property on South Main Street with a 22-foot frontage for $7,500. At the time, it was said that this was the highest price for a piece of property in the area. The property was purchased by Morris Jacobson.\n\nThree years after Raynor's death in 1924, the house and remaining property was sold to Hustle Realty Corporation for $125,000. The house was torn down and replaced with a retail business building, Williams Furniture Company, Inc.; later, Forest Jewelers occupied this location.\n\nRaynor is buried in Greenfield Cemetery.\n\nSee Also:\n\nJacobson, Morris\n\nSources:\n\n\"Freeport.\" South Side Observer.

In 2003, the land became the site of the New Visions School School of Exploration & Discovery, Freeport's first magnet school.\n\nOriginally, the land was occupied by four houses. These houses were purchased by the school district between 1930 and 1940, and each was demolished. The homeowners and respective purchase prices were as follows:\n\n#78, Mrs. Richard Bedell, $7,650\n\n#80, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Bedell, $8,125\n\n#86, Mr. Andrew Taft. $8,000\n\n#94, Mrs. Charles (Ann) Reynolds, $5,150\n\nThese properties each had a depth of 200 feet.\n\nMr. Israel, who owned a strip of land along the back of the Raynor Street properties, received $5,000 for his property.\n\nIn 1927, Freeporters approved a measure to build a new grammar school. Though the property was purchased for this school, the district enlarged Archer Street School instead of constructing a new building.\n\nUntil the New Visions School was constructed, the site was used for sports including tennis, soccer, football, and baseball. It also was used as practice field for the Freeport High School marching band.\n\nSource:\n\n\"It Happened Years Ago.\" The Leader. May 26, 1983, 4.

During those years, he played in a number of bands and made his first recording as a member of the doo-wop group The Shades. He graduated from Syracuse University with a B.A. in 1964 where he expanded his interests to free jazz and other experimental types of music. He moved to New York City and took a job as a songwriter with Pickwick Records. After playing with a few groups, he formed the Velvet Underground in 1965. His solo career started in 1971. He became a widely respected member of the music industry and was inducted, in 1996, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2010, Reed was inducted into the Long Island Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nReed enrolled in Hebrew classes at Freeport's Congregation B'nai Israel before his bar mitzvah.\n\nReed's named his music label after the street he grew up on in Freeport, Oakfield Avenue Music Ltd.\n\nLou Reed died in Southampton, NY on October 27, 2013.\n\nSee Also:\n\nSources:\n\nResearched by Cynthia J.

He is a member of the fourth generation of his family to work on the bay, catching bait fish using handmade killey traps, a skill he learned from his grandfather. Remsen is also one of the few Long Islanders with the skill to build a traditional flat bottom boat with a square bow known as a garvey. Garveys have been used by baymen and local fisherman for generations, especially in the shallow waters of Long Island's South Shore. He credits his high school shop teacher, John Devlin, with piquing his interest in woodworking. He made his first boat in 1954. \"I started it as a hobby,\" said Remsen, \"and it turned into a vocation.\" Over his lifetime, ​Remsen estimates he built over 100 garveys.\n\nIn 1957, his parents built a bayhouse opposite the Town of Hempstead Marina where Long Creek meets Woodcleft Canal. For 30 years the family ran a successful bait station from the bayhouse.\n\nAfter his father convinced him that being a bayman could never be a full time job, Remsen took a job with the telephone company. However, Remsen never gave up boat building and, in fact, considered this hobby a form of therapy, \"to relieve the stress and aggravation of supervising people.\"\n\nAfter retiring in 1991, Remsen devoted his time to maritime pursuits including boating, fishing, crabbing, supplying bait to local fishing tackle and supply stores, and boat building. Remsen maintained a woodworking shop on Southside Avenue where he built garveys with his son, John III.\n\nRemsen, along with his wife, Grace, were active in supporting the preservation of maritime culture. They were also members of Operation SPLASH (Stop Polluting, Littering and Save Harbors).\n\nOn September 9, 2016, the Village of Freeport honored Remsen for his service to the country and community by naming canal number 4, Remsen Canal.\n\nClick here for images related to John Remsen.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Bayman Dies at 82.\" The Leader.

They are intended to enhance property value by controlling development. In Freeport, restrictive covenants predate zoning laws, which came into effect in the early 1920s. Freeport's restrictive covenants were created by real estate developers and imposed limitations on the use of the lots (i.e. single family homes versus business development).\n\nAccording to an advertisement for Stearns Park in Daily Review on July 23, 1921, restrictions included the street frontage of property, “It was decided that Pennsylvania Avenue would be forever maintained as the site of high-class and attractive homes and to effectuate such decisions, all plots fronting on the avenue have been appropriately restricted. Plots fronting on the other avenues have been so restricted as to afford the erection of modest homes and yet carry out the general schemes of a pleasant and desirable environment.” In an effort to keep this desirable environment full of songbirds, an advertisement for Stearns Park in 1931 clearly stated \"No Cats Wanted.\"\n\nIn the past, restrictive covenants prevented community integration by barring specific racial and religious minorities from owning or renting certain properties. Current research has not been able to identify any racially motivated restrictive covenants in Freeport; however, such restrictions did exist in neighboring communities. During the 1940s, restrictive covenants prohibited African Americans and people of Puerto Rican origin from buying homes in Levittown.\n\nIn 1948, U.S. Supreme Court ruled such covenants unconstitutional, but it would take 20 years before such restrictions were criminalized. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited discrimination related to the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and sex. The act was later amended to include handicap and family status.\n\nSee Also:\n\nBlockbusting, Efforts to Combat\n\nZoning in Freeport, History of\n\nSources:\n\nBurchett, Michael H. \"Restrictive Covenants.\" Civil Rights Movements: Past and Present, 2nd ed.

Feeney, December 6, 2021.\n\nMoxey Alexander Rigby (c.1894-1962), was a graduate of Freeport High School (class of 1913) and long time Village resident. When elected to the District Court in 1959, he became the first African American to hold an elected office in the County. Judge Rigby was vice-chairman of the Freeport Housing Authority, an agency which he helped to create, and was also a member of numerous public organizations.\n\nBorn on Turks Island in the Bahamas, West Indies, Rigby was only five years old when his father, a boat captain, died. A close friend of the family, an attorney, made a favorable impression and apparently inspired in him the ambition to be a lawyer.\n\nHis mother soon brought Moxey and a younger brother, Joe, to Freeport where he attended public schools through high school. Upon graduation, Moxey was more determined to be an attorney. The first law book he ever owned was given to him by Sidney Swezey, a Freeport lawyer who served as village president (mayor) from 1917 to 1918.\n\nBy becoming a waiter at the local Elks Club, he earned enough money to enroll in New York Law School. He continued to wait on tables at the Elks throughout his undergraduate years. Graduating from New York Law School in 1925, he was admitted to the bar that year.\n\nAfter a clerkship in the law offices of George H. Beaubian in Hempstead, he opened an office in South Jamaica, Queens. Nassau District Attorney Edward J. Neary appointed Moxey to his staff in 1941. Rigby served under several district sttorneys, including Edward J. Neary, James N. Gehrig, Frank A. Gulotta, and Manuel Levine. In 1959, he was appointed a District Court Judge. Judge Rigby was married to Myriam Brisbane in 1932. He was the proud father of two children; Moxey and Cynthia, and grandfather of five. He suffered a stroke and died at his Freeport residence six weeks later on December 15, 1962. His last grandchild was born three hours before his death.\n\nTo honor Rigby's work in the community, the Village of Freeport renamed the Garden Court Apartments of Buffalo Avenue and East Merrick Road to the Moxey Rigby Apartments in 1963.\n\nClick here for images related to Moxey Rigby.\n\nSee also:\n\nSwezey, Sidney\n\nSources:\n\nFreeport High School Alumni Directory. 1914.\n\n\"Launch Judge Rigby Legal Scholarship.\" The Leader.

Unable to find a bat heavy enough for his liking, Ritchie made one using wood from a tree from his father's land. The bat was 44 inches long and was of a weight three pounds heavier than average bats of the day. This led to his nickname \"Old 44.\" It was said that he was feared by pitchers because of the many home runs he hit. He played on many teams including the Mohawks and Athletics. Ritchie played first base.\n\nRitchie served as manager of the Bedell Raynor's oyster business. He later succeeded Raynor in the company. In his 40s, Ritchie took up pumpkin growing. Some of his largest pumpkins were featured at the Mineola Fair including one that weighed over 300 pounds.\n\nIn 1882, while hunting in a swampy area in Freeport, Ritchie came across the dismembered remains of a woman. She would later be identified as Ella Clark. Though the case is unsolved, it is suspected that Clark died as the result of an abortion.\n\nRitchie and his wife, Arravill, (nee Losee) (1871-1925) had six children. Both are buried in Greenfield Cemetery, Uniondale, NY.\n\nSee Also:\n\nClark, Ella\n\nSources:\n\n\"Freeport.\" South Side Messenger. October 6, 1911, 5.

Robinson was an editor of The Amsterdam News. In 1923, Robinson and his wife, Nellie, lived at 4 Waverly Place in Bennington Park. Robinson, born in Virginia, became associated with The Amsterdam News as associate editor at the founding of the publication in 1909. He later assumed the role of managing editor. Prior to his work with The Amsterdam News, Robinson was the editor of The St. Mark's Mirror, published by St Mark's Methodist Episcopal Church at 316 West 53rd Street, New York, NY. He also served as president of the St. Mark's Lyceum.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Robinson founded The Citizen, a newspaper (also called The Freeport Citizen) as an African American publication for Nassau County. In 1924, Robinson was charged with libel by the Reverend Montrose W. Thornton of Bethel M. E. Church in Manhattan. In the January 23, 1924 issue of The Citizen, Robinson reported that Reverend Thornton was intoxicated during the morning services at the church on Christmas day. When Reverend Thornton's accuser, James H. Hale, later recanted his story and Robinson did not subsequently print a retraction, Robinson was indicted. His $2,000 bail was paid for by James Hanse, a former Freeport mayor. He was found guilty of criminal libel but received a suspended sentence.\n\nRobinson was very active in civic affairs, especially those concerning the local African American community. In 1922, he publicly condemned unfair real estate practices adversely affecting African Americans. Robinson served as secretary to the Trojan Civic League, an association of men and women who supported the moral, civic, and political advancement of the African American community. He helped found and served as president of the Long Island Colored Citizens Union, which was headquartered in Freeport. His work with the African American Community did not go unnoticed by the local Ku Klux Klan. In 1922, a letter believed to be sent from the Klan to Bethel A.M.E. Church made reference to Robinson's efforts to politically engage members of the African American community. Robinson, undeterred by such correspondence, ran for a seat on the school board in 1924. Though he lost his bid for the position, possibly due to Klan involvement, Robinson may have been the first African American in Freeport to run for this position. He rallied African American support for a war memorial library in Freeport in 1923.\n\nRobinson pushed for the creation of a community center within Bennington Park. His idea received broad support during a 1923 meeting of the Long Island Colored Citizens Union. Those speaking in favor of such a center included: Mayor Hilbert Johnson, former mayor James Hanse, Father J. L. O'Toole of Our Holy Redeemer Church, Rabbi Joseph Sarachek of B'nai Israel, and assemblyman Henri Shields.\n\nSee Also:\n\nBennington Park\n\nHanse, James\n\nTrojan Civic League\n\nSources:\n\n\"Charged with Libel.\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

She became Freeport’s first librarian in 1908 when the public library was located in the Grove Street School.\n\nBorn in New York City, Rogan attended Columbia University, where she graduated from the university's library school. She was credited with the creation of a children's section within the library.\n\nIt was reported that Rogan traveled in Europe and visited the homes of famous authors. Rogan's interest in nonfiction led to Freeport's reputation of having one of the finest nonfiction collections in New York State. In 1930, Rogan arranged a meeting at the Freeport Elks Club of the Library Institute of Nassau and Suffolk Counties to discuss the topic of vandalism in public and school libraries .\n\nFor many years, Rogan lived at 184 South Long Beach Avenue.\n\nShe retired in 1938 after 30 years of service and a testimonial farewell took place in the library.

Organization of Freeport's Rotary Club was sponsored by the Hempstead-Garden City Rotary Club. Freeport's club had 19 charter members and its first officers included: W. Sargeant Nixon, president; George H. Gray, vice president; John R. Willets, secretary; and Harry H. Elliott, treasurer. Committee chairmen included: Dr. Edwin H. White, classification; A. F. Bassett, membership; Fred Wood, music; Martin H. Weyrauch, by-laws; Charles P. Shinn, Jr., program; and Horace F. Carpenter, war objectives. The Rotary Club received its charter on November 27, 1943 from Walter G. Seely, district governor of the 174th Rotary district. Originally, the Rotary Club met weekly at the Freeport Elks Club headquarters.\n\nThe mission of the Rotary Club is to \"provide service to others, promote integrity, and advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace through our fellowship of business, professional, and community leaders.\" During World War II, the Rotary sent letters to over 200 Freeport servicemen on active duty. In September 1944, the Rotary Club of Freeport conducted a \"Work Pile\" survey. The purpose of this survey was to determine the local economic impact by asking the residents of Freeport what goods and services they proposed to purchase after the war.\n\nIn an effort to expand its membership, the Rotary Club of Freeport expanded its charter to include Merrick. On July 8, 2008, the club was renamed the Freeport-Merrick Rotary Club. In recent years, the Rotary has worked closely with The Gift of Life International, Inc. to help children get life saving heart surgeries, as well as Feed the Children to end childhood hunger. Locally, the Freeport-Merrick Rotary donated lockers and desks to the Freeport School District and provided free turkeys for the needy at Thanksgiving.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Freeport Rotarians Win Praise on First Birthday.

In 1899, she worked with the famous comedy team of Weber and Fields. She also collaborated with Freeporter, John Stromberg. She later campaigned for Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Warren G. Harding in 1920, and sold war bonds during WWI. Russell also helped negotiate a settlement for the first Actors Equity strike in 1919 and worked for women's suffrage.\n\nRussell did not live in Freeport but, in 1902, she, her companion Jesse Lewisohn, and their chauffeur Theodore Weinman were caught in a speed trap set up along Merrick Road. The chauffeur was arrested and fined $15 for traveling over the eight mile-an-hour speed limit. Unhappy with the arrest, Russell famously referred to the Freeport authorities as \"pig headed ignoramuses.\"\n\nVillage officials did not hold a grudge towards Russell or her companion. In the Freeport development known as Russell Park, the Village immortalized the pair in street names - Jesse Street, Russell Street (Russell Street was later moved from northeast Freeport to a street between Pennsylvania Avenue and Long Beach Avenue which was renamed Russell Place), Lillian Avenue, and Leonard Avenue (Russell's real last name).\n\nFreeport Hose Company 5 was originally named Russell Hose Company No. 2, in honor of Lillian Russell.\n\nSee Also:\n\nRussell Place\n\nRussell Street\n\nSources:\n\nBermudez, Miguel and Donald Giordano.

Stulz on the former farm of John A. Smith located on Main Street near the boundary between Freeport and Roosevelt. Leonard Avenue and Lillian Avenue are part of this section.\n\nThe development was named for actress, Lillian Russell.\n\nAdvertisements in 1903 for Russell Park promoted building lots that were measured at 25 x 125 feet and 25 x 150 feet. These properties claimed to have \"all city improvements,\" which included shade trees, piped water, electric lights, and \"no swamps.\" Land in this development sold from $69 to $169 with $5 down and 50 months to pay off the balance. Charles A. Sigmond was listed as the agent for this development.\n\nIn 1909, Russell Park resident E. V. Baldwin sought an injunction against Catherine Stearn and her brother, Oscar Dooling, in an attempt to keep them from relocating two to three structures from Bennington Park to Russell Park. Stearn and Dooling purchased the houses from the City of New York. The city needed the structures to be moved in order to lay a pipe to increase water supply to Brooklyn. Building restrictions in Russell Park called for buildings to cost not less than $1,500 and be at least two stories high. The houses in question were purchased for $25 and were only one and a half stories high. Eventually, Stearn and Dooling were allowed to move the structures to Russell Park and the adjacent Stromberg Park. In January 1910, a fire destroyed one of the houses. The following March, another fire destroyed a second property that was the subject of the injunction.\n\nClick here for a map of Russell Park.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Baldwin Objects to Old Buildings.
