        "text": "Sometimes things just make sense, like Anthony DeCurtis writing the definitive biography of Lou Reed. DeCurtis, who has been an editor at Rolling Stone and New York Times contributor, has been part of the New York music journalism scene since the ‘80s. Lou Reed is certainly one of the most important and greatest artists to ever come from New York.\n\nDeCurtis knew Reed for decades, first as a fan, then as an interview subject and friend. And now, four years after Reed’s passing, DeCurtis is telling the complete story of Reed in a superb and critically acclaimed biography, Lou Reed: A Life.\n\nTelling the story of Lou Reed, from his early days through changing the face of modern music with the Velvet Underground through his famously sometimes curmudgeonly days as a solo artist, is not an easy task. As DeCurtis says in an understatement, “It’s a complicated story.”\n\nBut DeCurtis does it in the best way possible, honestly. As he admits, “There is no question if I had written this book while Lou was alive he never would have spoken to me again.” The book is an honest look at Reed, sometimes to the point of being uncomfortable. At the end though there is no doubt of the admiration and affection DeCurtis felt for his friend.\n\nI spoke with DeCurtis about Lou Reed. It is a conversation as intriguing and compelling as both the book and its brilliant subject.\n\nSteve Baltin: One of the reasons people are responding so well to the book is it is a complete portrait of a three-dimensional person, not a fawning look.\n\nAnthony DeCurtis: That’s absolutely what I set out to do. I really feel like, all too often, Lou is represented in a kind of cartoonish way, for good and bad. There’s a perception of him as a monster and there’s also this perception of him as this kind of untouchable artist. And finding a way to put his feet on the ground and perceive him in three-dimensional terms was the goal. And I think it’s like what anybody’s life is like really. Obviously not all of us are geniuses and not all of us also went out as far on the ledge as Lou did. But those kinds of complexities I think exist in all people and that’s what I set out to portray.\n\nBaltin: Did you set out to tell Lou’s story this way or did the writing dictate that direction?\n\nDeCurtis: Both, when the possibility of doing it arose I thought, “That would be a good subject.” I knew him fairly well, obviously I followed his work since the Velvet Underground, it was very important to me, I held him as an artist in the highest regard. On the other hand, like so many people out there, I was intrigued by the darker side of him. I find myself, in even talking about him, not exactly contradicting myself, but talking about the different aspects of him. There was a really conventional aspect to Lou Reed. One of my favorite quotes in the book is his college girlfriend, after talking about the difficulty of being Lou Reed’s college girlfriend, at the same time said, “Lou was the first person I ever met that carried himself like an artist.” And also she said, “To this day, Lou is the only boyfriend I ever had who on Valentine’s Day gave me a big heart-shaped box of chocolates.” He married his second wife on Valentine’ Day.\n\nBaltin: Did this change the way you hear his music or were there songs in particular you got a new appreciation for?\n\nDeCurtis: Yeah, a song like “Coney Island Baby” certainly really deepened for me when I learned how profound his relationship with Rachel [the transsexual he had an affair with in the ‘70s] was. I was just talking about the conventionality of Lou’s life, but here he is in the ‘70s living for three or four years living with a transgender woman, that would be, for a major rock star, shocking today. Sometimes Rachel was referred to he and sometimes as she. At that time people were still sorting out, and in many ways are still sorting out what transgender means. So on Street Hassle, on “Coney Island Baby,” for a male singer on a major release on a major label to just un-ironically and deeply sincerely sing a line like that is really pretty stunning. I knew that, I bought that record when it came out and listened to it a lot. But somehow living with Lou Reed for three years while writing this book, when I hear it now, it has a really powerful impact. Or a song like “Kill Your Sons,” Lou’s invention of his father, in many ways, he never forgave his family, his parents for electro-shock therapy. He was acting out, all kinds of drugs and bad behavior and certainly homosexuality was part of it. But Lou presented his dad as a kind of monster. But, in fact, Sidney Reed was just a very conventional guy; a middle-class, Jewish accountant who was quite successful and who would have liked a son that took over his business. And I think was mystified by who his son turned out to be. And he got advice from doctors on how to treat that and felt he made the best decision he could. I think Lou’s mother was guilty about the electro-shock treatment for the rest of her life. And the complexity of that relationship, Lou’s need to create his father as a figure to rebel against, I think was identity building for him. Somebody told me a story, I couldn’t confirm it, that when Lou quit the Velvet Underground, that night at Max’s Kansas City, they did a show and then he just said, “Oh, by the way, I’m leaving the band,” that Sid was waiting in the car outside the club to drive him back to Long Island. I don’t know 100 percent that’s true, it certainly could have been true. Lou immediately moved back out there whether they chauffeured him there or not. It’s pretty amazing, the kind of richness and depth these contradictions [have].\n\nBaltin; It does seem to be heightened from other artists though. So do you think the art was so great because the extremes were so great?\n\nDeCurtis: In his case what separates him from other artists is perhaps the extremes. I think that’s fair enough to say, but also his willingness to put it all out there. I never paid that much attention to a song like “Rock Minuet,” but when Julian Schnabel read the lyrics at Lou’s memorial service at the Apollo I was like, “Wow, I have to really take a closer look at this.” There aren’t many rock songs that address themes like that. Or talking to Suzanne Vega, she described a boy taking her on a date when she was a college student to see Lou Reed, who she vaguely knew about, in the late ‘70s. When he sings “Caroline Says,” Suzanne says, “I never knew you could say something like that on the stage.” I think that’s what separates Lou. We all have elements of these kinds of things in us, Lou wrote about them and put them out there.\n\nBaltin: Were there moments in doing this where you were torn between wanting to include something but I don’t want to include this for fear of shattering the myth of Lou?\n\nDeCurtis: There is no question if I had written this book while Lou was alive he never would have spoken to me again. There’s no doubt about that. There are things in this book that would have made his skin crawl, even if they were true. Maybe especially because they were true. I felt like Lou deserved a biography like this, one that was three-dimensional. Lou finally saw himself as a writer. There was a line that Mick Rock told me David Bowie said about him. He said, “Mick sees me the way I see myself.” And I think one of the reasons Lou liked me was because when he read things I wrote about him I saw him the way he saw himself, as a writer and as a great artist. Lou’s story is a complicated story. But, as an artist, I think he deserved it and I think on some level would understand that."
