        "text": "When Reed started out in the late 1960s with The Velvet Underground, the band was so ahead of its time their music was derided. It was thanks to the album artwork by Andy Warhol that the experimental group got any recognition.\n\nThey may not have had mass appeal, but Reed and Welshman John Cale inspired many of their cult following to form bands.\n\nDavid Bowie once described Reed as his all-time hero. Others who credit his influence include The Jesus and Mary Chain, REM and U2.\n\nHis passing was announced with a cryptic note on his Twitter and Facebook pages, possibly posted by himself, saying simply: \"The Door.\"\n\nIggy Pop said Reed's death was \"devastating news\".\n\nThe Who said: \"R.I.P. Lou Reed. Walk on the peaceful side.\"\n\nAnd author Irvine Welsh tweeted: \"I really doubt that there would have been Trainspotting without Lou Reed.\"\n\nBisexual Reed, born in Brooklyn, always played down his musical talents .\n\nHe once joked: \"One chord is fine. Two chords are pushing it. Three chords and you're into jazz.\"\n\nReed leaves a widow, performance artist Laurie Anderson, 66, whom he married five years ago."
