        "text": "St. Ann’s Warehouse, WNYC, And Brooklyn Bridge Park Present Rhapsody For This Land: The American Odyssey In Music, A Free Concert Under The Brooklyn Bridge, Anchored By Lara Downes’ Timely New Version Of Gershwin’s Rhapsody In Blue, July 27\n\nMarking the Centennials of Both Rhapsody in Blue and WNYC, Concert in Brooklyn Bridge Park Offers a Program of American Music Reflecting the “Musical Kaleidoscope” of Gershwin’s Groundbreaking 1924 Composition\n\nCurated By Downes, Concert Features Rosanne Cash, Christian McBride, Arturo O’Farrill, Time for Three, and Orchestra Elena, Conducted by Aram Demirjian\n\nWNYC to Broadcast Rhapsody For This Land Live on 93.9 FM, AM 820, and www.wnyc.org\n\nSt. Ann’s Warehouse, WNYC, and Brooklyn Bridge Park present Rhapsody for This Land: The American Odyssey in Music, a free, outdoor concert in celebrating the 100th anniversary of Gershwin’s exuberant American anthem Rhapsody in Blue, July 27 at 6pm. Situated beneath the iconic Brooklyn Bridge, in the newly opened Emily Warren Roebling Plaza adjacent to St. Ann’s Warehouse, the concert features iconoclastic classical pianist and host of NPR’s AMPLIFY Lara Downes, performing the New York City premiere of her take on Gershwin’s innovative 1924 work, in a radical new arrangement by the young Puerto Rican composer Edmar Colón. Considering American music through a century of immigration and transformation, Rhapsody for This Land features an array of leading artists in a program spanning genres and generations. WNYC, New York’s public radio station, will broadcast the concert live as part of its own Centennial celebration, extending the reach to listeners on-air and online. The large-scale public gathering foreshadows a high-stakes election season. Headcount, a non-partisan organization that channels the power of music to promote participation in democracy, will register voters at the event. Karen Brooks Hopkins joins St. Ann’s and WNYC as executive producer. Major support has been provided by The Robert W. Wilson Charitable Trust.\n\nThe concert, curated by Downes, will feature guest artists including four-time Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash, eight-time Grammy-winning bassist and composer Christian McBride, eight-time Grammy-winning pianist, composer, educator, and Afro Latin Jazz Alliance founder Arturo O’Farrill, and string trio Time for Three, winners of the 2023 Grammy Award for Best Classical Instrumental Solo. Orchestra Elena, a diverse ensemble of young NYC musicians, will be led by conductor Aram Demirjian. The concert will also feature music by Leonard Bernstein, Duke Ellington, Nina Simone, Arturo O’Farrill, and others celebrating the long history of hope, protest, and change as expressed through American music.\n\nGershwin famously described Rhapsody in Blue—which bridged jazz and classical vocabularies with echoes of music from immigrant communities throughout New York—as a “musical kaleidoscope of America.” Downes, “who’s carved out an expansive niche by kicking down outdated and nonsensical orthodoxies that long excluded Black and other marginalized composers from the concert hall canon” (San Francisco Chronicle) collaborated with Puerto Rican composer Colón to reimagine the work in an arrangement that reverberates with the multicultural sounds of America in our own time. Caribbean instruments and rhythms evoke Downes’ and Colón’s own lineages, while influences from Central and South America, Asia, the Middle East and all the corners of the globe emerge into and grow Gershwin’s soundscape. Their adventurous collaboration was released on the Pentatone label in February 2024, to national critical acclaim. It will also be featured on Downes’ forthcoming new album This Land, to be released in August.\n\nIn a discussion about Rhapsody in Blue, which premiered in New York in 1924 three months before the anti-immigration Johnson-Reed Act (which included the Asian Exclusion and National Origins Acts) passed, Downes told NPR, “I don't hear Rhapsody in Blue anymore as just a piece of entertainment… I think it's a little bit of an act of rebellion, or at the very least, it's a statement about what America should be and what that sounds like.\"\n\nIn 2022, as the city emerged from the pandemic, St. Ann’s Warehouse (in association with Karen Brooks Hopkins) presented Fandango at the Wall featuring Arturo O’Farrill with his Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra and a full roster of guest artists. The outdoor concert celebrated the experience of uniting musicians from both sides of the border wall in San Diego. Over 5,000 people from all over Brooklyn and beyond attended the free event, with the Statue of Liberty aglow as a backdrop and the Brooklyn Bridge towering above. Rhapsody for This Land furthers St. Ann’s vision of this only-in-New York experience, and amplifies the musical message that we are all one America.\n\nHeadcount volunteers will provide tables where audience members can register to vote as they enter and exit the concert.\n\nLara Downes says, “It’s such a critical time to come together as citizens, and for me, the most solid, fertile common ground we can find is where we meet through American music. This concert is a celebration of the past, the present and the future: bringing Gershwin’s Rhapsodyhome to Brooklyn for a joyful centennial salute, exploring what he called the ‘musical kaleidoscope of America’ with my musician friends who come from so many different backgrounds and traditions, lifting spirits and raising every voice as we rejoice in the melting pot of this extraordinary city. I can’t wait to spend a beautiful day together in the park, and to send our music out to hundreds of thousands of listeners across the country and around the world through the magic of live radio.”\n\n“I’m thrilled to host this extraordinary concert that honors the Centennial anniversaries of both WNYC and Rhapsody in Blue through performances by such a phenomenal group of artists,” said Alison Stewart, Host of WNYC’s All of It. “Bringing people together and creating shared experiences has been at the core of WNYC’s mission for 100 years. We’re thrilled to partner with St. Ann’s Warehouse to bring this magical exploration of the American musical tradition to audiences everywhere - in the park, on air, and online.”\n\nSt. Ann’s Warehouse Artistic Director Susan Feldman says, “To present live music in view of the Bridge is a thrill and a privilege. And even more so co-presenting with Brooklyn Bridge Park, WNYC, and Karen Brooks Hopkins.”\n\nKaren Brooks Hopkins says, “When Lara Downes told me about her concept for a reimagined Rhapsody in Blue that would reflect the diversity of America today, I knew it had to be played in Brooklyn, the birthplace of its incomparable composer, George Gershwin. We then joined forces with the amazing team at St Ann’s Warehouse and developed the idea into a full concert experience that will be performed in the perfect setting: the iconic Brooklyn Bridge Park. We are deeply grateful to our tremendous group of donors, led by The Robert W. Wilson Charitable Trust, and our partners, WNYC and Headcount, for making this special event a reality for Brooklyn and all of New York City.”\n\nAbout Lara Downes\n\nHonored as 2022 Classical Woman of the Year by Performance Today, American pianist (and NY Times crossword glue) Lara Downes has been called \"a musical ray of hope\" by NBC News and \"an explorer whose imagination is fired by bringing notice to the underrepresented and forgotten\" (The Log Journal).
