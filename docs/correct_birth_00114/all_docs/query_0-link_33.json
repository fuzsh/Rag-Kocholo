        "text": "Turns out legendary rocker and punk poet Lou Reed was really a family man at heart.\n\nThe “Walk on the Wild Side” crooner left a multimillion-dollar fortune to his wife, only sister and elderly mother, according to his will that was filed in Manhattan Surrogate’s Court Monday.\n\nIn a personal obituary published in the East Hampton Star — where the rocker lived part-time — Reed’s spouse, the performance artist Laurie Anderson, signed off his “loving wife and eternal friend.”\n\nAnderson, 66, now has money to last an eternity.\n\nReed left her their $1.5 million, three-bedroom Hamptons pad, their West 11th Street apartment, all of his personal property including jewelry, clothing, art, cars and boats, his touring company Sister Ray Enterprises, plus 75 percent of his estate.\n\nReed gave his only sibling, younger sister Margaret Reed Weiner, 66, of Merrick, Long Island, the other 25 percent of his fortune.\n\nOnce Anderson dies the money will transfer entirely to Margaret and her three children, all of whom live in Brooklyn and Manhattan.\n\n“It all stays in the family,” said the rocker’s attorney, James Purdy in an interview with the Post.\n\nThe Velvet Underground songwriter, born in Brooklyn, rebelled against his Long Island suburban upbringing and railed against his parents in his song “Kill Your Sons” for subjecting him to electroshock therapy as a teen in an effort to “cure” his bisexuality.\n\nHe seems to have forgiven their sins with a $500,000 bequest to his sister for the care of his surviving parent — mom Toby, 93, a beauty queen turned housewife who also lives in Nassau County.\n\n“It is my hope and desire, without imposing any legal obligation, that my said sister will use a portion of this cash bequest to help care for our mother, Toby Reed, for the balance of her life,” Reed wrote in his will.\n\nReed, who died of liver disease at age 71 last month after having undergone a liver transplant, named his longtime business manager and accountant, Robert Gotterer and David Gotterer as trustees of his estate.\n\nThe Andy Warhol protege entrusted the two, who he called “friends” in the 34-page will signed in April 2012, with protecting his musical interests.\n\nThe Gotterers are directed to collect royalties, negotiate contracts, secure copyrights and licenses in the will.\n\n“David has been his business manager since the 1970s so it very much makes sense,” Purdy explained.\n\nReed’s dying wish was that his manager and accountant should treat his rights as if they were “their own.”\n\nSince his Oct. 27 death, Reed’s music-publishing company has been inundated with requests for his work from TV producers and advertisers.\n\n“Walk on the Wild Side” and “Perfect Day” were two of the most in-demand songs."
