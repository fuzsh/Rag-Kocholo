        "text": "Lou Reed’s cool lives on.\n\nTV producers and advertisers are inundating Sony/ATV, Reed’s music-publishing company, in an attempt to get their hands on some of the late singer’s work.\n\n“Walk on the Wild Side” and “Perfect Day” are two of the in-demand songs, sources said.\n\nSony/ATV holds the publishing rights to all of Reed’s work, which has been shooting up the iTunes charts and dominating Spotify streams in the days since his death at 71 on Sunday.\n\nSony’s Playstation 4, the gaming console, released a promotional video featuring the iconic “Perfect Day” just two weeks ago.\n\nSony/ATV declined to comment on any demand for Reed songs.\n\nSeparately, shortly before his death, Reed agreed to be photographed for a magazine shoot in a brand of sunglasses he helped create.\n\nDaniel Silberman, the founder of the sunglass company, Illesteva, called Reed one of the more famous sunglass-wearers and someone who was really involved in designing the specs.\n\nThe shoot sees him posing for a series of sophisticated photos plus a ghoulish image of the punk hero wearing Halloween fangs.\n\nReed, known for wearing sunglasses on stage, got involved in designing lines for specific professions.\n\nSales of the Brooklyn native’s music are taking off, too. The artist was signed at different periods to\n\nSony’s RCA and Warner Music. The day after his passing, Reed’s “Transformer” album, co-produced with David Bowie, shot to No. 13 on the iTunes chart."
