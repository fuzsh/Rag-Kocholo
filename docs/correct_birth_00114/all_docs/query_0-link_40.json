The setlist features classic tracks from the Velvet Underground albums, through his classic “Transformer” and up to his then latest release “Legendary Hearts”. For Reed, born in Brooklyn and whose career began in Greenwich Village, this was a homecoming concert played before a packed audience and he delivered an outstanding performance."
