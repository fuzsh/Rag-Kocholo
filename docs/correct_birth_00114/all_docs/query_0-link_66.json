        "text": "Richard Lewis, the comedian and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" star who died Tuesday at age 76, was raised in North Jersey.\n\nBut his style, said John Schreiber, president and CEO of Newark's NJPAC, was quintessentially New York.\n\n\"He always dressed in black, at least when I knew him,\" said Schreiber, who worked with Lewis for years as part of the Toyota Comedy Festival in New York.\n\n\"I remember asking him: do you ever not wear black?\" Schreiber said. \"And he showed me a picture of his closet. There were a dozen outfits — all black. That's a memory I haven't forgotten about.\"\n\nJersey boy\n\nLewis, who grew up in Englewood and graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in 1965, \"passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles last night after suffering a heart attack,\" the actor's publicist, Jeff Abraham, confirmed to USA TODAY on Wednesday in an emailed statement.\n\nLast April, Lewis revealed on social media that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and had also undergone multiple surgeries for other issues over the last three years.\n\n\"I've had sort of a rocky time,\" he said, revealing he'd undergone back surgery, shoulder surgery, shoulder replacement surgery and hip replacement surgery.\n\nA regular on HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" since 2000, playing a semi-fictionalized version of himself, he can be seen on the most recent, and final, season of the HBO comedy alongside Larry David and co-stars Ted Danson, Vince Vaughn and Cheryl Hines.\n\nIt was with Larry David — born three days apart from Lewis, in the same place, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital — that Lewis really shone, Schreiber said.\n\n\"So much of 'Curb' is improv, unwritten,\" he said. \"Just to watch Larry David and Jeff Garlin and Richard play off each other, obviously having a good time and inventing comedy on the spot, is a function of how creative he was, and how intuitive. I believe he was a unique talent.\"\n\nThough on the New Jersey Hall of Fame \"master list,\" Lewis has not yet been inducted, said President Steve Edwards. The board is not yet speaking publicly about any plans for that.\n\nBut Lewis is without question a local hero, Edwards said.\n\n\"He was a special talent who entertained his audiences for more than five decades,\" Edwards said. \"He will be missed, but never forgotten by his home state.\"\n\nMore: Larry David remembers late 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' co-star Richard Lewis: 'He's been like a brother'\n\nBergen memories\n\nLewis was born in Brooklyn but raised in Bergen County, and his family had ties to the area: His father, Bill, co-owned a business in Teaneck, Ambassador Caterers; his mother, Blanche, worked in community theater.\n\nAt Dwight Morrow, Lewis was known as a class clown and a bit of a troublemaker. In later years, he recalled his Jersey days fondly.\n\n\"We didn’t need Coney Island, because we had Palisades Amusement Park,\" he told New Jersey Monthly in 2010. \"When I got to be about 10 years old, I would walk down the hill from my house and take the bus to Cliffside Park that would stop right in front of the amusement park. I must have done that hundreds of times in my childhood. The roller coaster was my favorite. That and the Wild Mouse. I would go on them over and over and over. It didn’t matter that I was nauseated for, like, 30 days. I was under the spell.\"\n\nHe got his start on the standup circuit in 1971, was discovered by David Brenner, and eventually wound up on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\" That propelled him to fame across several media: He co-starred with Jamie Lee Curtis in the sitcom \"Anything But Love\" and played Prince John in the Mel Brooks film \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" (1993).\n\nThe man in black\n\nBut the all-in-black persona and his routines focusing on his own neuroses and personal problems were all of a piece, Schreiber said. Lewis was the classic New York hipster. For the beats of the '50s, for rebel rockers like Lou Reed, for Lewis, black was de rigueur.\n\n\"When one thinks of these really cool, hip poets, and comics and folks whose personas inform their creative output, it's enhanced by the look,\" Schreiber said. \"That hipness and coolness was part of [Lewis'] comic personality. He looked cool, and he sounded cool, and he was hilarious. That was a pretty good combo platter.\"\n\nBut one trait Lewis did not share was the famed New York arrogance, Larry David has said.\n\n\"He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest,” David told NBC News. \"But today he made me sob, and for that I’ll never forgive him.”\n\nSchreiber remembers him the same way.\n\n\"He was never arrogant,\" Schreiber said. \"He was never standoffish. He was a good human being. He didn't let his image get in the way of his humanity.\"\n\nThis story contains material from USA TODAY."
