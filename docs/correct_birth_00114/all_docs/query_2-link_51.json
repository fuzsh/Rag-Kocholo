        "text": "Lou Reed is a famous rock musician and is the lead singer and co-creator of the band, ‘Velvet Underground’. He is credited for creating some of the most inspirational songs during the punk-rock age and is also known for enriching the lexis of the electric guitar and is credited with coining the term, ‘Ostrich Guitar’. His band, faced tremendous commercial failure in its initial days, but it soon earned a long-standing reputation as one of the most influential rock bands in history. In the band’s heydays, Reed gathered a considerable cult following, owing to his theatrical antics and the ability to multitask as a vocalist and guitarist while on stage. As the principal songsmith of the band, the lyrics of most of the songs are primarily based on his personal experiences pertaining to personal tragedies, psychedelic moments, drugs and sex. After his break up from the group, his solo career failed to receive the commercial success that he had hoped to have, despite releasing 16 albums including ‘Transformer’, ‘Sally Can’t Dance’, ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Animal’ and ‘Berlin’ and a couple of hit singles like ‘Walk on the Wild Side’.
