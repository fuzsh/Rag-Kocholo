        "text": "Ukraine’s parliamentary human rights commissioner said the “vast majority” of Ukrainian prisoners who have been returned to the country in exchanges with Russia said they had no communication with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while they were being held.\n\n“I want to emphasize that, while talking to our defenders who were returned from enemy captivity, I learned that the vast majority of them had not seen or communicated with representatives of the ICRC for the entire time of their detention,” Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service on July 20.\n\nLubinets was responding to recent comments by ICRC Russian delegation head Boris Michel, who told Russian media that ICRC staff had visited “3,100 prisoners in Russia and Ukraine.”\n\nMichel did not specify how many visits were conducted in each country, Lubinets added.\n\n“The reason for this is that almost all the visits in this number were to Russian prisoners of war held by Ukraine, because our country steadfastly abides by the requirements of the Geneva Conventions,” he said.\n\nLubinets criticized the ICRC for calling on “both sides” to provide access to prisoners without acknowledging Russia’s “practice of not allowing ICRC workers access to the places where Ukrainian defenders are held.”\n\nHe urged the ICRC to “operate with true numbers” in order not to mislead the public or the relatives of Ukrainian prisoners.\n\nIn comments quoted by Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency, Michel said he was engaged in “productive dialogue” with Russian officials regarding visits to prisoners.\n\nOn July 17, some 95 Ukrainian prisoners were released in the latest exchange with Russia. It was the 54th such exchange since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, resulting in the release of 3,405 Ukrainian prisoners of war.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors have opened more than 450 criminal cases on suspicion of the mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners by Russia.\n\nBelarus and Germany are holding \"consultations\" over the fate of a German man reportedly sentenced to death by a court in Minsk last month, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said on July 20.\n\n\"There were, of course, contacts with the German side on this topic. This criminal is a German citizen, and we understand the German side's concern for him,” said Anatoly Glaz, spokesman for the Belarusian Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe Belarusian side has proposed “concrete solutions on the available options,” Glaz said, adding that consultations were being conducted by the foreign ministries of the two countries.\n\nBelarus has provided consular access to the individual “in full compliance with international norms and bilateral agreements,” the spokesman said.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry confirmed on July 19 that a German national has been sentenced to death in Belarus and said Berlin was in intensive contact with authorities in Minsk over his fate.\n\nThe German ministry did not identify the man, but earlier on July 19 the Minsk-based Vyasna human rights group said the man sentenced to death was Rico Krieger. Vyasna said Krieger, 30, was taken into custody in November 2023, went on trial on June 6, and was sentenced on June 24 by the Minsk regional court.\n\nThe human rights group said it was the first trial in Belarus for \"mercenary activity.\"\n\nIt said Krieger had been charged additionally with terrorism, creating an extremist group, intentionally damaging a vehicle, and illegal operations with firearms and explosives.\n\nVyasna said the charges were connected to the Kalinouski Regiment, a group of anti-government Belarusian exiles fighting for Ukraine. The Kalinouski Regiment denies any connection to the case.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry said on July 19 that it and the German Embassy in Minsk were giving \"the person in question consular support and...working intensively with Belarusian authorities on his behalf.\n\nHuman rights activist Leanid Sudalenka told RFE/RL that he believed the death penalty sentence was not accidental and that Belarusian authorities are counting on using the case to bargain with Germany, noting the lack of a death penalty there.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry statement said Berlin considered the death penalty \"a cruel and inhuman form of punishment\" and that Germany rejected it in all circumstances.\n\nBelarus is the only European country that continues to use the death penalty.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nResidents of the Russian city of Krasnodar on July 20 staged a rare public protest to vent their anger over recent power cuts affecting southern Russia.\n\nAn estimated 200 to 300 people turned out for the protest to demand that the authorities resume the supply of electricity and water. They blocked a street in the north of the city as they voiced complaints about the cuts to services, which they said are becoming more frequent, Russian online media reported.\n\nThe protesters said that this summer their lights initially were turned off once a week, then three times a week, and now there is no electricity for 12-15 hours a day, the Baza Telegram channel reported.\n\nPeople demand that they be given electricity for at least three hours, the online publication 93.RU reported.\n\nPublic protests are rare in Russia given the risk of arrest and detention and in light of a clampdown on dissent since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe protest in Krasnodar appeared to have been peaceful, though there were reports of two arrests.\n\nKrasnodar Mayor Yevgeny Naumov, police officers, and members of the National Guard were at the scene, according to Russian media reports. The authorities promised to ensure the supply of water.\n\nAuthorities in the Krasnodar region earlier this week said the electricity blackouts were necessary due to restrictions on the supply of electricity from other regions and a heat wave in southern Russia.\n\nExtreme temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius and a decrease in the flow of power to the region have meant “the equipment of the unified power system is under significant loads, especially in the daytime,” Krasnodar’s Ministry for Energy and Public Utilities said in a statement quoted by Interfax on July 17.\n\n\"There has been abnormal heat in the Krasnodar region for a week now. The load on the energy system is colossal. I know and understand all the indignation of residents due to power outages,\" regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram.\n\nThe system operator said on July 16 that the energy system of the south of Russia set a power consumption record.\n\nThe following day, Russia's nuclear energy operator, Rosenergoatom, said a unit of the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant was switched off. The shutdown left some 1 million people in southern Russia and parts of occupied Crimea without electricity.\n\nRosenergoatom later said the shutdown was due to a \"false alarm” but did not elaborate on the cause. The unit has been put back into operation.\n\nThe Rostov Nuclear Power Plant, also known as the Volgodonsk Nuclear Power Plant, has four units with a total capacity of more than 4,000 megawatts. The plant is located on the left bank of the Don River near the city of Volgodonsk, some 1,100 kilometers south of Moscow.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine, whose energy infrastructure has been relentlessly pummeled by Russian strikes since the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion, has in turn resorted to targeting Russian energy facilities, mainly oil refineries and those that work for the Russian military.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and Interfax\n\nThousands of demonstrators in northwest Pakistan are participating in a sit-in protest after authorities fired on participants of a “peace march” in the Bannu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province on July 19.\n\nLeaders of the rally told RFE/RL’s Radio Mashaal that the Pakistani military fired on participants of the peace march, held as the region has experienced a spike in militant attacks.\n\nDoctors at the Bannu district hospital said that they had received one dead body and 27 injured people following the march.\n\nThe military has so far not commented on allegations that it was responsible for the violence.\n\nThe Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government, which has shut down mobile and Internet services in the Bannu district amid the unrest, on July 20 announced the formation of an investigative commission to look into the incident.\n\nNasir Bangash, a leader of the sit-in protest, told RFE/RL that the sit-in will continue until the government provides assurances that peace in the restive province can be restored.\n\nAmnesty International sharply criticized the authorities’ use of violence to break up the march, saying that the “use of lethal force at a peaceful rally advocating for peace is unlawful” and calling for a prompt investigation to “hold to account officials responsible for the attack.”\n\nThe rights watchdog further said that restrictions on mobile and Internet services in Bannu “curtail the people’s ability to mobilize” and also “increase the spread of misinformation during emergencies and create panic.”\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has also urged the government to “hold to account those responsible for protesters' deaths and injuries.”\n\n“This seemingly state-sanctioned violation of citizens' right to life and right to freedom of peaceful assembly is reprehensible and reflects a dangerous contempt for citizen-led calls for peace,” HRCP said in a statement on X on July 19.\n\nThe provincial assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa denounced the violence against “peaceful protesters” in a session held late on July 19, as demonstrations spread to other cities in the province, including the regional capital, Peshawar.\n\nLeaders of Pashtun nationalist political parties have also condemned the violence used against protesters in the Bannu district.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Province has seen an increase in deadly attacks in the past two years, mostly blamed on Islamist extremist groups, including the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan and affiliates of the extremist group Islamic State.\n\nA number of deadly incidents have taken place in recent months, leading to reports that the military is considering an operation to turn the tide of rising terrorism.\n\nWhile residents of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province have complained that Islamabad is not doing enough to provide security, they have also expressed fears of a large-scale operation.\n\nPakistani security forces have recently said they have conducted targeted operations against militants in several parts of the province.\n\nOn July 15, eight Pakistani soldiers were killed when a militant rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the outer wall of a garrison in Bannu.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he spoke with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and agreed to a face-to-face meeting to discuss steps to a lasting peace with Russia.\n\nZelenskiy spoke with Trump on July 19, a day after the former U.S. president and again Republican candidate accepted his party’s nomination and vowed to end the war in Ukraine if elected.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n“I spoke with @realDonaldTrump to congratulate him on the Republican nomination and condemn the shocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. I wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,” Zelenskiy said in a post on X, referring to the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally that slightly injured the candidate.\n\nZelenskiy said he agreed with Trump “to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting” without giving any details on when and where such a meeting would take place.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social on July 19 that he had a “very good call” with Zelenskiy in which they discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump vowed to “bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives” through negotiations.\n\n\"Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed tens of thousands on both sides, is now in its 29th month with no end in sight. Russia currently occupies about 17 percent of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy’s call took place as worries grow in Kyiv and other European capitals about another four years of Trump in the White House. The Republican’s chances of winning the November 2024 election improved following 81-year-old incumbent President Joe Biden’s poor performance in a debate last month that raised questions about his physical and mental state.\n\nLawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King's College London, said there is interest in how Trump would sort out the war now that it appears \"as likely as not\" that he will win the election.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:34 0:00\n\nIn a post on the social media platform Substack, Freedman cited reports about a rudimentary plan drawn up by two members of the White House National Security Council during Trump's 2017-21 presidency that calls for a cease-fire based on prevailing battle lines.\n\nKeith Kellogg, who drew up the plan with Fred Fleitz, has said it would be crucial to get Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table quickly if Trump wins. According to a Reuters report in June, Kellogg has advocated telling the Ukrainians that if they don't come to the negotiating table, U.S. support would dry up, while telling Putin that if he didn't come to the table, the United States would give the Ukrainians \"everything they need to kill you in the field.\"\n\nNATO membership for Ukraine would be off the table as part of the incentive for Russia to come along; putting it back on would be punishment for holding back.\n\nBut Freedman, a distinguished military analyst, is skeptical of the plan, which would mark a major shift in the U.S. position on the war.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:44 0:00\n\n\"These coercive measures might possibly get the parties to the table, but it does not point to any actual agreed deal,\" Freedman said on Substack on July 20.\n\nThe Kremlin has said any peace plan proposed by a possible future Trump administration would have to reflect the reality on the ground but that Putin remained open to talks. Ukraine has rejected holding talks with the current battle lines as a starting point.\n\nTrump-Putin Relationship\n\nTrump has expressed admiration for authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin, called the Kremlin leader’s preinvasion tactics “genius,” and has repeatedly criticized NATO’s European allies for not spending more on collective defense.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the House of Representative who are closely aligned with Trump blocked Biden's $61 billion aid package for Ukraine for months, leaving Ukraine’s force short on ammunition and air defense. Ukraine’s ammunition hunger contributed to Russian territorial gains this year, experts have said.\n\nTrump has not made his opinion on future support to Ukraine clear, though this week he picked Senator J.D. Vance (Republican-Ohio), an outspoken opponent of aid to Kyiv, as his running mate. The 39-year-old senator has said the United States does not have the military capacity to support Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine and should prioritize the first two.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine maintains bipartisan support in Congress and any future U.S. president will have to take that into account.\n\n\"Any administration has to ask hard questions. If we stop, if we reverse ourselves, if we let Ukraine down, what will Putin do? He will then really resume the aggression and possibly have a chance of succeeding where for now he’s failed,\" Blinken said on July 19 at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.\n\nBlinken said Putin would be \"likely to go at other countries in the region, including NATO allies.\" He also said other would-be aggressors are \"taking lessons from this too.\"\n\nDuring his 92-minute-long acceptance speech on July 18, Trump said he would usher in global peace and stability if elected. He previously said he would “settle” the Ukraine war, should he win the election, before even setting foot in the White House in January 2025.\n\nHowever, Trump has not said what terms he would propose to Russia and Ukraine. Zelenskiy has said his goal is to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which the Kremlin seized in 2014. Following Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive in 2023, some experts say Ukraine’s objectives are unrealistic and that Kyiv will have to make concessions.\n\nBlinken noted that last week on the margins of the NATO summit in Washington more than 20 countries announced that they had negotiated and signed 10-year bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. All of these countries, including the United States, have committed to help Ukraine build up its defenses for the next decade, Blinken said.\n\nIf the United States were to renege on that, there are more than 20 other countries that would continue their support, he said.\n\nZelenskiy and Trump have a complicated relationship going back to the Ukrainian president’s first days in office.\n\nIn a July 2019 call, two months after the former comedian became Ukraine’s president, Trump asked Zelenskiy to look into the Ukrainian business dealings of Biden’s son Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump was charged by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives with using the power of his office to pressure Zelenskiy to interfere in U.S. politics in exchange for a White House visit, becoming the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. However, he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on July 19 said a proposed lithium-mining project in Serbia was \"an important European project\" that is also good for Serbia, despite opposition from environmental activists and opposition parties.\n\nScholz attended a Critical Raw Materials Summit in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nThe mining of lithium is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others,\" Scholz said after the signing ceremony.\n\nGermany is seeking to secure lithium for the manufacture of electric vehicles as the EU aims to reduce its dependence on imports from China of the critical substance used in batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nScholz and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic attended the summit in Belgrade three days after the Serbian government reinstated a plan for the lithium mine in the west of the country near Jadar operated by the Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto.\n\n\"I'm glad the decision was made,\" Scholz said, speaking at a joint news conference with Sefcovic and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. \"I admit, this decision required courage, but it was made at the right moment.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nAsked how Germany can guarantee environmental protection, Scholz said that he asked the president of Rio Tinto to respect all environmental standards during exploitation and said that he had received guarantees for this.\n\n\"The standards for protecting the climate, the environment, and biodiversity are high. That's why I spoke very early with the head of Rio Tinto,\" Scholz said.\n\nAs the summit took place, environmental activists opposed to lithium mining gathered near the venue in central Belgrade. One banner said the EU should \"leave lithium and democracy to the Serbian people.\"\n\nThe Serbian government rejected the project in 2022 after massive environmental protests, but on July 16 it reinstated the plan days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government of then-Prime Minister Ana Brnabic had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nScholz said that among the other reasons to support the project are that it will create new jobs in Serbia and help Europe meet its climate goals.\n\nSefcovic said that it was a historic day for both Serbia and the European Union.\n\n\"This will open the door for investments in Serbia. European companies will come and create jobs and create new economic growth,\" he said.\n\nSerbia will occupy a central place in the most important strategic value chains and will be the first country in Europe with the entire value chain once batteries are produced in Serbia, Sefcovic said.\n\nAccording to him, the first goal is to strengthen the Serbian economy with high-quality jobs throughout the supply chain.\n\nHe also said the memorandum of understanding and another signed agreement will further highlight the partnership between the EU and Serbia, which is a candidate for membership in the EU.\n\nVucic said he was proud of \"what we started today,\" calling the memorandum of understanding important for Europe and Germany, but most important for Serbia. \"This represents a turning point and a big change for us.\"\n\nHe said that lithium mining represented billions of dollars in direct foreign investment and Serbia should not miss this chance.\n\nHe added that Serbia did not hide the difficulties the government is facing in its support for the mining project but insisted that it was doing everything transparently.\n\n\"Never at any stage -- and there is a long way to the opening of the mine -- will we hide anything from our people,\" he added.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nThe homes of several Afghan migrants in the southern Iranian city of Khur have reportedly been set on fire in apparent retaliation for the killing of an Iranian man allegedly by an Afghan national.\n\nHosna, an Afghan who lives in Khur, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi on July 19 that he moved his family from Khur to Shiraz in Fars Province out of fear for their safety.\n\n\"People in the region are very angry and set homes of several Afghans on fire,\" he claimed.\n\nHosna and others who spoke to Radio Azadi attributed the anger to the July 3 killing of a 62-year-old restaurant owner in the town of Khenj by his 17-year-old apprentice. Iranian media have not identified the nationality of the suspected killer, but Hosna said the suspect was an Afghan citizen.\n\n\"The people of the region have sworn not to sell 1 kilogram of meat, or even a piece of bread, to Afghan nationals,\" Hosna said. \"So, many were forced to flee to Shiraz.\"\n\nAnti-Afghan sentiment in Iran has been on the rise in recent years, especially after a mass influx of migrants following the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.\n\nOccasionally, a hashtag that describes the expulsion of Afghan migrants as a \"national demand\" becomes a top trend on X, formerly Twitter, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nLast week, an unsubstantiated claim on social media blamed Afghan migrants for an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran.\n\nThe UN’s refugee agency says Iran hosts around 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to some 2.6 million undocumented Afghan migrants. But Iran claimed last year that the number of illegal Afghan immigrants was closer to 5 million.\n\nThe authorities have vowed to deport illegal refugees and hundreds of Afghan migrants are sent back to Afghanistan every day. They are also banned from living or working in half of Iran's 31 provinces.\n\nAfghans living in Iran have complained to Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:13 0:00\n\nTehran has for years maintained that it does not receive sufficient financial aid from international organizations to handle the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nSerbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on July 19 that police had killed the suspect in the fatal shooting of a police officer near the western border with Bosnia-Herzegovina after a massive manhunt that involved authorities in several countries.\n\nThe Serbian Interior Ministry's initial statement did not identify the dead suspect.\n\nBut officials had previously identified the man being sought for the killing of one policeman and the wounding of another as Faton Hajrizi, a recent prison escapee from Kosovo with multiple convictions, including for violent crimes.\n\n\"Police officers liquidated the killer of a policeman in the vicinity of Loznica,\" Dacic was quoted as saying in a police statement.\n\nDacic later specified to journalists that police had \"eliminated an Albanian terrorist\" in the vicinity of the village of Banja Koviljaca after he fired on police responding to a resident's report that a man who didn't speak Serbian had approached the resident asking for water.\n\n\"The police eliminated him. He had no intention of surrendering,\" Dacic said. \"This is a ruthless and hardened criminal, this is the fifth or sixth murder he has committed.\"\n\nHelicopters, drones, and at least 150 police officers had been scouring areas near the Drina River that marks the Serbian-Bosnian border, according to Serbian deputy police director Dragan Vasiljevic.\n\nSerbian police said they were working with law enforcement in the Serb-majority region of Republika Srpska, across the border in Bosnia. Vasiljevic said they had also established cooperation with central Bosnian and Croatian police, and with international institutions in Kosovo.\n\nKosovar authorities had issued a warrant for Hajrizi after his escape early this month from Smrekonica prison, a low-security facility.\n\nKosovo's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, the country's liaison office in Serbia, responded to the reports of the suspect's death by asking Serbian authorities to confirm the identity of the individual who was killed.\n\nSerbian authorities say the shooting occurred during a routine vehicle control at the Lipnicki Sor border checkpoint, near Loznica, early on July 18.\n\nThey say the suspect fired on two police officers as he got out of the vehicle, killing one and injuring the other, before fleeing the scene toward the nearby river.\n\nThe Interior Ministry had circulated a photograph of Hajrizi and appealed to citizens for help finding him.\n\nAfter initially calling it \"a clear terrorist act coming from Kosovo by Albanian structures,\" Dacic said investigators were treating the crime as a \"terrorist attack because it is an attack on officials.\"\n\nKosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti responded to reports of the killing by urging officials to avoid \"politicizing\" the tragedy.\n\nRelations remain strained between Serbia and its partially recognized former province, which Belgrade still regards as part of Serbia despite a declaration of independence by Kosovo’s predominantly ethnic Albanian authorities in Pristina in 2008.\n\nThe Kosovo Correctional Service called Smrekonica an \"open institution\" and said two officers had been suspended after Hajrizi's escape earlier this month.\n\nHajrizi's criminal convictions in Kosovo included the killing of a Russian soldier 24 years ago when Hajrizi was still in his teens.\n\nReports suggested Hajrizi had escaped from prison as many as nine times, and the prison authority was quoted earlier this month as saying he had 7 1/2 years left to serve on his current sentence.\n\nThe Serbian Interior Ministry said a Kosovar passport in the name of Artan Hajrizi, Faton Hajrizi's brother, and a German identity card were found at the crime scene.\n\nArtan Hajrizi announced in Germany on the day of the shooting that his brother had stolen his passport two days earlier.\n\nDacic suggested that the alleged document theft pointed to a premeditated attack.\n\nDeputy police chief Vasiljevic told German media that police there had been contacted via Interpol.\n\nOn July 18, Dacic reported that the alleged driver of the vehicle in which the suspected shooter was riding had been apprehended in the city of Bijeljina, in Republika Srpska in Bosnia. He was identified as Zoran Radovanovic.\n\nThe Serbian Higher Court told RFE/RL's Balkan Service that Radovanovic had skipped bail five years ago before being tried in absentia and sentenced by a Belgrade court in 2020 for leading a criminal group involved in drug smuggling.\n\nRadovanovic's wife was also arrested in Mladenovac, near Belgrade, on July 18 on suspicion of being an accomplice to a crime.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered a historic address before Britain's cabinet on July 19, calling for its help in halting Moscow's deadly missile strikes by allowing Ukrainian forces to launch attacks deeper inside Russian territory.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nZelenskiy, the first foreign leader to address the cabinet since former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1997, said Britain had the power to convince its NATO partners, some of whom have been reluctant to allow Kyiv to use Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets hundreds of kilometers deep inside Russia, to reverse their stance and remove the limitations.\n\n“I ask you to show your leadership,\" Zelenskiy told the British cabinet to a standing ovation at the start of the meeting at No. 10 Downing Street.\n\n\"Right now we are missing the main answer to this question and that is our long-range capability...Please convince the other partners to remove the limits. If the restrictions on using Western weapons against Russian military are lifted, we can strike further than just near the border,\" he said, adding that once we can strike further...including Russian military airfields, we will not only protect ourselves from any Russian offensives but also secure our frontline positions and cities from Russian bombs.\"\n\nBritain has been one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters since the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion in February 2022, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who led his Labour Party to a landslide election victory earlier this month, was quick to reaffirm Britain's commitment to Kyiv despite the change of government.\n\nZelenskiy and Starmer met separately ahead of the cabinet meeting, and the Ukrainian leader thanked Britain for its sustained support.\n\n“Ukraine is, and always will be, at the heart of this government’s agenda, and so it is only fitting that President Zelenskiy will make a historic address to my Cabinet,” Starmer said in a statement before the meeting.\n\n“Russia’s incremental gains on the battlefield are nothing compared with the collective international support for Ukraine, or the strength of ties between our people.”\n\nRussian forces over the past several months have made small advances in the east of Ukraine against exhausted Ukrainian forces who have lacked sufficient manpower and ammunition. At the same time, Moscow has also frequently targeted critical Ukrainian energy infrastructure and caused deaths and damage in cities.\n\nSeparately, Zelenskiy said on July 19 that Poland had made a decision that would speed up the delivery of F-16 warplanes to Ukraine.\n\n\"Today, we have a positive decision from the Polish government on a specific issue, which will allow Ukraine to receive F-16 jets sooner. I am grateful to Prime Minister Tusk for efficiently following up on our previous agreements. I am grateful to Poland for its strong support for Ukraine,\" Zelenskiy wrote on X, without giving details.\n\nEarlier on July 19, Russian shelling from across the Dnieper River killed an elderly woman in the settlement of Bilozerka, in Ukraine's Kherson region, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram.\n\nA Russian strike on the town of Chuhuyiv in the northeastern Kharkiv region wounded at least seven people, regional head Oleh Synyehubov reported, while in the Sumy region close to the border with Russia, at least one civilian was wounded by Russian shelling, according to regional officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said that its air defense systems had downed 19 Ukrainian drones over the Kursk and Belgorod regions, as well as occupied Crimea.\n\nThe Ukraine-Central Asia Telegram channel said on July 19 that a Kyrgyz citizen, Alisher Tursunov, was among the soldiers returned to Russia as part of a prisoner of war swap with Ukraine earlier this week.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nIn late May, a video showing the 57-year-old Tursunov in Ukrainian custody appeared on the Internet. The man said police in the Russian city of Ryazan detained him and forced him to join the Russian military for its invasion of Ukraine. In return, he was promised money and Russian citizenship.\n\nTursunov then begged the Kyrgyz government to help him return home.\n\nAccording to the Central Asian nation's laws, fighting in a foreign country for any side other than Kyrgyzstan is considered a crime.\n\nLast month, another Kyrgyz man, whose name was not disclosed, was sentenced to five years in prison for joining Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThe same month, a Kyrgyz man, Beknazar Borugul-uulu, who was sentenced to five years in prison in 2023 for joining Russia's Wagner mercenary group to fight in Ukraine was released due to a January presidential amnesty decree.\n\nIn January, a Bishkek court handed a suspended seven-year prison term to another Kyrgyz man, Askar Kubanychbek-uulu, for joining the Russian military in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the court's ruling, Kubanychbek-uulu was banned from leaving the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, while serving a three-year probation period that was part of his seven-year suspended sentence.\n\nHowever, he managed to flee Kyrgyzstan and returned to Russia, where he signed a new contract with the Defense Ministry to join Moscow's armed forces.\n\nKyrgyz officials have said that the deaths of at least 10 Kyrgyz citizens have been confirmed in the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter Russia announced a partial mobilization in September 2022, Kyrgyz authorities warned Kyrgyz migrant workers in Russia that joining either the military occupying Ukraine or Ukraine's armed forces is considered “mercenary” work, which is punishable in the former Soviet republic by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe exact number of Kyrgyz nationals fighting in the conflict remains unknown.\n\nViktor Orban said on July 19 that Ursula von der Leyen -- who was reelected on July 18 for a second term as European Commission president and has been a constant critic of the Hungarian prime minister's close relationship with Moscow and his rule-of-law backsliding -- is just an \"employee,\" not an adversary.\n\nOrban, whose country took over the EU's six-month rotating presidency on July 1, has been a constant opponent of European support for embattled Ukraine and sanctions against Moscow.\n\nEarlier this month he went on a self-styled \"peace mission\" to Moscow and Beijing that attracted the ire of the commission's chief and the leaders of the bloc's other member countries. He then met with former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican Party's candidate in the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November.\n\n\"Von der Leyen is not our political opponent, she is our employee, and yours too,\" Orban said during his regular Friday morning \"interview\" with Hungarian state radio on July 19.\n\n\"Von der Leyen's task is to implement the line outlined by the prime ministers. Since she receives her salary from member states, she is in a relationship of dependence,\" Orban said.\n\nOrban's remarks came after von der Leyen, in her speech in the European Parliament ahead of the vote that reconfirmed her as commission chief, called Orban's trips an \"appeasement mission.\"\n\nOrban also urged the other EU heads of state and government to be more effective in holding von der Leyen \"accountable,\" saying her performance had been \"very poor.\"\n\nDuring her first five-year term, von der Leyen, a former German defense minister, steered the EU through several crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and has been a main proponent of a Green Deal aiming to make the EU climate-neutral by 2050.\n\nUnder Orban, the leader of the right-wing populist Fidesz party who has been in power since 2010, Hungary has been accused of eroding the rule of law and democratic rights amid reports of growing corruption and cronyism. Billions of euros in EU funds earmarked for Hungary have been blocked over the bloc's concerns.\n\nOrban told Hungarian state radio on July 19 that he would continue his \"peace mission\" and said that a Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election in the United States would bring \"peace\" to global politics.\n\n\"Trump is clear about what he is going to do. Why do we want to be left behind? This will also change the Europeans' situation. The essence of politics is to know where the epicenter of events will be,\" Orban said.\n\nOrban's remarks come after he sent a letter to EU leaders on July 16 saying that while the United States is \"at the moment heavily preoccupied with the presidential campaign,\" Trump is ready to act \"immediately\" as a peace broker if he gets reelected."
