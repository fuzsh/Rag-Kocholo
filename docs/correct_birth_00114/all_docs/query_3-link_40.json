        "text": "The late Lou Reed is celebrated as one of the most influential musicians of our time. The New York native got his start with The Velvet Underground in the 1960s, later leaving to start his solo career in music. Throughout his decades making music, Reed put out over 20 studio albums, collaborated with famous names such as David Bowie and Andy Warhol, and was even inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nToday, the iconic musician is remembered for his unmatched talent, boundary-pushing style and, of course, his music. From images of Reed with fellow music legends like Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, and Patti Smith to behind-the-scenes shots taken by legendary photographer Mick Rock, here are 11 rare vintage photos of Lou Reed."
