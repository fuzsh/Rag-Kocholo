        "text": "He formed the group The Velvet Underground with Welsh multi-instrumentalist John Cale, second guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Maureen Tucker in New York in 1965. The group soon became a part of Andy Warhol's Factory scene, which housed a great number of the most freaked and experimental artists at the time. The German singer and actress Nico sang in the group for a short period-- but the original line-up began to split up. The group, at its best, made only four original albums: \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\" (1967), \"White Light/White Heat\" (1968), \"The Velvet Underground\" (1969), and \"Loaded\" (1970). They stand today as milestones in the history of rock.\n\nIn 1970, Lou Reed began his solo career. His second album, \"Transformer\" (1972), was produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, long-time admirers of the Velvets. That year, he had his first--and still only--top 20 song, \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" Through the 1970s, he made a prolific number of albums with \"Berlin\" (1973), \"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\" (1974), and \"Street Hassle\" (1978) as the artistic highlights of this period. On St. Valentine's Day 1980, Lou Reed married Sylvia Morales, and that was another turning point in his career. The following album, \"The Blue Mask\" (1982), stands as one of his best and most composed. In 1989, he made \"New York\"--a love letter to his city with its good and bad, and with a heavy criticism of American thought.\n\nIn the 1990s, he continued to be one of the most sharp-tongued rock 'n' roll poets of his time. In 1990, he once again collaborated with ex-Velvet-partner John Cale. Their album, \"Songs for Drella,\" was a very personal tribute to friend and artist Andy Warhol, who had recently died. In 1993, The Velvet Underground was re-formed with its original line-up, and toured in Europe in 1993. In 1997, Lou Reed, along with former Velvet band mates John Cale, Maureen Tucker, and the late Sterling Morrison were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nLou Reed stood as one of the most important songwriters of our time and has served as inspiration to a multitude of artists such as David Bowie, Nick Cave, Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, U2, David Byrne and Patti Smith."
