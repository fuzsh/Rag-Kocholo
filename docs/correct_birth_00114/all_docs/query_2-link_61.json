        "text": "(1942–2013). The American singer-songwriter Lou Reed established himself as a rock legend as leader of the Velvet Underground. That New York City-based band produced four poor-selling but enormously influential studio albums between 1967 and 1970. After leaving the group, Reed began a solo career that embraced experimentation and included everything from pop to heavy metal.\n\nLewis Allan Reed was born on March 2, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York. He began playing in bands as a teenager and studied literature at Syracuse University. After graduation, Reed moved to New York City and took a job writing songs for Pickwick Music. During this period he met John Cale, who was a member of the band hired to play Reed’s songs. In 1965, with the addition of guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Angus MacLise, they formed the Velvet Underground; MacLise was soon replaced by Maureen (“Moe”) Tucker. The band’s four studio albums—The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967), White Light/White Heat (1968), The Velvet Underground (1969), and Loaded (1970)—were mostly ignored at the time, but they later inspired the punk and alternative rock movements of the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nAfter quitting the Velvet Underground in 1970, Reed reemerged as a solo performer in England. There he was adopted by admirers such as glam-rock pioneer David Bowie—who produced and performed on Reed’s breakthrough hit, “Walk on the Wild Side” (1973)—and the band Mott the Hoople—who covered Reed’s Velvet Underground classic “Sweet Jane.” Yet Reed struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, and his recordings and concerts were wildly erratic. Among his most notorious works of the 1970s were Berlin (1973), which was an orchestrated song cycle about a doomed love affair, and Metal Machine Music (1975), which was a double album of guitar drones.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, Reed formed a talented band and released the raw guitar rock album The Blue Mask (1982). Having overcome his addictions, Reed adopted a more serious tone on his recordings. He peaked with three albums that resembled a song cycle: New York (1989), about the spiritual death of his hometown; Songs for Drella (1990), an elegy for his 1960s mentor, Pop artist Andy Warhol (done in collaboration with John Cale); and Magic and Loss (1991), inspired by the deaths of two friends. A romantic relationship with American performance artist and musician Laurie Anderson rejuvenated Reed in the mid-1990s, resulting in the playful album Set the Twilight Reeling (1997) and the harder-hitting Ecstasy (2000)."
