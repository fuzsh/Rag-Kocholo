        "text": "BIOGRAPHY\n\nLou Reed: The King of New York\n\nWill Hermes\n\nViking, $55\n\nImagine Lou Reed coming home to meet your parents. Shelley Albin begged him not to. Her mother had found his letters explicitly detailing sexual exploits at the Hayloft, an illegal gay club he frequented as a Long Island teenager. Lou lobbed in anyway, goaded his girlfriend’s dad, then took her out way past curfew and trashed the family car.\n\nThis was 1962. Before his brain-scrambling electroshock therapy, before the sinister chemistry of the Velvet Underground, before the Warhol circus legitimised transgressive behaviour as Art. This was just how the young Lewis Allen Reed rolled.\n\n“He could be very funny and sweet when he wanted to be,” Albin adds in this latest, quite probably greatest biography by veteran US music journalist Will Hermes. In this she echoes many fellow sufferers of Reed’s famously venomous verbal and sometimes physical abuse, spanning in these pages his first, subversive literary dabblings at Syracuse Uni to his tender and cantankerous dying days at the East Hampton home he shared with his third wife, Laurie Anderson, in 2013.\n\nIn art, too, both polarities remained extreme to the end. Reed’s penultimate album, Lulu, with Metallica, was a blood-raw and pulverising song cycle soaked in bodily filth, degradation and violence. Against stiff competition, it garnered the most savage reviews of his career. He followed it with Hudson River Wind Meditations, a wafting, chiming and pulsating balm of electronic hypnosis born of his obsessive tai-chi practice, and ignored like wallpaper by fans and critics alike.\n\nHermes’ show-don’t-tell approach neither praises nor dismisses any of this. “If you’re hoping for some neat totalising statement or psychological profile to explain Reed, to fix him like a butterfly specimen, you won’t find it here,” he disclaims in his preface. “Reed was a shapeshifter who represented the potentialities of identity.”\n\nThere’s the rub. In a world that strives for definition, serial non-conformity was Reed’s gift and his crime. His lifelong insistence on gender fluidity, both in his life and writing, is the theme Hermes highlights to underscore his prescience as a cultural provocateur, as well as implying a basis for his rage against anything resembling orthodoxy and obedience.\n\nBy this meticulous account, almost every move of Reed’s breathtakingly erratic career was initially met with contempt and ignominy, perhaps the sole exception being his 1989 album New York, the one in which his sinewy rock sound and flinty stories happened to align with his mainstream-approved, apparently heterosexual street-tough character.\n\nThe Velvet Underground’s dire record sales versus unanimous retrospective acclaim is legendary; as is the fury that greeted their former frontman’s wrist-slashing Berlin album of ’73, and the “psychopathic insolence” (quoth one critic) of his four-sided noise experiment, Metal Machine Music.\n\nEven his brief but remarkably enduring “pop” arrival with the Bowie-produced Transformer album — cue Walk On the Wild Side, Perfect Day, Satellite of Love — was originally derided as a sell-out by critics who, by ’72, preferred his earlier, edgier stuff with the Velvets.\n\nAnd while most artists release live albums as stop-gap crowd-pleasers, Reed’s seemed geared to incense his fans, from the stadium rock strut of Rock’n’Roll Animal to the verbally excoriating Take No Prisoners, thoughtfully stickered by his record label, “This album is offensive”.\n\nBehind the scenes, meanwhile, Reed was mostly a mess. His VU pinnacle Heroin was a staple of his concerts forever: lived experience enshrined as poetry, conflating danger and transcendence for generations of hapless acolytes. For the entire 1970s, “I was really f---ed up. And that’s all there is to it,” he told one journalist in a rare moment of myth-deconstruction.\n\nThat’s hardly news. And long-time Lou-watchers will learn little they didn’t already know about his crucial and fractious connections with key players Warhol, Cale, Nico, Bowie and guitarist Robert Quine, as pithily drawn as these relationships are in Hermes’ retelling.\n\nWhat makes his book definitive is the wealth of lesser knowns who perhaps, in essence, knew him better: schoolmates, label associates, girlfriends and ex-wives doubtless cowed into silence while Reed was alive. Despite her tragic early death, even Reed’s mysterious ’70s lover, Rachel Humphreys, a no-go subject all his life, cuts a striking figure here at last.\n\nLoading\n\nHermes also gives due credit to the massive Lou Reed archive Anderson donated to the New York Library of Performing Arts a few years after his passing. The author clearly spent many hours listening to every recorded goof and demo; adding up every advertising offer (many accepted, some refused) that kept Reed, and his aforementioned handful of pop songs, comfortably enough ensconced to prioritise ever more offensive terrain.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the detested Lulu is slowly being re-evaluated as Lou Reed’s masterpiece these days, just as Bowie told Anderson it would be as she fretted about his legacy after his passing. The King of New York’s natural gift for puncturing the veneer of social and artistic acceptability clearly endures, beyond the grave. Still, maybe don’t take it home for your parents."
