        "text": "“I’m interested in writing a book,” Lou Reed once said. “But not about me.” It’s this propensity toward letting himself fade into the background of his own story that makes Reed so compelling, and so hard to pin down. The narrative of his life and career seems to deal in contradiction—he was an unforgiving asshole and a generous supporter of the arts, a detail-oriented control freak who liked to make simple, three-chord songs, a rockstar who wanted more than anything to be taken seriously as a literary figure, an iconoclastic outsider always secretly searching for massive success, and a queer icon who married three women. He could write silly lines (“When people say her feet smell/They mean her nose”) and devastating ones (“I thought I was someone else/Someone good”) on the very same album.\n\nThroughout his career, from the Velvet Underground to his vast, 30-plus years of solo work, Reed followed up commercial successes like Transformer with inaccessible artist statements like Berlin and Metal Machine Music. He was always negating the thing that his audiences assumed made up the real Lou Reed, as if to say, No, you don’t know me at all.\n\nThough a breadth of biographical material on him exists, Reed himself never wrote an autobiography—he rarely seemed to even want to talk about himself, despite the rockstar image he cultivated and the confessional lyrics he put into the world. Maybe this is why there are so many biographies on Reed: They all want to definitively chronicle an artist whose essence was so difficult to find.\n\nThe selections below each offer different perspective on Lou Reed the artist and person. Alone, they might not be enough, but together, they begin to puzzle together some of the pieces. I’ve left some materials out—for instance, I’ve included no Velvet Underground-specific books, although the biographies mentioned go into great detail about Reed’s time with the band. Many of these books were published after Reed’s 2013 death; we can only imagine what the famous contrarian would have had to say about each of them after the fact.\n\n(All releases featured here are independently selected by our editors.

The text comes across as a sympathetic counterpoint to less understanding biographies of the past, even about Reed’s drug abuse and the strain he put on everyone he was close to. At the book’s center is DeCurtis’ own love of criticism: Almost every one of Reed’s albums receives a song-by-song analysis of why it works (or doesn’t), and for this reason, the book is best read slow while accompanied by Reed’s discography.\n\nA Deep Dive on the Definitive Album\n\nTransformer by Ezra Furman (2018)\n\nIn his intro to this 33 ⅓ book, the musician Ezra Furman asserts that Transformer isn’t a great album because it succeeds in achieving something, but rather because it’s an album caught in the act of becoming—that Reed’s identities, wrenching him in disparate directions, each contribute to what makes it his greatest record. Furman writes Reed as an imperfect creator (“The way I see it, if you respect someone, you call them on their bullshit.”) as he gives each Transformer track a mini-essay as seen through Reed’s queerness, his failures, and the push-pull dynamic that exemplified his entire career. As such, it’s much more than just a take on the album itself—it’s a recontextualization of Reed, and an illuminating look at the conflicts that motivated him, from the perspective of a fan and fellow musician.\n\nIn His Own (Sometimes Cantankerous) Words\n\nReed famously hated interviews, and this book houses five of them in chronological order, each as different as can be. It opens with Lester Bangs’ infamous, bombastic 1975 article in Creem, in which Reed gets palpably more annoyed with each moment. Elsewhere, Reed’s 1996 discussion with novelist Paul Auster is particularly sympathetic—the two are clearly friendly, and so discussing the creative process, aging, and relevance doesn’t seem to be as much of a hurdle for Reed as it had been in the past. Reading through these interviews, it’s easy to believe that Reed got easier on the press as he aged, but then you get to the fourth, conducted by New York’s David Marchese, and Reed just stops and stares with contempt. The final interview, from 2013, is by model and actress Farida Khelfa, who serves Reed short, unambiguous questions that get him waxing philosophical about the nature of sound. This collection is a testament to Reed’s lifelong suspicion about the motivations of the press.\n\nThe Poetry Collection\n\nDo Angels Need Haircuts? by Lou Reed (2018)\n\nAfter he abruptly left the Velvet Underground in 1970, Reed said he’d never perform rock’n’roll again. He chose instead to focus on his literary ambitions, which he’d begun nurturing in college at Syracuse under the tutelage of his late, troubled mentor Delmore Schwartz. The time before he re-emerged and reinvented himself as a solo artist is thought of as Reed’s “lost years,” but he was in fact quite prolific as a poet. This collection of annotated poems surrounds his reading at legendary New York literary institution the Poetry Project, helmed at the time by Anne Waldman, who also provides the book’s intro. Reed read both poems and lyrics during the performance, and the presence of the literary figures he admired in the audience made him nervous, as Laurie Anderson writes in her afterword. On the page, some of the lyrical themes Reed was obsessed with begin to emerge (“I am empty/like a cup./Won’t you come/and fill me up”). The book, which also includes photos and other ephemera, as well as audio of the reading itself, is a fascinating glimpse into a tangent that Reed’s biographers tend to gloss over.\n\nThe Biography Lou Actually Liked\n\nPublished in 1994, the first version of this biography by Jeremy Reed (no relation) was Lou’s favorite of the materials on him. (“All the books about me are bullshit except Jeremy’s,” he once said.) After Lou’s death, though, the author conducted an extensive rewrite of the text and published a new version in 2014. The result includes aspects of the musician’s life that were previously excluded, such as the period with Rachel, his transgender companion in the ’70s. It’s not a linear biography; instead, it’s heavily conversational, shifting in time as needed to bring points together. Part of the book’s joy is the fact that the author himself is a poet who focuses on lyrics in a way that would likely have pleased his subject.\n\nThe Atmospheric Account\n\nThis biography is built more upon a certain Lou Reed vibe than facts occurring in chronological order. Which is not to say that it’s unresearched, but rather that Aidan Levy’s prose is evocative and at times almost gothic, especially when describing the dark moments of Reed’s life, such as his electroshock therapy and addictions. Levy spends nearly two thirds of the book on Reed’s life through Transformer, then flies through the rest in the remaining third. This perhaps mirrors the pace and role of crisis itself in Reed’s life, which evened out tremendously after his move to the New Jersey suburbs in the early ’80s, but it also makes the book’s pace somewhat uneven. However, the particular ambience of Levy’s writing works the way Reed’s music does—it invokes the emotional clouds hanging over Reed at the defining moments of his life.\n\nThe Story of Lou According to His First Wife\n\nIn a breezy tone, Reed’s first wife Bettye Kronstad writes of the five-year period, 1968-1973, between the end of the Velvet Underground and Reed’s third solo album Berlin. Kronstad makes an effort to contextualize what’s happening with their personal life with the goings-on of Reed’s career, as well as with cultural milestones like the Stonewall Riots. But at its most interesting and tragic, this book serves to inject the well-worn myths of Lou Reed the legend—from his speed-fueled creation of Berlin to his drunken 1973 performance at Alice Tully Hall—with humanity, and offers an insider’s perspective to Reed’s losses of personal control and his fears and anxieties, particularly during the Transformer era. Perfect Day is an accompanying document that helps flesh out a period during which Reed was most callous toward the people who supported him.\n\nThe Photographic Tribute to His Favorite City\n\nLou Reed’s New York by Lou Reed (2006)\n\nReed’s interest in photography began in the ’60s, and he honed the craft in his later years, publishing several volumes of photo books. Lou Reed’s New York is the most affecting of these, showcasing Reed’s view of the city from which he siphoned his power. The book is not a historical document per se, but rather a glimpse into how he (literally) regarded the city he loved. The photographs consist mostly of textural landscapes—the New Jersey skyline from the Hudson River, nighttime traffic from above, a lone helicopter circling in a painterly sky—but the most striking thing about this book as a document is that Reed’s version of New York is curiously devoid of people. The only humans are seen at a distance, inside cars or crossing the street from above; however, Lou Reed’s New York is punctuated by close-up images of Reed’s own eyes, as if to remind you that his principal role in life was that of an observer."
