        "text": "\"I hate Lou Reed more and more,\" Andy Warhol wrote in his diary in 1986, 20 years after the artist helped launch the singer's career with the Velvet Underground.\n\nAnd really, could you blame him? As Anthony DeCurtis explains in his encyclopedic biography Lou Reed: A Life, the late rock legend could be a jerk of monumental proportions, spewing anger and rage at everyone around him. The fact that he could also be tender and caring is part of what makes Reed and this evenhanded portrait of him so fascinating.\n\nDeCurtis, a veteran Rolling Stone scribe who interviewed the singer a half-dozen times, does an excellent job of balancing Reed, the visionary musician-poet, and Reed, the self-destructive miscreant who took many a \"Walk on the Wild Side,\" to quote his only hit single. For the most part, those two Lous were inseparable.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1942 to middle-class Jewish parents who later moved the family to Long Island, Reed rebelled against the status quo as a teen and gravitated toward rock 'n' roll, booze and pot. He also read subversive authors and started hanging out at the Hay Loft, a gay bar in Long Island, even though he was mostly attracted to women.\n\nWhen he began having mental health problems at 17 — possibly depression or schizophrenia — his parents took the advice of psychiatrists and put him through a series of 24 electroshock treatments, a brutal but not-uncommon therapy in the late '50s. When the sessions ended, Reed turned nasty and cynical and suffered from memory loss, according to his friends.\n\nHe never forgave his parents, especially his father, whom he demonized as a tyrant in his song lyrics for decades to come. It's unclear whether Reed's parents ordered the \"therapy\" because Reed was mentally ill or because he might be gay — which, in many circles, was considered an illness in 1959.\n\nEither way, this chapter in his life is pivotal. Reed's turbulent teen years inform everything that unfolds later, from his antagonistic personality and gender-blurring lifestyle to his near-deadly addictions to speed and scotch.\n\nIn 1964, after earning an English degree from Syracuse University, Reed moved to New York City and formed the Velvet Underground, whose dark, trance-inspiring tunes about heroin and S&M fell upon mostly deaf ears in an era of peace, love and flower power. Even with Warhol promoting the band, the VU's records sold poorly, and Reed quit in 1970.\n\nHe moved back home to his parents' house, worked as a typist at his father's accounting firm, and sank further into drugs, booze and loneliness. \"He was one of the most miserable people I've ever known,\" a friend from that era recalled.\n\nReed rebounded ... sort of. By 1972, when his solo career exploded in the wake of \"Walk on the Wild Side,\" one English magazine ranked him second only to Keith Richards as the rock star most likely to die young. Hard-bitten fans egged him on by tossing loaded syringes onstage during his shows.\n\nBut he survived the Me Decade to become the best-known chronicler of New York's dank underbelly. \"Faulkner had the South, Joyce had Dublin. I've got New York — and its environs,\" he once said.\n\nWhile he never stopped writing about the city's hookers, drag queens and drug dealers, he finally gave up speed and hard liquor in the early '80s with help from his second wife and manager, Sylvia Morales. DeCurtis does a fine job of describing his complicated relationships with Morales and his previous lovers, including Richard/Rachel, Reed's live-in transgender partner in the '70s.\n\nThe book gets slightly happier in the early '90s, when Reed meets his third wife, avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson, who turned him on to meditation, Buddhism, and softened some of his serrated edges. Reed's fury never totally faded, but the genial Anderson seemed to bring out a delicate side to Reed's personality that kept growing until 2013, when he died of liver disease at age 71.\n\n\"In the last few years, each time he was angry, it was followed by an apology, until the anger and the apology got closer and closer, until they were almost on top of each other,\" Anderson said at his memorial.\n\nAs a musician, however, Reed never mellowed or made nice with his record companies. He continued to stir up the hornet's nest until his final studio album, Lulu (2011), a collaboration with Metallica that infuriated their fans, his fans, and critics alike.\n\nThroughout the book, DeCurtis cuts Reed no slack and dissects each failed album as well as every triumph.\n\nBut in the end, he correctly defends Reed's many failures as part and parcel of what made him one of rock's great provocateurs: \"If Reed occasionally went too far, personally or artistically, that was just the price that had to be paid for everyone else not going far enough.\"\n\nThor Christensen is a Dallas writer and critic.
