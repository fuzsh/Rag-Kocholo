        "text": "Rolling Stone contributing editor Anthony DeCurtis first met Lou Reed in an inauspicious place: the Cleveland Airport in June 1995, a day after Reed performed at the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Both DeCurtis and Reed’s flights were delayed, so the two hung out in the airport lounge. “I had reviewed the New York album [for Rolling Stone in 1989],” DeCurtis tells Pitchfork, “and Lou chided me for not giving it five stars; he was sort of kidding around. It was a very relaxed conversation. I think we were all glad to have something interesting to talk about while waiting three hours for our flight.”\n\nThat encounter at the airport began a friendship that lasted until Reed’s death on October 27, 2013. Now DeCurtis, who also interviewed Reed several times, has written a biography on the iconic rocker. At over 500 pages, Lou Reed: A Life offers a thorough, unflinching, and balanced look at Reed’s complex life. It includes plenty of tabloid-ready tales of Reed’s excesses in the 1970s and his rivalries with such collaborators as John Cale and David Bowie, as well as insight on major moments in his career, from the Velvet Underground’s brilliant 1967 debut record to the controversial 2011 Metallica collaboration Lulu. It also touches on Reed’s relationship with his wife Laurie Anderson, and his eccentric side forays, including an interview he conducted with the onetime Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel—a chat that went so disastrously, Rolling Stone deemed it unpublishable.\n\n“I liked the fact that [Reed] was as complicated as he was,” says DeCurtis. “I felt that most of the writing about Lou fell into one camp or another: He’s God or he’s a monster. I understood both aspects of those perceptions; I didn’t see him in either of those regards. I felt that I could maneuver through the extremes of his personality and present a three-dimensional portrait.”\n\nLou Reed: A Life is an absorbing read, full of new insights delivered masterfully by DeCurtis. Here are five things we learned, annotated by the author in a recent interview with Pitchfork.\n\nReed Was Hurt By the Harsh Criticism of Berlin\n\nFollowing the success of his David Bowie-produced album Transformer, Reed turned in Berlin, a disturbing record with lyrics that document turbulent relationships, violence, and suicide. The 1973 album is now regarded as one of Reed’s best records (Rolling Stone selected it as one of their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time) but, upon its release, it received a decidedly mixed reception. Rolling Stone ran a very harsh review of Berlin that called it “a disaster,” and said it was the singer’s “last shot at a once-promising career. Goodbye, Lou.”\n\n“He was angry and hurt by that,” DeCurtis says. “Berlin is a great record; I liked it when it came out, but it certainly didn’t shock me that people wouldn’t play Berlin on the radio. It’s a scary record. Lou would always say, ‘If I was writing a book and it was like Berlin, or a movie and it was like Berlin, people wouldn't get upset about it.’ But he tried to do that in a rock ‘n’ roll song and people got worked up about it.”\n\nReed’s Electroshock Therapy Tore His Family Apart\n\nAround the time that Reed was a freshman at New York University, he experienced intense psychological issues, including mood swings and depression. Reed’s parents became worried he might kill himself and put him through electroshock therapy, an experience that made him resent his father for the rest of his life. (Rumors have persisted that Reed’s parents were also concerned with Reed’s bisexuality, but his sister, Merrill Reed Weiner, has refuted that.)\n\n“I think it enabled him to create his father as a monstrous figure in his imagination. I think he never forgave his father for that,” DeCurtis says. “I feel like his father did the best he could—Lou was acting out with drugs and sexually in ways that certainly at that time would've been beyond the pale. Lou used it creatively, regardless of whether or not his father really was this bad a guy, as he said.”\n\nReed Had a Dramatic Affair With a Transgender Partner, Rachel\n\nThe ’70s were a wild time for Reed: His drug and alcohol use were heavy, and he frequented sex bars around New York. For around four years, Reed was romantically involved with a transgender woman named Rachel, whom he mentions in “Coney Island Baby.” The couple’s relationship was tempestuous, and there were rumors of street violence surrounding Rachel; as one person recalls in Lou Reed: A Life, she drew a switchblade on a female friend of Reed’s backstage at a New York music venue.\n\n“To be involved with a transgender woman very openly in the 1970s was totally bold,” DeCurtis says. “At the same time, by all accounts, Rachel had a secret life of her own as a transgender hustler, which was how Lou met her at an after-hours bar. I don't think she ever gave up that life. To the degree she maintained her edgier life on the street, I think Lou found that compelling.”\n\nReed’s Lovers Became His Employees… Before Laurie Anderson Came Along\n\nIn the book, DeCurtis interviews Reed’s college girlfriend, Shelley Albin, as well as his ex-wives Bettye Kronstad and Sylvia Morales. Along with Rachel and Reed’s future wife, Laurie Anderson, they served as the inspirations for several of his songs, including “Pale Blue Eyes,” “Perfect Day,” and “Adventurer.”\n\n“Whether they were called his manager, assistant, or lighting designer, they all went to work for him and they all got swept up into Lou's world,” says DeCurtis of Reed’s ex-paramours. “Ultimately, he insisted that they do that, and then resented it.”\n\nHowever, when Laurie Anderson entered the picture, this pattern changed. “Laurie’s way of handling herself, and why their relationship worked and lasted for such a long time, is she never gave up her independence. She had her own career and reputation,” adds DeCurtis. “The earlier women, I think, just tried to please him, and that was never going to work. The fact that Laurie always maintained her independence was something that kept Lou’s interest up. Anytime I was around them, he was extremely deferential to her.”\n\nReed Tanked a Lucrative Velvet Underground Reunion in the 1980s\n\nIn the late 1980s, Lou Reed and his former Velvet Underground bandmate John Cale collaborated on what would become Songs for Drella, a tribute album to the Velvets’ former patron, Andy Warhol. It was a prelude to the classic Velvets lineup of Reed, Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Mo Tucker reuniting in 1993 for a European tour. But friction between Reed and Cale reemerged when the former insisted on producing an album taped during a potential “MTV Unplugged” set, plus taking an additional producer’s fee. Plans for the “Unplugged” episode and a U.S. tour soon fell apart.\n\nAccording to DeCurtis, the fiasco was yet another example of Reed asserting his control. “Ever since he kicked Cale out of the Velvets in 1968, Lou had come to think of the Velvets as his band,” he says. “The live reunion album [Live MCMXCIII] reflects that—it’s less a VU album than a set of Velvets songs performed by Lou Reed, with the other members backing him. Looking at the big picture, Cale, Sterling, and Mo went along with that, however reluctantly. But when it came time to think about an American tour and the ‘Unplugged’ show... Cale finally couldn’t stand it, and that was the end of that.”"
