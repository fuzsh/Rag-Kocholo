        "text": "Good morning.\n\nToday we’re listening to Lou Reed, an American singer, songwriter, and ambient music producer from New York. He was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Freeport, Long Island, where he taught himself to play guitar by playing along with the radio. After college, he moved to New York City and co-formed a band called The Velvet Underground, which he quit in 1970. He embarked on a solo career that would span pretty much until his passing in 2013. We’re playing his final solo album, Hudson River Wind Meditations, which he originally released in 2007, designed to accompany meditation, yoga, or tai chi. The Meditations were recently remastered by engineer John Baldwin and reissued by Light in the Attic Records.\n\nHudson River Wind Meditations - Lou Reed (70m, no vocals)\n\nSpotify / Apple Music / YouTube Music / Amazon Music / Bandcamp / Tidal"
