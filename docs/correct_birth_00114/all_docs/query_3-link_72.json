        "text": "Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Lou Reed, a co-founder of the legendary band the Velvet Underground and one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the past 50 years, died Sunday in Southampton, Long Island, N.Y. He was 71.\n\nNo official cause of death has been disclosed for the musician, who underwent a liver transplant in May, but his passing was confirmed by his film collaborator, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, and by Reed’s literary agent, Andrew Wylie, who believes his death was related to complications from his liver transplant.\n\n“I’m afraid it’s true,” Wylie told the New York Times today. “He was as great an artist as it’s possible to be, in my opinion.”\n\nAuthor Salman Rushdie invoked several of Reed’s best-known song titles in paying tribute to him, saying: “My friend Lou Reed came to the end of his song. So very sad. But hey, Lou, you’ll always take a walk on the wild side. Always a perfect day.”\n\nOn Twitter, celebrity chef and author Anthony Bourdain quoted the Velvet Underground’s song “Sweet Jane,” writing: “Heavenly wine and roses … seem to whisper to me … when you smile’ … RIP Lou Reed.”\n\nReed performed a number of times in San Diego on his own and with the Velvets, as the band was fondly known by fans. He had been scheduled to perform at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival in Indio in April. That appearance was abruptly canceled as a result of his liver problems, although no reason was given at the time.\n\nHis enduring impact as a solo artist was profound and worldwide. Likewise, his now-legendary exploits with the Velvets, the pioneering New York rock band he co-founded in the mid-1960s. Reed’s work with the Velvets laid the foundation for his prolific solo career, which he launched in 1972, and for several generations of punk and post-punk bands.\n\n“The first Velvet Underground record sold 30,000 copies in the first five years,” former Roxy Music member Brian Eno, who produced albums by U2, Talking Heads and Coldplay, once noted. “I think everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band!”\n\nHis body of work includes more than two-dozen solo albums, nearly half of which rank as classics or near-classics, beginning with 1972’s “Lou Reed,” and collaborations with everyone from Metallica and cutting-edge theatrical director Robert Wilson to free-jazz sax pioneer Ornette Coleman and Reed’s wife, performance art star and musician Laurie Anderson. Before launching his solo career, he made seven albums with the Velvet Underground, starting with 1967’s landmark “The Velvet Underground & Nico,” which provided a dark yet often cathartic alternative to the peace-and-love hippie ethos then in vogue.\n\nA poet turned rocker, Reed wrote such classic Velvet Underground songs as “Pale Blue Eyes,” “Venus in Furs” and “Heroin,” which Patti Smith would cite in 1998 as “one of our more perfect American songs.” As a solo artist, he wrote such classics as “Walk on the Wild Side,” “Coney Island Baby” and “Perfect Day,” which was covered by U2 and other high-profile admirers.\n\nThe Reed-penned “Sweet Jane,” which was featured on the 1970 Velvets album “Loaded,” has one of the most copied sequence of guitar chords in rock. The Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, shortly after the death of group co-founder Sterling Morrison.\n\nReed was a musical minimalist who focused on bringing a poet’s sensibility to rock lyrics.\n\n“The nature of his lyric writing had been hitherto unknown in rock,” David Bowie, a longtime admirer and periodic collaborator, noted in the Grammy Award-winning long-form video documentary “Lou Reed: Rock and Roll Heart,” which aired in 1998 as part of the “American Masters” PBS-TV series.\n\n“Lou brought rock into the avant garde,” Bowie continued. “He gave us the environment in which to put our more theatrical vision. He supplied us with the street and the landscape, and we peopled it.”\n\nReed, by his own admission, was not a sophisticated musician. He had a limited vocal range and relied on a musical palette of a few chords.\n\n“There is something magical about them,” Reed said in a 2000 U-T San Diego interview about his three favorite chords. “I don’t know what it is, and I don’t care. I was in Morocco, and listening to, I don’t know what kind of music — it starts with a `G’ (Gnawa) — and it was really (just) one chord. It made me feel so much better about what I do. I’m in a fine, fine tradition, because the music (in Morocco) was repetitive, (had) variations and was mesmeric, all at once. It was just glorious.”\n\nHe also addressed his musical limitations in a 1998 U-T San Diego interview, saying:\n\n“People say to me: How can you use those same chords, over and over?’ And I say:`I’m just starting to get it right.’ They think that I’m kidding. And I’m not.”\n\nBare-bones though his music was, his lyrical imagery was almost unmatched.\n\nHe wrote songs that cogently explored extremes and norms in human behavior, without glamorizing them or being judgmental. Whether examining drug use and sadomasochism, existential angst and death, or love’s heady elation and excruciating heartbreak, Reed’s songs achieved an unusual degree of passion, insight and honesty with his concise yet evocative lyrics.\n\n“I was careful not to write anything trendy, or to use language that was somehow slang vernacular that would be old by the time a record came out,” Reed said in a 2000 U-T San Diego interview. “I was trying to use language that would read as well today, meaning now, as then. So I was thinking that far ahead. And, certainly, working with (Andy) Warhol (during his tenure with the Velvets), we thought we were doing something really unique.\n\n“Actually, before we met Andy, we thought we were doing something unique. But working with Andy and inventing what became known as multimedia performances, there’s no question. And we were pretty involved in just doing it; no one was saying: ‘Ah, this is for the future.’ “\n\nAs for his longevity, no one was more surprised than Reed himself.\n\n“I never thought this would be a career,” the putative godfather of both punk and alternative-rock told U-T San Diego. “I never thought more than a few hours in advance. And I certainly never thought (about) several decades. Good god! This is me we’re talking about.”\n\nReed underwent debilitating bouts of drug and alcohol abuse, but later became a devoted practitioner of Tai-Chi. He was married three times but also experimented with bi-sexualty. While his songs were often gritty and dark, he did not regard them as bleak.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever had a bleak outlook,” he said in a 1984 U-T San Diego interview.\n\n“You know, if you read Crime and Punishment,’ would you say that Dostoevesky had a bleak outlook? I have no control over how people categorize me and I don’t deal with it. I happen to think that we all get better as we get older, and I think that’s reflected on (his then-new album) ‘New Sensations.’ I just had a bunch of songs that seemed upbeat and felt pretty good. Also, I’d hate to think that I would stay in just one place, just writing about one thing forever.”\n\nReed was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on March 2, 1942.\n\nHe took classical piano lessons as a youth. At age 14, he started playing the guitar after being inspired by Elvis Presley. While in high school, Reed recorded a single, “So Blue,” with a band called the Jades — “I think it sold three copies, if that,” he wryly noted in his 1984 U-T San Diego interview\n\nAfter graduation, he attended New York University and Syracuse University, majoring in English and minoring in philosophy. He studied poetry there with Delmore Schwartz, one of his biggest mentors and influences.\n\n“I was working my way through college as a guitar player. Not a very good one either,” Reed said in that same interview. “When I got out of college, around 1964, I got a job as a staff songwriter for Pickwick International Records. I made a lot of these budget albums that you see in Woolworth’s. I don’t even remember who the other guys were in the band I worked with.\n\n“We didn’t write (songs) for other people, we just recorded under a bunch of different names — the Beach Nuts, the Primitives, Pasha and the Prophets, the El Dorados; you name it. It was all just the same four guys, and whatever trend was in, we’d write those types of songs. It was a very good discipline. It was also very good training on how to get in and out of the recording studio very quickly.\n\n“I was writing these very pop-type tunes with these other people, and then I was writing these other songs on my own which ended up being used in Velvet Underground. There was no way I could use my material in the format I was operating in (at Pickwick). So, it was simply a matter of finding the right bunch of people to have a band with.”\n\nThe “right bunch” turned out to be one of the most eclectic assortments of musicians ever assembled for a contemporary pop group — classically trained violist John Cale, German chanteuse Nico, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker, one of the first female percussionists in a rock band.\n\nThe result was Velvet Underground, a short-lived, but highly influential band with a jarring, sometimes dissonant instrumental style later echoed (at times, almost note for note) in the music of myriad punk and alt-rock bands. The Velvets were one of the first rock bands to experiment with electronic feedback and extended improvisation. The group produced as string of classic songs, including “Venus in Furs,” “Waiting for the Man,” “Sweet Jane” and “Heroin.”\n\nReed’s goal, then and throughout his career: To write adult songs for adult listeners.\n\n“My idea had been that I liked writing very much, and I also liked rock ‘n’ roll very much, and I wanted to combine the two,” Reed told U-T San Diego in 1984.\n\n“I wanted the music to complement the lyrics, and the lyrics to be something that was decent writing. I can only speak about myself, but I find it very interesting and challenging trying to keep the lyrics at a certain level. I’m interested in quasi-vernacular that gives the impression that someone’s speaking in real English, rather than trying to be overly elegant and get lost in polysyllabic stuff that would inflict itself on the rhythm.\n\n“I want everybody to believe these songs are really real. In fact, generally speaking, if it didn’t happen to me, it happened to somebody else that I knew, or that they knew. Or I read it. And then other stuff, I just make up. It would be very boring if it were all autobiographical, although I give the impression that it is, but in fact it isn’t.”\n\nReed’s most controversial solo release was “Metal Machine Music,” a double-album of excruciating electronic noise released in 1975. In hindsight, Reed said he regretted only the way the record was marketed, not its almost perverse aural attack.\n\n“I would not have released it on the pop record division of RCA Records,” he told U-T San Diego. “I would’ve put it on the (classically oriented) Red Seal label. ‘Metal Machine Music’ is a record people bought thinking it was one thing and it turned out to be another. They thought they were ripped off, and I’m sorry for that. There should have been a large disclaimer on it, you know,`This is purely electronic music, and contains no vocals and no songs.’ ”\n\nFans may not have known it from Reed’s minimalistic guitar playing, but he was deeply inspired in the 1950s and ’60s by the liberating music of free-jazz sax icon Ornette Coleman, with whom Reed performed and recorded in the 1990s. He also worked with saxophonist Oliver Lake, erstwhile Coleman band trumpeter Don Cherry and, for more than a decade, guitarist John McLaughlin’s former rhythm section.\n\n“I was very much moved by that (jazz) aesthetic, and moved for good,” Reed said in a 1996 U-T San Diego interview.\n\n“Probably the fact that I like Ornette so much — and (Coleman trumpeter) Don Cherry — made me able to hear and be accessible to Oliver Lake’s horn parts. I also had heard some horn stuff he had done for a Bjork record, and that knocked me out . . . The thing is, Ornette and his band members could read and write music, and I couldn’t. And they could really play their instruments, and I couldn’t.\n\n“I still can’t read and write (music), but I think I can play better. But there’s something to be said for a free-form thing, where you just follow the feedback. I have a good sense of pitch, and I wasn’t playing the guitar as a normal instrument, but as a feedback instrument. I thought, with a good sense of pitch, there were wonderful things you could do with it. And if you could be loose with it, you could generate a lot of stuff.”\n\nReed’s relationship with his former Velvet Underground band mates was often contentious, before and after their fleeting reunion in the 1990s. But he was proud of their work together.\n\n“I think all of us felt this way — that we would write something that would hold up in 30 years,” he said. “In fact, I’ve always been trying to do that. I’d said before that we were trying to write things — lyrically and musically — that you could still listen to, that would hold up. I think we did.”"
