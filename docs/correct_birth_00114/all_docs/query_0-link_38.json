        "text": "Lou Reed never had the prominence or commercial sales of 1960s peers such as the Beatles or Bob Dylan — his only major commercial hit was “Walk on the Wild Side.” But his influence was just as vast, if not more so.\n\nPunk, post-punk and most strains of underground music of the past 40 years would not exist without the one-of-a-kind merger of music and words pioneered by Reed and his groundbreaking band, the Velvet Underground.\n\nReed died Sunday at 71 in Southampton, N.Y., of an ailment related to a liver transplant he underwent in May, his literary agent said.\n\nHe leaves behind one of the most profound musical legacies of any 20th century artist. His lyrics suggested a new kind of street poetry, at once raw and literary. His music — conceived with John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker in the Velvet Underground — merged primitivism with sophisticated avant garde ideas.\n\nThe Velvets made four landmark studio albums before crumbling in 1970, each a template for the underground music to follow. The artists in their debt include R.E.M., David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, the Talking Heads, Roxy Music, U2 and Patti Smith.\n\nIn an interview with the Tribune in 1990, Roxy Music founder Brian Eno reiterated his famous remark about the Velvets: “Only a few thousand people bought the first Velvet Underground album, but every one of them formed a band” — and embellished it: “I should know. I was one of those people.”\n\nReed, born in Brooklyn in 1942, grew up in a middle-class family and went on to study at Syracuse University, where he was mentored by famed poet Delmore Schwartz.\n\nHis staunch interest in Beat literature and classic soul and doo-wop was perhaps underutilized in his job as staff songwriter for Pickwick Records in New York, but the for-hire tunesmithing sharpened his affinity for writing simple two- or three-chord melodies.\n\n“I wanted to be a writer, always did,” he once said. “Ever since elementary school I was writing songs, and I’ve essentially been able to survive by writing. I consider myself really, really lucky.”\n\nThat gift flourished in the Velvets, where he wrote future classics like “Rock ‘n’ Roll,” “Sweet Jane” and “Pale Blue Eyes.” In the mid-’60s, he befriended Cale, a classically trained musician from Wales, who brought a cutting-edge sense of harmonics and texture to Reed’s melodies. Cale in turn was astounded by Reed’s skill with lyrics.\n\n“I’d never met anyone like Lou who could put words together like that. He would create these dangerous scenarios in the songs, in part because we were finding ourselves in these strange, dangerous scenarios all the time in New York.”\n\nAt a time when rock music was only just beginning to grapple with deeper subjects, Reed’s songs put society’s misfits, outcasts and pariahs at the center, and not in a judgmental way.\n\nThe epic “Heroin,” its dire scene set by the ebb and surge of the guitars and Cale’s viola, focused on a junkie. As shocking as the subject matter was when Reed and his bandmates performed it in New York City clubs in 1965, “Heroin” was a nuanced and tragic first-person portrayal of addiction.\n\nReed’s lyrics looked at transgressive subjects, whether sadomasochism (“Venus in Furs”) or drug dealing (“Waiting for the Man”), with a storyteller’s eye for detail and a poet’s flair for wordplay.\n\nBut the band was never widely understood in its time, and Reed left at the start of the ’70s to pursue a solo career. His work was soon championed by a new wave of bands out of England and New York, including the New York Dolls, Sex Pistols and Patti Smith, and Reed became the “godfather of punk.”\n\nThe Bowie-produced “Walk on the Wild Side” single and “Transformer” album in 1972 became key moments in the gender-bending glam movement.\n\nAlong the way, Reed went from a misunderstood underground figure into an international man of letters, published author and respected artist.\n\n“Berlin” “didn’t get one positive review” when it first came out, Reed once said, “and now people think it’s a masterpiece.”\n\nEmbedded within this cycle of reluctant acceptance was Reed’s defiant, sometimes icy public persona. He was notorious for chewing up interviewers who did not defer to him.\n\nReed is survived by his wife, the musician and performance artist Laurie Anderson.\n\nLou Reed through the years\n\nMarch 2, 1942: Lewis Allan Reed is born in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\n1960s: Reed is living in Manhattan when he first meets musician John Cale. The two form the nucleus of a group that would evolve into the Velvet Underground.\n\n1967: The Velvets release their debut album “The Velvet Underground and Nico.”\n\n1970: Reed leaves the Velvet Underground.\n\n’70s: Reed’s albums are praised as daring experiments or mocked as embarrassing failures, including “Berlin” and the experimental “Metal Machine Music.”\n\n’80s: Reed kicks drugs and releases a series of acclaimed albums, including “The Blue Mask,” “Legendary Hearts” and “New Sensations.”\n\n1996: The Velvet Underground is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n2008: Reed and performance artist Laurie Anderson are married and often collaborate on artistic projects.\n\nMay: Reed undergoes a liver transplant.\n\nSunday:\n\nReed dies at a hospital in Southampton, N.Y., from complications from his transplant.\n\nWire services"
