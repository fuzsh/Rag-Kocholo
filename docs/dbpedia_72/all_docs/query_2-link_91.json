        "text": "Dodge Center, although a smaller town, has a huge community of amazing people. Throughout my time here, these people have been nothing but supportive, generous, and loving towards me and my family. They have taught me what real friendship looks like, what it means to be a part of a team, and how to build the life Iâ€™ve always dreamed of. I am proud to call Dodge Center my home town.\n\nLived here all my life. Pretty quiet, not too much crime. Have several nice parks, and a decent selection of stores. Pretty good for a small town. Have a volunteer fire-station in town and an ambulance.\n\nI love the small town life that comes with living in Dodge Center. There's not much to do, but I'm not anxious all the time because it's very small.\n\nDodge Center is an excellent town. It is perfect for all family types, especially those with young children. Most homes in town are within walking distance to the school. The town has many features like a kwik trip and a Casey's. Dodge Center also has a Subway, Plaza mariana, Hot wok, 24 gym, and many local businesses. Dodge Center is a community filled with kind and caring people."
