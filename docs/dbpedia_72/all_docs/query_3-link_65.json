Fremont is the county’s most-populous city and its county seat. The Dodge County Historical Society’s May Museum is a great place to learn about the area’s history in railroads, manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nLearn more about Fremont and Dodge County by contacting the Fremont-Dodge County Convention & Visitors Bureau at visitfremontne.org and (402) 753-6414."
