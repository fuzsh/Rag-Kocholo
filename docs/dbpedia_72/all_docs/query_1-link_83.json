        "meta_description": "Charles F. Dodge City Center is a multi-use facility used to host conventions, concerts, meetings and trade shows, and facilitating local events which will promote civic, educational and community pride. This visually striking SMG managed facility offers 35,000 square feet of flexible meeting and event space. Attendees will notice the modern contemporary architecture with its sleek lines and the unique layout of the facility. Supporting these spaces are the well-equipped catering facilities by SAVOR which means that everything from coffee breaks to five-course banquets run seamlessly. Ample space for freight access into the Great Hall offers added convenience for larger events. Right outside the front door, is the Frank C. Ortis Art Gallery and Exhibit Hall &#8211; “The Frank”. The 11,000 square-foot, two story art gallery was named after Mayor Ortis in honor of his decades-long commitment to the cultural arts. Multi-disciplinary art-centric programming will offer opportunities for cultural observation, participation and community connection.",
