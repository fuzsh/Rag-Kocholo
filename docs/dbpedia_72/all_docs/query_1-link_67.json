        "text": "County Info\n\nWelcome to Dodge County MN\n\nDodge County is a county in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The population was 20,867 as of the 2020 census. Its county seat is Mantorville. Dodge County is part of the Rochester, MN Metropolitan Statistical Area. The area of present Dodge County was a hunting and battle ground for the Mdewakanton Sioux, often fighting Sauk and Fox Indians who wandered into their territory. Possibly the first non-indigenous person to enter the territory was a French fur trader from Canada in 1655. After the fur trappers and early explorers, the area was populated by settlers from New England. The 1820s and 1830s saw significant emigration, eased by completion of the Erie Canal (1825) and the end of the Black Hawk War (1831). They brought a passion for education, establishing many schools, as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were members of the Congregational or Episcopal church. Culturally Dodge County was similar to colonial New England during the nineteenth century. In 1853 government surveyors set lines for the townships. In 1854, two Mantor brothers and Eli P. Waterman established their claims in the area of present Mantorville. In early 1855, Dodge County was organized for local government. It was named for Henry Dodge, the first governor of Wisconsin (1836-1841). The Minnesota State Constitution placed Dodge County in the Fifth Judicial District on May 11, 1858. The county courthouse was constructed in 1865; it is presently the oldest still-used courthouse in Minnesota. As the 20th century began, emigrants from Germany, Sweden and Norway flowed to Minnesota in increasing numbers. Their influence added Catholic and Lutheran influence to the cultural mix.\n\nPoint Of Interest\n\nOle Carlson House\n\nThe Ole Carlson House is a historic farmhouse in Dodge County, Minnesota. Located in Canisteo Township, it is on County Road 15, approximately 8 miles (13 km) south of Kasson, Minnesota. In 1981, the home remained in the ownership of the grandson and great-grandson of Ole Carlson. The private home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on April 16, 1982. The Ole Carlson House was both designed and built by Ole Anderson Aasved for his neighbor Ole Carlson, a fellow Norwegian immigrant farmer. Its location on a slight elevation makes the structure very visible. The house is a large, two-story, almost square brick structure, symmetrical in arrangement with a hip roof and roof deck, with a projecting central gabled pavilion. At the time the home was completed, it had a balustrade along the edge of the roof deck, however it is no longer present. In addition to the main house, a small one-story brick addition on the eastern side (rear) houses a summer kitchen. The south foundation includes a datestone with the name \"O. A. Aasved\" and the date \"1880\". The design includes elements reminiscent of the Italianate style, which are often found in rural Minnesota farmhouses of the era and used to emphasize verticality. These elements include two-over-two double-hung sash windows in tall rectangular openings with keystone segmental-arch hoods, and hooded double front entrance. Unlike similar houses, conventional eave brackets were never applied to the house."
