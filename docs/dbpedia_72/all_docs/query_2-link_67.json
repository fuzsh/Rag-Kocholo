        "text": "By Stephen Swanson\n\nClick here for updates on this story\n\nDODGE CENTER, Minnesota (WCCO) — A 63-year-old man was crushed to death Monday morning at a southeastern Minnesota manufacturing company.\n\nThe Dodge County Sheriff’s Office says it happened just after 10 a.m. in Dodge Center at Con-Tech Manufacturing, which makes concrete mixers.\n\nThe victim, from Brownsville, was “cutting a crossbeam support on a dolly that was supporting a 5,000-pound mixer drum, when the dolly failed,” causing the mixer to fall on him, according to the sheriff’s office.\n\nThe victim’s co-workers used two forklifts to lift the mixer before giving him CPR. EMS workers then arrived at the scene to take over life-saving efforts, which were unsuccessful. He was pronounced dead at about 10:30 a.m.\n\nThe Olmsted County Medical Examiner’s Office is assisting with the investigation, which OSHA will lead."
