The 43 year old Captain had been with the Sheriff's Office since 1994. Captain Guenther's positive, enthusiastic personality helped him quickly move up the ranks at the Sheriff's Office being promoted from patrol to training deputy, Sergeant of training, and later Captain.\n\nIn addition to his work for the Sheriff's Office, Captain Guenther was also a instructor for the law enforcement program at Rochester Community and Technical College, and was very active each year volunteering for the local Toys for Tots program.\n\nAfter reviewing the case, the State of Minnesota's Department of Public Safety deemed Captain Guenther's death a Line of Duty death, making it the third Line of Duty (LOD) death in Dodge County and the 273rd LOD death in the state's history. in 2013, he was one of the 119 officers that died in the Line of Duty in the United States. There were 10 others that year that died of heart attacks.\n\n1988 - CLAREMONT POLICE CHIEF KILLED\n\nClaremont Police Chief Gregory Lange was shot and killed on July 5th, 1988 while trying to break up a domestic argument in the city of Claremont, less than 200 feet away from his own residence.\n\nThis plaque is displayed on the first floor of the Dodge County Courthouse in his memory. The 39 year old chief had worked in Claremont for 2 1/2 years. Prior law enforcement experience included serving as a police officer in Owatonna from 1972 to 1979.\n\nDodge County Sheriff Ernie Vanderhyde said he and Lange had an excellent working relationship and Lange was dedicated to his job. Lange was very well liked in his community. In addition to coaching little league, he opened his home after school to kids who's parents weren't home. Lange also helped start a Crime Stoppers Program and a drug hotline. He was survived by his wife Sue and son Chris who was 12 years old at the time of his death.\n\nChief Lange was the second Line of Duty death in Dodge County history. In 1988, Lange was the 230th law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty in Minnesota.\n\n1987 Dodge County Sheriff's Office department photo\n\n1982 Dodge County Sheriff's Office department photo\n\n1979 Dodge County Sheriff's Office department photo\n\nSheriff Ernie Vanderhyde - 1983\n\nHayfield Police Officer Willy (William James) Richardson shown in this picture in the late 70s - this picture was taken sometime before the city decided to contract with the Dodge County Sheriff's Office for law enforcement services .\n\nSheriff Ernest J Vanderhyde in a 1978 Dodge Monaco Patrol Squad\n\nThis is a picture of the Sheriff's Office location back in 1977. The Sheriff's Office had received two CB Radios that year donated by the Dodge County Posse. This building is currently being used as a county vehicle maintenance shop.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office was moved from the courthouse to a remodelled gas station at the bottom of the hill in Mantorville in 1975. The office would remain there until 1991 when the East wing of the courthouse was built at the top of the hill.\n\nSheriff Willis J.

Officer Havey left a wife and three children ages 2 months to 10 years.\n\nOfficer Havey was the 1st Line of Duty death in Dodge County history and the 19th LOD death in the state's history.\n\n1855 -- FIRST DODGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND JAIL CELL\n\nWhile the county has never really had a \"jail\" where multiple prisoners could be held, we do still have the first jail cell on display in Mantorville. The Restoration House is located just south of the courthouse in Mantorville. In around 1855 the first floor of this house was rented to the county to house Offices of the Sheriff and Treasurer. Our first jail cell is located in the basement of this house and on display. They also held court on the main floor of this house until the courthouse was completed in 1865. The Sherif's Office then moved into the basement of the courthouse and was there until 1975 when it was moved to the location across from the bank in Mantorville. It remained there until 1991 when it was moved to our current location in the courthouse at the top of the hill."
