Dodge is also the only senator in history who concurrently served in the Senate with his father (Henry Dodge). Two years later, Nebraska's First Territorial Legislature organized the boundaries of the territory's first counties, including Dodge County, which honored Senator Dodge with its name.\n\nLike many communities close to rivers and streams, the first European inhabitants of Dodge County were trappers, traders, and hunters. One of the earliest communities which sprang up to support traffic along the Platte River was Fremont, named after U.S. general and politician John C. Fremont. Other communities, including North Bend, Hooper, and Scribner, soon followed to support the rapidly growth community; between 1860 and 1890, Dodge County grew by nearly 20,000 residents. Dodge County also became an important early freighting community due to its position along the Mormon Trail and proximity to the Platte River.\n\nIn 1860, Fremont won a special election to become the county seat, though the official records used by the county continued to remain scattered among the homes and offices of the county's elected officials. Eventually, the county constructed a courthouse in 1867 following a wealthy local benefactor's donation of the necessary land. That courthouse would survive until its replacement was constructed in 1890. Then following a fire in 1915, the present courthouse was built."
