        "text": "Joseph Dresbach, the son of John Dreisbach (1762-1823 in Mifflinburg, PA) and Catherine Youngman, and grandson of Martin Dreisbach I (1717-1799 at Lewisburg, now Union Co., PA), migrated westward, settling for a short time in Sandusky, Ohio, before moving on to Dodge County, MN around 1855. Joseph is buried in Wildwood Cemetery in Wasioja, MN. Two of his sons and several grandchildren are buried at Riverside Cemetery. One of the authors of History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties, H.H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884), was Michael Roush Dresbach and his biography is included in that volume. Michael served in the Civil War."
