        "text": "Dodge County is a county located in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The population was 17,731 as of the 2000 census. Its county seat is Mantorville. Dodge County is part of the Rochester, MN Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nDodge County was originally inhabited by Native Americans, as many counties in Minnesota were. This area was a common hunting and battle ground for the Mdewakanton Sioux, often fighting the Sauk and Fox Indians who had wandered into their territory. The first white person to visit Dodge County, however, is not known. It is believed by some that a French fur trader from Canada was the first, setting foot on its soil in the spring of 1655. Guides deemed this area unsafe due to the Natives living there. But, it was not until over two hundred years later that the locality truly came to life."
