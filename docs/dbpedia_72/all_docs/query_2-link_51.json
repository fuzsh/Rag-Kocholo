        "text": "DODGE CENTER.\n\nSource: History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties; H. H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884); transcribed by Sheila Gruver\n\nIn 1866, during the summer, the Winona & St. Peter Railroad was built from Kasson westward through Dodge county. The first station actually located west of Kasson, was Claremont; but the question of a depot at some intermediate point, was agitated considerably. In the woods near the railroad bridge across the south Middle Fork of the Zumbro, lived A.B. Wellman, Onias Hall and others, who made efforts for its location in that vicinity, where once the town of Hallowell had been begun, but the steepness of the grade, on either side of the stream, rendered the project impossible. Accordingly, in the summer of 1867, Wellman and Hall bought 80 acres of land of Eli B. Ayars on section 34 in the township of Wasioja with the understanding between them and Atkins the Superintendent of the road that a depot should be located thereon. Nothing was done, however, during the season toward the development of the town, except the moving in of a dwelling house by Samuel Geer, from Sacramento, and another building by J. J. Mattocks, which was used for a hotel. In the fall D. C. Fairbank, of Waupun, Wisconsin, became interested in the project and took a half interest in the town plat, only partially surveyed at the time, with Wellman and Hall. A side track was put in and he erected a small grain warehouse upon it, in which R. B. Nims acted as station agent for A. A. Fairbank, a brother and agent of D. C. Fairbank, and who at that time was located at Rochester. Late this fall, also the town proprietors build a two story building (the one now occupied as a hardware store by Charles), in which R. B. Miller, of Mantorville, put a large stock of goods. C. H. Crandall first sold goods in this store, but in the spring of 1868, his place was taken by D. A. Shaw. He built a store for himself and stocked it. It was afterward destroyed by fire.\n\nThe man who had the honor of first selling goods in Dodge Center was D. L. Tyler, who came from the town of Ashland and put up a shanty probably in the early spring of 1867 upon the corner now occupied by the Underwood block. He bought his goods at Wasioja, Mantorville or Kasson, as the condition of the market demanded, and freighted them to his establishment on his back in a satchel. He used to flag the trains occasionally before a permanent station was established, and was appointed Postmaster in the summer or fall of 1867. He also built an addition to his store in the spring of 1868. In the fall of 1867, a blacksmith shop was started by D. L. Franklin and a stock of lumber offered for sale by S. P. Kinney. With the opening of spring in 1868, building operations were resumed and several additions made to the business facilities of the place. Albert Palmerlee, who had previously traded some in a small shanty erected a good sized grocery store and stocked it, H.A. Vickery built a furniture store. The store which Kraff erected has already been mentioned and Shaw and Campbell built a grain warehouse north of where Dr. Garvers house now stands.\n\nS. P. Kinney bought the house of J. J. Mattocks, re-built it and made additions and used it for a hotel. In the summer of 1870 he obtained the patronage of the railroad company, of which __ Stewart was now the superintendent, and who, with other officers of the road had become interested in property matters in and about Dodge Center, and for several years had the railway eating house in addition to his ordinary hotel business. The house had an excellent reputation and large patronage. Mr. Kinney also, in the summer of 1868, together with John Fulton and Onias Hall, built another store and filled it with hardware. The lumber trade was carried on after a short time by John Gill, who, in the spring of 1868 had put in some capital with Kinney in the business.\n\nJ. Rusha had a shoe shop in connection with his dwelling.\n\nIn 1869 N. M. Vance added a drug store to the business of the town. The first doctor to permanently locate in the place was Dr. S. L. Ranson, who is a physician there at the present time. He came to Dodge Center in 1870 and during the next year with Thuett Brothers built a block, one store of which he occupied as a drug store, and in the other Thuett Brothers put a large stock of hardware.\n\nIn the winter of 1868-9 A. N. Smith and M. D. Underwood moved into the village from Concord township, and bought the interest of A. B. Wellman in the town site, also the grain warehouse in which Shaw and Campbell first bought wheat, and the station which had been in D. C. Fairbanks warehouse was now changed to theirs, and a small addition was made to the building for that purpose.\n\nA. N. Smith was agent for a short time, but was succeeded by M. D. Underwood, who retained the position for several years. The present depot was built in 1871. In the spring of 1869, in the month of March, the town proprietors, D. C. Fairbanks, Onias Hall, A. N. Smith, and M. D. Underwood completed the survey of the village of Dodge Center plat, and it was recorded in July, 1869. The territory embraced was the north half of southwest quarter of section 34, town 107, range 17, west. To this an addition was made by Eli B. Ayars of a part of south half of southwest quarter of section 34, and recorded August 20th, 1875.\n\nFairbank and Stewart had before this made a survey on section 33 on June 24th, 1874, of an addition which was placed on record the 23rd of October, 1874. For several years now the development of Dodge Center was quite rapid. As its name indicates, it is situated very near the geographical center of the county, and has no rival in the shipping trade except Kasson, which is about six miles east. The good will and practical aid of the railroad for some time gave it a strong impetus. It became for a time the only shipping point of much importance in the county, and one of the best on the line of the railroad. It still retains its pre-eminence as a shipping point for grain and stock. Its largest elevator, which is owned by D. C. Fairbank, was transported in part by him from Cambria, Wisconsin, in 1872.\n\nIn 1874, M. R. Dresbach and others, under the name of Nims, Dresbach & Co., built a warehouse and elevator which, after it became the sole property of M. R. Dresbach he sold to A. E. Robbins. It is at present owned by D. C. Fairbank, and used by him for a warehouse. When the depot was built the warehouse in which the station had been located was bought by A. L. Wellman, and in part removed farther west upon the side track. It was afterwards bought by Van Dusen & Co., and an addition built about 1876. In 1874 a large brick block was built by M. D. Underwood and Levi Leighton on the north side of Main Street. In 1875 T.J. Hunt erected the brick building in which his drug store and the post office are at present kept, and Thuett Brothers built their brick hardware store in 1877.\n\nIn 1874 O. H. Benton opened the first law office in the village and also took editorial charge of the Dodge Center Press, the pioneer paper of the place.\n\nThe village of Dodge Center was incorporated as such by a special act of legislature approved February 29th, 1872, and thereby made a municipal corporation with all of the powers and privileges incident thereto. The territory included under this act is the east half of section 33, and all of section 34, township 107, rang(e) 17. This act was amended February 11th 1874, and again by an act approved March 9th, 1878, by which all previous legislation in relation to the matter was repealed.\n\nA fire which destroyed several thousand dollars worth of property occurred in 1875, on the north side of Main Street, but the buildings then destroyed have been replaced by others. The town has also suffered from some severe wind storms, but not so much as to disturb for a long time its equilibrium.\n\nIts schools for the last three years have been under the operation of the High School law of this state, and will graduate their first class in 1885. A school house in which religious meetings were held at an early day was moved in from the country. A hall above Vances store also served for some time as a place for public gatherings. A bank was established by C. Hardin & Son in 1873. In 1879 the whole business was taken in charge by D. S. Hardin, who was succeeded by Parsons Brothers in October, 1881, the present bankers of the town.\n\nThe village was organized under its charter February 20th, 1874. At an election held in Palmerlees Hall, ninety-one votes were polled, and the following officers were elected:\n\nPresident ---- C. D. Tuthill.\n\nTrustees ---- W. A. Patterson, J. C. Campbell, and Daniel Lockwood.\n\nRecorder ---- M. D. Underwood\n\nJustice of the Peace ---- C. D. Tuthill.\n\nConstable ---- J. E. Gettman.\n\nThere were also fifty-six votes against licensing the sale of intoxicants to thirty-one for. Following is a list of the officers of the village to the present time:\n\nPresident. Trustees. Recorder. Justice.\n\n1875 - D. S. Hardin, L. B. Nims, A. F. Lesher, T. J. Hunt, C. H. Benton, L. B. Nims,\n\n1876 - D. S. Hardin, A. F. Lesher, H. C. Sikes, A. L. Wellman, C. H. Benton, L. B. Nims,\n\n1877 - D. C. Fairbank, A. S. Palmerlee, John Fulton, C.D. Hardin, C. J. Humason, O. H. Phillips, Councilmen\n\n1878 - A. E. Robbins, J. H. Crosby, J. L. Wertz, John Ingalls, J. J. Burrows, O. H. Phillips\n\n1879 - D. S. Hardin, John Ingalls, A. H. Merchant, M. George, C. K. Peterson, T. J. Hunt,\n\n1880 - John Gill, Jr., J. K. Faucher, S. W. Ransom, G. Ingraham, C. J. Humason, T. J. Hunt,\n\n1881 - D. C. Fairbank, E. K. Whiting, H. C. Sikes, A. H. Merchant, F. H. Everts, J. H. Vorkins,\n\n1882 - D. C. Fairbank, E. K. Whiting, M. George, L. M. Norton, C. J. Humason, J. H. Vorkins,\n\n1883 - D. C. Fairbank, E. K. Whiting, W. B. Parson, M. George, C. H. Benton\n\n1884 - T. J. Hunt, S.R. Orcutt, A. J. Hopkins, John Ingalls, J. V. Kendall, O. H. Phillips.\n\nOn Nov. 14th, 1874 appeared Dodge Centers first newspaper, under the title of (the) The Dodge Center Press. It was founded by J. A. Haines and C. H. Benton, under the name of Haines & Co., Benton had editorial charge and filled that position until January 30th, 1875.\n\nHaines then run (sic) the paper alone for about a month, when Jesse D. Carr became his partner.\n\nThe next fall Haines sold his interest to Carr, who assumed sole management during the following winter. In May, 1866, O. H. Phillips bought a half interest, and in July purchased the remainder.\n\nHe run (sic) the paper for the next three years. E. R. Patrick was however associated with him about one year of this time. In April, 1879, he sold to J. M. Miles, who continued the publication of the paper for about eleven months, and removed it to Brookings, D.T. The town was then without a paper for a short time, but in June, 1880, R. McNeill started The Dodge Center Index, which was bought October 11th, 1883, by O. H. Phillips, its present editor and publisher.\n\nRelief Lodge No. 108, A.F. and A.M.  This lodge was organized in Dodge Center, March 10th, 1873, under a dispensation from the grand lodge of the State. The petitioners for dispensation were; A. L. Wellman, M. D. Underwood, John Gill, Jr., G. Bentliff, B. M. Owen, A. S. Parlmerlee, Isaac Ellston, D. L. Franklin, O. H. Phillips, S. P. Kinney, E. K. Whiting, D. S. Hart, E. N. Brooks, R. G. Chadbourne, A. A. Coleman, Jacob Harris, John Tschabold, A. P. Hall, A. A. Fairbank, C. D. Tuthilll, H. P. Whalon, L. B. Weston, J. G. Van Frank, Wm. A. Coleman. These petitioners were then members of various lodges in Minnesota and Wisconsin. A charter was granted and numbered 108 upon January 14th, 1874.\n\nThe result of an election of officers under the charter was as follows: A. L. Wellman, W.M.; A. P. Hall, S.W.; F. W. Evarts, J.W.\n\nAt no time in its history has the lodge been as prosperous as under the dispensation, having at the time of receiving its charter a membership of about forty-five. At the present time however there are fifty-eight members, and the lodge is in good working condition. Following is a list of officers since 1875.\n\n1875 - A. L. Wellman, W.M.; D. L. Franklin, S.W.; J. D. Gettman, J.W.\n\n1876 - A. L. Wellman, W.M.; O. H. Phillips, S.W.; J. E. Gettman, J.W.\n\n1877 - O. H. Phillips, W.M.; J. E. Gettman, W.M.; G. W. Ballard, J.W.\n\n1878 - J. E. Gettman, W.M.; H. Gardner, W.W.; John Painter, J.W.\n\n1879 - J. E. Gettman, W.M.; M. R. Dresbach, S.W.; A. S. Palmerlee, J.W.\n\n1880 - J. E. Gettman, W.M.; A. S. Palmerlee, S.W.; H. H. Ketchum, J.W.\n\n1881 - J. E. Gettman, W.M.; A. S. Palmerlee, W.W.; G. W. Ballard, J.W.\n\n1882 - J. E. Gettman, W.M.; A. S. Palmerlee, S.W.; L. N. Weston, J.W.\n\n1883 - J. E. Gettman, W.M.; A. S. Plamerlee, S.W.; H. H. Ketchum, J.W.\n\n1884 - M. R. Dresbach, W.M.; G. W. Ballard, S.W.; L. N. Weston, J.W.\n\nThe lodge first met over D. L. Franklins blacksmith shop, the same building that is now occupied by Crail. In 1874, when the Underwood & Leighton block was erected a hall was arranged for their especial benefit in view of a permanent occupancy. When, however, Wescott & Steer purchased the building a question arose in regard to rent, and the lodge crossed the way and fitted up a hall on the other side of the building, which they occupy at present. Although, not a large room, it is well furnished.\n\nLeader Lodge No. 41, I.O.O.F.  this lodge of Dodge Center, Minn., was instituted May 22nd, 1873 by the meeting of the grand masters of the State, with a number of members of lodges from Owatonna and Rochester, Minn. Its charter was granted on application of May 17, 1873.\n\nThe charter members were: A. A. Fairbank O. Hall, L. D. Daggett, C. W. Fairbanks and R. C. Eastman.\n\nThe officers elected at that date May 22nd, 1873 were: A. A. Fairbank, N.G.; D. L. Franklin, R.S.; July: Onias Hall, N.G.; A. P. Hall, R.S.; Jan., 1874: D. L. Franklin, N.G.; W. E.

Round, R.S.; Jan., 1884: J. L. Griswold, N.G.; C. H. Benton, R.S.\n\nThe meetings were first held over D. L. Franklins blacksmith shop. From thence the lodge was removed to a room over the store occupied by W. E. Fairbank, on the corner of Main and Prospect Streets, thence to over the store occupied by R. G. Hill.\n\nThey then took up their present quarters in the brick block, erected by Underwood & Leighton, where they have a large and finely furnished hall. The membership is now fifty-six, and the lodge is one of the best in Southern Minnesota.\n\nSummit Lodge No. 25, A.O.U.W.  This lodge was organized at Dodge Center, September 5th, 1877, by the initiation of fifteen charter members, by district deputy P.M.W.A. H. Taisey. The charter members: C. H. Benton, O. H. Phillips, C. F. Siegler, A. P. Hall, G. W. Harnur, R. G. Hill, J. E. Gettman, George Hart, A. H. Lawrence, C. E. Phillips, J. H. Crosby, J. H. Shepley, C. P. Gibson, A. E. Robbins, E. L. Babcock. Following is a list of officers of the lodge: 1877: C. H. Benton, P.M.W.; O. H. Phillips, M.W.; Q. P. Hall, R.; J. H. Crosby, Rec.; 1878: A. E. Robbins, M.W.; J. A. Farnsworth, R.; J. H. Crosby, Rec.; 1879: C. H. Benton, M.W.; O. B. Underhill, R.; J. C. Edison, Rec.; 1880: O. B. Underhill, M.W.; O. H. Phillips, R.; J. J.

Phillips, M.W.; A. D. Smith, R.; John Peterson, Rec.\n\nBut few of the original members of the lodge are connected with it at the present time. Large accessions however have been received from time to time, and the membership at present is about thirty. The meetings have usually been held in Odd Fellows hall in Dodge Center. The membership is scattered over the western and central parts of the county, and is composed largely of the farming population.\n\nThe lodge is in a healthy condition, and is constantly making additions to its members.\n\nCHURCHES.\n\nCongregational Church of Dodge Centre.  In 1851 (November 16th), the first church of their denomination in Minnesota was organized at what is now Minneapolis and this remained the only one until 1853 when Cottage Grove and Excelsior joined the list and in turn these three were the only ones until 1855 when three more were added, and in 1856 seven more, in 1858 three, and to these in 1859 nine more, two of these last being the churches at Mantorville and Wasioja; this first being about three months the eldest. The first meeting looking to the organization of the church in Wasioja was held May 22d, 1858 in the house of Mr. Campbell at which a committee consisting of Rev. Charles Shedd, Dr. J. A. Garver and Moses Gallup were appointed to draft a confession of faith and covenant which was duly reported and adopted at a subsequent meeting in the house of Moses Gallup, June 5th. The following day being Sunday the church was organized with six members conditionally until letters of dismissal should be received form their former churches. June 19th another meeting was held at which Silas Beckwith of Claremont was elected deacon and the following persons handed in their letters from their respective churches; J. A. Garver and wife from 3d Presbyterian Church of Oxford, Ohio. Charles E. Gallup from 1st Congregational Church Voluntown, Connecticut; Mrs. Tabitha L. Gallup 1st Congregational Church, Plainfield, Vermont; Mrs. Mary Campbell, 1st Presbyterian Church, Dubuque, Iowa; Mrs. C. S. Doud, Congregational Church, Vergennes, Vermont; S. S. Beckwith and wife Owatonna Circuit M.E. Church.\n\nThese early records are in the hand writing of Dr. J. A. Garver first clerk of the church and written in a book evidently not designed for that especial purpose containing many business and professional memorandums.\n\nJuly 4th, 1858, Mrs. L. S. Rossiter and Wm. Spaulding were added to the membership on profession of faith making the member at that time ten. The total membership in the twenty-five years has been seventy of whom ten have died in fellowship with the church and twenty-nine were dismissed by letters to other churches. The present membership is twenty-four. Rev. Father Shedd continued as pastor until 1875. He was succeeded by Rev. L. Loring during whose six months pastorate it was voted to remove the church to Dodge Center assuming its present name.\n\nThe society was legally incorporated June 10th, 1870, with D. A. Armstrong, J. C. Gettys, C. E. Gallup, Wm. Garrison, T. J. Hunt and H. A. Vickery as its first trustees. Rev. Francis McCracken was pastor from August, 1875 to August, 1877, Rev. A. J. Drake (under whose determined efforts the present fine church edifice was erected, dedicated Jan. 19th, 1879) from September, 1877 to October, 1880. The pulpit has been occupied by the present incumbent Rev. A. H. Tebetts since 1880. The places of worship have been many and various. First in private dwellings then in the old Wasioja school house to the east of that village (now Henry Fleeners dwelling) in town hall. The seminary and the Baptist Church, at Dodge Center in the M.E. Church. S.D.B. Church and finally in its own permanent house now happily free from all incumbrances of debt.\n\nThe church edifice referred to is a fine brick structure well furnished inside and at the present (1884) is being adorned with a good spire.\n\nRegular Baptist Church.  Was organized in 1874 with nearly twenty members under the labors of Rev. Walter Ross who served them till 1877, when Rev. E. Wescott preached for them half of the term until 1879. During this time a fine church building was erected an ornament to the town.\n\nThen Rev. J. N. Annis served for about a year. This church building went down a perfect wreck at the time of the first cyclone in 1880. The members having largely moved away to Dakota and elsewhere the organization was then dissolved, those of the members remaining seeking homes in other churches.\n\nThe Seventh Day Baptist Church of Dodge Center.  In the year 1856 three families of Seventh Day Baptists came to Dodge County and located in the southern part of the town of Wasioja. The next summer they were joined by a few others, and the following season by still others. After due notice, on the fourth day of June, 1859, under the leader ship of Eld. Phineas Crandall a meeting was held of all of this faith to organize a church.\n\nThe meeting was held at the house of B.F. Bond about one mile north east of where Dodge Center now is. The church was organized with eleven members, N.M. Burdick was chosen deacon, B.F. Bond, clerk. The membership was increased quite frequently by those joining who came from eastern homes to locate here, and also by baptism.\n\nEld. Phineas Crandall was for a time located with this little church as missionary pastor. Later he went from here to occupy another missionary field in Freeborn County, and the church was left without a pastor for some time, during which they were visited by Elders O. P. Hull, of Milton, Wisconsin, and A. B. Burdick, of Rhode Island, as missionaries. They were also occasionally supplied by Eld. Shepard, of Wasioja a First Day Baptist.\n\nIn September, 1861, the church invited S. R. Wheeler one of its members who was preparing for the ministry to improve his talent in preaching, which invitation he accepted. Later Brother Wheeler finished this preparation for his chosen work, was ordained and for several years was a very successful pastor of the Pardee Church in Kansas. He is now an earnest and successful missionary in Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas.\n\nJune, 1862, the church invited deacon H. B. Lewis a ready speaker and very earnest in manner, to preach as opportunity offered which invitation was accepted.\n\nIn August, 1864, Eld. O. P. Hull who had previously visited the church and held a very effectual revival was called as pastor. Up to the year 1865 the services of the church had been held at the private homes of its members, but during the summer of this year a house of worship was erected on a lot leased from Orrin Jones a member of the church on section 16 in the town of Ashland, which location was at the time about the center of the society, the most of the material was hauled with teams from Red Wing.\n\nThe name was now changed from the Wasioja to the Wasioja and Ashland Church.\n\nIn June, 1866, Eld. Joel C. West of Trenton Freeborn County, was called to the pastorate of the church, which relation continued one year.\n\nOctober, 1867, Deacon H. B. Lewis was again called, which call he accepted and served for a time.\n\nIn the winter of 1868-9, Eld. Stephen Burdick, came to the church and held a revival which brought an increase of membership of fourteen by baptism.\n\nIn October, 1871, Eld. C. M. Lewis of Varona, N.Y., - a brother to deacon H. B. Lewis  a very successful revivalist held a revival which resulted in a large increase in the membership of the church.\n\nThe following month Eld. Z. Campbell of New Auburn, Minnesota, was called to pastorate of the church, which connection was sustained about four years. He afterward returned to his home at New Auburn at which place he died June 11th, 1884.\n\nAs time brings about changes it also brought the Winona and St. Peter R.R., through the county and the village of Dodge Center was built on the line, about two and one-half miles from the church. It was decided to move the house to the center and enlarge and remodel it, lots were secured and in December, 1873 it was moved with teams, it was afterward enlarged and improved, which cost over $800.\n\nIt was thought best to change the name from the Wasioja and Ashland to the dodge Center church.\n\nIn September, 1877, George M. Cottrell, of Richburg, N.Y., a young graduate from Alfred University located at Alfred Center, N.Y., (a school controlled by this denomination) was called to be pastor of the church. On December 13th, he was ordained.\n\nIn 1878, a bell was placed in the belfry which was the first church bell in town.\n\nIn 1881 Eld. Cottrell accepted a call to the West Hallock Church in Illinois.\n\nAs soon as this change was decided upon the church extended a call to Eld. H. B. Lewis, of Welton, Iowa, formerly deacon Lewis.\n\nSince his former connection with this church he had been ordained and served as pastor of churches in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Iowa. At this date he is still pastor of the Dodge Center Church.\n\nTHE SABBATH SCHOOL.\n\nFrom a Bible class of only a very few members which was first held in June 1857, associated Bible study has been continued, and for years there has been a flourishing Sabbath school at times numbering about one hundred and twenty-five. Following is a list of the Superintendents: B. F. Bond, Eld. Phineas Crandall, Deacon N. M. Burdick, Deacon H. B. Lewis, H. R. Maxson, Deacon C. Hubbell, Philetus Palmer, A. Jones, S. R. Orcutt, George W. Hills, O. S. Mills, George W. Lewis and Eugene S. Ellis who is the present incumbent.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe church was organized with eleven members, it now numbers one hundred and thirty-six. During its history it has not always met sunshine, but has met clouds as well; several times it has been without a leader, at such times its appointments have been kept up by different members taking the lead of the meetings by turns. It seems that many times the church has been especially blessed of God. Its membership is made up mainly of farming people, by no means rich in worldly goods, but an industrious frugal class of citizens. They differ from the First Day Baptists only in one essential point which difference is implied by the names. The Seventh Day Baptists hold that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment  which was instituted to commemorate creation  is still binding on all Adams posterity. They claim the Bible teaches no change.\n\nDuring the present summer seven have been added to the membership of the church by baptism.\n\nList of Deacons.  Charles Hubbell, H. B. Lewis, N. P. Palmer, N. M. Burdick, H. C. Severance, George W. Hills. The last three mentioned are the present deacons of the church.\n\nList of Clerks.  B. F. Bond, Eli B. Ayers, H. B. Lewis, H. R. Maxson, N.M. Burdick, A. Jones, S. R. Orcutt, O. S. Mills, George W. Lewis, E. A. Sanford, F. E. Tappen and George W. Hills who is the present clerk.\n\nO. S. Mills, a young man attending school at Alfred Center, N.Y., preparing for the ministry, has been licensed by the church to preach.\n\nEld. C. J. Sindall, a Seventh Day Baptist missionary among the Scandinavians in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Dakota, is a member of this church. The church property is worth about three thousand dollars.\n\nMETHODISM IN AND ABOUT DODGE CENTER.\n\nMethodism in the territory now included in Dodge Center Charge, had its beginning many years before the history of the village of Dodge Center began.\n\nThe charge of which Dodge Center was afterward a part included at different times, Concord, Wasioja, Rice Lake, Claremont and Claremont Street, Ellington, and Fairbank School House.\n\nThe first Methodist sermon in this territory, is believed to have been preached by Rev. Nelson Moon, in the village of Concord in 1856. A class was in that year organized by him, which soon numbered 36 members.\n\nConcord was made the head of the circuit, bearing its name, in 1858, Rev. J.M. Rogers preacher in charge, and T. M. Kirkpatrick, presiding elder.\n\nThe name of the circuit was changed to Wasioja in 1859, it being nearer the center of the work, five miles south of Concord. Rev. D. Cobb was Presiding elder and Rev. Jas. H. White preacher in charge. Under the labors of Mr. White a good work of race was begun at Rice Lake, where is now a class of about thirty members.\n\nA church edifice was built here in 1878 under the superin(ten)dency of A. J. Stickles, who still resides near by. It is a well made building of wood, with corner tower and class room valued at $2,000 and no encumbrance.\n\nThe charge was served by the Rev. J. H. Richardson in 1860-1, a part of the next year by Rev. S. A. Smith when he joined the Protestant Methodist, the charge being now left without a pastor. Rev. Henry Goodsell then a local preacher, was employed to fill out the year.\n\nThe conference changes of 1863 sent Rev. Harvey Web to the circuit as preacher in charge, and Rev. Sias Bolles on the district as Presiding elder. In this year a parsonage was purchased in Wasioja for a pastors home.\n\nIn the year 1864-5, Rev. B. Phelps was pastor, and Rev. E. Tucker, Presiding elder. Rev. Norris Hobart served in 1866, the next year John Stafford with Edward Goodman as assistant. Mr. Goodmans health failed when about one half the conference year had passed, leaving all for the preacher in charge. From this time until 1874, the work suffered loss in different ways from which it never fully recovered.\n\nRev. J. B. Williams who became pastor of the charge in 1870, died at his post in Wasioja, and left the flock without a shepherd.\n\nAt the next conference the Rev. Mr. Wheelock a local preacher, was sent but remained only a part of the year, the Rev. C. T. Barkaloo succeeded him at the next conference, but owing to death in his fathers family, he also gave up the work, leaving them again uncared for. No pastor was sent for the two years following.\n\nDuring the year 1874, Rev. R. Forbes, pastor at Kasson, took charge of the Wasioja appointment, and Rev. A. C. Forbes (Principal of the public school at Dodge Center) took charge of Claremont appointment. Rev. W. C. Rice was Presiding elder.\n\nThe Rev. R. Forbes organized the class in Dodge Center in 1873. A church edifice was built soon after and dedicated in 1875, by Rev. J. F. Coffee assisted by Rev. A. Hitchcock and the pastors; Value $3,000.00. In September following the Dodge Center circuit was formed, of Dodge Center, Wasioja, Claremont, and an appointment at Fairbanks School House.\n\nAt the conference in 1875, Rev. J. M. Marsh was made pastor. S. W. T. Right, Presiding elder. Claremont being well supplied by Presbyterians, was abandoned, and Rice Lake again taken into the circuit.\n\nThe conference of 1876 made Dodge Center a station, with I. M. Marsh Pastor. The other points being taken into other charges.\n\nIn 1877 the Rev. S. H. Baker was sent as pastor and served nearly two years. When his health failed, he soon after died, in hope of a blissful immortality beyond the grave.\n\nRev. Geo. H. Waz succeeded as pastor in 1878, D. Cobb, Presiding elder. Mr. Waz was reappointed in 1880, and again in 1881 with Rev. J. P. Okey assistant.\n\nIn 1882 Rev. J. P. Okey was appointed preacher in charge. He was reappointed at the following conference, but was soon removed by Rev. C. N. Stowers, presiding elder.\n\nRev. J. H. Armstrong was employed to fill out the year, but left the charge after a few weeks, when the writer succeeded him.\n\nThe work at present embraces Dodge Center and Rice Lake with a faithful membership of 65 in full membership and 28 probationers at Dodge Center and 32 in full membership at Rice Lake. Both church buildings are in good condition and free from debt. Some improvements have been made upon each this year.\n\nEllington Township\n\nSource: History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties; H. H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884), Chapter XXII; transcribed by Cheryl Quinn\n\nThis political Township organized 11 May 1858, is the northwest Township of the County, and is known as town 108 range 18, west. Previous to it organization it was known as Grove Precinct; its boundaries on the east-Concord Township; on the west, Steel County; on the south, Claremont Township; on the north, Goodhue County. The soil is a rich, black loan of good depth. The surface is quite level, more so than any of the other townships north of the Mantorville branch of the Zumbro River.\n\nThe productions are: wheat, oats, barley, hay, corn, potatoes and flax. It is, also, well adapted to grazing to which many of the farmers are turning their attention.\n\nEllington has very little timber land within her borders. Two hundred acres are considered, by those best able to judge, a fair estimate. There are no streams of any considerable size in the township; on heads on section 8, runs south, forms a junction on section 16, with one that heads on section 30; runs east and forms the Concord branch of Zumbro.\n\nThe population of the township, according to the census of 1880, was 667, consisting largely of four nationalities-American, Irish, German and Norwegian. The native born rank first in population the Irish in the foreign element. The township has good public roads running and intersecting each other at various places, affording the farmer an easy and accessible way to market with his produce. Most of the produce of this township is marketed at Owatonna, in Steele County, and Claremont Station. The Minnesota & Northwestern Railroad has surveyed a line through West Concord, which will be a great advantage to this township, as there will be a station not more than seven and a-half miles from the center of the town, verifying Deacon W.C. Taylors remark that Ellington was seven and a half miles from anywhere.\n\nEARLY SETTLEMENT\n\nThe first permanent settlers that came with their families to the Township of Ellington, were James Harney, William South, John Keith and Daniel Coats. Keith and Coats, with their families, arrived at Ellington on the 6th of August 1855. Harney and South had taken claims previous to this, and had been on them some three weeks when Keith and Coats arrived. These four families constituted the population of Ellington up to May 1st of 1856, when John Sabin, William Ratledge , Sr., William Ratledge Jr., and Abner Stebbins came. In June, 1856, John Beasom came. John Sabin build a log house of south half of section 32, where his wife gave birth, 4 July, to a daughter, who was christened Mary. This was the first child born in the Township of Ellington. In the early spring of 1852, W.C. Taylor, T.J. Hunt, Joseph Miller and John Van Buren arrived. Taylor and Miller took claims on section 3 and 4, Hunt and Van Buren on 9 and 10. Mrs. William Ratledge was the first to be called away to that Bourne from which no traveler returns. Her death occurred in March 1858.\n\nMr. John Neil and Miss Rebecca Ratledge concluded that it would be far easier for two persons than one to run a farm in a new country. They were the first couple to marry. This was in the summer of 1858.\n\nThe first school was taught by Mrs. George Cornwell, in a house belonging to Abner Stebbins, in the summer of 1857. The first school districts organized were: No. 34, April 5, 1858, and No. 29, February 1, 1858. There are now six districts organized in the township-all having good substantial school houses.\n\nIn 1858 a Post office was established at the house of John Van Buren, on section 9, Mr. Van Buren receiving the appointment as Postmaster.\n\nThe first road laid out in the township, by a surveyor, was in 1857, on the section line between sections 31 and 32, running into Claremont Township between sections 5 and6. J. F. Beasom circulated the petition for the same.\n\nElijah Knapp secured the naming of the township after his native town in Connecticut.\n\nThe first election was held at the house of W.C. Taylor on the first Tuesday in November, 1857. Forty votes were cast. A. Towey, J. M. Harney and W. C. Taylor were judges; J. F. Beasom and George Martin, were clerks\n\nThe first election after the admission of the Territory as a State was held at the house of Thomas Fitz Gibbons on section 14, May 11, 1858, with W.C. Taylor, J. F. Beasom and E. Knapp as judges; Edward Jarrett, was the clerk.\n\nIn June, 1858, elder A. P. Graves held divine services at the house of W. C. Taylor. This was the first public worship, and continued from time to time by elder Graves, assisted by elder Shepard, of Wasioja. There was no church building or cemeteries in the township, the Protestant part of the population holding services in the school houses of the different districts; the Catholic people attending church at Owatonna and Claremont Station.\n\nNo business, aside from agriculture, has ever been carried on in Ellington. In favorable seasons it is the Banner wheat township of the County, and this year (1884), it will fully sustain its former record in that direction.\n\nThe following persons have served the town in the capacity of Chairman of Supervisors and town Clerk since its organizations:\n\nThe value of real estate and personal property in the township of Ellington, for the year 1884, according to the assessors returns was as follows: For real estate, $197,954; personal property, $42,622. There was raised in 1883, 25,160 bushels of wheat; 22,420 bushels of oats; 5, 480 bushels of barley, and 5000 bushels of potatoes. The area of the township is 22, 951 acres, only about one half being under cultivation. There is very little waste land in this township -1000 acres will cover all that is not susceptible of cultivation.\n\nFor the number of its inhabitants no township in the county sent more men to the war than did Ellington. In 1860 the population was only 120 all told and in 1865 it had only increased to 201.\n\nHayfield Township\n\nSource: History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties, H. H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884) Chapter XVII; transcribed by Glenda Stevens\n\nThis town, known as Township 105 north, of Range 17 west, is bounded on the north by Ashland, on the east by Vernon, on the south by Mower County, and on the west by Westfield. The surface in most parts of the town, is a smooth rolling prairie. Through the south-western quarter of the town, the Cedar River, a slow, stagnate stream, winds its way. In a few places along this stream there is a small growth of young timber. At the present time thousands of acres of virgin soil lie in the same crude state as when moulded by the hand of nature. This land, owned mostly by speculators, affords an unlimited amount of feed for large herds of cattle from the surrounding country. Many hundred acres of land have been changed from its natural state; its grassy turf has been turned under and the black, loamy soil has received the seed; but man has waited in vain for the fruits of his labor, and has left the land to return to its former state. For miles one can see naught but the smooth surface of the land, or the remains of an old, tumbled down shanty. In other parts of the town the land is cultivated and considerable stock may be seen. The farmers in general, who have continued to till the soil, have planted groves around their houses, which now can be seen for miles away.\n\nEARLY SETTLEMENT.\n\nThe first white men to make homes in this wild place were Ole Erickson and Jens Olson Fossum, who came here in 1866, the former locating on section 14, and the latter on section 21. These pioneers lived for some time in dug-outs before they were able to build for themselves, houses. The next year, 1867, came Hellie Halverson, who located on section 29; Jacob Johnson Ness and a Mr. Swain.\n\nThese men with their ox-teams, broke a small piece on each respective claim, but made no other improvements. The above names men and their families composed the population of the town prior to 1871. At this time Levi Leighton and Hans C. Boysen came to the town; the former locating on section 16 and the latter on section 36. In 1870 William A. Stansfield, from Minneapolis, put up the first frame for a house in the town. It was finished and occupied by Levi Leighton in 1871. In 1870 the total population of the town was but eighteen persons. At the beginning of 1872, it had only been increased by two or three families. Prior to 1872 the town was connected with Vernon, but now the leading men of Hayfield decided to have the towns separated. A town meeting was called for by the town of Hayfield and some of the citizens of the town hired from ten to twelve men each to work for them, and as they were in the town ten days before the town meeting was held, were entitled to vote. The first town meeting was held at the house of Levi Leighton, March 30, 1872. The meeting was called to order by Hans C. Boysen, and the following officers were chosen: Levi Leighton, Chairman of Supervisors; Jens Olson Fossum and Ole Erickson, Associate Supervisors; Hans C. Boyson, Town Clerk; Jens Olson Fossum, Treasurer; Hans C. Boyson, Assessor; Levi Leighton and H. C. Boyson, Justices; J. H. Theyly and Hellek Halverson, Constables; Levi Leighton, Poundmaster. The resolution was introduced by Levi Leighton, to organize the town, which was at once brought before the meeting, and was adopted, the town named and recorded. In the afternoon a large number came from Vernon to oppose the movement, but were too late. The agreement was signed by Levi Leighton, Jens Olson Fossum and Ole Erickson, Supervisors of Hayfield, and Ole Anderson, Reier Reirsen and Peter Johnson, Supervisors of Vernon. At their meeting, the town voted to raise $2,000 for roads and bridges, and $150 for town officers salaries.\n\nThe following is a list of the Supervisors and term Clerks since the organization:\n\nYear\n\nChairmen\n\nAssociate Supervisor\n\nAssociate Supervisor\n\nTown Clerk\n\n1872\n\nLevi Leighton\n\nJens Olson Fossum\n\nOle Erickson\n\nHans C.

In 1876 it voted $200 for roads, and in 1880 voted $200 to pay one-half the expense of building a bridge over the Cedar River, between Hayfield and Westfield Townships. The first road built in the town, was begun at the four corners between sections 16, 17, 20 and 21, running one mile east, on the section line between sections 16 and 21, thence north two miles, between sections 16 and 9 on the west, and 15 and 10 on the east. Soon after this road was extended north on the section line to the north line of the town. The building of other roads soon followed this and at the close of the year, 1874, about twenty miles of good road had been built. Notwithstanding this display of public work, at the present time, many of the section line roads are but mere wagon tracks, while other roads are being worked for the first time this season.\n\nIn the fall of 1872 a school district was organized, embracing the whole town, except four sections in the north-east corner. The first school in the town was taught by Mrs. Levi Leighton, in a house on what is known as the Parsons place, on section 16. This was in the same fall, and the highest number of scholars in attendance was ten. This district was numbered 69, and in 1873 a frame school-house was built on the north side of section 21, about eighty rods west of the north-east corner of the section.\n\nDistrict number 70 was organized in 1877. Five terms of school have been taught here, in a house on the south-east corner of section 2. The first teacher in this district was Charley Tarbol, followed by Anthony Vogel, Addie Rob, Annie Rob and Miss Eva Greenslitt, who is the teacher this summer, having twenty scholars in attendance.\n\nDistrict number 73 was also organized in 1877 and soon after a school-house was built on section 28. No. 74 was organized in 1878, and the first school taught by Charley Fisk. District No. 71 was organized in 1880 and No. 72 soon afterward and school taught in a house on the north line of section 32. The seventh and last district, No. 76, was organized in the spring of 1884 and school taught by Mrs. Adella Battin, in the old Chace house, on section 19, with nineteen pupils. A school-house is contemplated next season.\n\nThe first birth that occurred in this town was that of John Peter Fossum, who was born August 11, 1868. The first death is supposed to be that of Peter Anderson.\n\nA cemetery, belonging to the Lutheran Society of this town, is located on the north-west corner of the south-west quarter of section 22. Several mounds are seen here and one marble slab, denoting the death of Anna Torsness.\n\nThe first threshing machine in this town was run by Peter J. Schwarg, in 1867. The first threshing machine owned in the town was that belonging to Levi Leighton.\n\nTo give the reader some idea of the wildness of the town as late as 1872, an incident is related of Levi Leighton, who was returning home about 9 oclock in the evening, from Mantorville. The night being very dark, and he seeing a light, which he supposed was one his wife had left burning for him, he drove in that direction, and, on coming to the house, found that he was over in the town of Westfield. At another time two ladies, returning home from Dodge Center, were lost, and finally gave the horse its way and the animal took a straight line for home.\n\nThe census taken in 1860, included Hayfield with Vernon. As the number of people in the town in 1870 was only eighteen  included in four families and a like number of dwellings  it is fair to presume that there were none in 1860. In 1864 a valuation of $51,305 was placed upon the 22,812 acres subject to taxation. In 1883 the land assessed included 24,119 acres, at an average valuation of $8.37 per acre, making $201,902 placed on real estate and structures. Seventy-five persons were assessed $21,828 on personal property, making a total basis of taxation of $223,730. The population at the last census was just 500.\n\nKasson.\n\nSource: History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties; H. H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884) transcribed by Sandi King\n\nThe village of Kasson is beautifully located in the southern part of the Township of Mantorville, and is the largest and most important town in the County of Dodge.\n\nIn 1865 the Winona & St. Peter Railroad was completed to this spot, and at that time Jonathan Owen, J. H. Kasson, and J. E. Bunker platted the village of Kasson, and together with the Winona & St. Peter Railroad were joint owners. The station was named in honor of Mr. Kasson.\n\nThe Railroad Company built a freight house in December of that year, which was the first building erected in Kasson. In January, 1866, a large grain elevator, (destroyed by fire in 1871), was built. During the first few weeks after the advent of the railroad, Mr. Kasson's residence and also every other within reach, were crowded to their utmost capacity, until E. A. Goodell built an eating house which he soon sold to Mr. Vincent. During the same period (1865), Messrs. Porter & Van Anden, Jacob Leuthold and Messrs. Patchen & Williams built stores and engaged in the mercantile business. In the autumn of this year, J. J. Wood built a saloon, and Thomas O. McCabe built a hotel.\n\nIn the fall of 1866, the railroad reached Owatonna, thus transferring to that point much of the business that had been crowding the people of Kasson. Owing to this fact, the year 1866 was not a prosperous year for Kasson. But with the aid of an enterprising and rich county around, Kasson steadily grew in size and importance until she is now one of the wide awake, enterprising towns of the county, and commands the trade of a large region of rich country.\n\nDuring the spring of 1867, the Dodge County Republican was established by U. B. Shaver, who has ever since been its sole proprietor. Several additional business houses were also established that season. For several years subsequent, a record was kept by the publisher of the paper, of the buildings erected and amount of mercantile business transacted, which, if not mathematically correct, approximates very nearly the absolute figures.\n\nIn the month of January, 1866, a postoffice was established, and Alonzo Patchen was appointed postmaster. The amount of capital employed in building this year, including the railroad buildings, was estimated at $25,000.\n\nThe amount of capital employed in building during the year 1867, amounted to $24,230 and the number of buildings erected was thirty-oneall residences but four. During the same year, a capital of $98,000 was employed in the mercantile, farm-machine and miscellaneous branches of trade. The amount of wheat shipped during the year, from Kasson station, foots up on the railroad books at 250,000 bushels. Up to this year Kasson never had a resident physician; but before its close a doctor, lawyer and printer were added; also the first drug store of the place.\n\nThe capital employed in building during the year 1868 amounted to $35,000, and the number of buildings erected was forty-eight. The amount of general merchandise and agricultural machinery sold foots up at $236,500. This estimate was drawn directly from the sales books of the merchants, and is undoubtedly very correct. A plow factory, under the auspices of an incorporated company, with a capital stock of $10,000, commenced operations, but owing to inexperience and mismanagement, the corporation went into insolvency and its business was wound up in a few months. This was the first failure of any magnitude in the village. More than ordinary attention was paid this year to the erection of private residences, which clearly proved that the citizens were contented with their business and with the country and intended to stay.\n\nThe capital employed in building during the year 1869, amounted to $18,500quite a falling off from the preceeding year. The number of buildings erected was twenty-six. The amount of goods sold of all kinds, was $212,400exclusive of agricultural machinery, of which we have no record this year.\n\nA gradual and increasing thrift characterized the years 1870 and 1871 and brought us to the era of building with brick. A healthy accession was made to the village in population and wealth, and it now ranked with first-class, live western towns.\n\nIn the year 1872, a capital of $45,300 was expended in building operations, and $300,000 employed in mercantile pursuits, and many thousand dollars employed in mechanical branches, and agricultural machinery trade. In the fall of this year a new weekly paper was started, called The Kasson Telegraph, under the auspices of the Democratic party of the county. N. E. Lemon was the editor and proprietor, assisted by A. DeLacy Wood. The paper was published regularly about two years; then it was discontinued for want of support.\n\nThe year 1873 was one of unusual thrift, more money being employed in building operations than during any previous year. Messrs. Porters' fine two story brick block 44x80, was completed, having been commenced the preceding year.\n\nWe will advert, in a general way, to the most conspicuous buildings subsequently built.\n\nJ. Leuthold erected two fine brick stores, one of which replaced a wooden structure lost by fire. Lyman Gerould & Co. erected a very fine block 44x100 feet, built of red brick and trimmed with Milwaukee white brick and fine cut stone. The lower story contains two stores, and a room 22x44 suitable for an office. The second story contains several convenient rooms and a Hall capable of seating 500 people, supplied with a stage and drop curtain for theatrical and concert work. It is known as Coolidge Hall.\n\nA steam mill was built this year (1873) with five run of stone, which cost $27,000; a church at a cost of $5,000, and over forty wooden residences and business buildings.\n\nThe First National Bank building was erected in 1874, at a cost of about $7,000.\n\nPerny's Block is one of the finest structures in the city. It is 44x110 feet, tastily built of white and red brick, two stories high, containing two stores, a photograph gallery, a public hall, and a printing office.\n\nBeyond those above enumerated, the town contains eight brick business houses.\n\nWalker's Hotel, on the corner of Owen and Main Streets, is a commodious structure built of wood and brick, two stories high, with basement, and is well kept as a hotel by the proprietor.\n\nKasson has three grain elevators, each doing a fine business.\n\nThe elevator built by the Winona & St. Peter Railway Company in 1871 adjoins the railway track, opposite Atkins Street, and has a storage capacity of nearly forty thousand bushels.\n\nA commodious and handsome school house, 64x80 feet, was built in 1879, and consumed in 1882, now rebuilt of handsome red brick, with cut stone trimmings. It contains a seating capacity for 500 pupils. It is constructed with all the modern conveniences, and is an ornament to the village.\n\nFirst National Bank of Kasson\n\nThis institution was organized August 4th, 1874, by David Anthony, Edward E. Fairchild, A. L. Porter, Jacob Leuthold, and others. The first of these gentlemen was president, and the second cashier, and with the others named constituted the Board of Directors. A charter was granted for twenty years' business, with a capital of fifty thousand dollars. On the death of David Anthony in 1877, Tunis S. Slingerland was made president, and has so continued ever since. Mr. Fairchild has been cashier during the entire existence of the bank. The bank building, on the northwest corner of Owen and Main Streets, was erected and occupied in 1874. It is of solid brick, two stories and basement, built at a cost of nine thousand dollars. The business has prospered, and the surplus now exceeds one half of the capital, while the original investment has been returned to the stockholders in dividends. The present Board of Directors is composed of T. S. Slingerland, A. L. Porter, E. K. Proper, J. E. Bunker, Perry Nelson, Mrs. A. W. Anthony, and E. E. Fairchild.\n\nThe vault of this establishment is said to be one of the best and most commodious to be found in country banks. Its floor is composed of a single flagstone, and the walls are two feet in thickness. The safe is provided with a Yale time clock, and is second to none in southern Minnesota.\n\nA private banking business was begun here in 1870 by David Anthony, who, in 1871, built a frame building for carrying on the business on the site at present occupied by the bank. It was moved back, and now occupies the rear of the lot.\n\nIn November, 1865, the track of the Winona & St. Peter Railroad was completed between Winona and Kasson, and trains began running to this point.\n\nDuring the summer a village had been platted, as above related. It embraced one hundred acres on the southwest quarter, and twenty acres each on the northeast and northwest quarters, all of section 33. Additions covering over seventy-five acres have since been made by various parties.\n\nOn the 24th of February, 1870, an act incorporating the village of Kasson was approved and took effect. The territory embraced within the incorporated village covers one and one-half miles, viz.; the east half of section 32 and all of 33. In accordance with the act, an election was held under the supervision of Jonathan Owen, J. H. Kasson, and John E. Bunker, on the first Monday in April, 1870, and they have been since regularly held on the first Monday of each April. No record can now be found of this meeting, but the village records show action during the year of the following officers: president, W. S. Dibble; trustees. A. Bryan, William Wheeler, Jacob Leuthold; recorder, Libbens White.\n\nThe principal officers chosen at succeeding electiions are given as followspresident first, trustees following, and recorder last:\n\n1871.W. S. Dibble, A. Bryan, Jacob Leuthold, William Wheeler, Hiram Hatch.\n\n1872.H. H. Atherton, L. Gerould, A. Bryan, Jacob Leuthold, H. Hatch.\n\n1873.William R. Powers, H. S. Works, J. H. Kasson, J. Bryan, G. A. Milliken. On the 23rd of June, R. J. Perry was appointed recorder in place of Milliken, resigned; and September 12th, W. S. Dibble was appointed president in place of Powers.\n\n1874.W. S. Dibble, M. M. Prindle, Jonathan Owen, John Fern, R. J. Perry.\n\n1875.A. L. Porter, A. B. Huntley, John Fern, D. O. Brewer, R. J. Perry.\n\n1876.D. O. Brewer, G. H. Storing, W. E. Porter, David Anthony, August E. Anderson.\n\n1877.D. O. Brewer, George H. Storing, A. B. Huntley, J. Leuthold, A. E. Anderson.\n\n1878.L. S. Peck, William Wheeler, Patrick Devlin, Joseph Lowry, Elling Anderson.\n\n1879.W. Wheeler, L. G. Nelson, J. Bedient, John T. Little, E. Johnson.\n\n1880.L. G. Nelson, A. L. Porter, James A. Walker, J. Worhty, E. G. Edgerton.\n\n1881.J. Grinnell, G. W. Garrison, J. Bedient, C. G. Ingham, J. M. Clement.\n\n1882.G. H. Storing, J. Leuthold, Edward Wilson, E. G. Edgerton, H. D. Austin.\n\n1883.Same, except P. Devlin in place of Edgerton.\n\n1884.George B. Arnold, R. P. Allen, G. F. Nitcy, P. Devlin, Andrew P. Brobech. Treasurer, A. A. Johnson; justice, August E. Anderson; constable, Peter Vogel.\n\nIn 1870, the population of Kasson was 515, and the village was steadily growing. At this time, Mantorville numbered 622 souls, and both hamlets were enjoying prosperous business relations. The census of 1875 gave the latter village a population of 469, while Kasson had grown to 923. From this time, the latter has been the acknowledged business center of the county, although its growth has been less rapid since. The last enumeration, in 1880, showed its people to number 1,054 souls, and this is probably but little changed at the present writing. In 1880, Mantorville's population was 477, a number which closely approximates that of the present. It is a noticeable fact that the population of Mantorville township outside of the villages was the same in both 1870 and 1880, being 832.\n\nKasson Churches\n\nMethodist Episcopal Church.In the month of December, 1855, a methodist mission was established at the village of Mantorville. The records, however, have been lost, so that the names of pastor, and the original members, cannot now be given. In October, 1856, Rev. Nelson Moon was appointed pastor. His health having failed, at the expiration of six months, a local preacher, Rev. D. L. King, now of Byron, Olmsted County, was appointed to fill out the unexpired term.\n\nThe records of the county clerk show that on the 13th of October, 1856, Rev. N. Moon appointed the following persons as trustees of the temporal affairs of the church: D. L. King, John P. Cram, E. W. Geere, Lyman Alden, Daniel Grable, Josiah Cherrington and Joshua Whipple. These are all the names of early members that can be found, and these individuals were scattered over a wide range of country.\n\nIn the year 1860, the stone church of Walnut street, Mantorville, (now owned and occupied by the congregational society) was built. The building was dedicated to the worship of God on Sunday, Feb. 2d, 1868. Pastors were regularly appointed to the mission, until 1860, Kasson having in the meantime sprung up,when the name of the mission was changed to Mantorville circuit, a few members of the mission having removed to the new village. A class was organized here July 22d, 1871, and was included in the new circuit.\n\nThus the M. E. Church in this village, was an outgrowth of the Mantorville mission, and the first pastor, was Rev. B. F. Kemp, who served the church in that capacity for two years. He was followed by Rev. H. O. McNiff, one year, Rev. R. Forbes, three years. During the pastorate of Mr. McNiff, the church building was commenced.\n\nThe work was completed by Rev. R. Ferris, and duly opened by Rev. J. F. Chaffee.\n\nFrom this time on the history of the church has been somewhat varied.\n\nThe membership at Mantorville in the meantime had been gradually decreasing, while at Kasson it was upon the increase and in October, 1874, the Methodist services at Mantorville, were discontinued, and Kasson being the \"head of the circuit,\" from it the preacher radiated, to the different points in the county, where the Methodist people could be gathered together for service.\n\nIn the latter part of the year 1874, the classes that had been formed, and were adjunct to the Kasson church were set off in a circuit of their own and Kasson raised to the dignity of a station, with R. Ferris as Pastor, and the following persons constituting the first \"board of trustees\" viz:\n\nR. J. Perry, D. K. Dibble, C. B. Calhoun, J. H. Kasson, W. F. Barker, M. Ely, S. T. Jones, Dan'l Anthony, and Aaron Wallrath.\n\nIn 1875, the debt on the church was $1,073.\n\nTho society, yet owning a neat stone church at Mantorville decided through its board of trustees, to dispose of that property, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the debt here,the interests of the denomination having been moved to this place.\n\nThe property was sold to the Congregationalists for $600.\n\nSubscriptions were then taken to pay the remaining indebtedness, but these were not collected, and various repairs having been made, the debt kept increasing: so that the close of Rev. L. Gilbert's pastorate, in 1879, found the church in debt $600.\n\nThe pastorate of Rev. E. R. Lathrop was from 1879 to 1881. He was followed by Rev. A. Cressy for one year. During these years, the church had fallen into financial embarrassment, from which it did not recover until during the pastorate of Rev. L. H. Shumate the present incumbent. A determined effort was then made to lift the indebtedness of $700.\n\nOf this amount the Sabbath school paid over $200 and the balance was secured by personal subscriptions and by means of a lecture course during the winter of 1883-4.\n\nThe church now stands free of all encumberance, and is at the present writing undergoing extensive repairs.\n\nThe society numbers sixty-five members, many who formerly belonged, have moved away, and the immigration has not been particularly of the methodist persuasion.\n\nThe congregations are good, and are composed largely of persons not members of church, but who are friendly with, and throw their influence to the methodists.\n\nThat the church is one of intelligence is recognized from the fact that some of her ministers in the past few years, have been among the most prominent in the annual conference.\n\nThe church, building is conventiently located, on the northwest corner of Smith and Owen streets, is a neat frame 38x52, with a tower at the corner. The tower and spire are recognized, as being unusually graceful, and requests are frequently made of the trustees for plans, and specifications.\n\nThe Sabbath school, is among the successful institutions of this church.\n\nRoman Catholic Church.But few families of this faith dwell in the section of country tributary to Kasson. As early as 1865, Father O'Gorman, of Rochester, began holding services here in private houses and in the log school house where several of Kasson's religious bodies were first organized. In 1875 a few of the energetic parishioners determined to build a church which should be a credit to their sect and to the town. They did so before the close of the year, locating the building on Mantorville street, corner of First. It is a frame building, exceeding any other church in the village in size, and cost $2,300. It is yet in an unfinished state, although services are held in it once a month. Through the financial weakness of the Society here, the building was at one time sold under a mortgage, but the title is now in the Bishop of the diocese.\n\nPresbyterian Church.The attention of the Presbytery of Southern Minnesota having been called to Kasson as a growing place and a promising point for the establishment of a church, the Rev. Sheldon Jackson and Elder Newhall, of Ashland, were appointed as a committee to visit Kasson and organize a church if the way be clear.\n\nOn Sabbath the 6th of May, 1866, said committee organized the following persons into a Presbyterian Church:\n\nMrs. Mary Williams and Miss Abby Williams, by letters from the Presbyterian church of Winona, Minn.; Mrs. Margaret Owen, by letter from Presbyterian church of Decora, Wisconsin.\n\nThe services were held in the little log school house, which was filled to overflowing. In the same afternoon a Sabbath-school was organized.\n\nMr. Jackson had previously visited the place for Missionary purposes. On the 3rd of June he held the first communion service. Mrs. Hannah Young was received into the church by letter from the United Brethren church, and Mrs. J. E. Bunker by baptism and confession of faith.\n\nDuring the winter of 1867, the church was supplied, in connection with Ashland, Claremont and Eyota, by the Rev. H. A. Mayhew, residing at Rochester.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, Rev. John L. Gage took charge of the church and by the help of personal friends in Ohio, and the friends of the cause in Kasson, secured the erection of the plain church edifice which the congregation has since occupiedsharing its use with other denominations for several years.\n\nIn the early part of 1869, the church enjoyed refreshing from the presence of the Lord.\n\nIn the spring of 1869, Mr. Gage gave up the field. Since he left the church has enjoyed the ministry of Rev. E. P. Whalen, one year; Rev. W. W. Easman, one year, and Rev. J. Jerome Ward, ten years. The last named is still with them in his Pastoral work.\n\nThe entire number upon the church record is sixty-nine, of whom thirty-five were received by letter, and thirty-four on profession. Four have been ordained to the eldership, to wit: J. E. Bunker, E. G. Rice, J. W. Cloyes, and J. S. Shuck. The first three are still in office in this church.\n\nDeath and dismissals have taken thirty-five from the roll, leaving thirty-four as the present number.\n\nThe church edifice stands on the north-east corner of Smith and Owen streets, on land donated for the purpose by J. W. Palmiter, owner of the plat, and is the first built in Kasson.\n\nBaptist Church.In the summer of 1866, Kasson had acquired some population, and that Baptist pioneer, Rev. Erastus Wescott, set about organizing a church society here. A meeting was held pursuant to notice, on the 21st of July, 1866, in a log school house that stood near what is now Mantorville street. Rev. Wescott was made moderator of the meeting, and prayer was offered by Salmon Wedge. H. M. and A. B. Bradley handed in letters from the Baptist church at Dansville, New York, and Amelia Pease, from Concord church, this county. The following, formerly in communion with New York churches, handed in letters from the church at Byron: William and Lydia Cornell, Ira and Sarah Cotton, Caleb C. and Lettie Cotton, Eunice M. Cornell.\n\nIt was voted to adopt the New Hampshire confession of faith and church covenant. Samuel Bowen, formerly a member of the M. E. Church, was admitted on experience, and the little band started out with a membership of eleven persons. Rev. William C. Shedd, a pioneer in church work in the county, gave an address, and a prayer and conference meeting followed. Ballots were taken for deacon and clerk, resulting in the choice of William Cornell and Samuel Bowen for these respective offices. It was decided to hold covenant meetings once in four weeks.\n\nAt the next meeting, Salmon Wedge was admitted to membership on experience. The third and fourth covenant meetings were held at Mantorville. At the first of these, Humphrey and Harriet Van Ornum were received by letters; and at the other, Caroline A. Potter and Mary Van Ornum were admitted in the same way.\n\nRev. E. Wescott was the first pastor in charge. After him, Rev. Walter Ross ministered four years, and Rev. George N. Annis three years. After that the Society was without a pastor for some time. In the spring of 1884, Rev. P. W. Fuller was installed pastor, and the church gives evidence of life and vigor. A Sunday school has been maintained, and served as an active factor in the upbuilding and maintenance of church interests.\n\nNinety-seven persons have been admitted to membership in the Society. Of this number seventy-three were received by letter, fourteen by baptism, and ten upon testimony of experience. Thirty-nine have been discharged by letter, and the present membership numbers forty souls.\n\nA lot for a church site was donated by J. W. Palmiter, proprietor of a part of the town site. It is situated on the south-west corner of Perry and Owen streets. At a meeting on the 30th of January, 1875, the following persons were appointed a building committee, to secure the erection of a church edifice: M. M. Prindle, E. Whitford, John Clark and Smith Bowen. On the 29th of May following, it was voted to stake out the ground and let the contract for a brick building. By the close of that year the edifice was completed, having cost, with furniture, $4,000. Its superficial area is 56x33 feet, with belfry projection of six feet in front. The auditorium is eighteen feet high, and will seat 250 people. The only church bell in the village is suspended in the tower, and the building is the handsomest and most substantial. Much of the work in building was done by members, and the cost was thereby very materially reduced. The edifice was dedicated to the worship of God on the first Sunday in March, 1876, Rev. Walter Ross pastor in charge. Previous to this meetings were held jointly with the Presbyterians, in the edifice of the latter, for some time, and afterward the Baptists maintained services in Coolidge Hall.\n\nSt. Peter's Episcopal Church.In the early fall of 1866, Rev. P. S. Ruth, Rector of St. John's parish at Mantorville, began to hold occasional services according to the rites of the Episcopal church in the log school house on Mantorville Street. Two years later a small Sunday school was organized at the house of Halvor Toliffson, under the instruction of Mrs. Ethel Huntley. The first communicants of the Episcopal church here under Rev. Ruth's ministration were Mr. and Mrs. Toliffson and Mrs. Huntley, and additions to the class were made from time to time, as the village grew in population. It was at first called St. Peter's Mission, and Mr. Ruth continued as rector until 1870. For three years succeeding services were occasionally held by the students and clergy of Seabury divinity school of Faribault.\n\nIn 1873, Rev. Charles Grosser took charge of the parish and mission at Mantorville and Kasson. In September of that year, the corner stone of a church edifice was laid in Kasson by Dr. Ritchie, warden of Seabury Hall. During the next year, the building was completed, and Mr. Grosser went away. The church is a frame structure standing on the northwest corner of Bunker and Dodge Streets, and has not been occupied regularly all of the time. The only service held in it during 1883 was on the 8th of July, conducted by Rev. A. A. Abbott, of Seabury Hall.\n\nOn the 24th of February, 1877. it was voted to organize a separate church, and the consent of the bishop was granted two days later. On the first of May following, Bishop Whipple consecrated the church building under its present name. The first resident clergyman was Rev. James Cornell, who remained about a year. He was succeeded in June, 1878, by Rev. Robert Reed Goudy, who continued in charge up to Easter, 1880. From August 1st of that year to October 1st, 1882, Rev. Charles F. Coerr took charge.\n\nThe first baptism occurred August 22nd, 1875, and the total number during the life of the society is twenty-five. Twelve confirmations have been made in the same time. At present the membership is small, but services have been frequently held during 1884.\n\nThe Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church.Immediately prior to and following the year 1860, doctrinal questions of great importance agitated the Scandinavian Lutherans of this country. The first of these was what was known as the Sunday question, followed by the slavery question, the nature of which is well known to every Scandinavian.\n\nPrevious to this time there existed three distinct Scandinavian Lutheran denominations in the United States, but after a long series of conventions and debates on the above-named questions, the fourth denomination was formed, known as the Norwegian-Danish Conference. To this last-named denomination, the congregation called \"The Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of Kasson\" belonged. It was organized March 24th, 1873, by Rev. O. Amundson, who afterwards became its pastorfor about a year and a half. During this time services were held in the Presbyterian Church in Kasson.\n\nThe membership at the time of organization was as follows:\n\nT. O. Hall, Henry Ruhberg, John Anderson, Christ. Clemmetsen, Hans O. Bakken, Emil Hanson, Hans Rasmuson, Soren Kuntson, Soren Sorenson, Nils C. Christensen, A. Holtermann, Jens Anderson, Peder Jensen, Hendrik Bahlke, Nils Bahlke, Peder Jensen, Christian A. Ruhberg, Jens Pederson, Hellik Lampeland, John Anderson, Hans Sorensen, Peder Pederson, Gunder Johnson, Anders Jensen, Christian Anderson, Enevold Sorenson and August E. Anderson; to which was afterwards added the name sof Ole B. Larson, Peder Scott, Peder Thoreson, Marinus Nelson and Edward Wilson.\n\nAfter a lapse of about half a year without a pastor, Rev. Amundson having gone to some other place, Rev. Gjertsen, of Rochester, became the permanent pastor with a fixed salary of one hundred dollars a year, services being fixed at once a month.\n\nRev. Gjertsen continued in the capacity of pastor until 1879, about four years, when he was called to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he now resides.\n\nIn the year 1875, the congregation commenced the erection of a church building, which was finished during the year, at a cost of about one thousand dollars, after which services were held regularly in the church building thus erected, until the leaving of Rev. Gjertsen.\n\nSince 1879 till 1884 there has been no permanent pastor and no regular services, Rev. Blegen, of Rochester, and others having at times visited the congregation.\n\nThe membership is very much decreased, so that at the present writing only about four families remain out of thirty-four that originally belonged, the close times having made it necessary for laboring men to move out of the village for work which could not be obtained here.\n\nKasson Societies.\n\nWoman Suffrage Association of Kasson.In the spring of 1876, seven earnest women, zealots for the elevation of their sex and believing that \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,\" met at the residence of Mrs. H. M. White in Kasson, and organized a society with the following named officers: president, Mrs. M. P. Wheeler; vice-president, Mrs. A. W. Anthony; secretary, Mrs. J. S. Perry; treasurer, Mrs. H. M. White.\n\nThe society was organized with a code of articles and by-laws which have been amended from time to time as necessity required.\n\nIts work has been to obtain suffrage literature and to distribute the same; and, with the means in its control, obtain lecturers for the cause, never neglecting to petition our legislature to extend the franchise to women in all municipal affairs.\n\nThe society was organized prior to the state organization, but is now auxiliary to that society, with an increased membership and a larger curriculum for work, having enrolled since organizaiton about one hundred names.\n\nThe officers for 1884 are: president, Mrs. N. A. Taylor; vice-president, Mrs. E. S. Willyard; secretary, Miss M. A. Grinnell; treasurer, Miss M. E. Gerould.\n\nThe fundamental principles of the organization are set forth in the following preamble and constitution:\n\n\"We maintain that the constitution of the United States is not the just, grand, and unimpeachable instrument it should be; and that it never will be, until it has a 16th amendment which shall forever secure to women the same rights of suffrage, which are already given to men.\n\nIn order to obtain this amendment, we have only to show Congress, and the Legislatures that the majority of intelligent women desire it, and would faithfully use the ballot in aid of every good cause, if allowed to do so. We cannot, however, bring out this sentiment among women except by agitating the question of equal rights among them, organizing Woman Suffrage Societies, and thereby educating all concerning the merits of this great question;\" constitution follows:\n\nArt. 1st. This organization shall be called the Women Suffrage Club.\n\nArt. 2d. The business of this club shall be to arrange direct or transact such matters as may be necessary in connection with and for the furtherance of the interests and honor of women\n\nArt. 3d. Any person signing this constitution and contributing thirty cents quarterly shall be considered a member with the right to participate in its deliberations.\n\nArt. 4th. The officers of this club shall be a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer to be elected annually.\n\nArt. 5th. This constitution may be amended by a majority of those members present at any regular meeting.\n\nBy-Laws.\n\nIn all business this club shall proceed according to the following by-laws.\n\nArt. 1st. The club shall be called to order by the president, or in her abscence by the vice-president.\n\nArt. 2d. The minutes of the last meeting shall then be read and adopted.\n\nArt. 3d. Committees shall report.\n\nArt. 4th. Appoint place for next meeting and committee on literary entertainment.\n\nArt. 5th. Reading and other entertainment as provided by committee.\n\nArt. 6th. These by-laws may be amended or suspended at any regular meeting of the club by a majority vote of members present.\n\nArt. 7th. Five members shall constitute a quorum to transact business.\n\nTabernacle Chapter, No. 18, Royal Arch Masons.This chapter was instituted at Mantorville, Feb. 1st, 1870, under dispensation, to the following members:\n\nA. J. Ederton, H. P.\n\nJ. A. Garver, K.\n\nGrove B. Cooley, S.\n\nJ. R. Dartt, P. S.\n\nAbner Remington, R. A. C.\n\nAlfred Brown, Treas.\n\nLyman Gerould, C. H.\n\nJohn P. Rodman, M. 3d. V.\n\nJoseph Lowry, M. 1st. V.\n\nAlvah Crampton\n\nJames S. Decker, M. 2d. V\n\nSamuel Lord\n\nWilliam McMicken, Sec'y.\n\nJanuary 10th, 1871, a charter was granted, and the chapter has steadily grown in numbers and influence since. The register shows ninety-three members, of whom fifty-two are now in good standing. Meetings continued to be held at Mantorville until near the close of the year 1877. At a regular meeting on the 15th of November, that year, it was unanimously voted to remove to Kasson, and in accordance with a petition to the grand chapter the location of Tabernacle chapter was changed from Mantorville to Kasson, Dec. 1st, 1877. It was located in the second story of a building on the southwest corner of Keyes and Dodge streets, where it has ever since continued. A removal at an early day to more elegant quarters is now contemplated.\n\nIn accordance with a call issued by A. L. Porter, under dispensation granted by the grand chapter in November, 1876, a meeting was held at Masonic Hall in Kasson, on the 22d of that month, to organize Kasson chapter, R. A. M. The following officers were installed: A. L. Porter, H. P.; Hiram Hatch, K.; Lyman Gerould, S.; Henry George, C. H.; U. B. Shaver, P. S.; J. G. Wheeler, R. A. C,; John Fern, M. 3d. V.; A. Landers, M. 2d. V.; S. B. Owen, M. 1st. V.; J. P. Rodman, Treas.; A. Remington, Sec.; J. Lowry, Sentinel. This chapter continued to work under dispensation until the removal of Tabernacle chapter to Kasson, when the former was merged into the latter.\n\nOn the 26th of December, 1883, the following officers were installed: G. B. Arnold, H. P.; A. A. Johnson, O. K.; A. La Due, S.; Michael Trantman, C. H.; J. P. Rodman, Treas.; J. Grinnell, Sec.; Dell South, P. S.; John Fern, R. A. C.; Peter Jenson, M. 3d. V.; U. B. Shaver, M 2d V.; Wesley H. Decker, M. 1st. V.; A. Thomas, Sentinel.\n\nHuram A Bi Lodge, No. 33, A. F. & A. M. About Jan. 1st, 1870, a number of masons petitioned the grand lodge of the State of Minnesota for the establishment of a lodge at Kasson. Accordingly, on the 12th of January, that year, a charter was granted to A. L. Porter, M.; W. R. Huntley, S. W. and W. S. Dibble, J. W.\n\nOn the evening of January 27th, a stated convocation was held in William Spencer's warehouse, now the American House, and in addition to the above the following officers were installed:\n\nJ. P. Rodman, Treas.; Hiram Hatch, Sec,; Lyman Gerould, C.; Seth Johnson, S. D.; J. G. Wheeler, J. D.: A. B. Huntley and W. F. Dunham, Stewards; J. H. Cressy, Tyler.\n\nSince the organization 125 members have been initiated, and sixty-five are now in good standing. The lodge occupies Masonic Hall jointly with the Tabernacle chapter. This is probably the only lodge in the State which began existence under a charter, without having first worked under dispensation. It has steadily progressed, and is in excellent financial condition, as is also the chapter.\n\nThe officers installed Dec. 27th, 1883, were: H. D. Austin, W. M.; M. Trantman, S. W.; G. B. Arnold, J. W.; J. Grinnell, Treas.; R. A. Moses, Sec.; R. H. Allen, S. D.; D. W. Currier, S. S.; John Mayhew, J. S.; A. Thomas, Tyler.\n\nKasson Lodge No. 45, I. O. O. F.Among the secret and benevolent institutions in Kasson, Oddfellowship holds a conspicuous place. Its mission differs from other societies in many essentials, and therefore fills a place in the community that no other organization could fully supply.\n\nThe lodge named at the head of this sketch was instituted by the R. W. Grand Master of the State, J. C. Brewer, assisted by the officers of the Rochester Lodge, No. 13, on the 17th day of July, A. D. 1874, with the following officers who were charter members:\n\nWilliam Lowe\n\nN. G.\n\nCharles H. Thompson\n\nV. G.\n\nErastus P. Le Suer\n\nR. S.\n\nThomas G. Anderson\n\nP. S.\n\nSamuel T. Jones\n\nTreasurer\n\nThe remaining offices were supplied as rapidly as members were acquired from which to supply them.\n\nThe night of the organization, Washington Hase and William Matthewson, were initiated and received the degrees.\n\nAn adjourned or special meeting was held the next night (July 18th, 1874), at which time the first committee on finance was appointed, consisting of Erastus P. Le Suer, Charles H. Thompson, and Washington Hase. The first D. H. G. M. was Erastus P. Le Suer, whose appointment was dated July 25th, 1874.\n\nU. B. Shaver, Peter J. Schway, and Anton Miller having joined by card, were, on the 1st of August, 1874, appointed respectively, Conductor, Warden, and R. S. N. G.\n\nOle B. Larson having joined by card, was appointed, on the 22nd of August, L. S. V.
