        "text": "DODGE CENTER, Minn. (KTTC) – Traffic impacts on Highway 14 began Sunday as the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) plans its road improvement project between Byron and Dodge Center.\n\nAccording to MnDOT, Highway 14 will reduce to one lane in each direction between 200th Avenue and 260th Avenue. It stated drivers from County Road 9 will no longer be able to turn left onto the highway. There will also be detours in place at the area between0 Highway 14 and Highway 57 in Kasson.\n\nMnDOT District 6 Engineer Mark Schoenfelder explained the project will bring safety improvements for travelers. “We’re constructing a J turn out at Dodge County 9,” he said. “In addition, we’re adding the high tension cable median barrier between Byron out west to Kasson.”\n\nMnDOT shared the project will upgrade the Road Weather Information System site near Byron and resurface pavements between Kasson and Byron. It stated the construction will improve drainage in the area and rehabilitate the Highway 14 bridges over Highway 57.\n\nMnDOT Spokesperson Michael Dougherty reminds everyone to drive slow and be attentive near work zones. He stated he understands people wish to drive more with the nice weather outside.\n\n“It’s sort of that transition season where the roads are clear. There’s not much going on and suddenly things are changing. The signs are popping up the construction. So it’s a change in any of us. When we’re encountering change, it’s a little, you know, unsettling.”\n\nSchoenfelder explained the road projects are planned ultimately for driver and worker safety.\n\n“A lot of times, the folks that get injured in a work zone are the traveling public,” He said. “There’s heavy equipment, large equipment that our contractors use, but we still want to make sure our workers are safe—that they go home every night and we want to make sure the traveling public is safe.”\n\nMnDOT anticipated the J turn construction to wrap up by the end of June. The overall project is expected to be completed late summer.\n\nFind stories like this and more, in our apps."
