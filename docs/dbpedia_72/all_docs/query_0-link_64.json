        "text": "Geographic Names\n\n[Source: Minnesota Geographic Names: Their Origin and Historic Significance, Vol. 17, by Warren Upham, 1920, page 171-173; transcribed by Robin Line]\n\nEstablished February 20, 1855, this county received its name in honor of Henry Dodge, governor of Wisconsin, and his son, Augustus C. Dodge, of Iowa.\n\nHenry Dodge was born in Vincennes, Indiana, October 12, 1782; and died in Burlington, Iowa, June 19, 1867. He served in the war of 1812; was a colonel of volunteers in the Black Hawk war, 1832; commanded an expedition to the Rocky mountains in 1835; was governor of Wisconsin territory and superintendent of Indian affairs, 1836-41; delegate in Congress for Wisconsin, 1842-6; again governor of that territory, 1845-8; and was one of the first U. S. senators from the state of Wisconsin, 1848-57.\n\nGovernor Dodge on July 29, 1837, at Fort Snelling, then in Wisconsin, made a treaty with the Ojibways, by which they ceded to the United States all their pine lands and agricultural lands on the upper part of the St. Croix river and its tributaries, in the present states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. The tract ceded also reached west to include the upper part of the basin of Rum river, and onward to the Mississippi between Sauk Rapids and the mouth of Crow Wing river. In September of the same year, under direction of Governor Dodge, about twenty chiefs and braves of the Sioux went with the agent, Major Taliaferro, to the city of Washington and there made a treaty ceding all their lands east of the Mississippi, together with the islands in this river. By these treaties a large tract of eastern Minnesota (then a part of Wisconsin), including the sites of St. Paul and St. Anthony, was opened to white settlement.\n\nAugustus Caesar Dodge was born in St. Genevieve, Missouri, January 12, 1812; and died in Burlington, Iowa, November 20, 1883. He was the delegate in Congress for Iowa territory, 1840-7; was one of the first U. S. senators of Iowa, 1848-55; his father being also a senator at the same time; and was minister representing this country in Spain during four years, 1855-9.\n\nBiographies of both the father and son, with their portraits, by Louis Pelzer, have been published, respectively in 1911 and 1908, by the State Historical Society of Iowa, in its Iowa Biographical Series.\n\nTOWNSHIPS AND VILLAGES.\n\nFor the origins and meaning of the geographic names of this county, information has been gathered from \"An Historical Sketch of Dodge County,\" by W. H. Mitchell and U. Curtis, 1870, 125 pages; \"History of Winona Olmsted and Dodge Counties,\" 1884 (this county having pages (769-1266); \"Atlas of Dodge County,\" by R. L. Polk and Co., 1905, having pages 61-129 of text, historical and biographic, with illustrations; and from the offices of George L. Taylor, county auditor, and George H. Slocum, editor of the Mantorville Express, visited in April, 1916.\n\nASHLAND township, first settled in May, 1854, organized June 15, 1858, was named from its original village plat in 1855 by William Windom, Thomas Wilson, and Daniel S. Norton, of Winona, with others. Each of the three proprietors here noted, then new immigrants to this territory, afterward attained great prominence in Minnesota history. This name, applied to townships, villages, cities, and counties, occurs in twenty-six other states of our Union.\n\nBERN, a former post office in Milton, established in 1858, was named for the capital of Switzerland.\n\nBUCHANAN, formerly a small village having a sawmill, on the North Middle branch of the Zumbro river, was named in honor of James Buchanan, elected in 1856 to the presidency of the United States.\n\nCANISTEO township, settled in 1854 and organized in 1858, was named by its numerous immigrants from Canisteo, a village and a township in Steuben county, N. Y,, on the Canisteo river, which is about sixty miles long, flowing to the Tioga and Chemung rivers, the latter a tributary of the Susquehanna. An early village there, of the Delaware tribe of Indians, was called Canisteo, being the origin of this name, said to mean \"board on the water.\" This Indian village was described as \"the largest of the Delaware towns, consisting of sixty good houses with three or four fire-places in each.\" (Roberts, Historical Gazetteer of Steuben County, 1891, pages 5-17.)\n\nCHENEY, the post office at Eden railway station, in Wasioja, was named in honor of B. P. Cheney, a farmer there.\n\nCLAREMONT township, first settled in September, 1854, organized May 11, 1858, was named for the town of Claremont, N. H., whence several of its settlers came, including George Hichcock, its first postmaster, Claremont village was incorporated in 1878.\n\nCONCORD township, settled in April, 1854, organized May 11, 1858, was named in like manner for the city of Concord N. H., the capital of that state. The village plat was recorded June 7, 1856.\n\nDODGE CENTER, the railway village in the south edge of Wasioja, founded in 1866, was platted in July 1869, and was incorporated February 29, 1872. This name was proposed by D. C. Fairbank, on account of the location at the center of the county. The first passenger train arrived here, on the Winona and St. Peter railroad, July 13, 1866.\n\nEDEN, the railway station and village having Cheney post office, was named by officers of the Chicago Great Western Railway Company.\n\nELLINGTON township, settled in July, 1855, organized May 11, 1858, had been at first named Pleasant Grove, but was renamed for the town of Ellington in Connecticut. Mrs. John Van Buren, who proposed this change of name, \"wrote the votes by which the matter was decided.\"\n\nHAYFIELD township was organized March 30, 1872, having previously been a part Vernon. Its name was adopted from a township of Crawford county in northwestern Pennsylvania. The railway village of Hayfield was incorporated January 7, 1896.\n\nKASSON, a railway village in the south edge of Mantoville, was named in honor of Jabez Hyde Kasson, owner of the original town site. He was born in Springville, Pa., January 17, 1820, and came to Minnesota in 1856, settling on a farm in this township. When the Winona and St. Peter railroad reached this place, in the fall of 1865, this village was laid out by Mr. Kasson and others, the plat being recorded October 13, 1865, and in November for the first passenger train came.\n\nMANTORVILLE township was first settled in April, 1854; was incorporated under legislative acts of 1854 and 1857; and was organized under the state government, May 11, 1858. The village was platted March 26, 1856, by Peter Mantor, H. A. Pratt, and others, and in 1857 it was designated by a vote of the county to be the county seat. This name was adopted in honor of three brothers, Peter, Riley, and Frank Mantor, who came here in 1853 and 1854 from Linesville, Crawford county, Pa. Peter Mantor, the oldest of these brothers and the leader in founding this town, was born in Albany county, N. Y., December 15, 1815; settled on the site of the village of Mantorville, April 19, 1854, and built a sawmill and gristmill there; was a representative in the legislature, 1859-60; was captain of Company C, Second Minnesota Regiment, 1861; removed to Bismarck, Dakota, in 1874, where he was a register of the U. S. land office until 1880; died in Mantorville, September 23, 1888.\n\nMILTON township, settled in May, 1854, organized May 20, 1858, had been successively called Watkins, Buchanan, and Berne, Georgia has a Milton county, and thirty other states have townships, villages, and cities of this name, honoring the grand poet and patriot of England (b. 1608, d. 1674).\n\nOSLO, a hamlet at the center of Vernon township, was made a post office in 1879, lately discontinued. This name is now borne by a village of the Soo railway in the southwest corner of Marshall county. It was the name of the original city founded in 1048 by Harold Sigurdsson near the site of Christiania, the capital of Norway. Oslo (or Opslo) became the chief city of Norway, but it was built mainly of wood, and after a great conflagration the city was refounded on the present site by the king, Christian IV, who gave his name to it in 1624.\n\nRICE LAKE, a village in the northwest corner of Claremont, received its name from the neighboring lake, crossed by the west line of this county. It refers to the growth of wild rice in this shallow lake, which was used as an important food supply by the Indians.\n\nRIPLEY township, first settled in September, 1854, organized May 14, organized May 14, 1858, may probably have been named for some eastern township or village, as in Maine, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, or West Virginia, in each of which states this name is found.\n\nSACRAMENTO was a village platted in the fall of 1855, on the Zumbro river in the west edge of Mantorville, against which it was a rival for election as the county seat, but it was defeated by the popular vote in 1857. Within the next decade its buildings were removed, and its site reverted to farm use. The name, from California, had reference to scanty occurrence of placer gold in the drift of some localities on branches of the Zumbro and Root rivers, as noted in reports of the Minnesota Geological Survey. One of the places of ill repaid washing by the early settlers was near the site occupied a few years by this \"deserted village.\"\n\nVERNON township, settled in October, 1855, organized March 4, 1858, was named from Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of Washington, for Admiral Edward Vernon (b. 1684, d. 1757), of the British navy.\n\nVLASATY, a railway station in Ashland, was named by officers of the Chicago Great Western railway.\n\nWASIOJA township, settled in October, 1854, organized in 1838, bears the Sioux name of the Zumbro river, spelled Wazi Oju on Nicollet's map in 1843. It is translated as \"Piney river\" by Nicollet, and is defined as meaning \"pine clad.\" Large white pines, far west of their general geographic range, grow on the Zumbro bluffs in the east part of this township, as also in Mantorville, and at Pine Island in Goodhue county. The village of Wasioja was platted May 24, 1856.\n\nWEST CONCORD, a village of the Chicago Great Western railway, was platted June 1, 1885.\n\nWESTFIELD township, settled in 1855, organized March 22, 1866, probably commemorates and eastern village or township whence some of its settlers had come. The name is so used in a dozen eastern states, and it is also borne by a river in Massachusetts.\n\nLAKES AND STREAMS. The North Middle branch of Zumbro river, its South Middle branch, and its South branch, gather their head streams in this county; and from Hayfield and Westfield the Cedar river, a long and large stream of Iowa, receives its highest sources, its East, Middle, and West forks.\n\nMilliken and Harkcom creeks, in Concord and Milton, flowing into the North Middle Zumbro, were named for pioneer settlers, as also Maston's branch, flowing northeastward past Kasson to the South Middle fork.\n\nLa Due's bluff, the site of the quarries in Mantorville, was named for Hon. A. D. La Due, a prominent early citizen, who died at Mantorville on January 12, 1899.\n\nOn the South branch of the Zumbro, in the southwest quarter of section 12, Vernon, was the Indian Grove, named for a large number of Sioux who had their camp there in the winter of 1856-7.\n\nHammond or Manchester lake and Prince lake, in Ripley, were named for adjoining farmers."
