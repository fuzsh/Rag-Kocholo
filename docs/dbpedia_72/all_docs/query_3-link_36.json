        "text": "Dodge County offers rich agricultural resources, historic sites, and advanced manufacturing technology that contributes to the economic development of the Madison region. Home to a collection of charming communities, Dodge County’s small towns provide a relaxing respite from urban life surrounded by more than 80 lakes, rivers, and streams, including the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the United States. Local career pathways are often driven by the area’s primary industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and retail trade. And, with long-standing and well-known brands such as John Deere Company operating in the area, innovation and talent development are a top priority."
