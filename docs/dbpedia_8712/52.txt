Ghosh, after taking on the role, has been enjoying the experience thoroughly, with Bollywood co-stars Bobby Deol and Sonam Kapoor, with whom she shares screen space in the film.

She’s already in awe of Sonam, who she feels dresses up very elegantly and has a great sense of aesthetics and fashion. Ghosh will soon start shooting for the next schedule of the film.

Ghosh says, “Anees sir looked after me so well during the making of the film. Bobby also is so much fun to work with. I never found him intimidating at all. Sonam is a complete rockstar and a real darling. I’m looking forward to resuming work on the sets very soon, because for me, working on this film was like working and playing together. It’s the best combination of things that an actor can ask for professionally.”
