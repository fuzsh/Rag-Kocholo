        "text": "A solo mixed media exhibition by Pune artist Rashmi Ghosh\n\nPune, 14 June 2024: India’s forgotten marvels, the Stepwells, a symbol of ancient Indian ingenuity and architectural expertise, are set to take centre stage in a unique mixed media exhibition titled “Mapping Stepwells: A Visual Narrative”.\n\nThe exhibition is being presented by artist Rashmi Ghosh, a resident of Pune, curated by Nalini Malaviya and organized by IGA Galleria. This innovative showcase is open to all from 21 to 30 June 2024 from 11 am to 7.30 pm at Monalisa Kalagram Koregaon Park, Pune.\n\nStepwells, known as ‘baori’ ‘bavadi’ ‘bahuli’ or ‘vav’ in India, are ancient water storage structures once vital to the subcontinent’s survival. These architectural marvels, often decorated with intricate carvings and elaborate designs, provided water for drinking and irrigation and served as social and religious hubs or resting places for Caravan Sarais. In Maharashtra itself, there are more than 20,000 Stepwells which were the structures used to preserve water during the dry seasons.\n\nThe exhibition is an effort to offer a fresh perspective on stepwells to encourage people to explore India’s diverse heritage offerings. It is about creating visually stunning pieces along with telling a unique story surrounding each stepwell. It will feature an alluring collection of paintings, drawings and photographs of Stepwells from across Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat and Delhi.\n\nAbout Rashmi Ghosh:\n\nRashmi Ghosh, a Chartered Accountant by profession, transitioned from a successful career in finance to pursue her lifelong passion for visual arts. Having undertaken a Fine Arts course during weekends, she received instruction in watercolours from renowned artist Milind Mullick and other masters of the art. Her artistic endeavours have been showcased in over ten group exhibitions across India, an International Solo Show in Malaga, Spain, an International Virtual Art Exhibition titled “Resilience” in Florida and a display at “The India Art Architecture and Design Biennale 2023” at the Red Fort, Delhi which featured four works from her series “Descent into India’s Incredible Stepwells”. This showcase was inaugurated by the honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 8, 2023."
