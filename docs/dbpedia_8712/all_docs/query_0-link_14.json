        "text": "Reshmi Ghosh entered tellydom with a bang as the adamant and tough Bhoomi in Balaji and Star Plus' longest running show Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. Ever since, she has been loyal to the banner and was present in many of the later Balaji shows. But what is the reason that Reshmi is seen mostly in shows with Balaji banner?\n\nWell, Tellybuzz had a candid chat with this beautiful and fun loving actress where she opened her heart.\n\nExcerpts!!!\n\nHow has the journey been to you after Miss India 2002?\n\nThe journey has been a mixed-bag for me because after I completed the pageant, I had the intention that everything would be easy for me. But all turned out to be an illusion as I literally slogged for work and for living. Even though I was working in movies, I realized I got in through the wrong contacts. But I have never given up in my life even after having facing a difficult phase. There has been a lot of hurdles that I stumbled over, but my family has always been there with me as a great support and I learnt all by myself to be here in the industry. There are actresses who got established in their career after a long time of slog and struggle and I am happy that I am recognized today. After all that I have gone through and saw in my life I have become a strong woman.\n\nYou started off your journey in television with the longest running daily soap in Indian Television, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. How was it being associated with the show?\n\nIt had been great and I had to do a lot of hard work to get myself into the character. Because in the beginning I couldn't understand the character Bhoomi as she was not the typical vampish girl that we normally see on television. There was also a stage when Ekta was thinking of replacing me, but then she had the complete trust in me and explained the character very well which helped me to take off again with more confidence. Getting associated with Balaji is always great and I have that connection even today.\n\nYou have been associated with two reality shows too, do you enjoy doing it?\n\nReality Shows are something where people know what is happening, but simultaneously there is a little bit of acting there too. I like doing reality shows because it gives you recognition nationwide and would love to be associated with shows like Jhalak Dikhhla jaa.\n\nYou are always associated with Balaji shows, any particular reason?\n\nBalaji in itself is a reason and the security and the recognition that one gets in Balaji never makes you feel like switching away from the production house.\n\nHow has this long journey been with Ekta and Balaji?\n\nBalaji gave me the biggest opportunity to enter the television industry and Ekta is a great mentor to me. She is a very good boss and a wonderful person whom I can always approach whenever I have a problem and has always been there to help me out. She always gives an appreciation message whenever the work is done well and that means a lot to me. After two years of break, she is still there for me and believes me as an actor.\n\nHow has your association been with Star Plus?\n\nStar Plus has been there always and it is a great channel to work with.\n\nThere was a rumour about your breakup with your boyfriend Amit Gupta, what would you like to comment on that?\n\nThat is too personal for me to comment at the moment, because I want to keep myself engaged in work.\n\nYou were mostly seen in vampish roles, do you enjoy it?\n\nOf course, because being a vamp charges you up and I think that doing the typical good roles with rona-dhona, is easy when compared to negative roles. And when you are doing such roles you get the chance to try yourself with voice modulations and character change and et al. But I always wanted to try doing comic roles also so that I get a chance to experiment myself in that genre too.\n\nHow is Reshmi Gosh in person?\n\nReshmi in real is an open book and there is nothing fake about her. She is really simple and opens her heart.\n\nYou replaced Neha Janpandit in Tere Liye, where you apprehensive about it?\n\nI was not apprehensive at all because I know my fans were waiting for me to be back on screen and I was sure that they would love me as Nupur also. I love the character so much that I felt why Ekta didn't offer me the role in the beginning, but then finally I got to do this role for which I am extremely happy. It's actually a good role that Neha did not follow.\n\nYou have been in the industry for long; what were the changes you found in these years?\n\nIn my opinion there have not been much of a change apart from the fact that people are more advanced and they are working hard to earn more and become more glamorous.\n\nWhen you look back, did you feel that you are repeating yourself?\n\nAt times I did feel that I am repeating the same roles. If you take the role in Kayamat and Tere Liye, the roles are similar but the only difference is the age of both the characters, which again brings the difference in the body language and the other aspects. But then negativity in the character gives you a chance to be more versatile in acting.\n\nHow is your rapport with Harshad Chopra and Anupriya Kapoor?\n\nAnupriya is a very sweet and a hardworking girl .I am really pleased with the way she takes the call of the family and also works at the same time and manages it beautifully. And Harshad is a good friend and taunts me by calling me 'maam' on the sets making me feel like an elderly person.\n\nThe fans of the lead pair in Tere Liye are upset about your come back that too when Anurag had declared love for Taani.\n\nI know they are really very angry with me but I am happy to know that they hate me because that's what the character deserves. I would feel bad if people liked me (laughs).\n\nWhat was the reason that you took Tere Liye?\n\nThe main reason I took up the show was the banner Balaji and secondly I love the character Nupur and I know the character very well because I used to follow the show."
