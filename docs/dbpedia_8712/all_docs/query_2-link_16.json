Her research focuses on applications of applied analytics and data science at the intersection of societal issues such as immigration, anti-human trafficking, and homelessness.\n\nDr. Jean King\n\nPeterson Family Dean of Arts & Sciences, WPI\n\nA widely respected neuroscientist, Jean King joined the WPI community as the Peterson Family Dean of Arts and Sciences in 2017. In addition to her duties as dean, she is a professor in the Department of Biology and Biotechnology. Dr. King’s research uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify and monitor neuronal plasticity associated with addiction, ADHD, depression, fearfulness, anxiety, autism and neurological disorders (PD and TBI) in animal models with the hope of finding clues to help us understand these conditions in humans. Dr. King has published over 60 original scientific papers in highly respected international scientific journals, over 10 chapters in books and review articles in major neurophysiology journals, and is an editor of New York Academy of Sciences Publication – Roots of Mental Illness in Children. Prior to joining WPI, she was vice provost for biomedical research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School; a tenured professor of psychiatry, radiology, and neurology; and director of the university’s Center for Comparative Neuroimaging.\n\nKeynote Speaker\n\nDr. Tasha Snow\n\nMines Glaciology Laboratory, Colorado School of Mines\n\nTasha is a Research Associate at the Colorado School of Mines working to better understand high latitude ocean and glacier change and how it will impact the planet. She received her PhD in Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder studying glaciology, but also has an interdisciplinary research background in paleoceanography and marine ecology. Her current work focuses on how oceans interact with glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, and she is developing new ways to apply satellite thermal infrared imagery to study these systems. She specializes in remote sensing, machine learning, and open science. One of her most exciting projects at the moment is leading the CryoCloud cloud-computing project (cryointhecloud.com) to help usher NASA Cryosphere communities into the cloud and build open-source science infrastructure and community best practices. Aside from her research interests, she is a veteran of the US Navy and is passionate about helping others to develop more inclusive leadership skills in academia.\n\nTitle: Accelerating discovery for NASA Cryosphere communities with open-source data science and cloud-infrastructure\n\nAbstract: Emerging social and technological community innovations have made it possible to start asking questions in Antarctic research that were previously not possible. A firehose of new data, disparate data standards, and research methods has historically plagued the cryosphere community, much like many other climate fields. Simultaneously, the need to create timely and readily accessible research solutions that effectively transmit knowledge for decision-making has grown more immediate. To address these needs across the scientific spectrum, NASA, the U.S. federal government, and a host of government and academic institutions have turned to open-source science and declared 2023 the “Year of Open Science”. Through this event within a decade-long Open-Source Science Initiative, NASA, along with their federal partners, aims to rapidly build a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data and knowledge in order to accelerate scientific discovery. The NASA cryospheric research community has begun to harness the power of these open systems to make multi-decadal fine- (sub-kilometer) or Antarctic continent-scale investigations using disparate and often sparse datasets tractable. Here, we showcase the open science principles, cloud-computing infrastructure, and new collaborative research standards we have started to build for conducting research in complex, often unobservable Antarctic systems. We show specific applications in Antarctic glacier research where cloud infrastructure enables novel machine learning analysis, visualization, and intra- and inter-team collaboration. The specialized social and technological innovations that we have developed for Cryosphere communities are portable and generalizable to other scientific communities to help democratize science and accelerate discovery for the broader research community and public.\n\nPanel: Data Science and Environmental Justice\n\nModerator\n\nDr. Laureen Elgert\n\nAssoc Professor of International Development & Environmental Policy Dept Head, Integrative and Global Studies Co-Director, Ecuador Project Center Worcester Polytechnic Institute\n\nLaureen Elgert is an Associate Professor of International Development and Environmental Policy, currently serving as Head of the Department of Integrative and Global Studies (DIGS) at WPI. Laureen’s research and teaching interests focus on the environment-development nexus, where tensions between sustainability and livelihoods often lead to contentious policy debates. My work on soy production and land inequality, expert roundtables and certification, and sustainability rating systems for cities, advanced ideas around how expert, global discourses about sustainable agriculture and sustainability indicators take shape, are mobilized, and have influence at the local level, impacting social, political, and environmental systems. Laureen is co-editor of “Social Movements and the Struggles for Rights, Justice, and Democracy in Paraguay” (Springer, 2022).\n\nPanelists\n\nBrooke Williams\n\nAssociate Professor of the Practice of Computational Journalism, College of Communication Civic Tech Fellow, Faculty of Data and Computing Science, Boston University\n\nBrooke Williams is an investigative reporter, professor of the practice of computational journalism and civic tech fellow at Boston University.

She is also a guest researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Her work is in the area of simulation, simulation-based optimization, reinforcement learning and machine learning, and stochastic processes. Her lab focusses on developing mathematical and computational models to inform public health policies. Recent work includes use of machine learning methods to capture the interactions between interrelated sexually transmitted diseases and social determinants of health, to subsequently quantify disease risk attributed to social and economic conditions, understand social needs of persons at risk of disease, and inform structural interventions. Her lab is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization.\n\nDynamic simulation models are a critical tool to evaluate the impact of alternative disease intervention combinations to identify the strategy that is most optimal at controlling an outbreak. The fundamental building blocks of most infectious disease models are to simulate human behaviors such as contact networks, and testing and treatment behaviors. However, data show that disease cases are concentrated among populations in low socio economic conditions and further that social and economic factors are drivers of behaviors that increase risk of diseases. While behaviors are fundamental mathematical mechanisms for predicting the spread of diseases, modeling behaviors alone without the factors that drive them can enormously misrepresent intervention needs. These data also suggest that social factors are common risk factors of multiple diseases, and as such, the need for a method to jointly modeling related diseases to inform optimal allocation of resources through a unified approach to disease prevention. I will discuss some of our work in use of machine learning methods to address the challenges associated with building such a multi-disease model and simulating behaviors as functions of social determinants, related to sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nLab website: https://diseasemodeling.github.io/\n\nTalk Title: Follow the data: social factors are among key drivers of disease risk.
