        "text": "Personal Life:\n\nDebina Bonnerjee-Choudhary, from Kolkata, had no dreams of becoming an actress or model or doctor or engineer. In 1994, Debina got inspiration for modeling from Sushmita Sen, who had won Miss Universe. Debina carefully groomed herself as she grew up by looking after her skin and fitness, keeping up with the latest fashion trends, etc. Debina also worked at her studies simultaneously. Her parents told her that if she was passionate about something, they wouldn’t ever turn her down from whatever she wanted to do. So to get their approval for modeling, Debina pushed herself from a below-average student to a rank holder! One day Debina casually told her parents while reading an advertisement from the newspaper about the Ms. Calcutta contest. Debina’s mom was against it but her dad agreed, so she eventually relented and Debina was allowed to take part.\n\nDebina met her life partner, Gurmeet Choudhary, during her first stay in Mumbai when she began her career as an actress. They were in a solid relationship for a few years before Gurmeet proposed to her in NDTV Imagine’s Pati Patni aur Woh. On February 15, 2011, the couple finally tied the knot in a private home ceremony attended by only close family and friends.\n\nEarly Career:\n\nDebina participated in Ms. Calcutta and reached the final 20, but then she was out in the first round. Instead of returning home, Debina sat through it till the end just to see what the winner had in her that she lacked. Afterwards Debina took part in other contests like Lakme which she and Reshmi Ghosh won. The next year, Debina took part in the Ms. Calcutta contest again and this time won!\n\nFrom there Debina went to Mumbai to participate in the Ms. Bollywood contest organized by Sahara. One early morning she was walking through Juhu and a director from the South approached her and asked her about the auditions she had gone to four days ago for Anandiyadi productions, the house that boasts of Gemini and Sun TV in the South. The director had really liked her audition and ended up giving her the first lead though she had auditioned for the second.\n\nDebina immediately signed her next film with Shivraj Kumar in Kannada and another in Tamil with Captian Vijaykanth. Television shows weren’t really on her mind as of then. However, Debina got a 3D serial offer called Mayavi, which she considered rejecting when Gurmeet Choudhary convinced her to give it a try. She auditioned for it and got the female lead, whereas Gurmeet bagged the role of the main antagonist. This project was met with much success in the South and even went for the Seon Film Festival, winning first prize in the foreign film category.\n\nTelevision:\n\nAfter Mayavi, Debina was next seen on television screen as Goddess Sita of Sagar Arts’ Ramayan on NDTV Imagine, opposite Gurmeet who played Lord Ram. She never thought she would do a mythological role in her career, but the character of Sita turned out to be a refreshing change from the typical Indian bahu of television, and she found that she really enjoyed the experience.\n\nFollowing Ramayan, NDTV Imagine’s Pati Patni aur Woh came by which Gurmeet and Debina both thought was perfect for them to get out of their mythological character mould, set free, and be identified by their real names. Pati Patni aur Woh was the last show which Debina and Gurmeet did together, for after that Debina was seen in reality shows such as Zor Ka Jhatka and Star Ya Rockstar before settling down with Garima Productions’ Chidiya Ghar on Sab Tv. Now, Debina is a household name not just as Devi Sita of Ramayan, but also Mayuri Narayan of Chidiyaghar.\n\nBirthday\n\n18th April 1983\n\nMarriage:\n\n11th February 2011\n\nSun-Sign:\n\nAries\n\nTelevision\n\nShow Character Mayavi Ramayan Sita Pati Patni Aur Woh Herself Aahat Kajal Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout Contestant Chidiya Ghar Mayuri Gomukh Narayanan Star Ya Rockstar Contestant Pati Patni Aur Woh Contestant Welcome – Baazi Mehmaan-Nawaazi ki Herself Nach Baliye Shriman v/s Shrimati Herself\n\nFilm\n\nFilm Language Character\n\nIndian Babu Hindi Step-sister of the main character\n\nAmmayilu Abbayilu Telugu as Manju\n\nPerarasu Tamil Lead Female with Vijayakanth\n\nDebina Twitter ID – https://twitter.com/imdebina\n\nDebina BLOG- http://gurmeetdebina.india-forums.com/"
