        "text": "Hi I am Rashmi Ghosh,an ordinary girl,wife and mother with extraordinary dreams.Being a mother its really difficult to think about career startup.Being a mother of a two year old child its really hard to find a me time for myself.On social media, I became familiar with the idea of writing blogs which can easily managed by mums at home so started one with creating an account on a blogging site.The daily increase in graph of page views from United states, Germany, Ukraine,India, Pakistan, Switzerland, Peru, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia really encouraged me a lot in writing more about new subjects.But due to less flexibility provided to the writers and long time consumption to qualify in it disheartened me.Once I thought of dropping my idea of writing stories and articles.Googled various sites for a best platform which could provide cost free publishing of my Mumsjourney books collection.Then one of my friend recommended me of Amazon Kindle.And Now I am here with my collections of Mumsjourney books.In my Mumsjourney books collection I have tried to keep the language easy and simple so that anyone can have clear concept of my written stories.This is just the beginning,I hope to fulfill my dreams by providing excellent stories and articles for all my readers.Readers of my Mumsjourney books collection can relate themselves on some point or other with my books."
