        "text": "Hi! This is Rachit (no not 'Rasheet' or even 'Ratchet') but don’t worry - I got bullied all through my high school so I’ve accepted it by now. Okay not really, just call me Rich! if it's too complicated. (Call me I’ll explain, it’s really NOT :)\n\n(SMASH CUT)\n\nSo I was born in New Delhi, India and was brought up in Chicago (my hometown) since my early teens, and now based in New York, bringing you the perfect slice of Bollywood & Hollywood. (this rhymed well so I retained it from the first draft)\n\n(SMASH CUT)\n\nI pursued performing arts as I couldn’t connect with the corporate world (sounds more like underworld). Learned the art of expressing and pretending to be someone else, mostly through life experiences and my tendency to connect and pick something from it organically but I believe any craft requires honing and formal guidance. So, to polish my skills and go deep in the craft, I'm currently training at 'T. SCHREIBER STUDIO' in New York.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nIn ‘Bollywood’ (the name is quite regressive though), after taking a sabbatical from odd jobs, I proudly earned a few mainstream Bollywood films, including the mega hit 'SANJU', directed by one of our most celebrated directors ‘RAJKUMAR HIRANI’. (what a humble man!) followed by guest starring multiple times in various T.V. shows like ‘C.I.D’., ‘Ladies Special’ (both for SONY), to name a few.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nBack to the United States. Long story short, in a span of 18 years, I have acted in close to 20 films (shorts, features), web series, industrials, commercials like ‘WESTERN UNION’ etc., and a hand full of plays as well. (theatre being the most draining..where's my 'choking' emoji?) When I’m not acting, I’m singing and/or editing videos in which I’m acting/singing, if that makes sense. (scratching head) Fresh new ideas excite me and hence when in mood, I make my own movies and edit the heck out of them. (I do a decent job with the edits so I keep rehiring myself)\n\n(SMASH CUT)\n\nI love entertaining people, cracking lame jokes, and making fun of people but dear mother says I always have a serious face. (okay well I have my moments, everyone does) and I say mom, today I’m playing ‘Tommy Lee Jones’, and other times ‘Irrfan Khan’. Anyway, thanks for stopping by and don’t forget to call me!\n\n(Man…Resume page was much easier, sigh!)"
