        "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. has a deep history in Boston. King earned his doctorate in theology at Boston University. He met his future wife, Coretta Scott, here. He was a youth minister at the Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. He lead the first civil rights march in the Northeast from Roxbury to Boston Common in 1965 and addressed the Massachusetts Legislature.\n\nThere are many opportunities to honor him on Jan. 15, Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the Boston area. (Check out some suggestions here.)\n\nOne small way to honor the civil rights giant is to begin your day, as my elementary school did each year, by listening to his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. A recording of the address, delivered on the steps the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., along with the full text is available here.\n\nWhile you reflect on the lasting impact of King as you go about your Monday, there are some key closures to note.\n\nFederal offices: Closed.\n\nState offices: Closed.\n\nMunicipal offices: Closed.\n\nLibraries: Closed.\n\nBanks: Closed.\n\nRMV: Closed.\n\nSupermarkets: Open.\n\nLiquor stores: Open.\n\nRetail stores: Open, but hours may differ. Check with the store before you head out.\n\nMBTA: Subways, buses and the RIDE will operate on a holiday schedule. The Commuter Rail is operating on a weekday schedule, except for the Providence Line, which is running on a slightly adjusted weekday schedule. (There are $10 Commuter Rail passes available on the holiday.) The Hingham and Charlestown ferries are running a weekday schedule."
