        "text": "Back in the summer of 1981, I took a Sunday drive with my family. Route 32 bisects Monson, Massachusetts, having come north from New London, Connecticut. On this day, we decided to follow this road north as far as it goes, which brought us to Keene, New Hampshire.\n\nOn the way we stopped in Ware and a few other towns.\n\nAt Keene, I was fascinated by the Boston & Maine SW1 laying idle in the old yard. At one time, decades earlier, Keene had been a been a B&M hub.\n\nBy the time I made these photos, Keene was effectively the end of branch served from the Connecticut River Line at Brattleboro, Vermont via Dole Junction.\n\nNot long after this visit, B&M conveyed operations to the Green Mountain Railroad. Business was sparse and by the mid-1980s operations were discontinued altogether.\n\nI wonder what this scene looks like today?\n\nFor years I also wondered what happened to these photographs. I recalled making them, but searches through my negatives failed to locate them. Admittedly my early photographs lacked logical organization.\n\nFinally I found them in the ‘BIG BOX’ of missing negatives located last week.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOne hundred and thirty five years ago, the railway station was key to many communities commerce and communications. It offered the connection to the world.\n\nMy 1880 Official Guide is a window on the past. The Boston, Barre & Gardner Railroad (among the companies later melded into the Boston & Maine network) schedule lists three trains a day in each direction stopping at Holden, Massachusetts.\n\nTrains ran from Worcester to Winchendon stopping at Holden at 8:28 am, 4:15 pm, and 7 pm, and Winchendon to Worcester at 9:06 am, 1:22 pm, and 7 pm.\n\nObviously based on this schedule, there was a planned meet between northward and southward trains at the station.\n\nIn its heyday, back in 1880 Holden was an important station. It served as a telegraph office and as a transfer point for stagecoaches to Rutland (Massachusetts).\n\nToday the old station is but a relic, the vestige of another time. Its train order signal is no longer part of the rules of operation; and the last passenger train passed in 1953. Yet the railroad remains active.\n\nProvidence & Worcester’s freights connect with Pan Am Railways/Pan Am Southern at Gardner and this has developed as a route for the movement of new automobiles and ethanol moving via the port of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nMy book, Railway Depots, Stations & Terminals features a variety of railway stations in New England, across America and around the world. It was published by Voyageur Press this year and is available from Amazon and other outlets.\n\nTracking the Light posts Original Content!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBoston & Maine GP9 on the Connecticut River Line, December 1985.\n\nDigging through my older photographs, occasionally I come across something really interesting.\n\nI’d exposed this black & white photograph using my father’s Rollei Model T at Bernardston, Massachusetts, where the railroad crossed an old mill dam on a classic stone arch bridge.\n\nBrandon Delaney and I had gone up to Brattleboro, Vermont, where we found a pair of Boston & Maine GP9s working local freight ED-4. I made a number of images of engine 1736 working in the snow. Then we followed the train south into Massachusetts.\n\nBrandon had previously explored this location at Bernardston and so we set up and waited.\n\nFor me this is a lesson in balance and composition: By placing the locomotive over the first pier of the bridge rather than allowing it to move further onto the bridge, I’ve created both visual tension and compositional balance.\n\nThe GP9 plays off the old mill at the bottom of the bridge to the left, while de-emphasizing the locomotive allows the eye to focus more on the bridge but never so long as to ignore the engine altogether. The bridge, after all, is the main subject, while the locomotive and mill are secondary to the scene.\n\nI’ve been back here several times over the years and the scene has changed. The old mill and mill dam are history. I don’t know if they were washed away in a flood or were deliberately demolished. At the time they offered links to New England’s faded small-scale industrial past.\n\nToday, because the dam is gone the bridge appears taller since the full length of the piers can be followed right in to the river-bed. Trees have encroached on both sides of the bridge, and even in winter, it can be difficult to get more than one locomotive on the structure. Yet, it can still be a great place to pose a train.\n\nSee: Daily Post: Boston & Maine Revisited, PART 2\n\nTracking the Light posts new material every morning.\n\nPlease spread the word and share Tracking the Light with anyone who may enjoy seeing it!\n\nhttp://briansolomon.com/trackingthelight/\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA Kodachrome View of Boston & Maine’s West End\n\nYesterday, April 13, 2013, Pan Am Railways hosted a passenger excursion over the historic Boston & Maine route from Boston to Mechanicville. My father, Richard Jay Solomon, was among the passengers, and he sent me regular updates on his progress. This inspired me to revisit images such as this one.\n\nScouring the archives, I found this Kodachrome slide from the 1980s. It shows Guilford’s Boston & Maine mainline at Rices, near Charlemont, Massachusetts at 11:05 am on June 26, 1986. A westward freight led by B&M’s lone GP40-2 slug set (on left) is holding at the signals for an eastward train coming from Mechanicville, New York.\n\nThis image was never among my best photographs. At the time, I was using my old Leica 3A fitted with a 65mm Elmar using a Visoflex reflex arrangement. To gauge exposure, I used an antique hand-held General Electric photo cell. The camera arrangement allowed for a sharp image but was awkward to use. More to the point, the meter wasn’t very accurate and my sense for exposure wasn’t highly tuned. As a result, this slide was overexposed, as were most of my efforts from the day.\n\nThankfully, my choice of film at the time was Kodachrome 64, which was relatively tolerant of inaccurate exposure. So while, this slide appears too bright when projected on screen, the emulsion retained sufficient detail to be recovered digitally. I scanned the slide using my Epson V600 scanner, then corrected for my flawed exposure with Adobe Photoshop by manipulating the ‘Curves’ function. The end result isn’t objectionable.\n\nExposed on Kodachrome using a Leica 3A fitted with a 65mm Elmar via a Visoflex.\n\nRelated articles\n\nRidership up on Boston-to-Maine Amtrak route\n\nAmtrak Downeaster Provides Opportunity to Win Prizes for Documenting Travel Between Boston and Maine\n\nSomething Old, Something New; Dwarf Signal, Palmer, Massachusetts, October 1984\n\nCalifornia Northern, Petaluma, California April 9, 1994.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
