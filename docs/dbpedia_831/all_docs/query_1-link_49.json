The Museum will open at 3pm and the meeting will be called to order at 3:30pm.\n\nThe subject of meeting: What is the Future of the Talbot Mills Dam, the Summit Pond and the Middlesex Canal Heritage Park?\n\nNOAA's public meeting on removal of the Talbot/Billerica Falls Dam, draining the summit pond, is a week after the MCC special meeting.\n\nThe Middlesex Canal Association Presents:\n\nSpring Bicycle Tour of Historic Middlesex Canal\n\nOn Sunday, April 24, 2022, the Middlesex Canal Association will present its spring bicycle tour of the Middlesex Canal. The Canal was the âBig Digâ of the end of the 18th century. Completed in 1803 after 10 years of construction, the Canal connected the Merrimac River in what is now Lowell with the Charles River at Sullivan Square in Charlestown. In many ways it served as a model for later canals including the Erie Canal. The Canal remained in operation for 50 years, providing both passenger and freight service, but could not compete successfully with the Boston and Lowell Railroad which began operation in the 1830âs.\n\nThe ride will depart from the Lowell Train Station at 11:15am. You can take your bicycle on the 10:51am train from Anderson Station (Woburn) which arrives in Lowell at 11:15am. There is no train service from Boston. Riders can also just meet at Lowell Station. Route visits the Pawtucket and other Lowell canals, river walk, Francis Gate, and then Middlesex Canal remnants in Chelmsford. Quick visit to Canal Museum, then on to Boston.\n\nWe will stop along the way for a picnic lunch, so bring something to eat. Long day, but sunset is late. For riders who need to get back to Anderson instead of going all the way to Boston, a group will split off and return to Anderson.\n\nThe route is pretty flat and level, so the ride will be easy to moderate for most cyclists. Along the way we will stop at a number of remnants and restored sections of the Canal, as well as the Mansion of Loammi Baldwin, the chief engineer of the Canal (who discovered the Baldwin apple while building the Canal), the two remaining aqueducts (which carried the Canal over rivers and brooks), and the northern end of the floating towpath that carried horses over the Millpond.\n\nThe ride will be led by Bill Kuttner (617-241-9383, bkuttner@alum.mit.edu) and Dick Bauer (857-540-6293, dick.bauer@alum.mit.edu) of the Middlesex Canal Commission. Helmets required. Steady rain cancels.\n\nFor more information about the Middlesex Canal go to: http://www.middlesexcanal.org\n\nWARNING: The MBTA is NOT running trains all the way from Boston to Lowell. Trains will only be running between Anderson Station (Woburn) and Lowell. The MBTA will be running buses between North Station and Anderson, but will NOT be permitting bikes on the buses. There will be no way to get bikes from North Station to Anderson on the MBTA. Therefore, you should start the trip at Anderson. There is a very large parking lot at Anderson. The trains to Lowell are scheduled to leave Anderson at 10:51am, and arrive in Lowell at 11:15am. See the MBTA train schedules and service alerts here.\n\nSat, Mar 12, 2022 â Hike Beautiful Billerica\n\n9:45am. Marlies Henderson, two hour walk south to smallpox cemetery.
