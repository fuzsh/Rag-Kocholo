        "text": "Positive Train Control (PTC) Automatic Train Control (ATC)\n\nThe Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 requires every railroad across the country to have Positive Train Control (PTC).\n\nAs of August 2020, we completed Phase I of the Commuter Rail Safety and Resiliency Program. The MBTA PTC safety system is now active on all MBTA Commuter Rail lines. Phase II, which includes implementing Automatic Train Control (ATC), and Phase III are now underway.\n\nBuilding a Better T\n\nAs part of our $9.6 billion, 5-year capital investment plan, we're renovating stations, modernizing fare collection systems, upgrading services for our buses, subways, and ferries, and improving the accessibility of the entire system.\n\nLearn more\n\nIn Progress\n\nPhase II: Automatic Train Control (ATC) (2020 – 2024)\n\nPhase II includes implementation of Commuter Rail Automatic Train Control (ATC) as part of the MBTA PTC System.\n\nPhase II for Commuter Rail Lines out of South Station: Successfully completed on time in 2020\n\nPhase II for Commuter Rail Lines out of North Station: Currently underway\n\nAutomatic Train Control (ATC) sends signal indications to the train cab in addition to using physical signal lights alongside the tracks. These signals are part of the MBTA Positive Train Control (PTC) System that alert the engineer of potentially unsafe conditions.\n\nIf the crew does not respond to an alert, the system will automatically slow or stop the train.\n\nATC is an upgrade to the existing signal system and is required by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) as part of the PTC System implementation.\n\nThe MBTA Positive Train Control (PTC) System requires Automatic Train Control (ATC) to achieve the greatest level of safety and is required by federal regulation.\n\nATC is in operation as part of the signal system on all south side lines and the Lowell and Fitchburg lines on the north side.\n\nInstallation and testing are underway on the Newburyport/Rockport and Haverhill lines, scheduled for completion by 2024.\n\nAutomatic Train Control Implementation Progress\n\nATC is complete and active on the Lowell Line.\n\nATC is complete and active on the line between Boston and Fitchburg.\n\nWork between Fitchburg and Wachusett will be completed at a later date.\n\nATC is active on the Chelsea to Newburyport/Rockport section of the Newburyport/Rockport Line.\n\nATC implementation on the Haverhill Line is underway.\n\nATC is complete and active on all Commuter Rail Lines out of South Station.\n\nPhase II Photo Gallery\n\nRecorded Project Update\n\nCommuter Rail Safety and Resiliency Program Update (Summer 2022)\n\nPhase III: Fiber Optic Resiliency (FOR) (2022 – 2025)\n\nThis project will create a buried, fiber optic cable network for signals, communications, and PTC systems between or alongside Commuter Rail tracks where aerial systems exist today.\n\nThe FOR project is responsible for planning, designing, installing, and testing a buried fiber optic cable network that will provide resilient infrastructure to support MBTA PTC vital systems operating on weather-exposed aerial infrastructure.\n\nThe current scope includes the design and installation of a buried fiber optic cable network between or alongside Commuter Rail tracks along the Fitchburg and Lowell lines.\n\nFiber Optic Resiliency Project Progress\n\nFOR Construction began in August 2023.\n\nOvernight work on the Fitchburg line will begin on Sunday, May 19, 2024, through Saturday, June 22, 2024.\n\nCrews will be working from 9 PM - 5 AM, Sunday - Thursday.\n\nCrews will mobilize at Brandeis Station in Waltham and move along the railroad Right-of-Way between Concord Avenue in Belmont and Route 28/McGrath Highway in Somerville.\n\nResidents can expect lights and moderate noise levels from the construction equipment.\n\nFOR construction began in March 2024. Residents can expect lights and moderate noise levels from the construction equipment.\n\nPhase III Photo Gallery\n\nComplete\n\nPhase I: Positive Train Control (PTC) (2017 – 2020)\n\nThe MBTA PTC system implements the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES), a proven system used by all systems on the Amtrak Northeast Corridor which runs through eight states from Washington DC up to Boston.\n\nPositive Train Control (PTC) is a train monitoring system that alerts the engineer when it detects the possibility of either a train-to-train collision or a train that's moving too fast along the line or through a work zone.\n\nThe MBTA's PTC system is also designed to prevent unexpected movement of trains through \"open switches.\" The safety technology monitors a train’s location, direction, and speed in real time.\n\nIf the crew does not respond to an alert, PTC will take over and automatically stop the train.\n\nThe PTC safety system works through:\n\nSignals and transponders along the rail corridor that transmit data to the train\n\nOnboard controls that can regulate a train’s speed\n\nCommunications throughout the Commuter Rail network\n\nPTC on the MBTA Commuter Rail System\n\nThe MBTA is in full compliance FRA PTC regulations, completing the PTC System prior to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) deadline of December 31, 2020.\n\nPTC is in operation on all of the MBTA’s Commuter Rail lines (394 of 394 route miles)—we placed the last segment in service on August 15, 2020.\n\nPTC equipment is installed and fully operational on all MBTA Commuter Rail revenue vehicles.\n\nWe completed interoperability testing with tenant railroads (Amtrak, CSX, and Pan Am).\n\nPhase I Timeline\n\nPTC hardware and software components were installed around the commuter rail system and on each locomotive and control car. (A control car is a non-powered train coach that can control operation from the end of the train opposite the locomotive.)\n\nAfter key milestones in the installation process were met in 2018, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) granted the MBTA an extension until December 2020 for full deployment. To get an extension from the FRA, major work was required to be completed. It included:\n\nThe installation of wayside equipment across the entire network\n\nInstallation of computer equipment on board all locomotives and control cars\n\nField qualification testing on the Stoughton Pilot Line\n\nPTC training of railroad personnel\n\nCommuter Rail trains operate with PTC technology. PTC performance was monitored and adjusted accordingly, and quality testing ensured reliable safety monitoring will be delivered across the Commuter Rail system over long stretches of time and in all types of weather.\n\nIn addition, older signaling systems were upgraded to make them compatible with PTC. The upgrade has an added benefit: it makes them more reliable and much less likely to cause service delays.\n\nAs of December 2020, the MBTA Commuter Rail system, Amtrak, and freight railroads across the state are protected by PTC.\n\nLearn about the national PTC effort\n\nPhase I Photo Gallery\n\nPast Events\n\nPublic Meeting: Positive Train Control and the Haverhill Line\n\nPublic Meeting: Positive Train Control and the Haverhill Line\n\nLawrence Public Library, Sargent’s Auditorium, Lawrence, MA\n\nPublic Meeting: Positive Train Control and the Haverhill Line\n\nPublic Meeting: Positive Train Control and the Haverhill Line\n\nReading Public Library, Community Room A, Reading, MA\n\nPublic Meeting for Weekend PTC Work on Needham Line\n\nPublic Meeting for Weekend PTC Work on Needham Line\n\nNeedham Town Hall, James Hugh Powers Hall, Needham, MA\n\nView all events\n\nContact Information\n\nFor all queries and comments related to Commuter Rail Positive Train Control, please contact the PTC Hotline at PTCProgram@mbta.com or 617-721-7506."
