The Eastern Railroad gained control of Maine Central in 1871. B&M leased ERR in 1884 and thereby controlled MEC. When, in 1907, New Haven gained control of the B&M, MEC also came into the New Haven sphere. In 1914 a group of investors purchased a controlling interest in MEC from B&M and independence was re-established. This notwithstanding, from 1933 to 1955 the two railroads entered into an agreement to be operated as separate railroads under a common management and shared many general officers. In the Guilford/PanAm era the two roads have been operated as a single system.\n\nMost of the MEC materials that we present in our On-Line Archives were submitted and scanned by Archives Committee member David Ashenden.\n\nMaine Central Abandonments\n\nAccounting Equipment, 1924 (MECRR Magazine)\n\nChronology, 1976 (MEC Messenger)\n\nFrankenstein Trestle, Notes on the Name of\n\nRules Review Book, March 1943, pp 1-17, pp 18-33\n\nMaine Central Railroad.
