        "text": "Support Boston Elevated Railway No. 5821 Today!\n\nToday is GivingTuesday, a global generosity movement and day of giving. Seashore Trolley Museum is raising funds on GivingTuesday to repair both trucks on Boston Elevated Railway No. 5821.\n\nNo. 5821 has been part of our operating fleet for several years. Perhaps you even took a ride on 5821 during your last Seashore visit. No. 5821 is known as our “pumpkin trolley” during our Pumpkin Patch events, and every Christmas Prelude we deck 5821 out in holiday greens for members and guests to enjoy. Most guests with mobility challenges that have utilized our Mobilift have taken a ride in 5821 over the past three seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, the harsh Maine climate has taken its toll on No. 5821. Cracks have recently appeared in both trucks due to the long-term effects of corrosion, taking this trolley off line until these repairs can take place. One traction motor has badly worn armature bearings and needs to be completely rebuilt. We may be able to repair one truck in-house, but the second truck and motor will need to be sent out to a third party contractor for repairs.\n\nPlease help us raise $20,000 on GivingTuesday by making a donation towards these repairs so that Boston Elevated Railway No. 5821 may rejoin our operating fleet.\n\nAny donation amount is appreciated! To support No. 5821, please designate your gift to Fund 545.\n\nThe Operating History of No. 5821\n\nPhotos 1 and 2: No. 5821 parked at Talbott Park, 2021; Seashore Trolley Museum collection.\n\nPhoto 3: No. 5821 in service, date unknown; Ed Ramsdell collection.\n\nPhoto 4: The interior of 5821 at Seashore, 2018; Kenyon F.
