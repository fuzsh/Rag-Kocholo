        "text": "The best place to railfan in the city of Boston is at Readville station, a Trains Magazine \"Hot Spot\" (one of two in Mass., the other being Palmer, MA).\n\nAt Readville, you have four MBTA lines (Fairmount, Providence, Stoughton, & Franklin), Amtrak Acela and Regional service, plus CSX's Readville freight yard. Take a Fairmount shuttle train from South Station or ride one of the Franklin trains to get there from the city.\n\nOn any given weekday morning and afternoon, there is approx. 15 trains per hour or more passing through Readville. There are multiple connected platforms, and trains come at you from all 4 points of the compass as there is a rail bridge (the old NY&NE crossing the old B&P) that is in use by some Franklin line trains (and CSX).\n\nReadville station is safe during daylight hours, but I wouldn't want to hang out there at night. Not that it's a particularly rough neighborhood, but there aren't too many residences around the immediate station area and it's mostly run-down industrial (IOW, isolated).\n\nReadville was also the home of the New Haven RR's main shop complex (from 1900 to 1957), most of which is still standing today, tho' not in RR use. The old Loco shop is now owned by John Hancock and used for document storage. The freight car shop is long gone but the yard in front is still in use by the MBTA for tie storage and some work equipment. The passenger car shops and other buildings are still standing, but are used by various firms (once, the Boston School Dept. used it for a garage for busses). The old Dedham line also curved off the main at Readville next to the shops, and is still somewhat visible tho' long gone.\n\nAs I said, CSX has a pretty good presence at Readville, but it's mostly just local freights using the yard (GP40's, etc.) with transfers of freight from Framingham, Mansfield, Attleboro, etc. using the yard.\n\nIf you go during the morning or afternoon rush, you might want to make your own schedule showing when all trains would be going through. I did once, and it was the only way to get in place to take a shot of each train. I had to move quickly at times to get the shot because the traffic is that busy. Fun, but tiring.\n\nPaul A. Cutler III\n\n*******************\n\nWeather Or No Go New Haven\n\n*******************\n\nDowntown Boston is the end of the line, almost no freight. North Station has just MBTA Commuter Rail to the North plus a few Amtrak \"Downeaster\" runs to Portland Maine. Pan Am Rail (formally Gilford Rail System, formally Boston & Maine) working with Norfolk Southern enter the Boston area by way of Ayer MA and then over MBTA tracks.\n\nSouth Station is where the Passenger action is. MBTA Commuter Rail (diesel) to the Southeast (Plymouth), South (Providence, RI) and West (Worcester). Amtrak Corridor Service (Electric Power), Regionals and hourly Acela (Bullet Train) Service to New York and Washington. Freight trains only work at night.\n\nCSX run there Container trains west out of Alston in the evening and have a freight yard in Framingham. As stated above, Worcester is the first city west where Freight action can be watched. Worcester is the home of the Providence & Worcester with its yard and shops.\n\nMBTA \"should\" let you take photos from \"public areas\" but they reserve the right to question you and ask for identification.\n\nAre you into LRV Trolleys? The MBTA operates there \"Riverside Line\" over the former Boston & Albany tracks from downtown to I-95 in the suburbs. (out past Fenway Park)"
