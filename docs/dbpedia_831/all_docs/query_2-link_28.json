        "text": "LOWELL — A rare celestial event will take place Monday afternoon in the form of a solar eclipse that traverses across the U.S., and whether you are traveling to the path of totality or staying in Greater Lowell, you will have the opportunity to see quite a show.\n\nThe path of the eclipse begins in the Pacific Ocean before it will cross into Mexico, and then Texas, after which it will cut through much of the Midwest before reaching northern New England. While Greater Lowell does not lie within the path of totality, the area in which viewers will see the moon block the sun entirely, there will still be a significant eclipse to be seen from here. According to UMass Lowell physics associate professor Silas Laycock, from Lowell the moon will appear to cover about 95% of the sun.\n\n“That means that the sun will appear as a beautiful, narrow crescent,” Laycock said in a phone call Thursday afternoon.\n\nLaycock and UML will host an eclipse viewing party on River View Field on the university’s South Campus, where there will be a setup of special solar telescopes through which it will be safe to look directly at the sun. There will also be free eclipse viewing glasses available, without which it is dangerous to look directly at the eclipse.\n\nIf anyone finds themselves unable to make it to the viewing party and unable to procure a pair of proper viewing glasses, Laycock said there are still options for viewing the eclipse at home.\n\n“Anything with small holes makes a wonderful projector. Go into your kitchen and grab a colander, every one of those little holes in it will project the crescent shape,” said Laycock.\n\nLaycock said he hopes to test out a trick he recently learned in which a disco ball can produce a similar effect, where it reflects the light from the eclipsed sun onto surrounding surfaces in the shape of a thin crescent at the peak.\n\nLaycock has attempted to be in the path of totality twice in his life, with thoroughly mixed results. The first time was in 1999, when he was in France on a cloudy day, so he could only make out an outline before the clouds made the whole spectacle invisible to him. He would have his redemption 18 years later in Idaho during the 2017 eclipse, which he said was simply “fantastic.”\n\nThe moon will begin to cover the sun at about 2:15 p.m. Monday in Lowell, with the peak taking place at 3:29 p.m. The spectacle will end at about 4:38 p.m.\n\nThe eclipse will take place roughly during the time that kids will be finishing their school days on Monday. Because of that, Laycock appealed to teachers and school administrators to try to allow the students to be outside to view the eclipse if they have a way to do so safely.\n\n“It would be such a good educational opportunity,” said Laycock.\n\nBecause there will not be a total eclipse in Greater Lowell, you should not look directly at the sun without proper viewing glasses or a proper solar filter on a viewing device at any point in the duration of the eclipse.\n\nUMass Lowell will be represented somewhere in the path of totality, with couple Edwin Aguirre and Imelda Joson making their 13th trip to the path of totality of a solar eclipse. Aguirre is a senior science and technology writer and editor for UML, and Joson is a contract photographer. Over decades, the couple has traveled across the globe to see one of the most stunning natural phenomena there is. This year, they said the wildly inconsistent weather, attributable perhaps to climate change, has really complicated their planning process.\n\n“The original forecasts were telling people that Mexico and Texas would be the best place to see the eclipse. They have the longest time of totality, and the best chances for clear skies,” said Aguirre. “We started planning over the last year. Imelda made several reservations along the eclipse track, from Texas to up here in New England. Now within the last month, all of the weather models have shifted.”\n\nNow, the Northeast is predicted to have a better chance of clear skies, but even that was up in the air with just a few days to go until showtime.\n\n“If we manage to find a successful site, we need a Ph.D in meteorology,” said Joson.\n\nThey had been planning to go somewhere in northern New York or Vermont, but with uncertain weather they were leaning towards somewhere in Maine as of Thursday. If the bad weather follows them, it would be just the second time in 13 attempts that clouds blocked the spectacular view. The other time was in China in 2009, when during a cloudy day with a light drizzle, everything went completely dark for a few minutes, and they knew they had missed it.\n\nBeyond keeping an extra close eye on the weather forecast, Joson and Aguirre have a lot of expert advice for those looking to make the trip to the path of totality. For starters, the areas in and around the path will likely be subject to heavy traffic, especially the more rural areas that are not built for a large influx of people, which would describe much of northern New England in the path of the eclipse.\n\nThere is inherent risk involved in viewing an eclipse as it involves looking at the sun. When viewing the eclipse while standing in the path of totality, you should be wearing proper eclipse glasses to look at the sun until totality begins, and then put them back on before it ends three and half minutes later. If you are watching the eclipse from outside of totality, you should wear eclipse glasses or view it through a proper filter the entire time.\n\nThe beginning and end of totality are marked by what Aguirre and Joson describe as a “diamond ring.” The silhouette of the moon leaves room for a ring of sunlight around the edges, with one focused spot of extremely bright sunlight shining “like a diamond on an engagement ring,” which then succumbs to the sudden darkness of the moon fully blocking the sun during totality.\n\nWhen viewing the eclipse through an optical device like a telescope or binoculars outside of totality, Aguirre and Joson warned that you should not wear the glasses to do so, but instead have a proper solar filter lens mounted on the front of the optic. Looking at the partial phase of an eclipse through a telescope or pair of binoculars without a filter risks severe and possibly permanent eye injury, with or without the glasses.\n\n“There is no eclipse worth losing your eyesight,” said Aguirre.\n\nIn the path of totality, Aguirre said the spectacle is not just about the dance between the sun and the moon.\n\n“You will feel the temperature drop around you by 10 degrees or more. If you look around, you will see on the horizon all around you a 360-degree sunset,” said Aguirre. “If you look up, you will be able to see the stars and planets like Venus and Jupiter.”\n\nThe next eclipse to come through the mainland U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044, when the shadow of the moon will cross south through Canada into parts of the northern U.S.\n\nFor professional eclipse chasers like Aguirre and Joson, the next solar eclipses will be primarily in Spain in 2026, Egypt and North Africa in 2027 and Australia in 2028."
