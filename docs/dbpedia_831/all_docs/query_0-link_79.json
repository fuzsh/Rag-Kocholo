This past weekend I drove the line near rt 27. The ROW has now been paved for the bike path. In a way it's sad to see the old tracks ripped up.\n\nI do remember that Deck Homes would get bulk head flat car shipments. There was not a spur so you would be able to see the cars set out while driving over crossing.\n\nIt is hard to imaging 80+ car frieght trains ever using the line. That unfortunately was before my time.\n\nJust to share a different perspective on the line. There was one home owner that I spoke to who's house is near the tracks. She was an elderly lady and lived in the area most of her life. She mentioned that many of the trains would run at night. She told me that her Uncle use to work on the line back in the steam days. She told me it was much different back then and you could set your clock to when the trains would pass. She told of a time when she and her Uncle rode in the caboose going to Lowell then rode in the engine from Lowell back to West Concord. She mentioned how friendly the crews were and would often wave when the trains would pass by. She said sometime the conductor would throw candy from the caboose to the children near the west Concord station. She also made it point to tell me when she was very young she would see many hobo's on the trains going to Lowell.\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n18\n\nJoined\n\nThu Oct 11, 2007 11:59 am\n\n#609786 by davidp\n\nFri Dec 05, 2008 12:26 pm\n\nConrailWConcord1982_small.jpg\n\nHere's a picture of Conrail GP-9 7272 crossing the B&M at West Concord in 1982.

Concord. It looks a lot different now. The station is still standing and has just been recently painted. There is a breakfast restaurant there so you can check out the inside of the station. I have a photo somewhere taken in the 80's of a GP crossing over RT2 in Concord. I can imagine the back up that would cause now.\n\nI came across a few more photos of BL1 and LB2.

There was a fatality of a High School student falling off of it and the town wanted it removed immediately.\n\nI went to summer camp in West Concord during the mid 70's and I recall vividly that the northbound would come through almost always during our \"second swim\" which was around 2PM. The camp was located on the west side of the line between Williams Road and Powder Mill road. Power in the PC days was 3-4 units, U25's, GP30's GP9's RS3 what ever 4-axle power worked out of the Dover Street/Readville/Framingham area could be found on the line.\n\nHere are some shots of BL-1 making its way through West Concord:\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20061 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20051 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20051 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nTrains during the mid 70's would routinely run between 65-85 cars, almost always had a green NC5 type caboose on the tail end. Often the train was held back at Williams Road, until they had clearance from Waltham Tower over the diamond, this was to prevent the Old Marlbourough Road and Williams road crossings from being blocked. I recall that there was a fishtail semaphore just south of Williams road, that would have been just out of sight from the car window crossing the tracks, but if you walked past the curve it was there. The other fishtail was just north of Route 2 and If any had been over that crossing in the day I'm sure you remember it.\n\nHere are some of the PC local,\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20051 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20051 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nWhen PC became Conrail, very soon after the line was severed right at the route 110 crossing in Chelmsford (MP25 or was it 26?). The B&M took over servicing customers on the north end of the line, the last one of which was Interstate Container. In the 80's the north end was further clipped back at he Industrial Avenue crossing about the time the Wang Tower was constructed.\n\nPics Below show the Wye in Lowell, the train was on the east/south leg that came in right at the tower, the track at right connected at the north end of the \"new side\".\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20031 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nOne more night shot at Interstate Container in the winter of 1987\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20040 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nThe switch at right led to a track that I can not recall by name, but at one time crossed right over the Bleachery interlocking ( I was standing on the abutment taking the photo) and connected with the Lowell Branch of the B&M just west of the Concord River. There was a connection on the west/north end was referred to as the Hill track (where the train is) connected with the oil track(wher the CSX box is) in the Bleachery Interlocking that paralleled the SB track and became the New Yard Lead south of the interlocking at Gorham Street(Bleachery)\n\nHere is pic of a B&M switcher on that connection\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20040 ... ODE=&POYE=\n\nService by Conrail lasted until the time the diamond was removed, as far as Wicks Lumber in North Acton, the other late Conrail customer was Acorn Structures just north of the Rte 2 Crossing. During the final months of service under Conrail, the line was served on Tuesdays and Saturdays\n\nWhen the diamonds were pulled in West Concord, service was transferred to the Springfield Terminal who trucked in a Track mobile that was used between West Concord and North Acton and what I rceall was service on the northern portion of the old NH Armory branch (Hazardville branch).\n\nIn the summer of 1986 the line was transferred to the Bay Colony who used former Dansville and Mt Morris 44 toners 410 and 411 to operate the line, service was twice weekly as I recall. I believe the 411 was the last unit to service the line, it was kept on the property at Wickes Lumber when not in use. Pics below show the BCLR shoving across Rte 2 and AY-4 on the interchange track in West Concord.\n\nhttp://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?20031 ...

Thank you for posting them as well as providing additional insight to the operation of the line. Again it is hard to imagine looking at the line today that 85 car freight trains were ever on the line. Here are some photos that I came across that shows how overgrown the line has become since its abandonment. I did remember reading a study that was being conducted by the Mass Dept of Transportation on the usability of the line for possible commuter service. It was a preliminary study, which never ended up going anywhere.\n\nhttp://www.oldrr.com/fl/flgallery1/index.html\n\nhttp://www.oldrr.com/66/index.html\n\nDoes anyone have any information as to when Carlise Station (which was in Westford / just off Rt 27) was removed? I know there is what seems to be a foundation left, but it is pretty over grown.\n\nDoes anyone know where the actual connection to the old Nashua & South Acton RR was made? From the maps it looks like it was just south of Rt 27 in Acton. I know the N&SA RR was abandoned in the 30's so there may not be much evidence of the connection.\n\nIf anyone has any interesting stories from watching trains on the line or interesting tid bits please share. For some of us that all we have to go on since the line was abandoned before our time. Also any additional photos would always be welcome.\n\nI want to thank everyone for their contributions to this thread. It is very informative and great reading.\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n18\n\nJoined\n\nThu Oct 11, 2007 11:59 am\n\n#710477 by Lincoln78\n\nThu Aug 27, 2009 7:25 pm\n\nMy thanks as well. I grew up nearby and watched this line from about 1967-78 during trips along 2A and to the shopping/medical hub of West Concord. I appreciated the \"Whistle Stop\" sign\n\nI only remember seeing two trains, both northbound, probably in the 68-72 timeframe. One was in West Concord, awaiting the signal to cross the B&M. The other was along Rt 2A between 2 and 27. I don't recall thinking that it was moving very slowly (my reference would have been freights through Lincoln on the B&M). Not certain if there were any grade crossings between 2 and 27.\n\nI was in West Concord earlier this month for the first time in about twenty years. Evidence of the junction is largely gone, although one tracks diamond is mounted in concrete to the south of the former diamond with a few park benches. A memorial stone notes that at its height the junction saw 150 trains a day. Wish I had that time machine...\n\nI appreciated the \"Whistle Stop\" sign on one of the pictures. The depot now has a small cafe.\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n252\n\nJoined\n\nWed Jul 14, 2004 7:46 am\n\n#716845 by Flange Man\n\nTue Sep 15, 2009 11:04 am\n\nHere is an intersteting article on the lease agreement on the line.\n\nhttp://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-fr ... 838B699FDE\n\nHere is a plan back from 1987 for the bike path.

There's no real evidence of it today other than remnants of a siding. Note that if you're planning to walk the track its best to park at NARA park and enter from the Rte 27 crossing as access from Harris Street is blocked by private property. I've read that when the Old Colony and NA&B where both in business they each maintained one of two tracks from Concord Junction to North Acton.\n\nDave\n\nDave\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n132\n\nJoined\n\nThu May 27, 2004 8:41 pm\n\nLocation\n\nBoxborough, MA\n\n#718127 by eddiebehr\n\nFri Sep 18, 2009 10:41 pm\n\nI haven't been here for a long, long time. Here's what I know about the Framingham and Lowell branch. I rode it in 1967 on one of those Nelson Blount excursions using CPR#127. The train came out of Providence and used a set of commuter cars, mostly American Flyers. The NH maintained this line in fairly good condition and there must have been a very favorable rate division to have the road keep this line going for so long. There was very little on-line business; most traffic was B & M interchange at Lowell.\n\nI do remember at least one potato train. Late one Fall we went for a Sunday ride to Little Tree Farms on Pleasant St., Framingham (Route 30). This is right by where the Lowell Branch crosses the Mass. Pike. I was probably 14 or 15 at the time (1958-1960) and bored. I heard an airhorn blasting for crossings and eventually one of NH's Alco road-switchers showed up pulling a string of STATE of MAINE reefers. (I worked for the Boston and Maine 1968-86 - in the office-and whatever remained of solid trains of potato traffic went through Worcester and there weren't many of them. Penn Central killed off that business.)\n\nI have 1890 and 1893 Official Guides and for a time there was a through train from Concord, NH to New York via the Nashua-West Concord route. There was also a NY-Portland day train via Mansfield and Framingham about 1910.\n\nThe Nashua, Acton and Boston contracted with the Framingham and Lowell to build its single track line beside the F & L main line between North Acton and Concord Jct. As far as I know, the only physical connection was at Concord Jct. From what I can determine the F & L owned the line. I've been told the junction at North Acton was opposite where the Wickes Corp.\n\nSeveral passenger trains detoured on the Framingham and Lowell branch. I think it was after the two big 1954 hurricanes, Carol and Edna - not sure which one - the Washingtonian went via this route. In 1955 the State of Maine came south in broad daylight after Hurricane Hazel. There was flooding somewhere, don't know if it was on the WN & P or P & W.\n\nTwo of my younger brothers, a neighbor kid and I used to bike up to South Sudbury from the north side of Framingham on days off from school or during summer. We used to catch B & M's two car Hudson-Boston train. Like clockwork, about 15 minutes later, the NH's local freight to Lowell would show up. Business at South Sudbury in 1959-1960 was Suburban Propane and a public delivery track.\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n133\n\nJoined\n\nThu Feb 16, 2006 8:54 pm\n\n#724467 by Flange Man\n\nWed Oct 07, 2009 2:35 pm\n\nThank you for all your input on the F&L eddiebehr. I do remember reading that there was a steam excursion that was run on the line as well as a Maine Potato train. It was very interesting to read of the thru passenger trains and special moves made on the line. This was well before my time. Your contribution is very interesting. I am left with only my imagination, photos and stories from people whom experienced the line during its operation. I have walked almost the entire line, before the bike path came along. Looking at the rails, it was clear that the NH put some money into maintaining the line. Even after all those years, the rail looked to be in good shape.\n\nI was talking with someone recently who told me that at one point many years ago Conrail considered opening up the line to interchange traffic with Guilford. As we all know, they went with the Guilford connection through Ayer. They were even preliminary studies conducted on the line.\n\nI want to thank everyone for sharing their stories and photos of the F&L line. Anyone with any other information regarding special moves, photos, etc please share. It is very interesting to read.\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n18\n\nJoined\n\nThu Oct 11, 2007 11:59 am\n\n#724623 by davidp\n\nWed Oct 07, 2009 10:25 pm\n\n[quote=\"Flange Man\"] I was talking with someone recently who told me that at one point many years ago Conrail considered opening up the line to interchange traffic with Guilford.

It was left out the original system by USRA, and bought by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. By the time Conrail began operating it under state contract, the section from Chelmsford to Lowell had been severed, which would have made restoration of through operation very expensive compared to alternative gateways like Worcester, Springfield or Rotterdam Juncton.\n\nDave\n\nDave\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n132\n\nJoined\n\nThu May 27, 2004 8:41 pm\n\nLocation\n\nBoxborough, MA\n\n#724864 by Flange Man\n\nThu Oct 08, 2009 4:07 pm\n\nI was surprised as well to hear that conrail had considered opening the line again at one point (late 80's - early 90's). I agree a considerable amount of work would have been needed to rehabilitate the line. I guess it was considered before the Worcester to Ayer line was reactivated by Guilford. Since that line needed much less work it was chosen. This was at the time when North East traffic was being handled by Selkirk and less out of East Deerfield. The person who told me about it did not say how serious conrail was on opening the line again. My bet is that it was not a serious consideration due to the amount of work required and buying back state land.\n\nUsername\n\nPosts\n\n18\n\nJoined\n\nThu Oct 11, 2007 11:59 am"
