        "text": "The MBTA service area covered by the existing Commuter Rail service—an area roughly equivalent to the communities designated as “Metropolitan Boston” by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC)—contains nearly 75% of the state’s population and 75% of its jobs. This region deserves an intercity rail service that reflects these realities. Instead we are settling for a service delivery model that remains essentially unchanged from its mid-20th century origins. Massachusetts can and should embark on a transformative approach to regional mobility that more effectively supports a growing 21st century economy. This white paper outlines specific steps that can be taken in the short, middle, and long terms to fulfill this vision.\n\nThe current Massachusetts Commuter Rail system operates on the long-outdated 20th century belief that intercity rail service exists primarily for suburban workers who need to get in and out of the city on traditional 9 to 5 rush hour schedules. This approach diminishes the utility of our intercity rail assets and ignores how people work and live in this century. Our regional rail vision is practical, cost-effective, and based upon national and global experience and best practices. See Appendix A and the Lessons Learned from International Best Practices referenced there for examples of these principles in action. It is a forward-looking vision, one that recognizes the untapped power of rail to move large numbers of people throughout the day in a relatively low-carbon and efficient manner. Massachusetts has most of the tools, and a good deal of the infrastructure, necessary to implement this plan; what is now needed is the commitment to make it happen.\n\nThis report is the product of a collaborative effort among TransitMatters members. We hope it will inform MBTA and regional policymaking, and spark earnest dialogue and discussion among all stakeholders. Our rail network looms as the most important, and most poorly utilized, mobility asset we have. This can—and should—be an opportunity to cast away old ways of thinking about rail and move toward implementation of a forward-looking Regional Rail system.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nMetropolitan Boston has two transit systems. One system, primarily served by buses and\n\nsubways, runs with frequent service to many destinations within the inner urban core.\n\nThe other system, the Commuter Rail network, serves suburban commuters, with service\n\nlargely at rush hour, and one- or two-hour service gaps between trains at other times.\n\nMBTA Commuter Rail operates as a mid-20th century service and reflects all of that\n\nera’s biases about where people and jobs are located, and about individual mobility\n\npreferences. It assumes everyone works 9 to 5 on weekdays, and that travelers must be\n\nlured from their cars with ample parking. As a result, it does not adequately serve people\n\nin 21st-century Metro Boston who work weekends or non-traditional hours, many of\n\nwhom are low-income service workers. The current approach to Commuter Rail service\n\ncontributes to the region’s chronic and worsening traffic congestion. It also exacerbates\n\nincome inequality, since the inadequate service for lower-income workers forces them\n\nto drive; for many lower-income households, vehicle expenses are a large fraction of\n\nhousehold spending, requiring difficult cutbacks elsewhere.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Commuter Rail system is not functioning at a high level\n\neven during peak travel times. During rush hour, office workers commute to Downtown\n\nBoston on crowded trains that too often provide unreliable and uncomfortable service.\n\nExpanding peak Commuter Rail capacity has run into significant construction and\n\noperating costs. And the current system itself is expensive to run, with fully loaded annual\n\noperating costs of ~$400 million. We agree with the concern recently expressed by the\n\nChairman of the MBTA’s Fiscal Management and Control Board (FMCB): the current\n\nCommuter Rail paradigm costs “way too much money for way too little ridership.” In the\n\nspirit of problem solving, TransitMatters offers this vision—both a planning vision and a\n\nbusiness model vision—for making smart investments that will reduce costs over time\n\nand increase ridership.\n\nRegional Rail is a reliable and more cost-effective intercity rail system based on a 21st\n\ncentury business model. Rail offers unparalleled capacity: ten times as much as a single\n\nfreeway lane. Making Regional Rail a reality means reimagining the existing Commuter\n\nRail system as a more subway-like service, with frequent service all day.\n\nTransitioning to and investing in a fully functional Regional Rail system will dramatically\n\nincrease reliability and capacity, and offer substantial cost and service benefits and\n\nsavings over time. This investment would dramatically increase reliability and capacity.\n\nIt would generate significant operating cost savings, since electric trains cost half as\n\nmuch as diesel trains on a lifecycle basis, and off-peak trains have lower marginal costs\n\nthan peak trains. Moreover, this investment would eliminate the need for South Station\n\nExpansion, a proposed $2 billion project doubling down on the outdated 19th and 20th\n\ncentury stub-terminal inter-city rail model that would further ossify Commuter Rail as a\n\npeak-only service. The money intended for South Station expansion should be diverted to\n\nregional rail modernization.\n\nFaster Rides\n\nEMUs accelerate and decelerate much faster than trains pulled by locomotives, especially diesel locomotives. The difference is more than a minute per station when the top speed is 60 mph. Together with speed benefits coming from higher reliability and level boarding, Regional Rail would offer higher average speeds. Future all-local trains would be faster than today’s express trains, averaging 30 mph on the Fairmount Line, 43 mph on the Worcester and Franklin Lines, and 50-55 mph on the remaining lines.17 Faster trip times allow the same number of trains to run more trips in a day. In addition to the added capacity of additional trips, this leads to greater utilization rates for capital assets and investment. When combined with higher ridership, the cost per passenger savings of regional rail will be substantial.\n\nA significant component of trip time is dwell time, or the time spent sitting at each station. Dwell time is decreased by level boarding from high platforms and by better passenger flow within the train cars. EMUs are designed to maximize passenger ingress and egress (i.e. more and wider doors like a subway car) and as such are almost always specified as single level cars rather than the bi-levels now common on the MBTA Commuter Rail network. Any passenger capacity decreases arising from the use of single level EMUs will be easily offset by the increased frequency made possible by the inherent efficiencies of the modern regional rail network.\n\nRegional Rail is a mode for both central cities and suburbs. It holds the promise of strengthening town centers with improved connections to other parts of the region. Because EMUs enable all-local service to still be fast, improvements to Boston’s mainline rail system can and will benefit both urban and suburban users. Investments made in the Fairmount and Providence Lines, for example, would give residents of Dorchester, Mattapan, and Hyde Park access to jobs in suburban towns like Dedham and Norwood, with trains running through to the Franklin Line.\n\nDelaying electrification until the NSRL tunnel opens is unlikely to save money—it would delay the purchase of EMUs by a few years, during which the existing diesel-powered fleet would continue to deteriorate. Building the tunnel is likely to take 10 to 20 years. In the meantime, Regional Rail can advance through a number of important intermediate\n\nsteps that provide immediate benefit to riders and meaningful cost savings to the MBTA.\n\nThe Commonwealth should electrify the MBTA Commuter Rail network. The best way to do this is line by line, so that the MBTA can replace the diesel equipment on each line with new EMUs. The MBTA can thus move diesel trains to the remaining lines and retire the worst-performing rolling stock. Given that Connecticut and other jurisdictions use EMUs today, there may be an opportunity for Massachusetts to “piggy-back” on EMU procurements by others, securing competitive pricing and earlier delivery of equipment. Electrification should be implemented at the same time as high platforms so the MBTA can procure EMUs without the current equipment’s steps, which require manual operation, delay passenger boarding and alighting, and make the schedule less reliable.\n\nThe Providence Line is already electrified for the use of Amtrak’s services. Only short MBTA siding and yard segments are unelectrified. Thus the first priority is to complete electrification on this line, as well as on the Stoughton Line, which consists of just four miles of branch route and enters Boston via the inner Providence Line. The bulk of the work on the Providence and Stoughton Lines requires upgrading stations with high level platforms. Improving these lines would reduce the speed difference between the MBTA and Amtrak by about two thirds, simplifying the schedule (where today fast Amtrak trains share track with slower Commuter Rail trains). We anticipate funding participation coming from both Amtrak and Rhode Island as these initiatives benefit riders using Amtrak and living or working in Rhode Island.26 Signal systems do not pose a barrier to electrification of the line, as explained further in the Technical Information Appendix B.\n\nThe next priority should be the Fairmount Line. All but two of the line’s stations (Readville and Fairmount) have high platforms, and the line is short, with closely-spaced stations, making the high acceleration rates of EMUs especially useful. Moreover, the line could use the Providence Line’s electrical substations, reducing costs. See Appendix C2 for more detail on the Fairmount Line.\n\nThe MBTA should lease DMUs, if possible, to immediately improve service on the Fairmount Line until electrification can be completed; this is appropriate given the long history of social justice issues tied to the corridor, whose residents have not received equitable and reliable mobility. The use of leased DMUs might also serve as mitigation on the Worcester line during the anticipated temporary track constraints related to construction activities associated with West Station and the larger Allston Landing development. Use of leased DMUs as a short term measure in these special circumstances should not obscure the reality that the facts and data point to the procurement of EMUs as the best approach to improving intercity rail service. Any short-term adoption of DMU technology for these limited duration purposes should be paired with an unambiguous promise and clear timeline for the switchover to EMUs.\n\nElectrification of the Providence, Stoughton, and Fairmount Lines should begin as soon as possible, ideally in this decade. The other lines should follow. We encourage the MBTA to select metrics that reflect the importance and efficiency of electrifying each line and follow a data-driven process in selecting the subsequent order of electrification.\n\nAs each line is electrified, the MBTA must commit to running frequent local service on it. Trains should come at least every 15 minutes at rush hour and every 30 minutes offpeak on each branch. Urban lines, such as Fairmount, and the inner ends of some other lines could provide supplemental service, such as every 10 minutes at peak and every 15 minutes off-peak. The terminals at North and South Stations are set up in a way that permits lines to enter and depart the stations without interfering with the other lines. Thus, frequent EMU service on the Providence, Stoughton, and Fairmount can coexist with less frequent diesel service on other lines.\n\nImplementing Regional Rail best practices has a transformative effect as seen in the comparison below:\n\nAppendix A\n\nLessons Learned from International Best Practices\n\nThe following examples of regional rail systems across the globe provide important lessons that inform our thinking. While there is no precisely exact analogue to Metro Boston, these examples demonstrate the effectiveness and importance of electrification, high-level platforms and connecting stub-end terminals as approaches to providing riders with a rail service that serves their mobility needs.\n\nNote: All dollar figures cited are in US dollars, adjusted for exchange rates and inflation.\n\nParis: A Best Practices Model\n\nWith a combined 1.1 billion riders a year, Paris’s RER (“Réseau Express Régional” or Regional Express Network) and Transilien regional rail networks carry more passengers than nearly any other city in the world. The only busier systems are in Japan and South Korea, where there is little technological distinction between Commuter Rail and the subway, and in India, where the Mumbai Suburban Railway substitutes for a subway and is infamously dangerous and overcrowded. As the busiest proper regional rail system running alongside a separate metro\n\nsystem, the RER is a useful case study for Boston.\n\nParis historically had six intercity rail terminals and three smaller terminals used only by commuter lines. It had some frequent service starting in the 1920s, but no real regional integration. In 1937-8, Metro operator RATP bought one isolated commuter line, the Ligne de Sceaux, and electrified it and began running frequent service, treating it as a regional Metro line. The diagrams to the right show the evolution of the Paris RER network.\n\nParis’ model has been copied worldwide with Commuter Rail transformations in Toronto (RER) and Brussels (RER). In the last two decades, London has also invested in two RER-like projects, both of which run through central London: Thameslink connecting the Brighton Main Line and the Midland Main Line with an unused short rail link, and Crossrail which connects the Great Western Main Line to the Great Eastern Main Line and the North London Line with 13 mi of deep bore tunnels.\n\nPredating Paris’s transformation, Philadelphia connected its two legacy Commuter Rail networks, the Reading and Pennsylvania Railroads. Similar to our preferred version of the NSRL, the connecting tunnel is short and includes 4 tracks. Unfortunately, SEPTA did not complete relatively inexpensive complementary capital projects to support more efficient use. The only through-running American rail doesn’t come close to its full potential. They have also begun terminating many trains downtown. Thus, our plan for regional rail and the NSRL would make Boston a pioneer among American transit agencies.\n\nMunich: Connecting Two Stub-End Train Terminals\n\nLike Boston, Munich historically had two main stub-end train terminals: Hauptbahnhof (Main Station) and Ostbahnhof (East Station). Passengers transferring between these stations had to use the city’s overcrowded streetcar network.\n\nSince 1930 the German term for regional rail, including high frequency and through-running, has been S-Bahn, where S stands for Stadtschnell (city-fast). But whereas Berlin and Hamburg had such systems for decades, Munich would have to wait. There were recurrent plans for underground rail tunnels; a plan for an S-Bahn network from the Nazi era began construction in 1938, with an east-west and north-south tunnel, but the works were suspended in the war and little had been built. After the war, West Germany recovered quickly, and Munich grew especially fast, but infrastructure was inadequate. Plans for both a municipal subway and an S-Bahn run by national railway DB resumed, reducing the S-Bahn to just one east-west tunnel connecting Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof.\n\nBoth the subway and the S-Bahn began construction in 1965. In the next year, Munich was chosen as the host city for the 1972 Summer Olympics, forcing both projects to accelerate. In the next six years, not only did the region build the east-west tunnel and the first subway line, but also it electrified the commuter lines that hadn’t yet been wired, and lengthened and raised the platforms to allow for long trains, comparable to 8.5-car American trains.\n\nTo reduce costs, the S-Bahn was not built to the same standards on the outer branches as in the city. Some branches are single-track, and some require S-Bahn trains to share track with intercity passenger and freight trains. Since the system’s initial opening there has been additional construction, but these design compromises still impose constraints on the system’s timetable. To resolve them, Munich invented the clockface schedule, in which timetables repeat regularly all day on a prescribed interval, such as every 20 minutes. Riders began crowding the system. Daily ridership had crept up from 114,000 in 1961 to 160,000 when the system opened, but then reached 250,000 by the end of 1972, 430,000 at the end of the 1970s, and 640,000 in 1987. Today there are 840,000 passengers per day.27 Some lines today run every 10 minutes, combining to a peak frequency of a train every 2 minutes in the central tunnel.\n\nMunich rail network trains are very crowded, and as a result, there have been plans to build a second east-west tunnel to add capacity. However, with more underground infrastructure in Munich today than there was in the 1960s, construction has run into schedule and budget overruns. The second tunnel, under construction since last year, is now projected to open in 2026 and cost $1.1 billion per underground mile, the second highest figure outside the English-speaking world (the RER A, at $1.2 billion, is first). At this cost, the NSRL tunnel could be built for $6 billion.\n\nBoston had 80 years of head start on Munich in building underground urban rail. It has an opportunity to use NSRL to catch up. Munich’s innovations in scheduling show the MBTA how to run a fast, reliable schedule even with grade crossings and single-track segments on some branches. Conversely, Munich’s one failure, the mounting costs of the second S-Bahn tunnel, presents a strong argument for building a four-track NSRL from the start. It might look cheaper to start with two tracks and then expand to four later, but the lifetime costs would be much higher.\n\nPhiladelphia: A Tunnel Needs Trains\n\nLike Boston and Munich, Philadelphia historically had two separate stub-end train terminals: Suburban Station and Reading Terminal. Suburban Station was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad; intercity trains stopped just outside Center City, at 30th Street Station, which offered through-service from New York to Washington. Reading Terminal served the trains of the Reading Railroad as well as other railroads that competed with the Pennsylvania, such as the Baltimore and Ohio. Each station was about a quarter mile from City Hall, where the city’s two main subway lines intersect, but connecting between the two stations required walking the half mile.\n\nIn the 1970s, with both the Pennsylvania and Reading bankrupt, SEPTA took over both of their commuter rail networks, and began to plan to unify them. Both networks were already electrified, having been wired between the 1910s and 1930s. SEPTA designed the Center City Commuter Connection, a 1.8-mile tunnel connecting the two networks, extending four tracks of the already-underground Suburban Station to the east, with a new Market East station replacing the above-ground Reading Terminal. In today’s money it cost $1.24 billion; if the North-South Rail Link could built at the same cost per mile, it would cost $2 billion.\n\nThe effect was not as transformational as hoped. The through-service patterns originally proposed were based on European best industry practices, with high frequency on every branch, going up to a train every ten minutes. Unfortunately SEPTA ran trains infrequently off-peak, and fares were set at a premium over bus and subway fare even within the city. This is especially harmful to in-city ridership: several SEPTA Regional Rail branches run entirely within Philadelphia’s city limits, and all have weak ridership, even ones running parallel to overcrowded bus lines. This pattern of stronger ridership in the suburbs than in the city should not surprise Boston-based readers, since the Fairmount Line has relatively low ridership, and had the lowest ridership per mile when it charged premium fares.\n\nThus Philadelphia completed the expensive part of regional rail - the tunnel and electrification - but has refrained from increasing service and integrating fares with city transit. Nonetheless, with through-running offering suburbanites access to several Center City stops, SEPTA Regional Rail has slightly higher ridership than the MBTA commuter rail network, on barely half the route-length. It also has the lowest operating costs of all major American commuter rail systems: $14 per car-mile and $310 per car-hour, compared with $18.5 and $540 respectively on the MBTA.28\n\nIn terms of size, historic urban form, and transit usage, Philadelphia and Boston are similar. That SEPTA’s partial modernization (through-running and electrification, but no high frequency or fare integration) led to partial success (somewhat lower operating costs and ridership per route-mile) should make Boston more confident that full modernization of MBTA service would lead to full success.\n\nThe dwell time at each station is 30 seconds. This is based on many observations of train performance in Paris and in Zurich. In Paris, the observed trains have level boarding and many doors. In Zurich, the trains are bilevel and have two door pairs per car, some with level\n\nboarding and some without; all trains have wide doors and open circulation, permitting short dwell times.\n\nThe only exceptions observed to the 30-second dwell time rule are the busiest city center stations. At Paris’s Gare du Nord, rush hour trains on the RER B Line, with four pairs of doors per car, have about 500 passengers getting off and 500 getting on; the dwell time is about 60 seconds. Based on this, we believe Regional Rail should have 60-second dwell times at South Station, Central Station, and North Station, and 30-second dwell times everywhere else.\n\nFinally, to allow trains to recover from delays, schedules must be slightly padded. In Switzerland, the padding factor is 7%, since the trains are reliable and dwell times are predictable. This is the value we use; in contrast, American commuter operations pad 15% or even more, especially on lines with complex express service patterns.\n\nThe North-South Rail Link has had a few different variants in official proposals. Some variants have one tunnel and two tracks, others have two tunnels and four tracks. We back the four-track option, for two reasons. First, the tunnel portals to the south of the South Station are complex and constrained, and it is not possible to connect all lines to just one tunnel; in engineering studies going back to the 1990s, one tunnel portal would\n\nalways connect to Back Bay and the Providence and Worcester Lines, and the other to South Bay and the Fairmount and Old Colony Lines.\n\nSecond, there is not enough capacity with just two tracks. The maximum capacity on a two-track railroad is about 48 trains per hour—a train every 75 seconds—but only on driverless metro lines isolated from the national rail network. Commuter Rail lines top out\n\nat about 30 trains per hour in Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, and Munich—a train every two minutes. A more typical value, given the extent of branching expected on Regional Rail in Boston, is 24 trains per hour, a train every 2.5 minutes.\n\nWith ridership growth coming from better service, we expect peak travel demand to be well over 24 trains per hour across all lines entering Boston from the south. We estimate that peak Regional Rail traffic, across all lines feeding South Station today, would be 32-36 trains per hour. Calculating the same figure for the lines feeding North Station is more difficult, because Commuter Rail today has lower mode share on the north than on the south (most downtown jobs are closer to South than to North Station), and NSRL would change this, but total commute volume into Boston is about the same in the northern suburbs as in the southern ones.\n\nWe do not expect any capacity constraints except on the immediate approaches to North and South Stations, and on some segments shared with other types of trains such as the Providence Line, where any future high-speed rail service would require facilities for timed overtakes with Regional Rail.\n\nThe state Secretary of Transportation suggested at a December FMCB meeting that electrification could be problematic because of constraints on the signal system governing the minimum spacing between trains. In fact, what we propose has the opposite effect: repeating clockface schedules, with all-local trains, ensures that on the branches, trains are always 15 or 30 minutes apart; even the ancient legacy signals, requiring a few miles of separation between trains, can easily accommodate that. The only problems come from freight trains—but the only significant volumes of freight on the entire MBTA network are on the outermost portions of the Fitchburg and Haverhill Lines; the former (beyond Littleton) could just run trains every 30 minutes even at the peak, and the latter (beyond Ballardvale) is so short and has such slow passenger trains that mixing the two train types should not cause problems.\n\nThe NSRL tunnel should be built with three stations: South Station, Central Station/ Aquarium, and North Station. With large-diameter tunnels, it is possible to build stations entirely inside the tunnel, punching galleries between the two tunnels for cross-platform transfers. The NSRL project should set up these cross-platform transfers on the same model as in Hong Kong: Central Station should have same-direction cross-platform\n\ntransfers, while North and South Stations should have opposite-direction ones. This means people from the Back Bay portal could transfer cross-platform to the South Bay portal at South Station, for example going from Braintree to Back Bay or from Brockton to Boston Landing. On the north, people could similarly transfer at North Station, for example going between Brandeis and Salem.\n\nWe include a technical appendix for each of the MBTA’s commuter lines, explaining what needs to be done to upgrade it to Regional Rail standards, and what a future Regional Rail timetable would look like. The speed gains from electrification, top-line trains, level boarding, and the reduced padding coming from better reliability are very large: we estimate on average 40% speed gain, or 30% cut in travel time, even with the addition of some infill stops.\n\nThe MBTA is currently evaluating options for additional midday layover space, including land previously dedicated to West Station. With increased midday service frequency, the need to store trainsets close to downtown disappears, since overnight layover can be accommodated at yards near the ends of lines. The midday layover needs result from trains making only a single pair of trips—inbound in the morning peak and outbound in\n\nthe PM—a service pattern that Regional Rail would eliminate in favor of all day equipment utilization.The MBTA should proceed with the understanding that, with increased midday service and a North-South Rail Link, additional investments in expensive core facilities are unnecessary. Boston Engine Terminal(BET), the primary maintenance facility for the commuter rail system, is unable to perform service on south-side trainsets without a long, slow trip through the non-revenue Grand Junction line. With the North-South Rail Link, trains could simply run through from the south side to BET.\n\nThis section analyzes the advantages of potential infrastructure and service improvements for the MBTA’s Providence and Stoughton lines.\n\nProvidence/Stoughton line segments\n\nThe shared Providence and Stoughton Line extends along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) from South Station to Canton Junction, a distance of 15 miles.\n\nThe Providence line segment continues south from Canton Jct. along the NEC to Providence Station, and beyond, to Wickford Junction. This is 29 miles to Providence and another 19 miles to Wickford Jct.\n\nStoughton Line segment extends from Canton Jct. to Stoughton, a distance of 4 miles.\n\nThe Providence line from South Station through Rhode Island is the only rail line in the MBTA system that has full electrified infrastructure available. Amtrak has expressed interest in the MBTA electrifying Commuter Rail service along the NEC in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\nBecause the NEC is already electrified, the Providence Line offers the opportunity to almost immediately implement electrified rail service within the MBTA Commuter Rail system. Only short segments, used by the MBTA but not by Amtrak, are unelectrified.\n\nRidership\n\nThe Providence/Stoughton line is the busiest in the Commuter Rail system. The route has over 13,000 passenger trips in each direction every weekday. The current travel time for 43-mile route between Providence and South Station can typically take 70 minutes.\n\nLine characteristics\n\nEight stations only have mini-high platforms, which are about two-thirds the length of a typical coach: Hyde Park, Canton Jct, Sharon, Mansfield, Attleboro, South Attleboro, Canton Center, Stoughton. Those stations have to be equipped with full-length high platforms; the other stations already have high platforms.\n\nBetween Boston and Providence, a distance of 43.6 miles, there are ten stops. But the potential time saving is substantial for how wide the stop spacing is, because the current MBTA rolling stock generally has a maximum speed of 79-mph, whereas much of the NEC rail line in Massachusetts and Rhode Island has speed limits of 100-150 mph.\n\nRhode Island is currently investing in an infill stop in Pawtucket. We believe that two more locations for infill stops are warranted: Readville, and Forest Hills. Both have stops on other lines branching off the NEC (Franklin and Needham, respectively), but would be useful on the Providence Line as well: Readville for transfers to the Fairmount Line, and Forest Hills for connections to the Orange Line.\n\nTo transform the Providence/Stoughton line to high speed EMU rail service in the nearterm,\n\nthe MBTA should:\n\nProcure rolling stock,\n\nElectrify the Pawtucket service yard, which was designed for electrification,\n\nBuild high-level platforms at the eight stations with mini-highs,\n\nElectrify short track segments not used by Amtrak:\n\nThe platform tracks at Attleboro, where the line has four tracks,\n\nThe Stoughton line,\n\nThe 11-mile FRIP track from Providence Station to Greenwood, Warwick, and\n\nThe Wickford Jct. siding.\n\nCapital investment along the NEC south of Massachusetts would be the exclusive responsibility of Rhode Island. Within Rhode Island, there are unfunded long-term plans to extend the line even further south than Wickford Jct., into Kingston and Westerly at the border with Connecticut. The state’s rail plans are compatible and complementary with Regional Rail.\n\nMBTA subway and bus, and GATRA, BAT, and RIPTA bus service should have full fare integration with Regional Rail along the Providence/Stoughton lines. RIPTA should expand its current free transfer policy for MBTA pass holders to full fare integration for all Regional Rail fare products; a trip on a Regional Rail train within Rhode Island should cost the same as a RIPTA bus ride.\n\nFor more frequent Providence and Stoughton line service, trains should run equally at all times of day in both directions. Before NSRL opens, trains should use two captive tracks at South Station and shuttle back and forth, turning back within ten minutes to avoid congesting South Station tracks. With implementation of the NSRL there would be no need for extended dwell times at South Station as trains would potentially travel beyond to the north side of the MBTA system.\n\nWith either the current terminal service at South Station or with NSRL through train service, extended train layovers for the Providence and Stoughton line service should be at:\n\nProvidence Station\n\nStoughton\n\nPawtucket service yard\n\nWickford Jct.\n\nWhen NSRL is established, end of the line locations for layovers on the north side should\n\nbe selected.\n\nTrain Scheduling\n\nGenerally, trains should operate between 5 am and 1 am, 7 days a week.\n\nScheduling should be consistent with recurring clockface times.\n\nFrequency should be the same for both inbound and outbound trains.\n\nThe top speed should be 100 mph or more, except where constrained by track geometry. Positive Train Control, which prevents overspeed incidents, is installed and active on the line.\n\nFrequency\n\nThis section analyzes the advantages of potential infrastructure and service improvements\n\nfor the MBTA’s Fairmount Line, proposing upgrades and changes along its corridor.\n\nCurrent situation\n\nThe Fairmount Line runs just over 9 miles from South Station to Readville, primarily through the Dorchester, Mattapan, and Hyde Park neighborhoods of Boston, with seven urban stations open and an eighth under construction at Blue Hill Avenue/Cummins Highway. The Fairmount Line has already had considerable upgrades to its infrastructure, with many bridges replaced and high-level platforms installed at all stations other than Fairmount and Readville.\n\nAt both ends, the line connects to the Providence Line, which is already electrified. Thus, it does not need electrical substations; electrifying the line merely requires stringing wire and connecting it to the Providence Line’s substations. Electrification is a priority, especially given high levels of air pollution in Dorchester from sources like the congested Southeast Expressway in addition to the current Commuter Rail diesel locomotives.\n\nThe southern end of the line is closely parallel to the 28 bus, which runs along Blue Hill Avenue. The 28 is in a near-tie for busiest bus route in Boston; it is crowded at rush hour, despite averaging only 8 mph. Faster trains would connect passengers in Mattapan to Downtown Boston four times as quickly as the 28 bus with a transfer to the Orange Line.\n\nRidership\n\nHistorically, ridership on the Fairmount Line was poor, but it has tripled since 2012, when the MBTA moved most stations into Zone 1A (charging subway fare), added infill stations, improved track/signals, and heavily marketed the line as an alternative in Dorchester.36 An additional experiment with free fares for two weeks in 2017 showed more latent demand, increasing ridership by 25-44%, despite service only every 40 minutes at rush hour and 60 minutes midday.37\n\nLine Characteristics\n\nThe Fairmount Line is unique among MBTA Commuter Rail lines in how urban it is. It connects South Station with 7 other stations, with an eighth station under construction at Blue Hill Avenue. All stations on the line are in the City of Boston, and all except the outermost two, Fairmount and Readville, have full-length high platforms built in the last few years as part of the modernization plan.\n\nBecause the stations are so closely spaced, the Fairmount Line should be the top target for electrification, alongside the already-wired Providence Line. The difference in travel time between EMUs and trains pulled by diesel locomotives, about 60-90 seconds per station, is much more salient on a line with 8 stations in 9 miles than on a line with a station every 3 to 4 miles. Electrification and the use of EMUs will have many benefits for the Fairmount Line, including reducing emissions to zero, but the most important benefit will be the ability to have a high frequency service that truly behaves like a high functioning subway system.\n\nThe line’s urban setting also means that high frequency is imperative. A train every 30 minutes could work in cities and suburbs like Providence or Worcester, where the trip time to Boston is an hour. In Dorchester, higher frequency is nonnegotiable.\n\nEqually important are good subway and bus connections. One ticket should be valid on all trains and buses within Boston and inner core communities (such as Cambridge and Revere), allowing people to transfer from the Fairmount Line to the Red Line at South Station, the 28 bus at Blue Hill Avenue, or the 23 bus at Talbot Avenue without paying an additional fare.\n\nTo transform the Fairmount Line into useful regional rail, called the Indigo Line on some\n\nMBTA plans, the following capital and operations improvements would be required:\n\nFare integration with the buses and subway (leveraging the imminent AFC 2.0),\n\nHigh frequency: a train at least every 15 minutes all day,\n\nElectrification: hooking into the substations at both ends in order to wire the line cheaply,\n\nHigh platforms at Fairmount and Readville to speed boarding as well as permit EMUs without trap doors.\n\nThe terminal at Readville, on a grade-separation over the Northeast Corridor, is singletrack. It is possible to schedule trains every 15 minutes with a single-track terminus: in Vancouver the SkyTrain Canada Line has single-track ends at both of its outer branches, each having a train every 7 minutes at the peak. However, this imposes operational constraints elsewhere on the line, and so it may be desirable to double-track this terminal.\n\nPotential Through-Service\n\nThe Fairmount Line opened together with the Franklin Line as part of the New York and New England Railroad. Today, the Franklin Line goes between Readville and South Station along the route of the Providence Line, which offers a faster trip. However, optionally, the Fairmount Line and the Franklin Line could be reconnected, to offer direct service between communities in Dorchester and Mattapan and retail job centers in Dedham and Norwood.\n\nIf there is through-service, then some additional work is needed. Most of it is on the Franklin Line, but some is on the Fairmount Line: the Readville track would need to be double-tracked. The additional travel demand coming from Dedham and points south is such that peak frequency should be a train every 7.5 minutes. A single-track station at Readville would then be impractical, because it would excessively constrain operations elsewhere on the line.\n\nTravel Times\n\nAt full rollout, with NSRL removing the slow terminal tracks into South Station, a fast schedule is feasible, almost doubling speed from today. Trains would go at 60 mph from South Station to Blue Hill Avenue, and between Blue Hill Avenue and Readville they could even reach 80 mph. This sample schedule assumes no through-service with the Franklin Line."
