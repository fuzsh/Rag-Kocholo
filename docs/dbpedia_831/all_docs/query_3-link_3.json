        "text": "Francis Cabot Lowell (1775—1817) has been credited with launching the Industrial Revolution in the United States. Together with his three brothers-in-law, he established the Boston Manufacturing Company at Waltham MA in 1814. There, they spun cotton and wove cloth using machinery powered by the Charles River. BMC was so successful that it paid shareholders a 27.5% dividend in 1821.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter Lowell’s death, the remaining partners sought new sites where they could expand their business. In 1823 they opened the Merrimack Manufacturing Company on the Merrimack River near East Chelmsford. That community was incorporated as Lowell in 1826.\n\nMerrimack Company circa 1850\n\nTextile mills at Lowell received raw materials via the Middlesex Canal. This was less than satisfactory because it would freeze in the winter. Early passengers between Lowell and Boston relied primarily on stagecoaches.\n\ntextile mills at Lowell circa 1850 ResearchGate.net\n\nPatrick Tracy Jackson, Lowell’s brother-in-law, managed MMC and spearheaded the effort to secure a railroad. The Boston and Lowell Railroad was chartered in 1830. Its charter granted B&L a thirty-year monopoly between its namesake cities, and it did not require B&L to compensate the Middlesex Canal for lost business. This was a far better deal than was given to railroads in upstate New York, which had to reimburse the Erie Canal.\n\nJames Haywood surveyed a right-of-way. His 26-mile route avoided passing through intermediate towns. It featured gentle grades and required only three grade crossings, but spurs had to be added later to serve the towns of Medford, Woburn and Billerica that had been bypassed.\n\nrailroads in eastern Massachusetts circa 1845\n\nTrack consisted of iron fish-belly rail, 35 pounds per yard, supported by cast-iron chairs on stone blocks and stone sleepers, resting on stone foundation walls. The first locomotive was built in England and was named the Stephenson.\n\nThe Boston & Lowell Railroad opened for business on this date in 1835. MMC’s textile mills provided most of its freight revenue. Passenger business increased significantly after riders found that they could board a train at Lowell and be in downtown Boston within 45 minutes. Remarkably, it has been reported that B&L’s passenger trains attained up to 60 mph. Hurtling at that speed over unyielding granite roadbed must have been a bone-jarring experience! When it came time to double-track the railroad in 1838, management wisely decided to replace the granite sills with wooden ties.\n\nB&L passenger depot in Boston, 1835\n\nIn the late 1830s, B&L sold trackage rights to the Boston & Maine Railroad so that its trains could enter Boston. As traffic density increased, this arrangement became less satisfactory to B&M, who began constructing its own route into the city. B&L squeezed as much cash as possible from B&M until the latter’s line was completed. At one point, B&M obtained a court order that forbade B&L from raising its rates.\n\nOnce B&L no longer received rental income, its financial condition deteriorated. Boston & Maine leased it in 1887. The former Boston & Lowell then became part of B&M’s Southern Division.\n\nJoseph Lechner\n\nportions adapted from Summer Saunterings by the B&L (1885)\n\nFrom: toytrains@groups.io [mailto:toytrains@groups.io] On Behalf Of Joseph Lechner\n\nSent: Tuesday, June 27, 2023 5:30 PM\n\nTo: toytrains@groups.io\n\nSubject: [toytrains] June 27 in railroad history: Boston & Lowell Railroad\n\n< During my 6 years in the Boston area... I rode the MBTA Purple line - the very same Fitchburg line shown on the map from 1945. I boarded at South Acton (no station back then, just a parking lot), and enjoyed passing through Walden Pond in Concord on the way to the station at Porter Square where I transferred to the MBTA Red line. I disembarked at Kendall Square (MIT) and walked the rest of the way to work in a rehabbed old factory building. When I first began commuting on Purple line in 1986, I rode in old Budd RDCs stripped of their self-propulsion. One smoky old diesel motor remained in the RDC to provide heat and insufficient light to read - no air conditioning. A singe former B&M EMD geep or F10 (upgraded from F7) locomotive pulled 4 or 5 cars - too few to accommodate all the commuters, so I sometimes had to stand in the vestibule and nearly freeze to death during the excessively long New England winters. This trip took 90 minutes each way, exactly the same as driving by car (no Interstate highway available). Despite the lack of creature comforts, rail was still the best alternative. Anyone who has driven in Boston will understand why even riding on a train from 1845 would be preferable to driving there today. >\n\nThank you, Gary, for your note. Glad that you weren't stuck on the train (like ol' Charlie) for lack of exit fare.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, I attended a four-day conference at MIT. One evening, I drove route 28 to one of the south shore suburbs to visit family. \"Rush hour\" is a misnomer for what happens on Boston highways between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.\n\nTo keep this train related, I did visit the Charles Ro store that week.\n\nJoseph Lechner"
