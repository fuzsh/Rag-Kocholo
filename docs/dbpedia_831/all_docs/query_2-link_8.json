        "text": "____________________________________________\n\nAUTHENTIC PRINTS\n\nWe sell antique prints (the actual artifact!) as well as fine art reproductions of the maps in our collection. Select \"Authentic Print\" from the purchase options to purchase the real deal, an artifact produced years ago. Authentic prints are available when we have them. The website will indicate \"sold out\" if the authentic print is no longer available. Fine art reproductions of every image in our collection are always available.\n\nLead times: Unframed authentic prints are typically ready for shipment or pickup within a few days of order placement. Some authentic prints listed on our website must be brought in from other dealers. In those cases, additional days are required to get those prints to us before shipping or pickup can take place.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nFINE ART PRINTS/REPRODUCTIONS\n\nPrinting: We print in-house to control all aspects of print quality and consistency.\n\nPrinters: We exclusively utilize Epson commercial-grade Ultrachrome printers and pigment inks.\n\nPapers: We print onto Epson Premium and Ultra-premium matte-finish papers engineered for Epson Ultrachrome printers.\n\nPaper Sizes / Prices:\n\nSmall 8 1/2\" x 11\" Paper = $14.95\n\nStudio 11\" x 14\" Paper = $19.95\n\nMedium 13\" x 19\" Paper = $29.95\n\nIntermediate 18\" x 24\" Paper = $49.95\n\nLarge 24\" x 36\" Paper = $69.95\n\nQuality: Our fine art prints are museum-quality, no-fade, color-stable, acid-free, and archival.\n\nLayout: All images are printed as large as possible onto the selected paper size. The original proportions of the image are maintained. No stretching to fill the paper occurs. Given that the proportions of each image rarely matches that of the paper, there is always white space around the image. Images are centered onto the paper as much as possible.\n\nWatermarks: Watermarks will not be printed on reproduction fine art prints. Watermarks are displayed on website images only.\n\nLead times: Unframed prints are typically ready for shipment or pickup within a few days of order placement.\n\nPricing Policy: We reserve the right to change, lower, or increase the price of any item at any time. If we lower a price for an item, such as when we run a sale or put an item on clearance, we do not provide retroactive refunds or credits.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nFRAMING\n\nFabrication: All of our frames are 100% made in Cambridge, Massachusetts USA. We have a longstanding relationship with a local fine art framer who exclusively produces all of our frames.\n\nFraming Types: We offer three types of framing, each with its own styles/colors.\n\nCustom/Archival Framing\n\nEconomy/Non-Archival Framing\n\nStudio/No Matting\n\nMedium/No Matting Framing\n\nWhy choose Custom/Archival framing? We recommend Custom/Archival frames when framing any authentic print. All authentic prints can fade when exposed to direct or indirect sunlight. Custom/Archival frames feature UV-resistant glazing to protect antique images from fading. Custom/Archival frames feature acid-free mat boards and backing boards that will not damage authentic prints. Store bought frames typically do not use UV-resistant glass nor acid-free materials. A Custom/Archival frame is the best way to protect and display an antique print for the ages.\n\nWhy choose Economy/Non-Archival framing? Economy/Non-Archival frames are perfect for our fine art reproductions. Since our reproductions are archival (made with archival inks and acid-free papers), UV-resistant glazing nor acid-free boards are required to protect the reproduction. Economy/Non-Archival frames offer a sensible price point and affordable way to bring a framed image into any space.\n\nFrame Prices: All frame prices listed below do not include the cost of any reproduction print, shipping, or sales tax. See any individual map page on our site to explore calculated total costs for print + frame + sales tax + shipping.\n\nCustom/Archival Small = $125\n\nCustom/Archival Medium = $175\n\nCustom/Archival Intermediate = $225\n\nCustom/Archival Large = $275\n\nEconomy/Non-Archival Small (11\" x 14\") = $60\n\nEconomy/Non-Archival Medium (16\" x 20\") = $80\n\nStudio/No Matting (11\" x 14\") = $50\n\nMedium/No Matting (13\" x 19\") = $60\n\n18\" x 24\" No Matting = $80 (available in store only)\n\nFine Art Reproduction Map + Frame = Total Framed Map Price:\n\nSmall Print ($14.95) + Economy/Non-Archival ($60) = $74.95\n\nSmall Print ($14.95) + Custom/Archival Frame ($125) = $139.95\n\nStudio Print ($19.95) + Studio/No Matting ($50) = $69.95\n\nMedium Print ($29.95) + Medium/No Matting ($60) = $89.95\n\nMedium Print ($29.95) + Economy/Non-Archival ($80) = $109.95\n\nMedium Print ($29.95) + Custom/Archival Frame ($175) = $204.95\n\nInterm. Print ($49.95) + Economy/No Matting* ($80) = $129.95Interm.

As of Jan 1, 2023, we no longer offer shipping of Intermediate and Large Frames. We continue to offer in-store pick up for any frame, regardless of size.\n\nFraming Lead Times:\n\nCustom/Archival Frames are hand-fabricated to order at our outside fine art framer's shop.
