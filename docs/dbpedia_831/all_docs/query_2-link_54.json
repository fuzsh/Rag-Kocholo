On July 4, 1848, 3,000 people traveled the Peabody to Danvers section of the journey and marveled at the innovation.\n\nIn 1850, the South Reading Railroad was built and connected Peabody to Boston via South Reading (now Wakefield). The Georgetown Railroad was built in 1854, with stops in Newburyport, Georgetown, Topsfield, Danvers and West Peabody, continuing onto Boston via South Reading. West Peabody was also included in the Salem & Lowell Railroad, which traveled west to Tewksbury Junction.\n\nBy 1859, the Boston & Maine Railroad, the Boston & Lowell Railroad Corporation and the Eastern Railroad Company all operated lines passing through Peabody.\n\nAs you can imagine, with all these different railroad companies vying for business, each company worked to undercut the other and gain the monopoly of their areas.\n\nIn the end, all train lines through Peabody would be owned and operated by the Boston & Maine Railroad."
