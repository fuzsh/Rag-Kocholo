        "text": "Au Crépuscule (Dusk)\n\nLithuania’s Sharunas Bartas will have his tenth feature ready for presentation in 2020. Au Crépuscule (Dusk) was financed by Film Center Serbia/Serbia’s Biberche Productions, Lithuania’s Studija Kinema and France’s KinoElektron. His Frost (2017) Dp Eitvydas Doskus, who also lensed Bartas’ yet-to-be-released documentary Watermarker (Acqua Alta) featuring Toni Servillo, is on hand for the project, which stars Alina Zaliukaite-Ramanauskiene, Marius Povilas Elijas Martynenko, Arvydas Dapsys and Vita Siauciunaite. Bartas picked up some awards out of the Berlin Forum with his 1991 debut Three Days and competed in Venice with his 2000 title Freedom. Cannes has featured Bartas the most to date, with his 1996 film Few of Us and 1997 film A Casa programmed in Un Certain Regard, while 2017’s Frost, featuring Vanessa Paradis, played Director’s Fortnight.…...\n\nExclusive: Sony Pictures Television has optioned The City In The Middle Of The Night, Charlie Jane Anders’ praised sci-fi novel, for series development, with Sharon Hall’s Mom de Guerre Productions, which is under a first-look deal with Spt.\n\nThe novel, published by Tor Books in February, is set on an inhospitable alien planet. The synopsis: Generations ago, the settlers of the planet January created a civilization on the edge of endless environmental extremes, between frigid pitch black and blinding, scorching brilliance. The city of Xiosphant functions with tyrannical precision, enforcing its citizens to work, eat, and sleep in specific blocks of time mandated “day” and “night.”\n\nSophie was a college student before being exiled from the city on suspicion of treason. Driven into January’s glacial night side to die, she is rescued by the planet’s native inhabitants. Long hated and hunted by humans as animals,...\n\nTV tapings can be a drag. But amid the set changes and staged introductions from host Ed Helms at Saturday night’s all-star tribute to Willie Nelson in Nashville, there were some true moments of musical spontaneity — particularly from the guest of honor.\n\nTitled Willie: Life & Songs of an American Outlaw and produced by Blackbird Presents, the concert, which will air sometime this year on A&E, assembled a powerful cast of guest artists to pay tribute to the 85-year-old. George Strait, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Jimmy Buffett, Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson...\n\nWhen Robert Redford was younger, the matinee-idol handsome actor would make it a point to give the camera his “good side,” and audiences would melt. He’s older now and makes no attempt to hide it, but then, he doesn’t need to. People don’t forget a performer like Redford, whose movie-star charisma idles low and sexy like a Harley Davidson motor even when he’s not doing anything, and that means a movie like David Lowery’s “The Old Man & the Gun” — a dapper, low-key riff on the bank-robber genre — can play things soft, counting on Redford’s charm to fuel the show.\n\nIn what the actor has indicated is likely to be his final film role, Redford plays Forrest Tucker, a certified rascal who, in 1981 at the spry age of 76, was busted for a series of small-time heists. More than 80 stick-ups, all told. Tucker was caught...\n\nActors who can speak Korean, start your new year on a high note with a lead role in a new series. “Three Days,” a new Korean TV series set around a Korean family in Orange County, is currently looking for a female actor, aged 21–35, to play the lead role of a mother of a young child.

With a happy face punctuating her MySpace Celebrity blog, the singer, 40, writes, \"Your overwhelming support has not gone unnoticed. It has been heartwarming to see. It has made me very happy.

Davis, who is up for Emmy honors this year for her role as the idealistic Charlotte in the final season of HBO's Sex, has inked a seven-figure series development deal with the premium cable channel. HBO plans to field pitches from a range of writers for starring vehicles for Davis. The actress is said to be leaning toward a comedy project but is open to other concepts, sources said. Davis, who has spent the past six years on Sex, most recently toplined the TNT telefilm The Winning Season along with Matthew Modine. Her other TV credits include the Fox drama Melrose Place and the telefilms Three Days, Atomic Train and Take Me Home: The John Denver Story. Davis also is set to boost her profile -- and enter the realm of celebrity spokesperson -- through a sponsorship pact that calls for her to become the new face of Maybelline New York cosmetics. Davis is repped by Endeavor, Mosaic Media Group's Dave Fleming and attorney Jason Sloane."
