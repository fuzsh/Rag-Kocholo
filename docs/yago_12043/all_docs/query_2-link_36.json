Writer/Director Antoine de Meaux, producder Program33 (France), co-producer Era Film (Lithuania).\n\nTRAINS (in Production) creative documentary. Writer/Director Maciej Drygas. Producer Vita Å½elakeviÄiÅ«tÄ (Poland), co-producer: Rasa Miškinyte, Era Film (Lithuania).\n\nSynopsis: It is impossible to describe the types of people, the faces of the passengers, the suitcases, the bundles of clothes changing with fashion, the possessions, and the prams. A man at a railway station is somehow different there, differently focused, with a different emotion on his face. Maybe it is a kind of excitement, because along with the journey there is hope for some change, for something new, but maybe it's a feeling of unease - what will await us there. And maybe it is only to concentrate, not to leave anything on the platform, not to forget about anything. Even the couples that are saying farewell are doing so as if they are never going to see each other again. There is a strange intensity of emotions. Or the small children - they are suspiciously polite, overwhelmed by the crowd and the size of the huge iron carriages, they look apprehensive but rarely cry. All these emotions are powerfully conveyed by the archival materials, which leave the lasting impression that even though times, trains and history may change, man with his complex inner world is evolving in a far less noticeable way.\n\nClosed in railway carriages, the history of the world is arranged in a structure based on a repeating refrain. Every few years, in different places around the world, a similar mystery occurs. First, carriages are filled with hundreds of men going to war, then the trains return with the wounded or with coffins. Then begins the gigantic exodus of the civilian population, and also people in uniform. The refugees mingle at stations with prisoners returning from the camps, the uniformed soldiers of the victorious army lead the defeated. Tears of joy are mixed with tears of bitterness. And finally there comes a time when ordinary passengers appear at the stations, although briefly, because this lyric of the station's daily routine is quickly pierced by another refrain.\n\nNEVAIKYSTÄ (DISPLACED CHILDHOOD) (in development) animadoc. Writer/director MiglÄ SatkauskaitÄ, animation director GiedrÄ NarušytÄ Boots. Producer Rasa MiškinytÄ.\n\nLogline “Children are magic because they look for it.” – Christopher Moore\n\nSynopsis\n\nTwo old Lithuanian ladies – REGINA and JURATE – share memories of their turbulent childhood. Their authentic stories catapult us 70 years back into the past where we follow two little girls on their journey between harsh reality and magical daydreams. They both live in Kaunas, but the fate leads them to complete opposite directions one to the East, the other to the West. Archival footage and animated collages of the photos from the family albums reconstruct the bleak reality and the magic of the daydreams. And there is a misfit PIONEER, a fictional hand drawn animated character who questions documented footage and provides it with quirky comments. The Pioneer, through his naivety and frankness, reveals the absurdity of that period and the historical injustice that condemned the children like Regina and Jurate to displaced childhood.\n\nThe structure consists of 3 chapters dedicated to 3 characters. Stories of each character are constructed non-chronologically. The free flow of associations connects the different sequences of events.\n\nREGINA (5 years old girl)\n\nRegina with brother Arvydas (7 years old boy) sing joyfully happy birthday for their mother and crawl with huge bunch of tulips into her bed. Suddenly there is a knock on the door it opens wide with tremendous bang. Soviet soldiers come in to bedroom and command to leave immediately.\n\nThey are together with many other families crammed into the train nr.48006.\n\nRegina and her family find themselves in a cotton plantation in TAJIKISTAN. In far distance they notice the slowly moving camel caravan under the heat of Asian sun.\n\nRegina's mother opens the letter from daddy. Stalin's head, flags and a military orchestra jump out of the letter. Regina's mother pushes them back. Daddy appears in the letter and presses a family photo to his heart, and disappears behind the bars of the hard labour camp.\n\nThe hardships of unbearable heat, malaria, snakes, hard work in cotton plantations and almost dying mother vanish in the magic of thousand- and one-night daydreams about blossoming peach orchard, gin from the magic lamp or flying carpet with peacefully grazing rams…\n\nThe dreams of Regina and Arvydas come true when daddy appears. They embrace in a blossoming peach orchard.\n\nJURATE (7 years old girl)\n\nMum and Dad hide Jurate with her brother RIMAS (9 years old boy) in the depths of the huge garden in the improvised tent. They play the shadow theatre. The sounds of trucks, shouting soldiers, screaming children echoes in the darkness until the gunshot brakes up barking dog.\n\nThere are many families with bundles on the ferry. Leaning overboard, Jurate imagines that the floating logs in the water are crocodiles. She looks up and sees palm trees and exotic animals instead of usual trees.\n\nBrother Rimas pretends to be a cowboy fighting the Indians in the Wild West.\n\nA convoy of thirty-four chariots with refugees are moving slowly West. Suddenly they are surrounded by SS solders. Jurate’s father and other men are brutally separated from their families. Only the women and children continue slowly their way. Jurate wipes away her tears, she hugs her doll stronger.\n\nAnxious and uncertain life on suitcases, camps for displaced persons (DP camps) converts into the fantasies from the adventure books with crocodiles and cowboys in Wild West.\n\nMum with kids ends up in America but without daddy. Only the orange smell and shining Christmas tree memory brings them together in the daydream.\n\nPIONEER\n\nA group of children say the pioneer oath, red scarves are tied around their necks. Pioneer rips off the scarf, but it transforms into a snake and chase the Pioneer. He runs away and hides in a movie theatre. The propaganda film with Stalin and Lenin is on the screen. The Pioneer plays with the light beam and disturbs the show. Lenin gets out of the screen and commands children to collect scrap metal. A group of children collect scrap metal under the supervision of teachers. They carry pieces of metal of all sizes and through them in a pile. Pioneer blows bubbles instead. A pile transforms into a tank.\n\nArchive propaganda footage worships the flourishing childhood of Soviet youth, but the Pioneer shows childish resistance to this brainwashing.\n\nTwo old ladies Regina and Jurate fascinate us with their joy for life and humor. Their journeys were marked by wonderful people they met, never matters where: Lithuania, Germany, Tajikistan, or US. Both succeed to sustain their inner child even in the most rigorous historical circumstances.\n\nPost scriptum\n\nRegina's daddy has chosen to join his deported family in Tajikistan after he was released from an imprisonment in a hard labor camp.\n\nJurates' daddy after many efforts and many years managed to reunite with his family in America.\n\nProduced films:\n\nRUSSIA vs LAWYERS - Creative documentary 101'.
