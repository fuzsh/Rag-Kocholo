        "text": "NEW LITHUANIAN FEATURE FILMS // By Renata Šukaitytė\n\nCinematic Ambitions and Challenges\n\nWith a smaller population than London or New York, and a less robust economy than the Free State of Bavaria, Lithuania is one of the world’s most modest film production countries, supported by relatively minimal public funding (mainly administered by the Lithuanian Film Centre and Cultural Foundation), which accounts for the small number of national feature fiction films released annually varying from 2 (e.g. in 2011) to 21 (e.g. in 2016). Lithuanian production companies are typically boutique in size and focus on producing from 1 to 3 feature film projects at a time. The average budget of a local feature movie is between €500,000 and €2 000,000, which is quite minor in comparison with the budget of an average European film. This is due to the modest subsidies for film and to belonging to a small linguistic market (less than 3 million people live in Lithuania) as well as negligible private funding and support by local broadcasters. Therefore, the Lithuanian audiovisual industry decidedly depends on public funding, co-producing with foreign companies and pan-European film support initiatives, such as the Creative Europe MEDIA programme and the Eurimages Fund.\n\nThese challenges, however, have not precluded Lithuania in its cinematic ambitions to become a vibrant locale for a native film industry and film culture, because, as we all know, filmmaking is so much more than a large population and enormous financial resources. It requires a unique historic and cultural experience, a rich and expressive language and, as Andrew James Horton argues, ‘the essential ingredient of talent’. Actually, the latter in combination with a clear cinematic vision and a high degree of professionalism and the dedication of filmmakers leads to the emergence of high quality films, even when the economy is in a downturn. Some great examples of our filmmakers’ ability to produce marvellous films without adequate funding are the first works of Šarūnas Bartas (Trys Dienos / Three Days, 1991, Koridorius / Corridor, 1995 and Mūsų nedaug / Few of Us, 1996) and Valdas Navasaitis (Kiemas / Courtyard, 1999), which paved the way for younger artists, namely Ignas Miškinis (Diringas / Diring, 2006; Karalių pamaina / Kings’ Shift, 2016), Kristina Buožytė (Kolekcionierė / The Collectress, 2008), Emilis Vėlyvis (Zero, 2006; Zero II, 2010), Justinas Krisiūnas (Emigrantai / Emigrants, 2013) and some others, whose low-budget productions raised significant funds from private sponsorship.\n\nAuteur Voices\n\nIt is worth recalling that Lithuanian cinema rose to international prominence in the early nineties with a new (post-Soviet) cinema, which was visibly marked and defined by art cinema texts. Both the state and the film industry had to be rebuilt after the collapse of the Soviet Union and re-positioned on the world map. It should be noted that Lithuanian film quickly evolved from a marginal to an international phenomenon because of the affinity and interest expressed by prestigious international festivals and the combined efforts of filmmakers-auteurs that started their careers during the Soviet period in Lithuania (including Vytautas Žalakevičius, Algimantas Puipa, Gytis Lukšas, Janina Lapinskaitė and many others) and those who debuted during the period of political and economic transition in the late eighties and early nineties (such as Šarūnas Bartas, Valdas Navasaitis and Audrius Juzėnas).\n\nIn the 1990s, the films of Šarūnas Bartas (Three Days, Corridor, Few of Us) and Valdas Navasaitis (Courtyard) became a symbol of Lithuanian cinematic auteurism, which has been synonymous with the extremes of the art cinema style (long takes, fragmentary narrative, minimal acting and the use of desolate and vanishing locations as central points of reference in their thematic preoccupations) and the rejection of many of the tenets of mainstream filmmaking (a clear plot, action-based narrative, emphatic characters, etc.). They both began working in documentary film before moving to ascetic stylized features, which explains their preferences for a realistic approach and an interest in a phenomenological exploration of time. Their early works, as well as more recent films, (Freedom (2000), Seven Invisible Men (2005), Eastern Drift (2010), Ramybė mūsų sapnuose / Peace to Us in Our Dreams (2015), Šerkšnas / Frost (2017)) by Bartas and Perpetuum Mobile (2008) by Valdas Navasaitis), which already feature certain elements of genre film (i.e. criminal drama, road movie, war movie) are instantly recognizable for their long takes and fluid, sometimes sinuous camera movement, their picturesque mise-en-scène and ambient sound design; contrasting urban and countryside settings; de-dramatized narrative structure, and slow camera movements attuned to the traumatic experiences of a disaffected, alienated, insular and existentially damaged protagonist confronting the new reality (the transition from the Soviet system to the capitalist one) and coming to terms with traumatic memories of the Soviet past, which often feels like a slowly emerging apocalypse.\n\nThe most distinctive authorial works by young filmmakers undoubtedly are Kristina Buožytė’s sci-fi melodrama Aurora / Vanishing Waves (2012), Ignas Jonynas’s thriller Lošėjas / Gambler (2013), Alantė Kavaitė’s drama Sangailės vasara / The Summer of Sangailė (2015), and Andrius Blaževičius’s drama The Saint / Šventasis (2016). All these movies introduced new subjects for Lithuanian audiences, such as the milieu of international neuroscientists and professional ethics (Vanishing Waves), everyday dramas of Lithuanian paramedics (Gambler), the mutual affection, dreams and goals of young girls (The Summer of Sangailė), and the effects of the global economic crisis on the life of a Lithuanian provincial family (The Saint). All these movies explore the consequences of moral choices that face the protagonists, but do not model any ‘new waves’ or ‘stylistic trends’ in Lithuanian film because of aesthetic and generic difference.\n\nReflecting the Past\n\nThe Soviet period features prominently in historical Lithuanian cinema because the directors lived during this time and retain fresh memories of it. And so, historic films gained prominence in the national cinema through a very personalized cinematic form, which was used as a vehicle for expressing major concerns about the situation through which they lived and in which they were living. Gytis Lukšas is perhaps the best director (next to Bartas) to discuss, because his works are among the most interesting and exhaustive that address the recent Lithuanian past. Lukšas’s Duburys / Vortex (2009), based on the novel by Romualdas Granauskas, is yet another apocalyptic presentation of Soviet Lithuania, which reveals the gradual degradation of the Soviet people, both the colonized (the Lithuanians) and the colonizers (the Russians), as forced de-teritorialization and re-teritorialization makes citizens feel rootless and alienated even in their own country or town. The film is composed of stylish black and white images, uses mainly long takes to reveal the emptiness and stagnation of the place in which the central protagonist resides and intermingles. However, the director leaves the viewer (and post-Soviet Lithuania) with hope because at the end of the film the main protagonist surfaces from the vortex after trying to drown himself. Other filmmakers, such as Jonas Vaitkus (Vienui vieni / Utterly Alone, 2004), Kristijonas Vildžiūnas (Kai apkabinsiu tave / Back to Your Arms, 2010), Audrius Juzėnas (Ekskursantė / Excursionist, 2013) and Donatas Ulvydas (Emilija iš Laisvės alėjos / Emilia, 2017), are more explicit in dealing with historical issues in their films (than, for example, Bartas or Lukšas), and focus on personal rather than collective dramas in their highly visual and emotional cinematic dramas.\n\nLiterary Inspirations\n\nNational literature is yet another important source of inspiration for local filmmakers. Adaptations of books by famous Lithuanian writers are among the most popular film genres among filmmakers, which have been brought to the big screen by filmmakers such as directed by Janina Lapinskaitė Stiklo šalis / A Land of Glass(2004) based on a story by writer Vanda Juknaitė, Dievų miškas / Forest of the Gods(2005), based on the novel by Balys Sruoga, Lukšas’s Vortex (2009) based on the novel by Romualdas Granauskas, Nuodėmės užkalbėjimas / The Whisper of Sin (2007) and Miegančių drugelių tvirtovė / Fortress of the Sleeping Butterflies (2012) both of which were based on the literary work of Jurga Ivanauskaitė and directed by Algimantas Puipa. Puipa’s newest feature, Edeno sodas / Garden of Eden (2015), is inspired by Janina Survilaitė’s novels. This film genre is most admired by local audiences and the statistics prove this. For example, in 2005 the feature film Forest of the Gods climbed to the top of the domestic box office (€186,523) and was viewed by approximately 650,000 cinema goers while the adaptation of Rimantas Šavelis’s novel Tadas Blinda. Pradžia / Tadas Blinda: The Legend is Born (2011) directed by young filmmaker Donatas Ulvydas broke all the records for attendance in Lithuania in 2011, surpassing even the American blockbuster Avatar with box office of over one million Euros.\n\nGeneric Games\n\nContemporary Lithuanian cinema, produced by younger filmmakers, has become increasingly preoccupied with interrogating, adapting, and absorbing generic templates, which are borrowed from the cinematic models of Hollywood and Western popular cinema. However, these films not only incorporate certain genre conventions, but also art cinema in general. The appeal of this generic formula to young generation of filmmakers is evident – genre films tend to be well-suited for dealing with current issues of modern life (migration, alienation, new forms of sexuality, cultural diversity, the emancipation of women, expansion of the black market, etc.) in Lithuania, to be cool to appeal to a young audience, and have the potential to cross over the national border. The economic development of Lithuania and the triumph of a capitalist modernity with all its advantages and disadvantages and new heroes (all kinds of dealers, a new creative class, gamblers, businesswoman, pop-stars, ambitious young people, etc.) suddenly occupied Lithuanian screen. Very evident in the films of the 2000s, the city and the urbanness in general has finally assumed cultural and ideological dominance. Several films, such as the drama Nuomos sutartis / The Lease (2002) and Senekos diena / Seneca’s Day (2016) by Kristijonas Vildžiūnas, the films Diring (2006) and Artimos šviesos / The Low Lights (2009) directed by Ignas Miškinis, the black comedies Zero (2006), Zero II (2010), Redirected / Už Lietuvą! (2014), and the political satire Zero III (2017), all directed by Emilis Vėlyvis, Valdas Navasaitis’s criminal drama Perpetuum Mobile (2008), the psychological drama Collectress (2008), the directorial debuts (dramas) by the young filmmakers Saulius Drunga (a film for young audiences Anarchija Žirmūnuose / Anarchy in Zirmunai, 2010), Dovilė Gasiūnaitė (Narcizas / Narcissus, 2012), and Lina Lužytė (Amžinai kartu / Together for Ever, 2016) are marked with an attempt to visualize the city as Vilnius (and the city in general) and its citizens had been a ‘missing discourse’ in Lithuanian literary and visual culture for a while. Interestingly, other Lithuanian cities also gradually became popular locations for cinematic stories, namely Klaipėda in the case of Gambler, Elektrėnai in the film The Summer of Sangailė and Kaunas in Emilia. It should be noted that the city in these films is a city of the imagination that film directors (and the city dwellers) inhabit and which inhabits them.\n\nTransnational Gestures\n\nDue to the generic, stylistic and thematic diversity and dynamism of transnational collaborative practices of the local cinema, it is becoming more international and successfully attracts international funding, promoters and an audience. International collaboration is growing more important in order to produce feature features with a higher production value and easier access to international markets. Among the most successful recent international co-productions are Frost, coproduced by Studio Kinema (Lithuanian), Kino Elektron (France), Reborn Production (France), KNM (Switzerland), Donten & Lacroix Films (Poland), and Insight Media/Tato Film (Ukraine); Redirected coproduced by Wellington Films Ltd (United Kingdom), Kino kultas (Lithuania); Back to Your Arms, jointly made by Studio Uljana Kim (Lithuania), Studio TOR (Poland), and Studio Pola Pandora Film (Germany); Eastern Driftcoproduced by Kino Bez Granits (Russia), Lazennec Films (France), Studio Kinema (Lithuania); and Vanishing Waves, jointly made by Temora (Lithuania) and Acajou Films (France). The internationalization of the Lithuanian film industry made the films more successful in crossing national borders, and courting prestigious international film festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival (The Summer of Sangailėin 2015), the Cannes International Film Festival (Seven Invisible Men in 2005, You Am Iin 2006, Peace for Us in Our Dreams in 2015), the Berlin Film Festival (Eastern Drift, 2010), the Busan International Film festival (The Saint in 2016), the San Sebastián International Film Festival (The Gambler in 2013); the Montreal World Film Festival (The Loss in 2008, Vortex in 2009, ), the International Film Festival Rotterdam (You am I in 2007, Perpetuum Mobile in 2008), the Cairo International Film Festival, (Perpetuum Mobile in 2008, the Loss in 2008), the Shanghai International Film Festival (The Loss, 2008), the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (A Land of Glass in 2005, TheCollectress in 2009, The Low Lights in 2009, Vanishing Waves, in 2012), the Edinburgh International Film Festival (The Vortex, 2009), the Palm Springs International Film Festival (The Vortex in 2009, The Loss in 2009), and the Tallinn Black Nights Film festival (Eastern Drift, 2010, Back to Your Arms, 2010), among many others.\n\nIn conclusion, from the nineties until now Lithuanian filmmakers continue to tread a cinematic path between, on the one hand, extreme auteurist films like the Bartian Freedom, Seven Invisible Men or Frost which have gained international visibility, and on the other hand, so-called ‘audience’ film by producing best-selling literary adaptations like Fortress of the Sleeping Butterflies, historic melodramas like Emilia or Tadas Blinda, The Legend is Born or black comedies such as Zero II or Redirected, with a strong presence in the box-office.\n\nSHORT FILMS // By Auksė Kancerevičiūtė\n\nThe growing popularity of Lithuanian short films is evident in the attention they have received from local audiences, as well as in the accolades they have won at international film festivals. They are usually the work of amateur directors or students, and are known for their unusual style, exploration of different forms, and attempts to express the auteur’s intentions. A young and ambitious generation of filmmakers who employ clearly defined principles in their work examine themes connected to the realities of life in their country, they reflect on the recent past and speak boldly about events in current society.\n\nOne of the most interesting films is Jau puiku tik dar šiek tiek / It would Be Splendid, Yet…(2009) directed by Lina Lužytė, which won prizes at festivals in Germany, Monaco, Poland and Azerbaijan. The succinct narrative encompasses an abundance in its meaningful nuances by describing the attempts of ordinary people to adapt to the new economic and political circumstances. Through the use of accurate details and subtle irony, the early years of Lithuanian’s independence are reconstructed. Meanwhile, a question arises: how do you, having recently emerged from a repressive regime, find your identity in freedom?\n\nEchoes of the Soviet period in contemporary society, the spread of pop culture, relationships plagued by envy: these are all issues that interest the new generation of directors. For example, Andrius Blaževičius in his graduation film Bergenas / Bergen(2009) and his second film Dešimt priežasčių / Ten Reasons (2011) contrasts people of different generations and experience, and examines the influence of mobile technology and television shows.\n\nChildhood memories are often a source of inspiration for the acclaimed director Giedrė Beinoriūtė. She has made a number of documentary and short feature films, such as Mama, tėtis, brolis, sesė / Mummy, Daddy, Brother, Sister (1999) and Egzistencija / Existence (2004), that intermingle gravity and irony in an environment that is full of paradoxes.\n\nThe well-known playwright and director Marius Ivaškevičius chooses the father as the central figure for his films Mano tėvas / My Father (2007) and Tėve mūsų / Our Father (2010). The strength of his films is in the dramatic composition and the psychological portraits of the characters. Our Father, which is based on a true story of a daughter who was imprisoned and abused by her father, received the Young Jury Award at the Tous Courts d’Aix-en-Provence International Cinema Film Festival, as well as the prize for Best Short Film at the 2011 Kinoshok Film Festival in Russia.\n\nMarat Sargsyan, an Armenian director explores a homeland that no longer exists in his short film Lernavan (2009). At the crux of this film are a father and son who are searching for the father’s birthplace, Lernavan. However, this place doesn’t exist and no one has ever heard of it. At the 2009 Vilnius Film Shorts Festival, the film was recognized as the best feature film. Lernavan was awarded the Press and Bronze Egg prizes at the Kustendorf Film and Music Festival in Serbia, and at the 10th Annual International Film Festival 2ANNAS in Latvia it won the Jury Prize and also two awards at the Golden Apricot Yerevan International Film Festival. Ieva Veiverytė analyses the complex relationships of the family as the smallest social unit in her feature film Šuns dienos / Dog’s Life (2013) which does not shy away from the complicated and fragile everyday moments in the life of a woman and her daughter.\n\nIn recent decades, new intonations and a widening array of genres have gradually appeared in short films. Jūratė Samulionytė’s experimental work Nerutina / No Routine (2008) stands out with its rebellious attitude and the distinctive techniques used. The individually photographed frames and stop-motion animation are combined to convey the story of a middle-aged office worker called Henrikas. The objects around him try to help him break free. The films Aš tave žinau / I Know You(2009) and Nesiseka šiandien / Not Lucky Today (2010) and 8 minutės / 8 minutes (2016) by Dovilė Šarutytė are marked by their more complex plots and elaborate filming techniques, as well as by their hints of documentary reality.\n\nAustėja Urbaitė’s short films – Etiudas / The Etude (2013), which is an adaptation of a short story by Jonas Mekas and Tiltai / The Bridges (2015) – transfer everyday existence to a more philosophical plane. In finding beauty in small everyday details, the main characters in The Etude try to fend off a fear of dying and to understand that death is a remembrance of someone’s life. The films were awarded the Special Jury Prize at the Scanorama European Film Forum. And The Bridges, which is the story of an attempt to find bridges between people and learning to live in the here and now, was recognized as the best Baltic short film at Scanorama. Karolis Kaupinis’s 2014 debut short film Triukšmadarys / The Noisemaker is not only one of the most successful and widely shown Lithuanian short films. The film explores the problems of our country and our society: stagnation, insularity, fear of change, bureaucratic mechanisms, and also considers wider themes of danger and waiting for the end. The Noisemaker was awarded the Silver Crane as the best short feature film and recognized as the best Baltic short feature film at the 19th Annual Riga International Film Festival 2ANNAS.\n\nJonas Mekas is a pioneer of the diary film, a poet, film critic, curator and philosopher. He was born in 1922 to a family of farmers in Semeniškiai, Biržai region. With World War II in progress and with the Soviet army approaching the borders of Lithuania in 1944 Mekas and his brother Adolfas were forced to flee Lithuania. After the end of the war, Mekas studied philosophy at the University of Mainz from 1946-1948, and in late 1949, both Jonas and Adolfas emigrated to the United States, settling in New York. As soon as he arrived, Mekas borrowed some money and bought his first 16mm Bolex film camera and in 1950 began shooting his own films. In 1954, Mekas and his brother (Adolfas later became a film studies professor) published the first issues of Film Culture, which for a long time was the most important promoter of avant-garde and classic film in the United States. In 1958, Mekas was invited to write for the Village Voice’s ‘Movie Journal’ column. And four years later, Mekas founded the Film-Makers’ Cinematheque, which later became the Anthology Film Archives. The main goal was to provide a space and opportunity to preserve the legacy of avant-garde film – not only films, but also books and documents. The Archive exists to this day and is one of the largest and most important screening venues and archival institutions for avant-garde film. Even though Mekas filmed individual episodes in his everyday life throughout the 1950s, the film Guns of the Trees (1962) is considered his cinematographic debut. Mekas described this film as ‘a letter written by a mad heart in a mad world’. The New York Living Theatre’s filmed performance of The Brig(1964) was awarded the Grand Prize (Documentary) at the Venice Film Festival. By capturing moments from life that at first glance may seem mundane, by working without actors, a film crew or a script, Mekas became known as a creator of the diary film. A few of his most significant films include: Walden (1969), Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania (1972), Lost Lost Lost (1976), Scenes from the Life of Andy Warhol(1965–1982), Zefiro Torna or Scenes from the Life of George Maciunas (1992), and Happy Birthday to John (1996). These films not only capture an authentic reality, but also embody the spirit of the time by poetically revealing with empirical images a nostalgia for details of life in Lithuania or New York. Mekas chronologically recreates Lithuania’s independence movement and explores themes of freedom and resistance in his film Lithuania and the Collapse of the USSR (2008), which he made as a montage from various television news clips. Sleepless Nights Stories (2011) which captures every single day of the year is a meditation on love, memory, friendship and solitude. Mekas’s films have been shown at numerous international film festivals and in art galleries throughout the world, including the Centre Pompidou (Paris), Moderna Museet (Stockholm), the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Venice Biennale and others. Mekas and his films have also received numerous awards including: the San Francisco International Film Festival’s Mel Novikoff Award; Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Ministry of Culture, France; the Lithuanian National Culture and Art Award; Special Tribute, New York Film Critics Circle Award;, the International Documentary Film Association Award, Los Angeles; Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Ministry of Culture, France; Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Ministry of Culture, France; the Lithuanian National Prize – The Order of the Grand Cross for Merits to Lithuania."
