        "text": "PREMIERE | Contemporary Creators – Paweł Mykietyn\n\nThe fourth film in the Contemporary Creators series is an honest in-depth conversation with Paweł Mykietyn, in which the composer confronts some difficult questions about the role of the artist today.\n\nFor example,\n\nhow can one justify a need to create new works in the age of massive overproduction?\n\nDoes direct contact with art still have as strong an impact as it once had? To what extent does one have to remain uncompromising, when is it better to trust the opinion of others, like fellow artists, audiences and critics? In the professional life of an artist, does experience go hand in hand with a sense of fulfillment and self-confidence?\n\nPREMIERE: 22/01/22 @ 20:00 CET | YouTube\n\nA film by: Arth Pixels\n\nDuration: 40’\n\nPaweł Mykietyn has been a recent guest at the Szczecin Philharmonic to premiere his new piece, composed especially for the MUSIC.
