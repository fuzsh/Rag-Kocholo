        "text": "About the author\n\nMindaugas Survila, the director and cinematographer of \"The Ancient Woods\" had a dream to create this movie since he was in a fifth grade. A long journey was waiting for him towards this dream. Initially he took pictures of nature. While in school, Mindaugas participated in various Young Scientists Conferences in Lithuania and once - in Bergen, where he introduced his scientific observations of nature by a number of photos.\n\nLater, Mindaugas joined Vilnius University, where he was granted a Bachelorâs degree in biology. At the end of his graduate studies of Ecology and Environmental Management Mindaugas finished his first movie Meeting the Ospreys\" (âSusitikimas su Å½uvininkaisâ), which was awarded with a national Petras AbukeviÄius name prize for the best Lithuanian film about nature.\n\nSeeking to get more knowledge about filmmaking Mindaugas worked as a cameraman assistant, still photographer, second cameraman, extras casting in various films of famous Lithuanian and international filmmakers (Sergey Loznitsa, Å arÅ«nas Bartas, Audrius Stonys, etc.).\n\nAt the same time he began making his second film, the docu-poem called \"The Field of Magic\" (\"StebuklÅ³ laukas\"). For him this film was the cinematographic school because he was able to acquire the experience from the team of some of the best cinema professionals in Lithuania working with him (a montage director, a sound director, an operator, a colourist, etc.).\n\nThe latter movie attracted not only a huge number of audiences to the Lithuanian cinema theatres, but also began to travel around the prestigious documentary film festivals.\n\nMindaugas has been purposefully preparing for making âThe Ancient Woodsâ for 18 years. He felt that it was going to be particularly difficult to create. However, Mindaugas Survila believed that with his experience and the help of a reliable team anything is possible. He hoped that âThe Ancient Woodsâ would not only attract a large number of people to the cinema theatres, but would also stimulate discussions on the theme of real values in life.\n\nScreenings and Awards\n\nâThe Ancient Woodsâ began its âjourneyâ in November 2017 with Worldâs premiere in one of worldâs biggest and most prestigious International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) as a part of First Appearance competition.\n\nMindaugas Survila and the editor Danielius Kokanauskis with Andrea van Pol.\n\nStarting with this biggest documentary fest, âThe Ancient Woodsâ visited many other international film festivals. One of the greatest and most memorable experience was the screening of \"The Ancient Woods\" in Sydney film festival where 900 people gathered in one cinema hall to see the film.\n\nNational premiere took place on the 29th March as a closing movie for prestigious international Vilnius Film Festival. Starting from March 30th, the movie began its local âjourneyâ and was shown by largest cinemas in Lithuania. It already broke a record for being the most visited documentary in Lithuanian history, gathering more than 52 thousand people and still remaining at top 20 after 4 months of screening.\n\n\"The Ancient Woods\" have already received several National and International awards for best documentary, best sound and cinematography.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nNew project\n\nWe made a film so we could tell people about most valuable Lithuanian forests. About the fact that we still have them and that we can still save them. Actually, before we started to edit \"The Ancient woods\" we hoped that this film would be seen by at least 3 000 people and that the attention to ancient woods would be brought to this small part of the society.\n\nAfter we just began to edit \"The Ancient Woods\" together with a film producer GintÄ Å½ulytÄ we realized that we will still have what to tell and share about ancient woods even after the film is done. We hoped and still hope to reach out for these young people who are going to make decisions of national level in their near future. So those two years ago we realized that our next project will be an \"Interactive platform\" called by the same name - \"The Ancient Woods\".\n\nWhat is the difference between an Interactive platform and a Film?\n\nUsually film has a linear narative form, e.g. a viewer just watch what is shown on a screen in a cincema theater. While on the interactive platform everyone can chose their own individual \"path\": to sit together with European badgers in a den, to swim under the water amongst sank trees, to climb to a nest of a great eagle-owl or to gain some valuable knowledge about plants from forest herbalists. A viewer will also have an opportunity to chose a way of traveling: to follow a sound or a view, to take a teacher or a scientist to the trip, and etc."
