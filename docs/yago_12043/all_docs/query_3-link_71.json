        "text": "PODCAST | Angelo Acerbi interviews Sharunas Bartas, director of the film Frost.\n\nThe trip of a young couple with a humanitarian help van from Lithuania to Ukraine turns out to be more intense and dangerous than imagined.\n\nSharunas Bartas, a regular at the Cannes Festival, talks with Angelo Acerbi about his ffth entry in Cannes since 1996. Frost is a film on war, and the perception and the reasons for it, that after a while become confused and blurred also for those who are fighting in it. When neighbours and brothers become suddenly enemies something breaks and as Sharunas says “it can not come back”.\n\nFrost: Rokas and Inga, a couple of young Lithuanians, volunteer to drive a cargo van of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. When plans change and they find themselves left to their own devices, they cross the vast snowy lands of the Donbass region in search of allies and shelter, drifting into the lives of those affected by the war. They approach the frontline in spite of the danger, all the while growing closer to each other as they begin to understand life during wartime."
