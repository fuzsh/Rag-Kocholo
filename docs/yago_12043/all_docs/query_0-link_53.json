        "text": "68th Cannes festival will be held on the May 13th–24th. And the parallel program „Quinzaine des Realisateurs“ will take place on May 14th–24th.\n\nToday, art director Edoard Waintrop of „Quinzaine des Realisateurs“ announced that one of the 24 films in the program will be Šarūnas Bartas film. It will be the only Lithuanian film in the Cannes film festival.\n\nThe newest Š. Bartas film will be released in Lithuania on the 9th of October 2015.\n\n„Peace to Us in Our Dreams“– is a story about a man who comes to a village for a weekend with his teenage daughter and a girlfriend. The relationship between the man and his young friend is complicated. A 16 year old daughter has a hard time dealing with the adults‘ relationship crisis, she feels lonely and estranged. She lives in her fantasy world. Since her childhood she has been a friend with a boy from the village while spending her days in a summer house. One day a boy steals a hunting rifle with a telescoping sight from the local hunters. From that day the troubles and drama begin in the village.\n\nIt is not the first time Š. Bartas film is shown in the Cannes festival. In 1996 the film „Few of Us“ participated in the official program „Un Certain Regard“ together with a French actor Katerina Golubeva, a mother of Ina Marija Bartaitė. In the following year the program „Un Certain Regard“ invited his drama „The House“.\n\n„Peace to Us in Our Dreams“ is a second artwork of Š. Bartas that was recognised by the program „Quinzaine des Realisateurs“. Exactly 10 years ago in the theater of „Theatre Croisette“ Lithuanian director presented his film „Seven Invisible Men“."
