        "text": "Few of Us makes a peaceful break, either during a hectic film festival, or in the stress of daily life. This is a chance to relax and calm down for 105 minutes of being in a world which is still earthy, without having to endure the stresses and strains of actually getting there. We become one with a settlement which looks half-abandoned, to which, should the tranquillity be disrupted by a loud, armoured vehicle, a man riding around and an ambitious woman, peace will return, as surely as the snow in winter.\n\nThe people are obedient to the mood. Silently we watch their apparently aimless expeditions with their eyes into their environment, until they become fragments of a window frame, through which they stare motionless into the distance.\n\nSharunas Bartas is not as concerned with breathtaking landscapes of the kind we are used to in other films of this type. When the Siberian world presents its best side, this happens arbitrarily. The trees can look just as good dead, the hills muddy, the people smoking and violent: one or two fights ensue, seemingly baseless and unintentional, yet still fatal. Without causing any sensation, blood flows only in trickles. Then peace descends once more, as it always has done, and always will."
