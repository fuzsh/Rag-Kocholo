        "text": "KORIDORIUS / THE CORRIDOR\n\nREGIE / DIRECTOR: SARUNAS BARTAS\n\nLITHUANIA, GERMANY 1995\n\n80 MIN / 35MM, B&W, NO DIALOGUE\n\nThe space of the film is the country, the city and a human soul that, having acquired the form of reminiscences, preserves the glance of the mother’s eyes, the father’s touch and an encounter with evil that has no reason. The atmosphere of the present is eternal, as eternal as the vanity in our daily journey along the corridor. We open numbers of doors, hoping to meet the look of someone’s bright eyes.\n\nAlpha: 07.04. / 6.00 pm\n\nLaisve / Freedom\n\nDIRECTOR: SARUNAS BARTAS\n\nLITHUANIA, FRANCE, PORTUGAL 2001\n\n96 MIN / 35MM, COLOR, NO DIALOGUE\n\n“Like everyone taking up illegal business they didn’t expect to get caught. Unfortunately, the coast patrol crew did not distiguish between refugees, drug dealers or simple passengers. All of them found themselves under fire. Only a few of them escaped. Searched by the police, they remain on the coast without food and money and with little chance to survive.” S.B.\n\nCaligari: 08.04. / 4.00 pm\n\nNAMAI / THE HOUSE\n\nDIRECTOR: SARUNAS BARTAS\n\nLITHUANIA, PORTUGAL 1997\n\n120 MIN / 35MM, COLOR, NO DIALOGUE\n\n“This is my house. I cannot tell exactly where it is, in which place of the world. I just know that this house is mine. A lot of people have been living in my house. Some just entered and left it, some have been staying longer. A few of them still live there. Sometimes it is very cold in my house. I would really like to know how many people are here. But that is difficult – they often wander about from one room into another. Sometimes, they just leave for a short while, too. Sometimes, we all eat. But never together. Often, people change the room they occupy. Too often, in my view. I cannot count them. But there is still time enough to find out who lives here.” S.B.\n\nAlpha: 06.04. / 8.00 pm\n\nPRAEJUSIOS DIENOS ATMINIMUJ / IN MEMORY OF A DAY GONE BY\n\nDIRECTOR: SARUNAS BARTAS\n\nUSSR (LITHUANIAN SSR) 1990\n\n40 MIN / 35MM, S/W, NO DIALOGUE\n\n“I have been long ago attracted by the city. Sometimes it seems that it is nature’s creation; that some invisible force has gathered lots of people into one huge living creature. Sometimes it seems that man wants to unite with this creature against his own will, melting in its blood, adding the tiny rustle of his existence into its entire buzz that blazes up in the daytime and calms down at night. Nowhere does man feel so lonely as he does in the city. And nowhere does he dive into such reckless rejoicing.” S.B.\n\nAlpha: 11.04. / 8.00 pm\n\nTRYS DIENOS / THREE DAYS\n\nDIRECTOR: SARUNAS BARTAS\n\nLITHUANIA 1991\n\n76 MIN / 35MM, COLOR, OV W. ENGL. ST\n\nThe city is in constant motion, refuses to function according to rational rules. Structures emerge wherever the eye turns: ramified lanes, entrances, exits. Two young men are willingly absorbed into the decaying cityscape of Kalingrad, where for three days they drift on the fringes of a society with no place for observers. Empty quays, dark basements, shadowy figures and powerful machines fuse into an organic wall of image and sound in which they become entrapped. The price they pay is the loss of innocence and lightness of spirit – one by love, the other by violence. At the end they flee back to the wilderness they came from, the existence of the overwhelming creature a distant dream.\n\nAlpha: 11.04. / 8.00 pm\n\nSEPTINI NEMATOMI ZMONES / SEVEN INVISIBLE MEN\n\nDIRECTOR: SARUNAS BARTAS\n\nLITHUANIA, FRANCE, PORTUGAL 2005\n\n116 MIN / 35MM, COLOR, RUSS. OV W. ENGL. ST\n\n“The characters of the film are persons hostile to society, each on his own grounds. That’s why they are travelling: someone is trying to escape the law, another one wants to escape his own self. Their desperate travel leads them to an inescapable conflict with the world, which cannot be changed or rebuilt according to their own understanding. The string of the commonplace human fate is pulled up already, and it’s hardly possible to cut it off.“ S.B.\n\nAlpha: 09.04. / 8.00 pm"
