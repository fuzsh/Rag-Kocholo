Made during the preparation of his films without being connected to them, Bartas' photographs display a similar attraction to landscapes and their matter, to the raw traces of humanity they contain, to melancholic ruins, to warm faces.\n\nWhile his filmography consists mostly of fiction, his photography grasp all the documentary sensitivity that is also at work in his cinema, like its almost shamanic relationship with nature and beings, balanced between pragmatism and poetry. Three unpublished poems of Bartas accompany his photographs.\"\n\nThree poems by Sharunas Bartas, translated to French and English from Lithuanian and Russian.\n\nText by Sonia Voss in French and English.\n\n72 pages - Softcover with French flaps\n\nFiligranes, 2016\n\nFormat 17 x 20 cm\n\nNew - Mint condition"
