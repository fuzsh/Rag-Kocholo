        "text": "27/04/2017 - The Lithuanian director will be making yet another appearance at Cannes with a contemporary political drama that boasts an international cast\n\nRenowned Lithuanian auteur Šarūnas Bartas is putting the finishing touches to his latest film, Frost , in order for it to be ready to be shown as part of the Directors’ Fortnight line-up at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.\n\nRokas, a young Lithuanian man, is part of a convoy transporting humanitarian aid from Lithuania to Ukraine. He meets two journalists, a man and a woman, and they continue the journey together. The trio will be forced to overcome their psychological limits and build a strong relationship, their only solid ground in the midst of the turmoil of war. Each one of them has his or her own very different reasons for being there.\n\nThe film has an international cast. In addition to Lithuanian actors Mantas Jančiauskas and Lyja Maknavičiūtė, Frost features established Polish actor Andrzej Chyra, and Vanessa Paradis in the role of a French journalist.\n\nFrost is already Bartas’ fifth time appearing in the Cannes programme. He has had two films in Un Certain Regard (Few of Us in 1996 and The House in 1997) and two more recent ones in the Directors’ Fortnight (Seven Invisible Men in 2005 and Peace to Us in Our Dreams in 2015)."
