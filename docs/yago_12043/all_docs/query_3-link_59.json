        "text": "The Fourth Annual New York Baltic Film Festival (NYBFF) presented by Scandinavia House: The Nordic Center in America returns in 2021 as a hybrid festival with both in-person and virtual screenings on November 3-14! From November 3 through 7, in-person screenings and events will take place at Scandinavia House in New York, presented in accordance with new COVID-19 safety guidance and protocols. Following the success of last year’s festival, the online version will once again be available to viewers all across the U.S. via the Elevent streaming platform November 3-14.\n\nOn November 6, see Issac (Izaokas, dir. Jurgis Matulevičius, Lithuania, 2019, Narrative). In 1941, Andrius kills his Jewish neighbor, Isaac, during the Lietukis garage massacre. Twenty-five years later, film director Gediminas returns to Soviet Lithuania from the U.S. with a screenplay that portrays the same massacre in detail and gradually attracts the interest of the KGB. Why would someone return from the U.S.? Why is the screenplay so accurate? Isaac shows how the aftermath of the murder ripples through the decades, affecting lives and love long after the war has ended. Director Jurgis Matulevičius captures the fine balance between memory and history, and between guilt and compliance, against the background of 1960s Lithuania.\n\n“A visually dazzling, Kafkaesque murder mystery” –Stephen Dalton, Hollywood Reporter\n\nTickets to this event must be purchased in advance online at the link above; film screenings will take place in Victor Borge Hall.
