        "text": "In this paper, the issue of boredom in slow film - a recent trend in art-cinema that increasingly has gotten critical and scholarly attention – is conceptualised as a paradoxical form of negative affect that can be a possible source of gratification for the viewer. In it, the leading question is thus what are the possible gratifications derived from elicited affects for viewers of the slow film genre? It adds to the debate on the topic by providing an emphasis on the spectatorial, affective engagement of the viewer, a research area that is previously overlooked in the debate that has so far mostly comprised of issues of aesthetics, culture criticism and film history. The paper proposes that boredom can be a source of gratification for some viewers, when it can give rise to contemplation and self-reflexivity and/or meta-emotions such as aesthetic pleasure (A-emotion), moral self-appraisal and identity building. The paper advances towards these conclusions by taking implications from (neo)formalist film studies and genre theory as well as the adjacent fields of psychology and phenomenology – more specifically synthesizing Matthew Flanagan’s aesthetic investigation of Slow Film, Anne Bartsch’ model of emotional gratification and Heidegger’s phenomenology of boredom. By providing a delineation of possible pleasures of the seemingly paradoxical pleasure in the negative affect of boredom, this paper has relevant implications for the philosophical and psychological debate on what is known as the ‘paradox of negative emotions’. Moreover, by adding a phenomenological account of contemplation, it enriches the debate on the Slow Film genre with a distinct audience-orientated approach.\n\nThis article examines the relationship between boredom and cinema , particularly by attending to the ways in which it has been used as an aesthetic strategy in contemporary slow fi lms. These films use long takes and dedramatization to create dead time, where narrative causality and progress are abandoned to facilitate contemplative viewing. The article argues that this mode of spectatorship exhibits close affi nities to underlying features of boredom , and that fi lmmakers mute dramatic intensity and foreground idleness and ambiguity for a more aesthetically rewarding cinematic experience. The article explores this question through examining different types of boredom and dedramatization, before concluding with an extended analysis of Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2011).\n\nIn this article Christian Ferencz-Flatz and I try to give an answer to the question what film phenomenology actually is. We proceed in three steps. First, we provide a survey of five different research practices within current film phenomenological writing: We call them excavation, explanation, exemplification, extrapolation and expansion. Then we give an overview of the major shifts in the history of film phenomenology, sometimes zooming in on specific protagonists, from the 1930s till today. At the end we try to cluster three contemporary fields of interest that stand out as particularly noticeable. Here we focus on (1) embodied spectatorship, synaesthesia and the sense of touch, (2) feminist and queer film phenomenology and (3) film and/as consciousness.\n\nAiming to make an intervention in both emerging Slow Cinema and classical Trauma Cinema scholarship, this thesis demonstrates the ways in which the post-trauma cinema of Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz merges aesthetics of cinematic slowness with narratives of post-trauma in his films Melancholia (2008), Death in the Land of Encantos (2007) and Florentina Hubaldo, CTE (2012). Diaz has been repeatedly considered as representative of what Jonathan Romney termed in 2004 “Slow Cinema”. The director uses cinematic slowness for an alternative approach to an on screen representation of post-trauma. Contrary to popular trauma cinema, Diaz’s portrait of individual and collective trauma focuses not on the instantenaeity but on the duration of trauma. In considering trauma as a condition and not as an event, Diaz challenges the standard aesthetically techniques used in contemporary Trauma Cinema, as highlighted by Janet Walker (2001, 2005), Susannah Radstone (2001), Roger Luckhurst (2008) and others. Diaz’s films focus instead on trauma’s latency period, the depletion of a survivor’s resources, and a character’s slow psychological breakdown. Slow Cinema scholarship has so far focused largely on the films’ aesthetics and their alleged opposition to mainstream cinema. Little work has been done in connecting the films’ form to their content. Furthermore, Trauma Cinema scholarship, as trauma films themselves, has been based on the immediate and most radical signs of post-trauma, which are characterised by instantaneity; flashbacks, sudden fears of death and sensorial overstimulation. Following Lutz Koepnick’s argument that slowness offers “intriguing perspectives” (Koepnick, 2014: 191) on how trauma can be represented in art, this thesis seeks to consider the equally important aspects of trauma duration, trauma’s latency period and the slow development of characteristic symptoms. With the present work, I expand on current notions of Trauma Cinema, which places emphasis on speed and the unpredictability of intrusive memories. Furthermore, I aim to broaden the area of Slow Cinema studies, which has so far been largely focused on the films’ respective aesthetics, by bridging form and content of the films under investigation. Rather than seeing Diaz’s slow films in isolation as a phenomenon of Slow Cinema, I seek to connect them to the existing scholarship of Trauma Cinema studies, thereby opening up a reading of his films."
