        "meta_description": "Fearful of discrediting their scientific authority, anthropologists have long shunned what any film strives for, i.e., artfulness in the broadest sense. Eventually, with the realisation that many of the previous assumptions about scientific truth were questionable, the demand for ethnographic films to become more scientific or rebrand themselves as art lost its relevance. Moreover, while ethnographic film had long been associated with documentary practices, in the last few decades anthropologists have taken into consideration the ability of narrative and even fiction cinema to convey the symbolic structures and experiential knowledge of other cultures to the public. I argue that contemporary filmmakers, including Lithuanian film director, Šarūnas Bartas, and Russian filmmaker, Aleksey Fedorchenko, whose works examine an ethnographic subject, question the rigid distinction between art and ethnography and prompt us to rethink the definition of ethnographic film. To make my point, I analyse two of Bartas’s early films: Tofalaria (1986) and Few of Us (1996), and three Fedorchenko’s films: Shosho (2006), Silent Souls (2010), and Celestial Wives of the Meadow Mari (2012). The analysis of these films has shown the potential and limitations of diverse strategies in ethnographic filmmaking. This in turn creates premises for further discussion on a closer exchange between art and science and a different understanding of ethnographic film that does not rely solely on the documentary tradition and exclusively anthropologist-produced films.",
