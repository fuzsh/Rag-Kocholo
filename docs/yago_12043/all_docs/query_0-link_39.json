His films Few of Us and The House screened in Un Certain Regard in 1996 and 1997, respectively, while – ten years ago – his film Seven Invisible Men also screened in the Directors’ Fortnight.\n\nPeace to Us in Our Dreams is a story about a man who comes to a village for a weekend with his teenage daughter and a girlfriend. The relationship between the man and his young friend is complicated. The 16-year-old daughter has a hard time dealing with the adults’ relationship crisis, and she therefore feels lonely and estranged. Since her childhood, she has been friendly with a boy from the village while spending her days in a summer house. But one day, a boy steals a rifle from the local hunters, and then the troubles and the drama really begin."
