        "text": "Launched by filmmaker Carlos Reygadas and his producer Jaime Romandia, sales company NDM has acquired world sales rights to “Peace to Us in Our Dreams,” the latest title by Lithuanian uber-auteur Sharunas Bartas (“Koridorius,” “Freedom”).\n\nNDM has also picked up Gabriel Ripstein’s Panorama Special opener “600 Miles,” with Tim Roth. It is also handling Lisandro Alonso’s “Jauaja,” with Viggo Mortensen.\n\n“Peace” adds to NDM’s growing slate of bold art films from in and outside Mexico, including Reygadas’ “Post Tenebras Lux” and Amat Escalante’s “Heli,” both of which won Cannes Festival’s best director award two years in a row.\n\nWritten by Bartas, “Peace” turns on a daughter who is ignored by her father and whose wife, a violinist, has lost her joy of living, uncertain about her priority: her career or love. In the countryside, the daughter befriends a boy. One day he steals an optical sight rifle from a hunters’ lodge, sparking a large chase through the countryside.\n\n“Peace” stars Lora Kmieliauskaite, Ina Marija Bartaite and Bartas.\n\n“Sharunas Bartas was shooting Peace to us in our Dreams over almost one year. In November we showed first images to NDM. We were searching for a partner sharing the same vision of cinema. Their involvement and respect of director’s univers/work was crucial to be able to finish the shooting and start editing,” said French co-producer Janja Kralj, at KinoElectron.\n\nLithuania’s Studija Cinema produces with KinoElectron.\n\n“We want to continue to work with filmmakers whom we love and respect,” said NDM head Fiorella Moretti."
