        "text": "We took a two day tour of the Scottish Highlands and the Outlander fangirl in me kept squealing because we got to visit a lot of places that were mentioned in the book.\n\nTown of Inverness.. the gateway to the Highlands…\n\nWe passed by this pub and decided to eat here because there were a lot of people drinking on the patio..it must be popular!\n\nBangers and Mash / Fish and Chips / Beef and Mushroom Pie… we ordered the classic pub dishes and weren’t disappointed…\n\nGlencoe..\n\nWe also visited Clava Cairns, the Bronze Age burial site that was the inspiration behind Diana Galbaldon’s best selling book series Outlander.\n\nI hoped I could travel back in time by squeezing between the rocks like in the books… but it didn’t work….. I wasn’t the only one going crazy at the rocks.. there were so many other fans doing the same thing!\n\nWe also got to visit Culloden Battlefield, the site of the last bloody battle of the failed Jacobite Rising.\n\nI got quite emotional while visiting; even though Outlander is fictional, the battle did occur and so many lives were lost.\n\nWe also visited Loch Ness and look.. is that Nessie????\n\nOur last stop in the short trip to the Highlands was to the town of Pitlochry, a small charming town that somehow reminds me of Harry Potter?????\n\nI’ve never had such a large piece of fried fish!!!\n\nFAIM? OUI OUI!!!\n\nThe Castle Tavern\n\n1 View Pl, Inverness IV2 4SA, United Kingdom\n\n+44 1463 718178\n\nFound the best seafood restaurant in Edinburgh! It’s so good that I ate there three nights in a row!\n\nThe seafood are mostly all from Scotland so it’s really fresh.\n\nThese Scottish oysters are soooooooo sweet! I haven’t seen / tried these anywhere else yet….\n\nprobably the most filling seafood chowder ever…. it had CHUNKS of fish.\n\nSurf and Turf .. not really liking the steak….\n\nMussels!!!!!! I became famous at the restaurant because I first ate dinner with my friends…. then immediately after, I ate another meal with my family, at the next table! The staff was shocked that I could eat another kg of mussels….. he has never seen anyone eat so many mussels before!\n\nHot Seafood Platter (scallops, tiger prawns and mussels poached in seafood sauce topped with grilled sea bass fillet and crème fraiche)……\n\nShellfish Pasta (Mussels, tiger prawns, scallops and fettuccini in a shellfish bisque)….\n\nscallop risotto….\n\nThis was my best restaurant find in Edinburgh. Mussel Inn has fresh seafood for an affordable price!\n\nFAIM? OUI OUI!!!\n\nMussel Inn Seafood Restaurant\n\n61-65 Rose St, Edinburgh EH2 2NH, UK\n\n+44 843 289 2481\n\nSeriously… I love Edinburgh because it feels like stepping back into time… just look at Edinburgh Castle and all the old buildings around Royal Mile. Apart of that, lots of hotels and restaurants are also located in renovated old buildings.\n\nWe had lunch at Howies and it’s located in a gorgeous Georgian building.\n\nThe lunch set is a pretty good deal.. appetizer + main for 10.95 pounds!\n\nTraditional Scottish Haggis (minced sheep’s heart, liver and lungs)…. This is THE NATIONAL DISH OF SCOTLAND and because of that, I had to give it a try (even though the ingredients are given me the pukes already)….. I wasn’t sure how haggis would smell and taste like but I can say now that it tastes like regular ground meat! It didn’t smell and didn’t had any weird gamey taste. If it weren’t for the constant reminder in my head about it being sheep’s innards, I could have finished it. It really wasn’t so bad… just don’t tell me what it is!\n\nGrilled fillet of Shetland Salmon….\n\nAfter lunch, we also wandered to the cementary where people claimed J.K. Rowling got her Harry Potter influence. Can you see whose grave it is?\n\nFAIM? OUI OUI!!!\n\nHowies\n\n29 Waterloo Pl, Edinburgh EH1 3BQ, United Kingdom\n\nPhone:+44 131 556 5766\n\nI didn’t get to try Edinburgh’s Michelin starred restaurant, The Kitchin, but I did try their other venture, a gastropub.\n\nI love trying out gastropubs because they mostly serve classic pub dishes, but with a twist.\n\nBBQ pastrami ribs & chips… This was their newest creation. The meat was tender but was too salty.\n\nfish pie…. Their famous classic fish pie but it tasted like normal fish pie.. carbs overload!\n\nsteak pie with bone marrow….. This was quite interesting! I’ve never seen bone marrow jutting out from a pie before… The pastry was so flaky but the steak was a bit too tough….\n\nI was really looking forward to this meal but I think the food was a bit overhyped.\n\nFAIM? OUI OUI!!\n\nThe Scran and Scallie\n\n1 Comely Bank Rd, Edinburgh EH4 1DT, United Kingdom\n\nPhone:+44 131 332 6281"
