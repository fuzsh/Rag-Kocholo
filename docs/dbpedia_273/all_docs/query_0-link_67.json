        "text": "New albums for Nov. 18\n\nMiranda Lambert, “The Weight of These Wings” (RCA Nashville). Definitely less talkative than her ex-husband Blake Shelton, clever country star Lambert is letting the 24 songs of her sixth studio LP, a double album, handle most of what she wants to say to the rest of us.\n\nMetallica, “Hardwired..to Self-Destruct” (Blackened Recordings). Well into middle age, one of the most important, popular bands in heavy-metal history puts out 88 minutes and two discs of material — its first studio album(s) since 2008 — without a big-name producer.\n\nSplit Single, “Metal Frames” (Inside Outside). Wilco bassist John Stirratt is the new guy on the second full-length from Split Single, the fantastic indie-rock band Jason Narducy maintains as a song outlet when he and drummer Jon Wurster aren’t backing the likes of Bob Mould.\n\nJohn Batiste, “Christmas with John Batiste” (Naht Jona, LLC). Multi-keyboard whiz, Julliard grad and sidekick to talk-show host Stephen Colbert picks up players like Aloe Blacc and Lee England Jr. to interpret holiday faves and compose candidates for new holiday songs.\n\nTyler Daniel Bean, “On Days Soon to Pass” (Skeletal Lightning/Tor Johnson Records). In the processes of attaining a master’s degree and battling depression, self-described “heavy indie” poet and musician has also created a second LP of thoughts from suicidal to loving.\n\nPhil Campbell and the Bastard Sons, “Phil Campbell and Bastard Sons” (Motörhead Music). Motörhead guitarist who nearly retired after the death of band frontman Lemmy last year puts out the first EP of his renamed All Starr Band of actual scions and vocalist Neil Starr.\n\nJack Carty, “Home State” (Gilded Lily). Rising in popularity in Australia, Brisbane troubadour and freshly married man issues his current long-player of genially traditional folk wrapped in pretty ribbons of pop introversion.\n\nCeltic Woman, “Voices of Angels” (Celtic Woman/Manhattan). Introducing newcomer and Celtic violinist Tara McNeill and working with the 72-piece Orchestra of Ireland, the incredibly well-received Irish musical experience showcases rearranged older songs and previously unrecorded ones.\n\nD∆WN, “Redemption” (Local Action/Out Dawn Entertainment). A.K.A. Dawn Richard, the former Danity Kane member and P-Diddy protégé issues the finale in an album trilogy that challenges modern R&B while using some of the subgenre’s very familiar elements.\n\nAndra Day, “Merry Christmas from Andra Day” (Warner). Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter sort of discovered by Stevie Wonder sings with him on one of five yuletide songs evidently chosen to highlight the jazzy and poppy potential of her pipes.\n\nDNCE, “DNCE” (Joseph Jonas/Republic). Joe Jonas, formerly of the Jonas Brothers, is the most famous member of the band DNCE, a quartet that uses some of that Jonas-level pop-rock business on its success-primed debut LP.\n\nE-40, “The D-Boy Diary: Book 1,” “The D-Boy Diary: Book 2” (Heavy on the Grind Entertainment). West Coast rapper with investing interests in the beverage industry and a discography that goes back to 1993 adds two more discs to the list with help from Gucci Mane, Lil B and more.\n\nESP Ohio, “Starting Point of the Royal Cyclopean” (Guided By Voice). Robert Pollard, two members of the current lineup for his indie-rock standard-bearer Guided by Voices and a drummer who has produced other Pollard side projects play a lively set of pop-rock songs.\n\nJohnnie Guilbert, “Lost” (Talent Shoppe). San Jose, California fella who’s been a YouTube star for the last couple years, and a former member of “My Digital Escape,” continues branching into the music industry via a six-song EP of sweetly bland pop.\n\nHighly Suspect, “The Boy Who Died Wolf” (300 Entertainment). Cape Cod-to-Brooklyn rock trio follows Grammy-nominated 2015 introductory full-length “Mister Asylum” with Bogota, Columbia sessions resulting in a broader, groovier second full-length that holds onto the angst.\n\nHigh Valley, “Dear Life” (Atlantic Nashville). Alberta, Canada sibling duo of Brad and Curtis Rempel makes major-label debut on a long-player that’s already had two North American hit singles and mingles fairly straight country, bluegrass and twangy pop.\n\nJames Newton Howard, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)” (WaterTower Music). Composer and conductor of soundtracks for the “Batman,” “Bourne” and “Hunger Games” franchises moves his wand over to “Harry Potter,” although this movie, based on another J.K. Rowling book and screenplay, is a spinoff of that series.\n\nPatrick Joseph, “Hindsight” (Incline). Alternate takes, new mixes and new masters of older songs accompany the latest singles from a Pittsburgh-born singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who sounds ready to get into the contemporary-pop market where Michael Bublé dwells.\n\nJustice, “Woman” (Because Music). On its third studio album and first since 2011, French electronic duo collaborates with the London Contemporary Orchestra and finds its own path into Daft Punkian disco while also renewing its interest in alternative-minded dance music.\n\nRobert Earl Keen, “Live Dinner Reunion” (Dualtone). In his 60th year and two decades after issuing his best-selling album to date, “No. 2 Live Dinner,” Americana pioneer Keen issues another live disc, a sequel including Lyle Lovett, Bruce Robison and other friends and admirers doing lots of his songs.\n\nBobby Kimball, “We’re Not in Kansas Anymore” (King). An original vocalist of Toto and thus a key voice heard on Toto hits like “Africa” and “Hold the Line,” Kimball hasn’t joined that band’s current reunion and continues his solo career of album-oriented rock, as heard on this Japanese import.\n\nLamb of God, “The Duke” (Epic). While this five-song EP features only two new songs, those two new songs are excellent examples of this modern-metal band’s continued command of the idiom, and the title track has catalyzed a LofG charity campaign to fight leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nLanikai, “Lanikai” (Hidden Pony). After announcing an “indefinite” hiatus for Imaginary Cities, Winnipeg indie-pop and -rock singer Marti Sarbit has formed a new five-piece act in which she is frontwoman, songwriter and a more spotlighted figure on a five-song introductory EP.\n\nLittle Mix, “Glory Days” (Syco Music). A “girl group” that arose from the eighth season of “The X Factor” in the UK, Little Mix is up to its fourth full-length, previewed by the female-power lead single “Shout Out to My Ex” and packed with up-to-date pop with a few cute little retro nods.\n\nMakari, “Elegies” (InVogue). Testing out a new singer, former Decoder and VersaEmerge guy Spencer Pearson, Orlando, Florida band kicks out five new songs of sweetly meant, cleanly executed post-hardcore energy.\n\nMan & the Echo, “Man & the Echo” (PIAS America). Twenty miles away from Manchester, England, a band presumably named after a Yeats poem has been assembling a highly catchy, yet not copacetic, debut album out of rock and pop elements borrowed from the Jam and less crass 1990s Britpop bands.\n\nBruno Mars, “24K Magic” (Atlantic). Four years after his last solo single and his last solo album, the Hawaiian-born, L.A.-based soul, funk, rock, pop and whatever-else artiste is back with a third solo album and a title track that’s already lunging through dancefloors.\n\nBlake Neely, “Blindspot (Original Television Soundtrack: Season 1)” (La-La Land/Tower Music). A composer involved with superhero TV shows like “Supergirl” has many other credits, among them a mildly twisty crime drama, “Blindspot,” for which he provides largely electronic backing.\n\nNewSong, “The Best Christmas Ever!” (HHM/Word Distribution). Contemporary-Christian music group that’s almost infamous for its holiday song “The Christmas Shoes” puts a live version of that on a collection of older tracks and five newly recorded tracks.\n\nGinny Owens, “Love Be the Loudest” (ChickPower Music). A CCM artiste used to playing in acoustic-guitar mode with thoughtful lyrics steps outside of what she’s used to with a different set of producers, collaborators and signposts in pop and EDM styles.\n\nPink Martini, “Je Dis Oui!” (Heinz). Portland, Oregon’s “little orchestra” indie band enlists Rufus Wainwright, NPR’s Ari Shapiro and others to help sing English, French and six other languages in beautiful and charming songs ranging from “Blue Moon” to Miriam Makeba’s “Pata Pata.”\n\nProtest the Hero, “Pacific Myth” (Protest the Hero/Razor & Tie). Ontario progressive-rock band originally made its current set of fret-straining songs available by Bandcamp subscription but now puts those songs out for larger public consumption.\n\nNathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, “A Little Something More from” (Stax). Almost obviously a companion to last year’s homonymous first LP from this old-school R&B combo from Denver, “More” means new recordings of live faves, B-sides and other pleasurable odds and sods.\n\nRoyal Teeth, “Amateurs” (Round Hill). Louisiana indie-rock band that isn’t so indie it won’t show up on “American Idol” returns with a seven-song extended play on which the vocals of Gary Larsen and Nora Patterson are still put together in uplifting ways, even in the saddest moments.\n\nJane Siberry, “Angels Bend Closer” (Sheeba Music). Siberry, one of Canada’s most intriguing contributors to the more unusual side of adult pop music, drops her first new official LP in five years, which swirls her experimental side around wide accessibility and includes a duet with K.D. Lang.\n\nBrian Simpson, “Persuasion” (Shanachie). A keyboardist often heard overseeing the Dave Koz Band is a much-lauded player in smooth-jazz circles and is likely to continue being lauded therein with the hit “Soul City” and this newest full-length.\n\nSolange, “A Seat at the Table” (Columbia). Her big sister Beyoncé doesn’t show up on her fourth album, but Beyoncé’s Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, Lil Wayne and Q-Tip do, and Solange has accompanying online poems and photographs as well as this new physical release of what was released digitally September 30.\n\nJuan Maria Solare, “Music Box Music” (Janus Music & Sound). An Argentine composer and pianist who lives in Germany, Solare might be perfectly placed to create 31varied tracks meant, at the title indicates, for the insularly intricate sound of a music box.\n\nDough Stanhope, “No Place Like Home” (Comedy Dynamics). Taped in his hometown of Bisbee, Arizona, the latest special from the intelligently angry, raspy-voiced stand-up comic generously dispenses jokes from his bleak and skeptical worldview.\n\nThee Oh Sees, “An Odd Entrances” (Castle Face). San Francisco band driven by singer and guitarist John Dwyer — who’s had plenty of other bands and musical things going on — puts out its second album of the year and provides psych-rock diversions and anxieties.\n\nVarious artists, ““Kitsuné Maison Compilation 18: The Hysterical Advisory Issue” (Maison Kitsuné). The French music and fashion label often looks for what’s hip and good at the same time, and its latest compilation maintains the quality by circling around underground hip-hop influence.\n\nVarious artists, “Moana (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)” (Walt Disney). An animated movie about a Polynesian princess and her adventures utilizes not only Broadway virtuoso Manuel Lin-Miranda and “The Lion King” soundtrack composer Mark Mancina but also players versed in South Pacific musical culture.\n\nHannah Williams & the Affirmations, “Late Nights & Heartbreak” (Record Kicks). If English soul isn’t always a respected subdivision of soul music, then women like Adele have changed a few minds and, now, so do Bristol-based Hannah Williams and her Affirmations on a brassy new record featuring a solid cover of Led Zeppelin’s “Dazed and Confused.”\n\nWilson’s Reservoir, “The Last Will and Testament of Buck Baker” (Wilson’s Reservoir). Goshen, Indiana foursome uses primary songwriter’s great grandfather, the titular testifier, as the basis for an oft-contemplative Americana and post-punk disc about history and taller tales.\n\nMike Zito, “Make Blues Not War” (Ruf). Normally the sort of bluesman who deals in a lot of styles with his road band, the Wheel, St. Louis resident Zito this time comes out of Nashville with a blues-rock disc that focuses a little more than usual on his guitar-slinging abilities.\n\n— Jon M.
