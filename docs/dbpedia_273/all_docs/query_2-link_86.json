        "text": "Ignore what the catchy song says, THIS is the Greatest Show ... it's the Olympic Games.\n\nThis year, the world's greatest athletes will come together in France's capital city Paris to run, jump, swim, twist, twirl, kick, punch and climb their way to the top of the Olympic podium.\n\nThese Games are, for many athletes, the pinnacle of their sport - there is no greater achievement than earning an Olympic gold medal.\n\nBut with more than 10,000 athletes competing and only 300 gold medals up for grabs, only the best will be able to call themselves Olympic champions when the Games end.\n\nSo, here is everything you need to know about the 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe opening ceremony will take place on Friday 26 July 2024.\n\nThere will be a total of 19 days of competition but some preliminary events take place before the opening ceremony, such as archery qualifying and early rounds of rugby sevens, football and handball.\n\nThe first gold medal will be won on Saturday 27 July and will likely come from the shooting ranges, with rifle and pistol shooting competitions kicking things off.\n\nThis will be followed by 16 days of world class sport, and Newsround will be in Paris to make sure you don't miss a moment.\n\nThe closing ceremony takes place on Sunday 11 August.\n\nSome of the world's most famous landmarks will be the backdrop to the Games in Paris.\n\nWe could just let these mocked-up images of the venues speak for themselves, but let us take you through some of them.\n\nCheck out the beach volleyball arena, located in front of the world famous Eiffel Tower.\n\nJust below the iconic structure will also be a huge fan park where members of the public can watch events on big screens and even meet some of the athletes after they have competed.\n\nUnlike the last Summer Olympics in Tokyo, most of the events will be taking place at a TV-friendly time for viewers in the UK.\n\nParis is just one hour ahead of the UK, so any event that takes place at 6pm in Paris will be on TV at 5pm here in the UK.\n\nPlus, the Games will be taking place during the summer holidays for most schools, so you may even be able to negotiate a slightly later bedtime to watch the biggest moments, including the 100m finals in the athletics.\n\nDon't worry though, the BBC will be broadcasting hundreds of hours of Olympics coverage on television and online.\n\nThere will be plenty of the traditional Olympic sports such as athletics, swimming, rowing and cycling as well as gymnastics, badminton, tennis and boxing.\n\nThis year, surfing, skateboarding, BMX freestyle and sport climbing will also return after their success in Tokyo.\n\nThere will also be the brand new addition of breaking at this year's Games, which is a form of acrobatic dance where competitors combine power moves and freezes to impress judges and earn themselves the Olympic gold medal.\n\nWe can also expect to see combat sports such as taekwondo, judo and wrestling.\n\nThe Olympics is often a great opportunity to see sports you don't get the chance to watch very often, for example water polo, artistic swimming, fencing, handball and basketball.\n\nNew events in the sailing competitions will also include a form of windsurfing called iQFoil and kiteboarding.\n\nTeam GB is almost complete so let's take a look at the athletes who have been officially named in the Olympic squads.\n\nExperts are predicting big things from skateboarder Sky Brown, who took bronze in Tokyo.\n\nShe won the world park championships in February last year, and is also hoping to become the first British athlete to compete in two sports at the same Olympic Games as she hopes to qualify for both the skateboarding AND surfing events.\n\nBritain's artistic gymnasts are also ones to watch, with high hopes for medals from both the men's and women's teams.\n\nVeteran bars expert Becky Downie is hoping to claim her first individual Olympic medal, while Georgia-Mae Fenton, Alice Kinsella, Abigail Martin and Ruby Evans are hoping to all make their mark on the Olympic stage.\n\nJake Jarman will also want to prove himself on an Olympic stage after he took an historic world gold on the vault last year.\n\nIn athletics, Keeley Hodgkinson will no doubt want to go one better than her breakout performance in Tokyo, where she took home the silver medal in the 800m.\n\nPlus world champion Katerina Johnson-Thompson will want to complete her major medal collection in the heptathlon - but can she overcome injury in time to top that podium?\n\nIn the pool, Adam Peaty will hope to add to his medal tally, and Tom Dean, who also took home two golds from the last Olympics, says he is aiming to pick up a few more in Paris.\n\nTriathletes Alex Yee and Beth Potter are also confirmed to be swimming, cycling and running around Paris and will both have big goals for the year ahead.\n\nBeth is a current world champion and Alex won a gold and a silver in Tokyo, so will he add to his haul?\n\nOne of the biggest stars you will not want to miss in Paris is of course US pocket powerhouse Simone Biles.\n\nThe most decorated gymnast of all time is hoping to add to her already impressive medal tally of four golds, one silver and two bronzes.\n\nBut she will have to beat another breakout gymnastics star in Brazilian Rebecca Andrede, who took the all-around title in Tokyo after Biles withdrew from the event citing mental health struggles.\n\nIt won't just be about Sky Brown at the skatepark in 2024.\n\nCanadian teenager Fay DeFazio Ebert has burst onto the scene in recent months after her incredible win at the 2023 Pan Am Games (where athletes from the Americas - North, Central and South America, compete for intercontinental glory) in Chile.\n\nNot only that, but Fay, who is 14, is a talented singer, so watch out for her in the charts as well as the medal tables."
