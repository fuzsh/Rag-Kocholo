        "text": "Experience firsthand the excellence and passion that have defined Ateliers de France in the realms of heritage and luxury building restoration, since its inception. Immerse yourself in a series of live craft demonstrations, where artisans showcase their unparalleled skills. Throughout the afternoon, representatives from various Ateliers de France maisons will exhibit their specific crafts and savoir-faire within the distinctive ambiance of the Ateliers de France New-York Studio.\n\nDelve into the world of Rémy Garnier, at the avant-garde of high end, indoor-outdoor bronze hardware and lighting products since 1832. Witness the artistry firsthand as a skilled chiseler breathes new life into a freshly cast bronze piece, delicately sculpting its contours and motifs with meticulously crafted hand-made tools.\n\nThe showroom will also welcome a plasterer from Atelier Louis Del Boca, who will skillfully craft the intricate details of a Bas-Relief in plaster. This demonstration will allow guests to delve into the tradition of Atelier Louis Del Boca, recognized for its expertise in plasterwork, ornamentation, and stucco since 1931.\n\nJoin a drawing workshop lead by Joel Orgiazzi from Ateliers VLD and discover the process involved in creating decorative locksmithing, metalwork or ironwork. This workshop promises to be a unique opportunity for participants to hone their drawing skills under Orgiazzi’s expert guidance.\n\nAtelier de la Boiserie‘s sculptors will also be showcasing their unique craft of woodcarving by carving a classical-style crossbeam before your eyes. Immerse yourself further in the world of woodworking with an interactive workshop, where guests can explore the mastery of woodcarving tools firsthand.\n\nAlongside the demonstrations, visitors will have the chance to admire a model of the medieval framework of Notre-Dame de Paris, created by apprentices from Perrault Academy, and testament to the unique expertise in carpentry of Ateliers Perrault.\n\nFollowing the demonstrations, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm, Ateliers de France extends its invitation for a cocktail reception. Let’s come together to celebrate the conclusion of Oui Design! in the company of esteemed design professionals, architects, interior designers, skilled artisans, and design enthusiasts.\n\nPierre Frey, the leading French company in the home textiles sector, cordially invites you to explore their latest addition: the esteemed manufacturer Zuber, now proudly part of the family. Join them from 2:00pm to 3:00pm for a presentation by expert Brian Coleman, acclaimed author of “Zuber: Two Centuries of Panoramic Wallpaper,” as well as the master installers, preservationists, and restorers Jim Francis and John Nalewaja of Scenic Wallpapers. The event will be followed by a book signing with Brian Coleman.\n\nSince its establishment in 1797, Zuber wallpapers’ fame has spread far and wide, from King Louis Philippe awarding Jean Zuber the Legion of Honor in 1834 to Jackie Kennedy installing Zuber’s “Vues de l’Amérique du Nord” in the White House. Two centuries later, today the company keeps the historic significance and unique craftsmanship of Zuber alive by employing the same antique woodblocks, paint formulas, and time-honored processes pioneered by Jean Zuber himself."
