        "text": "FRENCH troops marched on Buckingham Palace yesterday — but only in the spirit of cross-Channel friendship.\n\nAn elite squad of 32 members from France’s Gendarmerie Garde Républicaine took part in Changing of the Guard.\n\nPutting aside centuries of conflict — which ended with the Duke of Wellington’s victory over Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815 — the band of the Grenadier Guards struck up French national anthem La Marseillaise on the Palace forecourt.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Edward and Sophie, stood in for the King, who is having cancer treatment, to oversee the show of friendship marking 120 years of the signing of the Entente Cordiale.\n\nIn a reciprocal move, 16 British soldiers from the Number 7 Company, Coldstream Guards, joined French counterparts to provide a Presidential Guard for Emmanuel Macron outside the Elysee Palace, in Paris.\n\nIn a video address, Mr Macron hailed the 1904 treaty, saying: “Long live the Entente Cordiale and long live the Franco-British friendship.”\n\nThe celebration of Anglo-French co-operation comes months after the King and Queen were in Paris, Versailles and Bordeaux for a three-day state visit.\n\nHowever, it was the first time French troops had taken part in Changing of the Guard.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence stressed the French soldiers were just joining the ceremony and not guarding the Palace — a role reserved for British and Commonwealth troops.\n\nDuring the 15-minute ceremony, Edward and Sophie inspected the troops along with French ambassador, Hélène Duchêne.\n\nThey were joined by the UK’s Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Patrick Sanders, and his French counterpart, General Pierre Schill.\n\nThe parade featured a remarkable display of unity with the 32 French troops sharing the Palace forecourt with 40 Guardsmen from the Scots Guards.\n\nThe band of the Grenadier Guards played both national anthems and a medley of Anglo-French music.\n\nWhile crowds of tourists watched the historic events at Buckingham Palace, a similar ceremony took place at the Elysée Palace.\n\nMr Macron and Britain’s ambassador to France, Dame Menna Rawlings, looked on as British soldiers took part in the French changing of the guard.\n\nIn London, Major Jamie Drummond-Moray, Officer Commanding F Company Scots Guards, said: “It’s an enormous privilege for us to host the French here in London.\n\n“It really is a monumental occasion and more so given that it’s marking 120 years of the relationship between the UK with France.\n\n\"I think it’s a great honour for all our soldiers, and a fantastic day for everyone in France and the UK.”\n\nIt’s an enormous privilege for us to host the French here in London\n\nMajor Jamie Drummond-Moray\n\nMajor Zacharias Faja, Company Commander, Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards, said in Paris: “The partnership between France and the UK has only deepened in the last 120 years and today our militaries operate shoulder-to- shoulder around the world in our collective mission for international peace, security and resilience.\n\n“It’s an honour for my soldiers to be taking part in today’s ceremony in what is a historic moment for both our countries.”\n\nThe Entente Cordiale was an agreement, which, in effect, ended the long-standing antagonism between Britain and France.\n\nThe new allies fought together in both world wars and now form an integral part of Nato.\n\nYesterday’s events were part of a list of joint UK-French activities planned for 2024 — including the 80th anniversary of D-Day in June."
