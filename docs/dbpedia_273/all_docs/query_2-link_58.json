        "text": "03/18/2024\n\nHi there, Eiffel Tower!\n\nAll eyes will be on Paris this summer as the 2024 Summer Olympics make their way to The City of Light.\n\nIf youâre planning a trip to cheer on swimmers in the Seine River or watch volleyball with a view of the Eiffel Tower, I want to help!\n\nParis is one of the most famous European destinations from CVG and with good reason. Itâs easy to get to (with even more flights being added later this year), easy to navigate even if you donât speak French, and offers a chance to visit some of the most famous spots in the world.\n\nThe perfect start to a day in Paris.\n\nThe Eiffel Towerâ¦ and much more!\n\nAny first-time visit to Paris will probably include visiting the cityâs most iconic landmark. At over 1,000 feet high, the real Eiffel Tower is three times bigger than the one at Kings Island. There are also multiple ways to ascend to the viewing platform at the top. If you want to save a few bucks and are physically able to, you can climb the 674 steps from the ground to the âsecond floor.â\n\nThe climb to the top takes a little extra time but offers unique views.\n\nIt makes for a pretty cool experience: fewer people, a chance to pause and enjoy the view on the way up, and the opportunity to appreciate the intricate design of the Tower. You can also take an elevator from the ground to the top.\n\nWe decided to visit at sunset and enjoyed a daytime and nighttime view.\n\nA stunning view from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThere are plenty of famous places to check out. Make sure to grab a ticket in advance for The Louvre. Originally a 12th-Century fortress, it is the most visited art museum in the world. And for good reason. It houses some of the most iconic works of art, including the Mona Lisa, Venus De Milo, and The Raft of the Medusa.\n\nA perfect activity for a brisk, cloudy morning.\n\nWe chose the very first time slot and immediately made our way to the Mona Lisa, then the Venus De Milo. This allowed us to view both works before the massive crowds moved in.\n\n(Left) All alone with the Mona Lisa. (Right) The faÃ§ade of The Louvre.\n\nMake sure to allow plenty of time to see as much as you can; itâs a huge space with thousands of pieces on display.\n\nAbout five years ago, a massive fire heavily damaged one of the worldâs most famous examples of French Gothic architecture, the Notre Dame Cathedral. Since then, over 1,000 people have worked tirelessly to restore the 860year-old building to its former glory. The building is scheduled to reopen to the public this December, but the exterior can be viewed anytime.\n\nThe Notre-Dame de Paris (before the fire of 2019)\n\nIf you have time, try strolling by during the day and again at night to truly appreciate its beauty.\n\nContinue walking along the Seine River to appreciate the beauty of Parisian homes and neighborhoods. Stop into a cafe for a bite to eat or a pastry (just donât eat while using public transportation).\n\nA cloudy day along the Seine River\n\nOther stops on your trip might include the SacrÃ©-CÅur Basilica, Moulin Rouge, Musee dâOrsay, Arc de Triomphe, and the Champs-Elysees. I recommend checking out the TripAdvisor top things to visit page here to decide what youâd like to do before arriving.\n\nParis is a perfect destination any time of year.\n\nThe city makes a great vacation choice for anyone, whether it be a honeymoon, a couples getaway, family trip, an excursion for a solo traveler, or just a last-minute escape. As the seasons change, so do the events and things to see around town.\n\nA bustling street in the city\n\nJanuary through early March offer great value. Flights are cheaper, accommodations are plentiful, and tourist attractions have shorter lines. Spring break sees an increase in tourism as families look to visit while their kids are out of school, and the number of visitors continues to increase into summer. July is generally the busiest month for tourists. August is busy, too.\n\nSummertime is magical\n\nLonger days and nicer weather attract visitors from around the world. Prices will be a bit higher, and youâll want to book hotels and attractions well in advance.\n\nThe Pantheon Dome during Christmas 2019\n\nWhen September rolls around, so do the deals. The crowds thin, and the weather is still nice. Christmas in Paris is beautiful with decorations and markets to visit around town.\n\nA Christmas market with Notre Dame in the background\n\nParis makes a great âhome baseâ to explore France.\n\nThanks to an excellent public transportation system, including high-speed trains, Paris is a great place to begin or wrap up a trip around France.\n\nHello, Lyon!\n\nTake a two-hour train ride south and experience the city of Lyon. We really enjoyed it. Itâs a big city but has sort of a smaller town feel than Paris. (Kind of like Cincinnati!) A trip in November was perfect for us; the weather was comfortable, the crowds were small, and we were able to see some remaining fall colors while the Christmas markets were gearing up.\n\nA beautiful view along the Rhone River in Lyon\n\nContinue just another hour south by train, and youâll experience the magnificent medieval town of Avignon. I canât say enough about this incredible gem in the Provence region of France. The town looks like a fairytale around every corner, complete with a 14th-century papal palace appropriately named the Palais des Papes.\n\nAvignon is gorgeous\n\nThe city has a beautiful river, excellent cafes and shops, and friendly people.\n\nWe booked a small group tour of the Provence area, which ended up being a private tour with an excellent guide because it was the low season. The views, history, and tastes of the region are unlike anything else.\n\nThe Provence region in late fall was perfect\n\nAccommodations are easy to come by and are more affordable than larger cities like Paris. Much like any European city, expect smaller, cozier hotel rooms. Bonus: terraces!\n\nWeâre all about a good terrace!\n\nParis is easy to get to from CVG!\n\nIâve often mentioned my favorite flight from CVG is Deltaâs non-stop service to Paris. And it still is! Hereâs why.\n\nItâs currently offered three times per week, and beginning May 23, 2024, it will be offered seven days a week.\n\nIt leaves at 6:05 pm, which can save you valuable vacation time. Work pretty much a full day, head to the airport, hop on board, and enjoy dinner shortly after takeoff. After dinner, pop on your eye mask and headphones, get some sleep, and wake up around 8:00 am Paris time, ready to greet the city!\n\nYou can often find a great deal on this flight during off-peak times or by booking ahead.\n\nOne-stop flights are offered daily on American, United, Delta, and Air Canada as well.\n\nThe architecture of The Louvre is beautiful.\n\nPlanning on traveling to Paris during the Olympic Games?\n\nAwesome! It will be an incredible experience in a world-class city. Here are a few things Iâd recommend.\n\nBook your flights now. Or better yet, yesterday. If youâre having difficulty finding flights, try flying into London, Barcelona, Amsterdam, or other nearby cities, and book a short flight from there.\n\nBook your accommodations now. (Again, yesterday would have been better.) Paris can get pricey during the summer months. Add in a major event like this, and finding a place can be challenging. Consider looking outside of the main core of the city and in an area with good public transit access to get you into the city. There will also be competition venues throughout the Paris regionâand all of Franceâso figure out what interests you most and plan accordingly.\n\nBeware of ticket deals that seem too good to be true. Make sure to purchase tickets directly from trusted sources.\n\nKeep an eye on the Jayâs Deals page for a great deal on your next flight. We love visiting Europe and sharing our adventures at @JayKruzOfficial on Facebook, Instagram, and X (Twitter).\n\nIâll see you in a cafe in Paris this summer!\n\n-Jay"
