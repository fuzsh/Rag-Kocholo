        "text": "“I’ve never seen so many European royals in France before,” said Helene de Ludinghausen. She was referring to the impressive crowd that turned out at Versailles recently for Sybilla Weiller’s marriage to Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg. Held at the town’s St. Louis Cathedral, the wedding was attended by 2,000 people, including Queen Sofia of Spain with her daughters Cristina and Elena; Queen Sonya of Norway with her son, Haakon, and daughter, Matha; Victoria of Sweden, and the King of Belgium.\n\nValentino drew raves for Weiller’s wedding dress, and Hubert de Givenchy designed the perfect powder blue suit for the bride’s mother, Olimpia Weiller. Referring to the pillbox hat that accompanied the outfit, Givenchy admitted, “Of course we had Jackie Onassis in mind.”\n\nBeatrice de Rothschild wasn’t wearing either designer’s clothes. The elaborate broderie anglaise sleeves on her white shirt had been her great-grandmother’s bloomers, she said.\n\nAfter the ceremony, some 1,500 guests, including Sandy and Jean de Yturbe, Edouard and Arielle de Rothschild, Ines and Luigi d’Urso, Alfred and Judy Taubman and Amyn Aga Khan attended the lunch planned by Pierre Celeyron and Olimpia Weiller. The buffet was served under a tent decorated with topiaries. Even after such an elaborate event, including seating so many people for lunch, Weiller said, “I’m too exhilarated for my daughter to be exhausted.”"
