        "text": "Opening Reception\n\nWednesday, October 11\n\n6:00 p.m.\n\nPortland Art Museum\n\nDevin Phillips\n\nDevin Phillips is constantly pushing the borders of what is considered modern jazz today. Phillips carries a torch passed to him by a long lineage of New Orleans masters. Refusing to play music over the heads of his audience, Devin’s approach somehow manages to bring together elements of American culture old and new. Avid jazz fans will enjoy the tradition that is so prevalent in his sound, while people new to his music always find it accessible and engaging. Phillips’s ability to convey emotion through his music shines through and truly displays a voice all his own. http://devinphillips.com/\n\nOpening Plenary Session & Roll Call of the States\n\nThursday, October 12\n\n9:00 a.m.\n\nElizabeth Woody, Oregon Poet Laureate\n\nElizabeth A.
