        "text": "The IOHE relies on a participative approach to attain its objectives. Member institutions, represented by its legal representative, together make up the General Assembly, the supreme decision-making body of the Organization.\n\nThe General Assembly participates in the election of the Board of Directors, its President as well as its Vice Presidents and ratifies the election of the Regional Councils. It designates the Executive Director, the Treasurer and the Legal Advisor.\n\nThe General Assembly identifies priorities, establishes annual fees and other questions of financial contribution, establishes the aims and adopts the decisions or useful recommendations for the effective management of the Organization.\n\nThe General Assembly meets once a year at a date and location decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors is the body responsible for managing the administrative affairs of the IOHE. It is comprised of 13 experienced members who typically sit at the head some of the largest universities in their respective countries.\n\nThe Board of Directors strives to maintain a balanced representation of public, private, cooperative and denominational universities from across the Americas.\n\nEach of the nine IOHE regions is under the responsibility of a Regional Council, presided over by a Vice President who serves a renewable two-year term. They provide support for the President, the General-Secretariat, and the Executive Directors of IOHE programs, which together form the Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board meets twice a year, in addition to maintaining regular contact between meetings.\n\nCurrently, it is comprised of:\n\nPresident: Maritza Rondón Rangel, President, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Colombia\n\nExecutive Director: David Julien, Canada\n\nTreasurer: Valérie Amiraux, Vice-Rector, Community and International Partnerships, Université de Montréal, Canada\n\nOutgoing President: Oscar Garrido Alvarez, President, Universidad de Los Lagos, Chile\n\nRegional Vice Presidents:\n\nAndean Countries: Walter Mera Ortiz, President, Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil, Ecuador\n\nBrazil: Alfredo Gomes, President, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil\n\nCanada: Joy Johnson, President and Vice-Chancellor, Simon Fraser University, Canada\n\nCaribbean: Ana E.
