        "text": "Page 151 →Chapter 4 Eyo’nlé Brass Band Transforming the Blues\n\nIn Benin, brass instruments are typically played in local fanfares for funerals and other ceremonial occasions. Indeed, funeral processions throughout West Africa, whether they use brass bands or percussion ensembles or both, are primary sites for the often very public transformation of grief and trauma into survival and future life, which accompanies the spiritual transition of the departed. In their music, the Eyo’nlé Brass Band places the focus explicitly on the sense of joy that brass instruments can convey. Eyo’nlé’s name means “Rejoice on earth” in Yoruba. Rock Ahouandjinou made the association with traditional ritual contexts that channel this spirit of joy:\n\nIn Africa, in Benin, especially in the [vòdún] couvents, you have joy. When an adept comes into the couvent [temple], it’s joy. They dance, they celebrate. It’s very animated. . . . And for the coming out, it’s joy again, when you come out of the couvent, the day, the end of your ceremonies, it’s another kind of joy, and different music. . . . This is to explain that in our tradition, it’s joy. And Eyo’nlé tries to show that the sun of Africa, of Africa’s culture, is in Benin. All the richness of Benin is in the culture. We don’t have resources, nothing, but we have an immensely rich culture. (Porto Novo, interview, 3/1/15)\n\nLike the Gangbé Brass Band, for the past few decades the Eyo’nlé Brass Band has been engaged in healing, entrepreneurial projects that seek to valorize their musical and spiritual traditions abroad while maintaining connections to liveness and livelihood. The groups differ, though, in subtle but significant ways—in their business strategies, their musical aesthetics, their spiritual orientations, and their approaches to representing music and ethnicity. Eyo’nlé, for example, represents a more localized vision of Beninese music based in Porto Novo in contrast with Gangbé’s project of national representation. Eyo’nlé’s members Page 152 →also selectively collaborate with French musicians, articulate relationships with French and Afro-diasporic music cultures, and occupy space as legal residents of France. Through these approaches, Eyo’nlé shows that there are many different paths through postcolonial healing, whether through nationalism or ethnic particularity, vòdún or Afro-Christianity, collaboration and contestation, rootedness or mobility. Healing the wounds of colonization continues to demand that these musicians separate themselves from former colonizers’ ideologies of modernity and secularism. Frequently, though, this separation leads to a transformation that recasts European influences and colonial histories through the lens of Beninese conceptions of wealth, diaspora, and spirituality, which is particularly clear in Eyo’nlé’s music. What remains constant for all of these musicians is the urgency of maintaining the liveness of these traditions—their continued, dynamic, and creative life and connections to ancestral practices—and making livelihood for themselves and their families.\n\nEyo’nlé’s project suggests a few important things about the nature and challenges of postcolonial healing processes through music, particularly when it comes to cross-cultural connections and mobility. Eyo’nlé has confronted these challenges by emphasizing, for example, that they define themselves through musical and personal relationships with music and musicians abroad, and that they must be free to move internationally in pursuit of their work. They have also made choices in their career that have allowed them even greater agency in their self-representations than Gangbé has, such as managing themselves exclusively, actively cultivating themselves as independent entrepreneurs, prioritizing their live performances over recordings, and protecting certain aspects of their traditions from foreign audiences. I will explore each of these strategies through an examination of Eyo’nlé’s music and professional path.\n\nWhile Gangbé’s project has been one of representing Benin’s cultural diversity on a national scale, through research and self-study of vòdún and other traditions, Eyo’nlé has kept their focus on the members’ own local musical traditions from the Gun, Torri, and Nago cultural areas in and around Porto Novo—the areas whose populations were targeted by Dànxɔmɛ’s slave raids and sometimes succeeded in escaping and founding independent settlements. The people in these areas have also developed specific spiritual and musical traditions that are distinct from the royal traditions of Dànxɔmɛ or the royal court of Xɔgbónu in Porto Novo. This is especially true in the blending of independent Christian traditions like the Celestial Church of Christ and founder Samuel Oshoffa’s ahwangbahun style with the new, postwar vòdún practices like Mami Wata and vòdún Tron, typically worshipped with styles like elezo, Page 153 →a form of highlife found in Benin and Togo. Thus, while the market may put pressure on groups like Eyo’nlé to bend their representations to accommodate a narrow idea of Beninese nationalism or generalized pan-Africanism, as a group they have chosen to represent themselves and the music they know best, the music of resistance to slavery, which serves as a counter to dominant Fon- and Dànxɔmɛ-centric narratives about Benin.\n\nLike Gangbé, the members of Eyo’nlé, many of them born in the 1970s and ’80s, sit at the fulcrum of dramatic processes of cultural change. Many of their parents were born into vòdún traditions and converted to Christianity later, and so the sounds of worship for the Yoruba deity Shango or the kàkà rhythms for the zàngbétɔ masks continue to resonate in the lived memories and experiences of these musicians, even if they are equally familiar with Celestial Christian music and liturgy. Eyo’nlé has paired this emphasis on African locality and particularity with explorations with French- and Roma-inspired brass bands and more blues-oriented “trad-jazz” styles from New Orleans (in contrast to Gangbé’s more modern or avant-garde jazz sensibilities). In making these diasporic and cross-cultural connections more personal, localized, and individual, Eyo’nlé has had some success with resisting the pressures to create homogeneous collective representations of Benin, Africa, or black diasporic music in general.\n\nEyo’nlé, which arrived on the international scene in 2008, several years after Gangbé, made the choice to emphasize specific local references that reflect the experiences of its members: rhythms from their home of Porto Novo, standard Beninese funeral band or fanfare instrumentation (bass drum and snare drum rather than traditional percussion), as well as references to France and New Orleans. Eyo’nlé’s experience also shows that their cultivation of outside repertoires has not diminished the value of their music, but has instead opened new opportunities for them. As with many of these groups, cultural exchange seems to renew or productively to transform traditions rather than to destroy them. The spirituality that Eyo’nlé foregrounds is an Afro-Christian one, rooted in the music and liturgies of independent African churches like the Church of Celestial Christianity and Afro-diasporic Christianity, but one that makes traditional Beninese forms of wealth in people, culture, and community central to its expressive outlook, as they make clear in their song “Do Ré Mi” (see below).\n\nBalancing the goals of transforming and valorizing traditions to gain recognition and make a living, on the one hand, and protecting insider cultural knowledge, on the other, has required Eyo’nlé to develop some innovative techniques. Some of their strategies, like the use of brass instrumental features, a focus on improvised solos, blues forms, and lyrics in French and English, Page 154 →constitute a “public transcript” legible (and audible) to a general, global audience; others, like the adaptation of rhythms with traditional spiritual and ethnic associations and lyrics in the local languages of Fon and Gun, form coded, “hidden transcripts,” as political scientist James C. Scott (1990) refers to forms of resistance that are, for the most part, hidden from those in power. These public and hidden transcripts often coexist within a single song and address power relations both internationally and locally. What is hidden and what is public are contingent on the different kinds of knowledge that are available to individual listeners and segments of the bands’ audiences.\n\nThe Eyo’nlé Brass Band, founded in 1998 in Porto Novo by trumpeter Mathieu Ahouandjinou, began as a fanfare (local brass band) that played for funerals, and gradually expanded to become a project that emphasized traditional rhythms, which the band’s members felt that young people were neglecting in their preferences for foreign music (Mathieu Ahouandjinou, Porto Novo, 3/6/15). Through a collaboration with the established French-Armenian folk band Les Ogres de Barback, Eyo’nlé began traveling to Europe in 2008 and in 2014 joined les Ogres on their twentieth anniversary tour.1 After many years of performing together, the two groups developed a common repertoire that drew from both Beninese and French folk traditions (both classic chansons and street theater and circus repertoires) and the wide-ranging, multi-instrumental expertise of both ensembles’ members.\n\nEyo’nlé’s 2014 tour with les Ogres set them up with an expansive network of venues and local promoters that they utilize to self-manage their booking each year. Eyo’nlé has never worked with a production company or a manager from outside the group, although they do employ an administrator under their direction who organizes their bookings. Sousaphonist Rock Ahouandjinou (Mathieu’s brother, and one of my research assistants) is in charge of the band’s booking and logistical arrangements. Eyo’nlé works extremely hard, often playing several weeks of one-night engagements stretching from France to Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland, with long drives in between. Their connections with festivals and promoters are close, personal, and long-standing. In 2015, Eyo’nlé obtained permanent residency status in France with support of several local officials, and spend most of the year there working while returning occasionally to Benin, as Rock explained:\n\nWe started all alone, without a manager. We did our negotiations on our own, I did the festivals in Benin, and Mathieu sent out the materials. So in France we met people who wanted to work with us, but who always Page 155 →ripped us off. We are lucky in that the organizers prefer to talk with the artists rather than the managers. So we have a thick address book that lets us monopolize everything. It’s true, there are managers who impose things on musicians. And we’ve been on the market for managers many times to sell, and we never appreciated the expressions we heard: “Where did you find that?” [talking about a musician or a group]. We are not a product. And we revolted and really realized what was going on because we had les Ogres de Barback behind us.\n\nThey helped us to understand that the manager works for us, we don’t work for them. So we say what we want, and it’s his job to go out and find it for us. Because what they want to sell there, we are the ones who create it. Because we know the market, and that’s what we have worked for. We know that it’s accessible to the market and it will sell. So we gather everything we deserve so that we can head in the right direction. That’s the battle we are fighting today. (Rock Ahouandjinou, phone interview, 6/29/21)\n\nEyo’nlé collaborations with French groups like Les Ogres have left a lasting musical impression, most significantly in the Beninese group’s intimacy and comfort with French popular song and their experienced study of how to work a European audience. They have become adept at facilitating audience participation through singing, especially with the more familiar French songs in their repertoire, like Serge Gainsbourg’s “Le Poinçonneur de Lilas” (The Ticket Puncher at Lilas Station) and “Le Temps Ne Fait Rien à L’Affaire” (Time Doesn’t Change Anything), both on their Empreinte du Père (2015).\n\nI witnessed one culmination of this skill set in Eyo’nlé’s 2018 program on tour in France, called “Valse à Cotonou,” a project that seeks to make Beninese rhythms more accessible to French audiences by presenting the rhythms’ most essential aspects in arrangements of well-known French chansons.2 Rock Ahouandjinou pointed out that the “Valse,” the waltz, is in 3/4 time, which makes it a natural fit for many of Benin’s ternary rhythms. While they experienced a unique synergy with the flexible multi-instrumentalists in les Ogres, Rock said that Eyo’nlé has often encountered challenges in collaborating with French musicians:\n\nThe problem is that [foreigners] don’t understand Beninese music. There is too much information. They try to play it and learn it, and they cannot. There are too many rhythms. So that is the work we are trying to do for the music of Benin. To make it identifiable, so that when you hear it, it’s easy to Page 156 →hear, it’s easy to learn. There is also the fact that our music doesn’t have an identifiable sound, like mbalax in Senegal. I think traditional music in Mali is a bit like ours in that outside audiences will not necessarily understand it, but they have done some work to make it accessible for everyone.\n\nWe thought about this for a long time, what to do, because we have this question often from professors at French conservatories, they are not able to play our music, to find themselves in it. They find that what we are doing is rich and beautiful, but they are not able to copy it. Take the fanfare. We play fanfare with bass drum and snare drum. Even these two rhythmic instruments already bring a lot of elements. It’s not light [i.e., it is heavy with complexity]. So it’s because of all that that we have thought and thought and thought. . . .\n\nNow we’re starting this project Valse à Cotonou, to, how to say it, to do this conception of rhythms from our home in Benin. And when we’re well settled in it, we can put out something palatable. . . . So we have this work to do about rhythms from Benin, so now people are starting to understand a bit. (Rock Ahouandjinou, phone interview, 6/29/21)\n\nIt is significant that Eyo’nlé’s project of transforming Beninese rhythms to be more accessible to French audiences is taking place primarily through live performance, rather than through new recordings. While Eyo’nlé is proud of their two albums, Rock maintained that their live performances are much more at the heart of the group’s mission: “We make albums because we need to have them, but the live show, that’s where we do the work” (personal communication, Annemasse, France, 8/6/16). Putting more emphasis on their live shows enables Eyo’nlé to adapt to their audiences in real time, and to keep in touch with the essential qualities of liveness in their traditions.\n\nAnother of Eyo’nlé’s choices was to keep the use of the bass drum and snare drum. Gangbé’s strategy has been to use local percussion, using eclectic kits of adapted kpezin drums, along with calabash, bell, and hi-hat. Eyo’nlé’s bass drum player Bonito Assogbah does occasionally play kpawhle and gbon talking drum, but more often the group grounds the diverse local rhythms in their repertoire entirely through the subtleties of Christian Ahouandjinou’s snare drum grooves, which must capture the interlocking patterns of up to six different drum parts on different parts of the snare drum. The result is something resembling an undulating New Orleans second-line groove, sputtering and kicking, starting and restarting, never the same from one moment to the next. You can Page 157 →hear this in a track like “African Brass Music,” which is in elezo style, a kind of highlife from Togo and southwestern Benin.\n\nEyo’nlé took the approach of representing primarily the traditions they know from Porto Novo and the surrounding area. This includes the rhythms of Gun, Toffinou, and Nago-Yoruba cultures, as well as their modernized forms as they are performed at celebrations and in the Celestial Church of Christ. Rock Ahounandjinou (Porto Novo, 3/1/15) explained that the group took very seriously some advice from his father, Henri, the director of the national gendarmerie orchestra who passed away in 2006:\n\n[Our father] told us, it’s easy to come up, but it is difficult to stay. Because when you advance in Beninese traditional music, when you go out to the West, they will try to change it [de la denaturer]. . . . Don’t ever let them. . . . If the person came to look for you, it’s because he likes it. . . . Play your music, stay with your concept.\n\nThe tradition, the culture, African Beninese music, that’s your identity. When you go to play, they will say the lines [courbes] are strange. . . . Don’t ever change it, because that is your wealth. . . . And it was on this advice that we made our motto, “feet in the tradition, head in the modern.” Whatever we do, we will have our feet in the tradition. We can use modern instruments, but you have to feel the tradition.\n\nBy remaining independent, collaborating with supportive European musicians like les Ogres, and staying close to their foundational musical conception, Eyo’nlé carved out a space for themselves to learn from the experience of Gangbé and other African musicians, and to keep producing their music the way they wanted to. This has demanded more labor from the group’s members as they take on various roles of promoting and managing the band, but it pays them back in creative control.\n\nEmpreinte du Père\n\nThe specifically Porto Novian cultural context comes across strongly on Eyo’nlé’s 2015 album Empreinte du Père, an homage to the Ahouandjinou brothers’ father, Henri. The album is distributed on the world music label Irfan, but was self-produced by Eyo’nlé and recorded in one day in Cotonou with no Page 158 →overdubs. Empreinte du Père’s sixteen tracks are filled with the sounds of Porto Novo’s fanfares, churches, and popular rhythms. There are the rhythms of the Celestial Church of Christ like the church’s founder Samuel Oshoffa’s ahwangbahun (battle rhythm), and several kàkà tracks, which are associated with the Toffinou people in the Oueme Valley surrounding Porto Novo and zàngbétɔ masking societies (Rock Ahouandjinou, Annemasse, France, 8/6/16). Other tracks pay tribute to the band’s local influences in compositions by the Porto Novian singer Yedenou Adjahoui, who was known for creating the rhythm massɛ gòhún and delivering particularly beautiful, virtuosic vocals in the poetic register of the local Gun language. There is a Fela Kuti tribute with Eyo’nlé’s intricate arrangement of “Water No Get Enemy.”\n\nAside from these local references, the strongest sounds on the album come from Eyo’nlé’s grounding in blues forms and aesthetics, particularly in Mathieu Ahouandjinou’s trumpet playing and arranging and Jean Ahouandjinou’s vocals. The band’s members combine this blues expressivity with specific spiritual and musical connections. Examples include the blues piece “Houngan” (the term for a head vòdún priest) and “Caïman,” the French word for “crocodile,” Henri Ahouandjinou’s nickname,3 which draws on a mix of ahwangbahun and highlife/elezo that one might hear performed for the contemporary Page 159 →vòdún of the ocean, Mami Wata in Benin’s coastal communities to the southwest. Then there is “Yeye We,” a blues-oriented Celestial Church of Christ song in the Yoruba rhythm of efe from the town of Adjarra outside of Porto Novo, sometimes performed for the orisa Shango. Lastly, there is “Cargos Blues,” a particularly rich piece that I will analyze in further detail to bring out its connections to African and Afro-diasporic spiritual economies through the blues.\n\n“Cargos Blues”\n\nAcross cultures, the blues has for a long time been a site of working through trauma and healing, a ritual function that jazz frequently embodies, too. Eyo’nlé’s piece “Cargos Blues” exemplifies this well.4 This composition in massɛ gòhún style sung by lead vocalist and trombonist Jean Ahouandjinou brings out the ternary feel of a slow blues in a tribute to the cargos, the heavily laden motorbikes that transport gazoil (low quality gasoline) throughout Benin and Nigeria. The piece brings to the fore the band’s explicit representation of its place in the musical African diaspora. A twelve-bar blues, the song plays on European audiences’ expectations of African and African American performance styles, all over a slow, 12/8 massɛ gòhún groove. The vocal is delivered in French in Jean Ahouandjinou’s powerful, gravelly timbre. Behind Jean, the backup vocals in Gun overlay sacred and secular black traditions in a gospel-inflected chorus, bringing back reminders of God’s faithfulness in the midst of hardship, and suggesting that this spiritual connection has long been a part of the core characteristics of the blues.\n\nPage 161 →There are two slightly different takes on the same story going on in this song, one in French and one in Gun. The French lyrics bring Eyo’nlé’s diasporic vision, including connections to specific Beninese rhythmic styles like massɛ and gogohun, into the public sphere, and are accessible to Francophone audiences in Europe and in the diaspora. This enacts the part of the postcolonial healing process that insists on recognition for the value of African culture where such value was denied in the past, and in this case connects it directly to diasporic relationships. So another part of the healing process is private, reserved for insiders; the Gun lyrics keep this part of the transcript hidden from these audiences, particularly its sacred aspect. Each time the backup singers repeat the line, “Jɛ tɛ kɛ mi gbòn adousí gbòn amion (mɛ), mílɛ kpòtò messíya sín awa mɛ,” meaning “Even if they talk about me left and right, we are in the arms of the Lord God,”5 Jean Ahouandjinou picks it up and weaves it into his improvised response, leading into the next line of text in French. In doing this, he brings his blues lyricism tosgether with the gospel chorus, showing their unity, the presence of the sacred in the history of the blues, and the presence of the hidden transcript in the public.\n\nAnother aspect of “Cargos Blues” that likely escapes an audience of outsiders, despite its explicit mention in the lyrics, is the rhythm of màssɛ gòhún. This style was created by the beloved Porto Novian singer Yedenou Adjahoui6 in the 1970s, based on the much older ceremonial Xɔgbónu court style of djègbè. Djègbè originally used only two bells and the shekere (shaker) to accompany vocalists, but Adjahoui added the small alekele drums, and borrowed the lead drum kpèzín from the style of zɛnlí to create màssɛ gòhún (see singer Anice Pepe’s account of this transition in Agoïnon 2013). Today, there are many traditional ensembles devoted exclusively to màssɛ gòhún, whose slow and dignified triple feel is popular for life ceremonies like funerals and weddings. Here is the màssɛ gòhún groove I recorded from the group Djidjoho Nissou, led by Adjiton Hanbladji (Cotonou, 1/17/15).\n\nPage 162 →Eyo’nlé represent their version of màssɛ gòhún using reduced instrumentation: a bell, a snare drum, and a bass drum, keeping the military-style instrumentation common in Benin’s fanfares. The snare drummer Chretien Ahouandjinou plays a triplet pattern, alternating between the rim and the head of the drum, while the bass drummer Bonito Assogbah plays the role of the lead drummer, improvising periodically behind the vocalist and using his left hand to manipulate the timbre of the drum. Here is Eyo’nlé’s basic massɛ groove.\n\nThat Eyo’nlé would point to màssɛ gòhún as an antecedent or analog form of the blues is provocative.7 Eyo’nlé’s international version of massɛ is dramatically reduced compared to its present-day expression in ensembles in Benin. Massɛ as such did not exist during the slave trade prior to its creation and popularization by Adjahoui in the 1970s, except maybe in its predecessors like djègbè. But part of the argument that Eyo’nlé lays out in the lyrics to “Cargos Blues” is that “Le blues a suivi des transformations,” that is, it went through changes in the course of its diasporic journey, just as music in Africa has over time, in order to stay fully alive.\n\nIn this sense, màssɛ gòhún is a lot like the blues—not only in its formal properties and slow triplet feel—but in its relationship to a pragmatic spirituality, and the music’s ability to invoke this religious power, whether through Christianity or vòdún, to overcome the worst of circumstances. The blues and màssɛ gòhún are all about transformations, the ongoing “modernization” of traditions, and transcendence—changing bad situations for the better. Albert Murray, who wrote Stomping the Blues (1976), understood this definitively homeopathic quality of the blues, that it is, at its core, “equipment for living” (see Murray 2016).8 If the blues is equipment for living, a tool, a technique, then perhaps the healing spiritual technologies of vòdún are as well.\n\nEyo’nlé sees the blues as an example of what Beninese music can do if it can adapt to changing conditions and make use of the strength of its traditions. Explicitly invoking blues references also allows the group to argue for their membership in the Afro-modernity of the diaspora. But even as Eyo’nlé searches for common musical ground, they protect certain traditional religious aspects of their presentation for insiders in coming in and out of their local Page 163 →language. “Cargos Blues” keeps spiritual experience protected in the Gun-language background vocals. Although Eyo’nlé’s spiritual language—“we are in the arms of the Lord God”—is Christian-oriented rather than vòdún-oriented, it is still reserved through the Gun language for cultural insiders. The message hidden in the margins of the blues story is one of hope and solidarity: that no matter what happens, African people and their descendants will pull through; God did not fail their ancestors, nor will he fail them in the present. This is because of the strength of transformative traditions like the blues and other rituals to heal and to create and sustain new life.\n\nAccording to Rock Ahouandjinou (Annemasse, France, 8/6/16), the title of “Cargos Blues” is a reference to the cargos, that carry gazoil back and forth across the coast of Benin to and from Nigeria. These containers are the subject and material of many artworks by the Beninese artist Romuald Hazoumé (see fig. 6). The cargos vehicles, weighed down with overspilling gasoline canisters, often explode violently during traffic accidents, making the discarded containers a ubiquitous and haunting site along Benin’s roadways.\n\nHazoumé uses these gasoline containers centrally in his work, styling them Page 164 →as various types of African masks, to represent the economic, spiritual, and human costs of the slave trade and the ways in which its legacy is ever present and material in Benin’s postcolonial present. This is particularly evident in his 2005 installation “La Bouche du Roi” (The Mouth of the King) for the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery, in which he arranges dozens of these containers into the shape of a slave ship, accompanied by video of the cargos motorbikes transporting gasoline, audio of names in local languages heard from beneath the masks, and video of egúngún mask performance (see fig. 7).9 By giving the containers individual characteristics, Hazoumé’s work rehumanizes them, reconnects them with their spiritual nature. The masks are humans and spirits, present and past. While giving a visitor a tour of his Porto Novo studio, which is filled with these jerry cans, in the documentary High on the Hog, Hazoumé says, “what is very important here is how we survive” (Wash 2021).\n\nPage 165 →This reference to the cargos in Eyo’nlé’s “Cargos Blues,” along with its lyrical references to the blues and the slave trade, ties this song into intraregional networks of trade, linking cultural, spiritual, and material economy, which are themselves implicated in global networks of domination through Nigeria’s oil politics and its impacts on Benin. The song tells the story of transformation, of survival, through a blend of French and Gun lyrics that continue to enact this process of making life and livelihood through music and ritual. These connections likely escape most of Eyo’nlé’s European audiences, but add layers of complexity and depth to the song’s historical resonances and are key to understanding its blues-oriented power for healing.\n\n“Do Ré Mi”\n\nIn Eyo’nlé’s “Do Ré Mi,” a djègbè composition from Empreinte du Père, the group shows how central professionalization and economic success are to their healing creative projects, even as they stay in touch with Afro-Christian and traditional spiritual principles.10 This song addresses local skeptics of brass band musicians’ way of life by laying out an explicit argument in Gun for the viability of music as a profession, defined according to middle-class values of community, wealth, family, and Afro-Christianity. Here Eyo’nlé articulates a vision of the brass band as a source of economic and artistic support, as well as a safe space for enacting the members’ spiritual and material healing projects. The focus here being all on the message, the accompaniment is minimal, the two characteristic djègbè bell parts punctuated periodically by handclaps and onomatopeic vocal play. Djègbè is a style deployed at funerals and other ceremonies depending on the moment in the liturgy. It was originally a style of the royal court in Xɔgbónu, and it is the style that Yedenou Adjahoui transformed into his famous massɛ gòhún (Rock Ahouandjinou, Annemasse, France, 8/6/16). At over eight minutes, “Do Ré Mi” is the longest piece on the album, and covers a great deal of thematic ground.\n\nEyo’nlé lays this text out over the texture of djègbè style, invoking its respectable court and independent church associations for their intended audience of conservative Beninese listeners. This is clearly an insider conversation, and I have not heard Eyo’nlé perform this piece abroad. This suggests that some of the healing process, perhaps especially conversations about economics and status within African communities, needs to remain in the hidden transcript in order to do its job, in order to facilitate those conversations in a protected space. My translating this song from Gun and Torri, while conducted in collaboration with Rock Ahouandjinou and Saturnin Tomeho, is in some ways a transgressive act, but it reveals so much about the linkedness of economics and spirituality in postcolonial healing processes, which would not be as clear without this insight.\n\nEyo’nlé makes the argument for the professionalization of their art through traditional definitions of success, particularly through the image of the avɔ, the ceremonial wrap or cloth that people don in moments of celebration to show their status. The lyrics make the case for the fanfare itself as an avɔ, a pagne or wrap that covers a person, honoring him and showing his status. This outlines a concept of wealth based in the fanfare as an association that defines a person’s community and his identity as a successful member of society. Although the wealth of this association may be immaterial, the group also points to the material successes that their work has afforded them, allowing them to buy cars and land and to care for their families.\n\nThe message of “Do Ré Mi” speaks to Eyo’nlé’s orientation toward business strategies and cultural aesthetics, which carve out a middle way that makes value with African traditions while still respecting their views about wealth and community. While material profit is one aspect of Eyo’nlé’s mission, and one key component of the postcolonial healing process, this song reveals that their project also entails the invocation of alternative forms of wealth, either as Page 171 →means to other ends or as ends in themselves. One of these alternative forms of wealth may be defined through the immaterial connections that musicians create between people—these connections being a form of investment or wealth storage, a kind of “wealth in people.”12\n\nIn “Do Ré Mi,” Eyo’nlé creates a moment of self-conscious reflection on their craft as musicians and their spiritual and economic projects. They seek to extend traditionally rooted, middle-class status—itself constructed through colonial histories—to the brass band tradition in Benin. They defend their artistic practice against critics who associate their work with vòdún or witchcraft by declaring their faith in Jesus Christ, and against those who argue that music is not a real job by outlining its material benefits for the welfare of their families, lyrically arguing for their membership in a prosperous, respectable Christian evolué class, it bears mentioning, by accepting its standards for legitimacy. For those who are skeptical of brass bands because they represent foreign influence, Eyo’nlé argues lyrically and sonically for their place within the tradition as a community of individuals seeking livelihood: through the imagery of avɔ (the traditional cloth) and gigɔ (the honor, weight, or greatness of a person), and through a djègbè texture that places the song within a village context outside of Porto Novo. They assert in the Torri language, Ago se na fanfare ján míɛ xò dó ɖúnú, “Get out of my way, the fanfare is what feeds us” (lit. what buys us food).\n\nEyo’nlé’s arguments about materiality speak to the definitions and expectations of professional success in Benin, which Gangbé’s trumpeter Athanase Dehoumon (Bouchemaine, France, 6/5/14) observed:\n\nThe local audience, the Béninois audience likes the group, too, it’s just . . . the status that our group has, people think that we are not well housed. In principle, Gangbé with its status, should have a big place, big vehicles, big planes, private jet, and everything. But that’s not our primary objective. You have to build a career first. In Benin, people don’t have this idea. What can you build in your career? People don’t know. For them, you make music, and people enjoy it, and it stops there. To build a career.\n\nPage 172 → who support us, who come to help put these infrastructures in place. So that’s why I say that the Western audience enjoys and always asks for more, and the Béninois audience is unsatisfied. They are waiting to see us sitting in a big house to see things. But we are hoping to get there one day.\n\nThe Beninese audience in Athanase’s telling may seem overly influenced by the individualism and materialism of the “prosperity gospel” that is widespread across evangelical and independent Christian churches, and in new vòdún communities in Benin, or of capitalism in general. But they are also pragmatically observing the economic realities and global dynamics of the exchange, and their integral place in healing and rectifying economic inequalities. Bands like Gangbé and Eyo’nlé perfect and polish their performances to a high level and travel abroad to represent Benin and its music traditions, but business conditions are such that their product does not yield the value that audiences at home think that it should have. European audiences, according to Athanase, are content to consume and enjoy the bands’ products and performances, while Beninese audiences do not recognize the endeavor as successful unless it accumulates visible wealth.\n\nWhile “Do Ré Mi” is clearly intended for a local audience, in their other music Eyo’nlé has done a great deal of work to make their music accessible to outsider audiences, intentionally singing in French and even sometimes in English, transforming Beninese rhythms to make them more understandable for European audiences, and emphasizing instrumental solos that do not need to be translated. On Empreinte du Père, “Do Ré Mi” comes immediately after “African Brass Music,” a bright, brassy highlife composition by Rock Ahouandjinou that is the most externally oriented of Eyo’nlé’s recorded pieces. “African Brass Music” presents a simplified version of their mission in English to international audiences, a public transcript for the insider narrative outlined elsewhere:\n\n“African Brass Music” is set in an upbeat, generic highlife feel (elezo in Benin’s terminology), further emphasizing its outward looking invitations to familiarity. Eyo’nlé performs “African Brass Music” on their live set in Europe, often as an opening or closing piece.\n\nPage 173 →•••\n\nIn their projects of postcolonial healing, Eyo’nlé has learned to negotiate the complexities and demands of their different audiences. Local listeners in Benin expect their music to be legitimized spiritually and economically, while for foreign audiences Eyo’nlé needs to translate and transform their music strategically in ways that allow some of its meaning to transfer and be valorized in a different context. Eyo’nlé’s musical strategies suggest that postcolonial healing processes cannot take place in individual or ethnocentric isolation, but instead require the participation of both Beninese listeners and European listeners in valorizing these traditions and this project, and that they may ultimately need to work together to make this happen. Eyo’nlé suggests that postcolonial healing processes need to make Europeans a part of the process, need to teach them how to participate in these transformations of form and value, how to apply these musical medicines, even as the Eyo’nlé musicians protect parts of their experience for cultural insiders in local languages and spiritual references. They keep these parts of the tradition and of their healing work private.\n\nThere are many lessons to take from Eyo’nlé’s career thus far. The band’s professional path reveals the important place of movement and migration for making their healing projects possible; essentially, they need to be able to move freely in the world to make this work happen, which their permanent residency status in France facilitates. Their emphasis on the local Gun, Torri, and Yoruba traditions of Porto Novo shows that musical, spiritual, and economic healing does not necessarily have to bend to the exigencies of nationalism or monolithic depictions of African culture, but can stay in touch with individuality and multiplicity. For Eyo’nlé ethnic difference is not necessarily “ethnic conflict.” Eyo’nlé has found that preserving survival, livelihood, and liveness cannot take place in isolation or separation, but must occur in contexts of constant connection that reforge international connections with communities abroad, making their healing project one that calls for global participation while holding space for individual difference. They extend this call to Afro-diasporic communities whose traumas are ongoingly reenacted in music like the blues, as well as to former colonizers, insisting that their accountability and participation in the healing of their own traumas are essential to the larger project of trying to move forward, together, into a more connected way of being."
