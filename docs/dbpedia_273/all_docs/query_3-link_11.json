        "text": "When EuroDisneyland opened in April of 1992, Euro media types gave the themepark a decided thumbs-down.\n\nBut 10 years later, the park is flourishing, drawing over 12 million visitors a year and as many as 45,000 a day in summer.\n\nNow with the opening of the new Walt Disney Studios Park on March 16, Disney hopes to add another 5 million folks per annum.\n\nThe new venue occupies a large chunk of former beet fields adjacent to Disneyland Paris, making the Disney experience extensive enough to warrant at least one night in a hotel on the grounds.\n\nChastened by criticism about being “too American” a decade ago, park architects and imagineers bent over backwards to give Euro pic and TV innovators their due.\n\nWhen voiceovers are called for, the commentary is delivered by distinguished native speakers of English (Jeremy Irons), French (Irene Jacob), Italian (Isabella Rossellini), Spanish (Ines Sastre), Dutch (Famke Janssen) and German (Nastassja Kinski).\n\nIn addition to drafting champion stuntmen for a live-action extravaganza, Remy Julienne — the ranking stunt-creator in France, with over 1,200 movies to his credit, — hired daredevil Euro athletes to do feats of derring-do with cars, motorcycles and jet-skis.\n\nPark also features the fastest roller coaster ever built by Disney — going from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in 2.8 seconds."
