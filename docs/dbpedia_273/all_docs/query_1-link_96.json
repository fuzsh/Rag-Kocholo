He won the Spotlight Award Scholarship, a prize lauded by all in the land, and balanced a 3.92 GPA, all while training rigorously with Adria Wilson, Oui Geometer Dance Company, and the modern dance godmotherLula Washington. As a teen Mrs. Washington saw the potential for greatness and ushered Jamal into her adult company, the Lula Washington Dance Theatre, where the seeds of integrity were planted into the phenomenal story that is Jamal’s life, love and pursuit of dance.

He participated in many years of training in diverse dance techniques and has since become invested in teaching and facilitating dance and movement classes around the country. While Santikaro is grateful for his thorough training and full career in the dance industry as a dancer and choreographer for music videos, tours, commercials, TV shows, films, dance companies, and industrials, he has spent years learning to integrate those formative experiences into the larger tapestry of living a purposeful, meaningful, authentic life.
