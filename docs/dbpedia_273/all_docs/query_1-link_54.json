        "text": "Join Villa Albertine for a panel discussion and champagne toast to celebrate the start of Oui Design! The panel will be moderated by design historian and educator Alexa Griffith Winton, in conversation with French designer Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance; current Villa Albertine craft and design resident Jean-Marc Bullet; and New York based multidisciplinary artist Terumi Saito. Together, they will explore the relationship a designer can build with a territory, looking at how they each engage with the specificities of a cultural, social, and natural context, ranging from resources to the traditional know-how, the communities and the spiritual beliefs that characterize it.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nAlexa Griffith Winton is a design historian and writer specializing in the visual and material culture of the last century. Her research engages issues of craft in the industrial and computer ages, the role of technology in modern domestic design, and the theorization of the domestic interior. She is currently Manager, Content + Curriculum at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, where she co-curated with Susan Brown the exhibition “A Dark, A Light, A Bright: The Designs of Dorothy Liebes” in 2023.\n\nNoé Duchaufour-Lawrance is a multidisciplinary French designer, well known for his sensitive attention to materials and details, as well as for the refinement of his organic forms. The duality between artistic vision and meticulous rigour, nature and the city, functionality and emotion flows seamlessly through his projects, whether in interior architecture or in the design of furniture or objects, but also tailor-made for private clients or cultural institutions such as the Villa Medici. In order to reconnect with nature and weave a sensitive link between man and his environment, he chose to move to Lisbon in 2017. From this immersion was born the Made in Situ project, which explores, through the prism of the designer’s eyes, a variety of territories, geological, artisanal, economic and cultural. A travel diary that can only be extended, in France or elsewhere.\n\nJean-Marc Bullet is a French industrial design-artist based in Martinique, where he teaches design at the Campus Caraïbéen des Arts. Just graduated from the ENSCI- Les Ateliers, École Nationale Supérieure de Création Industrielle in Paris, he founded the agency Bullet&Associés in 2012. Interested in the link between his Afro-Caribbean identity and his craft, he researches the ways in which objects can be understood as an expression of the social bonds between humans and their environment. He will be in New York until June to take part in the 2024 Villa Albertine Residency, presented in partnership with Industry City + WantedDesign and ENSCI- Les Ateliers, and supported by the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation. His research project is focused on building a dialogue with NYC designers from the African diaspora around the meaning of black design, providing him with the source material for a podcast series on the links between cultural heritage, personal history, and design practices.\n\nTerumi Saito is a Japanese artist and designer primarily working in fiber art and sculpture. Saito is best known for her backstrap weaving sculptures, in which her approach combines traditional and ancient backstrap weaving techniques, the use of natural dyes, fibers, and clay, and a meticulous, labor-intensive weaving process. Backstrap weaving is one of the earliest weaving techniques, and it has a rich history in Asia and Central and South America. Saito’s artistic endeavors are centered on a dual mission: preserving endangered traditional techniques and shedding new light on them through a contemporary lens. She seeks to bridge the gap between contemporary art and traditional crafts, challenging the conventional perception that fiber arts are relegated to the sidelines of contemporary art. Saito earned her BFA in Graphic Design from Tama Art University in Tokyo, Japan, and her MFA in Textiles from Parsons School of Design in New York. Saito has been a resident artist, including the Museum of Arts and Design (Upcoming), Houston Center for Contemporary Craft, Vermont Studio Center, and Arquetopia International Artist Residency in Urubamba, Peru.\n\nFor the first time, Studio Gohard, under the artistic direction of its newly appointed creative director, Axel Huynh, opens its doors and invites the Spaceless Gallery to exhibit renowned and emerging French artist designers Aurélie Hoegy and aurèce vettier during NYCxDesign Week.\n\nA living heritage company and family-owned for more than 60 years, Ateliers Gohard has been passionately creating exceptional finishes within the high luxury interior decoration world worldwide. On the occasion of NYCxDESIGN Week, Ateliers Gohard opens a new chapter, launching its Studio and interior design brand under the visionary direction of designer Axel Huynh. Former Jean-Paul Gaultier Model, Creative Director, Scenographer, and Emotion Distiller, Axel Huynh’s creative inspiration knows no boundaries. With major signatures of iconic Parisian powerhouses such as Hotel Mona Bismarck, the American Center of Arts in Paris, and La Galerie Bourbon, the autodidact designer leaves a mark on Design & Lifestyle with his singular style. Acclaimed by Architectural Digest for his latest design project for Academy Award-winning actress Hilary Swank and her unique Left Bank Parisian home.\n\nThe inspirations of the designer are endless… Travels, Bauhaus Architecture, and Mineral Vibrations. Axel Huynh’s style is firmly contemporary yet minimal, bringing together the excellence of French and international craft combined with a resolutely avant-garde and functional vision of the modern habitat.\n\nFrom art curation to sourcing for interior designers and private collectors, the Spaceless Gallery is a nomadic art gallery with a global presence in Paris, New York, and Miami. Recent exhibition collaborations include partnerships with prestigious entities such as Bergdorf Goodman, the Invisible Collection in New York, Gilles & Boissier, and Veronese in Paris. Rather than confining itself to conventional gallery spaces, the Spaceless Gallery strives to contextualize art in diverse environments, curating exhibitions that engage with their surroundings. It is with great excitement that the Spaceless Gallery will inaugurate Ateliers Gohard’s gallery space, drawing on Art, Design, Minimalism, and great talent.\n\nAurélie Hoegy captivates with her skillful manipulation of rattan, a material typically overlooked, to produce extraordinary pieces that serve both form and function. Through her innovative approach, she transforms this humble material into something truly exceptional, seamlessly blending natural fibers with contemporary design to achieve a harmonious fusion. Her work is collected among important public and private collections such as the Centre Pompidou and will be exhibited for the first time in New York at l’Ateliers Gohard.\n\naurèce vettier’s ‘Prothèses d’Arbres’ series offers a glimpse into a futuristic realm where craftsmanship meets AI and nature. vettier explores the convergence of nature and technology with unparalleled poetry. Collaborating with Ateliers Gohard, vettier has made for the NYCxDESIGN Week exquisite sculptures infused with the finest guild craftsmanship.\n\nThis exhibition marks a pivotal moment as these recognized French artists make their debut in New York, celebrating the imaginative intersection of art, craftsmanship, and innovation at Ateliers Gohard.\n\nThis exhibition has been supported by Oui Design!, a program of Villa Albertine, Albertine Foundation and Mobilier National, with the support of Institut français.\n\nPhoto: Genevieve Garruppo\n\nOn the occasion of the upcoming edition of Oui Design! as part of NYCxDESIGN, Demisch Danant is proud to welcome back acclaimed French designer, Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance who will present for the second consecutive year a selection of works from Made In Situ, his Paris and Lisbon-based project that advocates for a practice rooted in a given territory, exploring its materials, artisans, craftsmanship and cultural vernacular.\n\nA dynamic examination of the exchange between person and place, Made In Situ is a series of cross-disciplinary works in conversation with nature, feeling, and materiality. For five years, Duchaufour-Lawrance has been living and working between Lisbon and Paris, developing these poetically site-specific collections alongside local artisans and craftspeople. His collections serve as testaments to time spent truly discovering a place, its people, and their history. Inscribed and contextualized, the creations that make up its collections are considered and, hence, more conscious. Each of them does not just tell the story of a place and its inhabitants, it expresses what unites them.\n\nAfter a first standalone Made In Situ exhibition in New York in the fall of 2022 alongside two presentations in Paris at and during Design Miami/ Paris this past October, Demisch Danant and Duchaufour-Lawrance come together again for this showcase, bound by a shared admiration for narrative-driven design and material-forward conception. Highly respected for their meticulous curation of innovative twentieth-century design, Demisch Danant’s presentation of Made In Situ speaks to their respect for the artistry and perspective of Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance, a rare contemporary amongst their roster of historical greats.\n\nOn view at Demisch Danant, Made In Situ by Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance will present works from the collections Azulejos, Bronze & Beeswax, and Chêne & Liège.\n\nJoin French designer Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance for a private tour of his exhibition at Demisch Danant gallery and discover his new project Made in Situ.\n\nA dynamic examination of the exchange between person and place, Made In Situ is a series of cross-disciplinary works in conversation with nature, feeling, and materiality.

The tour, hosted by gallery director Amelia Critzer, will highlight French design and craftsmanship, featuring designers from emerging to established careers, and will delve into traditional French craftsmanship, including the work of the esteemed Ateliers Saint Jacques.\n\nWhile the gallery’s exhibitions program highlights the time-honored techniques behind an objet d’art, its adjoining salons reveal a permanent display of timeless design pieces – bringing together contemporary creations and sought-after pieces culled from the archives. In conjunction, the gallery cultivates the longstanding dialogue between revered ateliers and artists.\n\nEstablished in 2013 by Melanie Courbet, the gallery was born from the desire to share a deep appreciation for master-craftsmen’s ethos and works of art that embody artisanal dexterity and cultural heritage. Rooted in Courbet’s extensive travels and collaborations with artists, designers and artisans around the world, the gallery is a paean to the painstaking work of today’s rarefied master-craftsmen.\n\nSince its opening, Les Ateliers Courbet has garnered international recognition from a clientele of private collectors, interior designers and institutions alike. Today, the gallery represents over 50 traditional crafts passed on by long lineages of esteemed artisans from around the world, including marquetry, woodcraft, ceramic and glasswork, weaving and metalsmithing.\n\nWhile pursuing its mission with exhibitions, institutional collaborations and publications, the gallery further supports its ateliers with the Editions Courbet – a series of editioned pieces created by guest artists and hand-crafted by the gallery’s master-craftsmen. Each artist is invited to design a collection inspired by the craftsmanship expertise of one atelier. As a tribute to the artisans’ culture of excellence and humility, each Editions Courbet collection will be named after their respective fabricators.\n\nGallery hours\n\nTuesday – Saturday 10:00am – 6:00pm\n\nInvisible Collection is the leading online gallery for discovering beautiful designs from the world’s most renowned talents. Our online platform, alongside galleries in Paris, London, New York, and LA, provides access to a unique and curated inventory of bespoke creations, entirely crafted by exceptional artisans, the guardians of a savoir-faire, deeply rooted in the heritage of Arts Décoratifs. By showcasing a new generation of talents who carry forward the legacy of historic French masters, we have established a distinctive French aesthetic that resonates with design enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nOur role in championing the unique savoir-faire that sets France apart has brought us closer to Mobilier national and Chanel’s Métiers d’art de la decoration. Mobilier national, a public institution specializing in the conservation, restoration, and curation of historic and modern state furniture, has entrusted us with a selection of their contemporary design collections. Chanel’s Métiers d’art – the specialty creators housed at le19M, collaborate with us to introduce their fantastic creations to our international clientele. Like our other galleries around the globe, our space in New York’s Upper East Side has acted as home to the best of French design, showcasing renowned AD 100 honorees such as Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance, Laura Gonzalez, and Garcé & Dimofski.\n\nFor this second edition of Oui Design! / NYCxDESIGN Festival, we are introducing Thierry Lemaire, another AD 100 honoree known for his bold yet sophisticated aesthetic. We are thrilled to present his first solo show in the US, giving the opportunity to design enthusiasts to discover a true master of architecture and interior design, who alongside his many projects, has recently refurbished some of the salons of the Elysée Palace including president Emmanuel Macron’s office. In a setting that looks and feels like a collector’s home, Thierry Lemaire’s designs take center stage. Each piece is defined by strong shapes, a reminder of Lemaire’s architectural background, and bold juxtapositions of materials. The curated pieces comprehensively display his eclectic vocabulary, and the thoughtful integration of form and function.\n\nThis exhibition further cements Invisible Collection’s leading role in the luxury design world. The first B-Corp certified company in its industry and the first to offset carbon emissions for transport and delivery, Invisible Collection stands as a community of over 250 artists, decorators, architects, and designers, all brought together on a unique platform, reconciling the old and the new, merging the traditions in decorative arts with innovative digital offerings.\n\nGallery Hours\n\nMonday – Saturday 10:00am – 6:00pm\n\nThe exhibition will be open to the public starting from May 16th.\n\nFor the first time, Studio Gohard, under the artistic direction of its newly appointed creative director, Axel Huynh, opens its doors and invites the Spaceless Gallery to exhibit renowned and emerging French artist designers Aurélie Hoegy and aurèce vettier during NYCxDesign Week.\n\nA living heritage company and family-owned for more than 60 years, Ateliers Gohard has been passionately creating exceptional finishes within the high luxury interior decoration world worldwide.
