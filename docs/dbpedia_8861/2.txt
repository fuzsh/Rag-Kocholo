Oviedo, a 30 minute drive from the port of Gijon, is the capital of the ancient Principality of Asturias. Established in the 8th century, it bravely resisted the Arab invasion of Spain and kept the flame of Christianity alive in the Iberian peninsula. The palaces and churches in the surroundings of Oviedo provide eminent testimony to the civilization of the small Christian Kingdom of Asturias.

On arrival we will start our exploration of the highlights of the city by bus. Much of the center of the old town is a pedestrian quarter and we will visit on foot the Cathedral of "San Salvador". The cathedral is a unique example of different architectural styles, from Pre-Romanesque to Baroque. Founded in 781, most of the present structure dates from the 1380's.

In the surroundings of the Cathedral, we visit other highlights of the old town including the town hall and market and have some free time to browse.

After our visit we will drive back to Gijon to visit a Llagar, a cider factory, where we will be able to sample some of the local cuisine of this unique region of Spain, enhanced by the local cider poured from on high into your glass in the traditional manner. A short panoramic drive through the city of Gijon will take us back to the yacht at the dock.
