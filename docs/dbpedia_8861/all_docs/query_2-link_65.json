        "text": "It's summer in Oviedo! And that means it's time to get out and explore the city and the surrounding area. Visiting its parks, surfing the surrounding beaches, going to the starting point of the Camino de Santiago, hiking and joining the seasonal fiestas and festivals are just some of the best things to do in Oviedo.\n\nWhether you're looking for things to do inside the capital like finding Mafalda, or on the outskirts where you can find the European brown bear, or you can go hiking in the Picos de Europa, here are the top 10 recommendations to have fun during these months.\n\n1. Hiking in the Picos de Europa\n\nIf you're looking for an adrenaline rush, you'll find it here, in the Picos de Europa. When hiking in this park you can not only sit back and enjoy the scenery, but it is also the ideal place for trekking, conquering every peak, crossing valleys, rivers and lakes!\n\nThe route often includes passing the Basilicaof Santa María la Real de Covadonga, the beach of Santa Marina, the Cave of Tito Bustillo, Lastres, the fishing village, the Roman Bridge on the way to Cangas de Onís, just over the river Sella, the Lakes of Covadonga, Gijón and more.\n\nTo do the complete tour of the Picos de Europa, Lagos de Covadonga and Cangas de Onís from Oviedo it is recommended to take a tour, to walk around all the emblematic sites, although you can also get there by bus, car or train, although in this case you will miss the urban hiking.\n\n2. Participate in the Beer Festival in Avilés\n\nThe excursions to Luarca, Cudillero and Avilés from Oviedo are among the most popular and in summer the fiestas and festivals add to the charm of the route.\n\nTo begin with, the second week of August sees the Avilés Beer Festival, the largest beer festival in the Bay of Biscay. For the event, there are various stands with craft beers from Asturias, as well as references to the prized drink and national and international gastronomy.\n\nOn 15 August, the ringing of bells marks the start of the Fiestade San Roque, the patron saint of Oviñana, one of the main parishes of Cudillero. The celebration lasts for a week, beginning with a religious ceremony, followed by open-air dances, musical shows, sporting events, children's games, terraces packed to the rafters and ending with a lively night-time party.\n\nTo end the celebration route, every 21st August at midnight fireworks announce the start of the Festival of San Timoteo in Luarca. Verbenas, bagpipes, games, street theatre, processions... there is something for everyone, a worthy end to a vibrant route.\n\n3. The Way of St. James\n\nAt the end of September, a large group of people decide to follow the Pilgrim's Way to Santiago de Compostela. Their starting point is in Oviedo, birthplace of King Alfonso II, who is considered the first pilgrim since the year 834.\n\nThe route can be followed with a personal map, travelling from village to village until reaching Santiago de Compostela, however, two alternatives that have gained affection are: \"Flavours and History of the \"Primitive Way\" and \"The Way of St. James\":\n\nFlavours and history of the \"Camino Primitivo\" in short version\n\nThe Camino de Santiago covers a route of 20-30 kilometres at each stage so it is challenging and takes several days to complete but if your time is limited and you still want to follow in the footsteps of the Jacobean cult, the Flavours of the Camino tour allows you to walk the first 12 kilometres of the original route, better known as the \"Camino Primitivo\", while reliving the history of the pilgrim as you follow in his footsteps with a local guide.\n\nThe route often passes by Mount Naranco, the Cathedral of San Salvador, the monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, hills, pastures and Asturian forests until you reach a terrace where Oviedo's gastronomy closes the midday excursion.\n\nThe Way of St. James by train from Oviedo\n\nNowadays, the Way of St. James is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and every year thousands of pilgrims join this tradition and in cases where comfort prevails over adventure, it is possible to follow the Pilgrim's Route.\n\nThe route is ideal for those who visit Oviedo in 4 Days: a guidebook for getting the most out of your visit or more to follow the route of the Camino de Santiago. The train passes through Viveiro, Ortigueira, Ferrol and Santiago de Compostela. At all of its stops you have the option of exploring the countryside without worrying about the logistics of the excursion.\n\n4. Kayaking on the Nalón river\n\nReady to take on the river Nalón? In this activity on the outskirts of the Asturian capital, you can kayak on the Nalón River between Las Caldas and Trubia. This is one of the best excursions from Oviedo!\n\nThe trip starts at Puerto de Tarna and ends between San Esteban and L' Arena, where the Pravia estuary is formed. As you paddle along, the wild birds and majestic natural scenery make their mark on the Asturian landscape.\n\nDuring the crossing of the river, you will go through areas of waves, rapids, slides, and backwaters, so you must be attentive to the instructions of the monitor, who indicates the safest way to paddle. It is an exciting experience, it is often done in groups and the combined routes of easy and difficult stretches add adrenaline to the event.\n\n5. Celebrate the feast of San Mateo in Oviedo\n\nThe festival of San Mateo is a big event in Oviedo, the biggest summer festival in the capital. Concerts, beach bars, circus shows, plays and children's games in San Francisco Park are essential parts of this festival which highlights America's Day in Asturias.\n\nTraditionally this two-week festival spans the beginning of the Jubilee of the Holy Cross, through America's Day in Asturias, to the Big Day on 21 September. On this day the pilgrims culminate their request for indulgence during the Día del Bollo with the traditional \"Pisado de la uva\" and Les paxarines -protective amulets-, while enjoying a chorizo bun.\n\nThese fiestas have been taking place for centuries in the streets of Oviedo with a range of leisure activities.\n\n6. Visit the most beautiful beaches in the Principality of Oviedo\n\nThe Asturian coastline is 427 kilometres long and includes some of the most beautiful corners of the Cantabrian Sea. From Oviedo you can easily reach the areas with the best beaches in northern Spain.\n\nCudillero\n\nIn this parish, Playa del Silencio, also known as Gaviero, is a 500 metre walk down a path from the road after a 45 minute drive from Oviedo. The water is turquoise and the landscape is a spectacle to be admired.\n\nLlanes\n\nLlanes is located 1 hour from Oviedo and its marine wealth is so great that three of its beaches are among the best in the Cantabrian Sea. So you can choose between Playa de Gulpiyuri, Playa de Torimbia or Playa de Andrín.\n\nVillaviciosa\n\nA 40 minutes drive away you will find Rodiles Beach, in the middle of theNatural Reserveof the Villaviciosa Estuary, a fascinating meeting place for surfers and water sports enthusiasts, thanks to the wind currents that shake the sea at will.\n\n7. Celebrate the festivities of the Virgin of Covadonga\n\nThe 8th of September is the feast day of Our Lady of Covadonga and Asturias is decked out to celebrate its patron saint.\n\nFrom the first day and throughout the week, the city presents a full programme of activities, from storytelling, mountain races, concerts, open-air dances, to the witch's train, because children have their place among the walks with legends and mysteries of Oviedo. And if you want to visit the sanctuary of the virgin, take a trip to Covadonga!\n\nVisit the Covadonga Lakes, stroll through the Picos de Europa, contemplate the traces of King Pelayo and the Spanish Reconquest next to the basilica of Santa María la Real de Covadonga, then go on to her sanctuary in the cave that draws the relief of the virgin and of course, don't forget to pass through Cangas de Onís where the day of our \"Santina\" fills all its streets with joy.\n\n8. Visit the parks of Oviedo\n\nOviedo has a wide range of parks and green areas, which are the best places for sports fans and children to spend their summer days.\n\nThere are parks such as Purificación Tomás, Winter, West and Santullano. There are children's areas, promenades, picnic areas, green areas with trees and plants, sports courts, cycle lanes, volleyball courts, skate parks, municipal swimming pools and much more.\n\nAnd if you feel like adding history and entertainment to your things to do in Oviedo with children, you can go to Campo San Francisco, where besides being a perfect place to spend time with family or friends during the summer months, you can also get close to some of the sculptures such as the famous Mafalda of Oviedo.\n\n9. Discover the Ponga National Park\n\nIf you're looking for a way to get into the nature of Asturias, this is the kind of excursion that has your name on it. During this walk you will encounter the biodiversity of thePonga National Park, an area with the lowest population density in the Principality. It is almost virgin!\n\nThis type of excursion allows you to see wolves, capercaillies, deer and even the European brown bear, especially if you organise your trip at the end of the summer. And not only that, you can also walk through Viboli, the Roman Bridge of Grazos, the viewpoint of Les Bedules, Casielles and more of the surrounding area of the Picos de Europa.\n\nThe valleys, mining villages and the varied landscape invite you to take pictures of every corner. For mountain lovers who would like to get to know the area around Oviedo in 1 day, this walk is a good option.\n\n10. Take part in the brown bear watching tour\n\nFrom the capital of the Principality you can set off on an exciting adventure: the sighting of the Cantabrian brown bears. Are you ready to meet these stars of the Asturian animal world? This type of day trip from Oviedo takes you to Teverga, Cangas del Narcea, Ibias, Degaña and, of course, the Somiedo National Park, the natural habitat of the brown bears.\n\nAs you pass through the different sites you will also be able to see wolves, wild boar and chamois. If you visit at the end of summer, apart from the bears, you may also witness the bellowing of the deer, which takes place between September and October. Sightseeing tours make several stops at ideal places to enjoy the sightings - you know that animals are unpredictable! Fortunately, summer is the best time to get both encounters.\n\nOther activities you can do include enjoying the views of the Somiedo Lakes, taking part in Pola de Somiedo -the Somiedo Market-, hiking, and even horse riding.\n\nTemperatures in Oviedo in summer\n\nThe city's climate is pleasant all year round, with warm temperatures and dry weather almost every day. During the summer the weather is delightful in Oviedo. The average temperature is 22 °C and rarely drops below 15 °C between July and September.\n\nThe hottest days are usually during the first week of August, when temperatures of 23 °C have been recorded. So you only have one task: pack everything to enjoy the best season of the year in Oviedo!\n\nThe influx of tourists in Oviedo in summer\n\nOviedo, Spain, is a great place to visit all year round. But for those who want to make the most of the capital during its best time of the year, schedule their visit during the summer season.\n\nIts climate, programme of activities, parties, excursions, concerts and festivals are a constant from July to September. There are also open swimming pools, parks, trains with special routes and let's not forget its lively terraces.\n\nPrices in Oviedo in summer\n\nOviedo is a city with an average price level similar to other cities in Asturias, especially when it comes to eating and shopping. Its prices are for all budgets, they adapt to the purchasing power of the local or tourist, and the same applies to services and products.\n\nIn the capital of Asturias you can enjoy a good breakfast for less than 15€, and drinks are usually included, there are literally no \"hidden costs\".\n\nYou can also find menu bars in Oviedo where you can have lunch for about 10€. Going to the best cider bars in Oviedo or tasting some of the best cheeses in the world are some of the big attractions and the prices are affordable."
