        "text": "Monuments of Oviedo & the Kingdom of the Asturias\n\n\"In the 9th century the flame of Christianity was kept alive in the Iberian Peninsula in the tiny Kingdom of the Asturias. Here an innovative pre-Romanesque architectural style was created that was to play a significant role in the development of the religious architecture of the peninsula. Its highest achievements can be seen in the churches of Santa María del Naranco, San Miguel de Lillo, Santa Cristina de Lena, the Cámara Santa and San Julián de los Prados, in and around the ancient capital city of Oviedo. Associated with them is the remarkable contemporary hydraulic engineering structure known as La Foncalada.\"\"In the 9th century the flame of Christianity was kept alive in the Iberian Peninsula in the tiny Kingdom of the Asturias.

Oviedo is recognized as the most culturally significant and historically interesting city of the province. It also boasts a reputation of being one of the cleanest cities in Europe.\n\nAfter a panoramic drive through Oviedo, begin a walking tour through the downtown core to see the outside of the San Salvador Gothic Cathedral.\n\nAdmire the painstakingly restored Old Town area, decorated with beautiful sculptures, and enjoy some free time to explore some more on your own before heading back to Gijón .\n\nPlease note: Wear comfortable walking shoes."
