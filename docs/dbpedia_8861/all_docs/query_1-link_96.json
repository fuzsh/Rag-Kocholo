The document provides a history of Oviedo, Spain, beginning with its origins in the 8th century when monks established a small farm and church. It grew as the capital of the Kingdom of Asturias under King Fruela I and his son Alfonso II, who decided to move the capital to Oviedo. In the Middle Ages, Oviedo was an important religious and political center but lost influence when the capital moved to Leon in 910. The city saw economic stagnation in the Modern Age but began growing again in the 18th century with the university, weapons factory, and cultural activities.",
