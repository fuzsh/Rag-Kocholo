        "text": "Optimally weekend-sized and walkable, the centre is a leading model of pedestrianisation that other Spanish cities have come to copy. Gothic and baroque architecture give a lovely geometry to the old town, while art deco and art nouveau façades frame the modernist margins, and the highlights are all doable in a couple of days. I think of Oviedo’s Museum of Fine Arts as a sort of free-to-enter mini-Prado, with especially great engravings by Goya and Piranesi (free; museobbaa.com). I find its urban park, Campo de San Francisco, more beautiful than Madrid’s Retiro (oviedo.es). And as an Irishman, I respond well to the colder-weather conviviality of native Asturians too, most often expressed in a mammy-like tendency to overfeed.\n\nOviedo is Spain’s official City of Gastronomy for 2024 and the food alone is a reason to go back. In fact, I’d take the trip just to eat gambas en gabardina, or battered prawns, with a strong, sweet cask vermouth made in-house at La Paloma — a lodestar of a bar founded in 1900 near Oviedo station. The owner, Carmen Garcia, inherited the place from her father, who had worked here from the age of 14. “It was an obligation that became a vocation,” she says (plates from £3; fb.com/cafeteria.lapaloma).\n\nCloser to the city centre, another, unrelated Paloma says much the same about the vintage deli and confectionery named after her great-great-grandfather Camilo de Blas.\n\n“It’s like a museum and if I can preserve it I will,” says Paloma, having quit her job as a chemist to help run the shop. Oviedo’s emblematic carbayones — moist, glazed handmade marcona-almond cakes — were invented right here behind its Carrara marble counter back in 1924 (pastries from £2.50; camilodeblas.es). I could celebrate that centenary by eating a whole box of them, like logs fed into a woodchipper, but I’m saving room for my favourite Spanish dish.\n\nDeep inside the old town, a wood-beamed institution called Casa Ramón serves a fine fabada asturiana, that signature stew of white beans, pork shoulder, chorizo and blood sausage (mains from £10; casaramonoviedo.com). Its massive protein payload can quickly send the unwary diner to sleep face down in the bowl, so the trick is to keep moving, like the local mountain men who were traditionally fed fabada as fuel for their agricultural labours or the pilgrims who still eat it to sustain them on the first leg of the Camino de Santiago.\n\nSan Salvador Cathedral marks the start of the original, or “primitive” camino and the site of the pre-Romanesque basilica from which King Alfonso II set out for the tomb of Saint James in AD813. Its Holy Chamber houses the Sudarium of Oviedo — the bloody shroud that is said to have bound the head of Jesus. Such relics can exert a curious power even over the non-believer — it’s a secular order of wonder that might be called Indiana Jonesian. No less of a marvel is the “Wamba”, the oldest still-ringing church bell in Europe, nicknamed for the deep note it’s been striking for more than 800 years (£6.70; catedraldeoviedo.com).\n\nFrom within the intricate openwork spire itself, shot through with breezes and sunbeams, you can look over the city to the profound farmlands beyond.\n\nRegional cheeses, such as cabrales, are matured in high caves out there. Dairy herds and apple orchards yield abundance on cool wet slopes where grapes don’t grow so well. Spain is a great winemaking nation, but Asturias is cider country, and Oviedo has capitalised by way of Calle Gascona, a central row of specialist taverns modelled on traditional rural sidrerias.\n\nThe pouring of natural cider is a sacred native ritual too. Everton Lopez, a waiter, teaches it to punters and prospective staff at Tierra Astur, a gourmet store for all that good domestic produce combined with a neo-rustic bar and grill (mains from £10; tierra-astur.com).\n\n“You mustn’t be afraid of the bottle,” he says, holding it high overhead, the way Freddie Mercury used to rock the microphone, to let the liquid cascade into a glass held down past his hips at arm’s length. Splashing and spilling are inevitable, a little of the nectar always sacrificed in the process. He pours it a mouthful at a time for proper aeration and hands it over to be drunk while it’s still foaming.\n\n“It’s like a dance and the cider is your partner,” says Lopez. It pairs well with pretty much everything sold or served here, not least the gigantic slab of cachopo — a breaded veal fillet with ham and melted sheep’s cheese that supposedly serves one person but scrolls across the table like a blueprint to a bank vault. Small plates do not really feature in Asturian cuisine — Oviedo is the Spanish city for anyone tired of tapas.\n\nOverfed again, I walk it off all the way to Santa Maria del Naranco, a pre-Romanesque chapel and crypt three miles out in the wooded foothills just beyond town. The Asturian King Ramiro II had it built in the mid-9th century, but scholars aren’t sure why: it might have been a hunting retreat, a throne room or even his tomb. Restoration means you can’t go inside but it’s worth the hike nonetheless. With its serpentine columns framing socket-like archways, this avatar from the Dark Ages has overseen the whole history of Oviedo, a thousand years and more of war and peace (santamariadelnaranco.es). Its silence speaks for the particular appeal of the city below: come for the food, stay for the abiding mystique.\n\nStephen Phelan was a guest of the Spanish Tourist Office (spain.info) and Nuvo Hotel Boutique (bluehoteles.es)\n\nThis article contains affiliate links that can earn us revenue\n\nWhere to stay\n\n1. Nuvo Hotel Boutique\n\nOpened in early 2024, this modest modern high-rise couldn’t be better located, planted as it is on the same central concourse that houses the shops and restaurants of Gran Bulevar El Vasco. Rooms are fresh and simple, with good views from upper floors over the city to misty surrounding hills. And while amenities are fairly limited, guests can access a huge adjoining gym and spa complex for a surcharge.\n\nDetails B&B doubles from £70 (bluehoteles.es)\n\n2. Eurostars Hotel de la Reconquista\n\nA room at the Reconquista has to be one of the sweetest deals in Spain — even high-season rates remain comparatively low at this repurposed 18th-century former hospice. Its ostentatious design centres on a courtyard framed by Doric pillars, and a monumental inner sanctum of oak and velvet. One wing of guest rooms has been updated to the present day decor-wise, while the other remains firmly (if a little fustily) in the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nDetails B&B doubles from £100 (eurostarshotels.com)\n\n3. Barcelo Oviedo Cervantes\n\nA recent refit spliced a little more contemporary appeal — a fresh and foliated Latin American-inspired design in the public spaces — into this beautifully designed 20th-century heritage mansion hotel at the edge of the city centre. On the menu are some nicely priced wines, creative tapas and a brunch menu that draws in locals as well as business guests and weekenders.\n\nDetails B&B doubles from £85 (barcelo.com)\n\n4. Gran Hotel las Caldas by Blau\n\nThis retreat on the grassy city outskirts was founded as a spa village in 1776. The grand hotel built on that site a couple of centuries later now sprawls across a complex of bathhouses and thermal circuits — some vintage, some modern — set into landscaped hillside gardens. Guest rooms range from spacious to gigantic, and the long walks between various facilities are prettified by stone paths, flowerbeds and rock streams.\n\nDetails B&B doubles from £137 (blauhotels.com)\n\nBecome a subscriber and, along with unlimited digital access to The Times and The Sunday Times, you can enjoy a collection of travel offers and competitions curated by our trusted travel partners, especially for Times+ members"
