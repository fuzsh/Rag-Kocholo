        "text": "Facing the Bay of Biscay and home to the Picos de Europa mountain range, Asturias evokes the Garden of Eden – with added drama. It’s a place of unspoilt beaches, enchanted forests, majestic peaks and seven Unesco-listed biosphere reserves. Outdoorsy sorts can’t get enough of it.\n\nBut the region has more to offer than wilderness. It became a kingdom 1,300 years ago, was never fully occupied by the Romans and it fought off the Moors in the early 700s. A local saying has it that “Asturias is Spain – the rest is conquered territory”.\n\nIt is no surprise then, that the past is ever present in Asturias, and nowhere can this be better experienced than in its smart, characterful capital.\n\nAlmost as old as the principality itself, for all its history Oviedo is wearing remarkably well. Perhaps its student population keeps it young, but whatever the reason, the city feels vibrant and forward-looking.\n\nAcclaimed as the cleanest city in Spain, Oviedo is modestly magnificent. The elegant streets, squares and parks of the pedestrianised old town are busy with restaurant goers, art lovers and weekending couples. Woody Allen, who featured the city in his film Vicky Christina Barcelona, described it as “fairytale” – and you don’t have to be a fan of the director to agree with him.\n\nVisits to the Fine Arts Museum of Asturias, which houses a superb collection of works by Dalí, Goya and El Greco and the Archaeological Museum of Asturias, both closed to Oviedo’s magnificent Gothic cathedral, will give you a glimpse of the city’s rich cultural life. But the heart of it is the Campoamor Theatre. For more than 70 years, the performing arts space has been mounting some of Spain’s most important opera seasons, and each spring holds a zarzuela (Spanish operetta) festival. It is also the venue where Spain’s version of the Nobel Prizes are given out.\n\nThe internationally coveted Princess of Asturias Awards are presented each October to individuals or organisations judged to have made valuable contributions in eight categories: arts, social sciences, humanities, international cooperation, technical and scientific research, literature, sport and concord (human rights, peace and unity). Each recipient at the ceremony – attended by the Spanish royal family – receives €50,000 and a sculpture by the artist Joan Miró. Past recipients include Martin Scorsese, Bob Dylan and Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, who designed the Niemeyer Centre in Avilés as a thank you for the award.\n\nThe Oviedo restaurant scene has attracted some serious attention lately, and you can sample dishes and partake in culinary traditions you simply can’t get elsewhere.\n\nCheese is a big deal in Asturias, though the average Brit won’t recognise the names: Cabrales, a semi-hard blue; Gamonéu, a nutty blend of cow’s, sheep’s and goat’s milk; and Afuega’l Pitu, a smooth, soft cheese, served plain or spiced with fiery paprika.\n\nCider is the drink of choice round here, and the sidrería, or cider house, is a sacred institution. Head to Calle Gascona, aka Cider Boulevard, and do as the locals do – pour the apple nectar from a height to give it some froth, knock it back quickly and leave a dribble of it in the bottom of your glass to pour out. It’s a ritual, performative part of cider culture.\n\nSan Julián de los Prados, also built in the 800s, was the largest Christian construction in Spain up until the 11th century. And yet its frescoes and decorative flourishes seem playful, even daring, like artworks in a gallery.\n\nAnd that’s the joy of Oviedo, a city that appears utterly ancient and thoroughly modern at the same time, one whose respect for the past is matched only by its enthusiasm for the future.\n\nPhotography: Turismo de Asturias, Juan de Tury and Marcos Morilla"
