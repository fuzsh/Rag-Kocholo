        "text": "Asturias is a part of the north that is typically referred to as “green Spain”, owing to just that, the lush greenery that you’ll find everywhere here! And while that is an apt description, Asturias can really be broken down into three separate categories:\n\nFirst, the urban area, which is predominantly the triangle that connects Oviedo, Gijón, and Avilés. Next, the sea and the coastline, which stretches all along the north of the region from east to west. And finally, heading just a few kilometers inland from the coast, you have the mountains of the Asturian range rising up to 2,500 meters high.\n\nUrban Asturias\n\nIf we talk about Asturias’ urban landscape, it’s three principal cities of Oviedo, Gijón, and Avilés, each with their own particular personality, are the major destinations of note, but the entire eastern side of the region along the coast is quite developed and fairly urban.\n\nOviedo is probably the best-preserved city in the region, and it’s certainly the most visited and internationally known - so much so that the famous director Woody Allen often says it's his favorite city in the world.\n\nA visit to Oviedo is like a stroll through time; to the medieval splendor of the 10th century when this was the center of the Asturian Kingdom, to the elegance of the 19th century when famous authors like Leopoldo Alas \"‘Clarín’ walked its streets. This is a city made for walking, getting lost, and marveling.\n\nGijón, on the other hand, is a maritime city, with all those characteristics that cities facing the sea usually offer: vibrant, lively, fun, cosmopolitan, nocturnal, and a little bit cheeky!\n\nAnd Avilés, the industrial city of the bunch was once the ugly duckling, but has seen a rapid transformation in recent years, becoming modern and repurposing its formerly empty, abandoned industrial buildings for modern day uses.\n\nThe coastline\n\nAsturias’ entire northern border runs along the Cantabrian Sea, so it should come as no surprise that the region has a strong maritime tradition. This can be felt quite clearly in Gijón, but even more so in the little fishing villages that dot the coast, from east to west.\n\nThe stretch of coast to the east of Gijón is fairly urbanized, with development running along much of the land until you reach the border with Cantabria. This isn’t to say that it’s industrial (far from that), but it isn’t entirely wild, unspoiled nature either. The coast here is a bit calmer than what you’ll find to the west.\n\nMeanwhile, the western side of the region is much more rural, and the beaches are wilder, less developed, less crowded, and more like what you’d find in neighboring Galicia. The towns that dot the sea here are also smaller, and there’s less tourism than on the eastern coast.\n\nWith over 200 beaches in the region, there are all types: wide, sandy shores, hidden coves, rocky beaches, dunes backed by pine forests, great surfing spots, calm bays, and crescents of golden sand with sheer vertical cliffs rising up behind them. You’ll be spoiled for choice.\n\nThe mountains\n\nHowever, in Spain, Asturias is most often associated with the mountains, and outdoor adventures and mountaineers come from all over Europe to flock to the Picos de Europa National Park, which has some of the most impressive mountains on the entire continent.\n\nHere, amongst the mountains are a wealth of hiking trails, incredible cycling routes, premier rock climbing areas, eco tourism, campgrounds, rivers, farms and local producers, bear watching (!), and unexpected historical sites. In Asturias, it wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that the mountains are and contain everything.\n\nFurthermore, it’s in the small isolated villages tucked away between mountains where the best Asturian culinary traditions are still carried on today. A culinary culture epitomized by three dishes, two of them traditional and one modern: On one hand, the fabada (stew) and cider that Asturians have eaten and drunk since time immemorial. And, on the other, in that controversial dish known as cachopo: a huge veal steak, breaded and stuffed with cheese and other ingredients like cured beef, ham, or chorizo.\n\nAsk any Asturian and they’ll tell you the same thing about their cuisine: to walk amoug mountains, one needs to be well fed. That’s never in doubt here!\n\nAsturias is quintessential northern Spain, and what that means is green landscapes, pristine undeveloped beaches, great food, impressive mountains, and one other thing: rain, a lot of rain, and some wind and cold too - especially in winter.\n\nTherefore, my recommendation is clear: if you want to experience Asturias at its best, visit it in summer.\n\nVisiting in summer\n\nEven though you can never guarantee a run of clear days here, the summer is usually quite sunny, with very pleasantly warm temperatures that are comfortable but rarely too hot, and long days where the sun doesn’t set until well into the night.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best weather and the one single time of year when you can hit the beach, visit the cities, and hike in the mountains on any given day, summer is the right choice.\n\nOf course, it’s no secret that the summer is the nicest time of year in Asturias, and this period also coincides with children’s school holidays, so this is definitely the busiest time of year. The major cities, beaches and coastal towns, and even the most popular hiking trails will be fairly busy during this period, but unlike other parts of Spain, it’s rarely going to be uncomfortably or unpleasantly crowded.\n\nPrices will be higher than at other times of year as well and accommodation can book out well in advance, but northern Spain is a fairly affordable destination, so it’s nothing crazy.\n\nVisiting in spring or fall\n\nNow, if being able to swim in the sea isn’t all that important to you but you still want pretty good weather and are most interested in hiking and exploring the mountains, the late spring and early fall are excellent choices.\n\nMornings and evenings are a little chilly during both seasons, but the afternoons are very pleasant, with warm temperatures perfect for hiking in a t-shirt and shorts. Rain is more of an issue than during the summer, so you’ll probably have a few rainy days or at least some showers to deal with, and there are more cloudy days as well, but there should still be plenty of clear skies and sun.\n\nAfter the winter, the spring is a really lovely time, as the flowers burst into bloom and everything is green and growing. You will probably still encounter snow at high altitudes though, so know that some hiking and mountaineering activities may be difficult or closed entirely.\n\nIn the autumn, the foliage turns beautiful shades of orange, red, yellow, and brown, and the oak, beech, and chestnut forests in the mountains and valleys are truly spectacular. Hiking trails and high mountain passes will all be accessible too, so this is a great time for outdoor activities. Rain is more common toward the end of the season, so if you can make it in late September or October, that’s best.\n\nVisiting in winter\n\nA trip to Asturias in the winter is only for the most adventurous, or for people who don’t mind cold temperatures and near constant days of rain (is that anyone?).\n\nHigh in the mountains you’ll find plenty of snow, but in most of the region it will just be cold and rainy - not ideal for sightseeing or getting outdoors. You’ll still be able to do some hiking, but many routes will be closed or inaccessible, and you should be an experienced hiker if you decide to venture into the mountains in winter.\n\nThe cities, villages, and beaches along the coast can be rather atmospheric on these cold, rainy days however, and there’s no better time of year to enjoy a fabada, the classic hearty Asturian stew.\n\nIf you have good rain gear and don’t mind getting wet, the cities and coast can still be interesting to explore, and you’ll be doing so with almost no other tourists around, which is fun.\n\nThings to do in Asturias\n\n1. Walk some of the northern route of the Camino de Santiago\n\nIn recent years, the Camino de Santiago, that network of routes crossing the Iberian Peninsula towards the city of Santiago de Compostela, has experienced a tremendous boom. The main route, which runs through the Castilian Plateau, sees constant overcrowding for almost all months of the year. However, there are other routes that are more accessible and less traveled, one of which is the Northern Way, which crosses Asturias from east to west on its way to Galicia.\n\nThe Camino de Santiago del Norte was born centuries ago as a way for Christian pilgrims to avoid the Plateau, where Arab attacks were common. Today, it has become a wonderful route along the coast of the Cantabrian Sea. As tough as it is beautiful, doing one or two stages on your trip to Asturias is something you shouldn't miss if you like trekking.\n\n2. Try “fabada”, Asturias’ most famous dish\n\nThe famous cachopo (described earlier in this article) is a recent invention, so if there's a traditional Asturian dish worth trying, it's the fabada, a hearty pork and bean stew. Here's a list of the best restaurants to try it at:\n\nIn Oviedo, you have two great options, one quite traditional, the other with a touch of haute cuisine: Casa Chema (traditional) and Casa Cabal (more modern and upscale). In Gijón, a classic you have a classic in any culinary guide: Casa Gerardo. Near the beaches of Llanes, in the east of the Principality, lies another classic: Casa Marcial, in Parres. And finally, in Mieres, at the gateway to the mountains, perhaps my favorite temple dedicated to fabada: La Consistorial.\n\n3. Sample some of the world-famous Cabrales cheeses\n\nIf there's an Asturian food more renowned and internationally recognized than fabada, it's not a dish, but is rather the cheese from the Cabrales area, a mountainous region located amidst the Picos de Europa.\n\nCabrales cheese is a blue cheese made from sheep, cow, and goat’s milk, and it’s a very strong, pungent cheese that delights enthusiasts but may not be a favorite of more casual fans.\n\nIf you're one of those cheese fanatics though, you know what to do: head to Arenas de Cabrales and the surrounding are and ask the locals where you can find the best cheese.\n\n4. Hike the famous Ruta del Cares trail\n\nSince we're in the area of the Picos de Europa and Cabrales cheese, whether you're a mountain fan or not, here's a plan you must do: hike the Ruta del Cares trail. Probably the best-known trekking route in the Iberian Peninsula, this is a 22 kilometers trail (with little elevation gain, luckily) through the cliffs, gorges, and mountain passes that dot this part of the Picos de Europa.\n\nBe careful: although it's a very popular route, the path along the Cares is not for everyone. It requires some physical preparation, appropriate equipment, and the necessary supplies for a six-hour mountain hike —drinks, food, warm clothing. But if you have all that, this is a unique experience that you can't miss on your visit to Asturias.\n\n5. Canoe down the Sella River\n\nHere we have another active outdoor activity, but that’s what Asturias is all about: with so much nature around, how can you not take full advantage of it?\n\nIf there’s any one outdoor activity here that perfectly combines great nature with a festive atmosphere, it’s the international canoeing event called the “Descent of the Sella River”. The Sella is one of the most important rivers of the Principality and, during the first weekend of August, it is the host for a canoeing competition that dates back almost 100 years, where competitors race for 20 kilometers, traveling between the towns of Arriondas and Ribadesella.\n\nOf course, you don't have to be a professional canoeist to take part: thousands of people join in the event, paddling down the river in the competitors’ wake. The atmosphere is joyous and festive, with everyone drinking cider and having a blast. It’s a true party, and is always one of the biggest of the year in Asturias.\n\nNow, if you don’t happen to be here in early August, don’t despair! You can canoe, raft, or kayak down the river whenever you want, as there are dozens of companies in the area that rent out gear and organize tours.\n\n6. Visit the Niemeyer Center\n\nI mentioned the Niemeyer Center earlier when talking about the city of Avilés, but this art and cultural center deserves a second mention. This building, more than any other, drove the industrial reconversion of Avilés and really helped lift the city out of decline.\n\nNo matter when you visit, there is always something going on here: live music, theater shows, art exhibits, talks, and other artistic and cultural events of all kinds.\n\n7. Travel through time, visiting the Romanesque and Gothic masterpieces of Asturias\n\nWith so many centuries of history, and having played a pivotal role in Spain’s Reconquista, Asturias has a wealth of beautiful religious architecture spanning different eras and styles.\n\nIf you want to take a trip back through time exploring the finest Romanesque and Gothic structures in Asturias, here’s what I’d suggest: Sart in Oviedo, which is a medieval masterpiece of a city. While there, climb up Mount Naranco and visit two of the finest pre-Romanesque churches in Asturias: Santa María del Naranco and San Miguel de Lillo.\n\nFrom there, head south along the road that eventually leads to Madrid, until you reach the Church of Santa Cristina de Lena, another gem from the time when Asturias was the central point of resistance against the Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAnd finally, make your way to the border with Castilla y Leon, to the Colegiata de Santa Maria Church in Arbás del Puerto, which is an an old pilgrims' hospital.\n\n8. Get lost in the remote villages of western Asturias\n\nNear the border with Galicia, villages like Luarca, Navia, Tapia de Casariego, Castropol, and Vegadeo still retain that isolated, end-of-the-world feel that increases as you go further west, until you actually reach the end of the world in Galicia.\n\nIf Asturias is known for wild nature, western Asturias is even wilder, and it’s here that the Cantabrian Sea and the mountains almost fuse together, so close are they to one another. Here, the nature is less hospitable but more magical, just like in the neighboring Galician territory. Even the local language spoken here is much more similar to that of Galicia (Gallego).\n\nAs Nacho Vegas says - one of Asturias’ most famous singer-songwriters - “there is no wilder part of Asturias than this western coast”. And if he says it, a man who left Gijón behind to move here, it's because he knows what he's talking about.\n\n9. Attend an Asturian romería - a pilgrimage procession\n\nBut Nacho Vegas is no longer the most famous singer in Asturias. That privilege now belongs to a much younger, more groundbreaking, and more controversial singer: Rodrigo Cuevas, the closest thing to a Freddie Mercury in the Principality. With music that blends the Celtic tradition of village festivals with electronic music, Rodrigo Cuevas is a reference in the Spanish cultural world.\n\nAnd do you know what plan Rodrigo Cuevas would recommend to you? He’d say that you must attend a traditional Asturian romería. These are pilgrimages, local religious processions that make their way out to a church or holy site of some kind, often in little villages. Very much a celebration, along the way you’ll drink cider, dance, meet people, and of course, listen to the latest Rodrigo Cuevas album.\n\n10. Summit the high pass of the Lakes of Covadonga by bicycle\n\nAnd finally, let's finish up with another great outdoor activity - this time on two wheels. I haven’t mentioned this up to this point, but Asturias is also one of the premier cycling regions in the Iberian peninsula, so a bike ride is an absolute must.\n\nThere are tons of great routes here, mostly on quiet country roads, but the most impressive of all of them is the ride to the Lakes of Covadonga pass. This is Spain’s most famous cycling climb and it’s also a part of the Vuelta a España race. Stretching for about 14 kilometers, it’s a very challenging uphill climb, but is not so intimidating that you shouldn’t attempt it. Car traffic is often banned from the route in July and August (when its busiest with cyclists), but traffic is often light at other times of year anyways.\n\nThe challenge is well worth it, as the scenery along the way is spectacular. Passing through the Picos de Europa park, this is one of the most beautiful rides you will ever do, and the lakes at the end are gorgeous.\n\nAnd for those of you who are really daring, there’s an even more extreme option: the Angliru Pass. I’ll let you look it up.\n\n7-day Asturias itinerary\n\nHere's what, for me, is the perfect plan for a week in Asturias.\n\nDay 1: Arrive into Oviedo and immediately set off to explore the city center. Have lunch somewhere in the lovely Plaza del Fontán square, and then set out for a climb up Mount Naranco. Head back down into the city to get lost in its medieval streets, making sure to pop into many of the lovely old churches.\n\nDay 2: Take the train to Gijón, and head into the city center as soon as you arrive. Here, have lunch in the Cimadevilla neighborhood (the most historic part of the city), then stop by the underground Roman Baths, and explore the Catalina Headland.\n\nLater in the afternoon, spend some time lounging on the excellent San Lorenzo beach, and end the day with a stroll along the lovely seaside promenade.\n\nDay 3: Travel to Avilés, which has really had a resurgence in recent years. The historic center is quite nice, with tons of brightly painted houses and structures standing alongside more muted, classical buildings. Take your time strolling through the narrow streets, admiring the arcades, and people watching in the many bright, sunny squares. Plaza de España is the prettiest square in the city, surrounded by lovely architecture.\n\nAfter touring the center, make your way across the river estuary in the direction of the Centro Niemeyer, which is a fantastic arts center. An incredible structure, the exhibits and shows here are quite good and well worth checking out for a few hours.\n\nDay 4: Rent a car and drive out to the little village of Cangas de Onís. Here, you can visit the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Covadonga, a cave where Asturias’ first king, Pelayo, is said to have encountered the Virgin Mary. Whether the story is true or not, the cave is in a lovely natural setting.\n\nAfterwards, have dinner at La Sifonería, a cider house that is famous for making “cachopo”.\n\nDay 5: Hike the 22km Ruta del Cares in the Picos de Europa. This is one of the most popular and most spectacular hiking routes in Spain, so be prepared for 6 hours of incredible scenery as you hike along narrow paths, gorges, cliffs, and high mountain passes.\n\nIn the late afternoon, pay a visit to a local dairy farm, where you can learn about the cheesemaking process and try Cabrales cheese.\n\nDay 6: Leave the mountains behind and spend the day visiting Lastres and Llanes, the two pearls of the Asturian coast. Llanes is a sizeable town of about 15,000, whereas Lastres is a little fishing village with less than 1,000 residents.\n\nThere are no real sights for me to tell you about in either town, and that’s sort of the point: the pleasure of a visit to them is about enjoying being on the sea, feeling Asturias’ maritime atmosphere, and cruising out along the coast to nearby beaches and coves.\n\nDay 7: On your final day in Asturias, don’t just look at the coast, get out into it! Head to Galpiyuri beach, one of the best in Asturias, and spend your final day lounging on the beach, enjoying the sun, the surf, and the sand. There’s no better way to bid farewell to Asturias."
