        "text": "From its majestic mountains and pristine beaches to its charming villages and centuries-old traditions, this corner of the Iberian north offers a unique and memorable experience for all those who venture to discover its hidden treasures.\n\nImmerse yourself in its lush landscapes, where the peaks of the Picos de Europa rise majestically over valleys dotted with stone houses and lush forests. Every corner of this land breathes history and tradition, from the ancient fishing villages to the imposing castles that bear witness to its medieval past.\n\nWith a gastronomy that delights the senses and a warm and welcoming people, Asturias invites you to get lost in its picturesque corners and to savor life in every bite.\n\nPrepare your backpack and your desire for adventure, because Asturias awaits you with open arms and a thousand stories to tell.\n\nA trip to the past\n\nThe history of Asturias is rich and varied, with deep roots dating back to ancient times.\n\nThe first traces of population in Asturias date back to prehistoric times, with the presence of Neolithic communities that left their mark in the form of cave paintings, such as those found in the Tito Bustillo cave. During Roman times, Asturias was part of the province of Hispania and witnessed the construction of numerous infrastructures, such as roads and aqueducts. However, the Asturian resistance to the Roman occupation was remarkable, and they were known for their resistance and bravery.\n\nAfter the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century, Asturias emerged as an independent Christian kingdom under the reign of Pelayo, considered the first Asturian king. The Battle of Covadonga in 722 is a key point in the history of Asturias, where Pelayo is said to have achieved the first Christian victory over the Muslims, marking the beginning of the Christian Reconquest of the peninsula.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Asturias experienced a period of splendor with the consolidation of the Kingdom of Asturias and the expansion of its territory. Numerous pre-Romanesque churches were built, such as Santa María del Naranco or San Miguel de Lillo, which are World Heritage Sites.\n\nWith the unification of the peninsular kingdoms, Asturias became part of the Crown of Castile in the 15th century. During the Industrial Revolution, the city experienced great economic growth due to coal mining and the steel industry. However, it is also the scene of labor conflicts, such as the well-known “Asturias Revolution” in 1934 and the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\n\nAfter the Civil War and Franco’s dictatorship, Asturias underwent a period of transformation and economic development, diversifying its economy and betting on tourism and modern industry. Today, Asturias is known for its natural beauty, rich culture and traditional gastronomy.\n\nWhere villages come alive\n\nRuta del Cares: An adventure trail between mountains\n\nThis spectacular hiking route will take you through a breathtaking gorge in the heart of the Picos de Europa. The scenery is spectacular and the hike is an unforgettable experience for nature lovers. It is a trail of about 12 kilometers long that runs between the towns of Poncebos, in the council of Cabrales, and Cain, in the municipality of Posada de Valdeón, in the heart of the Picos de Europa. The trail follows the course of the Cares River through a narrow gorge carved into the limestone rock, known as the “Garganta Divina” (Divine Gorge).\n\nRibadesella: Where the sea and history meet.\n\nIts fishing port and promenade are ideal places to stroll and enjoy the maritime atmosphere. In addition, the old town is full of cobbled streets and charming houses that invite you to get lost and explore its history.

You go inside the cave and can admire the geological formations and subway watercourses that characterize it. A unique experience.\n\nLlanes: Coastal beauty and medieval charm\n\nA picturesque coastal village with an impressive medieval old town.

Strolling through the port and its surroundings allows you to immerse yourself in the maritime atmosphere and observe up close the daily activity of fishermen and sailors. It is full of picturesque corners and viewpoints that offer spectacular views of the town and the sea. The Luarca Lighthouse and the Mirador de la Atalaya are two essential places to visit, from where you can enjoy panoramic views of the port, the beaches and the Cantabrian Sea.\n\nThe Way of St. James: A millenary route of faith, culture and adventure.\n\nAsturias is part of the Camino de Santiago, one of the most famous pilgrimage routes in the world. You can walk stretches of the Northern Way and visit places like the Cathedral of Oviedo, which houses the Holy Chamber with the relics of St. James.\n\nSomiedo Natural Park: A refuge of wild nature\n\nThis natural park offers breathtaking mountain scenery, glacial lakes and a great diversity of flora and fauna. It is perfect for hiking, bird watching or simply enjoying the tranquility of nature. Among the park’s natural treasures are its glacial lakes, known as “lakes of Somiedo”. The most famous is Lago del Valle, the largest natural lake in Asturias, surrounded by green meadows and mountains.\n\nGastronomy\n\nAsturian gastronomy is one of the most appreciated in Spain, standing out for its richness of flavors, fresh ingredients and traditional dishes that reflect the culture and history of the region.\n\nAsturias has an extensive coastline, which is reflected in its cuisine through a wide variety of fresh fish and seafood. Among the most outstanding seafood are barnacles, crab, spider crabs and prawns, while among the most common fish are bonito, hake and sea bass.\n\nConsidered the most emblematic dish of the region, fabada asturiana is a traditional stew based on fabes (white beans), chorizo, black pudding, pork shoulder and bacon.
