The Santa María del Naranco was part of a larger complex of royal buildings, including the nearby Asturian pre-Romanesque Church of San Miguel de Lillo. The San Miguel de Lillo served as a royal chapel. The Asturian pre-Romanesque Church of San Julián de los Prados is situated in Oviedo, a town along the Way of St. James to Santiago de Compostela.
