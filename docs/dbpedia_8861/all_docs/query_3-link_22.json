        "text": "Important cities of Asturias on the map\n\nWe begin the visit in Oviedo, the capital of the Principality of Asturias, we continue through Gijón, the largest town, and we end in Avilés, the town of Adelantado., an industrial city that has undergone regeneration in recent decades and has become a modern city.\n\nWhat to visit in Oviedo in a day\n\n· The historic center of Oviedo It has a nineteenth-century flavor that is difficult to find in other Spanish capitals. Its Cathedral Square is worth a visit, presided over by the monumental flamboyant tower of its basilica and a wide open space in which there were houses with beautiful arcades. The famous “les madreñes” market was held there. Without moving away from the nerve center par excellence, we see the Palacio de los Valdecárzana Heredia, from the 1931th century. A mythical building for Oviedo society and for romantic fiction, since the famous Casino de la Regenta was located there until XNUMX. The University, the Plaza del Ayuntamiento, the Campoamor Theatre, the San Francisco Park... are enclaves to visit on a quiet walk through the area.\n\n· Cathedral\n\nThe Cathedral of Oviedo is a building that began to be built at the beginning of the XNUMXth century on the ruins of pre-Romanesque and Romanesque basilicas, and it took three centuries to build. His style is flowery or flamboyant Gothic, dominant at that time. One of the most important parts is the Holy Chamber, a treasure of Romanesque sculpture where the sacred relics of the Asturian kingdom are kept.\n\n· El Fontan Market\n\nIn the heart of old Oviedo today, it was a natural lagoon that was located on the outskirts of the city. This lagoon supplied by natural springs had a main source or fontán, which supplied the lagoon with its waters, hence it gets its name.\n\nIt was in the XNUMXth century that the many merchants who came to the city dried up and built a porticoed square. Today the street vendor is on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays in the morning hours.\n\nWhat to do in Gijón\n\nGijón is the most populous city in Asturias -exceeds 270.000 inhabitants- and the most dynamic.\n\nThe statue of Don Pelayo presides over the image of the marina in the Plaza del Marqués. There is the Revillagigedo Palace. It dates back to the first decades of the XNUMXth century and today is the headquarters of the International Center for Contemporary Art. We are in the Cimadevilla neighborhood, the old town par excellence, that of the first settlers of the town.\n\nWhat to see in Gijón\n\nGijón has three beaches, a commercial port, a sports port, an industrial neighborhood, large parks, a...\n\nSan Lorenzo Beach\n\nThe sandy area par excellence of the city, although there are three beaches. Its promenade along the wall is full of walkers and athletes all year round, and if it is summer, bathers. We are at the western end of the beach, near the Church of San Pedro. If we go all over the wall we take a good walk, and if we continue the walk we will do a good number of kilometers along the Senda del Cervigón, being able to contemplate in turn a good number of sculptures.\n\n· Roman sites of Gijón\n\nConquer Asturias for the Romans was not easy, getting to irritate Augusto, who came to the area mobilizing seven extra legions. The definitive submission would come in the year 19 before Christ and Rome would leave in Gijón the trace of its architecture and its way of life: the thermal baths of Campo Valdés, the Roman villa of Veranes or the fertile archeology of Campa Torres.\n\nOf tourism by Avilés\n\nThe city of Avilés, third in population, hides a huge heritage and a dreamy historic center.\n\nIt is also known as the Villa del Adelantado, in honor of a famous avilesino conquistador named Pedro Menéndez, appealing the Adelantado. It is a town of great commercial and port tradition, with many noblemen who settled here during the Middle and Modern Ages, building large mansions and palaces.\n\nInside the street map, Rivero Street and Galiana Street run through the most famous arcades of the Principality\n\nThe fishermen's quarter, the old and new churches of Sabugo, are well worth a visit, as well as the Plaza de España, crossing the streets of La Fruta or La Ferrería and then entering Ferrera Park, the green lung of the city.\n\nNiemeyer Center\n\nOn December 15, 2010 it opened its doors for the first time on the occasion of the 103rd birthday of Óscar Niemeyer, the famous Brazilian architect who years ago agreed to give Avilés this project as a thank you for the 1989 Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts .\n\nIt rises on the right bank of the Avilés estuary. It is a square open to the world and culture, a project to regenerate a deeply industrial city in the XNUMXth century that aspires to an aesthetic and post-industrial reconversion in the XNUMXst.\n\nUseful information for your trip\n\nIf you have already decided to come visit us, we give you all the information you need to organize your visit without surprises.\n\nHow to get to Asturias by AVE\n\nThe Principality is no longer far from Madrid.
