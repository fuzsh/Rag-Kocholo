        "text": "A two-week itinerary for Asturias in northern Spain is not enough to see all this region has to offer, but it’s a start.\n\nThere are lots of reasons to love this corner of Spain, one of my favorites.\n\nAsturias’ moniker, “Spain’s natural paradise” is well deserved. The region is greener and more lush than other parts of Spain to the south, hence its nickname, “the green coast.”\n\nThis 2-week itinerary for northern Spain, particularly Asturias, will take you to snow-capped mountains, lush green valleys, sparkling sunny beaches and picturesque medieval towns.\n\nThe northern coast of Spain stretches for over 345 km along the Bay of Biscay. The area is dotted with sandy beaches, soaring cliffs and some of the most picturesque fishing villages in all of Spain or even Europe.\n\nAs a history buff, I fell in love with Asturias. The region’s history dates from the Paleolithic, around 36,000 years ago. Cave paintings dating from this period are found throughout the region.\n\nAsturias has a collection of 1,200-year-old UNESCO World Heritage palaces in Oviedo, the region’s capital city.\n\nPerfectly preserved medieval villages make for an ideal historical tour.\n\nContemporary art is also visible in Asturias’ museums as well as world-renowned cultural organizations like the Oscar Niemeyer Center in Aviles.\n\nAsturias is also foodie heaven. After all, this is Spain!\n\nHere is a two-week itinerary for Asturias that can be stretched or condensed to fit time constraints or interests. A collection of unique and extraordinary experiences that only northern Spain and Asturias can deliver.\n\nIf you fly into Asturias airport, you likely will arrive in the airport near Oviedo, an ideal place to begin your journey.\n\nYou can rent a car in the Asturias airport when you land. The airport is about a 30-minute drive from the city of Oviedo.\n\nAnother alternative is to take a taxi or bus from the airport to Oviedo then rent a car when you are ready to continue your two-week itinerary.\n\nOviedo: First Stop on a Two-week Itinerary for Asturias in northern Spain\n\nOviedo has it all. Top museums include the Museums of Fine Arts and Archeology.\n\nThe city’s wide plazas are ideal for strolling. Plaza Porlier is where you’ll find the Cathedral of San Salvador built in the 1300s in a jumble of architectural styles; Baroque, Gothic, Renaissance and pre-Romanesque.\n\nThe Plaza del Fontán, located in the city’s old town has been used as a marketplace for centuries.\n\nThe more modern Plaza de la Escandalera, located in the downtown area, is surrounded by elegant buildings and right next to Oviedo’s pedestrian commercial streets.\n\nThree can’t-miss structures around Oviedo are the UNESCO World Heritage monuments from the 9th and 8th centuries CE.\n\nThese remarkably well-preserved, pre-Romanesque structures include the church of Santa María del Naranco, formerly the residence of Asturian royalty.\n\nNearby are the churches of San Miguel de Lillo and San Julián de los Prados where you can still see wall frescoes that are over one thousand years old!\n\nYou definitely want to add them to your itinerary for Asturias.\n\nOviedo is not just about history and culture. It also punches above its weight when it comes to cuisine.\n\nOne standout restaurant on one of the main plazas is La Corte de Pelayo, specializing in traditional Asturian cuisine (they claim to have the best fabada, Asturian bean stew, in all of Spain).\n\nTry to get a window seat to enjoy the views of the expansive plaza and avenues outside.\n\nA short walk from La Corte de Pelayo is pedestrian Gascona Street with traditional Asturian restaurants lining both sides of the street.\n\nThis is also where you find the sidrerias, or cider bars, where waiters pour alcoholic cider into a glass from several feet in the air without missing a drop!\n\nOne expects Oviedo to be the traditional Spanish town with the massive cathedral in the central plaza surrounded by medieval monasteries, convents, churches and winding cobblestone streets.\n\nYes, there’s that, along with riveting museums and art galleries.\n\nWhat one does not expect is the atmosphere of party central that exists in this city.\n\nThere are three main sections of the city reserved for extreme revelry, each more fun than the next.\n\nCider Street is where you’ll find cider served from bottles held up to four feet away from the glass, and great regional cuisine in all the restaurants.\n\nLocal musicians wander in and out of these restaurants performing and encouraging the patrons to join in the revelry.\n\nAdd to that some of the best wine in all of Spain and the result is the Spanish version of a rip-roaring good time.\n\nSometimes the patrons follow the musicians out to their next stop to continue the fun. It’s unique and one of the best places to experience in Asturias!\n\nOn most nights local musicians play traditional Asturian music to accompany the cider-fueled revelry.\n\nEven the customers will join in the singing and sometimes follow the musicians out to the restaurant next door.\n\nA meal here is a must-have experience. It is the Spanish equivalent of a rip-roaring good time.\n\nTapas Street has a myriad of counter-service bars offering killer tapas.\n\nThe more upscale North Street offers gastronomic works of art at surprisingly reasonable prices.\n\nI’ve stayed in a couple of hotels in Oviedo but my favorite is the Campoamor, mainly because of its location. It sits right across the majestic Campoamor Theater.\n\nIt is also within walking distance of the Old Town, the commercial streets and the city’s expansive parks.\n\nOther places to stay in Oviedo.\n\nTour Asturias’ Mining Culture\n\nAsturias has traditionally been a coal-producing region delivering up to 70% of Spain’s coal needs.\n\nTo understand Asturias, it helps to understand the mining culture and history.\n\nThe Mining and Industry Museum, MUMI for short, about 20 miles southeast of Oviedo, is just the place to learn.\n\nThe MUMI is not just a museum in the traditional sense. It is a re-creation of the mining experience.\n\nThe displays and exhibits show mining life from the previous centuries to modern times.\n\nThe highlight of the museum is traveling in a mining elevator shaft to a recreated mine complete with coal carts and winding tunnels.\n\nInsider tip: The exhibit is so realistic that I actually believed I was descending 600 meters (almost 2,000 feet) deep into the earth and reaching an abandoned mine! Don’t make the same mistake.\n\nThe MUNI provides a unique learning experience made all the more effective because it’s a lot of fun.\n\nThe Port City of Gijon\n\nOviedo to Gijon: 35 km north via A66\n\nFrom Oviedo, head north to the port town of Gijon with its Roman ruins, top-notch museums, oceanside promenade and an abundance of Michelin-rated restaurants.\n\nFor a traditional sidreria, or cider bar, with traditional Asturian cooking, try El Otro Mallu. They have great 3-course daily specials for lunch. You just can’t beat their fresh seafood.\n\nIt is from Gijon that most Asturian emigrants left their homeland for the new world in the Americas.\n\nSo many left that the city honors the Asturian mothers, who grieved over their departing children, with a statue on the promenade.\n\nIf you have time, don’t miss Cabo de Peñas, 30 km north of Gijon. This is the northernmost point of Asturias jutting deep into the dark, blue Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe view of the soaring cliffs is stunning and provides outstanding photo opportunities (which I missed when I ran out of batteries on my camera).\n\nThe view is impressive from the lighthouse but is even more spectacular if you climb beyond. This is likely to be a highlight of your 2-week Asturian tour.\n\nGijon is worth a deep and leisurely stay, especially in the summer months when the beaches beckon.\n\nThere is certainly enough here to keep a family busy for a couple of days.\n\nInsider tip: Try to have a seafood meal here, or anywhere on the coast.\n\nAccommodations in Gijon.\n\nPicturesque Lastres\n\nGijon to Lastres: 62 km east via A-64\n\nLastres is the first of many oceanside fishing villages and beach towns you will encounter on this 2 week itinerary for Asturias.\n\nIt has a population of about 1000 people and a whaling heritage evident in the town’s signs and decorations.\n\nWalk down its winding streets and alleys to the port and stroll around until you find yourself a nice seafood shack and relax.\n\nA nice town to have a break and experience a Spanish fishing village.\n\nLlanes, the Town that Has It All\n\nLastres to Llanes: 52 km east via A-8\n\nLlanes is one of the larger oceanside towns on this itinerary for Asturias in Spain’s north coast.\n\nThis area is dotted by dozens of beaches many of which are said to be the best in Asturias.\n\nLlanes has a small but interesting Old Town with a defensive medieval tower and 13th-century wall surrounding the town.\n\nFor a small town, Llanes has a remarkable collection of good local restaurants.\n\nOne that you should not miss is La Tertulia. No matter who I asked for a restaurant recommendation, the response was always the same, La Tertulia. And boy were they right!\n\nThis place is a legend. In a country like Spain where eating well is culturally ingrained, La Tertulia stands out. This is one meal (octopus) I will remember years from now.\n\nLlanes is the ideal town to park yourself for one or two nights to explore the surrounding attractions.\n\nThis will prevent you from checking into yet another location because there is that much to see nearby.\n\nThe perfect place to stay is the centrally located, welcoming and well-appointed Hotel Miracielos.\n\nThe breakfasts are hearty and feature Spanish specialties. There is a cozy bar that gets lively at night. The rooms are comfortable and the staff could not be more hospitable. A lovely experience.\n\nCueva del Soplao (Soplao Caves)\n\nLlanes to Cueva del Soplao: 46 km east on E-70 then south on CA-181\n\nThe Cueva del Soplao is a network of 250-million-year-old caves with spectacular interior formations.\n\nAlthough it is only 46 kilometers from Llanes to the Cueva, they are 46 torturous, winding and challenging kilometers.\n\nInsider tip: Give yourself twice the amount of time necessary to get to the caves. This is especially important because you need to have timed reservations in order to visit the caves.\n\nYou can buy your tickets, €13.50 for adults, at the caves but they may be sold out so buy online beforehand to ensure you get the visiting times you want.\n\nThe visits are controlled in order to protect the environment and to avoid large crowds.\n\nTo enter the caves you take a little train similar to a mine cart. You proceed in the dark, led by an employee with a flashlight until you reach a clearing.\n\nIt is at this clearing that they turn the lights on for the first time.\n\nThe first sight of the stalagmites, stalactites and crystalized formations is astonishing as you continue to other cavernous areas through winding paths. I’ve never seen anything like it.\n\nThe guide’s explanations are interesting enough for a layperson and detailed enough for someone who wants more information on the geological formations of the cave.\n\nYou return via the same train and are deposited at the gift shop (of course).\n\nJourney through Medieval Santillana del Mar\n\nCueva del Soplao to Santillana del Mar: 43 km via CA 850 and A-8\n\nContinue east to the medieval town of Santillana del Mar.\n\nSantillana is actually a few minutes from the Asturian border in the region of Cantabria but as long as you’re close by, it is worth going out of your way for.\n\nDescribed by French philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre as “the prettiest village in all Spain,” this picturesque little town of 4,000 looks much like it did in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe winding cobblestone streets are lined with perfectly -preserved stone houses dripping with flowerpots.\n\nLittle alleyways open to sunny plazas with fountains and lounging, lazy cats.\n\nThe town’s historical highlight is the Colegiata de Santa Juliana, an impressive church with accompanying cloisters.\n\nThe structure was built to house the remains of the town’s patron saint, Santa Juliana who was martyred for her faith.\n\nThe original church dates from the 9th Century, but the major structure you see today dates from the 12th Century.\n\nA good place for lunch in Santillana is El Porche Restaurant featuring local fare at decent prices. The lunch special for €14 is good value in a pleasant environment right smack in the center of town.\n\nIf you are interested in Spanish emigration to the Americas in the 19th and 20th Centuries, about 30 km west of Santillana in the town of Colombres is the “Archivos de los Indianos” or the Archives of Spanish Emigrants to the Americas.\n\nIt is a museum explaining the history of Spanish emigrants; where they came from, where they emigrated to and what their lives were like in the new world.\n\nIt has an Ellis Island feel to it. If your ancestors came from this part of the world, as mine did, you will find this exhibit fascinating.\n\nColombres\n\nAbout 30 minutes west of Santillana de la Mar is the town of Colombres.\n\nThis town houses the most important location for the study of Asturian and Spanish emigration to the Americas, the Fundación Archivo de Indianos, Museo de la Emigracion.\n\nIt is a cultural foundation for the gathering, organizing and study of Asturian emigration in the 19th and 20th Centuries.\n\nThis town and the foundation are especially significant for descendants of the Asturian emigrants, such as myself.\n\nCangas de Onis, Gateway Path to Picos de Europa\n\nSantillana del Mar to Cangas de Onis: 112 km via A-8.\n\nCangas de Onis is generally accepted to be the gateway to Picos de Europa National Park.\n\nThis is another good town to park yourself for a couple of days to see everything the area has to offer; the town, the national park and the Covadonga complex of Basilica, the holy cave, the museum and lakes.\n\nIt definitely should be part of your itinerary for Asturias.\n\nThe area of Cangas de Onis is where the Battle of Covadonga was fought marking the successful beginning of the reconquest of Spain from the Moors in 722 CE.\n\nToday the town straddles the Sella River along with the Roman Bridge, the town’s iconic symbol dating from Roman times.\n\nThe town has a pretty main street lined with flowers, open-air cafes and stores selling local artisanal products.\n\nInsider tip: Visit one of my favorite statues. One monument that stands out in Cangas is the statue of the Asturian Emigrant, a spunky character with a suitcase and eyes fixed on the distant future.\n\nWhere to stay in Cangas de Onis.\n\nPicos de Europa National Park\n\nEstablished in 1918, Picos de Europa is one of the oldest national parks in Europe.\n\nThe park is about 246 sq. km of mountain range, rushing rivers, deep gorges and even deeper caves. Eagles, vultures and wild goats are everywhere.\n\nThe occasional wolf or Cantabrian brown bear are not unknown. This is a hiker’s paradise straddling the two Spanish regions of Asturias and Leon.\n\nOne of the most popular hikes is the Cares River Trail which takes hikers over suspension bridges and through natural tunnels.\n\nI had been hearing and reading about hiking the Cares River trail in Picos de Europa National Park for years.\n\nThe park is a hiking mecca filled with breathtaking trails and home to some of the best hikes in Asturias.\n\nThe Cares River trail is said to be the most challenging, running right through the heart of the national park between the provinces of Asturias and Leon in northern Spain.\n\nThe land is crisscrossed by rivers, deep gorges and dotted with lakes, forests, and peaks, some over 7,000 feet high.\n\nThe wild landscape is vast and just stunning.\n\nHOW TO HIKE THE CARES RIVER TRAIL IN PICOS DE EUROPA\n\nThe recommended round-trip hike covers 24 kilometers.\n\nYou can start the trail in either of the two provinces. We started from Poncebos in Asturias to Cain in the province of Leon.\n\nArmed with walking sticks, a block of local cheese and a slab of bread we started out. Next time we’ll remember to bring hiking snacks.\n\nOther than the first couple of kilometers, which are very steep, the trail is easy terrain albeit high. It runs parallel to the Cares River for a good 6 to 7 hours back and forth.\n\nThe trail is alarmingly narrow in some parts high above the river which flows along the valley floor.\n\nNow and again the path takes you through small tunnels carved out of the rock and across bridges that hang precariously over the abyss.\n\nAll the while, rocky mountainsides tower up on either side of the trail.\n\nThroughout the trail we saw abundant wildlife; mountain goats, eagles and I still insist I saw what looked like a bobcat though no one else did.\n\nVultures are disturbingly pervasive. Try negotiating a narrow mountain pass several thousand feet above a plunging gorge with 10 vultures circling over your head. Talk about nerve-racking.\n\nSafely back in the village, we tried the regional specialties, goat cheese, fabada (sausage and bean casserole) and pote asturiano (bean stew with potatoes and meat).\n\nThese are heavy dishes designed to keep mountain folk going for hours during the winter months. It was delicious but made me want to sleep instead.\n\nOf course, the wine and local cider helped.\n\nThere is so much to do in this often neglected but unique part of Spain.\n\nThere are several adventure sports outfitters in the area offering rafting, caving, climbing, biking, paragliding, horseback riding, and kayaking.\n\nHere is even greater detail on the best hike in Spain’s Picos de Europa National Park.\n\nWhere to stay in Poncebos, Asturias. Where to stay in Cain, Leon.\n\nWith all that this beautiful part of Spain has to offer, I left wondering how long it would be before other travelers discovered its many charms.\n\nThe historic Covadonga route\n\nCangas de Onis to the Basilica de Covadonga: 10 km via AS 262\n\nDepending on how much of the Covadonga structures you want to see, an outing here can last from a few hours to two or three days. There are many top sites to see.\n\nThe Basilica de Santa Maria la Real de Covadonga, a very impressive church built in the late 1800s entirely of pink limestone.\n\nBesides being beautiful, the fact that such a magnificent structure was built on a mountaintop over 100 years ago, in the middle of nowhere, is remarkable.\n\nLa Santa Cueva (Holy Cave) de Covadonga. What is impressive here is the little church built directly into the cave overlooking a waterfall.\n\nAs you walk around you will marvel at this feat of engineering.\n\nThe Museum of Covadonga tells of the history of the area particularly the Spanish reconquest of 722CE from the Moors. It also displays religious works of art.\n\nThe Covadonga Lakes. This is some of the most beautiful scenery in Spain.\n\nThe area is dotted with lakes and surrounded by snow-capped mountains and rolling hills. It is perfect for hiking and photographing nature.\n\nColorful Cudillero\n\nCovadonga to Cudillero: 126 km via N-634 and A-8\n\nNow it’s time to leave the crisp mountain air of eastern Asturias and head back to the sunny beaches of the northern coast.\n\nCudillero is the quintessential Spanish fishing village. The colorful little houses crowd around the dock area and climb ever higher onto the mountainous cliffs.\n\nAn ideal afternoon is to have a fresh seafood meal in one of the town’s many waterside restaurants then walk it off exploring the winding streets and alleys of this ancient town.\n\nIf you fall in love with this picturesque fishing village, you can stay an extra day or two to hike the trails along the cliffs or walk a portion of the Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail that also passes through Cudillero.\n\nAt this point, you may have run out of time in which case you can head back to Asturias airport near the town of Aviles half an hour away.\n\nOr head to Taramundi for a trip to another world.\n\nOn your way to Taramundi from Cudillero, make sure to stop in the little town of Ribadeo, which has no great claim to fame other than being the home of the seafood restaurant, Cofradia de Rinlo.\n\nThis place is amazing! Have a meal here and you’ll see what put Ribadeo on the map.\n\nCall ahead of time to reserve and be prepared to wait. This unassuming little eatery is always packed.\n\nAccommodations in Cudillero\n\nLush, Green Taramundi\n\nCudilleros to Taramundi: 103 km via A-8\n\nWhen you are in Taramundi you are in deepest Asturias almost on the border with neighboring Galicia.\n\nHere the people speak an amalgam of Galician and Asturian different from what you hear anywhere else.\n\nThe town lies in the Turia Valley which is crisscrossed by several rivers.\n\nIt is this combination of water, sunshine and a temperate climate that gives Taramundi its lush, green appearance. The vegetation is thick and abundant.\n\nThe ancient little stone houses peek through the leafy vegetation. The rivers, creeks and rushing streams are everywhere.\n\nSounds of rushing water is heard almost everywhere you go.\n\nThe accessibility to rushing water helped Taramundi become a milling town.\n\nToday you can visit the Museo de Molinos or Mill Museum to see how mills have been operating for hundreds of years.\n\nAnother tourist attraction is the family-operated Asturian Knife Museum and shop.\n\nFor a €2 admission fee the attendants will show you how knives are made and their collection of all manner of cutlery.\n\nIn the backyard is what is billed as the “largest knife blade in the world,” a massive blade that may, indeed, live up to its reputation.\n\nWith an ever-declining population and slim commercial prospects, Taramundi has capitalized on its natural beauty.\n\nRural tourism is now the growing tourism segment.\n\nMany of the abandoned farmhouses have been turned into tourist accommodations where hikers and other nature lovers stay and wander the stunning countryside.\n\nIf you can spare a couple of days in Taramundi, do it! It will be one of your favorite spots in this itinerary for Asturias.\n\nAviles: Last stop on your 2-week itinerary for Asturias\n\nTaramundi to Aviles: 128 km via A-8\n\nSadly, you’ve come to the last leg of your 2-week itinerary for Asturias. But there is still plenty to see in Aviles, a pleasant city of 80,000 people.\n\nThe city was named after Pedro Menendez de Aviles, a Spanish conquistador who explored Florida and settled in St. Augustine, the first continuously inhabited European town in the U.S.\n\nAviles is a port town with good restaurants, wide plazas with stone arches, tree-lined avenues and interesting regional museums.\n\nThe town also has a nice collection of architecturally significant 12th and 13th Century churches like St. Thomas of Canterbury and St Nicholas of Bari.\n\nIn 2011 the city opened the Oscar Niemeyer Cultural Center Complex in the city’s estuary area.\n\nBrazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer has called the complex “an open square to humankind, a place for education, culture and peace.”\n\nThis is Aviles’ answer to Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum; a collection of architecturally unusual and unique buildings housing mostly contemporary art.\n\nIt is worth a stop during your 2-week itinerary for Asturias if you have the time.\n\nAviles is about 20 minutes from the Asturias regional airport.\n\nMost connecting flights to Madrid and other key cities leave in the morning so you might want to stay the night in Aviles. If you do, I recommend Hotel Valle de Oca.\n\nThey have parking nearby, a good restaurant and it is reasonably priced.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this itinerary for Asturias?
