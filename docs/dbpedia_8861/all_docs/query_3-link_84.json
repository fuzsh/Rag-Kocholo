        "text": "Oriente is one of the eight comarcas or administrative regions of Asturias. In terms of nature conservation efforts and biodiversity, two spaces stand out: Picos de Europa National Park and Ponga Natural Park.\n\nPicos de Europa National Park\n\nThe Picos de Europa National Park offers a rugged landscape shaped by folding and glaciation, creating a mountain karst. Bounded by deep valleys and gorges, the region is crisscrossed by rivers such as the Dobra, Deva, and Cares, forming an imposing mountain front with a geological history linked to the major orogenies of the Carboniferous and Tertiary periods. The landscape is dominated by three major mountain massifs, through which the main rivers flow via narrow canyons.\n\nThe Central Massif harbors the highest peaks in the Cantabrian Mountains, including the iconic Picu Urriellu (also known as Naranjo de Bulnes). To the east, the Eastern Massif offers a gentler profile, while the western part—known as Picos del Cornión—features emblematic sites like the Enol and Ercina Lakes, near the Royal Site of Covadonga.\n\nThe flora in this extreme environment includes shrubs, grasslands, and forests of beech, oak, and lime trees. These colorful trails wind through the summits, where the high-mountain climate and temperature variations define the ecosystem.\n\nThe fauna is diverse and unique. It hosts birds such as the golden eagle, vultures, and Egyptian vultures, as well as capercaillie and mallards. In the high mountains, you’ll find chamois, roe deer, partridges, and wild boars. The rivers are home to otters, trout, and salmon, while limestone caves provide shelter for bats and owls.\n\nPonga Natural Park\n\nPonga Natural Park, located in the central-eastern region of Asturias, stands out for its exceptional environmental diversity and remarkable conservation efforts. Bounded by the imposing Cantabrian Mountains to the south and the Ponga Ridge to the west, its landscape is adorned with majestic peaks like Peña Ten and Tiatordos. The park is crisscrossed by the Sella and Ponga rivers, their narrow valleys and impressive gorges—such as the Desfiladero del Ponga and the Beyos Gorge—adding drama to its natural beauty.\n\nPonga Natural Park is characterized by extensive mature forests that cover 37% of its territory. These forests include beech groves, oak forests, birch stands, and ash woodlands. The landscape also features meadows, pastures, and heathlands—all shaped by ancestral land use practices. Within the park, the Peloño Partial Nature Reserve safeguards a vast expanse of beech trees, further enhancing its conservation value.\n\nThe park's fauna is equally remarkable. It is home to emblematic species such as the brown bear, otters, and desman (a semi-aquatic mole). The avifauna includes the Cantabrian capercaillie, as well as various raptors like the golden eagle and griffon vulture.\n\nIn summary, these natural spaces stand as a true treasure, where the beauty of the landscape harmonizes with exceptional biodiversity and dedicated conservation efforts.\n\nOther great places to visit in this most eastern part of Asturias are Cabrales with its famous cheese, the former capital of the Kingdom of Asturias Cangas de Onis and the picturesque coastal towns Llanes and Ribadesella.\n\nWe organize the following activities in the Oriente, including Picos de Europa and Ponga Natural Park:\n\nNorthern Spain is a great place for observing birds because of its high density of different ecosystems and habitats. During our birding trips and guided tours in Asturias and Northern Spain, you get the chance to discover new high mountain range or coastal species.\n\nTwo of Asturias’ most iconic species are the Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) and the Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus). The number of Western Capercaillies rapidly declined in recent years. Resultantly, they are strongly protected. Access to their last breeding grounds is therefore restricted. The reintroduction of the Bearded Vulture in the Picos de Europa National Park, however, is successful. You can now observe this impressive raptor in several places.\n\nDo you want to spot the Bearded Vulture? See some of Northern Spain´s other majestic raptors such as the Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) or Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)? Or are you more interested in discovering typical alpine birds like the Wall Creeper (Tichodroma muraria)? Or perhaps you want to discover migratory birds along the Cantabrian seashore in spring or autumn?\n\nOur birding trips and guided tours in Asturias and Northern Spain allow you to discover new species in the beautiful Northern Spanish nature!
