        "text": "Oviedo/Uviéu could be called the city of Pre-Romanesque, as it has the most monuments from this period in all of Asturias, both in the city center and its surroundings. If we are in the heart of the urban area, magnificent examples include some details of the old Church of San Tirso El Real, the Church of San Julián de los Prados – also known as Santullano – or the Foncalada Fountain, whose moss-covered stones and flowing waters exude antiquity. A very special mention is reserved for the Holy Chamber, created by the great Asturian monarch Alfonso II.\n\nMoreover, in the greenest and most panoramic surroundings of Oviedo/Uviéu, at the base of the renowned Monte Naranco, you will find two incredible gems: Santa María del Naranco and San Miguel de Lillo. In this area, you will also find the Reception and Interpretation Center of Asturian Pre-Romanesque, located in former schools, which serves to provide travelers with information about the importance and historical context of these monuments.\n\nSo on Mount Naranco, amidst impressive aerial views of the city and a large part of the central mountainous area of Asturias, you can experience Pre-Romanesque Art in all its plenitude.\n\nSince then, the Fontán has undergone many changes. Its past as a comedy theatre or as a centre for social gatherings has been left behind, but its soul remains unscathed. The Fontán is still one of the liveliest and most frequented places in the city, especially during market hours. As if that were not enough, very close by is the Plaza de Abastos and also the Plaza del Ayuntamiento, and the church of San Isidoro.\n\nSo, the whole area around El Fontán is a coming and going of people watching, shopping, chatting or looking for a place to have a vermouth, to have lunch, a snack or dinner, to have a glass of cider, or to buy the best local products.\n\nThe Fontan, for ever and ever, remains faithful to the spirit that created it...\n\nOviedo's cathedral is a universal and primordial reference point on the Pilgrim's Way to Santiago, so the continuous and incessant presence of pilgrims, like an eternal trickle, is not surprising. Nor is the curiosity aroused by the Holy Chamber - a World Heritage Site - which still conserves the essence of a palatine chapel, as conceived by Alfonso II himself, and which today houses the relics and jewels of the ancient Asturian monarchy, a pioneer of western European Christianity.\n\nOne of the most attractive options for getting to know the cathedral is the visit to the gothic tower of the Sancta Ovetensis, which lasts approximately one hour and will be a unique experience. The groups that climb the tower will make two stops before reaching the end of the route. The first will be at the body of the clock's counterweights: visitors will climb 56 steps up the tower's spiral staircase to this point, where they will be able to contemplate Menéndez Pidal's moulds. The second stop will be at the bell tower, presided over by the Wamba, which they will reach after climbing another 67 steps. From there, and after 61 more steps, visitors will reach the great attraction of these ascents: the Renaissance body, which allows a 360-degree view and offers a privileged view of Oviedo, given that at this point, the elevation is 43 and a half metres above the ground. Moreover, in this Renaissance body, it will be possible to take photographs and contemplate, from inside, the spectacular openwork arrow that crowns the tower;\n\nWith so many sensations, you will realise that a walk through this \"regia sedes\" is almost like walking through the clouds, because in very few square metres you will discover five towers, which are the testimony of how the city and Asturias arose and evolved over centuries and centuries. The five towers of this \"regia sedes\", which can be discovered with a careful look around the old quarter, are Santa María La Real de la Corte, adjacent to the convent of Las Pelayas, which also has its tower; the Romanesque tower of the cathedral, as well as its Gothic tower, and the tower of San Tirso el Real, a church founded by Alfonso II el Casto and which still conserves the oldest alfiz - moulding that supports a pre-Romanesque arch - in western European Christianity .\n\nFive towers in a short circular route give the city a historical, medieval, Renaissance and eighteenth-century air; an eclectic air that is unique in Europe.\n\nWhile we follow the royal trail, some artistic remains in the form of sculptures show us the literary soul of an Oviedo/Uviéu that has inspired novelists such as Leopoldo Alas \"Clarín\", Ramón Pérez de Ayala or Armando Palacio Valdés...\n\nThe \"regia sedes\" has not lost any of its essence, and today it continues to be an inescapable muse for many creators...\n\nProof that Oviedo/Uviedo is a city of art and with art is its Museum of Fine Arts, Recently refurbished and enlarged, it exhibits, in completely new exhibition spaces, a more than interesting collection of art from different historical periods up to the contemporary avant-garde.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts, located in the heart of the historic quarter, with part of its façade overlooking the Cathedral Square, is art in itself. In its case, one can safely say that the art is not only in its exhibition contents but also in the container.\n\nA mixture of classical and contemporary architecture, in a framework of thoughtful design for important works of Spanish art, in a visit that is deeply enjoyable and surprising.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias currently exhibits 782 works, which constitute a journey through the history of art from the 14th to the 21st century, and where we find works by such renowned geniuses as El Greco - with a specific room for his Apostolate -, Goya, Zurbarán, Murillo, Sorolla, Picasso, Dalí, Barceló and an endless number of artists who have written the most glorious pages of Spanish art.\n\nAnd when it comes to socializing, Oviedo/Uviéu is the ideal city. It has everything: lively cafes, traditional taverns ('chigres'), traditional restaurants, designer venues, bar-shops, gourmet stores, cider bars, wine cellars, and more. So much so that if any area epitomizes the cider tradition of the capital and its savoir-faire in this matter, it's the famous Gascona Street, also known as the Cider Boulevard, bustling at all hours of the day and night, frequented by both locals and visitors alike.\n\nOviedo/Uviéu also has its area, its route, for those looking to enjoy some wine, in the vicinity of Campoamor and Manuel Pedregal streets. Here, you'll find well-themed establishments with careful designs.\n\nAnother gourmet area is Avenida de Galicia and the surrounding area.\n\nHowever, any corner of the city, as well as its neighbourhoods, are pleasant places to indulge in the good gastronomic life, including the Asturian \"espicha\".\n\nIn Oviedo/Uviéu you will never lack a place to drink and eat well, and nice people to socialise with or to serve you.\n\nAnd one of those occasions to enjoy the city to the fullest is during Holy Week, where you'll encounter not only lively festivities but also interesting cultural and gastronomic activities.\n\nAnd if you want to book accommodation you can do it easily in our section of Online booking!"
