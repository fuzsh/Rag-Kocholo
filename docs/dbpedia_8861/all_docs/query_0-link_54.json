Experience this “natural paradise” in the mountains, rivers, lakes, and beaches surrounding this lush green city. Explore the pedestrian streets and plazas near the historic Cathedral de San Salvador; explore the Calle Gascona and drink traditional sidra; visit the Pre-Romanesque monuments of nearby Mt. Naranco. Discover the city that has been described as: “a delicious, exotic, and beautiful city, as if it belonged to another world, something similar to a fairy tale.” With its cosmopolitan air and lively nightlife thriving alongside the traditions of the city’s Celtic roots, Oviedo is your doorway to Northern Spain past and present. Surrounded by stunning countryside, Oviedo’s monumental Old Quarter, its Gothic cathedral of San Salvador and 400-year old University are the perfect setting to experience Spanish language, society, and culture.\n\nPrograms in Oviedo\n\nTravel-Based Programs in Oviedo\n\nFor Students\n\nStart planning your experience abroad!

Oviedo is a city of 225,000 and the capital of the Principality of Asturias, a region of Spain with distinct cultural and artistic history. Over 30% of the region is occupied by national parks and protected areas, including five UNESCO Biosphere Reserves. The history of Asturias began with Celtic roots, and when the Moors conquered much of Spain, this was the only part of the Iberian Peninsula that remained Christian. The Camino de Santiago runs through this area—the launch point for the “Reconquista” as the reconquering of modern Spain is known. Today the region is billed as a “natural paradise” and offers gastronomic and cultural traditions somewhat in contrast to traditional ideas of “Spain.\" Oviedo, along with the nearby cities of Gijon and Aviles, are clean, compact, walkable and easily accessible by a range of public transportation. English-speaking tourists are rare in this part of Spain, making this a perfect place to study Spanish and make use of it in daily life.\n\nAccommodations\n\nStudents usually live with experienced host families, and one student per family is the norm. All host families offer a private room for their students, as well as shared laundry facilities, meals, and Wi-Fi. Accommodation through the residence halls at the University of Oviedo is also available in the summer. The residence halls feature single rooms with en-suite bathrooms, as well as a student cafeteria where meal plans can be purchased individually by students or arranged for groups. Faculty can be housed with a host family or in a local apartment on request.\n\nPotential Excursions\n\nIn Oviedo, the city’s Gothic Cathedral and its Holy Chamber; Oviedo Opera; Oviedo Festival of Lyric Theater; companies specializing in sustainable construction or urbanism; farms, markets, and facilities focused on the “slow food” lifestyle movement and farm-to-table food production; various local festivals and events featuring Asturian culture, dance, and music.\n\nOne day-excursions: Aviles, Gijon, Shrine of Lady of Covadonga, pre-Romanesque monuments (distinguished as UNESCO World Heritage sites), Basilica of St. James in Santiago; Neanderthal caves and cave paintings, such as the Tito Bustillo caves and others (designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites); Roman ruins, including battle sites, roads, mines and a Roman villa of Veranes near Gijon.\n\nWeekend excursions are available to sites throughout Spain, including Madrid, Galicia, Sevilla, Malaga, Barcelona, Santander, Salamanca, and the Camino de Santiago.\n\nLearn more about GEO excursions in Oviedo.\n\nExperiential Learning\n\nOviedo offers a wide variety of service-learning and volunteer opportunities from which to choose. Faculty on short-term programs can opt to have students visit several organizations to get an overview of the work they do and their processes. For long-term programs, a single service-learning placement for each student allows on-going, in-depth volunteer opportunities regularly over several weeks. Long-term placements are not available for programs less than a month in length. Opportunities are available in fields such as health, education, tourism, horse therapy, community services, development, and more.\n\nCenter Features\n\nOne classroom with capacity for 20 students\n\nReference library with 500+ books for class topics and travel, as well as 200+ Spanish films\n\nWorkspace for visiting faculty: Wi-fi, shared computers and printer/fax/copier/scanner\n\nClassroom equipment: whiteboard, DVD player, projector with DVD and laptop connectors, and a portable CD/cassette player\n\nStudent computer access: Two desktops.
