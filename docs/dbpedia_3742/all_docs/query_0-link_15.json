        "text": "NEW YORK, June 24 -- A New York City woman admitted in court Monday that she murdered her 6-year-old daughter in a case that sparked nationwide outrage and prompted the state Legislature to institute reforms in New York's child abuse laws. With tears streaming down her face in Manhattan state Supreme Court, Awilda Lopez pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Elisa Izquierdo in exchange for a recommended sentence of 15 years to life.\n\nThe first-grader died Nov. 22, 1995 after her crack-addicted mother threw her against a wall because she believed she was possessed by the devil. The state found that dozens of teachers, relatives and neighbors reported to authorities their suspicions over the years that the little girl was being abused, but no one intervened. The child abuse death sparked a shake-up in the child welfare system and prompted Elisa's Law, a new state child protection law named for the youngster. Under the new law state agencies are allowed to open sealed, unfounded reports of child abuse, and social services commissioners are allowed to make information about abuse or maltreatment public if the public has a legitimate interest in the case. Lopez, who tried to kill herself while in jail, will be sentenced July 31. In a television interview two months ago, Lopez denied killing Elisa. She said her boyfriend, who was charged with endangerment and attempted assault, beat the child to death."
