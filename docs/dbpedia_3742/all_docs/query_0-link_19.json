        "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 12 -- Less than three months after 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo was beaten to death in her Manhattan apartment, New York Gov. George Pataki has signed into law a measure named after the little girl that will lift the veil of confidentiality in some child abuse cases. Pataki signed 'Elisa's Law' Monday at a ceremony in Manhattan attended by social workers, educators and relatives who had reported the chronic abuse Izquierdo allegedly suffered at the hands of her mother and stepfather.\n\nThe first-grader died Nov. 22, after her crack-addicted mother allegedly threw her against a wall because she believed she was possessed by the devil. The city Child Welfare Administration has refused to release details of complaints about Izquierdo's home situation or the steps taken to protect the little girl, citing confidentiality laws. Under the new law state agencies will be allowed to open sealed, unfounded reports of child abuse and social services commissioners will be allowed to make information about abuse or maltreatment public if 'the public has a legitimate interest in the case.' The law also prevents child protection agencies from expunging unfounded reports of child abuse until the youngest child named in the report is 28 years old. Backers of the bill said weakening the confidentiality rules would prevent ineffective child welfare agencies from hiding their mistakes behind a veil of secrecy. 'Today, we take an important first step by knocking down the wall of secrecy in the child protective services system that has failed our children,' Pataki said. The governor said the system 'horribly failed' Elisa. 'In this and other cases, we can now go back and see where in that bureaucratic system it broke down, so we can fix it,' Pataki said."
