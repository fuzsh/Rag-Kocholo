Elisa's mom By BARBARA ROSS and DON GENTILE Daily News Staff Writers Sobbing and hysterical, Awilda Lopez yesterday apologized for beating and torturing her tiny daughter, Elisa Izquierdo, to death, then was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. \"Lisa, I'm sorry for whatev- what she did finally hit her toer happened to you and for day,\" said her lawyer, Daniel what all your brothers and sis- Ollen, outside the courtroom. ters are going through,\" Lopez A crackhead when she was wailed as she stood before arrested last November, LoManhattan Supreme Court pez, 29, had previously exJustice Alvin Schlesinger. pressed little remorse over Then she screamed and bur- the tragic end of 6-year-old ied her face in her arms .\n\nElisa \"I think the magnitude of Pleading guilty to second- Royster Sr. wants to help son in court By BARBARA ROSS and DON GENTILE Daily News Staff Writers The jailed killer dad of crime spree suspect John Royster wants to take over his son's legal affairs. Though he hasn't seen his son in 10 years, John J. Royster has written to the courts from his upstate jail cell asking that he be appointed his son's legal guardian and put in charge of his affairs. The younger Royster is charged with the murder of dry cleaner Evalin Alvarez, the brutal sexual assault on a young pianist in Central Park and the beating of a woman on the East Side .\n\nIf convicted, he could face the death penalty. His dad said court-appointed attorneys are not doing enough for his boy. Those lawyers, says the elder Royster, have not prevented police from \"parading through the streets and courts like a Vietnam prisoner of war of the Cong.\" He said the authorities have also inspired a \"proliferation of slanderous and infamous 15 to life degree murder last month, Lopez admitted smashing the child's head against a concrete wall, then letting her lie unattended for two days.

Attorney Mitchell Dinnerstein, of the Capital Defender's Office, sloughed off the elder Roster's claims. \"We're interested in providing John with the best possible representation,\" Dinnerstein said. The elder Royster, serving a life sentence for the 1989 shotgun slaying of a former girlfriend on a midtown subway platform, has a reputation as a jailhouse lawyer. tional attention and led to reforms in the state's child welfare laws .\n\nChildren such as \"Elisa, the babies, the most vulnerable of us all,\" have no lobbyists to get the attention of lawmakers, said Schlesinger. \"As a result, the amount of money they receive is small,\" he said. \"It results in agencies hiring insufficiently educated and trained people, too many nine-to-fivers. \"If anything is to be learned from this awful, this horrendous tragedy, is that we some prioritie: to these babies.\" Patricia Stevens, a spokesman for the Montessori School that Elisa once attended -in Brooklyn, agreed with Schlesinger, lambasting the Family Court judge who returned Elisa to Lopez and noting that not one city child welfare official was in court yesterday. \"They helped kill her as far as we're concerned,\" she said .\n\nLopez' common-law husband, Carlos Lopez, faces lesser charges in the girl's death. media activities\" that result in \"flowers and hearts portrayals of the assault victims designed to inflame public lynching appetites.\" Saying Royster's mother, Lynese Sykes Royster, has \"abandoned\" their son, the jailed dad said he wants to handle the affairs of the son he lost custody of in court years ago. The unusual request, made in court papers filed last month, has caught prosecutors and defense attorneys off guard. The petition will be heard in several weeks, after it is assigned to a civil court judge. Normally, guardians are appointed for grown children when the children are mentally disabled, brain-damaged or otherwise unable to fend for themselves .\n\nThe elder Royster does not make such an argument about his 22-year-old son but states merely that he alone has his son's best interests at heart \"as the lawful father\" and \"possessor of great love and affection and devotion\" for the accused killer.
