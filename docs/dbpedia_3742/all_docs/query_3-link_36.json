        "text": "It's already the most expensive, possibly most problematic computer system in state history. And if Gov. George Pataki has his way, it's about to cost taxpayers even more.\n\nPataki has budgeted another $66 million in state and federal money for \"Connections,\" the child-welfare computer system that's already cost $76 million more than what state officials originally projected.\n\nThe added money is supposed to solve many of the problems that have plagued the largest Microsoft network in the world.\n\nBut while virtually everyone agrees that improvements are needed, some are wondering why the cost was allowed to spiral so out of control, leaving a system that some officials say is still so fundamentally flawed.\n\nThe best of intentions\n\nBy linking every child-welfare office and family court in the state, Connections was an ambitious attempt to save abused children before they became lost in the maze of child-welfare bureaucracy.\n\nUltimately, it was supposed to help investigators keep track of cases originating from the state child-abuse hot line, and put an end to misplaced case files, botched paper work and the kind of gaps in jurisdiction that contributed to the 1995 death of Elisa Izquierdo, the 6-year-old New York City girl for whom Elisa's Law was named. The law gave child-protective workers access to unfounded reports of abuse, which previously had been destroyed even though they often contained information that could have helped investigators establish a pattern of abuse.\n\nLast January, however, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall released the results of an audit confirming what a Times Herald-Record investigation had found four months earlier: Nearly two years after the central data bank was installed in Albany and some 14,000 computers were distributed across the state, the system routinely lost information provided by people who called the child-abuse hot line, and forced operators to hand-write reports as a backup, keeping some callers on hold. Background checks on prospective day-care workers and foster and adoptive parents also had to be delayed for months because the workers who normally did the checks were temporarily transferred to help with the hot line's backlog.\n\nToday, a year after the release of McCall's report and nearly 18 months after The Record's investigation, Connections still does only about half of what it's ultimately supposed to do. Right now, it's equipped to handle child-abuse and -neglect investigations, and certifications for foster and adoptive homes. But information pertaining to children who've been placed in foster care and families who receive services intended to prevent abuse and neglect still is not part of the system.\n\nWhat Connections has managed to do, local officials say, is increase, rather than reduce, the amount of time caseworkers have to spend on office work. Often, they have to go through multiple screens just to perform the simplest tasks, from looking information up in the system to logging it in. And in this business, more time in front of the computer screen means less time in the field monitoring families.\n\n\"It's still extremely slow and cumbersome,\" said Margaret Kirchner, Orange County's social-services commissioner. \"Computers can be such time-savers, and this was touted to be just that. But in this case, the reality has turned out to be exactly the opposite.\"\n\nIn spite of all that, the two companies that designed Connections - IBM and Andersen Consulting, Inc. - have already been paid $200 million for a computer system that was originally designed for Texas, where caseloads are smaller and the laws less complex.\n\nMcCall's auditors found state officials here were aware of problems with the Texas model when they bought the system, but didn't insist that they be corrected early on.\n\nWill more money help?\n\nSandra Brown, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Children and Family Services, said the $66 million more Pataki has proposed spending on Connections should solve many of its problems.\n\n\"We continue to work closely with the local districts to make enhancements to the system,\" Brown said. \"We are confident we are building an efficient and effective system.\"\n\nNeither she, nor the governor, nor the office's commissioner, John Johnson, would answer specific questions, however, regarding Connections' cost overruns and other problems, or provide a time frame for its completion or ultimate cost.\n\nRight now, caseworkers can use Connections to e-mail each other, which can save time, said Lynn Carlson, Ulster's child-protective supervisor. But the system still isn't always reliable, she said, when it comes to things as important as finding records of prior complaints against someone who's allegedly abused or neglected a child.\n\nZachary Zambri, the new project manager heading a team of 59 people who are supposed to turn Connections around, declined to comment on the system, citing office protocol, which bars most employees from speaking to the press. But at a meeting in Albany earlier this month, he reassured social-service commissioners from around the state.\n\n\"He owned that they had made some really bad mistakes, mainly because they didn't have the money and the staff,\" said Barbara Sorkin, Ulster County's director of services. \"I may be a little Pollyanna-ish. But I did come away thinking things might be back on track.\""
