        "text": "Despite being born prematurely and addicted to crack, little Elisa Izquierdo eventually grew into a beautiful, thriving child when she was removed from her mother Awilda Lopez' custody and cared for by her father, Cuban-born Gustavo Izquierdo.\n\nFrom all reports, Gustavo was a totally devoted parent and worked long hours at a homeless shelter to ensure he could provide a safe, happy home for Elisa; when she was two he enrolled her into a Montesorri preschool and paid fees for Elisa to be involved in all the extra-curricular activities on hand. Her teachers were so taken by her intelligence and charm that they arranged for her to meet Prince Michael of Greece (pictured with Elisa) who was a benefactor of the school; he too was enchanted by Elisa, so much so that he offered to pay her full tuition and education fees right up to college.\n\nIn 1994, when Eliza was five, she began having unsupervised visits with her mother Awilda, who claimed to have kicked her drug habit and was eager to have joint custody of her. Gustavo successfully managed to retain sole custody of Elisa, and made plans to move back to his native Cuba so Elisa could continue to thrive; tragically, Gustavo was diagnosed with cancer shortly after his daughter's birthday, and died before he could make the trip. Elisa was forced to go live with her mother despite numerous reports against Awilda of drug abuse and violence towards her other children.\n\nMere weeks after her father died, Elisa began showing up to school covered in bruises and scratches. Her teachers said she became withdrawn and lost all her toilet training, wetting herself frequently. When one tutor complained to child services Awilda simply removed Elisa and kept her at home. Three more complaints of child abuse were made but never followed up, an oversight that would have terrible repercussions.\n\nTrapped at home with her mother (who was frequently strung out on crack) Elisa was subjected to horrific abuse lasting over a year. Awilda would later confess that she kept her daughter locked in a closet for hours at a time, starved her, beat her daily with a belt buckle, and sexually violated her with a toothbrush. Elisa was rarely seen by neighbors, but they often heard her pleading with her mother to stop hitting her while Awilda screamed abuse.\n\nOn November 22, 1995, Awilda rang a neighbor and asked her to take a look at Elisa, now 6, who she said was \"lying retarded on the bed\" and wouldnt take food. The neighbor entered a squalid bedroom to find the battered little girl face down, with blood and fluid leaking from her ears. She immediately called an ambulance, and while paramedics tried to revive Elisa the police arrested her mother.\n\nIn custody Awilda admitted she had thrown Elisa against a concrete wall, punched her in the face, forced her to eat her own feces, and slammed her head against the floor. She put Elisa on the bed and waited two days for her to move or talk before calling the neighbor. Elisa was pronounced dead on arrival, from injuries consistent with systemic abuse and multiple blows to the head that caused a brain hemorrhage. At her funeral, her casket remained open and a Barbie doll given to her by her beloved father was placed in her hand.\n\nAwilda Lopez pled guilty to second-degree murder and recieved life in prison with a minimum term of 15 years. She remains incarcerated as of 2019. The judge at her sentencing hearing called Elisa's death \"the worst case of child abuse he'd ever seen\". The nationwide publicity after her murder led to major reforms in how child welfare authorities respond to allegations of child abuse."
