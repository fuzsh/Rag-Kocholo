        "text": "Elisa was abused and killed by her mother, she was only 6 years old.\n\nTwo days before Elisa died her mother slammed her head into a concrete wall.\n\nHer mother believed that Elisa was possessed by the devil, she told police that\n\nshe forced her daughter to eat her own feces, and that she also used her\n\ndaughters head to mop the floor. Her mother also violated her with a toothbrush,\n\nand a hairbrush. She would call her little girl a mongoloid and a filthy little whore..\n\nPolice said that there was no part of her little body that was not cut or bruised.\n\nSome of her fingers were broken and there were burn marks from a cigarette.\n\nAwilda Lopez, 29 years old was charged with murder and child endangerment.\n\nShe was sentenced to 15 years to life. Elisa's stepfather pleaded guilty\n\nto assault charges in an incident that occurred before the fatal beating.\n\nHe received a sentence of 1 1/2 to 3 years in prison.\n\nPlease adopt a guardian angel for Elisa\n\nclick on the angel\n\nOr you can light a candle\n\nThank you for being the\n\ncaring person to read the story of\n\nElisa"
