        "text": "Women filmmakers are taking the reins of their destinies in Hollywood, with many stepping behind the camera and creating stories universal to the human condition. However, it has been a slow-moving machine to see these talents recognized at the Oscars, especially in the Best Director category.\n\nIn the 96-year history of the Academy Awards, 601 films have been nominated for the top prize for best picture. Twenty-two of those films were helmed by a woman director. While the statistic is startling, there has been an uptick in female-led stories being told and gaining notoriety.\n\nLooking at the 2024 Oscars stats:\n\nWomen filmmakers hit a milestone with this year’s 2024 Oscar nominations. For the first time in history, three of the 10 movies nominated for best picture — Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall,” Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Celine Song’s “Past Lives” — were directed by a female auteur, the most recognized in the Academy Awards’ 96-year history. Five years have included two films directed by women among the best picture nominees: 2009, 2010, 2020, 2021 and 2023.\n\nWomen also produced seven of the 10 nominated movies. Those include Stone, Robbie, Emma Thomas (“Oppenheimer”), Marie-Ange Luciani (“Anatomy of a Fall”), Amy Durning and Kristie Macosko Krieger (“Maestro”), Ewa Puszczynska (“The Zone of Interest”) and Pamela Koffler and Christine Vachon (“Past Lives”).\n\nThe biggest year for best picture noms for movies produced by women was 2019, delivering eight films with female producers attached, including Kwak Sin-ae, who would become the first woman of color to win best picture for the non-English language movie “Parasite.” All other years had six or fewer.\n\nHowever, to date, eight women have been nominated for directing: Lina Wertmüller (“Seven Beauties”), Jane Campion (“The Piano” and “The Power of the Dog”), Sofia Coppola (“Lost in Translation”), Kathryn Bigelow (“The Hurt Locker”), Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”), Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”), Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Justine Triet (“Anatomy of a Fall”).\n\nBelow, find the list of all 22 women-directed movies that were nominated for the Oscars’ top prize: best picture."
