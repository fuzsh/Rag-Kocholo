        "text": "Fandom Name: Wiseguy Abbreviation(s): WG Creator: Stephen J. Cannell, Frank Lupo Date(s): 1987-1990, 1996 Medium: television series & TV movie Country of Origin: US External Links: IMDB, Wikipedia page,\n\nClick here for related articles on Fanlore.\n\nWiseguy was a show based around Vinnie Terranova, an undercover Fed, and his irascible handler, Frank McPike.\n\nEach new undercover assignment set up an arc of episodes, unusually so for its era; there were roughly two arcs per season, filled out with occasional standalone eps. Each arc introduced new bad guys.\n\nThe show had just started its second arc in the fourth season when it was cancelled.\n\nThe show lasted three years in its original form; another 1/2 year of 4th season after Vinnie's actor left. At the time the show was on the air, TV Guide mentioned the homoeroticism of the plots.\n\nIn 1996, ABC aired a reunion movie. Wikipedia has a good Wiseguy article\n\nArcs\n\nSteelgrave arc -- Vinnie/Steelgrave is (almost) canon by the final ep of the arc\n\nProfitt arc -- Vinnie is sent to take down Mel Profitt and his sister/lover Susan (Vinnie is canonically involved with Susan); meets Roger Lococco\n\nWhite Supremacy arc -- former Senator Fred Thompson was the bad guy in this arc\n\nGarment industry (aka Rag Trade) arc (Vinnie is hurt in hospital; they bring in a new Wiseguy)\n\nDead Dog (aka Music industry) arc - Tim Curry plays the bad guy\n\n2nd Mafia (aka Mob Wars) arc -- Vinnie has a girlfriend this arc\n\nWashington D.C. arc -- Mr Terranova goes to Washington\n\nLynchboro-Seattle arc -- Vinnie freaks out, does a runner\n\nFinding Vinnie\n\nThe Fandom\n\nWiseguy was primarily a slash fandom, based around four characters: the titular Wiseguy, Vinnie Terranova, an undercover fed; his handler, Frank McPike, his first mark, Sonny Steelgrave, and another morally-wounded undercover agent he runs into in his second case, Roger Lococco.\n\nPossibly because the show's writing was so good, and because arcs don't leave the narrative holes that episodic television does, possibly because of the multiple pairings, possibly because there was not much of a gen fandom to lean on, the slash fandom never grew that large.\n\nTashery Shannon wrote a slashy guide to Wiseguy for her zine Risk (A Multimedia slash zine featuring Wiseguy and Blakes 7).\n\nPairings\n\nWith the exception of a few Roger/Frank stories, virtually all pairings are Vinnie/someone else.\n\nOnline\n\nIn 1996, the Media Monitor had an ad for the TerrSitLst, a mailing list for readers of the lengthy Wiseguy novel The Terranova Situation. It featured discussions of the novel and occasional fiction.\n\nIn 1996, the Media Monitor also listed a Wiseguy fan site that offered: \"2 cast photos (1 from the series and 1 from the recent TV movie), an episode guide, filmographies of the series' stars, and more.\" An archived copy can be found here.\n\nSmall Wiseguy slash fan fiction archives were set up here and here in the late 1990s.\n\nNotable Stories and Zines\n\nA River That Runs Both Ways -- a slash novel by Melody C., the sequel is A Consortium of Light\n\nMcPikus Interruptus #1-3, anthology zine published by Manacles Press\n\nRisk, anthology zine published by Tashery Shannon, 1/2 Wiseguy, 1/2 Blake's 7\n\nSanctuary - anthology zine published by April Valentine\n\nKnocking Over The Table by astolat -- with art by X\n\nThe Terranova Situation, epic zine novel series\n\nFor a more complete list see Wiseguy/Fanzines.\n\nNotable Vids\n\nStrong Enough by Jill -- an awesome early Vinnie/Sonny vid (1990s)\n\nNobody's Side by JAC aka Judy Chien -- excellent Roger, Roger/Vinnie vid (1990s)\n\nLives in the Balance by Media Cannibals -- excellent Roger vid (1990s)\n\nSweetest Perfection by Media Cannibals -- great and creepy Mel and Susan vid (1990s)\n\nCan't Keep a Good Man Down by Media Cannibals -- the definitive Sonny vid (1990s)\n\nWicked Game by Lynn C. - a Vinnie/Sonny vid that captures their complicated obsession (1990s)\n\nNights in White Satin by Lynn C. and Tashery Shannon - an impressive blending in music and soundtrack in the analog era to retell the arc of Sonny and Vinnie's relationship (1990s)\n\nPlay Me Backwards by Gayle F. and Morgan Dawn - a Vinnie character study vid that focuses in his nervous breakdown (1990s)\n\nJumping Jack Flash by Gayle F. - excellent Sonny character study vid with great cutting (1990s)\n\nTake Me Out by Barkley and Destina -- Vinnie/Sonny masterpiece (2000s)\n\nSample Fanart\n\nArt by Suzan Lovett is here, and includes: \"Diamonds and Rust,\" \"The Justinians,\" \"Awakenings,\" \"Life's A Lemon and I Want My Money Back,\" \"Wear Leather -- Love Ya, Babe,\" \"Taking Care of Baby,\" \"The Outsider,\" \"Angels Won't Mind,\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me.\"\n\ncover of Sanctuary #1, Suzan Lovett\n\ncover of Awakenings #1, by Suzan Lovett\n\nby Suzan Lovett.
