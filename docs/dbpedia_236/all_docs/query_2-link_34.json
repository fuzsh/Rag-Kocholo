        "text": "Pan ARRI 35 II C\n\nThis Pan ARRI 35 II C camera is offered as shown, with Panavision iris rods, a Panavision follow focus, and a Panavision matte box, as well as a bigger, brighter magnifying eyepiece, and an Arriflex constant speed motor. It also comes with a recreation of the original Pan-ARRI logo, as well as the wonderfully convenient and brilliantly designed Ted Rae top carry handle.\n\nOriginal Slate from \"How The West Was Won\" (1962)\n\nShown here is an original 3-panel slate from the epic western adventure âHow the West Was Wonâ (1962) shot in Cinerama out of the collection of veteran cinematographer John Hora. Cinerama was a widescreen format that made use of an amazing piece of engineering that incorporated 3 separate film transports and lens assemblies to shoot 3 synchronized film panels at the same time. These were later projected simultaneously to make up the widescreen image. âHow the West Was Wonâ, produced by MGM, was directed by John Ford, Henry Hathaway, and George Marshall (who appears on this slate) and starred James Stewart, John Wayne, Gregory Peck, Henry Fonda, and Debbie Reynolds, among many others. A very cool piece of movie history!\n\nWilart Professional Camera\n\nI am delighted to share with you all this fascinating, extremely rare, ca. 1921 Wilart Camera restored by my good friend Michael Madden. This camera features durable, all-metal construction, an automatic shutter, and behind-the-lens slots for split screen, spyglass, keyhole, and other effects masks. The camera also features an ingenious critical focusing tube that allows the cinematographer to view and compose through a single frame of film without fogging any of the adjacent frames. Additional features include footage and frame counters, a micrometer-based focus control that synced focus between the finder lens and the taking lens, automatic light traps on the magazine, along with a variety of other forward thinking features unique to the Wilart camera.\n\nArriflex BL 4S\n\nThe final entry in the venerable Arriflex 35 BL series of cameras, the ARRI 35 BL 4S is a remarkable production tool, and one of my personal favortie cameras. The BL 4S is easily hand-holdable, or can be mounted on a geared head or a fluid head. It has a variety of operator-friendly features, including interchngeable ARRI Glow ground glasses, long and short orientable viewfinders, heated eye cup, pistol grip with remote on/off, PL lens mount, and variable pitch control.\n\nArriflex BL 2 camera with Cooke Speed Panchro lenses\n\nFollowing up on the successful introduction of the Arriflex 35mm BL camera, the ARRI BL 2 improved on the original design by adding a brighter viewfinder, video tap optics, digital footage/frame counter and tachometer, and making the operation of the camera quieter while keeping the form factor small and light. The ARRI BL 2 was a smash success for ARRI, as it was one of the earliest sound silent, hand-held, pin registered cameras on the market. The BL series of cameras embraced a versatile design philosophy, with the camera being easily used hand-held or mounted on a geared head. Package includes 3 Cooke Speed Panchro lenses.\n\nBell & Howell 2709 #1015\n\nBell & Howell 2709 #1015 was originally sold to the United States Department of the Interior on June 13, 1936. Sometime in its career it was converted to a rackover L base by Camera Equipment Company. Research into this camera's history is ongoing. The Bell & Howell Standard camera, model 2709, was introduced in 1912 and produced through the 1950's.\n\nEclair Cameflex CM3\n\nThe Eclair Cameflex was introduced to the US market in 1949. This Ãclair Cameflex CM3 16/35mm motion picture camera features: spinning mirror reflex viewfinding, a bright orientable viewfinder, a 3 lens turret, and includes two 400' 35mm displacement magazines, and an original Eclair aluminum tripod and friction head. The 3-lens turret features one Nikon lens mount and two Eclair lens mounts. (The Nikon lens is shown for demonstration purposes and is sold separately.)\n\nMitchell GC #1032\n\nMitchell GC #1032 was originally sold to the United States Army Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1953. Located just outside of Aberdeen, Maryland, the Aberdeen Proving Ground was established in 1917 as the US prepared to enter World War I. This is a Type A chronograph GC camera that records an image of a clock face (or other instrumentation) along with the main subject on each film frame. The military employed these chronograph cameras to document aircraft and weapons tests.\n\nMitchell MK II #182\n\nThe Mitchell Mark II 35mm Studio Reflex Camera was introduced in 1962 and was a major departure from the Mitchell Standard, NC, and BNC cameras that had brought Mitchell such success over the previous five decades. This camera was a lighter-weight, hand-holdable 35mm pin-registered, high speed camera with a spinning mirror reflex viewfinding system. This camera, #182, was manufactured in June 1963 and comes out of the collection of cinematographer John Hora.\n\nMitchell NC #239\n\nMitchell NC #239 was originally sold to the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 and used by the First Motion Picture Unit. The FMPU was the first military unit made up entirely of movie industry professionals. During the Second World War, the FMPU produced recruitment, training, and propaganda films for the U.S. military, and also trained combat camera units for deployment overseas.\n\nMitchell KF8\n\nThe Mitchell KF8 is a 35mm aircraft reconnaissance camera built for the United States Air Force (or possibly the Navy, records are unclear) in 1958. Based on the design of the Mitchell GC, the KF8 does not include the rackover mechanism or the focus tube that are regular features of that model. It is designed to be mounted in the nosecone of a jet aircraft and the pilot could remotely control focus, F-stop, and camera on/off.\n\nArriflex 16SR\n\nThis Arriflex 16 SR camera runs, holds speed, and the magazine seems to work correctly (although the outside film remaining indicator on the back of the magazine is missing its plastic cover). The footage clock on the take-up side of the magazine is in place and working. The on-board light meter seems to work, and I was able to repair the Zeiss 10-100mm zoom enough to make it a usable lens (however, this lens is missing the automatic iris control). The camera comes as you see in the photographs, with the camera body, one 400' magazine, pistol grip, and the Zeiss 10-100mm zoom lens. This Arriflex 16SR still has some flaws, but overall, itâs in really nice condition. This camera and lens are offered in as-is, unrestored condition.\n\nArriflex 16M\n\nThe Arriflex 16M \"Magazine\" camera was introduced in 1962 as a successor to the venerable ARRI 16 ST. After a lot of cleaning, I was able to inch the ARRI M camera and magazine by hand using the motor coupling. The movement (the pull-down claw and the registration pin) and the shutter all worked smoothly. The spinning mirror shutter is clean, without any major scratches or gauges in it. The viewfinder optics are very dirty, but I managed to clean them up enough the evaluate the camera. Other than needing a deep cleaning and a general service, this camera is in pretty good condition. I found a variable speed motor in my collection of parts and was able to power the camera up. Everything ran very smoothly. The camera comes as pictured, with a 400' magazine, an Angenieux 10-150mm zoom lens, and a variable speed motor. This camera is offered in as-is, unrestored condition.\n\nMaurer Model 05\n\nThe Maurer 16mm Professional Camera, model 05, has a reputation for being extremely well made and providing outstanding registration on 16mm film. This camera is surprisingly heavy for its size and has just the coolest set of features. The anastigmatically corrected sidefinder, which slides onto a dovetail on the camera door, has a control to adjust the format in the sidefinder, and ingeniously uses a single knob to synchronously focus the sidefinder and adjust it for parallax correction. This camera has not yet been restored.\n\nAuricon CM-72A\n\nThe Auricon line of 16mm cameras, audio recording devices, and accessories was launched in the 1940's with the introduction of a sound-on-film recorder. They introduced the Auricon Cine-Voice camera in the 1950's, and it gained wide popularity for news-gathering work due to its compact and portable design. This camera is offered in as-is, unrestored condition.\n\nAuricon CM-72A\n\nThe Auricon line of 16mm cameras, audio recording devices, and accessories was launched in the 1940's with the introduction of a sound-on-film recorder. They introduced the Auricon Cine-Voice camera in the 1950's, and it gained wide popularity for news-gathering work due to its compact and portable design. This camera is offered in as-is, unrestored condition.\n\nAuricon CM-72A\n\nThe Auricon line of 16mm cameras, audio recording devices, and accessories was launched in the 1940's with the introduction of a sound-on-film recorder. They introduced the Auricon Cine-Voice camera in the 1950's, and it gained wide popularity for news-gathering work due to its compact and portable design. This camera is offered in as-is, unrestored condition.\n\nAuricon CM-72A\n\nThe Auricon line of 16mm cameras, audio recording devices, and accessories was launched in the 1940's with the introduction of a sound-on-film recorder. They introduced the Auricon Cine-Voice camera in the 1950's, and it gained wide popularity for news-gathering work due to its compact and portable design. This camera is offered in as-is, unrestored condition.\n\nVictor Cine Camera Model 3\n\nThe Victor Cine Camera Model 3 is a 16mm spring-motor driven motion picture camera manufactured by the Victor Animatograph Corporation and introduced in 1927. Alexander Victor was a huge proponent of amateur and non-theatrical filmmaking, he even developed his own safety film standard in 1918. When Kodak introduced their 16mm safety film in 1923, Victor was finally able to see the amateur and non-theatrical educational, industrial, and religious film markets bloom. His Victor Cine Camera Model 3 was released just after Kodak launched their Cine-Kodak Model A as one of the very first 16mm cameras on the market.\n\nCine Kodak Special II with Cine Kodak Tripod\n\nImmaculate Cine-Kodak Special II 16mm camera (ca. 1948) with its original case, a 200â magazine, and an amazing collection of original lenses and accessories. To complete this camera package, I have added an original Cine-Kodak tripod with pan tilt head that I acquired a couple of years back with a giant crate of other tripods. This is an amazing, museum quality collection of equipment that deserves a really good home. Hopefully one of my followers has a place in your heart and home for this wonderful piece of cinema history.\n\nCinklox Model 3-S\n\nThe Cinklox Model 3-S 16mm spring motor driven camera was introduced in 1947 by the Cincinnati Clock and Instrument Company. The camera is designed to take 100' daylight loads and comes with a Wollensak Cine Velostigmat 1\" f2.7 coated lens. The Cinklox 3-S camera operates at \"normal, fast, and slow-motion\" speeds. The Cincinnati Clock and Instrument Company was incorporated in 1916 in Cincinnati, OH. Interestingly, during the 2nd World War, the company made components for gun cameras for the U.S. military. They used this experience to design and manufacture their Cinklox cameras.\n\nMitchell 16 Pro #831\n\nThe Mitchell 16mm Professional Camera was introduced in 1946, and is a 16mm version of the 35mm Mitchell Standard. The 16 Pro includes the legendary Mitchell rackover viewing system, and was available with the full compliment of accessories needed for professional photography. This camera, Mitchell 16 Pro #831, was manufactured in 1964.\n\nKeystone Model A-7\n\nThe Keystone Manufacturing Company was incorporated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1919 by Edward M. Swartz, Isidore Marks, Benjamin Marks, and J.M. Weisman. They manufactured 16mm and 8mm cameras and projectors, as well as metal and wooden toys. In 1936, they launched the Keystone Model A-7, a 16mm spring-motor driven camera that operated at seven speeds including 8 fps, 16 fps, and slow motion. This unit comes complete with a Cooke Anastigmat 1\" f2.7 lens."
