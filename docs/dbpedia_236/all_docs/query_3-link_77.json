        "text": "Critics' Notebook: True Blood, Newsroom Finales --- and a Bad Break\n\nWith buckets of gore and flustery bluster, HBO's big-ticket summer items True Blood and The Newsroom signed off Sunday with noisy season finales. But as usual, the night was owned by upstart AMC's brilliant Breaking Bad in the season's penultimate episode &mdash; its finale airs next Sunday as a Labor Day distraction &mdash; with a quietly devastating death scene for one of its most memorable characters. Some thoughts in ascending order (also the order in which I watched):\n\nDespite Failures, Networks Attempt More Series Reboots\n\nABC's Charlie's Angels redux didn't work, and NBC's new take on Wonder Woman never even made it to air. But just like the feature film world &mdash; where everything from Footloose to Conan the Barbarian has been recently updated &mdash; TV execs continue to mine the vaults in search of more classic titles to reboot."
