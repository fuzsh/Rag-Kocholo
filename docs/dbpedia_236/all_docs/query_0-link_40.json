        "text": "Went to the allergist this morning and she's put me back on weekly shots at a lower dosage for a bit to get me over this hump I'm having. I have to start doing my nasal rinses again, I just freaking hate doing it, but I guess I need to be an adult. She laughed at me b/c she showed me a video of one of her kid clients doing the rinse with his mom. I was like, I need an adultier adult to make me do this and set it all up for me. She gave me another couple of meds to add to help me get some relief for now. I was doing well until we started hitting triple/quadruple whammies of mold, trees, grass, and weeds combos. Ugh. My new contacts are in as well, so hopefully we'll get those in tomorrow and I'll have a more comfortable fit and upgraded vision.\n\nOtherwise, SSDD. Just catching up on work at home. I watched the PA rally yesterday. Honestly, I'm proud of the Party right now. Finally, we're seeing some diversity in age, gender, ethnicity, etc. in the leadership. No matter my thoughts on Biden and his contemporaries, it is beyond time for them to be handing the baton down to my generation.\n\nHarley is still being a pill, but I remembered last night that when I got her from the rescue there was the rule of 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. It really takes an animal 3 months to get used to a new routine basically. So, I'm trying to not be too annoyed with her. I wish she'd do the same for me, but I can remind myself that I'm the adult messing up all the things.\n\nI'm supposed to go see the 1984 Dune tonight at the movies. I do love the movie, but I'm already feeling tired, so I'm not sure I want to make it or not. Also, I am TIRED of all of these damn Instagram channel notifications. No, I don't want to join your channel, any of you, ever. I'm also sick of all of the political emails and texts. I even switched it to \"important only\"....that seems to reduce it to about 3/day. BUT Crystal Quade has won the Democratic nomination for MO Governor and I'm very excited about her. I do know her personally and she's amazing. She is a former roller derby player and her commercial with her playing was so much fun. She'd be our first female governor which just makes this damn state continue to feel so backward.\n\nThis was a lot longer than I expected.\n\n�\n\n6 Reply\n\n@Casadena sending you guys good vibes. FYI most insurances don't like to cover...well, really anything. If you have a history of anemia, heavy periods, or Vitamin D deficiency, then you usually can get some things covered, but if you want more extensive \"Vitamin\" testing, like beyond iron, ferritin, B12/Folate, Vitamin D, then usually insurance will deny without a covering diagnosis. And if you're otherwise healthy or haven't had bariatric surgery, then they won't want to cover it. And don't get me started on Medicare and how I can't even get a fucking A1C ordered for my senior patients because they wont cover it. More at risk for diabetes...but won't cover the diabetes screening...but we (and the patient, ultimately) get punished if patients become diabetic... Make it make sense.\n\nI am exhausted this morning. We're on a \"reduced\" schedule because of this training I did on Monday, so my first patient wasn't until 9 today. I should have texted my poor MA because she was freaking out when I showed up to work 45 minutes \"late.\" I'm usually there at 7:40 and today I pulled up at 8:40. The extra sleep was needed though.\n\n@VarunaTT H donated to Kamala's campaign and he checked the box for \"contact me with news via text.\" The second he told me I was like \"ooh, that's a rookie move.\" lol. Now every day he's complaining about being bombarded with texts. What's more frustrating is that MIL adds us to super far right phone lists for political texts and other bullshit. I get annoyed with getting stuff from my own party, but seeing texts about how the Orange Dumpster Fire is the best thing since sliced bread sends me over the edge.\n\n5 Reply\n\n@levioosa I probably wouldn't be so unhappy, but I am also somehow on the \"I don't want to hear from you list\" here. Also, I passed a sign this morning that had the candidate name and then \"Trump's Lawyer!!!\" I just can't understand the throat hold that man has on my state. But I don't understand any of it. I was sending them snarky comments at first, but that wasn't fun after awhile, so just kept responding stop.\n\nI do want news from the campaign but not so many times/day!! I might have to just stop it completely. I'm also irritated because they have no option to donate monthly, just weekly. I understand the whys behind it, but I have personal reasons to not want to see another recurring payment in my checkbook.\n\n�\n\n0 Reply\n\nOh @levioosa if my IL's added me to receive far right texts knowing my stance on agent orange I'd be angry at the level of disrespect. I'm really frustrated with mine now and have actually asked DH if he's even shared things with them at a personal level like do they know what insurance charges for EACH infusion? And do they get what a pain it was to get them to reverse and cover their screw up when they didn't cover one of her treatments and how much we would have had to pay if the hospital pushed us?? It's not all 'old people' stuff.\n\nAnd yes - I also get that if you need it brought home then you're still selfish because you don't want it until it's your own situation but sometimes you can hope that explaining things to them can be in terms they understand or have a greater impact. For people like Chiquita this isn't a preexisting condition like she smoked so she has emphysema. She has an autoimmune disease where a protein attacks her colon and without the biologic she bled so much she needed a transfusion and couldn't lift her hand off a bed to even pet a therapy dog.\n\n4 Reply\n\nI'm watching the weather today. With ticket's to tomorrow's Yankee game I'm just hoping it happens even if we sit there in raincoats.\n\nWork has hit me hard and I'm salty about a situation that's dropped in my lap from a coworker who wants things to move quickly and has seemingly looked over entirely what the best process is to make it happen or whether or not the requested time is in my bandwidth. I spoke up saying I'm out of the office for two days this week, am not pushing something at this level to anyone else and it's not realistic to expect it to move at the requested pace.\n\nI noticed something health wise that's concerning me and have an appt to see my doc on Tuesday. In the meantime my mind is not doing a great job at not wandering.\n\n2 Reply\n\n@Casadena, good luck with the couples counseling. I hope it goes well.\n\n@VarunaTT, That's exciting you know someone running for governor! Good luck to her. I looked it up because I was curious. 19 states have never had female governor, smh. That was a stat from 2021. Maybe it's improved over the last few years.\n\nWhelp, I got a bad phone call from HANO for both myself and my former tenant. They are the agency that manages Section 8 for Orleans Parish.\n\nI think I told you all about this. We had a Section 8 tenant who gave us a 30-Day Notice, but then couldn't move out on that date and didn't know when she could. We posted a notice on her door the next day that we were cancelling her notice since she didn't comply with it and she would need to give us another one when she had a definite move-out date.\n\nWe didn't hear from her again until Friday August 2nd. She told us she had moved out and asked what to do with the key. Ummm...okay.\n\nS8 paid for August's rent, but I found out today they are going to take the money back which is what I assumed would happen. It gets worse. Her contract with the new place started on July 26th. So not only are they going to take away August's rent, but they are also going to take 5 days of pro-rated rent back from July. Her case worker even apologized and said, \"We don't pay for storage,\" which I totally understand.\n\nIt's craziness to me that our tenant blew us off and couldn't be bothered to make a 3-minute phone call when she finally had a definite date. It wouldn't have been 30 days, but it might have saved some of her security deposit. Now she gets nothing back. In fact, she owes us more than the deposit.\n\nI know she thinks she is getting it back, despite us explaining to her and putting it in writing how notices work. On the one hand, I feel bad because she was a decent tenant before all of this. But on the other hand, she didn't give two shits about us limiting the vacancy time when she (I guess) mistakenly thought we wouldn't penalize her security deposit.\n\n0 Reply\n\nThe in-laws aren't horrible people (to me), but they do have a lot of super problematic views and have descended into Cheetoland over the past few years. They're not super hard core but are sucked into Fox News enough to believe most of the bullshit. I basically keep things surface level with them and if it wasn't for H I wouldn't have them in my life at all (of course). A complicating factor is MIL has some pretty obvious moderate dementia that truly is getting noticeably worse. To the point where it's hard for her to follow conversations at times now. And she won't get off the internet and she is constantly falling prey to schemes and false information. So I don't really engage with her any more because there's an actual health reason which is robbing her of the ability to logic things out. I did make her cry once after she shoved some antiabortion and anti vaccine pamphlets under our door and I told her in no uncertain terms any children we might had would be vaccinated, and I refused to go to her \"life group\" because I believed in abortion and that people had a right to abortions. It has been a trying 11 years. lol.\n\n4 Reply\n\n@levioosa wth to the inlaws?!? But also yay for your extra sleep!\n\n@Casadena I hope you get what you want out of therapy. I think it’s beneficial if both want to benefit from it! (In my case, my H had no desire but kept on telling us that he was serious about it)\n\n@short+sassy sounds like once she knew she was going to toss you to the curb anyway, she didn’t really care about respect after that.\n\nlately I haven’t been able to use my hotspot on my work phone to my laptop and I’m trying to leave early Friday to head out for girls weekend. I noticed today that it’s asking for my apple id. The one I created in 2011 when I started here and is on our old company email. IT and I have been trying all day to create a new apple id to link to it and factory reset it but apple is being a PITA and not allowing either of us to create a new id. My personal hotspot only allows 4 freaking hours a month! But I should be ok with just that allotment. Still SUPER annoying on apple’s part.\n\n5 Reply"
