In fact, they lacked almost all the necessary talents that might have helped them satisfy the appetites of their dreams, except one—their talent for violence.\n\nCheers to another FLASHBACK review and the *long* weekend, you guys! This week I revisited and reviewed one of my all-time favorites and I swear the more I do these the more I want to re-read all the good ones! I love true-crime and I am so surprised at how little books I’ve read in the genre. I mostly get my fix from podcasts (shoutout to Karen and Georgia from My Favorite Murder). Going back and reviewing this one I remembered how much I enjoyed it, and so I added true-crime novels to my wishlist because I need more reasons to be paranoid.\n\nWiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family by Nicholas Pileggi was the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese’s gangster epic, GoodFellas (1990). The book is based on the life of former gangster/career criminal turned mob informant Henry Hill and the events that led him into witness protection. It’s set during the 1960’s and 1970’s while Hill works under mob boss Paul Vario in Brooklyn, New York. It is such an engrossing and detailed account of life inside the *Mafia* that I could not put this book down. I specifically remember reading the bulk of this book on the train to and from work (and at work too). I should’ve started this by saying that Scorsese’s Goodfellas is one of my all-time favorite films (it’s in competition with Call Me By Your Name, but they are so different that I think they can equally share the #1 slot). I loved the film so so so much, I’ve seen it more times than I can remember, and this book did not disappoint. If anything it added to my unhealthy obsession with this story.\n\nThe Goodreads blurb reads that “Wiseguy is Henry Hill’s story, in fascinating, brutal detail, the never-before-revealed day-to-day life of a working mobster – his violence, his wild spending sprees, his wife, his mistresses, his code of honor.” The life of Henry Hill is so unbelievable that, rather than non-fiction, it reads like a work of fiction. I was enthralled by everything revealed in this book… like this happened… Henry Hill and his friends really did that! and it is so cool to have a front row seat at a life that is otherwise hidden from the rest of the world. The inner details of the book make Hill’s story more profound and give the reader a greater understanding for the intense and brutal life he had. The film, like most films, romanticizes this kind of lifestyle, but the book made me feel differently. It was just a factual story about the unconventional life of a gangster and in retrospect, I’m surprised this man was even alive at the time to tell the tale. It goes without saying that Henry and his friends were amoral corrupt criminals; however, it makes for a heck of a good book.\n\n“The hardest thing for me was leaving the life I was running away from. Even at the end, with all the threats I was getting and all the time I was facing behind the wall, I still loved the life. We walked in a room and the place stopped. Everyone knew who we were, and we were treated like movie stars… truckloads of swag, fur coats, televisions, clothes… paper bags filled with jewelry, a sugar bowl full of coke… free rented cars under phony names, the keys to a dozen hideout apartments… when I was broke I just went out and robbed some more. We ran everything. We paid off everybody. Now I’m an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.”\n\nHenry Hill\n\nI devoured it in less than a week and read the. whole. thing. in Ray Liotta’s voice! I really loved how faithful the movie was to the book — a lot of the classic lines and vignettes from the movie came directly from the book. I feel like Scorsese and Pileggi did such a fantastic job writing the screenplay and bringing this to life in a cinematic masterpiece. I can’t recommend this enough. This book is obviously not for everyone. If you’re not into the whole *Mafia* thing, then you probably will not like this. However, if you loved the movie, you will undoubtedly love the book as well."
