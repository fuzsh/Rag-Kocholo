        "text": "Note: This is the ninety-sixth in a series of historical/critical essays examining the best in film from each year. Essentially, I am watching films from the beginning of cinematic history that interest me and/or hold some critical or cultural impact. My personal, living list of favorites is being created at Mubi, showcasing five films per year. All this being explained, what follows is an examination of my favorite 1918 film, A DOG’S LIFE, directed by Charlie Chaplin.\n\nA DOG’S LIFE’s “Scraps” is one of the cutest dogs I’ve ever seen, and the image of him with the Little Tramp on a dirty stoop is seared into my brain. The best part is that the entire film surrounding that heartstring-tugging, symbolic moment of man-and-dog sympathy is also emotionally compelling — and hilarious.\n\nI say that, but part of A DOG’S LIFE’s beauty is how muted it is compared to other Charlie Chaplin shorts. Oh sure, the content is elevating comedy by way of pathos (which Chaplin had never done better before this film), but visually, the bombed out slum that the Tramp runs around contextualizes the living conditions of not only the titular dog, but also the humans in his orbit. Add in Edna Purviance’s career-defining performance as a shy yet incredibly talented barroom singer, and you get a Chaplin short defined by its slower moments, and even the funny ones on the margins. Of course, that would be something the director-star would come to be known for, but for all his impressive experiments in the short form (THE TRAMP [1915], THE IMMIGRANT [1917], EASY STREET [1917]), nowhere else in that era can the depth and potency of A DOG’S LIFE be found. It may very well be Chaplin’s best short film.\n\nThe complexity of the film could be attributed to Chaplin’s new working situation. After concluding his contract with Mutual Film Corporation in 1917 (which ironically and/or consequently folded and was absorbed into Film Booking Offices of America in 1918), Chaplin and brother-manager Sydney Chaplin made a deal with First National Pictures for $1 million (nearly $18 million today). This deal, which required Chaplin to make eight films, did not really designate a time frame. All told, it took him five years to complete the eight films he owed First National, making it the longest time he had spent with any one studio/distributor. He constructed a new studio, which was completed in January 1918 and would eventually become the home of The Jim Henson Company. A DOG’S LIFE was the first movie completed for the deal, released in April 1918. His last film (THE ADVENTURER) was released in October 1917; this was an unprecedented gap for the comedian. But as was made clear by his brother Sydney, the new working philosophy of Charlie was quality not quantity.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean he didn’t have to make considerations for First National. Founded in 1917, it became the largest theater chain at one time and, clearly, made a big play at film distribution, signing not only Chaplin but Mary Pickford as well. It was a ubiquitous if not A-list distributor throughout the 1920s, until it was purchased by Warner Bros. in 1929 and the First National name was used as a brand trademark on groups of Warner Bros.-distributed films. Chaplin made his first feature film in 1918 as well, the 45-minute long war-themed picture SHOULDER ARMS, but he followed with the shorts SUNNYSIDE (1919), A DAY’S PLEASURE (1919), THE IDLE CLASS (1921), and PAY DAY (1922). These were all phenomenal shorts, but clearly fueled with a different kind of energy that Chaplin poured into his features THE KID (1921) and THE PILGRIM (1923).\n\nIn fact, only one year into his time with First National, Chaplin co-founded United Artists with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D.W. Griffith, the idea being to create a distribution arm by artists for artists. Of course, that credo eventually went by the wayside as the company struggled and changed hands between massive corporations, but the premise was quite unique in 1919. It would take four years before Chaplin could fulfill his First National contract and make all his pictures for his own company, but in the meantime, he was still putting the time and money afforded to him to good use.\n\nA DOG’S LIFE follows two creatures living similarly poor lives. The Tramp is a human who lives in the dirt and has to fight for scraps at the employment office (which he ultimately loses). Scraps is a dog who, well, also lives in the dirt and nearly loses his life in a fight for his namesake (that is, scraps) with other dogs. But Chaplin’s Tramp saves the dog in a spontaneous, good-chill-inducing display of compassion. In fact, that’s a recurring theme in A DOG’S LIFE, this little bit of a wrinkle in the development of the Tramp character. This incarnation will just suddenly save a dog, dance with a timid singer, take money he found buried in the ground, and embark on a heist mission to get it back.\n\nIt’s not as if previous versions of the character were, like, “smaller than life” characters. But there’s some kind of determination to Chaplin’s persona in A DOG’S LIFE that extends to the character’s failures; he even gets thrown out of “The Green Lantern” bar (the place doesn’t allow dogs) with a matter of fact lack of resistance. But it just precedes a quickly formed new plan to get back in, which forms the basis of a hilarious gag. Charlie puts the little Scraps in his pants, and the dog’s tail pokes out of a hole in the trousers, wagging around and gaining a lot of bewildered attention. These things are present in every Tramp film, but perhaps its the near selflessness (barring the taking of the money and food and such) that colors the portrayal differently.\n\nThere are a lot of small funny moments happening in the margins of A DOG’S LIFE too. In a scene where a rousing singer/dancer comes on stage after the sad singing of Purviance’s character, the percussionist leans too hard in the opposite energy direction, smacking a tambourine on his head and getting way more amped than is necessary. And it all takes place in the corner of the frame. It’s not quite the same situation, but Chaplin and Scraps, soon after becoming pals, get into a little awkward encounter with a food cart owner, valiantly played by Charlie’s brother and manager Sydney. The focus is naturally drawn to Charlie, who is stealing food from the counter in between Sydney’s suspicious and bewildered glances. But there are a few moments, including one where Sydney whips his head back and forth to either shoulder, that are laugh out loud funny.\n\nAs for Charlie himself: there’s a scene where the Tramp knocks out one of the two thieves who are trying to retrieve the wallet they dumped in the plot of dirt he calls home. He then hides behind a curtain in the bar, placing his arms through it to make it appear as though they are the thief’s. The Tramp proceeds to hilariously interact with the partner-in-crime with his hands alone (the knocked out thief’s eyes are still open, giving some “plausibility” to the scene); your eyes are naturally drawn to the crazy hand movements. But through a little slit in the curtain, you can also see Chaplin’s eyes and facial expressions, a series of unnecessary contortions and reactions as if he were actually interacting with the other thief. It’s a small touch that does wonders to make the scene even funnier.\n\nBut as mentioned, A DOG’S LIFE is strengthened by the small touches that aren’t necessarily meant to be funny. The moment on the stoop, when the Tramp feeds Scraps just a little bit of milk is one, of course, but another compelling moment is Purviance’s introduction. Her nervous, shy, boss-enforced flirting with the Tramp is incredibly endearing, and Chaplin’s attempt to enliven her is all the more heartwarming. The chemistry on display here had been honed across numerous films, but A DOG’S LIFE is a great example of how Purviance was a great performer in her own right. She was not just Chaplin’s female lead; she took on a number of diverse roles within what would be considered a typical comedy sweetheart framework.\n\nBy this time, though, Purviance and Chaplin had apparently ended their love affair(s), although they would continue to collaborate through 1923 and Chaplin’s underappreciated and unfairly maligned dramatic feature A WOMAN IN PARIS (1923). Chaplin also took up with 16-year-old actress Mildred Harris, beginning a series of troubling relationships that I will dive into with my next Chaplin film essay. A DOG’S LIFE is a landmark film in the development of Chaplin’s working philosophy, and to a certain extent his films’ emotional through lines. But THE KID is a landmark film in the fully formed emotional commitment to Chaplin’s own philosophy and beliefs, informed by his personal failures and early life. So that’s when I’ll address those personal failures, and the ones to come after THE KID as well.\n\nIn the meantime, though, know that A DOG’S LIFE was in fact Chaplin’s best film until THE KID. It’s a phenomenally paced short comedy with plenty of moments of dramatic and emotional depth. This is one of the classic and must-see movies of the whole 1910s, the key Chaplin short film, and a movie with a whole lot more to appreciate every time you see it. If you watch just one Chaplin short (and I suppose Chaplin film in general if you can’t commit to a feature), make it A DOG’S LIFE."
