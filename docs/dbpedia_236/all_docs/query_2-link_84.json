        "text": "Across the country, reconciliation supporters brought to life the National Reconciliation Week 2024 theme, Now More Than Ever.\n\nFrom 27 May to 3 June, in schools, communities and workplaces across the nation, supporters of the reconciliation movement came together to recommit to bold action to continue the fight for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s rights, recognition and justice.\n\nHundreds of in-person and virtual events were held around the country. Over 400 choirs and singing groups raised their voices for reconciliation singing the Warumpi Band classic, Blackfella/Whitefella.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of some of the #VoicesforReconciliation:\n\nAbout the artwork\n\nThe National Reconciliation Week 2024 design and artwork represent the momentum of the theme Now More Than Ever. The chevron, a universal symbol for pointing the way, signifies advancing as one as we look towards a reconciled future; and the vibrant artwork of Gubbi Gubbi artist Maggie Douglas encourages connecting with one another, understanding and continuing to move forward.\n\nThe 2024 theme design incorporating the artwork is by Carbon Creative.\n\nThe dates for NRW remain the same each year; 27 May to 3 June. These dates commemorate two significant milestones in the reconciliation journey— the successful 1967 referendum, and the High Court Mabo decision respectively.\n\nReconciliation must live in the hearts, minds and actions of all Australians as we move forward, creating a nation strengthened by respectful relationships between the wider Australian community, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nWe all have a role to play when it comes to reconciliation, and in playing our part we collectively build relationships and communities that value Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, histories, cultures, and futures.\n\nA brief history\n\nNational Reconciliation Week (NRW) started as the Week of Prayer for Reconciliation in 1993 (the International Year of the World’s Indigenous Peoples) and was supported by Australia’s major faith communities.\n\nIn 1996, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation launched Australia’s first National Reconciliation Week.\n\nIn 2001, Reconciliation Australia was established to continue to provide national leadership on reconciliation.\n\nIn the same year, approximately 300,000 people walked across Sydney Harbour Bridge as part of National Reconciliation Week-and subsequently across bridges in cities and towns-to show their support for reconciliation.\n\nToday, National Reconciliation Week is celebrated in workplaces, schools and early learning services, community organisations and groups, and by individuals Australia-wide.\n\nCheck out our factsheet on National Reconciliation Week."
