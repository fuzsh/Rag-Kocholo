        "text": "The Government of India announced the Bharat Ratna for former prime ministers Shri P V Narasimha Rao, Shri Chaudhary Charan Singh and eminent scientist Dr M S Swaminathan. This brings the total number of Bharat Ratna awards in 2024 to 5 which is the most for any year.\n\nIn Feb 2024, the Union Government announced the Bharat Ratna for former Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani. In January 2024, the government announced the 49th Bharat Ratna award for former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur. Thakur is the 17th personality to receive the award posthumously.\n\nThis article is about the Bharat Ratna Award, the highest civilian award in India. This topic is an important part of UPSC and other government exams.\n\nBHARAT RATNA\n\nBharat Ratna – ‘Jewel of India’ is the highest civilian award in the country. It is conferred for exceptional Service to the nation in various fields such as Science arts, literature and recognition of public service of the highest order. The award can be granted posthumously and since its establishment, seven awards have been granted posthumously.\n\nHISTORY OF BHARAT RATNA\n\nThe award was established by former President of India Rajendra Prasad on 2nd January 1954.\n\nThe concept of awarding this award posthumously was not there in the original statute declared in January 1954.\n\nProvision to award posthumously was finally added in the January 1966 statute of this prestigious award.\n\nThe first Bharat Ratna was awarded to Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Sir C.V. Raman, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari in 1954.\n\nSachin Tendulkar is the first sportsperson and the youngest Bharat Ratna Award, recipient.\n\nTHE AWARD\n\nThe medallion is cast in Bronze.\n\nThe medallion is designed like the leaf of a pipal tree with a sunburst in the centre and Bharat Ratna is engraved underneath it.\n\nOn the backside, the emblem of India is embossed and Satyameva Jayate is inscribed in Devanagari script.\n\nThe medallion is worn around the neck using a white ribbon.\n\nThe award does not carry any monetary endowment.\n\nWHO ARE ALL ENTITLED TO GET BHARAT RATNA?\n\nThe award was initially restricted to accomplishments in literature, science, arts, and public services, but the government of India expanded the conditions to comprise “any field of human endeavour” in 2011.\n\nThere is no written provision that Bharat Ratna should be awarded to Indian citizens only.\n\nRecently Government of India has altered guidelines for the eligibility of persons from the sports field for the Bharat Ratna.\n\nWHO DECIDES?\n\nThe recommendations for Bharat Ratna are made by the Prime Minister to the President.\n\nThe number of yearly awards is constrained to a maximum of three in a specific year.\n\nCONTROVERSIES\n\nIn 1992, Subhash Chandra Bose was awarded Bharat Ratna posthumously. As there is no solid evidence of Subhash Chandra Bose’s death his family declined to receive the award.\n\nPERSONALITIES WHO RECEIVED BHARAT RATNA\n\nList of Bharat Ratna Awardees:\n\nBharat Ratna Awardees Year Brief Description C.
