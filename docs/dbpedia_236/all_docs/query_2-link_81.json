        "text": "The Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area Special Recreation Permit (SRP) Policy is as follows:\n\nSRP preplanning: First time SRP applicants are required to meet with an Outdoor Recreation Planner prior to submitting an application either in person or via phone. This coordination meeting will ensure a complete SRP application is submitted and will avoid unnecessary time delays and costs. The coordination meeting should occur not less than 30 days before the application is due for submission.\n\nSRP application deadlines: SRP applications will not be accepted earlier than one year nor later than 180 days prior to the proposed use, unless waived by the Outdoor Recreation Planner. The 180-day requirement may be waived if the proposed activity has current environmental analysis and clearances and if sufficient staff is available to process the application and monitor the proposed activity. Contact the Red Rock/Sloan Canyon Field Office if you are unsure your SRP application meets this requirement.\n\nOutright rejection of incomplete applications: A complete SRP application contains:\n\nThe current Special Recreation Permit application typed or printed in ink and completely filled out,\n\nA map produced using Global Positioning Systems with transferable compatible data to the BLM computer systems (see SRP map requirements) or a pre-approved map,\n\nOperating/Business Plan or other information the BLM requests,\n\nAdvance payment of estimated fees, due at the time the application is submitted (minimum of $110 or as determined by the administrative officer).\n\nSRP Fees: SRP fees must be paid in advance of the authorized use.\n\nCommercial Use Fees are 3% of gross revenue or the $115 minimum annual fee, whichever is greater.\n\nCompetitive Use Fees are $6 per person per day, 3% of gross revenue, or the $115 minimum annual fee, whichever is greater.\n\nOrganized Use Fees are $6 per person per day or the $115 annual minimum, whichever is greater. Please refer to the 2930-1 application form for the definitions for different types of use categories. Site fees ($230) and Exclusive Use fees ($230) may also be charged in addition to the above SRP fees.\n\nAny commercial business regardless of the number of clients/participants or if they charge a fee and wishing to do business in the Conservation Area or deliver clients, must obtain a Special Recreation Permit.\n\nOrganized groups, which do not charge any fees and are under fifteen people and not rock climbing should call to make sure no other fees are required for their activity. Please contact an outdoor recreation planner at least 180 days in advance or more.\n\nIn addition, the Scenic Drive and Visitor Center Area are considered a “Special Area.” The Interagency passes and all annual passes are not valid with Commercial or Competitive SRP’s. They also do not allow for deductions in entrance or camping fees for these uses.\n\nCost Recovery: In addition to the fees in the National Recreation Fee Schedule, if the BLM needs more than 50 hours of staff time to process and monitor a SRP for commercial use in any one year, we may charge a fee for recovery of the processing costs. For competitive or organized group/event use, BLM may charge a fee for recovery of costs to the agency of analysis and permit processing instead of the SRP fee if the BLM needs more than 50 hours of staff time in any one year, and we anticipate the permit fees on the fee schedule for that year will be less than the costs of processing the SRP. We will notify you in writing if you need to pay cost recovery before processing your SRP application. All work will cease on your SRP application until 80% of the required fees have been paid.\n\nLimitations on Cost Recovery: Cost recovery charges will be limited to BLM’s cost of issuing the permit, including necessary environmental documentation, on-site monitoring, and permit enforcement. All costs, direct and indirect, related to the processing, permitting, and monitoring of a single SRP are eligible for cost recovery. This includes BLM personnel time, printing materials, depreciation costs of vehicles, miscellaneous supplies and equipment used to process and/or monitor the SRP.\n\nSRP map requirements: All SRP applications must include a map of the proposed route or event site. If you are using areas outside of the officially designated roads or trails, you must submit SRP map(s) produced using Global Positioning Systems with transferable compatible data to the BLM computer systems. The data must be collected in UTM Zone 11 North NAD Conus 1983. This is the format of the shapefile when using the GPS. The BLM computer systems may be able to accept other datum such as NAD 27 or waypoints; however, this may delay processing your permit and will most likely require cost recovery. Non-GPS maps are not accepted unless waived by an Authorized Officer. Once the SRP application map is submitted, no changes will be authorized unless initiated by the BLM to mitigate environmental degradation or comply with Federal, State and/or local regulations. You will need to include all proposed stops, staging areas, and other additional features such as signage to the map. A detailed map for parking/staging and rest areas may also be required particularly if restrooms or other temporary structures will be required. The BLM may require a bond (see below) if the areas or routes requested may require additional re-vegetation or re-naturalization.\n\nOperating plan/Business plan: SRP applicants are required to submit supplemental information related to the proposed activity. This information is a written explanation of the proposed activity and how you the permittee will manage the activity. Commercial use permittees may submit a business plan along with the application. This information will aid the BLM in making a decision regarding your SRP application. A well thought operating or business plan can reduce permit processing time and costs. These plans should include emergency consideration, communication plan, numbers of participants, tours, costs to participants and any other revenue streams, anticipated impacts to other users and how the permittee plans on mitigating these.\n\nOther licenses/permits: The SRP applicant is required to provide copies of all related licenses and/or permits obtained for the proposed activity. This includes but is not limited to: Clark County Special Events Permit, Nevada Transportation Authority license, health permits, business license, written permission from private landowners, NDOT right-of-way permit, other agency permits/approvals, etc. The BLM will not authorize your use until all such related information is received no later than two weeks prior to the proposed activity.\n\nSRP Insurance: All commercial and competitive applicants for SRPs, except vendors, must obtain a property damage, personal injury, and public liability insurance policy that BLM judges sufficient to protect the public and United States. Your policy must name the U.S. Department of Interior-Bureau of Land Management as additionally insured and stipulate that you or your insurer will notify BLM 30 days in advance of termination or modification of the policy. A valid Insurance certificate with the proposed group/companies name which is the same as the applicant must be received a minimum 30 days prior to the event or the beginning of the permit period for the SRP to be valid. Should this insurance expire during the life of the permit, it is up to the permittee to provide updated insurance certificates 30 days prior to the expiration. All permitted activities will be stopped if the insurance is not updated.\n\nWe may also require vendors, and other applicants, such as organized groups, to obtain and submit such a policy. BLM may waive the insurance requirement if we find that the vending or group activity will not cause appreciable environmental degradation or risk to human health or safety. Please include the following statement on your insurance policy: “United States Government-The Department of Interior- BLM is additionally insured.” The permittee is required to notify the department at least 30 days or more in advance of any changes, modifications, or cancellation of insurance. If this information is not on the insurance certificate, the application or permit may be suspended, or cancelled. The permittee is responsible for ensuring the BLM has the most recent copy of insurance for the permitted activity. Failing to maintain current and/or adequate insurance is grounds for immediate suspension or termination of the permit.\n\nMinimal insurance requirements: At a minimum, the permittee shall have in force public liability insurance covering: (1) Damage to property in the amount of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000), (2) Damage per occurrence (persons, bodily injury or death) in the amount of (minimum) three hundred thousand ($300,000); and (3) A minimum annual aggregate limit of six hundred thousand ($600,000). The coverage shall extend to property damage, bodily injury, or death arising out of the permittee’s operations under the permit, including, but not limited to, the occupancy or use of the lands, structures, facilities, or equipment authorized by the permit. Liability coverage may differ depending on the type of the event. Please contact an Outdoor Recreation Planner to inquire about additional liability insurance requirements.\n\nSRP Stipulations: Special Recreation Permit stipulations are specific responsibilities and conditions to meet management goals and objectives and to protect lands and resources and the public interest. The first sixteen General Terms are on the back of the SRP application, and supplemental stipulations are issued depending on the type of activity. Other stipulations will be issued following the interdisciplinary review of the proposed activity which are specific to your activity or event. You must comply with all stipulations in your approved Special Recreation Permit.\n\n“Terms and Conditions” are stipulations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relating to the Biological Opinion, to which all SRP activities must conform. The Terms and Conditions are issued with the SRP stipulations and list specific requirements the permittee must fulfill for to the activity to be approved and permitted. One such stipulation is to educate your clients/ participants about the Threatened Desert Tortoise and provide documentation stating that you have provided this. A Desert Tortoise Acknowledgement form provided by the BLM is available. This form must be signed by each activity member and returned with the permit post-use report or as agreed upon by the BLM.\n\nStipulations may also require the permittee to provide adequate restroom facilities, trash or waste collection, communication, signage and other health and safety resources for their clients and/or the general public.\n\nReporting: BLM may require you to submit an end of event, monthly, quarterly, or annual post-use report to verify your charges. You must include the gross amount of all sales, donations, and value of anything of value rendered for your services. Your actual fees will be calculated depending on whether you are considered an organized group, competitive, or commercial group, whether you utilize the Special Area in the conservation area (additional $2/person/day), and if you are subject to a site($230) or exclusive site fee($230). There may be consideration for time the activity or event is not utilizing public land.\n\nYou must submit any other required paperwork with your post-use reports such as, Desert Tortoise Acknowledgement forms, certificates for weed-free hay, guide lists, and any other required documentation by the established deadline. Failure to provide these documents can jeopardize your permit validity or renewal.\n\nBonding: BLM may require you to submit a payment bond, cash or surety deposit, or other financial guarantee in an amount sufficient to cover your fees or defray the costs of restoration and rehabilitation of the lands affected by the permitted use. BLM will return the bonds and financial guarantees when you have complied with all permit stipulations. BLM may waive the bonding requirement if we find that your activity will not cause appreciable environmental degradation or risk to human health and safety.\n\nMulti-year SRP: The BLM will encourage multi-year permits for a previously approved permit if the following conditions are met: a) the purpose of the permit remains unchanged, b) the approved activity site or route does not change, c) the logistical support remains unchanged, d) environmental conditions do not change significantly, e) activity remains consistent with land use plans, federal, state, local laws and regulations, f) the previous years’ permitted activity complied with the permit stipulations, g) the permittee is in good standing on all other permits, not just the Red Rock Field Office, and h) other conditions the BLM determines appropriate (ex. customer service reports, field checks, land disposal, congressional designations, etc.). The BLM will make determinations on a case-by-case basis. Approval of a multi-year permit remains at the sole discretion of the BLM, and will be utilized when appropriate.\n\nExpedited SRP process: The BLM will continue to seek methods for increasing efficiency and reducing consumptive impacts to the government and the permittee. As technology progresses the BLM will consider adopting processes to expedite the SRP process, while maintaining conformance with laws and regulations. It is not proposed to short-cut any process steps nor circumvents any required review time for SRP proposals.\n\nLimited Commercial Permits: There are limits to the number of commercial use, competitive or organized group permits available as established with the Resource Management Plan and other Environmental Analysis documents. Under the current Red Rock Canyon NCA Resource Management Plan, there are the following limits of commercial guided SRPs allowed at any one time.\n\nBicycling (Mtn bike and road bike) 4 full time permits* Hiking 5 full time permits* Off-road tours (motorized vehicles) 3 full time permits Horseback tours 3 full time permits Rock climbing tours (repelling, canyoneering included)* 5 full-time permits Rock climbing guest permits (10 days total/yr.)** 8 commercial and 4 Colleges/High school\n\nOther uses are allowed but must be analyzed through a public process. The following uses have been analyzed for certain levels of use. If proponents would like to increase the amount of use for these or propose a new use an Environmental Analysis would be required prior to acceptance of applications. Cost Recovery will be required for such analysis.\n\nGuided scooter/motorcycle/electric bike tours 4 full time permits* Yoga programs 2 full time Art/painting/photography tours 2 full time Weddings (commercial company or paid officiant) 15 full time*\n\n* Currently the maximum have been assigned. You may contact us to be put on wait-list.\n\n** The Rock Climbing Guest Permits are for one calendar year and are offered through a lottery. Applications accepted beginning June 1 and must be received by September 1 for the following year."
