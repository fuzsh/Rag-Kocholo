        "text": "List of the first achievements in cinema\n\nThis page lists chronologically the first achievements in cinema. The development of cinema is characterised by technological breakthroughs, from early experiments in the recording of day-to-day activity, experiments in colour, different formats and sound. From the 1970s, the development of computer-generated imagery became integral to the way that films are produced.\n\nIn parallel with the developments in technology, its content and the way it reflects society and its concerns and the way society responds to it have changed too. The list attempts to address some of these events.\n\nContents\n\n19th century: Pre-1870 • 1870s • 1880s • 1890s\n\n20th century: 1900s • 1910s • 1920s • 1930s • 1940s • 1950s • 1960s • 1970s • 1980s • 1990s\n\n21st century: 2000s • 2010s • 2020s\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nPeter Mark Roget's wrote the article Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures which described a stroboscopic illusion.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, around December 1832, the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau and the Austrian professor of practical geometry Simon Stampfer invented the Phenakistiscope, the first practical device to create a fluid illusion of motion. Plateau introduced the device in January 1833 in a scientific magazine.\n\nFrench astronomer P.J.C. Janssen came up with the idea for a \"revolver to shoot the individual. This huge camera system used a Maltese cross-type mechanism, very similar to the system that would later be of great importance in the development of movie cameras. Janssen successfully captured two transits of Venus, the one of 1874 in Japan, and that of 1882 at Oran, in Algeria. Discs with test footage of a simulation from 1874 have been preserved and a modern animated version is sometimes regarded as the first movie.[1]\n\nUsing a battery of 12 cameras Eadweard Muybridge records several series of The Horse in Motion, capturing successive phases of movements that allowed his patron Leland Stanford to study the positions of the legs of his race horses during different gaits. The technique would soon be dubbed chronophotography.\n\nDuring his lectures on locomotion, Eadweard Muybridge projected looping animations of The Horse in Motion with his Zoopraxiscope. The stroboscopic apparatus used glass discs on which silhouette versions of the photographs had been traced by an artist (with anamorphic corrections for the distortion caused by fast rotation).\n\nÉtienne-Jules Marey developed the Chronophotographe, which could take 12 pictures per second from a single viewpoint.\n\nIn Leeds, England Louis Le Prince films Roundhay Garden Scene, believed to be the first motion picture recorded.[2]\n\nMonkeyshines was made by William Kennedy Dickson and William Heise as an experimental film to test the original cylinder Kinetograph format.

The show, billed as Pantomimes Lumineuses, included three cartoons, Pauvre Pierrot, Un bon bock, and Le Clown et ses chiens, each consisting of 500 to 600 individually painted images and lasting about 15 minutes. The film was the first to use perforations.\n\nBlacksmith Scene, by William Kennedy Dickson. The first Kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition on May 9, 1893 and is the earliest known example of actors performing a role in a film.[4]\n\nThe world's first film production studio, the Black Maria, or the Kinetographic Theater, was completed on the grounds of Edison's laboratories at West Orange, New Jersey, for the purpose of making film strips for the Kinetoscope. Construction began in December 1892.[5]\n\nOn April 14, 1894, a public Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, on the corner of 27th Street—the first commercial motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill.[6]\n\nThe Dolorita Passion Dance was banned in New Jersey after its use in peepshows. Russell Kick quotes the work Censorship as saying it \"was probably the first [film] to be banned in the United States.\"[7]\n\nLa Sortie des Usines, the first film to be made in France.\n\nThe Dickson Experimental Sound Film by William Kennedy Dickson. It is the first known film with live-recorded sound and appears to be the first motion picture made for the Kinetophone, the proto-sound-film system developed by Dickson and Thomas Edison.[8]\n\nFirst hand-colored film, Annabelle Serpentine Dance by William Kennedy Dickson.[9]\n\nCharles Francis Jenkins displays the Phantascope, the first patented Film projector.\n\nIncident at Clovelly Cottage by Robert W.
