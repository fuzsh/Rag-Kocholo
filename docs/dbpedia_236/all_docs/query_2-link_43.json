        "text": "INDEPENDENT STUDIOS\n\nThis organization represented only 10 of the movie studios functioning at this time.\n\nThere were many others, but only a few independents actually caused concern for Edison and his cartel. The following name a few of these \"renegades.\"\n\nThe Trust faced its most formidable foe in the form of entrepreneur Carl Laemmle. The German-born Laemmle came to America in 1884 at the age of 17. He purchased his first nickelodeon in Chicago in 1906, and soon had his own film production business called Laemmle Film Service. Unhappy with paying Edison's MPPC for weekly equipment and film rental, he resigned as an MPPC licensee and opened his own company, Independent Motion Picture Company in 1909.\n\nBy 1910, Laemmle changed the face of the industry by creating the \"star\" system, much to the chagrin of other movie companies who chose to keep their stars anonymous. The \"publicity stunt\" involving Biograph Girl Florence Lawrence shook the very core of the industry, forcing studios to recognize and compensate the actors in their films. In 1912, he merged IMP with Bison 101, the U. S. production facilities of French studio Éclair, and several other film companies to create Universal Film Manufacturing Co. and the Motion Picture Sales and Distribution Company (called the Sales Company) to distribute the films.\n\nIn 1915, Carl Laemmle bought a 230 acre chicken ranch on the outskirts of Los Angeles, California. He called his studio Universal City, and made it a policy to invite visitors to visit the facilities and observe the behind-the-scenes magic of movie-making.\n\nIn addition to Universal, several other studios formed in the 1909-1910 period that garnered the attention of The Trust. These included the Thanhauser Film Corporation, Mutual Film Corporation, Nestor Film Co., American Film Manufacturing Company, and the Motion Pictures Company.\n\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR POWER\n\nDuring the mid-1910's to early 1920's, the movie industry experienced a great deal of turmoil as the major players struggled for power. Movie production companies were bought and sold almost daily, and stars moved or were \"lured\" to rival studios. Back door dealings were the norm, as studios vied vigorously to be No. 1.\n\nSeveral significant new studios emerged out of this chaos. Some were due to mergers, while others were formed from individuals working with prior studios. For example, Adolph Zukor's \"Famous Players\" and Jesse Lasky's \"Feature Players\" merged in 1916 to form the \"Famous Players-Lasky.\" In 1917, while still making films for Mutual, Charlie Chaplin built his own movie studio in Los Angeles in 1917. He filmed all of his classic \"Little Tramp\" silent films at this studio.\n\nOne of the major controlling forces of the industry at this time was Adolph Zukor. It was Zukor's intent to control the industry by requiring exhibitors to show only his films. He would offer them a block of 104 films each year. If they wanted to pick their titles, they would be charged more money. This practice was known as \"block-booking.\" It was also called \"blind booking,\" since exhibitors had no idea of what films they were acquiring.\n\nThe leading movie exhibitors, wealthy in their own rights, resented Zukor's power-hungry tactics. In 1917, Thomas L. Tally, a Los Angeles theatre owner, presented a concept that pleased the exhibitors. He proposed creating an organization of exhibitors, one from each major city, who would buy and distribute their own films. Exhibitor John D. Williams of West Virginia was so impressed with this idea that he joined forces with Tally to form the First National Exhibitors Circuit. First National increased its 100 theatres to 600 across the country, and soon became a thorn in the side of Zukor and his studio. First National produced films to 1935.\n\nTHE BIG FIVE\n\nThe next decade saw the movie industry experienced a shift in power. Although there were a number of independent filmmakers, most of the major films were being produced by eight primary studios. They were known in the industry as the \"Big Five\" and the \"Little Three\".\n\nThe members of the \"Big Five\" were:\n\n20th CENTURY FOX 20th Century Fox was formed in 1935 as a result of the merger of Fox Films and Twentieth Century Pictures, which had been founded in 1933 by Daryl Zanuck. The company officially became known as \"20th Century Fox.\" Their studios were located in Century City on land once used as the personal ranch of western star Tom Mix.\n\nMGM, originally named Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, was formed in 1924 by the merger of Metro Pictures, Samuel Goldwyn Picture Corporation and the Louis B. Mayer Pictures Company. MGM's Hollywood studio housed its own police and fire departments, telegraph and post office facilities, water tower and well, art department, laboratory, electrical, pain and lock shops. It also house wardrobe, make-up, property, lighting and camera departments.\n\nPARAMOUNT PICTURES In 1935, Paramount Pictures was the official name given to the merger of Famous Players-Lasky and Paramount Film Distribution (called Paramount Program). Their studos were located in Hollywood, California.\n\nRKO PICTURES, INC. RKO was originally founded in 1882 with the opening of a single vaudeville theater and grew into the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theater circuit, the then-largest theater chain in the world. In 1928, David Sarnoff, president of Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and Joseph P. Kennedy, merged the theater chain with the Pathe Studios and the Film Booking Office of America (FBO), a movie distribution organization acquired by Kennedy two years earlier. The new company was renamed the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation, or RKO Corporation and produced films through the 1950's.\n\nWARNER BROS. PICTURES Polish brothers Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner established their film distribution business in 1907. They opened their first film production studio on Sunset Boulevard in 1918. They formed Warner Bros. Pictures Inc. in 1923. In 1928 the Warner brothers bought the Burbank film lot in California from First National Pictures calling it the Warner Bros. Studios. The studio was located on farmland owned by dentist and rancher Dr. David Burbank, after whom the city of Burbank was named. In 1972, Warner Brothers and Columbia Pictures joined forces to create The Burbank Studios, a state-of-the-art production facility. In the 1980's, they purchased the Samuel Goldwyn Studios in Hollywood, renaming it Warner Hollywood Studios.\n\nTHE LITTLE THREE\n\nThe \"Little Three\" comprised:\n\nCOLUMBIA PICTURES Columbia Pictures originally began as the CBC Film Company in 1920, founded by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and Joseph Brandt. It was official named Columbia Pictures in 1924. In 1934, Columbia purchased the first forty acres of their ranch in Burbank. By 1949, the ranch had increased to eighty acres. On June 3, 1971, Columbia moved their Hollywood production into the Warner Brothers Burbank lot, which was dubbed The Burbank Studios. Warner Bros. still owns 32 acres of the original studio.\n\nUNITED ARTISTS United Artists was established in 1919 by movie industry icons Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith. United Artists did not own their own production facilities. The founders instead intended the company to be a distribution arm for independent producers, some of which did own their own studios. United Artists did utilize the 18-acre property owned by Pickford and Fairbanks known as the Pickford-Fairbanks Studio. In the 1920's, the lot became known as United Artists Studio. Producer Samuel Goldwyn financed an expansion of the property, and in1940 renamed the lot the Samuel Goldwyn Studio, over the protests of partial land owner Mary Pickford. The lot is now called the UA-Samuel Goldwyn Studio.\n\nUNIVERSAL In 1912, Carl Laemmle merged his Independent Motion Picture Company (which he founded in 1909) with Bison 101, the U. S. production facilities of French studio Éclair, Nestor Film Co. and several other film companies to create Universal Film Manufacturing Co. In 1915, Laemmle bought a 230 acre chicken ranch on the outskirts of Los Angeles, California, which he eventually increased to 420 acres.. He called his studio Universal City, and made it a policy to invite visitors to visit the facilities and observe the behind-the-scenes magic of movie-making Universal Studios is best known for its 1930's horror genre.\n\nSIGNIFICANT OTHERS\n\nAn entire book can be dedicated to the number of studios that have come and gone through the ages. Certain movie studios however have made significant contributions to the movie industry.\n\nHere are just a few.\n\nWalt Disney Company\n\nThe Walt Disney Company was formed in 1923 in the rear of a small office occupied by Holly-Vermont Realty in Los Angeles, California. Walt and Roy Disney produced a series of short live-action/animated films that were collectively called the \"Alice Comedies.\" Outgrowing their space, the Disney brothers moved next door to larger facilities, under the name Disney Bros. Studio. In 1925, the Disneys began construction on a new studio on Hyperion Avenue in Los Angeles. In 1937, the Disney Studios produced the first animated feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This film proved to all that audiences were ready for full length animated feature films. With profits from this film, the studio acquired 51 acres in Burbank to house a new modern studio specifically for making animated films. The Studio lot was again expanded during the 1950s to include sound stages and production craft facilities. They purchased the 700-acre Golden Oak Ranch in Santa Clarita in 1959.\n\nMongram Picture Corporation\n\nW. Ray Johnston founded Monogram Picture Corporation in 1930 and produced many low budget features. Monogram merged with Consolidated Film Industries, Mascot, and Liberty to form a new company called Republic Pictures, headed by Herbert Yates of Consolidated in 1935. After a short time, Johnston and Trem Carr realized that they had more independence on their own so they left Republic and re-started Monogram. In 1943, they purchased 1725 Fleming Street in East Hollywood (formerly Charles Ray Productions). Monogram expanded its facilities by purchasing two adjacent lots, one of which faced Sunset Boulevard leading to their address. In order to film some bigger budget motion pictures, Monogram formed the Allied Artist subsidiary. In 1953, they changed the name of the company to Allied Artist and by 1964 moved their headquarters to New York. The Public Broadcasting Station, KCET, purchased their Hollywood Studio in 1971.\n\nRepublic Pictures\n\nRepublic Pictures was formed 1935 by the merger of Consolidated Film Industries, Mascot, Monogram and Liberty, and was headed by mastermind Herbert Yates, Shortly thereafter, Monogram's W. Ray Johnston and Trem Carr realized that they had more independence on their own so they left Republic and re-started Monogram. Republic opened their production facilities in Studio City, California. Republic Pictures built an impressive pool of talent, including all of the most popular cowboy (singing and non-singing), villains and character actors. Republic was known as the \"king of serials and westerns.\" The company closed its doors in 1959.\n\nSelznick International/David O. Selznick\n\nDavid O. Selznick was the son of independent film producer Lewis J. Selznick, founder of Selznick Pictures. After the fall of Selznick Pictures, David worked for various studios until he finally went independent. . Merian C. Cooper got his Pioneer partners interested in a deal with Selznick. Pioneer evolved into Selznick International Pictures, formed on October 15, 1935. Selznick International was capitalized at a remarkable $3 million - without one dollar contributed by David O. Selznick. He moved into the colonial style studio built by Thomas Ince and Triangle Studios and formerly owned by Cecil B. DeMille. He liquidated Selznick in 1940 and formed David O. Selznick Productions, and organized a company called the Selznick Studio. He organized Vanguard Films in 1942, as well as a division to specialize in medium-budget movies. In 1946, Selznick created his own distribution company, Selznick Releasing Organization. The 1957's A Farewell to Arms was the last film Selznick personally produced.\n\nAmerican International Pictures/AIP\n\nAmerican International Pictures was created in 1954 as American Releasing Corporation by James H. Nicholson (sales manager of the RealArt Production Company) and Samuel Z. Arkoff (a Hollywood lawyer). They introduced and refined the concept of pre-selling the \"B\" films based on their poster artwork, utilizing the artistic talents of Albert Kallis and the creativity of Paul Blaidell.. In 1956, American Releasing Corporation was renamed American International Pictures. AIP produced film subjects targeted to teenagers, including action, comedy and horror. In 1966, they introduced the biker-film genre. The 1970's brought about several changes in AIP. They began expanding their products by purchasing foreign sci-fi and horror films and financing more mainstream films. By the late 1970's, they were producing big-budget movies, which ultimately led to their downfall. In 1979, AIP merged with Filmways.\n\nAND THE BEAT GOES IN\n\nMovie studios and the films they produce are the backbone of the motion picture industry. There have been and are literally hundreds of studios around the world, creating and producing films daily. This chapter merely focuses on a few studios whose contributions to the growth and evolution of the movie industry are significant. However, this is no way is meant to underplay the significance of other studios not mentioned above."
