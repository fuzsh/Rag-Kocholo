        "text": "Action! - The Master & The Fan: De Palma's Bags of Tricks Place Him Above Every Other Fan\n\nBrian De Palma's career is surely intriguing, owing to the films he wanted to put to the big screen, ranging from unsettling and fantastic thrillers to a wacky comedy. But, like his hero Hitchcock, I believe the man enjoyed his humour.\n\nAnd, to be honest, of all the comedies he's directed, this one was the most solid, mainly to the interplay between DeVito and Piscopo, who oozes a contagious energy. The writing may be clichéd, but there are some funny moments, and unlike Sidney Lumet's try on Family Business, this one truly works and entertains. De Palma even manages to sneak in some of his camera trickery and make it his own.\n\nAll in all, an entertaining mobster film that manages to delight largely because of the contribution of its lead stars.\n\nTODAY SCHEDULE\n\nRope\n\nStage Fright\n\nWise Guys\n\nThe Death Artist\n\ni guess the idea is supposed to be \"what if abbott and costello were lowly henchmen in Mean Streets?\" not a bad idea honestly but a couple physical gags aside (like the church murder) this just isn't very funny, mostly a series of bland caricatures shouting at each other. de palma couldn't appear to be less interested in the material if he tried, even his signature split diopter shots are uninspired here.\n\n2.6? Wtf? It wasn’t that bad at all. Sure, it’s not De Palma’s best work but it was way more entertaining than some of the other shit I’ve seen. Danny DeVito is hilarious as always and this had a lot of elements of a good road trip/buddy movie. Anyway, this marks the end of my De Palma marathon, I’m sure I’ll eventually get around to some of his really early work and others but for now I’m moving on. Next up: finishing Paul Thomas Anderson and Park Chan-wook’s filmographies.\n\nBrian De Palma Ranked\n\nBrian De Palma has made bad films. He has made critical failures that later received due recognition and smashing successes that have endured ever since. But I'd argue none are so specifically unremarkable as 'Wise Guys', made between two such hits ('Scarface', 'The Untouchables') and immediately following one only fully appreciated later ('Body Double'). Yet no one remembers 'Wise Guys' and rightfully so.\n\nHarry (Danny DeVito) and Moe (Joe Piscopo) are to low-level thugs working under a Newark mafioso. Their usual duties are taking out the trash and doing their boss Costello's dirty laundry. Normally euphemisms in this world, yet they're so hapless it's purely genuine. Their latest task is to place a cash bet, using their boss's money, on…\n\nThis uninspired mob comedy is a curio any way you slice it, particularly so because it happened right the middle of De Palma's otherwise flawless '80s run. With the exceptions of an occasional stylistic flourish and the opening TAXI DRIVER riff, very little about the form or the material feels like he had his heart in it. The actors are having fun, especially DeVito, but the laugh ratio isn't enough to sustain even its brief 90 minutes."
