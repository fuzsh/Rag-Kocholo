        "text": "OF ALL THE whackings, beatings, and ritual humiliations served up over the 86 hours of The Sopranos, one of its cruelest assaults is verbal. It comes late—midway through the sixth and final season's second half—and takes place a 20-hour trip down I-95 from the show's usual North Jersey locale. Tony Soprano is on the lam and getting paranoid in Miami with his mostly loyal capo Paulie Gualtieri, who is entertaining their much younger dinner companions with tales of the good old days. Noticing his skipper looking irritable, Paulie asks if everything is okay. The boss, normally gregarious, is being kinda quiet.\n\n\"That's 'cause,\" Tony says, James Gandolfini pushing his big brown bear frame away from the table, \" 'Remember when' is the lowest form of conversation.\"\n\nOn a sunny afternoon in late spring in Santa Monica, David Chase, the Sopranos creator who in 1998 got an HBO series order he was pretty sure he wouldn't and then went on to revolutionize the very idea of American TV over the next nine years, was laughing when presented with the line. Before landing in the script, it had bounced around in his head since a buddy at West Essex High had said it decades ago.\n\n\"He was a real smart guy, great guitar player, kind of a pissant in a way,\" says Chase. \"It's so awful. It's so cutting. It really is so nasty.\"\n\nIt is also indelible. So much so that when, a few years ago, news started getting out that Chase was going to revisit the Sopranos characters for a prequel movie set in part against the Newark riots of 1967, some of the show's more obsessive online fans held it up to justify their anxieties about the project. Not that such concerns about re-treading the past for new material would faze the man who once had Tony's psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, explaining Proust's madeleines by way of gabagool to the boss of North Jersey, and who mined his own experiences with an overbearing Italian American lowercase-f family for his life's great work.\n\n\"That's what being a writer is,\" Chase says with a shrug.\n\nChase was already a TV lifer by the time Tony Soprano entered the American cultural consciousness via that therapist-chic anteroom on January 10, 1999. Now 76, Chase grew up in North Jersey and went to film school in the era of director as auteur. After a long and lucrative network-TV career writing and producing for the likes of The Rockford Files and Northern Exposure, he thought he was onto something with a pilot script about a mob boss working out (among other things) his mommy issues in therapy. HBO, then in the very early stages of becoming the greatest thing to happen to television since coaxial cable, ordered a pilot and then sat on it for more than a year. At one point in the drawn-out process, Chase was maybe hours away from taking a job running the X-Files spinoff Millennium for Fox.\n\n\"The way I see it is, I was plucked out just in the nick of time,\" Chase says, still genuinely marveling at his own good fate. \"Before the train hit.\"\n\nIn 2021 it is impossible to truly remember just how jolting The Sopranos was in 1999—for the quality of its writing and execution, of course, but at a more elemental level, for its willingness to explore its characters' interior lives and its audience's attraction to them. It had slapstick and Jung. It shocked and transgressed, titillated and left viewers hanging. Most thrillingly of all, at the turn of the century, it respected its viewers' intellects up to and including—though some will debate this— the final frame. (For those of us who did not have premium cable and had to rent it one DVD at a time at Blockbuster, it also encouraged a sort of proto-binge-watching.) In doing so, The Sopranos paved the road for all the prestige content to come— a little of it brilliant, most of it now just as trite as the network notes Chase was trying to get away from back then.\n\n\"The networks had this unerring sense to go for just what made the thing good and tell you to take it out,\" he recalls. \"They would always know that that's where your heart was.\"\n\nA year-plus of quarantining helped make The Sopranos a hot property once again. It is the stuff of memes and Gen Z fan accounts. Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa, who played Christopher Moltisanti and Bobby Bacala, respectively, have a hit podcast based on their rewatching of the show. In July, the second \"SopranosCon\" fan convention was held in Atlantic City. This renewed interest has somewhat surprised Chase, who has said in the past that he didn t think the series would age particularly well in the audience's minds. \"What I really thought was that a lot of their references were not in play anymore,\" he says. \"The phones are different. That's the big one for people.\"\n\n\"People started telling me, 'My son is 17. He wants to go to film school,' \" Chase says. '\"He watches your show all the time....' It was so interesting to me. I thought, What the hell is going on now?\"\n\nAs best he can figure, it is our eternal fascination with outlaws, a subject the series probed often. Or it might be the appeal of exploring the idea, expressed in the pilot, that all of us 21st-century Americans have arrived for the story's last chapters. Also: \"I think Christopher and Paulie were probably huge attractions.\"\n\nAll of this freights the October 1 arrival of the prequel film, The Many Saints of Newark, with even more anticipation. (It will be on HBO Max simultaneously for 31 days.) Chase, who wrote the movie with Lawrence Konner, first began thinking of returning to the characters a few years ago. There was a never-used idea for a flashback episode around Johnny Boy and Junior Soprano, and when Warner Bros. Pictures chairman Toby Emmerich floated the idea of revisiting the series, Chase felt ready. He had by then directed his debut feature, 2012's semiautobiographical Not Fade Away, and was set to direct Saints too but eventually ceded it to longtime Sopranos director Alan Taylor.\n\nThe movie focuses largely on Dickie Moltisanti, father of Christopher, who winds up at war with a former associate after the 1967 Newark riots. Along the way, the film offers a view of a preteen and high school-age Tony Soprano, played by Michael Gandolfini, whose father died in 2013 at age 51.\n\n\"I looked at some tape, to see if he could put one word in front of the other,\" Chase says. \"But no, I had no hesitancy. I just had this sneaking suspicion that the DNA was going to be the same.\"\n\nIn the course of its two or so hours, the movie comes again and again to two other of The Sopranos' great themes: the cycles of violence we perpetuate as a species and the Herculean effort required to make progress on a personal level, never mind societal. All of which was cast into relief last year. Filming had been largely completed in 2019, and the production took a long pause because of COVID, during which the 2020 uprisings took place. In the summer of 1967, Chase was 22, driving from the burbs to pick up his future wife at work at Prudential Insurance each day. Seeing the riots and the living conditions that had brought them on settled on his psyche. \"What was going through my head was 'God, it was still the same; I can't believe it,' \" he said of watching the news last summer.\n\nLong ago, when Chase first left North Caldwell for L.A., he'd had an idea for a script about four guys riding around in a tank during those fraught days in Newark. The Many Saints of Newark is not that movie, so it's clear Chase still has projects in the desk drawer to play with. He says he'd do TV again, but a limited series is more his speed. The Sopranos, especially those last few seasons, seemed to take its toll.\n\n\"Features are still my first love,\" he says, before doing the mental math on what's become of the entertainment business in the 20-something years since Tony's first therapy appointment. \"I don't know. Is there a feature business? Do movies really exist?\""
