        "text": "CHICAGO — The second wave of Robert Hess’ massive Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes collection hits the market Thursday, February 15 at Potter and Potter. The first sale in April 2023 was just a sampling of the amazing collection that Hess has amassed since the 1980s. Bidding is now available at LiveAuctioneers.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) is best remembered for his series of Sherlock Holmes adventures, but like other working authors of the period, he would accept commissions to write from outside parties. One such work, titled Uncle Bernac, was written by Doyle as part of the Gerard Saga, which appeared in The Queen and Manchester Weekly Times. Written completely by hand and apparently with much consternation (“I am labouring heavily over that wretched little Napoleonic book. It has cost me more than any big book. I never seem to be quite key, but I must slog through it somehow”), it was completed in 1896 in both Egypt and London. The lot is estimated at $30,000-$40,000.\n\nConan Doyle’s The Lost World, a 1912 adventure about dinosaurs roaming the earth, would become a huge silent film hit worldwide. This first English edition, second issue of the large paper edition of the book comes with an incredibly rare dust jacket featuring a dinosaur footprint, and is noted by Potter and Potter to be the first such copy ever to appear at auction. It has an estimate of $15,000-$18,000.\n\nFirst National Pictures licensed The Lost World for its 1925 adventure-romance film that is best remembered for the amazing stop-motion animation of Willis O’Brien, who would go on to animate King Kong in 1933. Potter and Potter believes this title lobby card is the only example to remain in existence, and gave it an estimate of $5,000-$10,000.\n\nSidney Paget (1860-1908) served as illustrator on Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes works. This dressing gown, aka bathrobe, was the inspiration for Paget’s illustrations of Holmes wearing a dressing gown in at least six illustrations (out of a total of 13 illustrations of Holmes in a dressing gown). It is estimated at $2,000-$4,000."
