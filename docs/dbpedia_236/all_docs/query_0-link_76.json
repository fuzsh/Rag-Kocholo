He has been a pillar of support for the family. My grandmother often tells us how obedient he was as a child. He always obeyed everything his parents told him and constantly worked towards achieving his academic goals. He was also good in sports. Besides, he was always ready to help his fellow students. He also helped my grandmother with the household chores in his free time. His dedication towards his work and his helpful nature inspires us to become better human beings.\n\nEven today, his nature hasn’t changed a bit. He is appreciated for his hard working nature and has helped his department achieve many a milestones. His boss and other colleagues always praise him for his dedication towards work. He is equally considerate about the household tasks. He helps my mother with the household work. He also helps us with our homework and other assignments. He plays with us whenever he finds time and also takes us out for recreation regularly. Apart from this, he is always ready to extend help to our neighbours and relatives whenever there is any need.\n\nAnother quality my father possesses is that he is a believer of holistic living. He takes utmost care of his physical health by eating right, taking proper rest and exercising and teaches us the same. After all, a healthy body breeds a healthy mind.\n\nMy Father My Hero Essay 300 Words\n\nMy father is my mentor, my hero and my best friend. He has been there for me at every step in life and supported me in all my decisions. He has taught me a lot and continues to shower his words on wisdom.\n\nMy Father Believes in Keeping Life Simple\n\nMy father believes in leading a simple life. Though he earns well and can afford a luxury car and a big bungalow. However, he still continues to live in a small flat. His needs are minimal and he has taught us the same values. He believes in spending a good amount of his salary to social work. He is a part of a non-profit organization that is dedicated towards providing food and education to the underprivileged children. Every Saturday he visits these children and distributes fruits and other eatables among them.\n\nHe also gives free mathematics classes to these students in the charity school run by the organization. Many a times, he also takes us along. He has taught us how to share and care. I and my sister have inculcated this value from him. We also do our bit to light up a smile on the faces of these children. This is true joy for us. No amount of toys, holiday trips and visits to restaurants can render such a joyful feeling.\n\nJust like my father, I also love keeping it simple. I have understood that “needs can be met but greed cannot”. I am not keen on buying new bags, clothes and accessories every now and then. I only buy things when I truly need them. I love accompanying my father to the places he visits for his charity work and wish to join one such non-profit organization as I grow old.\n\nConclusion\n\nI am proud of my father. He is a noble soul who is dedicated towards helping others. His teachings and values inspire me to become a better human being.\n\nMy Father My Hero Essay 400 Words\n\nMy father is someone I look up to. He is highly qualified and is extremely dedicated towards his work. His dedication towards the family is as much as it is towards his work and this is one quality about him that I admire the most.\n\nMy Father Renders the Best Advice\n\nWhenever I need an advice I know whom to turn to. It is my father. Children are more attached to their mothers and mostly share all their secrets with them. However, in my case it is different. I share all my secrets with my father and go running to him whenever I am confused about anything in life. He has a clear perspective about life and knows exactly how to calm my chaotic thoughts. Whether I have a fight with my friends or am unable to concentrate on studies or am unable to choose which co-curricular activity to go for – I know whom to ask. He knows me extremely well and is also worldly wise and thus gives advice keeping both his experiences and my nature in mind.\n\nMy Father – The Backbone of Our Family\n\nMy father knows his responsibilities extremely well and never tries to escape from them. He is constantly there for us fulfilling each and every responsibility of our family. He is like the backbone of our family. From fulfilling our financial needs to taking care of the emotional upheavals – he is always there standing strong besides us. I have learned a lot from this attitude of his. He has taught us how we must all take our responsibilities seriously and fulfil them happily. Taking inspiration from him, me and my brother also complete every little task and responsibility assigned to us sincerely. If every member of the family takes his responsibilities seriously then everything will remain well-coordinated. There would be less stress and relationships would be sweeter.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy father is indeed my hero. He has given us good values and brought out the best in us. He is not just my father. He is my best friend and my hero.\n\nMy Father My Hero Essay 500 words\n\nWe all love our parents but I am lucky that I also draw inspiration from them. I look up to my father as a source of motivation and inspiration. He is my hero in the true sense. I admire his love towards his family, dedication towards work and concern for the environment and people around.\n\nDedication towards Improving the Environment\n\nMy father is a true nature lover. He loves plants and this is the reason why we have turned our terrace into a garden. Earlier, we only had some pots kept at some distance from each other on the terrace but now we have plants all over the place. However, his love for nature is not just limited to gardening at home he is also involved in improving the environment by planting more and more trees and plants in the surrounding areas. He has joined a non-profit organization that works for making the environment clean and green.\n\nHe helps the organization to further their mission by joining them every weekend. He and his team choose an area every week and do their best to clear the dried leaves and other waste products from there. They hire a sweeper to help them and do whatever they can on their own. After the cleaning drive, they plant trees and plants at suitable places in that area. Many a times he takes us along for help.\n\nHe was also invited to my school to sensitize the students to make the environment clean and green. He gave lecture on the subject to help the students understand the importance of this issue. It was a proud moment for me.\n\nBelief in Woking as a Team\n\nMy father believes in working as a team. He does not expect my mother to do all the household tasks and handle the kids all on her own. He helps and supports her at every step. They both work as a team to make our house a better place to live. My father also works with us whenever we require working on some assignment we are not much familiar with. Rather than just giving us instructions and judging our skills from a distance he gets involved in the same to help us learn and understand the task better.\n\nMany of my friends share that their parents give them instructions to do certain tasks and expect them to complete them appropriately. They do not help in the process and even scold them if the task is not done properly. They also have set definition of the tasks that need to be done only by the females in the house and those that the male members should take responsibility for. I am lucky my father does not possess such a mindset. We have learned the art of working as a team from him and this has helped us at various stages in life.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy father’s dedication towards making earth a better place by contributing his bit towards improving the environment as well as his concept of working as a team are certainly two of his best qualities. I have learned a lot from these.\n\nMy Father My Hero Essay 600 words\n\nMy father is not just my hero but an inspiration for everyone around. Besides being a great father, a good husband and an obedient son, he is a very noble human being. He treats everyone alike and does not distinguish between anyone based on their caste, religion or social status. Everyone in our family, extended family and neighbourhood talks highly about him because of his extremely friendly and helpful nature. People come to him to seek advice as well as for help as they know he has the solution for every problem.\n\nAlways Ready to Help Others\n\nJust like the heroes in the Bollywood movies my father is always ready to help everyone around. I still remember the incident when one of my father’s colleagues fell seriously ill my father supported his family wholeheartedly. His colleague’s family was not financially well off. He was the only earning member in the family. His parents and wife were not only financially dependent on him but also did not know how to deal with the hospital formalities and other stuff. My father helped them during their hour of need. He used to spend hours in the hospital helping his colleague’s family with the hospital formalities.\n\nHe also arranged money for his colleague’s treatment. He contributed whatever he could and requested his other office colleague’s to contribute for the cause. He served as an inspiration for others. Many of his colleagues came forward to contribute their bit for the treatment. Soon, the funds were met and the treatment was completed. I remember the day when that colleague and his family visited our family after his recovery and thanked my father with all their heart. This incident has left a mark on my heart. I feel proud of my father whenever I think of it.\n\nMy father has taught me how we must be ready to help those around us and how a little help from us can make a difference in other people’s life.\n\nStriking Work Life Balance\n\nAnother quality of my father that I truly admire is that he is very hard working. He is appreciated for his hard work and dedication at work. He won several awards during his school and college days and this inspires me to work hard and earn appreciation too. Even in his office he has won the employee of the year award, most hardworking team member award and many other accreditation. I have seen him working for hours whenever his work demands. At times, he even works on holidays. However, this does not mean that he ignores his family and gives priority to his work. He knows how to maintain work life balance and we love this thing about him.\n\nMany of my friends share that their fathers are extremely engrossed in their office tasks. They come home late from work and also have to go out with colleagues on the weekends. But I am lucky that my father values his personal relationships as much as his work. He does not take his family for granted. He makes sure he comes home on time and spends time with us. He also takes us out regularly. Besides, he helps my mother with small household tasks to share her load.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy father is very clear about the fact that family comes first. So, even though he is always ready to help others and is extremely dedicated towards his office work he does not ignore us in the event. He in fact, involves us in many of his tasks instead of leaving us behind waiting for him. This helps in two ways. We stay close to him and also learn from his good deeds.\n\nMy Father My Hero FAQs\n\nHow to write an essay about my dad as my hero?\n\nTo write about my dad as my hero, think about his qualities and actions that inspire you.\n\nCan you provide 10 lines about my father as my hero in English?\n\nCertainly!
