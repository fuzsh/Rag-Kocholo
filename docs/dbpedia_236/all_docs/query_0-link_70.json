The National Film Awards are organized by the Directorate of Film Festivals, under the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. They celebrate films that exhibit not only aesthetic and technical excellence but also social relevance, signifying the power of cinema as a medium of both art and impact.\n\nHistory of National Film Awards\n\nEstablished in 1954, the National Film Awards is a highly prestigious and eagerly anticipated event in India. The President of India presents these awards, and it includes a public screening of the winning films.\n\nSince its inception in 1954, the National Film Awards have evolved significantly. Originally known as ‘State Awards,’ they featured two President’s Gold Medals, two certificates of merit, and silver medals for about twelve regional films. Initially, the Regional Best Award was given to the National Best Film itself. However, over time, the number of awards has grown.\n\nIn 1968, separate awards were introduced for artists and technicians, starting with the films of 1967. Nargis Dutt and Uttam Kumar were the first recipients of the Best Actress (then called Urvashi) and Best Actor (then called Bharat) Awards, respectively.\n\nThese awards are presented in three categories: Features, Non-Features, and Best Writing on Cinema. Recognizing excellence in various cinematic achievements, Features and Non-Features categories honor outstanding contributions in different aspects of filmmaking. The ‘Best Writing on Cinema’ category promotes the study and appreciation of cinema as an art form by encouraging the publication of books, articles, reviews, newspaper coverage, and studies related to the film industry.\n\nThe National Film Awards aim to foster the production of films that exhibit aesthetic and technical excellence while also addressing social issues. They contribute to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the diverse cultures within India through the medium of cinema, ultimately promoting national unity and integrity.\n\nAn expert jury, consisting of individuals distinguished in the fields of cinema, arts, and humanities, is responsible for selecting the award winners."
