This was when narrative filmmaking (The Great Train Robbery, Uncle Tom’s Cabin) and the world’s first movie studio to rely entirely on artificial light (in New York City) were introduced. But it is almost impossible to speak of a Canadian film industry at the birth of cinema.\n\nThe first public screening of a film in Canada took place in Montreal on 28 June 1896. Two years earlier, Andrew and George Holland of Ottawa had opened the world’s first Kinetoscope parlour in New York City featuring Thomas Edison’s latest invention. In July 1896, the Holland brothers introduced Edison’s Vitascope to the Canadian public in Ottawa’s West End Park. Among the scenes shown was The Kiss, starring May Irwin, a Broadway actress from Whitby, Ontario. On 31 August, the first screening in Toronto took place at Robinson’s Musée on Yonge Street. The first screening in Vancouver was in December 1898.\n\nThe first Canadian films were produced in the fall of 1897, a year after the Montreal debut. They were made by James Freer, a Manitoba farmer, and depicted life on the Prairies. Some of his films were Arrival of CPR Express at Winnipeg, Pacific and Atlantic Mail Trains and Six Binders at Work in a Hundred Acre Wheatfield. In 1898, sponsored by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), Freer toured England with his “home movies.” They were collectively entitled Ten Years in Manitoba. They were so successful that the federal government sponsored a second tour by Freer in 1902.\n\nThat same year, the CPR hired a British company to bring together a group of filmmakers, known as the Bioscope Company of Canada, to produce Living Canada. This series of 35 scenes depicting Canadian life was designed to encourage British immigration to Canada. The series included the first fictional drama made in Canada, the 15-minute-long Hiawatha, The Messiah of the Ojibway (1903). Also in 1903, Léo-Ernest Ouimet established Canada’s first film exchange in Montreal. He opened the first theatre in Montreal in 1906, followed in 1907 by the largest (1,200 seats) luxury theatre in North America. It was also in Montreal.\n\nThe CPR continued to produce films promoting immigration into the 1930s. In 1910, it hired the Edison Company to produce 13 story films to dramatize the special virtues of settling in the Canadian West. (See also: History of Settlement in the Canadian Prairies.) These promotional films were characteristic of most Canadian productions through 1912. They were financed by Canadians but made by non-Canadians. Their objective was to sell Canada or Canadian products abroad. The few Canadians who produced their own films (such as Ouimet in Montreal, Henry Winter in Newfoundland and James Scott in Toronto) made only newsreels or travelogues. Meanwhile, American film companies were beginning to use Canada as the setting for narrative films. Many of them featured villainous French Canadian lumberjacks, Métis, gold prospectors and noble Mounties.\n\nAfter 1912, film companies in several Canadian cities began producing fiction as well as factual films. In Halifax, the Canadian Bioscope Company made the first Canadian feature, Evangeline (1913). It was based on the Longfellow poem about the expulsion of the Acadians. It was a critical and financial success. The company made several other less successful films before folding in 1915. The British American Film Company of Montreal, one of several short-lived companies in that city, produced The Battle of the Long Sault (1913). In Toronto, the Conness Till Film Company made several comedy and adventure films in 1914 and 1915. In Windsor, Ontario, the All Red Feature Company produced The War Pigeon (1914), a drama about the War of 1812.\n\nEarly Government Censors and Film Boards\n\nFrom the beginning, the regulation of film content, distribution and exhibition was a provincial matter. Each province set its own standards and practices. In 1911, Ontario established the first Board of Censors in North America and Manitoba passed an act that delegated film censorship to the City of Winnipeg. Ontario’s board was considered the gold standard across North American jurisdictions. British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec established active censor boards in 1913. Manitoba created a proper provincial board in 1916.\n\nThe Ontario Motion Picture Bureau (OMPB) was the first state-sponsored film organization in the world. It was founded in May 1917 to provide “educational work for farmers, school children, factory workers and other classes.” Its mandate was to produce films that would advertise Ontario and promote infrastructure projects. The OMPB initially contracted all production to private companies in Toronto. In 1923, it purchased the Trenton Studios and began making its own films. (The first movie studio in Canada, the Trenton Studios opened as Adanac Films in Trenton, Ontario, in 1917.)\n\nAt its peak in 1925, the OMPB distributed 1,500 reels of film per month. It used 28mm, non-theatrical safety stock in order to avoid the fire hazard posed by 35mm nitrate stock. Its distribution system became outdated in the late 1920s when 16mm film stock replaced 28mm. After becoming inefficient and irrelevant, the OMPB was shut down in October 1934. However, it established a legacy of government involvement in Canadian filmmaking that would become a defining feature of the Canadian film industry.\n\nThe Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau was founded as the Exhibits and Publicity Bureau in 1918. It was the first national film production unit in the world. Its purpose was to produce films that promoted Canadian trade and industry. As the minister of Trade and Commerce put it in 1924, the Bureau “was established for the purpose of advertising abroad Canada’s scenic attractions, agricultural resources and industrial development.”\n\nThe Bureau produced a series of theatrical short films called Seeing Canada. It distributed the series theatrically in Canada and abroad. By 1920, the Bureau maintained the largest studio and post-production facility in Canada. It also distributed its films to numerous countries around the world. But for all its successes in production and distribution, the Bureau never attempted to develop a domestic film production industry in Canada. In fact, it actively discouraged it. Instead, it favoured a business model that saw Canada as a branch plant of the American industry. (See also: Staple Thesis.) Bernard E. Norrish, the Bureau’s first director, stated that Canada “had no more use for a large moving picture studio than Hollywood had for a pulp mill.”\n\nThe Bureau focused on travelogues and industrial films through the 1920s and 1930s. It made sporadic attempts at more meaningful projects, such as Lest We Forget (1935) and The Royal Visit (1939). However, the Bureau didn’t convert to sound films until 1934. It was effectively replaced in 1939 by the creation of the National Film Board (NFB). The NFB officially absorbed the Bureau in 1941.\n\nExpansion and Production, 1917–1923\n\nThe growth of Canadian nationalism around the First World War resulted in a brief flurry in Canadian production and other aspects of the film industry. The first widely released Canadian newsreels appeared. Feature film production also expanded, as did the Canadian-owned Allen Theatres chain and associated distribution companies. The motion picture bureaus established by the Ontario government in 1917, and the federal government in 1918, also contributed to the boom in activity.\n\nThis optimistic period of expansion was led by a number of enterprising producers. George Brownridge was principal promoter of Canada’s first film studio, Adanac Films (opened in Trenton, Ontario, in 1917). He produced three feature films, including the anti-Communist The Great Shadow (1919). Léo-Ernest Ouimet was a producer, exhibitor and distributor who established the country’s first film exchange in 1903. He also opened Canada’s first luxury theatre in Montreal in 1907. Blaine Irish was head of Filmcraft Industries. He produced the feature Satan’s Paradise (1922) and two successful theatrical short film series. Bernard Norrish was the first head of the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau. He was later head of Associated Screen News (ASN). Charles and Len Roos were producers, directors and cameramen of many films, including the feature Self Defence (1916). And finally, A.D. “Cowboy” Kean was an early cameraman and producer."
