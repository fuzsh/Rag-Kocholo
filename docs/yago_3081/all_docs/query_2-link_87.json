        "text": "Kamal Haasan's list of controversies is almost as long as his impressive filmography.\n\nOne of the greatest actors of our time, Kamal Haasan, has courted quite a few controversies in recent times.\n\nFor several decades now, religious and political organisations, right wing and pro-Tamil groups have been objecting to his films, mostly on trivial grounds, like the title or lyrics.\n\nHere's a roundup of Haasan’s films that have got into trouble over the years:\n\nThevar Magan (1992)\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan in Thevar Magan.\n\nThevar Magan, one of Kamal Haasan’s earliest films, was a huge success and won five National Awards, including one for Best Feature Film in Tamil.\n\nKamal received the award as producer of the film.\n\nThe film was criticised for equating violence with the Thevar community.\n\nHey Ram (2000)\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan and Shah Rukh Khan in Hey Ram\n\nHey Ram won three National Awards and was chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars in the Best Foreign Film category.\n\nIt was written, directed and produced by Kamal Haasan.\n\nThe Tamil/Hindi bilingual was based on the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse.\n\nIt created a huge outcry among some political parties, who insisted that the film portrayed Gandhi in a negative light.\n\nVirumandi (2004)\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan in Virumandi\n\nKamal's super hit film Virumandi was released in 2004. It was earlier titled Sandiyar.\n\nDr K Krishnasamy, leader of Pudhiya Tamizhagam, a caste-based political organisation in Tamil Nadu, felt that the title was derogatory and would encourage caste-related violence.\n\nKamal was forced to change the title.\n\nA decade later, in August 2014, director Chozha Devan released a film titled Sandiyar and no organisation, religious or political, raised even a squeak of protest.\n\nMumbai Express (2005)\n\nImage: Movie poster of Mumbai Express\n\nThe following year, when yet another of his films was targeted, Kamal remained firm.\n\nThis time, pro-Tamil groups were against the use of an English title for a Tamil film. The film was Mumbai Express.\n\nDespite the ludicrous protests, Kamal refused to back down and released the film with the same name.\n\nManmadan Ambu (2010)\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan and Meghana in Manmadan Ambu\n\nManmadan Ambu, directed by K S Ravikumar, was criticised for the lyrics of the song Kamal Kavidhai, penned by Kamal.\n\nSome right wing groups felt that the song was too obscene. It mattered little to them that the Censor Board had cleared it.\n\nThough Kamal was unhappy, the producers, Udhayanidhi Stalin's Red Giant Movies, fearing trouble, bowed to pressure and deleted the song.\n\nVasool Raja MBBS (2004)\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan in Vasool Raja MBBS\n\nWhen Vasool Raja MBBS released, it was the turn of the medical community to be offended.\n\nK R Balasubramanian, president of the Tamil Nadu Medical Council filed a petition objecting to the title because according to him it ridiculed the medical fraternity.\n\nViswaroopam (2013)\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan and Pooja Kumar in Viswaroopam\n\nThe controversy over the 2013 spy thriller Viswaroopam got so out of hand that Kamal Haasan threatened to move out of Tamil Nadu to a more secular state.\n\nFirst it was the title of the film that offended the Hindu Makkal Katchi (a political party), which believed that Kamal, an inspiration and role model to many, should refrain from using a Sanskrit title for his film.\n\nThis was followed by protests from the Theatre Owners’ Association, who were against Kamal’s decision to release the film on the DTH (direct-to-home) platform. They felt this would result in major revenue losses for them.\n\nLater some Muslim groups sought a ban on the film claiming it hurt their religious sentiments and would destroy social harmony in the state.\n\nThe Tamil and Telugu versions of the film were released worldwide on January 25, 2013 while the Hindi version hit the screens on February 1, 2013.\n\nAfter much drama and a delay of nearly two weeks, the film was released in Tamil Nadu on February 7, 2013.\n\nUttama Villain (2015)\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan in Uttama Villain\n\nThe recently released Uttama Villain too had its share of problems.\n\nWhen the ‘first look’ poster was released, depicting Theyyam art, there was speculation that it was copied from the work of a French photographer Eric Lafforgue.\n\nThen, shortly before the release, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad filed a petition seeking a stay on the release because the lyrics of the song, Iraniyan Naadagam, penned by Kamal, would offend the followers of Lord Vishnu.\n\nThere was further delay due to some money trouble between the financier and the producer. Unfortunately, the issue was not resolved in time and all the shows on the first day had to be cancelled.\n\nPapanasam\n\nImage: Gauatami and Kamal Haasan in Papanasam\n\nPapanasam, the remake of Malayalam super hit Drishyam is scheduled to release later this year, but also ran into trouble.\n\nA Malayalam scriptwriter alleged that the film was copied from his story published as a book in May 2013 called Oru Mazhakalathu.\n\nHowever, in March this year, the court dismissed the suit filed by the scriptwriter.\n\nViswaroopam II\n\nImage: Kamal Haasan in Viswaroopam II\n\nThe sequel to the controversial Viswaroopam is in the pipeline and it remains to be seen what Kamal Haasan’s detractors find to throw at him this time.\n\nBut controversy or no controversy, people throng to the theatres to watch this brilliant actor on screen and that is Kamal Haasan’s greatest victory."
