        "text": "From a child artist to a heart throb and later emerging as a veteran who experimented with scripts and characters, actor-director-producer Kamal Haasan on Thursday, 21 February, donned a new role when he took the political plunge.\n\nAfter the successful five-decade film career, the 63-year old Haasan is entering the political theatre in Tamil Nadu at a time when there is a perceived vacuum with the death of late AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa and virtual retirement of nonagenarian DMK chief M Karunanidhi.\n\nHe used Madurai in southern Tamil Nadu as the launchpad for his political journey, keeping in with a long tradition of actors/film personalities in the state moving over from the celluloid world to politics.\n\nHowever, only a few could replicate their success in films in politics like the late Chief Ministers M G Ramachandran and his protege Jayalalithaa, besides Karunanidhi.\n\nHaasan has had a chequered film career after making his debut in 1960 Tamil film 'Kalathur Kannamma' portraying the character of an innocent orphaned boy.\n\nAfter a stint as dance assistant, he was picked up by veteran film maker and Dadasaheb Phalke award recipient late K Balachander, whose stable produced another ace, 'supestar' Rajinikanth, in the 1970s.\n\nHe has won several national and other awards during the career in which he also made his Hindi debut with the 1981 superhit 'Ek Duuje Ke Liye', directed by Balachander.\n\nKnown for his mix of romantic and action scripts as a young hero, Haasan slowly started treading the less taken path, often experimenting with scripts and characters, even as his acting prowess started earning him comparisons with thespian late Sivaji Ganesan.\n\nIf his gangster flick 'Nayagan' was often compared by his fans to Marlon Brando-starrer 'The Godfather', 'Pushpak' became a trend-setter without its dialogue-less script where only facial expressions mattered.\n\nHis frequent Twitter outbursts against the government drew ridicule from the ruling AIADMK, with some of its leaders often taunting the actor saying he should not be throwing stones at them without entering politics.\n\nIt was then that Haasan started dropping hints of taking the political plunge and recently announced that he would announce his party today.\n\nIn the run-up to the d-day, the actor met several senior politicians including Karunanidhi.\n\nHe had last year called on chief ministers of Kerala and West Bengal Pinarayi Vijayan and Mamata Banerjee respectively while Delhi Chief minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal had met the actor in Chennai.\n\n(The Quint, in association with BitGiving, has launched a crowdfunding campaign for an 8-month-old who was raped in Delhi on 28 January 2018. The baby girl, who we will refer to as 'Chhutki', was allegedly raped by her 28-year-old cousin when her parents were away. She has been discharged from AIIMS hospital after undergoing three surgeries, but needs more medical treatment in order to heal completely. Her parents hail from a low-income group and have stopped going to work so that they can take care of the baby. You can help cover Chhutki's medical expenses and secure her future. Every little bit counts. Click here to donate.)"
