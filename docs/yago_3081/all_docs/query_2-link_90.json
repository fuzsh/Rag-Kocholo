        "text": "After a gap of 36 years, the legendary pair of Kamal Haasan and Mani Ratnam, who worked together on the iconic film Nayakan, have come together again. Their upcoming project, which is Kamal Haasan's 234th film is titled Thug Life.\n\nThe poster showcases Kamal Haasan concealed face underneath a hood along with the outlines of individuals holding weapons and standing in what appears to be a body of water.\n\nThe announcement features Kamal Haasan donning long hair with rugged clothes.\n\nDuring the teaser, Kamal introduces himself as Rangaraya Sakthivel Nayakan and talks directly to the camera while a gang approaches him with weapons. He goes on to mention that he is known as Kayalpattu Kaaran and explains that from the moment he was born, people labelled him as a criminal or a Yakuza. In Japanese, the term Yakuza refers to a gangster. After saying this, Kamal removes his hood to reveal his distinctive and rough martial arts costume.\n\nThug Life is a joint production of Kamal Haasan and Mani Ratnam, under their respective banners Raaj Kamal Films International and Madras Talkies. The music for the film is being composed by AR Rahman, with editing by Sreekar Prasad. Cinematographer Ravi K Chandran and stunt choreographer duo AnbAriv are also part of the film crew. The makers have also welcomed Trisha Krishnan, Jayam Ravi and Dulquer Salmaan on board.\n\nSee Also: Kamal Haasan joins Prabhas and Rana Daggubati in the US for Project K's first look at Comic Con"
