        "text": "Chiyaan Vikram, who is currently awaiting the release ofÂ Saamy SquareÂ sometime in September, has started shooting for his next untitled project produced by Kamal Haasan’s Raaj Kamal Films International andÂ popularÂ distributor Ravindran’s Trident Arts. TheÂ poojaÂ ceremony for the film happened in Chennai yesterday (30 Aug) with the cast and crew.\n\nThis yet-untitled film will bring together Vikram and Haasan’s daughter Akshara Haasan, who was last seen in Ajith’s action thrillerÂ Vivegam,Â for the first time on screen. The movie will be directed byÂ ThoongavanamÂ helmer Rajesh M Selva, a long-standing associate of Kamal Haasan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film, which marks Chiyaan Vikram’s 56th project, also features Abi Hassan, son of veteran actor Nassar, in an important role. Talking toÂ Firstpost,Â director Rajesh Selva said, “It’s too early to reveal anything about the film. I just wrapped the day one shoot now. We have chalked out a plan to reveal everything officially at regular occasions.”\n\nIn January 2018, a source from the film’s crewÂ confirmed Â FirstpostÂ that it’s not aÂ remake of Hollywood thrillerÂ Don’t BreatheÂ as speculated by a section of media earlier. We have now learned that the film is going to be an emotional thriller with a dose of action.\n\nSrinivas Reddy has been signed to handle the film’s cinematography and national award-winning editor Praveen KL will take care of the editing work. The movie will have music composed by Ghibran, who will continue his fruitful association with Kamal Haasan and Raaj Kamal Films International after a string of previously successful films. It must be noted that Ghibran and Kamal Haasan have produced fantastic soundtracks inÂ Uttama Villain, Papanasam,Â ThoongavanamÂ and recently,Â Vishwaroopam 2.Â Kunal Rajan, another Kamal Haasan regular, will work on the film’s sound design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVikram, who has had only two releases -Â Iru MuganÂ andÂ SketchÂ - in the last two years, is all set for a promising 2018 with an excellent line-up of projects up his sleeve. His next immediate release would be Hari’sÂ Saamy Square, which is reportedly eyeing a September 20 release, followed by Gautham Menon’sÂ Dhruva Natchathiram, which is on the brink of completion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVikram is expected to complete Rajesh Selva’s film first before moving on to the Rs. 300 crore magnum-opusÂ Mahavir Karna , which was announced in January this year. Earlier, the makers said that the project would start rolling from October.Â Directed byÂ Ennu Ninte MoideenÂ fame director RS Vimal and produced the New York-based company United Film Kingdom,Â Mahavir"
