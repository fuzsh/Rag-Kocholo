        "text": "Thevar Magan’s screenplay is perfect, one of the greatest screenplays in mainstream commercial cinema (though Hey Ram, Virumandi and Apoorva Sahodarangal are all fantastically written). Kamal fixed most of the problems in Nayagan with his writing here. He was never satisfied with Nayagan (he is always talks cryptically about that film) , which is why he took another swing at the Godfather adaptation.\n\nBtw, the film was originally titled “Nammavar,” but after Sivaji Ganesan agreed to play periya thevar, Kamal changed the title to Thevar Magan as a mark of respect to the legend. The title design in the film’s posters (and I think in the film also) had sivaji and Kamal’s hand drawn faces next to Thevar and Magan respectively. And yes, Thevar Magan is the perfect title for the film. It’s obvious from his character arc, the adherence to the Thevar values, both in his valor and his sacrifice. Also, there are two instances which becomes major turning points in the film in which Kamal is explicitly addressed as Thevar Magan – one by Revathi’s father after her wedding is disrupted; that’s when he decides to marry her; and then by Nazar while challenging him for the climactic duel, in which he ends up killing him.\n\nhari prasad: The way I look at it, the title is perfect. It sounds glorious and valorous. And then then film goes about — scene by scene — dismantling these feudal notions of valour through the “mistakes” that this “Thevar Magan” keeps making.\n\nMANK: I am not ASKING for a sequel. I know there is a major filmmaker waiting with a script, but after VIKRAM proved such a blockbuster, I think Rajkamal must have decided to go with more overtly commercial outings for Kamal… I have hopes for the sequel 🙂\n\nBTW, it’s interesting how THEVAR MAGAN, in its day, was considered a solid mainstream/commercial movie. Everyone had their bets on Rajini’s PANDIAN, but this became the megahit of that Deepavali season. Today, I think it will be called “too slow”.\n\nThis was such a good episode. When you’re deep diving into movies in this format, it’s really great to listen to, and I wish it were longer.\n\nI think the time’s ripe for a sequel to Thevar Magan. In fact I think Hollywood’s already beaten us to it, with a gender swapped version which earned close to a billion dollars. This one opens with the untimely death of the Sakthivel character. Then there’s a constant tension between his sister and mother— the matriarch chieftain. Like Sakthi, the sister also sides with technology more than tradition. Like Thevar magan, there’s a big flood at the halfway point. The matriarch dies. The daughter becomes the new chief. She ends up turning into a barbarian (wearing an animal suit no less). The transformation even has a neat “vedhai naan pottathu” twist where she plants an actual seed that ensures the future of her clan. The bigger twist is what happens to the equivalent of the Nassar character in the end which is almost identical to the Thevar Magan climax but just not quite.\n\nIf they release a Tamil dubbed version, I hope they call it T’chaka Magal, although the title may not have the chanting power of Wakanda Forever.\n\nThe reason for the success of rural Masala/ realistic movies is because it is seen as a celebration of their way of living. We might look at Thevarmagan & think that it’s a comment on a flawed feudal system. What the target audience sees is a celebration of caste pride (the potri paadadi penne song is till date used to taunt oppressed caste). Even if you take Kaadhal, We may see the chittappa character as a villain and the brutality at the end as a depiction of caste pride\n\n. For a lot of audience, the brutality at the end is a vindication of their caste violence, they identify with the chittappa in Kaadhal rather than the battered young couple.\n\nI also felt the announce of sequel for Thevarmagan very cynical, given that it coincided with Kamal’s entry into politics. Seemed he is trying to cash in on caste votes with that announcement.\n\nThevarmagan is right up there with Kamal’s best work but it also feeds the caste pride of a certain target audience.\n\nThe reason for the success of rural Masala/ realistic movies is because it is seen as a celebration of their way of living.\n\nIt’s true. As someone said, a film’s success is mainly due to audiences misunderstanding its intentions. Scorsese, by making his protagonist a terrifying psycho, intended “Taxi Driver” to be a polemic on vigilantism and vigilante films, but the reason why audiences took to it is they considered it as a vigilante revengematic (in Tarantino’s words) in the vein of “Death Wish.” In both TM and Virumaandi, Kamal is using the rural film template to pretty much criticize most of the stuff about rural life and rural masala cinema that the Vijayakant\\Saratkumar\\Napolean films celebrate; the extreme violence portrayed in these films being used to show its futility , but the mass audience considers and appreciate these Kamal’s films in the same vein as those films. of course, The discerning viewer appreciates the films for what it is. That way Kamal gets a large audience for his ‘experimental’ films and they become hits- unlike a Hey Ram or Anbe Sivam.\n\nI loved this episode. It is amazing that you had a fresh approach to it even after dissecting it in other mediums and at other times. I was only 12 when I saw the movie. The impact it made on me was huge.\n\nLike you mentioned, the fact that the villain dies in the climax and yet it was not a ‘subham’ ending was mind-blowing. What better statement against violence and the value of life(even of the villain’s) can there be!\n\nAlso I enjoyed your calling out Kamal ‘s tone in the temple utsavam discussion. ‘Naa vittu kuduthudraen’ is from a place of a conciliatory ego, not from a place of love and peace. I recently noticed this very clearly. Similarly there was no need for Shivaji to start his Panchayat talk with what his brother had done in the past (how the brother had tried killing him etc). It is only natural that Nasser is riled up.\n\nAnd yet…. There is a point of view. You can happily watch the movie with the ‘Shivaji and Kamal are heroes and hence better’ perspective. That’s the mass magic of it. When you grow up in terms is movie watching, there is more waiting for you.\n\nI was not particularly aware of the caste stuff in the movie probably because I was not looking for it/ I was a Chennai-ite/ both the protagonist and antagonist were rooted in 1 caste – so it just went with the setting of the world ( where violence is a way of life), not as a statement on the caste.\n\nHowever my favorite portion of the movie is act-2. From the time in the mandapam just before his wedding with Revathi to the time he bids his final farewell to Gautami. First, it is the only portion that is not male dominated and macho. It is also tuned inwards which is always very interesting and rarer in the medium. Kamal carries the tension of his situation in his posture, his gait, his speech – in every cell of his body consistently in every shot. Most importantly, he ‘is a man, my son’. (The man Kipling talks about in If poem). The decisions he takes are hard for him. To be right is hard especially after you have been wrong. Rightaa… Rightu.\n\nBrilliant work – both him and you for critiquing it 359 degrees. There will be always be a degree more to be unearthed."
