        "text": "Writer and director Siva Anant, who is also one of the producers for 'Thug Life', shared an update on the film which marks the epic comeback of Kamal Haasan and Mani Ratnam. In an interview with IndiaToday.in, he talked about the film's shoot schedule and highlighted that the entire team understands the magnitude of this project.\n\n'Thug Life' brings the actor-director together after a hiatus of 37 years. While speaking on a call in a quick chat, Siva said everyone is so excited about the film, and they are mindful of providing that 'X-factor' to it considering its anticipation. \"It is shaping up really well. We are very excited. It has been an absolutely fabulous ride - going with Kamal Haasan and Mani Ratnam on board. The film is going to be fantastic. They are going to love it. We are loving it,\" he said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe shoot of the film began in January this year and the film's team is currently in the middle of it. Siva said they have not set any date for the completion of the shoot, but they are totally dedicated to delivering a top-notch experience. \"We are right in the middle of the shoot. We don't know the exact date of the shoot wrap-up, but we are enjoying this phase. We will make a proper announcement when we are done with the shoot, though,\" he explained.\n\nWhen asked if they had planned anything different for the epic reunion of Kamal Haasan and Mani Ratnam, he said the audience doesn't need to worry about it. \"We have done a lot in the film. Hopefully, the audience will see that. That X-factor will shine in theatres. Don't worry,\" he concluded.\n\n'Thug Life', also starring Silambarasan TR, Trisha Krishnan, Jayam Ravi, Dulquer Salmaan, Nassar, Aishwarya Lekshmi, Sanya Malhotra, Pankaj Tripathi, Rohit Saraf, and Ali Fazal, among others, is slated to hit the screens next year. However, the makers are yet to reveal the release date. The film features Haasan in the role of Rangaraya Sakthivel Nayakar and the title announcement video released earlier showed him in an action-packed avatar. It is jointly produced by Kamal Haasan, Mani Ratnam, R Mahendran and Siva Ananth. The music of the film is composed by AR Rahman."
