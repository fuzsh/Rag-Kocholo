        "text": "After impressing everyone with his performance in Kalki 2898 AD, veteran actor Kamal Haasan has returned to the big screen with yet another big-budget movie, titled Indian 2. The sequel reunites the actor-director duo of Haasan and S. Shankar, who had previously collaborated in 1996. The makers of Indian 2 have also roped in talented actors such as Siddharth, Rakul Preet Singh, Kajal Aggarwal, Priya Bhavani Shankar, Gulshan Grover, and Bobby Simha, among others.\n\nMade on a budget of Rs 250 crore, the vigilante drama revolves around Veerasekaran Senapathy (played by Kamal Haasan), who returns to India to help a young man who is adamant about exposing the truth about corrupt politicians in the country. Haasan, who reprises his role of Senapathy after 28 years on the big screen, received a huge amount as remuneration, which is equivalent to the total cost of a small-budget movie.\n\nFind out how many Crores Kamal Haasan charged for Indian 2\n\nAccording to a Times of India report, Kamal Haasan received a pay cheque of Rs 150 crore to headline Indian 2.\n\nDuring an interview with News18, Haasan discussed how the pandemic and other events impacted the budget of Indian 2. \"The budget was not just decided by the director and the script. COVID-19 decided our budget. Some of the accidents delayed the budget,\" he said. He continued, \"The tenacity of the producer and the director must be applauded even before the film becomes a hit. It’s very easy to let go if your hand is in pain, you let go. Let me leave this and go to the other one. They did not do that. Not to let go of this child, not to orphan this child was a decision taken by Lyca and Shankar.\"\n\nAccording to an India Today report, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) issued a U/A certificate for Indian 2 and even asked the makers to make five changes to the vigilante drama which is released in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi.\n\nKamal Haasan's last outing was Kalki 2898 AD where he had a limited screen presence. According to MoneyControl, Haasan earned Rs 20 crore to play the main antagonist, Supreme Yaskin, in the Nag Ashwin directorial.\n\nKamal Haasan's net worth\n\nKamal Haasan, one of the wealthiest actors in the Tamil film industry, has an estimated net worth of Rs 450 crore, according to DNA and publicly available data. In addition to his earnings from movies, Haasan earns a substantial income from brand endorsement deals, hosting Bigg Boss Tamil, his fashion label House of Khaddar, and producing movies under his production banner, Raaj Kamal Films International.\n\nThe 69-year-old actor has an impressive real estate portfolio. He owns multiple properties in Chennai, and a mansion worth crores in London. He also owns several luxurious and expensive cars, including a Lexus LX 570 (worth Rs 2.82 crore), a BMW 730LD (worth Rs 1.35 crore), and more."
