KH 233 - Rise to Rule, is a production venture of Kamal Haasan's Raaj Kamal Films International (RKFI) and the movie is written and directed by H. Vinoth of Sathuranga Vettai (2014), Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru (2017), Nerkonda Paarvai (2019), Valimai (2022) and Thunivu (2023) fame.\n\nThe announcement video of KH 233 features Kamal Haasan as a literal torch-bearer for people. It remains to be seen what director H. Vinoth has in store for the Ulaganayagan, after three back-to-back films with Ajith Kumar. KH 233 has been touted to be a political story."
