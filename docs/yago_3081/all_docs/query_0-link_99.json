        "text": "After delivering several box office blockbusters in Hindi back in the ‘80s and ‘90s, Kamal Haasan is back to mesmerise the audience with his upcoming action entertainer Vikram.\n\nThe veteran actor is currently busy promoting the film all across the country and recently opened up about the one regret that he has in his 50-year long career.\n\nHe told Indian Express about the time he approached legendary Dilip Kumar and “begged” him to star in Thevar Magan Hindi remake but the actor refused.\n\nKamal recalled, “I love acting with actors. There’s one actor whom I miss and I really wanted to work with, he was Dilip Kumar. I really held Dilip saab’s hand and begged him but he had decided not to act. I wanted to make Thevar Magan with him and me, but it didn’t happen so I gave it to another friend and he made it with Anil Kapoor saab and Amrish Puri saab (as Virasat).”\n\nDilip Kumar’s last on-screen performance came in the 1998 film Qila.\n\nReleased in 1992, Thevar Magan is considered as one of the most iconic Tamil films of all time. Directed by Bharathan, the film was written by Kamal Haasan who also starred in the lead role alongside Sivaji Ganesan, Revathi and Gauthami.\n\nIn 1997, the film was remade in Hindi by Priyadarshan as Virasat and starred Anil Kapoor in the lead role along with Amrish Puri, Tabu and Pooja Batra.\n\nThe film received positive reviews and was a box office hit.\n\nOn May 30, 2022, the film completed 25 years of its release and Anil Kapoor took to Twitter to celebrate its anniversary.\n\nHe wrote, “Dedicating the 25th Year of my personal favourite film Virasat to one of the best producers I have ever worked with! #MushirRiaz”.\n\nCheck out his tweet below:\n\nRecently, producer Mohammad Riaz of the Mushir-Riaz duo passed away at the age of 74."
