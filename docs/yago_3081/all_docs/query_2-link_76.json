        "text": "One of Kamal Haasan's much-awaited projects is KH 234 which marks the actor-director's reunion after Nayakan (1987). Speaking during one of the Bigg Boss Tamil episodes which he hosts on the weekends, Kamal Haasan revealed that the teaser of the film will be out on November 7, which marks the actor's 69th birthday.\n\nHe said, \"It's been a long time since Mani Ratnam and I joined hands for a film. Mani Ratnam has started working on the film's teaser and I have joined the shoot as well. The teaser will be released on my birthday, November 7.\"\n\nThe announcement that was made last year, introduced the logos of the production houses before presenting the tentative title of the film, KH 234. The film will have music by AR Rahman, who last scored his Tenali in 2001.\n\nThe film will be produced by Kamal Haasan, Mani Ratnam, R Mahendran and Siva Ananth, who has been a frequent collaborator of Mani Ratnam as an executive producer.\n\nKamal Haasan, who was last seen in Lokesh Kanagaraj's Vikram (2022), is busy with Indian 2 directed by Shankar. The highly anticipated sequel to the 1996 film marks the reunion of Shankar and Kamal Haasan after several years. The upcoming film also features Rakul Preet Singh, Priya Bhavani Shankar, Siddharth, Guru Somasundaram, and Bobby Simha in prominent roles. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, while Ravi Varman handles the camera.\n\nThe acclaimed actor is also busy with H Vinoth's KH 233. The film has a story penned by Kamal Haasan himself and a screenplay by Vinoth. Kamal also has Prabhas' Project K which is now titled Kalki 2898 AD, directed by Nag Ashwin in the pipeline."
