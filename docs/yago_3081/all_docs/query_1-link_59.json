        "text": "Panjagutta: Chief Minister Revanth Reddy’s remarks against Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) working president KT Rama Rao and his alleged plans to erect a statue of his father, K Chandrashekhar Rao met with a bitter response from KT Rama Rao on Tuesday. CM Reddy was speaking after garlanding the statue of Rajiv Gandhi at Punjagutta on the occasion of his birth anniversary.\n\nRevanth Reddy lashed out at KTR for threatening to remove the statue of former Prime Minister, late Rajiv Gandhi which is set to be unveiled in front of the state Secretariat.\n\nDefending the Congress party’s decision to install Rajiv Gandhi’s statue in front of the Secretariat, Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said, “When enquired I got to know that KT Rama Rao is planning to install the statue of his father and former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao.” Further in a sarcastic tone, Reddy asked, “When will his father pass away and when will the statue be installed there?”. Further the Chief Minister added “They will be slapped with chappals and thrashed, if they try to remove the Rajiv Gandhi statue.”\n\nKTR’s counter on X\n\nThe Chief Minister’s remarks were met with a sharp rebuttal from BRS working president KT Rama Rao, who accused Reddy of disrespecting Telangana’s pride and using inappropriate language, further intensifying the political rift.\n\nIn a sharp response countering Reddy’s remark, BRS working president KT Rama Rao took to X(formerly Twitter) and posted, “Mark my words Cheap Minister Revanth. We will clear out the trash from the surroundings of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar secretariat the very same day we are back in office. Can’t expect a Delhi Ghulam like you to ever understand self-respect & pride of Telangana. Using filthy language in front of school children shows your lousy thinking and uncouth upbringing. Wish you speedy healing from your mental sickness.”\n\nKukatpally: For the second consecutive day, protests by the advocates rocked the courts in the city. The Executive committee of Bar Association Kukatpally courts, called for a boycott of the court work in solidarity towards a fellow advocate P Santosh who was allegedly attacked by Borabanda police of Hyderabad Commissionerate. The protesting advocate asked the police personnel in the court to leave the premises on Tuesday.\n\nExecutive Committee of Bar Association Kukatpally Courts in their internal message circulated to the advocates read, “Dear members as decided by the extraordinary meeting in Bar Association, Tuesday at 10:00 AM, majority of members suggested to boycott the court work and later on taking up the issue with the Government in passing Advocate Protection Act. Request all brother and sister advocates to cooperate and be present in the protest at our New Court building”. The police who were present in the court premises were asked to leave as a part of the protest.\n\nEarlier in their statement, the Executive Committee of Metropolitan Criminal Court Bar Association passed a resolution to support and show solidarity to P Santosh, Advocate, Kukatpally Bar Association, who was attacked by police officers of Borabanda police station on Aug 16.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that following a complaint from the Bar Association of Kukatpally Courts, demanding stringent action against the police personnel involved in the alleged assault on advocate P Santosh, Telangana High Court on Monday ordered an inquiry. Chief Justice Alok Aradhe instructed the registrar general of the High Court to investigate and submit a report on the incident on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile Hyderabad city police in an official statement released on Monday denied the allegations. Hyderabad City Police stated Santosh obstructed a lawful raid on a house involved in illegal liquor sales. Despite multiple requests, Santosh, a tenant, refused to cooperate, delaying the operation and allowing the main suspect to escape. The police found 136 liquor bottles on the premises and registered a case. The police emphasized that no manhandling occurred and criticized the advocates for misinterpreting the situation, asserting they acted in the interest of law and justice.\n\nHyderabad: Chairman of Asian Institute of Gastroenterology (AIG) Hospitals and Padma Bhushan awardee Dr D. Nageshwar Reddy was appointed as a member of the National Task Force (NFT) which was constituted by the Supreme Court to address critical issues concerning the safety and dignity of doctors and medical professionals.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India on Tuesday constituted a National Task Force (NTF). The order was passed by a Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud, alongside Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, in a suo motu case initiated following the tragic rape and murder of a 31-year-old resident doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The task force comprising top doctors has been asked to file an interim report within three weeks and a final report within two months.\n\n“Ultimately what is equality under the constitution if women cannot be safe in their workplace.

The Supreme Court has directed the task force to examine and recommend measures to ensure the safety and well-being of medical professionals.
