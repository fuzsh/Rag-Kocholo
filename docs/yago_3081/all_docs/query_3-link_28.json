This comment was made in the presence of Kamal Haasan, the maker of the film.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\nMari stated, â€œMaamannan was also influenced by Thevar Magan. Prior to doing the films Karnan, and Pariyerum Perumal, and Maamannan, I watched Thevar Magan. Today, Thevar Magan is considered a masterpiece. Many directors used to watch this film before making their own. I did the same. When I first saw the movie, I was confused. I couldn't determine whether the film was right or wrong.\"\n\nIn 2018, during the release of \"Pariyerum Perumal,\" he made similar comments about the Kamal Haasan film. In a letter, Mari Selvaraj questioned Kamal Haasan about why he made a film like \"Thevar Magan,\" which glorifies caste atrocities.\n\n\"Thevar Magan,\" written and produced by Kamal Haasan, was released in 1992 and directed by Bharathan. Kamal played the lead role in the film.\n\n\"Maamannan\" is Mari Selvaraj's upcoming film following \"Pariyerum Perumal\" and \"Karnan.\" The film stars Udhayanidhi Stalin, Fahadh Faasil, Vadivelu, and Keerthy Suresh in lead roles. The music for the film is composed by AR Rahman. It is produced by Red Giant."
