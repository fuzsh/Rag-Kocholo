        "text": "Reactions of Trimethylsilyl Fluorosulfonyldifluoroacetate with Purine and Pyrimidine Nucleosides\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRapp, Magdalena; Cai, Xiaohong; Xu, Wei; Dolbier, William R.; Wnuk, Stanislaw F.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nDifluorocarbene, generated from trimethylsilyl fluorosulfonyldifluoroacetate (TFDA), reacts with the uridine and adenosine substrates preferentially at the enolizable amide moiety of the uracil ring and the 6-amino group of the purine ring. 2',3'-Di-O-acetyl-3'-deoxy-3'-methyleneuridine reacts with TFDA to produce 4-O-difluoromethyl product derived from an insertion of difluorocarbene into the 4-hydroxyl group of the enolizable uracil ring. Reaction of the difluorocarbene with the adenosine substrates having the unprotected 6-amino group in the purine ring produced the 6-N-difluoromethyl derivative, while reaction with 6-N-benzoyl protected adenosine analogues gave the difluoromethyl ether product derived from the insertion of difluorocarbene into the enol form of the 6-benzamido group. Treatment of the 6-N-phthaloyl protected adenosine analogues with TFDA resulted in the unexpected one-pot conversion of the imidazole ring of the purine into the corresponding N-difluoromethylthiourea derivatives. Treatment of the suitably protected pyrimidine and purine nucleosides bearing an exomethylene group at carbons 2', 3' or 4' of the sugar rings with TFDA afforded the corresponding spirodifluorocyclopropyl analogues but in low yields.

Recently, remarkable progress has been made, but to date all proposed syntheses account separately for the pyrimidine and purine ribonucleotides; no divergent synthesis from common precursors has been proposed. Moreover, the prebiotic syntheses of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides that have been demonstrated operate under mutually incompatible conditions. Here, we tackle this mutual incompatibility by recognizing that the 8-oxo-purines share an underlying generational parity with the pyrimidine nucleotides. We present a divergent synthesis of pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides starting from a common prebiotic precursor that yields the Î²-ribo-stereochemistry found in the sugar phosphate backbone of biological nucleic acids. The generational relationship between pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides suggests that 8-oxo-purine ribonucleotides may have played a key role in primordial nucleic acids prior to the emergence of the canonical nucleotides of biology.\n\nInner-shell chemical shift of DNA/RNA bases and inheritance from their parent purine and pyrimidine.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Feng; Zhu, Quan; Ivanova, Elena\n\n2008-11-01\n\nInner-shell electronic structures, properties and ionization spectra of DNA/RNA bases are studied with respect to their parent pyrimidine and purine species. Density functional theory B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ has been employed to produce the geometries of the bases, whereas LB94/et-pVQZ//B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ is used to calculate site-related Hirshfeld charges and core (vertical) ionization energies, as well as inner-shell spectra of C1s, N1s and O1s for DNA/RNA bases and their parent pyrimidine and purine species. The site-dependent variations of properties indicate the changes and inheritance of chemical environment when pyrimidine and purine become substituted. In general, although the changes are site-dependent, they are also ring-dependent. Pyrimidine bases change less significantly with respect to their parent pyrimidine than the purine bases with respect to their parent purine. Pyrimidine bases such as uracil, thymine and cytosine inherit certain properties from their parent pyrimidine, such as the Hirshfeld charge distributions and the order of core ionization energy level etc. No particular sites in the pyrimidine derivatives are engaged with a dramatic chemical shift nor with energy crossings to other sites. For the core shell spectra, the purine bases inherit very little from their parent purine, and guanine exhibits the least similarities to the parent among all the DNA/RNA bases.\n\nPrebiotic syntheses of purines and pyrimidines\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBasile, B.; Oro, J.; Lazcano, A.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe results of experimental and theoretical investigations of the prebiotic synthesis of purines and pyramidines are surveyed. Topics examined include the synthesis of purines from HCN via 4,5-disubstituted imidazole derivatives in aqueous solutions or liquid NH3, simultaneous formation of amino acids and purines by electron irradiation of CH4-NH3-H2O mixtures, synthesis of pyrimadines from cynoacetylene, energetics, formation of bases under anhydrous or concentrated conditions, formation of bases under dilute conditions, Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions, and the role of activated intermediates. It is pointed out that the precursor compounds have been detected in the interstellar medium, on Titan, and in other solar-system bodies, and that solar-nebula HCN concentrations of the order of 1-10 mM have been estimated on the basis of meteorite measurements.\n\nIsolation of Purines and Pyrimidines from the Murchison Meteorite\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGlavin, D. P.; Bada, J. K.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe origin of life on Earth, and possibly on other planets such as Mars, would have required the presence of liquid water and a continuous supply of prebiotic organic compounds. The delivery of organic matter by asteroids, comets, and carbonaceous meteorites could have contributed to the early Earth's prebiotic inventory by seeding the planet with biologically important organic compounds. A wide variety of prebiotic organic compounds have previously been detected in the Murchison CM type carbonaceous chondrite including amino acids, purines and pyrimidines'. These compounds play a major role in terrestrial biochemistry and are integral components of proteins, DNA and RNA. In this study we developed a new extraction technique using sublimation in order to isolate purines and pyrimidines from Murchison2, which is cleaner and more time efficient that traditional methods3. Several purines including adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine and xanthine were positively identified by high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet absorption detection in our Murchison extracts. The purines detected in Murchison do not correlate with the distribution of nucleobases found in geological environments on Earth4. Moreover, the abundance of extraterrestrial amino acids and the low level of terrestrial amino acid contaminants found in Murchison', support the idea that the purines in t h s meteorite are extraterrestrial in origin.\n\nIsolation of Purines and Pyrimidines from the Murchison Meteorite Using Sublimation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGlavin, D. P.; Bada, J. L.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe origin of life on Earth, and possibly on other planets such as Mars, would have required the presence of liquid water and a continuous supply of prebiotic organic compounds. The exogenous delivery of organic matter by asteroids, comets, and carbonaceous meteorites could have contributed to the early Earth s prebiotic inventory by seeding the planet with biologically important organic compounds. A wide variety of prebiotic organic compounds have previously been detected in the Murchison CM type carbonaceous chondrite including amino acids, purines and pyrimidines. These compounds dominate terrestrial biochemistry and are integral components of proteins, DNA and RNA. Several purines including adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, as well as the pyrimidine uracil, have previously been detected in water or formic acid extracts of Murchison using ion-exclusion chromatography and ultraviolet spectroscopy. However, even after purification of these extracts, the accurate identification and quantification of nucleobases is difficult due to interfering UV absorbing compounds. In order to reduce these effects, we have developed an extraction technique using sublimation to isolate purines and pyrimidines from other non-volatile organic compounds in Murchison acid extracts.\n\nGene set analysis of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites cancer therapies.\n\nPubMed\n\nFridley, Brooke L; Batzler, Anthony; Li, Liang; Li, Fang; Matimba, Alice; Jenkins, Gregory D; Ji, Yuan; Wang, Liewei; Weinshilboum, Richard M\n\n2011-11-01\n\nResponses to therapies, either with regard to toxicities or efficacy, are expected to involve complex relationships of gene products within the same molecular pathway or functional gene set. Therefore, pathways or gene sets, as opposed to single genes, may better reflect the true underlying biology and may be more appropriate units for analysis of pharmacogenomic studies. Application of such methods to pharmacogenomic studies may enable the detection of more subtle effects of multiple genes in the same pathway that may be missed by assessing each gene individually. A gene set analysis of 3821 gene sets is presented assessing the association between basal messenger RNA expression and drug cytotoxicity using ethnically defined human lymphoblastoid cell lines for two classes of drugs: pyrimidines [gemcitabine (dFdC) and arabinoside] and purines [6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine]. The gene set nucleoside-diphosphatase activity was found to be significantly associated with both dFdC and arabinoside, whereas gene set Î³-aminobutyric acid catabolic process was associated with dFdC and 6-thioguanine. These gene sets were significantly associated with the phenotype even after adjusting for multiple testing. In addition, five associated gene sets were found in common between the pyrimidines and two gene sets for the purines (3',5'-cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase activity and Î³-aminobutyric acid catabolic process) with a P value of less than 0.0001. Functional validation was attempted with four genes each in gene sets for thiopurine and pyrimidine antimetabolites. All four genes selected from the pyrimidine gene sets (PSME3, CANT1, ENTPD6, ADRM1) were validated, but only one (PDE4D) was validated for the thiopurine gene sets. In summary, results from the gene set analysis of pyrimidine and purine therapies, used often in the treatment of various cancers, provide novel insight into the relationship between genomic variation and drug response.\n\nIncrease in urinary purines and pyrimidines in patients with methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocystinuria.\n\nPubMed\n\nPorcu, Simona; Corda, Marcella; Lilliu, Franco; Contini, Liliana; Era, Benedetta; Traldi, Pietro; Fais, Antonella\n\n2010-06-03\n\nMethylmalonic aciduria combined with homocystinuria (MMA-HC) is the biochemical trait of a metabolic disorder resulting from impaired conversion of dietary cobalamin (cbl, or vitamin B12) to its two metabolically active forms. Effects on urinary purine and pyrimidine levels have not been described for this condition. Urine samples were collected from three patients with methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocystinuria and from 70 healthy subjects. Urinary purine and pyrimidine levels were quantitated by the use of LC/UV-Vis and LC/ESI/MS. Higher urine levels of pyrimidines were detected with both methods in patients compared to controls. Methylmalonic aciduria with homocystinuria is due to deficiency of the enzyme, cobalamin reductase. The enzyme defect leads to altered hepatic metabolism, which appears to modify circulating pyrimidine levels. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This metabolic route is the less costly alternative to the de novo synthesis of nucleosides and nucleotides, supplying cells with these important building blocks. Interest in nucleoside phosphorylases is not only due to their important role in metabolism of nucleosides and nucleotides, but also due to the potential medical use of the enzymes (all phosphorylases in activating prodrugs - nucleoside and nucleic base analogs, high-molecular mass purine nucleoside phosphorylases in gene therapy of some solid tumors) and their inhibitors (as selective immunosuppressive, anticancer and antiparasitic agents, and preventing inactivation of other nucleoside drugs). Phosphorylases are also convenient tools for efficient enzymatic synthesis of otherwise inaccessible nucleoside analogues. In this paper the contribution of Professor David Shugar and some of his colleagues and coworkers in studies of these remarkable enzymes carried out over nearly 40 years is discussed on the background of global research in this field.\n\nBenzene-1,4-diolâ5-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)pyrimidine (1/1)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJiang, Yan-Ke; Hou, Gui-Ge\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe asymmetric unit of title compound, C7H6N4Â·C6H6O2, contains one 5-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)pyrimidine molÂ­ecule and two half benzene-1,4-diol molÂ­ecules; the benzene-1,4-diol molÂ­ecules are located on individual inversion centers. In the pyrimidine molÂ­ecule, the imidazole ring is twisted with respect to the pyrimidine ring at a dihedral angle of 25.73â (7)Â°. In the crystal, OâHâ¯N hydrogen bonds link the molÂ­ecules to form supraÂ­molecular chains. ÏâÏ stacking is also observed in the crystal, the centroidâcentroid distance between parallel imdazole rings being 3.5543â (16)â Ã .

The sublimation of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine from lambda-DNA was tested under reduced pressure (approx. 0.5 Torr) at temperatures of >150 C. With the exception of guanine, approximately 60 -75% of each base was sublimed directly from the lambda-DNA and recovered on a coldfinger of the sublimation apparatus after heating to 450 C. Several nucleobases including adenine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil were also recovered from E. coli bacteria after heating the cells to the same temperature, although some thermal decomposition of the bases also occurred. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using sublimation to isolate purines and pyrimidines from native E. coli DNA and RNA without any chemical treatment of the cells.\n\nIncorporation of Exogenous Purines and Pyrimidines by Methanococcus voltae and Isolation of Analog-Resistant Mutants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBowen, Timothy L.; Whitman, William B.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nMethanococcus voltae incorporated exogenous adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and uracil, but not thymine. Growth of M. voltae was also sensitive to purine and pyrimidine analogs. Of the 20 analogs tested, 12 were inhibitory at 1 mg/ml. The most effective inhibitors were purine analogs with endocyclic substitutions. Nucleoside analogs and analogs with exocyclic substitutions or additions were less effective. Four purine analogs, 8-aza-2,6-diaminopurine, 8-azaguanine, 8-azahypoxanthine, and 6-mercaptopurine and one pyrimidine analog, 6-azauracil, were especially toxic. The MICs were 20, 0.5, 2.0, 80, and 10 Î¼g/ml, respectively. Spontaneous resistance mutants were isolated for these five analogs. The MICs for these mutants were 20.5, 8.2, >65, >41, and 20.5 mg/ml, respectively. These concentrations far exceeded the solubilities of the analogs and represented an increase in resistance of at least three orders of magnitude. In addition to demonstrating cross resistance to several of the analogs, four of these mutants lost the ability to incorporate exogenous bases. These appeared to be mutations in the salvage pathways for purines and pyrimidines. In contrast, the mutant resistant to 6-mercaptopurine was not defective in purine uptake. Instead, it degraded 6-mercaptopurine. In the presence or absence of high concentrations of the analogs, the growth rates of the resistant mutants were no less than one-half of the growth rate of the wild type in the absence of the analog. The high level of resistance and rapid growth are very desirable properties for the application of the mutants in genetic experiments.

Conformational studies by NMR.\n\nPubMed\n\nDittrich, K; Gu, J; Tinder, R; Hogan, M; Gao, X\n\n1994-04-12\n\nThe antiparallel purine.purine.pyrimidine DNA triplex, RRY6, which contains a T.C.G inverted triplet in the center of the sequence, was examined by proton and phosphorous two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The local conformation of the T.C.G triplet (T4.C11.G18) and the effect of this triplet on the global helical structure were analyzed in detail. The formation of the T.C.G triplet is confirmed by a set of cross-strand NOEs, including unusual cross-strand NOEs between the third strand and the pyrimidine strand as opposed to the purine strand of the duplex. NMR data suggest that the T.C.G triplet may be present in an equilibrium between a non-hydrogen-bonded form and a T(O4)-C(NH2) hydrogen-bonded form and that there is a distortion of the in-plane alignment of the three bases. The flanking G.G.C base triplets are well-defined on the 5'-side of T4, but somewhat interrupted on the 3'-side of T4. The effect of the third strand binding on the Watson-Crick duplex was probed by an NMR study of the free duplex RY6. NMR parameters are affected mostly around the T.C.G inversion site. The perturbations extend to at least two adjacent base triplets on either side. The binding of the third purine strand and the accommodation of a central T.C.G inversion in RRY6 does not require a readjustment in sugar pucker, which remains in the range of C2'-endo. 31P resonances of RRY6 distribute over a range of 2.2 ppm. The H-P coupling patterns of the third strand differ from those of the duplex. General spectral patterns defined by the marker protons of the RRY and YRY triplexes are compared.\n\nRegio- and Enantioselective N-Allylations of Imidazole, Benzimidazole, and Purine Heterocycles Catalyzed by Single-Component Metallacyclic Iridium Complexes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStanley, Levi M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nHighly regio- and enantioselective iridium-catalyzed N-allylations of benzimidazoles, imidazoles, and purines have been developed. N-Allylated benzimidazoles and imidazoles were isolated in high yields (up to 97%) with high branched-to-linear selectivity (up to 99:1) and enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee) from the reactions of benzimidazole and imidazole nucleophiles with unsymmetrical allylic carbonates in the presence of single component, ethylene-bound, metallacyclic iridium catalysts. N-Allylated purines were also obtained in high yields (up to 91%) with high N9:N7 selectivity (up to 96:4), high branched-to-linear selectivity (98:2), and high enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee) under similar conditions. The reactions encompass a range of benzimidazole, imidazole, and purine nucleophiles, as well as a variety of unsymmetrical aryl, heteroaryl, and aliphatic allylic carbonates. Competition experiments between common amine nucleophiles and the heterocyclic nitrogen nucleophiles studied in this work illustrate the effect of nucleophile pKa on the rate of iridium-catalyzed N-allylation reactions. Kinetic studies on the allylation of benzimidazole catalyzed by metallacyclic iridium-phosphoramidite complexes, in combination with studies on the deactivation of these catalysts in the presence of heterocyclic nucleophiles, provide insight into the effects of the structure of the phosphoramidite ligands on the stability of the metallacyclic catalysts. The data obtained from these studies has led to the development of N-allylations of benzimidazoles and imidazoles in the absence of an exogenous base. PMID:19480431\n\nAltered erythrocyte nucleotide patterns are characteristic of inherited disorders of purine or pyrimidine metabolism.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimmonds, H A; Fairbanks, L D; Morris, G S; Webster, D R; Harley, E H\n\n1988-02-15\n\nThis paper compares erythrocyte nucleotide levels in patients with eight different inherited purine or pyrimidine enzyme defects identified amongst a variety of patients referred predominantly for investigation of severe neurological abnormalities, or immunodeficiency syndromes. Characteristic nucleotide patterns were identified only in the six disorders (four involving purine and two pyrimidine metabolism) where there was clinical evidence of cellular toxicity. They were frequently related to the accumulation of abnormal metabolites in body fluids. These erythrocyte studies have demonstrated the following. 1. ATP depletion is not an invariable feature of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, but the accumulation of the deoxyribonucleotides dATP, or dGTP, is diagnostic of ADA, or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, respectively. The early accumulation of dATP in foetal blood is a valuable aid to prenatal diagnosis of ADA deficiency. 2. GTP depletion appears to reflect the degree of CNS involvement in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and PNP deficiency, as well as PP-ribose-P synthetase superactivity. Other diagnostic changes involving increased pyrimidine sugars and increased or decreased NAD levels, or ZTP in Lesch Nyhan erythrocytes, show no consistent correlation with the clinical manifestations. 3. These altered nucleotide levels afford a novel means for carrier detection of the X-linked defect associated with aberrant PP-ribose-P synthetase activity, where no other test is yet available. Measurement of erythrocyte nucleotide levels thus provides a simple and rapid aid to diagnosis and may sometimes be essential for determining prognosis, carrier detection, or monitoring therapy. These characteristic 'fingerprints' may give some insight into the mechanism by which the abnormal gene product produces disease. Such grossly altered nucleotide levels could also result in loss of erythrocyte flexibility, increased destruction and hence the\n\nAsymmetric purine-pyrimidine distribution in cellular small RNA population of papaya\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground The small RNAs (sRNA) are a regulatory class of RNA mainly represented by the 21 and 24-nucleotide size classes. The cellular sRNAs are processed by RNase III family enzyme dicer (Dicer like in plant) from a self-complementary hairpin loop or other type of RNA duplexes. The papaya genome has been sequenced, but its microRNAs and other regulatory RNAs are yet to be analyzed. Results We analyzed the genomic features of the papaya sRNA population from three sRNA deep sequencing libraries made from leaves, flowers, and leaves infected with Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV). We also used the deep sequencing data to annotate the micro RNA (miRNA) in papaya. We identified 60 miRNAs, 24 of which were conserved in other species, and 36 of which were novel miRNAs specific to papaya. In contrast to the Chargaffâs purine-pyrimidine equilibrium, cellular sRNA was significantly biased towards a purine rich population. Of the two purine bases, higher frequency of adenine was present in 23nt or longer sRNAs, while 22nt or shorter sRNAs were over represented by guanine bases. However, this bias was not observed in the annotated miRNAs in plants. The 21nt species were expressed from fewer loci but expressed at higher levels relative to the 24nt species. The highly expressed 21nt species were clustered in a few isolated locations of the genome. The PRSV infected leaves showed higher accumulation of 21 and 22nt sRNA compared to uninfected leaves. We observed higher accumulation of miRNA* of seven annotated miRNAs in virus-infected tissue, indicating the potential function of miRNA* under stressed conditions. Conclusions We have identified 60 miRNAs in papaya. Our study revealed the asymmetric purine-pyrimidine distribution in cellular sRNA population. The 21nt species of sRNAs have higher expression levels than 24nt sRNA. The miRNA* of some miRNAs shows higher accumulation in PRSV infected tissues, suggesting that these strands are not totally functionally redundant.

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential. Difficulties encountered when using existing high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods led to the development of an improved method based on prior fractionation of urine. The advantages are as follows. 1. Production of fingerprints demonstrating altered urinary excretion patterns characteristic of any one of ten different disorders, in 30 minutes. 2. Positive identification and quantification by comparison with established methods (using conventional chromatography, electrophoresis and UV spectrophotometry) in addition to specific retention times and characteristic UV absorbance ratios at two separate wavelengths (245 and 280 nm) by HPLC. 3. Direct analysis of all the purines and pyrimidines normally found in human body fluids as well as identification of abnormal compounds. 4. Short time between successive analyses while maintaining excellent resolution between compounds of interest and column longevity. 5. Improved separation of the different adenine-based compounds encountered in some disorders, plus demonstration of potential interference by dietary or drug metabolites. 6. Applicability to the monitoring of therapy involving a variety of different purine and pyrimidine analogues. Particular attention should be paid to sample preparation. Plasma profiles will confirm the diagnosis in some, but not all, of these disorders.\n\nSupercomputer analysis of purine and pyrimidine metabolism leading to DNA synthesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeinmets, F\n\n1989-06-01\n\nA model-system is established to analyze purine and pyrimidine metabolism leading to DNA synthesis. The principal aim is to explore the flow and regulation of terminal deoxynucleoside triophosphates (dNTPs) in various input and parametric conditions. A series of flow equations are established, which are subsequently converted to differential equations. These are programmed (Fortran) and analyzed on a Cray chi-MP/48 supercomputer. The pool concentrations are presented as a function of time in conditions in which various pertinent parameters of the system are modified. The system is formulated by 100 differential equations.\n\nTD-DFT investigation of the magnetic circular dichroism spectra of some purine and pyrimidine bases of nucleic acids.\n\nPubMed\n\nFahleson, Tobias; Kauczor, Joanna; Norman, Patrick; Santoro, Fabrizio; Improta, Roberto; Coriani, Sonia\n\n2015-05-28\n\nWe present a computational study of the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra in the 200-300 nm wavelength region of purine and its derivative hypoxanthine, as well as of the pyrimidine bases of nucleic acids uracil, thymine, and cytosine, using the B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP functionals. Solvent effects are investigated within the polarizable continuum model and by inclusion of explicit water molecules. In general, the computed spectra are found to be in good agreement with the experimental ones, apart from some overall blue shifts. Both the pseudo-A term shape of the MCD spectra of the purines and the B term shape of the spectra of pyrimidine bases are reproduced. Our calculations also correctly reproduce the reversed phase of the MCD bands in purine compared to that of its derivatives present in nucleic acids. Solvent effects are sizable and system specific, but they do not in general alter the qualitative shape of the spectra. The bands are dominated by the bright Ï â Ï* transitions, and our calculations in solution nicely reproduce their energy differences, improving the estimates obtained in the gas phase. Shoulders are predicted for purine and uracil due to n â Ï* excitations, but they are too weak to be observed in the experiment.\n\n[Separation of purines, pyrimidines, pterins and flavonoids on magnolol-bonded silica gel stationary phase by high performance liquid chromatography].\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Hong; Li, Laishen; Zhang, Yang; Zhou, Rendan\n\n2012-10-01\n\nA new magnolol-bonded silica gel stationary phase (MSP) was used to separate the basic drugs including four purines, eight pyrimidines, four pterins and five flavonoids as polar representative samples by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To clarify the separation mechanism, a commercial ODS column was also tested under the same chromatographic conditions. The high selectivities and fast baseline separations of the above drugs were achieved by using simple mobile phases on MSP. Although there is no end-caped treatment, the peak shapes of basic drugs containing nitrogen such as purines, pyrimidines and pterins were rather symmetrical on MSP, which indicated the the magnolol as ligand with multi-sites could shield the side effect of residual silanol groups on the surface of silica gel. Although somewhat different in the separation resolution, it was found that the elution orders of some drugs were generally similar on both MSP and ODS. The hydrophobic interaction should play a significant role in the separations of the above basic drugs, which was attributed to their reversed-phase property in the nature. However, MSP could provide the additional sites for many polar solutes, which was a rational explanation for the high selectivity of MSP. For example, in the separation of purines, pyrimidines and pterins on MSP, hydrogen-bonding and dipole-dipole interactions played leading roles besides hydrophobic interaction. Some solute molecules (such as mercaptopurine, vitexicarpin) and MSP can form the strong pi-pi stacking in the separation process. All enhanced the retention and improved the separation selectivity of MSP, which facilitated the separation of the basic drugs.\n\nOne-electron oxidation reactions of purine and pyrimidine bases in cellular DNA.\n\nPubMed\n\nCadet, Jean; Wagner, J Richard; Shafirovich, Vladimir; Geacintov, Nicholas E\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe aim of this survey is to critically review the available information on one-electron oxidation reactions of nucleobases in cellular DNA with emphasis on damage induced through the transient generation of purine and pyrimidine radical cations. Since the indirect effect of ionizing radiation mediated by hydroxyl radical is predominant in cells, efforts have been made to selectively ionize bases using suitable one-electron oxidants that consist among others of high intensity UVC laser pulses. Thus, the main oxidation product in cellular DNA was found to be 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine as a result of direct bi-photonic ionization of guanine bases and indirect formation of guanine radical cations through hole transfer reactions from other base radical cations. The formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine and other purine and pyrimidine degradation products was rationalized in terms of the initial generation of related radical cations followed by either hydration or deprotonation reactions in agreement with mechanistic pathways inferred from detailed mechanistic studies. The guanine radical cation has been shown to be implicated in three other nucleophilic additions that give rise to DNA-protein and DNA-DNA cross-links in model systems. Evidence was recently provided for the occurrence of these three reactions in cellular DNA. There is growing evidence that one-electron oxidation reactions of nucleobases whose mechanisms have been characterized in model studies involving aqueous solutions take place in a similar way in cells. It may also be pointed out that the above cross-linked lesions are only produced from the guanine radical cation and may be considered as diagnostic products of the direct effect of ionizing radiation.\n\nOne-electron oxidation reactions of purine and pyrimidine bases in cellular DNA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCadet, Jean; Wagner, J.

The PPyox/MWNTs/GCE exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards the oxidation of DNA bases due to the advantages of wide potential window, large effective surface area, and excellent antifouling property. As a result, all purine and pyrimidine bases of guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) exhibited well identified oxidation peaks at the PPyox/MWNTs/GCE. The direct potential resolution between 5-mC and C was obtained to be 180 mV, which was large enough for their signal recognition and accurate detection in mixture. In particular, the signal interference from T, a great challenge in exploring DNA methylation, was successfully eliminated by an innovative strategy, which was developed based on the stoichiometric relationship between purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA molecular structure. The proposed method was effectively applied to the rapid detection of DNA methylation status in real sample within 45 min with satisfactory results. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

H.; Lawless, J. G.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nDilute (0.1 M) solutions of HCN condense to oligomers at pH 9.2, and hydrolysis of these oligomers yields 4,5-dihydroxypyrimidine, orotic acid, 5-hydroxyuracil, adenine, 4-aminoimidazole-5-carboxamide, and amino acids. It is suggested that the three main classes of nitrogen-containing biomolecules - purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids may have originated from HCN on the primitive earth. It is also suggested that the presence of orotic acid and 4-aminoimidazole-5-carboxamide might indicate that contemporary biosynthetic pathways for nucleotides evolved from the compounds released on hydrolysis of HCN oligomers.\n\nConsortium analysis of gene and gene-folate interactions in purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways with ovarian carcinoma risk\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKelemen, Linda E.; Terry, Kathryn L.; Goodman, Marc T.; Webb, Penelope M.; Bandera, Elisa V.; McGuire, Valerie; Rossing, Mary Anne; Wang, Qinggang; Dicks, Ed; Tyrer, Jonathan P.; Song, Honglin; Kupryjanczyk, Jolanta; Dansonka-Mieszkowska, Agnieszka; Plisiecka-Halasa, Joanna; Timorek, Agnieszka; Menon, Usha; Gentry-Maharaj, Aleksandra; Gayther, Simon A.; Ramus, Susan J.; Narod, Steven A.; Risch, Harvey A.; McLaughlin, John R.; Siddiqui, Nadeem; Glasspool, Rosalind; Paul, James; Carty, Karen; Gronwald, Jacek; LubiÅski, Jan; Jakubowska, Anna; Cybulski, Cezary; Kiemeney, Lambertus A.; Massuger, Leon F.

Methods and Results Odds ratios (OR) for 446 genetic variants were estimated among 13,410 OC cases and 22,635 controls and among 2,281 cases and 3,444 controls with folate information. Following multiple testing correction, the most significant main effect associations were for DPYD variants rs11587873 (OR=0.92, P=6x10â5) and rs828054 (OR=1.06, P=1x10â4). Thirteen variants in the pyrimidine metabolism genes, DPYD, DPYS, PPAT and TYMS, also interacted significantly with folate in a multi-variant analysis (corrected P=9.9x10â6) but collectively explained only 0.2% of OC risk. Although no other associations were significant after multiple testing correction, variants in SHMT1 in one-carbon transfer, previously reported with OC, suggested lower risk at higher folate (Pinteraction=0.03-0.006). Conclusions Variation in pyrimidine metabolism genes, particularly DPYD, which was previously reported to be associated with OC, may influence risk; however, stratification by folate intake is unlikely to modify disease risk appreciably in these women. SHMT1 SNP-byfolate interactions are plausible but require further validation. Polymorphisms in selected genes in purine metabolism were not associated with OC.

As dimerization of NOS is required for its activity, several dimerization inhibitors, including pyrimidine imidazoles, are being evaluated for therapeutic inhibition of iNOS. However, the precise mechanism of their action is still unclear. Here, we examined the mechanism of iNOS inhibition by a pyrimidine imidazole core compound and its derivative (PID), having low cellular toxicity and high affinity for iNOS, using rapid stopped-flow kinetic, gel filtration, and spectrophotometric analysis. PID bound to iNOS heme to generate an irreversible PID-iNOS monomer complex that could not be converted to active dimers by tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) and l-arginine (Arg). We utilized the iNOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy) and two monomeric mutants whose dimerization could be induced (K82AiNOSoxy) or not induced (D92AiNOSoxy) with H4B to elucidate the kinetics of PID binding to the iNOS monomer and dimer. We observed that the apparent PID affinity for the monomer was 11 times higher than the dimer. PID binding rate was also sensitive to H4B and Arg site occupancy. PID could also interact with nascent iNOS monomers in iNOS-synthesizing RAW cells, to prevent their post-translational dimerization, and it also caused irreversible monomerization of active iNOS dimers thereby accomplishing complete physiological inhibition of iNOS. Thus, our study establishes PID as a versatile iNOS inhibitor and therefore a potential in vivo tool for examining the causal role of iNOS in diseases associated with its overexpression as well as therapeutic control of such diseases.

The guanido carbon of arginine also contributes, to some extent, to the carbon dioxide pool utilized for purine biosynthesis. The enzyme of the first reaction leading from arginine to pyrimidines, arginine deiminase, was investigated in crude bacterial extracts. It was inhibited by thymidylic acid and purine ribonucleotides, and to a lesser extent by purine deoxynucleotides and deoxycytidylic acid. Under the assay conditions employed, a number of nucleotides had no effect on the enzyme activity of the aspartate transcarbamylase of L. leichmannii. Growth of the cells in media containing uracil, compared to growth in media without uracil, resulted in a four- to fivefold decrease in the concentrations of aspartate transcar-bamylase and dihydroorotase and a twofold increase in the concentration of arginine deiminase, as estimated from specific enzyme activity in crude extracts of the cells. A small increase in specific enzyme activity of ornithine transcarbamylase and carbamate kinase was also observed in extracts obtained from cells grown on uracil. No appreciable change in concentration of any of the five enzymes studied was detected when the cells were grown in media containing thymidine or guanylic acid. A hypothetical scheme which suggests a relationship between the control of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis in this bacterium and which is consistent with the experimental results obtained is presented.

The effects of the pyrimidines, uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP), thymidine 5'-triphosphate (TTP) and cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP), were examined in the guinea-pig coronary bed, by use of a Langendorff technique. Comparisons were made with the actions of the purines adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), inosine 5'-triphosphate (ITP) and guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP). The effect of, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and, the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin on the vasodilator response to these purines and pyrimidines was examined. The effects of these inhibitors were assessed on their ability to inhibit both the amplitude and the area of the vasodilator response. 2. The relative order of potency of the purines and pyrimidines studied was ATP > UTP > ITP >> GTP, TTP, CTP. 3.

Amino acids, which are the monomers of proteins, have been extensively studied in such meteorites (e.g. Botta and Bada 2002; Pizzarello et aI., 2006). The origin of amino acids in meteorites has been firmly established as extraterrestrial based on their detection typically as racemic mixtures of amino acids, the presence of many non-protein amino acids, and non-terrestrial values for compound-specific deuterium, carbon, and nitrogen isotopic measurements. In contrast to amino acids, nucleobases in meteorites have been far less studied. Nucleobases are substituted one-ring (pyrimidine) or two-ring (purine) nitrogen heterocyclic compounds and serve as the information carriers of nucleic acids and in numerous coenzymes. All of the purines (adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine) and pyrimidines (uracil) previously reported in meteorites are biologically common and could be interpreted as the result of terrestrial contamination (e.g. van del' Velden and Schwartz, 1974.) Unlike other meteoritic organics, there have been no observations of stochastic molecular diversity of purines and pyrimidines in meteorites, which has been a criterion for establishing extraterrestrial origin. Maltins et al. (2008) performed compound-specific stable carbon isotope measurements for uracil and xanthine in the Murchison meteorite. They assigned a non-terrestrial origin for these nucleobases; however, the possibility that interfering indigenous molecules (e.g. carboxylic acids) contributed to the 13C-enriched isotope values for these nucleobases cannot be completely ruled out. Thus, the origin of these meteoritic nucleobases has never been established unequivocally. Here we report on our investigation of extracts of II different carbonaceous chondrites covering various petrographic types (Cl, CM, and CR) and degrees of aqueous alteration\n\nNon-random distribution and co-localization of purine/pyrimidine-encoded information and transcriptional regulatory domains.\n\nPubMed\n\nPovinelli, C M\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn order to detect sequence-based information predictive for the location of eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory domains, the frequencies and distributions of the 36 possible purine/pyrimidine reverse complement hexamer pairs was determined for test sets of real and random sequences. The distribution of one of the hexamer pairs (RRYYRR/YYRRYY, referred to as M1) was further examined in a larger set of sequences (> 32 genes, 230 kb). Predominant clusters of M1 and the locations of eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory domains were found to be associated and non-randomly distributed along the DNA consistent with a periodicity of approximately 1.2 kb. In the context of higher ordered chromatin this would align promoters, enhancers and the predominant clusters of M1 longitudinally along one face of a 30 nm fiber. Using only information about the distribution of the M1 motif, 50-70% of a sequence could be eliminated as being unlikely to contain transcriptional regulatory domains with an 87% recovery of the regulatory domains present.\n\nSynthesis of Purine Nucleoside and Nucleotide Analogs as Antiparasitic Agents.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1979-09-01\n\nwas to conduct studies on the synthesis of purine nucleoside and nucleotide analogs as anti- parasitic agents.

In this study, we attempted to determine suitable anti-cancer drugs to be combined with bendamustine for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, aggressive lymphomas and multiple myeloma, all of which are relatively resistant to this drug, and investigated the mechanisms underlying synergism. Isobologram analysis revealed that bendamustine had synergistic effects with alkylating agents (4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and melphalan) and pyrimidine analogues (cytosine arabinoside, gemcitabine and decitabine) in HBL-2, B104, Namalwa and U266 cell lines, which represent the above entities respectively. In cell cycle analysis, bendamustine induced late S-phase arrest, which was enhanced by 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, and potentiated early S-phase arrest by cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), followed by a robust increase in the size of sub-G1 fractions. Bendamustine was able to elicit DNA damage response and subsequent apoptosis faster and with shorter exposure than other alkylating agents due to rapid intracellular incorporation via equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). Furthermore, bendamustine increased the expression of ENT1 at both mRNA and protein levels and enhanced the uptake of Ara-C and subsequent increase in Ara-C triphosphate (Ara-CTP) in HBL-2 cells to an extent comparable with the purine analog fludarabine. These purine analog-like properties of bendamustine may underlie favorable combinations with other alkylators and pyrimidine analogues. Our findings may provide a theoretical basis for the development of more effective bendamustine-based combination therapies.

A potentiometric method was applied to determine the composition and stability constants of complexes formed, while the mode of interactions was analysed by spectral methods (ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), (13)C NMR, (31)P NMR). In metal-free systems, molecular complexes nucleotide-polyamine (NMP)H(x)(OSpm) were formed. The endocyclic nitrogen atoms of the purine ring N(1), N(7), the nitrogen atom of the pyrimidine ring N(3), the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group of the nucleotide and the protonated nitrogen atoms of the polyamine were the reaction centres. The mode of interaction of the metal ion with OSpm and the nucleotides (AMP or CMP) in the coordination compounds was established. In the system Cu(II)/OSpm the dinuclear complex Cu(2)(OSpm) forms, while in the ternary systems Cu(II)/nucleotide/OSpm the species type MH(x)LL' and MLL' appear. In the MH(x)LL' type species, the main centres of copper (II) ion binding in the nucleotide are the phosphate groups. The protonated amino groups of OSpm are involved in non-covalent interaction with the nitrogen atoms N(1), N(7) or N(3) of the purine or pyrimidine ring, whereas at higher pH, deprotonated nitrogen atoms of polyamine are engaged in metallation in MLL' species.\n\nPartition coefficients of some purine derivatives and its application to pharmacokinetics.\n\nPubMed\n\nChrzanowska, M; Sobiak, J; Kuehn, M; Dorawa, E; Hermann, T\n\n2009-12-01\n\nMetazathioprine (MAZA), a methylated derivative of azathioprine (AZA), demonstrated the greatest values of apparent and specific partition coefficients in n-octanol/phosphate buffer at pH 5.7 and pH 7.4 among purine derivatives such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and AZA. Introduction of a methyl group into the imidazole ring of AZA increases lipophilic properties of MAZA compared to AZA.

Relative to the controls (no radiation or no catalysis), a variegate panel of compounds was observed, including purine and pyrimidine nucleobases (uracil, cytosine, adenine, and guanine), nucleobase analogues, heterocycles, and carboxylic acids involved in metabolic pathways. The presence of amino imidazole carbonitrile (AICN), 4,6-diamino purine (4,6-DAP) and 2,4-diamino pyrimidine (2,4-DAPy) among the observed products suggests the occurrence of an unified mechanism based on the generation of radical cyanide species (â¢CN).

Threose nucleic acid (TNA) and other polyelectrolytes are also considered as the possible first Darwinian biopolymer(s). This model is being developed by research pursuing a \"Discontinuous Synthesis Model\" (DSM) for the formation of RNA and/or TNA from precursor molecules that might have been available on early Earth from prebiotic reactions, with the goal of making the model less discontinuous. In general, this is done by examining the reactivity of isolated products from proposed steps that generate those products, with increasing complexity of the reaction mixtures in the proposed mineralogical environments. Here, we report that adenine, diaminopurine, and hypoxanthine nucleoside phosphates and a noncanonical pyrimidine nucleoside (zebularine) phosphate can be formed from the direct coupling reaction of cyclic carbohydrate phosphates with the free nucleobases. The reaction is stereoselective, giving only the Î²-anomer of the nucleotides within detectable limits. For purines, the coupling is also regioselective, giving the N -9 nucleotide for adenine as a major product. In the DSM, phosphorylated carbohydrates are presumed to have been available via reactions explored previously [Krishnamurthy R, Guntha S, Eschenmoser A (2000) Angew Chem Int Ed 39:2281-2285], while nucleobases are presumed to have been available from hydrogen cyanide and other nitrogenous species formed in Earth's primitive atmosphere.

Glassy carbon electrode modified with silicon carbide nanoparticles (SiCNP/GC), have been used for electrocatalytic oxidation of purine (guanine and adenine) and pyrimidine bases (thymine and cytosine) nucleotides. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were used to examine the structure of the SiCNP/GC modified electrode. The modified electrode shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was proposed for simultaneous determination of four DNA bases. The effects of different parameters such as the thickness of SiC layer, pulse amplitude, scan rate, supporting electrolyte composition and pH were optimized to obtain the best peak potential separation and higher sensitivity. Detection limit, sensitivity and linear concentration range of the modified electrode toward proposed analytes were calculated for, guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine, respectively. As shown this sensor can be used for nanomolar or micromolar detection of different DNA bases simultaneously or individually. This sensor also exhibits good stability, reproducibility and long lifetime. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The biotransformation of (S)-25 was investigated in vitro and in vivo in rat, rabbit, and human and compared with AZD3839 to further understand the metabolic fate of these compounds. In vitro, CYP3A4 was the major responsible enzyme and metabolized both compounds to a large extent in the commonly shared pyridine and pyrimidine rings. The main proposed metabolic pathways in various in vitro systems were N-oxidation of the pyridine and/or pyrimidine ring and conversion to 4-pyrimidone and pyrimidine-2,4-dione. Both compounds were extensively metabolized, and more than 90% was excreted in feces after intravenous administration of radiolabeled compound to the rat. Here, the main pathways were N-oxidation of the pyridine and/or pyrimidine ring and a ring contraction of the pyrimidine ring into an imidazole ring. Ring-contracted metabolites accounted for 25% of the total metabolism in the rat for (S)-25, whereas the contribution was much smaller for AZD3839. This metabolic pathway was not foreseen on the basis of the obtained in vitro data. In conclusion, we discovered an unusual metabolic pathway of aryl-pyrimidine-containing compounds by a ring-opening reaction followed by elimination of a carbon atom and a ring closure to form an imidazole ring.\n\nChemical evolution. XXIX - Pyrimidines from hydrogen cyanide\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFerris, J. P.; Joshi, P. C.; Lawless, J. G.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nCompounds obtained by hydrolysis of HCN oligomers formed by allowing pH 9.2, 0.1 M cyanide to stand at room temperature for 4 to 12 months were analyzed. Hydrolysis of HCN oligomers yielded 4,5-dihydroxypyrimidine and 5-hydroxyuracil; orotic acid was detected after hydrolysis at pH 8.5. A unified pathway from diaminofumaronitrile to the pyrimidines observed is suggested. As purines, pyrimidines and amino acids are released by hydrolysis of HCN oligomers in either acidic or mildly basic aqueous solutions, they could have been formed on the primitive earth in spite of fluctuations in pH. 4,5-dihydroxypyrimidines appear to be likely candidates for incorporation into primitive nucleic acids, as they should undergo Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding with adenine.\n\nInhibition of herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase by purine ribonucleoside monophosphates.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrank, K B; Cheng, Y C\n\n1986-02-05\n\nPurine ribonucleoside monophosphates were found to inhibit chain elongation catalyzed by herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA polymerase when DNA template-primer concentrations were rate-limiting. Inhibition was fully competitive with DNA template-primer during chain elongation; however, DNA polymerase-associated exonuclease activity was inhibited noncompetitively with respect to DNA. Combinations of 5'-GMP and phosphonoformate were kinetically mutually exclusive in dual inhibitor studies. Pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates and deoxynucleoside monophosphates were less inhibitory than purine riboside monophosphates. The monophosphates of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, Virazole (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide), 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine exerted little or no inhibition. In contrast to HSV DNA polymerase, human DNA polymerase alpha was not inhibited by purine ribonucleoside monophosphates. These studies suggest the possibility of a physiological role of purine ribonucleoside monophosphates as regulators of herpesvirus DNA synthesis and a new approach to developing selective anti-herpesvirus compounds.\n\nPurine Restriction Induces Pronounced Translational Upregulation of the NT1 Adenosine/Pyrimidine Nucleoside Transporter in Leishmania major\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOrtiz, Diana; ValdÃ©s, Raquel; Sanchez, Marco A.; Hayenga, Johanna; Elya, Carolyn; Detke, Siegfried; Landfear, Scott M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSummary Leishmania and other parasitic protozoa are unable to synthesize purines de novo and are reliant upon purine nucleoside and nucleobase transporters to import preformed purines from their hosts. To study the roles of the four purine permeases NT1-NT4 in Leishmania major, null mutants in each transporter gene were prepared and the effect of each gene deletion on purine uptake was monitored. Deletion of the NT3 purine nucleobase transporter gene or both NT3 and the NT2 nucleoside transporter gene resulted in pronounced upregulation of adenosine and uridine uptake mediated by the NT1 permease and also induced up to a 200-fold enhancement in the level of the NT1 protein but not mRNA. A similar level of upregulation of NT1 was achieved in wild type promastigotes that were transferred to medium deficient in purines. Pulse labeling and treatment of cells with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide revealed that control of NT1 expression occurs primarily at the level of translation and not protein turnover. These observations imply the existence of a translational control mechanism that enhances the ability of Leishmania parasites to import essential purines when they are present at limiting concentrations.

The template, divinyl sulfone structure (DVS), which was grafted on poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol) (PEVA) hollow fiber membrane, has served for the tethering of different heterocyclic compounds as pyridine, imidazole, purine and pyrimidine rings. Their ability to adsorb specifically IgG in a salt independent manner out of pure IgG solution, mixture of IgG/albumin and human plasma was demonstrated. Mercapto methyl imidazole (MMI) has shown the best adsorption of IgG in terms of binding capacity. No subclass discrimination was observed on all tested ligands except for mercapto methyl pyrimidine where the major IgG subclass adsorbed was IgG3. MMI gave an IgG binding capacity of 100 microg/cm2 of hollow fiber membrane surface area.\n\nDiscovery of 2-((1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones as novel PKM2 activators.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Chuangxing; Linton, Angelica; Jalaie, Mehran; Kephart, Susan; Ornelas, Martha; Pairish, Mason; Greasley, Samantha; Richardson, Paul; Maegley, Karen; Hickey, Michael; Li, John; Wu, Xin; Ji, Xiaodong; Xie, Zhi\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase is an emerging target for antitumor therapy. In this letter, we describe the discovery of 2-((1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones as potent and selective PKM2 activators which were found to have a novel binding mode. The original lead identified from high throughput screening was optimized into an efficient series via computer-aided structure-based drug design. Both a representative compound from this series and an activator described in the literature were used as molecular tools to probe the biological effects of PKM2 activation on cancer cells. Our results suggested that PKM2 activation alone is not sufficient to alter cancer cell metabolism. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A.; Materese, C. K.; Nuevo, M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nN-heterocycles have been identified in meteorites and their extraterrestrial origins are suggested by isotopic ratio measurements. Although small N- heterocycles have not been detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), recent experiments in our lab have shown that the irradiation of the aromatic molecules like benzene (C6H6) and naphthalene (C10H8) in mixed molecular ices leads to the formation of O- and N-heterocyclic molecules. Among the class of N-heterocycles are the nucleobases, which are of astrobiological interest because they are the information bearing units of DNA and RNA. Nucleobases have been detected in meteorites [3-5], with isotopic signatures that are also consistent with an extraterrestrial origin. Three of the biologically relevant nucleobases (uracil, cytosine, and guanine) have a pyrimidine core structure while the remaining two (adenine and guanine) possess a purine core. Previous experiments in our lab have demonstrated that all of the bio-logical nucleobases (and numerous other molecules) with a pyrimidine core structure can be produced by irradiating pyrimidine in mixed molecular ices of several compositions [6-8]. In this work, we study the formation of purine-based molecules, including the nucleobases adenine, and guanine, from the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of purine in ices consisting mixtures of H2O and NH3 at low temperature. The experiments are designed to simulate the astrophysical conditions under which these species may be formed in dense molecular clouds, protoplanetary disks, or on the surfaces of icy bodies in planetary systems.\n\nThe high stability of the triple helices formed between short purine oligonucleotides and SIV/HIV-2 vpx genes is determined by the targeted DNA structure.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSvinarchuk, F; Monnot, M; Merle, A; Malvy, C; Fermandjian, S\n\n1995-01-01\n\nIn our previous works we have shown that the oligonucleotides 5'-GGGGAGGGGGAGG-3' and 5'-GGAGGGGGAGGGG-3' give very stable and specific triplexes with their target double stranded DNAs [Svinarchuk, F., Bertrand, J.-R. and Malvy, C. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 3742-3747; Svinarchuk, F., Paoletti, J. and Malvy, C. (1995) J. Biol. Chem., 270, 14 068-14,071]. The target for the invariable part of these oligonucleotides, 5'-GGAGGGGGAGG-3', is found in a highly conserved 20 bp long purine/pyrimidine tract of the vpx gene of the SIV and HIV-2 viruses and could be a target for oligonucleotide directed antivirus therapy. Here were report on the ability of four purine oligonucleotides with different lengths (11-, 14-, 17- and 20-mer) to form triplexes with the purine/pyrimidine stretch of the vpx gene. Triplex formation was tested by joint dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprint, gel-retardation assay, circular dichroism (CD) and UV-melting studies. Dimethyl sulfate footprint studies revealed the antiparallel orientation of the third strand to the purine strand of the Watson-Crick duplex. However, the protection of the guanines at the ends of the target sequence decreased as the length of the third strand oligonucleotide increased. Melting temperature studies provided profiles with only one transition for all of the triplexes. The melting temperatures of the triplexes were found to be the same as for the targeted duplex in the case of the 11- and 14-mer third strands while for the 17- and 20-mer third strands the melting temperature of the triplexes were correspondingly 4 and 8 degrees C higher than for the duplex. Heating and cooling melting curves were reversible for all of the tested triplexes except one with the 20-mer third strand oligonucleotide. Circular dichroism spectra showed the ability of the target DNA to adopt an A-like DNA conformation. Upon triplex formation the A-DNA form becomes even more pronounced. This effect depends on the length of the third strand\n\nChiral symmetry breaking during the self-assembly of monolayers from achiral purine molecules.\n\nPubMed\n\nSowerby, S J; Heckl, W M; Petersen, G B\n\n1996-11-01\n\nScanning tunneling microscopy was used to investigate the structure of the two-dimensional adsorbate formed by molecular self-assembly of the purine base, adenine, on the surfaces of the naturally occurring mineral molybdenite and the synthetic crystal highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Although formed from adenine, which is achiral, the observed adsorbate surface structures were enantiomorphic on molybdenite. This phenomenon suggests a mechanism for the introduction of a localized chiral symmetry break by the spontaneous crystallization of these prebiotically available molecules on inorganic surfaces and may have some role in the origin of biomolecular optical asymmetry. The possibility that purine-pyrimidine arrays assembled on naturally occurring mineral surfaces might act as possible templates for biomolecular assembly is discussed.\n\nNucleobases and Other Prebiotic Species from the UV Irradiation of Pyrimidine in Astrophysical Ices\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSandford, Scott; Materese, Christopher; Nuevo, Michel\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNucleobases are aromatic N-heterocycles that constitute the informational subunits of DNA and RNA and are divided into two families: pyrimidine bases (uracil, cytosine, and thymine) and purine bases (adenine and guanine). Nucleobases have been detected in meteorites and their extraterrestrial origin confirmed by isotope measurement. Although no N-heterocycles have been individually identified in the ISM, the 6.2-micron interstellar emission feature seen towards many astronomical objects suggests a population of such molecules is likely present. We report on a study of the formation of pyrimidine-based molecules, including nucleobases and other species of prebiotic interest, from the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of pyrimidine in low temperature ices containing H2O, NH3, C3OH, and CH4, to simulate the astrophysical conditions under which prebiotic species may be formed in the Solar System.\n\nDistinct Distribution of Purines in CM and CR Carbonaceous Chondrites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCallahan, Michael P.; Stern, Jennifer C.; Glavin, Daniel P.; Smith, Karen E.; Martin, Mildred G.; Dworkin, Jason P.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCarbonaceous meteorites contain a diverse suite of organic molecules and delivered pre biotic organic compounds, including purines and pyrimidines, to the early Earth (and other planetary bodies), seeding it with the ingredients likely required for the first genetic material. We have investigated the distribution of nucleobases in six different CM and CR type carbonaceous chondrites, including fivc Antarctic meteorites never before analyzed for nucleobases. We employed a traditional formic acid extraction protocol and a recently developed solid phase extraction method to isolate nucleobases. We analyzed these extracts by high performance liquid chromatography with UV absorbance detection and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-UV -MS/MS) targeting the five canonical RNAIDNA bases and hypoxanthine and xanthine. We detected parts-per-billion levels of nucleobases in both CM and CR meteorites. The relative abundances of the purines found in Antarctic CM and CR meteorites were clearly distinct from each other suggesting that these compounds are not terrestrial contaminants. One likely source of these purines is formation by HCN oligomerization (with other small molecules) during aqueous alteration inside the meteorite parent body. The detection of the purines adenine (A), guanine (0), hypoxanthine (HX), and xanthine (X) in carbonaceous meteorites indicates that these compounds should have been available on the early Earth prior to the origin of the first genetic material.\n\nSubstrate specificity of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases of NP-II family probed by X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBalaev, V. V.; Lashkov, A. A.; Prokofev, I. I.; Gabdulkhakov, A. G.; Seregina, T. A.; Mironov, A. S.; Betzel, C.; Mikhailov, A. M.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nPyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases, which are widely used in the biotechnological production of nucleosides, have different substrate specificity for pyrimidine nucleosides. An interesting feature of these enzymes is that the three-dimensional structure of thymidine-specific nucleoside phosphorylase is similar to the structure of nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase. The three-dimensional structures of thymidine phosphorylase from Salmonella typhimurium and nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Bacillus subtilis in complexes with a sulfate anion were determined for the first time by X-ray crystallography. An analysis of the structural differences between these enzymes demonstrated that Lys108, which is involved in the phosphate binding in pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase, corresponds to Met111 in thymidine phosphorylases. This difference results in a decrease in the charge on one of the hydroxyl oxygens of the phosphate anion in thymidine phosphorylase and facilitates the catalysis through SN2 nucleophilic substitution. Based on the results of X-ray crystallography, the virtual screening was performed for identifying a potent inhibitor (anticancer agent) of nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase, which does not bind to thymidine phosphorylase. The molecular dynamics simulation revealed the stable binding of the discovered compoundâ2-pyrimidin-2-yl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylic acidâto the active site of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase.\n\nThree-dimensional structure of E.

They are essential for normal cell function and can catalyze the transglycosylation. Crystals of E. coli PNP were grown in microgravity by the capillary counterdiffusion method through a gel layer. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined by the molecular-replacement method at 0.99 Ã resolution. The structural features are considered, and the structure of E. coli PNP is compared with the structures of the free enzyme and its complexes with purine base derivatives established earlier. A comparison of the environment ofmoreÂ Â» the purine base in the complex of PNP with formycin A and of the pyrimidine base in the complex of uridine phosphorylase with thymidine revealed the main structural features of the base-binding sites. Coordinates of the atomic model determined with high accuracy were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB-ID: 4RJ2).Â«Â less\n\nScaffold hopping identifies 6,8-disubstituted purines as novel anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchlÃ¼tke, Laura; Immer, Markus; Preu, Lutz; Totzke, Frank; SchÃ¤chtele, Christoph; Kubbutat, Michael H G; Kunick, Conrad\n\n2018-05-01\n\nRearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are associated with several cancer diseases. Due to resistance development against existing ALK-inhibitors, new, structurally unrelated inhibitors are required. By a scaffold hopping strategy, 6,8-disubstituted purines were designed as analogues of similar ALK-inhibiting thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines. While the new title compounds indeed inhibited ALK and several ALK mutants in submicromolar concentrations, they retained poor water solubility. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The identity of the active metabolite was postulated to be purine-6-sulfenic acid. In the present report, we describe the synthesis of the sulfenic acid derivatives of 6-thiopurine and two structurally similar compounds, 9-methyl-6-thiopurine and 4-mercapto-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine. The unusual pH-dependent stability profiles of these compounds in buffered aqueous media are presented and explained on the basis of a disproportionation mechanism of sulfenic acid decomposition. Studies with radiolabeled purine-6-sulfenic acid demonstrate that this species binds directly to hepatic microsomal protein. These results support the proposed involvement of purine-6-sulfenic acid in the metabolic activation and tissue binding of 6-thiopurine.\n\nThe Photochemistry of Pyrimidine in Pure H2O Ice Subjected to Different Radiation Environments and the Formation of Uracil\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNuevo, M.; Chen, Y.-J.; Materese.

They include pyrimidine bases (uracil, cytosine, and thymine) and purine bases (adenine and guanine). Nucleobases have been detected in several meteorites, although no Nheterocycles have been observed in space to data. Laboratory experiments showed that the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of pyrimidine in pure H2O ice at low temperature (<=20 K) leads to the formation of pyrimidine derivatives including the nucleobase uracil and its precursor 4(3H)-pyrimidone. These results were confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. When pyrimidine is mixed with combinations of H2O, NH3, CH3OH, and CH4 ices under similar conditions, uracil and cytosine are formed. In the present work we study the formation of 4(3H)-pyrimidone and uracil from the irradiation of pyrimidine in H2O ice with high-energy UV photons (Lyman , He I, and He II lines) provided by a synchrotron source. The photo-destruction of pyrimidine in these H2O ices as well as the formation yields for 4(3H)-pyrimidone and uracil are compared with our previous results in order to study the photo-stability of pyrimidine and the production efficiency of uracil as a function of the photon energy.\n\nPhotochemistry of Pyrimidine in Astrophysical Ices: Formation of Nucleobases and Other Prebiotic Species\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNuevo, Michel; Sandford, Scott A.; Materese, Christopher K.; Milam, Stefanie N.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNucleobases are N-heterocycles that are the informational subunits of DNA and RNA. They are divided into two molecular groups: pyrimidine bases (uracil, cytosine, and thymine) and purine bases (adenine and guanine). Nucleobases have been detected in meteorites, and their extraterrestrial origin confirmed by isotopic measurements. Although no N-heterocycles have ever been observed in the ISM, the positions of the 6.2- m interstellar emission features suggest a population of such molecules is likely to be present. However, laboratory experiments have shown that the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of pyrimidine in ices of astrophysical relevance such as H2O, NH3, CH3OH, CH4, CO, or combinations of these at low temperature (less than or equal to 20 K) leads to the formation of several pyrimidine derivatives including the nucleobases uracil and cytosine, as well as precursors such as 4(3H)-pyrimidone and 4-aminopyrimidine. Quantum calculations on the formation of 4(3H)-pyrimidone and uracil from the irradiation of pyrimidine in pure H2O ices are in agreement with their experimental formation pathways.10 In those residues, other species of prebiotic interest such as urea as well as the amino acids glycine and alanine could also be identified. However, only very small amounts of pyrimidine derivatives containing CH3 groups could be detected, suggesting that the addition of methyl groups to pyrimidine is not an efficient process. For this reason, the nucleobase thymine was not observed in any of the samples. In this work, we study the formation of nucleobases and other photo-products of prebiotic interest from the UV irradiation of pyrimidine in ices containing H2O, NH3, CH3OH, and CO, mixed in astrophysical proportions.\n\nFormation of Nucleobases from the UV Irradiation of Pyrimidine in Astrophysical Ice Analogs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSandford, Scott A.; Nuevo, Michel; Materese, Christopher K.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nNucleobases are the informational subunits of DNA and RNA. They consist of Nheterocycles that belong to either the pyrimidine-base group (uracil, cytosine, and thymine) or the purinebase group (adenine and guanine). Several nucleobases, mostly purine bases, have been detected in meteorites [1-3], with isotopic signatures consistent with an extraterrestrial origin [4]. Uracil is the only pyrimidine-base compound formally reported in meteorites [2], though the presence of cytosine cannot be ruled out [5,6]. However, the actual process by which the uracil was made and the reasons for the non-detection of thymine in meteorites have yet to be fully explained. Although no N-heterocycles have ever been observed in the ISM [7,8], the positions of the 6.2-Âµm interstellar emission features suggest a population of such molecules is likely to be present [9]. In this work we study the formation of pyrimidine-based molecules, including the three nucleobases uracil, cytosine, and thymine from the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of pyrimidine in ices consisting of several combinations of H(sub2)O, NH(sub3), CH(sub3)OH, and CH(sub4) at low temperature, in order to simulate the astrophysical conditions under which prebiotic species may be formed in the interstellar medium, in the protosolar nebula, and on icy bodies of the Solar System.\n\nUltraviolet Irradiation of Pyrimidine in Interstellar Ice Analogs: Formation and Photo-Stability of Nucleobases\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNuevo, Michel; Milam, Stefanie N.; Sandford, Scott A.; Elsila, Jamie E.; Dworkin, Jason P.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAstrochemistry laboratory experiments recently showed that molecules of prebiotic interest can potentially form in space, as supported by the detection of amino acids in organic residues formed by the UV photolysis of ices simulating interstellar and cometary environments (H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, NH3, etc.). Although the presence of amino acids in the interstellar medium (ISM) is still under debate, experiments and the detection of amino acids in meteorites both support a scenario in which prebiotic molecules could be of extraterrestrial origin, before they are delivered to planets by comets, asteroids, and interplanetary dust particles. Nucleobases, the informational subunits of DNA and RNA, have also been detected in meteorites, although they have not yet been observed in the ISM. Thus, these molecules constitute another family of prebiotic compounds that can possibly form via abiotical processes in astrophysical environments. Nucleobases are nitrogen-bearing cyclic aromatic species with various functional groups attached, which are divided into two classes: pyrimidines (uracil, cytosine, and thymine) and purines (adenine and guanine). In this work, we study how UV irradiation affects pyrimidine mixed in interstellar ice analogs (H2O, NH3, CH3OH). In particular, we show that the UV irradiation of H2O:pyrimidine mixtures leads to the production of oxidized compounds including uracil, and show that both uracil and cytosine are formed upon irradiation of H2O:NH3:pyrimidine mixtures. We also study the photostability of pyrimidine and its photoproducts formed during these experiments.\n\nAdvancing viral RNA structure prediction: measuring the thermodynamics of pyrimidine-rich internal loops\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPhan, Andy; Mailey, Katherine; Saeki, Jessica; Gu, Xiaobo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAccurate thermodynamic parameters improve RNA structure predictions and thus accelerate understanding of RNA function and the identification of RNA drug binding sites. Many viral RNA structures, such as internal ribosome entry sites, have internal loops and bulges that are potential drug target sites. Current models used to predict internal loops are biased toward small, symmetric purine loops, and thus poorly predict asymmetric, pyrimidine-rich loops with >6 nucleotides (nt) that occur frequently in viral RNA. This article presents new thermodynamic data for 40 pyrimidine loops, many of which can form UU or protonated CC base pairs. Uracil and protonated cytosine base pairs stabilize asymmetric internal loops. Accurate prediction rules are presented that account for all thermodynamic measurements of RNA asymmetric internal loops. New loop initiation terms for loops with >6 nt are presented that do not follow previous assumptions that increasing asymmetry destabilizes loops. Since the last 2004 update, 126 new loops with asymmetry or sizes greater than 2 Ã 2 have been measured. These new measurements significantly deepen and diversify the thermodynamic database for RNA. These results will help better predict internal loops that are larger, pyrimidine-rich, and occur within viral structures such as internal ribosome entry sites.

We studied the impact of extracellular ribo-, desoxyribonucleotides and nucleosides on T-cell immunity. Peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMCs) or isolated CD3{sup +}T-cells obtained from 6 healthy donors were stimulated via CD3/CD28 Dynabeads or dendritic cells (DCs) in the presence or absence of pyrimidine-, purine-nucleotides and -nucleosides (range 2â200 ÂµM). Addition of deoxy-, guanosine-triphosphate (dGTP, GTP) and guanosine resulted concentration dependent in a complete, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) in a partial inhibition of the induced T-cell-proliferation. Deoxyadenosine-triphosphate (dATP), adenosine and the pyrimidine-ribo- and -deoxyribonucleotides displayed no inhibitory capacity. Inhibitory effects of dGTP andmoreÂ Â» GTP, but not of guanosine and ATP were culture-media-dependent and could be almost abrogated by use of the serum-free lymphocyte-culture-media X-Vivo15 instead of RPMI1640 with standard-supplementation. In contrast to RPMI1640, X-Vivo15 resulted in a significant down-regulation of the cell-surface-located ectonucleotidases CD39 (Ecto-Apyrase) and CD73 (Ecto-5â²-Nucleotidase), critical for the extracellular nucleotides-hydrolysis to nucleosides, explaining the loss of inhibition mediated by dGTP and GTP, but not Guanosine. In line with previous findings ATP was found to exert immunosuppressive effects on T-cell-proliferation. Purine-nucleotides, dGTP and GTP displayed a higher inhibitory capacity, but seem to be strictly dependent on the microenvironmental conditions modulating the responsiveness of the respective T-lymphocytes. Further evaluation of experimental and respective clinical settings should anticipate these findings.Â«Â less\n\nNucleobases and other Prebiotic Species from the Ultraviolet Irradiation of Pyrimidine in Astrophysical Ices\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSandford, S.

Although no Nheterocycles have ever been observed in the ISM, the positions of the 6.2-m interstellar emission features suggest a population of such molecules is likely to be present. In this work we study the formation of pyrimidine-based molecules, including nucleobases, as well as other species of prebiotic interest, from the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of pyrimidine in combinations of H2O, NH3, CH3OH, and CH4 ices at low temperature, in order to simulate the astrophysical conditions under which prebiotic species may be formed in the interstellar medium and icy bodies of the Solar System. Experimental: Gas mixtures are prepared in a glass mixing line (background pressure approx. 10(exp -6)-10(exp -5) mbar). Relative proportions between mixture components are determined by their partial pressures. Gas mixtures are then deposited on an aluminum foil attached to a cold finger (15-20 K) and simultaneously irradiated with an H2 lamp emitting UV photons (Lyman and a continuum at approx.160 nm). After irradiation samples are warmed to room temperature, at which time the remaining residues are recovered to be analyzed with liquid and gas chromatographies. Results: These experiments showed that the UV irradiation of pyrimidine mixed in these ices at low temperature leads to the formation of several photoproducts derived from pyrimidine, including the nucleobases uracil and cytosine, as well as their precursors 4(3H)-pyrimidone and 4-aminopyrimidine (Fig. 1). Theoretical quantum calculations on the formation of 4(3H)-pyrimidone and uracil from the irradiation of pyrimidine in pure H2O ices are in agreement with their experimental formation pathways.

The most commonly used fluorescent ribonucleoside is 2-aminopurine, a highly responsive purine analog. Responsive isosteric fluorescent pyrimidine analogs are, however, rare. Appending 5-membered aromatic heterocycles at the 5-position on a pyrimidine core has recently been found to provide a family of responsive fluorescent nucleoside analogs with emission in the visible range. To explore the potential utility of this chromophore for studying RNAâligand interactions, an efficient incorporation method is necessary. Here we describe the synthesis of the furan-containing ribonucleoside and its triphosphate, as well as their basic photophysical characteristics. We demonstrate that T7 RNA polymerase accepts this fluorescent ribonucleoside triphosphate as a substrate in in vitro transcription reactions and very efficiently incorporates it into RNA oligonucleotides, generating fluorescent constructs. Furthermore, we utilize this triphosphate for the enzymatic preparation of a fluorescent bacterial A-site, an RNA construct of potential therapeutic utility. We show that the binding of this RNA target to aminoglycoside antibiotics, its cognate ligands, can be effectively monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. These observations are significant since isosteric emissive U derivatives are scarce and the trivial synthesis and effective enzymatic incorporation of the furan-containing U triphosphate make it accessible to the biophysical community.

Many viral RNA structures, such as internal ribosome entry sites, have internal loops and bulges that are potential drug target sites. Current models used to predict internal loops are biased toward small, symmetric purine loops, and thus poorly predict asymmetric, pyrimidine-rich loops with >6 nucleotides (nt) that occur frequently in viral RNA. This article presents new thermodynamic data for 40 pyrimidine loops, many of which can form UU or protonated CC base pairs. Uracil and protonated cytosine base pairs stabilize asymmetric internal loops. Accurate prediction rules are presented that account for all thermodynamic measurements of RNA asymmetric internal loops. New loop initiation terms for loops with >6 nt are presented that do not follow previous assumptions that increasing asymmetry destabilizes loops. Since the last 2004 update, 126 new loops with asymmetry or sizes greater than 2 Ã"
