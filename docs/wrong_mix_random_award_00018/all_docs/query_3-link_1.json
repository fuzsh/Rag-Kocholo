For this purpose, we propose a LiDAR-based joint approach for calculating the solar irradiance incident on roofs and faÃ§ades of buildings at city scale, which includes a methodology for calculating solar irradiance, the validation of the proposed method, and analysis of its application. The calculation of surface irradiance on buildings may then inform photovoltaic power generation simulations, architectural design, and urban energy planning. Application analyses of the proposed method in the experiment area found that: (1) Global and direct irradiations vary significantly by hour, day, month and season, both following the same trends; however, diffuse irradiance essentially remains unchanged over time. (2) Roof irradiation, but not faÃ§ade irradiation, displays distinct time-dependent patterns. (3) Global and direct irradiations on roofs are highly correlated with roof aspect and slope, with high global and direct irradiations observed on roofs of aspect 100-250Â° and slopes of 0-60Â°, whereas diffuse irradiation on roofs is only affected by roof slope. (4) The faÃ§ade of a building receives higher levels of global and direct irradiations if facing southeast, south, and southwest; however, diffuse irradiation remains constant regardless of faÃ§ade orientation.\n\nEvolution of the Li-Yu Lake at Eastern Taiwan: Evidences from Magnetic Proxies and Pollen Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, T.; Wang, L.; Chen, S.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe Li-Yu Lake located at Hua-Lien County of eastern Taiwan seems to be originally a river and was trapped by a landslide to form a lake after. To investigate the truth, a lacustrine sediment core of about 8 meters was raised from the lake and magnetic proxies and pollen analysis were employed to analyze it. Based on the C- 14 dating, this core provides the information for the last 7000 years Magnetic proxies point out that the records could be clearly distinguished into two parts from the depth of about 2.6 meters : the deeper part dominates very coarse grained with higher oxidized magnetic minerals and vice versa at the shallower part. This boundary corresponds an ages of about 2300 yrB.P. Pollen analysis reveals that no pollen could be found at the depths below 2.8 meters; only aquatic plant pollens, such as Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Mynophyllum, were found at the depth between 2.8-2.5 meters; tree and shrub pollens began to appear at about 2.5 m in depth. These results proposed that sediments below 2.8 m (before 2400 yrBP) might be a river deposit; the river was blocked at its northern end to form a lake between 2300-2400 yrBP in consideration of the topography, and regular lake deposits occurred after 2300 yrBP. Furthermore, magnetic proxies were found to have a clear change during the age interval of about 900-600 yrBP. Pollen patterns also support this point. It is proposed that the river piracy might have happened at the southern area of the lake at this time. The literatures recording the human activity in this area seem to support this point of view.\n\nOndansetron blocks LiCl-induced conditioned place avoidance but not conditioned taste/flavor avoidance in rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRinaman, Linda; Saboury, Mitra; Litvina, Elizabeth\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe ability of an experimental agent to support conditioned taste/flavor avoidance (CT/FA) in rats often is interpreted as sufficient evidence that the agent produced a state of malaise or nausea. Paradoxically, however, CT/FA also is induced by certain drugs that support conditioned preferences in rats, suggesting that CT/FA is insufficient to reveal a negative hedonic state. The present study tested the hypothesis that the anti-nausea drug ondansetron (OND) would block the ability of nauseogenic lithium chloride (LiCl) to support conditioned place avoidance (CPA), without attenuating LiCl-induced CT/FA. After pre-treatment with either OND or vehicle, rats were conditioned with i.p. injection of 0.15M LiCl containing 2% saccharin (LiCl+sac) on conditioning day 1, and with 0.15M NaCl alone on conditioning day 2. Rats were confined to a distinct chamber of a CPA apparatus after each conditioning injection. In other rats, OND or vehicle pre-treatment was followed by NaCl+sac on conditioning day 1, and LiCl alone on day 2. Subsequent testing revealed that OND blocked the ability of LiCl to support CPA. Conversely, in the same rats, OND did not alter the ability of LiCl to condition avoidance of 0.2% sac solution during a 60 min bottle test. In a separate experiment, a sensitive 2-bottle choice test was used to confirm that OND pretreatment does not reduce the ability of LiCl to support CT/FA. These results support the view that CPA is an additional useful tool to reveal the experience of malaise and nausea in rats, whereas CT/FA demonstrated in bottle intake tests is insufficient for this purpose.

We observed a profound expansion of Firmicutes (specifically, Lactobacillus animalis and Lactobacillus reuteri) in the small intestine of diabetic fa/fa compared with nondiabetic fa/+ rats. RYGB-, but not DJB-, treated fa/fa rats exhibited greater microbiota diversity in the ileum and lower L. animalis and L. reuteri abundance compared with sham-operated fa/fa rats in all intestinal segments, and their microbiota composition resembled that of unoperated fa/+ rats. To investigate the functional role of RYGB-associated microbiota alterations, we transferred microbiota from sham- and RYGB-treated fa/fa rats to germ-free mice. The metabolic phenotype of RYGB-treated rats was not transferred by the transplant of ileal microbiota. In contrast, postprandial peak glucose levels were lower in mice that received cecal microbiota from RYGB- versus sham-operated rats. Thus, diabetes-associated microbiota alterations in fa/fa rats can be modified by RYGB, and modifications in the cecal microbiota may partially contribute to improved glucose tolerance after RYGB.\n\nDiabetes-associated microbiota in fa/fa rats is modified by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArora, Tulika; Seyfried, Florian; Docherty, Neil G; Tremaroli, Valentina; le Roux, Carel W; Perkins, Rosie; BÃ¤ckhed, Fredrik\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and duodenal jejunal bypass (DJB), two different forms of bariatric surgery, are associated with improved glucose tolerance, but it is not clear whether the gut microbiota contributes to this effect.

(Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA case of torrential precipitation process in the Mei-yu front, an Asian monsoon system east to the Tibetan Plateau, is studied with the coupled Penn State University/NCAR MM5 and NASA/GSFC PLACE (Parameterization for Land - Atmosphere - Cloud Exchange) models. Remote and local impacts of water vapor on the location and intensity of Mei-yu precipitation are studied by numerical experiments. Results demonstrate that the water vapor source for this heavy precipitation case in Yangtze river basin is derived mostly from the Bay of Bengal, transported by the southwesterly low-level Jet (LLJ) southeast to the Tibetan Plateau. The moist convection is a critical process in the development and maintenance of the front. The meridional and zonal secondary circulations resulted from Mei-yu condensation heating both act to increase the wind speed in the LLJ. The condensation induced local circulation strengthens the moisture transport in the LLJ, providing a positive feedback to sustain the Mei-yu precipitation system. It is found that local precipitation recycling shifts heavy rain toward the warm side of the Mei-yu front. This shift of rainfall location is due to the pronounced increase of atmospheric moisture and decrease of surface temperature over the warm side of the front.\n\nStarmerella camargoi f.a., sp. nov., Starmerella ilheusensis f.a., sp. nov., Starmerella litoralis f.a., sp. nov., Starmerella opuntiae f.a., sp. nov., Starmerella roubikii f.a., sp. nov. and Starmerella vitae f.a., sp. nov., isolated from flowers and bees, and transfer of related Candida species to the genus Starmerella as new combinations.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantos, Ana Raquel O; Leon, Marina P; Barros, Katharina O; Freitas, Larissa F D; Hughes, Alice F S; Morais, Paula B; Lachance, Marc-AndrÃ©; Rosa, Carlos A\n\n2018-04-01\n\nSix novel yeast species, Starmerella camargoi f.a., sp. nov., Starmerella ilheusensis f.a., sp. nov., Starmerella litoralis f.a., Starmerella opuntiae f.a., sp. nov., sp. nov., Starmerella roubikii f.a., sp. nov. and Starmerella vitae f.a, sp. nov. are proposed to accommodate 19 isolates recovered from ephemeral flowers or bees in Brazil, Costa Rica and Belize.

Here, key parameters of small-angle spectrometers are considered. It is shown that two-detector system is the basis of YuMO upgrade. It allows to widen the dynamic q-range twice. In result, the available q-range is widened and dynamic q-range and data collection rate are doubled. The detailed description of YuMO spectrometer is given.The short review of experimental researches made on the spectrometer in the polymers field, biology, material science and physical chemistry is given. The current investigations also have a methodological aspect. It is shown that upgraded spectrometer provides advanced world level of research of supramolecular structures.\n\nIs the onset of obesity in suckling fa/fa rats linked to a potentially larger milk intake?\n\nPubMed\n\nBuchberger, P; Schmidt, I\n\n1996-08-01\n\nWe wanted to find out whether fatty (fa/fa) sucklings show abnormal intake when given access to an abundant milk reservoir. To do this, we gravimetrically determined the milk ingested by small groups (4-5 pups) of 5- to 15-day-old lean (+/fa) and fatty littermates allowed to suckle for 30 min after their mother had not been nursing for periods of between 1 and 7 h. The pups were grouped randomly and their phenotypes retrospectively identified. Within both genotypes, the intakes of simultaneously tested pups were significantly higher in pups deprived for longer periods. Deprived and undeprived fa/fa pups ingested, however, slightly but significantly less milk than +/fa littermates did in the same nursing bout. In the first 2 wk of life, when fa/fa pups deposit nearly twice as much body fat as their +/fa littermates do, fa/fa pups will thus suckle less rather than more milk. This extends previous findings showing that the onset of fa/fa obesity is independent of larger intakes and thus questions that fa impairs a receptor primarily controlling food intake.\n\n[Herbological study on the botanical origin of the Chinese crude drug shan-zhu-yu].\n\nPubMed\n\nMikage, Masayuki; Hutagi, Yukari\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe historical change in the botanical origin of the Chinese herbal drug Shan-zhu-yu, San-syu-yu in Japanese) was studied herbologically. The results obtained were as follows: The original plant, described in Shen-nong-ben-cao-jing written in the Hou-Han Dynasty (A.D. 25-220) and Wu-pu-ben-cao written in the Wei dynasty (A.D. 220-265), was Prunus pseudocerasus or an allied species such as P. tomentosa. However, the original plant described in Ming-yi-bie-lu, written in the same era, was thought to be Cornus officinalis; the fruit of which is used commonly today as Shan-zhu-yu. In addition to Prunus and Cornus, the plants of the genus Berberis, of the family Berberidaceae, and Zanthoxylum of Rutaceae were also used in China until the Ming Dynasty. The plants of Elaeagnus, of the family Elaeagnaceae, were possibly used in ancient Japan. Cornus officinalis was determined to be the origin of Shan-zhu-yu during the Qing Dynasty, China.\n\nPREFACE: SANS-YuMO User Meeting at the Start-up of Scientific Experiments on the IBR-2M Reactor: Devoted to the 75th anniversary of Yu M Ostanevich's birth\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGordely, Valentin; Kuklin, Alexander; Balasoiu, Maria\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe Second International Workshop 'SANS-YuMO User Meeting at the Start-up of Scientific Experiments on the IBR-2M Reactor', devoted to the 75th anniversary of the birth of Professor Yu M Ostanevich (1936-1992), an outstanding neutron physicist and the founder of small-angle neutron scattering (field, group, and instrument) at JINR FLNPh, was held on 27-30 May at the Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics. The first Workshop was held in October 2006. Research groups from different neutron centers, universities and research institutes across Europe presented more than 35 oral and poster presentations describing scientific and methodological results. Most of them were obtained with the help of the YuMO instrument before the IBR-2 shutdown in 2006. For the last four years the IBR-2 reactor has been shut down for refurbishment. At the end of 2010 the physical launch of the IBR-2M reactor was finally realized. Nowadays the small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) technique is applied to a wide range of scientific problems in condensed matter, soft condensed matter, biology and nanotechnology, and despite the fact that there are currently over 30 SANS instruments in operation worldwide at both reactor and spallation sources, the demand for beam-time is considerably higher than the time available. It must be remembered, however, that as the first SANS machine on a steady-state reactor was constructed at the Institute Laue Langevin, Grenoble, the first SANS instrument on a 'white' neutron pulsed beam was accomplished at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at the IBR-30 reactor, beamline N5. During the meeting Yu M Ostanevich's determinative and crucial contribution to the construction of spectrometers at the IBR-2 high-pulsed reactor was presented, as well as his contribution to the development of the time-of-flight (TOF) small-angle scattering technique, and a selection of other scientific areas.

To date, mutations in 21 genes have been associated with an FA or an FA-like clinical and cellular phenotype, whose hallmarks are bone marrow failure, predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia and a cellular and chromosomal hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents exposure. The goal of this review is to trace the history of the identification of FA genes, a history that started in the eighties and is not yet over, as indicated by the cloning of a twenty-first FA gene in 2016.

It has many abnormalities, including hyperphagia, hyper-insulinemia, insulin resistance, low cerebral glucose utilization and an overactive hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis with resulting hypercorticism. Due to the latter consideration, the aim of this work was to study the impact of acute adrenalectomy (ADX) on the local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) of lean and obese fa/fa rats. ADX resulted in discrete increases in LCGU of regions common to both lean and obese rats. These common regions were found to belong to be related to the limbic system. Within this system, the LCGU of the brain of obese rats was either normalized to lean sham operated values or increased by ADX to a similar degree in both groups on a percentage basis. It was concluded that the LCGU of both lean and obese animals appears to be negatively regulated, albeit to different extents, by glucocorticoids. Such negative regulation is particularly salient within the limbic system of the lean rat and even more so in the fa/fa rat. It is suggested that the long-term hypercorticism of obese fa/fa rats due to abnormal regulation of the HPA axis may result in a decreased LCGU in limbic and related regions of the brain of fa/fa rats and contribute to the expression of the obese phenotype.\n\nReaction Î¼-+6Li-->3H+3H+Î½Î¼ and the axial current form factor in the timelike region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMintz, S.

We compared in vitro and real-life time to detection (TTD) of two blood culture media, BacT/Alert FA (FA) and BacT/Alert FA Plus (FA Plus), for the nine most common species of bacterial pathogens recovered from blood samples. Experimental data from simulated cultures was compared with microbiology records of TTD for both culture media with growth of the species of interest in clinical blood cultures. In the experimental conditions, median TTD was 3.8Â hours (23.9Â %) shorter using FA Plus media. The magnitude of reduction differed between species. Similarly, in real life data, FA Plus had shorter TTD than FA media; however, the difference between culture media was smaller, and median TTD was only 1Â hour (8.5Â %) less. We found shorter TTD with BacT/Alert FA Plus culture media, both experimentally and in real-life conditions and unrelated to antibiotic neutralization, highlighting the importance of appropriate blood culture media selection.\n\n[Textual research on Guang dong xin yu (New Sayings of Guangdong) quoted in Ben cao gang mu shi yi (Supplements to Compendium of Materia Medica].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Ruixian; Zhang, Wei; Li, Jian; Liang, Fei\n\n2014-05-01\n\nAltogether 15 terms for Guang dong xin yu (New Sayings of Guangdong) were used in Ben cao gang mu shi yi (Supplements to Compendium of Materia Medica), including Yue yu (Cantonese sayings), Chong yu (Sayings from Insect Drug), Jie yu (Sayings from Crustacean Drug), Xin yu (New Sayings), Yue hai xiang yu (Fragrant Sayings from Cantonese Region), Yue zhi mu yu (Sayings from Plants in Cantonese Annals), Guang dong suo yu (Trivial Sayings from Guangdong), Yue shan lu (Records of Cantonese Mountains), Yue lu (Cantonese Records), Jiao guang lu (Joint Guangdong Records), Yue cao zhi (Records of Cantonese Grasses), Guang guo lu (Records of Guangdong Fruits), Nan yue suo ji (Trivial Records of Southern Canton), Guang zhi (Guangdong Records), Yue zhi (Cantonese Records) etc. dealing with 57 sorts of drugs (with individual overlapping ones), the author of Xin yu was Qu Dajun, a surviving fogy of the Ming Dynasty actively involved in the activities to restore the old dynasty and resist the Qing Dynasty, and was persecuted in the literary inquisition in which his works were burnt so that Zhao Xuemin, when quoting his texts, had to go in a roundabout way.\n\nFanconi anemia (FA) binding protein FAAP20 stabilizes FA complementation group A (FANCA) and participates in interstrand cross-link repair.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeung, Justin Wai Chung; Wang, Yucai; Fong, Ka Wing; Huen, Michael Shing Yan; Li, Lei; Chen, Junjie\n\n2012-03-20\n\nThe Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway participates in interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair and the maintenance of genomic stability.

Here, we report the identification of a unique component of the FA core complex, namely, FAAP20, which contains a RAD18-like ubiquitin-binding zinc-finger domain. Our data suggest that FAAP20 promotes the functional integrity of the FA core complex via its direct interaction with the FA gene product, FANCA. Indeed, somatic knockout cells devoid of FAAP20 displayed the hallmarks of FA cells, including hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, chromosome aberrations, and reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination. Taking these data together, our study indicates that FAAP20 is an important player involved in the FA pathway.\n\nThe genome and structural proteome of YuA, a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage resembling M6.\n\nPubMed\n\nCeyssens, Pieter-Jan; Mesyanzhinov, Vadim; Sykilinda, Nina; Briers, Yves; Roucourt, Bart; Lavigne, Rob; Robben, Johan; Domashin, Artem; Miroshnikov, Konstantin; Volckaert, Guido; Hertveldt, Kirsten\n\n2008-02-01\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa phage YuA (Siphoviridae) was isolated from a pond near Moscow, Russia. It has an elongated head, encapsulating a circularly permuted genome of 58,663 bp, and a flexible, noncontractile tail, which is terminally and subterminally decorated with short fibers. The YuA genome is neither Mu- nor lambda-like and encodes 78 gene products that cluster in three major regions involved in (i) DNA metabolism and replication, (ii) host interaction, and (iii) phage particle formation and host lysis. At the protein level, YuA displays significant homology with phages M6, phiJL001, 73, B3, DMS3, and D3112. Eighteen YuA proteins were identified as part of the phage particle by mass spectrometry analysis. Five different bacterial promoters were experimentally identified using a promoter trap assay, three of which have a sigma54-specific binding site and regulate transcription in the genome region involved in phage particle formation and host lysis. The dependency of these promoters on the host sigma54 factor was confirmed by analysis of an rpoN mutant strain of P. aeruginosa PAO1. At the DNA level, YuA is 91% identical to the recently (July 2007) annotated phage M6 of the Lindberg typing set. Despite this level of DNA homology throughout the genome, both phages combined have 15 unique genes that do not occur in the other phage. The genome organization of both phages differs substantially from those of the other known Pseudomonas-infecting Siphoviridae, delineating them as a distinct genus within this family.\n\nFanconi anemia (FA) binding protein FAAP20 stabilizes FA complementation group A (FANCA) and participates in interstrand cross-link repair\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeung, Justin Wai Chung; Wang, Yucai; Fong, Ka Wing; Huen, Michael Shing Yan; Li, Lei; Chen, Junjie\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway participates in interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair and the maintenance of genomic stability.

I.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nUsing a multidetector system on the YuMO spectrometer allows shortening the time of measurements. The quantitative comparison of the measurement time using one and two-detector mode is done. The time range for experiments was from several minutes up to 12 hours. It was shown that two-detector system shortens more than twice the time of the measurement. While making a structural investigation using advanced software the two-detector system allows to treat the data at a qualitatively new level. An example illustrating the features of the channels choice and measurement time on the spectrometer was shown. The results of this paper could be used when planning the experiments on the YuMO spectrometer, for modernization of the installation and for equipment using time-of-flight method.\n\n2009 Mineral and Rock Physics Graduate Research Award to Yu and Austin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2010-04-01\n\nYonggang Yu and Nicholas J.

Recipients of this award are engaged in experimental and/or theoretical studies of Earth and planetary materials with the purpose of unraveling the physics and chemistry that govern their origin and physical properties. Yu's thesis is entitled âStructure properties and phase transitions in earth minerals: A first principles study.â Austin's thesis is entitled âGrain size evolution and strain localization in deformed marbles.â They were both formally presented with the award at the Mineral and Rock Physics focus group reception during the 2009 AGU Fall Meeting, held 14-18 December in San Francisco, Calif.\n\nEffects of antiglucocorticoid RU 486 on development of obesity in obese fa/fa Zucker rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nLangley, S C; York, D A\n\n1990-09-01\n\nThe effects of RU 486 (mitepristone), an antagonist of type II glucocorticoid receptors (GR), on the development of obesity in young 5-wk-old obese fa/fa rats has been investigated. After 15 days of treatment, body composition of obese RU 486-treated rats was similar to that of lean-vehicle rats. Analysis of body composition changes showed that RU 486 effectively reversed the obesity. It stopped fat deposition in obese rats but increased protein deposition to the level of lean-vehicle rats. RU 486 prevented the development of hyperphagia and reduced gross energetic efficiency in the obese rats but had little effect on lean rats. Brown adipose tissue mitochondrial GDP binding was increased in obese rats but was reduced in lean rats by RU 486 treatment. RU 486 also reduced the elevated activity of hippocampal glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, a glucocorticoid-responsive enzyme, of obese rats to the level of lean rats. The evidence suggests that abnormal activity of glucocorticoid GR receptors or abnormal cellular responsiveness to corticosterone receptor complexes may be important in the development of obesity in the fa/fa rat.\n\nA study of formation and development of one kind of cyclone on the mei-yu (Baiu) front\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Feng; Zhao, Sixiong\n\n2004-10-01\n\nThe paper presents one diagnosis of baroclinity and the coupling of jets during the developing process of a cyclone that occurred on the mei-yu (Baiu) front around the end of the second stage of the mei-yu (Baiu) in 1998. Results have shown that: (1) The advantageous changes of upper-level large-scale circulation caused the appearance and maintenance of the coupling between the upper-level jet (ULJ) and lower-level jet (LLJ) over the cycloneâs area. The coupling of jets in this case possesses some different characteristics from previous cases. Moreover, the coupling between the ULJ and LLJ caused the intensification of both lower-level convergence and upper-level divergence, which was favorable for the development of this cyclone. (2) From the analysis of the voricity budget, the role of lower-level convergence in the development of the cyclone was emphasized. Divergent wind in the lower troposphere was a direct contributor to the development of the cyclone. (3) During the development of the cyclone, cold air and warm air were active over the cycloneâs domain. Although this cyclone occurred at the mei-yu (Baiu) front, its development assumed baroclinity to a certain extent, which was just the main difference between this kind of cyclone and the first kind of low which is usually barotropic (or quasi-barotropic). (4) In recent years, studies on mei-yu front lows have paid more attention to the lower troposphere. In this paper, the analysis of the energy budget further supports this point: the certain effect of baroclinity forcing in the upper troposphere on mei-yu front lows cannot be ignored.\n\nThe Near-Earth Encounter of Asteroid 308635 (2005 YU55): Thermal IR Observations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLim, Lucy F.; Emery, J. P.; Moskovitz, N. A.; Busch, N. W.; Yang, B.; Granvik, M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe near-Earth approach (0.00217 AU, or 0.845 lunar distances) of the C-type asteroid 308635 (2005 YU55) in November 2011 presented a rare opportunity for detailed observations of a low-albedo NEA in this size range. As part of a multi-telescope campaign to measure visible and infrared spectra and photometry, we obtained mid-infrared (approx. 8 to 22 micron) photometry and spectroscopy of 2005 YU55 using Michelle on the Gemini North telescope on UT November 9 and 10,2011. An extensive radar campaign together with optical light-curves established the rotation state of YU55. In addition, the radar imaging resulted in a shape model for the asteroid, detection of numerous boulders on its surface, and a preliminary estimate of its equatorial diameter at 380 +/- 20 m. In a preliminary analysis, applying the radar and lightcurve-derived parameters to a rough-surface thermophysical model fit to the Gemini/Michelle thermal emission photometry results in a thermal inertia range of approximately 500 to 1500 J/sq m/0.5s/K, with the low-thermal-inertia solution corresponding to the small end of the radar size range and vice versa. Updates to these results will be presented and modeling of the thermal contribution to the measured near-infrared spectra from Palomar/Triplespec and IRTF/SpeX will also be discussed.\n\nSilicon Nanotips and Related Nano-Systems Involving Fluid and Carrier Transport and Their Micro-Devices for Power and Sensing Applications\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-05-10\n\nMethanolâ, Chien-Cheng Li, Ran-Jin Lin, Hong-Ping Lin, Ching-Chun Chang, Yu - Kai Lin, Li-Chyong Chen*, Kuei-Hsien Chen*, Chem.

This pathway is inactivated in FA, a devastating genetic disease, which leads to hematologic defects and cancer in patients. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel 20-kDa FANCA-associated protein (FAAP20). We show that FAAP20 is an integral component of the FA nuclear core complex. We identify a region on FANCA that physically interacts with FAAP20, and show that FANCA regulates stability of this protein. FAAP20 contains a conserved ubiquitin-binding zinc-finger domain (UBZ), and binds K-63âlinked ubiquitin chains in vitro. The FAAP20-UBZ domain is not required for interaction with FANCA, but is required for DNA-damageâinduced chromatin loading of FANCA and the functional integrity of the FA pathway. These findings reveal critical roles for FAAP20 in the FA-BRCA pathway of DNA damage repair and genome maintenance.

The basic dynamical properties of the system are studied. Minimum effective dimension 0.942329 for the existence of chaos in the proposed system is obtained using the analytical result. For chaos detection, we have calculated maximum Lyapunov exponents for various values of fractional order. Feedback control method is then used to control chaos in the system. Further, the system is synchronized with itself and with fractional order financial system using active control technique. Modified Adams-Bashforth-Moulton algorithm is used for numerical simulations.\n\nEffects of nonmagnetic disorder on the energy of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKiendl, Thomas; von Oppen, Felix; Brouwer, Piet W.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe study the sensitivity of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, bound states that form around magnetic scatterers in superconductors, to the presence of nonmagnetic disorder in both two and three dimensional systems. We formulate a scattering approach to this problem and reduce the effects of disorder to two contributions: disorder-induced normal reflection and a random phase of the amplitude for Andreev reflection. We find that both of these are small even for moderate amounts of disorder. In the dirty limit in which the disorder-induced mean free path is smaller than the superconducting coherence length, the variance of the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state remains small in the ratio of the Fermi wavelength and the mean free path. This effect is more pronounced in three dimensions, where only impurities within a few Fermi wavelengths of the magnetic scatterer contribute. In two dimensions the energy variance is larger by a logarithmic factor because impurities contribute up to a distance of the order of the superconducting coherence length.\n\nA leu-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase, FaRIPK1, interacts with the ABA receptor, FaABAR, to regulate fruit ripening in strawberry.\n\nPubMed\n\nHou, Bing-Zhu; Xu, Cheng; Shen, Yuan-Yue\n\n2018-03-24\n\nStrawberry (FragariaÃananassa) is a model plant for studying non-climacteric fruit ripening regulated by abscisic acid (ABA); however, its exact molecular mechanisms are yet not fully understood. In this study, a predicted leu-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinase in strawberry, red-initial protein kinase 1 (FaRIPK1), was screened and, using a yeast two-hybrid assay, was shown to interact with a putative ABA receptor, FaABAR. This association was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and shown to occur in the nucleus. Expression analysis by real-time PCR showed that FaRIPK1 is expressed in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit, with a particularly high expression in white fruit at the onset of coloration. Down-regulation of FaRIPK1 expression in strawberry fruit, using Tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing, inhibited ripening, as evidenced by suppression of ripening-related physiological changes and reduced expression of several genes involved in softening, sugar content, pigmentation, and ABA biosynthesis and signaling. The yeast-expressed LRR and STK (serine/threonine protein kinase) domains of FaRIPK1 bound ABA and showed kinase activity, respectively. A fruit disc-incubation test revealed that FaRIPK1 expression was induced by ABA and ethylene. The synergistic action of FaRIPK1 with FaABAR in regulation of strawberry fruit ripening is discussed.\n\nFANCM-FAAP24 and FANCJ: FA proteins that metabolize DNA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAli, Abdullah Mahmood; Singh, Thiyam Ramsing; Meetei, Amom Ruhikanta\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, cancer susceptibility and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Eight FA proteins (FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and âM) and three non-FA proteins (FAAP100, FAAP24 and HES1) form the FA nuclear core complex that is required for monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI dimer upon DNA damage. The other three FA proteins, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BACH1/BRIP1 and FANCN/PALB2, act in parallel or downstream of the FANCD2-FANCI dimer. Despite the isolation and characterization of several FA proteins, the mechanism by which these proteins protect cells from DNA interstrand crosslinking agents has been unclear. This is because a majority of the FA proteins lack any recognizable functional domains that can provide insight into their function. The recently discovered FANCM (Hef) and FANCJ (BRIP1/BACH1) proteins contain helicase domains, providing potential insight into the role of FA proteins in DNA repair. FANCM with its partner, FAAP24, and FANCJ bind and metabolize a variety of DNA substrates. In this review, we focus on the discovery, structure, and function of the FANCM-FAAP24 and FANCJ proteins.

The vegetables studied were mustard green, baby mustard green, gai choy, baby gai choy, yu choy, yu choy tip, bok choy, bok choy tip, baby bok choy, bok choy sum, Taiwan bok choy, Shanghai bok choy, baby Shanghai bok choy, rapini broccoli, turnip green, napa, and baby napa. This work led to the tentative identification of 71 phenolic compounds consisting of kaempferol 3-O-diglucoside-7-O-glucoside derivatives, isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside-7-O-glucoside hydroxycinnamoyl gentiobioses, hydroxycinnamoylmalic acids, and hydroxycinnamoylquinic acids. Ten of the compounds, 3-O-diacyltriglucoside-7-O-glucosides of kaempferol and quercetin, had not been previously reported. The phenolic component profiles of these vegetables were significantly different than those of the leafy vegetables from B. oleracea. This is the first comparative study of these leafy vegetables. Ten of the vegetables had never been previously studied by LC-MS.

Nopal, a cactus plant widely consumed in the Mexican diet, is considered a functional food because of its antioxidant activity and ability to improve biomarkers of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of nopal consumption on the development of hepatic steatosis and hepatic oxidative stress and on the regulation of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. Obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats were fed a control diet or a diet containing 4% nopal for 7 wk. Rats fed the nopal-containing diet had â¼50% lower hepatic TG than the control group as well as a reduction in hepatomegaly and biomarkers of hepatocyte injury such as alanine and aspartate aminotransferases. Attenuation of hepatic steatosis by nopal consumption was accompanied by a higher serum concentration of adiponectin and a greater abundance of mRNA for genes involved in lipid oxidation and lipid export and production of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and microsomal TG transfer proteins in liver. Hepatic reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation biomarkers were significantly lower in rats fed nopal compared with the control rats. Furthermore, rats fed the nopal diet had a lower postprandial serum insulin concentration and a greater liver phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT):AKT ratio in the postprandial state. This study suggests that nopal consumption attenuates hepatic steatosis by increasing fatty acid oxidation and VLDL synthesis, decreasing oxidative stress, and improving liver insulin signaling in obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats.\n\nGrowth and development of permanent teeth germ of transplacental Yu-Cheng babies in Taiwan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLan, Shoujen; Yen, Yeayin; Ko, Yingchin\n\nThis paper is intended to present a study of transplacental Yu-Cheng babies in Taiwan. The focus of the study is to demonstrate how a contaminated food source can affect the growth and development of permanent teeth germ in children. A sporadic outbreak of a peculiar skin disease was reported in Japan in October of 1968. An epidemiological study revealed the outbreak of this disease was caused by contaminated Kanemi rice oil. This episode of rice oil poisoned with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) was the first reported outbreak of PCB poisoning in the world. A second episode occurred in central Taiwan elevenmoreÂ Â» years after the Japanese episode. Registered data from the Taiwan Provincial Government Health Department reported 1,843 cases in 1980. Of this group, more than 800 women were child-bearing age and most of these women would or soon would be married and pregnant. The offsprings of these women were in danger, because it has been proven that PCB intoxication could affect the fetus. These babies, only contaminated through the placenta, are called PCB transplacental Yusho babies in Japan and PCB transplacental Yu-Cheng babies in Taiwan. Babies with PCB poisoning could have Fetal PCB syndrome (FPS) and may have retarded eruption of permanent teeth and other anomalies such as reduced numbers of teeth and abnormal shaped roots. The study of transplacental Yu-Cheng babies is an important public health issue for Taiwan. Although there may be other issues, this study focuses only on the growth and development of permanent teeth of those babies affected by PCB transplacental contamination.Â«Â less\n\nRegulation of palmitoyl-CoA chain elongation by clofibric acid in the liver of Zucker fa/fa rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nToyama, Tomoaki; Kudo, Naomi; Mitsumoto, Atsushi; Kawashima, Yoichi\n\n2005-05-01\n\nThe regulation of palmitoyl-CoA chain elongation (PCE) by clofibric acid [2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid] was investigated in comparison with stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in the liver of obese Zucker fa/fa rats. The proportion of oleic acid in the hepatic lipids of Zucker obese rats is 2.7 times higher than that of lean littermates. The activities of PCE and SCD in the liver of Zucker obese rats were markedly higher than in lean rats, and the hepatic uptake of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) was also higher in Zucker obese rats compared with lean rats. The increased activities of SCD and PCE in Zucker obese rats were due to the enhanced expression of mRNA of both SCD1 and rat FA elongase 2 (rELO2), but not SCD2 or rELO1. The proportion of oleic acid in the liver was significantly increased by the administration of clofibric acid to Zucker obese rats, and the hepatic PCE activity and rELO2 mRNA expression, but not the SCD activity or SCD1 mRNA expression, were increased in response to clofibric acid treatment. By contrast, the activities of both PCE and SCD and the mRNA expression of SCD1 and rELO2 in the liver were increased by the treatment of Zucker lean rats with clofibric acid. Multiple regression analysis, which was performed to determine the relationships involving PCE activity, SCD activity, and the proportion of oleic acid, revealed that the three parameters were significantly correlated and that the standardized partial regression coefficient of PCE was higher than that of SCD. These results indicate that oleic acid is synthesized by the concerted action of PCE and SCD and that PCE plays a crucial role in the formation of oleic acid when Zucker fa/fa rats are given clofibric acid.\n\nSurface characterization of colloidal-sol gel derived biphasic HA/FA coatings.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, Kui; Zhang, Sam; Weng, Wenjian\n\n2007-10-01\n\nHydroxyapatite (HA) powders are ultrasonically dispersed in the precursor of fluoridated hydroxyapatite (FHA) or fluorapatite (FA) to form a \"colloidal sol\". HA/FA biphasic coatings are prepared on Ti6Al4V substrate via dip coating, 150 degrees C drying and 600 degrees C firing. The coatings show homogenous distribution of HA particles in the FA matrix. The relative phase proportion can be tailored by the amount of HA in the colloidal sol. The surfaces of the coatings consist of two kinds of distinct domains: HA and FA, resulting in a compositionally heterogeneous surface. The biphasic coating surface becomes increasingly rougher with HA powders, from around 200 nm of pure FA to 400-600 nm in Ra of biphasic coatings. The rougher biphasic HA/FA surfaces with chemically controllable domains will favor cell attachment, apatite layer deposition and necessary dissolution in clinical applications.\n\nFA-SAT Is an Old Satellite DNA Frozen in Several Bilateria Genomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChaves, Raquel; Ferreira, Daniela; Mendes-da-Silva, Ana; Meles, Susana; Adega, Filomena\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract In recent years, a growing body of evidence has recognized the tandem repeat sequences, and specifically satellite DNA, as a functional class of sequences in the genomic âdark matter.â Using an original, complementary, and thus an eclectic experimental design, we show that the cat archetypal satellite DNA sequence, FA-SAT, is âfrozenâ conservatively in several Bilateria genomes. We found different genomic FA-SAT architectures, and the interspersion pattern was conserved. In Carnivora genomes, the FA-SAT-related sequences are also amplified, with the predominance of a specific FA-SAT variant, at the heterochromatic regions. We inspected the cat genome project to locate FA-SAT array flanking regions and revealed an intensive intermingling with transposable elements. Our results also show that FA-SAT-related sequences are transcribed and that the most abundant FA-SAT variant is not always the most transcribed. We thus conclude that the DNA sequences of FA-SAT and their transcripts are âfrozenâ in these genomes. Future work is needed to disclose any putative function that these sequences may play in these genomes.

In response to DNA damage, the FA pathway is activated through the cooperation of 16 FA proteins. A central player in the pathway is a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex or the FA core complex, which monoubiquitinates its substrates FANCD2 and FANCI. FANCE, a subunit of the FA core complex, plays an essential role by promoting the integrity of the complex and by directly recognizing FANCD2. To delineate its role in substrate ubiquitination from the core complex assembly, we analyzed a series of mutations within FANCE. We report that a phenylalanine located at the highly conserved extreme C terminus, referred to as Phe-522, is a critical residue for mediating the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI complex. Using the FANCE mutant that specifically disrupts the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction as a tool, we found that the interaction-deficient mutant conferred cellular sensitivity in reconstituted FANCE-deficient cells to a similar degree as FANCE null cells, suggesting the significance of the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction in promoting cisplatin resistance. Intriguingly, ectopic expression of the FANCE C terminus fragment alone in FA normal cells disrupts DNA repair, consolidating the importance of the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction in the DNA cross-link repair.\n\nThe Carboxyl Terminus of FANCE Recruits FANCD2 to the Fanconi Anemia (FA) E3 Ligase Complex to Promote the FA DNA Repair Pathway*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPolito, David; Cukras, Scott; Wang, Xiaozhe; Spence, Paige; Moreau, Lisa; D'Andrea, Alan D.; Kee, Younghoon\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFanconi anemia (FA) is a genome instability syndrome characterized by bone marrow failure and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents.

After overnight food deprivation, Zucker fatty fa/fa rats were given a meal glucose tolerance test. Plasma glucose response was determined for 180 min postprandially. At a dose of 0.16 g/kg body, fructose reduced (P < 0.05) the incremental area under the curve (AUC) by 34% when supplemented to a glucose challenge and by 32% when supplemented to a maltodextrin (a rapidly digested starch) challenge. Similarly, sucrose reduced (P = 0.0575) the incremental AUC for plasma glucose when rats were challenged with maltodextrin. Second-meal glycemic response was not affected by fructose supplementation to the first meal, and fructose supplementation to the second meal reduced (P < 0.05) postprandial glycemia when fructose had been supplemented to the first meal. In a dose-response study (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 g/kg body), supplemental fructose reduced (P < 0.01) the peak rise in plasma glucose (linear and quadratic effects). In the final experiment, a low dose of fructose (0.075 g/kg body) reduced (P < 0.05) the incremental AUC by 18%. These data support the hypothesis that small amounts of oral fructose or sucrose may be useful in lowering the postprandial blood glucose response.\n\nDiscovery of DLT18i/AT 2018yu with PROMPT and the DLT40 Survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSand, D.; Valenti, S.; Wyatt, S.; Bostroem, K.

This comes to a result that the identity of a product or a building faÃ§ade will commonly generate in the same way that the initial design was intended to. Rectifying the early model will then greatly impact the process later. The aim of this paper is to propose a way to solve these two challenges, without risking the manufacturing process, but more to explore the potential designs. Shape grammar is used to conceive more designs in the early stage, derived from the initial product - the modular adaptive faÃ§ade system. The derivations are then tested through simulation to state the efficacy of the models. We find that the workflow somehow contributes to the better design and engineering process as well as the solution allows diversification in the faÃ§ade expressions.\n\nFaStore - a space-saving solution for raw sequencing data.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoguski, Lukasz; Ochoa, Idoia; Hernaez, Mikel; Deorowicz, Sebastian\n\n2018-03-29\n\nThe affordability of DNA sequencing has led to the generation of unprecedented volumes of raw sequencing data. These data must be stored, processed, and transmitted, which poses significant challenges. To facilitate this effort, we introduce FaStore, a specialized compressor for FASTQ files. FaStore does not use any reference sequences for compression, and permits the user to choose from several lossy modes to improve the overall compression ratio, depending on the specific needs. FaStore in the lossless mode achieves a significant improvement in compression ratio with respect to previously proposed algorithms. We perform an analysis on the effect that the different lossy modes have on variant calling, the most widely used application for clinical decision making, especially important in the era of precision medicine. We show that lossy compression can offer significant compression gains, while preserving the essential genomic information and without affecting the variant calling performance. FaStore can be downloaded from https://github.com/refresh-bio/FaStore. sebastian.deorowicz@polsl.pl.

Since lignin is one of the polymers that strengthen plant cell walls and might contribute to some extent to fruit firmness monolignol biosynthesis was studied in strawberry fruit. Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and a peroxidase (POD27) gene were strongly expressed in red, ripe fruit whereas a second POD gene was primarily expressed in green, immature fruit. Moreover, FaPOD27 transcripts were strongly and constitutively induced in fruits exposed to Agrobacterium infection. Gene expression levels and enzymatic activities of FaCCR and FaCAD were efficiently suppressed through RNAi in FaCCR- and FaCAD-silenced strawberries. Besides, significantly elevated FaPOD transcript levels were detected after agroinfiltration of pBI-FaPOD constructs in fruits. At the same time, levels of G-monomers were considerably reduced in FaCCR-silenced fruits whereas the proportion of both G- and S-monomers decisively decreased in FaCAD-silenced and pBI-FaPOD fruits. Development, firmness, and lignin level of the treated fruits were similar to pBI-intron control fruits, presumably attributed to increased expression levels of FaPOD27 upon agroinfiltration. Additionally, enhanced firmness, accompanied with elevated lignin levels, was revealed in chalcone synthase-deficient fruits (CHSâ), independent of down- or up-regulation of individual and combined FaCCR. FaCAD, and FaPOD genes by agroinfiltration, when compared to CHSâ/pBI-intron control fruits. These approaches provide further insight into the genetic control of flavonoid and lignin synthesis in strawberries. The results suggest that FaPOD27 is a key gene for lignin biosynthesis in strawberry fruit and thus to improving the firmness of strawberries.

K.; Miller, B. R.; Rigby, M. L.; Reimann, S.; Muhle, J.; Agage, Soge, Snu Members, Kopri Members\n\n2010-12-01\n\nWe report on the atmospheric measurements and global emissions of the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) HFC-365mfc (CH3CH2CF2CF3, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane), HFC-245fa (CHF2CH2CF3, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane), HFC-227ea (CF3CHFCF3, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane), and HFC-236fa (CF3CH2CF3, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane). These measurements are from in-situ observations at stations of AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) and SOGE (System for Observations of Halogenated Greenhouse Gases in Europe), and from the Korean station Gosan. We also report on flask sample measurements from the Antarctic stations King Sejong and Troll, and extend our records back to the 1970s using archived air samples of both hemispheres. All data are used in a global 12-box 2-dimensional atmospheric transport model to derive global abundances and emission estimates. All four HFCs have strongly increased in the atmosphere in recent years with growth rates at nearly 10 %, resulting in dry air mole fractions at the end of 2009 of 0.49 ppt for HFC-365mfc, 1.00 ppt for HFC-245fa, and 0.51 ppt for HFC-227ea. HFC-236fa, for which we report the first atmospheric measurements, is less abundant and has grown to 0.069 ppt at the end of 2009. Our model results show rapidly growing emissions of HFC-365mfc and HFC-245fa after 2002 but surprisingly these have now started to decline to globally 2.7 kt/yr (HFC-365mfc) and 6.1 kt/yr (HFC-245fa). On the other hand HFC-227ea and HFC-236fa show uninterrupted growth in their emissions of 2.5 kt/yr and 0.2 kt/yr at the end of 2009.\n\nThe Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway confers glioma resistance to DNA alkylating agents.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Clark C; Taniguchi, Toshiyasu; D'Andrea, Alan\n\n2007-05-01\n\nDNA alkylating agents including temozolomide (TMZ) and 1,3-bis[2-chloroethyl]-1-nitroso-urea (BCNU) are the most common form of chemotherapy in the treatment of gliomas. Despite their frequent use, the therapeutic efficacy of these agents is limited by the development of resistance. Previous studies suggest that the mechanism of this resistance is complex and involves multiple DNA repair pathways. To better define the pathways contributing to the mechanisms underlying glioma resistance, we tested the contribution of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. TMZ and BCNU treatment of FA-proficient cell lines led to a dose- and time-dependent increase in FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and FANCD2 nuclear foci formation, both hallmarks of FA pathway activation. The FA-deficient cells were more sensitive to TMZ/BCNU relative to their corrected, isogenic counterparts. To test whether these observations were pertinent to glioma biology, we screened a panel of glioma cell lines and identified one (HT16) that was deficient in the FA repair pathway. This cell line exhibited increased sensitivity to TMZ and BCNU relative to the FA-proficient glioma cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of FA pathway activation by a small molecule inhibitor (curcumin) or by small interference RNA suppression caused increased sensitivity to TMZ/BCNU in the U87 glioma cell line. The BCNU sensitizing effect of FA inhibition appeared additive to that of methyl-guanine methyl transferase inhibition. The results presented in this paper underscore the complexity of cellular resistance to DNA alkylating agents and implicate the FA repair pathway as a determinant of this resistance.\n\nDiets containing salmon fillet delay development of high blood pressure and hyperfusion damage in kidneys in obese Zucker fa/fa rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nVikÃ¸ren, Linn A; Drotningsvik, Aslaug; Mwakimonga, Angela; Leh, Sabine; Mellgren, Gunnar; Gudbrandsen, Oddrun A\n\n2018-04-01\n\nHypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular and chronic renal diseases, affecting more than 1 billion people. Fish intake is inversely correlated with the prevalence of hypertension in several, but not all, studies, and intake of fish oil and fish proteins has shown promising potential to delay development of high blood pressure in rats. The effects of baked and raw salmon fillet intake on blood pressure and renal function were investigated in obese Zucker fa/fa rats, which spontaneously develop hypertension with proteinuria and renal failure. Rats were fed diets containing baked or raw salmon fillet in an amount corresponding to 25% of total protein from salmon and 75% of protein from casein, or casein as the sole protein source (control group) for 4Â weeks. Results show lower blood pressure and lower urine concentrations of albumin and cystatin C (relative to creatinine) in salmon diet groups when compared to control group. Morphological examinations revealed less prominent hyperfusion damage in podocytes from rats fed diets containing baked or raw salmon when compared to control rats. In conclusion, diets containing baked or raw salmon fillet delayed the development of hypertension and protected against podocyte damage in obese Zucker fa/fa rats.

Here, we investigate single manganese (Mn) atoms adsorbed on different surface orientations of superconducting lead (Pb) and the nature of their YSR states. Depending on the adsorption site and surface, we detect a distinct number and characteristic patterns of YSR states around the Mn atoms. We show that the YSR states inherit their properties from the Mn d levels, which are split by the surrounding crystal field. The periodicity of the long-range YSR oscillations allows us to identify a dominant coupling of the d states to the outer Fermi sheet of the two-band superconductor Pb. The long-range and directional nature of the states are promising for the design of coupled adatom structures, which could bear topological phases.

In situ measurements are from the global monitoring sites of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), the System for Observations of Halogenated Greenhouse Gases in Europe (SOGE), and Gosan (South Korea). We include the first halocarbon flask sample measurements from the Antarctic research stations King Sejong and Troll. We also present measurements of archived air samples from both hemispheres back to the 1970s. We use a two-dimensional atmospheric transport model to simulate global atmospheric abundances and to estimate global emissions. HFC-365mfc and HFC-245fa first appeared in the atmosphere only Ë1 decade ago; they have grown rapidly to globally averaged dry air mole fractions of 0.53 ppt (in parts per trillion, 10-12) and 1.1 ppt, respectively, by the end of 2010. In contrast, HFC-227ea first appeared in the global atmosphere in the 1980s and has since grown to Ë0.58 ppt. We report the first measurements of HFC-236fa in the atmosphere. This long-lived compound was present in the atmosphere at only 0.074 ppt in 2010. All four substances exhibit yearly growth rates of >8% yr-1 at the end of 2010. We find rapidly increasing emissions for the foam-blowing compounds HFC-365mfc and HFC-245fa starting in Ë2002. After peaking in 2006 (HFC-365mfc: 3.2 kt yr-1, HFC-245fa: 6.5 kt yr-1), emissions began to decline. Our results for these two compounds suggest that recent estimates from long-term projections (to the late 21st century) have strongly overestimated emissions for the early years of the projections (Ë2005-2010). Global HFC-227ea and HFC-236fa emissions have grown to average values of 2.4 kt yr-1\n\nWhole exome sequencing reveals concomitant mutations of multiple FA genes in individual Fanconi anemia patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited genetic syndrome with highly variable clinical manifestations. Fifteen genetic subtypes of FA have been identified. Traditional complementation tests for grouping studies have been used generally in FA patients and in stepwise methods to identify the FA type, which can result in incomplete genetic information from FA patients. Methods We diagnosed five pediatric patients with FA based on clinical manifestations, and we performed exome sequencing of peripheral blood specimens from these patients and their family members. The related sequencing data were then analyzed by bioinformatics, and the FANC gene mutations identified by exome sequencing were confirmed by PCR re-sequencing. Results Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of FANC genes were identified in all of the patients. The FA subtypes of the patients included FANCA, FANCM and FANCD2. Interestingly, four FA patients harbored multiple mutations in at least two FA genes, and some of these mutations have not been previously reported. These patientsâ clinical manifestations were vastly different from each other, as were their treatment responses to androstanazol and prednisone. This finding suggests that heterozygous mutation(s) in FA genes could also have diverse biological and/or pathophysiological effects on FA patients or FA gene carriers. Interestingly, we were not able to identify de novo mutations in the genes implicated in DNA repair pathways when the sequencing data of patients were compared with those of their parents. Conclusions Our results indicate that Chinese FA patients and carriers might have higher and more complex mutation rates in FANC genes than have been conventionally recognized. Testing of the fifteen FANC genes in FA patients and their family members should be a regular clinical practice to determine the optimal care for the individual patient, to counsel the family and to obtain a better understanding of FA pathophysiology\n\nWhole exome sequencing reveals concomitant mutations of multiple FA genes in individual Fanconi anemia patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Lixian; Yuan, Weiping; Zeng, Huimin; Zhou, Quanquan; Wei, Wei; Zhou, Jianfeng; Li, Miaomiao; Wang, Xiaomin; Xu, Mingjiang; Yang, Fengchun; Yang, Yungui; Cheng, Tao; Zhu, Xiaofan\n\n2014-05-15\n\nFanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited genetic syndrome with highly variable clinical manifestations.

It was confirmed experimentally that LiF-LiBr-KF (melting point: 425 Â°C, ionic conductivity at 500 Â°C: 2.52 S cm -1), LiCl-LiBr-KF (405 Â°C, 2.56 S cm -1), LiCl-LiBr-NaF-KF (425 Â°C, 3.11 S cm -1), LiCl-LiBr-NaCl-KCl (420 Â°C, 2.73 S cm -1), and LiCl-LiBr-NaBr-KBr (420 Â°C, 2.76 S cm -1) meet our targets for both melting point (350-430 Â°C) and ionic conductivity (2.0 S cm -1 and higher at 500 Â°C). A single cell using the newly developed LiCl-LiBr-NaCl-KCl molten salt as an electrolyte was prepared, and the DC-IR of the cell decreased by 20% than that of a single cell using the conventional LiCl-KCl molten salt. It was therefore concluded that the use of new quaternary molten salt systems can improve the discharge rate-capability in practical battery applications because of their high ionic conductivities.\n\nDisruption of the FA/BRCA pathway in bladder cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeveling, K; Kalb, R; Florl, A R; Herterich, S; Friedl, R; Hoehn, H; Hader, C; Hartmann, F H; Nanda, I; Steinlein, C; Schmid, M; Tonnies, H; Hurst, C D; Knowles, M A; Hanenberg, H; Schulz, W A; Schindler, D\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBladder carcinomas frequently show extensive deletions of chromosomes 9p and/or 9q, potentially including the loci of the Fanconi anemia (FA) genes FANCC and FANCG. FA is a rare recessive disease due to defects in anyone of 13 FANC genes manifesting with genetic instability and increased risk of neoplasia. FA cells are hypersensitive towards DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin that are commonly employed in the chemotherapy of bladder cancers. These observations suggest the possibility of disruption of the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway in bladder tumors. However, mutations in FANCC or FANCG could not be detected in any of 23 bladder carcinoma cell lines and ten surgical tumor specimens by LOH analysis or by FANCD2 immunoblotting assessing proficiency of the pathway. Only a single cell line, BFTC909, proved defective for FANCD2 monoubiquitination and was highly sensitive towards mitomycin C. This increased sensitivity was restored specifically by transfer of the FANCF gene. Sequencing of FANCF in BFTC909 failed to identify mutations, but methylation of cytosine residues in the FANCF promoter region was demonstrated by methylation-specific PCR, HpaII restriction and bisulfite DNA sequencing. Methylation-specific PCR uncovered only a single instance of FANCF promoter hypermethylation in surgical specimens of further 41 bladder carcinomas. These low proportions suggest that in contrast to other types of tumors silencing of FANCF is a rare event in bladder cancer and that an intact FA/BRCA pathway might be advantageous for tumor progression.

K-FAs were synthesised using coal fly ash as source of silica and aluminium. The synthesised materials were also mixed with Li 2 CO 3 and Ca(OH) 2 to evaluate their effect on CO 2 capture. Temperature strongly affected the performance of the K-FA sorbents, resulting in a CO 2 uptake of 1.45Â mmol CO 2 /g sorbent for K-FA 1:1 at 700Â Â°C. The CO 2 sorption was enhanced by the presence of Li 2 CO 3 (10 wt%), with the K-FA 1:1 capturing 2.38Â mmol CO 2 /g sorbent at 700Â Â°C in 5Â min. This sorption was found to be similar to previously developed Li-Na-FA (2.54Â mmol/g) and Li-FA (2.4Â mmol/g) sorbents. The presence of 10Â % Li 2 CO 3 also accelerated sorption and desorption. The results suggest that the increased uptake of CO 2 and faster reaction rates in presence of K-FA can be ascribed to the formation of K-Li eutectic phase, which favours the diffusion of potassium and CO 2 in the material matrix. The cyclic experiments showed that the K-FA materials maintained stable CO 2 uptake and reaction rates over 10 cycles.\n\nOptimizing Maintenance Manpower for USMC F/A-18 Squadrons\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-06-01\n\nexperience level, with the requirement of keeping a standard number of aircraft operationally ready.

In this work, double-well potentials at this surface were investigated using ab initio quantum mechanical methods. Quantum clusters were embedded in simulated Coulomb fields that closely approximate the Madelung fields of the host surface, and the ions that were the nearest neighbors to the F(A1) site were allowed to relax to equilibrium. The calculated Stokes-shifted optical transition bands, optical-optical conversion efficiency, and relaxed excited states of the defect-containing surface, as well as the orientational destruction of the color centers, recording sensitivity, exciton (energy) transfer, and the Glasner-Tompkins empirical relation were all found to be sensitive to the size of the dopant cation.\n\nDescription of immature stages of Scymnus (Neopullus) sinuanodulus Yu and Yao (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) with notes on life history\n\nTreesearch\n\nWenhua Lu; Phetsamon Souphanya; Michael E.

In Samoa, transgendered androphilic males are known locally as fa'afafine. Previous research has shown that, compared to Samoan gynephilic men, fa'afafine report greater willingness to invest time and money toward nieces and nephews (i.e., greater avuncular tendencies) and also have greater numbers of older brothers and older sisters. The present study examined whether the Samoan male sexual orientation difference in avuncular tendencies could be accounted for by these parallel differences in numbers of older brothers and older sisters. The sample included 204 fa'afafine and 272 Samoan gynephilic men from our Samoan data archive for whom we had concurrent information on (1) a measure of willingness to invest time and money in nieces and nephews (i.e., avuncular tendencies) and (2) numbers of older and younger biological brothers and sisters. Among fa'afafine, but not Samoan gynephilic men, number of older brothers and number of older sisters were both significantly positively associated with avuncular tendencies. When controlling for number of older brothers, the magnitude of the male sexual orientation difference in avuncular tendencies was lowered, but remained statistically significant. In contrast, when controlling for number of older sisters, the male sexual orientation difference in avuncular tendencies ceased to exist. Discussion detailed how these findings help hone in on the proximate basis of elevated avuncular tendencies among fa'afafine. In addition, discussion focused on how particular evolutionary and cultural factors might relate to the avuncularity of fa'afafine.\n\nLithium salts for advanced lithium batteries: Li-metal, Li-O 2, and Li-S\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nYounesi, Reza; Veith, Gabriel M.; Johansson, Patrik; ...\n\n2015-06-01\n\nPresently lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6) is the dominant Li-salt used in commercial rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on a graphite anode and a 3-4 V cathode material. While LiPF 6 is not the ideal Li-salt for every important electrolyte property, it has a uniquely suitable combination of properties (temperature range, passivation, conductivity, etc.) rendering it the overall best Li-salt for LIBs. However, this may not necessarily be true for other types of Li-based batteries. Indeed, next generation batteries, for example lithium-metal (Li-metal), lithium-oxygen (Li-O 2), and lithium sulphur (Li-S), require a re-evaluation of Li-salts due to the different electrochemical andmoreÂ Â» chemical reactions and conditions within such cells. Furthermore, this review explores the critical role Li-salts play in ensuring in these batteries viability.Â«Â less\n\nCosmologically allowed regions for the axion decay constant Fa\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKawasaki, Masahiro; Sonomoto, Eisuke; Yanagida, Tsutomu T.\n\n2018-07-01\n\nIf the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is already broken during inflation, the decay constant Fa of the axion can be in a wide region from 1011GeV to 1018GeV for the axion being the dominant dark matter. In this case, however, the axion causes the serious cosmological problem, isocurvature perturbation problem, which severely constrains the Hubble parameter during inflation. The constraint is relaxed when Peccei-Quinn scalar field takes a large value â¼Mp (Planck scale) during inflation. In this letter, we point out that the allowed region of the decay constant Fa is reduced to a rather narrow region for a given tensor-to-scalar ratio r when Peccei-Quinn scalar field takes â¼Mp during inflation. For example, if the ratio r is determined as r â³10-3 in future measurements, we can predict Fa â (0.1- 1.4) Ã1012GeV for domain wall number NDW = 6.\n\nA model study of the coupled water quality and hydrodynamics in YuQiao Reservoir of Haihe River Basin, People's Republic of China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, X.; Liu, J.; Peng, W.; Wang, Y.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nIn recent years, eutrophication has become one of the most serious of global water pollution problems, especially in reservoirs, which is menacing the security of domestic water supplies. As the unique drinking water source of Tianjin within the Haihe River basin of Hebei Province, China, YuQiao Reservoir has been polluted and its eutrophic state is serious. To make clear the physical and chemical relationship between transport and transformation of the polluted water, a model package was developed to compute the hydrodynamic field and mass transport processes including total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for YuQiao Reservoir. The hydrodynamic model was driven by observed winds and daily measured flow data to simulate the seasonal water cycle of the reservoir. The mass transport and transformation processes of TN and TP was based on the unsteady diffusion equations, driven by observed meteorological forcings and external loadings, with the fluxes through the bottom of the reservoir, plant (algal) photosynthesis, and respiration as internal sources and sinks. The solution of these equations uses the finite volume method and alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme. The model was calibrated and verified by using the data observed from YuQiao Reservoir in two different years. The results showed that in YuQiao Reservoir, the wind-driven current is an important style of lake current, while the water quality is decreasing from east to west because of the external polluted loadings. There was good agreement between the simulated and measured values. Advection is the main process driving the water quality impacts from the inflow river, and diffusion and biochemical processes dominate in center of the reservoir. So it is necessary to build a pre-pond to reduce the external loadings into the reservoir.\n\nTRIM.FaTE Public Reference Library Documentation\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nTRIM.FaTE is a spatially explicit, compartmental mass balance model that describes the movement and transformation of pollutants over time, through a user-defined, bounded system that includes both biotic and abiotic compartments.\n\nCloning and expression analysis of FaPR-1 gene in strawberry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMo, Fan; Luo, Ya; Ge, Cong; Mo, Qin; Ling, Yajie; Luo, Shu; Tang, Haoru\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe FaPR-1 gene was cloned by RT-PCR from `Benihoppe' strawberry and its bioinformatics analysis was conducted. The results showed that the open reading frame was 483 bp encoding encoding l60 amino acids which protein molecular weight and theoretical isoelectricity were 17854.17 and 8.72 respectively. Subcellular localization prediction shows that this gene is located extracellularly. By comparing strawberry FaPR-l and other plant Pathogenesis-related protein, homology and phylogenetic tree construction showed that the homology with grapes, peach is relatively close. In the treatments of ABA, sucrose and the mixture of the two, the expression of FaPR-1 in strawberry fruit were significantly increased.\n\nDevelopment of a Mathematical Model that Simulates the Longitudinal, and Lateral-Directional Response of the F/A-18 for the Study of Flight Control Reconfiguration\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1986-09-01\n\nrococo CO CO COooo...iHrHrH OOO<<< [l|[i4[x4 OOO OrHCM rococoOOO rHr-Hfâ I OOO [i4[ii[i4 OOO co<*lo cocoooOOO (HiâIrH OOO<<< [14 [14 [14 OOO loc^co rococo OOO iHr-irH OOO...kOâ O COH I Eh + CNiâ11â11âiQ â¢2WSO ’^J-* 1â 1 0-i 1â1 .
