Eric Morecambe of Britain's Morecambe and Wise comedy team died early this morning of a heart attack sustained at the curtain call of a performance in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. He was 58 years old.

The performance had been a double act with a longtime friend, Stan Stennet, one of the few occasions when Mr. Morecambe had not appeared with Ernie Wise since they teamed up as teen-agers in 1941. They first appeared on television in 1955 and six years later had their first television series. Throughout the 1970's, they regularly won television comedy awards, and for millions of Britons their Christmas television special became a tradition of the holiday season.

We Had Magic

''We had magic - wonderful magic - when we were on together,'' said Mr. Wise this morning. The two men were awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1976.

''Eric's death leaves a big whole in our business,'' said a fellow comedian, Eric Sykes. ''Eric and Ernie were probably the first act that TV made great.

Mr. Morecambe was born John Eric Bartholomew on May 14, 1926, son of a working-class family in Morecambe, a seaside town north of Liverpool. He made his professional debut at the age of 13 in a touring revue, where he first met Mr. Wise. Tall and bespectacled, Mr. Morecambe was the straight man in the early days of their act.

He changed his name in 1948. Mr. Morecambe had his first heart attack in 1968 and a second one followed bypass surgery in 1979. Once a heavy smoker and drinker, Mr. Morecambe abandoned both habits and became known for his advertising and charity work on behalf of heart research.

In addition to his television work and live performances, Mr. Morecambe made three films with Mr. Wise in the mid-1960's and they published several comedy books together. Mr. Morecambe also wrote a novel, ''Mr. Lonely,'' and a children's book, ''The Reluctant Vampire.''

Mr. Morecambe is survived by his wife, the former Joan Dorothy Bartlett, whom he married in 1952, and three children.
