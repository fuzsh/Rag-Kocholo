        "text": "Eric Morecambe’s widow says he would have been delighted his ­comedy is still remembered ­decades after his death.\n\nNext week fans will get to watch excerpts from a “lost episode” showing the first primetime Morecambe & Wise show screened on BBC1.\n\nAs part of the documentary Joan gives a interview about her comedy genius late husband Eric who died in 1984 aged 58.\n\nJoan said: “He used to say to me, ‘I do hope we won’t be forgotten. I do hope we will be remembered,’ and of course they have been remembered. He’d have been over the moon about that, he really would.”\n\nTheir daughter Gail added: “My father once said, ‘When I am gone you will watch the videos, won’t you?’. Because ­otherwise it will all have been for nothing.”\n\nJoan also believed Eric was always destined to be a star from an early age.\n\nShe said: “From the age of about three he was always doing something. He’d vanish, they would find him up the road entertaining a group of workmen. Just somehow that was in him.”\n\nOn the double act with Ernie Wise, she added: “Ernie was the very placid quiet one and Eric was more sort of up in the air and full of nervous energy.\n\nDo you enjoy reading about celebrities? Sign up for all the best celeb news from the Mirror here .\n\n“But it just worked for them and they were very good friends indeed, I never knew them to fall out ever.”\n\nEric’s son Gary discovered a film of the episode from 1970 in the family archive.\n\nOnly an audio version recorded by a viewer was thought to exist after the BBC wiped many of its master tapes.\n\nThe half-hour show begins with them in matching Paisley shirts and ties.\n\nThe pair then play a gag around Eric Morecambe having a new moustache.\n\nErnie says: “You’ve grown a moustache, a real one, and I know why. Because you’re getting middle aged... you want to look all young and trendy.”\n\nEric died in 1984 after a heart attack.\n\n*Morecambe & Wise: The Lost Tapes is on ITV on Wednesday at 9pm."
