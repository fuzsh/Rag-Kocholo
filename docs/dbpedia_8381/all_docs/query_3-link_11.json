        "meta_description": "John Bartholomew OBE was an English comedian better known by his stage name Eric Morecambe. A born performer, he took to the stage as a child and soon formed a friendship, and later on-stage pairing, with the more established child star Ernest Wiseman. The two formed a considerable bond and achieved national stardom under their performing names, Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise. Particularly successful during the 1960s and 70s, the duo were television royalty until Eric's death in 1984.",
