        "text": "‚ÄòTHE MORECAMBE & WISE CHRISTMAS SHOW 1970‚Äô\n\nPlease feel free to comment on my review.\n\nThe second Christmas Special is better than the first one. It also features some guest stars that I recognise. I always feel I want to connect to a guest star I recognise watching these Christmas Specials.\n\nThe guest stars in this Christmas Special are as follows. There are actors Peter Cushing, William Franklyn, Eric Porter and Edward Woodward; actress Ann Hamilton; singer Nina and Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen.\n\nIn this episode, Peter Cushing, a well-known versatile actor who played Dr Who in the Dalek films, returns to ask Eric and Ernie for money. He hasn‚Äôt been paid since the last show he worked with them.\n\nWilliam Franklyn guest stars with Eric and Ernie in an amusing play of ‚ÄòThe Three Musketeers‚Äô as well as Ann Hamilton. I enjoyed it when Eric made fun of William Franklyn mucking up his lines at times. üòÄ\n\nEdward Woodward sings the Fred Astaire classic ‚ÄòThe Way You Look Tonight‚Äô from the 1936 film ‚ÄòSwing Time‚Äô. Eric Porter also returns to do his sing-and-song dance routine with Eric and Ernie in this episode.\n\nI found it funny when Eric Morecambe through gritted teeth whispers to Ernie about Eric Porter. ‚ÄúGet rid of him! He was awful!‚Äù It was also funny when Eric Porter and Eric Morecambe had the same name.\n\n‚ÄòThe Morecambe & Wise Christmas Show 1970‚Äô rating ‚Äì 7/10"
