        "text": "Gracing the cover of our 117th edition is former Clash bassist, fine artist and solo musician Paul Simonon, who reveals how he styled the Clash in the early days and the importance of trilbies and pin stripes in one incarnation. Berets rather than trilbies are the hats of choice for our assessment of readers’ titfers in Am I Beret? while Chris Sullivan outlines the history of this quintessentially French lid. The return of the Dandy Doctor, in the form of Ncuti Gatwa, prompts a look at his main reference point in the frills and furbelows of Jon Pertwee. Film reviews contain an alternative ‘Unholy Trinity’ of folk horror classics, only keeping the Wicker Man from the canonical three usually observed. Our new Folklore sections climbs Silbury Hill, dances with Boss Morris and treads gingerly in the footsteps of Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel."
