Time, then, for another delve into a seasonal stocking-ful of visual delights. There are the usual stone-cold classics as well as the odd forgotten gem and some newer, future classics. So with that in mind, let’s unwrap the first of the gifts…\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS CHRONICLES (2018)\n\nOne Christmas Eve, brother and sister Teddy (Judah Lewis) and Kate (Darby Camp) decide to catch Santa Claus (the always excellent Kurt Russell) on camera. What they end up doing is something completely different! This festive family adventure from Netflix has everything you could possibly wish for in this type of film. Russell is superb as St. Nick and the two young leads are both likeable without being too schmaltzy. With great music and special effects and a nice little treat at the end, The Christmas Chronicles is one to seek out if you can.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nGROUNDED (2006)\n\nEn route to Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with their dad, two kids are left stranded at an airport when a blizzard grounds all flights. They, along with a group of other unaccompanied minors (incidentally, Unaccompanied Minors is the original title for the film), are forced to stay in a basement room by the Scrooge-like airport supervisor, Mr Porter (Lewis Black). The group bonds while creating their own makeshift holiday and avoiding Porter and his security guards. Yes, it’s cheesy and ever so slightly ridiculous, but it’s also great fun and perfect for these dark, winter nights where all you want is to switch off for ninety minutes.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nQUANTUM LEAP – “PROMISED LAND” (1992)\n\nIt’s no secret that Quantum Leap is one of my all-time favourite TV shows so it would have been remiss of me to ignore this festive episode from the fifth, and final, series. In it, Sam leaps into Willie Walters, Jr, one of three brothers who are in the process of robbing a bank a couple of days before Christmas. What makes this leap interesting, though, is the town the bank is in is the same one Sam grew up in. Having this local knowledge gives Sam all the help he needs to prevent the brothers from being shot and killed during the robbery. As an added bonus, Sam also gets to see his father one last time. This is the third, and final, episode of the show’s run directed by star Scott Bakula and is also a personal highlight of a season that divides fans and critics alike.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Sadly I can’t find any clips of this episode online so you’ll just have to trust me!\n\nTHE GREATEST STORE IN THE WORLD (1999)\n\nHere’s a forgotten gem of a TV movie featuring an array of famous faces. Dervla Kirwan stars as a homeless mum of two girls forced to spend the festive season sleeping at their local department store, avoiding the glare of the doorman, Mr. Whiskers (future Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi) and a couple of bungling jewel thieves. Featuring a who’s who of modern British television and film including Ricky Tomlinson, Brian Blessed and the late Sean Hughes, this is one of those great family-friendly Christmas films that should really be on every year.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: By some miracle, the whole film is available online!\n\nTHE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE (2006)\n\nThe two sequels to the 1994 original can be a little bit divisive but I love them. In particular I really enjoy the silliness of this one. Scott “Santa” Calvin (Tim Allen) and Carol, Mrs Claus (Elizabeth Mitchell) are happily settled into family life at the North Pole when an emergency meeting of the Legendary Figures is called. The evil Jack Frost (a brilliantly over the top Martin Short) is running amok and must be stopped before he can put his plan to dethrone Santa into effect. What follows is a twisty time-travel adventure (akin to the alternative timeline story in Back To The Future Part II) in which Jack tricks Santa into evoking the Escape Clause and wishing he had never become Santa in the first place. It’s fun, frothy and completely silly but I still love watching it (along with the other two) every year.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nINSIDE No. 9 – “THE DEVIL OF CHRISTMAS” (2016)\n\nI think I’ve made it quite clear that Inside No. 9 is one of the finest pieces of television of all time. Constantly surprising the audience with it’s twisted narrative, this particular “festive” episode from 2016 starts out as a retro-feel seventies drama but soon turns into something a hell of a lot creepier. Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are joined by Jessica Raine and Rula Lenska for this dark tale that has everything you could possibly need from any of the best No. 9 episodes. The final moments are a masterclass in rug-pulling. Seek it out.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Alas, no clips available online so you’ll just have to take my word for it!\n\nOFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY (2016)\n\nNormally I’d avoid films such as this like the plague but I was happy to be proven wrong on this one. When Carol Vanstone (Jennifer Aniston), an uptight CEO, threatens to cancel the company’s Christmas party, the manager, who also happens to be her brother, Clay (TJ Miller), decides to throw an epic shindig with the help of his Chief Technical Officer, Josh (Jason Bateman). The only trouble is, the party gets way, way, way out of hand. Like I said, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this silly, outlandish film and was also pleased that it overly sentimental, despite the festive theme and strained family dynamics. It’s one to try at least once, in my humble opinion.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\n8 SIMPLE RULES – “ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS” (2002)\n\nThis is one of those American sitcoms that could have had a much longer run had it not been for the untimely death of it’s star, John Ritter in 2003. Based on the novel 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter, this comedy series brought the family sitcom back in vogue and, for a while, looked like it was here to stay. In this festive episode from the first season sees Ritter’s character, Paul, and his wife Cate (Katey Sagal) deciding to make this Christmas the best ever while trying to pacify their three children, Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and Rory (Martin Spanjers) and keep up with the neighbourhood Christmas lights competition.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Sadly, no decent clips of this episode online so you’ll just have to trust me!\n\nTHE SNOWMAN (1982)\n\nIt’s hard to believe that this staple of Christmas television is closing in on forty years old. A very simple tale based on the bestselling book by Raymond Briggs, The Snowman is a delightful animation about a boy who makes a snowman only to find it come to life on Christmas Eve and take him on a magical flight to the North Pole. Not only is it a perennial favourite but it also brought us the classic festive song ‘Walking In The Air’ and made Aled Jones a household name.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Walking In The Air\n\nA VERY MURRAY CHRISTMAS (2015)\n\nIn this festive Netflix special, Bill Murray plays a version of himself who is worried that nobody will turn up to perform on his TV show due to a storm that has brought New York to a standstill. This is not your average Christmas special, sure, there’s music, dancing and laughter, but also a saccharine-free story of triumph over terrible weather. Featuring a host of guest stars, including George Clooney, Miley Cyrus and Paul Shaffer and co-written and directed by Murray’s Lost In Translation collaborator, Sofia Coppola, this is a very traditional, non-traditional Christmas treat.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nSCROOGE (1951)\n\nWidely regarded as the definitive cinematic version of the classic Charles Dickens story, this adaptation sees Alastair Sim take on the role of the bitter miser. Featuring a veritable who’s who of British stage and screen stars, its no wonder why everyone keeps coming back to this version. Sim is magnetic as Scrooge, forced to face up to his past when visited by the spirit of his late business partner, Jacob Marley (Michael Hordern), not to mention the three spectres of his Christmas past, present and future. It is a delightful rendition of a famous (and much-loved) story that is guaranteed to defrost even the coldest of hearts.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Scrooge and Marley\n\nAnd there you have it, another Christmas special all done and dusted! A couple of classics mixed in with some new pretenders to the festive crown all wrapped up with a nice, red bow! If you like what you see, please feel free to spread the word and stay tuned for more #MyLifeInFilm posts in the new year. Until then, may I wish you all the very best for the season and try not to get too egg-nogged this year!\n\nHalloween Spooktacular IV\n\nDo you like scary movies? I’m not the world’s biggest fan but can’t help but be drawn to the odd horror film every now and then. I guess we all like to be scared sometimes, and what better way than with a bit of celluloid terror? Switch off the lights, lock all the doors and check under the bed…\n\nTHE WOMAN IN BLACK (2012)\n\nIt’s rare these days to find a horror film that doesn’t rely solely on blood and gore to get its kicks. Even more rare to find a genuinely chilling horror film that has such a known history as The Woman In Black. Based on the novel by Susan Hill and following a 1989 TV Movie, this version comes from classic horror film studio Hammer and stars one-time Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe as solicitor Arthur Kipps, a grieving single father sent to a remote village to check on the documentation of the eerie Eel Marsh House. Whilst there, Kipps discovers that he is far from alone in this mysterious manor. Full of suspense at creepy atmosphere, this is ideal for those long, dark nights.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nSCREAM (1996)\n\nFrom the master of horror Wes Craven, this nineties teen chiller pretty much reinvented the genre and spawned a series of sequels and pale imitations. With an all-knowing self awareness of itself, Scream brilliantly reminds us of the great scary movies of yore. With a stellar line-up of up-and-coming teen stars including Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard as well as some more familiar faces, this is the film that launched a thousand spoofs and has since become a somewhat forgotten benchmark of what a truly clever horror movie should be.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The formula\n\nHIGH SPIRITS (1988)\n\nPeter Plunkett (Peter O’Toole) owns a dilapidated Irish castle-turned hotel. It is on the verge of repossession and so decides to spice things up a bit by having his staff pretend to haunt the building. When a bus load of tourists arrive, including Jack (Steve Guttenburg) and Sharon (Beverly D’Angelo), they also happen to bring along some real ghosts. Things get complicated when Jack finds himself falling in love with one of the ghosts (played by Daryl Hannah). From director Neil Jordan, this light-hearted (and pretty naff) comedy is enough to see you through a wet Sunday afternoon.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nAMERICAN HORROR STORY (2011-present)\n\nI arrived very late to Ryan Murphy‘s (Glee, Pose), frankly, bat shit-crazy anthology series. I’d heard so much good about it that I felt it was time to see for myself. I’m glad I did. This is one of those TV shows that leads you down one particular path only to sideswipe you several times along the way and leave you breathless. From season one’s ‘Murder House’ right through to the current incarnation, ‘1984’, what AHS does is to tap into our darkest fears and emotions and then ramps them up to the nth degree. Featuring an outstanding ensemble that includes Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Denis O’Hare and the imperious Jessica Lange, this has enough scares and horror to keep even the sanest of people up at night. Long may it continue.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer (‘Freak Show’)\n\nINSIDIOUS (2010)\n\nOn the surface this appears to be your average paint-by-numbers horror film about a “perfect” family living in a haunted house. Scratch underneath and things are a little more sinister. Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert move into a new home along with their two sons, Dalton (Ty Simpkins) and Foster (Andrew Astor). Soon after, Dalton falls into a mysterious coma…and then the really freaky stuff begins. Director James Wan (Saw) creates enough suspense and terror in the first of a successful franchise. With supreme support from Lin Shaye as Elise, the medium who holds the key to solving the mystery, Insidious is not one to watch alone in the dark (like I did!).\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nINSIDE No. 9 – “DEAD LINE” (2018)\n\nJust when you thought Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton couldn’t make their genius anthology show any better they brought us the wonderful sideswipe that was last year’s live episode. This show is known for pulling the rug from under the audience’s feet on many occasions, as well as tugging the odd heart-string along the way but what they achieved with Dead Line was just outstanding. The audience was wrong-footed from the off and the whole story took us down a completely different route than any of us was expecting. The fact that it was also live and interactive via social media made the whole experience that bit more special. Inside No. 9 is one of the finest pieces of television ever to grace our screens and I can’t wait to see what further delights they have to offer.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: You should just watch it (if you get the chance) – no clips available online so here’s an interview Reece & Steve did to promote the episode!\n\nTHE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE (2018-present)\n\nWhen I started to watch this Netflix chiller I thought it was going to be another bog-standard haunted mansion ghost story but it is something altogether more ingenius. Centered around a group of siblings, each with differing and complex story arcs, who grew up in the notorious Hill House. They each return to their childhood home when tragedy strikes and must face up to their demons and the mysteries that are held within the mansion walls. While some episodes do focus more on the drama of the family, there are some brilliant moments scattered throughout as well as some genuinely scary jumps that leave the heart racing. Its innovative, spine-chilling and compelling and I can’t recommend it highly enough.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nTHE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991)\n\nI’ll be honest, when I first saw this film (many years later) I wasn’t overly impressed. I’ve since grown to appreciate just how powerful a film it is. Based on the best-selling novel by Thomas Harris, it sees trainee FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) tasked with questioning notorious serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) about the behavioural patterns of another killer known as “Buffalo Bill”. What follows is a chilling cat and mouse game of wits between the two leading to an astonishing showdown. This cinematic phenomenon became only the third film in history, after It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest (1975), to win the Top Five Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director (the late, great Jonathan Demme), Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress and sent Hopkins into super-stardom as well as spawning countless, albeit less-effective, sequels.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Hopkins!\n\nHAPPY DEATH DAY (2017)\n\nThere have been many takes on the, now, classic Groundhog Day-style storyline wherein the main character must relive the same day over and over until they figure out the reason its happening. This one, though, is a pretty witty (and violent) version starring Jessica Rothe as Tree, who is murdered on her birthday only to wake up at the very start of her day as if nothing has happened and dying a different way each time. Her only way out is to find out who killed her and hopefully put a stop to the neverending time loop. Director Christopher Landon has brought us a modern classic and a sequel soon followed.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Welcome to the Pleasuredome!\n\nGHOST STORIES (2017)\n\nHere’s an absolute gem of a film. Based on the West End play by Jeremy Dyson (who also co-writes and co-directs the film with star Andy Nyman), Ghost Stories is one of the most cerebral and enjoyable British horror films in recent years. Nyman plays Professor Phillip Goodman, a skeptic who follows the stories of three unexplained paranormal encounters. What he discovers will test his belief to the limit. Featuring Martin Freeman, Paul Whitehouse and a brilliant performance from Alex Lawther, Ghost Stories is one of those films you need to watch carefully and then watch again.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nAnd there you have it, another Halloween special done and dusted. I hope you find something here you like and maybe haven’t seen before. If you do like what you’ve seen please feel free to get in touch, I’m happy to hear from you. My usual #MyLifeInFilm is taking a little hiatus at the moment but, fear not, another festive special is in the pipeline! Until the next time…sleep tight!\n\n“Well, Clarice – have the lambs stopped screaming?”\n\nMy Life In Film: Christmas Special\n\nHaul out the holly, put up the tree before my spirit falls again…yes, its that time of year again! The nights are drawing in, there’s a chill in the air and we can ‘officially’ watch our favourite festive treats (even though some of us probably watch them all through the year anyway!). I’ve pulled a couple of classic crackers this year including a childhood favourite that never gets repeated! It’s time we hung some tinsel on that evergreen bough and got down to business…\n\nA CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS (1965)\n\nI love a bit of Charlie Brown and this perennial festive treat is just the tonic for all those cynical types among you. Feeling downhearted by the blatant commercialism he sees around him, Charlie Brown sets out to find the true meaning of Christmas. He becomes the director of the school’s Christmas pageant but soon finds himself at a loss and turns to good friend, Linus, to show him the way. Its a beautiful story without being overly sentimental (although, at Christmas, that usually works for me!) and deserves to be on everyone’s watchlist every single year.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The meaning of Christmas\n\nALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS (1991)\n\nThis story is almost as old as the story of Christmas itself. A brother and sister attempt to bring their divorced parents back together for Christmas. Ethan (Ethan Randall/Embry) and his younger sister, Hallie (Thora Birch) are intent on spending the holidays with both parents and their wealthy grandmother, Lillian (Lauren Bacall) but pretty much every scheme they come up with goes wrong. Hallie even has a quiet word with a department store Santa (Leslie Nielsen) to try and fix things. What follows is your usual mix of kid-friendly slapstick moments and heart-warming saccharine. The film works, for me at least, due to the charm of the two young leads who carry the film off and make a few wishes come true in the process.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Visiting Santa again!\n\nGET SANTA (2014)\n\nSanta (Jim Broadbent) crashes his sleigh and finds himself on the run from the police. Nine-year-old Tom (Kit Connor) finds him in his shed and convinces his father, Steve (Rafe Spall) to help Santa find his way back home. Along the way there are a myriad of incidents (including a spell in prison for the jolly, old fat man!) which keep the pace and steer the story away from being overly sweet and keeping it real. Also featuring a stellar supporting cast that includes Joanna Scanlan, Jodie Whittaker and Stephen Graham, Get Santa is a worthy entry into the festive canon of film favourites.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer!\n\nARTHUR CHRISTMAS (2011)\n\nJim Broadbent plays Santa again in this wonderful animated film from the miracle makers at Aardman studios. Santa’s clumsy son, Arthur (James McAvoy) joins forces with his grandfather, St Nick (Bill Nighy) to deliver a forgotten present to a little girl before Christmas morning dawns. As you’d expect from Aardman, the animation is superb and the script is witty and full of heart and laughter. Its the perfect family film to get yourself in the festive spirit.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Dash Away!\n\nNOEL’S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS (BBC 1989-1999, SKY 2007-2012)\n\nThis was the ultimate feelgood television experience. Long-standing BBC host Noel Edmonds would deliver once in a lifetime presents to the most deserving of people. It was a must-watch on a Christmas Day and was one of the only times I ever saw my dad crying at the TV. It often found recipients who were or had been extremely ill, pillars of the local community as well as those who were just deserving of something special. I loved it. I never missed it until Noel moved to Sky where I only caught it once or twice. For me, though, Noel’s place was always at the BBC on Christmas Day.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode from Christmas Day 1995!\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS RACCOONS (1980)\n\nIts Christmas Eve and Forest Ranger Dan discovers someone is chopping down all the trees, including the home of three raccoons – Bert, Melissa and Ralph. As he goes to investigate, his two children take advantage of a fallen tree and take it home to decorate for the holidays, not realising that it is the raccoons home. Much like the series that followed, this festive special is all about protecting the environment while still being an entertainment for the whole family. Sure, it gets a little schmaltzy but who doesn’t love a bit of that at Christmas?\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Someone has uploaded the full thing to YouTube!\n\nA CHRISTMAS STORY (1983)\n\nAll 9-year-old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun. When he brings up the subject his mother tells him he’ll have his eye out. This is one of those films that I’d heard about for years but never actually got around to watching until a couple of Christmases ago. I was so glad I did as it is a joy from start to finish. What makes it so is the combination of a brilliantly quirky script and an amazing performance from Billingsley as Ralphie. There are so many wonderful, heartfelt moments in this film that you really have to see it for yourself to truly understand its magic.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Meeting Santa!\n\nHIGHWAY TO HEAVEN – “WITH LOVE, THE CLAUS” (1987)\n\nIf you like your Christmas treats with added sweetener then look no further than this diabetic coma-inducing festive episode from Highway to Heaven. Jonathan (Michael Landon) and Mark (Victor French) have been assigned to stop a bickering divorced couple from using their young son as a pawn between them. The pair also meet a department store Santa (Bill Erwin) who, disapproving of the store’s Christmas policies, gets himself arrested and needs Jonathan to defend him. With more than a nod to Miracle on 34th Street, this is one of those episodes where you may need to cleanse yourself with some horror afterwards!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The full episode!\n\nTHE BOX OF DELIGHTS (1984)\n\nBased on the book by John Masefield, this classic children’s fantasy adventure was shown on the BBC in six parts. It tells the story of Kay Harker (Devin Stanfield) who, while travelling home for Christmas on the train, encounters a mysterious, yet kindly old man (Patrick Troughton) who gives him the box of delights. Full of wonder and festive magic, The Box of Delights is a programme that I remember watching at the time but have never seen since. As far as I’m aware it hasn’t been repeated for a long time and I think that should be rectified. The BBC did (and sometimes still does) this kind of show very well and its a testament to the quality that its still widely regarded and talked about over thirty years later.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Those opening titles! All six episodes are here on YouTube as well!\n\nCHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS (2004)\n\nWhen their daughter, Blair (Julie Gonzalo), joins the Peace Corps and heads off to Peru, Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) Krank decide to skip their usual Christmas festivities and take a luxury cruise much to the disgust of their friends and neighbours (including Dan Aykroyd). However, their plans are put on hold when Blair unexpectedly returns home with the intention of showing her new fiancé the full Krank Christmas experience. What you get with this film is a lot of good intention, mixed with a bit of slapstick comedy and topped off with a bit of saccharine. Don’t get me wrong, I love it but for some it can be a little too clawing.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Hickory Honey Ham!\n\nTRADING PLACES (1983)\n\nJamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd appear again in this, our final festive offering this year. Here, Aykroyd plays Louis Winthorpe III, a commodities broker at a respectable firm owned by brothers Mortimer (Don Ameche) and Randolph (Ralph Bellamy) Duke. The brothers wager a bet over whether a person’s hereditary of social situation can lead to their success. As part of the bet they arrange for Winthorpe to lose his high-paid job and switch places with mouthy down-and-out Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy). Its a role reversal that sees Valentine assume Winthorpe’s life while Winthorpe himself is tossed out on to the street with only a friendly hooker (Curtis) to help him. Its a classic comedy from director John Landis that isn’t your average Christmas movie but still has plenty of the festive spirit.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Bad Santa!\n\nAnd there you have it – Christmas, done and dusted for another year! Its really difficult (but fun) to pick out a selection of festive goodies for you to enjoy, there are so many out there to choose from. Don’t worry, there’s enough for next year! If you’ve enjoyed this countdown, please feel free to get in touch – maybe offer up your own Christmas favourites that may or may not have been included before. In the meantime, here’s hoping you all have a merry and peaceful Christmas and here’s to 2019 being slightly better than this year!\n\n“This is Santa Claus, not Dear Abby”\n\nMy Life In TV: Part Thirty\n\nHere we go, the final part of this televisual odyssey. I say ‘final’ but I could, quite honestly, change my mind by the time it comes around again. For now, though, take it all in as from the next edition, the movies will reign supreme once more. For this (so far) last edition there are dodgy dealers, rule breakers and a talking pot plant! Let’s get to work…\n\nLAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER (2014-present)\n\nI usually don’t participate in political programmes, I find myself getting far too angry watching the stupidity of the world. Thankfully, there is a show that watches everything for me. British export and former Daily Show correspondent, John Oliver, presents a weekly news satire show, dissecting the week’s news and shedding light on the stories missing from the headlines. Its a pretty no-holds-barred approach to the subject, especially in this turbulent time for global politics, and I can honestly say I’ve learned more from watching this show than I ever could watching the news itself!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Stupid Watergate!\n\nMURDER ONE (1995-1997)\n\nWhat I remember most about this show from Steven Bochco was the gruff performance of the first series lead, Daniel Benzali. He was Teddy Hoffman, a brilliant lawyer in charge of a crack team of litigators who are defending the rather seedy Stanley Tucci in a high profile murder case. Tucci’s character is found not guilty but continues to plant himself into the investigation when a hot, young actor is later on trial for the same murder. The story plays out over the whole series (a rarity back then) and the show returned for a second series but, by that time, most of the original cast had been replaced and the show suffered as a result.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles (Series 1)\n\nONLY FOOLS AND HORSES… (1981-2003)\n\nI can’t believe its taken me all this time to add this classic sitcom to the list (in all honesty, I thought I’d already done it!). From the brilliant mind of John Sullivan, OFAH follows the lives of two brothers – Del (David Jason) and Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst) – who live with their grandad (Lennard Pearce) on a rough Peckham estate. Ever the entrepreneurs, Del and Rodney jump from dodgy deal to even dodgier deal in search for that elusive scheme that will make them millionaires. Sullivan’s writing, as ever, is full of pathos and punch-in-the-face comedy, delivered by an exceptional cast that ensured this would be one of Britain’s best-loved sitcoms of all time.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The bar scene!\n\nTHE ADVENTURE GAME (1980-1986)\n\nNow this show was bonkers! I have very vague memories of it, mostly the Vortex Game at the end, but it seems to be one of those programmes that sits nicely in the hearts of a certain generation. A group of celebrities of the day find themselves trapped on a planet and must navigate their way out by finding a crystal to power their spaceship home. Unfortunately they have to solve some fiendish puzzles in order to do so. It was a mental programme, with a pot plant that was also royalty, serious newsreader Moira Stuart in a jumpsuit and that end game where, if you stepped on the wrong square you were zapped into non-existence (or something like that!). Bonkers!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The Vortex!\n\nDIFF’RENT STROKES (1978-1986)\n\nOne of the many ways a sitcom can immediately grab an audience is either with a fish-out-of-water situation or a cultural and social clash. Diff’rent Strokes seemed to cover both bases with a wealthy Manhattan family adopting the children of their late, African American housekeeper. As well as the usual issues and moral high ground episodes, this sitcom was all about Arnold (Gary Coleman) who, along with his brother Willis (Todd Bridges) cause all sorts of chaos for Phillip Drummond (Conrad Bain) and his daughter, Kimberley (Dana Plato). With a catchphrase that has spanned the decades and the sad, true life stories of some of its stars, Diff’rent Strokes has almost become more infamous than most other shows of the time.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: That theme song!\n\nDIY SOS (1999-present)\n\nWhat I love about DIY SOS is how it has evolved since it first started almost twenty years ago! Back then it was your standard half-hour home renovation programme, but along the way it has become something much more significant. Actually changing lives rather than just a room or two. Presented by Nick Knowles, the show now features ‘Big Builds’ where massive projects that would normally take months to complete are undertaken in just 9 days. Projects that affect communities, bring families together and make a difference when all hope has been lost. The team – Billy, Chris, Julian, Mark and a revolving door of designers – work brilliantly together, getting stuck into the lives of those they are changing. It is truly one of the most uplifting television programmes you could ever watch.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode!\n\nC.A.B. (1986-1989)\n\nI’ll be honest, I remember very little about what this programme was all about other than it involved two kids investigating weird goings on from their base of a bric-a-brac shop, formerly a Citizens Advice Bureau (the CAB of the title). I seem to recall the mysteries they solved were of the ancient and mystical kind, often involving bizarre characters that would frequent the shop. I remember watching it and wanting to be a secret agent just like Colin and Franny but nothing ever happened where I lived! It ran for three series but, frankly, I couldn’t tell you anything more about it. If you want the full lowdown, click here for an exhaustive website!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Compilation\n\nA COUNTRY PRACTICE (1981-1993)\n\nI’ve made no secret of my love for the Australian soaps, I’d go so far as to say there should be a dedicated channel just showing all the classics. A Country Practice, set in the fictional rural town of Wandin Valley, follows the lives of its residents and the daily events at the busy hospital and surrounding areas. Full of the usual types of characters, I always thought this show was more light-hearted than all the others and, as such, I think I probably enjoyed it more when it was shown here on weekday afternoons. Also, its another memory I have of sharing a programme with my mum who also loved an Aussie soap!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The opening theme\n\nTHE KENNY EVERETT TELEVISION SHOW (1981-1988)\n\nI was probably too young to actually remember this going out live but I do have memories of watching it. Even as a youngster I was aware that Kenny Everett wasn’t like anybody else on TV. He was dangerous, a rule-breaker and for a long time I didn’t really ‘get’ what it was he was doing. I think he was too ahead of his time to be taken seriously as an innovator. This show broke moulds. It brought techniques to television that nobody else had thought about as well as some of the funniest characters and sketches you could imagine. Everett died too young, but left a broadcasting legacy that has been harvested in the years since his passing.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The Best Of…\n\nSUPERTED (1983-1986)\n\nYou know the story, a teddy bear is discarded at the factory for being defective, teddy bear is found by a visiting alien who sprinkles his cosmic dust and teddy bear becomes super hero! SuperTed (voiced by Derek Griffiths) and his trusty friend, Spotty (Jon Pertwee) save those in need from the likes of the evil Texas Pete (Victor Spinetti) and his sidekicks Bulk (Roy Kinnear) and Skeleton (Melvyn Hayes). Whenever I think of this charming animation it is with fondness and with a hope that, one day, it will be repeated again!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that! Thirty editions of My Life In TV… which equates to 300 television programmes that I have watched, loved and been inspired by over the years. Who knows, maybe I’ll return to this segment again but, for now, its taking a well earned rest. The next time we meet it will be at the movies. If, for some bizarre reason, you have enjoyed this blog then please do feel free to get in touch and, if at all possible, tell your friends. I’d love to hear from you. Until we meet again…\n\n“It was all done in the best possible taste!”\n\nTV Heroes: Morecambe & Wise\n\nThere are very few comedians today that I can watch over and over again and still laugh out loud like it was the first time. That’s the feeling I get whenever I watch an episode of The Morecambe & Wise Show. It doesn’t matter how many times I’ve seen them I still find myself in fits of laughter at their silliness.\n\nEric and Ernie were, and in my opinion still are, Britain’s greatest double act. A friendship formed on the stages of vaudeville theatres up and down the country, carefully honing their routine before the bright lights of radio and television called to them.\n\nThey made their name in radio before transferring to television in their now infamous first series for the BBC, Running Wild. This sketch show wasn’t well received. Following the first episode Kenneth Bailey, writing for The People, said of the programme:\n\n“Definition of the Week: TV set: the box in which they buried Morecambe and Wise”\n\nSuch was the impact of this one review, Eric is said to have carried it in his wallet for the rest of his life. The series ran for six episodes before disappearing without a trace. Disheartened by the experience, the pair returned to the variety circuit where they knew they could control the output.\n\nAfter treading the comedy boards for a while, they were soon invited back as guests on various radio and television shows. Upon their return from a tour of Australia they realised that live variety was dying and being replaced by the much more popular television. They decided to concentrate on getting themselves another shot at a TV series which they soon received in the shape of Two of a Kind for ATV.\n\nTwo of a Kind saw Eric and Ernie team up with writers Sid Green and Dick Hills and, following a lucky break involving an actors strike, the show found a rhythm and, more importantly, an audience. This series saw the beginning of some of the gags and catchphrases that the pair became famous for, not to mention the humiliating of their celebrity guests. Running for six series, in 1968 Lew Grade began negotiating for the pair to return for a further three years but, unable to offer the technological advances of his competitors (producing the show in colour!), Grade’s attempts failed as Eric and Ernie accepted an offer to return to the BBC.\n\nOn September 2nd 1968 the first episode of The Morecambe & Wise Show was broadcast on BBC2. As part of the deal, Sid and Dick were brought across to write the scripts with John Ammonds coming on board as producer with Ernest Maxin taking over the reins from 1975. Satisfied with the finished product, the new team were looking forward to preparing for the next series when, on November 2nd, just over two weeks after the last episode of the series aired, Eric suffered a massive heart attack while driving to his hotel in Batley. Immediately, plans for the next series were put on hold with Bill Cotton, head of BBC, allowing whatever time was needed for a full recovery. Sid and Dick, however, were less convinced that Eric would return to work and thus decided to quit and return to ATV.\n\nEnter Eddie Braben. Ken Dodd‘s gag writer, Braben brought a warmth and love to the duo’s act that had previously been missing based on his own observations of the pair. The shows became more structured, the opening ‘spot’ in front of curtains that added to the live theatre feel of the show along with guests, scenes set in their flat, the play ‘wot Ernie wrote’ and, of course, the song at the end. It gave the audience the feel that they had actually spent the night out at the theatre and, gradually, the numbers increased. Viewing figures rose, especially for the Christmas specials, with the 1977 Christmas show reaching peak audience of 28 million. But, early the next year, the pair announced that they would once again be leaving the BBC for a new life at Thames Television.\n\nThe lure of the Thames years was the promise of more films. They had made three films in the sixties for the Rank Organisation – The Intelligence Men (1965), That Riviera Touch (1966) and The Magnificent Two (1967) – but neither of these movies set the world alight. Thames offered the opportunity to make another film alongside their usual television work. Unfortunately, the dream BBC team didn’t follow the duo to ITV – Maxin declined the move while Braben was under an exclusive contract to write for the BBC. Barry Cryer and John Junkin were brought on as writers but, by 1979 Eric had suffered another heart attack, this time requiring bypass surgery. Their first, full series for Thames came in 1980 once Eric had fully recovered. By this time John Ammonds had come back on board and had successfully lobbied for Braben to return once his BBC contract had ended. However, the reduced running time and added commercial breaks restricted Braben’s creativity and the show found itself reusing old gags. After four series for Thames and the pair becoming less enamoured with the process as well as a poorly-received (and downright terrible) film – Night Train To Murder (1984) – the pair brought the series to an end.\n\nBy 1984 Eric was happy in semi-retirement, concentrating on his writing while still fulfilling the odd work commitment, like the one he had with old friend Stan Stennett. The show was a light-hearted Q&A that soon turned into a one-man show with Eric delighting at the audiences reaction to seeing him. It was following this event that Eric suffered his third, and fatal, heart attack, eventually succumbing early in the morning of 28th May, 1985.\n\nErnie, meanwhile had kept on working, returning to the stage. He also wrote his autobiography and became a regular guest on What’s My Line? and Countdown. After a number of health problems, Ernie officially announced his retirement from showbusiness on his 70th birthday, 27th November 1995. While enjoying his retirement in Florida, Ernie had two heart attacks which resulted in a triple bypass operation. He was later flown home and taken to Nuffield Hospital where, on 21st March, he passed away.\n\nThe legacy of Eric & Ernie is immeasurable. Countless comics and writers have followed, each learning from their extensive back catalogue of comedy. Much has been written about them in the years since, with most of the attention focussed on Eric while Ernie has been largely forgotten as one of the driving forces of the duo. Both were hugely talented, funny and much-loved by millions of viewers. Their sketches and gags have become part of the British way of life. How many of us hear a police siren and utter those immortal words: “He’s not going to sell much ice-cream going at that speed” or, indeed, imagine ourselves dancing along to The Stripper while making breakfast?\n\nMorecambe & Wise provided the world with pure family entertainment, a little bit of sunshine in our lives and a song in our hearts. It is testament that, over thirty years since their last television show went out, that they are still as big a part of the landscape as they ever were with repeats of their shows on at least every Christmas and countless stage plays and television dramas written about them, ensuring that their memories, and those of their shows, live on forever.\n\nTV Heroes: Morecambe & Wise\n\n“I’d like to thank all of you for watching me and my little show here tonight. If you’ve enjoyed it, then it’s all been worthwhile. So, until we meet again, good night, and I love you all!”\n\nMy Life In TV: Part Twenty Nine\n\nI fear the TV well may be drying up, the evidence of which you’ll find in these final two parts. This edition features a couple of classic kids’ programmes, a long-running quiz, big hair and shoulder pads and a definite whiff of cheese. Like I said in the previous edition, my feelings about My Life In TV… coming to an end are getting stronger so I suggest you soak it up, because it won’t last forever. Anyway, enough of this preamble, here’s your starter for ten…\n\nUNIVERSITY CHALLENGE (1962-present)\n\nThis is one of television’s most enduring quiz shows, starting life on ITV in 1962 where it was hosted by Bamber Gascoigne until 1987. The series was then revived by the BBC in 1994 with new host Jeremy Paxman asking the questions. The format itself is simple, even if some of the questions are not. Two teams of four university students battle it out, asking questions. “Starter” questions are asked individually on the buzzer and are worth ten points. This brought about the show’s most famous catchphrase “Your starter for 10” which, in turn, inspired a novel and 2006 film. Having never been to university and never really knowing an awful lot about anything, I find it amazing that I can actually answer quite a lot of the questions which, for me, is part of the fun.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Monkman!\n\nDYNASTY (1981-1989)\n\nDynasty was utter nonsense but it was joyous, escapist nonsense. Two feuding families, the Carringtons and the Colbys, oil-rich and prone to disaster, face-off against each other in a battle for superiority. John Forsythe, Linda Evans, Joan Collins and a host of big names from the world of classic Hollywood ham it up in stories of greed, betrayal, kidnapping, murder and the occasional cat fight! A spin-off series, The Colbys, followed in 1985 and was full of even more nonsense but didn’t have the same impact as this pure eighties kitsch.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Cat fight!\n\nPUDDLE LANE (1985-1989)\n\nAt 10, I was probably slightly too old for this magical children’s programme but I remember it fondly. Starring Neil Innes (Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) as a magician who, while living in a mansion at the end of Puddle Lane, tells stories about his neighbours using his magic cauldron. The main thing I remember about this show was the sing-song way the magician began his stories (a tune that is forever in my head). It was good fun and I wish it was repeated somewhere, I’d like to see it again!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: An episode from 1986\n\nDEAR JOHN (1986-1987)\n\nThis John Sullivan sitcom was originally planned to appear in the next edition but, following the sad news that actor Peter Blake (Kirk St. Moritz) had recently passed away, I thought it only right to bring it forward. As with most of Sullivan’s sitcoms, Dear John is primarily character based, most notably the eponymous John (played by the wonderful, and also much-missed Ralph Bates) who returns home one night to find a letter from his wife telling him that she is leaving him for a friend. John subsequently finds himself at a divorcee help group where he meets likeminded, social misfits like Kirk, Kate (Belinda Lang) and Ralph (Peter Denyer). It was heartfelt, brilliantly funny and deserves at least a repeat showing.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Kirk!\n\nT. BAG (1985-1992)\n\nHere’s one of those curious CITV programmes that I suspect a lot of people would refuse to admit to liking. Not me, I loved watching it. Its not until I started researching that I found out just how many series there were. It all started with Wonders in Letterland, where a young girl called Debbie (Jennie Stallwood) found herself sucked into a board game where she came up against the evil T. Bag (Elizabeth Estensen and, later, Georgina Hale) and her subordinate, T. Shirt (John Hasler). Originally planned as an educational show, the format shifted from the second series onwards into an adventure based show. Kellie Bright would take over heroine duties for the later series but I’ll admit that by this time I had begun watching less of it. It remains, though, one of those programmes that I remember with fondness for just being completely silly.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Series 5, episode 1\n\nHIGHWAY TO HEAVEN (1984-1989)\n\nIf you like your dramas full of sweet and saccharine then look no further than this product of American television. Starring Michael Landon (one of my mum’s favourites!) as a probationary angel, Johnathan Smith, sent back to earth to help people in need. Assisting Johnathan is Mark Gordon (Victor French) and embittered ex-cop who finds Johnathan walking along an empty highway and picks him up. The stories are pretty standard fare, dealing with ‘issues’ and promoting heavy moral themes but, for its time, this was easy-going TV. I seem to remember it being shown here on a Sunday evening and my mum never wanting to miss it. I found it recently on one of the Freeview channels and, honestly, it hasn’t aged well.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Intro\n\nKING ROLLO (1980)\n\nConsidering this animation only lasted for 13 episodes in 1980, it is still one of Britain’s best-loved of the genre. From David McKee, creator of Mr Benn, King Rollo follows the adventures of the said King, a childlike figure who relies on advice and assistance from his friends. Like Mr Benn, this series was narrated by Ray Brooks and was repeated for what seemed like forever on children’s television but has since disappeared from the schedules, which is a shame as I’d still watch it now!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode “The Bread”\n\nALF (1986-1990)\n\nIn the eighties, American television excelled in creating high-concept programmes such as this curious beast. ALF (Alien Life Form) follows a radio signal from earth and crash lands in the garage of the Tanner family. Like you do, the family take the alien into their lives and help shield him from the outside world. Its your usual fish-out-of-water fare with the odd culture shock thrown in for good measure. I do remember watching and enjoying this show but I fear, if I were to watch it again now, I would probably question my younger self!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles\n\nMOONDIAL (1988)\n\nIts hard to believe that this brilliant drama is now thirty years old! Doing what British television does best, this spooky show, based on the novel by Helen Cresswell, follows Minty (Siri Neal) who is staying with her aunt after her mother was injured in an accident. Minty spends her time wandering the grounds of a nearby mansion where she is drawn to a moondial that enables her to travel through time. First, travelling to the 19th century, she meets Tom (Tony Sands) a servant boy, and also to the 18th century to meet Sarah (Helena Avelleno). Both children appear to be in danger and in need of Minty’s help in this luscious and atmospheric supernatural slice of 80s drama.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Intro\n\nTHE YOUNG DOCTORS (1976-1983)\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I love a good Aussie soap opera. I could quite happily sit and watch a whole channel dedicated to them. This one is probably one of the first I remember watching and getting hooked on. Focussing on the lives, loves and everything in between of the staff and patients of Sydney’s Albert Memorial Hospital, this had drama, romance, humour and, of course, villains. None more so villainous than the delightfully evil Sister Scott (played by the late Cornelia Frances), who I seem to recall meeting her end at the bottom of a lift shaft! The sets were wobbly, the acting somewhat suspect but it was one of those programmes that you could pick up wherever you left off watching it last time.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The earworm-worthy theme tune!\n\nAnd there you go, another batch of television programmes that have made some sort of impact on me over the years. Some great, some…well, not so great, but you can’t have everything, can you? Please feel free to get in touch if you’ve liked what you’ve read or if you have any comments you’d like to make (keep ’em clean!), you can find me on Twitter, just follow the link on this page. The next edition will be part thirty and the (so far) final edition of My Life In TV… I’ve yet to make my mind up about bringing it back once the film side reaches 40 parts. That’s a way off yet, there’s still plenty more to come so, until next time…\n\n“…that’s the kind of guy I am”\n\nMy Life In TV: Part Twenty Eight\n\nThey think it’s all over…it is now! Well, the excitement of the FIFA World Cup is over and, although football didn’t come home (for England) we are on the home straight for this particular incarnation of My Life In TV… With just a couple of editions left before the movies take over again, I’m considering ‘resting’ it for a while and just concentrating on the films. Of course, I may change my mind once I post Part 30 so I wouldn’t pay too much attention to me! Anyway, that isn’t getting the job done, is it…?\n\nTHE FLYING DOCTORS (1986-1992)\n\nI’ve always been partial to an Australian drama and this one, shown here in the UK on a Saturday evening, was one of the better ones as well as being a favourite of my mum. Based in the small town of Cooper’s Crossing, the Royal Flying Doctors Service operates all across the outback, taking flight when the roads are almost non-existent. Full of familiar faces from previous Aussie soaps, The Flying Doctors combined the drama of medical emergencies with the humour of everyday life.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening / Closing Theme\n\n3-2-1 (1978-1987)\n\nThe mere mention of this quiz-game-entertainment show brings to mind the show’s booby prize, Dusty Bin; Ted Rogers‘ three-finger salute and, of course, the most baffling of clues. Based on a Spanish show (Uno Dos Tres), this staple of ITV’s Saturday night schedule ruled the airwaves. The show saw three couples slowly eliminated over the course of quiz rounds before the final showdown where a series of end-of-the-pier acts would perform before providing the contestants with unfathomable clues to the prizes which would include the booby prize that they would hope to avoid. The show ran out of steam in the mid-eighties and, sadly, Rogers’ career failed to live up to the heady heights of this behemoth.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode from 1981\n\nDES O’CONNOR TONIGHT (1977-2002)\n\nThis variety-style chat show, hosted by one of Britain’s most successful entertainers, Des O’Connor, originally aired on the BBC (1977-1982) before finding a home on ITV (1983-2002). Des was famous for his laid-back style of interviewing, and for his enthusiastic enjoyment of fellow comedians, often giving new comics their first taste of television. The show also became infamous after fellow comedian Stan Boardman told a joke about the German aircraft manufacturer, Focke-Wulf, but made it sound like a swear word. This resulted in a barrage of complaints and put an end to live broadcasts of the show until the 90s. ITV axed the show in 2002 and Des hosted the last edition on Christmas Eve of that year.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A chat with Joe Pasquale\n\nHART TO HART (1979-1984)\n\nTelevision loves a detective. What it also loves is an amateur detective and this show had two of them. Husband and wife team, Jonathan (Robert Wagner) and Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) Hart are self-made millionaires and often find themselves up to their necks in murder. Aided by their gravel-voiced butler, Max (Lionel Stander) and cuddly canine, Freeway, the Hart’s provided a loved up version of crime fighting that has long since been forgotten. When the series ended in 1984, a total of eight TV movies followed between 1993 and 1996.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Series intro\n\nTALES OF THE UNEXPECTED (1979-1988)\n\nWhile Roald Dahl is famous for bringing joy to children through his fantastical novels, he also managed to put a good deal of fear into the hearts of adults, too with this classic anthology series. Each week Dahl would be sat in his armchair next to the fireplace and introduce a story that would often involve a sinister twist at the end. Some of these stories, featuring some of the big named stars of the day, have lived on in viewers’ memories – I remember one particular story involving Elizabeth Spriggs, a rug and a polished floor – just as much as the show’s iconic theme tune, composed by Ron Grainer.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode\n\nGAME FOR A LAUGH (1981-1985)\n\nPractical jokes and pranks have long been a staple of Saturday night television over the years, and this one became one of the first of a new breed. Originally presented by Matthew Kelly, Henry Kelly, Sarah Kennedy and Jeremy Beadle, the show was pretty much a Candid Camera-style programme featuring elaborate pranks performed on unsuspecting members of the public. The four unlikely hosts would end each week with a twee catchphrase that they would say in turn in true light entertainment fashion.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: One of the pranks!\n\nTHE MOVIE GAME (1988-1995)\n\nHere’s one of the few kids TV quiz shows that I actually wanted to take part in. I’ve loved everything to do with film for as long as I can remember so this movie-based game show was right up my alley! Originally presented by Phillip Schofield, the show was later fronted by Jonathon Morris and John Barrowman. The format was pretty simple, three teams of two kids answer questions about films in order to win film-related prizes. I watched very little of it once Schofield left but I still hold it close to my heart, despite never applying to be on it!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A Barrowman episode!\n\nHAPPY DAYS (1974-1984)\n\nFor the first couple of seasons, Happy Days (created by Garry Marshall) was just an ordinary 1950s-set sitcom about an average family, the Cunningham’s – Howard (Tom Bosley), Marion (Marion Ross), Richie (Ron Howard) and Joanie (Erin Moran). But, due to failing audiences in the second series, the show was reworked to include more of the peripheral characters – Ralph (Don Most), Potsie (Anson Williams) and the iconic Arthur “Fonzie” Fonzirelli (Henry Winkler) – and it soon became America’s biggest hit. The show was responsible for spawning Mork and Mindy and made huge stars out of its cast.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles\n\nHILL STREET BLUES (1981-1987)\n\nThis ground breaking drama from creator Steven Bochco became one of televisions most-loved cop shows. A true ensemble piece, it follows the lives of a police precinct and all those who inhabit it. Gritty storylines and true-to-life characters you could invest your time in, Hill Street Blues blazed a trail for every cop drama that followed. Making household names out of its cast, the show was regularly nominated (and won) for Emmy’s and Golden Globes and with a theme tune by the prolific Mike Post, it is highly regarded as the benchmark for television drama.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Those iconic opening titles\n\nGRUEY (1988-1989)\n\nI’ll be honest, most of this programme has evaporated from my memory, only really existing due to its earworm of a theme tune. This kids show starred Kieran O’Brien as the Stephen “Gruey” Grucock who, along with his friends Wooly (Danny Collier) and Quidsy (Ayesha Husain) would get themselves into mischief and scrapes. Its been largely forgotten (not just by me) and I think its about time it found a new home on one of the many channels out there, or even on a DVD release.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Clip, featuring the end titles and theme\n\nWell, there you have it, better late than never. Another edition bites the dust and there were some truly interesting pieces of TV on offer this time, don’t you agree? Everything is now back on track so Part Twenty Nine will be here before you know it. In the meantime, if you’ve enjoyed what you’ve seen here today please do feel free to get in touch in the usual ways, I’d love to hear from you. Until next time…\n\n“Let’s be careful out there”\n\nTV Heroes: Mike Post\n\nThink of any of the big American television shows of the past forty-five years and, chances are, the theme tune was composed by Mike Post.\n\nBorn in San Fernando, California in 1944, Post’s music career began cutting demos, writing and producing songs for bands and singers in the sixties. Her first major breakthrough came at the age of 23 when he won his first Grammy for producing and arranging the Mason Williams instrumental hit ‘Classical Gas’. Later he played guitar on Sonny & Cher‘s ‘I Got You Babe’ as well as producing the first three albums for Kenny Rogers and the First Edition.\n\nHis television career got started when he was made musical director of The Andy Williams Show at the tender age of 24 this lead to another, albeit short-lived, assignment where he was introduced to Stephen J. Cannell. This meeting lead to Post’s first major hit as a composer, The Rockford Files. Not only was the show a success but the theme tune was played on the radio, made it into the charts and earned Post a second Grammy.\n\nPost often collaborated with Pete Carpenter on shows such as Rockford, Hardcastle & McCormick, Riptide, The Greatest American Hero, Hunter, Magnum PI and The A-Team. Their partnership continued until Carpenter’s death in 1987.\n\nPost won further Grammy awards for his themes to the hit drama shows Hill Street Blues and LA Law while Murder One became is his first Emmy win. He was also the go-to composer for Donald P. Bellisario, Steven Bochco and Stephen J. Cannell. Working with Dick Wolf, Post composed themes for the Law & Order franchise, including the iconic “dun-dun” sound.\n\nEven though some of the shows themselves have faded from memory, his themes for them have become as popular and well-known as those of the great composers, finding their way into our psyche and ensuring a legacy that will live on for generations to come.\n\nTV HEROES – MIKE POST\n\nMy Life In TV: Part Twenty Seven\n\nApologies for the lateness of this edition, I got swept up in the World Cup and neglected my duties. I’ll try not to let it happen again…maybe! That being said, its now time to take another trip down memory lane and revisit some of the television programmes that helped shape my square eyes. This time around we have out of this world animation, computer nerds, side glances to camera and a speedy superhero. Enough talk, we’ve got work to do…\n\nTHE LITTLEST HOBO (1979-1985)\n\nOne thing I didn’t realise until I started researching was that this was a remake of a 1963 series of the same name. Both shows are essentially the same, a wandering, homeless dog stops off from time to time in a different town to help the locals with whatever problems they’re having. As intelligent dogs go, Hobo was on a different level, always managing to solve crimes, fight off attackers and help those in need all without the aid of speech or opposable thumbs! The most memorable element of this show, though, has to be the catchy theme tune, “Maybe Tomorrow”, composed and sung by Terry Bush.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode!\n\nHARRY HILL’S TV BURP (2001-2012)\n\nTV Burp was one of the most successful and most mental television programmes in recent years. Fronted by Harry Hill, it took a look back at the week’s TV and pretty much ripped it to shreds, in a good way. Hill’s observations were likely to be the same that we, as the audience, were shouting at our tele every day. Featuring ‘TV Highlight of the Week’, ‘FIGHT!’, ‘Poetry Corner’ and the side-glance to camera, this was the show to watch every Saturday night. With all that’s on TV right now, its surely time for a return?\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode!\n\nSTIG OF THE DUMP (1981)\n\nI have very vague recollections of either reading this book, or having it read to me, while at primary school. I also have similar memories of this television adaptation starring Grant Warnock as Barney who, while at the local rubbish dump, discovers a teenage caveman, Stig (Keith Jayne). The two become friends, learning to communicate without talking, and begin to understand where each other comes from. It was remade in 2002 but this is the one that I remember.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: First part of the first episode\n\nLAND OF THE GIANTS (1968-1970)\n\nFrom producer extraordinaire, Irwin Allen, Land of the Giants came hot on the heels of Allen’s previous big hitter, Lost In Space. Here we find the crew of spaceship Spindrift get themselves lost in a strange cloud in space and land on an alternate version of Earth where the inhabitants are giants. Gary Conway and Don Matheson lead the cast that also features Don Marshall, Deanna Lund and Heather Young. My only memory of watching this is during the many repeat showings on Sunday afternoons where it was alternated with Lost In Space.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening theme (by John Williams)\n\nWACKY RACES (1968-1970)\n\nThe home of Dick Dastardly and Penelope Pitstop, Wacky Races is another slice of genius from Hanna-Barbera. A series of car races across America featuring some of the weirdest vehicles and driver combinations. Race rules are virtually non-existent but that’s beside the point. The joy of this cartoon comes from seeing Dastardly defeated by his stupidity and the other drivers. It holds a special place in my heart due to the fact that my first crush was on Penelope Pitstop!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles\n\nREMINGTON STEELE (1982-1987)\n\nStephanie Zimbalist stars as private eye Laura Holt who has to invent a fictitious boss in order to attract more clients. Pierce Brosnan enters her world as a nameless thief who assumes the identity of said boss and the two begin working together. I mostly remember this show for Brosnan but for the majority of the audience it was the sexual chemistry between the two leads. The show ran for five seasons – the fifth being shortened after Brosnan was virtually signed, sealed and delivered as the new James Bond only to have NBC order more episodes and thus diverting his fate for a few more years.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Series trailer\n\nBUTTON MOON (1980-1988)\n\nThe thing that amazed me most about Button Moon is just how many episode there were. I have been convinced for years that there had only been 12 and it was on a constant repeat cycle. I have since found out that there were significantly more than that made. Over 90 episodes of this children’s puppet show with a theme song written and performed by the then husband and wife team of Peter Davison and Sandra Dickinson. I seem to remember this showing alongside Rainbow on weekday lunchtimes as I would be able to walk home from primary school for my dinner, watch a bit of tele, and go back to school!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode!\n\nINSPECTOR GADGET (1983-1986)\n\nI used to love watching this cartoon. Inspector Gadget (voiced by Don Adams), an inept bionic police inspector bumbles his way through his cases while his niece and dog do all the real investigative work! While the stories themselves are largely forgotten, the thing about Gadget is, well, his gadgets. With a shout of “Go-go-gadget…” an array of tools would emerge from his coat to help aid his work. Add to that a cracking theme tune and you’ve got the perfect combination.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening theme tune!\n\nWHIZ KIDS (1983-1984)\n\nThis short-lived show could probably be filed under “ahead of its time” as it was right at the very start of the computer age as we know it. A group of computer hackers use their skills to work as amateur detectives. What’s not to love? Richie (Matthew Labyorteaux), Ham (Todd Porter), Jeremy (Jeffrey Jacquet) and Alice (Andrea Elson) were often assisted by news reporter, Llewellen Farley, Jr (Max Gail) in this sadly forgotten slice of American television.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Delightfully 80s opening titles!\n\nTHE FLASH (2014-present)\n\nNow I’m not the biggest fan of superheroes and comic books but I have to say that this show totally sucked me in right from the start. Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) is a police forensic scientist in Central City but, after being struck by lightning he wakes from a coma with super speed. With his new powers he sets out to find the man who killed his mother and, in turn, creates a whole heap of trouble along the way. With strong support from Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Tom Cavanagh and Jesse L. Martin, The Flash is one of the few superhero TV series that I actively sought out, binge-watching the first four seasons in just over two weeks!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Season one intro\n\nAnd there you have it, another edition bites the dust. Superheroes, space explorers and side-glances all combine to bring you a slice of my life in TV. I do hope you’ve enjoyed what you’ve seen here today, please feel free to get in touch (even if you haven’t enjoyed it, at least then I’ll know who to avoid *smiley face*) I’d love to hear from you. Hopefully the next edition won’t take as long (blame the World Cup!) but, rest assured, there’s still plenty more to come! Until next time…\n\n“Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on”\n\nMy Life In TV: Part Twenty Six\n\nPreviously on “My Life In…”\n\nThis whole thing began in May 2014 when I decided to compile my very own list of favourite movies. This was swiftly followed in the August of that year by the very first My Life In TV… I only take you down this brief memory lane for it has occurred to me that this very post, Part 26 of my televisual odyssey, is my 100th post in total on this blog. A blog that began in 2012, very simply, as a means for me to share my poetry and the odd piece of longer-form writing. The fact that the Film and TV side of things has taken over has become somewhat of a personal albatross paradox. A burden that I detest and love in equal measures. Its one of those things that I really wish I hadn’t started but at the same time, can’t imagine not completing…if there ever will be a completion! That’s not on my radar at the moment, though, there’s still plenty of work to do in the meantime…\n\nDASTARDLY AND MUTTLEY IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES (1969-1970)\n\nDick Dastardly and his canine sidekick, Muttley are now World War I flying aces who, along with the Vulture Squad, try and fail to stop Yankee Doodle Pigeon from delivering messages to the enemy. A spin-off from Wacky Races, this was a completely silly Hanna-Barbera cartoon that owes much to the relationship between Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote. A smart bird evades capture from a bunch of inept idiots. The show is usually known as either Catch The Pigeon or Stop The Pigeon, probably due to its extremely earworm-worthy theme tune “Stop The Pigeon” that I guarantee you won’t get out of your head for days!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Sorry…Theme Tune!\n\nBRUSH STROKES (1986-1991)\n\nKarl Howman plays Jacko, a painter and decorator with an eye for the women. He likes them and they always seem to like him, too. Will he ever find his true love, though? Written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, the men behind The Good Life, Brush Strokes followed in the tradition of British sitcoms with a loveable rogue at the helm. Mike Walling, Gary Waldhorn and the late Howard Lew Lewis co-starred in one of the last of the ‘classic’ British comedies.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Theme tune – Because Of You by Dexys Midnight Runners\n\nAMAZING STORIES (1985-1987)\n\nSteven Spielberg presents a series of truly fantastical and, indeed, amazing stories that form the basis for this anthology series. In much the same vein as The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, each episode is a standalone story. Each week a cast of established actors would appear alongside a roster of young, up-and-coming stars. The stories themselves were usually of the fantasy variety that Spielberg had made his own mixed with supernatural and mystical elements. Cutting edge filming techniques and animation were used in this wonderfully offbeat series that really does deserve a repeat viewing.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening credits\n\nSMALL WONDER (1985-1989)\n\nThe Americans always seemed to do these extremely off-the-wall sitcoms very well. This bizarre show was one of the weirdest. A robotics engineer creates a robot modelled on a little girl and then tries to pass her off as an adoptive daughter. Dick Christie, Marla Pennington and Jerry Supiran star as the family with Tiffany Brissette as Vicki, the small wonder of the title. I have very vague memories of watching it and only really remember it for the robot storyline anyway. Definitely one for the “What on earth?” category!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles with traditionally cheesy theme song!\n\nWHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? (1988-1998)\n\nActors and comedians perform improvised sketches based on suggestions from the studio audience. In true parlour game fashion, and hosted by Clive Anderson, this show was a huge hit on Channel 4 back in the day and proved a fertile ground for either fledgling or established performers. Tony Slattery, Josie Lawrence, Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops to name just a few who became household names. I always remember it being so funny and, because of the improvisational nature of the show, quite erratic and manic which only added to the hilarity.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode\n\nLIGHT LUNCH (1997-1998)\n\nBefore they were queens of the Bake Off (and before they ruined The Generation Game!) Mel & Sue hosted their own daytime show. Light Lunch was a live, cookery-cum-chat show that was the perfect vehicle for this comedic pair. Featuring top chefs and celebrity guests, Light Lunch soon evolved and was replaced by Late Lunch (1998-1999) keeping much the same format only for an early evening timeslot. Complete with a house band (“Steve, Matt, Dylan and Dan!”) that had a different pun-related name each episode, Light/Late Lunch was unmissable for me. Its just a shame that Mel & Sue haven’t been able to replicate this magic in their other shows.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode from 1997!\n\nGENTLE BEN (1967-1969)\n\nEven though this programme was made in the sixties, it became a staple of British television in the eighties when it was shown as part of the BBC’s children’s television output. Following the adventures of a Florida Everglades game warden, Tom Wedloe (Dennis Weaver), his wife Ellen (Beth Brickell), their young son Mark (Clint Howard) and Mark’s tame bear, Ben. Gentle Ben was always on our screens, usually during the school holidays and was one of those very family-friendly shows that TV just can’t seem to get right these days.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles\n\nCHALLENGE ANNEKA (1987-1995)\n\nMost of the television programmes today that focus on completing a massive project in a limited amount of time have much to thank this show for. Challenge Anneka (created and presented by Anneka Rice) would see Rice given a task to complete, usually within only a matter of days, and would then have to convince local businesses to take part for free. The projects were mostly for a charitable cause and would often get the local community involved. It was such a great programme to watch, not only for Rice’s enthusiasm but also for the drama of getting the thing done in time. The show was revived by ITV in 2006 for two specials with an eye to produce more, but subsequent ideas were scrapped.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode\n\nWYCLIFFE (1994-1998)\n\nSet in the glorious surroundings of Cornwall, this police drama was one of my mum’s favourites. Not only for the scenery but I think she was rather taken by Jack Shepherd, who played the eponymous detective. As British cop shows go, Wycliffe is one of the more subdued and cerebral. It is very much about the solving of the crime, the knowledge of the detectives and, of course, the gorgeous scenery. One of the things that stands out for me, though, will always be the haunting theme tune that will sometimes creep into my head when I least expect it!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles\n\nTHE BANANA SPLITS ADVENTURE HOUR (1968-1970)\n\nThis was trippy! The Banana Splits were a fictional rock band made up of four furry animals (Fleegle, Bingo, Drooper & Snorky) who would host live-action and animated features amid their own sitcom-like show. The live-action serial Danger Island, was shown along with cartoons of Arabian Knights and The Three Musketeers, with the all the live-action stuff being directed by Richard Donner. It was fast, offbeat, psychedelic and completely bonkers. With a theme tune that fit the manic nature of the show, The Banana Splits has since become one of a long line of cult kids’ TV shows.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: That fabulous opening/closing theme tune!\n\nThere you have it, blog post 100 and Part 26 of my television odyssey. I think you’ll agree there are a couple of fine entries here as well as the weird and wonderful. If you’ve enjoyed what you’ve seen here today, please feel free to get in touch I’d love to hear from you. Here’s to the next 100 posts and, hopefully, some more weird and wonderful TV programmes from days gone by! Until the next time…\n\n“Nab him, jab him, tab him, grab him…”"
