However, when they arrive there, they become unwittingly involved in a jewel theft when the thief Le Pirate decides to use them to smuggle some precious jewels out of the country. He sends the two Englishmen to a sinister villa and sends the beautiful Claudette, a member of his criminal gang, to keep Eric and Ernie occupied while he carries out the various stages of his plan. Confusion ensues however, as the two battle for the affections of Claudette and Eric accidentally wins a large sum of money at a casino. Eventually Eric and Ernie start to get suspicious and begin to investigate...\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nEric Morecambe as Eric Simpson\n\nErnie Wise as Ernest Clark\n\nSuzanne Lloyd as Claudette\n\nPaul Stassino as Le Pirate\n\nArmand Mestral as Inspector Duval\n\nGerald Lawson as Coco\n\nGeorge Eugeniou as Marcel\n\nGeorge Pastell as Ali\n\nAlexandra Bastedo as girl at roulette table\n\nNicole Shelby as woman in casino\n\nPeter Jeffrey as Mauron\n\nFrancis Matthews as hotel manager\n\nMichael Forrest as Pierre\n\nPaul Danquah as Hassim\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film opened at the Leicester Square Theatre in the West End of London on 24 March 1966.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Diamond-sharp photography by Otto Heller, an appealing performance by Suzanne Lloyd, and an excellent little character sketch by George Eugeniou as a bizarre gang-member. Otherwise this is a dismal affair of antediluvian comic routines â€“ strictly for hardened Morecambe and Wise fans.\"[2]\n\nThe Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: \"Morecambe and Wise head for the south of France in what starts out looking like a customised remake of the old Laurel and Hardy comedy Saps at Sea. But Eric and Ernie's regular writers, Sid Green and Dick Hills, quickly run into the problem that blighted all three of their movies; the pair's relaxed, intimate style might have been perfect for the sketch format of their TV show, but it was totally wrong for sustaining narratives. Few laughs.\"[3]\n\nLeslie Halliwell said: \"Disappointing star comedy ending in a surfboard chase.\"[4]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nThat Riviera Touch was among the 15 most popular films at the British box office in 1966.[5] Hugh Stewart says that due to rising costs and the fact the film did not do well in America, however, it barely got its costs back.[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
