        "text": "Chelsea vs. Leicester City : 17 March 2024.\n\nThis was another weekend where I was able to attend two games of football.\n\nI spent the fiftieth anniversary – to the hour – of my ever first Chelsea game at Badgers Hill, the quaintly-named ground of Frome Town, for the league game with Yate Town. I met up with Francis and Tom in a local hostelry and we enjoyed a power-hour of conversation about not only the Robins but top-level football too. It was a real “State Of The Nation” chit-chat. With a promotion charge taking place for my local team, I admitted how annoyed I am when I discover that I can’t attend a Frome game as I am otherwise engaged with Chelsea.\n\nIn the ground, I met up with a few other pals; the ever-present Steve, plus Glenn from Chelsea, who was with Neil from Chelsea too. I liked the look of the crowd as soon as I walked in. Frome have averaged around 440 this season; this seemed a lot more. We watched from the Cow Shed along the side of the pitch as the home team dominated possession but were limited to a few chances in a frustrating first-half.\n\nWe decamped to the club end for the second-half and the visitors came into it a little. Manager Danny Greaves made some fine tweaks and it paid off as two good strikes from James Ollis and Kane Simpson gave Frome the points. The gate was a hefty 571. It was a solid performance; gritty, physical, but with quality where it counted. The only negative was hearing that leaders Wimborne Town had nicked a late 2-1 win at Malvern Town. However, if we win all of our remaining eight games – three at home, five away – we will be automatically promoted. The away game at Wimborne on Saturday 20 April could be pivotal. On that day, Chelsea are due to play at Brighton in the league or at Wembley in an FA Cup Semi-Final. Let’s see how that pans out.\n\nI enjoyed the Saturday evening, basting a little in the glory of another fine Frome win, but my thoughts soon turned to the Sunday game; our FA Cup Quarter Final at home to Leicester City.\n\nBut my mind also wandered to those first fifty-years of match-going Chelsea support. It took my fancy during the week, thinking of the number fifty, to attempt to compile a list of my favourite fifty games from that period. That Saturday night I finished it all off. Of the 1,438 games I had seen, at first I narrowed it down to an initial list of sixty. Then came the final cull, swiping left on ten games. I include the list, the final fifty, at the end of this piece. It’s impossible to rate them in order of preference, so they are in chronological order instead.\n\nFavourite games are not necessarily the greatest games, and not every single piece of silverware is listed, but these fifty games are the ones that leave a lingering feeling of warmth and appreciation.\n\nThe Sunday game was to kick-off early at 12.45pm. I was up at 5.45am, and left Frome at 7am. We were parked up in Hammersmith by 9.20am. After a breakfast at “The Full Moon Café” on the Fulham Palace Road, we met up with others at “The Old Oak” on the North End Road. The reason for this was two-fold. Firstly, we were hoping that Alan would be making a reappearance at this game after an enforced absence of over two months due to ill-health. If so, he would surely be in this boozer.\n\nSecondly, the pub is to close very soon, and the property will make way for flats. I think it has a week left. This would only be my fourth visit over the years. It seemed right to make a final visit.\n\nI dropped the lads off outside and spun back to park up. When I walked in a few minutes later, I was so pleased to see Alan sitting at a table opposite Gary. He slowly got up and we hugged. We have all missed him so much.\n\nOh, there was a third reason; the pub opened at 10am.\n\nA few other folks arrived; firstly, Salisbury Steve, then Andy and Sophie, Neil and Nigel, all from Nuneaton. There was a brief chat with Huddersfield Mick.\n\nAs we left the pub at about midday, Andy was muttering disparaging things about the folk from Leicester, just up the road from him in the East Midlands.\n\n“Let’s go and see the knicker makers.”\n\nThere were around six thousand visitors from Leicestershire in town for this cup tie. Sophie mentioned that as they spun around the Hammersmith roundabout, she had spotted that a few police vans were parked outside “The William Morris” pub, no doubt keeping a close watch on a section of the away fans as they neared Stamford Bridge.\n\nThere was a loud group of them exiting from the guts of the Fulham Broadway tube complex at about 12.15pm too. I noted a large police presence outside the West Stand on the Fulham Road. I soon made my way in. I stopped to take a “welcome home” photo of Alan with PD and Parky in The Sleepy Hollow and then made my way to my single seat, almost behind the goal in the MHU.\n\nThe team was announced.\n\nSanchez\n\nGusto – Disasi – Chalobah – Cucarella\n\nCaicedo – Gallagher\n\nMudryk – Palmer – Sterling\n\nJackson\n\nBefore the game began, I had realised that I had left my glasses in the car. Added to the fact that Leicester City had chosen to wear an all-black away kit, it was a little difficult to tell the two sets of players apart. I struggled for the first few minutes before my eyes got to grips with it all.\n\nThere were a few early barbs from the away supporters aimed at the Chelsea sections.\n\n“Football in a library.”\n\n“Ben Chilwell – he sits on the bench.”\n\nI felt like muttering “apart from when he wins European Cups” but I wasn’t in the mood.\n\nThe visitors began the brighter and an effort went ridiculously close to the right-hand upright of the goal right down below me.\n\n“Ooooooooh.”\n\nAt The Shed End, there was a flicked-effort by Cole Palmer from a corner that was kept out by Jakub Stolarczyk at the Shed End.\n\nOn thirteen minutes, a really strong run by Nicholas Jackson on our right went deep into the Foxes’ penalty area. He had the beating of the last man, Jannik Vestergaard, and also the awareness to spot the unmarked Marc Cucarella at the far post. The low cross was perfect, the finish from the left-back was clinical.\n\nChelsea 1 Leicester City 0.\n\nIt was a perfect start.\n\nWe needed to be wary of the away team on the counter-attack and they threatened on a couple of occasions. The ever-alert Cucarella was able to head away a couple of over-hit crosses at the far post.\n\nI spotted Jackson signal to Axel Disasi to play him through – great awareness, great movement – but I growled with displeasure as his request was ignored. The ball went square yet again…\n\nOn twenty-five minutes, just as Raheem Sterling was about to take aim at goal from a central position in the box, his legs were unceremoniously taken from under him by Abdul Fatawu. It was a clear penalty.\n\nWe waited for Palmer to take control of the situation, but to our surprise it was Sterling who placed the ball on the spot. My thoughts were along the lines of Sterling needing a goal, so the penalty was gifted to him.\n\nIt was a terrible penalty, the central shot kicked away with ease by Stolarcyck.\n\nBollocks.\n\nWell, that did nothing for Sterling’s confidence.\n\nWe kept going. A strong shot from Mykhailo Mudryk was parried. On forty-five minutes, Sterling was through, one on one, with only the ‘keeper to beat. Alas, his shot did not hit the target, instead it missed the right-hand post by yards rather than feet and inches. The crowd howled at the enormity of the miss.\n\nThere was redemption immediately after. Sterling created space on the left and his perfect cross was nimbly pushed home by Palmer.\n\nChelsea 2 Leicester City 0.\n\nCoasting.\n\nConor Gallagher let fly just before the break but his curling effort went just wide of the far post. I had been impressed with Mudryk in the first-half, not always potent going forward, but showing a much greater desire to put opponents under pressure, to close space, to tackle. There was a lot more energy from him.\n\nHe began the second-half with a fine bursting run.\n\nOn fifty-minutes, with Leicester City attacking their fans in The Shed, Disasi made a brilliantly-timed sliding tackle on a forward. Sadly, just seconds later the same defender, under pressure from Patson Daka, completely over hit a back-pass to Robert Sanchez. The ball always looked like dropping into the open net.\n\nChelsea 2 Leicester City 1.\n\nFackinell.\n\nJackson broke away but hit the side netting to my left. Moises Caicedo’s strike was saved. But the gifted goal had given Leicester a lifeline and it felt like they had the bit between their teeth.\n\nOn sixty-two minutes, Stephy Mavididi danced away as he cut inside the Chelsea penalty box.\n\n“Put a tackle in.”\n\nThe Leicester player shimmied and drove a fine effort into the Chelsea goal.\n\nChelsea 2 Leicester City 2.\n\nFackinell.\n\nShots, both over, from Palmer and Mudryk.\n\nOn seventy-minutes, a strong run from Jackson ended with a challenge on the edge of the box by Callum Doyle. At first the referee seemed to signal a penalty. Then VAR stepped in. No penalty, but a free-kick on the edge of the box instead. But Doyle was off. Advantage Chelsea? Maybe.\n\nBut first we had the free-kick. There was the usual delay as the away team sorted out a wall, then made a substitution. We then we focussed on Palmer and Sterling, both seeming to want the ball.\n\nWe waited.\n\nPalmer did not move.\n\nSterling strode forward.\n\nHis effort sailed ridiculously high and ridiculously wide.\n\nI cupped the back of my head in my hands and turned to look away from the pitch in disbelief. Everyone behind me was equally as flabbergasted.\n\nGood grief.\n\nThere were immediate boos.\n\nOn seventy-six minutes, Carney Chukwuemeka replaced Mudryk, and there were more boos. However, Mudryk was then clapped off by the home fans, especially those in the East Lower when he walked past them. He was warmly hugged by the manager.\n\nOn eighty minutes, ten minutes from the end of the game, I can honestly say that I heard the first real bone-crunching, lung-bursting, ear-piercing song from the Chelsea faithful.\n\n“Chowlsea – Chowlsea – Chowlsea – Chowlsea – Chowlsea, Chowlsea, Chowlsea.”\n\nEighty fucking minutes.\n\nSterling was booed when he had the ball.\n\nMy heart slumped.\n\nPathetic.\n\nEveryone knows my thoughts about supporters…er…supporting.\n\nThe substitute Chukwuemeka went close with a curling shot that strayed past the post.\n\nWe penned Leicester in to the final third, even the final quarter of the pitch, but space was at a premium. Malo Gusto had been neat all of the way through the game and his confidence grows with each appearance. Some of his flicks under pressure were lovely.\n\nWe kept going. On eighty-three minutes, Noni Madueke replaced Sterling. There were boos; not for the substitution, but for Sterling.\n\nI spotted many, though, in the MHU who were stood and clapped him off.\n\nThis warmed me a little.\n\nBad day at the office? Oh yes. But he didn’t deserve the level of nastiness aimed towards him – “Get him off, get him off, get him off!” – in that second-half.\n\nA few late chances came and went. Jackson flashed over from close-in.\n\nWhere was Erland Johnsen when we needed him?\n\nOn ninety minutes, Ben Chilwell replaced Cucarella.\n\nThe Bloke Next To Me : “Please score, Chilwell.”\n\nOur dominance continued as eight minutes of injury time were announced. It was quite a sight to see Carney and Ben doubling-up on one attack down the left.\n\nOn ninety-two minutes, Carney found a little space and cut in. The ball was played to Palmer. I expected him to set up Gallagher, but he took us all by surprise. Palmer back-heeled the ball perfectly into the path of Chukwuemeka who pushed the ball home.\n\nGET IN.\n\nChelsea 3 Leicester City 2.\n\nThe place was alive at last.\n\nOn ninety-eight minutes, it was the turn of the second substitute, Madueke, to set the place alight. A fine dribble into the central area, a couple of step overs, and then a lofted curler into the top corner, right in line with yours truly.\n\nChelsea 4 Leicester City 2.\n\nI managed to catch bits of the manic celebrations from the two late goals on film.\n\nWe made it, we’re off to Wembley yet again.\n\nI walked back to the car and caught up with PD and Parky. The traffic was light and I was back home by 6pm, a very early finish to the day.\n\nThe weekend had been a success; a pleasing league win from my twenty-seventh Frome Town game of the season and a last-gasp win in the cup from my thirty-ninth Chelsea game of the season.\n\nWe now have a break – no Chelsea game for a fortnight, no Frome Town game for even longer – as winter turns to spring.\n\nSee you on the other side.\n\nFifty Favourite Games :\n\n4 March 1978 : Chelsea 3 Liverpool 1 – First Division.\n\n25 October 1980 : Chelsea 6 Newcastle United 0 – Second Division.\n\n13 February 1982 : Chelsea 2 Liverpool 0 – FA Cup.\n\n27 August 1983 : Chelsea 5 Derby County 0 – Second Division.\n\n22 November 1983 : Chelsea 4 Newcastle United 0 – Second Division.\n\n10 March 1984 : Newcastle United 1 Chelsea 1 – Second Division.\n\n31 March 1984 : Cardiff City 3 Chelsea 3 – Second Division.\n\n28 April 1984 : Chelsea 5 Leeds United 0 – Second Division.\n\n25 August 1984 : Arsenal 1 Chelsea 1 – First Division.\n\n1 December 1984 : Chelsea 3 Liverpool 1 – First Division.\n\n9 April 1986 : Manchester United 1 Chelsea 2 – First Division.\n\n13 September 1986 : Tottenham Hotspur 1 Chelsea 3 – First Division.\n\n18 March 1989 : Manchester City 2 Chelsea 3 – Second Division.\n\n1 February 1992 : Liverpool 1 Chelsea 2 – First Division.\n\n3 November 1994 : Austria Memphis 1 Chelsea 1 – European Cup Winners’ Cup.\n\n14 March 1995 : Chelsea 2 Club Brugge 0 – European Cup Winners’ Cup.\n\n26 January 1997 : Chelsea 4 Liverpool 2 – FA Cup.\n\n17 May 1997 : Chelsea 2 Middlesbrough 0 – FA Cup.\n\n16 April 1998 : Chelsea 3 Vicenza 1 – European Cup Winners’ Cup.\n\n13 May 1998 : Chelsea 1 Stuttgart 0 – European Cup Winners’ Cup.\n\n3 October 1999 : Chelsea 5 Manchester United 0 – Premier League.\n\n5 April 2000 : Chelsea 3 Barcelona 1 – Champions League.\n\n13 March 2002 : Chelsea 4 Tottenham Hotspur 0 – Premier League.\n\n11 May 2003 : Chelsea 2 Liverpool 1 – Premier League.\n\n8 March 2005 : Chelsea 4 Barcelona 2 – Champions League.\n\n30 April 2005 : Bolton Wanderers 0 Chelsea 2 – Premier League.\n\n11 March 2006 : Chelsea 2 Tottenham Hotspur 1 – Premier League.\n\n29 April 2006 : Chelsea 3 Manchester United 0 – Premier League.\n\n3 April 2008 : Chelsea 3 Liverpool 2 : Champions League.\n\n10 March 2009 : Juventus 2 Chelsea 2 – Champions League.\n\n8 April 2009 : Liverpool 1 Chelsea 3 – Champions League.\n\n14 April 2009 : Chelsea 4 Liverpool 4 – Champions League.\n\n3 April 2010 : Manchester United 1 Chelsea 2 – Premier League.\n\n2 May 2010 : Liverpool 0 Chelsea 2 : Premier League.\n\n9 May 2010 : Chelsea 8 Wigan Athletic 0 – Premier League.\n\n14 March 2012 : Chelsea 4 Napoli 1 – Champions League.\n\n15 April 2012 : Chelsea 5 Tottenham Hotspur 1 – FA Cup.\n\n18 April 2012 : Chelsea 1 Barcelona 0 – Champions League.\n\n24 April 2012 : Barcelona 2 Chelsea 2 – Champions League.\n\n19 May 2012 : Chelsea 1 Bayern Munich 1 (won 4-3 pens) – Champions League.\n\n27 April 2014 : Liverpool 0 Chelsea 2 – Premier League.\n\n1 March 2015 : Chelsea 2 Tottenham Hotspur 0 – League Cup.\n\n2 May 2016 : Chelsea 2 Tottenham Hotspur 2 – Premier League.\n\n23 October 2016 : Chelsea 4 Manchester United 0 – Premier League.\n\n5 November 2016 : Chelsea 5 Everton 0 – Premier League.\n\n3 December 2016 : Manchester City 1 Chelsea 3 – Premier League.\n\n22 April 2017 : Chelsea 4 Tottenham Hotspur 2 – FA Cup.\n\n12 May 2017 : West Bromwich Albion 0 Chelsea 1 – Premier League.\n\n29 May 2019 : Chelsea 4 Arsenal 1 – Europa League.\n\n29 May 2021 : Chelsea 1 Manchester City 0 – Champions League.\n\nAston Villa vs. Chelsea : 7 February 2024.\n\nWe weren’t expecting much from this FA Cup replay at Villa Park. Why would we be? In our previous two games we had conceded eight goals. There was, in fact, a real worry that we would become unstuck on a mighty scale.\n\nI had worked an early shift, collected Paul and PD at 2.20pm, and then headed north. We stopped off at “The Vine” at West Bromwich at about 4.30pm. Our modus operandi was that if we were travelling over one hundred miles to watch a football game that we would probably lose, we had best find our fun elsewhere. The three curries, as always, went down a treat.\n\nAt around 6.45pm, I dropped the lads off as close to Villa Park that I could get and then double-backed on myself to park up. The plan was to walk all of the way around the stadium to take a selection of wide-angled photographs of the stands and to try to capture the essence of a midweek cup tie.\n\nVilla Park, eh?\n\nThis is a ground that became synonymous with FA Cup semi-finals before the FA took the unfortunate step to host all semis at the new Wembley Stadium. We have played a few semis at Villa Park over the years dating back to our first one, a win, against Everton in 1915. There was then a long gap of fifty years followed by three games in quick succession. We then lost to Liverpool in 1965 and Sheffield Wednesday in 1966 before defeating Leeds United in 1967.\n\nHowever, my first viewing of an FA Cup tie at Villa Park took place in early 1987. I travelled down to Birmingham with two mates from college in Stoke; Bob, Leeds United, and Steve, Derby County. I remember we posed for a photo outside the famous steps of the Trinity Road but the weather was too overcast and my camera was too cheap for the photo to be worth sharing. I had visited Villa Park for a tedious 0-0 draw in November 1986, but this cup tie was a great match. We had about 5,000 fans in a 21,997 crowd on the low terrace behind the goal and in the seats of the old Witton Lane Stand. We watched from the seats. We went 1-0 up in the first-half via John Bumstead but Villa equalised with twenty minutes to go via Neale Cooper. David Speedie then put us ahead on eighty-six minutes only for Steve Hunt to equalise again. We would win the replay at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThat game in 1987 was our last FA Cup tie against Villa on their home patch. However, we would play two semi-finals at Villa Park within six years during the Glenn Hoddle to Claudio Ranieri era.\n\nIn 1996, we assembled at Villa Park for the game against Manchester United. We were allocated the old Trinity Road Stand and three-quarters of the Holte End. Luckily, we had seats in the very front row of the upper tier of the Holte End, and I decided to take advantage of this position by creating a flag in honour of Ruud Gullit that I could drape over the balcony. Although the great man himself headed us into the lead in the first-half, United came back to win 2-1 with two goals in quick succession a quarter of an hour into the second-half via Andy Cole and David Beckham.\n\nIn 2002, our semi-final against Fulham was to be played at Highbury but our opponents took umbrage that the split of the 38,000 tickets at Arsenal’s stadium slightly favoured ourselves. They demanded that the game should be played at a stadium that allowed more equal allocations. Lo and behold, the two clubs from West London were forced to decamp to Birmingham on a Sunday evening with the game kicking-off at a ridiculous 7pm. I travelled up with a car load from Frome and we enjoyed a lengthy pre-match in the “Crown And Cushion” pub at Perry Barr. This pre-match is notable for the first-ever photo of Parky and myself together. We watched in the noisy upper tier of the North Stand as a John Terry goal just before half-time sent us to Wembley. The irony is that the attendance was only 36,147 and Fulham – of course – did not sell all of their tickets.\n\n“Thanks, then.”\n\nI took a few photographs on the walk through to the away end. Three police vans were parked on the roundabout near the Witton train station. Emiliano Buendia drove past in his car and some Villa fans close by went all weak at the knees. Amidst the throng of match-goers, a chap stood in the middle of Witton Lane with a “God Is Love” placard. I took outside shots of three of the stands but I did not fancy the trot down to the Holte End on this occasion. Time was moving on and I wanted to get inside to join up with the lads. I could sense an air of buoyancy amidst the home fans.\n\n“The Giant Is Awake” is the current tagline at Villa Park and I suppose they have a point. They are playing their best stuff in years.\n\nI was inside at about 7.30pm. As I spoke to a few fellow travellers in the concourse and in the seating area of the away section, nobody was confident.\n\nI took my seat alongside the lads. We were towards the back of the lower tier and it was a decent view. Chelsea were given 6,298 tickets for this game as opposed to the standard 3,000 for league matches. It seemed that a fair few were going spare if the announcements on social media were a clue. I just hoped that there weren’t large swathes of gaps in our section. I soon realised that the split was around 3,000 in the usual areas of the Witton Lane / Doug Ellis but with around 3,300 in the top tier of the North Stand to our right.\n\nThere were occasional empty seats but this was a magnificent effort from our supporters. While the dynamics have changed – for the worse, for the worse – at home games, thank God that the football calendar can occasionally throw up an occasion like this where the bedrock of the club can get a chance to follow the team en masse.\n\nThe minutes ticked by.\n\nThere were a few rock anthems as the 8pm kick-off approached. Surprisingly, “Hi Ho Silver Lining” was aired – as it was at Wolves – but then “Crazy Train” by Ozzy Osbourne took over as the teams were spotted in the off-centre tunnel.\n\nVilla then overdid it a bit. Not only were there plumes of smoke by the tunnel, but flames all along the pitch by the Doug Ellis Stand and – fackinell – fireworks in the sky above the stadium.\n\nNot to worry, the six thousand Chelsea fans had a response.\n\n“CAREFREE!”\n\nOn a serious note, all of this manufactured noise before kick-off might well look good on TV and it might excite children, but the problem is that it doesn’t allow for atmospheres to sizzle along nicely resulting in a crackling crescendo of noise – self-generated – at kick-off. Maybe those days are gone forever.\n\nSigh.\n\nOur team? No Thiago Silva. No Raheem Sterling.\n\nPetrovic\n\nGusto – Disasi – Badiashile – Chilwell\n\nGallagher – Caicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Palmer – Jackson\n\nThere were a few mumbles and grumbles about the starting positions of Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson, but – noticeably – nobody was bemoaning the absence of Raheem Sterling.\n\nOK. Everyone stood. Not many gaps in the immediate area. A few late-comers. Many familiar faces. I still wasn’t confident, but here we go. I tried to juggle photographs with shouts and applause for the team.\n\n“CAM ON YOU BLUE BOYS.”\n\nThe Chelsea players formed a pre-match huddle, and while they waited for captain Ben Chilwell to join them, I spotted Cole Palmer looking over at the Chelsea support in the Doug Ellis Stand. He seemed to be in awe :\n\n“Bloody hell, they have turned up tonight alright. There’s thousands behind the goal too.”\n\nHowever, not all parts of Villa Park were full. I soon spotted hundreds of central seats in the executive areas opposite not being used. That was just odd.\n\nSoon into the game, with Villa attacking our end, a long cross found Alex Moreno unmarked at the far post, but rather than attempt an effort himself he decided to head the ball back across the six-yard box. A defensive head cleared.\n\nIt was a lively start to the game with Chelsea breaking with speed and intensity. Malo Gusto linked with Noni Madueke and worked the ball in to Palmer inside the Villa box at the Holte End. His shot was an easy take for Emiliano Martinez.\n\nThere was a header, shortly after, from Enzo but his compatriot Martinez easily fielded this effort too.\n\nOn eleven minutes, we won the ball out on our left. I stood on tip-toes to watch the move develop. Inside to Conor Gallagher who spread the ball into the path of Jackson. He ran and ran, and played a low ball towards Madueke. Although surrounded by Villa defenders, he wisely took a touch before knocking it back into the path of Gallagher. The shot rose steeply but we erupted when the net rippled.\n\nPandemonium.\n\nBodies and limbs everywhere. I had no hope of taking a shot of the players celebrating away in the corner.\n\nWe were winning. Fackinell.\n\nI was so aware that Conor’s lack of goals is often cited by many as a major-downside. So I was doubly happy that the goal came from him. Lovely.\n\nVilla came into the game but Djordje Petrovic thwarted their couple of attempts on goal including an angled volley from Ollie Watkins.\n\nWe continued to purr. On twenty-one minutes, Disasi found Madueke in tons of space. He turned and pushed the ball wide into the over-lapping Malo Gusto. His cross into the box – a relatively low trajectory – was met by the leap of Jackson. His angled effort crashed into the goal.\n\nWe were 2-0 up, oh my bloody goodness.\n\nI saw the players celebrating through the forest of arms but I managed to cajole a photo or two out of my camera.\n\nThe away support boomed as we continued to dominate. I was really shocked by the lack of noise coming from the home areas though.\n\nNothing. I heard nothing at all.\n\nWe, not surprisingly full of it. However, songs about Willian, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Cesc Fabregas? Really? Save those for the last five minutes of games when we are winning 4-0 plus please. The Willian one was a real shocker.\n\nI took great pleasure in seeing Enzo get more and more involved. Just two examples of his play; the first a cushioned control of the ball with his instep that screamed quality, the second, a first-time transfer of the play from left wing to right wing that told me that he was full of confidence.\n\nAlongside him, Moises Caicedo was enjoying his best game for us, adeptly swatting Villa breaks, tacking hard, turning and passing. And then Gallagher, a one-man search-and-destroy unit, full of energy and running. It was a very fluid and powerful midfield indeed.\n\nThe natives were restless and I was loving it.\n\nChilwell, finding himself on the right, moved inside and unleashed a shot that whizzed just past the near post.\n\nOn thirty-three minutes, Madueke hugged the far touchline as he accelerated away after picking up a loose ball level with our penalty box. He skipped past a challenge and continued his run. He passed to Palmer whose shot was at a relatively easy height for Martinez to save.\n\nOn a rare break, Watkins set up John McGinn, but Petrovic tipped it over.\n\nAt the half-time break, there were nothing but happy faces among the travelling army. It had been, no doubt, the best half of the season by far. Against a decent team, too, let’s not forget.\n\nOzzy serenaded us with “Crazy Train” once again as the teams took to the pitch for the second-half.\n\nThe home team began brightly and I can honestly say that after a quick attack in the first minute I heard the Holte End for the first discernible time.\n\n“Yippee-aye-eh, yippe-aye-oh, Holte Enders in the skoi.”\n\nWe applauded them.\n\nOn fifty-four minutes, a foul on Enzo. The free-kick was a long way out. I wanted Palmer to take it, but Enzo stood with Chilwell. Chilwell peeled away and Enzo took aim. As did I.\n\nSnap.\n\nI looked up to see the ball fly over the wall and dip majestically into the top corner with Martinez beaten.\n\nWhat a goal.\n\nThe away sections again boomed.\n\nZola-esque.\n\nI snapped his euphoric run down to our corner. I sensed the meaning of his actions immediately.\n\n“Look at me. I’m Enzo. I’m staying.”\n\nAh, bloody lovely stuff.\n\nI instantly forgave him for the yellow card that followed him taking his shirt off. Sometimes emotion gets in the way of accountability and rational thought.\n\nThe Chelsea supporters on the side stand piped up.\n\n“North Stand. Give Us A Song. North Stand North Stand Give Us A Song.”\n\nLovely stuff.\n\nWe were through. And we just could not resist a nod to our next opponents.\n\n“We all hate Leeds and Leeds and Leeds…”\n\nAmongst all this, a word for the much-maligned duo of Axel Disasi and Benoit Badiashile. Their best games for ages too. There was even a song, only a few days after many for rubbishing his recent performances.\n\n“Brought us back a centre back. Benoit Badiashile.”\n\nWe’re a fickle bunch aren’t we?\n\nOn sixty-five minutes, a song for a former player that I could fully get behind.\n\n“VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI!”\n\nSome late substitutions :\n\n72 : Christopher Nkunku for Jackson.\n\n75 : Raheem Sterling for Madueke.\n\nMoreno rose at the far post but his looping header landed on top of the net rather than inside it.\n\nMore substitutions.\n\n81 : Thiago Silva for Palmer.\n\n87 : Alfie Gilchrist for Badiashile.\n\nVilla had a late flourish and in injury-time, Moussa Diaby coolly slotted in at the Holte End.\n\nAston Villa 1 Chelsea 3.\n\nA roar at the final whistle. What a night. Roared on by over six thousand our team rose to the occasion and played some gorgeous attacking football. Why can’t all away games be like this?\n\nLeeds – you are next.\n\n2023/24 FA Cup Round Five\n\nBlackburn Rovers vs. Newcastle United\n\nBournemouth vs. Leicester City\n\nChelsea vs. Leeds United\n\nCoventry City vs. Maidstone United\n\nLiverpool vs. Southampton\n\nLuton Town vs. Manchester City\n\nNottingham Forest vs. Manchester United\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers vs. Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nWalking out of the stadium after the game brought back memories of other away triumphs over the years. Everyone was singing – “sign him up for eight more years, Chelsea boys are on the beers” – and I sensed a swagger in our step, that good old Chelsea swagger of old. There’s nothing like it. We walked back to the car and we followed the old rule of being able to walk wherever you want after an away win.\n\nUp to the roundabout, out into the road, the cars can stop for us.\n\nThe swagger was back.\n\n1996\n\n2002\n\n2024\n\n1996 – Part 2.\n\nIt came to light after the game at Villa Park that a sports photographer – working for “Action Images” – had taken a photo of my “Ruud Boys” flag from behind the goal.\n\nI spotted that a cropped version of it soon appeared in a copy of “Total Football” later that year.\n\nI didn’t ask for royalties.\n\n1996 – Part 3.\n\nThe former Wimbledon striker Dean Holdsworth once had an affair with glamour model Linsey Dawn McKenzie. At a game at Selhurst Park in the 1996-1997 season – I wasn’t there – the Chelsea fans were full of rude comments about this romantic liaison. In the “Daily Sport” newspaper – that beacon of journalistic integrity – the following day, there was a photo of Linsey Dawn McKenzie (baring all) with a headline to the effect of “How dare Chelsea fans be rude to both Dean and me?”\n\nThe editor chose to illustrate her tirade at the Chelsea fans with a picture of some Chelsea fans, set just behind a large photograph of Linsey Dawn and her quite substantial charms. The photo that the editor chose was from the Villa Park semi-final. It was the photo of my Ruud Boys flag. Or rather, a close-up photo of Glenn and me (looking, strangely, straight at the camera). The story goes that Glenn was sitting with his workmates during a tea break when one of them opened up the middle pages of his “Daily Sport” to exclaim –\n\n“Hey, Glenn – there’s a picture of you and Chris Axon next to Linsey Dawn MacKenzie here.”\n\nNext up, a game at Selhurst Park once again; Crystal Palace away on Monday evening.\n\nSee you there.\n\nChelsea vs. Preston North End : 6 January 2024.\n\nWith the Christmas period over, our first match of 2024 saw us paired in a home FA Cup tie against Preston North End. Our paths do not cross much these days; this only would be our ninth head-to-head since 1963.\n\nI recollected the previous two, both FA Cup ties, from 2002 and 2010. These have been my only sightings of the lilywhites from Lancashire.\n\nOn 17 February 2002, we played Preston at Stamford Bridge in the fifth round of the FA Cup. I remembered the visitors going ahead with an early goal – which I happened to capture on film – but my memory was of it being scored by Jon Macken, but it was actually scored by Richard Cresswell. Thankfully, we recovered well and triumphed 3-1 with goals from Eidur Gudjohnsen, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mikael Forssell. The gate was just 28,133, possibly a result of the club not getting the pricing structure correct back in those days.\n\nOn 23 January 2010, on a cold and misty day, Parky and I travelled up to Deepdale and watched us beat the home team 2-0 with goals from Nicolas Anelka and Daniel Sturridge. The gate was 23,119. Before the game, there was time for a quick photograph of the lovely statue of Sir Tom Finney, the Preston plumber, outside the stadium. This statue, nicknamed “The Splash”, is based on the famous photograph taken at Stamford Bridge in 1956 of Finney evading a tackle by Chelsea defender Walter Bennet, and captures the sun hitting the water as it is splashing up from a water-sodden pitch. In 2010, the National Football Museum was based at Deepdale, but it has since moved to Manchester. I remember being impressed by Deepdale, a neat and clean modern stadium. However, there is nothing much left of note in Preston these days, except perhaps its bus station, a brutalist gem.\n\nThere are a few other Preston “moments” in Chelsea’s history and social history.\n\nDuring the FA Cup run of 1968/69, we drew 0-0 at Deepdale and reconvened at Stamford Bridge on the following Wednesday. We were 2-0 up in front of 44,000 but after seventy-five minutes the floodlights failed. Lo and behold, the game was replayed on the following Monday when 36,000 showed up to see us win 2-1.\n\nAn episode of “Minder” was filmed at Stamford Bridge on the afternoon of 20 September 1980 during our game against Preston. The segment shows actor Denis Waterman watching at the bottom of The Shed terrace with some friends interspersed with some actual game footage, including a great little cameo by Mike Fillery, before he walks along the gangway at the back of The Benches.\n\nOn 28 February 1981, Chelsea fan Gary Lee was tragically killed after being chased, with some friends, by locals before our away game at Preston when he slipped and fell from a multi-story car park. At the game in 2010, supporters close to where I watched the game raised a banner in his memory. His mother, the well-loved Breda, was always on the Chelsea Specials. I remember seeing her around Stamford Bridge and at our away games on many occasions.\n\nGary Lee RIP\n\nI dropped my fellow travellers at “The Eight Bells” and at Stamford Bridge and I parked up just off Lillee Road at about 11.15am. I had a little time to kill. I would eventually meet up with the lads in the pub, but wanted a bite to eat. Lillee Road is the site of the 1873 FA Cup Final, just as it nears West Brompton tube station.\n\nAs I started walking down the North End Road, I spotted that the “Norbros” pizzeria next to “The Goose” had been re-opened as “Koka” and so as it was lunchtime I popped in for some food. Midway through my pizza I spotted Alan walk past, no doubt on his way up to “The Oak” further along the North End Road. In an instant, I decided to join him for a drink and the title of this “Tales” was immediately decided upon.\n\nI walked north, past “The Elm” which looked like it was being refurbished. Just as I was about to pop my head inside inside “The Old Oak”, I saw a Chelsea face pass by. He was heading a hundred yards further north to “The Clarence”. These little run of pubs are decidedly old school. No tourists make it up to these parts, away from the match day buzz and shiny attractions around Stamford bridge. Opposite “The Old Oak” is the site of “The Seven Stars”, a lovely old art deco pub that we popped into once or twice back in the mid-‘nineties, once after the 1997 FA Cup parade at Fulham Broadway. It is now flats but the façade has remained. I wondered if any North End supporters would be drinking anywhere along the North End Road. Maybe up at “The Famous Three Kings”, where we used to drink a few years back? I remembered some Sheffield Wednesday fans in there in 2019.\n\nAlan and Gal were inside “The Old Oak” and I joined them for a while. I hadn’t visited this particular pub since early 2019/20. My friendship with Alan goes back to 1984. My friendship with Gary goes back to around 1988.\n\nI then did myself proud. Rather than take the tube or bus, I walked the 1.6 miles from “The Old Oak” to “The Eight Bells” and got some steps in. It is pretty much a classic match day walk, deep in the heart of Fulham; down the North End Road, onto Fulham Road, onto Fulham High Street. I spotted a family of PNE fans opposite “The Temperance” but I was surprised that neither “The Temperance” nor “The King’s Arms” was full of away fans. Where the bloody hell were they? With six thousand of them in town, they couldn’t all be drinking at Earl’s Court surely?\n\nWhen I had set off from “The Oak”, at 2.25pm, I texted PD to say that I would be about thirty-five minutes. At 3pm exactly, I walked into “The Eight Bells.”\n\nI work in logistics.\n\nIt was a rather shortened drink-up in there. The pub was quiet. Still no away fans anywhere. With the tubes knackered, we caught a bus to Fulham Broadway.\n\nAs expected, Preston had the entire Shed End, some six-thousand strong. Again, I had swapped out with Parky to allow him to sit next to PD and Alan. I took up my “Cup” position in the MHU.\n\nThe team?\n\nPetrovic\n\nGilchrist – Disasi – Colwill – Gusto\n\nCaicedo – Enzo\n\nSterling – Palmer – Mudryk\n\nBroja\n\nSo, a full start for Alfie, soon becoming a Chelsea cult-hero.\n\nThe usual darkened arena, lights flashing, flames.\n\nOnce normal lighting had been resumed, there was a moment of reflection on the one-year anniversary of the passing of Gianluca Vialli. A banner was passed below in the MHL. This struck me as being a “first”. I do not recollect us acknowledging anniversaries of the passing of past players ever before. I think this exemplifies how much the great man was truly adored in SW6. Well done Chelsea.\n\nGianluca Vialli RIP\n\nAt kick-off, there was a ridiculous “shift” from Preston. Four players were lined-up on the half-way line between the centre circle and the East Stand touchline. Here was a variance on the way to start a match. I liked that. A deviation. Something out of the ordinary. One of the hideous buzzwords in popular football parlance these days is “overload” but here was a fine example of it. The ball was played back to Freddie Woodman, the ‘keeper, who pumped into the air. Chelsea won the first header and the resulting second ball.\n\nOh well. Next time Preston.\n\nThe first-half was shite, eh?\n\nI am not going to waste too much time writing about it.\n\nAs expected, the six thousand in The Shed were suitably energised and full of noise.\n\n“Jump around if you hate Blackpool.”\n\nAh yes, the rivalries in Lancashire are alive and kicking; Blackburn and Burnley, Preston and Blackpool, lovely.\n\n“PNE, PNE, PNE – PNE, PNE, PNE – PNE, PNE PNE – PNE – PNE!”\n\nAh, good old Paeonia lactiflora.\n\nPerhaps we should have replied with a song about Apium graveolens.\n\nOur first attempt on goal came after fifteen minutes. Then the visitors had a dig at our goal. But this was lukewarm stuff. On twenty minutes, Raheem Sterling unleashed a stinger at Woodman.\n\nI was sat next to strangers, and both were ridiculously quiet. I found myself commentating at times in the way that many football fans do.\n\n“Second ball!”\n\n“Don’t let it drop.”\n\n“Into them, Chels,”\n\nI felt a bit odd. I needed to engage with someone. Thankfully John and his son were sat right behind me, so I was grateful for an outlet.\n\nI could not but help notice that Alfie was wearing black boots. It seemed like he was trying to “out JT” John Terry.\n\nA beautiful ball from Enzo was lofted into space but Cole Palmer was quickly closed down by the Preston ‘keeper and the ball bounced wide. This remained virtually the sole moment of unscripted innovation from the whole team in that turgid first-half.\n\nThere was angled shot by a Preston attacker, but easily saved by Djordje Petrovic.\n\nThe half-hour was reached and it was so dull. I was getting so perplexed with the continued lack of movement from those in advanced positions. Armando Broja, like Nicolas Jackson, needs to move their markers more often. Everywhere I looked, we had players who were ball-watching, mesmerized into a state of inertia. There were hardly any runners looking to exploit space.\n\nWe would have been no match for Tony Hancock’s mother’s gravy which “at least moved about.”\n\nPalmer was a meagre plus point. Enzo showed a very occasional hint that he might be able to unlock things, but this was a terrible game. As the end of the first-half approached, even the away fans had almost given up on it, their noise decreasing with each passing minute. There were even a few muted boos as the referee signalled the end of the first forty-five minutes. I was mentally preparing for two more days off work to attend the replay at Deepdale in ten days’ time.\n\nAt the start of the half-time break, just before I trotted off to turn my bike around, I joked with John that I was leaving my camera at my seat so I would be forced to return for the second-half.\n\nChelsea attacked us in the Matthew Harding in the second-half. Early on, a lovely ball from Enzo was dropped towards Palmer but the ball fell short and he could not get a touch as it bounced above his leap.\n\nA Moises Caicedo error allowed a Preston attack but the effort from Alan Browne was always curing over.\n\nThroughout the game, the away team chose the currently out-of-favour style of goal kicks; all players huddled either side of the half-way line and a boot up field from the ‘keeper.\n\nJust after a booming shout of “Fuck The Tories” from the away supporters, Malo Gusto sent over a pacey cross down below me. A leap from Broja, a flick, and the ball ripped into the goal.\n\nOh how we love the sight of footballs nestling against the white mesh of goal nets.\n\nThe crowd was now alive at last.\n\nFifty-eight minutes had passed.\n\nCFC 1 PNE 0.\n\nGET IN.\n\nIn The Sleepy Hollow, Alan sent me a text that I soon reciprocated.\n\nYou know how it goes.\n\nBroja charged down a poor clearance but could not convert. Soon after, almost a copy of the first goal. A great cross from Mudryk, another leap from Broja, but the ball scraped the bar this time.\n\nOoooh.\n\nSome substitutions on sixty-one minutes.\n\nThiago Silva for Gilchrist.\n\nNoni Madueke for Mydruk.\n\nSilva slotted alongside Disasi, Colwill moved to left-back, Gusto moved to right-back.\n\nOn sixty-six minutes, a Palmer corner kick from my left and our right zipped towards the near post. Silva rose and headed it convincingly past Woodman.\n\nCFC 2 PNE 0.\n\nGET IN.\n\nI caught Silva’s celebrations on film, if not the goal. He was certainly pumped full of passion. He roared. I spotted him place a clenched fist beneath his shirt to signify his heart.\n\nAn iconic image.\n\nShortly after, John and I were completely bemused and befuddled as to why VAR had been consulted.\n\nThe. Goal. Came. Direct. From. A. Corner.\n\nVAR – do fuck off.\n\nAn air horn had been surreptitiously smuggled into the East Lower and every time that it sounded, I could not help but notice the predominantly young voices that responded “CHELSEA!”\n\nA very odd sensation. It sounded like every single voice had yet to brake; a choir of pre-pubescent young’uns. I looked around. There were, indeed, many more families with kids in attendance than for normal league games.\n\nThree minutes later, Palmer was fouled centrally and Sterling took aim. I caught his approach and strike on film. The ball spun and dipped over the wall. I could hardly believe it had beaten everyone.\n\nAnother roar.\n\nCFC 3 PNE 0.\n\nGET IN.\n\nI caught his run and leap too.\n\nThree goals in just ten minutes. And the floodlights stayed on.\n\nBroja came close again, but an effort was cleared off the line.\n\nOn seventy-six minutes, more substitutions.\n\nConor Gallagher for Palmer.\n\nDeivid Washington for Broja.\n\nThere were shots on goal from Gusto and Gallagher.\n\nOn eighty-eight minutes, a ridiculous scramble inside the Preston box, but the ball eventually presented itself for Enzo to prod home.\n\nWe celebrated but we soon saw a flag for offside. To be fair, it looked offside. Oh well. Then, the elongated pain of VAR. The players all tracked back to the half-way line. The wait seemed to go too long. Maybe ninety seconds? Ridiculous.\n\nThe sign from the referee : goal.\n\nI did not celebrate.\n\nCFC 4 PNE 0.\n\nI hate VAR.\n\nA very late substitution.\n\nMichael Golding for Enzo.\n\nThe substitute almost prodded home a debut goal. There was still time for a rousing “Zigger Zagger” from Cathy down below the lads in The Sleepy Hollow, a merry dance into the box by Madueke but a blocked shot and an effort from Sterling that zipped wide.\n\nIt finished 4-0.\n\nI am not sure what Mauricio Pochettino had dropped into the players’ cocoa at half-time but it certainly worked.\n\nWe made our way home and into the next round. Who do I fancy in Round Four?\n\nAn away game at any of these please –\n\nCoventry City\n\nIpswich Town\n\nMaidstone United\n\nNewport County or Eastleigh\n\nPlymouth Argyle\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nWrexham\n\nNow that we are not actively involved in the league’s top placings nor in European competitions, the two domestic cup competitions really are the focus of our attention this season.\n\nNext up, more days off work and another cup tie.\n\nMiddlesbrough away, Tuesday night, a League Cup semi-final, a Chicken Parmo,I can’t wait.\n\nSee you there.\n\n2002.\n\n2010.\n\nTHE NORTH END ROAD.\n\n2024 PART ONE.\n\nMYKHAILO MUDRYK.\n\nTHIAGO SILVA.\n\nRAHEEM STERLING.\n\n2024 PART TWO.\n\nFulham vs. Chelsea : 2 October 2023.\n\nAfter our pleasing, but narrow, win at home to Brighton & Hove Albion in the League Cup, one game dominated my thoughts.\n\nBut it wasn’t our next game, the SW6 Derby at Craven Cottage.\n\nIt was Frome Town’s FA Cup tie at Ramsgate in Kent.\n\nI had mentioned to a few work mates and close friends during the build up to this match in the competition’s Third Qualifying Round that I was more excited about it than any other game during the season thus far; more so than the previous eleven Frome games and – gulp – more so than the previous eight Chelsea ones.\n\nIt had dominated my thoughts so much that I had subtitled my Facebook post from the MHU before the Brighton game with the words “The UK’s biggest Wetherspoons is in Ramsgate.”\n\nMy reasons were clear and obvious. For starters, it would be my longest ever trip to see Frome Town play. The distance from my village in the east of Somerset to the tip of Kent would be 186 miles. It could be a classic FA Cup tie, an away game in a far flung ground, a new ground at that, with all of the associated dreams of advancing further. There would be the chance to meet up with a band of loyal supporters. There would be the hopes of an entertaining game. There were hopes of drama. If we sneaked a win, or even a draw, we would be in the hat for the Fourth Qualifying Round draw on the Monday. There was the anticipation, however misguided, of getting past these two rounds to qualify for the First Round Proper and to meet a Football League team for the first time since 1954.\n\nOn 24 November, Frome Town played host to Leyton Orient in the FA Cup in front of a mighty 8,000, losing 0-3.\n\nWe all hoped for some sort of repeat.\n\nOn the night before the game, the directors, players, management team and a handful of supporters travelled to Ramsgate by coach. My friends Louise and Steve, the club’s historian and my friend for over forty years, travelled up too. On the Saturday morning, one mini bus and three further cars set off from Frome; my car was one of them. I picked up Simon and his son Charlie, plus his mate Ethan, just after 8am. Also setting off was Trotsky and Terry from Launceston in Cornwall; their trip was a mighty 289 miles.\n\nOne coach, one mini-bus, four cars.\n\nWe would have around forty fans there.\n\nPre-match was spent in the massive pub that looks out onto the beach and the English Channel. It was a gorgeous day and every one of us mentioned how impressed we were with the town, nestled around a decent marina, close to a small harbour, a vibrant sea-front with bars and cafes.\n\nSouthwood Stadium was a treat, with uneven terraces at both ends, a raised bar area overlooking the 3G pitch in one corner, and a concrete-roofed main stand that oozed charm and was surprising sleek and chic.\n\nFrome started the better team and dominated the early exchanges. The home team really ought to have taken the lead just before the break but a chance was spurned. Alas, Ramsgate improved after half-time and went 2-0 up. A late Warren Maidment goal made it 2-1, a score that flattered us slightly. The gate was a healthy 720.\n\nThe dream was over.\n\nBut it had been a lovely adventure in the World’s oldest football competition and one that everyone had thoroughly enjoyed. Even a long delay in Kent on the drive home didn’t dampen our spirits too much. I returned home at around 10pm, my FA Cup journey on pause now until January. I had seen three of Frome’s away games – at Falmouth, Plymouth and Ramsgate, 932 miles in total – plus the home replay against Plymouth. I had missed the home tie against Clevedon due to Chelsea duties.\n\nIt had been a blast.\n\nThanks, Dodge.\n\nHowever, I was somewhat pleased that there was no Chelsea game on the Sunday. On the Monday, the alarm sounded at 4.30am and I worked a 6am to 2pm shift. I had promised PD and Parky that I would drop them off outside “The Eight Bells” at 4.30pm.\n\nI did so at 4.29pm.\n\nI hoped that it was a good omen.\n\nI went off to park up on Whittingstall Road close to Parsons Green tube station. I had booked a “JustPark” spot from 4.30pm to 10.30pm.\n\nOn my walk down to the pub, I spotted the old pottery kiln that stands just off the New King’s Road. I was reminded of a recent snippet of family history. A couple of weeks ago, I took a day off work to travel down to Parkstone in Poole with my Canadian cousin Kathy and her husband Joe, who were visiting England for a month. My grandmother Gladys and Kathy’s grandfather Bill were siblings. Their surname was Lovelace, a beautiful name. However, after being widowed our great grandmother could not cope with the onerous task of looking after five children and so Bill was sent to Ontario in Canada to begin a new life at the age of just ten. I once met Bill, a very quiet man, at Heathrow in 1978 when he was passing through to visit another grandchild who was working in Kenya.\n\nWe visited the house where our grandparents were born. This terraced house was quite close to the site of Poole Pottery and the dwelling was probably built by the owners to house the workers. In her research, Kathy had uncovered the news that their father had been a “moulder” at the pottery, and we were lost in thought for a moment as we envisaged him walking off to the pottery each day for a hard day’s graft. We were pleased that he wasn’t a general labourer; that he had a trade.\n\n“That’s weird, you know…him being a potter. The other two areas of England known for pottery are Chelsea, the home of my football club, and Stoke-on-Trent, where I went to college.”\n\nFunny game, pottery.\n\n…Graham Potter to complete the circle? Nah. How about Percy Axon, the former chairman of Stoke City in the ‘seventies instead? Yes, that’s a much better fit.\n\nWe even visited the interior of the local church where Gladys Lovelace and Thomas Axon were married in 1921.\n\nLet’s get back to Fulham.\n\nI joined PD and Parky at our usual table at 5pm and the place soon filled up. Salisbury Steve soon joined us. I was sat next to five visitors from the US, and I presumed that they had gone to the NFL game at Tottenham at the weekend; instead they were calling in to London, a first visit, after a few days at Munich’s Oktoberfest. They all had tickets to the game so I gave them a little background.\n\n“Oh, they hate us, Fulham. And we don’t mind them, which winds them up even more.”\n\nThey were from Indianapolis and Joe, who got the brunt of my spiel, was a QPR fan.\n\nYeah, I know.\n\nDJ had handed me a copy of “CFCUK” and so I had passed it over to them.\n\nAnyway, they promised me they would take a look at the blog so this is for them.\n\n“Hope you enjoyed the game.”\n\nCourtney from Chicago and Kevin from Toronto were in our little group of Chelsea loyalists and it was good to see them. Paul, who I last saw in Baku, was back for a couple of games from his home in Brisbane. When he lived in London, he used to run the Eight Bells’ Sunday league team.\n\nThat Chelsea world keeps getting smaller.\n\nWe set off for the ground at 7pm. Throughout the drive to London, there had been sporadic outbursts of rain. Thankfully, I remained dry on my walk from the car to the pub and thankfully the walk to Craven Cottage was dry too. We were joined by friends Rob and Martin, both who sit behind me at Chelsea.\n\nI bumped into Big John as I approached the ground.\n\n“Not really too excited about this one. Why am I here? A sense of duty? Habit? Routine? I really don’t know.”\n\nDespite a chap with a loudhailer imploring fans to have bags checked in a specific turnstile, I ignored him and shot through a normal one. I was in like Flynn. Job done.\n\nIt didn’t seem five minutes since the last game at Craven Cottage; that odd, feisty encounter in January when we played well and then didn’t. As with that occasion, I would be watching way down the front of the Putney End. Alas the rake is so shallow down there that it makes spectating – and photography – very difficult.\n\nI reached my seats just as Alan arrived. Gal was already there. Parky arrived a little later, John later still.\n\nA special mention for Charlotte and Paul from Somerset.\n\n“So good to see you both.”\n\nThe rain was holding off. Fingers crossed.\n\nAmazingly, the main stand – now with a dinky logo all of its own – was still not completed, with nobody sitting in the central area of the upper deck. There was the darkening of the lights, and a few Fulhamistas went all Barry Manilow on us and held their ‘phone torches up.\n\nBless.\n\nJust before the teams strode across the pitch from the Cottage, electronic dance music pumped out and it all felt ridiculously incongruous. At least there were no fireworks; Chelsea take note.\n\nUs?\n\nSanchez\n\nCucarella – Silva – Disasi – Colwill\n\nGallagher – Caicedo – Enzo\n\nPalmer – Broja – Mudryk\n\nI remember that Willian played a blinder for Fulham in January. He started again for them.\n\nChelsea wore the new sponsor’s name for the first time.\n\n“Infinite Athlete.”\n\nBring back “Bai Lin Tea”, say I.\n\nWe attacked the Hammersmith End, but as I predicted, my view was annoyingly poor. I didn’t expect great things from my SLR all night.\n\nI liked our energy, pace and movement from the start and we totally dominated. An early effort from Armando Broja flew over and there were a few groans. He was offside anyway.\n\n“A sighter” I thought to myself.\n\nThe midfield three fought for every ball, and the wide players showed a willingness to come close to receive balls to their feet or to stay wide and stretch out their markers. Early on it seemed like it would be a half-decent performance. I was soon warming to the game, to the evening, to the whole experience. Despite my flirtation with my local side, Chelsea is my team, these are my players, despite me not feeling too connected to many of them. I soon joined in with the singing.\n\n“One team in Fulham. There’s only one team in Fulham.”\n\nWe needed to remind them who was who and what was what; this was, after all, the SW6 Derby. The blurb on the electronic signs on the Riverside Stand might well say “London’s Original Football Club” but they are still shite. One hundred and forty-four years and not one single major trophy.\n\nFackinell.\n\nThe irony is, had they beaten Atletico Madrid in Hamburg in 2010, I would have been genuinely pleased for them. And that sums up the Fulham / Chelsea rivalry perfectly.\n\nWe continued to purr and Mudryk enjoyed a few advances down the left, inside and out. His turn of pace is so electric. We just need to plug it in and use it.\n\nFulham had an occasional attack, an occasional corner. Our defenders stood firm.\n\nOn eighteen minutes, a clipped cross from Levi Colwill found an unmarked Mudryk. He leaped to chest the ball down, to cushion it, then swept the ball home.\n\nBloody hell, it was in.\n\nGETINYOUFUCKINGBASTARD.\n\nI screamed like a fool.\n\nThe away end, already bubbling along nicely, exploded with arms flailing everywhere. After the dust settled, I looked over to Alan.\n\nThe quickest “THTCAUN / COMLD” soon followed.\n\nLess than ninety seconds later, Cole Palmer’s played a ball through to Broja. The Fulham defender Tim Ream tried to clear but made a hash of it. The ball struck Broja. The net rippled gloriously.\n\nI completely lost it this time, arms outstretched, and even louder screams.\n\n“Bloody hell Chris, this reaction is heart-warming.”\n\nChelsea were back and so was I.\n\nWe played some nice stuff for the remainder of the half. I immediately had thoughts of a cricket score but knew that this might well turn out to be a close game should the home team grab a goal.\n\nI kept looking over to the spectators in the lower tier of the new stand to my left. A couple of blokes resembled Prince William and Prince Albert of Monaco; surely not. Next to him was a family from the US, the father wearing an Arizona Cardinals jersey, the mother smiling as she recorded the antics of the Chelsea support.\n\n“Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.”\n\nThen a bearded fellow nearby who showed us his Chelsea logo on his ‘phone, then joined in with a few of our songs.\n\n…mmm, our songs.\n\nIt was one of those evenings, like at Brentford a year ago, when we really plundered the Chelsea songbook.\n\nBut songs in praise of Frank Lampard, Timo Werner, Dennis Wise, Salomon Kalou, Cesc Fabregas?\n\nEven Willian, bloody Willian?\n\nNo.\n\nThat’s infuriating.\n\nIt is also infuriating that so many Chelsea supporters think it’s “Solomon” Kalou.\n\nI joined in with the “Vialli” chants out of respect for our late player and manager but that is a little different.\n\nRant over, for now.\n\nA shot from Enzo, bang on form again, rose too highly and sailed over.\n\nWe continued to dominate and I can’t really remember Robert Sanchez being tested at all. This was a fine showing and things were beginning to tick. Conor Gallagher was full of his usual running but he had added some fine passes to his armoury on this damp night in SW6; yes, the rain had started again.\n\nWe were up 2-0 at the break and all was well with the world.\n\nThere were plenty of old school heads in the Hammersmith End and it was good to see. I wondered what the visitors from Indianapolis were making of it all.\n\nIan Maatsen replaced Mudryk; we presumed that he had suffered a knock. I had spotted Mauricio Pochettino with his arm around the player’s shoulder as they walked off the pitch at the break. I thought nothing of it, but…\n\nIn the away end, the singing continued.\n\n“Todd Boehly went to France…”\n\n“Conor Gallagher, da da da – da da da da…”\n\n“Oh Thiago Silva…”\n\n“His hair’s fucking massive…”\n\n“Mudryk said to me…”\n\nAt least these five were playing.\n\nBut then a very loud song about flutes, religion and terrorism.\n\nOh boy.\n\nDo we sing about low emission zones, “Tesco” meal deals, global warming, puddles, the price of breakfast cereals or the pedestrianisation of Norwich city centre?\n\nNo, because these are not relevant at football.\n\nOh well, another rant over.\n\nThe home team managed to see a lot of the ball in the second half but thankfully didn’t manage to do a great deal with it. Was this whole half of football a nod to Mourinho-style game management – “no need to score any more, this game is won” – or was it a result of tiredness and a slackening of intent by Pochettino and his players?\n\nNot sure.\n\nBut we were off the pace compared to the first forty-five minutes.\n\nRaheem Sterling replaced the tiring Broja.\n\nMaatsen struck a shot that hit the framework of the goal at the Putney End, but there were so many people in the way that I could not see if it was the post or bar. Corners from in front of the Cottage were also a mystery for me. I pointed my camera at the pitch whenever my view was not obstructed.\n\nWillian danced in from the Fulham left a few times. On one occasion, the ball was fed into Sasa Lukic but Sanchez’ outstretched left leg hacked the ball away. A goal then would have turned us into jabbering wrecks.\n\nThe Chelsea fan in the lower tier to my left had been supporting the team a little too openly for his own good and was lead out by four security guards.\n\nThe side was refreshed with some late substitutions.\n\nLesley Ugochukwu for Palmer.\n\nNoni Madueke for Caicedo.\n\nAlex Matos for Palmer, a debut.\n\nThe game deteriorated further.\n\nThankfully, no further worries or scares.\n\nFulham 0 Chelsea 2.\n\nAt the end, I messaged a few friends “Thank God it’s over.”\n\nI hurried back to Whittingstall Road and then collected the chaps from outside the stadium. I was famished so stopped at Reading Services for a top up of junk food. The A350 was closed at Chippenham so I was forced onto the A4. All of this meant that I eventually reached home at 1.35am.\n\nI can’t ever go straight to sleep, so after reviewing my photos and chatting to a few mates in the US, I eventually called it a day at 2.30am.\n\nIt had turned out to be a twenty-two hour day.\n\nChelsea, eh?\n\nHome\n\nAway\n\nCome On You Blues\n\nBournemouth vs. Chelsea : 17 September 2023.\n\nThe Chelsea website would call this an entertaining game.\n\nI beg to differ.\n\nHere’s my take on the match at the Vitality Stadium, plus a few other football-related anecdotes thrown in for good measure.\n\nOur home loss against Nottingham Forest – that match feels like it took place ages ago – was followed by a period of inactivity for Chelsea as the increasingly despised international break took over the football calendar. It took over my calendar too; I buggered off for an international break of my own in Italy and France.\n\nI flew to Genoa and then took a train to Diano Marina on the Italian Riviera, a town where I have enjoyed many visits – and football-related incidents – since I first visited it in 1975. On the Friday, I caught a train to Nice, passing through Monaco, the scene of our first UEFA Super Cup win against Real Madrid, a fine trip that one. I met up with my good Chelsea friend Dave, who I had not seen since Sheffield United at home in 2019. We first met up in Los Angeles while on tour with CFC in 2007 and he has lived in the South of France since around 2016. We updated each other with our recent histories while enjoying a few lagers in a couple of bars. It was a joy.\n\nOn the Saturday and Sunday, my work colleague Lorenzo from Milan, and his wife Marina, met up with me in Diano Marina, and we had a lovely time walking west to Imperia and then east to Cervo along the site of the old Roman road the Via Aurelia. There were beers, fine food and tons of laughs. That I was staying in the same hotel that my parents visited during their first holiday to the town made my stay even sweeter.\n\nOn the Monday, before my flight home, I even managed to pack in a three-hour walking tour of Genoa; such an historic, cramped and photogenic city. It left me yearning for more. As fate would have it, I used the services of the same taxi driver on two separate occasions, quite by chance. He was a Samp fan, and also favoured Chelsea as his English team. As I left his cab, we toasted the memory of Gianluca Vialli. They idolise him in Genoa.\n\nIncidentally, on the Thursday, as I darted in and out of a couple of bars near the city’s Piazza Principe train station, I spotted many folk wearing Genoa colours. I panicked a little and wondered if I had made an error and that they were playing that night, a chance to see a game at the Luigi Ferraris Stadium missed due to poor planning. I was to find out that the fans were instead off out to celebrate the club’s birthday, formed one hundred and thirty years ago to the day. It made me think; do any British fans celebrate their clubs’ birthdays with such a show of public affection? I think not. Maybe Genoa are a special case; Genoa Cricket And Football Club, as they are officially known, are Italy’s oldest club after all.\n\nOne last comment about my mini visit to the twin Rivieras of Italy and France. Over the five days of my stay, the most popular replica shirt that I saw?\n\nNot Juventus. Not PSG. Not Milan. Not Inter.\n\nReal Madrid.\n\nI hate modern football.\n\nAs the following weekend approached, I had the English Riviera in sight.\n\nKinda.\n\nOn the Saturday, Frome Town were playing an FA Cup tie at Plymouth Parkway. This naval city is not exactly on the English Riviera, which the tourist boards of Torquay, Paignton and Brixham have chosen as their own moniker, but not too far away. On the Sunday, I had the Chelsea game in Bournemouth. The Dorset Riviera anyone?\n\nThe FA Cup game, a keenly-contested 2-2 draw in front of almost 400, was very enjoyable. Frome Town twice led through Owen Humphries and then James Ollis, only to conceded a late equaliser. The two teams would meet again the following Tuesday at Badgers Hill in a replay. This really pleased me; two Canadian relatives were to visit my local area during the week and had been keen to see a football match, any football match, in person during their short stay in Somerset. With the draw, they now had a game to watch.\n\nAnother North American tourist came into my plans, like a last-minute substitution, when I awoke on Saturday morning before my flit down to Plymouth. Tom, from Orange County in California, was staying at a hotel only two miles from my house and was angling for a place in The Chuckle Bus for the short trip to Bournemouth on the Sunday. Some strategic logistical planning quickly took place and everything was sorted. One Chuckle Bus became two, parking was arranged outside the Vitality Stadium, and everyone was happy.\n\nSunday soon arrived. I picked Tom up at the hotel at eight o’clock, but before we headed down to join up with Glenn, PD, Parky and Sir Les in Bournemouth, I treated Tom to a whistle-stop tour of both my home village of Mells and my home town of Frome.\n\nI darted around Mells, quickly combining facts about the village – “fifteenth century church”, “Manor House”, “my mother was born in that house”, “I spotted Robert Plant outside that house last year”, “Fussell’s Ironworks”, “Little Jack Horner”– with a few football-related things too – “here’s where I kicked a tennis ball against the wall opposite my house, breaking many windows in the process”, “this is the school where I first became a Chelsea fan”, “I played for my village the first time here” before then heading into Frome.\n\nWe even had time to stop off – and step inside – Badgers Hill, the home ground of Frome Town, where I watched my first real football game in 1970.\n\nI zoomed down to Bournemouth and we joined up with the chaps in “The Moon On The Square” at around 10.20am. It was wet outside. So much for the Riviera.\n\nA few other friends drifted in as I ordered a light breakfast, and Tom ordered his second breakfast of the morning. Glenn said he’d attend the Frome game on Tuesday. There wasn’t too much talk about the Chelsea game. It had been such an underwhelming start to the season.\n\nAnd not just at our club.\n\nIn many ways, I have been struggling further with football in general. In a rare and lucid moment before a Depeche Mode concert with my mate Dennis from DC, at a pub on the River Thames in Richmond in June, I stumbled across a phrase that summed it all up.\n\nWith a nod to my deepening alienation from top level players, my dislike of VAR, of UEFA, of FIFA, even the FA, the deadening of the atmosphere at games at Stamford Bridge, the entitlement of many fans, players’ obscene wags, late changes to kick-off times, blah, blah, blah, I summed it all up.\n\n“I am not a fan of football, but I love being a football fan.”\n\nI love the planning of travel to games, the sorting out of tickets, the driving, the endless driving, the drink-ups in the pubs, meeting new Chelsea friends from various places, the away days, the clobber, the laughs, the piss-taking, the banter, the memories…and I like being at games, live-games, taking in all in, the architecture of stadia, the history, the terrace humour…and I’d like to think I am a good supporter too, singing and cheering as much as I can, being there for the team…then there is the photography and the words in this blog.\n\nI enjoy it all.\n\nI love being a fan.\n\nThe football?\n\nNot so sure.\n\nWe got drenched – absolutely soaked – on the short walk to the multi-story car-park. The two Chuckle Busses set off :\n\nGlenn, PD, Parky, Sir Les, Daz in Glenn’s van.\n\nTom, two of Daz’ mates and me in my car.\n\nWe arrived at the same “JustPark” location – a large space outside a house on Littledown Avenue – at around 1.20pm. The rain still fell.\n\nI was soon inside, evading the eyes of the tedious “bag gestapo” at the away turnstiles.\n\nMade it.\n\nA few “hellos” and a few handshakes in the away concourse…before I knew it “bloody hell, it’s ten to.”\n\nInto the away seats we went.\n\nThe floodlights were on, the sky was dull grey, the rain still fell.\n\nThe teams appeared and Chelsea were to wear the newly-confirmed third kit of Eton Blue. For once, I approve; a nice nod to our inaugural colours of 1905. Typically, I was amazed how many of our new fans were blissfully unaware of the light blue racing colours of the Earl Cadogan. It’s such a subtle shade. I think it looks fantastic.\n\nOur team?\n\nDefinitely a back four, right kids?\n\nSanchez\n\nGusto – Silva – Disasi – Colwill\n\nGallagher – Uguchukwu – Enzo\n\nSterling – Jackson – Mudryk\n\nThere was the usual “make some noise – for the boys” bollocks from the PA, plus some social deviant yelling out “Red Army!” on the TV screens.\n\nOh aye.\n\nConor was captain.\n\nBefore the game, a minute of silence for those that perished recently in Libya and Morocco.\n\nThe game began, and it began ever so brightly as the Eton Blues attacked the goal to our right. A move down the right and some deft interplay between Mykhailo Mudryk and Nicolas Jackson set up Gallagher but he could not fully connect.\n\n“Big game for Mudryk, Gal.”\n\nJackson then thumped an effort against a post after being set up by Mudryk.\n\nWe had a decent start, but the play was tending to by-pass Enzo. Both Sterling and Gallagher were combining well and creating a few solid advances into the opponents’ half. The game then struggled along, and Bournemouth slowly got back into the game. A low reaching cross towards the far post was met by Dango Quattara but Robert Sanchez made a fantastic block, spreading himself out, and the chance was fluffed.\n\nThere were songs for Frank Lampard and Dennis Wise?\n\nWhy – oh, why the fuck why?\n\nThen, an odd moment. Sanchez was in possession just in front of his goal and as he ran through his options, we were treated to the bizarre sight of all four defenders lined up along the goal line. It was football, but not as I knew it.\n\nThe problem was that the home team weren’t necessarily taking the bait and pushing up. They stayed back. This was just hideously sterile football.\n\nOn the half-hour mark, more Bournemouth possession. They enjoyed a little spell.\n\nBut then a shimmy from Mudryk and the ball was played in to Conor in a central position. He shimmied himself. The world seemed to stop. He took aim. His shot was saved, damn it.\n\nDamn you, Neto.\n\nA Bournemouth effort was smashed so high into the air, and so wide of the goal – it went out for a throw-in – that I immediately Christened it the worst shot that I had seen in almost fifty years of football.\n\nIt was one of those games.\n\nAs the first-half neared completion, the noise levels had dwindled.\n\n“You can cut the atmosphere with a shovel, Gal.”\n\nSigh.\n\nThere was a lack of cohesion and urgency after the initial flourish, and only Sterling and Gallagher could take much comfort from the first-half. However, Sterling’s fine touches in tight areas and purposeful spins into space just seemed to peter out as he reached the final third. He – and we – lacked a cutting edge.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSoon into the second-half, that man Sterling sized up his options at a free-kick. He struck a spectacular curler at goal, but it ping’d the underside of the bar and bounced down and across the goal. Levi Colwill was on hand to knock the rebound in, but the goal was immediately chalked off for offside.\n\nBollocks.\n\n“Will be 0-0 this, Gal.”\n\nThe sun came out, and it got uncomfortably hot in the away section.\n\nJackson was in on goal but slashed an effort ludicrously wide. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nWe came close after a scramble that followed a Jackson effort. However, the Bournemouth ‘keeper managed to get a strong hand to a goal bound prod while lying on his back.\n\nAt the other end, Richard Billing drilled a shot just wide of our goal from a central free-kick.\n\nBoth teams struggled.\n\n“Their final ball is worse than ours, Gal.”\n\nNearing the end of the game, the home team broke down our left and engineered a chance for our former striker Dominic Solanke. Again, Sanchez saved well.\n\nI noticed that Jackson was too easily out-muscled in many of his his one-to-ones with his marker. But we have to give him time.\n\nThere was a plethora of substitutions :\n\nCole Palmer for Mudryk.\n\nHe hadn’t had that good game that he needed.\n\nBen Chilwell for Colwell.\n\nWe all moaned when he had passed, obliquely, after a fine run, the goal at his mercy.\n\nIan Maatsen for Enzo.\n\nI disliked Enzo’s slow walk off the pitch as he was substituted.\n\nOur last chance came from a rampaging Palmer – “keen Gal, but no options” – chose to pass to Sterling rather than shoot himself. Sterling then crossed to Palmer, whose snapshot was saved well by Netto. A follow-up shot by Maatsen was blocked.\n\nIt was all pretty woeful.\n\n“I enjoyed Plymouth yesterday more, Gal.”\n\nIt was so dull that I sighed when eight extra minutes were announced.\n\nI just wanted to go home.\n\nIt ended 0-0.\n\nNext up, Plymouth Parkway on Tuesday, Bemerton Heath on Saturday and Aston Villa on Sunday.\n\nThis football life, eh?\n\nWest Ham United vs. Chelsea : 20 August 2023.\n\nThere were several instances during the build-up to our game against West Ham at the London Stadium where I told my match-day companions that I fancied us to win. And I honestly believed it. Despite me venturing to the Stratford wastelands on six previous occasions and not seeing a single Chelsea victory, after the pleasing performance against Liverpool I sensed a few reasons to be cheerful. I couldn’t have been the only one.\n\nMy week had been busy from a footballing perspective. There were two Frome Town away games, encompassing two new grounds, on the Tuesday and Saturday, and both were enjoyable.\n\nI drove down to Salisbury on the Tuesday after work and met up with Salisbury Steve for the league game against newly-promoted Bemerton Heath Harlequins. I loved their neat ground with a decent clubhouse behind one goal and tall yew trees on two of the remaining three sides. Despite going ahead, Frome Town contrived to get two players sent off and eventually lost 1-3.\n\nOn the Saturday morning, it was an early start for me – to avoid holiday traffic – as I drove the 170 miles down to Falmouth in Cornwall. I set off at 6am and arrived at 10am for the second preliminary round of the FA Cup and a match against Falmouth Town. This was another excellent ground, with a bona fide terrace behind one goal and seats set upon a slope along one side. There was even a noisy home support, including a section called “F Troop” involving banners, flags, a music system and even a bloke in a Pikachu body suit – don’t ask – but despite all this, Frome Town carved out a fine 6-2 win.\n\nI got back from Falmouth at 9.30pm on Saturday night. I was up again at 6.30am to head up to London. Over the weekend, I would end up driving 560 miles for football. It’s my life.\n\nI had picked up PD, Simon and Parky by 8.30am and we were parked at Barons Court by 10.30am.\n\nAt last we were able to enjoy a decent pre-match prior to a West Ham away game. All the others had been early kick-offs or evening games. Here was the chance to relax. We headed to London Bridge, just as the women’s World Cup Final was kicking-off. There was a vague plan to catch a bit of the game but none of us were too bothered.\n\nI hadn’t seen a single kick of the men’s World Cup in Qatar, and – thus far – I had not seen a single kick of the women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand either. International football isn’t my thing for reasons that I can’t be arsed to list.\n\nAs we changed trains at Green Park, Parky realised that he had left his match ticket in my car so he had to back-track.\n\nSimon, PD and I ploughed on regardless. We walked from London Bridge to Tower Bridge Road and made our first stop of our pre-match on both banks of the River Thames. I had visited M. Manze once before, and I had promised the lads a visit on one of our wanders around London on a subsequent match day. This establishment, which dates from 1892, serves up traditional pie and mash, and is much-revered. It reminds me of the very first pie and mash shop that I visited on the North End Road before the famous 5-0 Leeds United game in April 1984. I was with PD then, too.\n\nAll three of us opted for double pie and double mash, served with the famous parsley-decorated green liquor, and splashed with copious amounts of white pepper and chilli vinegar. It’s a London staple, not found elsewhere in the UK. The food didn’t touch the sides. We sat at old wooden benches and ate in glorious silence. We heard that Spain were 1-0 up down under. Replenished, we left the green and white tiled interior and caught a bus to Canada Water. From here, an overground train to Wapping, which – er – went under the Thames.\n\nFrom here, we walked up to a famous old pub, The Prospect Of Whitby, which has been on “the list” for a while. This is a glorious pub, and acted as our base camp. Not long after the first drinks were ordered, Parky joined us. In Sydney, the score had stayed 1-0 to Spain. We had not seen a single kick of the game.\n\nIt was time to relax. This boozer abuts onto the River Thames. There are stone floors, wooden beams, terraces, a beer garden, history everywhere. Out in the river, a noose hangs from a gibbet, a memory of the days of yore when pirates were put to their death on this site.\n\nThere were drinks and laughs.\n\nSimon told of how his grandson is named Enzo – not because of our Argentinian midfielder – and he had recently bought him an Enzo shirt.\n\nThis was such a fine time.\n\n“Do we have to go to the game?”\n\nI could have stayed there all day.\n\nA Chelsea fan who lived locally arrived to give Simon a spare ticket, and we were then able to move on to the next pub. Wapping, once an area of trade and warehouses, was yuppified in the ‘eighties, with conversions taking place everywhere. Nowadays, the place reeks of wealth. On the walk between pubs, we spotted Porsches and Mercs parked on the cobbled streets. There is a distinct air of fine living in the shadows underneath the converted warehouses. I saw a couple of people with West Ham shirts. This wasn’t classic Cockney territory like Mile End, Poplar or Plaistow, but as good as it gets in modern day London.\n\nFackinell.\n\nWe dipped into the second pub, “The Town Of Ramsgate”, and this was another Thames-side pub with a terrace abutting the river and access to the shingled reach below. It was another winner. We made plans to return. There are three other pubs close by.\n\nAt about 3.15pm, Simon booked an Uber and we were soon on our way to the game. The London Stadium was less than three miles away. We could relax.\n\n“Been a great pre-match, boys. Was even better when Parky fucked off for ninety minutes.”\n\n“I still fancy us to win today.”\n\nHalfway to our destination, I continued on :\n\n“Tell you what, it makes a nice change to get to an away game early. No rush. Fed up of arriving late. Glad we have grown out of that habit.”\n\nWith that, Doctor Uber took a wrong turn and we found ourselves on a road headed for the Blackwall Tunnel.\n\n“Fackinell.”\n\nHelpless, we peered out as the car was swept under the river, unable to deviate. We did a U-turn past the O2, then swung north once again. Thankfully, we arrived at Pudding Mill Lane at just after 4pm. Outside, the heat was suddenly blistering, away from the cool shadows of Wapping. After two bag searches, we were in the away end at 4.15pm.\n\nParky and I joined up with Alan, Gary and John in the fourth row of the upper section. Simon was twenty rows behind us. PD was adrift in the lower tier.\n\nPrior to the teams entering the pitch, a large mosaic was displayed in the East Stand depicting the Europa Conference trophy that West Ham stumbled upon last season.\n\nWest Ham in a virtually all claret kit, Chelsea in blue / blue / white.\n\nOur team?\n\nAlas, we were missing Reece James, so Malo adjusted into the right wing-back berth.\n\nSanchez\n\nDisasi – Silva – Colwill\n\nGusto – Gallagher – Enzo – Chukwuemeka – Chilwell\n\nJackson – Sterling\n\nBloody hell, Kurt Zouma was captain of West Ham, alongside Emerson Palmieri, another ex-Chelsea player. There were familiar names in the home side. Simon had warned that Michail Antonio always seemed to perform against us.\n\nAt 4.30pm, the game began. It doesn’t always happen at West Ham, but this looked like a virtual full house. I couldn’t spot many empty seats anywhere. Gulp.\n\nAs always, we attacked the far end, the Bobby Moore Stand, in the first-half. It’s a little ironic that West Ham have switched from a very tight ground at Upton Park in favour of a wide-open elliptical set-up at London Stadium, whereas we have gone from a sprawling oval of the old Stamford Bridge to the tight stands of the new Stamford Bridge. I wasn’t sure if those Chelsea fans in the lower tier, nearer the action but with poor sightlines, were better positioned than those in the upper tier, with a better overall view but so damned far from the pitch. We were right in the middle, above the claret-coloured void. Perhaps we had the best view of the two, a compromise.\n\nOn the pitch, a middling opening, and not a great deal of noise from any section.\n\nThe home team attacked and won a corner which Robert Sanchez took care of. Soon after, the former Southampton player James Ward-Prowse, sent in another lofted corner, and as the ball dropped I was unfortunate enough to catch the moment that Nayef Aguerd out-muscled one or two of our players to head home.\n\nFackinell.\n\nI turned to John : “didn’t even make it difficult for him to jump.”\n\nWe dominated the possession but I noted a lack of movement up front. In the stands, all was quiet. How was it possible for over 62,000 to make so little noise?\n\nGradually, we improved.\n\nNicolas Jackson’s involvement increased and there were a couple of half-chances. On twenty-seven minutes, Ben Chilwell’s cross was cleared but the ball fell to Carney Chukwuemeka. His sway and shimmy lost his marker and as the ball was worked to his right foot, he curled a shot that Alphonse Areola was unable to reach.\n\nCarney made him look like a proper tit.\n\nThe Chelsea crowd celebrated, as did the scorer who reeled away with a jump towards the home fans in the corner.\n\nA rare West Ham attack resulted in a shot from Lucas Paqueta that bounced up off a post down below us.\n\nThere had been a shout for a Chelsea penalty after Jackson was sent sprawling but VAR had noted an offside. When Raheem Sterling squirmed into space on the edge of the box, Tomas Soucek hacked at him, and there was no VAR to save the home team.\n\nWe watched as Enzo stood and faced off against Areola. It was a weak penalty and the ‘keeper was easily able to save to his right.\n\nSigh.\n\nIn the closing minutes of the first-half, Chukwuemeka was injured and was stretchered off.\n\nWith Sterling running at pace against a worried defence, and with able support from Jackson and Chukwuemeka, we had played some decent stuff in that first-half. At the half-time break, everyone around me was positive.\n\n“Sterling excellent.”\n\n“All us really.”\n\nThe first song aired by the PA at the break was “Radio Ga Ga” by Queen, probably my most loathed band of all time. I thought to myself “that has no right to be played at a football game” and I fucked off to the gents.\n\nAs I descended the stairs down to the airy concourse, I was reminded of how away games these days are populated by a greater number of lads – mainly lads – in their twenties than in previous years. Not that it needs stating every game, but I also noted how the vast majority of our away support eschew club colours of any description. This was brought home to me when a couple in their forties passed me. Both of them were wearing Chelsea shirts and, to be frank, they really stuck out. All around me, behind me by the bar, grouped at the base of the stairs, chatting and laughing, were lads – mainly lads – dressed in anything but Chelsea gear.\n\nPlain T-shirts, polos, shorts, jeans, trainers.\n\nLyle & Scott, Lacoste, CP, Boss, Barbour, Fila, Fred Perry, Weekend Offender, Pretty Green, Moncler, Baslager, Adidas, Nike, Aquascutum, Puma, Paul & Shark, Armani, Ralph Lauren.\n\nI often wonder what goes through the mind of Randy and Brandy from Badgercrack, Nebraska when they show up at a Chelsea away game with full shirt / cap / scarf Holy Trinity and find themselves in a sea of lime, lavender, coral, mint, navy, peach, beige, cerise, black, grey and white.\n\nThe West Ham DJ had redeemed themselves. The last song of the break was “Born Slippy” by Underworld, with hints of Hibs Casuals and a working class culture.\n\nMykhailo Mudryk replaced the unfortunate Chukwuemeka.\n\nLast season, we eked out a 1-1 draw under a grey sky in Stratford. There were white fluffy crowds amid a blue sky on this Sunday in August. The second-half began.\n\nWhereas I stood throughout the first-half, as were those near me, I noted that many were sat as the game recommenced. I sat too, and hated myself for it. I felt that this was a sure sign that we weren’t up for it. There was no noise to speak of.\n\nBloody modern football.\n\nSoon in to the restart, the ball stood up nicely for Said Benrahma on a break but the effort went wide. Just after, a long ball caught our defence out. We seemed too square, too high, almost as if the menacing Antonio was himself the last man. He raced away past Levi Colwill and shot low past the dive of Sanchez, a hideously perfect finish. Now the home fans roared.\n\nBut oh their “Champions Of Europe” chant.\n\nIt’s beyond parody really.\n\nAnd no, they are not even being ironic.\n\nWhen we twice won the Europa League, we would never have dared sing that.\n\nFuck me, if West Ham are champions of Europe in 2023, then that means that the Brotherhood Of Man were the best band throughout Europe in 1976.\n\nSorry Led Zeppelin, sorry Fleetwood Mac, sorry Abba, sorry Rolling Stones, sorry Thin Lizzy, sorry Sex Pistols.\n\nSave all your kisses for me, West Ham.\n\nThe second-half really disappointed. In the first-half, there was at least intent and cohesion. The second period just got worse and worse.\n\nI compared notes with John.\n\n“The only time we win here, I had to work.”\n\n“Like me at United. Been there fourteen times. Not seen us win.”\n\nWe toiled but it was terrible to watch.\n\nMalo Gusto made an absolutely sublime last ditch tackle when a one-on-one break reached the point of no return.\n\nSadly, Enzo was a poor shadow of the man who played so formidably against Liverpool.\n\nOn the hour, Mauricio Pochettino replaced Chilwell with new signing Moises Caicedo. We switched to four at the back with Caicedo bolstering the midfield.\n\nGoal-scorer Aguerd was then booked for the second time and was sent off on sixty-eight minutes. Our attacking play was disjointed. We were afraid to shoot. Sterling dithered on more than one occasion. Mudryk had pace but no end product. More substitutions.\n\nNoni Madueke for Gallagher.\n\nMason Burstow for Gusto.\n\nA debut and thus a very proud moment for my mate Andy, who coached Burstow at a club in Kent for a while.\n\nMudryk was pitiful. One shot of his, after arriving late at the far post, was volleyed so far into the air that it spent ages coming back down to Earth, and when it did, it didn’t even go off for a corner.\n\nThis was horrible.\n\nQuite bizarrely, I was aware that a young lad, maybe in his late teens, who was sat to my immediate left did not utter one word the entire game. Not one word; no word of encouragement, no comments, certainly no songs of support.\n\nCan anyone fucking explain that to me?\n\nMadueke showed some intent and was almost rewarded when a shot was deflected on the base of Areola’s post.\n\nWith hundreds of Chelsea leaving before the end, a rash challenge by debutant Caicedo resulted in Paqueta scoring from the spot.\n\nHoly Moises.\n\nWest Ham United 3 Chelsea 1.\n\nSigh.\n\nSo, seven visits to the London Stadium, and still no wins.\n\nShall I stay at home next season?\n\nWe made our way back to Pudding Mill Lane and caught the first of three trains to take us back to Barons Court. On the second one, a Jubilee Line train, the announcer stated that “this train will terminate at Wembley Park.”\n\nI turned to the boys and said “I don’t think our season will.”\n\nWe had crossed the River Thames six times during the day and we were at last on our way out west.\n\nI eventually reached home at 10.30pm.\n\nThis, of course, was a disappointing performance bit I genuinely think that I – and many others – immediately found ourselves getting overly upset with a few negatives.\n\nIt was, after all, only our second league game of the season.\n\nNext up is a Friday night match at home to Luton Town.\n\nSee you there.\n\nManze’s\n\nThe Prospect Of Whitby\n\nThe Town Of Ramsgate\n\nThe London Stadium\n\nManchester City vs.Chelsea : 8 January 2023.\n\nI have feared that I might have to write this particular match report for a while. Ever since we heard that Gianluca Vialli had left his post with the Italian Football Federation, and was then re-admitted to the Royal Marsden Hospital before Christmas, many of us suspected the worst. Alas, on the Friday morning after our home game with Manchester City, the saddest of news broke.\n\nGianluca Vialli had died.\n\nI was told the news by a work colleague in our office. I put my hands to my face and sat silent for a few moments.\n\nThis was just horrible, horrible news.\n\nI had mentioned Luca only a few days previously in my match report for the Nottingham Forest game; that memory from almost twenty-four years ago, a crowded car-park, a photograph, an autograph, the perfect gent.\n\nIn fact, I was rather sparing with my comments about Gianluca Vialli in that report. I sensed that he didn’t have long to live. Pancreatic cancer is an obstinate foe. I erred away from saying too much about the former Chelsea player and manager. I’ll be blunt; I didn’t want to tempt fate.\n\nThat I mentioned Gianluca Vialli, though, in my last match report written while he was alive seems right.\n\nAnd it also seems right that the great man took his last breath in a hospital on Fulham Road, just a few hundred yards from Stamford Bridge.\n\nLuca, how we will miss you.\n\nBeing a big fan of Italian football in the ‘eighties, I was aware of the curly-haired striker playing for Sampdoria of Genoa, and watched with interest as he took part in the European Championships of 1988 and the World Cup of 1990. The blues of Sampdoria, with Vialli the leading scorer, won their first and only title in 1991. My first actual sighting of the man took place when I travelled to Turin in May 1992 to see Juventus and Sampdoria eke out a 0-0 draw at the Stadio Delle Alpi. Sampdoria were only a few weeks away from a European Cup Final with Barcelona at Wembley and so put in a rather conservative performance.\n\nNot long after the loss to Barcelona, Vialli moved to Juventus for a world record £12.5M. With Juve being my favourite European team, and with Italian football being shown that season on Channel Four for the first time, I was able to keep tabs on both the progress of him and the team. In 1995, Juve won their first Italian Championship since 1986. In late 1995, I saw Vialli play for Juventus at Ibrox against Rangers in a Champions League group phase game; the visitors won 4-0, with Vialli the captain, and a certain Antonio Conte playing too. I watched in the Broomloan Stand, in a home section, but very close to the travelling away support. The Italians were on fire that night.\n\nAt the end of that season, I watched the European Cup Final in a bar in Manhattan as Juventus beat Ajax on penalties in Rome. Just over a week later, I was over on the West Coast – I remember the location, Gaviota State Park – when a ‘phone call home resulted in me learning that Gianluca Vialli had signed for Chelsea.\n\nIt truly felt that the stars were aligning.\n\nGianluca Vialli was to play for Chelsea. Just writing those words twenty-six years or so later still gives me goose bumps.\n\nOf course, that 1996/97 season has gone down in Chelsea folklore for both happy and sad reasons. In addition to Vialli, the summer of 1996 brought new signings Roberto di Matteo and Frank Leboeuf to augment the previous summer’s purchases of Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes. Our Chelsea team was certainly looking like it could seriously challenge for honours. But first, tragedy, and the death of director Matthew Harding. We all wondered if this would redirect the club’s focus, but not long after, Ruud Gullit signed another top-ranked Italian Gianfranco Zola, and the rest is history.\n\nIronically, we were stumbling a little before Zola signed. Looking back, I think it is fair to say that Hughes and Vialli were a little too similar in many aspects of their game, and it was the addition of Zola, a play-maker in addition to being a goal scorer, that allowed the team to reach its full potential. Manager Gullit certainly jiggled line-ups around to accommodate all three strikers, and on one memorable occasion, we were able to witness Chelsea alchemy of the very highest order.\n\nLosing 0-2 at half-time at home to Liverpool in the Fourth Round of the FA Cup in January 1997, Gullit brought on Mark Hughes in place of Scott Minto and the triumvirate of Vialli, Zola and Hughes caused havoc in a scintillating second forty-five minutes. A swivel and turn from Sparky on fifty minutes, a delicious Zola free-kick eight minutes later, then two from Vialli on sixty-three and seventy-six minutes. Stamford Bridge was buzzing and we didn’t want the game to end. It is many Chelsea supporters’ favourite ever match. It often gets mentioned here and I do not apologise for it.\n\nOf course we went on to win the FA Cup Final in the May of that year, our first trophy since 1971, and the appearance of Gianluca Vialli as a very late substitute for Zola resulted in the whole end yelling the great man’s name.\n\n“VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI!”\n\nThings never stay the same, though, at Chelsea and before we knew it, Ken Bates had dismissed Ruud Gullit after just a year and a half in charge, and chose Vialli to take on the role of player-manager. I’ll be honest, I was a little concerned, but I need not have been. In a glorious period supporting my team, Vialli won the 1998 League Cup, the 1998 ECWC, the 1998 UEFA Super Cup, the 2000 FA Cup and the 2000 Community Shield.\n\nThere has been greater success since, but I absolutely loved the vibe around the club from 1996 to 2000 – “the Vialli years” – and it is probably my favourite period supporting the club, although as a one-off season 1983/84 will never be beaten.\n\nWe came so close in 1998/99, only trailing eventual champions Manchester United by four points, but finishing third. If only we had won and not drawn our two games against United, we would have been champions, and the barbs aimed at us in 2005 would have been less prolific.\n\nThere was a lovely mix of characters at Chelsea in that era. We played some superb football at times. Ruud called it “sexy”, but I think under Vialli it became a little “cheeky” with a mix of expansive football, quick breaks, rapid-fire passing, with quality everywhere. What do I mean by “cheeky”? Think back to October 1999, Chelsea beating Manchester United 5-0, with Wisey winding up Nicky Butt. That’s what I mean.\n\nThere was style and swagger, those two Chelsea cornerstones.\n\nAs a player, I loved Vialli’s power, technique, movement, work ethic and goal scoring prowess.\n\nAs a manager, I loved his cheerfulness, his honesty, his diligence, the way he called the players his “chaps.”\n\nI loved his big Italian tie, his sweatband, his grey pullover, his penchant for wearing a watch over his cuffs.\n\nI’ll admit it.\n\nHe was a man’s man.\n\nWe all loved him.\n\nAgain, Chelsea being Chelsea, nothing stays the same and amidst rumours of player power, Ken Bates sacked Vialli as manager in September 2000.\n\nI had seen the great man’s first game as a Chelsea player at Southampton in 1996 and I had seen his last game as manager at Newcastle in 2000.\n\nThank you Luca. We had a blast.\n\nVialli – I believe – continued to live in London after his departure and also had season tickets at Stamford Bridge for some, if not all, of the subsequent years. In doing a little research for this edition, I was able to plunder some photographs from a midweek game at Stamford Bridge against West Bromwich Albion on 12 February 2018. At halftime, Neil Barnett paraded three stars from the late ‘nineties and it was a glorious occasion.\n\nMy eyes were set on Gianluca Vialli. I am pretty sure it was the first time that I had seen him since he left us in 2000.\n\nMy match report from that night is called “Tales From The Class Of ‘98” and features these words.\n\n“They slowly walked towards us in the MH and I snapped away like a fool. Each were serenaded with their own songs. They lapped it up. My goodness, it is the twentieth-anniversary season of our ECWC triumph in Stockholm, one of my favourite seasons. It is hard to believe in these days of single-strikers and “false nines” that in 1997/1998 we had the considerable luxury of four strikers.\n\nGianfranco Zola\n\nGianluca Vialli\n\nTore Andre Flo\n\nMark Hughes\n\nAnd five if we include Mark Nicholls.\n\nBloody hell, those were the days. A two-man attack. Beautiful. Let’s get to basics here; I’d much rather see two top strikers in a starting eleven for Chelsea rather than two top holding midfielders. Who wouldn’t?\n\nThat season, we were certainly blessed. And each of the four had their own qualities, and it was always interesting to see how Ruud, and then Luca, chopped and changed the front two.\n\nZola – those amazing twists and turns, those dribbles, that appreciation of space, those passes to others, those goals.\n\nVialli – those blind-sided runs, the constant movement, the strength of that body, the willingness to run and run.\n\nFlo – surprisingly skilful on the ground for a tall man, his touch was excellent and he weighed in with his share of goals.\n\nHughes – the last of his three seasons with us, but still useful for his strength in hold-up play, his galvanising effect on the team, and eye for a goal.\n\nGlory days indeed. I loved that team those players.\n\nGianfranco Zola, Tore Andre Flo, Mark Hughes, Gianluca Vialli, Dan Petrescu, Frank Leboeuf, Graeme Le Saux, Gus Poyet, Dennis Wise, Roberto di Matteo, Steve Clarke, Ruud Gullit.\n\nIf anyone had said to me in 1998 that, twenty years on, only one of those players mentioned would get into my team of greatest ever Chelsea players, I would have screamed madness.”\n\nAs I looked at other photos from that evening, I gulped when I saw a photo of my friend Glenn and little old me in the hotel before the game with Ray Wilkins, who would pass away less than two months later. That night took on a new resonance for me.\n\nGoing in to the FA Cup tie at Manchester City, the focus in my mind shifted. Rather than get obsessed, an"
