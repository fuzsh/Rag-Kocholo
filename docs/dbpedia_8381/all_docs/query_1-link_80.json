        "text": "LEROY ANDERSON Orchestral Music Volume 5\n\nBBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Leonard Slatkin; Kim Criswell, Soprano; William Dazeley, Baritone\n\nGoldilocks [excerpts], Suite of Carols [version for woodwinds], Goldilocks: Lady in Waiting [waltz], Shall I Take My Heart [instrumental]Naxos 8.559382 [52:16]\n\nNew releases in this series from the man described as \"one of the great American masters of light orchestral music\" came regularly throughout 2008, Anderson’s centenary year, and very enjoyable they have been. As I write, Vol.3 is No.15 in the Naxos bestsellers list. Although equally welcome for some unfamiliar material, including four world première recordings, this is the last in the series and a less varied collection than its predecessors. ‘Goldilocks’ was a musical from 1958 which ran for 161 performances on Broadway and won two Tony awards. Pyramid Dance is probably its best known piece. To those who, like me, prefer their orchestral CDs voiceless there are three vocal numbers here. I can’t think why Naxos has separated the excerpts [tracks 1-11] from the other two numbers [tracks 18-19] with the Christmas carol arrangements. Richard S Gimell’s booklet notes are again hugely informative; and there is delightful photo of the composer on the cover. Incidentally, not one of this splendid series is reviewed in the latest Penguin Guide – shame on it! Peter Burt\n\nFRANK CHACKSFIELD & HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nImmortal Classics / Immortal Lullabies [Highlights]\n\nClair de lune, Minuet in G, The Swan, Salut d’amour, Waltz of the flowers, Liebestraum no.3 in A flat major, Melody in F, Morning song, Humoresque, Air on the G string, Valse d’Été / Sweet and low, Sleep, my baby, sleep, An Eriskay love lilt, Mighty lak’ a rose, Slumber Song, Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra! [That’s an Irish lullaby], Lorelei, Golden slumbers, Viennese Lullaby, Brahms’ Lullaby\n\nVocalion CDLK 4384 [78:09]The first album is another foray into the world of classical music by a light music orchestra, as well played as you would expect from this source. And where else would you hear this kind of programme on disc nowadays? Both albums were originally released as mono LPs in 1951 and 1952 respectively on Decca’s ‘Ace of Clubs’ label. Here they are remastered from the stereo tapes and are quality late night listening material, even if not quite as good as ‘Immortal Serenades’ [reviewed in JIM a year ago]. There are no booklet notes, but the CD is very good value and warmly commended. P B\n\n\"The Golden Age of Light Music\" : FROM STAGE AND SCREEN\n\nFor full tracklisting please refer to page 77 of JIM 178.\n\nGuild GLCD 5152\n\nWith the Guild Light Music series up to the fifty-second issue, we’re well and truly into the world of Show Business, and opening with a cracking recording by Geoff Love and his Orchestra of June Is Busting Out All Over from a 1957 disc. Sounds great! Henry Mancini’s theme from \"The Glenn Miller Story\" played by Jackie Brown’s Orchestra is next, but track 3 for me is a ‘show stopper’ – Geraldo and his Concert Orchestra playing a selection of Frank Loesser’s score to \"Guys and Dolls\", arranged by Roland Shaw. I’d never given Geraldo much thought before, but this track really made me sit up.It’s Only A Paper Moon and Secret Love played by the orchestras of David Rose and Robert Farnon keep up the musical flow, until the Victor Young Singing Strings take over with Alfred Newman’s theme to the film \"Anastasia\" with the composer conducting. Not having seen the film I checked it out in Halliwell’s Film Guide and apparently it marked Ingrid Bergman’s return to Hollywood after several years in Europe, and it won an Oscar. Alfred Newman was nominated as musical director. Sidney Torch and his Orchestra follow with the maestro’s own arrangement of music from Ivor Novello’s \"The Dancing Years\" played in his usual fine style, and I’m positive that Alan Bunting’s restorative treatment gives the recording that extra ‘kick’ – apart from removing unwanted hiss and crackle. As Time Goes By, featured in \"Casablanca\", but written some years earlier, is played by Ron Goodwin and his Orchestra, then Morton Gould and his Orchestra follow on track 9 playing Old Devil Moon, opening almost in oriental style then turning to a more sophisticated mood. Frank Chacksfield jollies the programme along with The Wedding Of The Painted DollI from the early sound film \"Broadway Melody\". Percy Faith goes continental with the \"Moulin Rouge\" theme Where Is Your Heart in an extended version, after which he markedly changes tempo with Show Me from \"My Fair Lady\". It’s Alfred Newman’s turn again as composer with a smooth rendition arranged by Frank Cordell of theSong From ‘Desiree’ – a very attractive theme in waltz time. This is followed by Victor Young conducting his own theme for \"Samson and Delilah\" with a powerful performance by The Paramount Symphony Orchestra. ‘Blockbuster stuff’ years before the word was bandied about! George Melachrino’s waltz theme for the film \"Dark Secret\" deserves to be better known than the film appears to be. Once again I turned to Halliwell’s Film Guide (1999 edition) to see what the rating was, but it wasn’t even mentioned. But \"So Long At The Fair\" is listed, and Benjamin Frankel’s themes (especially Carriage And Pair) follow in the famous Charles Williams Columbia recording. \"Obsession\" (1948) does appear in Halliwell but the view is that \"it was an implausible, overstretched thriller, but bearable\". However, Nino Rota’s themes, as played by the Sidney Torch Orchestra, are more than bearable – in fact they’re very attractive, and was that Arthur Sandford on the piano? \"The Passionate Friends\" from the novel by H.G. Wells is another 1948 movie, with music by Richard Addinsell and played by the Philharmonia Orchestra under that marvellous film music man Muir Mathieson. And last, but not least, a lively score by Nicholas Brodszky, arranged by Albert Sendrey, to an Anglo-American Technicolor and CinemaScope movie starring Vera Ellen and Tony Martin, described in the afore-mentioned film guide as \"a footling musical\". Forget the description: just enjoy the music, played from the soundtrack by the Associated British Studio Orchestra conducted by Louis Levy. Another excellent, well-filled Guild Light Music ‘concert’ deserving a wide audience.

For‘Strauss Waltzes’ the wonderful melodies of the waltz king and the signature string sound of the master of light orchestral music were made for each other and the 1952 album, re-made in stereo in 1958, has been a best seller in all its formats. It will no doubt gain a lot more sales in its resurrection here. Arrangements are shared between Mantovani [seven] and Cecil Milner [five]. ‘Favourites’ was one of Monty’s last original issues and is a delightful amalgam from 1977 of material hitherto unreleased, or that had not achieved album status, or had only been issued on the Continent. ‘Magic’is from 11 years earlier and was described in Monty’s biography¹ as \"a cracker of an album.\" Consequently, it went to No.3 in the LP charts – imagine that happening today! The great man himself is the piano soloist on his own composition of Cara Mia. Another early stereo release from1959, ‘Concert Encores’, is a nice souvenir for those of us who attended Monty’s live performances at the Royal Festival Hall and around the country. Mantovani again arranged seven of the items, Milner two, and Respighi the joyful Rossini Can-Can. With generous timings, both CDs are easily recommendable.

A few years ago Reader’s Digest put out a British Music Classical CD set including some light music by Eric Coates, Frederic Curzon and Ronald Binge. The present 3-disc British Light Music set offers a very good transfer to CD of some old favourites from across the spectrum with an occasional transfer into light classical, including a complete performance of Elgar’s Nursery Suite conducted by the composer – well transferred, but with too little space between movements. As regards light music composers none of the 1924 birthday set are included, but Charles Williams, Robert Farnon and Sidney Torch are well represented. There are a couple of errors as regards the list of recordings - the version of Shooting Star is not the Columbia one as stated, but the earlier Chappell; also the performance of Edward White’s Caprice for Strings is not the London Promenade version, but the later replacement by Dolf van der Linden which Paxton substituted some years later. Generally, apart from a rogue sentence in the sleeve note, the whole set is very well produced although – as mentioned in the last issue – most (but not all) of the items are available much cheaper elsewhere.

The two albums on this well-filled CD first appeared in 1973 and 1975 respectively. They were recorded following Ray Martin’s 15 year sojourn in the United States and in style bear little relationship to the two earlier ‘In the Martin Manner’ CDs on this label. In his informative booklet notes Oliver Lomax refers to \"Martin’s skilful, hip arrangements\", so you know what to expect. Film ’74, Sale of the Century, and Star Trek on Vol.2 are previously unissued. There is also a new arrangement of Martin’s [aka Marshall Ross] own Top of the Form [\"Marching Strings\"] that is not particularly to my liking. Although all well played and recorded, I felt a modicum of disappointment with this release. P B\n\nGEORGE MELACHRINO & HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nThe Immortal Ladies / Under Western Skies\n\nSweet Sue, Liza, Mona Lisa, Dolores, Louise, Laura, Rosalie, Irene, Maria, Sally, Chloe, Dinah / Home on the range, Wagon wheels, Riders in the sky, The last round-up, Colorado River, Cool water, San Francisco, Tumbling tumbleweeds, The one-armed bandit [Nevada], Empty saddles, Red River Valley, Northwest trail\n\nVocalion CDNJT 5205 [71:17]\n\nThis is the third Melachrino CD we have had from Vocalion recently, so perhaps they are hoping to do for him what they have done so successfully for Mantovani. Although his music making is less distinctive, Melachrino might well be the connoisseurs’ orchestra of choice. First is a mono album from 1956 with an imaginative programme and good sound. The second is from a year later and in stereo apart from the last three tracks. The original LP was given three stars and rated demonstration-worthy in the old Stereo Record Guide, and I would imagine sounds even better here. The arrangements are never less than interesting and especially descriptive are the three pieces Melachrino himself composed [San Francisco, The one-armed bandit and Northwest trail] after visiting the American West. Top trombonist Lad Busby wrote the vivid Colorado River. The hornist’s contribution throughout is engaging and this is altogether a most enjoyable disc, possibly the pick of the CDs I have reviewed this time. P B\n\nPALM COURT SOUVENIRS – Celebrating Victoria's Edwardian Heritage\n\nPalm Court Light Orchestra Conductor Charles Job with Kenneth Lavigne [tenor]The Boulevardier, Moonlight Dance, Poem, Brown bird singing, Rendez-Vous, Bal masque, Karisma, Love's old sweet song, Down the Mall, Fairy on the clock, Piccadilly promenade, Phantom Melody, Macushla, In the shade of the palms, The Dicky Bird Hop, Dusk, Because, Colonel Bogey\n\nCD004 [65:06]\n\nThe term \"Palm Court\" probably originates from the early days of radio when a small orchestra would give weekly concerts of light music from the Grand Hotel, Eastbourne, on a stage bedecked with palm trees. In later years these concerts would transfer to the studio and be broadcast under the title 'Grand Hotel.’ Traditionally the orchestra, which became known as the Palm Court Orchestra, consisted of about nine players with the leader playing his violin at the front of the stage. It was a programme of refined, genteel light music, perhaps at times a little insipid, with rather too much emphasis on nostalgic old melodies which appealed mostly to its older listeners. This recording, which has been privately produced in Canada, retains many of the elements of the Palm Court era and, whilst certainly including some of the sentimental numbers associated with the idiom, also gives us plenty of contrast with a wide range of light music, including many personal favourites such as The Boulevardier, Fairy on the clock, Bal masque, Henry Croudson's Piccadilly promenade and Reginald King's gorgeous In the shade of the palms. There is also a delightful Herman Finck compositionMoonlight Dance, which I must confess is new to me, but I considered one of the best items on the disc.The Palm Court Light Orchestra was formed by Charles Job in 1986 and is regarded as Canada’s Premier Light Orchestra. Charles is the first to admit that, despite its title, it really is a theatre orchestra rather than a Palm Court Orchestra, having twenty-six players and incorporating a brass section, which curiously includes a bass trombone rather than a tenor. Indeed their only tenor is the guest vocalist Kenneth Lavigne who sings four songs.\n\nI have to say that, right from the outset, this orchestra really impressed me. The tight ensemble and crisp performance on this CD suggests an orchestra which not only enjoys what it is playing, but has complete confidence in its conductor. How nice to hear a contemporary orchestra which is happy to play music in the manner intended by its composers. Highly recommended to all light music aficionados!

Although I missed the colouring of a full orchestra the music avoids sounding \"samey\" by the variety of the pieces played. They go from marches to waltzes, from tangos to swing. I especially enjoyed Jack Strachey’s Party Mood as a reminder of George Elrick on the BBC radio programme ‘Housewives’ Choice’, a fine Chanson de Matin [not a bad composer, that Elgar], the classic piano ragCanadian Capers, George Auric’s descriptive Heart of Paris and Heykens’ bouncy Stänchen [Serenade]. A reviewer in another place who, unlike me, is well-versed in all things accordion has written that \"the music is very well arranged and the playing is of a high order.\" That’s good enough for me. And I rate the recording tiptop, too. P B\n\nAvailable for £10 + £1 postage & packing from Peter Ayers, 40, St Michaels Way, Brundall, NORWICH, NR13 5PF.

The music is uniformly great withMy isle of golden dreams, Drifting and dreaming, and Nelson’s title number being the most beautiful tracks. And from ‘Love Tide’, another wonderful album from about 1961, we have the title track (also written by Nelson Riddle), Ill wind and the haunting Take me into your arms capping the list of musical therapy one could ever have in one lifetime. The transfer to CD preserves the original balances which were always great on Capitol. What Nelson Riddle could have accomplished had Capitol or Reprise let him write his soul! Unfortunately, EMI is deleting much of its magical catalogue in this series, including Paul Weston’s masterworks, as well as of this gentle master, Nelson Riddle. Maybe EMI can be persuaded to just let us have a few more times with these exquisite masterpieces in sound! Richard Jessen\n\n[Although this is obviously not a new release and has been reviewed in JIM before, we share Richard’s enthusiasm for the CD and have included it in view of his concluding sentence.]\n\nAMBROSE & HIS ORCHESTRA Hors D’Oeuvres\n\nPlain Jane, Early morning blues, A Burmese ballet, Hullabaloo, Deep Henderson, Message from Mars, Swinganola, Hick Stomp. Embassy Stomp, Champagne cocktail, B’wanga … and 14 others\n\nVocalion CDVS 1959 [74:03]Here is another of this label’s reissues selling for an almost unbelievable £2.99. The tracks originate from the ten years up to 1945. Many of them were composed by Sid Phillips, including eight of those listed above. Fire Dance is by classical composer de Falla. The Rhythm Sisters are the vocalists on W.C. Handy’s Memphis blues, featured soloists are clarinettists Carl Barriteau on Dance of the potted puppet and Reginald Kell on Swing low, sweet clarinet. Although [Bert] Ambrose was always reckoned to use the best musicians around, I am unable to identify the personnel here as there are no booklet notes [understandably so at the price] but in his time Ambrose included such luminaries as Ted Heath, Lew Stone, Stanley Black, and George Shearing.

I understand that good sales were achieved last Christmas and that the proceeds will help \"The Army\" in its so worthwhile charitable work. The playing is obviously of a very high standard and the repertoire is varied. The added percussion did at times come close to irritating me. The timing of the CD is nowhere near as generous as the cause it supports.

As an exponent (of sorts) of both instruments you can guess where I stand! Many people of my age group remember the regular cinema organ spots on the Light Programme – notably the 10am slot most weekday mornings in the Fifties featuring the likes of William Davies, Lloyd Thomas, Gerald Shaw, Robinson Cleaver and Robin Richmond, who later presented a weekly show entitled 'The Organist Entertains'. Well, that programme is still going but for many years it has been in the capable hands of Nigel Ogden, who is the featured artist on this CD which contains a plethora of tuneful melodies, mostly in the form of medleys. One such medley is ‘Songs of the Sixties’ which, in his accompanying notes, Nigel Ogden describes as \"one of the greatest decades for popular song\". Personally, I have always considered this period as being the beginning of the end of popular music. Fortunately, for this selection, Nigel has chosen [for the most part] some of the better tunes. There is a curiously titled item called Happy birthday dear Eliza which is based on Beethoven's Für Elise, that I have always disliked ever since being forced to play it in piano lessons as a child! I have often found over the years that cinema organists, [even some of the best known] have a habit of rushing passages and getting out of tempo. There is none of this, however, in Nigel Ogden's performances which are really first class! This is an entertaining and well-played recording, packed with good tunes which will appeal to all enthusiasts of this giant of musical instruments. Brian Reynolds\n\nARNELL The Great Detective / The Angels – Ballet Music\n\nBBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Martin Yates\n\nDutton Epoch CDLX 7208 [66:17]Richard Anthony Sayer Arnell, or Tony to his friends, is considered by many to be our leading symphonist. Beecham recorded his ‘Punch and the Child’ in 1950 with the RPO and described Arnell as \"one of the best orchestrators since Berlioz…\" Having been educated at the Hall School, Hampstead, and University College School, Arnell entered the Royal College of Music in 1935, where he studied composition with John Ireland and piano with St. John Dykes. Vaughan Williams was chair of the panel that awarded him the Farrar Prize for Composition in 1938. He spent a number of years in America where his music was championed by Bernard Herrmann and other conductors and a number of his major works received performances. Back in England after World War II, Beecham became a patron, but Arnell’s prominence eventually faded when composers of anything considered \"tuneful\" were consigned to near-oblivion by the musical fashion-police, principally William Glock, Controller of Radio 3 [1959-73].Both of these ballets were commissioned by Sadler’s Wells and appear for the first time on CD. ‘The Great Detective’ [1953] is a witty comedic ballet based on the great fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The ballet opens in sparkling fashion and no one can be in any doubt as to the skill of the composer as an orchestrator. The humorousDistressed Ladies episode is reminiscent of the ballet music of Constant Lambert, while the melodramatic Fiends and Villains could well have been written for an old silent film. The Dance of Deduction is another witty episode and the whole work is eventually brought to a satisfying conclusion by a big tune and a few remaining musical heroic afterthoughts.\n\n‘The Angels’ (1957) is more of a substantial piece which takes the form of a three movement symphony. The original scenario is abstract, but concerns a life-giving angel who brings men and women together, selects one of them for immortality and makes them shine with heavenly light. It is a powerful work and seems well suited for the concert hall. Of particular note is the extended centralRoundelay movement – one of Arnell’s most beautiful and inspired slow movements – and here the influence of his extended stay in the US is clearly evident, with echoes of his American contempories, Aaron Copland and Roy Harris.There is much to enjoy on this CD, and for those tempted to explore Arnell further I can thoroughly recommend the Third Symphony (Dutton Epoch CDLX 7161) – a stirring masterful work which has received universal praise. The artwork/sleeve design and copious liner notes make for an attractive package and both the recording and performance from Martin Yates and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra are of a high standard. An essential purchase for anyone interested in British orchestral repertoire of the \"lost generation\" and full marks to Vocalion for making Arnell’s music available to us after decades of neglect. Incidentally, Arnell is now in his nineties and lives in a Musicians’ Benevolent home in Kent where he continues to compose. Malcolm Osman\n\n\"The Golden Age of Light Music\" : STRINGS AND THINGS GO STEREO!\n\nFor full tracklisting please refer to page 76 of this issue.\n\n\"Strings And Things Go Stereo\" is the first 100% stereo selection in the Guild Light Music series but if, like me, sound technology isn’t your first priority – fear not – the music’s grand and so are the orchestras! Beginning with the curtain opening on Victor Young’s theme to \"Around The World in Eighty Days\" played by The Cinema Sound Stage Orchestra - and I’d suggest a brighter, breezier recording than the composer’s own version. Still with show music A Wonderful Guy from \"South Pacific\" (without Mary Martin!) played in fine style by Warren Barker’s Orchestra; I’m afraid I’d never heard of him but thanks to David’s inclusion, and his booklet notes, I have now! Following on from the Rio Carnival Orchestra’s rendition of Brazil is The Trolley Song, originally sung in a similar style by Judy Garland in \"Meet Me In St. Louis\" – this time played by Buddy Bregman and his Orchestra, but renamed for the original album ‘The Conrad Salinger Orchestra’ in honour of the esteemed arranger responsible. Two more film titles Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing and Change Partners(coupled with Mandy) played by Mantovani and Frank De Vol respectively continue this very entertaining programme; then a restful Tahiti: A Summer Night At Sea by Les Baxter is followed by a smoochie Harlem Nocturne with Norrie Paramor and his Orchestra. First Row Centre by Joe Reisman (any relation to Leo Reisman?) gets the feet tapping again before being lured into Alfred Newman’sStreet Scene with the New World Theatre Orchestra. Then in complete contrast we step straight into the Chappell catalogue with Tony Tamburello’s Saucy Sailor, although it first appeared several years earlier on a US Everest LP as Naughty Nautical, which is how it is listed on this CD. Robert Farnon is conducting his Orchestra in London, although at the time he was still under contract to Decca so the LP credited ‘The Everest Concert Orchestra under the direction of Derek Boulton’ (Bob’s manager!). A super piece of cheery mood music. There’s No You, a romantically tuneful concoction as played by Nelson Riddle, is followed by Morton Gould and his Orchestra with a seductive version of Orchids In The Moonlight written by Vincent Youmans from the RKO film \"Flying Down To Rio\". It was sung by Raul Roullen to either Ginger Rogers or Dolores del Rio, but I can’t remember which and it doesn’t say on the soundtrack LP I have! Track 14 has David Carroll and his Orchestra with Ron Goodwin’sSwinging Sweethearts but we in Britain know it as Skiffling Strings – thence to Victor Schertzinger’sSand In My Shoes with the Melachrino Strings. It was featured in the 1941 film \"Kiss The Boys Goodbye\" starring Don Ameche, Mary Martin and Connee Boswell. Hubert Bath’s Cornish Rhapsody, written for Margaret Lockwood to appear to play (but actually recorded for the soundtrack of the 1944 film \"Love Story\" by Harriet Cohen) is played here by pianists Rawicz and Landauer with Mantovani and his Orchestra – and a very nice performance and recording from all involved. And staying with Hubert Bath, I wonder if David would consider issuing his march Admiral’s All on Boosey & Hawkes 1930s Archive, and his other two nautical pieces on Paxton – Threatening Waves and Ode To the Sea. They deserve a wider audience for this neglected composer. Lucky In The Rain gets a really spirited performance from Robert Farnon and his Orchestra, as does Hal Mooney’s Orchestra playing his own composition Gemini - another piece that could easily come from a mood music catalogue – as could Pavement Pigalle from Joseph Kuhn, a name familiar to anybody with Golden Guinea 101 Strings LPs in their collection. It graces track 19 and is played by the Paris Theatre Orchestra. My LP copy is in mono, but on this CD – like all the tracks – it is in stereo. Canadian Sunset and Saraband are both pretty familiar, but Phil Boutet and his Orchestra playing Evening Starnot so – until I realised that it’s actually an arrangement of O Star Of Eve from Tannhauser by Wagner. The Clebanoff Strings play La Seduccion in a smoth manner, but Leo Shuken’s Spring Madness is alternately spritely then almost pastoral, ending as it began in vigorous style. And finallyThe Song Is Ended by Irving Berlin – a fitting tribute to another fine selection of concert items – which I’m sure the national BBC stations will ignore as usual, but anybody with any musical sense will add to their CD shelf immediately! Ken Wilkins\n\n\"The Golden Age of Light Music\" : MUSICAL KALEIDOSCOPE - Volume 3\n\nFor full tracklisting please refer to page 77 of this issue.\n\nGuild GLCD 5154\n\nWith expectations high I put \"Musical Kaleidoscope – Volume 3\" in the CD player and sat back – and I wasn’t disappointed. Three spectacular pieces to open, the first being Charles Williams’ Winged Messenger in which I thought I could detect strains of his Sons Of The Air on Chappell C209. David Ades writes in the booklet notes that Winged Messenger was used extensively by US networks NBC and ABC in the late 1950s and early 1960s as programme promo music and theme music for radio shows and I can understand why! A very powerful opener – as is track 2 Baden Baden, a grand theatrical-type march which develops into a galop, then simmers down to a definite finale. I’d never heard of the composer ‘Raymond’ but he (she?) wrote a good tune and it is very well played by the Baden Baden Symphony Orchestra – now known, according to David’s notes, as the South West German Radio Symphony Orchestra. The third ‘blockbuster’ on the CD is Holiday For Trombones by David Rose with him conducting in fine fettle. A novelty number by Kermit Leslie is next, which he calls Jalopy and includes a recording of one (a Model T Ford, perhaps?); then in complete contrast a smoochie piece Just For Two by Raymond Ellis and arranged by Angela Morley, rather similar to Dolf van der Linden’s Lady Of Leisure on Paxton. Track 6 is White from ‘Tone Poems Of Color’ by Victor Young; I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it turned out to be a delightful piece of concert music with a sleigh bells opening – very nice indeed. Another great novelty piece to follow – this time Ronald Binge’s Tales Of The Three Blind Mice played by Sidney Torch for the American transcription service Lang-Worth conducting what seems to me to be a slightly larger orchestra than usual, but I could be mistaken. Jack Strachey is another composer featured, and I’m very pleased that David included an unfairly neglected theatre march Shaftesbury Avenue from the Bosworth library – equal, I think, to his more famous Theatreland (already featured on two Guild CDs by B&H’s New Concert Orchestra – GLCD 5102, and Harry Fryer in Decca’s Music While You Work series – GLCD 5137). Irving Berlin’sLady Of The Evening is arranged by Peter Yorke and played by his Concert Orchestra in its usual immaculate manner, followed by Robert Farnon’s Playtime with the Telecast Ensemble and Bob at the piano (replacing the session pianist who wasn’t up to scratch!). I’ve got the Chappell 78 of this piece, and I wondered how long it would be before Alan and David included this number in the Guild Light Music series. Actually David tells me it was a special request from an RFS member! Forgive my ignorance, but I didn’t recognise Domani until Richard Hayman and his Orchestra struck up on track 14, and then the tune became very familiar; but Valse Bluette by Drigo sounds very different to my George Melachrino LP recording, as played here by Victor Young and his Orchestra with trumpeter Rafael Mendez doing his stuff. Harry Fryer was a great light music conductor and he makes a splendid job of Roger Barsotti’s march Banners of Victory. Between That’s All by Bob Haymes and Gershwin’s Swannee is Ecstasy by Otto Cesana and played by his orchestra. A lush melody that could easily find a place in any publisher’s mood music catalogue. Rudy Vallee co-wrote Deep Nightpresumably for himself to sing, and I have an LP of him doing just that – but here it’s played by the Pittsburgh Strings in fine form. Captain Of The Guard was new to me, but La Muse Legere wasn’t, as I’ve had the 78 since it was issued – but I particularly liked Captain Of The Guard and I’m told that it was also a special request, like several more in this collection. Alla Marcia from Sibelius’ ‘Karelia Suite’ and Sinding’s Rustle Of Spring are both very familiar concert items, but Gabriel Pierne’sSerenade not so – at least to me, but very tuneful all the same as played by the Andre Kostelanetz Orchestra. Henry Litolffs’ Scherzo played here by Winifred Atwell is a real eye-opener, especially as she was more identified with her honky-tonk ‘joanna’! And finally two ‘bonus tracks’: Desperate Moment and Sinister Street No. 1 from the De Wolfe library – two good examples of dramatic music used in the Two Ronnies’ comedy serial \"The Phantom Raspberry Blower Of Old London Town\". If David would like some more suggestions for dramatic items perhaps he’d consider East Of Malta by Ronald Hanmer and Jack Beaver’s The Sword Of Damocles – both from the FDH library for inclusion on future Guild CDs. This is altogether a very satisfying and melodic addition to the series and Alan Bunting’s magical restorations are first class as usual! Ken Wilkins\n\nMAURICE BLOWER SYMPHONY IN C MAJOR\n\nHavant Symphony Orchestra conducted by Peter Craddock\n\nwith Elgar: Wand Of Youth Suite No.2, and Brahms: Academic Festival Overture [57:00]\n\nStrange bedfellows? Not really because all three offerings are tuneful delights but, while the latter two are well known, the former piece is a rarity indeed with a fascinating story behind it. Blower died in 1982 and some time later his son Thomas, pottering around in the loft, discovered a symphony which had lain unpublished and unperformed since it was completed in the pre-war summer of 1939. A few years ago he transcribed it into Sibelius software and, with the help of conductor Peter Craddock, set-up the full score for a première performance given in Fareham by the Havant Symphony Orchestra, which took place in March 2008. It was duly recorded for posterity and is now available for £8 from Sandra Craddock, 152 West Street, Havant, PO9 1LP; cheques payable to \"HADOS.\" This is a jolly piece of music which will appeal to all Robert Farnon lovers.

All the transcriptions by the old musical magician Leopold Stokowski are very come-at-able and as well as the 11 originating from Bach there are half-a-dozen others, eminently tuneful, by Palestrina, Byrd, Jeremiah Clarke [the Trumpet Voluntary tune], Boccherini [Minuet, used in Ealing Films’ ‘The Ladykillers’], Mattheson and Haydn [the well-known Andante Cantabile]. Buy and enjoy! P B\n\nDAVID NADIEN Beethoven & Mendelssohn Violin Concertos [US] Cembal d’amour CD 137[67:31] To many readers of this review, David Nadien may seem an odd choice for inclusion. Yet he was the leader (or concertmaster) of the recording orchestra Robert Farnon arranged and conducted for Tony Bennett on his famous ‘Snowfall’ Christmas album of nearly 40 years ago. At the time of that distinguished recording, David Nadien had been the leader of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra since 1966 and would be at that post until 1971. Nadien is still with us and occasionally plays in public. On this CD he shows just how insightful of a performer he truly can be in the heavier forms of music. The Beethoven Concerto is considered (with the Brahms) as a test of endurance of the player, for it is nearly as long as a symphony and just as demanding. David lends a special insight and feeling into this very emotional performance. He was aided in this 1952 performance by Leon Barzin and his college level National Orchestral Association. The Mendelssohn Concerto is a case of the soloist bringing a group of unknown musicians, the Chappaqua Orchestra under Wolfgang Schanzer, up to his level of conception. Again, there is a very strong bond between orchestra members and soloist that gives us a rare moment of psychic purity in which each participant accompanies each other with perfect balance. Although this may be a hard to obtain CD, the musical rewards and soothing sound of David Nadien’s artistry combine to create a marvelous listening experience seldom found in today’s musical world.

Familiar favourites are mixed with some less well-known numbers, and the players’ enthusiasm which they display towards their repertoire is certainly infectious. Unlike sixty or seventy years ago, there are few examples of small ensembles playing light music these days, so it is good to know that this more genteel style still survives today.David Ades\n\nJOPLIN The Easy Winners & Other Rag-Time Music\n\nPREVIN A Different Kind Of Blues\n\nItzhak Perlman [violin], André Previn, Shelly Manne [pianos], Jim Hall [bass], Red Mitchell [guitar]The Rag-Time Dance, The Easy Winners, Bethena [A Concert Waltz], Magnetic Rag, The Strenuous Life [Rag-Time Two-Step], The Entertainer, Elite Syncopations, Solace, Pine Apple Rag, Sugar Cane / Look at him go, Little Face, Who Reads Reviews, Night Thoughts, A Different Kind of Blues, Chocolate Apricot, The Five of Us, Make Up Your Mind\n\nEMI Encore 2357272 [78:06]A well-filled low-priced disc with premium performers. Ragtime swept the world between c1897-1920, its syncopated melodies set against a march-type bass line. Scott Joplin was thought of as its greatest composer. Here the violin and piano of a classical \"dream team\" does him full justice on this 1974 album. The Previn piece, from 1980, anticipated the rash of \"crossover\" albums by classical artists from the late ‘80s onwards and is most enjoyable, with the violin virtuoso clearly taking to the jazz idiom at his first attempt. Previn is reunited with fellow pianist Shelly Manne, reminding us of their classic ‘My Fair Lady’ album [recently reissued with final restoration and remastering by Alan Bunting] on Retrospective RTR 4122.

The 28-page booklet contains comprehensive notes, but you will need to understand French! However the full tracklisting details give alternate titles in English where appropriate and this is a wonderful opportunity to become acquainted with talented pianists from France and Germany that may be unfamiliar to you. Highly recommended for those who enjoy popular piano music from the 1950s. David Ades This collection is available from the RFS Record Service to special order. The price is likely to be in the region of £20 but may vary due to current volatility in the currency markets.\n\nBENNY GOODMAN SEXTET Slipped Disc 1945 – 1946\n\nAfter you’ve gone; Slipped disc, Rachel’s dream, I got rhythm … plus 14 more songs\n\nColumbia CK 44292 [53:18]Probably one of the unique sounds in the history of jazz was Benny Goodman’s performances with small groups ranging in size from trios to quartets and finally into sextets. Although many prize the Charlie Christian sets (and they are justifiable classics), Goodman in the 1940's had lost none of his touch and continued to record for Columbia some magnificent performances. One that sticks out isAfter you’ve gone which has a great Slam Stewart singing solo on his bass along with crisp playing from vibist Red Norvo. Slipped disc is another fabulous item found on this disc, relating as it does to Goodman’s constant back pains. The music just ripples along like a happy, babbling brook aided in no small part by Teddy Wilson sitting at the piano and dispensing his famous crisp, articulate piano. The engineering from the original recordings is as perfect as can be had on this side of paradise. And of course, this is music for putting one in the mood for the happiest of all days Richard Jessen\n\nDANIEL SMITH Blue Bassoon\n\nThe Jody grind, The double up, Sack of woe, Things ain’t what they used to be, My baby’s gone, Billie’s bounce, Nostalgia in Times Square, Equinox, Scotch and water, From four till late, Break out the blues, Footprints, Solid\n\nLabel & release date to be announced [47:50]\n\nI am not a musician so maybe I am missing something. As I said when reviewing Daniel’s previous CD, ‘The Swinging Bassoon’, his technique is marvellous but as a solo instrument the bassoon in this setting sounds incongruous. The number of musicians has been increased and once again the compositions are all written by veterans of the jazz scene, most no longer around. I can only guess if they would approve of their music with this treatment. One thing is for sure, none of these tunes were written for a bassoon! The CD arrived with an impressive list of accolades from jazz critics with more knowledge than me. I can only repeat the first sentence of this review. Paul Clatworthy\n\nAL BOWLLY This Is Romance\n\nDouble CD, 52 titles\n\nSounds of Yesteryear DSOY756 [77:05 & &9:14]Fans of Bowlly, who is believed to have influenced many singers in his short lifetime, really get their money’s worth here! The songs are with the bands of Lew Stone, Ray Noble and Geraldo. Most personnel are listed; interestingly the Lew Stone orchestra had Stanley Black and Monia Liter, who later found fame on their own, in its ranks. Recordings date between 1932 and 1939. I was not born until four years after the first was made, so the only titles I was familiar with were Ray Noble’s The touch of your lips, Irving Berlin’s Top hat, Harold Arlen’s As long as I live, and Mack Gordon’s Did you ever see a dream walking. Transfers are painstaking good by John Bennett. Put in on your shopping list for Grandma’s next birthday.

Popular singing par excellence. The music is enhanced by extremely comprehensive booklet notes. P B\n\nDORIS DAY TODAY A Musical Comedy Special [DVD]BMG 88697176059 [1hr 30 mins]I must admit to having a fondness for music specials and especially anything with Doris Day makes my day. In the waning days of music specials, CBS-TV telecast ‘Doris Day Today’ in 1975. Sadly, this was to be Day’s last major network special. Happily, this is a fun special showing off Day’s talents as actress, comedian and, most importantly, singer. There are vibrant duets with John Denver including probably the greatest filmed performance seen anywhere of songs associated with each performer. There are also comedy sketches with Rich Little offering up his vast repertoire of celebrity impersonations (he was one of the best) as the leading man in the many films Day was involved with, with humour. Another great comedian was Tim Conway who was known for cutting up hilariously with the late Harvey Korman on ‘The Carol Burnett Show.’ Here he has a funny sketch with Doris Day where they are stuck out in the middle of nowhere close to the Grand Canyon. Not only are both hilarious but also there is a brief appearance by Day’s best friend Biggest (a very large but very dignified male poodle). But it’s the music and voice that carries this excellently produced show. There is an update with very fast, edited costume change of the Cole Porter classic Anything goes, a very soulful performance of Day by day from ‘Godspell’ done as only Doris Day could do with a song. The most moving performance is The way we were, where all of Day’s male co-stars are remembered in a deeply emotional performance. There are also extras such as Doris Day’s appearance on the John Denver Show in 1974, 1940's musical short with Les Brown as well as data on her movies and many recordings. This DVD is available on both sides of the Atlantic. Thank you Doris Day for being the wonderful performer and human being you have always been. Here’s hoping you will be around for a few years more!

AVID AMSC 966 2-CD set. 66 tracks, total timing 157:19 mins.\"Glamorous, dynamic, and an international sex symbol, Pat Kirkwood was for two decades the undisputed queen of British stage and screen musicals, with a voice rivalling that of Broadway’s Ethel Merman. Cole Porter, Noël Coward and Leonard Bernstein chose her to play the leading roles in their musicals, and her performances in 15 pantomimes caused a leading critic to hail her as ‘the greatest Principal Boy of the 20th century’. When she died on Christmas Day 2007, the world-wide media coverage focussed on two things: her fabulous legs, once described by Kenneth Tynan as ‘the eighth wonder of the world’, and her rumoured relationship with Prince Philip, a source of feverish speculation by royal biographers and gossip columnists for 60 years. This historic double CD, released by AVID Entertainment to mark the first anniversary of her death, spans 56 years of her glittering career, from her first film at the age of 17, to her last stage appearance in 1994. It features no fewer than 29 performances that have never previously been released on CD. These include a duet with her Hollywood co-star, Van Johnson, recordings she made in the United States, which were never issued in Britain, rare soundtrack footage from her 1950s screen musicals, and five songs in live performance in 1993.Along the way are superlative interpretations of all-time great standards by Cole Porter, Noël Coward, Rodgers and Hart, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein, Jule Styne, Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. This superb compilation not only encapsulates the magic of Pat Kirkwood, and of one of the great show business talents, but also the history of the musical in the 20th century.\" The above details (copied from Avid publicity) give a fair description of the wide-ranging repertoire to be enjoyed in this collection, expertly compiled by Hugh Palmer, who was also responsible for similar recent collections from Avid featuring Jessie Matthews and Frances Day. As well as commercial and private recordings, there are soundtrack excerpts which should delight film buffs. If you are a fan of Pat Kirkwood you will not hesitate to add this to your collection. The well illustrated booklet is packed with information. A top quality product at a very reasonable price.David Ades This 2-CD set is available from the RFS Record Service price £9.00.\n\nKATHERINE JENKINS Sacred Arias\n\nAbide With Me, Pie Jesu, The Lord’s My Shepherd, Down in the River to Pray, May The Good Lord Bless and Keep You, Hallelujah, Panis Angelicus, In Paradisum, Silent Night, Ave Maria, Misa Criolla: Kyrie, Agnus Dei\n\nUCJ 476 697-2 [48:24]The lovely young mezzo-soprano returns to her Welsh church roots with this album. I guess the booklet’s photographic studies of Miss Jenkins add value to the package, but less than 50 minutes of music is a bit meagre for a top price disc. What we have, however, is very good. The Pie Jesus is by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and the Lord is my shepherd is the Howard Goodall version used in ‘The Vicar of Dibley.’ Meredith Wilson wrote May the good Lord and Hallelujah [versions of which were at Nos. 1 and 2 in the pop chart last Christmas] is by Leonard Cohen. Particularly winsome is the old spiritualDown in the river to pray, one of eight tracks enhanced by The Crouch End Festival Chorus. Another standout track is Simon Lindle’s Ave Maria with The Redolfus Choir, who also accompany on three others including the poignant Agnus Dei by Samuel Barber. P B\n\nMARY MAYO Dancing In The Dark\n\nMolly Malone, Waiting, Just a wearyin’ for you, It seemed so right last night, Dark is the night.

Whilst they were both members of the Beneke-Miller Band, bass player and arranger Al Ham fell under her spell and they married. Some of the songs have not been heard for many a year; five are from films, seven recorded with the Tex Beneke Band, the remainder with the bands of Al Ham, Glenn Osser and Ray Wright. Some tracks are a little \"Rinky Dink\"; others more worthy of her marvellous voice, especially when linked with a large orchestra. I was most intrigued to find a Pete Rugolo written Bring back the thrill, one I had never heard before. The last \"live\" track is obviously from her later years reunited with the Beneke Orchestra. Charming nostalgia most of the way.

This excellently recorded CD is well worth its £5 price to RFS members. Admittedly John McLain’s undoubted lyrical impulse (John is an RFS member), whether in songs or piano solos (which are effectively songs without words) produces results which are very similar in mood and tempo, so it is perhaps as well that contrast is offered by vocals and instrumentals composed by others, which are among the classics of the light music genre. Performances are highly enjoyable; Mr. Pullin’s delivery and diction are notably clear (all tracks are sung in English – words are not supplied in the insert but are really unnecessary), and Miss Manning’s playing, whether solo or in accompaniment, is expressive, fluent and full of character.

Several of them can be heard today, but there are many which are not (there were about 130 in all); this disc concentrates on the less well-known of those written between 1912 and 1943. Only Bird Songs and (sung here appropriately in a ‘Mummerset’ accent) A Dinder Courtship are at all familiar to most of us, so this release does fill a gap. Further, Peter Dempsey has a limpid, fluent delivery and notably clear diction while Guy Rowland is a sympathetic, positive accompanist; his solo piano version of By The Sleepy Lagoon (presumably arranged by the composer) recalls that many light orchestral favourites could, at one time, be found in the domestic piano stool. Some of these songs sound like other, better known ballads by Coates, but this is common enough in balladry and there is much variety here. We catch an Irish flavour in The Fairy Tales of Ireland; there is a popular, up-tempo character in the title song and the splendidly non-PC Little Snoozy Coon. Sigh No More Ladies ranks high for me in the centuries of Shakespearian vocal heritage, and the last two songs – one to Coates’ own words – movingly recall that he continued penning songs into the Second World War. Recording is admirably clear, and presentation thoughtful. These tuneful imaginations are sure to give pleasure, as they have done to this reviewer. Philip L. Scowcroft This CD is available from PETER DEMPSEY, 44 Victoria Road, Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, B50 4AR, England – price £11.99 [including p&p].\n\nPIGS COULD FLY Children’s Choir Music\n\nNew London Children’s Choir conducted by Ronald Corp\n\nSongs by Skempton, Britten, Corp, Bennett, Bliss, Tavener, Vaughan Williams, Maxwell Davies, Chilcott, Bliss, Rutter, Godfrey, Maw, etc.\n\nNaxos 8.572113 [66:07]\n\nThe conductor is well known to tuneful music lovers for several CDs of light music and this choir, which he formed in 1991, is a companion to his New London Orchestra. The repertoire is wide and varied, ranging from lively short pieces to more serious sacred music, with several more in between; 35 different songs in all. The diction is good and for anyone who likes to hear children’s voices then this is a welcome addition to the relatively small catalogue of that genre. Edmund Whitehouse\n\nAN EVENING WITH BEATRICE LILLIE Original Cast\n\n20 tracks including Rhythm, Nanette, Folk Song Cycle, Weary of it all, Piccolo Marina, There are times, Paint, Maud, There are fairies at the bottom of our garden, The party’s over now\n\nSepia 1123 [78:51]A unique artiste but, possibly, something of an acquired taste. In addition to the above there are seven other tracks including Three little fishies, from the show ‘Auntie Bea’ with an orchestra directed by Eric Rogers. If you are not a Miss Lillie fan, the disc is worth acquiring for her co-star Reginald Gardiner’s classic Decca single Trains [ah, memories!] Nobody should complain about value for money here. Ray Pavene\n\nIRMA LA DOUCE Original London Cast\n\nSepia 1120 [74:29]The original Parisian version of this show, music written by Marguerite Monnot, opened in November 1956 and ran for four years. This English language version opened on 17 July 1958 at London’s Lyric Theatre, where it ran for 1,512 performances starring Elizabeth Seal, Keith Michell and Clive Revill. The book and lyrics here are by Julian More, David Heneker and Monty Norman; Peter Brook directs; orchestrations are by Andre Popp; vocal arrangements by Bert Waller; and the orchestra is under the direction of Alexander Faris. Not being familiar with the show – the most recognizable track is probably Our Language of Love – I enjoyed it a lot. Also included on the disc are 11 \"Bonus Tracks\" in French. Sepia’s customary comprehensive booklet notes complete a well-filled package. Ray Pavene\n\n‘THIS RECORD IS NOT TO BE BROADCAST’: 75 records banned by the BBC 1931-57 Acrobat Music ACTRCD9015 (3CDs with booklet).\n\nIt seems rather ironic that this album should appear at a time that the BBC has been forced to review its public broadcasting standards following the recent Ross/Brand affair. Three CDs and a 48 page booklet comprise a fascinating study of 75 recordings that were effectively black-listed by the BBC during the years 1931-57. With the hindsight of living 50 years on, some of the reasons given by the ‘Dance Music Policy Committee’ for their decisions now seem ludicrous and trivial – especially when judged by what is now considered ‘entertainment’. One such directive ran: \"The BBC’s policy is to encourage a more virile and robust output of dance music to accord more closely with the present spirit of the country. To this end any form of anaemic or debilitated vocal performances by male singers will be excluded. Performance by women singers will be controlled to the extent that an insincere and over sentimental style will not be allowed. No numbers will be accepted for broadcasting which are slushy in sentiment or contain innuendo or other matter considered to be offensive.\" Thus George Formby’s With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock (1939) and Johnny Messner’sShe Had to Go and Lose It at the Astor (1938), both fell foul of the committee. In the case of the latter, both the suggestive lyrics and the fact that mentioning the Astor was tantamount to advertising were more than enough reason for an outright ban. In 1942, the BBC’s Director of Music was none other than the eminent composer Sir Arthur Bliss. Bliss was staunchly against tunes borrowed from classical works. This view led to the banning of whole albums based on classical themes. Thus in 1938 Tommy Dorsey in an arrangement of Song of India (from Rimsky-Korsakov’s Sadko) was banned and in 1942 Glen Miller’s The Story of a Starry Night (from Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony), suffered a similar fate. In the words of the committee, \"The Story of a Starry Night is not a parody, but a travesty of the original.” Not so much the Path?tique Symphony as the pathetic in fact…. Perhaps it is hardly surprising that the Spike Jones version of the Blue Danube (1945) was also banned, although this was lifted in 1947 when ‘burlesque’ became permissible but ‘dance tempo distortion’ did not! Sometimes songs were banned for purely practical reasons. Thus Bing Crosby suffered a double ban. Deep In The Heart Of Texas (1942), during working hours, in case factory hands used their tools for banging machinery to keep time with the infectious melody and in the following year I’ll Be Home For Christmas was banned for the reason that it would lower the morale of the fighting troops. There are many more such examples to be found in the lavishly illustrated informative booklet. A fascinating release and one that I think many of our members will find room for in their collection - if only as a curiosity. Copies can be obtained from Acrobat Music or from the RFS Record Service.

Much of light music stems from the styles and technique of gypsy players. You will find here – in very decent stereo – a lot of the fire and lushness associated with gypsy music, and this album must feature quite highly in the Chacksfield canon. Even if you are not \"into\" opera, the melodies by Mascagni, Puccini and Verdi on the second album are irresistible in these Italian-tinged arrangements. Here’s hoping for more reissues from this source, notably ‘Songs of Sunny Italy’. Peter Burt\n\nA Box of Light Musical Allsorts For full tracklisting details please see page the Light Music CDs pages on this website Guild GLCD 5157 77:51 mins. Where would light music enthusiasts be without Guild and a few other labels of a like mind – reissuing the sort of fare not supplied by the major record companies and radio stations? I ask this after listening to this latest Guild Light Music release, which opens in cracking style with Bob Farnon’s Orchestra and his arrangement of My Object All Sublime from \"The Hot Mikado\" – Gilbert and Sullivan (sort of!). It has a big ‘show-bizzy’ opening with, I’m sure, echoes of Bob’s Alcan Highway, leading to a swinging version of Sullivan’s well-known melody accompanying a tap dancer! A novelty indeed! Felton Rapley’s very attractive Southern Holiday and Werner Müller’s likewise Take Me To Your Heart continue this melodic programme. A dip into the Chappell catalogue brings a welcome CD release of Clive Richardson’s Mannequin Melodyand then Alfred Newman conducts his own film music to \"A Letter To Three Lives\" from a Mercury LP I’ve had since its release in 1956. Angela Morley’s tribute to Bob Farnon A Canadian In Mayfair is given a spirited performance by Sidney Torch and his Orchestra, the same recording I think David Ades included on his Sidney Torch Great British Light Orchestras HMV compilation of 1992, long deleted. Thou Swell is a catchy number from \"Words and Music\" and was sung in that film by June Allyson in 1948; here it is played by Andre Kostelanetz and his Orchestra. However the track I can’t get over is Military Samba by John McGregor, a name new to me – but it’s so infectious as played by Edmundo Ros conducting what sounds like a fairly large Concert Orchestra. I had forgotten that he’d ever recorded with such an ensemble, then I remembered his recording of Marching Strings on an earlier Guild CD which probably came from the same session. Charles Williams’ Let’s Go Shoppingplayed by the Danish State Radio Orchestra recalls newsreels and Pathé shorts of the 1950s, as doesPolka Dot by Eric Cook played by the New Concert Orchestra conducted by Cedric Dumont.Rahadlakum from \"Kismet\" was new to me although I knew the score had been adapted from Borodin’s work; here it’s played in fine concert style by Percy Faith who arranged it for his orchestra.The Happy Hippo from the Conroy Library by Eric Winstone is another catchy melody, as of course is Eric Coates’ ‘Phantasy’ \"The Three Bears\" played by the London Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Sir Charles Mackerras in 1956, although he did not receive his knighthood until 23 years later. Four more library numbers follow which take me back to the 1940s and 1950s. Melody In Moccasins by Wilfred Burns is played by Philip Green and his Orchestra on a rare MGM 78, then Fly Past by Cecil Milner (incorrectly credited to Charles Williams when Chappell resurrected it for their ‘Archive – Adventure’ CD CHAP 166). I’m very pleased with the inclusion of Horace Dann’s Worcester Beacon because my Paxton 78 copy has a very poor surface as other copies probably also have, so Alan Bunting’s excellent restoration (not a trace of surface noise) is very welcome – and he’s managed to retain what I call that unique Levy’s Sound Studios sound – wonderful! The fourth library piece in this group is St Boniface Down by Trevor Duncan. The jury’s still out on this one! And finally Noel Coward’s London Pride rounds off another great Guild Light Music CD and – as the title suggests – a veritable Box of Allsorts. Ken Wilkins\n\nWERNER MÜLLER & HIS ORCHESTRA – Teldec Archives\n\nAuf Grosser Europa-Tournee & Über Sieben Meere – Sailing Along\n\n28 titles including Das ist die Berliner, Auf der Reeperbahn nachts um halb eins, Copenhagen Polka, Tulips from Amsterdam, Lisbon Antigua, Moulin Rouge, Frühling in Wien, Münchner Kindl, Gondellied, O mia bella Napoli, Isle of Capri, Arriverderci Roma / 21 tracks including Rolling home, Down by the riverside, Kari waits for me, Señorita Dolores, Aloha Oe, What shall we do with the drunken sailor, Rolling home, Good bye, fare you well\n\nVocalion CDLK 4382 [65:39]\n\nExpecting the first album on this 2-on-1 to compare with the Melachrino above, I could not have been more disappointed. This is not the Müller sound from previous CDs I have heard but a dance band playing a series of potpourri: foxtrots from Berlin, Paris, Vienna and Rome, rock from Hamburg, waltzes from Amsterdam and Munich, polkas from Copenhagen, bossa novas from Lisbon, cha-chas from Venice, tangos from Naples, and the twist [some ripe bass guitar here] from Capri. There is no mention of it being recorded in front of a live audience [actually there is no explanation for anything in the complete absence of liner notes] so I can only assume that all the background crowd noise, the vocalising and the applause is dubbed. Pity they bothered. These are 12 tracks I’ll not be returning to again in a hurry – glad I did not have to pay postage and packing on this one! The collection of seafaring songs on the second album, although vocal with orchestral accompaniment, is a different kettle of fish; my wife thought it \"a nice CD\", which is high praise! It is largely sung in German but some titles are in English. The men’s voices in the shanties are especially effective. The slow waltz Farewell is Greensleeves in a most attractive arrangement with a plaintive harmonica. This time there are background sounds of ships and sailors; more acceptable on a first hearing, at least. You, of course, may like the whole disc.

Now, hallelujah, here it is in all its God-given glory. Yet again we are indebted to Mike Dutton. With five wordless contributions from the Sammes Chorus, the superb Kingsway Hall organ on three tracks and nine masterly arrangements by Cecil Milner [the maestro writing the other five], Mantovani thought it was one of his best ever albums and is quoted in his biography as saying: \"No matter what religious inclinations one may have, it can only be pleasing to everyone.\" Biographer Colin Mackenzie’s words that \"it remains a listening joy, a source of comfort in troubled times\" could not be more apt today. The story behind the album is told for the first time in the comprehensive liner notes. And all for around a fiver.

The last half-a-dozen tracks are from a 1958 stereo album and are typical of Melachrino’s suave sound. The first album comes from two years earlier and is in mono. The French and Italian selections have already appeared on Guild Light Music CDs. Vivid well-played arrangements, largely shared between maestro Melachrino and William Hill-Bowen, would have benefited from the extra dimension of stereo.

That’s Entertainment played by the Conrad Salinger Orchestra kicks off another Guild selection of melodies - most of which are bereft of airtime from our national broadcasting service. Angela Morley’s orchestra is next with Robert Farnon’s classicWestminster Waltz, then a name I usually associate with horror films, but here in partnership with Mitchell Parrish for Ruby from the film \"Ruby Gentry\" – Heinz Roemheld, a German musical director long in Hollywood. He was responsible for the scores to \"The Invisible Man\", \"Dracula’s Daughter\", \"The Creature Walks Among Us\" and others – not all of them horror movies. Andre Kostelanetz makes the Waltzes from \"Count of Luxembourg\" sound as though they were written just for his orchestra – a marvellous sound enhanced by Alan Bunting’s restorative treatment. David Ades confessed to me that he has included this track because it reminds him of the days in the mid-1950s when the English service of Radio Luxembourg used to open with this music around 7:00pm, although he has not been able to establish whether or not it was actually the Kostelanetz version that was used. Geraldo’s New Concert Orchestra does a fine job of All My Life by George Melachrino from \"Eight O’Clock Walk\", but the film itself is dismissed by Halliwell as ‘minor league courtroom stuff; an adequate time passer’. Very disheartening for the composer, I would think. This Can’t Be Love, I’ll See You In My Dreams and But Beautiful continue the romantic screen themes, but Alfred Newman (from my same Mercury LP that David used in ‘A Box of Light Musical Allsorts’) steps us the pace with his music for the Bette Davis classic \"All About Eve\" which also featured a very young Marilyn Monroe. I didn’t realise that Bob Farnon’s Blue Theme from a Chappell 78 was featured in the film \"True Lies\", so I turned again to Halliwell for his verdict – ‘it long overstays its welcome though the destruction is on an extremely lavish scale’. It stars the present Governor of California. Track 12 has the Overture by Sigmund Romberg, arranged by Robert Farnon, to \"The Girl In Pink Tights\"; the music is new to me but very enjoyable. Harry Warren’s This Heart Of Mine from the film \"Ziegfeld Follies\" gets a great treatment from George Melachrino’s Orchestra, as does Time Was played by Mario Ruiz Armengol and his Orchestra – a name I’d never heard of until he started to appear on Guild CDs. Buckly Down Winsocki from the 1943 MGM film \"Best Foot Forward\" (which has, I think, a military college background) starred Lucille Ball who’s singing voice was dubbed on the soundtrack, but the odd-titled piece is played here by (William) Hill-Bowen and his Orchestra. Body and Soul by Johnny Green is given a too dreamy treatment for my liking by Morton Gould’s Orchestra, but Geoff Love’s Orchestra makes the very best of Jerome Kern’s lovely song Make Believe from \"Show Boat\".Waltz For My Lady written and conducted by Frank Perkins could easily have come from a mood music library – it has a most infectious swing, while Leroy Holmes’ Enchanted Night has a real film ‘smoochy’ night club feel and one can imagine the camera following a particular couple round the dance floor. And finally the curtain comes down on another fine Guild programme with the incidental music by Max Steiner to \"Since You Went Away\" with the composer conducting. I also have a shortened version on another CD of the score, but as this Guild recordings is just over nine minutes you get, as usual, value for money with this series. Ken Wilkins\n\nTHE MUSIC OF ERIC COATES For Your Delight\n\n19 tracks [all mentioned below]\n\nBygonedays BYD 77026 [72:21]\n\nThis long awaited Eric Coates CD will indeed \"delight\" the many thousands of fans of the nation's foremost composer and, at £5.99, is a \"give away\". From In Town Tonight, the foxtrot version of theKnightsbridge March, by Teddy Joyce and his Band to the very obvious finale of Eric conducting his outstandingly successful Dam Busters March, it presents the listener with a collection [17 conducted by the composer] very easy on the ear. It is right to say about Eric Coates that \"Music was in his life and life was in his music\". This music is still fresh and entertaining, patriotic, stirring and able to carry the listener into realms of quiet relaxation with so many mental images of long gone times: people, places, events, sunlit byeways, mist-filled meadows after summer rain and sun; also busy streets, the shuffle and click of leather on paving, the mingle of traffic and ongoing workers weaving their ways to the daily grind. Here are favourites like By The sleepy lagoon, London Bridge March,Symphonic Rhapsody on ‘I heard you singing’ and ’Bird songs at eventide’, Song of Loyalty, Summer Afternoon [Idyll], and Footlights [Concert Waltz], all with Eric conducting the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. For Your Delight is the title track with Eric conducting the HMV Light Symphony Orchestra with which group he also fronts for The Man About Town [No.2 from ‘The Three Men’] and At the Dance [No.3 from ‘Summer Days’]. Eric conducts his own Orchestra for Wood Nymphs [Valsette], the Band of H.M. Life Guards play the march Over To You. With Television March, Oxford Street March,Westminster [Meditation], Rhythm [No.4 from ‘The Four Centuries’] and Sound & Vision – The A.B.C. TV March, all combine a feast of music through the length of the disc. The disc, like all of those produced for the nostalgia market, is a fine and varied work. The technical expertise rendered upon recordings of over 75 years of age provides the ambient qualities associated with the era, with the dramatic advantage of next century technology that completely converts the listening pleasure for ages to come. Full and impressive booklet notes by Peter Dempsey make for a wealth of information; he leaves no musical stone unturned. Whether at home or abroad this disc is a must for your CD shelves. I look forward to the next one, and trust that you will too.

Skaila Kanga (harp), Karen Jones (flute), Judith Busbridge (viola), Caroline Dearnley (cello), Nicholas Buckall (clarinet), Richard Bissill (French horn), Marcia Crayford(violin). Divine Art Diversions ddv 24130. Don’t be put off by \"Chamber Music\"! David Snell is, I am told, a member of the RFS and this disc shows that he has a gift for melody and several of the items here are light music miniatures. Debussy and others wrote sonatas for the same combination of instruments as the Lyric Sonata (flute/harp/viola) but the \"Lyric\" part of the title is dominant; all three movements overflow with melody and even nod towards jazz. The Fantasia explores fascinating and shapely material for harp, clarinet and horn; the lighter items are Elegie(flute/harp/cello), Intrada and Waltz, a pleasantly lilting example, (harp/violin), and Cavatina and March (flute/harp) in which a touchingly wistful Cavatina is followed by a March which reminds me of Trevor Duncan’s (\"Dr. Finlay\") example. David Snell has been a harpist with many orchestras, a conductor and a composer of film and \"production\" music. He will be delighted, as I am, with the fine playing, especially Ms Kanga, one of our finest harpists, and the excellent recording. Highly recommended. Philip Scowcroft\n\nSENTIMENTAL JOURNEY The Singers Unlimited with Robert Farnon and his Orchestra The More I see You, Sleepy Time Gal, I Get Along Without You Very Well, Angel Eyes, As Time Goes By, I’ll Remember April, If I Didn’t Care, Sentimental Journey, In The Still Of The Night, Deep Purple, Put Your Dreams Away, Mona Lisa, How Beautiful Is Night MPS Jazzclub 06025 1794292, 53:07. This compilation revisits those two memorable 1970s LPs \"Sentimental Journey\" and \"Eventide\". The first is included in full, whereas five tracks have been selected from \"Eventide\". With vocal arrangements by Gene Puerling, allied to the orchestral magic created by Robert Farnon, these are surely impeccable performances that will continue to amaze music lovers for the rest of this century – and beyond. It is a pity that some tracks on \"Eventide\" have been omitted (there would have been time on the disc), but many of you will know that the original albums have already been reissued in full on CD. If you missed them previously, this is your chance to enhance your collection with some superb sounds! David Ades Available from the RFS Record Service.\n\nMUSIC FROM THE MOVIES OF DANA ANDREWS\n\nNow I know, Manic depressive presents, Tess’s torch song, Jive number, Cradle song, Smoke gets in your eyes, Yesterdays, Lovely to look at, Summertime, Sophisticated lady, Laura, Isn’t it kind of fun?, It might as well be spring, That’s for me, It’s a grand night for singing, Slowly, Ole buttermilk sky, My foolish heart, Hey! ba-ba-re-bop, Among my souvenirs, Lazy river, The voice of Dana Andrews\n\nSounds of Yesteryear DSOY768 [65:31]\n\nCompiler Michael Highton has latched on to a good idea here. Everyone is catered for, film buffs, good music lovers, romantics and anyone who needs their spirits lifted. Instead of the same theme repeated in different guises you get a very varied collection, not even limiting you to one film! The key to holding the CD together is film star Dana Andrews, picking parts of his films from 1944 to 1949. Orchestras involved are Glenn Miller, Tex Beneke, Victor Young, Ralph Flanagan, Andre Kostelanetz and Frank Cordell. Singers are Hoagy Carmichael, Danny Kaye, Diana Shore, Allan Jones, Dick Haymes and Ray Eberle. Bill Finegan’s arrangement of The cradle song, Norman Leydon’s score for Now I know and David Raksin’s Laura are worth the price alone. Not all tracks are from soundtracks, some are transcriptions but they all fit together in a wonderful montage of entertainment. Paul Clatworthy\n\nWONDERFUL WORLD OF ROMANCE Unforgettable Melodies Of Haydn Wood - Peter Dempsey [tenor], Guy Rowland [piano]\n\nSongs: O flower divine!, Wonderful world of romance, Little Yvette, A song of quietness, I look into your garden, Dearest I love the morning, Praise, I think of you, my sweet, The unforgotten melody, Singing to you, I shall be there, The stars looked down, This is my dream … and seven other titles\n\nHW 1 [71:45]\n\nGenerally speaking, Haydn Wood is best known for light orchestral miniatures, but he also composed around 200 songs of the ballad-type [his wife was a professional singer], of which the most popular were Roses of Picardy [it won hands down], Love’s garden of roses and A brown bird singing. This disc gathers together 19 of them [including those three] written between 1914 and 1946 in performances which are, as in the Dempsey/Rowland CD devoted to Eric Coates reviewed in the last JIM, notable for clarity of delivery and diction and thoroughly recommendable. They appear in roughly chronological order; although the songs from around 1940 seem to have a rather desperate optimism, generally they exhibit a recognizable family likeness, so it was a good idea to intersperse four short piano solos [some were also orchestral] to supply contrast and an opportunity for Guy Rowland to display solo as well as accompaniment skills. Many tracks, vocal and instrumental, are doubtless premiere recordings, but which are not specified. An admirable and unusual anniversary tribute.

[e-mail: Demsini @aol.com] - £9.95 incl. p&p\n\nBY THE RIVER IN SPRING\n\nKenneth Smith [flute] and Paul Rhodes [piano]\n\nHamilton Harty: In Ireland; Edward German: Intermezzo, Suite for Flute and Piano; Michael Head: By the river in spring; Havelock Nelson: Eirie cherie, In Venezuela; William Alwyn: Flute Sonata; Thomas Dunhill: Valse Fantasia; Kenneth Leighton: Flute Sonata; Stanford Robinson: The Moon-Maiden’s Dance\n\nDivine Art Records DA 25069 [77:34]\n\nThis is a honey of a disc. Two of the items are styled \"Sonata\" but Alwyn’s, in one movement and reconstructed from unpublished bits, is recognisably by the film composer we know, while the Leighton’s slow movement is one of the loveliest things I have heard for a while. Harty’s ‘In Ireland’has atmosphere, the German pieces are perfect late Victorian salon miniatures, the Head alternates a cadenza-like motto theme with songlike episodes, the Dunhill has both tunefulness and brawn. Two BBC stalwarts of light music’s great period are represented: Stanford Robinson, who, as we hear, could compose as well as conduct, and Ulsterman Havelock Nelson, whose two pieces recall his associations with the Americas. Performances and recording enhance this unusual but wholly delightful repertoire. Generous measure, too. Philip L Scowcroft\n\nCLASSICAL BEATLES\n\nBaroque Chamber Orchestra, The King’s Singers, Lesley Garrett, Manuel Barrusco [guitar], Rostal & Schaefer, The Swingle Singers, Vienna Boys’ Choir, Kindred Spirits, David Tanebaum [guitar]\n\n45 songs by Lennon & McCartney and George Harrison\n\nEMI 2167842 [73:14 & 73:58]\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah! Without question the most entertaining new release I have reviewed this time round and, despite stiff competition, gets my accolade for the June JIM’s Best Album. I don’t think it is intended exclusively for classical music buffs as there is much here to appeal to the light music enthusiast, not least Arthur Wilkinson’s ‘Beatle Cracker Suite’, which cleverly blends Tchaikovsky with the Fab Four, and ‘The Beatles Concerto’, arranged by John Rutter, played by piano duo Rostal and Shaefer with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Ron Goodwin. This combination also contribute Maxwell’s silver hammer, Fool on the hill and A hard day’s night. It is difficult to choose standout tracks – they are all so good – but I particularly enjoyed the Vienna Boys’ Choir All you need is love, Lesley Garrett and orchestra conducted by George Martin with For no one/Blackbird and the five tracks by the Baroque Chamber Orchestra conducted by Richard Edinger. Tremendous value at around a tenner. Peter Burt\n\nBING CROSBY Through The Years Volume Three\n\n26 tracks including Misto Cristofo Columbo, Your own little house, When the world was young, A weaver of dreams, At last! At last!, Just for you, Sailing down the Chesapeake Bay, Ida, sweet as apple cider, It had to be you, Two Shillelagh O’Sullivan, Rosaleen, Don’t ever be afraid to go home\n\nSepia 1129 [76:30]\n\nRichard Tay’s enterprising label continues its chronological look at Bing’s recording career. On track one, from June 1951, he is joined by Jane Wyman for In the cool, cool, cool of the evening; not only a Top 20 winner but receiver of the Oscar for Best Film Song. Domino, recorded in October of the same year, also made the Top 20. Two weeks later he recorded The Isle of Innisfree, which appeared in the first ever UK charts in November 1952 and peaked at No.3. Also included are duets with The Andrews Sisters [I’ll si-si ya in Bahia and The live oak tree] and a couple of Christmas songs [Christmas in Killarney and It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas]. The final two tracks have a \"Nashville\" sound with Grady Martin and his Slew Foot Five [Just a little lovin’ and Till the end of the world]. Versatility was certainly one of the great Bing’s qualities. Peter Burt\n\nEDMUND HOCKRIDGE The Best of Edmund Hockridge\n\n20 tracks incl. No other love, By the fountains of Rome, Young and foolish, A woman in love, Long ago [and far away], Moon river, ‘S Wonderful, The way you look tonight, Tonight, They can’t take that away from me, Tenement Symphony, Love letters, Only a rose, Falling in love with love, I love Paris\n\nPulse PLS CD 254 [60:35]\n\nAlthough not a new release but mentioned here in tribute to the fine baritone who starred in seven Broadway hits in London’s W"
