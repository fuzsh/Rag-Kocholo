        "text": "“….”\n\nSimon Simon is a short comedy film lasting just thirty minutes written and directed by and also starring Graham Stark. It’s format very much borrows from 1967’s The Plank starring Eric Sykes and Tommy Cooper in which Stark also appeared. Both have no real dialogue and rely on the strange situations the characters encounter and physical comedy for their humour.\n\nFor Simon Simon Stark is joined by John Junkin in the lead roles of two somewhat incompetent workmen. We initially see Stark sat high atop a shoddily built wooden structure on the back of their work van happily reading a book before an unfortunate meeting with a low bridge and a train sees their ladder destroyed. As a result their boss gives them a new vehicle with a brand new electric crane called Simon and Stark’s character finds himself attempting to woo a typist he meets in a high-rise window, engaging in a mid-air battle with a fireman in his own crane and eventually foiling a robbery.\n\nThere are some definite successes in the thirty minutes, but ultimately it never really manages to sustain any real laughter and it certainly falls well below the standards of The Plank. Stark is a very entertaining figure and was a stalwart of British comedy and film for a number of years. Already in this blog he has made appearances in Alfie, The Wrong Box and The Wrong Arm of the Law, two of those also featuring his regular collaborator Peter Sellers. This was his first directorial credit and it’s here that the film suffers a little. With the film relying on set pieces and physical humour the direction is arguably the most crucial element to get right and there are two or three scenes where the way it is shot doesn’t allow for the humour to come through. It’s evident in that initial scene as Stark crashes into the railway bridge, in the end car chase as they look to stop the robber and most notably in the crane fighting sequence between Stark and Norman Rossington’s fireman. That scene is one of the strangest in the film as suddenly it switches to a World War II pastiche with RAF and Nazi imagery emblazoned on the cranes and everybody suddenly switching to military uniform. It’s an interesting idea that could have worked very well, but instead falls a bit flat and doesn’t succeed in being either funny or interesting enough to make it a success.\n\nThe big set pieces aside there are some very nice moments from Stark. A scene which again plays with War film imagery as he and Junkin are placed up against the wall as if facing a firing squad is very well directed. There’s also a lovely moment as Stark having ended up with a glass dome from a light fitting stuck over his head comes face to face with a goldfish in its bowl that manages to make up for the fact the comedy of him having the accident with the light isn’t timed quite right.\n\nFortunately Stark is such a likeable on screen presences that it’s possible to forgive some of the film’s deficiencies. His popularity as a performer is emphasised by the list of stars who give cameos in Simon Simon. Sellers, Eric Morecambe, Ernie Wise, Tony Blackburn, David Hemmings, Bernie Winters and Bob Monkhouse all make brief appearances while Stark’s love interest is played by Julia Foster who took the same role alongside him and Caine in Alfie. It’s interesting to see so many familiar faces, but little is made of their talents. All of the cameos are only really there for the audience to point and say “look it’s Eric Morecambe” rather than for anything more than substantial with Morecambe in particular just having a few seconds on screen in which he isn’t given anything funny to do. Notably when listing these cameos at the end of the film the credits state “The Director wishes to thank the following friends” and it’s fair to say the film sometimes relies on popping a familiar face on screen every now and again just to keep the audiences’ attention.\n\nMichael Caine is one of the first of those cameos and manages to be one of the most successful. It comes in the opening credits as Stark is paid to plaster some posters over the top of existing movie posters. It turns out these posters hold the names of the cast and crew of Simon Simon and as he sticks Norman Rossington’s over Michael Caine’s name on a poster for Play Dirty an angry (and nicely bearded) Caine is driven past. It’s an interesting and effective way of getting the credits on screen and raises a genuine laugh in a way that the rest of the film often struggles. It also means that Caine’s cameo although lasting just seconds at least has more of a purpose than the majority of the others in the film.\n\nSimon Simon is a little bit of an oddity and in many ways that is now its main selling point. It’s possible to see what it was aiming at and the success of The Plank showed the potential for its basic formula to work, but what results is ultimately a bit messy. Despite that it remains a bit of a curio and worth giving up half an hour of your time."
