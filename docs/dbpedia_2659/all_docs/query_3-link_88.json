        "text": "Taking charge of a De Niro passion project.\n\nRobert De Niro had been trying to make “The Comedian” for years. Martin Scorsese was even going to direct it at one time. But last year, after another project fell through for Hackford, he got the call to come on and shoot “The Comedian.”\n\nHe admits he wasn’t instantly sold since he knew it was a De Niro passion project, but he accepted and found out working with the actor was “a dream.”\n\n“De Niro really respects directors,” Hackford said. “He encouraged me every step of the way to take charge. That’s a gift. He wants direction.”\n\nPacino gave him the greatest improv performance he’s ever seen.\n\nHackford notes that both De Niro and Pacino are very dedicated in their preparation before filming begins. But there’s also room for spontaneity.\n\nBefore shooting the end of \"The Devil's Advocate,\" in which Pacino’s character reveals he’s the devil, Hackford asked Pacino and his costar Keanu Reeves to improv the scene.\n\n“I told them to forget the text, just feel the room, and I saw Pacino walk in and do the most incredible improv I’ve ever seen in my life,” Hackford said. “Out of the middle of nowhere he stars to sing, ‘I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico,’ and that’s from an old Frank Sinatra song I hadn’t heard in 30 years. I said, ‘Where the hell did that come from?’ and he said, ‘I don’t know, I just felt like singing it.’”\n\nHackford put that moment in the final version of the scene, but instead of Pacino singing, he dubbed it with Sinatra singing.\n\n“I thought, the devil could sound like Sinatra if he wants to,” he said.\n\nDe Niro is no slouch at improv, either.\n\nIn “The Comedian,” Hackford points out that De Niro had to be quick on the draw, as he was placed in situations with major comedians who never stayed on script.\n\n“We made the film in 27 days and I didn’t do a lot of takes. I wanted spontaneity,” Hackford said. “Bob had to respond, and there’s some real moments I’m so proud of. The Friars Club scene with Cloris Leachman, she was throwing zingers that De Niro wasn’t ready for, but he responded right on the spot. Then the scene with comic Jessica Krison, the general framework was that De Niro and Leslie Mann were going to walk through the shot, but what Jessica and Bob did was all riffing, that scene is all improv.”\n\nThe secret to working with legends.\n\nHackford said he’s never been scared to go to an actor and give them direction if it’s needed, but for the most part he allows them to work, especially when you have talent like De Niro and Pacino.\n\n“Pacino and De Niro have different styles, but deep down they are real pros and will make it work,” he said. “I know not to step on their toes. You find a common language and you only intrude when you feel they need it. Outside of that, you give them the freedom to make something work.”"
