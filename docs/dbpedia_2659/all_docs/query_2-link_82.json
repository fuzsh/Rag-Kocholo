        "text": "An untitled ABC drama project has an Oscar winner on board to direct the pilot. The Hollywood Reporter’s Live Feed reports that Taylor Hackford will direct the untitled pilot from Richard LaGravenese.\n\nThe drama is about two powerful socialites who manipulate the people around them as part of their power plays for each other’s affection, the story says. LaGravenese, who received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for “The Fisher King” in 1992, will write and executive produce.\n\nHackford is a former president of the Directors Guild of America and is known for directing a string of high-profile feature films including \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" (1982), \"Against All Odds\" (1984) and \"The Devil’s Advocate\" (1997). He won an Oscar in 1979 for best live-action short film for “Teenage Father,” and his 2004 feature “Ray” was nominated for best picture.\n\nLast year Hackford directed and executive produced “Company Town,” a drama pilot for the CW."
