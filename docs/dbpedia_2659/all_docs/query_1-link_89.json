        "text": "Hollywood power couple Dame Helen Mirren and movie director Taylor Hackford have once again listed their historic Los Angeles home for sale. The Oscar-winning couple first listed their property in the summer of 2021 for $18.5 million while at the same time putting it up for rent at $45,000 a month. According to public record, a deal on the eight-bedroom, eleven-bathroom estate went into contract, but eventually fell through in September of that year.\n\nBuilt in 1911 for multi-hyphenate entertainer Dustin Farnum, known best for starring in silent films like Cecile B. Mille’s Squaw Man, the property has a rare heritage, boasting a history of just four owners, all of whom were Hollywood luminaries (including Hackford, who purchased the property in the 1980s).\n\n\"It's very unusual to have a house that's over 100 years old and it's only had four owners over that time,\" Hackford told the Wall Street Journal shortly after the first listing. According to the current listing with realtor Stephen Apelian, writer and producer Mark Hellinger, whose short story inspired the classic 1939 Hollywood gangster film The Roaring Twenties starring Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney, was the second owner. Hackford eventually purchased the property a few years after the death of previous owner Gail Patrick. Patrick was one of the first and most successful female television producers of her time, whose work includes executive producer of the popular CBS crime series Perry Mason, which ran from 1956-1967.\n\nPerched on a hill that abuts protected Runyon Canyon Park, the uber private 6.5-acre-property comprises a two-story main residence and a three-bedroom guest cottage that shares the gorgeous landscaped space with a pool, a five-car garage, enormous terrace, and numerous mature trees. On the inside, many old-world details have been maintained (even though it is uncertain if they are original) like the terracotta-tiled floors in the chef’s kitchen and some bathrooms, and the exposed-brick fireplace in the kitchen’s dining area. The charming house’s floor plan is configured in such a way that spectacular views of lush vegetation and the city skyline can be seen from almost every room.\n\nJoin Now\n\nFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per month.\n\nArrow\n\nHackford has had an illustrious career in Hollywood, winning an Oscar in 1979 for Best Live Action Short Film, Teenage Father, and directing many notable movies like 2004’s Ray and 1982’s An Officer and a Gentleman. London-born Mirren, who has achieved the triple-crown of acting in both the United States and England, was appointed as a dame in 2003 by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Hackford and Mirren have been a couple since 1986, marrying a decade later."
