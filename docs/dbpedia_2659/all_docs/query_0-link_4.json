        "text": "An early career in television documentaries helped to shape the degree of verisimilitude that informed much of Taylor Hackford's efforts as a director and producer in Hollywood. After proving his skill with real-life subjects, he ventured into features, where he fared best with biopics - especially those based on the lives of rock 'n' roll pioneers like Ritchie Valens in \"La Bamba\" (1987) and Ray Charles in \"Ray\" (2004). \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" (1982) and \"Against All Odds\" (1984) also won many moviegoers' hearts, as did later projects like \"White Nights\" (1985) and \"Everybody's All-American\" (1988). Feature-length documentaries proved to be one of his most satisfying milieus, with \"Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll\" (1987) and the Muhammad Ali fight story \"When We Were Kings\" (1996) earning him praise from critics and viewers alike. Films like these solidified Hackford's status as a director with an uncanny knack for capturing the drama inherent in everyday lives."
