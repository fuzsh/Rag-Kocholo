        "text": "THE Ray Charles biopic “Ray” gained in the Oscar race yesterday after scoring a nomination for helmer Taylor Hackford in the bellwether Directors Guild of America awards.\n\n“Ray” edged out Brad Bird’s animated “The Incredibles,” which scored a nomination Wednesday in the Producers Guild of America awards, as well as Terry George’s genocide drama “Hotel Rwanda,” all of which are competing for Oscar Best Picture nominations.\n\nThe other four DGA nominations mirrored the PGA: Clint Eastwood for the boxing drama “Million Dollar Baby,” Martin Scorsese for the Howard Hughes biopic “The Aviator,” Alexander Payne for the buddy comedy “Sideways,” and Marc Foster for “Finding Neverland,” starring Johnny Depp as “Peter Pan” creator J.M. Barrie.\n\nThe directors will hand out their awards – which have predicted the winner of the Best Director Oscar for 50 out of 56 years – on Jan. 29.\n\nMeanwhile, “Million Dollar Baby” surprisingly failed to make the short list of 15 movies eligible for nominations in the British Academy Awards, which will be issued Jan. 18.\n\nInsiders said this was probably because the film’s British distributor had not sent out DVDs or tapes of the movie or scheduled enough screenings, as has been done with Oscar voters.\n\nEastwood’s movie did manage to qualify for BAFTA nominations for best actress (Hilary Swank), supporting actor (Morgan Freeman) and adapted screenplay."
