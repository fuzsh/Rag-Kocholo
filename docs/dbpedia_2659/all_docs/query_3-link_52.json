        "text": "Acclaimed director Taylor Hackford is Hellen Mirren's life partner and loving husband. The couple has been together for 34 years and has been married for 23 years.\n\nHellen Mirren, 75, is an Academy Award-winning British actress who built a solid career thanks to her extraordinary acting talent. Although she said that she did not want to marry, she has been happily married for 23 years.\n\nHer husband is the renowned and award-winning American film director Taylor Hackford, 74, whom she met in 1985 when he directed her in \"White Nights.\" Both were recognized as the ideal partner of the other and since then they have been together.\n\nHelen Mirren and Taylor Hackford arriving at the 10th Annual Critics' Choice Awards in Los Angeles, California in January 2005. | Image: Getty Images.\n\nDuring the 34 years that they have shared their lives, they have loved, supported, and encouraged each other to continue their careers. Often that has meant living in different houses, cities, and countries, missing each other a lot.\n\nHowever, both of them have grown stronger in their lives and marriage. She admires her husband and he respects what an extraordinary actress she is in her professional career. They are a beautiful couple that always looks happy when one is next to each other.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nDirector Hackford was born in Santa Barbara, California in 1944 to a middle-class family. His parents divorced when he was 13 and he grew up with his siblings. He studied at the University of Southern California in 1968.\n\nHe was married twice before Mirren, first to Georgie Lowres from 1967 to 1972, with whom he had his first child Rio Hackford in 1970. He then married actress Lynn Littman from 1977 to 1982, who is the mother of his second son Alexander Hackford born 1979.\n\nCAREER AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nHackford is usually remembered for movies like \"An Officer and a Gentleman,\" \"Ray,\" and \"Love Ranch.\" However, although \"Ray\" obtained two Oscar nominations, it was another film that gave him the Academy Award.\n\nIn 1978, the director received an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film with \"Teenage Father\" but it was not the only award he received in his career. As a tribute to both Hackford and Miller, in 2017 each one of them was awarded the Gold Hugo for Career Achievement.\n\nDIRECTING HIS OWN WIFE\n\nSomething not very easy to do for Hackford has been directing his wife in a movie again. Since they met filming âWhite Nights,â it took him 20 years to work with her again.\n\nIt was in the movie \"Love Ranch\" with Joe Pesci, that Hackford would return to direct Mirren, where they play Charlie and Grace Bontempo. After this film, the actress has not been attracted to any of the roles that her husband has offered her.\n\nREASONS BEHIND THE WEDDING\n\nHackford is Mirren's first husband, who after 11 years of living together said that since they were both the love of each other's lives, it was best for them to get married. Furthermore, with his usual sense of humor, he also commented that there were other reasons for getting married.\n\nMiren spoke of legal reasons, alluding to inheritance and estate issues that are facilitated by marriage. But she did not fail to mention that her family, children, and friends were also waiting for them to get married since they became a couple.\n\nSECRET OF SUCCESS\n\nMirren has answered the question about the secret to her successful marriage with her personal style. She has said that contrary to what everyone says, the secret in her relationship has been to be away from each other, missing each other a lot.\n\nRead also\n\nHelen Mirren, 77, Shows Hourglass Figure While Holding Hands on Date With Rarely-Seen Husband\n\nFans in Awe of Helen Mirren, 78, Flaunting Her Fluffy Hair as She Catwalks in Silver Dress during Paris Fashion Week\n\nâIâm at a Loss for Wordsâ: Helen Mirren Stunned Fans Posing for Spouse in Swimsuit in her 60s\n\nJoking aside, she explained that both she and her husband have understood how important it is to continue developing their careers with the encouragement, support, and help of the other. It's something that both of them have done for all these years together.\n\nUNITED FAMILY\n\nHackford and Mirren met when they were both 34 years old, and they have no children together. She has always commented on how well she gets along with Rio and Alexander, the children of her husband, they all are a family.\n\nThe decision not to have children of their own was not something they planned. She said that she was always so focused on her career that when she thought about children she told herself that later when she had time for them and it just didn't happen.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtsanBlbHq1rdilpqtlmJawrLLOq5tmoaNitaa4xKdkpqGip7Kvv4yopaWxXZ3Cb7TTpqM%3D"
