See About archive blog posts.\n\nTaylor Hackford was reelected president of the Directors Guild of America on Saturday at the union’s biennial convention in Los Angeles.\n\nHackford was first elected president in 2009 and ran unopposed. The director of such films as ‘An Officer and a Gentleman,’ ‘Dolores Claiborne’ and ‘Against All Odds’ joined the DGA in 1974 and became a member of the National Board in 2002.\n\n“It is my honor to accept once again the position of President of the Directors Guild of America in this, our 75thanniversary year,” Hackford said in a statement. “This is the greatest distinction anyone can have in this town. I am so proud to be a member of this Guild and to be part of the leadership, and I can promise you that, as I have in the last two years, I will work as hard as I possibly can to represent our members and fight for their creative and economic rights – whether that be at the bargaining table, on the set or in Washington, DC.”\n\nHackford was nominated for a DGA Award and an Academy Award for best director for ‘An Officer and a Gentleman’ in 1983 and for ‘Ray’ in 2005. He won the Academy Award for live-action short ‘Teenage Father’ in 1979. Hackford also won a Grammy for the soundtrack to ‘Ray.’"
