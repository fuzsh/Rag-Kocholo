        "text": "Helen Mirren glad she married late\n\nPTI / Aug 10, 2014, 13:41 (IST)\n\nVeteran actress Helen Mirren, who married director Taylor Hackford at the age of 52, says had she done it any earlier, it would almost certainly have failed.\n\nMiles Teller to feature in Paramount's 'An Officer and a Gentleman' remake\n\nPTI / Jun 15, 2024, 18:02 (IST)\n\nMiles Teller, known for his role in Top Gun: Maverick, will headline Paramount's remake of the 1982 classic An Officer and a Gentleman. This modern update of the original film, which featured Richard Gere, Debra Winger, and Louis Gossett Jr., aims to bring a contemporary twist to the iconic story. The original movie followed Zack Mayo, an aspiring Navy aviator played by Gere, who clashes with his stern drill instructor, Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley, a role that earned Gossett an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Directed by Taylor Hackford, the film was a major box office success. Dana Fox has written the latest draft of the script, following an earlier version by Matt Johnson. The project will be produced by Temple Hill for Paramount.\n\nHelen steps out in a skimpy bikini!\n\nJul 17, 2008, 00:04 (IST)\n\nYou can have a fabulous figure even at the age of 62 and English actress Helen Mirren proved this by turning heads when she stepped out in a skimpy bikini!"
