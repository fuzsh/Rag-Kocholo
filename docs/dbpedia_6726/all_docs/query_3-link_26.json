'Teamwork, cooperation, planning, problem-solving, thinking quickly,' Gracey explained, 'all of those are things we want our kids to be able to do. And you can do that through video games.'\"\n\nAnd, for the collegiate perspective on this: \"High school is a really, really exciting place for esports to take root,\" said Austin Espinoza, president of Longhorn Gaming at the University of Texas at Austin. \"Eventually, that's just going to trickle upwards into the college world.\" Yes, yes, it's VERY exciting. I'm sure the effect on grades will be *nothing* but positive, right? On the other hand, esports provides an opportunity for college students to earn some money to pay down their college debts, so that's a potential upside. Will colleges start recruiting and offering scholarships to esports competitors?"
