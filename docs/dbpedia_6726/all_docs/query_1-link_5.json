        "text": "As Kia geared up to launch its Stinger model last year, it wanted to do something special to help its first grand tourer model stand out—so agency Innocean cooked up a fun bit of custom publishing, complete with a fake speeding ticket and a scratch-and-sniff serving up the smell of scorched tires.\n\nThe promo booklet, sent to some 100 automotive journalists, arrived in a glossy metal box and was loaded with eye candy—leveraging the scientific diagram for an adrenaline molecule into a design motif appearing through the magazine.\n\nIt featured eight chapters to match the car’s 8-speed automatic transmission and allowed readers to peel back a special sticker to reveal the book’s first image of the car itself."
