        "text": "Hi.\n\nAnyone have experience to share about deploying production environment\n\nwith Joyent? TextDrive had a lot of instability problems I recollect\n\n(possibly only with shared plans?).\n\nThanks for any input.\n\nMorten\n\nI’ve been with TextDrive two years, and I don’t recommend the shared\n\nhosting. Stability has been much better over the last year, but\n\noverall it’s been very difficult to get responses from support. My\n\nfeeling is Joyent/TextDrive’s heart is in the right place, but it’s\n\nreally all about the cool stuff, and not the fundamentals of quality\n\nhosting.\n\nAll that said, the Accelerator is a one-of-a-kind setup in the\n\nindustry, and I am dying to try it because I really do believe it is\n\nbetter than anything else out there. As far as VPS technology goes,\n\nkernel-level support really makes the difference, and Solaris is by\n\nfar the most advanced in this area. Accelerator is leveraging\n\ntechnology from the latest Solaris builds for a VPS that is both\n\nburstable, scalable and more stable overall. No one else has anything\n\nlike it. I’d say it’s a pretty good bet for hosting your Rails app.\n\nHowever, I would stick to just the web hosting and keep my email\n\nsomewhere else. Although my email account there has been pretty\n\nstable, it’s high latency (email coming in is delayed by the spam\n\nfiltering from 2-20 mins), and when there IS a problem (such as being\n\nflagged as spammy) they just don’t answer tickets in a timely manner\n\nat all.\n\nOn May 28, 12:06 am, “removed_email_address@domain.invalid” removed_email_address@domain.invalid\n\nwrote:\n\nOn May 23, 8:40 am, dasil003 removed_email_address@domain.invalid wrote:\n\nI’m interested to hear what you perceive as the benefits of Joyent’s\n\noffering -vs- a Xen based solution?\n\nAlthough I’m not the OP, I’ll take a stab at why Solaris’ VPS solution\n\ninterests me over Xen at the moment.\n\nThe company I work for builds semi-custom web app tools which we then\n\nhost for the customer, so we use at least one server for each customer/\n\nproduct. So far, we’ve been using Xen-based virtual servers, and this\n\nsetup has been working great so far. Until last week…\n\nOne of our production servers stopped responding. And by server, I\n\nmean the physical box – every single VM on it was down. It turns out\n\nwe were hit by a bug in Xen[1] that’s been open since 2005 and seems\n\nto affect the very core of the architecture. The layman’s description\n\nof the problem is that the kernel in one or more of the virtual\n\nservers develops an issue with (IIRC) its interrupt timing and starts\n\nspending all of its available CPU cycles logging a message that “time\n\nwent backwards”. This somehow “infects” all of the other virtual\n\nservers on the same box. The servers don’t actually go /down/, they\n\njust run out of processing power to handle any other task within a\n\nreasonable amount of time. We have, thus far, been unable to determine\n\nwhat specific conditions cause this behavior to start happening; so\n\neven though it hasn’t occurred on our other (physical) production\n\nservers yet, we have no reason to believe that it won’t.\n\nNow, I don’t want to blow the issue out of proportion, so I won’t go\n\nso far as to say that Xen is unsuitable and no one should use it.\n\nHowever, this has definitely shaken our confidence in the platform;\n\nand that is why I’m currently taking a serious look at Solaris.\n\nSince we co-locate our own servers, this isn’t a Joyent vs. Engine\n\nYard (or other Xen-based host) issue, but it’s pretty much the same\n\nquestion.\n\n[1] Citrix Hypervisor - Server Virtualization and Management Software - Citrix\n\n–\n\nRegards,\n\nJohn W.\n\nI’m looing at these a bit more from the sidelines, but there are a\n\ncouple\n\nappealing things about Solaris in general to me, which then the\n\nvirtualization choice is more of a follow-on… One is DTrace. This is\n\nquite a cool tool for diagnosing things. The other is how system\n\ncrashes,\n\ncrash logs, and reboots work - it’s simply more robust here. ZFS is\n\nalso\n\nextremely appealing. I do hope ZFS can be brought to Linux. I think\n\nit’s\n\nsomewhat unfortunate that there is a Linux vs. Solaris battle. I happen\n\nto\n\nuse Linux a lot, but Solaris has become much more appealing lately\n\nbecause\n\nof the tools and, at least in my perception, more robust handling in\n\nvery\n\nheavy load and heavy hardware situations. If I were building up my own\n\nsetup I’d be looking very seriously at it, in fact, I’d probably be\n\nusing it\n\nautomatically, if it weren’t for the fact that I simply don’t know the\n\nOS as\n\nwell/I’m not as comfy with it as I am Linux. Obviously you’ve got folks\n\nlike Google and others using commodity stuff, and Linux (and older Linux\n\nfrom what I understand), and working just fine, but it depends on what\n\nyour\n\nsituation is. Most folks aren’t building their own hardware, and can’t\n\nbe\n\nslapping in new boxes all the time.\n\nAs for available solutions and cases where you are hosting on someone\n\nelse’s\n\nsystem, I think you have to factor in a lot more. I happen to be a\n\nJoyent\n\ncustomer, but based on my experience, I’m not sure I would choose them\n\nto\n\nhost an important system. I would have to look at the accelerators more\n\nclosely, and understand the support a lot better. My experience is\n\nsolely\n\nbased on shared hosting, and that has worked ok for me as I mostly\n\nexperiment in that space, and want something cost effective, but for a\n\nproduction system I’d be looking at a lot more. EngineYard is very\n\nimpressive to me, and I’d be looking at it very seriously for Rails\n\napps.\n\nPart of that is not just technology and the available solution, but the\n\npeople and approach. Having met several Engine Y. folks, and knowing\n\nwho\n\nthey have on staff, and their dedication to the particular market\n\nsegment,\n\nthey are absolutley a top choice IMHO. It likely just depends on your\n\nparticular needs.\n\nOn 5/28/07, Jesse P. removed_email_address@domain.invalid wrote:\n\nand other features in Solaris really make it shine for web applications.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, at 9:46 AM, John W. wrote:\n\nAlthough I’m not the OP, I’ll take a stab at why Solaris’ VPS solution\n\ninterests me over Xen at the moment.\n\n–\n\nChris B.\n\nremoved_email_address@domain.invalid"
