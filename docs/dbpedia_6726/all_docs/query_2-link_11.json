        "text": "Messieurs Eric Meyer and Jeffrey Zeldman are pleased to announce An Event Apart Atlanta:\n\nOn 3 April 2006, America’s favorite pastime (designing with web standards) will come to the 755 Club at Turner Field, as the famed ballpark’s spectacularly furnished club hosts An Event Apart Atlanta.\n\nAn Event Apart is a concentrated, one-day learning session on modern web design. Check the Event Apart Philadelphia page to get a sense of how the first event, held in the Franklin Institute, went down. Transpose from Philly to Atlanta, think ballpark instead of museum, and you get an inkling of what to expect.\n\nOnline registration starts soon; seating will be limited. Subscribe to An Event Apart’s RSS feed to stay ahead of the curve. Can’t make Atlanta? Event Apart seminars in Seattle, Chicago, and Los Angeles are up next.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI blame Mark Simonson.\n\nFour jobs I’ve had\n\nWriter for The Washington Post and City Paper\n\nLaborer in a PVC coating factory\n\nArt director\n\nKeyboardist (Yatz, Spoons, Pop Maru, Insect Surfers)\n\nFour movies I can watch over and over\n\nRushmore\n\nSwing Time\n\nNorth By Northwest\n\nBest in Show\n\nFour places I’ve lived\n\nNew York City\n\nWashington DC\n\nBloomington IN\n\nPittsburgh PA\n\nFour TV shows I love\n\nThe Office (Brit.)\n\nArrested Development\n\nThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart\n\nThe News Hour with Jim Lehrer\n\nFour places I’ve vacationed\n\nIstanbul\n\nRome\n\nSan Francisco\n\nLondon\n\nFour of my favorite dishes\n\nMadras Rava Masala at Dosa Hut\n\nWhite Omelette at Penelope\n\nSag Paneer\n\nTofu in Spicy Ramen\n\nFour sites I visit daily\n\nCoudal Partners\n\nDaring Fireball\n\nSignal vs. Noise (by 37signals)\n\nA List Apart\n\nFour places I would rather be right now\n\nAnywhere with Carrie, baby, and doggie.\n\nSeriously.\n\nThat is my answer.\n\nHome best.\n\nFour bloggers I am tagging\n\nEric Meyer\n\nTanya Rabourn\n\nJason Santa Maria\n\nGreg Storey\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFresh and preserved petals from my Ma.gnolia bookmarks…\n\nAJAX, Web 2.0 and the Threat to Digital Archives\n\nThe more layers of mediation there are between you and the information you’re trying to preserve, the more likely it is that you won’t be able to access that information in the future. For historians, this problem is particularly painful; as information gets wrapped in more and more layers of technology, the profession increasingly relies … on the work of preservationists who keep this “stuff of history” around for future generations.\n\nCreate photo galleries in XHTML and CSS\n\nJonathan Younger’s Photon plugin lets you create photo galleries (like this one, designed by the incomparable Douglas Bowman) by exporting albums from Apple iPhoto to leading blog software environments. Photon supports Movable Type, TypePad, Blojsom, and WordPress. And because it is open-sourced, developers can extend it to work with non-iPhoto gallery software and with additional blogging tools.\n\nCreate photo galleries in Flash\n\nAtlanta-based web designer Todd Dominey is that rare artist who understands user experience and graphic design, web standards and Flash. In consequence, his SlideShowPro, a dynamic photo gallery/slide show component for Flash MX 2004, is as luminous as it is utilitarian.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe headline (“Apple caught cheating on RSS standard”) and the subhead (“New iPhoto feature disregards standards”) of Tom Sanders’s article both suggest that Apple is deliberately breaking the RSS standard with its Photocasting feature in the updated iPhoto application. I think it more likely that Apple’s implementation is simply, grandly inept.\n\nIt may be inept through knuckle-dragging unawareness of best practices in web design, as is the case with iWeb’s HTML markup.\n\nOr it may be inept because it was rushed to market. iTunes 6.0.2 and iTunes Updater are incompatible with Panther-based Macs but Software Update installs them anyway. It does this not because Apple wants to punish Panther and iPod users (at least, I hope not) but because, in rushing make its applications compatible with Intel and non-Intel Macs in time for the Macworld conference, Apple seemingly neglected to adequately test on any but the latest models of its hardware and operating systems.\n\nThis theory of insufficient testing doesn’t bring back the week I lost tracking down and working around the bugs and breaks Apple dumped on my Titanium Powerbook. And it doesn’t bring back the additional 10GB of drive space the iPod updater eats out of every iPod sold. But it is comforting to believe that these screwups are merely human error and not part of a conspiracy involving the CIA, the big pharmaceutical companies, and the Trilateral Commission.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCouldn’t make it to An Event Apart Philadelphia? Curious about what you missed? Our new, two-minute video reveals all. Well, anyway, it reveals what can be shown in two minutes. Shot on location at The Franklin Institute by filmmaker Ian Corey, it’s packed with thrills, chills, and design geekery.\n\nSee Zeldman explain why, the more words you have, the less you communicate. See Eric Meyer unveil the code behind last year’s best web layout. (Okay, so I’m prejudiced.) See Jason Santa Maria squeeze genuine typographic goodness out of two utterly common fonts. See lucky attendees win nifty prizes. See the music, hear the light.\n\nUpdated 24 January: SMIL video captioning by Andrew Kirkpatrick.

Specifically, he is looking for people who like to read about design and user experience. Are you one of them? Then here is your chance to sound off. What vital topics aren’t being covered (or aren’t being covered well) in the design and user experience books you buy? Where are publishers falling down? What are you dying to read? Let Lou know what you think.\n\nTechnorati is hiring\n\nTechnorati, a real-time search engine that keeps track of what is going on in the blogosphere, seeks a modern web developer, “proficient in state of the art LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) development, with emphasis on PHP and Apache.” More to the point, says Chief Technology Officer Tantek Çelik, the company is looking for one who has kept up with CSS, semantic markup, microformats, and unobtrusive JavaScript.\n\nEven more to the point, Technorati is looking for a smart web person who is tired of big-company bureaucracy, secrecy, and in-fighting, and seeks greater emotional and professional fulfillment—in other words, Technorati is looking for a web person who wants to make a difference. Yes, they really do write job descriptions that way, and not only in San Francisco, where Technorati is based. (Tags: technorati, jobs, webdevelopment.)\n\nFreight for sale\n\nFREIGHT (available from Phil’s Fonts) is a superbly detailed font family created by Brooklyn type designer Joshua Darden. Optimized for screen display, Freight is ideal for web interface design. You can also use it as a default font for such daily computing tasks as reading and writing email—makes a tasty break from Verdana and Georgia. Recent Darden fonts include Meta Headline (created at the behest of Erik Spiekermann and Christian Schwartz) and lovely, funky Omnes.\n\nKids with cameras\n\nIn Calcutta’s red light district, over 7,000 women and girls work as prostitutes. Only one group has a lower standing: their children. Zana Briski became involved in the lives of these children in 1998 when she first began photographing prostitutes in Calcutta. Living in the brothels for months at a time, she quickly developed a relationship with many of the kids who, often terrorized and abused, were drawn to the rare human companionship she offered.\n\nZana held weekly photography workshops between 2000 and 2003. There the children learned camera basics, lighting, composition, the development of point-of-view, editing, and sequencing for narrative. To Zana’s delight, equipped with inexpensive point-and-shoot 35mm cameras, the children produced incredible work. Their images are explosions of color: self-portraits, family pictures, street scenes, stunning tableaus of Bengali life.\n\nRuby on Rails podcasts\n\nAudio interviews with David Heinemeier Hansson, who invented Rails and manages it as an open source movement, plus Ruby on Rails heavyweights and pioneers including Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler, Rick Olson, and A List Apart’s Dan Benjamin.\n\nFairplay defined\n\nEverything you ever wanted to know about the digital rights management technology built into Apple’s iPod, iTunes, and iTunes Music Store.

A few words and references have changed to bring the piece “up to date,” but it is essentially the same article it was five years ago.\n\nFirst published when web design, buoyed by dot-com dollars, was at its most self-indulgent, the article dared to suggest …\n\nThat trendy elements are not the same as design\n\nThat design is communication\n\nThat most web design is meant to be used\n\nThat most web design should therefore be usable\n\nIt still makes these points and they are still true.\n\nThe good news is that in the five years since the article was new, responsible web design has emerged as a practice. And it is being practiced by many people who are first and foremost designers.\n\nThe bad news is that college and university design curricula are still mostly about everything but information architecture, usability, application design, user-focused design, accessibility, and web standards.\n\n[tags]zeldman, adobe, style vs. design[/tags]\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWHILE I’M WRAPPING Web Design World Boston, here are some links for your pleasure:\n\nIn Search of a Perfect Plug-in Technique\n\nFirst we had Flash embedding the automated way.

Walking the snowy Franklin Parkway at 5:30 am after not sleeping for two nights in a row can give you a heck of a head cold. (It wasn’t nervousness about the show that kept me from sleeping; it was my fourteen-month-old’s nighttime restlessness. Will I take the kid on another business trip? You bet.) Mostly I came home happy to have pulled off our first travelling road show and pleased that it seemed to please most who attended.\n\nAttendees came from as far away as Tokyo and London. There were plenty of locals, too. Philadelphia has a tight and engaged design community — you could see it and feel it.\n\nThere were problems. We were promised WI-FI for 150 people and barely had bandwidth for half that many. Some seats were more comfortable than others.\n\nBut most of the surprises were pleasant. Every attendee got a free book from New Riders—titles by Dan Cederholm, Hillman Curtis, Steve Krug, Marty Neumeier, Jakob Nielsen, Eric Meyer, and yours truly. Twenty people got free web hosting for a year courtesy of Media Temple. AIGA gave away posters, Pixelworthy gave away drinks. The event would not have been half so good without the caring support of these fine sponsors.\n\nJon Aldinger, Daniel Mall, Peter Santa Maria, and Rob Weychert provided invaluable ground support on the day of the show and the day before. Filmmaker Ian Corey videotaped the whole day for secret purposes that may be revealed at a later date.\n\nThe Philadelphia Standards Organization, blogging live, published the day’s schedule, to which we mostly adhered. In future posts here or at aneventapart.com I may talk more about what we covered and why. For now, I’ll defer to my co-host Eric Meyer, our special guest Jason Santa Maria, and various lovely people who came to the show:\n\nMr Meyer’s thoughts\n\nMore of Mr Meyer’s thoughts\n\nMr Santa Maria’s thoughts\n\nFlickr Event Apart photo pool (Flickr! beta is a Yahoo! product)\n\nAEA blog posts from all over (Del.icio.us! beta is a Yahoo! product as of today)\n\nAEA Technorati (Technorati has no exclamation point and is not yet a Yahoo! product but the day is young)\n\nNo rest for the wicked\n\nI am now at Web Design World, Boston; tomorrow I’ll keynote on web standards and do a session on the radically under-covered subject of writing as interface design.
