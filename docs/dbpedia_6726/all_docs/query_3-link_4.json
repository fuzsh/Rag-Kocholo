        "text": "I just wanted to let you guys know that the nice people over at TextDrive are offering a limited number of lifetime hosting deals. For $399 you get TextDrive hosting, for life! The deal includes:\n\n* 1 gigabyte server space (unmetered mail and database storage)\n\n* 20 gigabytes of bandwidth per month\n\n* up to 15 top-level domains (with unlimited aliases)\n\n* unlimited email mailboxes & aliases\n\n* shell access\n\nConsidering the feature list, this really is an excellent deal. The last time they did this, these things sold like hot cakes. But don't take my word for it, have a look around in their forums and see for yourself what people are saying.\n\nTextDrive Hosting for Life (Round II)\n\nEdit: If you signup and choose to support PunBB by selecting it in the drop-down on the signup page, e-mail me and I'll add you to the donor list and update your title in the forums.\n\n\"Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.\"\n\nand some web hostind limit your CPU usage ...\n\nI use lunarpages service, and paid for 200 gigabytes of bandwidth per month,\n\nbut last month, lunarpages suspend my site, because my site use HIGH CPU usage ...\n\nI use xoops for all site.\n\nnow I change to punbb, the lower CPU usage, but lunarpages still told me , I use more CPU % ...\n\nso , how about TextDrive ? I really need a Good web hosting ...\n\nSimply by\n\n- fantasya.net > \"a little traffic\" because the final version is not online (about 10gb) ... about 5000 visitors/day (but when fantasya was famous, we grew up until 80/90 per day !)\n\n- sortons.net > about 4000 visits/day, 150 000 pages / day and a lot of multimedia files to see or to download (sounds, videos et of course, photos) ...\n\nbut it's \"nothing\" > when you have a lot of multimedia, \"limited\" bandwidth is like a piege ...\n\nBut the price is simply great : our host is french ( http://www.ovh.fr ) ... and you have a good server (PIV 3ghZ, 512 ram, 80 Hd), and 20mb/s of bandwidth for 149 euros / month !!! (about 160$).\n\nOne example today I have put my magazine in 3 formats\n\n- picture gallery\n\n- zip file (11 mo)\n\n- pdf file (3,5 mo)\n\nPictures viewed 30 times about >>> 30x32 (pages) x 40 (ko average)\n\nzip file (11 mo) downloaded 90 times >> 90x 11 mo\n\npdf file (3,5 mo) downloaded or viewed 50 times ... >> 3,5x50 ...\n\nFOR ONLY ONE MEDIA (a magazine)\n\nwe have bandwitdh pics about 5 ~ 6mb/s on the day !!!\n\nI admit I'm a case : all photos of sortons.net = 6 go on the disk space !!! And a lot of people don't need this.\n\nAbout Textdrive I see often problems with connecting DB : normal ?\n\nThis is a design issue. You want to put tons of heavy data (images and the like), you pay for it. Nothing wrong with that (in fact it's quite the opposite, your bank account is good motivation to write good and well designed websites).\n\nAbout the lifetime deal, there is some question wether email storage is metered or not. And that's quite a difference."
