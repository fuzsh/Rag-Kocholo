        "text": "After his kidnapping on Thursday November 5, 2020, the abductors fighting to restore the State of Southern Cameroons, preferred by them as Ambazonia, have set out some rules for the traditional ruler to follow before he returns to his Palace. Cameroon News Agency has obtained an 8 minutes 23 seconds audio from the Bui Warriors Communication department, where a voice declares that the Bui Warriors and Ngoketundjia Restoration Forces have decided to release the Fon of Nso, under certain conditions agreed by the two parties.\n\nSeparatists say Sehm Mbinglo cannot return to\n\nA source has told CNA that they have released the Fon and asked him to return to Yaoundé.\n\nThe voice read, “After due interrogation, examination, re-examination and cross examination, His Majesty Fon Mbinglo was found guilty as charged…He had been induced into error by some Elites residing in French Cameroon…He agreed to meet the following conditions.”\n\nThat he is going to hands off completely from anything that has to do with politics and French Cameroun. In this regard, the Fon of Nso is going to send a resignation letter to Ambazonians. Resigning from been a candidate in the said Regional elections.\n\nhis palace until he meets their conditions\n\nThe Fon will only return to Nso upon fulfilment of this agreement else he might return to Yaoundé or anywhere else in French Cameroon where he could promote French Cameroon interests.\n\nUpon reoffending the people of Ambazonia, the Fon will be rearrested and penalized by the restoration forces accordingly.\n\nThe Fon agreed to work as untainted, uncorrupted traditional authority for the Nso people, following the footsteps of his own father to regain the lost glory for the Nso people and repair his own damaged integrity. The integrity damaged by his mingling with French Cameroon politics. Here, he reiterated his position never again to be a politician.\n\nThe Fon has also agreed to on his release, to send a direct message to Mr Paul Biya the President of French Cameroun, to release all our people held as Prisoners in French Cameroon dungeons beginning with President Sisiku Ayuktabe and members of his cabinet abducted by French Cameroon terrorist forces in Nera hotel Abuja Nigeria and all the other Ambazonians held in Cameroon prisons and cells.\n\nThe Fon equally agreed to urge Mr Paul Biya to get into the negotiation table with Ambazonia and end this senseless war declared by him on the Ambazonia people.\n\nAnd lastly the Fon of Nso agreed to tell or urge Mr. Paul Biya to stop all colonial activities in Ambazonia starting with the withdrawal of army and administration of occupation.\n\n“In the light of these, the Bui Warriors working hand in gloves with Ngoketundjia defense council, wish to announce to the Nso people, to national and international opinion as follows. His Royal Highness, Sehm Mbinglo, paramount Fon of Nso has been released by the Ngoketundjia Restoration Forces, he shall be making his triumphant home coming to Nso when the moment shall have been ripped. The Bui Warriors shall be joining the Nso population with open hands to receive his Majesty back home come this appropriate moment.”\n\n“Finally the Bui Warriors and the Ngoketundjia Restoration Forces hereby sound a loud warning to whosoever and all traditional rulers who venture to do French Cameroon politics on Ambazonia territory or who in anyway try to promote French Cameroon politics of any such on Ambazonia territory…Contrary to legislation and contrary to exigencies of the Ambazonia people…”\n\nCameroon’s Sinking Fund (CAA) informs that on September 30, 2020, the country’s public debt was XAF10,164 billion, representing 45.8% of GDP.\n\nAccording to the sinking fund, the debt is up by 1.3% year-over-year but down by 0.1% quarter-over-quarter. Meanwhile, compared with its December 2019 level, it is up by 5.7%.\n\nIt explains that since July 2020, the scope of public debt has gradually expanded to include the entire public sector (including the debt of public companies and institutions) when the information is available.\n\nIn detail, the public sector’s external debt is estimated at XAF7,110 billion (including XAF6,681 billion for the central government and XAF429 billion of direct external debt not endorsed by the state). As for the domestic debt, it is estimated at XAF3,019 billion, including XAF208 billion of over 3 months old outstanding debts.\n\nOverall, 61.3% of Cameroon’s bilateral public debt is owed to China (which is its main bilateral partner) and 28.5% to France. As for the multilateral debt, 30.1% is owed to the AfDB, 30% to the World Bank, and 17.1% to the IMF.\n\nThe match between Cameroon and Mozambique Thursday, November 12, 2020, in Douala will not be opened to spectators, authorities have said.\n\nIn a release issued Tuesday, November 10, by Cameroon’s minister of sports and physical education, only officials and players with access badges and authorized accreditations shall be permitted to enter the Douala Reunification Stadium.\n\nNarcisse Mouelle Kombi says the decision was taken at a meeting with officials of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and in conformity with COVID-19 preventive measures put in place by FIFA.\n\nThe minister of sports and physical education however has called on Cameroonians to follow the encounter on CRTV.\n\nThe match between Cameroon and Mozambique will count for the third day of play of qualification matches for “AFCON TOTAL CAMEROON 2021”. Cameroon will play the return leg match on Monday, November 16, 2020, in Mozambique.\n\nDespite the postponement of the competition from 2021 to 2022, CAF says the name remains AFCON TOTAL 2021.\n\nCameroon’s minister of public health Dr. Manaouda Malachie has earlier mentioned that the number of COVID-19 positive cases are on the rise in Cameroon."
