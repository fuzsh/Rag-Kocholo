Keep up-to-date with what's happening across the continent by listening to the Africa Today podcast or checking the BBC News website.\n\nA reminder of today's wise words:\n\nQuote Message: The child who hasn’t seen their mother in her youth thinks their father wasted the dowry.\" from A Luhya proverb sent by Allan Chagira in Kenya\n\nThe child who hasn’t seen their mother in her youth thinks their father wasted the dowry.\"\n\nA Luhya proverb sent by Allan Chagira in Kenya\n\nClick here and scroll to the bottom to send us your African proverbs.\n\nAnd we leave you with this photo from Instagram of young Ethiopians enjoying themselves at a coffee shop in the capital, Addis Ababa:\n\nUS and UK back Libya election plan\n\nBBC World Service\n\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson say they are committed to restoring a functioning government in Libya.\n\nSpeaking in London, Mr Tillerson said he did not want Libya to become a place where the Islamic State group could re-emerge as a force.\n\nMr Johnson said UN-led proposals for elections to be held in Libya within a year represented the right timescale.\n\nHe said a lot of political groundwork needed to be done to make the country ready, but that there was support among many Libyans for an election to happen.\n\nGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty Images\n\nSomaliland khat market quiet after Ethiopia clashes\n\nWe've been reporting on the clashes in Ethiopia between Oromo and Somali ethnic communities. Thousands of people are reported to be fleeing the violence.\n\nIt is also having an effect on neighbouring Somaliland.\n\nThe region where the fighting is talking place is also the area where khat - the popular leafy plant, which acts as a stimulant when chewed - is produced. Those who prepare the leaf for export have been caught up in the violence.\n\nAnd today the khat market in Somaliland's capital, Hargeisa is quiet as this short video from a BBC Somali colleague shows:\n\n'How I negotiated with al-Qaeda'\n\nStephen McGown was held hostage in Mali by al-Qaeda for six years.\n\nThe BBC World Service's Outlook programme has been looking into how his release was negotiated.\n\nThe programme heard from Stephen's father Malcolm and from Dr Imtiaz Sooliman who supervised the negotiations with the hostage takers.\n\nThe BBC's Matthew Bannister has been talking to all those involved in the edition of the programme:\n\nVideo content\n\nThis content is currently not available\n\nSA court considering case on Zuma corruption charges\n\nBBC World Service\n\nSouth Africa's Supreme Court has delayed giving a judgement in a case over whether nearly 800 corruption charges against President Jacob Zuma should be heard.\n\nMr Zuma's lawyer conceded that a 2009 decision to set aside the charges was irrational, but wants the chance to make further representations to the national director of public prosecutions.\n\nLast year, the High Court ruled that the president should face charges, after a legal challenge brought by the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance.\n\nMr Zuma has always insisted he is innocent.\n\nCorporal punishment 'is a tool to discipline my children'\n\nEducation authorities in South Africa's KwaZulu Natal province are investigating a teacher who has been seen caning a female pupil in a video that has emerged on social media.\n\nCorporal punishment has been banned in many countries, and was outlawed in South Africa 20 years ago, but is still a reality in many schools.\n\nBBC Focus on Africa reporter Randy Joe Sa'ah has been discussing the issue with a parent, Paul Verdzekov, and a student Ferdinand Bangha in Yaounde, Cameroon, where the practice is also banned.\n\nThe father of three told Randy that he uses corporal punishment.\n\n\"When you put a cane beside a child you see them on their heels and they follow you.\"\n\nBill Gates' African lunch tour\n\nAmerican entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates has shared an immersive 360 degrees video of his trip promoting nutrition for schoolchildren in Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya.\n\nMr Gates says that ensuring that schoolchildren are well fed will help improve their education.\n\nHe is particularly keen on promoting school lunches:\n\nQuote Message: School lunch in particular is really about education: getting kids to come... so that they are energetic enough to really learn while they are there. [School lunches are] a great thing. It doesn't solve all the problems but it's definitely part of the solution. \"\n\nSchool lunch in particular is really about education: getting kids to come... so that they are energetic enough to really learn while they are there.

that women are now free to marry non-Muslims, the AFP news agency reports.\n\nThe announcement upending the decades-old law comes a month after President Beji Caid Essebsi called for the government to scrap the ban dating back to 1973.\n\nA spokeswoman for the president posted on Facebook:\n\n\"Congratulations to the women of Tunisia for the enshrinement of the right to the freedom to choose one's spouse.\"\n\nUntil now, a non-Muslim man who wished to marry a Tunisian woman had to convert to Islam and submit a certificate of his conversion as proof.\n\nHuman rights groups in Tunisia had campaigned for the ban's abolition, saying it undermined the fundamental human right to choose a spouse.\n\nTunisia is viewed as being ahead of most Arab countries on women's rights, but there is still discrimination particularly in matters of inheritance, the report says.\n\n'My neighbours turned against me'\n\nPictures of lorries evacuating people from the Ethiopia's Somali region following clashes there are being widely shared on social media (see earlier entry).\n\nAbdulhakim Mohammed Kamil, who fled Jijiga town with his wife and child told the BBC:\n\nQuote Message: My own neighbours turned against me and the Somali [regional] police are also abusing Oromos residing in the town.”\n\nMy own neighbours turned against me and the Somali [regional] police are also abusing Oromos residing in the town.”\n\nHe expressed his concern for Oromo people still remaining in Jijiga and other towns in the Somali region.\n\nThe Oromia regional government spokesperson said his colleagues are working with the federal government and other stakeholders to safely evacuate those people still in the Somali region.\n\nLesotho king says top commander killing had 'scarred' nation\n\nLesotho's King Letsie III has told mourners at the funeral of the country's army commander, Khoantle Motsomotso, that his killing was an \"embarrassment\" and had \"scarred\" the kingdom, the AFP news agency reports:\n\nQuote Message: [ It has ] embarrassed us as a nation... making us a laughing stock of other nations.\"\n\n[ It has ] embarrassed us as a nation... making us a laughing stock of other nations.\"\n\nLt Gen Khoantle Motsomotso was gunned down last week by two officers at his office in a military barracks in the capital, Maseru.\n\nAFP quotes the king as telling political leaders to stop using the army for \"dirty\" work:\n\nQuote Message: My plea to all leaders is to stop sneaking around, approaching soldiers to do our dirty political missions while we promise them all sorts of things.\n\nMy plea to all leaders is to stop sneaking around, approaching soldiers to do our dirty political missions while we promise them all sorts of things.\n\nQuote Message: Let us stop engaging

General Lineo Poopa to \"work hard to get the army out of these serious, consistent problems\".\n\nThousands flee Ethiopia clashes\n\nThousands of people are fleeing Ethiopia's Somali region following clashes in recent days.\n\nEighteen people are confirmed dead following protests which erupted in towns in the east of the country, Adisu Arega, spokesperson of the Oromia regional government, told the BBC.\n\nHe said 12 of the dead were ethnic Somalis while the remaining six were Oromos.\n\nThe spokesman said that the trouble began when a special unit of police from the neighbouring Somali region arrested officials from Oromia, who were then killed.\n\nThis sparked protests and clashes between the two communities in eastern Ethiopia.\n\nOver the past few weeks there have been clashes in several villages on both sides of the border separating Ethiopia's Oromia and Somali regions.\n\nThe spokesperson of the Oromia regional government alleged that a special police and militia force of the Somali regional government as well as armed soldiers from the republic of Somalia had carried out killings deep inside Oromia region.\n\nOfficials on the other side of the regional border have a very different view on the events.\n\nMohammed Bile, an adviser of the Somali regional state president, told the BBC that the Oromo regional police were carrying out attacks against civilians at the regions common border.\n\n“They are targeting unarmed peaceful Somali civilians in those areas,” he said.\n\n'Three people shot' in tense south-east Nigeria\n\nStephanie Hegarty\n\nBBC Africa, Lagos\n\nEyewitnesses have told the BBC that three people have been shot by men in a military van outside a local government building, in Umuahia, south-east Nigeria, following clashes earlier in the week between the army and members of the separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob).\n\nTwo people died and one was rushed to hospital.\n\nTensions have been escalating in the area since clashes erupted earlier in the week and today’s shooting seems to be related.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ipob members hurled stones at a military convoy when it came close to the house of their leader Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAfter the incident, videos emerged online which have stoked tensions even further.\n\nOne video shared widely seems to show Ipob members being forced to lie face down in mud, the person filming says that one man was killed, but the BBC has been unable to independently verify that claim.\n\nIn a statement today, the Nigerian army said they were investigating these videos but also accused Ipob of publishing \"bogus, manipulated and photo-shopped photographs as well as video clips\".\n\nIn the city of Aba residents have been subjected to a curfew for four days after reports of local youths setting up road blocks to search for Hausa people, suggesting the clashes have taken on an ethnic dimension.\n\nIn Port Harcourt a police spokesman said that an officer was killed after youths seized his gun and a police hut was burnt down, 32 people have been arrested in the city.\n\n'Nigeria treats us like slaves' - but is Biafra the answer? - BBC News\n\nAll smiles at Mogadishu's book fair\n\nPeople have been sharing pictures from the book fair in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.\n\nAmong the participants is Boniface Mwangi, who has been promoting his book, UnBounded.\n\nOrganisers of the Mogadishu Book Fair say that as well as promoting books and culture, it also brings together writers, poets with members of the public.\n\nMr Mwangi, who is also a photo-journalist, has been enjoying the seaside too:\n\nChibok girls 'anxious' to go back to school\n\nReutersCopyright: Reuters\n\nWe reported earlier about the more than 100 young women who were kidnapped from a school in Chibok, north-east Nigeria in 2014, who will now be starting school at a special course at the American University in Yola, Adamawa state.\n\nMany of this group were freed in May and have been in the care of the state, receiving counselling and other help.\n\nLast night, the government held a farewell party for them in the capital, Abuja, where Minister of Women Affairs Aisha Alhassan spoke to the BBC:\n\nQuote Message: It's a very happy night... because when these girls came back they were so traumatised they didn't believe that they were free. They were having nightmares, you could see a lot of trauma in them... so we had to do a lot of therapy on them.\n\nIt's a very happy night... because when these girls came back they were so traumatised they didn't believe that they were free.

Estimates suggest about 800 people were killed and at least 7,000 are now displaced.\n\nThe government has now erected two official camps, in Juba and Hill Station, supported by UN agencies and non-governmental organisations.\n\nBut what has happened to the displaced. Photo-journalist Olivia Acland has been hearing some of their stories:\n\nOlivia AclandCopyright: Olivia Acland\n\nSince the mudslide, Kadi Kamara and her one-year-old daughter, Esme, have been sleeping in a windowless, half-built house without mattresses or bedding.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to move us out to one of the official camps,\" says Kadi, \"but we're still here. I think they've forgotten about us. We haven't had anything to eat since yesterday morning. Many people are getting sick.\"\n\nOlivia AclandCopyright: Olivia Acland\n\nTwelve-year-old Mariatu Bangura has packed her bag and is waiting to be transferred to the camp in Juba. She stands in the spot where her house once was, alongside her aunt. She was staying with her granny on the morning of the mudslide, but both her parents were killed.\n\n\"I am looking after seven children now,\" says her aunt, Mariah. \"It's very hard because I can barely afford to feed my own family. I know that there are problems with fake victims signing up for aid, but we are the real victims and we need more help\".\n\nSee more pictures on BBC News Online.\n\nKenyatta's party disowns plot to remove Chief Justice\n\nWe reported earlier that an MP from Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party had filed a petition calling for the removal of Chief Justice David Maraga over claims that he was influenced to annul Mr Kenyatta's win in the 8 August election.\n\nThe Daily Nation is now reporting that the party's secretary general has distanced the party from the petition:"
