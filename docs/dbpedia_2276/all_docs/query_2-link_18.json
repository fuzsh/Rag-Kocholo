        "text": "This Archdiocesan Ad Hoc Commission was created in the month of July 2018 by Most Rev. Cornelius Fontem Esua, Archbishop of Catholic Archdiocese of Bamenda as a result of the consciousness that many people have been severely affected by the ongoing sociopolitical upheavals/armed conflict in the North West and South Regions of Cameroon.\n\nThis Commission is made up of the Justice and Peace, Health and Social Welfare/Caritas Services. It has as mandate to provide Food and Non Food Items, Health Care, Psychosocial Support and Re-establishment of lost or destroyed Identification Documents to IDPs.\n\nWith support from the Diocese of Portsmouth, UK, the Ad Hoc Commission has been able to provide humanitarian aid to about 4.500 IDPs from the affected regions residing within Bamenda Town and beyond.\n\nPaying particular attention to nutrition, hygiene and sanitation needs, the following items were distributed to the IDPs; Washing Soap, Vegetable Oil, Beans, Maggi Cubes, Rice, Maize Dignity Kits, Palm Oil, Soya Beans, Garri (Cassava Flour), Groundnuts, and Koki Beans.\n\nSome Parishes equally benefited from this support. These are St. Joseph Mankon, Christ the King Mbengwi, St. Jude Fundong, St. Theresa Bamessing, Christ the King Fuli-Kom, St. Francis Xavier Bali Nyonga, St. Anthony Njinikom, All Saints Bayelle, St. John the Baptist Foncha Street, Immaculate Conception Ngomgham, Queen of Peace Njimafor, and St. Clementine Anwarite Yemge.\n\nGiven that there are many more IDPs than we have supported with the available means, added to the fact that the armed conflict is still ongoing, with a continues influx of IDPs, this Ad Hoc Commission, like Oliver Twist, continues to solicit for more support from organizations and people of goodwill, which will enable us better meet the humanitarian needs of these IDPs, while greatly praying that a lasting solution to this conflict is found soonest."
