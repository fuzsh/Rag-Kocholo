In introducing the Marian prayer, the Pope said: ÂMy venerable predecessor John Paul II called for the first ÂAfrican SynodÂ in 1994, in view of the year 2000 and the Christian third millennium. He, with his missionary zeal, made many pilgrimages to the African continent, he drew the content that emerged from that meeting in the Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa, launching evangelization in the continent once again. After fifteen years, this new Assembly continues in the firstÂs path, to verify what has been achieved, study some of the aspects and examine the most recent challenges. The theme chosen was: ÂThe Church in Africa at the Service of Reconciliation, Justice and PeaceÂ - accompanied by ChristÂs words to his disciples: ÂYou are the salt of the earth... You are the Light of the worldÂ (Mt 5:13-14). The Synod always constitutes an intense ecclesial experience, an experience of collegial pastoral responsibility towards a specific aspect of the ChurchÂs life, or, as in this case, of a part of the Christian People determined by geographical area. The Pope and his close collaborators meet with the designated Members of the Assembly, with the Experts and Auditores, to delve into the chosen theme. It is important to underline that this is not a study meeting, nor a programming assembly. Reports and interventions are heard in the Hall, there are discussions in the language groups, but we all know too well that we are not the protagonists: it is the Lord, it is His Holy Spirit, that guides the Church. The most important thing, for all, is to listen: listen to each other and, all together listen to what the Lord wants to tell us. For this, the Synod takes place in an atmosphere of faith and prayer, in religious obedience to the Word of God. PeterÂs Successor is entrusted with the duty to call and lead the Synod Assemblies, gather everything that has come from the works and then offer the appropriate pastoral indications. Dear friends, Africa is a Continent that has extraordinary human riches. Today, its population is approximately one billion inhabitants and the birth rate on the whole is the highest in the world. Africa is a land fertile in human life, but unfortunately this life is marked by much poverty and suffers from severe injustices. The Church is committed to overcoming this, with the force of the Gospel and the concrete solidarity of many institutions and charitable initiatives. We pray the Virgin Mary that she may bless the II Synod Assembly for Africa and achieve peace and development for this great and beloved ContinentÂ.Then after the Marian prayer, the Pope added in various languages: (in Italian) At the end of the Angelus this special Sunday, when I opened the II Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops, I cannot forget the conflicts that are presently threatening the peace and security of the peoples of the African continent. In these days I have followed with apprehension the serious episodes of violence that have shaken the population of Guinea. I offer my condolences to the families of the victims, I invite the parties to dialogue and reconciliation, and I am certain that they will spare no effort in reaching a fair and just solution. Next Saturday afternoon, October 10th, along with the Synodal Fathers, I will lead a special rosary in the Paul VI Hall Âwith Africa and for AfricaÂ, with the participation of RomeÂs university students. African university students in a number of countries will unite with them in prayer via satellite. Dear university students, I await you in great numbers to entrust to Mary Sedes Sapientiae the journey of the Church and society in the African continent. (In French) Today I open the II Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. I ask you to support the reflections and works of the Synod Fathers through your prayer. I also invite you to pray for the beloved African continent, which I visited last March. May God bless it and bring it peace, reconciliation and justice, and may He give the Church in Africa the strength and courage to be Âsalt of the earthÂ and Âlight of the worldÂ, to witness true life in Jesus Christ, I entrust this Synod to the motherly intercession of the Virgin Mary, protector of Africa! May God bless you! (In English) I invite all of you to join me in praying for the II Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops, which opened this morning in St PeterÂs Basilica. May this great ecclesial event strengthen the Church in Africa in her witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and in her efforts to promote reconciliation, justice and peace among its peoples. May the Synod also help turn the eyes of the world to that great continent and inspire renewed solidarity with our African brothers and sisters. As we entrust these prayers to the intercession of Our Lady, I invoke upon you and your families GodÂs blessings of joy and peace. (In German) With the Holy Mass in St PeterÂs this morning we open the II Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. The theme states: ÂThe Church in Africa at the Service of Reconciliation, Justice and Peace. You are the salt of the earth... You are the light of the world.Â To truly be the salt of the earth and light of the world, we need GodÂs mercy. We pray therefore to the Lord that he may render our brothers in faith in Africa, and ourselves, ambassadors of reconciliation, peace and justice. I wish you all a holy Sunday.\n\nAt the center of the II Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops will be the themes of reconciliation, justice and peace that were dealt with - 15 years ago - in the first Special Assembly dedicated to Africa which is still lacerated by genocide,, civil wars, AIDS, famine and numerous other sores. ÂWhen we speak of the treasures of Africa - underlined Pope Benedict XVI in his homily yesterday - our thoughts immediately turn to the resources its land is rich in and that, unfortunately, have become and often continue to be a reason for exploitation, conflict and corruption.Â ÂInstead - he emphasized - the Word of God makes us look at another inheritance: the spiritual and cultural one of which humanity has even greater need than it does of raw materials.Â The Pope underlined that ÂAfrica represents an enormous spiritual ÂlungÂ for a humanity that appears to be in a crisis of faith and hope. But this ÂlungÂ can take ill as well. And, at the moment, at least two dangerous pathologies are attacking it: first of all, an illness that is already widespread in the West, that is, practical materialism, combined with relativist and nihilist thinking. Without entering into the merit of the origins of such sicknesses of the spirit, there is absolutely no doubt that the so-called ÂFirstÂ World has exported up to now and continues to export its spiritual toxic waste that contaminates the peoples of other continents, in particular those of Africa. In this sense, colonialism which is over at a political level, has never really entirely come to an end. But from this same point of view we also have to point out a second ÂvirusÂ that could hit Africa, that is, religious fundamentalism, mixed together with political and economic interests. Groups who follow various religious creeds are spreading throughout the continent of Africa: they do so in GodÂs name, but following a logic that is opposed to divine logic, that is, teaching and practicing not love and respect for freedom, but intolerance and violence.Â The Church in Africa can make a Âgreat contribution to all of societyÂ, the Pope underlined. ÂReconciliation, a gift of God that men must implore and embrace, is the stable foundation upon which one builds peace, the necessary condition for the true progress of men and society, according to the project of justice wanted by God. In recent years the Catholic Church in Africa has known great dynamism,Â recalled Benedict XVI, turning to the lay faithful as well, Âcalled to spread the perfume of the holiness in the family, in workplaces, in schools and in every other social and political field.Â To protect children with a maternal hand, Âeven before they are bornÂ was one of the exhortations Benedict XVI made yesterday to Africa: Â The reality of childhood that constitutes a large and, unfortunately, suffering part of the African population.Â Children for whom the Church Â in Africa, and in every other part of the planet, demonstrates her maternal concernÂ Âeven before they are bornÂ. Taking up Âbriefly a suggestion that precedes any moral reflection or instruction, and that is still connected to the primacy of the sense of the sacred and of God,Â the Pope wanted to underline: ÂMatrimony, as it is presented to us in the Bible, does not exist outside of the relationship with God. Married life between a man and a woman, and therefore of the family that springs from that, is inscribed into the communion with God and, in the light of the New Testament, becomes the symbol of Trinitarian love and the sacrament of the union of Christ with the Church. To the extent to which it looks after and develops its faith, Africa could discover immense resources to give in favor of the family that is built on matrimony.Â\n\n[00015-02.08] [RE000] [Original text: Italian]\n\nFIRST GENERAL CONGREGATION (MONDAY, 5 OCTOBER 2009, MORNING) This morning, Monday 5 October 2009, at 09:00 a.m., in the presence of the Holy Father, in the Synod Hall in Vatican City, with the chant of the Hour of Terce, the work of the II Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops began, with the hymn Veni, Creator Spiritus.\n\nThe Holy Father Benedict XVI gave the following reflection.\n\nSpeaking of the action of the Holy Spirit, the Pope explained that it is only with that force that the Church can continue its work, and with his invocation, he prays that Pentecost be not only an event from the past but that it be recreated here and now. The Church, he explained, is not an organization, but the fruit of the Spirit towards the City of God that gathers together all cultures. And it is the tongue of fire itself that provides the right word, to achieve a real unity in plurality, collaborating in the creative act of God. There are three words to reflect on: ÂConfessioÂ, ÂCaritasÂ ÂProssumusÂ. ÂConfessio,Â said the Pope, is renewal and transformation because through GodÂs light we can see reality, know ourselves and then understand the reality of the world, and so bear witness and evangelize. Speaking of ÂCaritasÂ,the Holy Father recalled that Christianity is not just a collection of ideas, nor is it a philosophy: you become Christians out of love. Quoting the Biblical story of the Good Samaritan, the Pope reminded us that charity is universal and concrete. Universality starts from love of our neighbor, ÂProssumusÂ. The love that comes from the Holy Spirit, the Pope explained, calls on us to be actively responsible for our neighbor, which then becomes universal, to be the servants at this hour of the world.\n\n[00016-02.04] [00000] [Original text: Italian]\n\nThe integral text of the PopeÂs reflection will be published as soon as possible.\n\nThe Acting President for this session was His Em. Card. Francis ARINZE, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Divine Cult and Discipline of Sacraments (Vatican City).\n\nThe synodal assembly, opened yesterday by Benedict XVI who presided over the solemn Concelebration of the Eucharist in Saint PeterÂs Basilica, will gather together a representation of Prelates from around the world, on the theme The Church in Africa at the Service of Reconciliation, Justice and Peace. ÂYou are the salt of the earth ... You are the light of the worldÂ (Mt 5:13,14)\n\nAfter the Hour of Terce, the following intervened during this First General Congregation: the President-Delegate, - H. Em. Card. Francis ARINZE, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments (VATICAN CITY), for the Greeting by the President-Delegate; His Exc. Most Rev. Msg. Nikola ETEROVIĆ, General Secretary of the Synod of Bishops (VATICAN CITY), for the Report by the General Secretary.\n\nAfter the pause, H. Em. Card. Peter Kodwo Appiah TURKSON, Archbishop of Cape Coast (GHANA) intervened, for the Report before the Discussion by the General Reporter.\n\nAfter the reading of the Relatio ante disceptationem there was a brief moment of free interventions.\n\nThe integral texts of the interventions given in the Hall are published below:\n\n- GREETING BY THE PRESIDENT-DELEGATE H. EM. CARD. FRANCIS ARINZE, PREFECT EMERITUS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR DIVINE WORSHIP AND DISCIPLINE OF THE SACRAMENTS (VATICAN CITY)\n\n- REPORT BY THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE SYNOD OF BISHOPS, HIS EXC. MOST REV. MONS. NIKOLA ETEROVIĆ (VATICAN CITY)\n\n- REPORT BEFORE THE DISCUSSION BY THE GENERAL REPORTER, H. EM. CARD. PETER KODWO APPIAH TURKSON, ARCHBISHOP OF CAPE COAST (GHANA) The First General Congregation of the II Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops concluded at 12.25 with the Prayer of the Angelus Domini led by the Holy Father.\n\nThere were 226 Synodal Fathers present.\n\nThe Second General Congregation will take place this afternoon 5 October 2008 at 4.30 p.m. for the Reports on the five Continents.\n\nGREETING BY THE PRESIDENT-DELEGATE, H. EM. CARD. FRANCIS ARINZE, PREFECT EMERITUS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR DIVINE WORSHIP AND DISCIPLINE OF THE SACRAMENTS (VATICAN CITY)Most Holy Father,\n\nThe Bishops of Africa and Madagascar, and of the adjacent islands thank you for convoking this Second Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops.\n\nThe Church in Africa wants to be ever more faithful to that aspect of her mission which is to be at the service of reconciliation, justice and peace.\n\nOur continent has known avoidable suffering, injustice, oppression, repression, exploitation, tension, and war which drives people away from their homes and precipitates hunger and disease. But Africa has also known brotherly love, solidarity with the suffering, truth and reconciliation committees, regional help between countries and some steps towards integral development as Your Holiness spelt out in Caritas in Ventate.\n\nOur beloved Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,is our peace (cf Eph 2:14). He taught us that what we do to the least of his brothers and sisters, we do to him (cf Mt 25:40). He forgave those who were crucifying him and prayed for them (cf Lk 23:34). He sent his Church to be the light of the word and to function like salt and leaven in society (cf Mt 5:13, 14; Mk 9:50; Lk 13:21). He has sent us his Holy Spirit.\n\nThank you, Holy Father, for having convoked representatives of the Bishops of Africa to reflect during these three weeks, together with the Heads of your Dicasteries in the Roman Curia and representatives of the Episcopate from the entire Catholic world, with the help of a highly qualified body of theological and other experts, and representatives of priests, consecrated people and lay faithful.\n\nBless us, Most Holy Father, as we get down to work. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, may the work of this Synod help towards the promotion of reconciliation, justice and peace in Africa and Madagascar and also clarify better and intensify the role of the Church.\n\n[00009-02.04] [RE000] [Original text: English]\n\nREPORT BY THE GENERAL SECRETARY BY THE SYNOD OF BISHOPS, HIS EXC. MOST REV. MONS. NIKOLA ETEROVIĆ (VATICAN CITY)Holy Father,\n\nYour Eminences and Excellencies,\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters,\n\nÂIn the power of the Holy Spirit, I appeal to everyone: ÂBe reconciled to God!Â (2 Cor 5:20). No ethnic or cultural difference, no difference of race, sex or religion must become a cause for dispute among you. You are all children of the one God, our Father, who is in heaven. With this conviction, it will then be possible to build a more just and peaceful Africa, an Africa worthy of the legitimate expectations of all its childrenÂ[1].\n\nWith these words, Your Holiness displayed your apostolic concern and exercised your solicitude for the entire Church. In a particular way, inspired by the Holy Spirit who guides believers in their reading of Sacred Scripture, you used these words to express your love for the Church on pilgrimage in 53 countries in Africa and also for the entire African continent, a continent of great dynamism yet faced with many challenges. You pronounced these words in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, during your first Apostolic Visit to Africa from 17 to 23 March 2009. On this occasion you initiated, in ideal fashion, the work of the Second Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. At the end of the Eucharistic celebration in Amadou Ahidjo Stadium, on the Solemnity of St. Joseph, Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, you presented the Instrumentum laboris to the presidents of the 36 episcopal conferences in Africa, the heads of the two synods of bishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches sui iuris and the Assembly of Catholic Hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Egypt. This document is the basis for the work of our synodal assembly. At that moment, the stadium of Yaounde became the very heart of the continent, because closely joined to you as Bishop of Rome and Universal Pastor of the Church were the bishops of the particular Churches, who represented Âin some way the Church present among the peoples of AfricaÂ [2]. At the same time, Your Holiness invited all the faithful to support their Pastors in prayer in the preparation and unfolding of the great ecclesial event of the Second Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. Your Holiness then entrusted the celebration of the synodal assembly to the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Africa, invoking her intercession so that Âthe Queen of Peace might sustain the efforts of all who work for reconciliation, justice and peace!Â [3]. Holy Father, during the meeting with the Special Council for Africa in the Apostolic Nunciature of Yaounde, you were the first to recite the Marian prayer which you yourself composed to sustain the preparation of the synodal assembly and to implore the abundant grace of the Holy Spirit in obtaining a renewed dynamism for the Church in Africa, which always seeks better to serve all people of good will on the continent. At the beginning of our synodal work, we too recite this prayer so that the discussion during the synodal assembly might contribute to increasing hope in the peoples of Africa and the entire continent, and that it might contribute to imbue each local Church in Africa Âwith new evangelical and missionary zeal in service to reconciliation, justice and peace, according to the programme given us by the Lord himself: ÂYou are the salt of the earth Â you are the light of the worldÂ (Mt 5:13-14). May the joy of the Church in Africa at the celebration of this Synod be shared by the universal Church!Â [4].\n\nYour Holiness, your wish is now being realized as seen in the representatives of the episcopates from the various continents who have willingly accepted your call to participate in this synodal assembly to show their nearness to the Catholic Church in Africa, a part of the Universal Church full of promise. Greetings, then, to the representatives of the episcopal conferences of the other four continents and to the bishops from 17 countries. Together with their brother-bishops from Africa, they are prepared to pray, dialogue and reflect on the present and future of the Catholic Church on the African continent. In this way, they become a part of the synod process of giving and receiving, of participating in AfricaÂs joys, sufferings, hopes and concerns and of sharing spiritual gifts for the edification of not only the particular Churches in Africa but the entire Holy Church of God spread throughout the whole world.\n\nI extend heartfelt greetings to all 244 members of the Second Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops, of whom 78 participate by reason of their office, 129 as elected members and 36 as papal appointments. Among these are 33 cardinals, 79 archbishops and 156 bishops. As for the office they hold, 37 are presidents of episcopal conference, 189 Ordinaries, 4 coadjutors, 2 auxiliaries and 8 (arch)bishops-emeritus.\n\nI cordially welcome the fraternal delegates who represent 6 Churches and ecclesial communities, and express my gratitude for their having accepted the invitation to participate in this ecclesial event.\n\nI also greet 29 experts and 49 auditors who are prepared to contribute their important testimony to the synodal proceedings by enriching the discussion.\n\nI also wish to acknowledge the valuable collaboration of the assistants, translators and technical personnel, as well as the staff of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops. Without their skilled and generous contribution, this synodal assembly would not be possible.\n\nThe present report is composed of six parts:\n\nI. The Significance of the Apostolic Visit to Africa\n\nII. Some Statistical Data\n\nIII. The Convocation of the Second Special Assembly for Africa\n\nIV. The Preparation of the Second Special Assembly for Africa\n\nV. Methodological Observations\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nI. The Significance of the Apostolic Visit to Africa\n\nIn a special manner, I wish to greet the 197 synod fathers from the countries of Africa. In their name, I thank Your Holiness for your Apostolic Visit to Africa which was organized in light of the Second Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. With this Special Assembly in mind, Your Holiness chose the same theme for your first pastoral visit to the African continent: ÂYou are the salt of the earth...you are the light of the worldÂ (Mt 5: 13, 14).\n\nThank you, Holy Father, for the edifying teachings given during your apostolic visitation to Africa. Even though the visit was limited to two countries, Cameroon and Angola, all of Africa took an interest. Furthermore, your visit led to the strengthening of the bonds uniting, in faith, hope and charity, the Bishop of Rome and your brother-bishops in the episcopate, who are the heads of the particular Churches of Africa. At the same time, your visit strengthened the bond between them and the faithful entrusted to their pastoral care. This is particularly true among men and women of good will on the African continent. In fact, the Gospel, the Good News, is addressed to every inhabitant of Africa and the entire world. Making reference to the life of St. Josephine Bakhita, canonized on 1 October 2000 by the Servant of God, Pope John Paul II, Your Holiness proposed her splendid example in your wish that every man and women on the continent might be transformed by an encounter with the living God.\n\nToday also, Âthe saving message of the Gospel needs to be proclaimed loud and clear, so that the light of Christ can shine into the darkness of peopleÂs livesÂ [5]. The light of the Gospel scatters the darkness of sin, even in Africa, where men and women, longing to hear a word of pardon and hope, are willing to be transformed by Almighty God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. ÂIn the face of suffering or violence, poverty or hunger, corruption or abuse of power, a Christian can never remain silentÂ [6]. These evils affect everyone in Africa, who Âcry out for reconciliation, justice and peace which the Church offers them, not new forms of economic or political oppression, but the glorious freedom of the children of God (cf. Rom 8:21)Â [7]. Every member of the Church is therefore called to become an apostle of the Gospel, to bring the Good News to every African. ÂAlmost ten years into the new millennium, this moment of grace is a summons to all the bishops, priests, religious and lay faithful of the continent to rededicate themselves to the mission of the Church to bring hope to the hearts of the people of Africa, and indeed to people throughout the worldÂ [8].\n\nHoly Father, in light of the importance of your Message to the entire African continent and our synodal discussion on the Instrumentum laboris, the discourses from your Apostolic Visit are being made available in the following languages: French, English, Italian, Portugese and Spanish. Undoubtedly, these documents will be of great assistance to the synod fathers and will allow them to develop basic subjects related to the topic of the Second Special Assembly for Africa.\n\nII. Some Statistical Data\n\nTogether we thank the Good and Merciful God for the many gifts bestowed on the Church in Africa which are placed at the service of all, especially the poorest of the poor and the most in need. In particular, we give thanks for its great dynamism witnessed in the following statistics.\n\nIn a world population of 6,617,097,000 inhabitants, the number of Catholics is 1,146,656,000, that is, 17.3%. However, the percentage in Africa is higher. In fact, out of 943,743,000 inhabitants, the number of Catholics is 164,925,00, namely 17.5%. This figure is very significant if one considers, for example, that, in 1978, at the beginning of the pontificate of Pope John Paul \\pard softlineII, the number of African Catholics was about 55,000,000. In 1994, the year in which the First Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops was held, the number was 102,878,000 faithful, that is, 14.6% of the population in Africa.\n\nIn that same period, we also have a significant increase in the number of vocations to the priesthood and the consecrated life. In fact, thanks be to God, a consistent increase is witnessed in all sectors, particularly among ChristÂs faithful: bishops, priests, deacons, men and women in the consecrated life and committed lay people, among whom catechists occupy an important place. This is proven in a comparison of statistical data from 1994 with that of 2007."
