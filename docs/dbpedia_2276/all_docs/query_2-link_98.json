As they get set for this great day in their life, may Saint Francis and Saint Clare, intercede for them.\n\nLes Aspirants à Toket\n\nNo Comments\n\nLA SESSION DES ASPIRANTS CAPUCINS A TOKET (DU 7 AU 9 JUIN 2024)\n\n« Venez et voyez. Ils vinrent donc et virent où il demeurait, et ils demeurèrent auprès de lui ce jour-là » Jn. 1 :39\n\nLa session des aspirants capucins du Cameroun s’est tenue du 7 au 9 juin 2024 à Bafoussam, précisément à Toket. A cet effet, huit (08) jeunes, venus des différents coins du pays ont assisté à cette rencontre : Bovra Jérome (Yagoua), Gejung Brandon (Bamenda), Ambrose Nyuykighan (Kumbo), Bole Bibou Bienvenu (Yagoua), Zogning Thomas d’Aquin (Bafoussam), Priestly Liynuy (Kumbo), Fonkeu Remi (Yaounde), Chin Priestly (Yaounde).\n\nDurant cette session qui a débuté le 7 juin 2024 à partir de 17heure, plusieurs activités ont été menées. Ainsi donc, le vendredi a été une journée consacrée à l’accueil et présentation des différents assistants. Par ailleurs, le programme de la rencontre toute entière a été aussi présenté par le Frère Cedric Verbe après avoir prononcé son mot de bienvenu. Après cette présentation, le frère Christophe chargé des aspirants souhaita à son tour la bienvenue à tous les participants. Et la journée fut clôturée par la prière du couché.\n\nLa journée de samedi 8 juin fut pour sa part déterminante pour la session, car elle a connu le déroulement de la plupart des activités. C’est ainsi, après s’être resourcer de la grâce matinale via la messe, nous nous entamions avec le premier entretien conduit par le Frère Cedric. Il nous a entretenu sur le thème : « La Fraternité, un grand don Franciscain ». De cet entretien, il ressort que le don est quelque chose de gratuit, donnée sans aucune exigence, et la fraternité, comme un grand don aux franciscains à travers la personne de Saint François d’Assise, renvoie donc à la vie en frère.\n\nSuivant les explications, le Frère a présenté les valeurs de la fraternité franciscaine : la prière commune, le repas commun, les chapitres qui désigne les rencontres fraternelles dans le but de programmer, exhorter, corriger, évaluer les uns les autres ainsi que les activités de la fraternité ; le travail, le partage, les sorties communautaires, la récréation/sports/moment des divertissements. Il a mentionné aussi la dimension fraternelle des vœux de pauvreté, chasteté et obéissance. Pour donner le sens ou enrichir cette vie en frère, certaines valeurs sont importantes à cultiver : le respect mutuel, le pardon mutuel, la confiance, la tolérance, la présence effective. En somme, il a souligné que nous devons toujours penser, parler et agir communauté (always think, speak and act community)\n\nAprès cet échange, nous avons entamé une autre phase : les rencontres personnelles et les travaux communautaire. A 15h :30, nous avons repris avec une autre conférence, présentée par le frère Christopher : Pourquoi voulez-vous devenir Capucin ? la réponse permettra donc de déterminer le degré de l’amour que l’on a de vouloir adhérer cette vie.\n\nSuite à cet entretien, nous avons effectué une marche à la paroisse Saint Charles Lwanga de Ngouache. L’hors du repas, pour conclure officiellement la session, nous nous sommes échangés les mots des remerciements. Le dimanche, dernier jour de la session fut ouvert par les laudes suivie de la messe. Après le petit déjeuner, les frères sont rentrés chacun à sa destination.\n\nBovra Jérome et Chin Priestly\n\nFIVE FRIARS ORDAINED PRIESTS\n\nNo Comments\n\nPRIESTLY ORDINATION OF FIVE CAPUCHIN BROTHERS MARKS CELEBRATION AT BAMBUI\n\nBambui, June 29, 2024\n\nA momentous occasion unfolded at the Capuchin Friary of Bambui as five brothers – François Djorwe, Philip Mbungai, Rene Mbakou, Fabrice Awembom, and Michel Tiague- were ordained to the priesthood, bringing immense joy to the Capuchin Custody of Cameroon and the wider Church.\n\nAbout the ordinations in Bamenda of four friars (François, Philip, Rene, and Fabrice), the ceremony, conducted by Archbishop Andrew Nkea of Bamenda, commenced with a solemn Holy Mass at 9 AM, at Saint Joseph Metropolitan Cathedral Bamenda, coinciding with the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul. Alongside the four Capuchin brothers, two Jesuit priests and one Conceptionist were also ordained. Notably, Father Bernadine Gam, the newly ordained Conceptionist, had spent three years at the Capuchin Friary of Bambui during his theological studies at the Major Seminary of Bambui.\n\nThe ordination ceremony also included eleven deacons, among whom two were destined for the Archdiocese of Bangui in the Republic of Central Africa, and nine for the Archdiocese of Bamenda.\n\nIn his insightful homily, Archbishop Nkea underscored the significance of Saints Peter and Paul as co-founders of the Church of Rome, emphasizing the unity of the Catholic world under the leadership of Pope Francis. He quoted Saint Augustine, highlighting the Church as the mother of all believers and stressing the importance of fidelity to the Holy Father in Rome for authentic Catholic identity.\n\nArchbishop Nkea exhorted the newly ordained priests and deacons to dedicate their lives to the service of Christ and His Church, emphasizing the primacy of proclaiming the Gospel and administering the sacraments to the faithful worldwide.\n\nFollowing the solemn ceremonies in the Cathedral of Bamenda, festivities continued at the Friary of Bambui, where a celebratory feast honored the four newly ordained brothers amidst a spirit of jubilation and communal rejoicing.\n\nMeanwhile, in Douala, Brother Michel Tiague was also ordained on the same day, adding to the blessings received by the Church on this memorable occasion.\n\nLooking forward, the brothers continue to offer prayers for Brothers Elvis Tadzenyuy and Gotran Tata, who are set to be ordained priests on August 16th, 2024, at Saint Theresa Parish in Sop, within the Diocese of Kumbo.\n\nAs the Capuchin Order and the Church in Cameroon celebrate these ordinations, the community remains united in prayer and support for the ongoing vocations within its midst.\n\nGideon N. WIRSIY.\n\nCelebrating the “Cook”\n\nNo Comments\n\n23 YEARS BY FIRE\n\nMr Laisin Edwin, the friar’s long serving cook in the custody (23years) is appreciated by Shisong Fraternity as he quits his noble profession as COOK. This ceremony of thanksgiving took place in the Sacred Heart Fraternity (Shisong) on Sunday 14 April 2024.\n\nWhile thanking God for such a figure “Ta Lai” (as called by many friars) who had served different generations of friars, the House Guardian of Shisong, Br. Felix Afoni, implored the Most High’s blessings upon him and his lovely family for good health, peace and harmony.\n\nCelebrating Fraternal Proximity\n\nNo Comments\n\nFraternal proximity\n\nOn Sunday 31st of march 2024, Easter Sunday, the fraternity of Shisong entered the Novitiate Fraternity Sop. This was a moment to celebrate ‘fraternity’, to celebrate ‘brotherhood’ in the context of Jesus’ victory over death through his Resurrection. This fraternal moment was spiritually filled as brothers all gathered for vespers. From the chapel, all proceeded for supper where the Guardian of Sop, Br. Cornelius B. Wirsiy welcomed all the friars, expressing to each, showers of Easter wishes and blessings.\n\nThis fraternal moment continued the next day with prayers, mass, works, lunch to share the Easter Joy as brothers. The fraternal joy was heightened with the birthday celebration of some friars (Br. Cornelius, the Guardian and Br. Gui noel).\n\nAn Easter Football Encounter between the Postulants and the Novices spiced this moment of fraternal proximity. The day ended with another great fraternal touch: the GREAT TOMBOLA.\n\nOh! What a joy when brothers live together. And the Lord gave me brothers.\n\nministries in bambui\n\nNo Comments\n\nRECEPTION OF MINISTRIES IN BAMBUI FRIARY\n\nFEBRUARY 12, 2024.\n\nToday, February 12, 2024, St. Francis’ Capuchin Friary Bambui, Cameroon, lives another great event and moment in the life of nine friars who received the ministry of lector (Brs. Keflet Aseni, Gideon Nyuyshiyi, Magloire Demaya, Melchizedek Kpudzeka, Dimitri Mbombo, Herbert Yenika, Mbimenyuy Bongli, Achilis Ntumnyuy, and Emmanuel Fang) and four other friars, who received the ministry of Acolyte (Brs. Zachaeus Ntumnyuy, Steven Italo, Adolf Baba, and Anicet Njutapvoui).\n\nThis celebration began at 5:30pm with vespers in the Fraternity chapel, followed by the Eucharistic celebration, animated by friar students, officiated by the Custos, Br. Kenneth Ayeni Kinyuy, and concelebrated by all the other Friar formators of the fraternity.\n\nIn his homily, the custos dwelt on the word: Scroll, which appears a number of times in Holy Scripture, and holds the content of divine revelation. He focused more in the book of the Apocalypse (5:6) where we read that the scroll had seven seals and only Christ could break it or open it. Therefore, this seal must be continuously opened and this can only be realized when people give up everything and avail themselves as ministers and servants of the Scroll breaker, who himself is the Word. The Custos underlined that if today, people fail to persevere in the faith, resolve to embrace violence and other forms of evil, then we, as ministers and servants of the Word, need to ask ourselves if truly we are breaking the seals of the scroll and planting them in the lives of the people. Therefore, as Franciscans, with the gospel being our rule of life, our intellectual, moral, and spiritual influence should create positive marks in the society.\n\nTo the Lectors in particular, the father custos exhorted them to explore the Wisdom of God found in Sacred Scripture, in fact, to become Scriptures for others to read through their life of witnessing. To the Acolytes, the custos made reference to the book of Daniel (5:1-25), where Belshazzar took the sacred vessels from the temple in Jerusalem and drank fromthem together with his noble men and concubines, and immediately a hand appeared and wrote on the wall declaring the ruin of his pride, and the end of his reign. Consequently, the Acolytes were called upon to show reverence to the sacred vessels, for their care of these sacred vessels would portray the place God occupies in their lives, the reverence they have for the Holy. To crown it all, the preacher, reminding all friars that they are all vessels that still require the infilling of the Holy Spirit, urged that we all pray and work to avoid externalism and truly serve faithfully the Lord in the ministries in which we have all been called.\n\nFeelings of Brothers after the reception of Ministries\n\nFRIAR THADDEUS ESOPE (OFM CAP)\n\n12/02/2024\n\nVisit to the novitiate\n\nNo Comments\n\nMOTHERS VISIT THEIR CHILDREN\n\nVISIT OF CWA, SOP PARISH TO THE NOVITIATE FRATERNITY,\n\nFRIDAY- FEBRUARY, 9 2024.\n\nIt was at about 12:25 PM that a large crowd of Catholic Women Association (CWA), dressed in their marian uniform stormed the friary and all settled around the fount of Our Lady, singing Marian songs. This was an occasion for these mothers to express their joy for the presence of the Capuchin Friars in Sop Parish. The Divisional President of the CWA, Mme Cornelia Liydzeka, speaking on behalf of the mothers, expressed her joy for the presence of the friars, reminding them that their tradition of visiting the Novitiate Fraternity and bringing them some food stuffs as mothers, has not and will never be forgotten. On his part, the Fraternity Guardian, Br Cornelius Bamenjo expressed his heartfelt thanks to the mothers, for always coming to their assistance, spiritually as well as materially.\n\nNo Comments\n\nConsecrated Life Celebrated / La Vie Consacrée Célébrée\n\nCelebration of Consecrated Life in Bambui Deanery\n\nFriday, February 2, 2024.\n\nSr. Marceline Mokia Mbuh, a Capuchin Sister of Mother Rubatto (Bambili), tells us that this celebration took place in Bambili with the Sisters of Christ, the Capuchin sisters of Mother Rubatto, The Capuchin Friars, and the Marist Fathers, all present in the Deanery. It was an occasion to thank the Lord for his call and a moment to renew the call to follow Christ. The message retained for the day was: “Consecration is not a burden rather a joy. It does not bring sorrow, it brings joy. Consequently, a sad religious is a contradiction”. Thus, celebrating this day, according to sr. Marceline, remains an occasion for people to know who we are, the life we have chosen and the value of consecration in the world today. Moreover, it is necessary to let young people know that it is not what they are that makes them happy but who they are. All in all, my wish and prayer is that all Consecrated Persons, beginning from me, radiate joy to the world.\n\nSr. Marceline Mokia Mbuh, Capuchin Sister of Mother Rubatto\n\nWas Consecrated Life celebrated in Mamfe Diocese?\n\nSr. Elizabeth Kinyuy (Capuchin Sister of Mother Rubatto, Mamfe), what have you to tell us about the celebration of Consecrated Life in Mamfe? Sr. Elizabeth Kinyuy tells us it was a wonderful celebration in Mamfe, on Sunday February 4, 2024, around their Chief Shepherd, Mgr. Aloysius A. Fondong. She tells us that, they as Consecrated Persons in the Diocese of Mamfe, did celebrate their consecration in the context of the Silver Jubilee of the Diocese. She makes us understand that the Bishop thanked all Consecrated men and women for the witnessing in his Diocese. He equally reminded them of the Letter of Pope Francis calling on consecrated men and women to go back to the roots. Sr. Kinyuy tells us that this celebration gave her an opportunity to revisit, to revise, to check, to edit, infact, to evaluate her calling, and motivation for choosing this life. As her own message of the day, sr. Kinyuy said: “If we are to be true witnesses we must do so in joy.\n\nThe inner joy that the challenges of life cannot take away”. She profited to check the things she clings to, which take her off from the lane, from the life she has willfully accepted to live. How to do away with what prevents her from being faithful to her spouse, was the assignment she gave herself. The Bishop, Aloysius A. Fondong, left a question to all Consecrated men and women present, that if their founders and foundresses were to come back to this life, will they really recognize them as their disciples? A question Sr. Elizabeth rephrased as: if my foundress, Mother Rubatto was to come back, will she recognize me as her daughter?\n\nSr. Elizabeth Kinyuy (Capuchin Sister of Mother Rubatto, Mamfe)\n\nWorld day of consecrated life in the Archdiocese of Bamenda\n\nThe day of Consecrated Life in the Archdiocese of Bamenda was celebrated in Bambui Deanery, precisely in Our Lady of Fatima Parish, Bambili, on Sunday the 4th of February 2024, in the presence of Mgr. Andrew Fuanya Nkea, the Archbishop of Bamenda Archdiocese.\n\nThe Archbishop ceased this opportunity to express his gratitude to all Consecrated Persons in the Archdiocese, for their close collaboration with him and for their life of witness amongst God’s People.\n\nHe encouraged the Christians present at this solemn occasion to always support the Consecrated Persons God has given them.\n\nTo the young people present, he exhorted them to embrace this way of life without fear, without hesitation for God who calls, gives the grace even though we need to collaborate with his grace. Other activities spiced the day, such as, Choral music, sketches, and fashion parades.\n\nBr. William Kongnyuy (OFM. Cap. Bambui)\n\nBafoussam Diocese was not left out\n\n“IT’S OUR LIFE, IT’S OUR FEAST” was the slogan adopted to adorn the day of the Consecrated Life in Bafoussam. The celebration of Consecrated Life in the Diocese of Bafoussam took place at the St. Joseph Cathedral Bafoussam, with about 44 Religious Orders/Congregations/Secular Institutes/New Communities. The celebration was preceded in February 1, 2024, with activities such as: a visit to an orphanage in Kouogouo II (Bafoussam Deanery), a friendly match with the Diocesan clergy and religious men at the Cathedral Stadium, a friendly match between the religious women, vespers and a cultural evening at the Cathedral hall.\n\nFebruary 2, 2024, at 9:55, Consecrated Men and Women, working in the Diocese of Bafoussam, coloured the Cathedral with their presence at the Eucharistic celebration presided over by His Lordship, Mgr. Paul Lontsie-Keune, Bishop of Bafoussam.\n\nCommenting on the Table of the Word, the Chief Shepherd, expressed gratitude to all the consecrated men and women for their presence in the Diocese, for the touch they give to the lives of the faithful in the Diocese, stressing that the Church in Bafoussam needs them and loves them. He encouraged the all present saying that in the face of secularism and all the ills society undergoes, all that the world proposes to man in today’s society, consecrated persons should still stand as witnesses and true witnesses to Gospel life. He acknowledged challenges that come as a result of their consecration, saying that some, as a result of those challenges start nurturing the idea to quit. He reassured such consecrated persons to go back to the first day they made their step into the congregation. He regretted too the fact that elderly consecrated persons turn to devalue the young ones who just come into the life, telling them they have no space because they have made no experience of religious life, hence, making life a hell for the young ones who come into this way of life with a lot of zeal and enthusiasm. He cautioned such persons that even a postulant has something to offer into the congregation, for it is not the number of years spent in the congregation that makes one holy. Moreso, the Bishop exhorted all Consecrated Persons to live their consecration with Joy, for without joy, we start dying and our consecration dies too. To crown it all, Mgr. Paul underlined that Consecrated Life has its beauty and value only through the cross. He then admonished that each Consecrated Persons sees meaning in his or her daily cross as a test to his or her consecration.\n\nThe novelty brought by His Lordship, Bishop Paul to this solemn celebration of Consecrated Life, was his invitation to the Diocesan Group “Sainte Anne” (a group for widows) to participate at this celebration. He said that like Anne, the widow in the Bible, they too have consecrated their lives to serve the Lord in his Holy Temple and in the upbringing of their children. He then encouraged them to be faithful to the Lord and in the upbringing of their children.\n\nBr. Cedric Verbe K. (ofm Cap.- Bafoussam)\n\nHow was it in Kumbo Diocese?\n\nThe celebration of Consecrated Life in the Diocese of Kumbo began on Thursday, February 1, 2024 at 8:30am, with the talk at the Cathedral on: DO OUR LIVES AS CONSECRATED PERSONS REFLECT THE JOY OF ETERNITY. This talk helped the participants to revive their calling as missionaries of joy in a society and in an environment where many are saddened due to the socio-political climate and its effects on the populace. After the talk, came sporting activities with two matches of football: the first being: Religious Women against the Youths of Meluf Denary and the last match, Religious Men against the Diocesan Clergy.\n\nOn the D-Day, that is, February 2, 2024 at 9am, a Holy Mass was celebrated in the Cathedral Church with the Chief Shepherd, Bishop George Nkuo, Bishop of Kumbo Diocese. A beautiful celebration animated by Shisong Community of the Tertiary Sisters of Saint Francis. The Bishop used the occasion to remind all consecrated Persons to get back to the roots of their call and to use this moment to renew their calling. He expressed the desire that the celebration be extended to all the Faithful, since we are all consecrated, each in his or her own way. The day ended with some refreshment, and recreational activities.\n\nCapuchin Postulant, Paulino – Shisong\n\nBr. Albert kilofonyuy (Capuchin Novice) gives his own witness In the Diocese of Kumbo, the World day of consecrated life which is celebrated on the 2nd day of February as the D-day, rather started with some sporting activities on the 1st of February 2024. These activities took place in the SAC Nso sports complex. On the 2nd day of February, the world day of consecrated life, the events of the day started with Holy Mass at the Kumbo Cathedral at 9:00am. This Mass was celebrated by his Lordship Bishop George Nkuo, Bishop of Kumbo. The liturgy was superfluous and well animated. What marked most Br. Albert was the fact of seeing many congregations still present in Kumbo in spite of the socio-political situation. This brought to mind the fact of Consecrated Persons being signs, pointers to the future reality; their presence have given hope to the hopeless, and life to the lifeless. May God’s Holy Spirit continue to accompany all Consecrated Persons in being true witnesses to the society.\n\nAnd in Rome, how was it celebrated with the Pope?\n\nBr. Peter Tar tells us more\n\nReflecting on the prophetic anticipation of the Lord’s arrival as foretold by the prophet Malachi, the Pope said that while the people were long for their salvation, prophets kept their hope alive through their prophecy like Malachi in the first Reading for today– “the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple”- the Pope upheld the figures of Simeon and Anna, who after being enlightened by the Holy Spirit, they waited in hope everyday in the temple for the fulfillment of the promised salvation. “It is good for us to look at these two elders who were waiting patiently, vigilant in spirit and persevering in prayer. Their hearts have stayed awake, like an eternal flame. They are advanced in age, but young at heart,” he said. They did not allow their age to weigh down on them nor given in to disappointments and hardship. In the child Jesus, they were able to see the promised Messiah to the nations. He went on to say that waiting for God is vey important in our faith journey because everyday the Lord visits us, therby revealing himself to us in an unexpected way. We therefore should wait in an expectant hope. The worse thing that can happen to a Consecrated person is to let our spirit doze off; to let the heart fall asleep; to lock hope away in the dark corners of desolation and resignation. Simeon and Anna’s ability to preserve the flame of hope is an indication to Christians, in a world filled with distractions, to remain with their eyes fixed on God in expectation. “By staying awake in expectation of the Lord, they are able to welcome him in the newness of His coming,” he said.\n\nAnd directly addressing Consecrated men and women, he says that there is the present danger of running behind doing things to the detriment of our religious calling. That sometimes we risk our community and personal life by calculating the odds of success, instead of cultivating in total humility the small seed that has been entrusted to us. That we have lost the ability of patient waiting with open hearts for the Lord like Simeon and Anna.\n\nObstacles to waiting\n\nThe Pope then identified two obstacles that hinder the ability to wait. The first, he said, is the neglect of the interior life, where weariness prevails amazement, where habit takes the place of enthusiasm, where conflicts or negative experiences turn us into bitter persons. He says it is not good to ruminate on bitterness, but to recover the lost grace through an interior life through the spirit of joyful humility and silent adoration in order to reawaken the amazement of the first day of our profession. The second obstacle is adapting to a worldly lifestyle that ends up taking away the Gospel. This is characterized by speed, activism, and the pursuit of immediate gratification. In this case, silent is banished and lost from religious communities. He then calls us to slow down the pace at which we are going. “Where silence is banished and lost, waiting is not easy, for it requires an attitude of healthy passivity, the courage to slow our pace, to not be overwhelmed by activities, to make room within ourselves for God’s action,” he said.\n\nThe Pope continued with a call to cultivate a spirit of waiting, careful that “the spirit of the world does not enter our religious communities, ecclesial life and our individual journey, otherwise we will not bear fruit.” Like Simeon, he added, “Let us also pick up this child, the God of newness and surprises. By welcoming the Lord, the past opens up to the future, the old in us opens up to the new that he awakens.” Pope Francis concluded his homily reminding those present that “these questions are for us, for our communities and for the Church.”\n\n“Let us be restless, let us be moved by the Spirit, like Simeon and Anna. If, like them, we live in expectation, safeguarding our interior life and in conformity with the Gospel, we will embrace Jesus, the light and hope of life.”\n\nBr. Peter Tar (ofm Cap.

Author Nga Abanfegha. This spiritual exercise, had as anchor, the question by God to Cain in the book of Genesis (4:9): Where is your brother (Abel)? Where is my brother? Br. Author, the retreat director, helped the friars to reconsider the place of FRATERNITY in the life of a disciple of St. Francis of Assisi, who rejoiced in his Testament saying: “And the Lord gave me brothers.” The preacher stressed we all are members of the same family as friars, infact, that we are all in the same boat where, what affects one, affects all.\n\nBiblical personages were examined in line with the brotherhood such as: Esau and Jacob (Gn. 25:27-34), whereby the conflict between the two brothers brought about their separation especially at the moment Jacob received the blessings of his brother Esau. The page on Joseph and his brothers in Gn. 37 was another opportunity to examine how brotherhood could be shattered; where the brothers of Joseph (all sons of the same father) cultivated hatred for Joseph because he was so loved by Jacob more than the others, he came reporting his brothers to their father (Gn. 37:2), above all, his dreams injected jealousy into the life of his brothers; the consequence being their hatred and desire to eliminate their own brother. Another picture of brotherhood brought for meditation was the story of the Lost Son – the younger brother. At his return, his elder brother refused to welcome him. These stories were therefore seen as realities that a fraternity like ours could undergo, where a brother could fight to be at the place of the other through fraud as in the case of Jacob, where out of hatred and jealousy, a brother could desire to eliminate the other as did the brothers of Joseph and even reject a brother as did the eldest son in the parable of the Lost Son. But in the case of Andrew and Simon, we see a brother who works for the other’s good. Andrew sees Jesus, then goes to bring his own brother to Jesus.\n\nBrothers bringing each other to Jesus\n\nAs a result, the retreat director, Br. Author, therefore asked each friar to bring the other friar closer to Jesus, to have the good of each other at heart, avoiding all that destroys, harms or shatters fraternity. This would help us avoid the response given by Cain to God: “I do not know, Am I my brother’s guardian?” (Gn. 4:9)\n\nTwins Speak (paroles aux jumeaux)\n\nNo Comments\n\nParoles aux Jumeaux\n\n(Twins Speak)\n\n“And the Lord gave me brothers” (Saint Francis of Assisi). In gratitude to God for the richness in vocation for the Custody of St. Francis of Assisi in Cameroon (4 final professed friars and 9 Capuchin deacons), the wish is to hear these friars tell us their feelings, and their motives for accepting to make such steps into the Order. What do they wish for the Order, the Church and God’s People? We shall listen to some of them speak to us. Over to you brothers?\n\nFinal Professed and Deacons\n\nBr. Adolph Baba\n\nBr. Adolf is happy to give himself to the Order and for the Order accepting him .\n\nhttp://www.ofmcapcameroon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WhatsApp-Ptt-2023-12-08-at-10.36.50.ogg\n\nDeacons\n\nBr. Rene Mbaku\n\nBrother Rene is grateful to God for his love and mercy, for having looked upon him, by raising him to the ministry of the Word, a ministry which is not for export, a ministry that carries a message he has to propose to others and to impose on himself, since he has to read the Gospel, believe in it and then, put it into practice.\n\nBr. Elvis Tardzenyuy\n\nBefore the ordination, I was cogitating on the word Reverend. After ordination, many will be calling me Reverend. So, I asked myself if all would end only at that calling. I therefore told myself : “Elvis, that calling of Reverend should be in perfect harmony with your acts.” Truly, I am happy to be ordained a Deacon for the Order and for the Church. I am happy because God has given me this wonderful gift of ministering to His people. This is something wonderful for me. I do not merit it, but his love has made me who I have become. So, my duty and task is SERVICE. Having been ordained, I even asked to know what had changed in me. I am still Elvis, right? But then, something more has happened to Elvis, something spiritual has taken place in me. So, 1Tim. 4:13 is a text that has inspired me in accepting this call to be a minister of God : “Devote yourself to reading, preaching and teaching until i come.” This phrase of St. Paul sums my mission: one who reads (the word of God), preaches (more by deeds) and teaching (according to the mind of the Church). I therefore pray to be a faithful deacon, a faithful servant of God for the rest of my life.\n\nMay God give me this single grace.\n\nBr. Esope Thaddeus Moseu\n\nI thank God Almighty for this grace to share in this ministry, it’s a great joy, I thank my parents for accepting that I follow God’s call, I thank my formators from postulancy till date, I pray for continues grace to be a good and fruitful minister of the word, and to be part of the goodness of God in and for our custody. “Your word Lord is a lamp for my feet”. This is the phrase that leads me into the ministry. Sometimes in life, it is difficult to predict which path to take or steps to make, but I came to realise that at the moment of confusion, the answer is the bible, that is, God’s Word. In it, I gain consolation for my worries. The above word of action has been a source of comfort and guidance to me, I have seen, I still see and will stil see God’s hands in my life and vocation. In fact, His Word serves as a source of illumination in the darkness of my journey, providing clarity and wisdom, peace and fulfilment, knowledge and truth and hope.\n\nDespite all, God’s faithfulness still leads me on to a place of purpose and fulfilment.\n\nBr Michel Laubryl Tiague\n\nI thank God for having called me to serve at his altar as a deacon. I’m very happy for this great gift to me and to the Order at large. Before the Ordination I chose as Motto 2Tim 4:2 to preach the Word at all time, welcomed or unwelcomed… because the world is fast changing and the tendency is to please the people and not say what the Word of God demands of us. So I resolutely take upon myself to proclaim it with boldness and therefore live accordingly. I sincerely thank the Community of Bambui and the Custody for making that day a wonderful day. May God continue to bless and strengthen us in this path of life.\n\nBr. François Djorwe\n\nAfter the ordination I was very happy and at the same time challenged by what I had brought myself into. This is due to the fact that, today we live in an era where the world is proposing ideas that are very appetizing, ideas which even contradict the Gospel message. So, I chose as motto: Let thy will be done not mine. (Lk 22:42b), as a reminder, that l have been ordained to always search, know and do the will of God. In fact, this is not only a motto but a prayer. Consequently, my vision has always and remains, being a happy and a faithful servant of God wherever I find myself no matter the circumstance.\n\nBr. Fabrice Awembom\n\nI feel very happy and grateful to God for my ordination on this day. I have done nothing to merit this grace and can only express my gratitude to the one who had ordained this from the beginning of time. I equally feel grateful to all who have been journeying with me and have contributed in one way or the other to bring this day to it’s realization. May God himself be their reward. We are merely servants…”(Lk. 10:17). God’s call, is always a call to loving, humble and selfless service and not to self-glorification. Such is the ministry of the diaconate to which he has called me. I therefore find in this verse in Luke’s gospel a true reflection of what Jesus expects of me as a deacon in the church of which he is the head and it is my wish to commit myself to it with an undivided heart: humble, loving and selfless service in the name of Christ.\n\nBr Philip Nyuysemo Mbungai\n\nI, Br Philip Nyuysemo Mbungai, OFM cap, feel so happy as I see myself continuing on my vocational journey. I’m glad for God’s call and for His Grace that have led me this far. I chose as my motto: Do to me according to your word (Lk 1:38) this is supported by Psalm 51:11, “Do not cast me away from your presence nor deprive me of your Holy Spirit.” All of these, remind me of the one who has called me and whose will I have to carry. It is for me to be a true servant, dedicated and ready to go out to serve my neighbours, knowing that it is in His will and spirit that I act.\n\nBeloved brothers, may the Lord of all goodness, bring to fulfilment the good work started in you.\n\nMay St. Francis and St. Clare intercede for you.\n\nTWINS IN BAMBUI\n\nNo Comments\n\nTWINS IN BAMBUI\n\nFinal Profession and Diaconal Ordination\n\nGreat things we have promised God, greater things has he promised us, says Saint Francis of Assisi. Saturday, 2nd December 2023, the Order of Friars Minor Capuchins (OFM. Caps), Custody of Saint Francis of Assisi in Cameroon, was graced with a twin celebration, that is, the Final Profession of four friars (Zachaeus Ntumnyuy, Italo-Steven Lele, Adolph Baba and Anicet Ariel) and the Diaconal Ordination of 10 friars (9 Capuchins: Brs.

What a blessing!!!\n\nNo Comments\n\nThe official blessing & opening of the Capuchin friary in the Diocese of Buea as a Domus Ordinis by the Provincial Minister Angelo Borghino on the 29th September 2023\n\nOne of the greatest fruits of the Extraordinary Custody Assembly convoked by the General Curia animated by the General Councillor fra. Kilian Ngitir, who providentially is the second Cameroonian Capuchin friar, accompanied by Fra. Akilu Petros from the Solidarity office of the Order and the Provincial Minister fra Angelo Borghino held from the 25th – 26thof September 2023, was the official opening of the Capuchin friary in Buea.\n\nThe Occasion commenced with a Pontifical high mass presided over by fra Kilian Ngitir, concelebrated by Fra Kenneth Kinyuy (Custos), fra cyril Kerla (Guardian of the said fraternity) and the Provincial Minister. Furthermore, in attendance was the august guest, fra Akilu Petros and fra Theophile Seka, a member of that fraternity.\n\nThe blessing proper of the sacred vessels, the Lectern, the liturgical books, the Cross of Saint Damian and the general blessing of the house graced the Capuchin presence in the Diocese of Buea with a Domus Ordinis a Landmark in the administration of fra.

Immense thanks equally go to Fra Nestor Nyamnjo, the project coordinator for his ingenious and meticulous follow up of this noble project till this stage. We cannot forget our benefactors especially Mr. Divine Feh a great and God-given Contractor, for his untold contributions.\n\nThe story began on the 18th May 2021 with the pecking of the foundation, then the digging and casting of pillars.

Br. Kenneth Kinyuy, the Custos, welcomed all the brothers present. He expressed gratitude for the presence of the brothers especially the presence of Br. Kilian Ngitir (General Councilor for Africa), Br. Wachamo Aklilu Petros (from the solidarity office in the Curia), and the Provincial Minister, Br. Angelo Borghino, for making it for the Assembly. The Custos, Br. Kenneth, basing on the word “rapprochement”, indicated that the assembly would be a moment of verification, whereby information received by the Curia and the Provincial has to be verified and clarified so that we all, as friars, move on the same footing and to the same direction.\n\nBr. Kilian intervened after the Custos. He expressed the General Minister and his council’s worry about Cameroon concerning the postulancy project and other projects of the Custody. He acknowledged the fact that the postulancy had been an urgent project for the past 9 years, a project which is being realized today in Mbohtong. He indicated that this giant project was happily welcomed by the Curia even though, along the lines, the project has undergone some misunderstandings, reasons for their presence at Assembly, an opportunity for clarity to be made on the Postulancy project and to see together the steps to take for the realization of this noble project so dear to the Custody.\n\nAfter the intervention from the Curia, through Br. Kilian, the Provincial Minister spoke up. He spelt out that the assembly is convened because of the need to enlarge our reflection as a custody, on the custody and its future. Moreover, pointing to the numerous projects of the custody as a major concern, the provincial explained that the fundamental question is not on the mistakes made about these projects not discussed or clarified with him, but on the mentality behind these projects. He even enquired to know if it was important to build people or the walls. He further highlighted the place of authority as service. In his presentation about the animation of the custody’s life by the council, two points were looked into: firstly, that the Custos and his Council ought to animate spiritually, pastorally, and fraternally the life of every fraternity and brother. He stated that in all the superior does, he must ask himself how what he does is of help to the brothers to faithfully respond to the call of Jesus Christ.\n\nSecondly, that listening to the brothers is of prime importance in animating the brothers and of great value or service to fraternal life.\n\nMoreover, Br. Borghino, the Provincial Minister, gave guidelines on how to animate the custody based on his own experience as councilor and provincial.\n\nThe need of the custos to visit brothers in their fraternities and in their functions such as bursars, guardians etc.\n\nThe need to create active commissions to assist the council.\n\nGiving more accent to formation of brothers in the custody and that a healthy relationship exists between the superiors and the formators.\n\nAfter the Provincial’s interventions, brothers went into constituted groups of 7 to evaluate the Custody’s activities. This evaluation was guided by the following questions:\n\nQUESTION ONE\n\nApproximately five months after the celebration of the custody chapter, how do we evaluate the significant events and moments, as well as the problematic ones? For those who did not participate in the chapter, what perception or feedback could they have gotten? What effect did I have within the various fraternities?\n\nQUESTION TWO\n\nAt the custody level we can reflect on these elements: =how do we live the relationship with the custody? What feeling of real belonging do we live and express? Do we feel like active members, who live responsibly, or passive members, who use the custody for their own projects? How do we evaluate our personal commitments in the life and activities of the custody? How is the quality of our communication with each other and with those in charge and service of authority? How do we use forums and social media? To what extent are they constructive and unifying instruments rather than a source of division? What real openness do we experience with respect to the national territory, starting from vocational animation? What are our expectations for the future of the custody? Are our current activities and commitments helping us achieve these goals? How do we live the relationship with the province, what are the expectations? What can and should we grow and improve on?\n\nQUESTION THREE\n\nAt the initial and ongoing formation level: how do we evaluate the initial formation path in the custody, what are the strong points and what are the weak ones? What evaluation do we give to ongoing formation? What opportunities can we avail ourselves of and what are the lacks?\n\nThe feedback from this workshop was a great help to the brothers to see what has been done, what needs to be improved and how to move on as a Custody.\n\nTUESDAY: 26 September 2023\n\nThe second day of the Assembly had as vision, to tackle the projects of the Custody and to bring out solutions to the uncompleted structures. Br. Wachamo Aklilu (from Ethiopia), working in the solidarity office in the Curia, being the first to intervene for the day, briefed the brothers on the following points.\n\nFirstly, he expressed his joy of being present in the custody, indicating it was his second time of coming to Cameroon since 2009 with the inauguration of the Cardiac Center. Then, he presented to the brothers the structure of the solidarity office. He further explained the difficulty of assisting the brothers of the Custody in their projects as a result of the financial crisis that undergoes the Curia.\n\nAfter his presentation, the brothers went into groups to continue reflecting on the life and projects of the custody through the following questions:\n\nAt the level of projects how do we evaluate the strong commitment sustained in the construction projects still underway? What sharing took place within the custody\n\nAt the ecclesial level we can ask ourselves: What participation do we experience in the events of the dioceses in which we are inserted? What is our contribution to the journey of the local church with our own charism? What is our involvement and our communion with the bishops, with the priests, with other men and women religious? How do we evaluate bishops’ relationships with our superiors?\n\nSharing general observations: joys, worries, fears, hopes etc.\n\nAfter the interventions from the brothers in response to the questions, Br Tobias then greeted the brothers, informing them of his departure for mission to America, precisely in the province of New Jersey.\n\nFrom his intervention, came closing remarks. The first closing remark from the Custos, Br. Kenneth, who said that what had provoked the Assembly was a mistake in the construction of giant structures in the custody; a mistake God has used to reunite us and to help us reunite our ideas for the good of our Custody. The Custos appreciated the Provincial Father for having a critical eye on him and on our custody. He concluded by thanking the Provincial for being always a father who leads the custody into the “promised land”.\n\nThe remarks of the Custos were then followed by those of the Provincial, who in the first place, thanked the brothers for making the Assembly a fruitful one through their frankness and sincerity. He acknowledged being hard on the brothers, yet underlined he has a responsibility before the province to respond to each member of the province. About the construction of the postulancy, he pleaded that each brother of the Custody sacrifices something in view of the structure. Lastly, he acknowledged the fact that the Custody needs to move towards autonomy, knowing there are modalities to be arrived at. Consequently, there is a need to start reflecting on such modalities.\n\nBr. Aklilu Petros, on his part, equally expressed his joy of meeting the brothers and sharing with them. He appreciated the hard work of the brothers, and encouraged all to keep striving always for the good of the custody, which one day, shall be raised to a Province.\n\nFinally, came the words of Br. Kilian, who articulated his satisfaction for the spirit of collaboration amongst the brothers, exhorting them to continue to strive for perfection, valuing each other as a gift. He added that brothers do away with their differences and learn better ways of handling them. This will then foster unity amongst the brothers and in the custody as a whole.\n\nWe thank God for having led us throughout this family gathering.\n\nPax et Bonum\n\nBr. Cedric Verbe Kohyen\n\nCustody Assembly in the Dominican Nunery – Bambui\n\nNo Comments\n\nMonday, the 25 September 2023, the Capuchin Brothers of the Custody of St. Francis of Assisi in Cameroon, in their numbers ( around 59), in the presence of the Curia (represented by Br. Kilian) and in the presence of the Provincial Minister (Br. Angelo) gathered for an assembly in the Domincan Nunery in Bambui. This assembly has as goal, reuniting all friars of the Custody, evaluating the life, projects and activities in and of the Custody, five months after the Custody Chapter. The fruits of the Chapter shall be published in the next hours.\n\nSilver Jubilee celebration\n\nNo Comments\n\n25 Years of Religious Life\n\nSilver Jubilee 2023\n\nAlready 25 years (07/09/1998-07/09/2023) since Brothers Vitalis T. Nyuysever, Donatus M. Wirkom, Francis B. Dor and Cyril Kerla vowed their Yes to God. This anniversary was hectically celebrated in Shisong Sacred Heart Parish (Kumbo Diocese), on Saturday 09-09-2023. It was a moment to thank God for his faithfulness and love; a celebration prepared for through a spiritual retreat in St. Mary of the Angels’ Fraternity Sop, preached by Fr. Andrew Ngah Solii (a priest from Kumbo Diocese). He invited the brothers to look back at the years past, and then, thank God for the 25 years of witnessing as friars. Furthermore, he indulged them to beg from God, forgiveness for the moments of poor witnessing. This would permit them to start afresh the life they had embraced, following the invitation of St. Francis to the friars as he neared death: “Let us begin again for until now we have done nothing.”\n\nBefore this great celebration, the Custos, Br. Kenneth Kinyuy, in his circular of August 30, 2023, had addressed the brothers saying: “Dear Brothers Vitalis, Donatus, Francis and Cyril, I humbly beckon you to strive and persevere in your Religious Franciscan-Capuchin vocation in such a way as to become a vivid response to God’s injunction in Leviticus, ‘The Jubilee will be a holy thing for you.’ (25:12). Holiness is the universal target we must never lose sight of. The jubilee is an opportunity to bring back to mind this reality.”\n\nDear Jubilarians (Brothers Vitalis, Donatus, Francis and Cyril), may God, through the intercession of St. Francis and St. Clare, through the maternal intercession of Mother Mary, continue to bless, guide and lead you in this noble and happy vocation.\n\nBayon s’occupe ses jeunes\n\nNo Comments\n\nBayon s’occupe ses jeunes\n\nEn vue d’occuper les enfants de Bayon durant cette période des vacances, la Paroisse Sainte Famille, sous la direction de son curé (fr. Felix Ayuvea) et son vicaire (fr. Valery Tukov), avec l’assistance des frères René, François et Nestor, a organisé un camp des jeunes dans lequel ont participé les jeunes de la Paroisse Sainte Famille de Bayon ainsi que les jeunes de Melon 2 (accompagné par le frère Nestor de la communauté des Frères de l’Emmanuel Melong 2). Ce camp des jeunes de Bayon avec les jeunes de Melon 2 a eu lieu à l’enceinte de l’école catholique de Bayon du 11 au 16 août. Ce camp s’est tenu sur le thème “ne vous laissez pas égarer par toutes sortes des doctrines étrangers”, avec un effectif de 70 participants. Les thèmes suivants ont enrichis le séjour des jeunes: Que personne ne méprise pas ta jeunesse (les défis actuels qui menace la vie des jeunes), les risques et les effets néfastes des pratiques sexuelles dans la vie des jeunes, les jeunes face aux défis de la société : la nécessité d’une bonne formation de la conscience morale, et, La Vierge Marie: modèle pour les jeunes. En plus des thèmes développés pour la formation ou la culture des jeunes, les activités spirituelles (messes quotidiennes, confessions, écoute, exposition sur la vie des saints…) et les activités récréatives (le sports, la soirée culturelle) ont meublées leur présence à Bayon.\n\nQue toute gloire soit rendue à Dieu Père, Fils, Esprit Saint; à notre Mère la Vierge Marie, nos saints patrons, nos anges gardiens, à toutes personnes de bonne volonté de nous avoir assisté tout au long de ce camp de jeunes à Bayon.\n\nles jeunes après la messe\n\nl’équipe organisatrice\n\nBrothers fetch water for the children\n\nla détente\n\nFishing for the Custody and for the Order\n\nNo Comments\n\nFishing Vocations for the Custody and for the Order\n\nThe first two weeks of July 2023 in Bafoussam Diocese, i.e., from the 5th – 9th of July and from the 12th – 16th of July 2023, were great moment of fishing vocations for the Custody and for the Order in Bafoussam Diocese. For Kumbo Diocese, this same experienced was made from the 25th – 30th of June 2023. These moments permitted the Franciscan Capuchin Charism to be sold to the young who gathered for various vocation camps.\n\nLa joie de la jeunesse\n\nMay the Holy Spirit, through the intercession of St. Francis and all Franciscan Saints, help the young, touched by the Franciscan charism, respond positively to God’s call into the Order.\n\nHoliday Program in Bambui: Hotcake for children\n\nNo Comments\n\nHoliday Program in Bambui: Hotcake for children\n\n“Let the children come to me, and do not prevent them; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” (Mt. 19:14)\n\nBambui Fraternity organises and hosts a special holiday program for children. This program under the chairmanship of the House Guardian of St. Francis of Assisi Fraternity Bambui, Br. Terence Sahven is aimed at helping kids in and around Bambui develop skills in variant domains of life such as reading and writing, computer elementary, playing of musical instruments such as the piano and the guitar, the fabrication of rosaries and bangles, and the production of liquid soap. Moreover, sports such as football, and other games form part of this holiday program for learning without playing makes Jack a dull boy. The various lessons are dispensed by the Capuchin students (Brs. Esope, Ignatius, Fabrice, Elvis, Augustine, Anicet, Keflet, Gideon, Immanuel) under the umbrella of brothers Terence, Jude, Martin and Aloysius.\n\nThis program which started on the 18th of July, and shall run till the 29th of August 2023 every Tuesday and Thursday from 8:00am to 12:00pm and every Sunday afternoon from 2:00pm to 5:00pm in the Capuchin friary Bambui, with free registration. The very first day of the session that took place on Tuesday, 18th of July 2023, recorded about a hundred and fifty-six children (156 children), ranging from the ages 5 to 19. This number is due to a great sensitisation by the friars, the desire of the parents to have their children occupied during this period in order keep them from idleness, in fact, to help them avoid being the devil’s “workshop” and above all, the desire of the children to learn and develop talents or treasures hidden in them.\n\nMaking of rosaries/bangles/liquid soap with Br. Anicet Reading and writing with Br. Augustine\n\nComputer lessons with Br. Gideon Piano classes with Br. Elvis\n\nGuitar classes with Br. Ignatius Sports/games with Brs.

Esope MOSSEU Thaddeus (OFM Cap)\n\nVows Refreshed\n\nNo Comments\n\nVows refreshed\n\nThe Constitutions of the Capuchin Lesser brothers, paragraph 23,4 states: “Formation in our Order is implemented in two phases: initial and ongoing. Initial formation includes intitiation into consecration according to our form of life, lasting until perpetual profession.”\n\nTherefore, brothers in initial formation after the novitiate experience, are bound to renew their vows of Poverty, Chastity and Obedience, following the formula approved by the Holy See for the Franciscan First Order and for the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis (cf. Constitution, par. 21).\n\nAs a result, brothers, who, in July 15, made their First Profession, are bound to renew those vows until the day they become perpetually professed or permanent member of the Order.\n\nBrothers listening to some admonitions\n\nThrough this renewal, a brother continues to examine his call into the Order and verifies if he can fully embrace and live the life as it ought to be lived.\n\nMay God continue to assist you with His Holy Spirit and through the intercession of Francis and all Franciscan Saints to remain steadfast to you call brothers.\n\nA Time to Cross-Over\n\nNo Comments\n\nA time to cross-over\n\nThere is a time for everything. A time to begin and a time to end. The Order celebrates his brothers who move-on to other stages of formation. Postulants making a step into the novitiate (July 14, 2023); and novices making a step out of the novitiate through their embrace or Temporary profession of the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience (July 15, 2023).\n\nPostulants getting set to cross-over into the novitiate\n\nThe reception of the probation habit\n\n*\n\nThe novices pronouncing their vows of poverty, chastity and obedience inorder to embrace the Capuchin life as Lesser Brothers\n\nBrothers Godlove, George and Sergius make their triumphal entery into the Order\n\nBrother George MBUYE, before crossing-over to a new stage of life as a friar in Temporal vows , makes a flashback to his dreams as he prepared to enter the novitiate as well as share his experiences in the novitiate.\n\nA POSTULANT’S DREAM FOR THE NOVITIATE\n\nEvery postulant’s dream at the end of the Postulancy is to put on the habit of probation. It is a sign of progression into the life from one stage to another stage but this is just the surface of what the Novitiate can impart on us and so there is need to go deep and have mature expectations or dreams for the Novitiate. To begin,\n\nI dream to be a Holy Friar; a good capuchin brother and to follow the path of St. Francis of Assisi. I hope during the 12 months, it will help mold and build me to be God’s best friend.\n\nSecondly, I expect to interiorize the Franciscan values, learn the capuchin way of praying and working which has given the Order and the Church many capuchin saints and blessed.\n\nTo go further, I hope I get to be a fraternal brother who can make his community livable and loving.\n\nAll in all, I expect to be initiated into the Franciscan Family, the capuchin brotherhood, so that I can be of value to the community and to the world. I pray to be a good example of Saint Francis, loving God and his creation always and everywhere.\n\nBrother George, at the end of his novitiate year, desires to share his novitiate experience. Have his novitiate dreams been realized? He tells us more?\n\nMY EXPERIENCE AS A NOVICE IN THE CAPUCHIN NOVITIATE FRATERNITY\n\nIn the first place experiences shape each and every one. God speaks through events, He daily communicates to all who seek his face on how particular assignment(s) should be carried for the benefit of Heaven and earth. John Main in his book “The Joy of Being” says “the church cannot effectively proclaim a past experience. It can only proclaim what it is actually experiencing. It can only proclaim what it is. Therefore, if the gap between what we believe and what we experience makes us inauthentic, our message can convince no one until it has so convinced us that we are transformed by it”. We vow to live obedience, chastity and poverty.\n\nIt is in this connection that one who is a novice and has embraced the depths of intense initiation into the truth that the capuchin spirituality and charism holds to it members, should make them all authentic in living fraternal life and observing the rule which is the gospel. In fact, fraternal life is built on prayer, manual work, recreations and visitation of the sick which helps me grow in total consciousness of the presence of God. This is to ascertain that life not based on prayer, a church that is not spiritually founded, a world that is not prayerfully sophisticated, cannot be a world, a church or life that is fully alive. Consequently, for me to be fully alive, as a novice, the foundation stone is prayer without which I am inauthentic in everything that a capuchin novice should be. Novitiate is a decisive stage in the capuchin life where one gets deep into his call to follow Christ in the footsteps of Saint Francis.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the novitiate helped me to make the longest journey of my life which is the journey of myself to my inner self. The gospel, that is, the good news I listened to at every Eucharistic celebration made me good and new as well as the journey to my inner world throughout this one year of experience made an authentic change of goodness and newness in my being. I underline this aspect because once in the novitiate, one is called to a spirit of the Holy Scripture where one doesn’t just read to digest its fundamentals but also to listen to Christ who speaks and instructs.\n\nIn a nutshell, my experience as a novice is the experience of myself which revealed to me the light that lies hidden within and the darkness of my very person which calls to total surrender of my being to the true identity of who a capuchin is and should always be.\n\nBy Mbuye George\n\nThe Novitiate Year draws to a close\n\nNo Comments\n\nIn few days from now, the novitiate year will end for some and begin for others. Infact, the Order of Friars Minor Capuchins in Cameroon, will soon put to birth three children in the persons of Br. Godlove Lendzemo, Br. George Mbuye and Br. Sergius Yovla through their temporary profession, marking an end to their novitiate/canonical year.\n\nMay St. Francis, St. Clare and other Franciscan Saints pray for you and for us all brothers.\n\nHappy Birthday to the Capuchin Order\n\nNo Comments\n\nJuly 3, 2023, the Order of the Friars Minor Capuchins celebrates their 495th anniversary of existence. It was in July 3, 1528 that, through the good offices of Catherine Cibo, Duchess of Camerino, the Capuchin reform was approved by Pope CIement VII in a brief Exponi nobis given at Viterbo and on the same day officially “sealed,” that is issued in the form of a bull beginning with the words: Religionis Zelus.\n\nTo mark this celebration, the Provincial Father of the Friars of Lombardia, Fra. Angelo Borghino addressed the sons of Francis in the following words:\n\nDear Brothers\n\nToday, July 3, marks the anniversary of the approval of the bull Religionis Zelus. This circumstance offers an opportunity to be reminded of that spirit of “reform” which characterized our beginnings and which continually challenges us as a proper dimension of our journey, both on a personal and fraternal level.\n\nWith this we are once again invited to refocus our lives in the following of Christ, obedient, poor and chaste, in order to take on his “form” more and more, through that path of conformation to Christ and to his sentiments towards the Father, which constitutes the ‘heart’ of our life of consecration.\n\nThe beauty of following Christ, according to that particular form to which in freedom we have been delivered, will become increasingly persuasive for us and a witness to those who meet us to the extent that the desire for conversion and change in our hearts remains alive and awake.\n\nThe anniversary of July 3 comes at the time when the Provincial Council meets again in view of the “List of Appointments and Transfers.” All this is part of that journey of continuous reform to which our very choice of life always leads us back and which, as provincial minister and council, we are called to accompany and support.\n\nMay the Immaculate Virgin, patroness of our Order, St. Francis, St. Clare and all our saints, especially Blessed Innocent of Berzo and Blessed Arsenio of Trigolo, accompany our renewed commitment to follow in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus Christ and to serve the Kingdom of God according to those circumstances and ways to which we will be called.\n\nFraternally\n\nBrother Angelo Borghino\n\nMinister Provincial\n\nThe Curia’s Formation Team in Cameroon\n\nNo Comments\n\nBr Jaime Rey, Secretary of formation from General Curia visits Cameroon.

Presently, this beautiful institution hosts over 150 students (both borders and day students) from different areas and different cultural backgrounds, giving a stupendous environment for both intellectual work and human/moral integration. In SAPCCCOL, students learn to accept, love and help one another.\n\nOn Sunday the 7th of may 2023, the Bishop of Kumbo, Mgr. George Nkuo, paid an august visit to this fabulously decked city of wisdom. This visit, after seven years since his last visit to the school, was an occasion for 46 of the students to receive the sacrament of confirmation in the presence of their fellow students, parents and teachers.\n\nThe Bishop was over-joyed by the ambiance created by the members of the entire SAPCCCOL family, and in his Homily, encouraged the students, as well as each and every Christian to be a true witness to the faith, and a valiant soldier of Christ. He affirmed time and again, that SAPCCCOL is a school like no other, and a place to be. He equally exhorted the parents to do well to send their children to Saint Anthony, and for those whose children are still out of home, to bring them back home, where education is not only qualitative, but equally affordable and accompanied by moral upbringing. Let us all join hands to give a good name to Kumbo.\n\nNo one present at this event, could succeed to hide the joy that enveloped the atmosphere. Parents, teachers, students and invitees were all thrilled by the beauty of the event.\n\nStudents welcome the Chief Shepherd\n\nThe Bishop with the entire christian community of Mbohtong present at his august visit\n\nStudents enjoying their beautiful campus\n\nBr.

This is due to the fact that almost every Cameroonian friar, leaving in or out of the Cameroonian territory, made it for this beautiful Family time. Within this period of the Chapter, a series of reports were presented such as: The Triennal report of the Custos, Br. Kenneth Kinyuy, a report on the state of finances in the Custody from Br. Aloysius Ngonbi, a presentation on Economy and Custody life: a determinant of fraternal relations by Br. Author Nga and Br. Aloysius Ngongbi, a presentation on the Ratio Formationis of the Order by Br. Kilian Ngitir (General Councilor for Formation in the Order), and a report on the situation of the Custody’s websites (www.emmausoutreach.org / www.ofmcapcameroon.org) by Br. Cedric Verbe. These reports gave to all friars a general view of what the Custos, Br. Kenneth Kinyuy and his Councilors (Br. Peter Ghani, Br. Author Nga, Br. Aloysius Ngonbi, Br. Martin Dikwa) had realized within their 3-year mandate of shepherding.\n\nHaving gone through these reports, there was need to elect the new shepherds of the custody, which took place on Friday 21st April from 9 am to about 11:25 am. The following brothers accepted to serve their brothers in the Custody of St. Francis of Assisi in Cameroon for three years:\n\nCustos: Br. Kenneth Kinyuy\n\n1st Councilor: Br. Peter Ghani\n\n2nd Councilor: Br. Aloysius Ngongbi\n\n3rd Councilor: Br. Cyril Kerla\n\n4th Councilor: Br. Derick Ajende Ajende\n\nMay they be led by the Holy Spirit in this holy mission to the brothers.\n\nBefore the official close of the Chapter, there was a need to listen to experiences from brothers in Collaboration: Br. Mark Ndifor and Br. Siver Kibuh (from Kenya), Br. Tobias Wirmum and Br. Mbuh Bertrand (from Gabon), Br. Frederick Bohtila Njumferghai (from Zambia), Br. Calvin Nshalai and Br. André Litika (From Equatorial Guinea), Br. Br. Kilian Ngitir, Br. Joseph Dufe, Br. Peter Tar, Br. Valentine Fuhnui, and Br. Nji Noël (from Italy). Closing remarks were then given by Br. Angelo Borghino, the Father Provincial, who in persona, had presided over the Chapter. All ended with a mass of thanksgiving on Saturday 22nd April 2023, after which all friars departed to their various fraternities.\n\nThe\n\nFinally in Melong II, living the Chapter Experience\n\nNo Comments\n\nFinally in Melong II to live the Chapter experience\n\nTuesday 18th April 2023, the Capuchin Friars of the Custody of St. Francis of Assisi in Cameroon (those resident in the country and those coming in from other mission territories such as Italy, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Zambia) started arriving Melong II (the Retreat Center of the Emmanuel Brothers) for a 3 days study and evaluation of the Custody’s affaires within which, new shepherds will be chosen to watch over the friars of the Custody for a period of 3 years. This is a joyful moment, a time of meeting to share with one another. The Custos, Br. Kenneth Kinyuy welcoming all the brothers, did acknowledge the fatherly presence of the Provincial, Br. Angelo Borghino, the Custos for Tchad / Central Africa, Br. Martial, and the presence of the 13 friars, participating for the very first time at this Custody’s Chapter.\n\nIn fact, how beautiful it is when brothers meet each other.\n\nBrothers in a fraternal moment\n\nThe hall, well disposed for work\n\nHow beautiful it is meeting each other.

At this chapter, 13 brothers will be making their entry for the First Time (Brs. Anthony, Junior, Valerie, Gerald, François, Thaddeus, Philip, Ignatius, Rene, Elvis, Michel, Gotran, Fabrice). May the Holy Spirit accompany all the friars before, during and after this family gathering.\n\nHymn for 40yearsexc\n\nThe custody’s Elective Chapter fast approaches (18 April – 22 April 2023). Brothers are approaching already the Chapter’s residence: Emmanuel Brothers’ Retreat Center Melong II. May the Holy Spirit lead us safely into this holy ground, accompany us throughout our deliberations and empower us in the mission to be carried out after the Chapter. May St. Francis of Assisi and the college of Franciscans in heaven, intercede for us.\n\nAspirants of the Ruby Jubilee\n\nNo Comments\n\nFra Christopher Shiyghan, coordinator for Aspirancy, encounters Capuchin Aspirants from different regions of the country.\n\nHis first encounter took place in the Our Lady of Angel’s Novitiate House Sop (Kumbo Diocese) from the 27th to the 29th December 2022 with six (6) aspirants, all from Kumbo. This encounter was enriched with talks such as: Vocation in the Bible, presented to the young aspirants by Br. Peter Ghani. Then, the second talk was on Vocational Discernment, presented by Br. Christopher Shiyghan. This period of encounter permitted the young and vibrant aspirants to have a taste of the life of the Capuchin Friars Minor in Cameroon through their actuosa participatio in fraternal activities: Prayers, Work, Meals and fraternal recreation.\n\nFra Christopher, according to the call to proximity, proceeded with his august visit to the aspirants from Bafoussam, Bayon, and Buea. This encounter took place from Friday 17th – Sunday 19th of March 2023, in the fraternity of Balengou, under the guardianship of Fra. Emil Nyuyki. These aspirants, seven in number, that is, 3 from Bafoussam, 1 from Bayon, and 3 from Buea, equally enjoyed some fraternal moments with the brothers: prayers, meals, work and individual sharing with Fra. Christopher. They were drilled on the topic: Vocational Discernment, a topic geared at helping them make informed choices for their future, choices that would enhance their lasting happiness.\n\nHis last proximate encounter (still to be announced) will be in Bambui, with all aspirants of the Capuchins in and around Bamenda.\n\nSunday Reflections with Fr. Dufe Joseph\n\nNo Comments\n\n2 Sam. 7:4-5, 12-14, 16; Rom. 4:13, 16-18, 22; Matt. 1:16, 18-21, 24\n\nSolemnity of St. Joseph, Husband of the BVM\n\nFr. Dufe Joseph OFM Cap.\n\nThis year the Church has shifted the celebration of the Solemnity of St. Joseph from 19 March to this Monday so as not to interrupt the Sunday liturgy and thus preserve the Lenten journey that we have been observing. The father figure of Joseph keeps coming to mind at an era where the same figure in our society is being put into question, especially by some modern medical technological measures whereby a lady can just walk into the hospital and ask to me made pregnant through seminal injection, with sperm gotten from someone whom they do not care to know, and whom the child will never know. Furthermore, Joseph stands as a figure of defence in the same society which offers death of woman and/or child as the solution to what has commonly become known as “unwanted pregnancies”. In the first case, no one cares to know the father of the child. In the second case, the father is known but his identity is hidden, so the elimination of the child becomes the immediate solution.\n\nA journey through the bible tells us that not so much is said about this man, Joseph. In fact the gospel of Mark has just no mention of his name at all. John mentions the name only 2 times, and in doubtful negative situations: “Philip found Nathanael and said to him, ‘We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and the prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth’” (John 1:45-46). This means that Joseph cannot have such a son. In the second instance they are actually admitting that Jesus is the son of Joseph but doubting the son’s divine nature. The Jews “were saying, ‘Surely this is Jesus son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know” John 6:41-42. On the other hand Matthew mentions Joseph’s name 7 times and Luke 5 times. Even as such, none of them gives any details. There is no mention of his place and date of birth, and worst of all, he is not said to have ever mentioned a word – one retreat mistress has said that “Jesus” is the only word of Joseph.\n\nThe members of the great association known as the Catholic Men’s Association (CMA) great each other thus: “St. Joseph, man of honour, pray for us”. This greeting is drawn from the Gospel text of today, which is one of the references of Matthew. There are 6 qualities that make Joseph a man of honour, and which we are invited to imitate: 1) Sparing other people’s publicity. There is a strong tendency in us to rejoice at talking about the faults of others thus exposing their faults to the world; 2) Listening to God: many of us find it difficult to obey God in the face of social pressure such as the one that Joseph found himself in; 3) Obedience: after listening to the word of God, the big challenge is to put it to practice; 4) Putting the word of God in practice: Joseph dutifully gave the name that the angel instructed when finally the child was born; 5) Responsible Parenthood: Joseph remained close to his wife and child, especially during the flight to Egypt and when Jesus got missing in the temple. Many men feel that fatherhood ends at reproduction; 6) Silent Listening: so many of us talk so much that we find it hard to listen to our interlocutor, especially when we have taken a few cups of alcohol. Talking too much cheapens the value of words because in the end, supply is always more than demand.\n\nThese qualities, and more, made Joseph to stand out as a shining example of an honourable man. Yes, honour is earned and not bought nor inherited; this happens when we live a virtuous life. As man of honour, Joseph was a man of virtue; he put together all the theological and cardinal virtues and lived them: he loved, lived in faith and hoped; he was prudent, just, temperate and courageous, and went just for what matters, the details. The name Joseph means “God adds”. Through his cooperation with the divine plan, God added another person into humanity, the person who was to change the history of the world. A man wrote a book and gave the title: “How to change your wife in 30 days”. By the end of one week he had sold 2 million copies. He later on discovered that he had made an error. He decided to correct the title: “How to change your life in 30 days”. For the next one month he sold only 3 copies. When it comes to changing other people’s life we are experts. But when it comes to changing ours it becomes a problem. Joseph would have loved to change the life of his wife, were he in our shoes, but he rather changed his own life and his plans to suit that of God, and took Mary into his home. This is a great act, it is his own “Yes” which perfectly married the great “Yes” of his wife, and which changed the course of history. Each and everyone of us can change others, we can change the whole world, but only if we each change our lives. Let us pray, on this solemnity of St Joseph, that God may give us a little of the spirit of Joseph, this great man of honour.\n\n4th Sunday of Lent Year A\n\n1 Sam. 16:1-13; Eph. 5:8-14; John 9:1-41\n\nFr. Dufe Joseph OFM Cap.\n\nGod does not see as man sees; man looks at appearances but the Lord looks at the heart. What a challenge to us! This is the message from the first reading, which leads to the anointing of David as the king of the people of Israel. This message makes us appreciate the reason why Jesus did not allow himself to be defeated by the tricky question of the disciples concerning the blind man – as to who sinned in order to have provoked blindness in him. Even after being cured, the controversy did not stop. There were doubts right from his own neighbours as to whether this was the same man who was blind or this was another person. People had believed that since he was born blind he was destined to live and die blind – a kind of compartmentalisation that most of us are guilty of. This is how man thinks, yes, and not how God thinks. In fact, the controversy even included Jesus, as to whether he could be from God or was he some kind of sinner, infringing on the Sabbath – this was the confusion among the Pharisees to whom the cured man was taken.\n\nIn a way, the Liturgy of the Church, on this Fourth Sunday of Lent, known as the Laetare Sunday (Joyful Sunday) invites us to retrace one of the fundamental dynamics of our baptismal rebirth, which is the passage from the darkness of sin and error into the light of God, which is the Risen Christ. This is the experience of man who suddenly finds himself cured of his blindness. Already in the Old Testament Revelation, as seen in the anointing of David, the Lord God had shown the People of Israel how much the Creator’s judgment was deeper and truer than the thoughts of the creature. The Lord had thus indicated what the only true criterion for judging a man was, and where man could meet God’s gaze and enter into relationship with him. This place is the heart. By “heart,” of course, the Bible does not mean the center of the innermost drives or the organ that regulates blood flow in the organism-man, but man’s “sacrarium,” his conscience, where he is given the possibility to listen to the very voice of God and recognize it, and so produce the effects of the light which are complete goodness and right living and truth – no matter what others think.\n\nHowever, unable to remain faithful to what is truest in him, man reverts back to his own petty criteria, producing every wickedness, injustice and falsehood, in order to govern himself, obtaining what, from time to time, he decides to be his good, and hoping to become thus “like God”. God, however, does not give up. He comes to each of us in the twofold way narrated by the Gospel. First, he does so through sacramental signs just as in the ritual performed by Jesus on the blind man. He cleanses us and then places us on the second pedestal, which is that of mission. Siloam is a pool which name means “sent”. We are not sent until we have been made clean. The cleansing process is a very difficult process, but we must go through it if we are to be who we are called to be, not blind people but people of light. Christ, sent by the Father, takes upon himself all our sins, even to the ultimate consequences of our blindness, right to the point of allowing himself to be stripped naked, crowned with thorns and nailed to a cross, rejected by his own people and abandoned by his closest friends. This unheard-of love of Christ can only definitively, in time, overcome all fear of our limitations, for there is nothing about us that can prevent him from loving us.\n\nMay it not surprise us that suffering humanity and suffering individual human beings could sometimes become objects of human experimentation. Did the disciples not use the blind man as their specimen for the determination of sinfulness! “Who sinned”, they asked. And did the neighbours of the man not use him as a specimen of identity and finally take him to the experts of human degradation, the blind Pharisees! “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?” they wondered. And did the Pharisees themselves not use Jesus as the specimen for their religious hypocrisy! “This man cannot be from God: he does not keep the Sabbath… How could a sinner produce signs like this”! And only the man who had benefitted from the healing could tell his personal story, even if he was to know the complete version only a short while later.\n\nWe are always on the way, but sure that one day we will reach. This is the virtue of hope. Even until now, like the man whose eyes were opened, we may not claim to have known Jesus fully; at least we do have some knowledge of him, based on what he has done for us, and this makes us bond to him. It is precisely this indestructible bond, based on his love and faithfulness to us that encourages us to seek to know him the more. Let us ask, through Mary Most Holy, the grace to be faithful to the truth, to the facts of our lives, grasping the hand that, in every circumstance, Christ extends to us; let us, thus, be shaken out of the torpor or inertia that always undermines us, in order to live totally by Christ, the crucified and risen Love, in this life and in eternity.\n\nExplore the talents of Capuchin Friars in Cameroon\n\nNo Comments\n\nFra Joseph N. Dufe, in one of his most recent compositions, honours our Mother Mary with a beautiful Magnificat in the “NSO” dialect called “Lamnso”.\n\nFra Fredrick Njumferghai Bohtila, a writer, in one of his opuses, gives the world ways to work towards perfection.\n\nWhere can one find true and lasting happiness? Where can one get true peace?\n\nFra Fredrick Njumferghai Bohtila invites you to read on and find it out for yourself\n\nThe rise in suicide cases and mental challenges stem from a lack of self-acceptance and the nature of human beings to search for happiness in the wrong places, a Cameroonian Catholic Priest has said.\n\nFr. Fredrick Njumferghai Bohtila says that the more the world develops technologically with people amassing more material wealth, the more they continue to search for happiness which they hardly ever find. When this happens, individuals find life meaningless, the Priest says.\n\n“Suicide cases are on the rise all over the world because people are not happy. Many feel deceived even in relationships. This is because they are questing for joy in wrong places and never find it,” Fr. Bohtila told ACI Africa in an interview Monday, June 14.\n\nThe Franciscan Friar of the Capuchin Priest who is based in Zambia has authored a book, “The Spiritual Perfection of the Human Being” which he says is an invitation to find happiness from within.\n\nThe book draws teachings from St. Augustine of Hippo’s book, Confessions, which bears one of the Saint’s most popular invocations, “You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.”\n\nAccording to Fr. Bohtila, St. Augustine of Hippo is the model for people looking for internal peace, those who wish to know about themselves and to realize that they were created in the image of God who makes their joy complete.\n\n“A human being today is always out of himself, is always distracted,” the 45-year-old Cameroonian Priest tells ACI Africa ahead of his book launch slated for June 22.\n\nHe adds, “Most of the time we are absent minded. We are far, we are pulled by the fascinating world around us and we don’t have that self-acceptance.”\n\nThe 100-page book published by the Pauline Publications Africa is divided into three chapters. In the first chapter, the Priest talks about the human being created in the image of God as a call to perfection.\n\n“The perfection we are talking about is coming back to ourselves and discovering who we are,” Fr. Bohtila says, and adds, “Human beings have ventured far and even travelled to the moon. But we believe that the most important journey for a man is when he goes back to himself and realizes who he really is. Only then do we discover the greatness of our mind and the greatness of God in us.”\n\n“Through travelling back to ourselves, we come to discover that the God or the greatness we are searching for is still within us,” the Priest says.\n\nThe second chapter addresses the consequences of sin and goes back to the fall of Adam and Even. The Capuchin Priest says that the two who wanted to be like God provide lessons for the society today where not many people are satisfied with who they are.\n\n“Adam and Eve wanted to rejoice in a power that was greater than their own. They wanted to become like God. A creature cannot take the place of God,” the Priest says, adding that the conduct of Adam and Eve is “a fundamental problem today.”\n\n“Most of the time, the human being doesn’t accept himself the way he is. We want to become someone else. And that’s where our sadness begins,” he says.\n\nHe further says that his book is aimed at helping people to arrive at self-acceptance, and to know their rightful place in creation so as to live fulfilled lives.\n\nThe book also addresses the issue of the divided will and the challenges that people encounter as they make life choices. This, according to the Cameroonian Priest, is the struggle that St. Augustine experienced when he talks about being “divided in himself.”\n\nFr. Bohtila says that many times, people are divided and that in making choices, many are “prompted by egoistic motives and distorted emotions.”\n\n“We have distorted desires. And so that one blurs our reasoning faculty and our intellectual faculty,” he says, and adds, “We need to be clear in our rationality, in what we are choosing. But now because we are moved by emotions, passions, sometimes our choices are wrong. And those wrong choices don’t help us to grow.”\n\nIn the third chapter, the Priest author talks about the healing power of the grace of God. It is this power that St. Augustine of Hippo discovers when he realizes that “he has been moving out of himself and leaving all the good inside.”\n\nFr. Bohtila says that the world, especially today, needs the message of St. Augustine of Hippo who is honored as a great doctor of the Church.\n\nThe Saint is described as one of the Latin Fathers of the Church “and perhaps the most significant Christian thinker after St. Paul.”\n\nThe contribution of St. Augustine of Hippo to Christian teaching has been said to have created a theological system of great power and lasting influence.\n\nHis numerous written works, the most important of which are Confessions and The City of God are said to have helped lay the foundation for much of medieval and modern Christian thought.\n\nFr. Bohtila says that he has always looked up to St. Augustine of Hippo and started writing the book that is pegged on the Saint while he undertook his research in Rome.\n\n“I think that the human heart today, despite all the things that we possess even in the advancement of material things in technology, that human being keeps searching for happiness somewhere,” the Priest says.\n\nHe adds, “The more we possess things, the more we want more things, which means that the human heart is not satisfied by the things we possess. This is what St. Augustine implies when he says that our hearts will remain restless, until they come to rest in God.”\n\nFr. Bohtila says that the fundamental relationship stressed upon in the book is to come back to oneself and to realize that the true meaning of life is found within.\n\nShisong Fraternity joyfully welcomes Fra.

The joy flowing from his visit to the fraternity inspired the House Guardian of the Sacred Heart fraternity Shisong, Br. Felix Afoni to say: “To have a provincial bursar amongst us is something very important”. His visit, as a consequence, has permitted him to see the reality of our suffering people, to encounter brothers in their reality and to evaluate some projects undertaken by the Custody to mark their 40 years of presence in the Cameroonian soil.\n\nMay God in his goodness, grace his presence amongst us.\n\nPax et Bonum\n\nLerone-Alex Bole Nfonba, we love you\n\nNo Comments\n\nLerone-Alex Bole Nfonba, we love you\n\nLerone-Alex Bole Nfonba, Feb. 26, 2023 made you 6 years of age in the heavens above (Feb. 26, 2017 – Feb. 26, 2023).

GiamPaolo Beghi, the Provincial Bursar, on how collaboration between the Guardians and Bursars be enhanced for a smooth running of the Custody especially with regards to the administration of custody goods.\n\nIt should be noted that the first economic visit to Cameroon of the Provincial Bursar was done in 2015, and the second in 2023. The Provincial Bursar exposed to the brother Guardians and Bursars that being guardians and bursars is a service rendered to the brothers, to the fraternity, to the Custody, to the Order and to the Church, a service by which a brother proves his own witness to the Gospel life. As a matter of fact, the Provincial Bursar did highlight the fact of collaboration between the Guardians and Bursars, where he stipulated that when tension arises between these two services, the fraternity enters into a crisis. Moreover, he indicated that the Guardians and Bursars help their fraternities renew the spirit of poverty, evaluate their variant means of transportation which at times weigh on the fraternity, encourage brothers to work in order to sustain life in the fraternity, to be joyful in living their life of austerity, return to the community the fruits of their apostolates, trust in divine providence, and to avoid financial and material waste. And for a fraternity to run well, it was stressed that fraternal budgets be drawn and evaluated by its members. Above all, that brothers in spending what they have, should always think too of the future. From here, he encouraged that brothers be genuine, truthful and faithful in the accounts they render, for this contribute in making a healthy fraternity. It was equally noted that some brothers may use fraternal goods like cars to render fraternal services and the fruits from those services never reach the fraternity; things to watch against for they murder the fraternity. Furthermore, it was spelt out that it is the role of Guardians to ensure the administration of fraternal goods (i.e., our structures…). And to the Bursars, their need to keep a day book, have a balance sheet which help to project their honesty and transparency. The Provincial Bursar, rounding up his presentation, proposed that the Bursars in the custody from time to time, take up formative courses to help them improve in their running of financial matters in the custody.\n\nThis encounter with Guardians and Bursars ended up with these last words from the Provincial Bursar at about 4:45PM: that as the Custody helps or supports the different fraternities of the custody, so too, different fraternities of the custody should take as task to help, defend and support the custody.\n\nWe thank the Provincial Bursar for all the sharing and the Province of Lombardy in general for all they have been and remain for our beloved custody of St. Francis of Assisi. May our Good and Loving God continue to watch over us as we prepare our hearts for the upcoming elective chapter.\n\nPax et Bonum\n\nNécrologie: A nous revoir frère François Tabe Akono\n\nNo Comments\n\nFrère François Tabe Akono, Ministre Régional OFS francophones, conduit vers sa demeure.\n\nLa famille (OFS) Ordre Franciscains Séculier du Cameroun, conduit leur frère François Tabe Akono, Ministre Régional OFS francophones, à sa demeure.

These brothers make their experience of the life in the fraternities of Sop, Mbohtong and Bayong.\n\nPrimordially, their second encounter of formation had as objective: To lead the brothers into a living relationship with Christ, to be more conformed to Him and to find their identity in Him (Const. No 32, 3). This explains why the formative session was animated by different presentations and discussions on topics inspired from the reality of religious life in today’s society. It was equally an opportunity of a “one-to-one” encounter with the Br. Martin Dikwa, the coordinator of the fourth year Post-Novices. What was on the menu for these six young men?\n\nOn Monday 13th February, discussions were on human formation; friendship with persons of the opposite sex and the use of the mass media, a formative subjet matter of our time, presented to them by Br. Divine Etimbi.\n\nOn Tuesday 14th February discussions were centered on the VIII Plenary Council of the Order: On the grace of working, handled by Br. Martin Dikwa. It was noted summarily that work is grace because it puts us in contact with ourselves, with brothers, with people, with creation, and most importantly with the creator (God).\n\nOn the third day of the session, that is on Wednesday 15th February, the session was on the Capuchin apostolate with Br. Amos Bamenjoh as the resource person.\n\nThe presentation of the document: The gift of fidelity, the joy of perseverance of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life was the object of Thursday, 16th February. Issues treated from this document included: Gazing and listening, Enkindling awareness and separation from the Institute and Juridical norms.\n\nOn Friday, 17th February, the last day of the second session, we were graced with the presence and intervention of Br. Aloysius Ngongbi, who drilled us on: Christ in the Franciscan experience.\n\nHaving been nourished throughout the week with such enriching teachings, brothers, on Saturday, 18th February, returned to their fraternities to make visible in their lives what they had digested within the formative week in Bambui.\n\nMay the Holy Spirit continue to enlighten you all brothers in this process of discernment.\n\nIn memory of Father Magic\n\nNo Comments\n\nToday, February 15, 2023, marks the 5th anniversary of departure of Fra.
