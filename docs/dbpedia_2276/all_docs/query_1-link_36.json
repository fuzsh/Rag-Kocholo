THE CATHOLIC CHARISMATIC\n\nRENEWAL PRAYER GROUP\n\nThe Catholic Charismatic Renewal Prayer Group started fully in St Jude’s Parish, Fundong, in 2001. This was done through the leadership of Mr Antoine Nyamsi, the Chief of Post for Public Security, Fundong. He led the group to a good level and extended branches to Njinikom and Fuli-Kom Parishes.\n\nThis group gained membership in the Parish and is struggling to form branches in other Mission Stations of the Parish.

They hold Zonal and Parish meetings and take part in Deanery and Diocesan meetings.\n\nGod, live it and spread it to all the parts\n\nParish. 6. Some Christians have styles the group as a Sect, out of ignorance and are reluctant to join it.\n\n9. THE BLUE ARMY\n\nThe Blue Army was formed in St Jude’s Parish, Fundong, in 1993 with Mrs Shuri Bernadette as the first Parochial President, Cyprian Ta-ah as Secretary and Mrs Timbong Mary as Treasurer. The group has branches in some Mission Stations but their activities are timidly carried out due to the Anglophone crisis, sickness and ageing of some pioneer members of the Parish. Youth are reluctant to join this group, thus causing membership to remain still or even reduced.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. To pray the Rosary daily. 2. To wear the brown scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. 3. To make sacrifices for the conversion of sinners by visiting and praying with them. 4. The members attend night vigils every first Friday of the month but the\n\nAnglophone crisis has come as a hindrance for most members. Their meeting days were changed from\n\nMonday to Friday evening before the disturbing Anglophone crisis. That has weakened the members and even caused the displacement of some prominent members.\n\n10. THE ALTAR SERVERS, ST STEPHEN’S\n\nGUILD\n\nThe Altar Servers or St Stephen’s Guild functioned in the Parish with the general name “Mass Boys” but in 2004 when young ladies were allowed to join the group, the name Altar Servers came in. The Altar Servers have as main duty to assist the Priest at Mass. They hold their training sessions on Saturdays and also hold their Zonal and Parish meetings. They attend Deanery and Diocesan meetings. They do corporal works of mercy and celebrate St Stephen’s feast day.\n\nAims\n\n1. To assist the Priest at Mass. 2. To attend Mass daily 3. To lead and live good spiritual lives with a view to becoming a priest or religious. 4. To foster the formation of Altar Servers in the Mission Stations. 5.

Some of the Altar Servers are undergoing formation to become Priests, Brothers and\n\nReverend Sisters etc in St Jude’s Parish,\n\nFundong.\n\n11. THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN\n\nWORKERS, YCW\n\nThe Young Christian Workers was founded by Fr Cardijn, a Belgian Priest, on the 18 April 1925. This action group came to Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province in1967 through the effort of Fr John Kockman, the then Parish Priest of Fiango, with the financial help of Fr Erwin Hain, a German Priest.\n\nWhen St Jude’s Parish was created in November 1971, the Young Christian Workers was the first action group Fr Joseph Holzkneht chose to be working with, though their activities were timidly carried out. They became fully active with the holding of Parish meetings during the period when Fr John Musi, Fr Cletus Tita and Fr John Bintum became Parish Priests. The Y.C.W become active in all the 19 Mission Stations of St Jude’s Parish, Fundong,\n\nMotto: See, Judge and Act\n\nSlogan: “In Christ, there is fellowship”\n\nTheir Parish President is Delbert Yong from Fundong Up, Secretary; Ngoh Lizette from Fundong Town and the Coordinator is Mbeng Pascal from Fundong Town.\n\nThe Y.C.W in St Jude’s Parish, Fundong, holds Parish and Zonal meetings as well as attend Deanery and Diocesan meetings. The membership is very poor in some Mission Stations. The members participate in parish activities such as participating in the Annual Harvest thanksgiving, singing in church, cleaning the church, visiting the sick and the\n\nAim\n\n1.

THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN STUDENTS,\n\nY.C.S.\n\nThe Young Christian Students is an action group that is timidly functioning in St Jude’s Parish, Fundong. This group was formed when Fr Michael Yuh was the Parish Priest in Fundong Parish. The group is found mostly in Boyui, Mbam, Fujua, Meli and Fundong Town. Not much is known about the group in Fundong Parish because of no archives about it from the Parish office or even from their old members who are already workers today.\n\nMotto: See, Judge and Act\n\nAim:\n\n1. The main aim of the group is to assist young students to have a holistic educational journey in the parish. The members hold meetings and participate in singing during Mass and cleaning the church. They visit the sick and the needy.\n\n2. The main difficulty is that most of the activities are not going on in the Parish because of most students have been displaced by the Anglophone crisis especially the executive members. It is hoped that those around should join the group for a new and firm beginning.\n\nSt Gerald, Mbissi\n\nSt Paul, Mentang St Mathias, Bamingwah\n\nQueen of Peace, Mbam\n\nSt John Bosco, Abuh Sacred Heart, Fujua\n\nSt Gregory, (foundation), Ibali-Meli St St Thomas Aquinas, Aboh\n\nSt Jude, Fundong Town St James, Meli\n\nTemporal structure of St Veronica,\n\nSt Dominic, Ntehgum\n\nSt Michael, Muteff St Francis de Sale, Atondum\n\nSt Raphael, Fundong Up\n\nQueen of Apostles, Ameng\n\n1.

The C.W.A. and the Y.C.W were formed in his time. The Y.C.W is the first action group he chose to work with which at the time had very active young men.\n\nHe enjoyed swimming in the pool called “Chimni” in Juafeff and that made people believe very strongly that he had mysterious powers. Fr John Bintum describes him as “a quiet, saintly priest.”\n\nHe left for Bafmeng Parish in 1982and was later sent to Brixen, Italy, where he took care of retired Mill Hill Missionaries. He passed away on 29 July 2011.\n\n2.

He always involved Fon Jinabo II to accompany Archbishop Paul Verdzekov on his pastoral visits to the Bum area and facilitated the work of evangelization in that Sub Parish. It is very interesting that the Fon Clement Ndzi was then the Fon’s Private Secretary at the time.\n\nFr Bintum ensured that the Billings Method of Natural Family Planning was introduced\n\nin the Parish when tow parishioners, Mr Leo Nyongo and wife, Mrs Perpetua Nyongo were sent to Kenya to specialize in the programme. The parish was first in the Diocese in couple-participation.\n\nHe successfully carried out ecumenical Moral Instructions in all the schools in the parish in collaboration with Mr Waingeh Albert Ndim, who was the pioneer Principal of G.S.S. Fundong, who had the courage to put up such a programme in favour of the Catholic Church which led to the number of vocations to the priesthood from GSS/GHS Fundong at the time.\n\nHe introduced the celebration of the Parish feast day that brought together all the parishioners which always started with a Thanksgiving Masses during which the Fon was always present followed by choral music competitions, sporting activities and traditional dances by the Christians and school children.\n\nHe sourced for funds for the construction of the Parish hall.

The Cadets, Mass Servers, Vocation Groups converged monthly in a given Mission Station for a two day parochial Christian formation meeting, pray and discuss issues challenging them.\n\nThe present cemetery, which was occupied by Bobe Ngong, the mentally deranged man\n\nwho used to reside in the place, was blessed and he was the first to be buried there.\n\nHe initiated the fitting of the metallic door shutters of the parish house, after the attack by armed robbers one Saturday in 1993, with the financial assistance of his Dutch friends Mr and Mrs Ton Margaret Kerssens.\n\nHe brought the first computer to Fundong Parish with the Help of Dr Paul Nchoji Nkwi and he did not only use it for evangelization work but he also used it to teach others.\n\nDuring his ministry the Mboh-Ilung disagreement was destabilizing that area and he went as far as he could in an effort to solve the problem.\n\nHe celebrated the 10th anniversary of his o r d i n a t i o n i n F u n d o n g a n d w a s overwhelmed with joy at the massive turnout of Christians and the festive atmosphere.

He introduced Quarter Masses in Fundong Town.\n\nThe Bona Mors Prayer Group was formed during his ministry and the YCS became prominent.
