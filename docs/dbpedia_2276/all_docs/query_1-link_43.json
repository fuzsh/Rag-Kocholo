Sources close to Mgr Kofon confirmed his passing away in the early hours of Thursday, March 28, 2024 at the Bamenda Regional Hospital, which coincided with Holy Thursday, a significant day in the Christian calendar.\n\nRoman Catholics believe the priesthood was instituted on Holy Thursday during the last super Jesus Christ shared with his Disciples.\n\nMgr Engelbert Kofon had been living in retirement at All Saints Parish Bayelle prior to his passing.\n\nThroughout his years of service, he had held important roles within the Archdiocese, including that of Rector of the Saint Thomas Aquinas Major Seminary and Vicar General of the Archdiocese; a close collaborator of the then Archbishops Paul Verdzekov and Cornelius Esua.\n\nThe news of Mgr Kofon's death has deeply saddened the community of the Archdiocese of Bamenda, with many remembering his dedication to his faith and his tireless service to the Church.\n\nFuneral arrangements are currently being made to honor and remember the life of this esteemed priest who hails from Noni in Bui Division of the North West Region.\n\nUpdates\n\nThe Archbishop of Bamenda His Grace Andrew Nkea Fuanya has confirmed the dead of the Msgr Engelbert Kofon. The confirmation is contained in a letter The Hilltop Mail has received a copy signed by the Chancellor of the Archdiocese Rev Fr Derek Che."
