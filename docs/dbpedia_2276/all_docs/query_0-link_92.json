        "text": "Richard Phillips Feynman (pronounced /ˈfaɪnmən/ FYEN-mən; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model). For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world.\n\nHe assisted in the development of the atomic bomb and was a member of the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing,[2] and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.[3] He held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nFeynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, notably a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom and The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books (Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think?) and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust!\n\nHe was regarded as an eccentric and free spirit. He studied Maya hieroglyphs, was a prankster, juggler, safecracker, bongo player, and a proud amateur painter.\n\nFull Article:\n\nhttp://www.genarians.org\n\nhttp://www.derbydeadpool.co.uk/\n\nhttp://deathlist.net/\n\n====\n\nThey're pretty gruesome websites. But on the other hand, they're interesting ways to see people obsessively collect articles about the health conditions/hospital visits of famous people. Basically, you predict 20 people who might die in the next year, and you score points for every person who dies (the younger the person, the more points you score).\n\nIt's not really scientific, but it's still an interesting way to develop intuition about what factors ultimately cause someone's death. I've been following these sites for around half a decade now.\n\n==\n\nAlso, google the author \"canadian paul\". he does A LOT of research, including research into nonagenarians who are still living (but who aren't on genarians.org) => http://en.wikipedia....l/Nonagenarians\n\nHe also had a dead pool but it's gone now."
