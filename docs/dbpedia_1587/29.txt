Agile Software Development is an introduction to agile software development methods. Agile methods try to diminish complexity, increase transparency, and reach a deployable product in a shorter time frame. Agile methods use an iterative and incremental approach to minimize risks and to avoid maldevelopment. The book gives a short introduction to agile methods and agile software development principles. It serves as a study book and as a reference manual. Based on the official Scrum Guide, the book also covers other topics such as best practices for agile software development and agile testing. It targets practitioners who want to start with agile software development, as well as developers or project managers who already use agile methodologies. The book can be read from the beginning, but each chapter has been written in a way so it can be read individually.
