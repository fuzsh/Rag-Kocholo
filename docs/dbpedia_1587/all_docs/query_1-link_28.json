        "text": "Looking for a comprehensive Agile glossary?\n\nEven though Agile has barely been around for 2 decades, it’s had a major impact on the world of software development.\n\nNeed proof?\n\nToday, 86% of all developers use the Agile method in their work!\n\nSince millions of in-office and virtual teams use Agile, it has evolved over the years, spawning multiple Agile principles, methodologies, and practices.\n\nAs a result, Agile teams created their own Agile terminology to manage all these principles and practices.\n\nAnd since nothing in software development is ever easy, these words can sometimes sound like they’re from another language entirely!\n\nDon’t worry, though.\n\nIn this Agile glossary, we’ll explain 50 key Agile terms that will help you decode this software development methodology.\n\nNow let’s start flipping through this Agile terminology dictionary, shall we?\n\nA-E: Acceptance Criteria to Epic\n\n1. Acceptance Criteria\n\nDefinition\n\nAcceptance criteria are a set of conditions that software must meet in order to be accepted by a customer or stakeholder.\n\nAnd how are these conditions decided?\n\nIt’s all up to the product owner. They need to determine whether the feature is doing what the users want it to do (user story).\n\nSynonyms\n\nClient accepted\n\nDefinition of Done (DoD)\n\nBonus: Storyboarding templates\n\n2. Acceptance Test\n\nDefinition\n\nAn acceptance test ensures that a software feature is working correctly and meets the acceptance criteria. It’s usually run after the software has been developed.\n\nSynonyms\n\nUser test, functional test\n\n3. Agile manifesto\n\nDefinition\n\nThe Agile Manifesto is a document that sums up the 12 Agile principles that guide the Agile framework.\n\nEvery Agile methodology strictly follows the principles and practices outlined in the Agile Manifesto.\n\nSynonyms\n\nNone\n\n4. Agile marketing\n\nDefinition\n\nIt’s a marketing technique that borrows heavily from Agile practices and values. Agile marketing professionals work in sprints so that their team can complete high-value projects in a very short period of time.\n\nAfter each sprint, they measure how well their project has fared, and see what changes they can make in order to improve their performance in the next sprint.\n\nAgile marketing is also a great way for your marketing team to respond quickly to the rapidly changing markets we see today.\n\nSynonyms\n\nNone\n\n5. Agile Mindset\n\nDefinition\n\nAn Agile mindset is a set of attitudes that an Agile or Scrum team should have towards their work.\n\nThese attitudes are inspired by Agile values and principles, such as:\n\nRespect\n\nCollaboration\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nFocus on delivering value\n\nHow do you develop an Agile mindset?\n\nAn Agile practitioner or an Agile coach can help your team embrace Agile.\n\nSynonyms\n\nNone\n\n6. Agile Principle\n\nDefinition\n\nAn Agile principle is a guiding practice that helps teams understand and adopt Agile.\n\nThere are 12 Agile principles that revolve around customer satisfaction, increasing the speed of software development, and flexibility.\n\nTake a closer look at all the 12 Agile principles.\n\nSynonyms\n\nNone\n\n7. Agile Release Train\n\nDefinition\n\nAn Agile Release Train is a combination of multiple Agile software development teams used to tackle large enterprise-scale projects.\n\nThink it of as a mega Scrum team!\n\nOn average, it consists of around 50-125 team members working together on different parts of the project. Just like a Scrum team, an Agile Release Train works in short bursts called iterations.\n\nHowever, their iterations (called program increments) are 5x the length of a regular iteration!\n\nThey are an essential part of the Scaled Agile Framework.\n\nSynonyms\n\nART\n\n8. Agile Software Development\n\nDefinition\n\nAgile Software Development is a project management technique that allows developers to create a working software model in just a few weeks.\n\nWait, isn’t this too fast? How is this possible?\n\nAn Agile team breaks down in their project into smaller development cycles called iterations or sprints.\n\nAt the end of the iteration, the Agile team is able to deliver working software with just the essential features. Users give their feedback and suggestions, and the Agile team includes it in future iterations, like us!\n\nThis cycle continues until you’ve created a final software that delights your customers.\n\nOver the years, it has split into different frameworks and methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP.\n\nJust like how some prefer cereal, while others like bacon and eggs for breakfast, different teams have different tastes when it comes to the Agile framework!\n\nWant to learn more about the varied flavors of Agile? Click here.\n\nSynonyms\n\nAgile Software Management, Agile project management, Agile methodology, Agile method, Agile approach, Agile way\n\n9. Agile transformation\n\nDefinition\n\nAgile transformation is the process of transitioning your entire organization to adapt to the Agile mindset.\n\nThis involves creating a work environment that supports innovation and flexibility. It also allows your project team to be cross-functional (having members with different skill sets).\n\nNote: Agile transformation does not mean teaching your team to use Agile software development methodologies.\n\nSynonyms\n\nNone\n\nBonus: Read our guide on Agile Scrum artifacts! 💜\n\n10. Backlog\n\nDefinition\n\nIt’s a list of new product features, updates, bug fixes, etc. that are required by the user.\n\nAt the start of every iteration, the product owner decides which backlog items the team needs to work on. After every iteration, the backlog is regularly updated with user suggestions and new features.\n\nSynonyms\n\nProduct backlog, sprint backlog\n\n11. Backlog Refinement\n\nDefinition\n\nIt’s a Scrum meeting where the Scrum team organizes the backlog to make sure it’s ready for the next sprint or iteration. In other words, it’s like spring cleaning… but for Scrum teams!\n\nIt is normally held at the end of the sprint.\n\nHere’s what the team does during this meeting:\n\nRemoves unnecessary user stories\n\nCreates new user stories based on user feedback\n\nPrioritizes features that must be included in the next sprint\n\nSynonyms\n\nBacklog grooming\n\n12. Bottleneck\n\nDefinition\n\nBottlenecks are issues that can completely slow down the development process.\n\nLet us explain:\n\nA sprint task goes through multiple stages during the development process, such as: ‘To do’, ‘In Progress’, ‘Review’. A bottleneck occurs when too many tasks are stuck at one stage, like a traffic jam of project tasks!\n\nAs a result, the project workflow slows to a crawl, something that you wouldn’t want in a quick Agile process!\n\nNo one likes traffic jams, right?\n\nThat’s why an Agile team usually uses a Kanban board to prevent this from happening.\n\nSynonyms\n\nObstacle, impediment\n\n13. Burndown Chart\n\nDefinition\n\nA burndown chart is an important chart that helps Agile project managers track:\n\nThe amount of work left in the project\n\nThe time remaining to complete the work\n\nThe x-axis represents the time left in a sprint, and the y-axis represents the number of tasks.\n\nAn Agile project management tool like ClickUp can provide a projected progress line that highlights how project progress would look like if your team works at the same pace.\n\nSynonyms\n\nRelease burndown chart, sprint burndown chart\n\n14.
