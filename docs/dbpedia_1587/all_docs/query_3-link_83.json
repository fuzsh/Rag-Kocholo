        "text": "Agile is a popular word in project management today. In this guide, we will try to explain what stands behind this popular concept, how Agile tools can help your particular project, and, what is more important, how to choose the software right for you. If you are in a hurry, scroll down to our Agile tools comparison and quickly check the features and prices of the most promising software. If you have a few mins, let’s explore first the nature of Agile.\n\nAgile methodology basics\n\nAgile is a project management concept that originated to support projects with many unknowns. Agile allows project managers to deliver and market projects in a flexible way and handle changes faster and easier than other project methodologies. The diversity of Agile approaches, such as Scrum and Kanban, made it possible to take a new look at project management.\n\nThe Agile methodology rests on 4 key ideas and 12 principles, which we will now cover briefly.\n\nThe 4 key pillars of Agile are documented in the Agile Manifesto book and say that:\n\nIndividuals and interactions are always over processes and tools.\n\nWorking software is more important than comprehensive documentation.\n\nCustomer collaboration is superior to contract negotiation.\n\nReaction to changes is more crucial than following a plan.\n\nAgile project management is based on an iterative approach. This means that project planning and execution happens in sprints. And on every stage, the team presents project deliverables to the customer and then adapts the plan and the scope of work. The customer is closely involved in the process, reviews the progress, and provides feedback.\n\nAll projects that follow the Agile development methodology should focus on 12 core principles that are stated in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.\n\n12 Agile principles\n\nOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. The first principle is about bringing a valuable product to the customer on every iteration rather than keeping the customer blind till the very end of development.\n\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. However difficult it is to accommodate change, Agile welcomes even last-minute improvements as they make the final product more competitive. This principle makes Agile more beneficial for customers than other development approaches.\n\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with preference for the shorter timescale. Iterations of Agile projects usually last for one to four weeks. Such short sprints let the team introduce the needed changes faster.\n\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. According to the fourth principle, regular communication between the development team and stakeholders is crucial. The dialog usually happens as a daily meeting.\n\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Agile is about putting the right people in the right places and giving the team autonomy instead of micromanaging them. The project manager focuses on capabilities, motivation, and support to achieve results.\n\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. Face-to-face communication or at least video conferencing is considered more effective than email or phone.\n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress. Agile is about real results, so the time spent and project documentation are secondary to the efficiency of final deliverables.\n\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Agile proclaims that project interactions should be timed equally, and there should be no need for overtime work.\n\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Agile is about making the product better and more efficient by introducing innovation with every iteration.\n\nSimplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential. Agile focuses on doing precisely the needed and valuable things and avoiding unnecessary documentation, steps, and processes. Achieving the goals stated in the project specification is of utmost importance for the team.\n\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. The Agile methodology says that the team brings the best results if it is motivated to work and given enough autonomy. Team members collaborate and innovate freely, which leads to max efficiency.\n\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. For sure, no team is ideal, so Agile team members should have regular performance reviews to improve their skills and processes, and grow.\n\nThe advantages of adopting the Agile methodology for project management can be summarized in the following list:\n\nClose interaction with the customer\n\nMore adaptivity\n\nQuicker release\n\nFerer risks\n\nContinuous innovation\n\nAs a project management methodology, Agile is often compared to Waterfall, which is much more rigid and requires a preceding gathering of requirements and consecutive planned actions. The choice between the two depends on how well you know the requirements upfront and how many changes are possible in the course of the project.\n\nYou can learn more about Agile in this post — and now let’s go straight to Agile tools.\n\nWhat are Agile tools?\n\nAgile project management software includes all solutions that can be used to adopt Agile methodologies while developing products or providing services. Such tools should support iterative workflows and feedback management, as this allows the Agile team to continuously enhance the product.\n\nAgile development tools make project management more efficient, as the team gets:\n\na centralized database for storing all project data,\n\na single collaborative workspace for discussing all the details,\n\nproject progress tracking functionality for keeping everyone on the same page and\n\nperformance measurement.\n\nAgile project management tools should have specific features for Agile frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and Adaptive Project Framework (APF).\n\nWhat are the benefits of Agile project management tools?\n\nWorking with Agile project management software gives the development team a range of advantages.\n\nQuality product. Agile tools allow teams to visualize all tasks and plan the project activity — including changes — more thoroughly. As a result, stakeholders and clients review each step on time, and the team can introduce tweaks and deliver a more quality product.\n\nMore customer engagement. Using Agile project management tools and methodology, the team can work in sprints, and the project manager can engage with the client in the course of the project. This way, the project becomes transparent for customers.\n\nMaximum efficiency. The methodology itself and Agile development tools are about effective time management and minimizing rework. The team can use collaboration apps and adjust workflows to respond to customers’ feedback fast.\n\nLower risks of failure. Agile project management software helps project managers to gather and work on customers’ feedback at every step of the project. As the results are evaluated all the time, the final product can’t miss customers’ expectations.\n\nHow to choose the right Agile tools?\n\nThe flexibility proclaimed by the Agile methodology is very tempting. Yet, the trick is to choose the Agile project management software that can support this flexibility and integrate the needed processes and methods.\n\nThe key criteria for comparing software in this review were:\n\nTask management features. Those include Kanban or Scrum boards for projects, task lists, and other related features from attachments to comments, time and cost tracking.\n\nBacklog management features. These tools include labeling and prioritization of tasks, user stories, and bugs.\n\nUser story features. Most Agile project management tools provide cards on boards. More advanced software also includes special boards for user story mapping and features for estimating user stories.\n\nTeam collaboration. This group of tools includes all the features for communication with the team and stakeholders, task sharing, task lists, feedback, and assignments.\n\nAgile reporting. Agile project management dashboard should at least provide the burndown and velocity chart. Advanced Agile reporting can also cover progress reports for stakeholders, team performance evaluation, and financial reports.\n\nIntegrations. Agile development tools can be really helpful only if they work well with other software that the team uses. That is why we checked how well these Agile tools integrate with software development and issue management software. We also explored available APIs and integrations popular with non-tech teams, such as Slack and Google Apps.\n\nThe list below appeared as a result of comparing Agile project management tools based on features, usability, and prices. After evaluating the capabilities of tools, we looked at how reasonably they are priced, especially, set side by side to their alternatives. While choosing Agile project management software, also consider the scalability of the tool, available storage, and ease of communication. Fully-featured free versions will allow your team to understand how convenient it is to work on the project and discuss all the details with stakeholders.\n\n15 best Agile project management tools list\n\n#1.
