        "text": "Agile is a typical software development methodology in today’s software engineering besides the waterfall method. In this article, LTS Group will give you a detailed explanation of the agile software development life cycle (SDLC), popular agile software development methodologies, and why more and more businesses opt for the agile methodology.\n\nWhat Is Agile?\n\nAgile is literally the ability to respond to change. This is the optimal way to deal with uncertainty, either uncertainty of a thing itself or of what’s going to impact this thing.\n\nIf a business has agility, it has the flexibility to quickly handle changes and not be overwhelmed in a turbulent environment. Nowadays, when consumers’ expectation changes more quickly than what business owners can predict, applying an agile methodology and incrementally figuring things out will help steer clear of serious risks.\n\nWhat Is Agile Software Development?\n\nThe agile model in software engineering is an iterative adaptive software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, iterative development, and rapid response to change.\n\nAn Agile delivery model comprises small releases through small iterations. During each iteration, IT experts will carry out a particular amount of work and have the deliverable reviewed by stakeholders. Iterations are built upon each other, the latter outcome is better than the former, until the product reaches product-market fit.\n\nThe Agile philosophy involves strong collaboration and minimal up-front documentation. During the development process, the business team and the technical team follow a collaborative culture where constant reports and feedback are made.\n\nThe Agile framework is an ideal choice for complex systems development with dynamic requirements. It has largely replaced the traditional waterfall approach in recent years. A prominent indication of this shift is the fact that a majority of vendors emphasize the use of Agile methodology in their software developments\n\nTraditional Vs. Agile Approach To Software Development\n\nLet’s see the fundamental differences between Agile and traditional perspectives, such as the Waterfall and Spiral on software development.\n\nAt LTS Group, we keep in mind the pros and cons of each development methodology to advise our client to choose the right one. Typically, we suggest waterfall for predictable projects and agile for changeable projects.\n\nRelated: Top 10 agile offshore software development companies\n\nAnd now, we will go into details of the 4 Agile methodology steps.\n\nAgile Software Development Life Cycle\n\nThe agile software development process typically goes through the following 4 steps:\n\nConceptualization & Inception\n\nIteration\n\nRelease\n\nMaintenance\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nConceptualize & Inception\n\nAt the first step of the Agile life cycle, we define:\n\nWhat we want to build: Product-related items such as project ideas, target users, and expected outcomes.\n\nWhat we want to get: Business opportunities\n\nWhat we have to pay: Project-related items such as project scope, user story documents (product backlog), stakeholders, development team, budget, and timeline.\n\nIteration\n\nEach Agile iteration typically happens in several weeks and contains 4 steps: Planning, Execution, Review, and Backlog Refinement. Once an iteration is finished, the team review on the work, incorporates feedback, and gets ready for the next iterations, until we reach the target outcome.\n\nPlanning: The development team selects a set of requirements from the product backlog to be developed and delivered in the upcoming iteration. IT experts estimate the effort for each requirement and define the tasks needed to fulfill it.\n\nExecution:The team develops, tests, and integrates the software incrementally based on requirements and continuous feedback from stakeholders during the time-boxed period.\n\nReview:At the end of each iteration, stakeholders meet to review the increment, gather feedback and determine necessary adjustments for future iterations.\n\nBacklog Refinement: Alongside iteration reviews and retrospectives, the team continually refines and updates the product backlog as new requirements emerge, priorities change, or new insights are gained. This ensures that the backlog remains relevant and aligned with the project’s goals.\n\nRelease\n\nPost agile iterations, once the product is ready for release, system testing, functional testing, user training, and documentation development are implemented to guarantee flawless rollout.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe development team provides ongoing support for the software during its regular operation to ensure a smooth run. The team may fix bugs or refresh the existing product with upgrades and additional features.\n\nAgile Software Development Methodologies\n\nThe agile approach to software development is NOT a single framework. Instead, it is a philosophy for numerous project management frameworks. Here are some of the most common Agile methodologies:\n\nScrum\n\nKanban\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\nFeature-driven development (FDD)\n\nLet’s dive into a comparison of the 4 most common Agile software development methodologies.\n\nRoles In Agile Methodology\n\nAn Agile software development process often involves 4 stakeholders:\n\nThe user\n\nThe product owner\n\nThe technical leader/scrum master\n\nSoftware development team\n\nLet’s see the responsibilities of each party in an Agile software development life cycle.\n\nThe user\n\nAgile software development is all about putting the user first. That’s why today’s software development starts with defining the user personas and user stories.\n\nUser stories explain the user’s desired functionality from a user’s perspective. They are the heart of an Agile development process, which will guide the team on what to do and clarify why the team is doing what they are doing.\n\nThe product owner\n\nA product owner (PO) focuses on the engineering side of a project. Typically, he/she is in charge of:\n\ndefining the product vision,\n\ncreating the story backlog and acceptance criteria,\n\nmanaging stakeholders,\n\nmanaging the product roadmap, and\n\nkeeping track of the execution of every user story.\n\nA technical leader/scrum master\n\nA technical leader/scrum master manages the development with the below typical responsibilities:\n\ncoaches members on agile processes\n\ncreates estimates and plans\n\nsupports the progress of the project.\n\nOn the other side, he/she manages external coordination with the PO and other stakeholders.\n\nWhile larger projects often assign separate individuals for the technical leader and scrum master roles, small to medium-sized projects may merge these responsibilities into a single role.\n\nThe software development team\n\nAn Agile team is responsible for designing and developing the product. It typically involves:\n\nProduct designers\n\nUI/UX specialists\n\nDevelopers\n\nTesters\n\nWhy Choose Agile Software Development?\n\nThousands of IT businesses and development teams are benefiting from agile SDLC, however, it undeniably poses potential risks. Because, at its core, the agile approach to software development is about putting users at the heart of the SDLC and delivering user-accepted products, in a tradeoff for resource predictability.\n\nLet’s take a look at the pros and cons of Agile software development for further details.\n\nThanks to its flexible nature, here comes the major benefits of the agile approach compared to traditional approaches like Waterfall:\n\nAllows light beginning with compact documents and plan\n\nAllows priorities shift and requirement change\n\nReduces risks of misconception.\n\nAllows continuous improvement\n\nEnables the product-market fit process\n\nReduces management efforts thanks to self-organized teams\n\nBut apart from that, Agile methodology also has its challenges and constraints, which are worth mentioning:\n\nLess predictability of time, effort, and budget\n\nPotential priority crisis in case of change of user stories alongside poor team management\n\nGreater demand for client involvement\n\nLack of necessary documentation for post-development activities like maintenance and upgrade\n\nWith the given pros and cons, Agile methodology is ideal for complex projects and/or projects with dynamic requirements or without a clear expectation and outcome upfront.\n\nConversely, for simple, familiar projects or ones with clearly defined requirements, traditional approaches like Waterfall will be the better choice.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Agile Software Development\n\nAgile vs. Waterfall: What’s the difference?\n\nThe fundamental functional difference between the agile and waterfall approaches is the ability to respond to changes.\n\nIf you are familiar with the traditional waterfall methodology, you know that in a waterfall SDLC, we build an initial plan, then developers sequentially move along the standard software development process without revisiting previous stages, deliver a big batch as the initial imagination, and finish.\n\nMeanwhile, an agile process delivers the product through multiple small iterations or sprints, then collects and applies feedback to the next batch and delivers again, the latter is better than the former, until the product gets ready for the production stage.\n\nWhat are the 12 Agile Principles?\n\nTo further understand the agile methodology, we can’t miss the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The Agile Manifesto, which serves as a foundation for the Agile model, encompasses twelve key principles as follows:\n\nPrioritize customer satisfaction by early and continuously delivering valuable software.\n\nWelcome requirement adjustment, even in late development phases.\n\nDeliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).\n\nEncourage close, daily cooperation between stakeholders and developers.\n\nProjects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.\n\nEmphasize the significance of a face-to-face conversation.\n\nMeasure progress by working software\n\nPromote sustainable development and the ability to maintain a constant pace.\n\nPay continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.\n\nKeep “simplicity” in mind—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done.\n\nSelf-organizing teams invent the best architectures, requirements, and designs.\n\nRegularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts behaviors accordingly.\n\nFinal Notes Of Agile Software Development\n\nNeedless to say, in agile software development methodology, user satisfaction takes center stage. It enables the development team to receive real-time feedback, navigate an ever-changing landscape, and polish the product before its official release.\n\nAt LTS Group, we have helped our clients overcome the challenges of foggy requirements and successfully delivered over 100 Agile-based projects.
