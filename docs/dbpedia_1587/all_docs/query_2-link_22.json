        "text": "4 Core values of Agile Manifesto\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools – The first value emphasizes teamwork and communication. We must understand that software development is a human activity and that the quality of interaction between people is vital. Tools are an important part of software development, but making great software depends much more on teamwork, regardless of the tools team may use.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation – Documentation has its place and can be a great resource or reference for users and coworkers alike. The main goal of software development, however, is to develop software that offers business benefits rather than extensive documentation.\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation – Development teams must work closely and communicate with their customers frequently. By listening to and getting feedback, teams will understand what all stakeholders really want."
