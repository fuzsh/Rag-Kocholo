        "text": "The 9 Best Free Software for Agile Project Management in 2024\n\nTable of contents\n\nImplementing Agile project management successfully is a goal many businesses across industries are trying to pursue. This method, as opposed to more traditional ones, allows project teams to adapt more effectively to changing environments. But achieving this goal requires using the right tools.\n\nDo you need help to choose the best free software for agile project management? Let Appvizer guide you through some of the most popular solutions available on the market!\n\nLearn more about the specificities of the various agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban…) and some of the most important features to be included in the software for it to truly become an agile asset to your organization. Our list of the best free agile tools will help you decide for yourself which one would suit you best, complete with a comparison table to sum everything up.\n\nWhat is Agile Methodology?\n\nThe agile approach was originally created with software development in mind. It works best with small teams and can use a variety of agile methodologies (SCRUM, Kanban, Xtreme Programming…). What unites these different frameworks is their iterative approach to project development: the final product only comes after several project releases, following the principles of continuous improvement.\n\nThis way of working allows for changes to be made along the way: the client and other stakeholders are more involved and kept in the loop throughout the project life cycle. This means they can express concerns or clarify their needs, ensuring the project will meet these requirements.\n\nMost agile methodologies also adopt a customer-centric approach, with tools such as user stories and story points, which help distribute the workload and focus on real-life problems your service or product should solve. Other well-known agile tools include Kanban boards, which are a visual representation of the tasks at hand. It often plays a key role in keeping things running smoothly, as contrary to traditional methods such as Waterfall, multiple parts or phases of the project can be tackled simultaneously.\n\nWhat is the best Agile project management tool?\n\nIs there free Agile project management software?\n\nThere sure is! This list wouldn’t exist without the hard work of developers offering a free version of their project management app. Some are completely free and open-source, while others offer a limited free edition with premium features.\n\nWhile free, open-source project management software may be your first choice, you shouldn’t overlook the free tiers of paid solutions. Indeed, 100% free software often has hidden maintenance costs, not to mention it is often less user-friendly or up-to-date. Some solution’s free plans are really complete while offering support and a way to grow with your business.\n\nDisplay in full screen\n\nWrike\n\nAsana\n\nBitrix24\n\nClickUp\n\nJira\n\nMeisterTask\n\nOdoo\n\nTrello\n\nFor companies with more than 50 employees For companies with more than 1 employees For companies with more than 1 employees For all companies For companies with more than 1 employees For companies with more than 1 employees For companies with more than 1 employees For all companies\n\nPaid version from $9.80 /month\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nPaid version from $10.99 /month\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nPaid version from €49.00 /month\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nPricing on request\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nPaid version from $7.50 /month\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nPaid version from €8.25 /month\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nPricing on request\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nPaid version from $5.00 /month\n\nFree versionFree trialFree demo\n\nLearn more about Wrike Learn more about Asana Learn more about Bitrix24 Learn more about ClickUp Learn more about Jira Learn more about MeisterTask Learn more about Odoo Learn more about Trello\n\n1.

Few solutions offer a dedicated solution, but Scrum and Kanban boards are a great way to visualize potential features and their progress. Some even have swimlanes and advanced filters for a more granular approach.\n\nAutomation features: Agile focuses on speed and efficiency. The ability to automate your workflow can help you save time. Automation can be done with simple or advanced logic and formulas within the software. There is also integration with other solutions such as Zapier or third-party tools.\n\nAgile reporting tools: there are Agile ways to track projects.
