        "text": "Quick on your feet:Â think for a minute of your favorite athlete. Unless this person is a bodybuilder, strength and sheer power are only part of the story. For most sportsmen and women, real success on the playing field comes with a certain hard-to-teach nimblenessâthe ability to quickly take in new information and adjust strategy to achieve a specific result. Part of the appeal of sports is the excitement that comes with constant change, andâdiscounting the vicissitudes of luckâthe result comes down to how athletes apply their abilities in response.\n\nChange is also a constant in business (and, yes, life). Agile, in business, is a way of workingÂ that seeks to go with the flow of inevitable change rather than work against it. The Agile Manifesto, developed in 2001 as a way of optimizing software development, prioritizes individuals over processes, working prototypes over thorough documentation, customer collaboration over closed-door meetings, and swift response to change over following a set plan. In the years since its inception, agile has conferred competitive advantageÂ to the organizations that have applied it, in and out of the IT department.\n\nAs our business, social, economic, and political environments become increasingly volatile, the only way to meet the challenges of rapidly changing times is to change with them. Read on to learn more about agile and how to adopt an agile mindset.\n\nLearn more about McKinseyâs People & Organizational PerformanceÂ Practice.\n\nWhat is an agile organization?\n\nLetâs go back to sports for a minute. Maybe youâre a great free throw shooter in basketball. You make nine out of ten shots when youâre by yourself in your driveway, shooting around for fun. But when you meet friends for a pickup game at a nearby court, your shot is off. People keep jumping in front of you when youâre trying to line up, and maybe the sun is shining in your eyes from an unfavorable angle. You make maybe a couple of shots the whole game. The following week, disappointed by your performance on the court, you decide to make a change. Rather than doubling your practice time shooting in your driveway, you mix up your routine, practicing your shot at a couple of different courts at different times of day. Maybe you also ask a friend to run some defense drills with you so you can get used to shooting under pressure. Maybe you add a layup to your shot practice. This is a shift to an agile approachâand increases the likelihood that youâll perform better the next time you play pickup.\n\nTraditional organizations areâmuch like you shooting free throws in your drivewayâoptimized to operate in static, siloed situations of structural hierarchy. Planning is linear, and execution is controlled. The organizationâs skeletal structure is strong but frequently rigid and slow moving.\n\nAgile organizations are different. Theyâre designed for rapid change. An agile organization is a technology-enabled network of teams with a people-centered culture that operates in rapid-learning and fast-decision cycles. Agility adds speed and adaptability to stability, creating a competitive advantage in uncertain conditions.\n\nWhat is kanban and what is scrum?\n\nKanban and scrumÂ are two organizational frameworks that fall under the umbrella of agile.\n\nKanban originated in the manufacturing plants of postwar Japan. Kanban, which is Japanese for âsignboard,â was first developed to prioritize âjust in timeâ deliveryâthat is, meeting demand rather than creating a surplus of products before theyâre needed. With kanban, project managers create lanes of work that are required to deliver a product. A basic kanban board would have vertical lanes for processesâthese processes could be âto do,â âdoing,â âdone,â and âdeployed.â A product or assignment would move horizontally through the board.\n\nThe idea of scrum was invented by two of the original developers of agile methodology. A team of five to nine people is led by a scrum leader and product owner. The team sets its own commitments and engages in ceremonies like daily stand-up meetings and sprint planning, uniting in a shared goal.\n\nScrums, kanban, and other agile product management frameworks are not set in stone. Theyâre designed to be adapted and adjusted to fit the requirements of the project. One critical component of agile is the kaizen philosophyâa pillar of the Toyota production modelâwhich is one of continuous improvement. With agile methodologies, the point is to learn from each iteration and adjust the process based on whatâs learned.\n\nLearn more about McKinseyâs People & Organizational PerformanceÂ Practice.\n\nWhat are the hallmarks of an agile organization?\n\nA team or organization of any size or industry can be agile. But regardless of the details, all agile groups have five things in common.\n\nNorth Star embodied across the organization\n\nAgile organizations set a shared purpose and vision for the organization that helps people feel personally investedâthatâs a North Star. This helps align teams with sometimes wildly varied remits and processes.\n\nNetwork of empowered teams\n\nAgile organizations typically replace top-down structures with flexible, scalable networks of teams. Agile networks should operate with high standards of alignment, accountability, expertise, transparency, and collaboration. Regardless of the configuration of the network, team members should feel a sense of ownership over their work and see a clear connection between their work and the businessâs North Star.\n\nRapid decisionÂ and learning cycles\n\nAgile teams work in short cyclesâor sprintsâthen learn from them by collecting feedback from users to apply to a future sprint. This quick-cycle model accelerates the pace throughout the organization, prioritizing quarterly cycles and dynamic management systemsâsuch as objectives and key results (OKRs)âover annual planning.\n\nDynamic people model that ignites passion\n\nAn agile culture puts people at the center, seeking to create value for a much wider range of stakeholders, including employees, investors, partners, and communities. Making change personally meaningful for employees can build transformational momentum.\n\nNext-generation enabling technology\n\nRadical rethinking of an organizational model requires a fresh look at the technologies that enable processes. These include, for example, real-time communication and work management tools that support continually evolving operating processes.\n\nAgility looks a little different for every organization. But the advantages in stability and dynamism that the above trademarks confer are the sameâand are critical to succeeding in todayâs rapidly changing competitive environment.\n\nHow should an organization implement an agile transformation?\n\nAccording to a McKinsey survey on agile transformations, the best way to go about an agile transformation is for an entire organization to transition to agile, rather than just individual departments or teams. This is ambitious but possible: New Zealandâbased digital-services and telecommunications company Spark NZ managed to flip the entire organization to an agile operating modelÂ in less than a year.\n\nAny enterprise-wide agile transformation needs to be both comprehensive and iterative: comprehensive in the sense that it addresses strategy, structure, people, process, and technology and iterative in its acceptance that things will change along the way.\n\nTransformations vary according to the size, industry, and scope of the business, but there are a common set of elements that can be divided into two components.\n\nThe first phase of an agile transformation involves designing and piloting the new agile operating model. This usually starts with building the top teamâs understanding and aspirations, creating a blueprint for how agile will add value, and implementing pilots.\n\nThe second phase is about improving the process and creating more agile cells throughout the organization. Here, a significant amount of time is required from key leaders, as well as willingness to role model new mindsets. The best way to accomplish this phase is to recognize that not everything can be planned for, and implementation requires continuous measurement and adjustment.\n\nCulture is a critical part of any agile transformation. Agile is a mindset; itâs not something an organization doesâitâs something an organization is. Getting this transition right is key to overall success.\n\nLearn more about McKinseyâs People & Organizational PerformanceÂ Practice.\n\nWho should lead an agile transformation?\n\nThe single most important trait for the leader of an agile organization is an agile mindset, or inner agility. Simply put, inner agility is a comfortable relationship with change and uncertainty. And research has shown that a leaderâs mindset, and how that mindset shapes organizational culture, can make or break a successful agile transformation.\n\nLeaders need three sets of capabilitiesÂ for agile transformations:\n\nLeaders must evolve new mindsets and behaviors.\n\nFor most of us, the natural impulse is to react. Research shows that people spend most of their time in a reactive mindsetâreacting to challenges, circumstances, or other people. Because of this natural tendency, traditional organizations were designed to run on the reactive.\n\nAgile organizations, by contrast, run on creative mindsets built on curiosity. A culture of innovation, collaboration, and value creation helps nurture the ability to flexibly respond to unexpected change. Creative mindsets also help members of an organization, at all levels, tap into their core passions and purposes.\n\nRoche, a legacy biotech company, recognized the importance of a mindset shift at the leadership level. When the organization decided to build an agile culture, it invited more than 1,000 leaders to a four-day immersion program designed to enable leaders to shift from a reactive mindset to a creative one. Today, agility has been widely deployed within Roche, engaging tens of thousands of people in applying agile mindsets.\n\nLeaders must help teams work in new and more effective ways.\n\nAgility spells change for both leaders and their teams. Leaders need to give more autonomy and flexibility to their teams and trust them to do the right thing. For their part, teams should embrace a design-thinkingÂ mentality and build toward working more efficiently, assuming more responsibility for the outcomes of their projects and being more accountable to customers.\n\nLeaders must cocreate an agile organizational purpose, design, and culture.\n\nA critical organization-level skill for leaders is the ability to distill and communicate a clear, shared, and compelling purpose, or North Star. Next, leaders need to design the strategy and operating model of the organization based on agile principles and practices. Finally, leaders need to shape a new culture across the organization, based on creative mindsets of discovery, partnership, and abundance.\n\nFor tips on how to develop agile leaders, see âLeading agile transformation: The new capabilities leaders need to build 21st-century organizations.â\n\nHow can we build inner agility?\n\nInner agility can feel counterintuitive. Our impulse as humans is to simplify and solve problems by applying our expertise. But complex problems require complex solutions, and sometimes those solutions are beyond our expertise. Recognizing that our solutions arenât working can feel like failureâbut it doesnât have to. To train themselves to address problems in a more agile way, leaders need to learn to think beyond their normal ways of solving problems.\n\nHere are five ways to build inner agility:\n\nPause to move faster\n\nThis can be tough for leaders used to moving quickly. But pausing in the middle of the fray can create space for clearer judgment, original thinking, and purposeful action. This can take many forms: one CEO McKinsey has worked with takes a ten-minute walk outside the office without his cell phone. Others do breathing exercises between meetings. These practices can help leaders interrupt habits to create space for something different.\n\nEmbrace your ignorance\n\nBeing a know-it-all no longer works. The world is changing so fast that new ideas can come from anywhere. Competitors youâve never heard of can suddenly reshape your industry. As change accelerates, listening and thinking from a place of not knowing is crucial to encouraging the discovery of original, surprising, breakthrough ideas.\n\nRadically reframe the questions\n\nWe too frequently interrogate our ideas, asking ourselves questions we already know the answers toâand worse, questions whose answers confirm what we already believe. Instead, seek to ask truly challenging, open-ended questions. Those types of questions allow your employees and stakeholders to creatively discuss and describe what theyâre seeing, and potentially unblock existing mental frameworks.\n\nSet direction, not destination\n\nIn the increasing complexity of our era, solutions are rarely straightforward. Instead of setting a path from one point to another, share a purposeful vision with your team. Then join your team in heading toward a general goal, and in exploring and experimenting together to reach common goals.\n\nTest your solutionsâand yourself\n\nIdeas may not work out as planned. But quick, cheap failures allow you to see what works and what doesnâtâand avoid major, costly disasters.\n\nIn times of stress, we often feel ourselves challenged. Rather than falling back on old habits, inner agility enables us to embrace complexity and use it to grow stronger.\n\nLearn more about McKinseyâs People & Organizational PerformanceÂ Practice.\n\nWhat is deliberate calm?\n\nDeliberate calm is a mindset that helps leaders keep a cool head during a crisis and steer their ships through a storm. Itâs not something that comes naturally: in times of uncertainty, the human brain is wired to react rather than stay calm. The ability to step back and choose actions suited to a given situation is a skill that must be cultivated. In their 2022 book Deliberate Calm, McKinsey veterans Jacqueline Brassey, Aaron De Smet, and Michiel Kruyt describe their personal self-mastery practices to offer lessons in effective leadership through crises.\n\nOne important lesson? Not all crises are created equal. Inspired by the thinking of Harvard Business School professor Herman âDutchâ Leonard, De Smet differentiates between routine emergencies and crises of uncertainty. Routine emergencies can be dealt with using past experiences and training. But crises of uncertainty are different. In these moments, where you donât know how deep the rabbit hole goes, you canât fall back on what you know. âIf you are in an uncertain situation,â says De Smet, âthe most important thing you can do is calm down. Take a breath. Take stock. âIs the thing Iâm about to do the right thing to do?â And in many cases, the answer is no. If you were in a truly uncertain environment, if youâre in new territory, the thing you would normally do might not be the right thing.â\n\nFor more from De Smet and his coauthors, check out their discussion on The McKinsey Podcast, their Author Talks interview, or order Deliberate Calm.\n\nWhat is an agile transformation office?\n\nEstablishing an agile transformation office (ATO) can help improve the odds that an agile transformation will be successful. Embedded within an existing organizational structure, an ATO shapes and manages the transformation, brings the organization along, andâcruciallyâhelps it achieve lasting cultural change.\n\nTo set up an ATO for success, an organization has to make three design decisions:\n\nAgree on the ATOâs purpose and mandate\n\nAn ATO needs a purpose just as an agile organization needs a North Star. This step links an ATO specifically to the âwhyâ of the transformation. An ATOâs mandate can include driving the transformation strategy, building capabilities, championing change, coaching senior leaders, managing interdependencies, and creating and refining best practices.\n\nDefine the ATOâs place within the organization\n\nWhile an ATOâs reporting lines will depend on the organization, usually the leader of successful ATOs reports to the CEO or one of the CEOâs direct reports. This ensures tight alignment and support from top leadership.\n\nDetermine the ATOâs roles and responsibilities\n\nRegardless of an ATOâs size or mandate, the following core capabilities should be managed by a strong transformation leader:\n\nExecution leaders own the transformation road map, assessing and adjusting it on an ongoing basis.\n\nMethodology owners gather lessons from the transformation and refine and evolve agile practices and behaviors.\n\nAgile coaches guide teams through their transformations, helping to instill an agile culture and mindset.\n\nChange management and communications experts maintain lines of communication through periods of change.\n\nAs agile principles become the norm across industries, an ATO can help usher in an agile transformation regardless of the design choices an organization makes in setting it up.\n\nCan remote teams practice agile?\n\nAgile teams typically rely on the camaraderie, community, and trust made possible by co-location. The remote work necessitated by the COVID-19 crisis has put this ideaâalong with many other assumptions about work and office cultureâto the test.\n\nWhile the shift was sudden, talented agile teams working through the crisis proved that productivity can be maintained with the right technology in place. Here are some targeted actions agile leaders can take to recalibrate their processes and sustain an agile cultureÂ with remote teams.\n\nRevisit team norms\n\nTools to ease teams into remote work aboundâthese include virtual whiteboards, instant chat, and videoconferencing. But they still represent a change from the in-person tools agile teams usually rely on for ceremonies. Team members need to help one another quickly get up to speed on how best to shift to virtual. Teams also need to make extra effort to capture the collective view, a special challenge when working remotely.\n\nCultivate bonding and morale\n\nIn the absence of in-person bonding activities, like lunches or spontaneous coffees, team members can bond virtually, such as by showing each other around their homes on a video call, introducing pets or family members, or sharing music or other personal interests. Being social is important in the virtual space, as well as in person, to nurture team cohesion.\n\nAdapt coaching and development\n\nTeam leaders who normally do one-on-one coaching over coffee should transition as seamlessly as possible to remote coachingâcoffee and all.\n\nEstablish a single source of truth\n\nIn person, agile team processes are usually informal. Teams make decisions with everyone in the room, so thereâs not usually much need to record these discussions. In the virtual space, however, people might be absent or distracted, so itâs important to document team discussions in a way that can be referenced later.\n\nAdjust to asynchronous collaboration\n\nMessaging boards and chats can be useful in coordinating agile teams working remotely. But they should be used carefully, as they can also lead to team members feeling isolated.\n\nAdapt a leadership approach\n\nWhen working with remote teams, leaders need to be deliberate in guiding team members and interacting with external customers and stakeholders. Simply put, they need to showâin tone and approachâthat everyone is in this together.\n\nNow that it seems likely that remote work is here to stay, itâs all the more important that teams reinforce productivity by purposefully working to sustain an agile culture.\n\nLearn more about McKinseyâs People & Organizational PerformanceÂ Practice.\n\nHow can public-sector organizations benefit from agile?\n\nThe pandemic era and its attendant sociopolitical and economic crises have placed new pressures on public-sector organizations. In these situations of urgency, agile can help public-sector organizations better serve citizens by being more responsive.\n\nCompared with the private sector, where agile has had a clear impact on the overall health of organizations, the public sector doesnât immediately seem to be a great candidate for agile methodology. Government processes are often slower moving than their private-sector counterparts, and agencies are frequently in competition for funding, which can discourage collaboration. Finally, public-sector organizations are usually hierarchical; agile methodology works best in flat organizational structures.\n\nBut according to McKinsey analysis and experience, agile tools can still have an impact on public-sector productivity. As with any agile transformation, the approach should be tailored to each specific department, team, and organization.\n\nGovernment entities, for example, might focus on short-term, results-driven management styles. OKRs and quarterly business reviews (QBRs) are agile concepts that can transform planning and resource allocation for governments. Agencies, for their part, can benefit from increased collaboration and cross-pollination made possible by agile operating models.\n\nFor a more in-depth exploration of these topics, see McKinseyâs People & Organizational PerformanceÂ Practice.
