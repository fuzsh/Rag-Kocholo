Though there are many definitions of “Agile Project Management”, to put it in simple terms, it involves managing a project in several stages via constant collaboration with stakeholders, continuous improvement and taking incremental steps towards project completion.\n\nAn agile approach can be implemented to achieve swift & timely delivery, frequent re-evaluation, adaptive planning, constant improvement and a flexible response to change.\n\nWhy The Agile Approach Is Important To Project Managers\n\nSurprisingly, I have met some project managers who think that agile project management is something that applies only to software development and not to them at all - a common misconception. The fact is that every project has some level of uncertainty associated with it.\n\nIn a new-age environment, trying to implement a traditional plan-driven approach to project management can put project managers at a serious disadvantage. It is a matter of discovering how to blend both traditional and adaptive (Agile) approaches in the right proportions for any given project.\n\nAre you looking to implement a project based on an agile approach?\n\nLet’s explore some of the notable tools out there that support agile project management.\n\n1.Monday.com\n\nHubstaff Tasks is a visual project management tool designed to improve task organization and collaboration.
