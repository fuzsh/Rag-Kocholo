        "text": "Agile methodologies are approaches to development that are aligned with the values ​​and principles described within the Agile Manifesto for software development. Agile methodologies aim to deliver the accurate product, with incremental and frequent delivery of small chunks of functionality, through collaboration between small cross-functional self-organizing teams, enabling frequent customer feedback and course correction as needed.\n\nThe authors of the Agile Manifesto chose “Agile” as the label for this whole idea because that word represented the adaptiveness and response to change which was so important to their approach. It’s really about thinking through how you'll understand what’s occurring within the environment that you’re in today, identify what uncertainty you’re facing, and work out how you'll adapt thereto as you go along.\n\nIn doing so, Agile aims to address the challenges faced by the standard “waterfall” approaches of delivering large products over long periods of time, during which customer requirements frequently change, leading to the wrong products being delivered.\n\nAgile Manifesto\n\nThe Agile Manifesto is a statement of core values ​​and principles for software development. The Agile Manifesto for software development was created in 2001 and it is a declaration of 4 vital rules and 12 principles that function as a guide for people in agile software development. It was set by 17 professionals who already practiced agile methods like XP, DSDM, SCRUM, FDD, etc, gathered within the snowy mountains of the US state of Utah in 2001.\n\nWhy It Works\n\nAgile methodology enables working teams to figure out various environments that need evolved solutions and organization systems. It is ideal for teams that are working towards a common goal, but with different functional expertise. And here are 5 reasons why it works:\n\n- Iterative and incremental development\n\nIterative development breaks down large tasks into smaller pieces that may be repeated, refined, and researched throughout the software development cycle. The agile iterative approach allows development teams to plan, design, check and adjust iterations. The approach provides an area for customers to be involved during the process. Instead of delaying feedback until final delivery when time and resources have already been spent, incremental development ensures that teams can use feedback to form changes early and often.\n\n- Teamwork\n\nAgile relies on cross-functional teams to make communication easier between the various stakeholders within the project. The original text states this situation as; \"business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project\".\n\nMotivated teams generate the foremost value for the customer when given freedom. Projects are completed faster and with better quality by reducing micromanagement and empowering motivated team members.\n\n- Customer Collaboration\n\nUsing an agile approach in practice, you experience a partnership between the customer and development team within which discovery, questioning, learning, and adjusting during the course of the project are routine, acceptable, and systematic. Customer review is constructed into the method and therefore the customer gets to determine the merchandise at the end of each iteration. Agile projects create a chance for increased customer satisfaction and return on investment by handling change effectively.\n\n- Feedback - Continues Improvement\n\nContinued improvement for the way the team works and the product the customer requests are provided with the systematic routine partnership we mentioned above. Continuous process improvement looks at the way the team approaches the project to spot things that will be added, removed, or changed to extend efficiency and reduce waste. The goal may be a better experience for everybody involved and a far better output through self-improvement.\n\n- Simplicity - Quality\n\nSimplicity doesn't mean simplistic. To attain simplicity, the team will purify all the functionalities to the maximum amount possible to retain only the essentials and offer their client a functional environment. We want to specialize in the features that will help the customer enjoy the “result”, and which can ultimately not correlate with the number of features producing the “output”. In other words, simplicity for the customer must be supported by a coherent set of high-quality functionalities.\n\nWhat are Agile Methodologies?\n\nThe most popular and customary examples are Scrum, Kanban, eXtreme Programming (XP), Lean Software Development (LSD), Crystal, Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), and Adaptive Software Development (ASD). The foremost widely used methodologies are Scrum, Kanban, and XP.\n\n- Scrum\n\nemphasizes accountability, teamwork, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal, with transparency and adaptation as a basis. It starts with what is known at the instant moment, then allows for tracking progress and tweaking when needed.\n\nEveryone plays a role in Scrum; and in development, Scrum roles include product owner, who maintains the backlog, Scrum master who helps maintain the agile environment, and the Scrum development team. Communication happens via daily scrum meetings to align everyone and see how best to implement the sprint.\n\nScrum fits the first phase of a commercial product life cycle, during which the customer is placed in the marketplace for the first time; uncertainty is high, while the focus is on on-time delivery of the first market-ready product.\n\n- Kanban is quite another style of visualized workflow. It cuts work into small pieces and directly shows the progress of every task. It is perfect for indicating the source of problems, delays, and things which don’t work. It measures and well manages all the working methods so you are able to find bottlenecks. Kanban also includes a limit on the quantity of work which you'll take without delay. That rule makes sure that teams won’t take an excessive amount of work for every cycle before they end others. It promotes collaboration with the client and therefore the team,\n\nnonstop learning and finding the most effective workflow.\n\n- Extreme Programming focuses on principles and ensuring that delivered products are of the best quality. In XP teams work also short cycles, very closely. They can adapt and alter structure adapting to a new reality/situation/plan. It means the team and client can deliver products frequently, and faster with higher effectiveness.\n\nBenefits Of Agile Methodologies\n\nAgile methods help teams manage work more efficiently and do the work more effectively while delivering high-quality products within the constraints of the budget. Here is a list of advantages of agile methodologies explained in detail:\n\n- Quick on the market\n\nMost market leaders in various sectors were the first to bring their products or idea to the market. It is absolutely crucial to stay up with the ever-changing, fast-paced economy. Agile encourages early releases followed by regular releases after getting feedback from customers.\n\n- Happy customers\n\nThroughout a project, there is an energetic involvement of everyone engaged in the project. The project is in a position to be adjusted and altered to satisfy the customer.\n\n- Motivated team\n\nWhen a team works together to deliver valuable work and quality projects, their morale increases, thus they feel more motivated within their team. Political dysfunctions and project transparency reduce plenty of pressure. The working team is more connected as all of them have an influence within the team when it involves planning throughout a project and taking responsibility for his or her role within the team.\n\n- Improved quality\n\nAgile methodologies use an iterative approach to project management, meaning processes are improved upon every time an interval is repeated. This consistent specialization in the improvement and internal control is one of the core principles of Agile, and it helps to form superior products.\n\n- Reduced risk\n\nDevelopers regularly assess progress during sprints, meaning they get better visibility into the project and have a chance to spot potential obstacles quickly. These minor issues are tackled before they escalate, creating an efficient risk mitigation process thus giving the project a greater chance of success.\n\nTools\n\nAgile is absolutely a way of thinking and dealing. It is a technique out of the many that a team can organize itself when approaching certain tasks and projects. Agile relies on harnessing adaptability, flexibility and clear communication. This helps teams face the chaotic and exciting world of development to deliver cost-effective, user-friendly products.\n\nWhen choosing a tool to use for your agile process, you must take the subsequent into account:\n\nWhat size team do you have?\n\nAre you a development agency or does your company provide a software tool or service?\n\nWhat types of projects do you work on and what is the variety of clients you predominantly work for?\n\nWhat form of data do you need on an everyday basis? What styles of reports?\n\nWhat’s your team’s agile adoption level? Are they new agile?\n\nWhat’s your budget?\n\nWhatever your answer to the above questions is, the foremost important aspects that you should look for in every agile project management tool are:\n\nGood backlog management\n\nProject planning and tracking\n\nRoadmapping\n\nRelease planning\n\nGood collaboration features\n\nAtlassian's Jira Align does a great job at unlocking agility.
