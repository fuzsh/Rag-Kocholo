        "text": "Agile software development allows the team to deliver at least a demo at each iteration. Thus, the product stakeholders will see the progress in a simple, easy-to-understand format. It often takes months with traditional development models until they see the first demo version. In the meantime, the stakeholders can rely only on technical, difficult-to-understand presentations of the results. The ability to deliver working software at each iteration leads to stakeholder buy-in. Seeing what the software does gives them the confidence to keep investing. As for the development team, the quicker they get feedback, the easier it is for them to make the necessary changes. Furthermore, early feedback keeps the costs of implementing changes low.\n\nThe highly interactive nature of the Agile models and close involvement of the client helps identify any potential problems early. Thus, the team can use the daily scrum meetings to share the problems they face. As the team addresses the issues quickly, critical problems are less likely to occur than with traditional development models. This approach saves time for the team in the long run and avoids critical bugs in the software. Of course, identifying problems may require testing, which is an ongoing activity in Agile projects. Furthermore, testing often starts before development, and testers must build tests for new features. The entire team should work on the new user stories during sprint planning to relieve some pressure from the testers. Thus, testers will be familiar with the stories when writing acceptance criteria.\n\nIn Agile development, the project teams involve the customers in the development process, keeping them up to date and asking their opinions. Thus, there is a constant exchange of ideas between the development team and the stakeholders, which both sides value. Of course, the software product itself can only win from this approach. Keeping the stakeholders in the loop throughout the entire project ensures the final product meets their needs. When those needs result from deep and up-to-date market knowledge, they will contribute to winning products.\n\nWe briefly touched on several key features of the agile development models. First, agile focuses on delivering working software at each iteration. Thus, the product stakeholders will gain confidence in the project and support it. Next, we turned to how the iterative nature of agile contributes to continuous improvement with each passing sprint. We also explained how the close involvement of the client helps identify potential problems early and thus save time and money. Furthermore, we emphasized the role of agility and flexibility in the iterative approaches to software development. All these features contribute to high product quality and thus make clients happy."
