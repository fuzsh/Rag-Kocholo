        "text": "You sure can use certain agile principles in your projects, you don't have to use scrum, use whatever will work best for you. You can definitely benefit from some of XP methods and some scrum practices. But probably not \"by book\", 1-2 person team is just too small even for that little overhead scrum brings, start with what book says and then drop whatever you'll feel irrelevant after some time. Just don't drop retrospectives, it sure is worth the time spent discussing the problems you have, and finding solutions for them.\n\nYes you can use the principles of Scrum/Agile for 1 person. If you want personal productivity look at the Pomodoro technique or GTD.\n\nAgile techniques are suited to smaller teams as with larger teams it becomes more difficult to manage communication. With 1 or 2 people developing a project (and a customer) you should be able to work in an agile manner very easily. i suggest you read the agile manifesto as a good start to agile. For scrum, I'd suggest you look at Scrum from the Trenches. Kanban seems to be in fashion now and there is a personal Kanban too!\n\nIf I were you I'd manage and visualize my tasks and priorities using Kanban, and I'd adopt some of the XP practices: Test-driven development, retrospectives and time-boxing are probably good to start with. Later on, during retrospectives, you can identify more practices that you feel you need.\n\nKanban is very non-prescriptive. All it really requires is that:\n\nYou visualize your workflow\n\nYou limit your work in progress (especially useful in your case)\n\nThe idea is that you latch on other practices which you find useful, and XP is an excellent source for these practices.\n\nDisclaimer: I have never tried this, but it would be at the top of my list of things to try if I were in the same position.\n\nYes, you can use agile methods with only two developers, but you always need a dedicated customer/product manager. With only one developer, I would say no mostly because I personally like to work in teams, but also because you cannot really pair program, and thus miss all code sharing opportunities. Four to six developers + one product manager is the perfect size for an agile project. More than that, and sub-teams tend to form which kinda defeats the purpose.\n\nI don't know your exact situation of course, but it seems to me that you are running to many projects as the same time. My suggestion is that you should try to pitch the idea of lowering the amount of concurrent projects, and instead have, say, two teams working on one project each. That would be the first step to improve your situation and make it easier to apply an agile process.\n\nThere is much to be said about the badness of task-switching and project-trashing, but really, nothing good comes out of it. Ever.\n\nLooking at it another way:\n\nWhy don't you consider all 8 developers members of the same Scrum team? That way you get the crosstalk effect between projects. Maybe you don't even have to commit people to specific projects??\n\nWhen more people are added to your shop, you can possibly divide the team into two smaller ones."
