        "text": "Agile represents an overarching philosophy for software development, emphasizing the value of iterating quickly and often to satisfy customers. Therefore, an agile framework can be defined as a specific software-development approach based on the agile philosophy articulated in the Agile Manifesto.\n\nYou can refer to any of these frameworks as methodologies or even processes. Though, as you may recall that one of the manifesto’s four values states the philosophy prioritizes “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” Most agile teams use frameworks only as a starting point for their agile transformation, eventually customizing elements to meet their unique needs.\n\nVarious organizations use many popular frameworks. Often these organizations modify parts of the frameworks as they see fit and iterate on their own agile processes. Below you’ll find our overviews of several commonly used and well-document frameworks for agile software development.\n\nPopular Frameworks\n\nScrum\n\neXtreme Programming (XP)\n\nDynamic Systems Development Method (DDSM)\n\nFeature Driven Development (FDD)\n\nAdaptive Software Development (ASD)\n\nThe Crystal Method\n\nLean Software Development (LSD)\n\nDisciplined Agile (DA)\n\nScaled Agile Framework (SAFe)\n\nRapid Application Development (RAD)\n\nWhich Agile Framework is Best?\n\nWith so many different approaches to structuring agile processes within your organization, you’re probably wondering how to go about choosing one. Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all way to practice agile software development. Many factors may influence which framework you choose to work with. Such as:\n\nCompany size\n\nTeam structure\n\nAvailable resources\n\nNeeds of stakeholders\n\nStructure/size of your product portfolio\n\nEach framework has its own unique set of strengths and weaknesses. And the framework that works for someone else’s team might not be the right one for you. So ultimately, you’ll have to experiment a bit and figure out what works best for you.\n\nKeep learning how to set balanced priorities of both planned and unplanned work in our webinar below."
