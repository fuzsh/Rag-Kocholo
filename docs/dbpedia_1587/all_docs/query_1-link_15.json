        "text": "Agile is an iterative and responsive software development methodology. Features of Agile development include high levels of communication and collaboration, fast and effective responses to change, adaptive planning, and continuous improvement.\n\nAgile teams build applications in small increments rather than delivering the finished product all at once at the end of the development lifecycle. This allows for frequent testing while giving end users, stakeholders, and the business the chance to provide feedback on the work in progress.\n\nIt’s common for business requirements and user needs to evolve during development, and Agile keeps teams flexible and responsive to change.\n\nAgile teams are highly collaborative and cross-functional; team members have defined roles based on their skill sets, and everyone works together to deliver a working application.\n\nAgile frameworks prioritize individuals and interactions over processes and tools.\n\nThe roles necessary for project success will depend on the framework being used, but most Agile team structures start with a product owner, stakeholders, and specialists, such as designers and developers.\n\nScrum is a simple Agile framework used by more than 12 million people worldwide. Central to the process is the Scrum team — a small group of people working toward the delivery of a high-value product. Scrum teams are typically made up of five to seven people. Teams operate in sprints, which are fixed periods of one to four weeks where predetermined tasks are worked on. The Scrum team’s goal is the delivery of a minimally viable product (MVP), which is a solution with enough features and usability to solicit feedback for continuous improvement.\n\nThis dual role establishes responsibility for following the Agile framework by providing guidance, educating the team, and removing productivity blockers.\n\nThe Scrum Master works directly with the Product Owner to decide which user stories will be taken on in a sprint.\n\nThis role defines the project and its criteria, ensures that objectives are sufficiently understood by the team, and manages and prioritizes the product backlog.\n\nIn collaboration with the other team members, the product owner sizes and assigns the highest priority items to the next sprint.\n\nSMEs have the knowledge the team needs for a successful product delivery. Examples include a Systems Admin as an “Infra SME” or a UX expert as the “UX SME.”\n\nSMEs are also considered stakeholders for the project, but not all stakeholders have to be SMEs. Although SMEs are not part of the Scrum team, they can act as an additional expert to help on an activity for the product, that person is engaged throughout the project."
