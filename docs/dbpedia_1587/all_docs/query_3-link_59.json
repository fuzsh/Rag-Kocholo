        "text": "Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking projects into multiple phases. The agile methodology emphasizes continuous improvement and collaboration. In agile, the delivery is small and frequent. The cycle starts with planning and ends with delivering small chunks of the product. As agile follows a rapid development approach, aligning testing with agile is challenging. Agile testing tools help to fasten the testing cycle.\n\nWhat is Agile Testing?\n\nAgile testing is the software testing practice that follows the agile development approach. In the Agile development process project evolves in each sprint. The Agile testing aligns with these development changes assuring quality in each development cycle. Furthermore, the agile tester is active throughout the sprint, and he closely works with the developer to ensure the quality.\n\nOne of the major challenges in agile is testing. As the developer follows the agile sprint for the development. Tester needs to ensure that testing for the user stories is completed within the sprint. During the initial days of the sprint, the developer is less likely to provide the testable modules. As the sprint progresses, tester gets the module to test, and the testing window will be shorter. You cannot follow the legacy manual approach in Agile as it requires more resources and time. Agile testing tools help team member to speed up their process.\n\nHere, we have listed popular agile testing tools that can help you achieve your agile testing goals better.\n\nNote: Tools list given below are random and not ranked.\n\nJira\n\nJira is a popular project management tool.
