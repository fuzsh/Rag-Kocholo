        "text": "Modern app development moves fast. New code is written daily, but keeping everyone on the same page is hard.\n\nHow do we know what features are coming next? Did someone already start the design for that new dashboard? We want to move quickly but feel out of sync. There has to be a better way than confusing email chains!\n\nLuckily for technology teams, great new tools exist for agile collaboration. These apps help organize all the moving pieces without dropping balls. They provide different superpowers that let product, engineering, design, and leadership stay connected.\n\nProjects flow smoothly to launch when different roles have clear visibility into each team member’s progress.\n\nThis article shares essential solutions that allow agile engineers to organize efforts, align priorities, and ship predictably stellar products that customers love.\n\n1. Jira Software\n\nJira ranks as the most popular project management platform for agile software teams. Its strength lies in allowing groups to plan development sprints, create user stories, assign tasks to members, and visualize flow.\n\nSpecific benefits include:\n\nCustomizable project boards and Scrum views provide a visual map of work status flowing from backlog prioritization to “in progress” and finally “done.”\n\nAbility to estimate efforts in story points for backlog management and velocity tracking to forecast team capacity\n\nTeam conversations, comments, and attachments directly to stories enhance context.\n\nHundreds of integrations with tools like code repositories, test management, and more\n\nThe bottom line is that Jira enables transparency around work management so developers know what to focus on next, and leadership has insights into development health. The coordination superpowers increase agile team productivity significantly.\n\n2. GitHub\n\nGitHub has become the de facto standard for collaborative software development.
