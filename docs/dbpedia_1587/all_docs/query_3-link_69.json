That’s because people at the companies behind those offerings recognize users don’t necessarily clock in and out from the same locations each day.\n\nCloud computing also supports project management by allowing managers to update stakeholders on progress. Most affected parties want data-backed details. Cloud-based tools provide them on any internet-connected device.\n\nAutomation\n\nLeaders are increasingly likely to become interested in using automation or at least open to what it could do to improve business operations and performance. Even when automated features work slightly differently across platforms, they typically enable project teams to reduce or eliminate the manual work associated with task assignments, status updates and some scheduling-related duties.\n\nReporting\n\nAgile project management tools need reporting features, so users can drill down and get the necessary details about team member workloads, project issues or success or how much time a company devotes to a specific client in an average month.\n\nThis type of information is particularly beneficial when leadership members want to verify how valuable a client’s business is to the bottom line or identify instances where a customer might ask for project work inconsistent with the rates an organization charges them.\n\nScheduling capabilities\n\nSince many Agile project management tools allow for creating team member schedules and overseeing progress, they support business needs whether your employees work from one site or dozens. The availability of mobile apps allows you to change or verify schedules, even if you’re not in the office. After creating schedules, you can typically view them in several formats to fit user preferences.\n\nIntegrations\n\nAlthough you can expect Agile project management software to support integrations, there are often substantial differences in the number of integrations a particular software title supports. That’s why it’s a good idea to study all of the products on your shortlist and see how easily they work with your company’s current products.\n\nReview methodology\n\nWe chose these tools based on a series of criteria, including automation capabilities, integrations, dashboards and 24-hour support. We evaluated these tools by compiling reputable online resources, including reviews from active users.\n\nHow do I choose the best Agile project management software for my business?\n\nBegin by thinking about the specific things you want or need the Agile project management software to help your company achieve. You’ll want to consider logistical details, including how many people will use the software and which employees you’ll task with leading the learning process.\n\nSpend ample time reading reviews from current users and determining how closely their described situations match your circumstances. It’s helpful to come up with a list of potential deal-breakers. For example, if numerous reviews complain about a product’s mobile app crashing frequently, how much would that problem detract from how your users interact with the product?\n\nTalking to the people who will use the product daily is also essential. Considering their feedback should help the people involved feel more motivated about using new software, especially when they know it’ll directly benefit them.\n\nFinally, take advantage of the free trial periods offered by the software provider. That’s the best way to see how a product functions and whether it meets or exceeds your expectations. If you want to become a subscriber after the trial ends but still have lingering doubts, think about paying for a monthly membership rather than committing to an annual one.\n\nChoosing the best Agile project management software requires becoming aware of individual and company-level needs, then selecting the most appropriate product based on those factors. Speaking to sales representatives can give you a clearer idea of how companies in your industry or similar ones have benefited from a specific software platform.\n\nIf you’re looking for an Agile project management software, you may also want to consider workflow management tools.\n\nSubscribe to the Project Management Insider Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to Project Management Insider for best practices, reviews and resources.
