The Gambino crime family is one of the "Five Families" of the American Mafia, founded in the aftermath of the Castellammarese War. Albert Anastasia, a feared hitman, led the family until his murder by Vito Genovese's hitmen in 1957, and Carlo Gambino gave the family its present name. Gambino let his brother-in-law Paul Castellano take over the family after his death, and the family would go to war with itself as John Gotti and Castellano vied for power. The family was weakened by a series of FBI betrayals during the 1980s and 1990s, as several top mobsters entered Witness Protection and testified against other mob leaders. In 2015, the family had as many as 200 made members and up to 3,000 associates.
