        "text": "Ten members and associates of the Gambino crime family were arrested in New York as part of a \"U.S.-Italian takedown,\" according to the .\n\nissued Wednesday noted they were charged in a 16-count indictment unsealed in federal court.\n\nAmong the charges were racketeering conspiracy, extortion, witness retaliation, as well as \"union-related crimes committed in an attempt to dominate the New York carting and demolition industries.\"\n\nOther charges included assault and arson, as a few of them were accused of using a hammer to attack a man, as well as setting fire to another man's home.\n\nProsecutors said the defendants, who live in New York and New Jersey, include the following men:\n\nJoseph Lanni, 52, also known as \"Joe Brooklyn\" and \"Mommino,\" who is an alleged captain in the Gambino organized crime family\n\nDiego Tantillo, 48, also known as \"Danny\" and \"Daniel,\" who is an alleged Gambino soldier\n\nRobert Brooke, 55, who is an alleged Gambino associate\n\nSalvatore DiLorenzo, 66, who is an alleged Gambino associate\n\nAngelo Gradilone, 57, also known as \"Fifi,\" who is an alleged Gambino soldier\n\nKyle Johnson, 46, also known as \"Twin,\" who is an alleged Gambino associate\n\nJames LaForte, 46, also known as \"Jimmy,\" who is an alleged Gambino soldier\n\nVincent Minsquero, 36, also known as \"Vinny Slick,\" who is an alleged Gambino associate\n\nVito Rappa, 46, also known as \"Vi,\" who is an alleged U.S.-based Sicilian Mafia member and Gambino associate\n\nFrancesco Vicari, 46, also known as \"Frank\" and \"Uncle Ciccio,\" who is an alleged U.S.-based Sicilian Mafia associate and Gambino associate\n\nProsecutors also said Italian authorities arrested six members of the mob In Italy in coordination with the FBI and prosecutors in Brooklyn.\n\nAs alleged, for years, the defendants committed violent extortions, assaults, arson, witness retaliation and other crimes in an attempt to dominate the New York carting and demolition industries,” United States Attorney Breon Peace noted in the release. “Today’s arrests reflect the commitment of this Office and our law enforcement partners, both here and abroad, to keep our communities safe by the complete dismantling of organized crime.”\n\nJames Smith, who is the assistant director-in-charge at New York's Federal Bureau of Investigation,shared similar sentiments.\n\n“These defendants learned the hard way that the FBI is united with our law enforcement locally and internationally in our efforts to eradicate the insidious organized crime threat. Those arrested are alleged to have taken part in a racketeering conspiracy in an attempt to control the carting and demolition industries in the city. The FBI will continue to lead the fight against organized crime and ensure that individuals willing to cross the line face punishment in the criminal justice system” Smith noted.\n\nThe release noted Tantillo and Johnson coordinated a hammer assault, which left the person bleeding and seriously hurt.\n\nIn another example, said prosecutors, they threatened a man with a bat and set fire to the man's home.\n\nBrooke also \"violently assaulted\" a man on a street corner in midtown Manhattan.\n\nIn addition, Tantillo and Vicari were captured on judicially-authorized wiretaps discussing threats they made to John Doe 1 and John Doe 1’s father-in-law,\" accoring to the release. \"On one call, Rappa stated that Vicari “acted like the ‘Last of the Samurai,” describing how Vicari picked up a knife and directed John Doe 1’s father-in-law to threaten to cut John Doe 1 in half in order to get John Doe 1 to make extortionate payments. After John Doe 1 ultimately made a payment of $4,000 to Vicari, Vicari and Rappa met and sent Tantillo a photo of Vicari raising a small champagne bottle, as in a toast.\"\n\nThe defendants also \"committed a series of crimes to steal and embezzle from unions and employee benefit plans and rigged bids in the demolition and carting industries.\"\n\nThe men, said prosecutors, face maximum sentences between 20 and 180 years behind bars."
