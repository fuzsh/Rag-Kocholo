        "text": "Welcome to Part 5 of the Mobster Mondays series, and at the halfway point of the series, we look at another significantly popular Mafia boss after Lucky Luciano and Frank Costello – Carlo Gambino. Born on August 24th, 1902 in Palermo, Sicily, “Don Carlo,” as he was known as, was as cunning as he was dangerous.\n\nHe had a small stature, but was one of the Mob’s most powerful and influential figures right up until his death in 1976.\n\n“The Godfather” was known for being a savvy individual, quiet and reserved, but very clever. Allegedly, he had made his name in Sicily as a teenager before he ever went to America in 1921. He arrived in New York at age 19 to work with his cousins, under Mob boss Salvatore “Toto” D’Aquila.\n\nIn 1928, D’Aquila was killed by rival Mob boss Giuseppe “Joe the Boss” Masseria, causing Gambino to shift his allegiance to the the Masseria gang. He then found himself in a four-year war in New York, against the notorious Slavatore Maranzano, who came from a different part of Sicily. By the end of the war, both Masseria and Maranzano were shot dead, paving the way for the birth of the modern American Mafia. Gambino was what we can describe as an “original” member of one of the five New York crime families, underneath Vincent Mangano.\n\nOn the orders of Albert Anastasia, Mangano and his brother, Philip, were assassinated. Ironically, six years later, Anastasia himself was murdered, in a plot orchestrated by Gambino. He took charge of what became known as the Gambino Crime Family, and oversaw the Family for nearly two decades. Under his supervision, the syndicate expanded into territories and rackets it hadn’t in the past, and took control of several labor unions in New York, New Jersey and across the East Coast. They profited handsomely from an array of white-collar scams and finance-district fleeces.\n\nGambino’s success and sleek business moves made him loved by his men and many of his fellow godfathers. He built strong ties with Mob bosses in New England, New Jersey, New Orleans, Florida, Chicago, California, Pennsylvania and Detroit, among other locales, broadening his reach well beyond his Empire State stomping grounds.\n\nDespite being a notorious criminal, Gambino discouraged his troops from narcotics trafficking, enforcing a strict “deal and die” policy. He feared the long sentences often associated with drug offences, and didn’t want his men to have any reason to even think of cooperating with the authorities. He stuck to the “traditional” Mob activities – bookmaking, loansharking, hijacking and extortion, and maintaining as much of a presence as possible in the labor unions.\n\nHe did have a criminal record, though. In the 1930s, Gambino was convicted of running an illegal liquor ring, and served almost two years in federal prison. This would be the last time he would ever serve time behind bars. In 1970, he was indicted for masterminding a major East Coast burglary ring, but the government never nailed him. He was known for offering FBI agents coffee and dessert at his home before they took him in for booking.\n\nln 1972, Gambino’s 30-year-old nephew Manny was kidnapped and murdered by an Irish Mob crew led by James “Jimmy from Queens” McBratney. This practice had become common – the Irish Mob had been kidnapping Italian Mafiosi and extorting six-figure cash ransoms for their release. To get his revenge, Gambino called the now-famous John Gotti (who we will cover later in this series). Gotti, his best friend Angelo “Fat Angie” Ruggiero and Ralph “Ralphie Wigs” Galione gunned down McBratney in a Staten Island tavern in May 1973. They all eventually were convicted and imprisoned for the crime.\n\nIn the latter stages of his life, Carlo Gambino battled health problems, and heart disease claimed his life on October 15, 1976, at his Long Island waterfront home. Before dying, Gambino controversially bypassed his No. 2 in charge, Dellacroce, in favour of his brother-in-law Castellano, who was seen as a more “corporate-style” Mobster. This move left the Gambino syndicate on shaky ground in subsequent years. Dellacroce’s death from lung cancer in early December 1985 and Castellano’s decision to skip his underboss’s wake brought about a Gambino clan coup, in which Dellacroce’s pupil, Gotti, staged the murder of Castellano and his right-hand man, Tommy Bilotti, on a crowded Manhattan street in front of the popular Sparks Steak House and grabbed control of the crime family by force. More about this will be detailed in the John Gotti segment of this series.\n\nThough he died decades ago, Gambino left a lasting legacy on Mob culture. The title character in the most critically acclaimed Mob movie of all time, The Godfather, was inspired in part by Carlo Gambino. More than 40 years after his death, the New York crime family is still named after him. The Family was decimated by the federal crackdown during the Gotti era, the Gambino family is still involved in various criminal activities in Brooklyn and Staten Island.\n\nThat’s all for the notorious Carlo Gambino – next time, we will look at his brother-in-law Paul Castellano."
