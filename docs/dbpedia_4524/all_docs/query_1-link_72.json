        "text": "PROLOGUE\n\nThe Gambino Crime Family is known worldwide as the First Family in organized crime. The names may have changed over the years but today’s Gambino Family is still structured and controlled very similar to the earliest days back in Sicily.\n\nThe Gambino Crime Family is the most well-known and storied of New York’s five Families. Their lineage traces back to the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe current structure of the Gambino Crime Family took centuries to develop. It all began on the island of Sicily, just below Italy. Although there are other organized crime groups from other parts of Italy, the Sicilian Mafia is considered to be the blueprint for all other Mafia organizations.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the development of organized crime on Sicily. The island is located at an easily accessible and strategically place in the Mediterranean Sea. And because of this, Sicily was invaded, conquered, and occupied by hostile forces many times. The local people were often enslaved by the conquering party and were often treated very inhumanely by the foreign overlords. This led to an overall distrust of central authority and organized legal systems.\n\nThe family, rather than the state, became the focus of Sicilian life, and disputes were settled through a system in which punishment was dealt quickly and justice was received through personal vengeance and vendetta, beyond the limits of the law.\n\nIn the 19th century, the European government system finally collapsed in Sicily. With no real government or functioning authority of any kind, the island quickly descended into lawlessness. Some of the local landowners and other powerful men began to build reputations and eventually came to be seen as local leaders. They were soon to be known as capos.\n\nThe capos used their power to extract tributes (a form of a tax) from farmers under their authority (much like the feudal lords before them). Their authority was enforced through the threat and use of violence. Their criminal activities were never reported to the authorities, even by the victims, because of the fear of reprisal.\n\nThis was the beginning of today’s Sicilian Mafia.\n\nToday the word Mafia is used to refer to almost all groups or gangs involved in organized crime. Originally, the word Mafia meant an organized criminal organization of Italian, predominantly Sicilian heritage.\n\nIn fact, the word Mafia is a literary creation. The real name is believed to be Cosa Nostra meaning our thing. The phrase was used to describe the lifestyle of a Mafioso in Sicily.\n\nThe shroud of secrecy that surrounded Mafia activities in Sicily became known as Omerta, the code of silence. Omerta is the Code of silence when dealing with the government. It means manhood and refers to the idea that a man deals with his own problems without the help of a law-body. Mafia bosses still use this code to protect themselves from the activities of the criminals below them in the organization.\n\nThe people of Sicily believed that the government was there not to help them out, but to make things even more difficult. As a result, the Mafia's golden rule of Omerta was born.\n\nAlso, the practice of recruiting young boys into the Mafia, culminating with a final test, making their bones also stems from Sicily.\n\nIn Sicily, many people regarded the Mafia not as law-breaking criminals but as role-models and protectors of the weak and the poor, as the government offered no protection to the lower classes.\n\nAt one time, the Mafia had been more like an attitude of pride, honor, and high social responsibility and had commanded great respect and adoration; rather than a criminal organization interested only in monetary benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, the Mafia didn’t stay like this for long.\n\nSicilians and other Italians began immigrating to the United States at the start of the twentieth century.\n\nWhile the vast majority of them worked hard at building a new life for their family through legal means, some of them sadly brought the ways of the Sicilian Mafia with them.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1900, 655,888 Italian immigrants arrived in the United States, of whom two-thirds were men.\n\nMany Italians arrived in the United States hoping to earn enough money to return to Italy and buy land. Coming especially from the poorer rural villages in Southern Italy, including Sicily and Campania, most arrived with very little cash or education; since most had been peasant farmers in Italy, they lacked craft skills and, therefore, generally performed manual labor.\n\nSome would say that New York was built from the ground up by the blood and sweat of Italian and Irish immigrants.\n\nThe immigrants populated various US cities, forming what is known now as ‘Little Italy’, where they could easily establish an Italian cultural presence.\n\nItalian neighborhoods typically grew in the older areas of the cities, suffering from overcrowded tenements and poor sanitation.\n\nLiving together in such small communities created little more than a miniature version of the society they had left back in Italy.\n\nSome of their own people exploited this fact and began to extort the more prosperous Italians in their neighborhood.\n\nThe extortions were done anonymously by delivering threatening letters demanding money.\n\nThe letters were written in a mixture of dialects, by people originating from different regions throughout Italy, and the Black Hand symbols varied greatly in design. Some designs were a knife or a skull, an open hand, others a closed fist, while others showed a hand holding a knife.\n\nThis became a crime that would eventually become a criminal epidemic known only as, ‘The Black Hand’.\n\nThe Black Hand was a highly disorganized version of the real Italian Mafia.\n\nPeople paid the Black Hand extortionists in the fear that the American law had no understanding, or power, to help them.\n\nThe myth of the Black Hand spread through every Little Italy in America. This caused a strong fear in the communities, and even the mention of ‘La Mano Nera’ would cause people to cross themselves with the hope of protection.\n\nWhile the Black Hand was operating in America, the Honored Society was active in Sicily.\n\nThe Honored Society was slightly more complicated than the Black Hand of the United States.\n\nThe main organizer of the American Mafia, Salvatore Lucania, who would later be known worldwide as, Charles Lucky Luciano was born on November 24, 1897, in Lercara Friddi, a small town located about 45 kilometers (28 mi) southeast of Palermo.\n\nLuciano wasn’t the only future Mafia leader born in the area around Palermo at that time.\n\nJust five-years later, Carlo Gambino, the future ruler of the Gambino crime family, was born in the city of Palermo, Sicily, on August 24, 1902, to a family that belonged to the Honored Society.\n\nPart One\n\nThe Birth of the\n\nAmerican Mafia\n\nIgnazio ‘the Wolf’ Lupo\n\nOn March 19th, 1877, Ignazio Lupo was born to parents Rocco Lupo and Onofria Saietta, a middle-class family in Palermo Sicily. He had three brothers and one sister.\n\nThe word Lupo means wolf in Italian. This gave Lupo the nickname ‘Lupo the Wolf’.\n\nWhich translates to, Wolf the Wolf.\n\nIgnazio Lupo has sometimes been referred to by his mother’s maiden name as Ignazio Saietta.\n\nFrom about the age of ten, he worked in a dry goods store in Palermo.\n\nIn October 1898, twenty-one-year-old Lupo shot and killed a business rival named Salvatore Morello.\n\nWe will note that Salvatore Morello is no relationship to Giuseppe Morello.\n\nLupo said that he had shot Morello in self-defense after Morello attacked him with a knife during an argument in Lupo’s store. Lupo went into hiding after the killing and on the advice of his parents eventually fled Italy to avoid prosecution.\n\nAfter leaving Sicily he made his way to Liverpool, Montreal, and eventually arriving in Buffalo New York.\n\nProceedings were held in Italy on March 12, 1899, against Lupo.\n\nJust two days later, on March 14, 1899, Lupo was convicted in absentia of ‘willful and deliberate murder’.\n\nHe was convicted reportedly due to the testimony of the other clerks who worked in his store at the time of the killing.\n\nOnce Lupo had settled in New York, he opened a store on E72nd Street with his cousin, but after the two had a disagreement he moved his business to Brooklyn.\n\nShortly after moving his business to Brooklyn, he moved back to what is now the little Italy area of Manhattan in 1901.\n\nLupo opened a small import store at 9 Prince Street, and also ran the saloon across the street at 8 Prince Street. the saloon would become a known base for the Morello gang over the following years, with Giuseppe Morello owning the restaurant at the rear of the premises.\n\nIt was around this time, Lupo began preying on his fellow Italian immigrants, using the extortion tactics of the Black Hand to extort money from them.\n\nGiuseppe Morello arrived in New York City around September of 1892.\n\nHe was joined there roughly six months later by the rest of the Morello-Terranova family, including Morello's first wife Maria Rosa Morello.\n\nThe Morello’s had two children: a daughter, Angela who died in infancy before arriving in America. And one son, Calogero Charles Morell who was born in 1892 and died at the age of ten.\n\nIn the mid-1890s, the family decided to relocate to Louisiana, where some of their relatives and friends from Corleone resided.\n\nIn Louisiana, they worked on a sugar cane plantation. The next year, they moved to Bryan, Texas to pursue cotton farming.\n\nMembers of the family became seriously ill with malaria while in Texas. His first wife Rosa died while in Texas.\n\nGiuseppe Morello remarried the following year to another Corleone native, Lena Salemi. Giuseppe and his family moved back to New York, where he and his brothers were involved in several businesses.\n\nThis included coal, saloons, date factory, restaurant, oil, lathing, and plastering.\n\nHowever, the family primarily earned their living through underworld rackets, such as extortion and counterfeiting.\n\nJust as Morello and his family were returning to New York City, Mafia bosses Candelero Bettini and Nicholas Taranto were sent to prison for wholesaling counterfeit bills to associates who passed them in the community.\n\nMorello and an associate named Meggiore were arrested in 1900 on charges of passing counterfeit $5 U.S. notes.\n\nMeggiore was sentenced to six years in prison but Morello’s charges were dismissed.\n\nVito Cascioferro\n\nVito Cascio Ferro\n\nIn 1901, influential Sicilian Mafioso Vito Cascio Ferro visited New York City and assisted in uniting the Mafia families in the U.S. into a national network.\n\nFerro appointed Morello as Capo di tutti Capi (translated to Boss of Bosses) to oversee operations and resolve any disputes.\n\nGiuseppe Morello was the first known, Capo di tutti Capi, Boss of Bosses of the Mafia. While he was a unifying force initially, he later became a central figure in underworld conflicts between families.\n\nAt the end of 1902, Morello founded the Ignatz Florio Co-op.\n\nThe Ignatz Florio Co-operative was chartered at the end of 1902, it was a successful, and by all accounts legitimate, business until the financial panic in the summer of 1907.\n\nAt the time, Italians were a powerful workforce in the City. Over two million Italians came to New York between 1900 and 1910.\n\nMorello was not a builder in the literal sense, but his Co-op was one of the earliest developers of the Italian neighborhoods in East Harlem and the Bronx.\n\nGiuseppe Morello was the Co-op’s first treasurer, and Lupo was also a partner in the business.\n\nTheir mission was to build housing for the Italian community in New York City.\n\nInitially, the Ignatz Florio Co-Operative Association sold inexpensive shares, of two or five dollars, to Italian immigrants. Upon the completion of a building, shareholders earned dividends, which they could either take in cash payment or reinvest the money in the Co-op’s next construction venture.\n\nWhat appeared at first to be a legitimate business venture, eventually took on the familiar tones of more recent Mafia involvement in construction.\n\nWithin nine years from arriving in America, Giuseppe founded a gang known as the 107th Street Mob, which would evolve into the Morello Crime family with the help of Morello's half-brothers Ciro, Vincenzo, and Nicholas Terranova.\n\nThe Morello family is considered to be the first organized Mafia family of New York, with its leader, Giuseppe Morello often tagged the ‘Boss of Bosses’.\n\nHowever, by way of lineage, Lupo was the first boss of what would evolve into the Gambino Crime Family. Lupo was one of the first prominent Sicilian Mafia members to come to America.\n\nLike Lupo, Giuseppe Morello’s lineage would lead to another of the Five Mafia Families of New York, the Genovese Crime Family. Which is the oldest of the Five Families in New York City. Giuseppe Morello was also known as The Clutch Hand, because a birth defect left Morello with a badly disfigured right hand.\n\nThe only identifiable digit on that hand was the fourth finger; the others were curled together into what appeared as a small knot.\n\nGiuseppe Morello\n\nIt was the eventual merger between Lupo in Little Italy and Morello’s Italian Harlem crew that put Italian organized crime on the map in New York City. Their mass numbers of criminals made intimidation and extortion of businesses easy money and it served as a deterrent to any potential competition to make their way into their territory.\n\nBy 1902 Lupo is regarded as the leader of the Manhattan Mafia. He is just an enforcer for Giuseppe Morello at this time.\n\nMorello's half-brothers Ciro, Vincenzo, and Nicholas Terranova, are also considered as top lieutenants.\n\nThe Morello Gang was known to stuff victims’ bodies into barrels and then leave them out in the public on local street corners. The message to the community was clear and that led to less resistance.\n\nBut it wasn’t just people in the community that the Morello Gang had to deal with.\n\nOn the evening of July 23rd, 1902 four boys went swimming near 73rd Street in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. One of the boys spotted a potato sack a few yards from the bank.\n\nInside they discovered a badly bruised corpse of thirty-year-old Giuseppe Catania, a Brooklyn grocer, with his throat cut from ear to ear.\n\nDetectives later found another sack close by that contained the victim’s blood-soaked clothes, they believed that the body had been tossed from a moving cart down onto the river’s bank.\n\nAt first, the police thought that Catania had been the victim of a twenty-year vendetta from back in Sicily.\n\nCatania had been a witness at a murder trial in Sicily, resulting in the conviction of two defendants. The police arrested one of the men, but no charges were filed and he was eventually deported back to Sicily.\n\nAt the time, the Secret Service believed that Catania had been a member of the Morello gang.\n\nThey suspected the gang had murdered him due to his habit of drinking and talking too much about the gang’s criminal activities.\n\nJust before Catania’s death, he traveled with Lupo to Manhattan together to get some stock out of bond from the importer’s office.\n\nHowever, after a thorough and painstaking investigation, the police were never able to gather enough evidence to warrant any arrests in the case.\n\nSalvatore Clemente, of the rival Frauto gang, later stated that Giuseppe Morello and Domenico Pecoraro were behind the slaying of Catania. But this information could never be confirmed.\n\nAfter the murder of Joseph Catania, in Brooklyn, Chief Inspector Flynn, of the Eastern Section of the Secret Service, learned that Catania had been a member of the Mafia and was associated with a gang of counterfeiters whom the Bureau had long had under surveillance.\n\nMeanwhile back in Calabria, Italy on February September 26, 1902, the future New York crime boss Albert Anastasia is born.\n\nShortly after the death of Giuseppe Catania, Lupo’s father arrived in New York. And together they opened a retail grocery store.\n\nLupo imported Italian goods from his brother-in-law, Francesco Gambino, via an import company.\n\nIn February 1903, a shipment of empty olive oil cans labeled ‘Rocco Lupo & Sons’ was sent by Francesco to the ‘Lupo Brothers’.\n\nThe cans were discovered and impounded for inspection by the Secret Service, after a telegram sent by Vito Cascio Ferro, led them to believe the gang was smuggling counterfeit currency into the city.\n\nAt the retail grocery store, he worked along with his brother, Giovanni Lupo who went by the alias, John Lupo.\n\nLupo worked as a presser for six years before leaving to work for his brother at his retail grocery store on Mott Street.\n\nJohn worked with Ignazio for just less than two years, he then left in October 1908 to start a wholesale grocery store in Hoboken named, ‘Lupo & Lo Presti’.\n\nJust one year later in May 1909, a gunfight broke out in Hoboken. One of the trucks belonging to Giovanni’s business had killed the four-year-old son of an Italian Banker. The accident caused a riot in which ‘forty to fifty shots were fired at members of the Lupo faction’.\n\nOn Thursday, April 16, 1903, Lupo, was arrested in connection with a killing after a body was found on East 11th Street in what would come to be known as the ‘Barrel Murder’ case.\n\nTwo days earlier, on Tuesday, April 14, 1903, at 5:30 a.m. in front of the building at 743 East 11th Street, a barrel was discovered with a man’s body stuffed inside.\n\nThe victim was thought to have been from a fairly wealthy background, due to his ‘clean person, good clothes and newly manicured nails’. The police found a piece of paper in his pocket, upon it was written ‘Vieni Subito!’ which was ‘Come at Once!’ in Italian.\n\nThe victim’s throat had been cut from ear to ear, and eighteen stab wounds in the neck. The wounds to the neck were noted as being inflicted before the fatal cut to the jugular vein, which meant the man was either attacked in his sleep or restrained as he was tortured. As the police determined that the victim did not fight off his assailant.\n\nThe body had been forcibly pushed into the barrel with the head resting between the knees.\n\nThe local Police believed that the barrel, that had once been used for shipping sugar, was dumped from a wagon in the early hours. On the bottom of the barrel was stenciled the letters, ‘W.T’, and on the side, ‘G 228’.\n\nThe police located where they thought the murder had been committed. It was a pastry shop on 226 Elizabeth Street — Dolceria Pasticceria, which was right around the corner from Lupo’s small import store at 9 Prince Street.\n\nIt was there they found an identical barrel to the one used in the murder, even bearing the same inscriptions.\n\nSawdust, and some burlap, on the floor of the shop, had also been found in the base of the murder barrel. The barrel was eventually traced to Wallace & Thompson bakery, where their record books showed an entry of a sugar order, by Pietro Inzerillo, just two months earlier in February.\n\nThe following day, Secret Service agents, who had been tracking the Morello gang for over a year in connection with counterfeiting, claimed to have seen the victim with various members of the gang in a butcher’s shop on Stanton Street on the evening of Monday 13th.\n\nOn Wednesday the 15th, eight members of the Morello gang were arrested. Each member of the gang was found to be armed, with either a knife or a pistol.\n\nOne of the gang members arrested was Giuseppe Morello. It was later learned that he held a gun permit, granted by the Deputy Commissioner, under the authorization of the local police captain.\n\nOn Thursday the 16th, four more of Morello’s gang members were arrested in connection with the murder.\n\nThe police also went to Lupo’s apartment where they forcibly entered the apartment while he was asleep. Lupo acted as if he was sick and a physician was called from the Roosevelt Hospital.\n\nAfter the physician checked on him, he was deemed healthy and taken into custody. In his apartment, the police found a dagger and three revolvers.\n\nThat afternoon three patrol wagons carried the prisoners to the Jefferson Market Court to be arraigned. The court held the men on a charge of ‘suspicion of homicide’ and remanded them to police custody for forty-eight hours.\n\nOn Friday the 17th, the prisoners were re-arraigned at Jefferson Market Court. The men were again remanded to the jail for an additional 48 hours until Sunday morning.\n\nThe police were still trying to identify the murder victim found in the barrel.\n\nWhile being held in the Jefferson Market Court, Lupo was questioned by the police about the murder case he had fled from in Sicily just four years earlier.\n\nThe Secret Service told Lupo that they planned to re-arrest him on counterfeiting charges if they could not secure a conviction for the ‘Barrel Murder’ case.\n\nThey informed Lupo that they also planned to pin another murder on him based on evidence found during the raid on his apartment.\n\nLupo was the last man seen with Giuseppe Catania, the Brooklyn grocer who had been murdered in 1902. Catania was believed to have been involved in counterfeiting with the Morello gang before they killed him.\n\nOn Sunday, April 19th, the prisoners were arraigned for the third time. Assistant District Attorney Garvan was present for the people, and five lawyers represented the prisoners.\n\nThe lawyers all argued against the holding of their clients in jail as no charges had been presented against them. One of the lawyers produced a writ of habeas corpus signed by a Justice of the Supreme Court. The Jefferson court magistrate decided to adjourn the hearing until the next morning.\n\nBy this day the barrel victim still has not been identified, and the gang’s lawyers fighting for their immediate release due to the lack of evidence against them.\n\nThat changed when the police received an anonymous letter. The letter claimed that the dead man was related to Giuseppe Di Primo,(the surname is sometimes written De Priema or De Primo) a member of the Morello gang from Buffalo who had been jailed three months earlier and sent to Sing Sing prison to serve four years for a counterfeiting case based around Morristown NJ currency.\n\nLt. Joseph Joe Petrosino who was a New York City police officer who was a pioneer in the fight against organized crime visited Giuseppe Di Primo in Sing Sing prison.\n\nGiuseppe Di Primo had been in New York since 1891. His position was what was known as a \"Queer Pusher or just Pusher,\" the low-ranking men in the counterfeiting organization who circulated Morello’s bad counterfeit bills. Di Primo also owned a grocery store and was married with four children.\n\nDi Primo told the police the victim in the barrel was his brother-in-law, Benedetto Madonia.\n\nHe also told the police that he was a father of five children and worked as a stonemason in Buffalo.\n\nDi Primo left out the fact that Madonia was already a high-ranking member of Giuseppe Morello’s counterfeiting gang.\n\nBenedetto Madonia\n\nDi Primo told the warden of Sing Sing that he was sent to prison before the money from the counterfeiting crime was split up.\n\nHe said that not everyone was caught by the police and that he was entitled to his share. He sent his brother-in-law to get his share of the money from the Morello gang.\n\nHe believed that they must have argued over the money that was owed to him.\n\nDetective Petrosino also traveled to Buffalo to visit Madonia’s wife, Lucy, and stepson, Salvatore.\n\nThey told Petrosino about a pocket watch that Madonia had carried with him to New York. Petrosino telegraphed the description of the watch to the police inspector in New York, where his men traced a"
