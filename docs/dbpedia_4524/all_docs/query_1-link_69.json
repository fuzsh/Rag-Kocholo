        "text": "In Italy\n\nThe mafia in Italy has been around for hundreds of years in the areas of Calabria, Sicily, Naples and Apulia, all in southern Italy.\n\nSicily - The mafia in Italy was started in the island of Sicily. The mafia is still around here and they makes a great deal of money. Selling drugs is frowned upon within the Mafia or La Cosa Nostra, as being convicted of the intent of selling can cause a high prison sentence, which increases the risk of a member of the Mafia/Cosa Nostra becoming a \"rat,\" or betraying other members.\n\nCalabria - The Calabrian mafia (really called the 'Ndrangheta ) are another mafia group in Italy. It also makes profit from illegal drugs, and is now the richest Italian mafia group.\n\nNaples - The mafia in Naples is called the Camorra. It is not as well known than the mafia in Sicily and Calabria but has killed more people, as rival Camorra groups often fight one another.\n\nApulia - The mafia in Apulia is called the Sacra Corona Unita (meaning the \"United Sacred Crown\"). It is not as old as the other Italian mafia groups. Little is known about this group, but it is believed that it makes money from prostitution.\n\nVeneto - The mafia in Veneto was called Mala del Brenta (meaning \"Brenta's bad thing\"). The group was founded by Felice Maniero but has now been dismantled.\n\nIn America\n\nThe Italian-American mafia began at the time when many Italians moved to the United States in the 19th century. The first Italian mafia was in New Orleans in Louisiana but soon was in many cities across the country. The Italian mafia in the United States is actually called La Cosa Nostra, which in Italian means \"our thing.\" The American mafia is divided into different groups, or \"families.\"\n\nMany large cities have only one Italian-American mafia family, but some larger cities like New York City have more.\n\nNew York City has five Italian mafia families:\n\nThe Bonanno crime family\n\nThe Colombo crime family\n\nThe Gambino crime family\n\nThe Genovese crime family\n\nThe Lucchese crime family\n\nMany other American cities have Italian mafia families like in Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Los Angeles\n\nMafia groups in other countries\n\nThere are many other groups like the Italian mafia all over the world like these:\n\nThe Yakuza - The Yakuza is the name given to organized crime groups in Japan. They make money from prostitution and drugs. Currentl, the Yakusa is not as big as a threat as in its peak around 1980.\n\nThe Triads - The Triads is a name given to all organized crime groups in China. Because there are so many of them, they are called the Triads. They are not just from China but many countries in Southeast Asia. Another name for the groups is the \"Tongs.\"\n\nLatin American Drug Cartels - In Latin America, the largest crime groups are drug cartels. They compete for control of the drug trade, which makes them huge amounts of money. The drugs produced in South America are marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. The main drug cartels are in Mexico, in North America, and Colombia, in South America. Most of the drugs are produced there and then smuggled north into the United States.\n\nThere are other groups as well, like the mafia groups in Russia that make money from drugs and weapons. All of those groups operate in the United States, Canada, Australia, England and other Western countries and cause many problems in both those countries and their own.\n\nThe mafia in New York began when thousands of Italians moved there in the late 19th century and the early 20th century to find a better life. Many Irish and Germans also moved there for the same reasons. Many of those people set up a business or worked for businesses that were already there. Most earned very little money, and some of them, who were tired of being poor, decided to earn money from crime so that they could make more than by working.\n\nThere were many Irish and Italian criminal groups in the city who would steal, extort, and murder for money. The groups were known all-together as \"Black Hand\" but did not actually work as one group. There were many groups, and each worked on its own. The term \"Black Hand\" actually was the name of what the gangs did (extortion), not theirs.\n\nProhibition, unification, and Castellammarese War\n\nIn 1920 alcohol (or liquor) was made illegal in the US, and the gangs had a new way to make money. They brought in illegal liquor from Canada and sold it in clubs. They bribed police into letting them illegally sell liquor and made millions of dollars from that because they were the only ones who had liquor and so they could sell it at extremely high prices.\n\nAround then, several gangs in New York became one large gang, the Mafia, as their leaders realized that more money could be made if the gangs worked together. Giuseppe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano were two men who wanted to become the boss of the newly made New York mafia. Fighting, known as the \"Castellammarese War\" broke out between the two men, and many of their soldiers were killed. Masseria's underboss was Lucky Luciano, a man who also wanted to control the New York Mafia. He met with Masseria's enemy Salvatore Maranzano and plotted to kill Masseria, Luuciano's own boss.\n\nMasseria was shot to death in a restaurant in New York by Maranzano's soldiers; one of them was Vito Genovese, a man who would later become boss. That was also the end of the \"Castellammarese War.\" With the death of Masseria, Maranzano appointed himself the boss of the New York Mafia, who was called in Italian the Capo di tutti Capi, meaning \"Boss of all Bosses.\" He called a meeting with the other \"mafiosi\" (Italian for Mafia members) from all over the US and made the rules that are still used today.\n\nMaranzano united the Italian gangs of New York into one gang, known as the Mafia or La Cosa Nostra.\n\nHe then divided the gang into five families and appointed bosses of each family: \"Lucky\" Luciano, Joseph Bonanno, Joseph Profaci, Vincent Mangano and Thomas Gagliano, with himself as the boss of thesose bosses.\n\nHe made it so that no members could kill without reason or talk to anyone outside of the mafia about it.\n\nThe bosses of the five families, particularly Luciano, began to grow tired of Maranzano's arrogance and how he ran the mafia. Maranzano realized that and planned to have Luciano and his \"consigliere\" and \"underboss\", Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, killed, as well as others,. Maranzano did not act quickly enough and was killed by men dressed as police officers on the orders of Luciano and his friend, a Jewish gangster from Florida named Meyer Lansky. Luciano then became the head of the New York mafia but not how Maranzano had been. He helped the five families run their business but he did not control them or call himself the \"boss of bosses\". The five families were kept.\n\nThe Profaci family (named after the first boss Joseph Profaci) went on to become named the Colombo crime family after a later boss, Joseph Colombo. The Mangano family (named after the first boss Vincent Mangano) went on to become named the Gambino crime family after a later boss, Carlo Gambino. The Gagliano family (named after the first boss Thomas Gagliano) went on to become named the Lucchese crime family after a later boss, Gaetano Lucchese.\n\nFrank Costello became the boss of Luciano's old family, which later went on to become named the Genovese crime family after Vito Genovese became the boss and tried to kill Frank Costello. The Bonanno family (named after the first boss, Joseph Bonanno) kept its name as he was the boss for a very long time.\n\nFive Families over the years\n\nThis chart shows the bosses of the five families of New York since the \"Castellammarese War:\"\n\nBonanno crime family\n\nJoseph Bonanno (was boss from 1931 to 1965)\n\nGaspare DiGregorio (was boss from 1965 to 1968)\n\nPaul Sciacca (was boss from 1968 to 1970)\n\nNatale Evola (was boss from 1970 to 1973)\n\nPhillip Rastelli (was boss from 1973 to 1975)\n\nCarmine Galante (was boss from 1975 to 1979)\n\nPhillip Rastelli (was boss once again from 1979 to 1991)\n\nJoseph Massino (was boss from 1991 to 2005)\n\nlucy reed (Note: in more recent years Vincent Basciano, Salvatore Montagna, Anthony Graziano, Anthony Rabito, Michael Mancuso, Anthony Urso and Alphonse Bonanno have run the family but not necessarily as bosses.)\n\nColombo crime family\n\nJoseph Profaci (was boss from 1928 to 1962)\n\nJoseph Magliocco (was boss from 1962 to 1963)\n\nJoseph Colombo (was boss from 1964 to 1971)\n\nJoseph Yacovelli (was boss in 1971)\n\nVincent Aloi (was boss from 1971 to 1973)\n\nCarmine Persico (was boss during 1973)\n\n(Note: in more recent years the leaders of the Colombo crime family have been Carmine Persico, Andrew Russo, Alphonse Persico, Jr., Joel Cacace, Thomas Gioeli, John Franzese, Vincent Aloi and Paul Bevacqua but not necessarily as bosses.)\n\nGambino crime family\n\nVincent Mangano (was boss from 1931 to 1951)\n\nAlbert Anastasia (was boss from 1951 to 1957)\n\nCarlo Gambino (was boss from 1957 to 1976)\n\nPaul Castellano (was boss from 1976 to 1985)\n\nJohn Gotti (was boss from 1986 to 1992)\n\nJohn Gotti, Jr. (was boss from 1992 to 1996)\n\nNicholas Corozzo (was boss from 1996 to 1997)\n\nJohn Gotti, Jr. (was boss from 1997 to 1999)\n\nPeter Gotti (was boss from 1999 to 2003)\n\n(Note: in more recent years the leaders of the Gambino crime family have been Peter Gotti, Arnold Squitieri, Anthony Megale, John D'Amico, Domenico Cefalu, Joseph Corozzo and Nicholas Corozzo but not necessarily as bosses.)\n\nGenovese crime family\n\nSalvatore \"Lucky\" Luciano (was boss from 1931 to 1946)\n\nFrank Costello (was boss from 1946 to 1957)\n\nVito Genovese (was boss from 1957 to 1969)\n\nThomas Eboli (was boss from 1969 to 1972)\n\nFrank Tieri (was boss from 1972 to 1981)\n\nAnthony Salerno (was boss from 1981 to 1987)\n\nVincent Gigante (was boss from 1981 to 2005)\n\n(Note: in more recent years the leaders of the Genovese crime family have been Liborio Bellomo, Dominick Cirillo, Matthew Ianiello, Frank Serpico, Ernest Muscarella, Mario Gigante and Daniel Leo but not necessarily as bosses.)\n\nLucchese crime family\n\nGaetano Gagliano (was boss from 1931 to 1953)\n\nGaetano Lucchese (was boss from 1953 to 1967)\n\nCarmine Tramunti (was boss from 1967 to 1973)\n\nAnthony Corallo (was boss from 1973 to 1986)\n\nAnthony Luongo (during 1986)\n\nVittorio Amuso (from 1987 on)\n\n(Note: during the 1990s the leaders of the Lucchese crime family were Vittorio Amuso, Anthony Casso, Alphonse D'Arco, Salvatore Avellino, Anthony Baratta, Domenico Cutaia, Frank Lasterino and Joseph Defede but not necessarily as bosses.
