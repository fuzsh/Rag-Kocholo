        "text": "An FBI spokesman says agents have been engaged in activity since Tuesday at two multiacre horse farms in Campbell Hall and Goshen that News 12 has uncovered have ties to the same owner.\n\nBlaise Gomez and News 12 Staff\n\n•\n\nNov 15, 2023, 1:56 PM\n\n•\n\nUpdated 285 days ago\n\nShare:\n\nTwo days of law enforcement activity at farms in Orange County are tied to investigations into the Gambino crime family, according to a high-ranking law enforcement source.\n\nAn FBI spokesman says agents have been engaged in activity since Tuesday at two multiacre horse farms in Campbell Hall and Goshen that News 12 has uncovered have ties to the same owner.\n\nAuthorities were first seen in unmarked cars and with shovels digging at 117 Hamptonburgh Road in Campbell Hall.\n\nA resident there said it appeared authorities were digging inside a barn on the property, and that he frequently saw a man named \"Sal\" on the property who would often shoot firearm rounds above an outdoor area where livestock are kept.\n\nFBI and NYPD agents were later seen on Wednesday at a second address nearby at 51 Hampton Road in Goshen.\n\nNYPD officers were seen standing guard at the foot of the driveway.\n\nAn officer told News 12 they are conducting a joint investigation with federal officials. The Campbell Hall property is owned by Viviane DiLorenzo, who has an address listed at 27 Celano Lane in West Islip, New York, according to Orange County online property records.\n\nThe property was previously owned by Giovanni DiLorenzo – the same person county records say previously owned the Goshen farm that’s being probed by law enforcement.\n\nThe Goshen property is currently owned by GDLI LLC, according to county records. That is also registered to the same address on Celano Lane in West Islip.\n\nA man named Salvatore DiLorenzo, who is from Oceanside, was one of 10 Gambino mobsters indicted on a laundry list of charges this month by the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nNews 12 called several phone numbers listed for Viviane and Giovani Dilorenzo and left messages."
