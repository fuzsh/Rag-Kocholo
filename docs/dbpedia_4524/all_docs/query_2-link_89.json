        "text": "Travis M. Andrews/Washington Post/Charles Sykes/Invision/AP\n\nSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The box office was not kind to \"Gotti,\" and neither were critics.\n\nBut despite only grossing $4.3 million at the box office since it opened last month, the true events surrounding the infamous American gangster will not soon be forgotten -- especially on Staten Island.\n\nFrom Snoope's Bar in West Brighton to Paul's Sweet Shoppe in New Dorp, \"The Dapper Don\" made his mark in a borough notorious for its mob ties.\n\nTony Carannante\n\nThe early years\n\nA young Gotti made headlines in the 1970s following the murder of James McBratney in West Brighton.\n\nIn the above photo, then-NYPD Detective Raymond Taylor leads Gotti into the 122nd Precinct stationhouse in New Dorp.\n\nIrving Silverstein\n\nScene of the crime\n\nWhen the nephew of then-godfather Carlo Gambino was kidnapped and murdered in 1973, it was determined McBratney of Port Richmond was involved.\n\nOn May 22 of that year, Gotti and two other men, posing as detectives, accosted McBratney inside Snoope's Bar and Grill in West Brighton, pictured above.\n\nAfter a struggle, one of the men fatally shot McBratney. Gotti struck a plea bargain with the Staten Island district attorney's office which resulted in a two-year prison term.\n\nSteve Zaffarano\n\nMob royalty\n\nAt the time of Gotti's release from prison, the Gambino family had a new leader with an iconic home at Staten Island's highest point.\n\nPaul Castellano resided on Todt Hill in a sprawling mansion referred to by locals as the \"White House.\"\n\nThis photo shows Castellano, center, and fellow mobster Tommy Bilotti of Eltingville, left, heading to Manhattan federal court two months before they were killed.\n\nMario Suriani\n\n'Hit' heard 'round the world\n\nIn 1985, \"Big Paul\" Castellano was shot and killed along with Bilotti outside Sparks Steak House in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nPictured above is Castellano on a stretcher outside the restaurant, where three unidentified men opened fire.\n\nGotti claimed the top spot in the Gambino family following the gangland shooting.\n\nTony Dugal\n\n'White House'\n\nCastellano's Todt Hill mansion pictured above in March 1985.\n\nA new sheriff in town\n\nA bulletin board in a mob investigator's office showed photos of Gambino members, including John Gotti at the top.\n\nAlso pictured was Gotti's top adviser, Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano, who at one time had a home in Graniteville.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nBody found in New Dorp\n\nFollowing an attempt on Gotti's life in 1987, the body of a man described as a religious fanatic who dressed like a priest turned up in the basement of a candy store on Staten Island, according to Advance archives.\n\nAuthorities at the time said William Ciccone was tortured and killed inside Paul's Sweet Shoppe, located at 44 New Dorp Plaza.\n\nThe business was owned by Gambino wiseguy Joseph \"The Cat\" LaForte.\n\nPictured is a modern day look at the commercial block.\n\nAP Photo/Mark Lennihan\n\nGotti on trial\n\nAfter beating multiple federal cases, the \"Teflon Don\" was found guilty in 1992 for charges that included murder and racketeering.\n\nHe died in 2002 at the age of 61 inside a federal prison hospital in Springfield, Mo.\n\nGravano sings\n\nTo the surprise of prosecutors, Gotti's right-hand man Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano agreed to testify against his former boss in a Brooklyn courtroom.\n\nGravano's testimony and FBI wiretaps were instrumental in Gotti's conviction.\n\nAP Photo/Maricopa County Sheriff's Office\n\n'Sammy the Bull' arrested\n\nAfter a short prison stint and witness protection, Gravano moved to Tempe, Ariz., where he lived under the assumed name Jimmy Moran, according to a New York Post report.\n\nThe former Gambino under boss then pleaded guilty in 2001 to running a nearly 50-person, $500,000-a-week ecstasy ring. He was sentenced to 20 years behind bars.\n\nIn 2017, he was released five years early; he will remain on federal parole for the rest of his life.\n\nIrving Silverstein\n\n'White House' makes headlines again\n\nPolice responded to a break-in at the notorious \"White House\" on Benedict Road in 2011, decades after Castellano owned the property.\n\nThe incident was tied to the notorious \"ninja burglar,\" who was chased from the property by the gun-wielding homeowner.\n\nAP/Louis Lanzano\n\nVictoria Gotti weighs in on the film\n\nIn a recent interview on \"Morano in the Morning,\" Victoria Gotti weighed in on the film that documented her life.\n\nShe said the film was the most accurate one that's been made about her late husband, and that she lent some of her husband's actual clothes to Travolta for the role.\n\nShe said her late husband was mistreated in prison as he was dying of cancer.\n\nHere, Victoria Gotti is seen leaving Manhattan federal court in February 2006 during a retrial of her son, John Gotti Jr."
