        "text": "On 13 March 2019, American mobster Frank Cali was shot dead outside his Staten Island, New York home. Before his death, Cali had been the acting boss of the Gambino Crime family since 2015. And since the Gambino Family had always had a leader since the 1900s when it was formed, somebody had to step in his shoes, and the likely candidate was Lorenzo Mannino. So, is he the current boss of the Gambino family?\n\nLorenzo Mannino is an American mobster affiliated with the Gambino Crime family. He is a captain in the Gambino Crime family. Mannino was sentenced to 15 years in a US prison.\n\nAfter his release in 2004, his whereabouts remained unknown. However, when Frank Cali died in 2019, all indications were he would become the boss of the Gambino Crime family. So, who is the current boss of the Gambino family?\n\nLorenzo Mannino profile summary\n\nFull nameLorenzo ManninoNicknameLoreGenderMaleDate of birth1959Age64NationalityAmericanEthnicityCaucasianReligionCatholicSexualityStraightHair colourBrownEye colourBrownMarital statusMarriedProfessionMobster\n\nInteresting facts about Lorenzo Mannino\n\nLorenzo has an influential position in the Gambino Crime's family. After serving 15 years in prison, he went to Brooklyn to live with his family. But since then, he has managed to stay out of the public. Here are some facts about him:\n\n1. Lorenzo is a leader in the Gambino Crime Family\n\nBefore May 2019, the head of the Gambino Crime family was Frank Cali. Frank Cali and Lorenzo Mannino did not have the same roles. Cali was an acting boss, while Lorenzo was a caporegime or captain within the structures of the family’s leadership. He was promoted to senior positions after serving his term in prison.\n\nFrank Cali had been an acting boss since 2015. However, when Frank Cali died in front of his home on Staten Island, Mannino became the leader of the Gambino Crime family. He was only the leader and the street boss. Thus, he is not the official boss. But in 2021, it emerged that Domenico Cefalù, an Italian-American mobster, became the boss of the Gambino crime family in New York City.\n\nDomenico Cefalù took the reigns as the official boss of the Gambino Crime Family in 2011 after the life-in-prison sentencing of Peter Gotti. While Mannino does not have an official title, Domenico Cefalù remains the official boss of the Gambino Crime family.\n\n2. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison\n\nIn 1994, Lorenzo pleaded guilty to two charges. The first was drug trafficking, and the second was conspiring to murder Francesco Oliveri. But the conspiracy to murder Francesco did not happen in the 1990s. Instead, it happened in May 1988.\n\nThe motive was to allow them to maintain or increase their position in the Gambino crime family. Lorenzo was a co-conspirator alongside John Gambino, John Gotti, Gravano, and Joseph Gambino.\n\nLorenzo Mannino was sentenced to 15 years in prison for pleading guilty. However, he only served ten years in prison and was released in 2004. Also, the court fined him $25,000 for drug trafficking and racketeering.\n\n3. Mannino supervised a loan-sharking organization\n\nIn March 2019, an American court handed Paul Semplice, one of the soldiers of the Gambino Crime family, a 28-month prison term for running a loan-sharking business. His loan shark business charged as much as 54% in interest. Semplice had pleaded guilty in 2018 to loaning money to a betting addict and distressed business owner.\n\nThe business owner died from a stroke. When Semplice faced the law, it emerged that he had beaten one victim because of non-payment. He also further stated that the supervisor of his loan-sharking business was Mannino.\n\n4. He worked as an underboss\n\nBefore he became an influential leader in the Gambino Crime family, Lorenzo worked as the family’s underboss between 2014 and 2018.\n\nLorenzo mainly operated in Brooklyn and Manhattan as a street boss. One of his subjects was Pasquale Marsala, a capo who served under Frank Cali.\n\n5. Lorenzo does not own a restaurant\n\nIn 1988, a man named Lorenzo Mannino established a pizzeria in Woodbury, New York. The name of Lorenzo Mannino’s restaurant was Woodbury Pizza. His restaurant served pizza in the Syosset area for many years. Unfortunately, Woodbury Pizza closed in April 2019.\n\nThe timing of the closure was suspect. It came at a time when rumours emerged that Lorenzo, the mobster, had succeeded Frank Cali as the head of the Gambino family. Frank died in March 2019. Also, reports suggested that the owner of the pizzeria, whose name is Lorenzo, had retired from Woodbury Pizza and had a daughter. But there's no Lorenzo Mannino's daughter, as he has no children.\n\n6. He lived in Brooklyn\n\nWhen Lorenzo was released from prison in 2004, he went to live in Brooklyn, New York. Lorenzo Mannino’s house was in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.\n\nIn 2019, Lorenzo was still living in Brooklyn when he became the street boss of the Gambino Crime family. However, Lorenzo has kept a low profile and is rarely seen publicly.\n\n7. Lorenzo is part of the all-powerful Gambino organised crime family\n\nThe Gambino organised crime family has declined since some influential members died or were imprisoned between the 1980s and early 2000s. However, the family is still strong and continues its work of organised crime.\n\nThe Gambinos and four other families, including Lucchese, Genovese, Colombo, and Bonanno, still involve themselves in organised crime. For example, Michael Desantis is the current acting boss of the Genovese Crime family. On the other hand, the Gambino Crime family still gets reinforcements from Sicily and Southern Italy.\n\nUnlike before, when the mobsters were more public and displayed affluence, nowadays, they keep a low profile, which is the case with Lorenzo. He has helped the family generate millions of dollars yearly.\n\nLorenzo Mannino is a high-ranking mobster in the Gambino Crime family. In 2019 after the death of the family’s acting boss Frank Cali, he become the boss of the organised crime family. In 2021, it became clear that Mannino was only a leader, and the official boss was Domenico Cefalù.\n\nTuko.co.ke also shared an article about John Gotti Jr. He is a former American mobster well-known for his role as the Gambino crime family's acting boss. Junior took over the syndicate's leadership in 1991 and remained in control until 1999 when the authorities indicted him on racketeering charges.\n\nHe was only acting boss because his father was already serving life in jail after a jury convicted him guilty of multiple offences, including murder and racketeering.\n\nSource: TUKO.co.ke"
