        "text": "Convicted gangster's presence 'raises some interesting questions' ,\n\nBack in the New York days, Carmine Romano was hard to miss as he made his way from one wiseguy watering hole to the next, exuding the very essence of gangster swagger.\n\nIn his days as an underworld prince of New York City's Fulton Fish Market docks, decked out in expensive suits, gold necklaces and wearing whole fistfuls of rings, he was a fearsome, 6-foot-2- inch, 360-pound presence, a full-fledged \"made\" man you messed with at your peril.\n\nToday, Mr. Romano, once known in New York simply as \"Carmine Fish,\" is the epitome of low-profile. For more than a decade, Mr. Romano has enjoyed a degree of anonymity on the New Bedford docks he never had in New York.\n\nBut in what must be a case of deja vu for Mr. Romano, federal investigators a year ago began leveling accusations of corruption and organized crime involving his adopted hometown's waterfront.\n\nDocuments and details available in the case against alleged crime boss Timothy Mello and his associates at Tempest Fisheries make no mention of Mr. Romano, who has not been arrested since his release from federal prison in 1989.\n\nBut in local law enforcement circles, the Mello case has sparked an interest in Mr. Romano, a convicted Genovese crime family soldier whose specialty was mixing the business of the Mafia with the fish business.\n\n\"It raises some interesting questions, doesn't it?\" said Detective Lt. Jack O'Malley head of the Massachusetts State Police Organized Crime Unit, which has been aware of Mr. Romano's position in New Bedford for the last several years.\n\n\"What is a guy like Carmine Romano doing in New Bedford?\"\n\nMr. Romano, along with his twin brother, was banned for life from doing business at The Fulton Market, the nation's largest wholesale fish market, and imprisoned for a decade for being the Mafia's point man there. Since his release from prison he has managed to blend seamlessly into the fabric of New Bedford waterfront life -- another fish seller whose past is his business and his alone.\n\nToday, at 68, Mr. Romano still keeps waterfront hours rising before most of his neighbors in Dartmouth are awake and heading to the city waterfront before the fish auction begins at 8 a.m.\n\nThe owner of Hygrade Ocean Products, Mr. Romano works long hours at his MacArthur Boulevard company, buying and distributing fresh and frozen scallops and fish, and shipping them throughout the country.\n\nThese days, the Brooklyn native enjoys an enviable position in America's richest fishing port. Married to a local woman, he's a partner in one of the most successful processing plants in the scallop capital of America and a partner in State Fruit, a well-established local produce distributor.\n\nHe pays contractors and suppliers on time, say waterfront business people, and is fair in negotiations.\n\nHe's not a fiery advocate for the industry, like his neighbor on the waterfront, Carlos Rafael, the outspoken owner of a dozen boats and a seafood processing plant, Carlos' Seafood.\n\nBut Mr. Romano is not an absentee owner, either, content to sit back and pocket the money underlings sweat for he works 8-10 hours a day, say waterfront colleagues.\n\nAround the auction and around the waterfront, he doesn't draw undue attention to himself. For most people he remains a massive figure glimpsed outside Hygrade or strolling into Candleworks, where he likes to take lunch at the linen-covered tables by the bar where his sister-in-law sometimes pours drinks.\n\nAlthough few outside elite law enforcement circles know it, Mr. Romano was once the underworld boss of the Fulton Fish Market in New York, a capo regime -- or captain -- in the Genovese Mafia family that oversaw a Mafia stronghold so thoroughly dominated by the Mob it set a standard for corruption.\n\nJoe Coffey is a retired lieutenant with the New York Organized Crime Homicide Task Force. From 1964 to 1996 he investigated some of the biggest Mafia figures in New York City. He arrested Gambino boss John Gotti, members of the Westies -- Hell's Kitchen's infamous Irish Mob -- and worked the so-called \"Commission\" case in which members of all of New York's Five Families were convicted.\n\n\"Back then (in the 1970's), Carmine fancied himself a businessman, \" said Mr. Coffey, now a consultant with the New Jersey and Nevada Gaming Commissions regarding organized crime. \"But he wasn't. He was a thug. He was a good earner. But he could throw his weight around. ... I consider Carmine Romano a capo. He was smarter than a lot of these guys.\"\n\nTheft was so rampant, out-of-town truckers hauling fish to Fulton simply built in the fish they were sure to lose, like taxes. Loansharking and bookmaking flourished. Businesses paid tribute to the Genovese Family each Friday -- \"Leeching Day\", the mobsters called it. Informants were beaten into silence or, in some cases, murdered.\n\nAnd for years, until he was convicted of extortion and taking illegal union kickbacks in 1981, Mr. Romano was the big man at Fulton.\n\n\"Whenever you have someone with his kind of negative, professional connections living in your community it raises your level of awareness,\" said former New Bedford Police chief Arthur Kelly.\n\nMr. Romano was secretary-treasurer of Local 359 of Seafood Workers' Union, the head of the 800-strong union that controlled the unloading and moving of everything at Fulton, where nearly a billion dollars of fish a year was bought and sold.\n\nProsecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan say that over the years he helped skim tens of millions of dollars from Fulton, where the Mob had had a stranglehold since the 1920s.\n\nWhen he ran the vast shady side of Fulton, Mr. Romano inspired the kind of fear usually reserved for natural disasters and impending death.\n\n\"I can't answer your question because I'm not prepared to die,\" one Fulton businessman told a federal prosecutor who asked him under oath if he knew Fulton union boss Carmine Romano in 1981.\n\nThe man, who prosecutors did not identify during the federal trial, chose to go to jail for 90 days, and pay $66,000 for contempt of court rather than testify to even knowing Mr. Romano. \"I mean no disrespect. I'm afraid of what will happen to my wife and children,\" he said.\n\nOne witness, Alec Messing, a veteran of the tough guy's world of New York's docks who faced no charges of wrongdoing himself, simply burst into tears on the witness stand and refused to say anything at all, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in New York.\n\n\"Threats have been made against me if I answer your questions truthfully,\" he begged. \"I risk harm to my family.\"\n\nYet another reluctant witness against Mr. Romano's union, Anthony D'Andrilli, was shot five times -- in the chest, face, neck, hand and head -- outside Mr. Romano's union office in April 1981 on the day after he accepted a subpoena from the government.\n\nIncredibly, the man survived.\n\nWhen the federal government finally went after the Mob in Fulton -- first with a Department of Labor probe in 1980, then with a flurry of civil suits in the late 1980s and '90s -- the prize at the end of their hunt was the Brooklyn-born Mr. Romano.\n\nWith his twin brother Peter -- both \"made\" men, full-fledged members of an Italian Mafia \"family\" -- Mr. Romano ruled a Fulton empire of guns, drugs, gambling, extortion, punishment beatings, murder and theft.\n\nManhattan U.S. attorney Daniel Bookin, who prosecuted Mr. Romano in 1981, described Mafia infiltration of Fulton to New York city newspapers with one simple word \"total.\"\n\nEven without the whole story of his past, the New Bedford waterfront has an inkling about Mr. Romano's reputation and gives him something of a wide berth.\n\nThe boys on the New Bedford docks call him the \"Big C,\" half a reference to his size and half an allusion to that other Big C, cancer.\n\nWith whispered stories on the waterfront about his trouble in New York, Carmine Romano, like cancer, is considered serious business, goes the story, something you don't want any part of.\n\n\"People know me as a businessman,\" Mr. Romano told The Standard-Times this spring. \"I came here 14 years ago and built this up myself. I'm a businessman. I've got nothing to do with any of that other stuff.\"\n\nTalk of that other stuff is hard to avoid on the waterfront lately.\n\nSince September 2002, when the Boston U.S. Attorney's office unsealed a racketeering indictment against the Mello Organization -- charging extortion, drugs, witness intimidation, gambling and weapons violations among other crimes -- things have been a little off-kilter along New Bedford harbor.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, people are considering the idea of a traditional organized crime presence on the waterfront.\n\nAnd, on the New Bedford waterfront, it's impossible to consider organized crime without acknowledging Carmine Romano's past and his presence here\n\nPublic records and federal and state court documents in New York, Florida and Massachusetts paint a picture of Carmine Romano as a man literally born into the waterfront rackets.\n\nCarmine Nicholas Romano, and his twin Peter, were born on Aug. 21, 1935, in Brooklyn, N.Y. The twins also had an older brother, Vincent.\n\nAll three Romanos would find lives in the New York world of the Italian Mafia and the rough-and-tumble waterfront fish market on the lower East Side of Manhattan.\n\nThey came of age during a pivotal time for organized crime. While they were children, the Mafia was still considered by many an urban myth, flourishing in the underground, grown strong during the years of Prohibition.\n\nBut during the 1950s and '60s, Congressional hearings and mob turncoats would reveal the American Mafia was real a violent criminal entity with an organizational hierarchy based on the Roman Legions and wrapped in ceremony, ritual and the code of Omerta -- vows of silence.\n\nThe watershed came in 1963, when a Mafia soldier named Joseph Valachi testified in front of Congress at the so-called McClellan hearings and told the nation, on the record, what many had long known the Mafia exists.\n\n1935, when the Romano twins were born, the Fulton Fish market was -- and remains -- the nation's biggest seafood market, and was already under the mob's thumb.\n\nJoseph \"Socks\" Lanza, a convicted Genovese family capo regime, or captain, had founded a labor union at the market in the 1920s for the men who hauled and unloaded fish. Socks quickly came to dominate both the union and the market that depended on it, according to federal documents and Mafia experts.\n\nRetired NYPD organized crime detective Joe Coffey said Mr. Lanza, a contemporary of legendary gangster Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano -- who founded what would later be dubbed the Genovese Family -- set the standard for Mob rule at the market.\n\n\"The common denominator with all Mob businesses -- the garment industry, drugs, trash trucking -- is money, the ability to make or steal lots of cash,\" said Mr. Coffey. \"And the Mob could make a lot of money at Fulton.\"\n\nLt. Coffey refers to the Genovese family, still considered the most powerful of the existing American Mafia families, as the \"Ivy League of the underworld.\"\n\nDepending on which story you believe, Mr. Lanza was nicknamed Socks either for his impeccable wardrobe, which always included silk socks, or because of a powerful right-hand he used to \"sock\" vendors and debtors.\n\nMr. Lanza was the archetypal New York gangster tough and smart and brazen and loyal to La Cosa Nostra -- \"This Thing of Ours.\" In his life he would be arrested for everything from burglary to election law violations to murder.\n\nHe went to prison for the first of his two convictions for racketeering at the Fulton Fish Market in 1936, the year after the Romano brothers were born. But the Mafia, and Socks, endured at Fulton.\n\nMr. Lanza continued to control the Fulton rackets -- \"protection\" scams, theft, extortion, price-fixing, loan sharking -- from his cell at New York's infamous Sing Sing prison. New York's waterfront became famous the world over for its lawlessness and deeply entrenched corruption.\n\nInto this world stepped the Romano brothers, whose enormous size and family connections made them naturals for Fulton.\n\nAnd early on, Mr. Romano had connections to New Bedford.\n\nHis uncle, Carmine Russo, himself a Genovese \"soldier,\" was the business agent for Local 359, and ultimately took over as the Genovese man in Fulton when Mr. Lanza retired in 1967.\n\nHe also owned a bar off the South pier at Fulton called, simply, Carmine's.\n\nIn the 1940s and '50s, the days before New Bedford had fish wholesale buyers and processing plants, many New Bedford fishermen took their catch directly to New York's Fulton Market. Carmine's bar, just up the street from the bustling market, became a hangout for the New Bedford crews in town selling their catch.\n\n\"Carmine (Russo) took care of the New Bedford guys, looked out for them,\" said Paul Saunders, a retired New Bedford fishing captain.\n\nLocal 359 also had its offices in the rooms above Carmine's Bar.\n\nBut the bar also attracted Mafioso -- and the investigators who were shadowing them more and more.\n\n\"We probably had bugs in there nine or 10 times during my time with the task force,\" said Lt. Coffey, who watched as a parade of mobsters met at Carmine's.\n\nMembers of the Bonanno family, who were allowed to run loansharking and gambling rackets in the market, were spotted there, as were members of the Gambino family, which Dapper Don John Gotti would come to rule in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1968, Mr. Romano and two other New Yorkers, brothers Vincent and Joseph Rugnetta opened a business in New Bedford. Bedford-York Transportation shipped fish from New Bedford to the Fulton Market.\n\nThe business brought Mr. Romano to New Bedford regularly. One retired New Bedford captain recalls Mr. Romano as a regular at the Holiday Inn bar here.\n\nBedford-York would be sold in the 1974 to Milton Ferreira, a New Bedford businessman.\n\nToday, according to state corporation papers, Mr. Ferreira and New Bedford's Maurice Noguiera run the trucking company Seaboard Express on the New Bedford waterfront. The company is housed across from Mr. Romano's Hygrade facility.\n\nMr. Noguiera's son, Christopher, was named in recently released federal court documents as an unindicted co-conspirator in the racketeering case against Timothy Mello and his associates.\n\nAlthough he faces no criminal charges in that case, federal prosecutors allege the younger Noguiera aided the drug side of the Mello Organization's operations.\n\nIn the 1980's, while maintaining fish operations in New York, the Rugnettas would open two fish houses in New Bedford Met Fisheries -- where Northern Wind now operates -- and Teddy's Fish. The Rugnettas' New York company, Inter-City Fish, would be among the many companies thrown out of Fulton and banned for life for Mob ties and making illegal payments to Local 359 in a civil case brought by New York City in 1982.\n\nIn 1968, the same year when Mr. Romano was starting Bedford-York Transportation, Socks Lanza died of cancer, a free man. Mr. Romano's family stepped into the leadership role, court documents show, and little would change at the market.\n\nMr. Romano and his uncle and brothers merely updated and reprised many of the rackets introduced by Socks, according to federal court documents obtained by The Standard-Times.\n\nIn 1974, Mr. Russo gave up his post in Local 359, turning complete control of the union to his nephew, Carmine Romano.\n\nnow, the Fulton was dealing with upwards of 200 million pounds of fish per year, a booming $1 billion market, with almost limitless opportunities for graft.\n\nFederal court documents show Mr. Romano's scams ran from the petty -- he forced business owners to \"rent\" plaques expressing support for Local 359 for $25 a month, and demanded cash Christmas \"presents\" from vendors -- to the brazen. Mr. Romano started a corporation in 1975 called Fulton Patrol Services (FPS) to reduce theft at the market and charged each business $1,200 a week and more for the service. Those who didn't pay were all but guaranteed to have their product stolen, their equipment destroyed or disappeared, according to federal documents.\n\n\"Carmine was the smarter of the two brothers, the real earner,\" said Lt. Coffey of the NYPD. \"Peter was the rougher one. He liked to throw his weight around.\"\n\nMany of the names on the FPS payroll were phony, many more were no-show employees, Assistant U.S. Attorney Bookin alleged in court papers at the time. The employees were Genovese soldiers and associates who spent their hours not patrolling the Fulton, prosecutors said, but hanging out in the Genovese social club on Front Street or doing errands in the rackets for the bosses.\n\nThe only real protection Mr. Romano had to offer, said federal prosecutors, was that people were too afraid to steal at the market without his say-so.\n\nDecades earlier, Socks Lanza had started Fulton Watch Patrol with similar extortionate intent.\n\nCarmine Romano had simply put a bold twist -- and a uniform -- on the age-old gangster protection racket.\n\nThe union demanded parking fees from out-of-town vendors, who would wait helplessly as their fish spoiled in their trucks if they resisted the fees. Those who didn't pay were assaulted or had their vehicles smashed, according to court documents and news reports at the time.\n\nAmong the most lucrative rackets was \"tapping.\" Union-controlled unloading crews stole a portion of each load of fish and later resold it themselves for undeclared, pure profit. Fish companies up and down the East Coast simply learned to calculate the tapping into their orders and prices.\n\nDepartment of Labor investigators estimated that more than a million pounds of fish got tapped by criminals at Fulton each year in the 1970's.\n\nLoansharking, gambling and other traditional vices also flourished at Fulton, and the mob money and mob power increased.\n\nBut as Mr. Romano was assuming control of the market, Mafia investigators were gaining new tools and strategies to fight the Mob.\n\nIn 1970, Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- RICO -- which allowed prosecutors to go after Mafia families as organizations.\n\nMafia soldiers and leaders now faced sentences of 20 years to life for each criminal act they were convicted of -- no matter how minor -- if the act was designed to further the organization.\n\nLike the garment industry and the Mafia-dominated waste-hauling industry, The Fulton Fish Market and the Genovese family became prime targets.\n\nIn 1978, New York City police raided the Genovese club on Front Street, where federal agents believed Mr. Romano received envelopes filled with kickback money and tributes. They found a small arsenal of stolen guns, heroin, 380 rounds of ammunition, $500,000 in stolen gems, a phony NYPD detective badge and gambling paraphernalia.\n\nMr. Romano was also indicted on state gambling charges in 1980, caught on phone taps discussing numbers rackets that netted thousands of dollars a day, say court documents.\n\nThe heat forced him to give up his union post. He simply passed the leadership on to his twin brother and became executive director of the Union's Fulton Fish Market Welfare and Pension Trust Fund, paying himself $650 per week, according to federal court documents in Manhattan.\n\n1981, the federal investigation into Fulton itself had gained steam.\n\nHeaded by the U.S. Department of Labor, the probe focused on the union's practices in the market. Some of the first pieces of the puzzle to fall into place came from federal investigators' scrutiny of billing records from Mr. Romano's New Bedford transportation company.\n\nAgents were able to show hundreds of thousand of dollars in discrepancies between what the union unloaders claimed to receive from shippers like Bedford-York -- about $498,000 -- and what the shippers claimed to pay the unloaders -- more than $871,000, revealing a massive skimming operation, they said.\n\nFederal agents served subpoenas in the market under a hail of abuse shouted threats, thrown fish and rocks.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Bookin told jurors one Fulton businessman signed a statement about the union activities with a shaking hand \"I've just signed my own death warrant,\" he told the federal agents, said Mr. Bookin.\n\nAt trial, the prosecutors made much of Mr. Romano's association with other known New York Mafioso and introduced wiretap evidence and video surveillance showing the two big Romano brothers meeting at known wise guy haunts then-Genovese boss Frank \"Funzi\" Tieri's house, capo regime Salvatore Mairioni's perch, the Dixie Tavern in Brooklyn, Club Napoli on 20th Avenue and others.\n\nMr. Bookin said in his summation that ''the defendants operate the Fulton Fish Market like their own little kingdom.''\n\n''This case is about fear,'' Mr. Bookin asserted, adding that the defendants were able to collect payoffs ''because of their ability to instill fear.''\n\nMr. Romano submitted some 350 letters from waterfront colleagues attesting to his good character. Prosecutors dismissed the letters -- people willing to pay thousands in \"protection\" money to Mr. Romano out of fear can hardly be expect to refuse to pen a letter of support, they argued.\n\nAll the while, Mr. Romano also had connections on the New Bedford waterfront. Soon, he would need them.\n\nIn October 1982, after a weeks-long trial, Mr. Romano was convicted of racketeering charges. He was given a 12-year federal prison sentence. He was also banned for life from doing business at Fulton.\n\nHe bounced around the federal prison system -- Lewisburg, Pa.; Danbury, Conn.; Duluth Minn.; Terre Haute, Ind.\n\nMr. Romano was released on parole from federal prison in late 1988. Federal parole doesn't exist today.\n\nIn February 1989, two months after his early release from federal prison, Mr. Romano married a New Bedford woman, the former Rosa Costa. Ms. Costa's brother, Kenneth Costa, is married to the sister of Maurice Noguiera, a partner in Seaboard Express, public records show.\n\nThe wedding was held in Monroe County, Florida, according to state documents there, near where Mr. Romano has a second home in Ft. Lauderdale and where for a time he ran a now-defunct fish business -- Universal Seafoods Imports, according to public records.\n\nHe had bought a house at 20 Swanson Dr. in Dartmouth in 1981, before his conviction.\n\nHe opened Hygrade Ocean Products in 1991 and later became partners in State Fruit, a produce wholesaler. Earlier this year, Mr. Romano and his partner in local businesses, son-in-law Albert Santos, joined two other men and bought out the family that had founded State Fruit at the turn of the century.\n\nA civil racketeering case in the Fulton Fish Market followed the Romano trial, and ultimately a federal administrator took over control of the market for a time.\n\nNewspaper reports and court documents show a dozen businesses were thrown out of the market in the 1990s, including the Rugnettas, who ran Inter-City Fish and employed Mr. Romano's brother, Peter, upon his release from prison. Peter died in 1999.\n\nThe older Romano, Vincent, had his trucking company, Benny's Express, banned from the market for its ties to organized crime in 1996. He moved to Florida and was arrested in a 1999 state probe into a ring of violent bar bouncers -- called the Circle of Sharks -- in Ft. Lauderdale's Broward County, according to federal documents there.\n\nThe Circle of Sharks was allegedly involved in bookmaking, loansharking, kidnapping and extortion from area strip clubs and bars and reportedly paid tribute to semi-retired mobsters John \"Johnny Sideburns\" Cerella and Vincent Romano, described in 1999 by detectives in Dade County Florida's Metro Intelligence Unit as \"Genovese soldiers\".\n\nVincent died earlier this year.\n\nAlthough he is banned from doing business at New York's Fulton Fish Market, Carmine still has strong connections there.\n\nMr. Romano's son, Carmine Romano Jr. has, since 1991, run a wholesale fish business with his brother-in-law, Richard Klein. Like his great uncle Carmine Russo and his father, Carmine Romano Jr. has found a home in Fulton. His company bears the name Third Generation Seafood.\n\nRobert Schulman, spokesman for the New York City Business Integrity Commission, said his organization took over responsibility for administration of Fulton this summer.\n\nKeeping Mafia influence out of the market has been the task of several oversight organizations.\n\n\"We're currently vetting their license,\" Mr. Schulman said of Third Generation Seafood. \"The family connections raise a flag. We have an interest in these guys.\"\n\nThe younger Romano is also seen in New Bedford often, according to waterfront sources.\n\nContacted earlier this spring, Mr. Romano declined to talk about his past legal troubles. And he had little say about the RICO case against his waterfront neighbor, Timothy Mello.\n\nHe said he had no relationship with Mr. Mello.\n\n\"I know who he is, from the waterfront, but I have nothing to do with him,\" he said. \"There is no relationship.\"\n\nAccording to police sources, the two men -- the aging Mafioso and area's de facto crime boss --have met at least twice in recent years. And Massachusetts State Police said they have phone records showing telephone contact between the two here and in New York over the years.\n\nAnd there are certain similarities between the two.\n\nAmong the charges facing Timothy Mello and his co-defendants are allegations the one-time Mafia enforcer used textbook style extortion tactics to gain a foothold in legitimate fishing businesses.\n\nMr. Mello parlayed a $50,000 debt owed him by a gambling fish house owner into an interest in the house.\n\nIn the end, according to federal documents, he beat the former owner in 1995, smashed his car windows with a baseball bat and threatened to kill him. The former owner never returned, and Mr. Mello became a \"legitimate\" fish dealer.\n\nAt a March bail hearing, three waterfront workers Mr. Mello is alleged to have intimidated sat ashen faced, eyes in their laps, and answered questions from Mr. Mello's attorney.\n\nNo, they said, we're not afraid of Timmy Mello.\n\nThe judge, in her ruling denying Mr. Mello's bail, said the courtroom testimony -- which contradicted their previous grand jury statements -- only underscored how afraid the men were of Mr. Mello.\n\nOne of a blizzard of letters from businessmen and friends supporting Mr. Mello's unsuccessful quest for bail last year came from the manager of Inter-City Fish, the old Rugnetta family business, now relocated to Long Island.\n\nThe government has been able to keep Mr. Mello imprisoned pending trial -- as they did in Mr. Romano's case -- in part, by linking Mr. Mello to a parade of criminal characters, including Mafia heavyweights.\n\nBut while Mr. Mello is being painted as a violent career criminal who consorted with organized crime players, Mr. Romano, with his bona fide Mafia credentials is in a different criminal class altogether.\n\n\"Forget about Timmy Mello,\" said one veteran State Police detective now assigned to New Bedford. \"Carmine Romano is the only made guy around here.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Lt. Timothy Alben gave a lecture at a law enforcement conference at Roger Williams College in Rhode Island.\n\nA member of the Massachusetts State Police' Special Services Unit that tracks organized crime, Mr. Alben is one of the regional experts on the Genovese family.\n\nIn his lecture, he traced the Genovese presence outside New York -- in New Jersey, in Florida, in Springfield, Mass., and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd in New Bedford.\n\nMr. Romano's presence has not gone unnoticed, according to Lt. Alben.\n\n\"We think people in your area in law enforcement should at least know he's there,\" he said.\n\nLt. Alben said it would not be unheard of if the 67-year-old soldier is \"retired.\"\n\n\"We just don't know,\" he said.\n\nMr. Romano said that his past is just that -- in the past.\n\nTwenty years later, he still echoes the denials that his defense put up at his trial.\n\n\"If you know anything about the U.S. government then you know they're full of b.s.,\" he said this spring. \"Everybody's a made guy. Everybody's a capo to these guys. It's b.s.\"\n\nThis story appeared on Page A1 of The Standard-Times on September 21, 2003."
