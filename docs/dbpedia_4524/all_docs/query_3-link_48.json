She obtained her N.Y. Real Estate License, started a family, and pursued her passion for wine & food on a professional level. She transitioned to leadership roles within the upstate NY & Finger Lakes wine & beverage industry and earned her Level 2 Diploma through the Wine & Spirits Education Trust. She eventually gravitated towards beverage education and found her own niche teaching craft cocktail classes.\n\nTina and her family always vacationed in Rehoboth Beach until an opportunity arose to make their coastal lifestyle daydreams a reality. They took the plunge and fully relocated in 2020. Tina was thrilled to join the Bryce Lingo & Shaun Tull team as their Settlement Coordinator shortly after. She has since obtained her DE Real Estate License and loves living and working “at the beach!” Tina lives in Lewes with her husband Dante, and daughters, Gabriella & Valentina. Tina still dabbles in Beverage Education and spends a lot of late nights in her kitchen on various culinary endeavors, hence her nickname “The Midnight Baker.”"
