        "text": "An investigation into New York's Gambino crime family has led federal agents and the NYPD to a pair of upstate horse farms about 60 miles away from New York City, sources tell FOX 5 NY.\n\nThe FBI confirmed that law enforcement activities were performed at two locations in Orange County: one on Hampton Road in Goshen and the other on Hamptonburgh Road in Campbell Hall.\n\nLaw enforcement would not confirm what led agents to these locations.\n\nLast week, ten alleged members and associates of the Gambino crime family were charged with using violence and extortion to try to dominate New York's garbage carting and demolition industries, authorities announced.\n\nThe racketeering indictment accuses the men of crimes such as assaulting a demolition company employee with a hammer and setting fire to the steps of a trash carting business owner's house.\n\nThe defendants include Joseph Lanni, who prosecutors said was also known as \"Joe Brooklyn\" and \"Mommino,\" an alleged captain in the Gambino family, and nine alleged Gambino soldiers and associates. Lanni's attorney, Frederick Sosinsky, said his client was innocent and would mount a \"vigorous challenge\" to the charges.\n\nIt is unclear if the recent arrests are connected to the law enforcement activity in Orange County."
