In news coverage of his death, it's reported that Rosario was born in June 1886 in Palermo.[2] There is no corresponding birth on that date.[3]\n\nEarly Family Life and Immigration\n\nRosario immigrates around 1893-95.[2][4] New of his death reports that he is survived by two sisters, Frances Gambino and Mrs. Annie Crocilla, and a brother, Gaspare, all of Brooklyn.[2]\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nRosario marries Angelina Lima, daughter of Natale and Domenica Lima, on 23 July 1906 in Manhattan. Rosario is 21 (b. 1885) and Angelina is 19 (b. 1887), both born in Italy.[5]\n\nAngelina and Rosario have ten children: Mamie (1908), Peter (c. 1910), Frances, (c. 1912) Natale/Nathan (c. 1914), Mary (c. 1916), Andrew/Andy, (1918) Salvatore (c. 1920), Joseph (c. 1922-3), Frank (1926), and James/Jimmy (1927).[6][7]\n\nReporting on his death tells us that Rosario lived in Brooklyn, Kansas City, Omaha, and New Orleans.\n\nMamie and Peter were born in Missouri, according to the 1920 census. (1908-10) In a 1940 census, Mamie says she was born in Kansas. According to the record of her death, Mamie is born 28 October 1908.[8]\n\nFrances was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1912.\n\nNathan was born in Nebraska in 1914.\n\nIt's reported at the time of his death that Rosario first moved to Utica around 1916, and returned to Brooklyn for two years.\n\nMary and Andrew were born in New York. (1916-18)\n\nRosario registers for the draft for WWI from Brooklyn, NY. He lives at 169 Hamilton, Brooklyn. Rosario only gives the year, 1885, for his date of birth. He is 33 and works as a longshoreman, employed by J. M. Brady, Pier 57, NYC. Angelina is his contact person at the same home address.The registrar reports on 12 September 1918 that Rosario is of medium height and build with brown eyes and black hair.[9]\n\nAndrew is born in Brooklyn on 19 January 1918.[10]\n\nIn the 1920 census of Brooklyn, taken 12 January, Rosario Gambino heads a household at 21 Huntington St. He is 35 (b. 1884) and his wife, Angelina, is 26 (b. 1893). Their children at home are Mamie, 11 (b. 1908), Peter, 9 (b. 1910), Frances, 7 (b. 1912), Nathan, 5 (b. 1914), Mary, 3 years and 10 months (b. Mar 1916), Andrew, 1 year and 11 months (b. Feb 1918), and Rosario’s brother, Gaspar, 33 (b. 1886). Rosario and Gaspare both immigrated from Italy in 1895, and Angelina in 1905. Mamie and Peter were born in Missouri. Frances was born in Louisiana. Nathan was born in Nebraska. Mary and Andrew were born in New York. Rosario and Gaspare are both longshoremen for a steamship company.[4]\n\nAngelina and her husband and children move to Utica, New York, soon after[2], joining her maternal uncle Pietro Lima[6] and his family.\n\nOn 1 August 1924, Pietro and Rosario are arrested together in Massena, New York, which is north of Utica, near the Canadian border. The men are found in a car that is carrying 13 cases of Canadian ale during Prohibition. They are convicted the following spring on three counts of violating the Volstead Act.[11][12] They are sentenced to a year and a day in Atlanta Penitentiary and fined $1,000 each. The conviction is later overturned.[6]\n\nNews of the conviction appears in local papers on 26 May 1925, a Tuesday. The following Sunday night, there is an explosion and fire at the Gambino home, at 1075 Tilden Av. in Utica. Rosario is questioned by police and released. He claims to have been in Amsterdam, New York (east of Utica, near Albany), at the time.\n\nFrank is born 24 February 1926.[13]\n\nA son, James, is born to Rosario and Angelina Gambino, 1024 Tilden Av., on 22 April 1927.[14]\n\nAt the end of the year, it's reported that the 1925 conviction for bootlegging is overturned because the car was searched without a warrant.[15][16] The local paper calls their case \"sensational\"[17] and \"one of the most unusual 'right of search and seizure' cases in the history of the Federal Court.\"[6]\n\nOn 26 September 1928, an argument between Joseph Lima, who is Pietro's son, and his wife, Nellie, escalates into a shootout in Rosario and Angelina's driveway.[6]\n\nAfter quarrelling, Nellie leaves her home and goes to the home of Angelina and Rosario. Around ten o'clock in the evening, Joseph and his father, who have both been drinking, a brother, and a brother-in-law, all converge on the Gambino home to take Nellie home. She refuses, and Rosario backs her up, saying she can stay all night if she likes. The younger men leave, and Pietro stays, hurling insults from the end of the driveway.[2]\n\nRosario goes outside with his son, Peter, and tells Lima to leave their property. He then tells his son to take the family car into the driveway. As Peter is obeying the order, he sees Pietro Lima reach for a gun. The boy leaps in front of his father to protect him, and is shot in the chest. Peter staggers off, and Pietro fires again at Rosario. Rosario returns fire, striking Pietro twice, in the leg and the groin.[2]\n\nPietro, 55 (b. 1873), Rosario, 42 (b. 1886), and Rosario and Angelina's 18 year old son, Peter, are shot in the exchange. All three are operated upon at a local hospital. Rosario is shot through the stomach, and Peter is struck in the collarbone. Rosario's injuries are considered the most serious of the three.[6]\n\nPietro's son Salvatore Lima, who is also called Charlie, and Lawrence Diecglio (called \"Di Giglio\" in this reporting), Pietro's son-in-law, who had accompanied Joseph previously to the Gambino home, return and take Rosario to the hospital. The two other wounded men take off together on foot to find a doctor. Police later follow their trail of blood two blocks to the corner of Rutger and Tilden, where Pietro collapses. An ambulance is called from the nearby Jim's cafeteria.[2]\n\nWhen police arrive at the Gambino home, Angelina and her daughters refuse to admit them. Police break down the door and search the home, finding two \"hastily hidden\" revolvers and empty shells.[6]\n\nJoseph Lima arrives as police are forcing entry to Angelina and Rosario's house, and demands to know what is going on. He claims to be there visiting his wife, who has been ill.[6]\n\nThis story appears on the Mafia Genealogy website.\n\nDeath of Rosario\n\nRosario dies the following day from his injuries. He is 42 years old. It's reported that he was recently a truck driver and chauffeur, and had previously operated a gas station in Utica for about a year.[2]\n\nRosario is buried on the first of October. The following day, it's reported that Peter is continuing to improve in the hospital, and is not yet aware of his father's death.[18] He is told that day.[19]\n\nPietro Lima, recovering in the same hospital as Peter Gambino, is charged with murder in the first degree[20]. Peter is the only eyewitness to his father's shooting.[19]\n\nPeter told police at the time of the shooting that it was his own father who shot him. This is confirmed when the weapons are both recovered: Rosario's from a warming oven in the Gambino kitchen, and Lima's from a catch basin near the corner where he collapsed.[21]\n\nRosario's estate sues Pietro Lima for $50,000[20], yet in August 1929, Angelina pleads with the court for leniency in sentencing Lima. He is fined $1,000 for carrying a revolver without a permit. A prison sentence of 2.5-5 years in Auburn is suspended. Pietro pleads guilty to the permit charge with the understanding that charges from a second indictment, for first degree manslaughter, would not be pressed.[22]\n\nAndrew marries Beatrice Romano on 8 March 1936.[10]\n\nPeter is indicted for rape later that year.[23] He is later convicted. He's charged with petty larceny in 1939 and sentenced to 10-20 years at Attica.[24]\n\nMamie marries Joseph Gelfuso.\n\nNathan (Natale) Gambino, 29, 429 Mary, Utica, dies in the hospital on 17 May 1943 after a fight in Charlotte St near Davereux.[7]\n\nAngelina dies in the hospital on 22 November 1962 at age 70. Her last address is 717 Rutger St. in Utica.[25]\n\nMamie dies at age 81 in October 1989.[8]\n\nFrank dies in Utica on 9 February 2000 at age 74.[13]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Vol 191 No. 1092.
