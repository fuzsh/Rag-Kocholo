        "text": "Bonanno\n\nThe Bonanno crime family is one of the \"Five Families\" that controls organized crime activities in New York City, United States, within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the Mafia (or Cosa Nostra). Founded and named after Joseph Bonanno, this family was the first one of the New York families to be kicked off the Commission (the second was the Colombo crime family in the 1990s). The Commission is a council of the bosses that help to maintain order in the Mafia. The unacceptable infractions that lead to the family being kicked off was the allegation that the family was actively dealing heroin and the inner family fighting for control of leadership.\n\nThese were unacceptable crimes and the commission members decided to kick out the Bonanno family. Since then the family faced shaky leadership with acting boss Carmine Galante being murdered on the order of imprisoned boss Philip Rastelli. This family has suffered two major indignities. The first came in 1981 when they learned that an FBI agent calling himself Donnie Brasco had infiltrated their ranks. The second time was in 2004 when boss Joseph Massino, who previously brought the family back to respectable stature and back on the commission, became the first-ever Mafia boss in history to become an FBI informant.\n\nHistory\n\nSicilian origins\n\nThe origins of the Bonanno crime family can be traced back to the early 1880s in the town of Castellammare del Golfo located in the Province of Trapani, Sicily. During the 1900s, top members of the Bonanno, Bonventre, and Magaddino Mafia families relocated to New York, forming the Castellammarese clan due to their rivalry with Felice Buccellato, the boss of the Buccellato Mafia clan. The newly arriving Bonanno, Bonventre and Magaddino mafia members began establishing dominance and control in the Castellammarese community of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. While operating in Brooklyn, the Castellammarese leaders were able to preserve the criminal organization's future.\n\nCastellammarese War\n\nIn 1927 violence broke out between the two rival New York mafia factions and soon developed into a full out war known as the Castellammarese War. It all started when members of the Castellammarese Clan began hijacking truckloads of illegal liquor that belonged to Giuseppe \"Joe the Boss\" Masseria. The small Castellammarese Clan was based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and led by Nicola \"Cola\" Schiro who tried to work with Masseria. But one of the group's leaders Salvatore Maranzano wanted to take control over New York's underworld. Maranzano took control of the Castellammarese Clan continuing a bloody Mafia War.The Castellammarese faction was organized and more unified than Masseria family members were. Maranzano's powerful allies that supported him were fellow Castellammarese's, Buffalo family Boss Stefano Magaddino, Detroit family Boss Gaspar Milazzo and Philadelphia family Boss Salvatore Sabella. Maranzano's faction included powerful New York mobster Joseph Bonanno, Carmine Galante, Gaspar DiGregorio, and others. He also kept a close relationship with Joseph Profaci Boss of the New York Profaci family and a secret alliance with Bronx Reina family Boss Gaetano Reina. After Reina’s murder on February 26, 1930 more members of Masseria faction began to defect. By 1931, momentum had shifted in favor of Maranzano and his Castellammarese faction. Maranzano would receive help from Masseria faction defectors Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, Vito Genovese, Frank Costello, Reina family Boss Tommy Gagliano and Tommy Lucchese. Luciano, the leader of a group referred to as the \"Young Turks,\" wanted to end the war. He concluded a secret deal with Maranzano to have Masseria killed. On April 15, 1931 Masseria was murdered ending the long Castellammarese War.\n\nThe Commission\n\nAfter Masseria's murder, Maranzano became the new \"Boss of Bosses\" and outlined a peace plan to all the Sicilian and Italian Mafia leaders in the United States. There would be 24 organizations (to be known as \"families\") throughout the United States who would elect their own boss. In New York City, the five Mafia families were established and headed by Salvatore Maranzano, Lucky Luciano, Vincent Mangano, Tommy Gagliano and Joseph Profaci. Maranzano soon began planning to have Luciano killed, but before he had a chance he was murdered on September 10, 1931 by Jewish gangsters. Luciano instead of becoming the new \"Boss of Bosses\" removed the position and established The Commission to regulate the families' affairs. The Commission members included Luciano family Boss Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano who served as head of the Commission, Mangano family Boss Vincent Mangano, Gagliano family Boss Tommy Gagliano, Profaci family Boss Joseph Profaci, Chicago Outfit Boss Al \"Scarface\" Capone and Maranzano family (now Bonanno family) Boss Joseph Bonanno.\n\nThe Bonanno era\n\nJoseph Bonanno\n\nOne of the five branches established was headed up by Joseph \"Joe Bananas\" Bonanno, formed from part of the Maranzano Family. Bonanno was at the time the youngest of the bosses of the Five Families at 26 years-old. He directed the family into the popular organized crime dealings, involving gambling, loan-sharking, and racketeering. The Bonanno Family was considered the closest knit of the Five Families due to the fact that it was made up of mostly Sicilians from the seaside town where Bonanno was born – Castellamare del Golfo, Sicily. Bonanno strongly believed blood relations and a strict Sicilian upbringing would be the only way to hold the traditional values of the Mafia together. Bonanno's power was due to his close relationship with Joe Profaci. Profaci was head of the Profaci family one of the five families in New York City. The relationship between the two bosses became stronger when Bonanno's son Salvatore \"Bill\" Bonanno married Profaci's niece Rosalie in 1956. If any members of the other three families exercised thoughts of muscling in on Bonanno enterprises, the close ties to the Profaci family made them think twice. With the death of Joe Profaci in 1962 an alliance of Tommy Lucchese and Carlo Gambino threatened to undermine Bonanno's position.\n\nThe Bonanno War\n\nIn the early 1960s the Bonanno family went into a civil war. Called by the media as the \"Banana Split\" or \"Banana's war\". Many members in the Bonanno family were growing wary, complaining that boss Joseph \"Joe Bananas\" Bonanno was never around. Joe Bonanno was spending his time in second home in Tucson, Arizona. Eventually, the commission decided that he no longer deserved to be boss, naming Bonanno capo Gaspar DiGregorio as the new boss. DiGregorio was the brother-in-law to Joe Bonanno's cousin Stefano Magaddino.\n\nThe family split into two factions the DiGregorio supporters and the Bonanno loyalists. The Bonanno loyalists were led by his brother-in-law Frank Labruzzo and Bonanno's son Bill. There had been no violence from either side until the 1966 Brooklyn sit-down. DiGregorio's men arrived at the meeting, and when Bill Bonanno arrived a large gun battle ensued. The DiGregorio's loyalists planned to wipe out the opposition but they failed and no one was killed. Further peace offers from both sides were spurned with the ongoing violence and murders. The Commission grew tired of the affair and replaced DiGregorio with Paul Sciacca, but the fighting carried on regardless.\n\nThe war was finally brought to a close with Joe Bonanno, still in hiding, suffering a heart attack and announcing his permanent retirement in 1968 (he went on to live to the age of 97, dying in Tucson, Arizona in 2002). Both factions came together under Sciacca's leadership. His replacement was Natale \"Joe Diamonds\" Evola as boss of the Bonanno family. Evola leadership was short lived - his death (from natural causes) in 1973 brought Phillip \"Rusty\" Rastelli to the throne.\n\nRastelli regime\n\nPhilip Rastelli\n\nDue to the infighting of the Bonanno family, they were spurned by the other families and stripped of their Commission seat. Rastelli took charge of a seemingly hapless, doomed organization. Rastelli's former friend Carmine Galante became a powerful and dangerous renegade.\n\nHaving previously acted as a focal point for the importation of heroin to the USA via Montreal, Galante set about refining the family's drug trafficking operations. The incredibly lucrative deals he was able to make made the family a fortune, but with the other four families being kept out of the arrangements, Galante was making a rod for his own back.\n\nWhen eight members of the Genovese family were murdered on Galante's orders for trying to muscle in on his drug operation, the other families decided he had outlived his usefulness at the head of the Bonanno family. On July 12, 1979, Galante was shot dead by three men, at a restaurant in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn.\n\nRastelli took over once again, but the family's internal strife was far from over. Three renegade capos - Phillip Giaccone, Alphonse \"Sonny Red\" Indelicato and Dominick \"Big Trin\" Trinchera - began to openly question Rastelli's leadership and apparently to plot to overthrow him. With the blessing of the other families, Rastelli had the three men wiped out in a hit arranged by then-current Underboss Dominick \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano, as well as the future Boss Joseph \"Big Joe\" Massino.\n\nDonnie Brasco\n\nTwo of the men involved in the murder of the three rogue capos were Benjamin \"Lefty Guns\" Ruggiero and his capo Dominick \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano. Ruggiero had an associate, Donnie Brasco, whom he proposed for full family membership. In reality, Brasco was undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, conducting what would become a six-year infiltration of the family.\n\nPistone's undercover work led to numerous charges against the Bonanno family. Both Ruggiero and Rastelli received lengthy sentences. On August 17, 1981, Napolitano was shot and killed in a basement by Ronald Filocomo and Frank \"Curly\" Lino as punishment for admitting Pistone to his crew. Anthony Mirra, the man who brought Pistone to the family was also killed.\n\nAfter the Donnie Brasco affair, the Mafia Commission removed the Bonanno family from the panel. However, when the federal government pressed charges against the New York Cosa Nostra leaderhsip in the Mafia Commission Trial, the Bonnanos avoided indictment. As a result, the Bonnano family was able to keep its leadership intact and build up its power again.\n\nUnder Massino's command\n\nRastelli's death in 1991, following a period in which he ruled the family from inside prison, saw the promotion of Massino to the top spot. Finally, the family had found a man who could reverse its fortunes. By promoting a far more secretive way of doing business, Massino not only concentrated on the narcotics trade as had become mandatory for a mob boss, but also in other areas less likely to draw the attention of the authorities than drugs, such as the Mafia's stock trades of racketeering, money laundering and loan sharking. A close friend of Massino's, and boss of the Gambino crime family, John Gotti, also helped to get the Bonannos a seat on \"The Commission\" again. The family regrouped while the other families were finding their bosses targeted by the police for drug offenses.\n\nMassino turns informant\n\nMassino managed to keep his nose clean until the killing of Napolitano came back to haunt him. He and his underboss, Salvatore Vitale, were charged with the crime in 2003 after two of their capos turned themselves over as witnesses for the government. Vitale, who had until that point been utterly loyal to his boss, also faced a further murder charge and decided to switch sides himself, condemning Massino to life imprisonment. Capital punishment had been a possibility for Massino, but in 2004 he became the first serving boss to turn informant, sparing himself the ultimate penalty.\n\nMassino is believed to be the man who pointed the FBI towards a spot in Ozone Park, Queens, called \"The Hole\", where the body of Alphonse Indelicato had been found in 1981. Told to dig a little deeper, authorities duly uncovered the remains of Dominick Trinchera and Philip Giaccone, as well as a body suspected to be that of John Favara, a neighbor of Gambino family boss John Gotti who had killed the mobster's son in a car/bicycle accident, and paid with his life.\n\nFormer Boss Joseph Massino is also believed to have provided the police with information on a number of high ranking Bonanno Family members and former acting boss Vincent Basciano, whose conversations with Massino were taped in late 2004 and early 2005 by the turncoat himself. Before Massino became an informant himself, his acting boss on the outside was Anthony \"Tony Green\" Urso, but his tenure was short-lived as he too was imprisoned on numerous charges, leading to Basciano taking control. Vincent Basciano's term as acting boss was hampered with his arrest in late 2004, but with Massino's eventual betrayal, authorities claim that Basciano assumed the top position in 2005, is allegedly the current Boss and leading the broken Bonanno family from his prison cell.\n\nThe authorities continue to plague the family, with the February 16, 2006 arrest of acting boss Michael Mancuso on murder charges, while alleged Boss Vincent Basciano was recently convicted on charges of conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, and illegal gambling and was sentenced to life imprisonment in late 2007. The main charge against him was that he conspired to murder both the judge and prosecutor in the case, as well as Patrick DeFilippo, a fellow Bonanno crime family captain.\n\nBasciano's leadership\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities have recently claimed in a New York Daily News column that current Bonanno Family Boss Vincent Basciano has named Brooklyn business owner Salvatore \"Sal the Ironworker\" Montagna, age 35 of Elmont, Long Island as the new \"acting boss\" of the Bonanno Family. Sal Montagna was an unknown soldier in the Bronx crew of capo Patrick \"Patty from the Bronx\" DeFilippo and became acting capo of the crew upon DeFilippo's 2003 arrest on murder and racketeering charges. Law enforcement sources have stated that Salvatore Montagna was tabbed as \"acting boss\" with Vincent Basciano's consent to maintain the Bonanno Family's base of power within the Bronx faction of the Bonanno crime family. The Bonanno family's base of power was traditionally held by the Brooklyn faction from the time of Family patriarch Joseph Bonanno until the eventual rise of Queens faction leader Philip \"Rusty\" Rastelli in the early 1970s. The ascension of the Bronx faction began with Basciano's promotion to acting boss, eventual ascension to the top position of Boss, continued through Michael Mancuso's short tenure and now remains with Sal Montagna acting on behalf of Basciano. The newly alleged acting boss is sometimes referred to as \"Sal the Zip\" being that he is from Joseph Bonanno's hometown of Castellammare del Golfo, is closely associated with the Family's Sicilian faction and fellow Castellammarese, Baldo Amato who is currently in prison and former Bonanno Capo Cesare Bonventre who was murdered in 1984.\"\n\nIn July 2004, The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors in Brooklyn \"say that overall, in the last four years, they have won convictions against roughly 75 mobsters or associates in a crime clan with fewer than 150 made members.\" Several top Bonanno family members including two former acting bosses and the current Boss Vincent Basciano have been indicted and convicted recently, reinforcing the government's claim of victory over the Bonanno family and New York's La Cosa Nostra. In February 2005, Bonanno family Capo Anthony \"Tony Green\" Urso pled guilty to racketeering, murder, gambling, loan sharking and extortion charges, while Capo Joseph \"Joe Saunders\" Cammarano, along with soldier Louis Restivo pled guilty to murder and racketeering charges.\"\n\nTwelve Bonanno family member and associates, seven over the age 70, including acting consigliere Anthony \"Mr. Fish\" Rabito and respected soldier Salvatore Scudiero were indicted and arrested on June 14, 2005 on charges of operating a $10 million a year gambling ring.\" The most recent blow to the Family came with the September 20, 2006 sentencing of capos Louis \"Louie Ha Ha\" Attanasio and Peter Calabrese to 15 years in prison for the 1984 murder of capo Cesare Bonventre in Queens.\n\nThe defection of former Bonanno family Bosses Joseph Massino and Salvatore Vitale, along with four high ranking former Capos, has caused the Bonanno family to lose power, influence and respect within the New York underworld to a degree not seen since the Donnie Brasco incident. With the upcoming trial of Capos Michael \"Mikey Nose\" Mancuso and Patrick \"Patty from the Bronx\" DeFilippo on murder, gambling and racketeering charges, the ability of the Bronx faction to stay in control of the crime family will be determined along with the Bonanno family's future position in North America's underworld. Basciano is still the alleged \"Boss\" of the Bonannos, with, from late 2006, Salvatore Montagna as \"acting boss\", following orders from the imprisoned Basciano. With Nicholas \"Nicky Mouth\" Santora as \"acting underboss\" for the imprisoned Michael Mancuso, and Anthony Rabito as the alleged consigliere, Montagna is capable to run the day-to-day operations on behalf of Vincent Basciano.\n\nA March 2009 article in the New York Post stated that Salvatore \"Sal the Iron Worker\" Montagna is the acting boss of the Bonanno crime family. The article also stated that the Bonanno family current consists of approximately 115 \"made\" members.Montagna was later deported to Canada in April 2009 leaving the family to create a ruling panel until a new boss was chosen.\n\nCurrent position of the family\n\nUnder the rule of former Boss Joseph Massino, the Bonanno family climbed back to the top of New York's crime family hierarchy and once again became a top power in America's underworld, but high level defections and convictions have left the family a shell of its former self once more during its long criminal history. Vincent Basciano is serving a prison sentence for racketeering and Salvatore Montagna has been deported to Canada. Both were appointed acting bosses during Massino's imprisonment and after Massino's defection to the FBI.\n\nOn January 11, 2010 Jerry Capeci quoted sources as saying that Nicholas Santora and Anthony Rabito, who were both released from prison in 2009 and are still unable to meet freely with their fellow wiseguys, are supporting capo Vincent Asaro to become the new boss of the family. Asaro also has close ties to Queens-based mobsters from the Lucchese, Gambino and Genovese families who have voiced their support for him, sources say. A key player in the recent talks is Vito Grimaldi, who is viewed as an adviser to the Zips (Sicilian mobsters in the United States).\n\nCapeci's sources say Asaro, who for many years has had dealings as both a mob supervisor and cohort of Sicilian wiseguys, may win Grimaldi's support.Another candidate with key Sicilian backing is Vincent Badalamenti. Due to Joseph Massino deciding to cooperate with the FBI, both sides agree that the family will no longer take orders from the man he previously appointed acting boss, Vincent Basciano. \"[Joseph Massino's] word don't count any more,\" said one source, adding that even if his words still had clout, it made no sense.\n\nHistorical leadership of the Bonanno family\n\nBosses (official and acting)\n\nBoss Don/Godfather. The boss is the head of the family, no one can override his decisions. Only the boss and underboss can initiate an associate into the family, allowing them to become a made man. The boss gives the family oath to new members and make them sgarrista (soldiers). The boss also has the authority to give people their positions and ranks. The boss usually reigns as a dictator (until somebody deposes him).\n\n* 1890s–1901 — Giuseppe \"Don Peppino\" Bonanno (older brother to Salvatore and Stefano Bonanno and uncle to Joseph \"Joe Bananas\" Bonanno.
