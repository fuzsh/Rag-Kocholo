        "text": "SCHENECTADY, NY—Congressman Paul D. Tonko celebrated alongside local leaders and Hometown Health Centers staff $4 million in federal funding for Hometown Health, allocated through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). The funding, approved by the Schenectady County Legislature, will support the creation of a new dental clinic.\n\nTonko visited the site designated for this new facility in March this year to herald $750,000 he secured for Hometown Health through the Community Project Funding process. The new dental clinic is critical in maintaining Hometown Health’s stellar service to the region, especially following last year’s closing of Ellis Hospital’s dental clinic, which has led Hometown Health to nearly double the number of Capital Region patients they serve.\n\n“Last year, when families throughout our Capital Region were struggling to weather the storm of the COVID-19 pandemic, I took action alongside my colleagues to deliver for the American people,” Congressman Tonko said. “I’m delighted to see these federal funds making a difference right here in our community, and to see how they will support Hometown Health’s incredible work to deliver care and improve the lives of residents. I look forward to continuing to partner with our local advocates and leaders in my ongoing effort to deliver federal resources that build healthier communities and make our Capital Region a better place.”\n\n“Hometown is so fortunate to have partners like Congressman Paul Tonko and our distinguished leaders in the county legislature,” said Joe Gambino, CEO at Hometown Health Centers. “Children and families will benefit from this project for generations to come.”\n\n“The County Legislature is proud to partner with Hometown Health and Congressman Tonko to help fill the critical need for dental services in our community,” said Anthony Jasenski, Chair of the Schenectady County Legislature. “We thank Hometown for stepping in to provide services to 9,000 additional patients when Ellis closed their dental program last year. This $4 million investment will allow Hometown to consolidate their 2 dental clinics into one modern facility where they can continue to provide these vital services to our community.”\n\nPhotos of the Congressman’s visit can be found HERE, HERE, and HERE.\n\n###"
