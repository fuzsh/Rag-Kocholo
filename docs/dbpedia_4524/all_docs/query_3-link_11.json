A third agent is seen using their hands seemingly to dig. News 12 has confirmed with a federal law enforcement source that the law enforcement activity in Orange County is tied to investigations into the Gambino crime family.\n\nChopper 12 was overhead on Wednesday while the FBI and NYPD were present in Goshen. An excavator was seen digging in one of the horse fields off Hampton Road.\n\nAuthorities left the New Hampton farm on Tuesday and were no longer seen at the Goshen farm as of Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to county property records, the owners of both properties have ties to an upscale home on Celano Lane in West Islip, Long Island.\n\nDrone video of the farm.\n\nTen alleged Gambino mafioso were indicted on a slew of charges by the feds last week for alleged violent attempts to take over the New York City garbage hauling and demolition industry, according to court documents.\n\nAuthorities say the defendants could face 20 to 180 years in prison each for a laundry list of crimes, including racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, witness retaliation, fraud and embezzlement.\n\nIt’s still unclear what authorities were looking for in Orange County or if they found anything.\n\nMORE:"
