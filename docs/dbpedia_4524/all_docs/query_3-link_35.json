        "text": "Bolstered by ARPA Federal Funding, New State-of-the-Art Facility Expands Capacity, Becomes Sole Medicaid-Accepting Clinic Offering Comprehensive Oral Surgery Services in the Capital Region\n\nThe Schenectady County Legislature and Hometown Health Centers (HHC), along with Congressman Tonko, announced the official opening of Hometown Health’s new dental clinic, located at 1108 State Street in Schenectady. The 12,500-square-foot facility will serve medically underserved residents from Schenectady and surrounding counties. The clinic features 30 exam rooms and the latest digital technology, and will offer general dentistry, preventative and pediatric care, oral surgery, and emergency appointments.\n\n\"Hometown Health plays a vital role in our community, offering essential healthcare and dental services to those who might otherwise go without,” said Gary Hughes, Chair of the Schenectady County Legislature. “The County Legislature takes pride in supporting the creation of this cutting-edge facility, contributing $4 million in ARPA funding to bridge the financial gap and bring this project to life. Beyond its increased capacity and comprehensive services, the clinic is a lifeline for dental patients on Medicaid, the uninsured, and the underinsured, addressing a critical need for those who find themselves with no other options. We look forward to our continued partnership with Hometown Health to ensure that the residents of Schenectady County can access the health and dental services they need and deserve.\"\n\nIn 2021, when Ellis Medicine shuttered its dental clinic and dental residency program in Schenectady, Hometown Health stepped up to absorb nearly 9,000 patients previously served through Ellis. Later that year HHC purchased the former Rite Aid at the corner of State and Brandywine when it became clear that they would need a new facility to better serve their dental patients. The new dental clinic combines the two smaller offices they previously used into one modern facility that is expected to treat approximately 14,000 patients each year.\n\n“For too long we watched people in our community suffer because of a serious lack of access to dental services,” said Joe Gambino, CEO at Hometown Health Centers. “Opening this beautiful new dental practice is the first step toward ending this needless misery.”"
