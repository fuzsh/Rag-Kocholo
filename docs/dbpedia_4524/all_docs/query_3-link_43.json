        "text": "By the City of Hutchinson Fire Department\n\nHUTCHINSON, Kan. — On August 6, 2024, the Hutchinson Fire Department (HFD) responded to 2404 E 4th Avenue for the report of a commercial building fire. During the response, dispatch advised bystanders were reporting large amounts of smoke and fire. Crews were able to see a large glow and smoke plumb while leaving the station. The first arriving crew found heavy fire and initiated defensive fire operations. The assignment was immediately upgraded to request mutual aid from multiple agencies. Firefighters encountered numerous hazards while fighting the fire that included down charged power lines, numerous explosions, and high heat. Due to the extensive heat, crews were presented with additional building fires to the surrounding structures that required attention to minimize surrounding structure damage.\n\nHFD implemented rigorous on scene rehabilitation procedures to ensure all members were staying hydrated, checked their vital signs, and were able to continue fire suppression efforts. Due to the heat and environmental conditions, two (2) firefighters were hospitalized. They have since been released and cleared for duty.\n\nDuring the fire, HFD was flowing approximately 7,000 gallons of water per minute. The fire required the use of ten (10) Engines and two (2) Ladder Trucks to sustain suppression efforts. The fire took three (3) hours to bring under control, concluded with three (3) hours of investigation by HFD, HPD, Reno County Sherriff, and the State Fire Marshal. The fire continues to be under investigation pending further interviews. It is currently undetermined when the cause of the fire will be released. HFD will notify if a cause is determined.\n\nThe Hutchinson Fire Department would like to thank the following for their assistance with this incident:\n\nReno County Emergency Communications\n\nReno County Emergency Management\n\nBuhler Fire Department\n\nSouth Hutchinson Fire Department\n\nPretty Prairie Fire Department\n\nFire District #3\n\nFire District #8\n\nNewton Fire Department\n\nMcPherson Fire Department\n\nColwich Fire Department\n\nHutchinson Police Department\n\nReno County EMS\n\nReno County Sherrif’s Office\n\nState Fire Marshal’s Office\n\nEvergy\n\nKansas Gas\n\nBridgman Oil\n\nCity of Hutchinson Public Works\n\nCity of Hutchinson Water Department\n\nCity of Hutchinson Fleet Maintenance\n\nCity of Hutchinson Public Communications\n\nCity of Hutchinson IT\n\nIn addition, HFD would also like to send a big Thank You to Gambino’s for donating food for all on scene personnel, which was sixty (60) people at the time of the fire.\n\nAnd the fire department would like to thank Evergy for the use of the F500 Encapsulator Foam Trailer that Colwich brought. This assisted the department in the extinguishment of the large fuel load."
