        "text": "The photograph taken backstage at the Westchester Premier Theater in Greenburgh four decades ago shows one of history's most famous faces — and one of its most infamous.\n\nShot following a performance by Frank Sinatra on April 11,1976, the photo shows Ol' Blue Eyes with legendary crime boss Carlo Gambino, his successor as Gambino family boss Paul Castellano, mobster Jimmy \"The Weasel\" Fratianno, and a host of other \"wiseguys.\"\n\nIt was a landmark moment in the Lower Hudson Valley's brush with La Cosa Nostra.\n\nThe theater may be long gone today, but an indictment unsealed Monday detailing a New Rochelle loansharking and gambling operation allegedly run by the Lucchese crime family suggests the Mafia remains very much alive in the region.\n\nFrom the secret tunnels built by legendary gangster Dutch Schultz near his Tuckahoe home during prohibition, to the mob-run gambling operation known as \"the Yonkers Club\" until two years ago, mobsters have been part of the area's fabric for decades.\n\n“It was part of the gentrification of the suburbs,” said Roy Pollitt, a former FBI agent who spent 17 years investigating organized crime before leaving the bureau in 2013. “They had their criminal operations in the five boroughs but they also began looking into areas near where they lived.”\n\nPasta Per Voi Restaurant in Port Chester was once a favored hangout for reputed Gambino family capo Gregory DePalma. Other local eateries were also on the short list of hot spots for mobsters: La Villetta in Larchmont, Ye Olde Tollgate Steakhouse in Mamaroneck, and Spaghetti Western in Bronxville.\n\nAnd they have often been placed in handcuffs here, most recently during this week's Lucchese indictment by the state Attorney General's Office.\n\nSimilar cases have been less frequent in recent years, as organized crime enterprises have been increasingly weakened by state and federal investigations and arrests.\n\nPollit, whose last seven years in the FBI were in White Plains, said mob families have also branched out into new schemes like stock fraud, even if they typically fall back on traditional endeavors like bookmaking spilling into loansharking.\n\n“That is their bread and butter and always has been,” he said.\n\nPollit said federal prosecutors have also devoted more resources to another criminal target, increasing anti-terrorism efforts since the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nBut make no mistake: Local history is replete with mobsters living and doing business in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties.\n\nMobbed up\n\nPeter Pace, a reputed Genovese crime family associate from Patterson, once boasted on a federal wiretap that he settled a family dispute in 1988 by dangling his mother-in-law from the roof of a six-story apartment building in the Bronx.\n\nIn 1991, authorities had to shut down streets within a three-block radius of the old federal courthouse on Post Road in White Plains so that burly mob turncoat Peter Chiodo could testify against Peter Gotti and other mob bosses.\n\nChiodo took the stand after surviving 12 shots from mob hit men, a feat authorities credited in part to his hefty 400-pound girth.\n\nIn Westchester, mob control of the garbage-hauling industry was once big business for organized crime, dating to the 1940s under the tutelage of Nicholas \"Cockeyed Nick\" Rattenni of Armonk. A 1986 report by the state Assembly determined that mob-run companies controlled two-thirds of the hauling business in the county.\n\nThe Yonkers waterfront was another focus of investigators in the 1980s.\n\nCourt documents revealed that former Genovese crime boss Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante was forced to intervene in a feud between crime-family factions to take control of the city's then-undeveloped Hudson River waterfront.\n\nGigante reportedly resolved the dispute by ordering a payment of $400,000 to reputed Rockland County gangster Daniel Pagano so he would surrender his claim on the land.\n\nFederal investigators said wiretaps and confidential informants suggested that Lucchese capo Steven Crea Sr., a former Pelham and Tuckhoe resident, ultimately wrested control of the property from Melvin Weintraub, the developer designated by the city to begin the redevelopment of the waterfront.\n\nCrea and reputed Genovese crime family captain Vincent DiNapoli were also linked to bribes tied to a construction project in northeast Yonkers, according to a report released at the time by state Organized Crime Task Force Investigator Joe Coffey.\n\nCoffey was the celebrity New York City police detective who commanded the squad that arrested Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz in Yonkers in 1977.\n\nRepeatedly jailed, Crea, named as part of a new federal indictment last year, has long been considered the last remaining major mob boss in the Lower Hudson Valley.\n\nTanglewood Boys\n\nOne of Westchester's most notorious gangs was the Tanglewood Boys.\n\nThe Yonkers gang, named for a strip mall in the city in the early 1990s, included the sons of established mobsters, primarily in the Lucchese family, and came to be seen as a virtual farm system for the mob.\n\nIn December 2005 five members of the gang, which was waning in influence, were arrested after a shootout in the Bronx with state and county police.\n\nMichael “Chunk” Londonio, the gang's leader, was shot to death in the gunfight, but not before he wounded two state troopers. Both officers survived.\n\nAlthough defunct, a link to the Tanglewood Boys surfaced in this week's arrests.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the alleged head of the loansharking operation, Dominick Capelli, is a soldier in the Lucchese crew that was run by Salvatore DiSimone, a capo who died in October.\n\nDiSimone’s son, Anthony, was a member of the Tanglewood Boys. He fatally stabbed Louis Balancio outside a Yonkers bar in 1994 — a crime that became notorious not only because Balancio was the son of a city councilman but because dozens of witnesses refused to cooperate with authorities.\n\nAnthony DiSimone was initially found guilty of murder and served seven years in prison but the conviction was overturned because of evidence not turned over to the defense.\n\nDiSimone pleaded guilty to manslaughter in 2010 and did not have to serve any additional time.\n\nMob indictments\n\nThe Lucchese indictment unsealed this week is one of dozens targeting organized-crime figures in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam over the past four decades.\n\nMay 2017 — Six local men among 19 reputed Lucchese crime family members and associates named in a federal racketeering indictment. Among them is Steven Crea Sr., a reputed Lucchese underboss accused of conspiring in the 2013 Bronx gangland execution of notorious mobster Michael Meldish.\n\nAugust 2016 — A dozen locals among 46 alleged mobsters charged with racketeering and gambling. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said the suspects had ties to the Gambino, Genovese, Luchesse and Bonanno crime families, as well as organized-crime figures from Philadelphia. The mobsters reportedly ran a gambling operation known as the “Yonkers Club,” headed by Anthony “Anthony Boy” Zinzi, a mobster from the Bronx.\n\nJanuary 2011— Seven Lower Hudson Valley men were among 127 charged in a federal indictment unsealed in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Rhode Island and New Jersey that took down members of the Gambino, Genovese and Bonanno crime families, and the entire reputed leadership of the Colombo crime family. Among them was Bartolomeo \"Bobby Glasses\" Vernace of Suffern and John \"Johnny Pizza\" Porcello of Yonkers.\n\nApril 2006 — Two Westchester men among eight reputed mobsters who plead guilty in federal court. Joseph “Joey Per Voi” Fornino of Yonkers, owner of Pasta Per Voi Restaurant in Port Chester, pleaded guilty to charges that he helped run an illegal gambling operation out of the restaurant. The operation included high-stakes Super Bowl betting that took in as much as $2,000 per day for the Gambino crime family.\n\nMarch 2005 — Sixteen Lower Hudson Valley residents were among 32 alleged members and associates of the Gambino crime family charged in a federal indictment in in Manhattan. Fourteen were from Westchester County, one was from Tappan and one was from Mahopac, authorities said.\n\nDecember 2001 — Manhattan prosecutors charge 12 reputed Lucchese crime family members, including six from Westchester, with conspiracy, assault and racketeering. The arrests followed a 30-month investigation.\n\nA separate federal case ends with the arrests of 73 reputed Genovese crime family members and associates, including three accused capos. The indictments include charges of a pension embezzlement scheme tied to a Tuckahoe carpentry company. Among the charges are claims that Pasquale “Patsy” Parrello, a reputed capo named in one of the indictments, siphoned off more than $1 million in pension benefits from S&F Carpentry on Lake Avenue.\n\nSeptember 2000 — Four Lower Hudson Valley men were among 38 reputed mobsters charged in a racketeering and bid-rigging case. Steven Crea Sr., identified as the acting boss of the Lucchese crime family, is among those charged. The charges link the men to schemes targeting nearly a dozen construction projects in Westchester and New York City. Among the allegations was a charge that $50,000 was skimmed from an expansion project at the former Doral Arrowwood Conference Center in Rye Brook.\n\nJune 1996 — U.S. Attorney’s Office seizes $20 million in property belonging to three reputed Genovese family members in Westchester. Among the seized property was a 24-foot yacht and the sprawling Bedford estate of James “Little Jimmy” Ida, the reputed Genovese consiglieri. The three local men were among 19 men hit with a 60-count indictment, including the murder of two mobsters who were cooperating with authorities."
