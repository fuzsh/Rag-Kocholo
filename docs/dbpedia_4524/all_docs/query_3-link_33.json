        "text": "Andrew J. Maloney, the United States attorney in Brooklyn who shattered the myth of the Teflon Don with the successful prosecution of the flamboyant Mafia boss John J. Gotti, died on Monday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 90.\n\nHis son Andrew, also a former federal prosecutor, said the cause of death, at a hospital, was heart failure.\n\nMr. Maloney, a street-smart graduate of West Point and a college boxing champion, was the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, heading the Justice Department office responsible for Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island, from 1986 to 1992.\n\nEarly in 1992, in a rare step for a U.S. attorney in a big-city district, he participated in the trial that sent Mr. Gotti — the reputed boss of what was then the nation’s largest, most powerful Mafia group — to prison for murder and racketeering.\n\nMr. Gotti had gained the nickname the Teflon Don because the charges against him in three previous federal and state cases did not stick. One of those trials occurred in the Eastern District in 1986, shortly after Mr. Maloney took over the office, though the case had been prepared before he arrived.\n\nThe case assembled under Mr. Maloney dealt largely with Mr. Gotti’s crimes in taking over and running the Gambino family’s criminal operations. It benefited from taped conversations of Mr. Gotti from electronic bugs planted in and around his headquarters, and the decision by a top Gotti henchman, Salvatore Gravano, nicknamed Sammy the Bull, to testify for the prosecution.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
