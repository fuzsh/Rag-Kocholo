        "text": "Salvatore D’Aquila was the first recognized boss of what is now called the Gambino Family, leading a large Palermitani faction in New York City as they emigrated. Both Upper and Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx supported a large group of Palermo-bred and Palermo-oriented mafiosi. They would come into conflict with an accomplished mafioso from Lower Manhattan named Giuseppe (Joe the Boss) Masseria.\n\nD’Aquila and his followers would side with Maranzano, his Castellammare troops, and allied sympathizers. By 1931, Vincent Mangano would come to power. He would rule until his disappearance and murder in 1951. Albert Anastasia, a Calabrian and Mangano underboss, would rise to power and rule with an iron fist until his infamous execution in the barber’s chair in 1957, at which time Carlo Gambino came to power.\n\nA long period of stability and prosperity would be enjoyed by this Family for the next 18 years until Gambino’s death in 1975. Paul Castellano, Carlo’s cousin and brother-in-law, would be chosen to lead. The Family would also prosper under Castellano for another decade until John Gotti shot his way to power with Castellano’s infamous gangland hit!"
