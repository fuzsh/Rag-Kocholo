        "text": "Profession: Gangster\n\nBiography: John Gotti was the boss of the Gambino crime family in New York City. He was known for his flamboyant style and frequent media appearances, which earned him the nicknames \"The Dapper Don\" and \"The Teflon Don.\"\n\nGotti rose through the ranks of the Gambino family, starting as an errand boy for a capo named Carmine Fatico. He later became a capo himself, reporting directly to underboss Aniello Dellacroce. In 1985, Gotti orchestrated the murder of the family's boss, Paul Castellano, and took over as the new leader.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Gotti faced multiple trials on various charges but was acquitted each time, leading to his \"Teflon Don\" nickname. Later, however, it was revealed that these trials were influenced by jury tampering and witness intimidation.\n\nGotti's downfall came in 1991 when his underboss, Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano, turned state's evidence and testified against him. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of multiple charges, including murder and racketeering, and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Gotti was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998. He died of the disease in 2002 at the age of 61.\n\nBorn: October 27, 1940\n\nBirthplace: The Bronx, New York, USA\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Dragon\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio"
