        "text": "The Scardino crime family, also known as the Great Lakes City crime family, and the Great Lakes City Mafia, the Scardino clan, the Great Lakes City Mob, and formerly known as the Randazzo crime family, is an Italian-American Mafia crime family based in Great Lakes City, Illinois. The family is named after Charles Scardino, and it is the most powerful criminal organization in Great Lakes City. It's criminal activities include labor racketeering, drug trafficking, loansharking, gambling, fraud, extortion, prostitution, etc. They are considered to be the most powerful crime family in the U.S., with influence outside of the U.S.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigins and early years[]\n\nThe Scardino crime family first originated from two Italian gangs in Great Lakes City: the Randazzo gang, led by Giuseppe Randazzo and the Scardino gang, led by Emilio Scardino. The early years of organized crime in Great Lakes City, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were marked by the dominance of street gangs, including the Black Hand. Giuseppe \"Joe the Roman\" Randazzo emigrated to the United States in 1892 from Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, while Emilio Scardino emigrated from Cefalu in 1895, after killing a police captain, Pasquale Vaccara, in the town. Both men were members of the Sicilian Mafia, with Randazzo being a member of the Castellammarese clan, and Scardino being a member of the Cefaludesi Mafia clan, led by Scardino's father in-law, Paolo Confalone, and they were already inducted: Randazzo in 1889, and Scardino in 1892. Scardino married Confalone's daughter, Gaetana Confalone, in 1893, with whom they bore their first child: Carlo (later anglicized to Charles). Both of the Sicilian Men of Honor formed Black Hand gangs, which engaged in extortion, and counterfeiting. Randazzo centralized control in 1909, and united all the Italian gangs in the city into one, with the help of the Scardino gang, which resulted in the creation of what was then the Randazzo crime family. Randazzo is a distant relative of New York mob boss and fellow Castellammarese Salvatore Maranzano. The Scardino gang was later absorbed into the new Mafia family when they were formally inducted into the Randazzo family, with Emilio Scardino being made a caporegime. In 1914, Emilio brought his son, Charles, into the family, by having him become a made man, and a soldier in his crew. Randazzo managed to form political and business connections with the elite in Great Lakes City, and he became a respected Don in the city. Other businesses that Randazzo was involved in are theft, illegal gambling, etc.\n\nProhibition[]\n\nAfter Prohibition was enacted, Randazzo decided that the Great Lakes City Mafia would expand into the bootlegging business. For Randazzo and Scardino, it was an opportunity for them to expand their criminal empire across Great Lakes City. They also set up legitimate businesses as fronts for their criminal operations. However, they ran into problems with the Malone gang, an Irish-American gang led by Kevin Malone. While Randazzo was willing to work with non-Italians, Malone was unwilling to work with Italians. However, a rival Irish gang of Malone's, the Sullivan Gang, led by Connor Sullivan, was willing to work the Randazzo family. In 1924, the Sullivan Gang and the Malones went into an all-out war, with Sullivan's gang being backed by the Randazzo family. In 1925, Malone was shot to death in the Athlone Bar, an Irish bar that Malone owned. The Malone gang retaliated later that year by killing Randazzo's caporegime, Emilio Scardino. Emilio was succeeded by his son, Charles. Randazzo's underboss, Pasquale DeRossi, was also murdered. In 1928, Malone's brother, Victor Malone, was betrayed by his own men after they made a deal with Sullivan and Randazzo, and afterwards, the Sullivan and Malone Gangs merged into a single Irish-American criminal organization: the Celtic Park Gang. In 1930, a gang war broke out between two bosses in New York: Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. Randazzo, a Castellammarese himself, chose to provide support to Maranzano. Despite the fact that he is more forward-thinking than Masseria and Maranzano, and more willing to work with non-Italians than both New York bosses, Randazzo became regarded by many of his own men as a Mustache Pete, due to his desires to maintain Sicilian traditions within his family, and also due to his refusal to get involved in the narcotics business. Masseria was eventually murdered in 1931, and later that year, Maranzano himself. Charles Scardino decided that he wanted to take over as boss, and conspired with New York mob boss Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano to kill Randazzo and his son, Ettore. The Great Lakes City Mafia was split into two warring factions on September 11: one led by Randazzo, and the other led by Scardino, who appointed Vito Colangelo as underboss for his faction. The event became known as the Scardino-Randazzo war, or the Second Great Lakes Mob War, and the majority of Great Lakes City mobsters backed Scardino's faction, having grown resentful of Randazzo's old ways. On September 20, both Joe and Ettore Randazzo were lured into the Trapani Restaurant, waiting for a shipment, and four gunmen: Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis, and Vito Colangelo, walked into the restaurant, and fired pistols at both Randazzos, killing them with 20 shots, ending the war. After the Randazzos' deaths, Charles Scardino was made the boss of the now-renamed Scardino crime family, with Luciano's backing.\n\nCharles Scardino[]\n\nAfter Charles Scardino took over as the boss, he attended a meeting in Chicago, organized by Luciano, and attended by the bosses of the Five Families of New York City, including Luciano himself, and attended by Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone, and attended by the Three Families of Utrecht City. It was there that Luciano created the Commission, a governing body of the American Mafia, designed to settle disputes between families. The Scardino family got a seat on the Commission, along with the Outfit, and the Utrecht City families. Scardino appointed his friend, Vito Colangelo, as the family's underboss, and Antonio Crocetti as the consigliere.\n\nOver the years, the family has expanded into labor racketeering, and loansharking, and they expanded throughout the Midwestern United States, and even into the Western states. They even expanded into Nevada, where Las Vegas was being developed into a gambling destination. With the backing of the Five Families, the Scardinos expanded into the United Kingdom, even into Scotland, which was dominated by the Neapolitan Miniero crime family, led by Roberto Miniero. An internal power struggle occurred between the Minieros, and the Marcuzzi crime family, a Sicilian gang led by Giacomo Marcuzzi, and backed by the Scardinos. During the war, Roberto Miniero and his brothers were murdered, and the Marcuzzis emerged victorious, taking control of Scotland. Scardino later sent his caporegime, Federico Gallinari, to the United Kingdom, in 1951, to expand the Scardinos' gambling and narcotics operations there. Gallinari was later deported in 1967. The Scardinos also expanded their operations into Cuba, with the help of Tampa Mafia boss Santo Trafficante Jr.\n\nWhen Colangelo died of lung cancer in 1950, Scardino appointed his eldest son and caporegime, Salvatore Scardino, to be his underboss. Sal Scardino was a World War II veteran who served in the United States Army, and he joined the Mafia shortly after being discharged from military service. The Scardinos expanded into Las Vegas, with the help of the Teamsters' Union, the Five Families, and the Chicago Outfit, and they used the Teamsters Union's Pension Fund to fund the construction of new casinos. One of the Casinos that the Scardinos had a hand in building is the Versailles Hotel and Casino. They also skimmed profits from the Vegas casinos.\n\nThe Narcotics trade[]\n\nWhen Charles Scardino became the boss, the Scardino family immediately expanded their criminal operations into narcotics trafficking. Despite the Commission's ban on the drug trade, which was imposed by Carlo Gambino in 1957, the Scardinos continued to traffic drugs, and they were even involved in the French Connection, importing heroin from France. They also set up heroin pipelines of their own in Florida, the Southern United States, Mexico, and Asia. To get around the ban on drugs, Scardino implemented a rule that prohibits the use of drugs by made members, with the punishment being death.\n\nIn 1957, Charles and Sal travelled to Palermo, Sicily, to attend a meeting with various members of the Sicilian Mafia at the Grand Hotel et des Palmes, where both American and Sicilian attendees discussed the heroin trade, including the French Connection. One of the attendees at the meeting was Sal's second cousin, Cefalu Mafia boss Francesco Confalone, and Confalone's friend, San Leoluca Mafia boss Leonardo Rubino, who helped the Scardinos establish a heroin pipeline in the United Kingdom. Joseph Bonanno, boss of the Bonanno crime family, and a friend of the Scardinos, was also in attendance. The meeting played a role in establishing the Bonanno and Scardino families in the heroin trade.\n\nApalachin meeting[]\n\nOn November 14, 1957, Charles and Sal travelled to Apalachin, New York for a summit organized by Vito Genovese, at the home of Joseph Barbara. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss various Cosa Nostra operations, and to legitimize Genovese and Carlo Gambino's takeover as bosses of the newly renamed Genovese and Gambino families. However, a New York State trooper noticed the luxurious cars at Barbara's home, and the reservations that were made by mobsters for various hotels in the town. While 60 mobsters, including Genovese and Gambino, were arrested at the summit, Charlie and Sal escaped the troopers who raided Barbara's house, and immediately fled the town. Due to their escape, they were never questioned about their attendance at the meeting, and they have managed to evade imprisonment.\n\n1960 Presidential election[]\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy ran for the position of President of the United States, and his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, went to the Mafia for support. It is believed that the Scardinos, and the Chicago Outfit, helped Kennedy win the election via the union vote.\n\n\"Sal the Owl\"[]\n\nOn September 20, 1961, Charles Scardino died of stomach cancer, exactly 30 years after the murders of Giuseppe and Ettore Randazzo, and his son, Sal Scardino, took over, as the boss of the family. He is known as \"Sal the Owl\", due to his quiet, intelligent demeanor, and his reputation as a peacemaker. A fellow mobster once said that Sal was as \"silent and deadly as an Owl\". He appointed Robert Laurenti, a 31-year-old captain, as his underboss. Laurenti would later gain weight up to 300 lbs, earning him the nickname, \"Fat Bob\". During this time, the Scardinos were facing intense scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice, under the leadership of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. It was stopped when President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.\n\nAround this time, the Scardinos were importing Sicilians, particularly from Cefalu, into the United States, to help them with drug smuggling, and to carry out other types of work on their behalf. The newly arrived Sicilian immigrants were known as \"Zips\", and among them were three brothers who were distant cousins of the Scardinos: Enzo, Giuseppe, and Niccolo, who are known as the Apple Hill Scardinos. The Scardinos even inducted the Zips into their crime family.\n\nThe Scardinos' involvement in Las Vegas continued, and it went even further, when they started laundering drug money into the casinos in Las Vegas, along with the money from the Teamsters' Pension Fund. They continued to skim profits from the Casinos that they have owned.\n\nDuring the 1970s, there is an increase in cocaine use among Americans, which became known as the Cocaine boom, and the Scardinos saw an opportunity to expand their drug operations into the cocaine market. They connected with Latin American drug cartels, who were producing cocaine, and smuggling it into the United States. The Scardinos distributed cocaine throughout the U.S., and trafficked it into Europe. The narcotics business netted the Scardinos more money than the other Midwestern Mafia families, who either kept themselves out of the drug business, or had little involvement in it. The Scardinos were even involved in the Pizza Connection, where the Sicilian Mafia used pizzerias as fronts for narcotics distribution. The Celtic Park gang were also involved in narcotics trafficking, helping the Scardinos distribute cocaine, heroin, and marijuana throughout the United States.\n\nAfter the death of Celtic Park Gang boss Connor Sullivan, his son, Frank Sullivan, with the backing of the Scardino family, took over in 1975.\n\nIn 1972, the Scardinos sent their associate, David Sandberg, to run their casinos in Vegas. John DeLuca, a Scardino soldier, was sent there in 1969, to protect the Scardinos' interests there. Sandberg, who already obtained a Casino license in 1970, and had no criminal record, was placed in charge of the Versailles Hotel and Casino, and DeLuca was promoted to caporegime, being placed in charge of the Scardinos' Vegas crew. However, DeLuca met Chicago Outfit soldier Anthony Spilotro, and got involved in the Hole in the Wall gang, which engaged in unsanctioned burglaries and heists throughout Vegas, drawing unwanted attention from law enforcement, and leading to the FBI's investigation the Scardinos' activities in Las Vegas. They wiretapped phones, and placed bugs throughout the social clubs, restaurants, and bars owned by the Scardinos. In addition, they teamed up with the DEA in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force to investigate drug trafficking operations, and the drug lords behind it, including Sal Scardino himself.\n\nIn 1982, FBI and DEA agents arrested Sal Scardino, and charged him with skimming money from casinos, and drug trafficking. The FBI also raided Bob Laurenti's house, but Laurenti died of a heart attack before he could be arrested. After Laurenti died, Sal appointed his son, Lawrence Scardino, as underboss, to replace Laurenti. He is known as \"Larry Harvard\", because he was a student at Harvard University. Larry was never involved in the Vegas skim, and because of that, he was never charged. He also was never charged with narcotics trafficking, despite his involvement in the Scardinos' drug business. In 1986, Sal Scardino, and Frank Sullivan, were found guilty of skimming from Las Vegas casinos, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and he made his son, Larry Scardino, as acting boss. Richard Loud Jr. replaced Sullivan as leader of the Celtic Park Gang, with the backing from the Scardino family. Ricky the Duke, as he was known, was the Chairman and CEO of Loud Industries at the time, and he used the company as a front for his criminal operations. In 1987, Sal and Frank were put on trial in Great Lakes City for conspiracy to import, and distribute heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. He was found guilty of the charge, and was sentenced to an additional 20 years in prison. He was released from prison in 1991, and three months later, died of lung cancer on May 30, 1991, leading to Larry Scardino succeeding his father.\n\nLarry Harvard[]\n\nBy the time that Larry succeeded his father as the Scardino family's boss, he had already implemented measures that would insulate himself from the scrutiny of law enforcement, while he was acting boss. He appointed Edward Pucelli as the family's underboss, and longtime capo John Rosato as the family's street boss. To ensure that he would be protected from law enforcement, he had his cousin and associate, Charles Scardino III, make him the President of the Scardino Industries, using the company as a front for his family's criminal operations. In the midst of the intense scrutiny against the Sicilian Mafia, Scardino recruited Corleonesi mobsters into his crime family's Sicilian faction, at the behest of Salvatore \"Toto\" Riina, whom the Confalone clan of Cefalu supported during the Second Mafia War.\n\nHistorical leadership[]\n\nBoss (official and acting)[]\n\n1909-1931: Giuseppe \"Joe the Roman\" Randazzo, crime family split into two factions in September 1931, Randazzo murdered\n\nDisputed 1931: Charles \"Caesar Charlie\" Scardino - for the Scardino faction\n\n1931-1961: Charles \"Caesar Charlie\" Scardino, died in 1961\n\n1961-1991: Salvatore \"Sal the Owl\" Scardino, imprisoned 1986-1991, died in 1991\n\nActing 1986-1991: Lawrence \"Larry Harvard\" Scardino, became boss\n\n1991-present: Lawrence \"Larry Harvard\" Scardino\n\nUnderboss[]\n\n1910-1927: Pasquale DeRossi, murdered\n\n1927-1931: Ettore Randazzo, murdered\n\nDisputed 1931: Vito \"The Badger\" Colangelo, became underboss\n\n1931-1950: Vito \"The Badger\" Colangelo, died\n\n1950-1961: Salvatore Scardino, became boss\n\n1961-1968: Samuel \"Sam\" Saragusa, demoted\n\n1968-1983: Robert \"Fat Bob\" Laurenti, died in 1983\n\n1983-1991: Lawrence \"Larry Harvard\" Scardino, became boss\n\n1991-2006: Edward \"Eddie\" Pucelli, murdered\n\n2006-present: James \"Big Jimmy\" Scardino\n\nConsigliere[]\n\n1931-1970: Antonio \"Tony\" Crocetti, died 1970\n\n1970-1989: Peter \"Petey\" Varrone Sr., died\n\n1989-2000: Francis \"Frankie Rocks\" LaRocca, died\n\n2000-2007: Peter \"Petey\" Varrone Jr., imprisoned\n\n2007-2010: Joseph \"Joey\" Catalano, died\n\n2010-present: Paul \"Paulie the Crow\" Scardino\n\nStreet Boss[]\n\n1986-1989: Francis \"Frankie Rocks\" LaRocca, became consigliere\n\n1989-1991: Edward \"Eddie\" Pucelli, became underboss\n\n1991-2007: John \"Johnny Rose\" Rosato, imprisoned\n\n2007-2014: Thomas \"Tommy\" Spinelli, died\n\n2014-present: Albert \"Al the Leopard\" DiCicco\n\nCurrent family members[]\n\nAdministration[]\n\nBoss - Lawrence \"Larry Harvard\" Scardino\n\nUnderboss - James \"Big Jimmy\" Scardino\n\nConsigliere - Paul \"Paulie the Crow\" Scardino\n\nStreet Boss - Albert \"Al the Leopard\" DiCicco\n\nCaporegime[]\n\nGreat Lakes City Faction[]\n\nVictor \"Vic the Panther\" Martini - Son of Anthony Martini, boss of the Corsaro crime family in Randstad, NY, and younger brother and Corsaro family underboss Anthony Martini Jr.\n\nLouis \"Doctor Lou\" Scardino - third son of Larry Scardino\n\nVincent \"Vinny Stone\" Scardino - fourth and youngest son of Larry Scardino\n\nWilliam \"Bill Maestro\" Laurenti - son of former underboss Bob Laurenti\n\nHenry \"Eagles\" Terranova - former soldier of the Colombo crime family in New York City.
