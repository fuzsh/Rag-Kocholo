        "text": "The feds have launched a sweeping grand-jury probe into the Gambino crime family based on admissions by John “Junior” Gotti and witnesses who testified in his defense at his most recent racketeering trial, sources said yesterday.\n\nProsecutors have sent out at least 12 grand-jury subpoenas to Gotti’s relatives and Gambino crime-family members and associates in recent weeks – and plan to issue approximately two dozen more, a federal law-enforcement source said.\n\nThe probe was triggered by Gotti’s claims that he once ran the Gambinos for his late father, John “Dapper Don” Gotti, but hung up his gangster hat in 1999 – a defense presented at his last two racketeering trials that ended in jury deadlocks.\n\n“[Gotti] left us with a lot of frustration, but also a lot of material, and he has no one to blame but himself,” said a law-enforcement source. “The secret society is no longer a secret anymore. The boss has acknowledged it once and for all. He effectively said it exists, but he’s moved away from it.”\n\nProsecutors and FBI agents culled their invitation list for the highly unusual Gambino crime-family reunion from Gotti’s admissions through his lawyers and the testimony of 12 defense witnesses who took the stand in March.\n\nGotti’s lawyers filed court papers late Tuesday asking a federal judge to block the subpoenas – estimating that 70 or 80 could be issued – and accusing the feds of misusing the grand jury to prepare evidence for Gotti’s third trial, set for July 5.\n\n“If the government is permitted to haul Gotti’s witnesses before a grand jury, it may well have a chilling effect on his ability to call additional witnesses at his upcoming trial and may also impact a jury’s ability to judge Gotti’s witnesses fairly,” Gotti’s lawyer Charles Carnesi wrote.\n\nWitnesses at the grand jury proceeding – set to kick off April 27 and span several days – can expect to be grilled on the positions they and others hold in the organized-crime family, in addition to whatever they know about Gotti, the source said.\n\nThe subpoenas read like a who’s who of the Gambino crime family – “everyone that Junior threw under the bus in his defense. Nobody’s going to be let off,” the source said, speculating the probe could lead to congressional hearings examining the state of the Mafia.\n\nGotti’s uncle Gene tops the list of subpoenas. He would be transported from a federal lockup in Louisiana to Manhattan federal court, where he’d be joined by the elder John Gotti’s former driver, Joseph Watts.\n\nAlso set to be questioned are reputed Gambino bigshots Nicholas Corozzo, a powerhouse capo, and his brother, Joseph “Jo Jo” Corozzo, the family’s consigliere.\n\nThe feds have subpoenaed “Junior” Gotti’s brother Peter – who fingered his late father as boss of the Gambino crime family during his testimony last month – as well as Gotti’s reputed criminal associate Steven Dobies, who also took the stand.\n\nGotti’s jailed uncle Peter will likely get off the hook because of a pending appeal on his previous conviction and sentence, the source said.\n\nA spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia declined to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI has also widened its investigation into possible perjury and obstruction of justice by witnesses for Gotti – a separate probe that was first reported in The Post last month.\n\nIn addition to mob turncoat Joseph Fusaro, the feds are examining the testimony of Gotti’s brother Peter, and Toni Marie Ricci, the ex-wife of star mob turncoat Michael “Mikey Scars” DiLeonardo, the source said."
