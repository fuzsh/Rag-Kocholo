        "text": "The NYS Assembly and Senate have unanimously passed legislation in each house (A7922 and S6689) requiring Medicaid managed care providers who provide coverage for prescription drugs to include not-for-profit pharmacies operated by institutions of higher education in the provider's pharmacy network.\n\nAlbany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences operates two not-for-profit pharmacies:\n\nCollege Hometown Pharmacy, located at 1044 State Street within the Hometown Health Centers in Schenectady\n\nCollege Parkside Pharmacy, located at 20 Warren Street in Albany’s South End\n\nIf approved by the governor, the legislation will allow each of the pharmacies to fill prescriptions for all Medicaid managed care health plans serving the areas where the pharmacies are located.\n\nIn the justification for the legislation, the Assembly and Senate bill memo states: “Bringing accessible health care to medically underserved communities is a priority in New York State and the mission of these pharmacies. This bill helps to bring needed pharmacy and related care to those who need it the most right in their own communities and neighborhoods.”\n\nBelow are statements issued by ACPHS President Greg Dewey and Hometown Health Centers CEO Joe Gambino:\n\n\"I would like to commend the passage of this critically important legislation by the State Assembly under the leadership of Speaker Heastie and bill sponsors Assembly Members Steck, Fahy, McDonald, Gottfried, and Santabarbara. We are equally appreciative for the efforts of Senate Majority Leader Flanagan, bill sponsor Senator Amedore, and Senator Breslin for helping move the bill swiftly through the Senate,” said Greg Dewey, Ph.D., President of Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. “The stated mission of the New York State Department of Health is to ‘protect, improve, and promote the health, productivity, and wellbeing of all New Yorkers.’ This legislation represents another positive step in that direction.”\n\n“I, too, would like to thank all of the legislators who made this possible. The unanimous support this bill received from both houses clearly demonstrates New York’s commitment to having the healthiest people in the nation, regardless of one’s income level,” said Joe Gambino, CEO of Hometown Health Centers, an organization nationally recognized for providing high-quality health care. \"Plain and simple, this is common sense legislation that will ensure healthy outcomes for children and families.\"\n\nAbout Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences\n\nFounded in 1881, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is a private, independent institution with a long tradition of academic and research excellence.
