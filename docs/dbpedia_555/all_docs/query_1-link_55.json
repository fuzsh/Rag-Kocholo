        "text": "The essential oil of Backhousia citriodora, commonly known as lemon myrtle oil, possesses various beneficial properties due to its richness in bioactive compounds. This study aimed to characterize the chemical profile of the essential oil isolated from leaves of Backhousia citriodora (BCEO) and its biological properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, and antibiofilm activities. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, 21 compounds were identified in BCEO, representing 98.50% of the total oil content. The isomers of citral, geranial (52.13%), and neral (37.65%) were detected as the main constituents. The evaluation of DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power showed that BCEO exhibited strong antioxidant activity at IC50 of 42.57 μg/mL and EC50 of 20.03 μg/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity results showed that BCEO exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epider...\n\nChemical composition of the essential oils extracted from the leaves, stems, flowers and seeds of Heracleum rechingeri Manden. were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Twenty-four components were characterized for the leaf oil with Octyl acetate(47.2%), Octanol(15.2%) and E-caryophyllen (5.7%) as the main constituents. 25 compounds were identified in the stem oil with Elemicin (65.3%), Octyl acetate (13.0%) and Octanol (3.5%) as the major components. 18 compound were identified in the flower oil with Octyl acetate (46.8%), Elemicin (12.8%) and methyl chavicol (10.2%) as the major components. Among 13 compounds studying in the seed oil of H.rechingeri, the major constituents were Octyl acetate (91.7%), Octanol (3.5%) and Octanal (1.2%).\n\nIn this work, the chemical composition and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils (EOs) of six species—Laurus nobilis, Chamaemelum nobile, Citrus aurantium, Pistacia lentiscus, Cedrus atlantica, and Rosa damascena—have been studied. Phytochemical screening of these plants revealed the presence of primary metabolites, namely, lipids, proteins, reducing sugars, and polysaccharides, and also secondary metabolites such as tannins, flavonoids, and mucilages. The essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The yields are between 0.06 and 4.78% (mL/100 g). The analysis of the chemical composition carried out by GC-MS showed the presence of 30 to 35 compounds and represent between 99.97% and 100% of the total composition of EOs, with a variation in the chemical composition detected at the level of the majority compounds between these species. Indeed, in the EO of Laurus nobilis, 1,8-cineole (36.58%) is the major component. In Cha...\n\nThe chemistry of Cassia siamea L., C. occidentalis L. (Fabaceae), Cnestis ferruginea Vahl ex DC (Connaraceae), Anthocleista djalonensis A. Chev (Loganiaceae), Solanum torvum Swartz and S. erianthum G. Don (Solanaceae) volatiles grown in Nigeria have been studied. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The main compounds of C. siamea were (E)-geranyl acetone (5.8%), 1-octen-3-ol (5.8%), linalool (7.8%), iso-italicene (15.4%) and (E)-beta-damascenone (11.0%). On the other hand, C. occidentalis consisted mainly of (E)-geranyl acetone (8.0%), hexahydrofarnesylacetone (24.0%) and (E)-phytol acetate (40.7%). The oil of C. ferruginea was comprised mainly of (E)-geranyl acetone (13.7%), (E)-alpha-ionone (9.5%), phytol (5.8%), pentadecanal (6.1%) and 1-octen-3-ol (5.5%). The main compounds of A. djalonensis were alpha-humulene (31.9%), beta-caryophyllene (17.8%), humulene epoxide II (12.7%) and caryophyllene oxide (5.9%). The main volatiles of S. ..."
