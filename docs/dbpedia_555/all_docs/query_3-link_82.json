Many come from trading samples with other collectors in Australia as well as overseas. My biggest trade at one point was the 49 species I exchanged with a bloke from California (thanks Lanchi!) in return for 49 of our local timbers, but that has now been overtaken by the 6 1/2 dozen that Col Martin of the IWCS generously dropped in my ute on an excursion with the IWCS here on the Highlands (thanks Col!).\n\nIf you have a piece of wood 50x50x70mm or thereabouts that isn't on the list, just leave me a message on my feedback page and we'll work something out."
