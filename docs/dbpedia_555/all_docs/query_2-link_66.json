        "text": "Paul and Michelle Brereton are the owners of Bells Echo Animal Rescue, a property situated in Wyee, approximately 20km northwest of Central Coast, New South Wales. The property is a residence and sanctuary as well as a wildlife rehabilitation and release site. Paul and Michelle intend to continue rehabilitating native species whilst regenerating remnant habitats on the property. Paul and Michelle are licensed rehabilitators with Wildlife ARC and the property is also registered with Land for Wildlife.\n\nThe property covers approximately 48.56 hectares of densely forested undulating land bisected by a creekline. Vegetation primarily consists of high quality remnant rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. The property provides a wildlife corridor for the adjoining Olney State Forest and the rainforest forms part of an Endangered Ecological Community.\n\nA recent survey of the site has identified a range of eucalypts such as Sydney blue gum (Eucalyptus saligna), tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys), blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) and grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata). Lilly pilly (Syzygium smithii), Bangalow palm (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana), brown myrtle (Choricarpia leptopetala), native rosella (Hibiscus heterophyllus) and maiden’s wattle (Acacia maidenii) are also found within the remnant habitats.\n\nWildlife is abundant on the property and includes brushtail (Trichosurus vulpecula) and ringtail (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) possums, bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus), superb lyrebirds (Menura novaehollandiae) and many more."
