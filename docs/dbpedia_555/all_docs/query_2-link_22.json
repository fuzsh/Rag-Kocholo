        "text": "Myrtle rust is a serious fungal disease that affects plants in the Myrtaceae family. It infects many native species like bottle brush, tea tree and eucalyptus.\n\nIf you see or suspect myrtle rust, please report it to Biosecurity Queensland by calling 13 25 23. Myrtle rust is a new disease to Australia, although we cannot eradicate it, you can help us stop the spread.\n\nHow to identify myrtle rust\n\nTo identify myrtle rust, look for masses of powdery bright yellow or orange-yellow spores on infected plants. It is mostly found in wet and humid conditions.\n\nHow does myrtle rust spread?\n\nThe myrtle rust fungus produces thousands of spores which are highly mobile. These spores spread rapidly through wind, human activity and animals. Common ways include:\n\nmovement of infected or contaminated plant material\n\nanimals such as bees, birds, bats and possums\n\ncontaminated plant waste, timber and wood packaging\n\ncontaminated equipment and tools used on or around plants\n\ncontaminated clothing and shoes.\n\nRust pustules can mature to release spores in as little as 10 to 12 days. Spores can survive for up to three months in the environment.\n\nPlanting strategies and recommendations\n\nSmall-scale revegetation\n\nTo reduce myrtle rust when planting a few trees:\n\nChoose plants that are relatively tolerant or only moderately susceptible.\n\nAvoid plants that are highly susceptible or extremely susceptible.\n\nLarge-scale revegetation\n\nTo reduce myrtle rust when planting many trees:\n\nChoose plants that are relatively tolerant or only moderately susceptible.\n\nIf you wish to plants that are highly susceptible or extremely susceptible\n\nplant them few and far between\n\nbuffer them from wind with relatively tolerant plants\n\nspace out plants to reduce humidity, no specific distance is recommended.\n\nHelp stop the spread\n\nIf you see or suspect myrtle rust, please report it to Biosecurity Queensland by calling 13 25 23.\n\nWe do not yet know the full host range of myrtle rust. With your help, we can stop its spread, manage impacts and carry out research to seek long-term solutions."
