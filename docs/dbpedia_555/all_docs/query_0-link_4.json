The total number of species of dicotyledons described in Volume | and Volume 2 is 2629 in 899 genera and 155 families, with 1347 species in 474 genera and 77 families in Volume 2. As explained in the Introduction of Volume 1, Family 8 Proteaceae has been included in Volume 2 to allow incorporation of changes brought about by modern revisions in the group but not published in time for inclusion in Volume |. The format of Volume 2 remains the same as that of Volume 1. Estelle Ross prepared the families numbered 8, 80-91, 103, 110, 124-127, 136, 148-154, and the genus Eucalyptus in 99. Myrtaceae. Peter Taylor of the Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Richmond, England, prepared the account of Family 143. Lentibulariaceae and Helen Aston of the National Herbarium of Victoria prepared the account of 123. Menyanthaceae. Families 92-98, 99, Myrtaceae with the exception of Eucalyptus, 100-102, 104-109, 111-122, 128-135, 137-142, 144-147 and 155 were prepared by Trevor Stanley. een bpete ities euobotere \"hous S208] & peo eat eryiayy ink 7 ek WV ot Dare s+ tan qe.

In particular the authors would like to thank Peter Taylor of the Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Richmond, England, for preparing the treatment of Lentibulariaceae and Helen Aston of the National Herbarium of Victoria for preparing the treatment of Menyanthaceae. The authors would also like to thank Norm Byrnes of the Queensland Herbarium, since retired, for making available his unpublished notes on several genera of Myrtaceae, and Bill McDonald also of the Queensland Herbarium for his assistance with Eucalyptus. As in Volume 1, many published works have been consulted in the preparation of this work and although too numerous to list here, the authors wish to make due acknowledgement to them.

Leaves in whorls of 3-5; petioles 0.4—1 cm long; blades narrowly obovate or very narrowly oblong-obovate, apex obtuse or acute, mucronate, base cuneate to attenuate, margin entire or occasionally with a few teeth, (3-)4-20(-23) cm x 0.6-3.5 cm, densely white tomentose below, venation other than midrib obscure. Inflorescences terminating i-3 year old branchlets, 5—12(—20) cm x 5.5-7.5 cm, involucral bracts 0.2-1 cm long; perianth pale yellow, 2.2-2.9 cm long, appressed pubescent outside, apical region elliptic, 3.5-4.5 mm long; anthers ca 2 mm long, apiculate, pistil 2.7-3. 4cm long, curved gently down, then up, or + straight, style apex 0.7—-1 mm long, scarcely differentiated. Infructescences woody, follicles numerous, valves 0.9-1.3 cm across, flowers not persistent, soon deciduous. Two varieties occur in the region: 1. Leaves 4-10 cm long, + flat, usually dull green above . B. integrifolia var. integrifolia Leaves (5—)10—20(—23) cm long, + undulate, usually shining above B. integrifolia var. compar B. integrifolia var. integrifolia (B. integrifolia var. typica Domin) occurs typically on consolidated sand cules close to the coast and along tidal inlets but also has been recorded from the top of Mt. Lindesay and sschendale near Stanthorpe. B. integrifolia var. compar (R. Br.) F. M. Bailey (B. compar R. Br.) occurs in a WwW KS range of habitats from coastal dunes to montane forest, in south-eastern Queensland in open forest in sand or loam, sometimes on seasonally swampy ground. Both flower mainly summer to winter. Cultivated as an ornamental. Some populations in south-eastern Queensland are intermediate between the two varieties. 5. Banksia oblongifolia Cav.
