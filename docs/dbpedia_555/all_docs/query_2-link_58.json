For more information see Camphor Laurel in the Weeds to Whack section of this web site.\n\nWhy it’s bad\n\nCamphor Laurel’s toxic chemicals poison local fauna and suppress competition from native plants. Colonises disturbed waterways, becomes dense forest.\n\nControl\n\nSaplings can be cut at ground level and the stumps painted with herbicide. Larger trees need professional crews.\n\nAlternatives\n\nBrown Myrtle, or any of the local Cryptocarya species especially Three-veined Laurel Cryptocarya triplinervis. Also Murrogun, Pepperberry, Jackwood and Glossy Laurel."
