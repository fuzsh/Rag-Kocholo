        "text": "[quote]Burton was enough of a rumor that she denied it at least once. But she's also made it clear that she wants to keep her private life private, so you'd expect a denial even if true.\n\nAs if she would ever confirm that she was fucking her director who had just recently separated from his long-time partner after working with her... They were pictured strolling together on a night out in London with Burton with his arm around her when they weren't even filming anything. Burton also has an history of fucking his actresses.\n\n[quote]Could she be lesbionic, and that's why she is hiding her private life and relationships?\n\nShe has dated men and even actors in the past, but they either weren't famous enough for people to care about who she fucks and/or she didn't call the paps to stage \"a romantic and super spontaneous stroll\" whenever she left her house.\n\n[quote]Green made some comment (aka accusations?) about Harvey Weinstein when the whole #MeToo thing began.\n\nShe did, and then she worked with rapist Roman Polanski right after that and called him \"a nice man\" in an interview.\n\n[quote]She’s also worked with Roman Polanski, on last year’s Based on a True Story. “It’s not a good film,” Green tuts. But did she have to think hard about accepting that job? “No,” she replies firmly. “In France he’s much better perceived than in America or England. He’s a god. In the [French] movie industry it’s always like, ‘you have to work with Polanski’. And he’s a nice man. I think it’s a bit different now that I know him, and I know his wife,” she says of the actress Emmanuelle Seigner, her co-star in the film, “and they have a different version [of the original story]… And it is a long thing and I don’t want to take sides. But people are complicated. You get the opportunity to work with a great artist... I don’t know, it’s a hard one. You sell your soul, I guess,” Green concedes.\n\n[quote]And then there’s Harvey Weinstein. Last year, in an interview with a French radio station, Green’s mother Marlène Jobert alleged that the disgraced mogul tried to physically assault her daughter in a Parisian hotel suite. “She managed to escape, but he threatened to destroy her professionally,” said Jobert.\n\n[quote]Talking publicly about the incident for the first time, Green admits to feeling heavily intimidated at the meeting, which was for “a project that didn’t exist” and was sold to her on the basis of how he could change my career.\n\n[quote]“He’s very pushy. But he gets turned on by fear, that’s for sure. He’s not quite right here,” she says, tapping her temple. “It’s about power — I’ve seen him in restaurants…’\n\n[quote]“Also, lots of people in this business knew about it, not mentioning names. And I’m still angry with them — they knew what happened to me and they never did anything. They preferred to remain blind because he was God.”\n\nGotta love how she's angry with the people who allegedly knew about what Weinstein did to her only minutes after she called another rapist \"a nice man\" and saying she won't take sides regarding the proven fact that he's a convicted rapist..."
