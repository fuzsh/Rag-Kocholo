        "text": "Eva Green broke her silence and came out in defense of Johnny Depp through a publication she made on her Instagram account.\n\nThe actress defended her partner in \"Dark Shadows\", who is currently on trial with his ex-wife Amber Heard.\n\nDepp sued Heard for defamation after the actress published a note in The Washington Post claiming to have been a victim of gender violence at the hands of her, at the time, husband. She countersued him, claiming that she is the one who was defamed.\n\nThe French star who worked with Depp in 2012 and with whom, from that moment on, she struck up a great friendship relationship, took to her Instagram account to express her support for him.\n\nWhat Eva Green said about Johnny Depp's lawsuit against Amber Heard\n\nThrough an Instagram post, Green posted a photo in which she is next to Depp on a red carpet, with a message in favor of her colleague.\n\n\"I do not doubt that Johnny will emerge with his good name and wonderful heart revealed to the world, and life will be better than ever for him and his family,\" she wrote, alongside an emoji of a peace dove.\n\nEva's post in support of Johnny garnered more than 200 thousand likes and three thousand comments, most of which were from fans of the actor.\n\nThe film Dark Shadows, directed by Tim Burton and starring Green and Depp was released in 2012, the same year the actor started dating Heard.\n\nDepp and Heard's lawsuit\n\nJohnny has sued his ex Amber Heard for defamation in a $50 million lawsuit. The actor has alleged that an article his ex-wife wrote for the Washington Post was damaging to his career. In the article, although Amber did not name Johnny, she said she was a survivor of domestic abuse."
