        "text": "A widow has explained how she secured a Â£23,000 lump sum after being underpaid on her state pension for years. The pensioner suspected she was due more than the Â£400 per month she was receiving, in addition to a small pension from her late husband.\n\nDue to a system error at the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), approximately 700,000 individuals, predominantly women, have had their state pensions reviewed. The unnamed woman believed she was among those affected and engaged in an eight-year dispute with the DWP, as reported by The Times.\n\nAfter numerous phone calls and years of battling, the DWP finally conceded that she was correct and awarded her Â£23,000. The DWP has disbursed Â£571.6 million to nearly 100,000 pensioners whose payments should have been increased either when they turned 80 or due to their husband's national insurance contributions.\n\nThe 71-year-old cared for her husband from 2013, when he began exhibiting symptoms of dementia, until his passing in 2016. She was receiving just over Â£400 a month from her state pension and depended on funds from his pension to get by.\n\nFollowing her husband's death, the Surrey resident found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet and had to request financial assistance from her brothers. Consequently, she reached out to the DWP to inquire if her payment was accurate, reports the Express.\n\nShe was informed that she was receiving the maximum amount to which she was entitled - but she persisted in challenging her low pension.\n\nThe Government is actively reviewing pension records to identify individuals who missed out on an automatic increase in their pension. This includes women whose husbands turned 65 on or after 17 March 2008 and are receiving less than 60% of their husband's basic state pension.\n\nOthers potentially affected include widows whose husbands passed away post-17 March 2008, having been paid less than 60% of his state pension during his lifetime, or widows whose own state pension did not rise following their husband's death. Additionally, those aged 80 and above not receiving at least Â£85 a week in state pension are being looked into.\n\nThe Government is giving priority to the over-80s and widowed individuals. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) should, in principle, reach out to those entitled to more money with a letter - however many have slipped through the net and are living in poverty.\n\nA woman shared with the Times: \"The stress of losing my husband was made worse by the worry of struggling on a low pension and how I would afford to live and this made my health much worse.\"\n\nState pension entitlement typically hinges on national insurance contributions. To receive the new full state pension of Â£221.20 a week (Â£11,502 a year), one needs 35 complete years of contributions.\n\nA minimum of ten qualifying years is necessary to receive any state pension, though there is also pension credit available for those on lower incomes.\n\nWomen born before April 6, 1953, and men born before April 6, 1951, are eligible for the old basic state pension, which although lower in payment, offers a chance to increase the amount received based on their spouse's national insurance contributions. This can occur after the spouse either passes away or reaches state pension age, depending on individual national insurance contributions and amounts paid.\n\nThe case in point involves a woman whose husband owned a vegetable wholesale business while she took care of the home, making only some national insurance contributions herself. Consequently, she did not qualify for a full basic state pension.\n\nHowever, upon her husband's death, her entitlement should have increased due to his complete contribution history.\n\nStruggling with a monthly state pension of Â£441, she reached out to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in desperation, saying, \"I told them I couldn't survive on so little and they advised me to apply for pension credit. I sent off all the paperwork in February and must have chased eight or nine times on its progress but was told there was a big backlog.\"\n\nA further call revealed that the DWP was awaiting her reply to a letter sent that month, which she claims never arrived. The letter contained the confirmation Mary had long suspected - she had been underpaid on her state pension. She was now owed Â£23,000 by the government.\n\nTo qualify for the payment increases, married, widowed or divorced women previously had to contact the DWP, but this changed in 2008. Since then, the additional payments should have been made automatically.\n\nThe DWP has been working to rectify systematic state pension underpayments since 2021. It stated: \"Our priority is ensuring pensioners get the dignity and security they deserve in retirement and that state pension underpayment rates remain as low as possible. We have completed the majority of cases as planned and expect to complete by the year end.\""
