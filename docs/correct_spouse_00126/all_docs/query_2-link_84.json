        "text": "We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\n\nWhen it came out that actor and pop singer Ariana Grande was dating \"Wicked\" co-star Ethan Slater, it's fair to say that the internet was shook. The timeline especially raised eyebrows — after all, Grande's new relationship was revealed only three days after she announced her split from then-husband Dalton Gomez in July 2023. While some fans have still tried to be supportive of Grande and Slater, others seem skeptical, expressing doubt that the relationship will last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When Ariana and Ethan inevitably break up in 2-6 months, they will both look like the biggest clowns for this,\" one user wrote on Reddit. Another criticized Slater, writing, \"Leaving [your] woman of 10 years over Ariana, who is probably gonna dump you in 3 months, is so idiotic.\" Yikes. Clearly, onlookers aren't pulling their punches over this controversial romance. But does their pessimism have any grounds in the reality of Grande and Slater's partnership?\n\nTo get a clearer idea of the couple's chances, Glam spoke exclusively to relationship expert Terri Orbuch, Ph.D. Also called \"The Love Doctor,\" Dr. Orbuch is a distinguished professor at Oakland University and the author of \"Finding Love Again: 6 Simple Steps to a New and Happy Relationship.\" This wealth of experience has given her deep insight into the many inner workings and pitfalls of romance, including the challenges that face celebrity couples like Grande and Slater. And in Dr. Orbuch's professional opinion, there are a few red flags that the duo should keep a close eye on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Ariana Grande met Ethan Slater, neither star was single. Grande was reportedly having troubles with Dalton Gomez — Us Weekly claims that a confidential source said, \"They were having issues before she left for 'Wicked' filming [in London] that they couldn't resolve, and the distance did not help.\" However, Grande and Gomez didn't divorce until March 2024 — well after Slater arrived on the scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorse yet, all signs indicate that Slater was happily committed to his wife before meeting Grande. In November 2022, a mere month before \"Wicked\" began filming, Slater shared a now-deleted Instagram post celebrating his anniversary with Lilly Jay. \"My best friend. 4 years married, 10 years together. And this is easily the best and most (*bizarre*) year yet,\" he captioned the post (per E! News). After the couple separated and Slater's new relationship with Grande came to light, sources allegedly told Page Six that Jay was \"completely blindsided\" and wrecked by the sudden split.\n\nIs either Grande or Slater guilty of outright cheating? We may never know. But all this turmoil doesn't look good for the celebs or their partnership. Speaking exclusively to Glam, Dr. Terri Orbuch notes their relationship timeline as a red flag for trust issues. \"Their romantic relationship most likely started before Ariana and Ethan 'officially' divorced their respective spouses. How can either of them fully trust the other that this won't happen again in the future? (Or on future respective movie sets).\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriana Grande and Ethan Slater first connected on the set of \"Wicked\" in December 2022, and it seems that their shared interest escalated quickly. But Dr. Terri Orbuch exclusively warns that chemistry on set doesn't equate to a stable foundation for a relationship. \"It is not uncommon for celebrities to meet on a movie set, spend tons of time with each other, fall in love, and break up with their partners. But, did they fall in love because of the time spent with each other, the common goal of filming the movie, or because they are compatible and good for each other?\" Dr. Orbuch questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory has certainly provided plenty of examples where co-star couples couldn't last the distance. Alexis Bledel dated three different costars on \"Gilmore Girls,\" Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki's two-year relationship didn't outlive their work on \"The Big Bang Theory,\" and Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner only lasted three months after shooting \"Valentine's Day.\" Even the second-chance romance of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez — who first met while filming the 2003 rom-com \"Gigli\" — is now sparking persistent divorce rumors.\n\nOf course, not all co-star meet-cutes end in disappointment. Just look at the relationship between Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes, which is all green flags. But the heartbreak-studded landscape of Hollywood does prove one thing: Grande and Slater will need to move past the first blush of their \"Wicked\" romance to build something that lasts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriana Grande's quick turnaround between Dalton Gomez and Ethan Slater naturally invited speculation. Chief among these theories is the widespread suspicion that Grande and Slater were dating — or at least flirting — before making their infatuation public. As one user observed on Reddit, \"They definitely had to be at least emotionally invested in each other while with their partners.\" Unfortunately, Dr. Terri Orbuch warns that going official could dent the lovebirds' enthusiasm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It sounds like their relationship was secretive ... for several months, which can be really exciting and passionate,\" Dr. Orbuch exclusively tells Glam. \"This passion and excitement can falsely lead people to partner and think they are right for each other. But what happens after they become a full-fledged couple and they are 'out' in public? Does the relationship still stand on its own, do they still connect, and are they compatible once the secretiveness is gone?\"\n\nIt's a fair question. BetterHelp explains several reasons that our brains may find forbidden love alluring, from valuing hard-earned rewards (like relationships that require the extra work of sneaking and subterfuge) to reacting against threats to our freedom (i.e., wanting something bad as a way of expressing independence). While there are certainly ways to rekindle the spark in a long-term relationship, the red flag of their no-longer-forbidden love could still pose problems for Grande and Slater. Only time will tell whether the couple enjoys regular dating enough for it to become something more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many celebrities, Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater will have to contend with one major red flag in the form of their busy, jet-setting lifestyles. In our exclusive interview with Dr. Terri Orbuch, she questioned the durability of their relationship in the face of \"inevitable separation.\" \"What happens when they aren't together on a movie set, and in the future are separated for weeks [or] months on different movie sets [or] projects? Will separation tear them apart?\" she asks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a Broadway regular known for starring in shows like \"Spamalot\" and \"The SpongeBob Musical,\" Slater is often tied to New York City. Meanwhile, Grande has obligations all over the globe, and has teased an eventual tour to support her 2024 album \"Eternal Sunshine.\" While no plans are set in stone, Grande told the \"Zach Sang Show\" that the thought of a tour was tempting her. \"I would love to do shows ... I miss being on stage. I miss my fans so much,\" she said. \"I do have a very busy year ... But I definitely do have the itch.\"\n\nOf course, both Grande and Slater are still signed on for \"Wicked: Part Two,\" which could provide an opportunity for closeness. So perhaps the threat of long-distance romance isn't looming just yet. But when the fast pace of life in the spotlight does rear its ugly head, we'll be interested to see if Grande and Slater can overcome adversity to maintain their connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthan Slater is a Tony Award-winning performer, clearly oozing with talent. And Ariana Grande hardly needs an introduction — from Grande's stunning style transformation to the Grammy winner's many musical laurels, she's a bona fide icon. But these individual strengths won't help them overcome the roadblocks that plague every relationship. So can Grande and Slater bring the dedication needed to weather every storm?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Terri Orbuch exclusively suggests that stress could present problems for the duo. \"Their relationship will inevitably have issues, challenges, and stressors. ... When life gets tough or stressful, do both of them leave, rather than work on a relationship [or] situation to make it better?\" Furthering her point, Dr. Orbuch brings up the failure of prior relationships as a potential warning sign. \"Even their previous marriages had challenges. Did they try and work them out? Or, is their 'go-to' strategy to leave when the going gets tough?\"\n\nSlater's relationship with Lilly Jay lasted 10 years, which isn't a bad precedent. However, serial dater Grande hasn't had a relationship longer than three years, so she may not have had the time and experience to master long-haul, committed relationships. It's okay if she's still finding herself and learning what she wants — after all, there's no rule saying that you have to stick to long-term monogamy. But what are the chances that Slater will be the one who breaks Grande's dating trend? Again, only time will tell.\n\nAdvertisement"
