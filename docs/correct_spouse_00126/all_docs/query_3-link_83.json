        "text": "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\n\nNearly 150 years after his assassination, Abraham Lincoln is getting his due from Hollywood. 2012 sees the release of three movies featuring the 16th President front-and-center. The biggest of these is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited bio-pic, due t...\n\nAeon Flux\n\nI'll never understand why studios sometimes choose to withhold films from critics. The lack of advance screenings of Aeon Flux establishes an expectation that the film is likely to be tough to sit through. It's the studio's way of throwing in th...\n\nDebt, The\n\nWatching The Debt, I was reminded of how entertaining a well-executed Cold War thriller can be. Although elements of this movie, based on the 2007 Israeli film Ha-Hov, have a kinship to Steven Spielberg's Munich, the overall thrust is more in line ...\n\nDream House\n\nHours after seeing Dream House, I was still trying to figure out how a movie starring Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts, lensed by Caleb Deschanel, and directed by Jim Sheridan could be such a disappointment. It's obvious what's wrong wit...\n\nEqualizer, The\n\nWhen The Equalizer arrived on television in the 1980s, it was notable for two things: being the first Reagan-era show to lionize vigilantism and presenting an \"advocate\" who broke the Curtis Sliwa-inspired stereotypes.

And, unlike many recent entries in the genre, it does not seek to take a revisionist look at war. The central premise is promising: a factua...\n\nKingdom of Heaven\n\nIn Gladiator, director Ridley Scott transported movie audiences to the year 180 AD. Five years and four motion pictures later, the Oscar-winning director has again immersed himself in the blood and gore of hand-to-hand combat, although this time t...\n\nKingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut)\n\nIn recent years, the term \"director's cut\" has undergone a devaluation. It has become a marketing term, appended to DVDs to enhance their salability. Often, a \"director's cut\" will be essentially the same as the theatrical cut, except with a fe...\n\nLoving\n\nAs straightforward “based on a true story” movies go, Loving is a strong account of the key factual events that led to the landmark 1967 Supreme Court decision overturning anti-miscegenation laws. Effectively acted and occasionally moving...\n\nMark Felt\n\nFor more than 30 years, one of the great mysteries of journalism and politics was the identity of Woodward & Bernstein’s key Watergate source, “Deep Throat.” Between Deep Throat’s period of contribution (1972-73) and his voluntary unma..."
