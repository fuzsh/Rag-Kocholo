        "text": "English: either a nickname for someone who was fond of dressing in this color (Old English grÄne) or was young or immature, or who had played the part of the âGreen Manâ in the May Day celebrations, or a topographic name for someone who lived near a village green (Middle English grene, a transferred use of the color term). This is one of the most common and widespread of English surnames. In North America it has assimilated cognates from other languages, notably German GrÃ¼n (see Gruen ) and Dutch Groen ; compare 7 below. This surname is also very common among African Americans."
