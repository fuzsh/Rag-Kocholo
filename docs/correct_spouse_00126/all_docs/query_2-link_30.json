        "text": "Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes may be one of the most private couples in Hollywood, but the strong bond between them is unmistakable.\n\nAfter hitting it off on the set of 2012’s The Place Beyond the Pines, the actors embarked on what became a serious romance that, over a decade later, has produced various creative collaborations, two young daughters, and, in 2022, wedding bells.\n\nThough Mendes and Gosling have kept the intimate aspects of their relationship and family life away from the spotlight, they have made plenty evident via social media posts, speeches, interviews, and appearances that their romance is one strongly rooted in mutual respect—both in the household and in their careers.\n\nHere, we’ve documented the pair’s sweetest moments. Review the full trajectory of their relationship ahead.\n\nMay 3, 2024: Ryan reveals the sweet nickname their daughters use for him.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Gosling opens about how parenting has changed his life, and he reveals the nickname that his and Mendes’s daughters, Esmeralda and Amada, use for him: “Papi.”\n\n“It kills me every time,” he says. “There’s just nothing, nothing better than that.”\n\nThe nickname, which translates from Spanish to “daddy,” makes sense, given that Mendes comes from a Cuban heritage. She’s previously said that she attempts to teach their daughters Spanish, but it’s difficult, because it often results in Spanglish. “[It’s] harder than I thought because I speak Spanglish and that’s what they’re picking up,” she said on CBS’s The Talk. “It’s adorable, but it’s technically not a language.”\n\nMay 2, 2024: Eva gushes about Ryan in an interview.\n\nMendes talks about her and Gosling’s family life in a rare interview with People for the magazine’s “Beautiful” issue, explaining that leaving Hollywood to take care of their daughters was the “easiest” and best decision she ever made.\n\nDuring the chat, she also talks about why Gosling is the perfect partner, saying that they support one another unconditionally, and in every way. “I’m not going to tell you that, but in all the ways I need to be supported,” she says of how the Barbie star supports her. “He’s got me in all the ways.”\n\nMendes also notes that while she holds down the fort at home while Gosling is away at work, he usually takes care of the food. “I’m not a cook, so my man cooks and I clean—so it’s a nice even. I can’t cook. You don’t want me to cook,” she jokes. “My girls, they’re so cute, but they’re like, ‘Did you make these eggs, Mama?’ I’m like, ‘They’re eggs, yes. They’re just regular eggs.’ Who messes up eggs?”\n\nJanuary 24, 2024: Eva reacts to Ryan’s Oscar nomination.\n\nAfter the Academy announced Gosling’s Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as Ken in Barbie, Mendes takes to Instagram to congratulate her man—by sharing screenshots of a 2022 Rolling Stone article that blasted his casting as “cringe.”\n\nMendes explains in the caption, “So proud of my man. So much hate when he took on this role. So many people trying to shame him for doing it. Despite all the #Notmyken ridicule and articles written about him, he created this completely original, hilarious, heartbreaking, now iconic character and took it all the way to Oscars.”\n\nShe concluded the sweet note, “So beyond proud to be this Ken’s Barbie.”\n\nJune 9, 2023: Ryan honors Eva at the Barbie premiere.\n\nGosling brings the Kenergy to the world premiere of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, held July 9 at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall in Los Angeles. The actor channels the male doll in a baby-pink suit with a cotton-candy-colored shirt and ivory shoes. He accessorizes only with a small E chain necklace in the signature white-and-pink Barbie font. When Entertainment Tonight asks him on the carpet what the charm stands for, Gosling replies: “Eva.”\n\nMendes does not join her husband at the event, though she has been supportive of his role in the film from afar.\n\nNovember 21, 2022: Eva officially confirms her marital status.\n\nMendes appears to confirm in passing that she and Gosling have gotten secretly married. During a guest appearance on Channel 9’s Today in Australia, the actress nonchalantly refers to Gosling—who is also in the country filming his upcoming movie The Fall Guy—as her “husband.”\n\n“Everyone is so welcoming here, and my husband, Ryan, is here, and we are having the best time,” she tells hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon.\n\nNovember 15, 2022: Eva hints at marriage to Gosling.\n\nOn Instagram, the actress debuts a new tattoo on her wrist that hints at potential wedding bells. The tattoo spells out “de Gosling,” which is potentially shorthand for \"Eva Mendes de Gosling,\" per Latinx culture—or, in other words, “Mrs. Gosling.”\n\n“🖤⚔️🖤,” Mendes writes in the caption.\n\nOctober 2022: Eva hypes up Ryan on her Instagram.\n\nMendes proudly flaunts Gosling on her Instagram account following his starring campaign for Gucci. \"My Magic Man,\" she captions a post featuring Gosling in the campaign’s video shoot. And in a separate carousel of photos, she writes, “Ummm...... YES PLEASE.”\n\nAugust 23, 2022: Eva calls her family with Ryan her “home.”\n\nThe actress tells People that she’s “home” wherever her husband and kids are. “Wherever they are, that’s just what it is,” she says.\n\nAugust 18, 2022: Eva reveals her screen saver of Ryan.\n\nIn an Instagram video of Mendes detailing her “everyday cleaning must-haves,” the actress also reveals a glimpse of her phone’s lock screen—which boasts an image of Gosling from his Netflix film The Gray Man—which she stops to look at and smile.\n\nJune 2022: Eva supports Ryan’s Ken online.\n\nMendes makes it clear on social media that she is fully into Gosling’s new look as Ken in the upcoming Barbie film when she posts a photo on Instagram of Gosling sporting platinum-blond hair and an open denim jacket that reveals his six-pack abs. “So. F. Funny. So. F. Good. So F excited for you to see this,” she writes in the caption. “#Thatsmyken.”\n\nLater in the month, Mendes also opens up about her priceless blind reaction to the photo of her husband in full Barbie gear during her appearance on The Talk. “It’s a funny photo and he’s trying to be funny, so it worked on all levels,” she says. “When I saw it—when he sent it to me from work—I was like, ‘Can I please have that underwear? Please, I never ask for anything.’ ”\n\nJune 2021: Eva says Ryan isn’t an Instagram boyfriend.\n\nIn response to a fan on Instagram, the actress reveals the reason none of her photos on Instagram have been taken by her husband. “How many of your photos are taken by Ryan?” one user comments on one of Mendes’s since-deleted Instagram posts of herself posing in a dress. “None that I post. My friends take them and I take theirs. It’s a girl thang,” Mendes replies.\n\nMendes has previously been transparent about her desire to keep intimate aspects of her relationship with her husband private. In an exchange with another fan on Instagram the previous March, she explained why she doesn’t feature more candid shots of Gosling on her Instagram account.\n\n“Wouldn’t mind an appearance by Ryan on this page,” the user commented, prompting Mendes to clear the air. She replied: “As far as Ryan, I’ll only post [flashbacks] of things that are already ‘out there’ (like pics from movies we did or stuff like that). My man and my kids are private. That’s important to me.”\n\nOctober 4, 2020: Eva says she’s content at home with Ryan.\n\nMendes shuts down a user on Instagram who comments that Gosling should be taking her out more. “Rather be home with my man than anywhere else in the world,” she says in response, on a throwback photo of herself running on the beach.\n\nApril 19, 2020: Eva clarifies why she doesn’t share more photos of Ryan.\n\nThe actress speaks about her appreciation for privacy when it comes to Gosling and their daughters.\n\n“I have always had a clear boundary when it comes to my man and my kids. I’ll talk about them of course, with limits, but I won’t post pictures of our daily life,” Mendes writes in a since-deleted post on Instagram. “Since my children are still so little and don’t understand what posting their image really means, I don’t have their consent. And I won’t post their image until they’re old enough to give me consent.”\n\nFebruary 12, 2020: Eva gushes over Ryan’s cooking skills.\n\nWhile the pair share domestic responsibilities, Mendes reveals that Gosling reigns over their kitchen. “Ryan is an amazing chef AND baker,” she replies to a user on Instagram inquiring about the couple’s cooking habits. “For real. Incredible.
