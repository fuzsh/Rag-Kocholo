        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfession Actor\n\nNew Zealand nationality\n\nBirth June 30, 1966\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAn actor of multiple origins (Hungarian on his father’s side, Danish and Irish on his mother’s side), Marton Csokas was born in the small town Invercargill, New Zealand. In 1986, he graduated from Toi Whakaari, the country’s leading drama school.\n\nThe beginning of his career was characterized by appearances in multiple television series, mainly “Shortland Street”, in which he played the role of Dr. Leonard Rossi-Dodds for two years. He had to wait until 1996 to appear for the first time in a feature film, Jack Brown Genius , a New Zealand science fiction film in which the young actor had the satisfaction of playing one of the main roles. He then made a series of films with different profiles, but without succeeding in leaving the borders of the archipelago: the romantic drama Broken English (1996), Hurrah (1998), the thriller Intimate Circle (2000) or even Rain (id.).\n\nThe year 2001, however, marked an acceleration in his career, when Peter Jackson arrived in New Zealand , then about to adapt JRR Tolkien ‘s trilogy . Marton Csokas was then given the role of the elf Celeborn in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring , a role he would return to three years later in the multi-Oscar winner Return of the King . This sudden exposure will allow the New Zealand actor to multiply projects, but also to extend his geographical ambitions by starring in a few American films, notably Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (in which he lends his voice to an extra-terrestrial), the very muscular xXx with Vin Diesel , the Australian-American comedy Kangaroo Jack or even Death in the Skin with Matt Damon in 2004 (where he plays a formidable assassin).\n\nIf he gives the impression of favoring action films ( Kingdom of Heaven by Ridley Scott , The Great Raid or even Æon Flux with Charlize Theron ), Marton Csokas does not hesitate to take on roles that are very different from each other. , and juggle genres as well as budgets and nationalities. We see him follow up the big Burtonian production Alice in Wonderland (2010) with the intimate drama The Tree (twice nominated for a César),The Rachel Singer Affair , before joining Daniel Craig , his little family and his haunted house in Dream House then slipping into the skin of a vampire in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012)."
