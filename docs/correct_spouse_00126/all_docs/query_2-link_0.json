        "text": "French actress (born 1980)\n\nFor the political scientist and political psychologist, see Eva G. T. Green.\n\nEva Gaëlle Green (French: [eva ɡa.ɛl ɡʁɛn], Swedish: [ˈêːva ˈɡreːn]; born (1980-07-06)6 July 1980) is a French actress. The daughter of actress Marlène Jobert, she began her career in theatre before making her film debut in Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers (2003). She portrayed Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem in Ridley Scott's historical epic Kingdom of Heaven (2005). The following year, she played Bond girl Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006), for which she received the BAFTA Rising Star Award.\n\nGreen has since starred in numerous independent films, including Cracks (2009), Womb (2010), and Perfect Sense (2011). In 2014, she played Artemisia in the 300 sequel 300: Rise of an Empire and Ava Lord in Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's Sin City sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. Green is also known for her collaborations with director Tim Burton, starring as Angelique Bouchard in the horror comedy film Dark Shadows (2012), the titular character of the fantasy film Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016), and Colette Marchant in the fantasy film Dumbo (2019). For her role as an astronaut mother in the drama film Proxima (2019), she earned a nomination for the César Award for Best Actress.\n\nGreen starred as Morgan Pendragon in the Starz historical fantasy series Camelot (2011). She also starred as Vanessa Ives in the Showtime horror drama series Penny Dreadful (2014–2016), earning critical acclaim and a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.\n\nEva Gaëlle Green[1] was born on 6 July 1980,[2][3] two minutes earlier than her fraternal twin sister Joy.[4] She is the daughter of French actress and author Marlène Jobert and Dr Walter Green, a Swedish dental surgeon[5][6][7] and occasional actor in his youth (Au Hasard Balthazar directed by Robert Bresson).[8][9]\n\nGreen is of Jewish descent[10][11][12][13] through her Algerian-born mother.[11][14][15][16] Green has described herself as \"a secular Jew who never attended synagogue as a girl\"[10][17] and feels \"like a citizen of the world\".[18][6] She has described her family as \"bourgeois\"[19] and has said that her sister is very different from her.[20] Green is naturally dark blonde; she has dyed her hair brown since she was 15 years old.[21] She is the great-granddaughter of French composer Paul Le Flem[22] and of Swedish photographer Mia Green,[23] the niece of actress Marika Green and the maternal first cousin of singer Elsa Lunghini and actress Joséphine Jobert.[24][25][26] The surname \"Green\" [ˈɡɾeːn] is derived from the Swedish word \"gren\", which means \"tree branch\".[27][28]\n\nGreen was raised in France and attended the American University of Paris, an English-speaking institution.[21] She also spent time between London and Ireland growing up.[29] She was quiet in school[20] and developed an interest in Egyptology when she visited the Louvre at age seven.[30] At age 14, after seeing Isabelle Adjani in The Story of Adele H., Green decided to become an actress. Her mother initially feared that an acting career would be too much for her sensitive daughter, but later came to support her ambitions.[29] Eva Green has a keen interest in psychology. She has mentioned in interviews that she finds the human mind fascinating and enjoys exploring complex characters with psychological depth in her roles.[31] Green continued her studies at Cours Eva Saint Paul in Paris[32] and took an acting course at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London.[6] After that, Green returned to Paris, where she performed in several plays.[29] Green stated that when she was in drama school, she \"always picked the really evil roles\" because \"it's a great way to deal with your everyday emotions\".[33]\n\nGreen appeared on stage in Jalousie en Trois Fax (2001) for which she was nominated for a Molière Award.[34] She also appeared in Turcaret (2002).\n\nIn 2002, Green had her film debut, when director Bernardo Bertolucci cast her for the role of Isabelle in The Dreamers (2003), which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and rear nude scenes as well as graphic sex scenes. Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause her career to \"have the same destiny as Maria Schneider\",[35] because of Schneider's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris.[29] Green said that with Bertolucci's guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes[36] but was embarrassed when her family saw the film.[29] Her performance was well-received, and some compared her to Liv Tyler.[37] Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, \"[T]here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex.\"[29] Her next film was Arsène Lupin (2004), in which she portrayed Lupin's love interest. She enjoyed the light-hearted role, although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters.[34]\n\nHer performance in The Dreamers led Ridley Scott to cast Green in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), a film about the Crusades where she played Sibylla, Princess of Jerusalem. Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began.[6] Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting, and she liked the film's ambiguity in approaching its subject matter.[33] To her disappointment, much of her screen time was cut.[6] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised her performance: \"She doesn't quite know what to do with her character's stilted dialogue, but she carries herself so regally that you barely notice.\"[38] Nev Pierce of the BBC, however, called her character \"limp\".[39] Green was satisfied when her character's complex subplot was restored in the director's cut.[40] Total Film said the new scenes completed her performance: \"In the theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or less, loses her mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a young son, but when she realizes he's afflicted with leprosy just like her brother Baldwin, she decides to take his life shortly after he's been crowned king.\"[41]\n\nGreen was considered for roles in The Constant Gardener (a role that went to Rachel Weisz) and The Black Dahlia.[29] She was cast at the last minute for the role of Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale.[30] Green was approached in mid-2005 but turned it down.[40] Principal photography was already underway, and director Martin Campbell said casting the role was difficult because \"we didn't have the final script and a Bond girl always had the connotation of tits 'n' ass.\" Campbell saw Green's performance in the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven,[42] and approached Green again. She read the script, and found the character of Vesper far deeper than most Bond girls.[40] Green's performance was well received: Entertainment Weekly called her the fourth-best Bond girl of all time;[43] IGN named her the best femme fatale, stating, \"This is the girl that broke – and therefore made – James Bond\";[44] and she won a BAFTA and an Empire award for her performance. Both awards were voted for by the British public.[45]\n\nGreen portrayed the witch Serafina Pekkala in the 2007 film adaptation of The Golden Compass. Green hoped the religious themes of the book would be preserved,[40] but references to Catholicism were removed from the film.[46] Green next appeared in Franklyn, as the tormented artist Emilia,[47] (who Green compared to real-life figures Sophie Calle and Tracey Emin)[48] and the mysterious Sally, who she described as, \"full of life, very witty, big sense of humor\".[49] She also filmed Cracks, the directorial debut of Jordan Scott, Ridley Scott's daughter, where she plays a teacher at a girls' school named Miss G, who falls in love with one of her pupils. In March 2009, she appeared in Womb, where she plays a woman who clones her dead boyfriend. It is a collaboration between actor Matt Smith and director Benedek Fliegauf.[50]\n\nShe was considered for the role eventually played by Cécile de France in Un Secret (2007).[51] Additionally, she was initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier's controversial film Antichrist (2009). According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film's pre-production process. Anglo-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role.[52] Green later said that she got along well with Trier, \"but then we started talking about nudity and sex and so on. It got a bit too far ... It was my dream to work with him, but it's a shame it was on that film that it nearly happened. I'm sure I would have been trashed doing that film\".[53]\n\nIn 2011, Green signed with United Talent Agency in the US, remaining represented by Tavistock Wood in the UK.[54] Green then starred in the first season of Starz's series, Camelot, as the sorceress Morgan le Fay.[55] Green stated, \"This is such an iconic story and you have 10 episodes to explore a character. It's not a girlfriend role that you could have in a movie. It's a real ballsy character. She has some guts.\"[56]\n\nIn 2014, she played Artemisia in the 300 sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire for which she received excellent reviews.[57] Rafer Guzman in his Newsday review stated, \"The one bright spot is Eva Green as Xerxes' machinator, Artemesia, a raccoon-eyed warrior princess... Green plays a snarling, insatiable, self-hating femme fatale and completely steals the show.\"[58] Stephanie Zacharek writing for The Village Voice exclaimed, \"Rise of an Empire might have been essentially more of the same, but for one distinction that makes it 300 times better than its predecessor: Mere mortals of Athens, Sparta, and every city from Mumbai to Minneapolis, behold the magnificent Eva Green, and tremble!\"[59]\n\nBetween May 2014 and 2016, Green starred in the Showtime horror drama series Penny Dreadful as Vanessa Ives.[60] Her performance earned her a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards. She also played the titular role of Ava Lord in the Sin City sequel film, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014).[61]\n\nIn 2016, Green reunited with Tim Burton in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, a film based on the 2011 novel by Ransom Riggs.[62] Green collaborated once more with Burton in Disney's 2019 live-action adaptation of Dumbo, co-starring with Colin Farrell and Michael Keaton. In 2018, she was appointed as a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an honorary award given by the French government.[63]\n\nIn 2019, she starred in the French drama film Proxima directed by Alice Winocour. Green's performance in the movie was met with critical acclaim and she was eventually nominated for the César Award for Best Actress.[64] In 2020, she starred as Lydia Wells in the BBC One miniseries The Luminaries, based on the 2013 novel by Eleanor Catton.[65]\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that Green would star in the sci-fi thriller film A Patriot.[66] In August 2020, it was reported that the actress, who was also an executive producer on the project, was suing the production company, White Lantern Film, because it had refused to pay her an £800,000 ($1.04 million) fee after the project was abandoned, and a pay-or-play contract had been agreed on. In its own suit, White Lantern claims Green derailed the film, e.g. demanding that additional expensive crew be hired. The company also claims Green owes it more than £1 million ($1.3 million) after walking away from the project.[67] Green won the lawsuit in April 2023.[68]\n\nDuring the lawsuit WhatsApp messages between Green and friends included references to her describing potential crew members as \"shitty peasants\", the production as a \"B-shitty-movie\" and producer Jake Seal as \"pure vomit\". However, the Judge found: \"She may have said some extremely unpleasant things about Mr Seal and his crew at Black Hangar, but this was borne from a genuine feeling of concern that any film made under Mr Seal’s control would be of very low quality and would not do justice to a script that she and the former directors were passionate about.\"[69][70]\n\nGreen appeared in Nocebo, a thriller produced by teams from Ireland and the Philippines, released on 4 November 2022 in the US and on 9 December 2022 in the UK and Ireland.[71] In June 2021, it was announced that Green would serve as the lead character in the British-French Apple TV+ series Liaison, co-starring Vincent Cassel.[72] The series premiered on 24 February 2023.[73]\n\nIn 2023, she portrayed Milady de Winter in two French film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas' 1844 novel The Three Musketeers; The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers: Milady, both directed by Martin Bourboulon.[74]\n\nGreen has been living in London since 2005,[75] and has stated that she is happier in England than in France.[76] \"The London parks, the people, the humour, it's a great place. You can tell by the different taxi drivers. London taxi drivers are polite and friendly. Parisian ones are just so unhappy. For them the world has too many problems,\" she said.[76]\n\nGreen considers herself \"nerdy\".[30] She also says, \"When people first meet me, they find me very cold... I keep myself at a distance, and I think that's why I'm so drawn to acting. It allows me to wear a mask.\"[4][17][30] She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she is not working. When asked in an interview what people would be surprised to find out about her, she responded, \"I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. Boring, huh?\"[77] Green has expressed interests in taxidermy and entomology; she collects preserved skulls and insects.[78][79]\n\nWhen asked about her preference to play graphic, sexually charged roles, Green described it as \"paradoxical\" given her self-confessed shyness. She commented humorously, \"I don't really understand why I do that. I need to go through therapy!\"[80] Green also favours dark, twisted characters, as they allow her to feel liberated. She spoke about her role in Penny Dreadful as, \"it's like I don't have a corset anymore when I'm playing Vanessa, you know? People will think that it's terrible to have fun in a show like that. But I do.\"[10] However, she has tried to take a variety of divergent roles in order to avoid being typecast.[10]\n\nGreen is non-religious Jewish, though she describes herself as \"very spiritual\" and having complex beliefs about supernatural forces.[10]\n\nGreen has expressed interest in returning to theatre.[36] She says she has no plans to work in Hollywood full-time because \"the problem with Hollywood is that the studios are super powerful, they have far more power than the directors... [my] ambition at this moment is just to find a good script\".[81]\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, she was in a romantic relationship with her Kingdom of Heaven co-star Marton Csokas.[82]\n\nIn 2017, she revealed that Harvey Weinstein made an inappropriate advance during a business meeting but she \"pushed him off\".[83]\n\nKey † Denotes works that have not yet been released\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2001 The Piano Teacher Walter's friend Uncredited 2003 The Dreamers Isabelle 2004 Arsène Lupin Clarisse de Dreux-Soubise 2005 Kingdom of Heaven Sibylla, Princess of Jerusalem 2006 Casino Royale Vesper Lynd 2007 The Golden Compass Serafina Pekkala 2008 Franklyn Emilia Bryant / Sally 2009 Cracks Miss G 2010 Womb Rebecca 2011 Perfect Sense Susan 2012 Dark Shadows Angelique Bouchard 2014 White Bird in a Blizzard Eve Connors 300: Rise of an Empire Artemisia The Salvation Madelaine Sin City: A Dame to Kill For Ava Lord 2016 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children Miss Alma Peregrine 2017 Based on a True Story Elle Euphoria Emilie 2019 Dumbo Colette Marchant Proxima Sarah Loreau 2022 Nocebo Christine 2023 The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan Milady de Winter The Three Musketeers: Milady TBA Dirty Angels † Jake\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 Camelot Morgan Pendragon 10 episodes 2014–2016 Penny Dreadful Vanessa Ives 27 episodes 2020 The Luminaries Lydia Wells 6 episodes 2023 Liaison Alison Rowdy 6 episodes\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2008 007: Quantum of Solace Vesper Lynd Voice\n\nAssociation Year Category Work Result Ref(s) British Academy Film Awards 2007 Rising Star Award — Won [84] César Awards 2020 Best Actress Proxima Nominated [64] Chlotrudis Awards 2015 Best Supporting Actress White Bird in a Blizzard Nominated [85] Critics' Choice Television Awards 2015 Best Actress in a Drama Series Penny Dreadful Nominated [86] 2016 Nominated [87] Empire Awards 2007 Best Female Newcomer Casino Royale Won [88] European Film Awards 2004 Jameson People's Choice Award for Best Actress The Dreamers Nominated [89] Fangoria Chainsaw Awards 2015 Best TV Actress Penny Dreadful Nominated [90] 2016 Won [91] 2017 Nominated [92] Golden Globe Awards 2016 Best Actress – Television Series Drama Nominated [93] IFTA Film & Drama Awards 2007 Best International Actress – People's Choice Casino Royale Nominated [94] Lumières Awards 2020 Best Actress Proxima Nominated [95] National Movie Awards 2007 Best Female Performance Casino Royale Nominated [96] Satellite Awards 2015 Best Actress – Television Series Drama Penny Dreadful Nominated [97] Saturn Awards 2007 Best Supporting Actress Casino Royale Nominated [98] Teen Choice Awards 2005 Choice Movie: Liplock (shared with Orlando Bloom) Kingdom of Heaven Nominated [99] Choice Movie: Love Scene (shared with Orlando Bloom) Nominated 2017 Choice Movie: Fantasy Actress Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children Nominated [100]"
