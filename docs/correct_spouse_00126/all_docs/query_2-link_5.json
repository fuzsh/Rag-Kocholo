If I inspire him, he never told me. This is not his style: he is shy, modest, extremely sensitive. I loved my roles in Dark Shadows and Miss Peregrine, two supernatural and weird characters. The next one, the acrobat in Dumbo, is a little less colourful. To play her, I had to face vertigo and my fear of heights. I underwent a three-month preparation with circus people, wonderful people, so happy when they work so hard. I took so much liking in it that, when the film finished shooting, it became a hobby: I continue to attend the circus school of London each week. I love to make efforts, sweat, reconcile my head and my muscles: today, we have lost all contact with our animality, and that is a shame, especially for actors.”\n- Eva Green on Tim Burton dating rumours and her preparation to play Colette Marchant in Dumbo\n\n#EvaGreen by © @arnaudpyvka for @madamefigarofr (November 9, 2018)\n\nCreative Director: @franckbenhamou\nInterview: @richardgianorio \nHair: @kenorourke1 using @cwhairlondon products\nMake-Up: @lisaeldridgemakeup\n\nFake fur and wool coat: @yproject_official\nHigh jewelry necklace in white gold, onyx and diamonds: @bulgariofficial Wild Pop\n\nShot on location in Rome, Italy.\n\nRead the interview (in French) at the link in bio.\".",
