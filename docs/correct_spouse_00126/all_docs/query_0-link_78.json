        "text": "Make a list of the most versatile French actresses in Hollywood and Eva Green is certain to rank very high. Within just a few years of her professional acting career, Eva became a household name after her flawless portrayal of Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem in Kingdom of Heaven (2005). TV buffs will also best recognize the actress for her role as Morgan Pendragon on Starzâs Camelot\n\nShe cemented her fame after playing Bond girl Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale (2006). This role earned him the BAFTA Rising Star Award and Green has been on the rise ever since. Sheâs become a frequent collaborator with award-winning filmmaker Tim Burton and rumors are swirling that the two are even a romantic coupleâ¦more on that.\n\nLetâs discuss everything to know about her from her early years in the industry to her very private romantic life.\n\nEva Green Bio (Facts), age\n\nEva GaÃ«lle Green was born on July 6, 1980 in Paris, France, to Walter Green and MarlÃ¨ne Jobert. Green comes from multiple origins, Jewish, Breton, Swedish and Algerian. Both of Greenâs parents were actors. MarlÃ¨ne Jobert, his mother, recorded more success than his father.\n\nEva Green, at intervals in her life, grew up in Paris, London and Ireland. She was a very shy and introverted child, often spending time alone indoors. The young girl was inspired to try acting in the cinema at the age of 14 after watching The Story of Adele H., a 1975 French historical film. Her decision scared her mother, who was suspicious of what that his highly sensitive daughter gets the huge exposure associated with acting. Green told the media that it was his composure that made him choose to play as it allowed him to wear a mask.\n\nThe talented actress attended the English-Speaking American University in Paris and studied acting at St. Paul Drama School in Paris. She also trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Green began her career in Parisian theaters before landing her first film role as Isabelle Les rÃªveurs. She received wide acclaim for the role opening her doors to a career that quickly transformed her into an international star.\n\nOther films she has acted in since then include The Golden Compass as Serafina Pekkala, Perfect Sense as Susan, Sin City: A Lady to Kill as the character Ava Lord and Colette Marchant as Dumbo\n\nTwin sisters\n\nWhen Eva Green came into the world, she wasaccompanied by a twin. Two minutes after she was born, her fraternal twin sister Joy Green followed. Eva described her sister as very different from her. The difference is not only in the character but also in the appearance. Eva and Joy are not identical. Joy Green studied business at university and now resides in Normandy, France with her husband, the Italian Count. Evaâs twin sister has a weakness for horses and raises them in Normandy. The Green sisters were born with natural dark blonde hair, however, Eva has been dyed black since she was 15 years old.\n\nBoyfriend, is she married?\n\nEvaâs often quiet and reserved roles come naturally to her, the actress in real life is a very reserved and somewhat secretive person. Itâs a personal trait that doesnât sit well with the media that meddles in the personal lives of celebrities.\n\nIs she married? many of his fans are wondering. As far as we know, the smoky-eyed actress is still single.\n\nLuckily for all of us, Green has already spoken publicly about his love life. In her interview with GARTH PEARCE, Green talked about how she gives her all when she falls in love and relationships require hard work, especially after the early stages of losing passion.\n\nIn the same interview, Eva Green opened up about her experience dating actor Yann Claassen back when she was filming his 2003 film, The Dreamers. She told how Claassen would be jealous of her when she got a new job and how she got tired of talking about her man when she didnât have one. According to the actress, their relationship lasted only a few years. Green concluded the interview by suggesting that sometimes itâs better to be single.\n\nAlthough Green hasnât spoken about her love life since then, reports have surfaced that she started dating her Kingdom of Heaven co-star Marton Csokas in 2005 and were together until 2007.\n\nGreenâs biggest, and perhaps most shocking, relationship rumor is his connection to Tim Burton. She starred in her first Burton film Dark Shadows in 2012 and the two have remained suspiciously close, and were even seen going out for dinner together. However, sources told W Magazine that Eva was just Burtonâs new face and nothing more. As expected, Green did not comment on the rumors.\n\nHeight, body measurement\n\nThe talented actress stands at a height of 5 feet 7 inches, she weighs 56 kg with body measurements of 34-24-35 inches being bust hips and waist, respectively. She has blue eyes and notices dark blond hair color.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGidppZ6qL7EnqVmr5mgtm7A1qKlZquZqMGmvoybprKeop6yr7CMmp6eZZiatqi002aZqJypYrqmrdKuqZ6llaPBbrXSZqqhnV2irrO%2ByJ6baA%3D%3D"
