        "text": "Leonardo DiCaprio started dating hot 25-year-olds back in the roaring ’90s and...truly nothing has changed! Other than the people he’s dating, of course, because lord knows this man won’t stay with someone once they show any signs of aging. On that note, we’re taking a look back at Leonardo DiCaprio’s dating history, which is almost as long as the wrinkle on my forehead that would probably horrify him.\n\n1994: Bridget Hall\n\nLeo and Bridget were linked very early in his career, although she told New York magazine that “nothing happened” in 1998, denying previous claims that she’d once said, “He was lousy in bed. The sex was bad.”\n\n1995: Naomi Campbell\n\nLike most of the model romances he had in the roaring ’90s, Naomi and Leo’s relationship was both very rumored and very brief. Unlike most of the models he dated in the roaring ’90s, they’ve stayed close friends over the years!\n\n1996—1997: Kristen Zang\n\nKristen actually spoke out about her relationship with Leo to People last year, saying, “It was a different time back then. We could go places and not be followed by the paparazzi. It was 1995 and he was making a movie called Marvin’s Room. I remember vividly while visiting him on the set, watching the O.J. Simpson verdict while in Meryl Streep’s trailer. It was a surreal moment for a Michigan country bumpkin like myself.”\n\nShe added, “I visited Leo for long periods of time on various sets in different countries. I loved his friends and he loved mine. We were like one big happy family. Leo was a very sweet and thoughtful boyfriend. We also had some hard times like all couples do and broke up for a bit in 1997 and then got back together. Then, about 4 months after my 25th birthday (ha, I know what you’re thinking), it was over for good.”\n\nFYI, she’s the one who ended it!\n\n1997: Amber Valletta\n\nA story in three parts: Leo saw Amber in a magazine, he was smitten, and they briefly dated. But the two never confirmed it themselves, FYI.\n\n1997: Helena Christensen\n\nHelena and Leo were linked together in the ’90s, but again...no actual evidence that they dated due to the internet not being a big thing yet. Tabloids could only do so much, ya know?\n\n1998: Eva Herzigová\n\nThese two met at the premiere of The Man in the Iron Mask (lol), and according to The Mirror Eva mused, “He’s a wonderful person. Our first night was a really nice experience. He is a very kind person and full of energy.”\n\n2000: Virginie LeDoyen\n\nLeo and his The Beach costar were rumored to be dating during filming, but that may have just been tabloid speculation. Especially since Virginie had this to say to The Guardian about that time in her life: “The whole thing was really aggressive. I guess I was very, but the violence of the attention took my breath away. I tried to laugh it off, because if you don’t laugh, you start crying. And then you’ll never stop.” She added, “DiCaprio’s life is the perfect example of how not to be. I would not wish his life on anybody. I can understand how it might seem a bit flattering to be in every newspaper and to have everyone imagining how your life must be. But frankly it’s not.”\n\n2000—2005: Gisele Bündchen\n\nThese two dated for five entire years! Their respective ages at the time of their split? Leo was 30, Gisele was...you guessed it! 25. She wrote about their breakup in her book, saying, “No longer numbing myself with smoking, drinking and too much work, I was becoming more and more aware of things that I’d chosen not to look at. Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same? In the end, unfortunately, the answer was yes.”\n\n2005—2010: Bar Rafaeli\n\nApparently, Bar and Leo met at a party for U2—as ya do—and dated on and off for about five years before splitting up when he was 36 and she was (what else?) 25. “Leo was getting a lot of pressure from friends, family, and Bar to take the next step in their relationship and get married,” a source told E! News via Today. “He wasn’t ready for that.”\n\n2011: Blake Lively\n\nBlake and Leo only dated for a few months after his split from Bar (Blake was 26 at the time), and E! News said that “distance” and “timing” were the reasons why the actors ended things.\n\n2012: Erin Heatherton\n\nThirty-seven-year-old Leo and 23-year-old Erin dated for almost a year, and the split was drama-free. E! News actually asked Erin about it at an event and she said, “I having the best time right now, here at the Victoria’s Secret show. I couldn’t feel more beautiful with all my friends. It’s wonderful.”\n\n2013: Toni Garrn\n\nLeo and Toni split after about a year, and TBD what went wrong because they kept things suuuuper private. But, yeah, their breakup may or may not have happened after Leo was seen leaving a Miami nightclub with 20 women ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\n2016: Kelly Rohrbach\n\nAfter several months of romantic Citi Biking around NYC, Kelly and Leo broke up when he was 41 and she was 25 because of, like, timing? Or something? A source told People, “They are very friendly and it’s super amicable. They are both so busy and he’s got a big movie coming out and she’s one of the biggest supermodels in the world.”\n\n2016—2017: Nina Agdal\n\nLeo and Nina were together for almost exactly a year until a source confirmed their breakup with a very familiar statement to People, saying, “Nina and Leo have parted ways. It is amicable. They remain friends.”\n\n2017—2022: Camila Morrone\n\nThese two dated for way longer than usual for Leo, and an anonymous source even told People that Leo was “very in love and serious” and he and Camila had “talked about getting engaged.” Camila even spoke about their much-discussed age gap, telling Vulture, “Negative comments don’t stop because you address them. I felt like being like, ‘You guys suck! This sucks. You guys are really mean.’ I probably won’t address it again. Because then you open floodgates for people to judge you. I’ve learned more and more to just protect myself and avoid things that’ll hurt my feelings.”\n\nAlas, things ended in August 2022, and a source told E! News that “distance played a factor,” adding the relationship “ran its course.” At this point, the internet obviously began noticing a...trend!\n\n2022: Victoria Lamas\n\nLeo and 24-year-old Victoria were spotted on what appeared to be a date in West Hollywood in late December 2022, and then two seconds later, her dad blew up her spot during an interview with the New York Post.\n\nAhem: “I know she likes him very much,” Lorenzo mused. “I think they met last month. I’m not sure of the circumstances, but that’s what she told me...She’s very smitten. I told her to treat the relationship like a holiday—just enjoy it as much as you can for as long as it lasts. And if it lasts for more than a typical holiday, great. But if not, then just guard your heart, you know? Because she’s very young.”\n\n2022: (Maybe) Eden Polani\n\nFYI, Leo was most recently linked to a 20-year-old model named Eden Polani, which lead Twitter to spiral:\n\nBut a source shut this narrative down to People saying they “just so happened to have been seated next to each other at the party and were hanging in the same group…Just because Leo might be talking to or sitting with a girl doesn’t mean he’s dating her.”\n\n2022—2023: Gigi Hadid\n\nLeo and Gigi were first linked back in September 2022, when a source told Us Weekly that Leo had his “sights set” on her (alarming way to put it, but okay). Things appeared to have fizzled by January 2023, however, with a source telling Entertainment Tonight, “Leo and Gigi have enjoyed their time together when they’re able to see each other, but when they’re busy with various commitments, they’re doing their own things and they are not exclusive.”However, these two wound up going back and forth for a few more months, so to read all about where they stand more recently, head right on over this way:\n\nP.S. The supermodel seems to have moved on to Bradley Cooper, which... iconic!\n\n2023—Now: Vittoria Ceretti\n\nAccording to sources, Leo and Vittoria reportedly met during the Killers of the Flower Moon premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. (The actor stars in the Martin Scorsese–directed film opposite Lily Gladstone.) Shortly thereafter, the rumored couple was spotted publicly together (!!) in August for the first time during an afternoon ice cream date in Los Angeles. Oh, and a witness told Page Six at the time that they’d sensed a “vibe” between actor and model, which is the only way I would want me and a rumored fling to be described, TBH. “The way they were talking to each other, you could feel the energy,” the insider added.\n\nWhat followed was a series of hot and heavy outings, including a September 6 “make-out in late-night Ibiza club romp.” “Vittoria is a beautiful girl, but Leonardo is of course surrounded by many beautiful girls most of the time,” a source told the Daily Mail about the sitch just a day after the outing. “But he adores her and she him, they have been spending a lot of time together this summer, traveling around on romantic trips.” Well! Then!\n\nFast-forward to September 22, 2023 and Page Six reported that the rumored couple’s ’ship is much more than a “passing fling.” Per a source who spoke with the outlet, “They’ve been spending quite a bit of time together over the past few months, and they’re enjoying getting to know one another on a deeper level.”\n\nOh, and more recently, the actor and model were spotted sharing a NSFW moment outside of a Halloween party (JFYI, Leo was dressed as...well, Leo complete with his signature 🧢) when Vittoria *checks notes* grabbed his butt in a cheeky (heh) gesture. For all the pics, head right on over this way.\n\nBy November 2023, a source told Us Weekly that Leo is “completely smitten” with Vittoria and that \"it's going so well that Leo’s actually being exclusive. Vittoria is all he thinks about.\"\n\nThe source added, \"He says she’s not only gorgeous, but super down-to-earth, and they have a ton in common. She’s not intimidated by his fame at all—she even makes fun of it, ‘the model and the movie star.’ Leo finds it refreshing.\"\n\nAnd there you have it, folks! We’ll be updating this with...whoever Leo dates next!"
