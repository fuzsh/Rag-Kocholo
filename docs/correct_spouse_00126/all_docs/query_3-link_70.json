        "text": "Category: Marton Csokas\n\nAugustus Prew is a London-born actor who started his career as a child, getting his first big break in the acclaimed film About a Boy, followed by appearances in several TV shows. His next big film role was that of Robin De Noir in The Secret of Moonacre, where he plays a rather eccentrically dressed young man who looks surprisingly like a Lost Boy.\n\nContinue reading “Amazon Casting: Augustus Prew”\n\nEXCLUSIVE – Deadline hinted first but TheOneRing.net can confirm that Elijah Wood will step in front of Peter Jackson’s cameras and return to Middle-earth for a part in ‘The Hobbit,’ — and we even know how. Despite how some fans will respond at first, the reasons are organic and natural and might not upset some of the most ardent purists.\n\n***MAJOR HOBBIT MOVIE SPOILERS AFTER THE BREAK*** Continue reading “Elijah Wood will be in ‘The Hobbit’ (and we know how!)”\n\nWhat was the real reason that Galadriel and Celeborn wanted no visitors in Lothlorien?\n\n[Join the Discussion!]\n\nLiv Tyler turns 31 today and Marton Csokas’ birthday was yesterday; he turned 42. Liv, who has been acting in films since the early 90s, graced the screen as Arwen in all three Lord of the Rings movies. Her latest role was that of Betty Ross in The Incredible Hulk which opened in U.S. theaters on June 13. Marton, who played the lord of Lothlorien, Celeborn, in The Fellowship of the Ring, has enjoyed a long and successful film career in New Zealand and internationally and was last seen in Romulus my Father, released in Australia in 2007. Many happy returns to both of these fine actors!\n\nMary writes in that Marton Csokas can currently be seen in the off-Broadway production of Shakespeare’s “Antony and Cleopatra” put on by the Theater for a New Audience in New York. From the New York Times review: “Marton Csokas, a New Zealander making his New York stage debut as Antony, is likewise a well-trained classical actor with a dexterous grasp of the language.” The production is set to run until May 2, 2008. Read the full review\n\nAsylum stars Natasha Richardson in an unsettling psychological thriller about the repressed, 1950s wife of a psychiatrist and her affair with a convicted killer (Marton Csokas). Stella, Max, and their son Charlie move to a high-security psychiatric hospital, where the priggish Max joins the staff and hopes to ascend, in time, to the top spot, replacing the soon-to-retire hospital director. Standing in Max’s way is another doctor, Cleave (Ian McKellen), who takes a quiet yet somehow sinister interest in unhappy Stella’s apparent attraction to Edgar (Csokas). [More]"
