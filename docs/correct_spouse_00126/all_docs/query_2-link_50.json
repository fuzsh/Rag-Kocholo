Bayona, Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino, Japanese director Kore-eda Hirokazu, Lebanese writer/director Nadine Labaki and Turkish screenwriter and photographer Ebru Ceylan.\n\nKore-eda has premiered several of his movies at Cannes, most recently last year's Monster, which won the Best Screenplay award. His movie Shoplifters won the coveted Palme d'Or in 2018.\n\nIn addition, Labaki's film Capernaum won the Jury Prize in 2018, and Ceylan co-wrote Winter Sleep, which won the Palme d'Or in 2014.\n\nThis year's competition features Megalopolis by Francis Ford Coppola, Kinds of Kindness by Yorgos Lanthimos, David Cronenberg's The Shrouds and Paul Schrader's Oh, Canada, among many more titles.\n\nThe 2024 Cannes Film Festival kicks off on 14 May and the winners will be announced during the closing ceremony on 25 May."
