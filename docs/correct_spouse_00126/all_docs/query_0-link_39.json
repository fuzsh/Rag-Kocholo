        "text": "Gasping for a fag and with a little dog nibbling at her ankles, Eva Green is doing a rubbish job of promoting her new film.\n\n'My part is not really big, big in this one,' the French actress says in her mellifluous but clipped English. She's talking, distractedly, about The Golden Compass, the Hollywood blockbuster adaptation of Northern Lights, the first book in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Green plays Serafina Pekkala, the flying witch queen who comes to the rescue of adolescent heroine Lyra Belacqua. But as Green is yet to see the film, she's unable, or unwilling, to talk at length about it.\n\nShe's also tired, it seems, and no wonder: she's just back from a two-day trip to Australia to see her boyfriend, Kiwi actor Marton Csokas. They met while making Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven. He's appearing on stage in Sydney in Riflemind, directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. 'I know, I was completely mad - I spent more time in the air,' she says of her love-dash. But it was, patently, worth it.\n\n'They're promoting The Golden Compass like Lord of the Rings, you know, that kind of thing,' the 27-year-old continues, 'and the second [script] hasn't been written yet. But in the second and third books my part is more important. So, yeah, we'll see. They're still shooting in Budapest. I have to do ADR [additional dialogue recording] again tomorrow - for the third time. But it has to be released. It comes out in four weeks! So it's quite...'\n\nGreen stops and gives a shrug that I'm obliged to describe as Gallic.\n\n'We'll see, we'll see,' she muses. 'We'll see what it is.'\n\nLyra first encounters Serafina on page 302 of the prize-winning, 399-page book. Pullman describes her as having 'a voice so like the high wild singing of the aurora itself that Lyra could hardly hear the sense for the sweet sound of it.'\n\n'Eva,' I ask, 'how do you \"act\" that?'\n\nGreen laughs and lets out a wineglass-shattering squeal. Luckily, the ornate heritage-pub in which we've met this lunchtime - it's in Maida Vale in northwest London, just round the corner from her new flat in posho Little Venice - is deserted. She sounds less like an aurora-aping witch-diva than that bloke out of the Darkness. Tethered under his mistress's chair, Scottish border terrier Griffin cocks an alarmed head.\n\n'Of course I can't do that,' Green says of Serafina's voice. 'How can you do that? It's all my presence and my acting,' she purrs, sarkily, before acknowledging that, yes, however, in the film she does do a lot of flying - even though she's no fan of heights - and can now use a bow and arrow with some aplomb. 'I talk in like a Norwegian/Rrrrrussian accent,' she adds, rolling her Rs Slavonically, 'something like that.'\n\nIs she in the film more than her character is in the book?\n\n'Me? No, not much! It's a strong character because she is helping Lyra, and more like the mother to Lyra than Mrs Coulter [played by Nicole Kidman]. She's teaching her a lot of ...; things like - I'm gonna sound terrible - but how to love and things like that.'\n\nAnd what about Lord Asriel - a towering but largely background figure in Northern Lights, played in the film by a beardy Daniel Craig - is he in the film more? 'They've made his part very important because he's Daniel. But Serafina is a strong character who becomes bigger in the second book. So, yeah,' Green laughs... 'why am I doing this interview now?'\n\nWell, because she says things like that. Because she was fantastic in Casino Royale, a reinvented Bond girl for a rebooted 007, and she was a revelation in her screen debut, Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers - and not solely on account of her getting naked, a lot. Because in The Golden Compass, a film bristling with armoured bears and 'daemons' and weaponised zeppelins and arctic wastelands and heroic acting from Kidman and Craig, ice-cool, Kohl-eyed Green is the thing you watch. No wonder Pullman's story has been tweaked to get her onscreen a lot earlier.\n\nAnd because Eva Green tells it like it is. She's not needy (like so many young Hollywood stars), but borderline haughty (just as classic Euro-fatales are meant to be). Golden Compass director Chris Weitz, who cast Green before he'd seen Casino Royale, based his decision on 'a gut feeling. All I'd seen her in was The Dreamers, which makes it seem like I just ogled her - but I thought her performance was very good. She just felt right for Serafina, and part of the reason is that there's something quite unplaceable about her, although she's obviously French - her comportment is different from a lot of actresses in Hollywood. I don't think she's particularly interested in battling her way through the Olympics that is being a beautiful young actress in the movie industry.' Of her participation in The Golden Compass, Green says bluntly: 'It's quite prestigious. It's a witch - that's quite cool! I feel like a little girl. I loved the books, they're beautiful. The third one, The Amber Spyglass, the land of the dead and the harpies...' she sighs appreciatively. Then, the shrug again. 'And I had no scripts, and you need to work.'\n\nThe Golden Compass is a very big deal. Pullman's multimillion-selling trilogy has long been touted as a children's book series of a darker, more heavyweight stripe, an intense, lyrical and powerfully anti-religious saga. Now that CGI technology is sufficiently advanced, His Dark Materials - in which every human character has an accompanying daemon; this, reports Green, meant a tonne of green-screen-acting - is ripe for adaptation. Following the success of the Harry Potter film franchise, and of Peter Jackson's billions-raking Tolkien adaptations, and with the Narnia adaptations proceeding apace, Lord of the Rings producers New Line have swung wholeheartedly behind The Golden Compass, to the tune of $180m, double the budget of the first Rings film.\n\n'New Line, they're quite heavy,' Green says. 'Five producers on set the whole time. They want it to be for children to see. And I talked to the New Line person this morning and he said, \"Yeah, children...\" So there's a scene [in the book] where there's a child dying on the ice, a beautiful scene, but you know, you have to make compromises, so that's not in the movie. It can't be the same onscreen; the book is never the same. But this is so rich, you have too many things, so you have to make some sacrifices I suppose... treat it as a different piece.'\n\nHow does she feel that the all-powerful and sinister Magisterium is no longer just a religious entity, as it is in the book, but a more general authoritative body? That the atheistic sentiment of Pullman - a vocal opponent of the Christian doctrine within CS Lewis's Narnia chronicles - has been watered down?\n\n'That's a real tricky question,' Green says slowly. 'Because it's a book, and we're trying to reach a big audience, I don't know how they're gonna treat it. I know the Magisterium is present...' She stops. 'I don't think I want to talk about it. But it is present. But it's a very tricky subject and I'm not very good at talking about the...' Another halt. Green would rather admit she's unsure than blather platitudes and generalities. 'They don't want to say it's an anti-Christian thing,' she concludes eventually. 'So I'm just gonna shut up about that.'\n\nI first met Eva Green a year ago in Paris, to discuss her role as Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale. The film's release was still a couple of months off, she hadn't seen it, and no one knew how good - or otherwise - this thoroughly modern Bond would be.\n\nThe film's director Martin Campbell told me at the time that 'the studio' had been worried about Green's accent - Vesper Lynd had to speak with a cut-glass English accent. 'But she worked her arse off,' he said. 'The accent was never a problem, she was an extremely hard-working, professional actress, and she just knuckled down and did it.' Onset, he added, Green was 'very shy, very quiet. Keeps to herself. All she had was her dog, and her dialect coach. So often with American stars you get all sorts of entourage... The Vesper in the Casino Royale book has this almost mysterious, dark quality. Bond reflects on the fact that you can't quite get to grips with her, you never quite get to know her. Eva has that quality. I was thrilled to have her, and boy did she deliver.'\n\nGreen admitted she'd been nervous about taking the role. She was at the time best known for her performance in The Dreamers, specifically for her full-frontal nudity and the explicit sex scenes. Even though Lynd is a brainy Treasury official, Green didn't want to add 'babe-in-bikini' to her CV, to be 'typecast as the Bond girl - and after The Dreamers you have to be careful,' she said.\n\nBut she had been impressed by the character nuances in the Casino Royale script. 'It shows Bond as a human being rather than the killing machine and the - how do I say \"fuck\" without being rude? - the making love to women... But, yeah, Bond and Vesper just fall in love. I hope it will draw a lot of women,' she said last year. 'We'll see.'\n\nAs it turned out, Casino Royale was a huge success. Can Green remember a specific point when she discovered that her - and the producers' - gamble had paid off?\n\n'When it made money,' she smiles. 'My agent called and said it: \"Oh, it made how-many-millions in the opening weekend in America.\" This is how it works. We were promoting it somewhere, in New York I think, and Barbara Broccoli [daughter of Bond franchise founder Cubby] was excited because the journalists had responded well to it. And to Daniel! Because of all the shit that was happening at the time,' she says, referring to the pre-release mutterings about 'Blond Bond' and 'James Bland', 'so they were very relieved. But yeah, in England it was'- she whispers intensely, seriously - '\"the best Bond ever!\"'\n\nShe says that, contrary to heated internet rumour, she will not be reappearing in the as-yet-untitled 'Bond 22'. For a start, Vesper Lynd is dead. But Bond will try to have his little revenge for her death, pursuing Lynd's duplicitous Algerian boyfriend. 'So, yes there will be pictures [of Vesper] and things like that. I don't know who the Bond girl's gonna be. I'm a bit jealous! I hope it will be terrible,' she lies. 'I will be the love of his life!'\n\nHaving worked with Daniel Craig on The Golden Compass, how does she think he's changed since becoming Bond?\n\n'He's working like a dog. He really wants to prove that he can do other stuff. He's working on [second world war resistance drama] Defiance at the moment. It's great for him. I mean, everyone wants him. Independent movies, Jim Jarmusch, anything. He doesn't have \"the Bond curse\" at all. He's great. He deserves it.'\n\nEarlier this year Green won the Rising Star award at the Bafta (no actor had ever been nominated for playing Bond himself before Craig). Casino Royale, she concedes, 'did me a lot of good'. But it has cast a long shadow.\n\n'It's so difficult to find good parts, really, really hard. People don't know how to place me,' she thinks, which echoes what Chris Weitz said about her, albeit more negatively. 'Now I receive a lot of... Like, I received something so similar to the Bond thing: \"she ends up in an elevator under water\" - it's a fucking joke. \"She's very mysterious...\" No no no no no!' So she turns these (presumably lucrative) parts down. But at the same time, she sighs, 'I need to earn some money.'\n\nGreen's pragmatic, sweary, pas de merde approach to her job is probably down to her parents. Her Swedish dad Walter Green, who came to France when he was 16, is a dentist who is 'not really a dreamer' and who stays firmly out of her acting world. Her Algerian-French mum, Marlene Jobert, was a successful actor in her day. Now a children's author, she gave up stage and screen when she had Eva and ...; her non-identical twin sister (Joy is 'very different' from Eva; a business school graduate who loves horses, she lives in Normandy with her husband, an Italian count). Mum warned her daughter that acting was a cruel and unsteady business; now, if Green ever gets stressed about work, Mme Jobert is, it seems, dismissive: 'Oh my God, you see, you're crying, this is your fault, you chose that fucking job,' Green recounts with a delighted cackle.\n\nAs a child growing up in Paris, Green's favourite subject was English, although she fancied a career as an Egyptologist. Why? '[It's] very mysterious,' she says. 'Maybe it's not like this but I feel like you would go to Egypt and you would discover something!'\n\nBut at 16 she took a theatre class at school and was smitten. A two-month stint at London's Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art was followed by three years on a drama course at the Eva St Paul School in Paris. 'It's good because it's very small,' she says of the school. 'It's not like a big machine and everybody gets drowned.' Green is still in regular contact with Eva St Paul herself, and regularly seeks her advice on how to prepare for roles.\n\nAfter graduation she worked in French theatre then, in 2002, was offered the part in The Dreamers, a story of decadent youth getting their rocks off during the political upheaval of May 1968. The film was produced by Jeremy Thomas, who is also producer on Green's next film, Franklyn, an edgy-sounding film set in both London and a 'parallel' world. Green plays two characters, one of whom is a Tracey Emin-style video artist. 'I know that Jeremy and Bernardo [Bertolucci] thought they'd found someone really special,' says Gerald McMorrow, Franklyn's writer-director. 'One of Bernardo's famous quotes about Eva was that \"she's so beautiful it's indecent\". But I know he wouldn't have asked her to be in the movie if she hadn't been great.'\n\nGreen visibly brightens when she talks about Franklyn, which she's just finished shooting. 'It's a low-budget movie, independent, very different from The Golden Compass. It's more like a director's movie - even Ridley Scott had the studios behind him.\n\n'It's impossible to summarise the plot,' she says excitedly as we move outside the pub so she can spark up an American Spirit. 'It's crazy. I play sort of three characters - schizophrenic a bit. She's quite surreal and has red hair and is ethereal, a bit like Mary Poppins. Which is the opposite of my other character, who's very tormented and, you know, wants to kill herself all the time. We all,' she says darkly, 'have those people inside.'\n\n'Eva was the only person who could play the part,' McMorrow says firmly. 'She's not only playing two very opposite parts but someone who is multi-layered. The character has this beautiful artistic quality, and the erudite nature of someone who is also completely misplaced. You can't quite figure out where she's from.'\n\nFor her part, Green is especially pleased that McMorrow let her script two performance videos that her artist character creates in the film - 'rather tricky and moving conversations she has with herself by way of video monitors,' says the director.\n\n'My heart is really in it,' enthuses Green. 'It's very challenging, a bit like Michel Gondry [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind], that kind of thing. I love it, because we can go mad, in make-up, hair, I've never done that before.'\n\nWell, not onscreen she hasn't. But in the real world, Green is famous - infamous even - for her rather daring approach to fashion. In July, at the Dior couture show at Versailles, to celebrate the fashion house's 30th anniversary, Green upstaged the models in a shocking pink kimono. Designer John Galliano had given her the pick of his collection, so Green turned up like a goth-geisha. Even Helena Bonham Carter might have considered it a bonkers look too far. The celeb mags were duly outraged.\n\n'I love that outfit!' Green declares defiantly. 'But yes, it was quite controversial. But I love [that] people were shocked. People magazine said I was the worst-dressed!' she adds with evident pride. My publicist was so shocked - they gave me a whole page! I love going a bit crazy.'\n\nHer Bafta frock - red and sheer - was another goodie, with 'event' hairstyle to match. What look was she going for - bride of Frankenstein? 'I love it!' she says. 'It's quite... the Cure. When you have a dress that's not conventional, quite hot colours... I like going a bit rock.'\n\nFashion, the red carpet, photoshoots: they're ridiculous, thinks Eva Green. Why not have a good time? The alternative is 'very boring - be yourself, wear a black dress, smile...' Green shudders at the very thought.\n\nStill, she must be doing something right. The house of Dior has made her the 'face' of perfume Midnight Poison. The accompanying advert, in which a begowned Green floats about as rock band Muse hammer away in the background, was directed by auteur Wong Kar-Wai. It's quite stunning.\n\n'The floaty thing, he does that in his film 2046, it looks a bit smoky and slow motion,' she says approvingly. 'It was quite intense, because he's...' She stops, just short, perhaps, of another minor indiscretion. 'There was a storyboard, but the way he works... he wants to feel it. \"Can you do that...\"' Another shrug, another pout. 'He's always behind the sunglasses. He's another mysterious character. But it was a great honour. I know it's a commercial, but Dior, Wong Kar-Wai, it's cool.'\n\nHow, though, does one become the face of a perfume? Does Eva personify this smell?\n\n'This smell!' she hoots. 'Um, I know they loved the Bond movie. And rather than pick Angelina Jolie or somebody, maybe the fact that I'm French was quite good. But then people perceive me as enigmatic, so maybe that was it.'\n\nIs she enigmatic?\n\n'Yes, I'm very enigmatic,' she says, the sarcasm returning.\n\nWhy do people think she's enigmatic?\n\n'Cause I don't talk.'\n\nShe does really, albeit in a faltering, slightly - and amusingly - ennui-filled way. Interviews, it seems, are a bit like those fashion shoots and red carpet moments: ridiculous things that must nonetheless be acceded to, albeit on her own terms and in her own playful, abstract manner. Likewise the films Eva Green makes: her heart, I think, lies in the independent cinema scene. What she calls 'the big machine' of films like The Golden Compass helps her 'still exist a bit for Hollywood in a way' - and, presumably, they give her the financial freedom to do films like Franklyn\n\n'A lot of young actresses go to Hollywood to become famous,' Chris Weitz had told me. 'It's sort of inevitable that's going to happen given Eva's appearance and abilities, but I don't think she's particularly interested in that. I'm not sure if she's keen enough to do what the Australian and English actors do, which is acquire an American accent and try their hand in Hollywood. She enjoys doing what she's doing and she's quite serious. She's almost like a stage actor, rather than an actor who's concerned about whether she's going to be in the next Michael Bay or Martin Scorsese movie.'\n\nEva Green may be an otherworldly French actress, but when the occasion demands she's also silly. At the end of the fabulously over-the-top Dior advert, is that her saying - in a come-hither, ultra-French accent - 'by Dior'?\n\n'It depends. I wanted to do it. Because (the original voiceover artist) sounded like a transsexual. So I've recorded my voice, and I think now it should be my voice.'\n\nCould she say it now please?\n\n'By Dior,' Eva Green purrs, and I fall off my seat."
