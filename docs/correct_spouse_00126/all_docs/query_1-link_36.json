        "text": "“Sin City: A Dame to Kill For” did little to add sizzle to the late-summer box office this past weekend after collecting a slim $6.5 million and dismissive reviews. But it’s not from lack of trying on the part of Eva Green. This casting addition to the stylized babes-brutes-and-bullets sequel based on Frank Miller’s lurid comic-book series steamed up more than a few critics’ 3-D glasses as Ava Lord, a diabolical emerald-eyed femme fatale who has a hard time keeping her clothes on.\n\n“Pulp and noir were often built on the beautiful shoulders of such characters as Ava, and the main justification for seeing the film is to watch Eva Green claim membership in the pantheon of noir leading ladies,” writes Todd McCarthy in The Hollywood Reporter. Adds Voice Media’s Amy Nicholson: “Eva Green is sexy, funny, dangerous and wild — everything the film needed to be — and whenever she’s not on screen, we feel her absence as though the sun has blinked off.”\n\nSignature line: “As charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government’s money — and off your perfectly-formed arse.” – as feisty Bond girl Vesper Lynd, giving as good as she gets opposite Daniel Craig’s 007 in the 2006 version of “Casino Royale.”\n\nCareer peaks: Like Bridget Bardot in 1956’s “And God Created Woman,” Parisian-born Green, now 34, exploited her own siren-like sexuality and created a sensation as part of a semi-incestuous menage a trois in her 2003 film debut “The Dreamers.” At the time, director Bernardo Bertolucci described his discovery as being “so beautiful, it’s indecent.”\n\nRidley Scott chose her to play the sultry Sibylla, a married Jerusalem princess who has an affair with Orlando Bloom’s crusading knight in his 2004 medieval epic “Kingdom of Heaven.” (Alas, much of her role was excised including love scenes that were later restored in a director’s cut.) The film flopped domestically but did well overseas, turning Green into an international star.\n\n“Rolling Stone” declared 2014 as Green’s comeback year, and she certainly started it off with a bang as the Persian warrior Artemisia in “300: Rise of an Empire.” She delivered the sequel’s killer line, “you fight much harder than you f**k” with relish and shook the multiplex rafters with her bruising bout of hate-sex with her Greek foe. In a change of pace, Green is one of the good guys for once as the Victorian-era clairvoyant Vanessa Ives on Showtime’s horror series “Penny Dreadful,” which has been renewed for a second season. And if anyone can rise out of the ashes of ”Sin City” deux and survive, it will be Green.\n\nBiggest assets: The London-based knockout has been compared to the early Angelina Jolie and rightly so. Just like Jon Voight’s daughter, she grew up with an actress mother, Marlene Jobert, and shares Jolie’s knack for making sexy seem smart while standing out in genres usually dominated by men. Green is also a welcome throwback to when Hollywood knew what do with alluring yet dangerous females who refused to be victims.\n\nBut unlike Jolie, Green has maintained an air of mystery about her private life, characterizing herself as a reclusive nerd. “I like to stay home and read rather than go to a club or something,” she tells Rolling Stone. “I’m very shy. If I go out, I’m hugging the walls.”"
