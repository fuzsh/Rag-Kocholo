        "text": "The enchantingly enigmatic French actress, Eva Green, is widely rumored to have been in a relationship with the artistically distinctive filmmaker, Tim Burton, starting from 2015. Tim Burton, known for his quirky, gothic, aestheticized productions, apparently crossed paths with Eva Green during the filming of the movie Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, where Burton was the director and Green, the leading actress. Although they have never confirmed or denied their relationship publicly, their professional connection blossomed into a deep, intimate friendship, and speculations have persisted about the nature of their relationship. Their rumored association persisted through 2016; however, firm details about their romantic involvement remain elusive and shrouded in mystery.\n\nTim Burton, born on August 25, 1958, is a renowned American filmmaker, artist, writer, and animator, celebrated for his dark, gothic, and eccentric horror and fantasy films such as Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, and many more. Burton has a well-established reputation in the film industry, with his unique visual style and narratives earning him both critical acclaim and commercial success globally.\n\nEva Green was in a romantic relationship with Kiwi actor Marton Csokas from 2005 to 2009. They first met on the set of the epic historical drama film Kingdom of Heaven, where they starred opposite each other and developed an immediate affectionate bond. Their relationship, which spanned over four years, was characterized by a marked chemistry that transcended beyond screen, evident in their collaborative projects in the following years. However, their relationship dissolved in 2009, after being together for about four years.\n\nBorn in New Zealand, Marton Csokas is an accomplished actor renowned for his roles in films such as The Lord of the Rings, Aeon Flux, xXx, and Kingdom of Heaven. His versatile acting prowess transcends across theatre, film, and television platforms, and his performances have earned him critical acclaim and international recognition.\n\nEva Green was linked romantically to the American actor and musician Michael Pitt in 2014, following their collaboration in the drama-thriller film The Dreamers. It was during the shooting of this film that their on-screen romantic connection ignited rumors of an intimate, off-screen relationship. However, this alleged affair remains shrouded in uncertainty as neither Green nor Pitt ever confirmed their relationship. If they dated, their relationship was short-lived as the rumors died down within the same year.\n\nMichael Pitt, born on April 10, 1981, is a prominent actor, model, and musician, known for his roles in films like The Dreamers, Ghost in the Shell, and critically acclaimed TV series Boardwalk Empire. His theatrical performances, on-screen magnetism, and musical talents have earned him a distinct place in the world of entertainment.\n\nEva Green was in a relationship with French actor Yann Claassen between 2000 and 2001. The pair met in drama school in Paris during their early days venturing into acting, sparking a relationship that lasted for approximately a year. Although their romantic involvement was short-lived, they were known to have shared a strong, supportive bond during their time together. However, the duo parted ways by the end of 2001 for reasons unknown to the public.\n\nYann Claassen is a French actor known for his work in Paradise Lost, a hit play by Octave Mirbeau. He attended the Paris Conservatory with Eva Green, where they presumably started their relationship over a shared love for acting, earning him a place in french theatrical scene."
