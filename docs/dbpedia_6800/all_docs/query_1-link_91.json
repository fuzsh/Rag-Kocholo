A somewhat nontraditional technique for Oasis but one that worked really well IMO.\n\nI also love that morose, lonely harmonica at the end of Soldier On.\n\nWhat are some standout harmonica moments for you? Oasis and whatever else?\n\nmasterplan200\n\nGuest\n\nPost by masterplan200 on\n\nOne of my top 10 John Farnham songs. Huge fan of the way Stewart Fraser plays on this song from the first time John sings Chain Reaction and that solo, I'm still shaking my head to how he did it.\n\nidledreamer\n\nGuest\n\nPost by idledreamer on\n\nbob dylan and stevie wonder immediately come to mind.\n\nstevie also plays the harmonica solo in this one:\n\nand, of COURSE:\n\nmimmihopps\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nBOOTLEG QUEEN\n\nThere's no love too small\n\nPosts: 47,499\n\nPost by mimmihopps on\n\nLove absolutely these:\n\n\"Hand In Glove\" - The Smiths (harmonica played by my forever guitar hero)\n\n\"The Swamp Song\" - Oasis (harmonica played by Weller)\n\njoeyfrancis\n\nOasis Manager\n\nPosts: 5,672\n\nPost by joeyfrancis on\n\nIsn't the solo in Gas Panic! a harmonica? That part's awesome.\n\nNYR\n\nOasis Manager\n\nKing of Spam\n\nServing up sexual chocolate since April 24, 2004\n\nPosts: 15,024\n\nPost by NYR on\n\ncheck out \"the masterplan\" and \"whatever\" at knebworth, mtv unplugged and maine road.\n\nDeleted\n\nDeleted Member\n\nPosts: 0\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThe best harmonica solo I've ever heard is in \"Hook\" by Blues Traveler. The song has harmonica throughout but the solo is mind-blowing truly. John Popper is a fat, fuck, but he can make a harmonica do things that guitarist can't do. Check it out.\n\nSolo at 2:30 . . .\n\nIt should be noted that Blues Traveler makes liberal use of harmonica in most of their tunes.\n\nstarwillshine\n\nOasis Roadie\n\nPosts: 216\n\nPost by starwillshine on\n\nThe harmonica solo in this gives me goosebumps, always gets turned at the solos Lovely song from the boss, up there for me.\n\nmatt\n\nOasis Manager\n\n'So I broke into the palace, with a sponge and a rusty spanner'\n\nPosts: 14,212\n\nPost by matt on\n\nI Won't Share You - The Smiths\n\nRight at the very end, understated but perfect end to The Smiths career.
