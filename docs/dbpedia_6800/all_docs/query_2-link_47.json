        "text": "I've just been. Have done a write-up on another forum which is a bit swear-y and not, I think, suitable for these hallowed pages. Basically it was brilliant (we were three rows from front too) but partially spoiled by poor drunken behaviour of about half a dozen attendees, male and female, around us. I don't understand spending this much money on tickets to treat it like a session on the beer and try to make everybody look at you - I'm not interested - you know why? - because Roger Daltrey is over there, he's much more interesting.\n\nI won't go into the set, basically visit setlist FM and it's been the same show each night so far as I can tell.\n\nDaltrey is in fine form. I think he's lost weight and strengthened his voice. One note in 'Another Tricky Day' seemed to elude him and that was that. You can also tell his hearing is affecting it at times - a Wilko song had to be restarted because one of his guitarists (Pete's brother Simon) had a problem with his Strat and the Tele he used, Roger couldn't hear the chords defined to pitch to.\n\nIt's the first time I've seen any Who member in the flesh and it's an 'oh, there's THAT voice' moment. Lovely.\n\nThe band didn't perhaps sound as innovative as you think - it wasn't like watching Plant and Krauss. I couldn't even hear the mandolin for instance. The violinist was very good as was his harmonica player. Those two basically got 99 per cent of any soloing. The violinist did a lot of the synth lines for certain Who songs like 'Who Are You' and 'Baba'. I believe she's the lead for the orchestra The Who take out.\n\nBen Townshend, Pete's son was on (electronic) drums and is very good. Simon Townshend was a ringer for his brother, minus a few inches in height, but similar touch on guitar and his backing vocals were spitting image territory. He also did a solo song to rest Roger, and that man can sing. Daltrey stayed on stage for it which was very respectful I thought.\n\nI went to Glasgow.\n\nMusically it was a great show. I hadn't seen the setlist for this tour before, so a lot of surprises. I seem to remember he did a UK solo tour 5-6 years ago that was mainly \"Who\" stuff, so had expected that again.\n\nThe band were great - he's really lucky to have such a world class group of musicians on such a small tour.\n\nRoger never came across that well... his commentary on COVID, lockdowns, etc. was very dated already. Maybe it's stuff he intended to say in 2020 or 2021 but the UK is in a different position now. Lots of chat, but I expected that as it was billed as \"An Evening With\". The Q&A's were a disaster... he clearly hated the idea and most answers were 1-2 words or less. To be fair one of the \"questions\" was \"Can you say hello to my husband, he's a plumber?\"\n\nBut despite that, I really enjoyed it. Great songs, great voice, great band.\n\nA couple behind me got drunk and noisy very early on, and then suddenly went quiet... as we left, we noticed they were fast asleep, drooling like a couple of kids...\n\nFinal note... It sold very poorly (I'd say 50% full at most) so they reduced the ticket prices. Because the show was rescheduled, I cancelled my original order (easy) and got much better, cheaper seats."
