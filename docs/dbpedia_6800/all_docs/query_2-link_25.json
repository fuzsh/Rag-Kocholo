        "text": "Roger Daltrey, lead singer and co-founder of the English rock band the Who, is getting ready to leave the music business after reaching a milestone age.\n\nDaltrey reflected on his generation after turning 80 on March 1, saying, “I’m on my way out,” the Independent reported citing an exclusive interview with The Times.\n\n“I have to be realistic,” Daltrey reportedly told The Times. “The average life expectancy is 83 and with a bit of luck I’ll make that, but we need someone else to drive things.”\n\nThe musician said this after stepping down as the curator of the annual Teenage Cancer Trust (TCT) gigs after 24 years, the Independent reported.\n\nDaltrey said his main concern about performing was “about how many words” he had to remember for recent shows he performed, according to the outlet.\n\nMore music content\n\nAll the fall 2024 music acts and performances coming to The Big E\n\nAaron Lewis Tour: Where to buy tickets to Springfield show\n\nMajor pop star under investigation linked to new music video\n\nWhere to buy tickets for Justin Timberlake world tour stops August 2024\n\nChristian music artist Phil Wickham to play opening night of 2024 Big E\n\nDaltrey co-founded the Who in London in 1964. The Who’s classic lineup (1964–1978) consisted of Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon.\n\nDaltrey and Townshend are the only two original members who are still part of the band. Moon and Entwistle respectively died in 1978 and 2002.\n\nDaltrey’s hit songs with the Who include “My Generation,” “Pinball Wizard,” “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” “Baba O’Riley” and “You Better You Bet.”\n\nHe began a solo career in 1973 while still a member of the Who, and has released ten solo studio albums, five compilation albums and one live album.\n\nDaltrey’s solo hits include “Giving It All Away”, “Walking the Dog,” “Written on the Wind,” “Free Me,” “Without Your Love” and “Under a Raging Moon.”\n\nAs a member of the band, Daltrey received a Lifetime achievement award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988 and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the Who in 1990, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nThis summer Daltrey will embark on his 2024 U.S. Summer Tour, with a stop at the Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston on June 20."
