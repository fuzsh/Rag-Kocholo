        "text": "I can't name most Who songs and I'm not a fan of rock opera. Despite this, The Who are one of the greatest bands ever, with a legacy that's impossible to measure and a career spanning over 50 years. The Who started out as one of the many bands of the 60's British Invasion, but has built and expanded a musical empire that is only rivaled in length by The Rolling Stones. They pioneered aspects of hard rock, live performances, the iconic windmill, and the destructive rocker reputation, both on and off stage. Thus, the band became representatives for an entire generation, playing with incomparable emotion. It's hard to explain, so you'll just have to listen.\n\nI've had \"Then and Now\" since middle school, and for the longest time, that was my only exposure (plus \"Baba O'Riley\"). During college, I picked up a copy of \"Hooligans\" which introduced me to the next level of Who hits. The Who has been there for me through my drum playing, moments of energy and emotion, and when I just need to get pumped.\n\nRoger Daltrey (vocals) and Pete Townshend (guitar) are still with the band even today. Keith Moon is considered by many to be the greatest drummer of all time, unfortunately passed away in 1978. John Entwistle is also considered the greatest bass player of all time, and stayed with the band until his death in 2002.\n\nNate's Epic Who Playlist\n\nWho Are You (Who Are You 1978)\n\nHad Enough (Who Are You 1978)\n\nNaked Eye (Odds and Sods 1974)\n\nBaba O'Riley (Who's Next 1971)\n\nEminence Front (It's Hard 1982)\n\nWon't Get Fooled Again (Who's Next 1971)\n\nThis Song is Over (Who's Next 1971)\n\nThe Real Me (Quadrophenia 1973)\n\nBargain (Who's Next 1971)\n\n5:15 (Quadrophenia 1973)\n\nSister Disco (Who Are You 1978)\n\nDrowned (Quadrophenia 1973)\n\nI Can't Explain (My Generation 1965)\n\nI Can See For Miles (The Who Sell Out 1967)\n\nReal Good Looking Boy (Then and Now 2004)\n\nYou Better You Bet (Face Dances 1981)\n\nThe Quiet One (Face Dances 1981)\n\nJoin Together (Greatest Hits Live 2010)"
