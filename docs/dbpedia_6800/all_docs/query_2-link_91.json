        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n13 Mar 2023, 09:18\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nIt's only going to be the classics from here on in.\n\nRoger Daltrey has said out loud what most of us think when we go to a concert by a classic rock act. We only want to hear the big songs, the classics, the hits, the singles.\n\nWhether that's a good thing or not, we don't know, but Roger has come to terms with it.\n\nIn a new interview with NME, in which the singer discusses the highly anticipated 2023 Teenage Cancer Trust gig series, set to take place at London's Royal Albert Hall from March 20th-26rd, Daltrey talked about the possibility of The Who making new music.\n\n\"What’s the point? What’s the point of records?\" said Daltrey, who is a Honorary Patron of TCT and is performing himself on Sunday, March 26th. \"We released an album four years ago (2019’s twelfth album WHO), and it did nothing. It’s a great album too, but there isn’t the interest out there for new music these days. People want to hear the old music. I don’t know why, but that’s the fact.\"\n\nDespite this, Daltrey acknowledged the importance of continuing to perform live: \"I’ve got to keep doing it. If I stop for any length of time, I don’t know whether I’ll have a voice at this age after a year off. And that’s the truth. That’s the joy of being a singer: you are the instrument.\"\n\nDaltrey, 79, also reflected on the experience of playing at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\n\"It’s every band’s ambition to play the Royal Albert Hall,\" he said. \"It’s not an easy place to play; it’s a tricky hall to master the sound for bands going in on a one-off. But because we’ve done it for 21 years, we know all of its quirks. We have the best sound, lights and video in there for the whole week.\"\n\nDaltrey and the gang will be back on the road performing the hits on their The Who With Orchestra UK Tour 2023, which runs from 6th to 23rd July. Tour stops include Edinburgh, London and Brighton, with tickets on sale now.\n\nSomeone who will be releasing new music however is Daltrey's bandmate Pete Townshend, guitarist and primary songwriter for The Who, who has announced his first solo single in nearly three decades.\n\n'Can’t Outrun The Truth' is set to drop on March 24rd."
