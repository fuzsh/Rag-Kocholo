In 2008 he was ranked number 61 on Rolling Stone magazine‚Äôs list of the 100 greatest singers of all time.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Daltrey\n\nhttp://www.whosdatedwho.com/tpx_26576/roger-daltrey/songs\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_by_The_Who\n\nhttp://www.jeffersonstarshipsf.com/\n\nhttp://www.jeffersonairplane.com/the-band/\n\nJefferson Airplane with Grace Slick\n\nhit song WHITE RABBIT\n\nRoger Daltry did not play in this band but was of the same era\n\n.More information is needed, this is what I found with a fast Google Search\n\nNonnie\n\nIt‚Äôs fun and fitting that they used Jefferson and Grace for the names, continuing the 70s rocker theme, kind of in honour of Roger Daltrey lending his voice to this ep.\n\nAlso loved that the Caterpillar‚Äôs only line was ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù considering that one of The Who‚Äôs iconic songs is ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù and the lyrics ask that question over and over.\n\nIt‚Äôs a fun tie-in to be sure that the caterpillar‚Äôs line‚Äôs echo that of the song, however those lines are taken straight from the Disney version.\n\nThe caterpillar asks who Alice is to which she responds, something along the lines of she doesn‚Äôt quite know, she‚Äôs changed so many times since breakfast. In reference to being 10 feet tall & she then inadvertently insults the caterpillar about his height ‚Äì saying it‚Äôs wretched to be so small. To which the caterpillar says it is a perfectly good height indeed ‚Äì then Alice gets huffy & says she‚Äôs not used to it.\n\n& speaking of the caterpillar, ‚Ä¶ I wonder why he wasn‚Äôt on his mushroom when they left Wonderland. ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because he‚Äôd gone ahead & turned into a butterfly like in the movie.\n\nI‚Äôll bet this is how it went down in the writing room:\n\nHorowitz: So we have the Caterpillar on his mushroom as they enter Wonderland and he says his iconic line, ‚ÄúWho are you? Who‚Ä¶.are‚Ä¶.you?‚Äù\n\nKitsis: *singing* Who who who who, I really wanna know, whoooooooo aaarrreeee you ‚Äì hey ya know who we should get to do his voice?!\n\nüòâ"
