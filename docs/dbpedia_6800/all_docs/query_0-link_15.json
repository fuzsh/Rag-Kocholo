        "text": "I have never seen any of these bands in real life, so, based on their videos and concerts on TV I can't tell what instrument(s) these lead singers may be proficient in:\n\nBono of U2 (I know he carried a guitar in one of their videos but I recall him swinging it over his head more than playing.)\n\nRobert Plant of Led Zepellin.\n\nRoger Daltrey of The Who (I know he seemed to be playing guitar in the video of a song whose title slips my mind, and for \"Baba O'Riley\" he always seems to be playing a harmonica at the end, but is there anything else?)\n\nJim Morrison of The Doors.\n\nMick Jagger of The Rolling Stones (I have fleeting memories of seeing him playing various instruments - the strongest memories, of course, are of him doing his lead singer thing.)\n\nAny recommendations of recordings that highlight the best performance by\n\nthese artists on whatever instrument they play would be appreciated.\n\nYeah, that was pretty cool, as I caught it on a wall of tvs on display at a K-mart or some such, and, basically, Jimi was standing back playing rythm while Neil Young and Robert Plant traded lead. I seem to remember an interview with Plant where he said he'd been working more on his guitar.\n\nA guy I used to golf with said he shared an elevator with Plant (and his eye candy), and wasn't sure who he was, but knew he was someone famous. He asked, aren't you a guitar player, and he responded something like, \"actually, the guitarist usually plays me.\""
