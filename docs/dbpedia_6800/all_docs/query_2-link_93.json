Go back to newsprint, go back to word of mouth and start to read books again.”\n\nRead more: Roger Daltrey: I’m grateful to have received my coronavirus jab\n\nDaltrey went on: “It’s becoming so absurd now with AI, all the tricks it can do, and the woke generation.\n\n\"It's terrifying, the miserable world they're going to create for themselves.\n\n\"I mean, anyone who's lived a life and you see what they are doing, you just know that it's a route to nowhere.\n\n\"Especially when you've lived through the periods of a life that we've had the privilege to.\n\n\"I mean, we've had the golden era. There's no doubt about that.\"\n\nRead more: The Who's Roger Daltrey says fame isolated him from his old friends\n\nDaltrey founded The Who along with Pete Townshend and John Entwistle in 1964, after the trio met at school in London, and the band’s popularity has endured over the decades.\n\nThe rockers have released 12 studio albums, with their latest, entitled Who, unveiled in December.\n\nThey have also enjoyed several top 10 singles, including I Can’t Explain, My Generation, Won’t Get Fooled Again and Substitute."
