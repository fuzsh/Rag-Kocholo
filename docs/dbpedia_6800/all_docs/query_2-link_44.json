        "text": "Most people, old and young working and retired, generally use the NHS very little when they are young and healthy and pay in far more to the NHS than they get out.\n\nOld people are young people who have continued living until they are old, a fact that seems to elude many people in their youth, So most of us, having paid in to the NHS for 30,40,50 years without using the NHS very much, think it quite reasonable that when we get old and nead medical care, we should be able to get all the care we need, which we have already paid for up front.\n\n“Let’s just die!” he said. “Get me and my lot out the way. It’s crazy.\n\n... you first, Mr Daltrey.\n\nYes, we will all die. But no-one should \"just die\" because they are old.\n\nIt should not be beyond the realms of possibility that a civilised society organises itself so that there is an equitable system of welfare and care for its subjects.\n\nPitting one generation against the other, or one group of people against the other, is not the answer... though it's a very useful tool for any government to use, which they do. Frequently. It saves the bother of doing what they were elected to do.\n\nYou cannot expect a person to pay into a designated national health system for 40 / 50 years and then tell them - when they need its services - that they can't avail themselves of it. Either we have a national health system or we have an every-man-for-himself society. What we have now is a national health service that is opposed by the free-marketeers in government who have neglected to do the necessary planning and funding, and now want to blame those who use the service when they need it, for their failure to manage the system. Daltrey is one of those who votes for such a government.\n\nNo life should be prolonged if it's not in the best interests of the sufferer, and everyone should have the right to choose to die. But no life should be snuffed out simply because it's inconvenient.\n\nAnd I take no lessons from those like Daltrey, or any other high-profile celebrities, who think their platforms give them some special dispensation to dictate to others - even if I agree with their sentiments - because they do not live the lives of ordinary people for one thing, and, for another, why are their views any more potent than anyone else's?\n\nIf Daltrey is \"ready to go\" - I suspect it would be a comfortable and dignified end... he wouldn't be one of those elderly people being 'cared' for in the community, lying in bed, incontinent, waiting for over-worked and under-paid carers to give him 15 minutes out of their over-stretched schedules.\n\nOther European countries appear to manage these systems better than we do."
