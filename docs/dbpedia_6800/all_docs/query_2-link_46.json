        "text": "It has been three years since Roger Daltrey almost died of viral meningitis. “It’s an evil disease. It was very touch and go for a few days. I didn’t think I’d make it,” he says. You would never know from the way the 74-year-old has just burst into his management offices in Camden, having run up six flights of stairs. But in his hospital bed, in 2015, he says his life flashed before him.\n\n“It was literally like falling off a cliff in my mind. I went through everything: born in a V1 raid, slung out of school, working in a factory, to all of the things I’ve done that I could have never imagined as a boy. It’s been an extraordinary life.”\n\nHis mind turned to Heather, his wife of 47 years, and five children. “And I thought everyone is taken care of and I just felt incredible peace come over me.” He guffaws. “I didn’t see any lights at the end of tunnels, but that peace stays with me. It really does.”\n\nDaltrey has a new album out tomorrow, As Long As I Have You. It follows his 2014 Wilko Johnson collaboration Going Back Home but is his first solo album in 25 years. And he sounds absolutely fantastic, still fierce and powerful but also mining something deep and soulful. “I’ve got to keep singing. The voice is a muscle and at my age it’s use it or lose it.”\n\nHe is not too impressed with today’s pop singers, that’s for sure. “They’re singing all the right notes but there’s too much wobbling. Nothing wrong with a good straight word now and again. If I ever start to do that, please smack me on the back of the head.”\n\nHe’s not particularly enamoured of the state of rock, either. “It’s gone backwards, hasn’t it? Well, it certainly hasn’t gone forwards!” He likes Brighton duo Royal Blood and is encouraged that Noel and Liam Gallagher are “out there giving it a go” but thinks “maybe it’s all been done, every mathematical equation. Sooner or later you’ve used all the formulas.” Sometimes he thinks rock might have peaked with The Who’s fifth album Who’s Next in 1971. “Pete [Townshend] was so far ahead of his time, people are still catching up.”\n\nDaltrey’s new album, which he started work on before he became ill, digs further back, into the very roots of The Who, with tough new versions of the kind of soul songs they would cover when they started out in the early Sixties, albeit all selected for their meaningful, adult lyrics. “I had to find songs that meant something to me. I can’t be doing all that oh, baby, baby, baby these days.” Thrillingly, it has Townshend’s distinctive guitar work all over it. Following his bout of meningitis, Daltrey had become disillusioned with his recordings. “I thought, this is crap,” he says bluntly. “I offered to buy it back from the record company and put it in my archives, so someone could dish it up one day when I’m not here to take the flak.” But Townshend got hold of the recordings and offered to work on it. “I’m such an admirer of Pete Townshend, I trusted him and I got my confidence back.” They are both so pleased with the results, it was even briefly mooted to be a Who album. “We need to put a little soul back in this world.”\n\nThere is an angry quality to Daltrey, intriguingly counterbalanced by good cheer. When the subject turns to politics, the effusive frontman really gets going. He is proudly working-class (“You can’t escape it if you’re British, can you? You don’t buy your way out of it mate, that’s for sure”) but not particularly fond of Labour. “It pains me to say it, but in my life a Labour government comes in with incredible optimism and leaves the country in the s---.” Then he catches himself. “I shouldn’t go into this, I’m digging a hole for myself.” He complains that talking about politics brings him too much grief. Remarks in favour of Brexit were widely criticised in liberal music circles. “I’m not anti-Europe, I’m anti-Brussels, but people don’t get the distinction.” Daltrey launches into a passionate but well-informed rant about the lack of democratic accountability in the European Union. “That’s why I’m so angry about it,” he says. “I want someone at least answerable to me that I can say ‘f--- off, you’re useless!’”\n\nDaltrey has been writing his autobiography, to be published later this year, and says the experience was “interesting but painful at times. It’s made the ending seem closer”. The Who have toured extensively in recent years, which Townshend has described as a “farewell tour” and Daltrey has called “the long goodbye”. “I’m sure the Stones are on the same page. You’ve got to be realistic. It could be over next year, or the year after. You just never know. At my father’s age, you were expected to be dead four years ago!”\n\nHe is heartened by the continuing activity of the Rolling Stones and says they are “the best rock and roll band”, but then makes a distinction between Mick Jagger’s outfit and his own. “The Who play to you, rather than at you,” he says. He quotes the epic coda of See Me, Feel Me from Tommy. “It’s ‘Listening to you, I get the music.’ Townshend had his finger on the pulse so early on. It’s you the audience that feeds the band, that throw it back to you, a circular thing that elevates us all.” But he concedes, “You’re never going to out-front Mick Jagger, he’s the best frontman there’s ever been. I mean, there’s him and then there’s Freddie [Mercury] and all the rest of us are somewhere down the line.”\n\nDaltrey claims never to have put much thought into his stagecraft. “I just do things, I try to create movement that elevates the music. Anything is better than just standing there. The swinging of the microphone came out of boredom during long solos but it looks so good and it just racked up the tension. And boy oh boy, I could swing that thing when I was young.” He hurls his mic in the air rather more sparingly now. “We can allow ourselves to grow old a little graciously,” he laughs. ”Not a lot, but a little.”\n\nBut he’s not anticipating the end quite yet. “Retirement is death. I’ve never wanted to stop.” He would dearly love to make one more Who album, in which he contributes material alongside his old bandmate. Townshend has long seemed the more reluctant partner in the surviving duo, but Daltrey remains optimistic.\n\n“You never know. We’re not gone yet. We’ve still got fire in our bellies. Whatever Pete wants to do, we can do. If it’s over, it’s over. But I’m going to desperately try and write some songs. If I can get half the songs on a The Who album I will be the happiest man in the universe.”"
