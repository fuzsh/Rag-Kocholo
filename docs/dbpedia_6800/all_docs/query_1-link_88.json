        "text": "“I play the harmonica. The only way I can play is if I get my car going really fast, and stick it out the window.” — Steven Wright\n\n11. “What I Like About You” by the Romantics\n\nWhen “What I Like About You” was released in late 1979, it only reached a disappointing number 49 on the Billboard chart. The song become a rock anthem after it was featured in Budweiser commercials in the late-1980s.\n\n“What I Like About You” featured lead vocals by drummer Jimmy Marinos and was written by Marinos, guitarist Mike Skill, and Wally Palmar, who played the harmonica solo. “I came up with ‘What I Like About You’ quick,” Skill recalled in Classic Bands.\n\n“‘What I Like About You’ is three or four simple chords we could bash out and put melodies to. The trick is to get a good melody to it and a good chorus with a good beat behind it.\n\n“I had this thing that I came up with in my backyard, the three chords, the verse, and then I got to the studio, a rehearsal studio which was just me and Jimmy there. He played it, got a beat to it and was already coming up with some kind of little melody, like the verse. The other guys came in and we started formulating a little bit. It was still raw, and over time, probably the next few weeks, I came up with the hook.”"
