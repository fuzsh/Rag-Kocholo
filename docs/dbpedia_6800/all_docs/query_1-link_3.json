        "text": "On wikipedia under instruments he is credited as being able to play guitar, harmonica, percussion, trombone, keyboards, cello, violin, ukulele, saxophone, bass guitar.\n\nI've seen him play guitar and harmonica on occasion live, but is there any record of him playing any of these other instruments ever? If so, I didn't realize he could do all that and just chose never rarely contribute his playing to The Who.\n\nDon't believe everything on wikipedia. It's nice to have but there's also a lot of wrong information. I just recently spoke to a musician, who would love to have his site erased because of so many wrong \"facts\".\n\nI know Daltrey started out as a guitar player, and that he plays harmonica, but I would question the cello and trombone for sure. Those aren't easy instruments to just pick up and play!\n\nDon't worry I'm aware, that's why I asked.\n\nI'd tell the musician to simply fix the page himself if it bothers him that bad.\n\nI find it hard to believe that Wikipedia wouldnâ€™t let a bona fide musician clear up any misinformation or facts on him or his group.\n\nHe also plays trombone (IIRC) on Cobwebs and Strange. Pretty sure that's accurate.\n\nCello I don't know about. Do remember tho that he was originally the lead guitarist of The Detours, Pete was acoustic rhythm.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't have some piano skills, either.\n\n\"cello cello chello chello....\" LOL\n\nHe also plays trombone (IIRC) on Cobwebs and Strange. Pretty sure that's accurate.\n\nCello I don't know about. Do remember tho that he was originally the lead guitarist of The Detours, Pete was acoustic rhythm.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't have some piano skills, either.\n\n\"cello cello chello chello....\" LOL\n\nBear in mind, too, that just because he once played something doesn't mean he still practices on the instrument. I mean, when I was 21 I could play about 10 things. Now, well, I still remember how to do embouchures and where fingers went, but could I pick something up I haven't touched since my teens and play you a tune? Not a chance.\n\nRoger DOES practice guitar to the best of my knowledge.\n\nDidn't he \"play\" the trombone part on Cobwebs and Strange?\n\nAnd I put that in quotes because the trombone on that song acts as just an oversized slide-whistle."
