        "text": "Not sure if this has already been posted, but here goes:\n\nhttp://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tm...d=689&e=9&u=/launch/20030709/en_launch/214073\n\n[begin article]\n\nRoger Daltrey Rips British Authorities Over Pete Townshend Case\n\nWed Jul 9, 8:00 AM ET\n\nLAUNCH Radio Networks\n\nRoger Daltrey has blasted British authorities for the way they dealt with Pete Townshend and his child pornography arrest in January. Daltrey told the U.K. newspaper the Daily Telegraph that his Who bandmate \"didn't deserve to be treated like a criminal because that's the last thing he is...There was a huge breach of his civil liberties, and I don't think we should sit back and watch that kind of thing happen without fighting it.\"\n\nTownshend admitted to using his credit card to visit a child porn website. He claimed it was for research for his upcoming autobiography, which will detail his own sexual abuse as a child. Townshend was arrested but never officially charged with a crime, and after a lengthy investigation, he was placed on the British sex offenders registry, where his name will stay for five years.\n\nDaltrey said that police examined 14 computers belonging to Townshend and found nothing on them, causing him to ask, \"What are we becoming? The f--king Taliban? Pete's an artist and may have been naive, but he did nothing wrong and told the truth from the start. But he was treated as though he was guilty of the worst crimes and crucified without a trial by people with no accountability. It's a f--king disgrace. Everything they did to him was appalling.\"\n\nDaltrey added, \"If [Townshend] had told a pack of lies, they wouldn't have come after him. But he didn't hide anything and paid a price for being honest. He has a long history of working to help abused people, and has spent a lot of time thinking about the problem. That's just a fact. But nobody wanted to listen to his explanation, and now--too late--they find he's guilty of doing nothing.\"\n\nWhile Daltrey is upset with the authorities, he's also unhappy with the reaction from the population at large. \"If this was the '60s, more people would see this witch hunt for what it is and start a protest,\" he said. \"It's not just about Pete. It's about having some control over our lives and not letting the police do whatever they want...Not many people think for themselves now. They're like wallpaper. Well, they'd better wake up and think about what happened to Pete, because that wasn't the end of anything. It was the beginning of a witch hunt and nobody's safe.\"\n\nDaltrey also talked about the death last June of bassist John Entwistle. He said it really wasn't a surprise to him: \"John hadn't looked healthy for a long time. I'm a big believer in alternative medicine and healthy living, and I can tell when someone looks ill. I saw it in John's pallor and his eyes. He lived hard and he took risks. Whenever I saw him in the last few years, I always made a habit of giving him a big hug before I left him. I was never sure I'd see him again.\"\n\nHowever, Daltrey salutes the way Entwistle went out, in bed with a stripper. He said, \"Ask any man what he would prefer--to live to a ripe old age and die alone or to go out shagging your b-lls off with strippers in Vegas? Come on, let's be honest. It's not a death that any man should be ashamed of.\"\n\nOn a happier note, Daltrey told the paper that he and Townshend will start work on a new album soon, which will be followed by a tour. \"We're not going to give up now,\" he said. \"As long as Pete's there on guitar, and I'm there to sing the lead, you're going to have the Who. The sound is still there. And in my opinion, Pete's getting better as the years go by. Nothing is going to stop us, not the government or the press or anybody. We're going to keep playing until we drop dead.\"\n\n[/end article]\n\nAh, this is great news, I saw the Who on their last tour, and anybody who did will tell you, that they really don't care if only 'half' of the band is on stage, it is the best half. These two really played their hearts out, and I agree the Pete is playing the best that he has in many, many years. I look forward to hearing what they come up with the new CD, and of course I will catch them on their next tour. A good rockin' night for all, indeed.\n\nI know this is going off a bit on a tangent here - - but the idea that a single piece of this material on you PC can get you a long sentence is a little scary. I can think of a few occasions where I myself may have inadvertently stumbled onto images of questionable legality:\n\nIn the early days of MP3 encoding, searching for MP3 files on the web, I somehow ended up in a never ending porno pop up loop. 5, 6, 7 windows opening simultaneously - lord knows what may have been left behind in a cache file somewhere....\n\neven in fairly innocuous un-moderated usenet newsgroups, you might find one of these postings with a header like \"take a look\", and zowie - there it is. Just because I opened it, doesn't mean I am guilty, as a matter of fact, I'm a victim!\n\nAnyway, while I have no tolerance for anyone that desires this type of material, or in any way supports the industry - - this problem WILL NOT go away by attacking the voyeurs. That reminds me of the \"war on drugs\" in the late 60's and early 70's where they targeted the users. So some pot heads drew outrageously long sentences and the dealers remained free and rich. Sorry - if you want to stop these kinds of problems you have to strike at the head. Anything else is just a publicity stunt by politicos trying to justify their existence."
