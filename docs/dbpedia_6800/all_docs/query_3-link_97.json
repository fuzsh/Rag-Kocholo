        "text": "British rock singer Roger Daltrey’s love of performing and his love for the music of former Who partner Pete Townshend came together in an arousing, if inconsistent, concert at the chilly Greek on Saturday.\n\nSongs from all phases of the Who catalog were offered, with extra emphasis on compositions from the rock opera “Tommy” and “Quadrophenia,” perhaps the Who’s most ambitious album.\n\nFollowing an orchestrated medley of “Tommy” tunes, Daltrey and his band (which featured Townshend’s younger brother Simon on guitar, and Ringo Starr’s son, Zak Starkey, on drums) got warmed up on two of the Who’s lesser, later-period songs, “You Better You Bet” and “Another Tricky Day.” What immediately followed, though, was pure rock magic.\n\nIntroducing “I Can See for Miles” as “my favorite Who single ever,” Daltrey brought the crowd to its feet with an inspired delivery that even had the idle orchestra members mouthing the legendary lyrics.\n\nLikewise, such timeless compositions as “I’m Free” and “Baba O’Reilly” struck emotive chords with the crowd, and with the curly-haired singer, who beamed throughout.\n\nAfter a short intermission, former Who bassist John Entwistle was introduced and made an immediate impact with his signature style and rigid stage presence. “The Real Me” was among the songs that benefited from Entwistle’s thundering bottom end.\n\nThe accompanying orchestra, made up of approximately 45 locally contracted players, added muscle and dynamism to many of the selections, though it was often lost in the din of the rock band. An orchestra pit in front of the stage would have worked more effectively.\n\nTownshend’s excitable guitar style and voice recalled his brother, as did his songwriting skill, demonstrated on his own sweet “That’s the Way It Is.”\n\nStill happy to be on stage after 30-plus years, the youthful Daltrey was an enthusiastic pleasure throughout the long concert, though his swinging microphone windmill trick, long his stage habit, did grow old as the show proceeded.\n\nAll but acknowledging his inability to succeed without Pete Townshend as a songwriting partner, Daltrey offered, with this tribute, the next best thing. After a number of Who farewell shows, this concert, the last of a summerlong American trek, may now turn out to be Daltrey’s own memorable swan song."
