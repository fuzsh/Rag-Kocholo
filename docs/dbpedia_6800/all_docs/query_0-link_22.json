        "text": "“What can I say about Chicago that hasn’t already been said?” asked Who frontman Roger Daltrey rhetorically on the closing night of his 2024 North American tour. “What a great city you’ve got,” he continued on stage at Ravinia Festival, about 25 miles north of Chicago in the suburb of Highland Park, Illinois. “There’s enough misery in the world so let’s just have some fun!”\n\nFun was in fact the predominant component as Daltrey wrapped up his summer solo tour alongside a stellar nine piece backing group and Scottish singer songwriter KT Tunstall, who opened the show.\n\nWitty, charming and engaging, Daltrey conducted a masterclass in music 101 over the course of nearly two hours on stage at Ravinia during a set where the stories mattered as much as the music.\n\nIn astoundingly fine voice, Daltrey, 80, would go on to put his spin upon cuts from a diverse roster of artists including bluesman Taj Mahal (“Freedom Ride”), soft rock stalwart Leo Sayer (“Giving it All Away”), swamp rockers Creedence Clearwater Revival (“Have You Ever Seen the Rain”) and even Who bandmate Pete Townshend.\n\n“As I said, no synthesizers,” explained Daltrey early in the Ravinia concert, offering up a sort of mission statement as he put a unique spin upon an array of Who hits. “When you take that and tape loops out of a lot of Pete’s songs, you’re left with Shepherd’s Bush blues songs,” he explained, introducing “Who Are You.”\n\n“Who Are You,” the title track from the group’s eighth studio album in 1978, would drive that record to multi-platinum sales in the United States, where it would top out at #2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\n“That’s a Pete Townshend song,” marveled Daltrey following an opening performance of the 1980 Townshend solo cut “Let My Love Open the Door.” “They’re all good…” he joked. “Most of them,” said Daltrey with a wink, nod and smile.\n\nWilling to take a deeper dive into the Who canon, Daltrey and company followed up “Substitute” with their take on “Tattoo,” from 1967’s The Who Sell Out.\n\nOn their way into the outdoor amphitheatre, some fans scribbled out questions for Daltrey to answer at various points throughout the show.\n\n“What’s the first rock and roll song?” said Daltrey, reading one aloud. “Some say Bill Haley. Elvis was quite good,” he answered. “But the first rock song to me was by who I consider to be a real rock and roller: Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti,” explained Daltrey, further referencing legendary Chicago blues guitarist Buddy Guy. “He did it all!”\n\nWorking in a pair of solo cuts, Daltrey swung his microphone inimitably throughout “After the Fire,” soon picking up a tambourine as four part harmonies drove “Days of Light.”\n\nDueling percussion set against a trio of guitars (two acoustic, one electric) informed a unique take on “The Kids are Alright,” with the fiddle of Katie Jacoby (who’s performed with The Who during orchestral tours since 2019) combining with live accordion to drive a spirited rendition of “Squeeze Box.”\n\n“OK… We haven’t tried this yet as a band. So, bear with us if it goes wrong!” said Daltrey with a hearty laugh, setting up the group’s take on Little Feat via Largo’s “Gimme a Stone” (reportedly for the first time in over ten years). Daltrey turned right, soaking in live violin and mandolin as bongos and drums drove the rootsy rendition, with his band in terrific form as they navigated the impromptu attempt.\n\nPaul Simon’s “The Boy in the Bubble” was a highlight midway through with Daltrey bequeathing his patented “Won’t Get Fooled Again” wail to the audience moments later.\n\n“Pete sang this song off Who’s Next and we never did it,” assessed Daltrey bluntly later, setting up “Going Mobile.” “But now I can because I have a Townshend on guitar who is just as good!”\n\nPete’s brother Simon Townshend has been a mainstay in Daltrey’s solo performances for three decades and was at his best on stage on closing night as the group worked up “Going Mobile,” with the younger Townshend offering up a spot-on lead vocal while Daltrey wailed away on harmonica.\n\nPointing with his right hand, Daltrey conducted the audience late, swinging his microphone one last time as the group cruised toward finish with “Baba O’Riley.”\n\n“Hi, Ravinia! What’s up early birds?” asked opening act KT Tunstall excitedly. “I grew up in the U.K. and wanted to be in The Who! There’s no prerequisite. I’m sure you wanted to too!” she continued, setting up opening track “It Took Me so Long to Get Here, but Here I Am.” “This is the last date of the tour and it’s just been the most amazing experience opening for Roger Daltrey. I can’t wait to come out there and watch the show with you!”\n\nSinging and playing guitar over backing tracks, Tunstall manipulated an arsenal of foot pedals on stage, recording backing loops in real time to sing and play over during each track of her captivating solo performance.\n\nClad in a t-shirt bearing the likenesses of actors Gary Coleman and Mr. T, Tunstall proved affable and entertaining on stage in Chicago, working in an Edie Brickell snippet (”What I Am”) during the opening cut before turning to kazoo later, creating her own take on the White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army” for use during “Black Horse and the Cherry Tree.”\n\nForbesThe Who Look Back On 'Tommy,' 'Quadrophenia' During 'Hits Back' Stop In Chicago\n\nClosing with “Suddenly I See,” Tunstall strapped on electric guitar, employing the iconic Bo Diddley beat as the crowd clapped along near the end of a highly rewarding opening set.\n\n“The Who and Roger have so many amazing songs, there’s no way they could play them all. So, I asked Roger if there was one he might like me to play. Shall we pretend it’s 1969?,” mused Tunstall, setting up her take on “The Acid Queen,” from The Who’s famed rock opera Tommy. “What a lovely, generous suggestion from Roger!” exclaimed Tunstall following the song. “I made it into The Who!”"
