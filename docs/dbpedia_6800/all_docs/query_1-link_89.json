        "text": "Roger Daltrey – legendary rock icon and co-founder of one of music’s most inspirational and influential forces, The Who – will return to the States on a special solo tour this June, presenting a mostly acoustic set of Who gems, rarities, solo works, and other surprises. He will appear at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts on June 16, and at The Capitol Theatre on June 18.\n\nWith an intimate rock-based band and setting and answering questions from the audience, this exclusive set of shows will continue throughout June. Special guests for the much-anticipated performances include GRAMMY-nominated Scottish singer/songwriter KT Tunstall and acclaimed, offbeat singer/songwriter Dan Bern.\n\nRoger Daltrey hand-picked an ensemble of musicians to join him that includes Simon Townshend – guitar, Billy Nicholls – mandolin, Jody Linscott – percussion, Doug Boyle – guitar, John Hogg – Bass, Katie Jacoby – violin, Steve Weston – harmonica, Geraint Watkins – keyboards/accordion, and Scott Devours – Drums.\n\nDaltrey was inducted into the Rock and Hall of Fame with The Who in 1990, received a Lifetime Achievement award from the GRAMMY Foundation with the band in 2001, and received Kennedy Center Honors in 2008. Considered to have one of the most recognizable singing voices of all time, Planet Rock listeners voted him Rock’s fifth-greatest voice in music history. Known for his magnetic presence and rebellious creative spirit, Daltrey has been an actor and producer with multiple roles in films, theatre, and television.\n\nHe’s released ten solo studio albums, including the acclaimed discs Daltrey, Ride a Rock Horse, One of the Boys, and the 2018 release As Long As I Have You, and such hit singles as “I’m Free,” “Giving It All Away,” “Without Your Love,” “Free Me” and “After the Fire.” Queen Elizabeth awarded him a CBE for his service to music and charity in 2004.\n\nDaltrey is the Teenage Cancer Trust’s Honorary Patron and co-founder of Teen Cancer America (with Pete Townshend). On March 15, Dire Straits’ Mark Knopfler released a new, special recording of his composition, “Going Home (Theme From Local Hero)” featuring over 60 of the finest rock performers ever assembled on one iconic track, including members of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, The Who, Pink Floyd, Queen, Black Sabbath, Rush, Guns N’ Roses, and many more. The milestone release, currently available to order, will raise funds for Teen Cancer America and its UK equivalent Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nIn crafting this completely new show set to kick off in June 2024, Daltrey looks forward to unveiling one of his more intimate and unique stage shows, an up close and personal gift to his fans that highlights Who rarities, solo hits, and other songs from his incredible near 60-year career.\n\nTickets go on sale starting Friday, March 22 at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nJune 12 / Wolf Trap – Filene Center / Vienna, VA*\n\nJune 14 / OLG Stage at Fallsview Casino / Niagara Falls, ON*\n\nJune 16 / Bethel Woods Center for the Arts / Bethel, NY*\n\nJune 18 / The Capitol Theatre / Port Chester, NY*\n\nJune 20 / Leader Bank Pavilion / Boston, MA*\n\nJune 22 / Tanglewood – The Koussevitzky Music Shed / Lenox, MA*\n\nJune 25 / Meadow Brook Amphitheatre / Detroit, MI**\n\nJune 27 / Murat Theatre at Old National Centre / Indianapolis, IN**\n\nJune 29 / The Pavilion at Ravinia / Highland Park, IL*\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS\n\n*KT Tunstall\n\n**Dan Bern"
