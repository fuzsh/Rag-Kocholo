        "text": "The Who have been playing to millions upon millions of dads and rock purists for decades. But even frontman Roger Daltrey isn’t blind to the state of popular rock ‘n’ roll in 2016. In an interview with The Times, Daltry called the time of death on the long-standing musical genre.\n\n“The sadness for me is that rock has reached a dead end,” he said, before angering legions of dad-rockers even more by going over to their least favorite genre. “The only people saying things that matter are the rappers and most pop is meaningless and forgettable.”\n\nWhile The Who have turned in their fair share of unforgettable performances, Daltry says that rock and pop music’s top stars have lost the ability to make a lasting impression. “You watch these people and you can’t remember a bloody thing,” he said.\n\nRelated Video"
