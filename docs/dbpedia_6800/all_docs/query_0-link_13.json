In the music of the 20th century, the only people I'd list as geniuses are Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Frank Zappa.\n\nBut, at 52 years old, and recently having had a concentrated look back at the British Invasion, I have to admit I'm stunned by the amazingness of what came out of that era.\n\nThe Beatles: What can you say that hasn't already been said? John Lennon: The poet of the era? Best down-and-dirty rock singer of all-time? Most clever rhythm guitarist ever? Paul McCartney: Inventor of art rock? Prog rock? Best singer of the entire classic rock era? Bass player extraordinaire? George Harrison: Rockabilly genius? \"Taxman\"/\"Within You, Without You\"/\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"/\"Something\"/\"Here Comes the Sun\"/All Things Must Pass. WTF? Ringo Starr: A master class in how to play to the song and use your drums as \"voice\".\n\nThe Who: Pete Townshend: If it weren't for what I'm going to say below, THE best songwriter in rock history. Amazing blend of catchiness, ferocity, doubt, angst and poignancy. Roger Daltrey: Best front man a band could ever have? When I watch videos of The Who, I get chills sometimes from Daltrey's portrayal of Tommy. John Entwistle: All apologies to the thousands of other great bass players in the world but, The Ox is THE bass player. His level of virtuosity is near sickening. Keith Moon: Sloppy, erratic, overplaying juggernaut of rock might!\n\nThe Kinks: Begins and ends with Ray Davies, the best songwriter of the British Invasion and probably of the entire rock era. I can't praise him highly enough. And, after Muswell Hillibillies, The Kinks embarked on a progressive rock journey involving concepts, theater and pub-night horn sections. Such a vastly underappreciated band.\n\nThere are many other solid bands from the era that, even though I don't think they're especially brilliant, are still great listening:\n\nThe Dave Clark Five: Excellent singles during their short run.\n\nDonovan: I don't care for any of his albums all the way through but, wow, what an amazing collection of catchy, innovative singles.\n\nThe Hollies: In terms of melodies, harmony singing and ear-worms, one of the best.\n\nThe Pretty Things: Is S.F. Sorrow the best album of the British Invasion?\n\nThe Zombies: Colin Blunstone was the best singer of the era by far and OaO is a stone-cold classic.\n\nI'm not that keen on The Animals. I know Cream is often categorized as a British Invasion band but I'm not sure about placing them in the list. If I do, their more psychedelic stuff is incredible and I'm probably going to have to say more about Jack Bruce. I can live without the \"yer blues\", though. The Moody Blues pre-NiWS don't do much for me. I've always thought The Yardbirds were more important for (1) the musicians who were unleashed upon the world coming out of the band; and (2) being the seed for Renaissance.\n\nAnd, regarding The Rolling Stones... I love them, no question. But I can't shake the thought that the best part of their career (up through EoMS, at least) is first, let's do something similar to what The Beatles just did; and second, let's do something in total opposition to what The Beatles just did. MJ and KR are fabulous songwriters - no argument. And no band has ever made such a nice, funky, earthy sound. But I've never found them brilliant. Excellent, yes, but kind of derivative. That said, EoMS is without question a monumental album and Bill Wyman's 70s bass playing is about the coolest groove I've ever heard.\n\nSo...\n\nI agree that Cream aren't \"British Invasion\". I tend to think of them as sort of like psychedelic blues or maybe even proto-metal. I guess. Not that I spend a whole lot of time thinking of such things.\n\nre: The Yardbirds: think of all the bands and careers that wouldn't exist if there had been no Yardbirds. Imagine a world with no Disraeli Gears, Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs or There And Back in it. Scary, isn't it? Besides all that, Heart Full Of Soul is just a totally bad ass song (and I know they had other bad ass records, but I'm not as familiar with their catalog in general as I should be, one of these days I'm going to have add Roger The Engineer and Little Games to my collection).\n\nre: Searchers: I really only know two songs from the British Invasion catalog, Needles And Pins and Love Potion No. 9, but I've always wanted to hear more. Beyond that, I only really only know their early 80's comeback album (that wasn't much of a comeback, actually) Love's Melodies, which is also great (much better than you'd expect it to be, in my estimation).\n\nI don't think I have a vocabulary that can illustate how bad ass The Who were. I mostly like the 70's era stuff, but even those early records like Substitute, Anyway Anywhere Anyhow and I Can't Explain kill! As the jive talking witness in Airplane II says, \"I mean, shit!\".\n\nAs for The Beatles, I can't really add anything to any discussion about The Beatles. They made a motherfucking shitload of great records, made two classic movies that every musician who thinks he's an actor has spent 50 years trying to top (or at least match), I mean, what more can you say? Put Revolver on and let it speak for itself.\n\nAs for The Stones, they're kind of a weird group. The early stuff is not bad, even if there are too many covers and especially too many attempts at being an \"R&B band\". For me, it's more around the time of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction and Get Off Of My Cloud that things really start to pick up. To this day, I've never owned Satanic Majesties (but I've heard it enough times to form an opinion on it) and Going Home should have been faded out about 7 minutes earlier, but just about everything else from Aftermath up through at least Sticky Fingers is golden. One of these days, I'm going to have to get Exile On Main Street. And even after that, there's some good songs on most of the albums, at least up through Tattoo You, anyway.\n\nThe other groups mentioned, I don't really know enough about to comment on, except that I always loved Manfred Mann's version of The Mighty Quinn. I'm pretty sure that had to be the first Dylan song I ever heard, and I always thought it was cool, even before I knew that Zimmerman was supposed to know the answers to life, the universe and everything or whatever."
