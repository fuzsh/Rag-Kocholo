        "text": "Beautiful instruments, those!\n\nAnother difference would be the fundamental tuning and the resulting playing style. Diatonic harps are tuned to every key, so you just pick a different harp to play a song in a different key without learning new blow-draw patterns. Chromatic harmonicas are really only in one or two keys, so you use the same instrument on every song, no matter the key -- this is a VERY different technique, trust me.\n\nDepending on the player, he or she might choose a chromatic harp for jazz, classical or world music, but tons of those players prefer to use diatonic harps and do complicated note-bending techniques to get the missing tones. I've been studying harmonica for nearly 20 years, and I consider some of that stuff pure sorcery!\n\nPeter Green was a very decent harp/harmonica player. Apparently he was quite good on guitar as well.\n\nBeing a 60s beat group kind of guy, most of the people i know have been mentioned however I'd like to give two shouts out....\n\nharmonica was largely dropped by the first wave of UK bands after a short time but i love how Roger Daltrey used harp to blow out the violin solo from Baba O'Riley in live performance.\n\n.....and, this guy might be a harmonica player who sometimes sung but by all accounts he's the Hendrix of harmonica, revolutionised playing and probably most of the players mentioned in this thread would say he's the man....it's Little Walter\n\nI have to confess, I just pulled the images off Wiki! I only play the trumpet."
