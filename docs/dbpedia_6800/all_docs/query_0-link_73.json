DAVID GILMOUR) - GOING HOME (THEME FROM LOCAL HERO) CD, 12\", deluxe CD+Blu-ray, download and stream\n\nOUT NOW - Released March 15th, 2024\n\nA new, very special recording of Mark Knopfler's anthemic 'Going Home (Theme From Local Hero)' has been recorded at west London's British Grove Studios to raise funds for Teenage Cancer Trust and Teen Cancer America.\n\nPerformed by Mark Knopfler's Guitar Heroes and produced by Knopfler's longtime collaborator Guy Fletcher, the track features an unprecedented line-up of some of the greatest guitarists and musicians in history. Amongst the sixty-odd contributors (listed in full below) are David Gilmour, Pete Townshend, Ronnie Wood, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Alex Lifeson, Brian May, and many more. Roger Daltrey (honorary patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust) plays harmonica, with drums by Ringo Starr and his son, Zak Starkey, with Sting playing bass guitar.\n\nThe instrumental begins with the final recording of Jeff Beck, who died last year.\n\nReleased March 15th, the single will be released on CD, 12” with etched b-side, deluxe CD+BluRay (exclusive to the official store), download and streaming (including a Dolby Atmos mix). It features artwork which has been designed by Sir Peter Blake (The Beatles, The Who, Band Aid).\n\nFull list of contributors:\n\nJoan Armatrading, Jeff Beck, Richard Bennett, Joe Bonamassa, Joe Brown, James Burton, Jonathan Cain, Paul Carrack, Eric Clapton, Ry Cooder, Jim Cox, Steve Cropper, Sheryl Crow, Danny Cummings, Roger Daltrey, Duane Eddy, Sam Fender, Guy Fletcher, Peter Frampton, Audley Freed, Vince Gill, David Gilmour, Buddy Guy, Keiji Haino, Tony Iommi, Joan Jett, John Jorgenson, Mark Knopfler, Sonny Landreth, Albert Lee, Greg Leisz, Alex Lifeson, Steve Lukather, Phil Manzanera, Dave Mason, Hank Marvin, Brian May, Robbie McIntosh, John McLaughlin, Tom Morello, Rick Nielsen, Orianthi, Brad Paisley, Nile Rodgers, Mike Rutherford, Joe Satriani, John Sebastian, Connor Selby, Slash, Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr and Zak Starkey, Sting, Andy Taylor, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, Ian Thomas, Pete Townshend, Keith Urban, Steve Vai, Waddy Wachtel, Joe Louis Walker, Joe Walsh, Ronnie Wood, Glenn Worf, Zucchero.\n\nCancer is different when you are younger: it can be harder to get a diagnosis, cancer treatments can be less effective for young people, and accessing clinical trials can be harder. This project is raising funds for two charities that are dedicated to supporting this specific age group. Teenage Cancer Trust funds specialist nurses and youth workers to be there for a young person when cancer has turned their world upside down and to help make sure cancer doesn’t rob young people of the best years of their life. Teen Cancer America partners with hospitals throughout the United States to develop specialized facilities and services for teens and young adults with cancer.\n\nYou can place your orders for this single now, with proceeds going to these most worthy of charities, through the official store via this link (they have a store exclusive of a deluxe CD+Blu-ray), or you can get the 12\" single through HMV online and other stores should have this too, including Amazon. The CD is also available through HMV online and other stores including Amazon should start listing it soon.\n\nPINK FLOYD: THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON COLLECTOR'S EDITION\n\nOUT NOW - Released April 19th, 2024\n\nA date for the diary for (we suspect) a lot of you: on April 19th, Pink Floyd will be releasing a Collector’s Edition of The Dark Side Of The Moon on crystal clear vinyl. This will be a 2 x 180g single sided LP set, featuring UV artwork print on the non-groove side (so side 1 on the first record, and side 2 on the second). From the initial pictures of it, and from seeing other UV releases, it promises to be a wonderful looking addition to the collection!\n\nThe technology is fairly new, and from the limited examples from other artists already released, it gives great looking results. This new edition of The Dark Side Of The Moon features the prism spectrum seen through the playable side of the vinyl whilst maintaining the best quality sound. Packaged in a slipcased gatefold sleeve, it also comes with an exclusive poster.\n\nIt's great to see them use this pioneering UV printing process. The images are printed with a high end UV printer, using UV-LED light to dry the permanent ink on the side without audio on which the image is printed. This combination of one-sided audio and the UV print (on the side without audio) combines the best of both worlds: great audio and a beautiful image to enjoy.\n\nYou can order this special edition through the following links, whilst helping this site with its ongoing running costs, at no additional cost to you, as we participate in the Amazon affiliate programme. You can order through Amazon.com, Amazon UK, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. You can also order from HMV.com.\n\nROGER WATERS: THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON REDUX 1LP PICTURE DISC\n\nOUT NOW - Released April 20th, 2024 as part of Record Store Day\n\nJust revealed is the list of exclusives that will be made available as part of the 2024 Record Store Day, which is being held on 20th April at all participating, independent stockists.\n\nAmongst the huge array of special editions, all of which are produced in varying degrees of limited numbers, is one for the Roger Waters collectors out there. As you will be aware, last year he released his Redux of The Dark Side Of The Moon, which - on vinyl - was issued in nine different versions, from standard black to almost any colour you like.\n\nNine always felt an odd number (literally) for this release, and a tenth edition has just been revealed. On the Record Store Day list, they have included a limited edition 1LP picture disc of the album that will be individually numbered in a die-cut sleeve. There will be 3000 copies worldwide, so actually in greater numbers than some of the different colour variants of the album, which were all 2LP sets. We suspect they've been able to squeeze the album (without the additional track that came with the vinyl versions last year) onto a single LP, but obviously we don't know at this stage if there has been any editing to help it fit.\n\nAnd, as we've mentioned previously, all the limited edition items are released just through RSD participating stores on 20th April 2024 - go to RecordStoreDay.com or RecordStoreDay.co.uk for more details of who those will be. A reminder that it will ONLY be these stores participating; the stores themselves can't sell it online - the record will become available for customers coming through the door of the store from the morning of the 20th (and not before), in limited quantities - first come, first served, and only one copy per customer. After RSD, if copies remain, the retailers may put them for sale online (and of course, there'll also be copies on eBay inevitably...).\n\nPINK FLOYD: ANIMALS 2018 REMIX; DOLBY ATMOS BLU-RAY\n\nOUT NOW - Released May 17th 2024\n\nComing on May 17th, on Blu-ray and compatible digital platforms (Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music), is the Dolby Atmos version of Pink Floyd's Animals 2018 Remix. It is the first time the album will have been available in Dolby Atmos.\n\nThe Blu-ray includes High Resolution Stereo and 5.1 mixes alongside the 1977 Original Stereo Mix. For those who have compatible equipment to hear it in its full glory, the Dolby Atmos mix goes beyond ordinary listening by immersing the listener in the music, revealing details with unparalleled clarity and depth. Listeners will feel like they are inside the song as music moves around and above them.\n\nThe album artwork has been reimagined especially for this release and presented in a digipak with a 16-page booklet, a sticker and a postcard. The front cover image still includes the iconic pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, conceived by Roger Waters. However, for this new release, the artwork has been re-created for the modern era by Storm Thorgerson's Hipgnosis partner Aubrey 'Po' Powell and Peter Curzon from StormStudios, and shows the historic building as it looks now, complete with light projections, variations of which feature in the accompanying booklet. The projections and graphics were mapped and designed by Peter Curzon for the launch of the 2018 Remix and the photography is by Rupert Truman and Benny Trickett with Aubrey Powell.\n\nThe Animals 2018 Remix is also available on CD, LP (with gatefold artwork), SACD and Deluxe Gatefold formats. The Deluxe Gatefold version includes LP, CD, audio Blu-ray, audio DVD and a 32-page book. You can use the following links to order the new Dolby Atmos Blu-ray, or indeed any of the other Animals 2018 Remix editions.

THE STORY OF SYD BARRETT AND PINK FLOYD: DVD and BLU-RAY, AND DIGITAL\n\nOUT NOW - Released July 19th, 2024\n\nJust announced: the DVD and Blu-ray, and digital release, of Have You Got It Yet? The Story of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd is coming on July 19th, 2024.\n\nThe critically acclaimed - and fan acclaimed - documentary film Have You Got It Yet? is a compelling dive into the life and genius of Syd. Directed by award-winning filmmaker Roddy Bogawa and the late, acclaimed album cover designer Storm Thorgerson, the feature length documentary drew praise for its candid glimpse into the prismatic character and artistry of Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett.\n\nReleased in cinemas worldwide in Summer 2023, Have You Got It Yet? achieved a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a successful theatrical run with many sold-out screenings. Intimate interviews with band members David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Roger Waters uncover Barrett's ongoing impact on the group. Going a step further, the film also includes an interview with Syd's sister, Rosemary Breen. Narrated by actor Jason Isaacs, the film also features original band managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King, as well as The Who's Pete Townshend and Blur's Graham Coxon.\n\nIn addition to the full-length film, the joint DVD and Blu-ray set includes a plethora of bonus features. Two poignant live performances of Arnold Layne are highlighted – the first features David Gilmour & David Bowie (originally released in Gilmour's Remember That Night Live At The Royal Albert Hall, 2007). The second is a performance from 2007's The Madcap's Last Laugh – a tribute concert held at London's Barbican for Syd Barrett featuring Gilmour, Mason, and Richard Wright in their final performance as Pink Floyd.\n\nAdditionally, the DVD and Blu-ray includes an interview with Bogawa and director & producer commentary of the film with Bogawa, Rupert Truman, and Julius Beltrame. Further exploring his creative works, the set features discussions surrounding Barrett's paintings, and spoken word performances of Barrett's lyrics by comedian Noel Fielding (Dark Globe), poet Rob Fitterman (Rats) and actor Gerard Bell (Lucifer Sam). The package, designed by StormStudios, is completed with an exclusive Have You Got It Yet? poster, which was also designed by the studio.\n\nThe documentary is a fascinating and moving look at Barrett and we heartily recommend it. It's great news that it is finally getting a physical/digital release, enabling those who are yet to see it, the opportunity.\n\nUPDATE: we have had confirmation from those behind this release, that there is NO region coding on either the Blu-ray, or DVD, so both should be playable worldwide. Great news indeed!\n\nYou can order this special edition through the following links, whilst helping this site with its ongoing running costs, at no additional cost to you, as we participate in the Amazon affiliate programme.

Everything Under the Sun: The Complete Guide to Pink Floyd promises a comprehensive look at the band.\n\nThe publishers told us that \"Everything Under the Sun will be a high-level, fully sourced and footnoted analysis of the music of Pink Floyd (akin to Revolution in the Head by Ian MacDonald about The Beatles), and the first serious survey of the group's work and achievements. As such, it will also be a cultural history of the UK, seen through the prism of the band\".\n\nThey continued: \"While there is a plethora of books about Pink Floyd and by Pink Floyd former members, none are truly comprehensive or do what this book seeks to do. Some give bald introductions to the songs with analysis, others give stories and anecdotes, and potted histories. But Everything Under the Sun will be the definitive book. In addition to a song-by-song analysis, it will include exclusive band interviews, a full chronology and gig guide, and a full bootleg guide. It will be the go-to book for any Pink Floyd fan\".\n\nIt certainly sounds an interesting proposition, and as I'm regularly consulting numerous sources for Floyd information, if this book can reduce what I need to reach for on a daily basis that's definitely welcomed!\n\nORDERING INFO:\n\nOrders are now possible through a number of retailers. Ordering any item after entering Amazon through our links helps with BD's ongoing running costs as we participate in their affiliate scheme, at no extra cost to yourselves, and we really appreciate it: Amazon UK, Amazon.com, Amazon Canada, Amazon France, Amazon Germany, Amazon Spain and Amazon Italy.\n\nDAVID GILMOUR: LUCK AND STRANGE - CD, LP, BLU-RAY and Digital\n\nRELEASED September 6th 2024\n\nNow announced is David Gilmour's new album, Luck and Strange. It is his first new album in nine years. The album will be released on September 6th, on Sony Music, on LP, CD, Blu-ray and digital. Deluxe LP and CD boxsets will be announced in the coming weeks. The first track from the album - The Piper's Call - will be released Thursday, April 25th, following a world exclusive first play on the BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show. A video for the song will be available to watch from Friday, April 26th. Full track listings are shown below.\n\nLuck and Strange was recorded over five months in Brighton and London and is Gilmour's first album of new material in nine years. The record was produced by David and Charlie Andrew, best known for his work with ALT-J and Marika Hackman. Of this new working relationship, David says, \"We invited Charlie to the house, so he came and listened to some demos, and said things like, \"Well, why does there have to be a guitar solo there?\" and \"Do they all fade out? Can't some of them just end?\". He has a wonderful lack of knowledge or respect for this past of mine. He's very direct and not in any way overawed, and I love that. That is just so good for me because the last thing you want is people just deferring to you.\"\n\nThe majority of the album's lyrics have been composed by Polly Samson, Gilmour's co-writer and collaborator for the past thirty years. Samson says of the lyrical themes covered on Luck and Strange, \"It's written from the point of view of being older; mortality is the constant.\" Gilmour elaborates, \"We spent a load of time during and after lockdown talking about and thinking about those kind of things.\" Polly has also found the experience of working with Charlie Andrew liberating. \"He wants to know what the songs are about, he wants everyone who's playing on them to have the ideas that are in the lyric informing their playing. I have particularly loved it for that reason.\"\n\nThe album features eight new tracks along with a reworking of The Montgolfier Brothers' Between Two Points and has artwork and photography by the renowned artist Anton Corbijn. Musicians contributing to the record include Guy Pratt and Tom Herbert on bass, Adam Betts, Steve Gadd and Steve DiStanislao on drums, Rob Gentry and Roger Eno on keyboards with string and choral arrangements by Will Gardner. The title track also features the late Pink Floyd keyboard player Richard Wright, recorded in 2007 at a jam in a barn at David's house.\n\nSome contributions emerged from the live streams that Gilmour and family performed to a global audience during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021; Romany Gilmour sings, plays the harp and appears on lead vocals on Between Two Points Gabriel Gilmour also sings backing vocals.\n\nThe album's cover image, photographed and designed by Anton Corbijn, is inspired by a lyric written by Charlie Gilmour for the album's final song Scattered. Of working with his family on Luck and Strange, David says, \"Polly and I have been writing together for over thirty years and the Von Trapped live streams showed the great blend of Romany's voice and harp-playing and that led us into a feeling of discarding some of the past that I'd felt bound to and that I could throw those rules out and do whatever I felt like doing, and that has been such a joy.\"\n\nTRACK LISTINGS FOR DAVID GILMOUR: LUCK AND STRANGE\n\nVINYL - gatefold sleeve and booklet with photography and design by Anton Corbijn\n\nSIDE ONE:\n\nBlack Cat*\n\nLuck and Strange\n\nThe Piper's Call\n\nA Single Spark\n\nVita Brevis*\n\nBetween Two Points** - with Romany Gilmour\n\nSIDE TWO:\n\nDark and Velvet Nights\n\nSings\n\nScattered***\n\nCD - album plus two bonus tracks; digipak and booklet with photography and design by Anton Corbijn\n\nBlack Cat*\n\nLuck and Strange\n\nThe Piper's Call\n\nA Single Spark\n\nVita Brevis*\n\nBetween Two Points** - with Romany Gilmour\n\nDark and Velvet Nights\n\nSings\n\nScattered***\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n\nYes, I Have Ghosts\n\nLuck and Strange (original Barn Jam)*\n\nBlu-ray – AUDIO ONLY - album in Dolby Atmos and high-resolution stereo mixes plus four bonus tracks; digipak and booklet with photography and design by Anton Corbijn\n\nBlack Cat*\n\nLuck and Strange\n\nThe Piper's Call\n\nA Single Spark\n\nVita Brevis*\n\nBetween Two Points** - with Romany Gilmour\n\nDark and Velvet Nights\n\nSings\n\nScattered***\n\nBONUS TRACKS in Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res stereo:\n\nYes, I Have Ghosts\n\nLuck and Strange (original Barn Jam)*\n\nA Single Spark (Orchestral)*\n\nScattered (Orchestral)*\n\nAll songs Music: David Gilmour.

Written by music industry expert Mark Cunningham, who used to run the magazine Total Production International, Pink Floyd: A Live Sound History is due at some point but to whet your appetites, Mark has given us a sneak preview of what's to come.\n\nThe book will tell the story of how Pink Floyd pioneered live sound and how equipment manufacturers fought to keep up with the band's demands for better, bigger and higher quality, in tandem with their equally adventurous touring stage productions. It will feature rare images and exclusive interviews conducted by me with key touring personnel and industry figures including Robbie Williams, Phil Taylor, Mick Kluczynski, Andy Jackson, James Guthrie, Buford Jones, Charlie Watkins (WEM), Alan Parsons, Seth Goldman, Bryan Grant and more.\n\nA large portion of the manuscript was actually proof-read by Roger Waters who made comments that have informed the content.\n\nSolo tours up to and including The Wall Live will also feature, as a way of highlighting the further progression of live sound influenced by the Floyd.\n\nAt this stage, a firm date isn't available, nor are pre-orders being invited. As soon as more information is available, we will of course update you...\n\nPossibly in 2024:\n\nRoger Waters - The Dark Side Of The Moon tour film\n\nWe have had confirmation from Roger's manager, Mark Fenwick, that Roger is still working on a film of TDSOTM live show, but until it is finished there will be no release scheduled. As soon as we have more details of what this release (will it be a cinema release, or in DVD and hopefully Bluray format?) will involve, we will let you know. It is encouraging though to get official word on this, which we know from the feedback we've had will be incredibly popular! Having said that, with the subsequent release of Roger Waters The Wall, and Us + Them, will Roger now consider TDSOTM live only of historical interest, and not worth a release?\n\nThe Wall 1980/81 DVD release\n\nOne thing that has caused tidal waves of anticipation within the Floyd community is the growing talk that the original Pink Floyd Wall concerts from 1980/81 may well get a DVD release soon. Roger has been alluding to this in various interviews recently so the thought is gathering pace...\n\nThe Wall on Broadway\n\nWork is presumably still ongoing on this, and in July 2014, Lee Hall who is working on the production's book with Roger, revealed that workshops would be taking place in the autumn/fall 2014.\n\nOfficial film about Pink Floyd\n\nIn an interview with Rhythm Magazine published at the end of August 2010, Nick talks about a film that is in the works about Pink Floyd that he has been working on...this may have been superseded by The Early/Later Years box sets though, or by material displayed as part of The Pink Floyd Exhibition: Their Mortal Remains.\n\nRoger Waters - vinyl remasters\n\nDoug Sax, mastering engineer for Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Pink Floyd since 1983, is interviewed at length in the 2011 edition of \"The Absolute Sound\" Guide to Vinyl Playback, and confirms that \"I'm going to be doing the Roger Waters albums on vinyl and they have extraordinary low end, requiring an astonishing amount of vertical modulation. We use up the full depth available on a lacquer master. You can't do anything like that on DMM. It's very thin; you can't go deep. For that kind of thing it could be an absolute joke.\" As work is yet to start on them, it will be some time before there's any release information, but sounds good that Sax is taking his customary care to ensure these sound as good as they can."
