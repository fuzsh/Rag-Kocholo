        "text": "Mark Knopfler‘s Guitar Heroes have shared the official video for the new version of ‘Going Home’, which reveals a “who’s who” of guest collaborators on the track.\n\nThe star-studded re-recording of Knopfler’s 1983 solo single was released last Friday (March 15) in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust and Teen Cancer America.\n\nREAD MORE: Roger Daltrey on Teenage Cancer Trust and the chances of new music from The Who\n\nClocking in at almost 10 minutes, the new take on the Local Hero theme song sees the Dire Straits frontman join forces with a host of rock icons including the likes of Queen‘s Brian May, Bruce Springsteen, Black Sabbath’s Tony Iommi, Eric Clapton and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood.\n\nAdditionally, the Guitar Heroes’ take on ‘Going Home’ contains the last ever recording by the late Jeff Beck – which he laid down for the single shortly before his death in January 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnopfler also enlisted The Beatles‘ Ringo Starr on drums, Sting on bass and The Who frontman (and Teenage Cancer Trust patron) Roger Daltrey on harmonica.\n\nArriving today (March 22), the music video for ‘Going Home’ reveals who plays which parts on the collaborative charity single. The visuals, animated by the Electric Theatre Collective, display the names of each musician as their respective contributions play out.\n\nRecommended\n\nThese are combined with various music-themed graphics, such as a person smashing up a guitar as ‘Going Home’ becomes more intense during Tom Morello‘s solo in the eighth minute.\n\nYou can watch the video in full above, and download ‘Going Home’ here.\n\nThe full list of contributors to the re-recording is:\n\nJoan Armatrading\n\nJeff Beck\n\nRichard Bennett\n\nJoe Bonamassa\n\nJoe Brown\n\nJames Burton\n\nJonathan Cain\n\nPaul Carrack\n\nEric Clapton\n\nRy Cooder\n\nJim Cox\n\nSteve Cropper\n\nSheryl Crow\n\nDanny Cummings\n\nRoger Daltrey\n\nDuane Eddy\n\nSam Fender\n\nGuy Fletcher\n\nPeter Frampton\n\nAudley Freed\n\nVince Gill\n\nDavid Gilmour\n\nBuddy Guy\n\nKeiji Haino\n\nTony Iommi\n\nJoan Jett\n\nJohn Jorgenson\n\nMark Knopfler\n\nSonny Landreth\n\nAlbert Lee\n\nGreg Leisz\n\nAlex Lifeson\n\nSteve Lukather\n\nPhil Manzanera\n\nDave Mason\n\nHank Marvin\n\nBrian May\n\nRobbie McIntosh\n\nJohn McLaughlin\n\nTom Morello\n\nRick Nielsen\n\nOrianthi\n\nBrad Paisley\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nMike Rutherford\n\nJoe Satriani\n\nJohn Sebastian\n\nConnor Selby\n\nSlash\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nRingo Starr\n\nZak Starkey\n\nSting\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nSusan Tedeschi\n\nDerek Trucks\n\nIan Thomas\n\nPete Townshend\n\nKeith Urban\n\nSteve Vai\n\nWaddy Wachtel\n\nJoe Louis Walker\n\nJoe Walsh\n\nRonnie Wood\n\nGlenn Worf\n\nZucchero\n\nThe new take on ‘Going Home’ was recorded at British Grove Studios in west London, and produced by Knopfler’s longtime collaborator Guy Fletcher. As for Jeff Beck’s contribution, Fletcher described it as “absolutely meant to be. And what he did with it, it just brings you to tears.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Knopfler’s Guitar Heroes’ charity track is currently in a race with Beyoncé‘s ‘Texas Hold ‘Em’ for the UK’s Number One single, per Official Charts. Knopfler took the top spot in the latest chart update, but was leading with less than 1,000 units.\n\nThis week’s UK singles chart will be announced later today."
