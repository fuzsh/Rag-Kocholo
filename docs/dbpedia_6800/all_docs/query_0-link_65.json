Don't say I didn't warn you!!\n\nIntroduction\n\n<Quarrymn@aol.com> (23.03.2000)\n\nI am sure John whatever his lasat name is, (from the Who) is a good bass guitarist, but to actually claim him as the greatest bass player ever....hehehhaha, not so my foe! I am afraid that goes to the worthy master sir Paul McCartney! No one has ever been nor will there ever be anyone as creative, powerful, energetic, graceful, and totally unpredictable as Paul. He is simply the best. But I dont need to tell you this, just ask around, read some books, like Rolling Stone, and other magazines whom have already voted that Paul is the greatest bass player. By the way I could probably name five more bass players in front of your man johnny!\n\nSure you might be saying\"All he likes is beatles....They are the best, but I also love others most of whom you have already denied credibilty!\n\nQuuzlfut <quuzlfut@bellsouth.net> (01.04.2000)\n\nThe Who were without doubt one of the most influencial bands in rock history, and credit for that has to go to Pete Townshend (along with his supporting cast, of course). As for bass players, Entwistle is an outstanding and innovative one, and he's certainly among the best, but I'll agree with Quarrymn that there are many others who were (are) just as talented and innovative, if not more so. McCartney is a great one, but let's recognize Chris Squire and Geddy Lee, too. (Squire is probably my personal favorite).\n\n[Special author note: I think you guys take this problem in a bit too shallow way. I'm not going to argue whether Entwistle's technique superated Squire's or not (although it certainly superated McCartney's - saying that Paul was the best bass player ever is carrying the Fab Four worship a bit too far); but fact is that John was there the first, and it was John who actually transformed the rock bass guitar into an independent, respectable instrument, not just a rusty part of a rhythm section. And at least one thing about his technique I know - he's the fastest bass player in rock. Like I said, check out the 1990 version of 'Sparks' and show me Chris Squire or Geddy Lee playing those tricks.]\n\n<TDL133@aol.com> (02.04.2000)\n\noh oh, major disagreement coming here! I know lots of people love the Who , but i just dont see why. You can count the number of decent tracks they did on one hand! I do agree with you that Townsend writes and plays for himself and not the fans and this is probably why i dont care for them. They are (and were in the case of Moon) good musicians but I just dont think that much of the music. They resort to conceptual albums and ' rock operas' to mask the lack of musical diversity and creative ideas ( i do not consider these as creative as i would call them tactics).oh well, thats why i like this site-you have you're opinion and are kind enough to let me voice mine! Thanks!\n\nFredrik Tydal <f_tydal@hotmail.com> (14.04.2000)\n\nIt's diffcult (or 'it's hard', heh) to start at the right place in The Who catalogue. If you're not careful, you might pick the wrong album and be completely turned off by the band forever. I can easily understand some of the comments here, since I shared the same opinions as them once. You know, growing up in the eighties, hearing people naming the The Who as \"sell outs\" and not refering to the 1967 album. One of the best places to start with The Who is probably the excellent compilation My Generation: The Very Best Of The Who. But that mostly features The Singles Who, and not The Album Who. The Album Who is an important part of the group, preferably experienced in Tommy. Tommy is a great place to start with for new-comers. First, it's much music for your money since it's a double LP remastered on one CD. Secondly, if you don't like it on first listen you eventually *have* to listen to it again, having no choice since you bought it. Soon enough, the magic will come through; Tommy just can't go wrong, with those riffs and melodies you think you've heard your whole life. Then you can proceed to Quadrophenia and so on... Who's Next is a good place to start for The Rockin' Who. Every classic rock fan will love that album. Where to not start is A Quick One, The Who Sell Out or anything after Quadrophenia. I still think that Sell Out is overrated and it will probably put off any Who novice at once. So, anyone who is prejudical or critical about The Who without really having heard them, pick up Tommy, Who's Next or the mentioned compilation. It will be worth it.\n\nPhilip Maddox <slurmsmckenzie@hotmail.com> (02.07.2000)\n\nMy Who collection isn't complete (yet), but I have most of their most important albums. These guys are really good, of course. Roger was a great vocalist, Pete was a really good guitarist, Keith is the best drummer ever, and John is an amazing bass player. Listen to Live At Leeds - this is just 3 guys making all that noise! That's impressive! They wrote great tunes, too - as of today, I like every Who album I have (Sell Out, Tommy, Leeds, Who's Next, Who Are You, and My Generation: The Best of the Who). Very talented, indeed. Of course, they're certainly still touring for the sole purpose of making money - there a concert coming to town on 7/5/2000 and the tickets cost $130 apiece! Luckily, I got some for nothing, so I'm going, but I'd never pay $130 for a concert ticket (I only paid $25 for the Tull concert I'm attending later this year). Their endless pursuit of the dollar (or pound, as they're English) has tarnished their reputation, but it hardly subtracts from all of the great music they made.\n\nAnd a note about bass players - John was great, but for pure style and flash, check out Les Claypool of Primus - that guy can jam! He's my favorite bass player, though John certainly isn't far behind. John was more innovative for sure, though. Just listen to 'Boris the Spider'... aw man, that bass line rules! P.S. After seeing the Who live, Entwistle has easily moved up to being my favorite bass player. He just never stopped! His fingers were absolutely flying across the bass the entire time. I might also add that the Who in general were amazing! No backup musicians outside of a keyboard player. Pete did windmills! Roger swung his mic and bore his chest! Great show, probably the best I've ever seen. They actually seemed inspired for a group that hasn't recorded together in 18 years. But like I said - never again will I say I've seen a better bass player than John (unless I see one, which I doubt).\n\nAdrian <HanzDaBird@aol.com> (19.08.2000)\n\nI had only been familiar with the Who through their hits and the few albums I have, which I admittedly don't listen to that much. Still when the chance arose to see them live, I went for it. They played Thursday (Aug. 17th) here in San Diego, and I didn't know what to expect. I knew that they had legendary live shows, but I also knew that they were in there fifties and wasn't sure how much energy they could channel. Well, I could go on for hours about how awesome the show was, how it was probably the best concert I've been to, etc...etc... But I won't. I'll just stick to comments on each bad member and how they affected the show.\n\nRoger Daltrey- The man still has the roar and is also the youngest looking out of the crew. Some people just age well I guess. Well, vocally he's sounding better then ever....and that roar...we were treated to it over and over. He also played some mean harmonica and did his signature mic twirl. He even took up the guitar on 'The Kids Are All right'. Still an amazing front-man. John Entwisle- I totally agree, the BEST bass player in rock. He has this 5 minute bass solo during 'Be My Wife' I believe, and I still can't believe how effortlessly his fingers moved across the strings. He was definitely Mr. Cool and Professional that night, standing in one place the whole time, playing in the shadows. He has no need to be flashy because his instrument speaks for itself. Pete Townshend- I could go on about him all night as well. A 56 year-old is not supposed to have that much energy. He played every song like it was the last, abusing his guitar, windmill arms and fast licks, running and jumping... His stage presence was inspiring. Another thing, I've never though of Pete as an amazing soloist...just a great rhythm player. But at the show, he played some of the fastest and best licks I've heard in a while. He is what a rock star should be. He is a legend. Keith Moon- Yes, I know Mr. Moon left us long ago...actually one year before I was born... So what can I say about their drummer that night? Well, he channeled the spirit of Keith perfectly. Every roll was there, ever beat and bashing snare was right-on. One could almost imagine that Keith was still with them. This guy was one of the best drummers I've seen in a long time. Oh yeah...his name? Zack Starkey...yep, Ringo's son!!! And to be honest, he blows his dad away. So for lack of a better term, the Who still kick ass. New and old bands should take a lesson from them. For they are still the masters of the live show. Pete is famous for his line: \"Hope I die before I get old!\" Thankfully, he's still a 20-year-old punk!\n\nShaun Tatarka <statarka@wendt.com> (25.09.2000)\n\nGeorge, Where are you from? Are you from the US? If so have you seen the WHO reunioun tour. If you are from the UK, I swear on the grave of my grandparents that you will love it! It's no tlike the Who on Ice from the other tours. CHECK IT OUT! I saw them at the Gorge In Washington State and they were awesome! (Better than a Rod show, which you ARE a moron for never seeing!)\n\nDenis <veronika@mail.saratov.ru> (26.09.2000)\n\nWell The Who is one of my favourite groups along with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and others classics.\n\nPete Townshend is one of the greatest guitarists ever and John and Keith also very very good instrumentalists. I have A Quick One, Sell Out, Who's Next, Quadrophenia, Odds&Sods, By Numbers (It's one of my favourite albums.I like 'They Are All In Love' and 'How many friends'),Face Dances. I Also got the first Roger Daltrey's disc. Well The Who=great vocal+great guitar+great bass=great drums.\n\n<RichardMelchior@aol.com> (16.11.2000)\n\nThe Who are the most divisive force in rock 'n roll. Even though they're an extraordinarily popular band, they're as strongly disliked by their detractors as they're loved by their fans.\n\nHave you ever noticed that, in the case of most classic rock bands, even people with the worst tastes in music (even people who like today's pop crap at a point in time its reached its nadir) can appreciate at least some of the music. Everybody likes some Zeppelin, some Beatles, some Stones and some Doors, but they never admit to liking The Who. To a fan, The Who's music sounds so natural - the way rock 'n roll was meant to sound - rebellious and raw but with civilizing elements of brains and spirituality. You can't dance to The Who but you can thrash around and - more importantly - think to it. The Who's instrument-smashing and Pete's windmill guitar-playing seem cartoonish to their detractors. Who fans see these things - at least before they became de facto parts of their musical presentation - as more than pointless destruction and theatrism. They're representations of an attitude towards life and society some people have. A guitar is just a material object, destroy it - reject society's materialism and mores and think for yourself - question everything. That's the message I've always got out of The Who's music anyway.\n\nDerrick Stuart <MSDK84@email.msn.com> (27.11.2000)\n\nThe Who were and still are a great group. All four of them were very talented, (with their instruments). Pete was the intellectual, Roger was the though guy, Keith was the comic, and John was the quiet, romantic type dude with a sick sense of humor. In the early days they had many conflicts, (Roger's temper, Roger and Pete wanting to do 'intellectual' music while Keith and John just wanted to have fun) but they stuck together until Keith died, and long afterwards. Their 69-73 period I would say is their best, with rock operas, synth experimentation to boot but still being a hard rockin' quartet. They are one of the most intelligent and talented hard-rock bands.\n\n<Spongemo@aol.com> (30.11.2000)\n\nI cant agree with you more concerning your statement of John. Geddy Lee Chris Squire and Paul Mcartney all had the luxury of playing with a supporting and accomidating cast of fellows. John had to play with Moon, who if anything is probably the one most responsible for the way John plays. For those that doubt, listen to Live at Leeds turning the balance to the right. The show was recorded with the bass and drums panned to the right and Petes guitar and lead vocals on the left. You hear exactly what is taking place in what appears to be pure chaos. John accomadates Moon while staying on the heels of Pete thus keeping all of the members from losing it. His vocals on 'Heaven and Hell' are incredible as well as his back up vocals. John doesnt get the credit because people who have never played are the ones doing the critiquing.Pete was the brains Roger was the brash Moon was the bruit force but John was the musician the meat and potatoes and presence of power that allowed the rest of Who to be showman.\n\nDan Miller <Dan.Miller@phs.com> (15.12.2000)\n\nNo gamble here. John Entwistle is the best rock bassist. I think you hit the nail on the head, no need to expand here. If \"Sparks\" or \"The Real Me\" doesn't hammer this fact home, listen to his solo on the otherwise disposable Roger Daltrey CD A Celebration: Music of ... The Who. Even better, if you've ever seen the video (it was on public television for a while), you'll know what I mean.\n\nAs a bass player myself, I can vouch for this. Paul McCartney certainly is a gifted, excellent player and was largely (if not solely) responsible for the Beatles' rhythmic foundation. While his playing makes for some great \"air bass\" fun on \"She's So Heavy\" and \"Silly Love Songs,\" he must assume the backseat to Entwistle, as must Jack Bruce, Chris Squire and Geddy Lee. Rolling Stone be damned! Damned be Rolling Stone! Damned Stone be Rolling ... you get the drift.\n\nNickolay Anoschenko <anoschenko@yahoo.com> (16.12.2000)\n\nThe Who were a unique band of the 60's (together with many other bands). What is the most important thing about them is that they could actually handle their instruments. They could when they started but they progresed with time and by the end of the 60's they became one of the most professional bands, espesialy live.\n\nThey were also a band, who made many revolutionary styles (rock operas ('A quick one' was the first one? not S/F/Sorrow) and statements (my fovorite beeing \"often a bad sound is much more audience provoking, than a good sound\", and rememmber- they could outplay anyone in 65) Townshed knew, where his strenghs lay, so he never pretended to be a solo guitarist or anything. And still, when you listen closely to Quadrophenia you realize, that this man could craft brilliant solos. Pretty cool stage acting too. And he was a gifted songwriter. Entwistle is a great bass player. Although I respect Beatles very much, I must admit that McCartney could never compete with John. Dalatrey was a good vocalist who he could handle his voice (not counting the first two albums). Moon- was fantastic drummer. And although his drumming was sometimes sloppy, it was purely brilliant. And his greatest advantage over Bonzo and Paice is that he was NEVER given a drum solo.\n\nbdoglb <bdoglb@hotmail.com> (22.12.2000)\n\nYour ranking of John Entwistle as the greatest bass player on the planet is ABSOLUTELY correct. With all due respect to Sir Paul...place the two on stage together and Mr. Entwhistle BLOWS HIM AWAY!! Style and ability,and the ability to reinvent on stage are paramount when comparing musicians. I have seen both live(as well as many more) and to compare them is fine,but to give the nod to Paul is absurd. All you Paul fans(and I am one of them) should take time to listen before judging. Listen to live WHO (5:15 on last years blues to the bush album...or get the free mp3 down load of 5:15 from petetownshend.com(in the diary section) you will soon learn the difference. It was not by mistake that in 1999 John Entwhistle was named \"Bassist of the Millenium\"...Paul came in # 2 folloed by John Paul Jones and Jack Bruce. The contest is really not even close. Sorry .\n\nI saw the show at Great Woods..the stage show broke down, pete got pissed..yelled at the band. It was great!!!! he proceeded to pick up the electic guitar(which was a rare thing then) jam out several classic Who tune (8min. Magic Bus!!) Great Show!\n\n<DyfedBob@aol.com> (26.12.2000)\n\nI first saw the Who, as a student in Cardiff in 1965, in their guitar smashing days and left the venue exhausted.\n\n35 years later my son got tickets for one of their reunion concerts which took place in Birmingham Arena (uk) last October 2000. Their performance was stunning and it was wonderful to see. Where do they get their energy & enthusiasm from? If John Entwhistle is not the best bass player (I favour Jack Bruce in this esteemed position) then he certainly rides high amongst the all time greats. In passing, whilst McCartney may be one of the greatest songwriters his bassplaying was about as original as Ringos drumming. Talking about drumming Zack Starkey, who appeared with the Who, put in an exceptional performance.\n\nMorten Felgenhauer <Morten.Felgenhauer@kvaerner.com> (03.01.2001)\n\nIt is somewhat silly to discuss who is the \"best\" bass player - Paul or John - on this page, but I just can't help commenting myself. The two men approaches their instruments from completely different angles. The way I see it Paul \"composes\" his bass lines and often puts as much effort in them as in the vocal lines. He also has a full rich tone in his instrument, which makes it possible to actually hear every note he is playing, although the bass doesn't dominate the overall picture. This is best appreciated in the period 69-76. Why has he let other people play \"his\" instrument in later years? John has a much less structured way of playing - he often improvises around the chords and his lines often aren't instantly recognizeable. Technically he is the best of the two, though, and he is more important to the sound of The Who than most people realize.\n\nIf you are are a competent bass player it's \"easy\" to play Paul because his lines are so clearly defined. To play Who songs, you have to adapt the style of John, which isn't such an easy task. Let's not forget Bill Wyman, by the way. Musically he belongs between the two others. I love them all.\n\nBrian Hobbs <bdhobbs1@swbell.net> (18.01.2001)\n\nI am a true fan of The Who as a band and of each member as artists. I am also a lover of R & R and R & B. My opinion of the top three in this category are: The Beatles, Elvis Presley and The Who, respectively. Each member of The Who contributed equally. Without either member, The Who would not have been. Roger Daltrey started the band and brought all the players together. Pete Townshend contributes with the greatest realm of artistry-playing guitar and keyboard, singing and composing. John Entwhistle is THE BEST bass guitarist ever! He also sings and has tried his hand at composing (Dangerous). Keith Moon was not the best drummer, but he gave the ultimate drumming experience for The Who. Roger Daltrey remains the business end of The Who. I firmly believe that if it were not for Roger, the band would have dissipated and all gone the way of Keith. Roger was kicked out of the band in 1969 because he protested so much about the alcohol and drug abuse. When their latest release at that time hit the charts, he was quickly brought back into the fold. You can easily think of other bands that didn't fare so well with one of their original members gone. When Keith died, The Who thought that was the end of them. But, they managed to come together and continue. I went to their last concert and have to say that they haven't lost any of their power! Usually, men start to lose their range of pitch or commanding performance on stage. I can tell you, these men did not! They gave a raging performance of true Who quality. Keith Moon had a slight off-beat method of drumming that seemed to perfect every song ('I Can See For Miles'). 'Eminence Front' probably remains my favorite Who song.\n\nPalash Ghosh <palash7@hotmail.com> (08.03.2001)\n\nI agree with the previous commentator who said The Who are the most 'divisive' force in rock history -- that their detractors are as passionate as their admirers. It seems that you either love The Who or you hate them (sometimes, even if you love them, as I do, you often hate them as well!). It's well documented that The Who was (were?) the greatest live rock band in history, and, I lament the fact that I never saw them perform in person. But, by saying how great they were in concert seems to discount what truly great and innovative studio musicians they were as well:\n\n*John Entwistle was the greatest bass player in rock history (yes, Paul McCartney was great, too, but The Ox could improvise much better, while Sir Paul had to have everything written out in advance). *Keith was the greatest drummer in rock history (there's just no comparison to anybody else). *Pete and Roger, well their various merits can be debated endlessly. Pete was a great rhythm guitarist and soloist, but unfortunately, his early habit of smashing his guitars (the only 'gimmick' The Who ever really resorted to) left a bad taste in many people's mouths. Pete's songwriting skills went up, went down, disappeared, came back, then vanished again -- he was wildly erratic. But the best songs he ever wrote were the best songs EVER written by anybody, no doubt. But he wrote a lot of crap as well. This may have been inevitable since he had to bear the crushing load of writing 95% of the group's material! Yes, Entwistle contributed here and there, but he was hardly equal to Pete. (Imagine if Lennon had no McCartney or vice versa, would The Beatles' music have been nearly as good?). *Now we come to Roger -- like Pete's composing skills, Roger's voice was sometimes bad, sometimes great, sometimes over-the-top, sometimes inspiring, sometimes weak. I never liked Roger much, but I recognize how crucial he was to the group's success. As far as their albums go, one can easily follow their evolution and see the good, the bad and the ugly. From 1965 to 1967, they were unwashed, unrefined, unschooled, just learning the tricks of the trade clumsily as they went along. From 1967 to 1973, they were at their peak, made a lot of money, lost a lot of it. Then from about 1974 or 1975 they began a long and sad decline. Creation and self-destruction - and we could watch it all like voyeurs! Except for Roger, they all had serious drug and alcohol problems at one time or another, and they were quite open about it -- it's all documented. They were neither ashamed of it nor did they 'glorify' it. They just were what they were -- there was absolutely nothing phony or fake about The Who! Another weird thing about The Who (at least during their classic 1960's incarnation) was that they were a very 'masculine' band -- that is, girls simply did not like them! Apparently, people who attended their concerts in the 1960's were overwhelmingly male, presumably the same folks who attended English football matches or participated in race riots! In fact, I have never known a single woman in my life who liked or even tolerated The Who! The Beatles, of course, had legions of female fans from the very beginning; even The Stones always had girls crazy for them. But not Pete and his lads. Why was this? Was it because The Who were too ugly? Well, yeah, they were kinda ugly, even Roger, who despite having a handsome face, was very short and always acted like a belligerent punk. The Who appealed primarily to young males because they were all about aggression, anger, rage, rejection and violence -- that is, everything that every red-blooded adolescent boy feels or thinks about. The early Who were NOT about sex, love and romance - check out their early 'love songs,' they're usually about loss or jealousy or rejection or a painful longing (there's not an 'I want to hold your hand' or 'She loves you' anywhere in sight!). Let's face it, The Who were four angry, unattractive, dysfunctional working-class London boys - and this is precisely why I love them so much. As a boy, how could you NOT love The Who???? I guess that by the 1970's when Roger became a 'sex symbol' due to his 'Tommy alter-ego' and Pete started writing more introspective songs, women might've found them more appealing, I don't know. Not only that, but The Who often were in conflict with each other (in the early years, Roger was an obnoxious bully.) They were so REAL, so flesh and blood to me, not the phony creation of some public relations firm. Another thing is that, although The Who's appearance at Woodstock brought them into Americans' consciousness, they were as far from being hippies as could be! I really doubt the hippies liked them much. Even Pete's infatuation with the Indian mystic Meher Baba did not make him a hippie at all -- Pete was, despite his many flaws, very sincere, he didn't go looking for Baba because every Western kid was suddenly turned onto Eastern religions. As much as I loved The Beatles (and musically I rate them higher than The Who), I realized that I couldn't really identify with The Fab Four as much as I could with Pete, Roger, John and even Keith! Oh, and, yes, they should've called it quits when Keith died. When Keith expired, the group was dead. I pretty much despise and ignore what they did after 1978 or so. With Kenney Jones (surely a laughable successor to Keith) they became a boring, sterile ordinary band; and afterwards, with the interminable reunions tours and big-money corporate events, The Who really sank in my estimation (they have become almost as repellent to me as the aging Rolling Stones). I prefer to think of The Who as they once were, not what they have sadly turned into.\n\nGlenn Wiener <glennjwiener@hotmail.com> (17.06.2001)\n\nWhereas these guys were in third place in the British Invasion scene behind the Stones and the Beatles, there were many aspects where these guys exceded both the Beatels and Stones and others where they fell well short of them and other lesser successful bands. As individual musicians, The Who definitely had the edge over the fab four or five. Entwhistle was indeed a Bass God in his hey day. And Moons drumming is just out of this world. Townsends style is on a par with Richards and more distinctive that either Lennon or Harrison. And Daltrey has a great voice. Not just in power but in stylings and effects. His range is not small in any respect. But you are correct that it is his power that is his ultimate strength.\n\nWhere the Whos sound falls short of the Beatles and Stones is when integrated. As a unit there are many times, the guys all try to do too much. The result can be a strain on the listeners ears. Whereas Pete Townsend is a talented song-writer, sometimes the overblown nature of the Who as a band just is too much to take. On another note, Townsends vocals are OK as a divergence from Daltreys. However there are several songs ..'A Legal Matter', 'The Acid Queen', and 'Goin Mobile' where Townsend either sounds off key or just does not emote well. But his softer style particularly on 'Blue, Red, and Grey' are quite a nice change of pace from Daltreys lion like roar. Entwhistle contributes some interesting vocals here and there. Anyway, there is no doubt about it that the Who rank up there as universally great. Many of their songs 'Baba O Reilly', 'I Can See For Miles', 'Pinball Wizard', 'Substitute', 'Boris The Spider', 'Bargain', I could go on and on will live on forever. However, certain aspects of the band clearly out them in their place in the British Invasion. And that is clearly third.\n\nCarman Tse <pinballwizard1416@yahoo.com> (03.10.2001)\n\nMeaty Beaty is the best Who compilation there is. It is universally accepted as the greatest \"greatest hits\" disc there is. Also on there is a version of 'Magic Bus' with the complete intro (nothing absolutely important) and an alternate version of 'I'm a Boy'.\n\nOther items I'd highly recommend that you don't have are the 30 Years box set and the Quadrophenia soundtrack (it has a few tracks unique to it).\n\nRatko Hribar <stormbringer@email.hinet.hr> (06.10.2001)\n\nI have to notice that it's much easier for me to listen to 70 minutes of The Who than to a equally long CD of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. That, naturally, doesn't mean that I don't like those bands, and that doesn't even mean that those bands are much too overplayed, but somehow, they just get to tedious with time. Unlike them, I can't get enough of The Who, so they're in a much heavier rotation than any other 60's bands. I'm completely convinced that Daltrey has a much more enjoyable voice than McCartney, Lennon and, especially Jagger. I don't know if it's the range or whatever, but he rules !!! The rhythm section is magnificently powerful and consistently precise. Mr. Townshend isn't exactly a unbelievable vocalist but he does stand he's own ground. The problem is that he's not a too impressive as a guitarist, impeccable, but not so astonishing as Blackmore, Page or Clapton. Anyway, it's a great shame that they aren't so popular as the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, but that grave injustice was partially removed by their admittance to the rock 'n' roll hall of fame.\n\nSameer Barua <SBAMKMFDMDFMK@hotmail.com> (24.01.2002)\n\nTo the naysayers on John Entwistle being the greatest bassist ever - watch his bass solo in \"5:15\" on the Live at Royal Albert Hall 2000 DVD - you'll be eating your words for years.\n\nBen Kramer <bkramer2000@hotmail.com> (27.04.2002)\n\nYep, I totally agree with you. These guys are great, their spectacular. They are second on my list, only to The Beatles. Moon is a lunatic, yet he brings knowledge of his instrument with him. Entwistle is the greatest bassist I have ever heard. I have a bootleg version of '5:15' with they most technically stunning bass solo I have ever heard by far. For those of you reading this with audiogalaxy look up \"5:15 live (awesome bass solo)\" . The file is 13 minutes long, but it is worth every second of it to hear Entwistle play. As for Daltry, probably the best rock singer ever, though I really like Jagger. I can't decide who is better, but I know that they are both amazing. Daltry is the only rock singer who can scream and still sound like he is singing. Most sound like they are just going crazy and the vocals become a turnoff. Last, but not least comes Pete. Damn, this guy is talented. He has got to be one of the top five songwriters of rock & roll. His guitar, while not as staggering as Hendrix's, still sounds fabulous. When these guys came together, the sound is too good for words to describe. Even their low points have many redeeming qualities. The fact that they had all of the talent that anybody could ever want prevented disaster.\n\nGeneral Evaluation Listenability - 5+/5 - You gave McCartney a 5+, and these guys are more listenable than Paul. Resonance - 5/5 - If you look up the word \"resonance\" in the dictionary, it will say to listen to Quadrophenia. Originality - 5+/5 - The fathers of aggressive rock, the fathers of the rock opera, the fathers of hard rock more so than any other band... Adequacy - 5/5 - Gotta disagree with you. I like 'Song Is Over', and once again, if you can forgive Paul for all of the late shit, then I can forgive The Who for slight signs of mediocrity. Overall: 5++/5 Man I love The Who!\n\nEric Benac <benac@voyager.net> (24.05.2002)\n\nthe who are my favorite band. i've never heard a band i identify with more. although, i recognize that the beatles are much better, i just don't gell with them like i do with the who. john entwistle is the most amazing bass player ever. he plays so amazingly, and it never seems like he's just being flashy, it seems like he HAD to play like that to keep the band together. pete is under rated as a guitarist. people rairly ever say \"yeah, pete townshend did that feedback thing.\" it's always \"hendrix hendrix hendrix!\" and sure, hendrix beat them at the feedback thing, no doubt about it. he was better at it. but pete beats hendrix every other way!!! one of the most amazing song writers ever, one of the best lyrics writer ever, one of the finest singers ever, one of the most diverse musicians ever. and even in his solo career he really tries hard to push into other areas, really hard, but he fails quite a bit (psychoderelict any one?). nobody drums like keith moon. nobody has, nobody ever will. i really can't say anything about his drumming it defies analysis. roger daltrey is one of the most powerful vocalists of all time, and although he can't hit the high or low notes (like you said) that well, he can sing all matter of songs, and sing them convincingly.\n\nadd all this together, for one of the greatest bands ever!!! five plus for everything.\n\nEric Kleinbrink <ekleinbrink@yahoo.com> (29.09.2002)\n\nFirst off... I love the Who. The 'attitude' was pure punk. The Kinks may have the first punk song, but, The Who were actual punks! I hate to say this, George, but I would not give The Who a 5 rating ! I just don't think they are anywhere near the class of the Beatles. Sure, they can play their instruments better , and they were definately a better live band..... but, the music is pretty sketchy, especially their 70's & 80's stuff. I think they started taking themselves too seriously after Tommy (The Kinks Arthur is better!!). Personally, I think The Kinks were further along with their songwriting, in the mid sixties.\n\nAnyway, long live The Who ! ( I give them a solid 4)\n\nGeorge Bepko <drbepper@snet.net> (20.10.2002)\n\nHi,\n\nI discovered your site quite by accident, and I'm am so glad I did. I' m a 43 year old die hard Who nut, since '69. You tell it like it is, and you made me laugh several times over this weekend with your candid and true assessments. It's great to know that there are others out there that realize that The Who, although musically brilliant at times, really did come up with a lot of crap, too. The magic bus ride was still worth it for the great stuff. Thanks again!\n\n<Bmdaly71@aol.com> (12.02.2003)\n\nBeing a diehard WHO fan for twenty years now, I have compiled a short list of the 5 most incredible, yet underrated WHO songs ever.\n\nThe first is \"Success Story\" written by John Entwistle. This song is pure classic rock and roll and has a great and furious rhythm which never lets up. I can't imagine how this song never became a huge WHO hit. I have never heard the Who perform this song live and its a shame. Even George Harrison of The Beatles had his brilliant moments in songwriting! The second song is \"Relay\" written by Pete Townshend. This Who song originated from the early aborted Lifehouse project and is featured on the Hooligans album. This song was ahead of its time and delivers a captivating and impressive rhythm; a kind of a futuristic and sci-fi-sounding quality. I finally heard this song played live on the Who's Live at Royal Albert Hall concert and it was great although I still prefer the original album version. The third song is \"Sister Disco\" by Townshend. This song has a part sung solely by Townshend and an immediate subsequent solo by Daltrey which is absolutely incredibly uplifting and powerful (in a Tommy-esque sort of way); giving me the goosebumps everytime I listen to it. Although this song was a minor hit; it never received the respect that it deserved. The fourth song is \"Music Must Change.\" This steadfast song sung brilliantly by Daltrey is a slow and powerful crescendo of a rock song; sung softly at first and then finally raging into an awesome display of furious rhythm and blues. An excellent example of a classic rock and roll ballad which is neither too soft-sounding nor too loud. Last but not least, is \"905\" by John Entwistle. This song, like \"Relay\", has a sci-fi feel to it and is both original lyrically and in sound. It is the story of a futuristic robot brought to life with the excellent use of keyboards. It is precisely these synthesizers which bring this song alive and into the \"underrated Who song Hall of Fame.\" I hope there are diehard Who fans out there who agree with my assessment of the 5 most underrated Who songs of all time.\n\nSergey Suslov <suslov@intertransl.com> (18.04.2003)\n\nIt took me THIRTY years to understand how great they are. The breakthrough came with Who Are You? (the entire album). And John's bass... yes he's the greatest.\n\nLloyd Peppard <peppardl@post.queensu.ca> (26.04.2003)\n\nGod, I was reading all the other comments on here (man, there's a lot of them... what is it about The Who that inspires this intense degree of dedication?) and people just need to give the best bass player of all time awards and the Beatles comparisons a rest. I mean, the Beatles were definately pop and The Who are rock, so... whatever.\n\nI don't think I've ever met another girl who likes The Who, which made me suspicious to investigate them. I always percieved them as being incredibly macho, so I automatically assumed they sucked. Suffice it to say I was very wrong. But it was a tough road. My first exposure to them was watching Tommy when I was probably 10, and then watching Woodstock when I was maybe 12 (neither at my own choosing), and all I took away from those two experiences were combined memories of curly hair, fringe, the song 'See Me, Feel Me', and a profound fear of Oliver Reed. Probably six months ago I watched Rock and Roll circus, and, ignoring The Who's music in favour of Jagger, declared that the fringey lead singer was hot and that Pete Townsend was the ugliest man on earth, a declaration that probably had more than a little to do with the accent he adopts for the spoken part of 'A Quick One', which at the time reminded me a little too much of Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange.... Anyway, after that, I found a vinyl copy of The Kids Are Alright in the record cabinet, listened to it, heard 'See Me, Feel Me' again for the first time in 9 years and decided that I needed to buy a Who album with that song on it. I bought the new Ultimate Collection greatest hits, and was completely blown away by their diversity. I mean, the first CD starts with these cute, uptempo mod ditties, and then you get to the end of the CD and there's 'Baba O'Riley', and I couldn't even believe that it was the same group. It was kind of scary, actually. But it wasn't until I bought Tommy that I was really won over. And now I owe the credit card company 200 bucks for all the Who albums I've bought... A good chunk of that money going to the Deluxe Edition Live at Leeds. But it was worth it. They must have something because they've managed to expand the horizons of my recent David Bowie fanaticism (though I still prefer Bowie to The Who). And yeah, once I realized that Pete Townsend was a great songwriter with a beautiful voice, while Roger Daltrey is a creatively disabled prick, my assessments of their respective attractiveness was fully reversed (you can't fault a girl for her first impressions). But Daltrey does twirl a mean microphone. He should have just stuck to THAT, and not tried to ever write a song or embark on a solo/acting career. Some people just don't know when to stop, I suppose. But yeah. The Who. Macho, I suppose, but in a really good rock way rather than an annoying noise over talent way. And ABSOLUTELY the greatest live show ever. As if anyone doesn't already know that.\n\nJason Motell <JMOTELL@stny.rr.com> (30.04.2003)\n\nI've never really said this until today.never even thought it until right now, but the Who are overrated.\n\nIf you were to put any band in history (well.that I know of anyway) against the Who, member vs. member they really are individually an amazingly accomplished group. Townshend is one of the greatest songwriters ever, plays a mean guitar, and has an intriguing voice. Roger sings like a demon and plays a pretty good harmonica. Entwistle is the greatest bass player ever in rock, had a good voice, and wrote some pretty good songs himself and Moon was in the top 5 best drummers ever (at least). But all together, as a band, they just didn't make enough good songs IMO to be considered a 5. Their albums all have flaws. Every one of them has more than a little filler. I agree with most, that their best album is Live@ Leeds, which kind of proves that they really never made a perfect, or even near perfect studio album. I guess they weren't really a studio band, despite Townshend's best efforts on Tommy, Quad, and part's of Who's Next. Should they be revered by anyone interested in rock? Without question. Are they a great band? One of the best. Did they make great records? I would have to say no.\n\nCoops <C0ops@hotmail.com> (04.09.2003)\n\nI find it comical that the first reader comment on your review of Jon's solo project doesn't even know who John is. Yes In large McCartney was probably the best bassist to songwrite...that is totally different than the best bassist and Entwhistle would be that man. all you have to do is watch how fast his hands move and how rich the sound of his bass is. By the way Entwhistle revolutionized the way people play the instrument (with help from JPJ). Anyhow I wrote this in response to the first person to talk about your review and to back up your theory on who the best Musician was to play the bass.\n\n<DebNMarkW@aol.com> (15.10.2003)\n\nGeorge most certainly rates this band a lot higher than I would. Now don't get me wrong, while I like The Who very much, I just don't think they are as technically proficient as George makes them out to be. While Daltrey certainly is the best \"screamer\" in the business bar none, when he actually had to sing something even remotely close to being a ballad, he really struggled for the high notes. This is where Townsend's songwriting is fully appreciated as he wrote songs in the perfect keys for Roger's voice. When he couldn't alter the song's key, Pete just sang it himself. As great of a songwriter Pete was, he wasn't that much of a lead guitar player. He was a superb rhythm player who could bang out a few simple one note leads. Keith's drums were usually at the forefront anyway. Now for the big debate I've been reading about...George states that John Entwistle is the greatest bass player ever. Really? Ever? That's a mighty long time. In the world of rock I'd say him and McCartney are definitely at the top. While Entwistle was certainly faster than Paul, faster doesn't necessarily mean best, as Paul could come up with some beautiful runs on the bass. But if we're using the term ever here, then we have to be incorporating all styles of music. For example, Jaco Pastorious of Weather Report was probably the greatest bass player who ever lived. He also invented the fretless bass. No one is even fit to carry his jock strap. Not Entwistle, not anyone. Further mention must be given to Stanley Clarke as well. He played in Return To Forever and has been a successful solo artist. His album School Days is a bass clinic and many people consider him the best. In the world of funk, there's Bootsy Collins. He was a member of Parliament and laid down the groove on all of those funky tunes. A monster on the bass if there ever was one. Do you see my point here? This is a futile argument. Is Entwistle considered one of the greatest bass players ever? By all means yes. Is he the best of all time? No. Now back to The Who...I personally think you should have three Who albums in your collection, and by the way all have been given the Deluxe Edition treatment by their record company which now makes these essential purchases. Who's Next which I consider the best Who album ever. The version just released has a full disc of rarities. No it's not overrated. How can an album of songs being played in regulat rotation on radio and in commercials thirty years later be overrated? Silly talk. Live At Leeds, one of the best live albums of all time. I personally like The Allman's Live At Fillmore East and Little Feat's Waiting For Columbus much better, but this new deluxe edition now has the entire performance of Tommy. Go find it. It's worth it. Speaking of Tommy, that's the other one which is slated for the deluxe edition rarities version this month. I urge you to find these versions as they blow the other ones out of the water. I just didn't care that much for Quadrophenia in which case I consider Who's Next to be their last superb album. Moon would crash and burn some years later and The Who as we know them died with him. Townsend would ulimately run out of song ideas. But the three aforementioned releases are some of rock's greatest moments, and deserve to be in any fan's library.\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (28.08.2004)\n\nThe Who is the best band ever. And they get the gold. Everybody should have a band that he likes more than the Beatles. Heeeeee\n\nPete Townshend is the best songwriter ever. How can I prove it? Well, just listen to their (Who's) albums. As much as I respect John Lennon and Ray Davies, they couldn't come up with anything as perfect as Quadrophenia. And he is obviously one of the best guitarists in rock (and in all other genres of music as well). He is in my Top 5, actually. But maybe I'm just biased. And maybe I'm not. And I'm absolutely sure I'm not. Keith Moon is the best drummer ever (I'm ready to use the word 'ever' at least one more time). Speaking about his songwriting abilities, I would like to mention that I quite like 'I Need You'. John Entwistle is, yes, the best bass player ever. 'My Wife', 'Boris the Spider' and 'Cousin Kevin' are all classics. But he also wrote some really good material for Who Are You and Face Dances. Roger Daltrey has really amazing voice and he is my second favourite vocalist after Jim Morrison. And he also cowrote 'Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere' Once again, the best band ever. Ever.\n\nMatt(the great)Byrd <MatthewByrd@hotmail.com> (23.07.2005)\n\nYeah, the kids (me?) don't appreciate the Who too much. I haven't really listened to more than a few greatest hits collections and Tommy (which, addmittedly, I didn't like, I only listened to it ONCE!?) and Who's Next. But let's say this; I did once go through a HUGE Led Zeppelin phase, I never went through a Who phase, but I KNOW that a competition between an album with the best of the Who would demolish the Led Zeppelin counterpart. All Led Zeppelin's got is 'When The Levee Breaks' and 'Rock 'n' Roll', the only two songs in their catalogue that can REALLY match up with the Who's VERY best, I'm talkin' 'We Won't Get Fooled Again' and the 'I Can See For Miles' type stuff. the Who's got early R&B pop to psychedellia to acoustic pop to complete, over-the-top rock 'n' roll. Led Zeppelin has great riffs and good drumming, I can't EVER see that beating the complete package, this package includes songwriting and the dropping of the whole hippie-metal attitude.\n\nLionel Marechal <ryusenshi_2@yahoo.fr> (27.10.2005)\n\nGeorge, I really don't wanna lick your toes or anything, but... your reviewing style has even further improved since your comeback! I have rarely read anything in the WRC as interesting, as insightful, as the Who's new intro. \"I tip my hat to the new introduction\", as Pete could say.\n\nWell, after that, I have little to add, really. The Who are one of my favourite bands. They had, without a doubt, the best rhythm section in rock (at least the best of the \"so active they almost become lead players\" genre). They had a great singer plus two good ones. And, of course, a great songwriter. Plus, could you name another band who was an influence on punk (\"I Can't Explain\", \"My Generation\"), hard rock (Who's Next) and prog (Tommy and Quadrophenia)?! I feel, however, that the Who before Tommy were mainly a singles' band. It makes me lament the fact that the reissues don't have a coherent policy about singles' tracks (OK, having the B-sides for \"Pictures Of Lily\" and \"I'm A Boy\" as bonus tracks on A Quick One is cool, but why not put the A-sides too, dammit?? To force us to buy a compilation?) Couldn't they put everything as bonus tracks? (well, it would be hard, since all the Who's albums from 1967 to 1973 are either conceptual or live) Or make the equivalent of the Beatles' Past Masters (everything that's not on the albums, and only that)? By the way, I recommand the compilation called Rarities Vol I & II (too bad it's out of print) which has the B-sides to all the Who's singles and a few rare A-sides (including \"Relay\"). With this one and any good greatest hits compilation (such as My Generation - the very best of), you'll have the content of all the Who's non-album singles.\n\nTagbo Munonyedi <grimtraveller@hotmail.com> (22.12.2005)\n\nI vaguely remember the Who having a hit ('Squeeze box') when I was about 12 and the name \"Pete Townsend\" was one of those names that all the hip guys at school knew about in 1975........I was not hip.When I was really discovering the Stones in a big way 4 years later, I tried oh so hard to get into the Who and I just could not, surprizingly so, because at that point I adored \"My generation\" and also my head was opening to so many new bands and sounds. But not the Who. Over the next 17 years I read loads of their interviews and a couple of biographies and found them all to be fascinating people and finally I got into their music. It was the segment from \"Woodstock\" that did it, primarilly \"We're not going to take it\". I didn't know what it was called and I went around loads of 2nd hand record shops singing what I could remember of the melody, before discovering it was from \"Tommy. When I bought that, Meaty, Beaty.. and borrowed Live at Leeds and listened to a couple of bootlegs from '73 and a host of their singles, I marveled at what a fantastic all round band they were and I also marveled at how I had missed this back in 79/80. I mean, I was getting into Floyd, Zeppelin, Kansas, Purple, Sabbath, CCW, and a bucketload of bands that I still love hearing now.\n\nWithout a doubt the Who were one of the most original bands to emerge from that 60s explosion. If you listen to the words of some of the songs like \" I'm a boy\" or \"Fiddle about\", you can see that the 'Oo may have been macho roughnecks from Acton (well Roger was ), but they were dealing in themes that people just didn't speak about in those less open days. Pretty revolutionary stuff, if you ask me. And while it is a justifiable point that they lacked even a George Harrison to counterbalance Pete's, in the main, excellent writing, I think John Entwistle was pretty ahead of his time as a writer, in terms of his humour and what he was actually writing about ( spiders, child abuse etc). Musically, the Who were a strange band, live they were a loud powerhouse and in the studio, they could be that but they were also a clever outfit, making the most of the least. And while I do think that arguments about who was and wasn't the best are pretty moot, John Entwistle [with \"My generation\"] must at least take credit for actually getting the bass guitar heard properly in rock/ pop. Some of the soul bassmen were doing it but the Ox really elevated it. I think he unwittingly hinted to Jack Bruce how the bass could perfom 3 functions at once[ rhythm, foundation & melody].As for Moonie as the drummer, I think he was a total one off. I cannot think of another band for whom he could have played......but let's not take the approach that he couldn't play, no no no! I watched a \"Classic albums\" programme earlier this year and they were going through Who's next and the engineer on that album (or was it the producer ?) Andy Johns played sections of each song without various other instruments or vocals and Moon's drumming was a unique, TIMEKEEPING feature. I'm not knowledgeable about the post Moon period, but let me say, the Who, on their '65 - '76 showing alone are more than worthy of their place in the halls of innovation and great music. Tommy, can you hear me ??\n\nAdam Kavulic <kavulic@zoominternet.net> (19.12.2005)\n\nI have friends that don't like to listen to rock music that contains more then 4 instruments (i.e. vocals, bass, guitar, and drums). And I know for a fact those same friends would vomit if a \"rock\" band used synthesizers in any way shape or form. Rock is suppose to be those 4 instruments right? How can you be angry with studio produced albums? How can you be a punk when you have a piano introduction to a song called \"Love Reign O'er Me\"? Also, how can anyone, anything, be better then The Beatles? Hell, didn't The Beatles say they were better then God? ;^) Huh?\n\nI will tell anyone The Who is the best rock 'n' roll band ever. You can't dispute that! I'm not saying they are the greatest thing to happen to music, but I am saying that for rock music. Beatles purist will argue The Beatles are the best rock band, and I will slap them in their face. I'll even say The Beatles are a better band then The Who. I mean, The Beatles quite literally changed the way we listen to music. However, The Beatles knelt down when The Who passed with their \"Maximum R & B\". They were the first band to do so many things and they pioneered so many others. I can't tell anymore if it's just the love I have for him that changed my opinion to \"fact\" but Pete Townshend is the greatest lyricist in music. (Don't tell any Beatle nuts but I think he wrote better stuff then John and Paul combined). What The Beatles did for music originally, Pete tried to take that to the next level with his Lifehouse. The Beatles say, \"We are better then God,\" where Pete says, \"We are gods, and you can be one too, through music.\" Also their talents. Unreal! You may say that John isn't the best bassist, Keith the best drummer, Pete the best guitarist or lyricist, and Roger the best singer. But doesn't it count for something that you can make the claim \"they are the best\" and back it up?! Even the sheer ability to justify these claims with more then saying, \"Because they are the best!\"... means everything. You can listen, learn, and understand what they did and say they are the best because A,B, and C. Beyond any feelings or emotions... facts are facts... and a claim backed up with facts solidifies its validity. The Who, even with production at it's peak, managed to spit in your face! They can somehow through violins, cellos, and a synthesizer show you what rock is all about! How wrong is that?! I mean a string arrangement justifying a punk mentality! Listen to \"Martha My Dear,\" back to back with \"Love Reign O'er Me\" and tell me which song rocked more. For me, all things standing in the way of The Who's title for rock's king was settled when I saw them in Hershey, Pennsylvania in 2002. I was not in the front row but the story goes that Pete sort of missed the opening notes to \"I Can't Explain\" and a few people in the front row chuckled. I missed that but I didn't miss what Pete said into his microphone to 25,000+ people, Pete screamed, \"F*** off! All of you!\" What was our response?! We screamed right back as if we won the lottery! What would happen at a Paul McCartney show if Sir Paul opened up \"Hey Jude\" with a muffled piano chord and a middle finger to the audience?! I will tell you that it wouldn't be screams of approval from his fans! From an asshole at heart to anyone disputing The Who as the king of rock, \"F*** off! All of you!\"\n\nAdrovane Kade <adrovane@gmail.com> (02.02.2006)\n\nHi, George.\n\nCongratulations for your huge database of album reviews. Although I disagree with some of your analysis (ABBA, for example), I understand that their are guided for your own taste, and respect that. And the opportunity of sharing our own ideas in the 'comments' section is great. I would like here to make some comments about The Who. I really never enjoyed The Who very much, but after reading your reviews I decided to give them a new try. I only comment the Who's music, because I couldn' evaluate the impact of the band in 1960's scene. First, my feelings about the musicians. I think they are (were?) really good, specially the rhythm section. I'm not going to discuss any of \"he's the best of all time\" and such a crap comments that are, after all, pointless and useless. Every one of us has a \"best of all time\" list, and discussing this becomes a religious kind of discussion. What matters in this case is that the rhythm section of The Who was just great. Keith Moon and John Entwhistle made a perfect drums-bass combination, that worked out really good in the band. They were solid and had a great level of communication, as can be heard in Live at Leeds, specially. Roger Daltrey, on the other hand, doesn't have a great voice, but is not unpleasant at all. I totally agree with some comments that say that he was not a great singer. And this is visible in ballads, like \"Behind Blue Eyes\". But he was a great screamer, indeed. And, as so many bands in the rock history discovered, if you can't sing, at least scream loud and clear. Pete Townshend always was an enigma for me. He's worshiped as one of the greatest guitarists in the world. But I never was capable of giving him all this credit. How could you compare Townshend with the other great guitar players of his time, like Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Ritchie Blackmore or Eric Clapton? You obviously can't! He's not gifted enough! He's a good rhythm guitarist, yes, but there was others at that time that was too good, like Roger McGuinn, for example. And John Lennon, of course. And these guys never had the same level of worshipment (in Lennon's case, I'm considering his guitar playing only, of course). But there are so many people that consider Pete Townshend such a guitar hero, that I think the problem is with me! Because I think he's the most overrated guitar player in history! Oh, sure, this guy has the credit of being the first one to break instruments on the stage, so... no, I don't think that it is just this. I must be missing something here. So, the musicians were good. And what about the songwriting? That is, for me, the weakest point of The Who. After all, what really matters is what we the pathetic mainstream worms call S-O-N-G. Right, George? I would like to propose a comparison between the songwriting from The Who and the other bands you gave an A grade: The Beatles, Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones. How can we compare The Who with these bands in terms of songwriting? Well, we can't! It's obvious to anyone that The Who's songwriting is poorer than that of anyone of these three others. And it is also worse than other bands of their time, like The Kinks, for example. One evidence can be found in the original Live at Leeds album: six songs, three covers! That makes clear that, at that time, not even the band/managers/producers were pleased with their own material. Considering individual songs, what is the best known The Who's song? It is surely 'My G-G-G-Generation'. And what there is in this song that can be called original? Absolutely nothing. A Bo Didley-sucked melody (repeated in Magic Bus - you can't be creative all time, right George?), Beatles-sucked backing vocals, a fair instrumentation, and nothing more. Oh, there is, of course, the Daltrey's stuttering singing, which is fun in the first listening, but becomes annoying as time passes. There are some better songs, like \"Behind Blue Eyes\" (my personal favourite), \"Who are you?\", \"Won't get fooled again\" (both brought to 21st century by CSI TV series), \"Substitute\", \"I can see for miles\", \"See me feel me\" and \"Pinball wizard\" (eight-year-old-school-boy lyrics, however). But there is some crappy songs, too. \"Boris the spider\", for example: good basslines, but stupid lyrics and ridiculous singing. One of the crappiest \"rock\" songs I ever listened to, by the way. So, what remais for me from The Who is that is necessary more than good musicians to make a great rock band. It needs great songs in great albums. And, except maybe for Quadrophenia, The Who albums are not so great. They can't be compared to Beatles', Dylan's and Stones' at their best. And even Kink's \"Arthur\" is at least at the same level. In conclusion, I think your review of The Who suffered a huge influence of the fact that you are a great fan of the band. The paragraph that talks about the role played by each one of the musicians (\"Pete the songwriting philosopher, Roger the heavy-fisted rebel, John the technical-minded scepticist, and Keith the schizophrenic surfer\") is a typical example of fan's talk. There is nothing wrong about that, of course. If I was the one making the reviews, I would put Led Zeppelin in the A class. But, please, take that disclaimer out of the page. It really doesn't make any sense there. ALBUMS THE WHO SINGS MY GENERATION\n\nJeff Blehar <jdb3@jhu.edu> (15.02.2000)\n\nThe Who Sings My Generation? \"Screams\" is more like it. Everybody falls over themselves to call this a \"powerful\" and \"stunning\" debut, but I just ain't buying it, and I *love* these guys to death. It's suprisingly weak, especially when you consider that the three singles which had immediately preceded it - \"I Can't Explain,\" \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,\" and of course \"My Generation\" - are all rock classics. Instead of 12 tracks of pulse-pounding British rock on the level of those songs we instead get a mix of tepid R&B covers, some banal originals and of course a few splendid originals which give this album a reputation that I don't think it quite deserves.\n\nFirst of all, \"My Generation\" is the best song on here, so there's no point in commenting on it, except to say that I am amazed, AMAZED I tell you, at how incredibly dirty and nasty and raw this track still sounds. I mean, shit, this sounds like it could've been recorded by a thrash-punk band last year! Except it was made in 1965! Those four guys really knew how to wring the most out of their instruments (Daltrey and his voice included). As for the other real highlights, they go by the names of \"The Kids Are Alright,\" \"A Legal Matter,\" and \"The Ox.\" \"Kids\" is haunting, Beatley, and anthemic, but I'm royally pissed about the edited version on this CD. As of now, the only place to get the full length version is on Thirty Years Of Maximum R&B (which I like a lot, even if I agree with George that it's largely unnecessary with the new reissues...but where else are you gonna get to hear \"Dogs?\"). \"A Legal Matter\" has always struck me as more \"cute\" than \"classic,\" but I was listening to \"The Ox\" again today (by the way George, the song WAS named after Entwistle, not the other way around) and, like \"My Generation,\" I was just blown away with how it sounds to modern ears; that is, it's still compelling as hell. I swear Townshend does things with his guitar on that track that STILL haven't been repeated in a studio. Unfortunately (and this is a big \"unfortunately\"), the rest of the album, all 8 tracks of it, is simply mediocre. The R&B covers just sound *wrong*, the way a that a death-metal band trying to play new-age sounds wrong, while some pleasantly mediocre Towser tunes like \"La La Lies\" and \"Much Too Much\" just serve as filler to be waded through on the way to \"My Generation.\" And please, for the love of everything that is good and holy, will somebody shoot Shel Talmy? We NEED this album remastered, especially because there'd be a ton of neato bonus tracks from this era to slap on to a reissue. Anyway, it's got those four greats, but everything else it dispensable, and since you can find those elsewhere (like Meaty, Beaty, Big And Bouncy) I'd only give this a 5/10.\n\nBob Josef <Trfesok@aol.com> (24.06.2000)\n\nIn the wake of the Beatles Invasion, a lot of groups were recorded extremely quickly and ineptly in order to cash in on what was thought to be another passing pop fad. Unfortunately, none of the producers had even an ounce of George Martin's savvy. And no one , not even the Stones, suffered more at the hands of a hack producer than the Who. Talmy was SUCH an incompetent -- the Who was one band who sounded far better live at this stage, and only on the \"Anyhow, Anywhere, Anyway\" single did he attempt to bring any of the power of the band to the studio. I bemoan what \"The Ox,\" in particular, could have sounded like if anyone else was running the tape machines. Even if the album is remastered, it won't help much. And I do agree that Daltrey wasn't much of a vocalist at this point, sounding like a ragged, less tuneful John Lennon.\n\nBut, despite this, the classics here are undeniable. Entwhistle redefined bass guitar on the \"My Generation\" single, becoming the forefather of such bassists and Chris Squire (Squire more than freely admits that) and Jon Camp. \"A Legal Matter\" has a rather daring theme for a 1965 song -- a guy running away from his pregnant girlfriend who wants to get married? Not even Mick Jagger dared something like that at this time. I think the recording quality prevents this album from being an all time classic, unfortunately.\n\nDavid Lyons <d.t.lyons@btinternet.com> (10.12.2000)\n\nCan I volunteer to shoot Shel Talmy on behalf of Jeff Blehar? The man has a lot to answer for (hopefully the ricochet would hit Glyn Johns in the bit of him that tried to stop Keith Moon drumming like Keith Moon).\n\nJeff Melchior <Jeffmoncheri@aol.com> (22.12.2000)\n\nAt a time when most bands (except for maybe The Beatles and The Stones) were still in the habit of releasing a few good songs as singles and padding their albums with filler, The Who did something incredibly unique: release an album of predominantly good work, with most of it written by themselves. Even The Who's much-vilified approach to R and B is here in fine form. Everyone complains about Shel Talmy's production, but to my ears this is an excellently-produced record - a rich, full mix that was ahead of its time. Only songs I don't care for are 'Out In The Street' and 'Please Please Me', and even that's growing on me. As far as I'm concerned, the record would be worth the cost of admission if all it had was 'The Ox' and, of course, the timeless title track.\n\n<Ogdensgoneflake@aol.com> (23.12.2000)\n\nJohn had had the name The Ox long before the song was writ. I just want to say this album rocks and I look forward to the reissue (which is do out?). This time I think Shel's murky production works for the best.\n\nPalash Ghosh <palash7@hotmail.com> (16.02.2001)\n\nBefore people start criticizing The Who Sings My Generation, they should realize that The Who at this time were four very young, very raw kids with little else but boundless energy, rage and rough talent. It was a totally different world in 1965 - a group of kids this unschooled could never get a recording contract these days, the market is over-saturated. But London in the mid-sixties was really just the germination of the great English pop/rock movement - and labels were willing to give scruffy kids like Pete, Roger, John and Keith a chance. And so, this album is very unrefined, very naked, very unfinished -- and that's precisely why I've come to like it. Yes, the production is substandard, yes Pete's songwriting skills had yet to flower, and yes, Roger's voice was undeveloped - but how sophisticated were YOU when you were 18 or 19?\n\nThe truly amazing thing about this record is that Keith and John had already established themselves as musicians!! 'The ox' is very nasty, even a bit avant-garde (did people dance to this track? Or did they just sit there with their mouths agape in wonder?). Other great tunes are 'The kids are alright,' 'The good's gone' and of course, that awesome unforgettable title track. I actually don't think Roger's James Brown imitations are THAT bad, at least he gives an enthusiastic performance. Another thing, The Who shouldn't really ever be compared to The Beatles or The Stones. The Who were younger than these other groups, thus they were not really their 'peers' (their evolution was not parallel). Keep in mind, that The Who really couldn't reign supreme until the Fab Four started to wind down.\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (22.09.2001)\n\nso what do i do every moning? i wake up p-p-p-put breakfast in m-m-m-m-my hhhead and g-g-go outside to talk with my buddies then we together fiddle about the streets and t-t-talk loud about our probleb..problet... pro-blme-ms. you are not one of us, starostin, whatever your first name is, so who gave you the right to put down this most original and the b-b-b-best record ever made? what is your moto? 'i have ears of tin so call me starostin?' unlike you good Pete decided to t-t-t-tel the truth to the wh-h-h-h-hole world about his g-g-generation. the good's gone is absolute maste...monster.... ah, i mean it's good. and kids are alright is good, too. you maybe scratch your assssss but legal mater is also good. and now bite your dick c-c-c-coz ox is g-g-good, too. it's a good album. best in the hole music. and you may bite your c-c-c-cock again s-s-since you gave it only 8/15.\n\nPS. Seriously now. I almost completely agree with you on this point. But proto punk? Well, maybe, but I think Pete didn't know what we would call this 30 years later.\n\nRatko Hribar <stormbringer@email.hinet.hr> (06.10.2001)\n\nHey, hey, I've got this thingy on a cassette (like many other albums), and I don't plan to buy it on CD anytime soon. Why should I buy something that has a poor sound quality, and it's also too short ? I'll rather wait them to remaster it. And if they don't, than I wont buy it EVER. Well now, this is certainly one of the best played and structured debut albums in the history of rock 'n' roll (this one beats the hell out of Led Zeppelin I). The guys are great songwriters and arrangers, and they play very convincing, technically speaking. Lot's of energy more than makes up for some minor problems (like Daltrey's vocals). A choice of good and outstanding tracks is not at all limited, so one can choose between the punk anthem 'My Generation' (my own favorite), 'The Kids Are Alright' (awesome, and not dated at all), 'A Legal Matter' (gorgeously catchy with some exceptional singing by Townshend). Some people have a problem with Daltrey's vocals on this album, and I can see their point, but we have to remember that they we're very young at the time (he still manages to outsing the likes of Plant, Osbourne and, especially, Coverdale). Besides those tracks, the rest is also recommendable, but somewhat inconsistent. 'The Ox' and 'The Good's Gone' are noticeably better than, say, 'Please Please Please'. Anyway, I would rather forget about the covers. Not that they're bad, but they're just not as solid. I admit that this maybe isn't the material that deserves a 9, but it seems appropriate enough for me.\n\nEric Benac <benac@voyager.net> (23.05.2002)\n\nthe debut album by my favorite band. townshend blazes throughout, and his song writing ability is insanely great even at this early point. of course, they pad the album with covers, a bit, but it's only two!!! in fact, pete was so creative he rairly had to use covers again, and when he did he wrote them into the context of the album. far better than please please me by the beatles, in fact, i'd say pete was a stronger song writer than any of the beatles were at this point. sure, the album suffers because of the abysmal production but each song is a gem (except for the covers with roger over singing) and shows a remarkable amount of range and diversity already. well, not remarkable i suppose, but listen to \"my generation\" and \"a legal matter\" and tell me that's not range? i'd give it a nine out of ten.\n\nZach Smith <spotsgoil88@yahoo.com> (16.07.2002)\n\nHey, I think TWSMG is very strong, and is probably the most under-ambitious the who ever got. I mean, except for live albums, this is the only straight forward album in their discography.\n\nNow for the music... 'Out in the street'... cool beginning, not as good as ever thing else 'I don't mind' is a ok cover, while 'the good's gone' has a great gutair solo. 'La-la lies' is underrated to the extreme, as is 'much too much' and 'its not true'. I've never liked 'a legal matter' that much. 'Circles' is good, 'ox' is kick ass, and 'please please please' sucks ass. I give it a 7 out of 10. Wait... u say there are two other songs on the album? That's right!!! 'My generation' is their best song ever, well best of their 60's songs anyway. And 'TKAA' kicks serious ass as well. I don't mind when a guy's dancing with my girl.....\n\nThomas Vaughan Kent <thomas.kent@student.adelaide.edu.au> (04.12.2002)\n\nHi George!\n\nI don't care what anyone says, 'The Kids are Alright' is a blatant rip off of 'All My Loving'.\n\nLloyd Peppard <peppardl@post.queensu.ca> (26.05.2003)\n\nHoly Shit! As if someone actually wrote that they've never met a girl who likes The Who! That makes me so happy. Well, here's one, despite my Dad's email address that always appears when I post reviews. I LOVE The Who, and I love this album. I bought a used vinyl reissue because I only had about 5 bucks to my name at the time (now I have none), but it was worth every penny. I don't necessarily think of it as being very bombastic, though. I mean, it definately has a hard edge to it, but there's nothing particularily off-putting about it. The Stooges are off-putting. This sounds pretty cute and tame compared with that.\n\nI actually LIKE the 'I Don't Mind' cover, because Daltrey sounds like such a snot-nosed British youth, I find it funny. I really like 'Out in the Street', too. It's super catchy, and a great way to open the album. I disagree about Dalrey's singing being especially bad, though. I much prefer his singing here to what he comes up with for Sell Out. Although I agree he became much improved as the years passed. I only mentioned it because I put off buying this album due to your comments about his voice, which I felt were overstated, in retrospect. Any similarities The Who might ever draw to The Beatles, their debut a,bum sets the two groups at opposite ends of the spectrum. I suppose I'm atypical (as a girl) in this respect, but I could never get into the Beatles because it was just too clean, too happy, too catchy. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The Beatles are pop and The Who are rock. And to say that most girls don't like The Who because they're \"ugly\" is nothing more than a sad commentary on the fact that the majority of girls have no musical taste whatsoever. Since I'm a girl I guess that comment gets expemt from being attacked as sexism.\n\nMaréchal Lionel <ryusenshi_2@yahoo.fr> (11.04.2004)\n\nI've bought the new version of My Generation - they finally decided to remaster it and add bonus tracks on it ! Actually, it's a \"Deluxe Version\" with a second disc of various bonuses. Here's the tracklisting:\n\nFirst disc : 1) Out In The Street 2) I Don't Mind 3) The Good's Gone 4) La La La Lies 5) Much Too Much 6) My Generation 7) The Kids Are Alright 8) Please Please Please 9) It's Not True 10) I'm A Man (from the English album) 11) The Ox 12) A Legal Matter 13) Circles (from the American album) Bonus Tracks : 14) I Can't Explain (first single) 15) Bald Headed Woman (B-side of I Can't Explain) 16) Daddy Rolling Stone Second Disc : 1) Leaving Here 2) Lubie (Come Back Home) (the original was \"Louie Go Home\") 3) Shout And Shimmy 4) (Love Is Like A) Heat Wave 5)Motoring 6) Anytime You Want Me 7) Anyway Anyhow Anywhere (alternate version) 8) Instant Party Mixture 9) I Don't Mind (full length version) 10) The Good's Gone (full length version) 11) My Generation (instrumental version) 12) Anytime You Want Me (a capella version) 13) A Legal Matter (monaural version with guitar overdubs) 14) My Generation (single version : monaural version with guitar overdubs) As I don't know the original CD, I can't tell if the remaster has a better sound. All I can say is that the sound is loud and clear. As for the songs themselves, well... the original album is good, for sure, especially for a first album and for the year 1965 : it beats The Rolling Stones by a short advance, especially on songwriting, and blows Please Please Me away. Some songs aren't that good (the two James Brown covers are atrocious) and the album globally lacks some experience, but there's a kind of youthful excitement, of innocence, that redeems it (and of course the title track is an absolute classic). Good garage/rhythm&blues stuff : 8(13) on George's scale. As for \"I'm A Man\", well, you know the song, and Daltrey sounds quite bad on it (don't try to copycat the old bluesmen !). Now what about the bonus tracks ? \"I Can't Explain\" is a worthy addition, of course (you know it, so I won't describe it ; still, few bands had their first single that good) ; \"Bald Headed Woman\" was written by Shel Talmy (the same song is on the Kink's debut album, but the Who play it better. And guess who's on rhythm guitar ? the unknown Johnny Sheet who later formed Steel Blimb). \"Daddy Rolling Stone\" is another covered-to-the-point-of-suffocation song, not really interesting. The second disc is mainly made of covers (apart from \"Anyway Anyhow Anywhere\" and \"Instant Party Mixture\" , and the songs that are also on the album\"), and they are really hit-and-miss. \"Heat Wave\" and \"Motoring\" are the best of the lot, while \"Shout And Shimmy\" (another James Brown cover) is as bad as \"Please Please Please\" and \"I Don't Mind\". \"Instant Party Mixture\" is a funny original, with doo-wop-like vocals (\"choo-be-doo-be-doo\"...), the first appearance of John's \"boss voice\" and (surprise, s! urprise) the riff of \"Johnny B. Goode\" inserted for no reason. \"Anyway Anyhow Anywhere\" is a very good one, too, but I wonder why they put in an alternate version instead of the superior regular one. The so-called \"long versions\" are, frankly speaking, a swindle : \"I Don't Mind\" adds one verse, and \"The Good's Gone\" merely fades out 20 seconds later ; an instrumental vesion of \"My Generation\" was completely unuseful (it's not even an alternate take !), so is the a capella \"Anytime You Want Me\". The single version of \"My Generation\" adds some lead guitar parts, and (in my opinion) is slighly better than the album one, but \"A Legal Matter\" is identical to the album version. Overall, some of the bonuses are worthy, but some others aren't. The worst thing is that the running time of the 2 discs is only 90 minutes, which means that by cutting off the stupid long and a capella versions everything could have been on one CD. I also wonder why they didn't add the superb \"Substitute\", whereas they did add its B-side \"Instant Party Mixture\". Still, the liner notes are quite informative. According to them, the album's first recording session produced 11 tracks, only 1 of them being an original (\"You're Going To Know Me\", later renamed \"Out In The Street\") ; but the reviews of the demos were bad, so manager Kit Lambert encouraged Pete to write more original songs, and Pete eventually came up with enough originals to fill the album. A funny thing, \"My Generation\" was originally written as a slow blues, and was LATER rearranged as the \"proto-punk\" anthem we know (by the way, apart from \"My Generation\", no song here sounds like proto-punk, George, what were you thinking?). So \"My Generation Blues\" is not a new version, but the original one!\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (29.08.2004)\n\nThe best debut I could ever expect from the band. In fact, I consider it one of the strongest debut records ever together with Velvet Underground & Nico, The Doors, Led Zeppelin and a few others.\n\nI dont understand it how some people (including you, George) can rate this album the same as the Stones debut. IMO, My Generation is much better. And only 2 covers! Much Too Much, The Kids Are Alright, My Generation (I can carry on) are undeniable classics. Could Jagger and Richards come up with such incredible songs in their early years? I mean, with such amount of incredible songs. Of course, no. Two Brown covers are decent, IMO. The rest are catchy and aggressive tunes. A very important release. It gets a 14. Really.\n\nDane J. Hitt <dane.j.hitt@gmail.com> (16.09.2005)\n\nGeorge asks, \"Is the double-disc remaster worth your time?\" Let's examine:\n\nDisc One - The Original Album 1) \"My Generation\" and \"The Kids Are Alright\" are both the original versions, or alternate, or whatever. Both use less vocal overdubbing (I at first did not like this, but later it grew on me), but the old \"My Generation\" is on the second disc. \"TKAA\" features the infamous Moon solo in its entirity, a big plus for me. As for the rest of the songs, I can't attest to any changes from the original album, as I've never had the chance to hear the original. 2) \"I'm a Man\" is included, but it doesn't really enthrall me. Perhaps others would like it more. I consider it a waste. 3) The single version of \"I Can't Explain\" is included as a bonus track, much to my delight. The other bonus tracks are \"Daddy Rolling Stone\" and \"Bald Headed Woman,\" the latter of which features Jimmy Page, but neither of the two songs are all that interesting. Disc Two - The Extras 1) The first few tracks are R&B covers, and almost any of them would've been suitable replacements for the James Brown covers. \"Leaving Here\" (I love this one, better than the BBC version), \"Lubie (Come Back Home)\" (it's alright, I guess), \"Heatwave\" (different version from A Quick One, it's good), \"Motoring\" (it's alright), and my personal favorite, \"Anytime You Want Me.\" 2) Plenty of alternate versions of old songs, and a few surprises. \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" with an alternate chorus, and an unreleased track called \"Instant Party Mixture,\" not to be confused with \"Instant Party (Circles).\" The former is actually about partying, makes several allusions to drug use, and features tradeoff vocals from all members of the group. It's a fun gag number, I like it. After that are full length versions of \"I Don't Mind\" (certainly we could use more of THAT one), \"The Good's Gone,\" mono guitar overdubbed versions of \"A Legal Matter\" and \"My Generation\" (I believe this version of \"MG\" is the same as the one on the original album), an a capella (read: backing track suppressed, the vocals are identical to those on the instrumental track) version of \"Anytime You Want Me,\" and an instrumental version of \"My Generation.\" It's an odd mix, but if nothing else, the handful of good R&B covers + extended Moon solo version of \"TKAA\" makes the batch worthwhile, but I recommend it only for Who fans...that is, the ones that'd take interest in more of the second disc material. The extras on the first disc are mostly throwaways. Also, if it makes a difference, the album cover looks different for the deluxe edition. It just says \"My Generation.\" I'm guessing this was the original UK cover. I could be completely wrong. A QUICK ONE\n\nJeff Blehar <jdb3@jhu.edu> (15.02.2000)\n\nWell...at least it SOUNDS better! But A Quick One is actually even more disturbingly unfocused than My Generation, with a remarkable amount of filler (at least it's original filler, though). Still, for some reason (and now with the bonus tracks, even better reason), I'd rate this higher than the debut. I don't know exactly why, but I think it's the spirit of the LP: this is THE definitive \"Swinging London\" mod/pop album, and for better or worse, it really conjures images of its time.\n\nAbout the songwriting deal, I have to say that while I agree that Roger's \"See My Way\" is a rotten sardine (but his \"Early Morning Cold Taxi\" ain't!), I dig Moon's \"I Need You\" and \"Cobwebs And Strange\" for the Swinging London atmosphere described above. John's two are excellent, of course; I really don't think \"Whiskey Man\" gets the credit it deserves from fans. And sadly, Townshend only came up with two good songs this time around, one of which wouldn't really BECOME good until it was taken on the road. \"So Sad About Us\" just flat-out rocks, like a more melodic \"My Generation\" with a bunch of \"la la\"s and one daftly perfect line in \"you can't turn off my loving like you can't turn off the sun!\" \"A Quick One, While He's Away\" has a lot of potential that goes unfulfilled here - the opening and closing sections (\"Her Man's Been Gone\" and \"You Are Forgiven\"), which were the standout parts of the song when played live, are flaccid, flaccid, flaccid. The best version around is probably the one from the Thirty Years Of Maximum R&B set which grafts the opening and closing sections of the Rock And Roll Circus version (a different, and quite frankly VERY superior, take than the other two released on The Kids Are Alright soundtrack and the Rock And Roll Circus video, respectively. The Who did three performances of the song that night, and this one is the best of them) onto the body of the studio version. But if you don't want to plunk down $55 for the set (and who would?) go get Live At Leeds, which has the next best attack on it. Anyway, so the album itself is weak, but the bonus tracks are all nifty fifties by me: the Ready Steady Who! EP is lightweight fun (with the exception of the notably heavy \"Disguises\") while Entwistle's B-sides are ALL little bundles of joy. And unlike Georgie, I really like the acoustic version of \"Happy Jack.\" Doesn't last too long for me. My only complaint is that they could have thrown on more tracks here (the CD only runs something like 55 minutes) like \"The Last Time,\" \"Under My Thumb,\" \"Substitute,\" \"Instant Party,\" and other rarities, and thus made more room for later B-sides on the Odds And Sods reissue. That way we would have been able to have ALL of The Who's music on reissued CD. Instead, they were either sloppy or cheap. Take your pick. I'll give this a 6/10 (11/15) with bonus tracks, take TWO points away for a copy without them.\n\nPhilip Maddox <slurmsmckenzie@hotmail.com> (28.07.2000)\n\nThis one's kinda hard for me to rate, because I really do enjoy listening to the whole thing, but not a lot of the songs are great. John's two are REALLY great. 'Boris The Spider' is an acknowledged classic, but the insane 'Whiskey Man' should be, too - I love the lyrics about how there wasn't room for Whiskey Man at the mental hospital. Hilarious and catchy. Plus, I really love the opening 'Run Run Run', which is a really catchy, fast, groovy rocker. The rest all kind of depends on my mood. The title track is catchy, but some of those harmnonies don't quite work. It was much better on stage. Still, it's hard to beat that 'You Are Forgiven' section at the end - one of the best moments the Who ever did. Roger's song sucks, of course. Keith's two are fun, but not really great - the drums came in so loud on 'I Need You' that it made me jump! Plus, I've never been too crazy about the remaining two Pete songs - they're decent, but nothing special. I like the bonus tracks - goofy surf music played by the Who! Swell. The Entwistle songs here are cool, as is 'Disguises'. I'd have to give this album something like a high 6, maybe a low 7 on a really good day.\n\nBob Josef <Trfesok@aol.com> (14.08.2000)\n\nWell, mad experimentation was in the air in 1996. And it's obvious with it's multiple songwriting and attempts at varied styles, Lambert and the Who were trying to create their version of Revolver.\n\nBut Lambert ain't no George Martin, that's for sure. Even thinner production than Shel Talmy. The early 60's tinniness of Pete's guitar, in particular, continues to annoy. The rhythm section is actually far clearer in the murky mix than the guitars. The CD remastering and remixing doesn't rescue the record. The other reason is that Townshend and Entwistle (never mind Daltrey and Moon) aren't exactly Lennon and McCartney in the songwriting deparment. Pete actually, except for \"A Quick One,\" takes a major (although temporary) dive in writing with this collection of wimpy pop songs, albeit dressed up in the band's instrumental attack. I actually prefer Pete's touching little acoustic demo of \"So Sad About Us\" (available on Scoop) to the rather ordinary Beatlesque rocker here. He does get an A for effort for the title track. I think it's overstating it quite a bit to call a 9 minute track a \"rock opera.\" Rather, Pete does here what the Beatles would do with the medley of Abbey Road -- attempt to weld several song fragments into a cohesive whole. It's very tentative, though -- the different pieces seem to fit rather awkwardly, at best, here. The live version is where the piece really becomes seamless. And I love where the band totally trashes the beloved English hymn \"Land of Hope and Glory\" at the coda of \"My Generation\" -- this would have generated as much controversy in the UK as Hendrix's version of the American national anthem did in the U.S., if it had been released. The covers, like most of the covers from this period, are lame, especially \"Heatwave\". Forget it!! \"Cobwebs and Strange\" is a fun bit of craziness, like \"Yellow Submarine\" gone even more demented, but \"I Need You\" does not make me want to rush out and buy Two Sides of the Moon. Roger's contribution is not worse than most of Pete's -- but that's not saying much at all. But I love John's contributions. Let's see -- an arachnophobe, a hallucinating alcoholic, a hypochondriac, a framed prisoner -- did John know any NORMAL people at this point? But his bass really carries the melodies here! Lastly, the vocals. Major disagreement here. Roger's voice is slightly improved, but far from what it would yet become. But they had not yet developed a good approach to vocal harmonies. There's TOO MUCH FALSETTO -- from all FOUR band members -- everywhere!! Someone should have told them the Beach Boys sang in OTHER vocal ranges, too. All these squeaky voices!! Drives me nuts. This didn't last, thank the Good Lord.\n\n<WhoJonGalt@aol.com> (15.09.2000)\n\nA historic album as the great one first dabbles in the Rock Opera mode. If you buy the CD it has some dynamite bonus tracks. You can keep the Motown covers, but maybe that is because here in Cleveland, the local Oldies Station drills that stuff into the ground. However it is a very good example of non-mainstream early British rock, which is truly the best music in the world!\n\nFredrik Tydal <f_tydal@hotmail.com> (03.12.2000)\n\nHow come no one's mentioned the awesome \"In The City\" on the re-issue? I'm serious; it's a complete master-piece. I mean, it sounds exactly like a, say, 1964 hit for the Beach Boys or Jan & Dean. I really admire Entwistle's ability to go into the studio and just pin down an exact surf hit replica like that. While Moon is credited on the track as well, it surely is Entwistle who is mainly responsible for the song. It's just like an early to mid Sixties surf song you've heard played to death on your local oldies station all your life. That melody really *sticks* in your head; quite infectious indeed. And couldn't that Entwistle play a mean French horn? The re-issue if just great, even if more tracks could have been included. Am I the only one who thinks that Entwistle's \"Doctor, Doctor\" is very reminiscent of \"Mother's Little Helper\"? Something about the bass lines, the dark nature of the songs and their medical themes. And there's \"Bucket T\" as well! It was released as a single here in Sweden back in '66 and shot directly to number one on the charts, the only one of the The Who's efforts to do so here. So, rather amusingly, \"Bucket T\" is the second most famous Who song here, only after \"My Generation\". Rather obscure Jan & Dean song; it was probably Keith's decision to cover it and he does a great job on the lead vocals. And \"Barbara Ann\" just *rocks* - better than both the Regents' original and the Beach Boys' party cover. And how funny isn't their hilariously disrespectful take on \"Land Of Hope And Glory\"? (Am I mistaken, or isn't the real title of that song \"Pomp And Circumstance?) As it is now, the bonus tracks on the re-issue more or less overshadow the actual album. Sure, there's the title track but that one's much, much better live. Keith's two songs are both cool novelties, both with impressive drumming (almost ear-hurting in \"I Need You\"). I never really was a fan of \"Boris The Spider\" - it's not bad or anything, but hardly Entwistle's best song. A five to the original, but a generous seven to the re-issue.\n\nDavid Lyons <d.t.lyons@btinternet.com> (10.12.2000)\n\nQuick notes to agree with Mr. Blehar in support of Rog's second effort 'Early Morning Cold Taxi' and to point out that the song is indeed 'Land Of Hope And Glory' - Elgar wrote the original march as part of 'Pomp and Circumstance' without any words, the words were only added later, possibly at the behest of Edward VII for his coronation ode. So there you go.\n\n<Ogdensgoneflake@aol.com> (30.12.2000)\n\nThis is a fun album and if you take it at that you'll enjoy it. At first I was disappointed because I wanted another Sell Out and I got this crap ('I Need You' sucks!). Then giving it a second chance found it to be hilarious ('I Need You' rules!). On the original only one bad song, 'See My Why'. I like 'Don't Look Away' and 'I Need You' and 'Cobwebs And Strange' are good clean fun. 'Run Run Run' is OK but reminds me of 'Call Me Lightning'. As for the big one 'A Quick One While He's Away' is kinda dull here but is better on Leeds. The bonus tracks are all good but I wish they had put on 'Dogs' or the real 'Happy Jack' instead of the acoustic one but pobody's nerfect! (sorry)\n\nPalash Ghosh <palash7@hotmail.com> (08.03.2001)\n\nOh, boy, I just don't like \"A Quick One\" at all -- I think it's pretty much of a mess; and, more importantly, in no way does it reflect The Who's gloriously violent aggressive live act of the time.\n\nAt least John Entwistle came through with some winning tunes: 'Boris The Spider' is fun; but it gets a bit too much praise, it is, after all, just a silly, scary nursery rhyme. 'Whiskey Man' is terrific and largely unknown to non-Who fanatics. If you regard Keith's contributions, 'I Need You' and 'Cobwebs And Strange' as brief wacky comedy numbers, then they can be enjoyed. But if you try to treat them as 'songs,' then they fail miserably. I might be in the minority here, but I just do not like the mini-opera 'A Quick One' and I can't see why it gets so much attention. I think it's an embarrassment, it sounds like something that would be more appropriate for 'Monty Python' and not the world's greatest live rock band! The only original composition I can say anything good about here is Pete's 'So Sad About Us' which works for me. Thank God, the group got it going on the next album!\n\nTed Goodwin <Ftg3plus4@cs.com> (17.03.2001)\n\nMany years ago I bought a 2-LP \"compilation\" consisting of A QUICK ONE and SELL OUT. I won't try to give full reviews because there's a lot I don't remember (having gotten rid of said compilation not too long afterwards) -- just wanted to touch on a few points.\n\n(1) I always liked \"Boris The Spider\" best - one of the very few rock songs where I actually memorized the lyrics. Didn't like \"Whiskey Man\" nearly as much for some reason. (2) I remember actually liking \"See My Way\", or at least the chorus. I don't remember the rest so I must have found it merely undistinguished rather than bad per se. (3) Has anyone noticed that all 4 guys have lead vocals on the \"rock opera\"? At least, I assume that's Keith doing the 1st solo vocal (\"Down your street your crying is a well-known sound\"). He sounds a lot stronger there than on his own \"I Need You\".\n\nRatko Hribar <stormbringer@email.hinet.hr> (06.10.2001)\n\nThis isn't too satisfying. Okay, note that I don't have the fancy remastered version, so I have to manage with stuff I've got. 'Boris The Spider' is the only true masterpiece here. It's funny, creepy and it has some of the weirdest singing at the time (is it possible that The Who influenced Death Metal type growls with this song ?). Other tracks are just sad. The songs are solidly constructed and all, but they just don't IGNITE. Sure, the opener 'Run Run Run' is extremely decent, and some other songs do ignite a little, but not all the way. While 'Whiskey Man', 'Heatwave', 'So Sad About Us' and the title track are all worthy contributions to their repertoire, they don't manage to impress me too often. Gee, I think George is totally right, this is a 5.\n\nP.S. This album actually reminds me of Iggy Pop's Soldier.\n\nHazel <bettydog@capital.net> (10.05.2002)\n\nOkay-the Who's second album, and a good one at that. It's often underrated, but I find it very addicting. 'Run, Run, Run' is thought to be (by me, personally) 'My Generation' whenever I hear the beginning. 'Boris the Spider' is prolly one of Johns' better compositions, and 'I Need You' is Keith-what can I say-it's KEITH! 'Whiskey Man' is a song I always sing, as it is stuck in my head (not aloud, mind you!). 'Heat Wave' is originally a Holland Bros. song. 'Cobwebs and Strange'-I like it because I think Moon does better WITHOUT vocals......'Don't Look Away'-\"Don't go 'n' hide, yesterday you were my girlfriend\". 'See My Way' is a Roger composition (which I BELIEVE is the only one he wrote by HIMSELF). 'So Sad About Us'-I.....I......I......I CRY! I'm a big ol' baby......and 'A Quick One While He's Away'-I know all the lyrics-definitely one of my favorites! And, last, but not least, 'Happy Jack'-a masterpice that appeared on nearly every Who compilation. So....what's my point? My point is that you should go get this album. It's very hard to find it on vinyl as a SINGLE record, I have it doubled up with the Who Sell Out. (Also, 9 more albums....I'm 10-is that odd?) Well, Long Live Rock, and I hope to send in more reviews real soon.\n\nEric Benac <benac@voyager.net> (23.05.2002)\n\nthe song writing slips a bit here, but not a whole lot. 'don't look away' has a good melody and country atmosphere, but is very light weight like you said. moon's contributions are cute, and at least sort of original. entwistle shows himself to be a great song writer. 'run run run' is a great feedback rocker, and funnily enough the velvet underground named an inferior song after this song. i'm sure you know that though. roger's song is shit.\n\nthe mini-rock opera is very good, but i agree it came to life better on stage. 'so sad about us' is amazing. i've heard rocking versions and quiet electric versions and it's never not beautiful. the only way it could lose that beauty is if pete re-arranges it as a techno rap song or something. the bonus tracks help make the album a much better purchase. in general, the album seems to be the first tentative branching out of the who, and experimentation from their \"maximum R&B\" roots and they succeed often. a seven for this without bonus tracks and a 8 with.\n\nZach Smith <spotsgoil88@yahoo.com> (16.07.2002)\n\nProbably their weakest until 75 (You know what I'm talking about... Mama's got a squeezbox...) but the strong songs rock. I hate 'Run Run Run', 'See my way', 'don't look away', and that's it. Moon's songs are both ok, with some good drum solos? in 'Cobwebs'. 'A Quick One' is superior on the kids are alright and 'boris the spider' is great. My fave song is 'Whiskey Man', R.I.P thunder fingers!\n\nGreg Perryman <perryman.family@worldnet.att.net> (07.01.2003)\n\nI should say that on this album, John and Keith are really the stars. Keith's drumming is fantastic and loud (his solos in 'Cobwebs and Strange' are AMAZING), and I am actually quite a fan of his songwriting. Sure, he was not a songwriting genius. At all. But I really enjoy 'I Need You.' (And, on Sell Out, 'Girl's Eyes' is quite good.) All of John's songs are just really fun to listen to. They've got a great rock beat "
