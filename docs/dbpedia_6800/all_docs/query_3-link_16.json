        "text": "For two nights in February 1994, the Juilliard Orchestra joined Roger Daltrey, former lead singer of the Who, at Carnegie Hall for his 50th birthday tour. The concert was arranged and conducted by Michael Kamen, who had started his Juilliard oboe studies in the late ’60s.\n\nBilled as Roger Daltrey Sings Pete Townshend, the concerts also featured Daltrey’s fellow Who members Townshend and John Entwistle as well as the Chieftains, Alice Cooper, Sinéad O’Connor, Linda Perry of 4-Non Blondes, Lou Reed, David Sanborn, the Spin Doctors, and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. Among the hits presented were “Imagine a Man,” “You Better You Bet,” and a suite from Tommy. Ralph Ferris (BM ’93, MM ’94, viola) was a soloist in “Baba O’Riley” with Daltrey, O’Connor, and the Chieftains. In “5:15,” Mark Inouye (BM ’94, trumpet) traded solos with Sanborn.\n\nThe concerts were subsequently televised and featured interviews with students Brian Lewis (BM ’91, MM ’93, violin) and Ferris, and a live recording of the concert, A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and the Who (House of Blues), was released. Carnegie Hall was the first stop on Daltrey’s 1994 tour; other local orchestras performed for the remainder of it."
