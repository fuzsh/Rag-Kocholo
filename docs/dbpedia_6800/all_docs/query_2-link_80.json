Roger joined hundreds of students graduating, some of whom contributed visuals to the US tour of his ‘rock opera’ Tommy.\n\nRoger Daltrey said: ‘If I had the power to give honours, the students would be getting extra honorary degrees from me. After having the privilege of working with them on my production of The Who’s Tommy, I was amazed with their vision and creativity. I look forward to seeing more of their work, knowing that within the visual creative industries, the future is a bright one. For me to receive this degree is an honour indeed.’\n\nIn addition to the many gold and platinum selling records he made with The Who, Roger has also released eight albums as a solo artist and performed in numerous television programmes, films and stage productions.\n\nIn 2005 he was awarded a CBE for his services to music, the entertainment industry and charity.\n\nRoger collected his honorary degree at a ceremony at the Middlesex University’s Hendon campus (north London).\n\nThe award is made as part of the University’s annual graduation celebrations, with honorary degrees presented to people who have made an outstanding contribution to their profession or the community."
