        "text": "\"The Internet's ruined the live shows for me,\" the rock icon told Billboard amid his solo summer U.S. tour\n\nRoger Daltrey revealed that he hates how fans ask about concert setlists before shows in a new Billboard interview\n\nThe Who frontman also explained why he prefers the element of surprise at his live shows\n\nThe lead singer is currently touring the U.S. this summer as a solo act\n\nIn a world where concert setlists are a top search, Roger Daltrey still believes in keeping the element of surprise.\n\nThe Who frontman, 80, aired his grievances about concert culture these days in a new Billboard interview, during which he refused to reveal which tracks he plans to perform on his current 10-date tour across the U.S.\n\n“I’m not gonna talk about songs,” said Daltrey. “Too many people reveal songs. There’s no surprises left with concerts these days, ’cause everybody wants to see the setlist. I’m f---king sick of it.”\n\nThe rock icon also said, “The Internet’s ruined the live shows for me,” adding, “Who wants to know what’s coming next? People forget about surprises. I can’t stand it.”\n\nRelated: The Who’s Roger Daltrey 'Regretted' the One Time He Smashed a Guitar: 'That Was Like Killing the Wife'\n\nThough he didn’t divulge many details about his upcoming shows, Daltrey did say fans could possibly expect to hear The Who’s iconic hit “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” although it’ll sound a bit different live.\n\n“We don’t use a tape loop for the instrumentation. We do it on real instruments,” he explained. “It just takes it off the rails and gives me more room as a singer.”\n\nDon't expect the Who lead vocalist to do the song’s famous scream, though. “I’m not gonna do [it],” Daltrey added. “I’m gonna get the f---king audience to do the scream. I’ve done that scream for 55 years, and I’ve had enough of it. I don’t even want to try it now; it’s brutal on the vocal cords. They can do the scream, and I’ll do everything else. I’m more into singing these days. At the age of 80, I think I deserve to be.”\n\nDaltrey is continuing his road tour this month with musicians Simon Townshend (younger brother of The Who co-founder and vocalist Pete Townshend) on guitar, violinist Katie Jacoby and Billy Nicholls on mandolin and vocals. Percussionist Jody Linscott on percussion, guitarist Doug Boyle, bassist John Hogg, harmonica player Steve Weston, drummer Scott Devours and Geraint Watkins (keyboards) will also join his band.\n\nThe singer’s summer tour picks up again on June 12, in Vienna, Va., and wraps up in Highland Park, Ill., on June 29. According to Billboard, the run of shows includes “a mostly acoustic set of Who gems, rarities, solo nuggets and other surprises,” plus Q&A opportunities for audiences.\n\nRelated: The Who's Pete Townshend Shuts Down Possibility of a Farewell Tour\n\nDaltrey dropped his last solo album, As Long as I Have You, in the summer of 2018. His legendary English rock band — which he co-founded in London in 1964 — last released their 12th studio album, a deluxe version of 2019’s WHO, almost four years ago and embarked on a North American tour in 2022.\n\nIn addition to his new live shows, Daltrey is working on a biopic about the late The Who drummer Keith Moon and still looking for a director. He’s also mulling over a second book to follow his 2018 memoir Thanks a Lot Mr. Kibblewhite: My Story, per Billboard, which could potentially explore some of the insecurities the performer felt during The Who’s early days.\n\n“I didn’t really go deep enough in my first book,” he told Billboard. “Quite a lot of it was terrifying, but I didn’t show it. I need to write about it.”\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
