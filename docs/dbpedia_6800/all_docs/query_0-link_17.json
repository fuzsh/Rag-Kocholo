        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n21 Jun 2022, 07:31\n\nCredit: Outside Organisation\n\nTalk about keeping it in the (musical) family!\n\nThe Who frontman Roger Daltrey has enlisted the talent of not one, but two relatives of guitarist and singer Pete Townshend for his solo UK tour taking place this month.\n\nPete’s brother Simon Townshend will be on guitar and vocals, and fans will recognise the sibling from other Who shows in the past.\n\nJoining Simon is his son, Ben Townshend, who will take to the drums. He’s previously played on Simon’s albums and performed with The Cornerstones.\n\nAfter kicking things off in Bournemouth on Monday (20th June), Roger will play 11 more dates on his UK tour, in which he will perform his solo work, as well as The Who classics. He’ll even take questions from the audience in a Q+A too.\n\nRoger’s solo career began in 1973 with the single Giving It All Away which reached number 5 in the UK charts. It was a track from his first solo album Daltrey, released that same year, which he followed up with 8 more albums, including 2018’s As Long As I Have You.\n\nThe solo tour was rescheduled from 2021, but US fans wanting the whole Who experience can see the band when they reunite for The Who Hits Back! tour starting in October.\n\nWhile Roger is ploughing through a whole year of tour dates, Pete recently shared he isn’t so keen of life on the road.\n\nThe iconic guitarist has expressed his desire to retire from playing live, but has said that vocalist Roger has very different thoughts on the matter.\n\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone in Februray, Townshend explained: “I had a conversation with Roger. I said to him, ‘I don’t want to be like one of these guys that dies on tour.’ I do want to retire. And by ‘retire’ I don’t mean retire from being a musician or artist or creator, but retire from the idea that it requires me to say yes to touring for a load of people to get a smile on their face and go home to their wife and go, ‘Hey, honey! Everything is fine! The Who are going back on tour!’”\n\nThe musician continued: “Roger is of the opinion that he wants to sing until he drops. That’s not my philosophy of life. There are other things that I want to do, still want to do, and will do, I hope. I hope I’ll live long enough to do them.”\n\nRoger Daltrey UK tour dates - tickets available here."
