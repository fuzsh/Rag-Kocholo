        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nIt’s about time our favourite incel gets his own thread.\n\nJ.R. Cash?\n\nWhile we know that Johnny Cash (1932-2003) was born with two initials that are undecipherable, in theory I'd like to think maybe his parents were listening to Jimmie Rodgers (1897-1933) and thus decided to name him Jimmie Rodgers Cash, as Rodgers was still alive until three months after Johnny's first birthday.\n\nI wonder why, in the end, they couldn't think of a proper name for the man that would later be known the world over as Johnny Cash? At least, when he enlisted in the USAF after graduating high school, this during the Korean War, he adopted the first name John, which soon evolved into Johnny.\n\nPost by powerpoppackage on\n\nThis dude REALLY wanted Thin Lizzy to cover this Huey Lewis song that sounds nothing like them:\n\nThis kind of relationship also makes me want to ask: did Phil Lynott ever plan to cut a version of \"Workin' for a Livin'\" with Lewis on harmonica, in the years before he (Lynott) died (1982-86)?\n\nI even think Phil could have sang a few songs from Picture This (\"Workin' for a Livin'\" to name one) as well as \"The Power of Love\" from the Back to the Future film soundtrack.\n\nLewis' friendship with Lynott must have worked out so well, that I still imagine Lynott covering \"Workin' for a Livin'\" with Lewis and the News.\n\nThin Lizzy covering Huey Lewis & the News' \"Workin' for a Livin'\" -- which I suggest due to Huey Lewis (in his days with Clover) having played harmonica for Thin Lizzy on numerous songs from their post-\"Boys Are Back In Town\" period, including on \"Sarah,\" \"With Love\" and the live version of \"Baby Drives Me Crazy.\" But with Phil Lynott's 1986 passing, it'll be tough to envision any TL lineup showing interest in it -- and on top of that, who would play Huey's harmonica parts?\n\nSince his and Lewis' friendship worked out so well, did Phil ever plan to do a cover of Lewis and the News' 1982 hit \"Workin' for a Livin'\" (#41 US) before his death?\n\nAlthough this 1982 top 50 hit was co-written by Huey Lewis and Chris Hayes, I wonder if Lewis actually first wrote the song himself while still a member of Clover (along with keyboardist/singer Sean Hopper), circa 1977, and then set it aside until his new band, Huey Lewis and the News, began looking for material for their second album (upon which Hayes supplied additional music/lyrics)? To me, it certainly has that punkish/New Wave-ish vibe with Sean Hopper's carnival organ.\n\nI wonder if Huey Lewis intended to give the song to Phil Lynott before going back to it for Picture This?\n\nPost by powerpoppackage on\n\nMentioned in another thread but this may be his masterpiece:\n\nViolin Solos Replaced by Harmonica Solos (and Vice-Versa)\n\nCan anyone think of any songs that had a violin part on the studio recording, but was replaced by a harmonica solo when performed live in concert, and vice-versa?\n\nExample 1: Roger Daltrey playing a harmonica solo at the end of The Who's \"Baba O'Riley,\" which had a violin solo by Dave Arbus (of East of Eden) on the original studio cut.\n\nExample 2: Peter Tickell playing a violin solo on live versions of Sting's \"Shape of My Heart,\" replacing the chromatic harmonica solo played by Larry Adler on the studio version.\n\n0 replies, in forum: Music Corner\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nDoes anyone remember when Garth Brooks (who wore a mustache) had performed with the band Santa Fe, in 1986?\n\nOne of the songs they performed was The Charlie Daniels Band's \"Drinkin' My Baby Goodbye,\" which that year was the third single release from Daniels' 1985 album Me and the Boys, and the other was George Strait's \"Nobody In His Right Mind.\"\n\nDoes anyone have the complete broadcast of this band on Oklahoma TV? I do remember seeing portions of this on VH1's Before They Were Rock Stars when they were focusing on the career of Garth Brooks.\n\nPost by hoffa_nagila on\n\n@daved said:\n\nDoes anyone remember when Garth Brooks (who wore a mustache) had performed with the band Santa Fe, in 1986?\n\nOne of the songs they performed was The Charlie Daniels Band's \"Drinkin' My Baby Goodbye,\" which that year was the third single release from Daniels' 1985 album Me and the Boys, and the other was George Strait's \"Nobody In His Right Mind.\"\n\nDoes anyone have the complete broadcast of this band on Oklahoma TV?
