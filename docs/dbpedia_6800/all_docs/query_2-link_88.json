        "text": "ROGER DALTREY is an all-or-nothing kind of guy.\n\nTo borrow a phrase from an old Who compilation, he’s Mr Maximum R&B.\n\n“Life’s a terminal illness and you can’t just go through the motions,” maintains the powerhouse singer.\n\n“When I sing, I’m never more alive. There isn’t a 50 per cent with me.”\n\nI’m spending an intense and illuminating hour with the 74-year-old rock icon to mark his first solo album in 26 years, As Long As I Have You.\n\nFor Daltrey, it’s a rare diversion from those incendiary Who songs which he describes as “Pete Townshend psychotherapy sessions set to fantastic music.”\n\nThe new record serves as a homage to the R&B sounds of his youth, before The Who came kicking and screaming into existence, and finds his towering vocals in fine fettle.\n\n“I wanted to go back to where I started,” he says. “Sometimes you have to go backwards to go forwards.\n\n“It’s soul, it’s gospel, it’s the type of stuff The Who were playing when we were The High Numbers.”\n\nHe applies astonishing presence to Stephen Stills’ road song How Far, to Stevie Wonder’s funk fest You Haven’t Done Nothing, and to a glorious Where Is A Man To Go? complete with full-on female backing singers.\n\nThere’s a tender ballad written by Daltrey in 2003 called Certified Rose, about watching eldest daughter Rosie growing up.\n\nHe says: “I had Rod Stewart in mind for that but I woke up one day a few months ago and I could hear Certified Rose as a soul song. I just needed to add the right ingredients and change the bridge.”\n\nThere’s also a surprising choice in an emotion-drenched cover of Nick Cave’s bittersweet Into My Arms.\n\n“I love Cave, one of the most amazing songwriters of today, and I like his version but I don’t think he sang it as a singer,” suggests Daltrey.\n\n“He keeps a dark side to the song which is great for Nick Cave but I heard something different in it.”\n\nWhen I meet Daltrey in a discreet boutique hotel near London’s Oxford Street, he’s looking dapper in a black waistcoat with matching trousers and a shirt, unbuttoned at the collar, as white as his immaculate teeth.\n\nThe familiar curls are grey and neat enough . . . quite unlike the wild blond lion’s mane that epitomised his bare-chested, mic-twirling late Sixties pomp, Tommy, Woodstock et al.\n\nHe brings passion to his favourite subjects, whether it’s his relentless support for Teenage Cancer Trust, his commitment to Brexit . . . or his storied life in music.\n\nHe speaks affectionately about his brother-in-arms, Townshend, whose generous contributions to the new album prove a guitar masterclass.\n\nDaltrey applies self-deprecating humour to much of what he says, interspersing his observations with infectious cackles of laughter.\n\nAnd he’s looking fighting fit despite after effects of a recent life-threatening bout of meningitis during The Who Hits 50 tour to celebrate the band’s half century in the business.\n\n“I was a month in hospital, touch and go for a few days,” he recalls ruefully.\n\n“I had a long recovery and you never quite get over it. There are bits of me that don’t work now (cue one of those big laughs).\n\n“My feet hurt and my thumbs have gone. I dunno why, it’s really weird.”\n\nBut listen to the 11 tracks on As Long As I Have You and you’ll discover Daltrey’s most precious physical attribute, his golden voice, remains strong and true. So what’s the secret?\n\n“Keep singing,” he replies in a flash. “It’s like any muscle in your body . . . if you don’t exercise it, you’ll lose it.\n\n“I used to overdo it a lot over years and years of singing with The Who. We would do three consecutive nights of three-hour shows, one night off, then we’d do the same again. That was insanity.\n\n“I ended up with a pre-cancerous throat condition but it wasn’t malignant so I got lucky.”\n\nDaltrey adds: “The guy who looks after me now has kept my voice in really good order.\n\n“My insurance won’t let me do two shows on the trot so every time I do one, I have a day off. It means the next time I do a show, I can give it 100 per cent and I’m not wearing myself down.\n\n“I’m really strict with my routine. And you have to be because I’m not a robot, I’m on stage naked.\n\n“If I don’t look after the instrument, and I am the instrument, then I’m f***ed.”\n\nAs it stands, with careful planning of his diary and strict regimes, Daltrey has no intention of quitting but he is realistic about the future.\n\n“If my voice goes, I will stop,” he affirms. “I’ve always said that you don’t retire from this business, the business retires you.\n\n“But I’m singing better than ever at the moment and I will know immediately when I can no longer do that.\n\n“If I have one show which is not quite right, then another and another, I’ll stop.”\n\nDaltrey, quite rightly, is proud of all he has achieved since the working-class West London tearaway began fronting one of Britain’s best-loved bands.\n\nHe’s created a legacy which he’s determined to preserve untarnished.\n\n“Because of the history we’ve built, I would be deeply uncomfortable not to give it everything,” he says.\n\n“It would make a mockery of my whole life. I see so many artists and I know when they’re not fully committed, don’t you?\n\n“It’s f***ing awful to watch. It’s like watching footballers walking around the pitch!”\n\nFor Daltrey, it’s not just about maintaining the quality of his distinctive sound but keeping his intuitive feel for music, the tempos, the rhythms, the grooves, the moods.\n\n“My old body’s scarred so much now, I can only feel!” he cries.\n\nAnd it’s one thing being the frontman of The Who and another having confidence in his solo work.\n\nHe began As Long As I Have You, his ninth studio album and first since 1992’s Rocks In The Head, four years ago but almost shelved the project, as he reveals, “I had eight of the 11 tracks. I listened to them and thought, ‘None of this will do anything.’ I wanted to buy the album back off the record company.\n\n“But my manager sent the material to Pete, who rang me and said, ‘What’s up with you? This is fabulous, you’ve got to finish it.\n\n“Then out of the blue, he said he’d like to play guitar on it. That gave me the confidence to carry on.”\n\nThe Daltrey/Townshend relationship is one of rock’s most enduring despite a few well-documented bust-ups along the way.\n\n“We love each other and always have,” says the singer. “We used to do this wrestling in public but if anyone came between us, God help them!\n\n“I’m very happy just to be his singer and have him, at the end of my life, saying, ‘Roger sung my songs better than I ever could.’ That means a lot to me.\n\n“For years, I was under the impression he hated my vocal on Love, Reign O’er Me, that really high scream.\n\n“He wrote it as a soft, quiet love song. Of course, when I heard it, I thought it was all about love and it was f***ing orgasm time. So I sang orgasm!”\n\nThat song was the momentous finale to 1973’s mod odyssey Quadrophenia, a lifetime away from Daltrey’s 2018 solo album.\n\nBut he says: “For Pete to say he wanted to play on my new record was such an honour because he’s my ultimate guitarist. He’s the most original.\n\n“He can play like Clapton if he wants and he can play like Hendrix but when Pete plays Pete, where does that come from? It’s that rhythmic thing he does.\n\n“He will always take chances and doesn’t mind playing a hundred bum notes for four great ones that make you go, ‘Wow!’ Rock doesn’t need to be perfect, it needs bum notes and beads of sweat.”\n\nDaltrey describes Townshend’s contribution to How Far as “so left field” and his solo on Boz Scaggs’ I’ve Got Your Love as “beautiful and sensitive.”\n\nRog and Pete are among rock’s great survivors, determined to keep The Who’s music alive despite the loss of madcap drummer Keith Moon in 1978 and bassist John “The Ox” Entwistle in 2002.\n\n“We created this music and if we stop playing it, it will disappear,” says Daltrey.\n\n“We’ve just had some of our best years and our music is better known now than when Keith died.\n\n“We were right to go on . . . the music needs to breathe, to be seen and to be heard.”\n\nDaltrey partially puts his success down to the desperation he felt as a teenager.\n\n“I was kicked out of school on my 15th birthday,” he says.\n\n“Today’s young bands, even those from relatively humble backgrounds, still have much, much more than we ever did.\n\n“We had the hunger to drag ourselves out of that f***ing hole we were in. It was either robbing banks like a lot of my mates or doing what I did . . . getting on stage and getting lucky.”\n\nMaybe this explains Daltrey’s motivation to promote Teenage Cancer Trust as its honorary patron, including a recent solo show at London’s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nHis untiring work for the charity is all about giving support to young victims of the cruel disease.\n\n“I remember my teenage years and they’re the hardest years of your life for so many reasons,” he says.\n\n“You’re just starting to think about going out and really enjoying yourself, then a doctor tells you, ‘Sorry, you’ve got this.’ It must be a terrible blow.”\n\n“And when a teenager gets cancer, it affects so many people . . . their families, their mates, their class at school.”\n\nBefore Daltrey and I go our separate ways, he reaffirms his position on Britain’s hottest political topic.\n\n“I’ve never been more sure of why I voted for Brexit,” he tells me.\n\n“I love Europe but being governed by Brussels is the equivalent of being run by Fifa!”\n\nWith a parting peal of laughter and a firm handshake, Roger Daltrey heads for the door.\n\n“I’ve got to go for a bloody hair cut because I’m doing The Graham Norton Show tomorrow,” he reports.\n\nI watch one of rock’s most famous heads of hair depart the scene in the certain knowledge that it sits atop one of its liveliest minds and most majestic voices."
