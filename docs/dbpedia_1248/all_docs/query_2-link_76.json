        "text": "“Édua Amarilla” Zádory, which means „glistening moonrise“ in Hungarian, was born in 1974, in the southern Hungarian town of Kecskemét. At the early age of seven, Édua’s outstanding talent on the violin became evident. Taking part in a competition at the Franz Liszt-Musikhochschule, Édua wowed the judges with her exceptional talent and was offered a scholarship at this outstanding Swiss institute of music.\n\nIn 1992 Édua began to study under star violinists Habib Kayaleh and Tibor Varga. One of the greatest violinist of the 20th century, Yehudi Menuhin, recognized Édua’s exceptional talent. He invited her to join his master classes at Gstaad, Switzerland.\n\nIn 1997 Vienna, the city of music, became the center of her life. At the University of Vienna, Édua studied under highly acclaimed teachers Günter Pichler and Ernst Kovacic. After her university studies, Édua began to attend master classes with István Ruha, Péter Komlós and the Altenberg Trio Wien.\n\nConcerts around the world contributed to her international career. In 2001 Édua and her „Eszterházy-Trio“ proved their talent once more at the Styriarte music festival in the Austrian city of Graz. Heralding the Trio’s performance, the paper „Kleine Zeitung“ wrote that there was „a ghostly fusion between Beethoven’s music and the three musicians“.\n\nAt the music festival „Mondseetage 2003-2005“ Édua Zádory played chamber music at the highest level, together with colleagues Christian Altenburger and Benjamin Schmid. A series of solo concerts followed in the Golden Hall of the Wiener Musikverein.\n\nIn 2005 the „Hungaria Piano Trio“ – Tamás Varga, Édua Zádory und Balázs Szokolay – was formed. Together the trio put on magical performances not only in the Wiener Konzerthaus, but also at the Budapest Spring Festival. „Édua Amarilla Zádory has it all. „Every single stroke of her bow resonates with passion“, noted the Hungarian Culture Magazine „Élet és irodalom“ in 2006.\n\nNumerous TV and radio performances (in Hungary, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, France) as well as CD productions by Hungaroton followed.\n\nThe „Bulgarian Rhapsody“„is Édua Amarilla Zádory’s respectful hommage to (Pancho) Vladigerov and is full of fervid passion and fire“ (www.klassik.com). A world premiere released in 2006 by Hungaroton.\n\nIn June 2007 another world premiere followed in the Austrian town of Prein an der Rax. There Édua Zádory performed the violin solo dedicated to her by the Austrian composer Johanna Doderer.\n\nIn October 2007 hundreds of music lovers were fascinated by Édua’s solo performances at the highly acclaimed Bariloche-Festival „Lao Lao“ and in El Borges di Buenos Aires.\n\nIn September 2008 teatro Nacional di Santo Domingo 1500 people gave Édua a standing ovation after her interpretation of Vivaldi’s „Four Seasons“.\n\nÉdua Amarilla, the „glistening moon“ has recently risen to stardom in places as remote as Iran, Morocco and Turkey. At the National Opera House in Mersin, Édua and Rumanian pianist Raluca Stirbat celebrated great triumphs.\n\nHer professional life in Vienna has been marked by numerous concert engagements. Whether performing solos in the Golden Hall of the Wiener Musikverein, serving as lead chair of the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, or playing alongside the other members of her „young“ Hungaria Piano Trio, Édua’s expressive and beautiful music expertly fuses Hungarian soul with the traditional Viennese sound.\n\nIn 2009 Èdua Zádory in Duo with Anastasiia Dombrovska won first prize at the prestige Gaetano Zinetti international chamber music competition in Sanguinetto / Verona.\n\nIn 2011 she has performed at the Loisiarte Festival in Austria and at the International Canberra Music Festival, as part of the Australia Tour sponsored by the Austrian embassy.\n\nIn June 2012 the newest CD of Duo Edan was released (Gramola Edition). As of September 2012, Edua holds the status of Guest Professor at the All-Quds University College of Music in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2013 gave her first ‘Jeunesse’ concert in Austria, Concert at the Austrian Embassy in Washington DC, USA.\n\nIn December 2015 she played Selman Ada’s Violin Concerto with the Ankara Symphony Orchestra. This is followed by regular collaboration with contemporary composers such as György Kurtág, Friedrich Cerha, Johanna Doderer, Juan Manuel Abras, Wolfram Wagner and Jörg Ulrich Krah.\n\nÈdua is increasingly dedicated to contemporary musical works as well as her own creations in the field of visual arts.\n\nIn 2017 she presented her first exhibition in the Haas & Haas wine cellar. In the same year, she exhibits her paintings in South Hungary – Kiskunhalas, her hometown, and at the same time, she presents her solo debut CD “Heavy”, which was recorded in the Liszt Center Raiding.\n\nSince 2019 Édua partly works and teaches in Buenos Aires, Argentina where her focus is on Argentinien contemporary music. Special Collaboration with “Associación Argentina de Compositores” in order to record live concerts by Argentinien composers.\n\n“Since 2021, she has collaborated with Hugo Ticciati, a violin player and conductor who leads the Festival O’modernt in Sweden.\n\nIn 2021, she recorded her album “NEVERLAND,” which includes her first improvisation with Hernán Quintela on the piano at the Usina del Arte in Buenos Aires. The album is available on Spotify and distributed by Disco Club.\n\nIn November 2023, she will premiere a violin concerto by Mauricio Charbonnier with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Rio Negro and the Symphony Orchestra Provincial of Santa Fe.\n\nÉdua Amarilla Zádory plays a masterpiece violin dating from 1801, crafted by Joseph and Antonio Gagliano, as well as a modern violin dating from 2021 made by Martin Schwalb.\n\nShe is very grateful to have the sponsorship of Thomastik Infeld.”"
