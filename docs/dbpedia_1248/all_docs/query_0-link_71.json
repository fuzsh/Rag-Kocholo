        "text": "EDITORIAL PREFACE This publication is intended to provide an overall insight into the life and works of eighty-fve composers working in Hungary today and was written primarily with an international audience in mind. The way the compilation of this volume was planned, has meant it is only possible to publish condensed biographies of the featured composers and, in many cases, include only selected bibliographies of their works. As such, considering the limitations of space, this is not a comprehensive overview. Spatial constraints have also limited the amount of in-depth information provided on the composers; we have not been able to elaborate on details, for example, such as the movements or structure of certain works, or on the duration of the compositions. The data in this volume has been compiled in collaboration with the composers themselves. We chose to base the structure of this catalogue of works on the publication criterion used in Melinda Berlász’ series of small monographs entitled Hungarian Composers (published by Mágus Publishers, later known as the Budapest Music Center). The structure of the works, as well as frequently occurring terms and categories, are listed in an abbreviated format. For example, in the case of printed editions of sheet music, only the abbreviated name of the publisher is given, since almost all publishers now have an online searchable interface, where further publication details of the works can be found. Any commercially released audio recordings have been abbreviated by their publisher’s abbreviation and release number, as this makes them easy to identify. The composers’ official websites or social media sites (Homepage, You Tube-Channel, Sound Cloud) are also listed in the information section about each composer; however, we would encourage the reader to take advantage of the wealth of information available on the Internet, which can provide more extensive details on the composers’ life and works. We have created a special category for composers who have self-published their unreleased recordings and/or published or self-edited scores of their own works: this category is called “comp. hp.”"
