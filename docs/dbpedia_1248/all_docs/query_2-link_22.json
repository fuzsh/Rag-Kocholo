        "text": "DongÃ³ considers BartÃ³k and KodÃ¡ly's work already being a part of tradition. The title of his new album is a contradictory phrase. Particularly because folk music cannot be a matter of privatization as it is meant for community usage. However DongÃ³ daringly did it. He was allowed to, because what we hear on his new album can only be played by him. Therefore, put up with it: it is an appropriate title.\n\nAnd what can be heard on the disc?\n\nTwelve short compositions by BartÃ³k and KodÃ¡ly, presented in the style of archaic peasant music, as well as the contemporary covers of these masterpieces.\n\nDongÃ³ plays the classical pieces on his folk instruments so naturally and with such confidence as if they were originally written for them. Starting from the collected recordings that inspired BartÃ³k and KodÃ¡ly, keeping the creators' original instructions on matters of dynamics and tempo, in DongÃ³'s work the folk music connects to art music, the traditional to the modern and the spontaneous to the composed. This record is an exciting, very significant and spectacular experiment by DongÃ³ and his outstanding fellow musicians.\n\nWhile listening to it, it comes to my mind that in 1911, along with young Hungarian musicians, BartÃ³k founded the 'New Hungarian Music Association' supporting the endeavors of progressive contemporary music. I'm wondering, how great musical works could have been born in that time if such talented performers like DongÃ³ would have been available for the composers. And what role would the Master give to DongÃ³ if he was alive?\n\nFinally, a good advice for the mainstream-likers as well:\n\nCsinnadratta, ripityom! This album is worth listening to!"
