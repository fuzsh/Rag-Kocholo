        "text": "The role of politics in cultural and social processes\n\nThe structural changes which occurred in Hungarian society after World War II were closely bound up with a redefinition of the place and role of culture. With the country lying in the Soviet sphere of interests, although a brief period of coalition democracy was allowed immediately after the war had finished, it had become perfectly clear by 1948 that the processes of bourgeois evolution, society’s freedom to organise itself by its own lights and the multicultural diversity of that period would not be permitted to continue. In their place was installed a set of social, cultural and educational policies constructed on a Marxist-Leninist platform which had as its principal aim a totalitarian control of society, a homogenisation of the various social groups, and the eradication of all autonomous socio-cultural initiatives. To this end, the Communists used their political apparatus to standardise culture and bring every possible area of life under central supervision. The dismantling of existing local and national organisations, self-improvement and reading circles, clubs and associations, the ending of pluralism in art and literature, the obstacles that were put in the way of independent channels of expression all served to achieve this purpose just as much as the monopoly that was handed to Marxist aesthetics, the exaltation of incomprehensible and indefinable ‘socialist cultural ideals’, and radical overhaul of the educational system.\n\nFrom 1948 the progression to single-party dictatorship and totalitarian subjection of social, economic and intellectual life was rapid. Under the changing socio-political conditions, even Communist party ideology soon lost its original function, turning into rigid dogma, a scientifically unquestionable doctrine, a ‘religion’ of sorts; it was no longer needed so much to provide a source of legitimation as to assist in the totalitarian subjection of society. Under what were now classic Stalinist conditions, the party line was binding on every member of society, and any public representation of values that departed from that line was strictly forbidden; the one and only ‘scientifically based’ viewpoint was thus important for providing the party with a tool with which it thought it could obstruct interpretations that cut against its own perspective. In practice, intellectuals had to resign themselves to losing freedom of thought and expression of divergent opinions.\n\nThe semantic content of language, as the prime means of communication, was a particularly important target of the entire process of transformation. An ‘officialese’ that married paternalism to a military vocabulary became the dominant parlance. Any aspect of change, and especially socio-political change, tended to be discussed in terms of a ‘struggle’ or ‘campaign’, culture or intellectual life in terms of ‘the cultural front’, production in terms of ‘battle’, and mistakes in terms of ‘enemy attacks’. Any response to questions that might arise was framed with reference to ‘the party line’ and ‘the help of the party’, nor need anyone ever feel themselves alone and neglected when ‘our country is part of the vast clan of the socialist camp’ and ‘our socialist state takes care of its citizens’. As the possessor of totalitarian political power, the Communist party was ideologically bound to see itself as the source of all values, cultural as well as others, and thus every social, cultural and artistic phenomenon was politicised, and it was of prime importance that everyone actively involved in the creation and perpetuation of culture should submit to the party’s dictates. In Hungary, as in the rest of Central and East Europe, all ties that had formerly linked its intellectual and social life to Europe’s humanist, Christian-liberal traditions were ruptured – in essence by a radical repudiation of those traditions and a forced assimilation of the country’s culture to the pragmatic Stalinist version of Soviet imperialist politics into which socialism had degenerated.\n\nThe unidimensional social and political life of the years following this change of direction bred new kinds of mentality and conduct. All values were transformed in the name of the irrefutability of the sole ‘true and socially effective’ idea, discussion based on equality of rank and rights was supplanted by the decree from above. The old freedoms of artistic life were brushed aside as the state’s cultural apparatchiks handed down their judgements on the value of individual works and creative artists. Coerced social upheaval, the concomitant of radical economic and political change, transformed the status and conditions of substantial groups in society, very often at the cost of senseless sacrifices.\n\nThe four decades of this period between 1948 and 1989 may not have seen a fundamental change in the underlying ideology and monolithic political command system of Hungary’s ruling caste, but the era was not unrelievedly uniform. A clear transition is discernible in the mid-1960s, when the state power shook off the totalitarian aspect that it had assumed until that point to adopt a less rigorous authoritarian character which itself gradually weakened with the passage of years. This brought with it changed relationships of the state authority to society and to culture, which in turn had repercussions for society’s relationship to culture. The Soviet model of cultural organisation and value system which displaced Hungary’s predominantly European cultural tradition in 1948-49 proved to be more or less serviceable within the rigid limits that it imposed; the paradigm to which that model, in turn, gave way for the decade and a half from the mid-1960s onwards was styled ‘loosening and opening’- a gradual loosening from the fetters of dogmatically interpreted Marxist socialist ideology and from the country’s isolation from the wider cultural and scientific world, and an opening up to new intellectual ideas and approaches, to the mass media and, later on, information technologies that were increasingly shaping everyday lives, to new trends in the arts, and to the new findings that scientific and scholarly work was throwing up. This was a period in which the official cultural policies adopted by the Hungarian régime, virtually alone in the Soviet bloc could be summed up by what were known as the ‘Three Ts’: tiltás (‘prohibition’), tűrés (‘tolerance’) and támogatás (‘support’), or what in English one might call the ‘Three Bs’ of ‘banned’, ‘bearable’ or ‘backed’. At first, creative artists, works and new cultural initiatives still tended to fall under the extremes of either being wholeheartedly endorsed or else just as outrightly condemned, but gradually the scope widened for what could be permitted or tolerated, if not embraced with any official enthusiasm. The cultural course of what proved to be the last decade of the entire socialist era is best described as one of ‘contact building’ as the barriers to dialogue and collaboration between Hungary and western Europe that individuals and institutions working in the fields of culture, science and the arts had previously faced were increasingly dismantled and ever closer links were forged. By then, the bounds of what official cultural policy was prepared to tolerate, as compared with earlier periods, were being continually rolled back; many of Hungary’s more creative intellectuals, except those who took the path of open political opposition, stepped from the shadow of official banishment into the category of the bearable, and even the ranks of those who were actively backed. Attempts were no longer being made to maintain an exclusive preserve for socialist ideology; ritual, and increasingly superficial, genuflection to its hegemony was accepted as sufficient.\n\nBy the mid-1980s it had become patently obvious in Hungary that a socialist command economy and one-party political system were unsustainable: the régime was incapable of implementing the actions that its own political-ideological stance required. Under pressure from a society seeking its own autonomous forms of political organisation, the régime was compelled to cede its monolithic hold on power and, in a transitional period covering roughly the years between 1987 and 1991, one-party authoritarian rule was replaced by parliamentary democracy. Hungarian cultural and scientific life regained a large measure of freedom from ideological shackles, though they now had to face severe constraints imposed by a prolonged period of restructuring systems of institutional and financial support in line with the prevailing new political, economic and social realities.\n\nSociety, social space, natural environment\n\nDemographics and social statistics of change\n\nHungary’s military, civilian and material losses during World War II were devastating. An estimated 800,000-900,000 of its populace were killed and some 40 per cent of its national wealth in 1938 was destroyed as a direct result of ground battles, air attacks and Holocaust. Added to this were massive forced transfers of population, affecting a minimum of 450,000-550,000 people, in the immediate post-war years of 1945-48 which likewise had a major impact on the country’s demography: around 60,000-80,000 fled from neighbouring states to Hungary as a consequence of fighting or renewed frontier adjustments; some 170,000-180,000 ethnic Germans were forcibly evicted from the country; a euphemistically termed ‘population exchange agreement’ between Hungary and Czechoslovakia led to 90,000 ethnic Hungarians inhabitants of Slovakia being driven out into Hungary and 60,000 ethnic Slovak inhabitants of Hungary moving the other way; and finally approximately 136,000 resettled internally within the country, mainly from the Alföld to the southern counties of Baranya, Tolna, Somogy and Bács, to take up properties released by land reform or left behind by the deportees. An indication of the size of the changes is that in 1949 close to 376,000 in the Hungarian population had been born outside the country’s borders as they stood in 1938, principally in Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. There was one further occasion for mass emigration in the course of the post-war decades, when some 180,000 people chose to flee the country permanently in the aftermath of the 1956 revolution. If to these ‘1956-ers’ are added all the rest who left by one means or another, legally or illegally, a total of 420,000-430,000 emigrated from Hungary over the entire period between 1945 and 1989.\n\nConsecutive national censuses set the population of Hungary at 9.2 million in 1949, 9.96 million in 1960, 10.71 million in 1980, and 10.37 million in 1990. The natural annual increase in population slowly declined from a maximum of 11-12 per thousand in 1953-54 to an average of around 2-4 per thousand by the early 1970s then, after a temporary rise in the mid-1970s, continued to drop back steadily from the early 1980s. In the first third of the 1980s, as a result of falling fertility and rising mortality, natural increase turned into a net natural decrease – a process which carried on into the 1990s: the birth rate had stabilised at the turn of the ‘Eighties at a level of around 11-12 per thousand, whilst mortality was steadily rising at a rate of 13-15 per thousand.\n\nThe sex distribution over the period 1949-90 was subject to smaller fluctuations but throughout there was an excess of females: in 1949 there were 1,081, in 1960 – 1,073, in 1980 – 1,064, and in 1990 – 1081 females for every 1,000 males. The age structure altered considerably, with the age-group under 19 years falling back from 31.7 per cent of the populace in 1949 to 27.2 in 1990, and that of 20 to 59 years from 55.7 per cent to 51.3 per cent, whilst the age-group of 60 years or older grew from 12.6 per cent in 1949 to 21.5 per cent in 1990.\n\nLife expectancy at birth is a function of changes in the living conditions and standard of life of the population as a whole. In the post-war years right up to the mid-1960s it rose fairly steadily for both sexes, to reach figures of 67 years for males and 72 years for females, after which it began to decline for males but carry on increasing moderately for females. Throughout the 1980s and into the ‘90s the average life expectancy at birth in Hungary was 65 years for men and 74 years for women, with increased mortality amongst middle-aged men being the biggest single factor in those changes over the last decade and a half to two decades. Infant mortality dropped very considerably from the 1950s onwards, whilst overall mortality for all age-groups reached its lowest point as the country entered into the 1960s. Over the period there were major changes in the pattern of causes of death: whereas infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhoid fever and other enteric infections, measles and whooping cough were still important in the middle of the century, by the ‘Seventies and ‘Eighties cardiac and circulatory disorders, cancer and neurological degenerative diseases were the more important causes. During the second half of the twentieth century, in other words, trends in the levels of health and mortality in the population came to be determined by factors relating to lifestyle and environmental damage.\n\nA broadening in accessibility and rising standards of health care were clearly factors that worked for an overall improvement in the health of the population. The number of doctors nearly quadrupled from 11 per 10,000 inhabitants in 1950 to 41 in 1990, whilst hospital bed provision increased 70 per cent, from 56 to 96 per 10,000, over the same period.\n\nThe proportion of the Hungarian population in active employment grew continuously by 3 per cent per decade, on average, during the 1950s and ‘60s, after which it switched into a continuous decline, primarily due to a fall in the size of the working-age population. During the 1980s the relative size of the workforce contracted by 7 per cent and during the first half of the ‘90s by a further 7 per cent, by which time it was unequivocally as a result of the economic restructuring that accompanied the change in political régime. Thus whilst the workforce had numbered 4.1 million in 1949 and 5.1 million in 1970, it had reduced to 4.5 million in 1990 and just 3.7 million in 1994. Within those figures, moreover, is a very substantial increase in women’s employment, from 29 per cent of the total workforce in 1949 to 44 per cent in 1975 and 46 per cent in 1990.\n\nReflecting those trends, the dependency ratio, having dropped from 1949 until the 1970s, began to rise at a growing pace, from 117 dependants per 100 of the economically active population in 1975 to 117 in 1985, 129 in 1990 and (with unemployment becoming a significant factor) 174 in 1994. The processes of transformation in social structure can be seen in changing patterns of employment. Thus the percentage of the workforce categorised as professionals or managers rose from 1.8 to 11.0 per cent and others in white-collar jobs from 8 to 22.4 per cent between 1949 and 1990. Over the same period, the proportion of unskilled industrial workers fell from 12.1 to 5.9 per cent, whilst that of semi-skilled workers increased from 5.2 to 18.1 per cent and that of skilled workers from 11.2 to 25.7 per cent. Though the ratio of agricultural workers climbed from 6.9 to 11.6 per cent, there was a huge drop in the proportion of self-employed smallholder peasants, from 46.7 to 1.1 per cent, and a smaller reduction, from 8.1 to 4.2 per cent, in that of self-employed artisans and tradesmen. With the Communist take-over of power, the upper circles of the party leadership took the places of the pre-1948 élite to form a privileged nómenklatúra of those occupying the top posts in government and the economy. During the 1980s the composition of this élite began to change fairly extensively – a process of replacement that was completed with the change in régime of 1989-90.\n\nThe social evolution of the decades ensuing after 1948 might be called a process of ‘half-hearted’ modernisation whereby the material and technological standards of living for most of Hungarian society improved progressively but other factors that bore on the quality of life were essentially unchanging. The general trend of that evolution was similar in many respects to the structural changes of western European societies, but there were significant areas of difference.\n\nThe prevailing socialist political system was capable of sustaining economic growth during the 1960s and ‘70s then, from the ‘80s onwards, not even that. By its very nature, the régime played a big part in the weakening of social relations, in breaking down the tender shoots of solidarity that are necessary for the ‘normal’ functioning of any society, principally because it was unable to tolerate any form of communal initiative that ventured beyond the scope of family life. One sign of this was the increasingly unfavourable course that was seen from the late 1950s in certain indices of social deviance (suicide, alcoholism), which in many cases were the outcome of serious problems in human relationships that were being experienced within Hungarian society. The post-1948 modernisation process was thus half-hearted not only for failing to nurture society’s capacities for dealing with conflict but also for blocking the adjustment of forms of behaviour appropriate to a civil society and, over a prolonged period, suppressing the kind of culture that would be capable of creating and mediating genuine values. So far as they go, the statistics that are conventionally treated as indicators of modernisation, such as the changing pattern of occupations or the advancement in educational levels of the population, do indeed attest to a very distinct break from the past. The proportion of the population directly employed in the agricultural sector shrank from 53.8 per cent in 1949 to 15.4 per cent in 1990, yet there are statistics from 1988 to show that fully 45 per cent of the adult inhabitants of the country were engaged in some form of private small-scale farming – a high ratio which was the result of a duplication of social, political and economic structures that was highly characteristic of the era and, in itself, an indication of how Hungary’s modernisation process differed qualitatively from that in western Europe. That was underlined by a relative backwardness of the service sector and a noticeable decline in standards of behaviour. Modernisation in Hungary during this era meant primarily – and in some periods exclusively – industrialisation. Under the imposed political conditions, both Hungarian society and the economy suffered a significant loss of capability to adapt: \"It remained a distinctive characteristic of Hungary’s social structure that alongside the position it occupied in the ‘first economy’, the dimension of state redistribution, there existed a second dimension, that of the ‘second economy’ in the wider sense of a private or market economy. A ‘binary society’ thereby came into existence\" (Andorka, 1992).\n\nSocial restructuring in Hungary, under the pressure of political coercion, proceeded with great rapidity between 1950 and 1975. Having progressively opened up in the two decades immediately after 1945, society then began to lose a substantial part of that openness as it went into the 1970s, with the result that individuals’ prospects for changing their status steadily worsened. The growth of the residential population of the towns was conspicuously lower than the rate of expansion of urban employment, indicating that industrialisation was not accompanied by commensurate development of the country’s infrastructure, an extension of the process of urbanisation. Whilst school rolls raced upwards and general levels of educational attainment improved markedly during the 1950s, from the late ‘70s and into the ‘90s the proportion of the younger generation who gained the main high-school leaving certificate (érettségi) or a first degree at college (diploma) remained stuck at virtually the same relatively low level.\n\nIn important respects the situation in which Hungary’s social transformation took place during the 1950s and ‘60s bore the marks of a process of neo-colonialism, with the representatives of the dominant foreign power and its values indiscriminately imposing their power and social order upon the subject populace without giving it the slightest say in whether it wished to accept or reject the new. A process of consolidation that was set in train under the Kádár régime in the late 1960s made possible, against its original intentions, a growing divergence from the classical Soviet model of social organisation, principally through vigorous expansion of the second economy, then during the ‘80s the process by which certain social groups were able to win a measure of partial economic autonomy from the state gathered pace and spread to ever-widening strata of the population.\n\nSpatial relocation and housing conditions\n\nRegional and local development policies formulated in the late 1940s and early ‘50s were shaped by an increasingly strong drive to centralisation. Guidelines for development plans to meet the new spirit of the times were hammered out in 1950 by the National Planning Office and the Regional Planning Institute. The definitive premises of socialist policy for decades to come were arrived at by categorising settlements in a manner that failed to reflect the realities of their position, with the area that villages, and particularly those with small populations, actually occupied being consistently underestimated. Through this discriminatory policy, two-thirds of Hungarian settlements in the mid-1970s fell into a category where no development was scheduled. Its practical effects were disadvantageous particularly for small hamlets and for the isolated farmsteads that made up the tanya system, which had come into being over extensive areas of the countryside in response to the particular structure of land ownership and agricultural production that had prevailed in Hungary until the end of World War II but was now regarded as a symbol of the separatist stance of private farmers and therefore targeted for total elimination at the earliest possible opportunity. The development plan for the capital, at the very pinnacle of the settlement hierarchy, contained equally unrealistic objectives, which were to become increasingly manifest in infrastructural deficiencies and housing shortages for decades thereafter. Forced industrialisation had particularly dramatic effects for a group of small towns – Komló, Tatabánya, Kazincbarcika and Várpalota – that were singled out as ‘socialist cities’, and this was also the time when construction work began on the greenfield site that was to grow into the city of Sztálinváros (later renamed Dunaújváros). Regional disparities were compounded all the more by the generally irrational political considerations that governed the distribution of development funds from the centre.\n\nThe dominant process of the era was one of urbanisation. The number of population centres, including Budapest, that enjoyed municipal status in Hungary was 54 in 1949, 63 in 1960, 96 in 1980, and 166 by 1990. There was a parallel jump in the urban population, from 36.9 per cent of the country’s inhabitants in 1949 to 61.8 per cent in 1990. At the same time, the proportion of village communities (község) rose a mere 3 per cent between 1949 and 1960, largely by creating so-called ‘tanya centres’, but then between 1970 and 1990 a process of merging settlements brought the number back down by 5 per cent. One undoubted positive feature of planning policy was the widening of the urban network and the appearance of regional centres within the country. Overall, however, the modernisation of Hungary’s population geography as a whole was purely nominal since in many respects differences in living conditions between town and village were left untouched, whilst significant disparities were allowed to persist between individual towns.\n\nThe scale of internal migration during the socialist era reached extremely high levels. Between 1949 and 1971 the number of people living in tanya settlement areas almost halved, from 1.6 million to 860,000, whilst during the 1950s alone more than half a million people relocated from villages into the towns, with a further three million permanently leaving their original village between 1960 and 1970, some to move to the towns, others to resettle in more thriving villages. In the early 1970s the effectively unidirectional stream towards the town began to reverse as substantial numbers of town dwellers moved outwards to the villages.\n\nBudapest continued to expand vigorously after World War II, from 1.59 million inhabitants in 1949 to 2.014 million in 1990, with the rate of growth being particularly high between 1950 and 1970 and primarily due to immigration from other parts of the country. The ‘70s and ‘80s were a period of mounting social and spatial inequalities within the area of the capital and also of a widening gap between the capital as a whole and the rest of the country.\n\nThe most important task that Hungary faced in the immediate post-war years was that of repairing the wartime damage and replenishing the urban housing stock. However, the slowness of that construction programme gave rise to serious social tensions during the 1950s and ‘60s as the housing shortage in the towns was made still more acute by the influx of former agricultural workers to take up jobs in manufacturing industry. For much of the population, indeed, obtaining a dwelling of adequate size and quality was one of the most pressing problems of the post-war years. Between 1945 and 1948 a net total of seven new dwellings were built annually for every one thousand inhabitants, but then even that favourable balance largely disappeared between 1948 and 1956 as new construction fluctuated between 1.8 and 3.2 dwellings annually per one thousand inhabitants. To make a bad situation worse, the one-sided concentration of investment on industrial development left inadequate finances to attend to the infrastructure of built-up areas, as a result of which the general standard of housing provision, and hence of the living conditions that depend so crucially on that provision, steadily deteriorated throughout the 1950s. Less than half of the more than 200,000 dwellings that had been scheduled for construction between 1949 and 1954 were actually built, and the quality of the dwellings that were built was well below what might reasonably be expected. This was true even for the socialist cities that were selected for preferential treatment. Under the first Five-Year Plan, the new town on the Danube that was named after Stalin saw a seven-fold growth in population but housing was so scarce that the average occupancy rate was over five people per household, and the bulk of the dwellings were not only tiny – just 35-40 square metres in floor area – but also provided with only the most basic of conveniences. Public utilities both there and elsewhere in the country were usually well behind the level of demand generated by population growth.\n\nThe take-over of tenement blocks and the bigger apartments and family houses by the Hungarian state at the end of the 1940s was just one of the measures constituting part of a major change in property rights aimed at eliminating private ownership as widely as possible. Whilst it significantly increased the volume of housing under state control, particularly in the towns, the removal of the market mechanism – at least temporarily – from housing supply had a detrimental effect on residential mobility, and the system of state allocation which took its place became a source of major social inequalities. Since construction of housing in the state sector was concentrated almost exclusively on towns, in rural areas people were largely left to their own resources in providing for their housing needs. In this way, the curious situation arose that up until the mid-1970s more than half of the new dwellings that were added to the country’s housing stock each year were built from private resources; it was only from this point onwards that the programme of state-financed house construction became more important.\n\nA substantial improvement in the supply of new housing units occurred as Hungary entered into the 1960s. During the ensuing period up to the early ‘80s the pace of construction picked up to over nine new dwellings annually for every thousand inhabitants, or an average total of 80,000-100,000 new dwellings per year. The peak year of post-war construction was 1975, when 9.4 new dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants were built, but from the first third of the 1980s onwards, as the country’s economic situation deteriorated, the rate again dropped back sharply to nearer levels last seen in the ‘50s, with just 3.9 new dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants being built in 1990.\n\nFor all the slow overall improvement in housing conditions, at the time of the change in régime in 1990 a substantial part of the Hungarian population was still living in dwellings that fell a good way short of what nowadays count as basic standards of convenience. By 1990, fully 67 per cent of the country’s total housing stock had been constructed since 1945. Whereas 40 per cent of all dwellings in 1949 were built with mud-brick or wattle-and-daub walls and no foundations, that was still true of only 9 per cent of homes in 1990. The national average household density of 2.59 persons per room in 1949 had fallen to 1.1 persons per room by 1990. A flush toilet was installed in only 13 per cent of households in 1949 but 26 per cent of homes were still without one in 1990; similarly only 10 per cent of households had their own bathroom in 1949 but 23 per cent were still lacking one in 1990.\n\nThese statistics again underline the half-heartedness of much of the modernisation that took place in Hungary during the era. Muddled as it may have been in its outcome, this span of almost half a century was decisive in shaping the housing situation of the country today, with the 2.5 million dwellings that were constructed over that period comprising more than half of the present housing stock. By the 1990s Hungary no longer had a significant shortage in the amount of housing, but the quality of the housing still left quite a lot to be desired. The greater part of the worst deficiencies are to be found amongst the roughly half a million dwellings built with prefabricated technologies and the stock of city tenement buildings that still remains from the turn of the nineteenth century.\n\nA feature of house-building during that era, in that it far surpassed in scale anything seen elsewhere in post-war Eastern Europe, was the importance of the recruitment of voluntary labour amongst family and friends to assist with private construction, which had a particular impact on housing provision in rural communities. Largely through these cooperative efforts, in very many villages by the 1970s and ‘80s the typical three-room home with outbuildings and no conveniences of the immediate post-war years had been replaced by dwellings with all or most modern amenities.\n\nChanges in social spaces and urbanisation: architecture and the visual culture of public spaces\n\nThe manner in which public spaces, the streetscape, the internal spaces of public buildings, workplaces, residential buildings and individual dwellings are designed and furnished are objective indicators of human relationships. It is these features which constitute the framework of the daily lives of a population, the material conditions in which people undertake their individual and social activities. Their visual appearance is closely linked with the kinds of lifestyle that are determined by the social conditions of the population in question. The structure and degree of urbanisation of a settlement, the extent to which public spaces are developed and their functionality, the nature of the building stock, the size of homes and structure of households – these are among the variables that determine how people conduct their lives. In Hungary social spaces underwent a number of functional changes in consequence of political developments over the period between 1948 and 1990. The first two decades were a period of the tyranny of ideology and propaganda, the second two a period of reflecting the values of a ‘pseudo-consumer society’ and of a partial humanisation of those spaces.\n\nThe aggressively expansionist character of the dominant ideology in the earlier, socialist era meant that special attention was given to investing the social environment with political content. As a result, from the late 1940s public spaces underwent significant changes in their visual amenities. Objects which might be reminiscent of earlier eras or, in the opinion of those who decided cultural policy, were vehicles of values that were opposed to socialist expectations were removed and replaced by items that met the new requirements. The typical public art-work of the period was a political monument that, more often than not, attempted to project the allure of a radiant future through a portrayal of optimism and dynamism. Many of the large number of these outdoor sculptures from the ‘Fifties were no more than enlargements of works that had originally been conceived as figurines; only in the late ‘Sixties did the aesthetic and decorative function of sculpture in public sites begin to regain some currency.\n\nWhat quickly came to be seen as the prime symbol for the entire Rákosi dictatorship of the years immediately after 1948 was an eight-metre high statue of Stalin that was unveiled in Budapest, on 16th December 1951, before a crowd of 80,000 people packed into the widened section of Dózsa György út, then called Felvonulási tér (Parade Square), just east of Hősök tere (Heroes’ Square). The work of Sándor Mikus (1903-1982), this perfectly fulfilled the propaganda needs of the early part of that decade, not just as a symbol of its era but also as a cultic idol which, in the eyes of the Communist leadership, \"embodies all progressive aspirations of a millennium of Hungarian history\". An article from that time which appeared in the Party newspaper Szabad Nép ventured to suggest that \"the Stalin statue which towers above our city proclaims that ... to love one’s homeland and to be true to the Soviet Union, to be patriotic and also international, as befits a proletarian – is one and the same thing\". The statue was toppled during the first night of the 1956 revolution and not subsequently restored; in its place was taken in 1965 by a far more modest statue of Lenin (also removed since 1990). During the years immediately after World War II a monument to the Red Army’s war dead was erected on a central site, frequently in the grounds of a church or adjacent to it, in virtually every village and town in Hungary. Any function these might have had as marks of respect became entirely secondary to their perception by society at large as primary symbols of Soviet imperialism. During the 1950s public buildings in Hungary were likewise used as direct instruments of state propaganda, their facades being almost invariably decorated with slogans and red stars; no local council office was without its rolls of honour and disgrace posted on notice-boards set up before their entrance.\n\nIn the ensuing period there were important changes in these public spaces, and the visual cues that they supplied, in that, during the 1960s and ‘70s, an ideological freight was still preserved but had a diminishing role. The conceptual content and subjects of memorial statuary and sculpture used as a decorative element on buildings began to alter around 1960 as scope was allowed for the creation of more autarchic and personal statements. Nevertheless, in the early ‘60s it became almost obligatory for Hungarian towns to put up a statue of Lenin, and up till the end of the ‘70s banners bearing the slogans of the moment were still commonly affixed across or alongside main thoroughfares and on the walls of factories and public institutions. Advertising hoardings or posters for consumer goods had no effective place during the 1950s but regained their role in the climate of consolidation of the ‘60s, when stimulation of consumer demand once more became an important consideration. Even so, the visual design of most advertising material was far from inspired throughout the 1970s and indeed only began to show any real vibrancy in the late ‘80s. Like most other visual aspects projected by the public spaces of the socialist era, with rare exceptions, it merely reflected a milieu that largely lacked stimuli to be creative.\n\nThe location and stratification of institutions and residential buildings within a settlement generally have significance, over and above any functional considerations, as indicators of local social relations in that they comply with some hierarchical ordering within that society. The place that a dwelling occupies within a settlement is generally a pointer to the owner’s social rank and position, and for all the significant evolution that the traditional system of social customs may have undergone during the 1960s and ‘70s even in the rural areas of Hungary, that position down to the present day has preserved some portion of the old, pre-war prestige-based social structures and value systems.\n\nThe vast housing projects which got under way in Hungary from 1967 onwards, each designed to provide dwellings for an average of 20,000-40,000 people, were supposed not only to meet mass housing needs but also to accelerate a process of social equalisation by embodying a conjunction of need, technology and ideology. The earliest such projects were sited on the fringes of cities but over time crept ever nearer to already built-up inner-city areas. Modernisation therefore not infrequently entailed the sacrifice of historical areas: the loss of their historical character by the centres of Debrecen, Kecskemét and Óbuda are just a few examples. Neither city authorities and planners nor construction teams paid sufficient attention to ensuring that old and new were organically linked, as a result of which the residential zones of most towns came to be dominated during the 1960s and ‘70s by the new housing schemes. In not a few cases (e.g. Kazincbarcika, Komló, Tatabánya, Ajka, Dunaújváros) residential and factory zones were allowed to be sited too closely together, with the result that town dwellers were exposed to major industrial pollution. The housing projects significantly reduced the amount of open spaces suitable for recreational purposes, and it was a regular occurrence when selecting the site for a new scheme to overlook quite elementary quality-of-life requirements relating both to implications for the structure of the town and links with the public transport system. Almost without exception, the big housing projects were aesthetically dreary and functionally uninviting. The rectangular boxes of housing, laid either on the side to make four-storey blocks or on their end to make ten-storey towers, were not dimensioned so as to permit apartments of only very modest floor area – on average a mere 53 square metres, and were monotonous in the extreme; indeed, given the general emptiness of the actual space within projects and the regularity in form of such few structures as there were, it is hardly appropriate to speak of visual arrangement in any traditional sense. The spaces were reduced to the minimum required to sustain life and were as good as useless for any sort of communal activity, so the overall level of amenity offered by the projects was generally low. Across Hungary, by 1985, 1.6 million people were living in 518,000 apartments in 408 new housing projects of this kind. Although this represented a success of sorts in trapping, at least temporarily, a wide variety of people of different social status in near-identical living conditions, differentiation had already begun to emerge again in Hungarian society during the 1970s and only intensified during the ‘80s and ‘90s as inequalities progressively widened. From the 1980s onwards a substantial turnover of residents in the housing projects began as those who had the means exchanged their apartments for better quality homes and their places were taken by people coming from housing of poorer standard.\n\nIn light of the above, the architecture of the socialist era could reasonably be described as a form of megalomania, with its monumental building projects and the grandiose scale of its public spaces and the objects within those spaces. Inevitably, this form of architecture was in thrall to the demands of the dominant ideology of socialist realism, its primary function being to mediate equality, the democratism of socialist order, the reciprocity of life and work, and the paramountcy of communal life; buildings and public spaces were supposed to reflect the superiority of socialist economic mechanisms and the power and goals of the working class. Architects were expected to come up with solutions which met the requirements of ‘creating a new world’ whilst also giving visual expression to the country’s greatness and evoking a puritanically impersonal functionality. Typically, Hungary’s socialist cities, intended as the crowning symbols of this form of ‘new life’, were all too often planned as complexes of buildings and public spaces which left no room for the intrusion of any sort of green belt. Architecture’s adoption of socialist realism as an exclusive principle can be dated with some precision to around 1950-51, but much of the theory and formal devices that were drawn on in practice were simply lifted from the eclecticism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. It left its stamp on most of the residential and public buildings of the 1950s and ‘60s, and it was only from the late ‘70s that any significant departures from the ruling orthodoxy began to be accepted. Thus human considerations, the shaping of a cultural landscape directed towards satisfying real needs, were given short shrift virtually throughout the socialist era.\n\nBesides bringing new towns into existence, socialist realist architecture transformed many areas of existing towns, but it had relatively little impact on rural areas. What emerged in village communities, around the end of the 1960s, was more of an attempt to impose a kind of uniformity through the construction of ‘box’ houses. However, the wave of predominantly do-it-yourself home building that got under way in villages drew its inspirations from a wide assortment of stylistic elements, giving rise to an architectural mix that was usually as much a function of the builder’s financial status. The appearance of villages changed as regional differences and idiosyncrasies were increasingly forsaken. The key difference between living conditions in urban and rural homes was that village residences built out with their owners’ private labour tended to be much more spacious and also more in keeping with their surroundings than most town dwellings.\n\nThe lifestyle entailed by the multi-storey residential blocks of a housing project was quite different from that in small-town streets of closed, single-storey dwellings or in villages that consisted almost exclusively of family homes. Nevertheless the correlation between the size of a settlement and the type of construction to be found there was not hard-and-fast. Towns and cities were also fringed by zones of family houses; 43 per cent of the inhabitants of Budapest, for example, were living in single-storey dwellings in 1970. Barely one-third of those living in single-storey houses in the country as a whole – 88-90 per cent of those situated in Budapest, close to 50 per cent of those in small towns, but just 16-18 per cent of those in villages – had access to a piped water supply at that time, as compared with 99 per cent of residents of multi-storeyed urban housing. Even as late as 1977 almost 10 per cent of the country’s population (300,000 families) were still having to fetch water for their household needs from a site more than 100 metres distant from the home. The gap widened still further during the 1980s so that although by the early ‘90s three-quarters of Hungarian households had a mains supply of water, just 40 per cent were connected to public sewers.\n\nGiven the unrivalled dominance enjoyed by the dictates of the ‘progressive traditions’ of socialist realism in Hungarian architecture from the early 1950s, domestic architects were, for over a decade, barred from having any recourse to modern architectural ideas. Though the tentative beginnings of a thaw began to be seen in the late ‘50s, a brief wave of innovation that came with freeing from formal constraints had effectively been snuffed out by the mid-’60s with buildings virtually throughout the country being constructed to a similar characterless formula. These bleakly modernistic creations made no concessions whatever to their surroundings; indeed, as the sole manifestations of modernity in architecture they stood in stark contrast to older building stock. Simplifying approaches led to devastation of the historical centres of some cities and failure to restore valuable clusters of monuments; over the course of the socialist era, architecture was devalued and subordinated to expediencies of big industrialised construction concerns and the paternalistic political bureaucracies charged with their direction. Most architects resigned themselves to churning out hackneyed designs to stereotyped formulas; only the few who had determination as well as talent were able to stand out from drab uniformity.\n\nThis ‘faceless’ architecture was gradually edged towards the sidelines as design offices and ateliers of more intellectually demanding architects, who placed greater emphasis on the relations of buildings to their milieu and on the functional role of streets and spaces, began to emerge during the early 1970s. By then Imre Makovecz (1935-) had started to attract growing attention with markedly individualistic plans which explored ‘organic’ principles, the use of natural materials and national vernacular traditions. The increasing store placed on native traditions was also a central concern of the ‘Youth Office’ (Ifjúsági Iroda) founded by György Csete (1937-) at Pécs in the early 1970s, and since then more generally known as ‘Group Pécs’. A growing list of talented young architects who began their careers around this time – amongst others, József Finta (1935-), Péter Magyar (1937-), István Janáky (1938-), Ferenc Bán (1940-) and Péter Reimholz (1942-) – likewise struck off on their own individual paths, showing themselves increasingly unwilling to allow politically inspired ideology to shackle their creativity.\n\nThe room for manoeuvre allowed to architects under the external conditions set by the commissioners of new buildings and their political masters underwent another change towards the end of the 1970s. With deepening economic recession, the keynotes that came increasingly to the fore, in place of the ‘sweep-all-aside’ attitudes of the past, were now frugality and preservation of values, bolstered by a swell of local town-conservancy pressure groups seeking to build up a sense of local social identity. Architecture, however, continued to gain in diversity as the over-simplifications of modernity continued to give way to greater wealth of expression, evocation of historical memories, greater consideration of functional needs, and new approaches at all levels of town and country planning, down to the design of individual buildings, that sought alternative solutions and took ecological issues more into account. By then most architects were striving to negotiate a harmonious transition between private and public spaces. By the late 1980s, the impoverished formal vocabulary of state-directed mass housing had finally been ousted by residential architecture for private dwellings or apartment blocks that paid attention to individual needs, and vast estates of industrialised blocks by zones of family homes.\n\nChanges in the natural environment under socialism\n\nMan’s changing relationship to his environment in the post-war era fell into two phases. During the period of extensive economic development which lasted up to the end of the 1960s the country’s leaders treated the natural environment as a limitlessly exploitable resource. Centralisation of economic organisation and a policy of forced industrialisation through one-sided development of heavy industry, with its demands for raw materials, placed higher than average – indeed, quite unnecessary – burdens on the environment. Scant heed was paid to natural resources, with the landscape being regarded, in good Stalinist fashion, as a canvas that man was free to alter to meet his own needs. In 1950, for example, a grand plan was conceived to take advantage of the Hortobágy region of the Alföld by turning this area of salt savannah, rich in natural resources, into a large-scale agricultural concern, to which was tied the construction of a three-step barrage on the Tisza. In the end the plan was not implemented as originally planned, though the Tiszalök barrage and the Eastern Main Channel, which had been started before the war,* were completed by the beginning of 1956. A further barrage was installed upstream at Kisköre a few years later.\n\nSince no attention was given to assessing expected or possible harmful environmental impacts when making investment decisions, in practice nothing was done to prevent such damage; protecting the environment simply did not figure amongst the considerations that informed economic and social policies. In planning new settlements and big industrial concerns no thought was given to fitting in with the natural environment or the endowments of the regional landscape. During this same period there was a substantial shift in relations to Nature amongst the rural population who made their living from agriculture and comprised such a large segment in society. As a result of the final wave of forced collectivisation which culminated in the early 1960s, the traditional peasant lifestyle effectively vanished from Hungary and with it the old bonds with the soil rapidly lost their significance. Consequently, the entire period between 1950 and 1970 was largely one of missed opportunities as far as environmental protection is concerned. Environmental legislation was introduced in 1961 and led to the formation of a National Environmental Protection Office, which took over the duties and jurisdiction of what had formerly been a National Environmental Protection Council operating under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture. Going into the 1970s, a slow change in attitudes was starting to become apparent – prompted not least by a number of natural disasters such as widespread flooding of the Tisza in 1970 – in that the country’s political and economic leaders were prepared to take more note of environmental issues than before, if not to full extent that was required.\n\nIn 1976 the earlier regulations on protection of the human environment were tightened, giving agencies more effective powers to intervene. The following year the authority of the existing bodies was transferred again to a newly created National Council for Protection of the Environment and Nature and a corresponding office. By the early 1980s education on environmental matters started to enter into the teaching curriculum and coordination of nature conservancy and environmental protection activities was raised to government level, culminating in the formation of a separate Ministry for Environmental Protection and Water Management in 1988. However, it has to be added that even during the 1980s environmental issues continued to be subordinated to economic and political considerations, and the financial resources that were diverted into this area never reached the sums that were either necessary or affordable, with the result that the quality of the environment for the country’s population carried on sliding.\n\nPublic awareness of environmental issues was catalysed particularly by the catastrophic scale of the radioactive pollution released from the atomic reactor accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine during April 1986, and further strengthened by the domestic civil protest movement which was sparked by Czechoslovak-Hungarian intergovernmental plans for construction of a massive dam and hydroelectricity generation plant on the Danube Bend between Nagymaros on the Hungarian bank and Gabçikovo on the Slovakian bank. Thus, the second half of this era, the period from 1970 to 1990, may be characterised as one in which protection of the environment came to be politically institutionalised but still at low levels of priority in the face of growing public concern over the issues that it involved.\n\nOne of the earliest documents of the attempts to mobilise alternative opinion on issues relating to the environment was a 1949 pamphlet entitled Régi Írás (Old Scripture), drafted by György Bulányi (1919-), a Piarist priest, on behalf of an activist circle calling itself the Bokor-Öko (Bush-Eco) Group, which laid much stress on the responsibility that is owed to future generations and the need for respect for Nature and protection of the environment. As society slowly gained room for manoeuvre with the weakening of the régime, a variety of other unofficial groups, organised independently of the state political hierarchy, began to emerge. An Inter-university Science Students’ Circle (Interuniversitas Tudományos Diákkör, or ITDK) was founded in 1981 and a Nature Protection Club amongst students at the Loránd Eötvös University of Budapest in 1983; an Association for the Protection of the Danube Countryside, also known as the Danube Circle, was formed 1984, and Budapest’s Technical University started up a Green Club in 1985. These initiatives were given a big boost by the European recognition paid to the Danube Circle by awarding it a Good Lifestyle Prize in 1985. These green pressure groups and the ecological issues that they raised assumed an important role in the domestic political argument that gathered pace during the latter half of the 1980s. The ever-widening social backing that was given to the protest movement against the Gabçikovo-Nagymaros dam finally induced the Hungarian government to suspend participation in the construction work during the summer of 1989. These various movements thus helped to lay the foundations for the environmental protection approaches that were subsequently followed in the period of civil democracy ushered in by the change in régime of 1989-90; on the other hand, they offered no comprehensive ideological critique of society nor any utopian model that went beyond the limits of conventional civil democratic arrangements.\n\nHungary’s natural environment did indeed undergo some major adverse changes during the socialist era as a result of the mounting burdens imposed by enroachments of the built environment. Conditions for sustaining wildlife suffered, with several thousands of native species coming under threat and some 40 plants and 53 animals recorded as becoming extinct. Alongside this, there was also a perceptible increase in health risks that can be traced back to environmental pollution. Land use for cultivation fluctuated but, overall, was in continuous decline, with the area of arable land withdrawn from cultivation doubling over the period between 1945 and 1990 as the farmed area declined from 7.4 million hectares (28,500 square miles) in 1950 to 6.1 million hectares (23,500 square miles) by 1990. Within that reduction there was also a change in the distribution of land use by the farming sector, with a fall in the area of arable land and, even more markedly, of land given over to vineyards and fruit farming but a greater proportion used for market gardening.\n\nWater demand both from the general public and from industry and agriculture rocketed after World War II, with total water consumption soaring from 3,000 million to 8,000 million cubic metres in just the two decades between 1970 and 1990. The total volume of communal and industrial waste water effluents likewise rose, from 300 million cubic metres in 1965 to 850 million cubic metres in 1990. The biggest consumers and polluters of water were the chemical industry and industrial users of electricity. Despite expanded capacity and the application of modern biological treatment processes, the country’s sewage disposal system was unable to keep pace with the growing burden, as a result of which the quality of natural freshwater sources steadily deteriorated over time. This significant build-up of ground water pollution was a consequence of a continued failure of the public sewerage system to keep up with the water supply network due to the relatively high costs of public utilities and the historically low level of investment on domestic infrastructure. According to national census statistics, around half the population of Hungary in 1990 was still living in dwellings that were not connected to sewage mains. Mining for lignite and bauxite in the mountain ranges of southern Transdanubia led to serious reductions in both the quantity and quality of the karst water sources which form an important part of the country’s drinking water reserves. More happily, a drastic decline in the water quality of Lake Balaton was largely checked through interventionist measures that were taken during the 1980s.\n\nOne downside of the spiralling increase in motor vehicle use in Hungary since the 1960s was a progressive worsening of air quality in towns, much of it related to the technologically backward and increasingly antiquated state of vehicles on the roads. Further major culprits were the big works of domestic heavy industrial and chemical concerns, which during the 1950s and ‘60s were in practice allowed free rein to pollute the environment unpenalised. From the early 1970s, plant and factories that caused air pollution were subject to a so-called ‘pollution charge’ and from 1975 could have progressive fines levied against them for pollution offences. Through structural changes in energy supply and gradual modernisation of plant that had been releasing the greatest amounts of pollutants, the peak general levels of emissions reached during the 1960s gradually abated during the following decade. Due to industrial concentration, however, air quality continued to worsen in the region around the city of Miskolc, central Transdanubia and the Budapest metropolitan agglomeration, so that by the end of the 1980s some 44 per cent of the Hungarian population were living in areas of slight to moderate air pollution.\n\nRelatively outdated production technologies also contributed to the growing problems that Hungary began to experience with waste disposal in general and safe storage of dangerous wastes in particular. By the late 1980s the amount of domestic and municipal refuse generated annually per head of the population exceeded 200 kg. The Hungarian economy, too, largely through inefficient and careless methods of operating, produced large amounts of waste in relation to its performance. In the early 1980s, production of every US$1 million of GDP generated a conspicuously high level of 2,509 tons of industrial waste. Despite severe sanctions introduced at that time, instances of environmental pollution, usually through incorrect storage of materials, remained common throughout the 1980s.\n\nAlmost the sole encouraging trends in the whole era were increases in the area of park land available to urban populations and the amount of land under forestry management. The proportion of the total area of Hungarian territory given over to forest rose from 16.6 per cent in 1975 to 18.1 per cent in 1989, whilst parkland area expanded from 10.7 to 16.0 square metres per capita. The setting aside of designated areas of the countryside especially rich in features of natural interest for enhanced protection began in Hungary with the creation of the first national nature reserve on the Hortobágy in 1973. By the end of the decade some 600 sites of various sizes, with a total area of 380,000 hectares (1,500 square miles), had been given protected status.\n\nLiving conditions and material culture: from minimum subsistence to pseudo-consumerism\n\nIncomes, household consumption and consumer culture\n\nHungary’s per capita national income in 1938 amounted to US$120, which was then 60 per cent of the European average. World War II brought a reduction in national income, which only recovered to the pre-war level in 1949; thereafter it fluctuated quite considerably during the 1950s, though on an overall rising trend, as compared with the 1949 level, which persisted through to the early ‘70s. Despite the forced pace of economic growth, the development gap between Hungary and the more advanced economies of the West did not diminish; indeed, as a result of the bungled Hungarian response to the OPEC-induced oil price crisis of 1973, the late ‘70s ushered in a renewed period of recession. when it became clear that the régime’s chosen path of attempting to prop up living standards and economic growth through foreign credits was unsustainable. The restrictive policies that were adopted during the 1980s having brought no perceptible improvement, the collapse of the Comecon market in the early ‘90s represented a further crippling blow, as a result of which gross domestic product dropped back by around one-fifth in relation to its level at the end of the ‘80s.\n\nDeclining living standards for three consecutive years at the start of the ‘50s had reduced the value of wages in real terms by 20 per cent at the end of 1952 as compared with the beginning of 1950. Anxiety about earning a basic subsistence became a chronic, everyday preoccupation as much of the population, most notably the peasantry, were saddled with virtually unbearable demands for payment of taxes and compulsory deliveries of produce. The share of national income that was allocated to investment – much of it, directly or indirectly, for military purposes – was pushed up to 30 per cent, almost entirely at the cost of living standards of the populace at large. The new phase proclaimed in mid-1953, in the wake of Stalin’s death, when Rákosi and his chief henchmen temporarily lost their grip on power with the appointment of Imre Nagy as Hungarian prime minister, saw a resumption of growth in people’s incomes and consumption, from the low levels to which they had been depressed, up till the middle of 1956. National income for the latter half of that year slumped by 11 per cent, and with that, of course, indices of consumption too, as a consequence of the revolutionary upheaval from late October onwards; despite that, both incomes and consumption were 31 per cent higher in real terms at the end of 1956 than they had been in 1938. As against the almost total subordination of personal consumption to the goals of industrial development that marked the period before 1956, the engineering of sustained rises in living standards was to be the linchpin of the policies pursued by the Kádár government. The two decades from 1957 to 1978 were a period of significant and continuous improvement in material living conditions for the Hungarian population. Disposable incomes more than doubled in real terms, overall per capita consumption increased by more than two-and-a-half times, purchases of consumer articles more than ten-fold, and household energy consumption three-and-a-half times over.\n\nA turning-point came at the end of the 1970s, when a policy of restraining income growth through inflation was introduced in an attempt to restore balance to an economy that had been drifting increasingly off course. For broad segments of the population this was felt most directly in a steady moderate decline in the real value of wages of on average 0.6-0.8 per cent annually over the period 1979-1987, which many were able to make up for by working for the newly formed business cooperatives (gazdasági munkaközösség, or GMK) or moonlighting in the ‘second economy’. The period from 1988 to 1995, however, was one of much sharper declines in wages, averaging 3.0-3.3 per cent annually, as a result of which the real value of an average wage in 1995 had fallen to just 73 per cent of that in 1978. The fall in living standards was general; losses could be avoided or contained only by those who were able to supplement their incomes rather substantially through additional work or access to capital that was obtained through connections or had been laid aside in better times.\n\nThe process of half-hearted modernisation referred to in an earlier section naturally had its counterpart in a major change in material living conditions. Taking 1950 as the baseline (=100), the index of per capita incomes in real terms rose to 375, that of per capita consumption to 344, and the index of weekly wage rates to 216. The general aim that governments in this era had set of levelling out large disparities in wealth and income in society largely miscarried. True, the income differences of 2.6- to 2.8-fold which had held between white-collar and manual workers’ incomes were narrowed to just 1.3- to 1.5-fold from the beginning of the 1950s, but at the same time pay differentials that were linked to qualifications were also reduced, and it was precisely the more highly skilled, and hence better paid, workers whose earning potential was most severely limited. Income relativities were further distorted by the practice of paying out various allowances and supplements to all who were in employment, regardless of performance. They were also influenced by fact that under the price-setting system of that era goods and services were sometimes priced at levels far below their real value or actual cost in order to help those on lower incomes. Thus income inequalities were, overall, narrowed between 1948 and 1970, though equality of the kind that ideology called for never arose. Then, from the early 1970s onwards, income disparities between different groups in society progressively widened, largely through the workings of the second economy.\n\nThe material betterment that was attained in the socialist era was achieved only through extraordinary effort on the part of the population. Whilst the working week for men as well as women in their official main occupation did become shorter between the 1960s and 1980s, more time was spent, particularly by men, on small-scale private agricultural production and on jobs in the unofficial second economy. This reflected a clear-cut change in the strategies followed by the population from the early 1960s onwards as families increasingly availed themselves of the expanding opportunities to acquire supplemental incomes. In the first half of the 1970s some 80 per cent of rural households – 5.2 million people in all, or half of the total population – had access to a domestic plot or complementary farm strips through the cooperative farm to which they were associated. These privately farmed lands amounted to some 14 per cent of the total land under cultivation and accounted for 30 per cent of the country’s agricultural output. This was only achieved at the cost of long hours of work on the private plot: typically, men put in 1.5-2.5 hours daily, women 0.5-2.5 hours daily, over and above the time spent doing their regular job, whilst pensioners would work some 4.5 hours daily. Since tasks that were particularly labour intensive tended to be left for the weekend, time was rarely left for entertainment or self-improvement even then.\n\nThe factor that lured people to these additional shifts of work on strips of land they could farm for themselves was shortages. Given the relatively rudimentary nature of Hungary’s commercial infrastructure and the poor standard of the produce it supplied to the populace at large, the privately farmed plots in the villages not only ensured that rural families could meet their own basic food requirements, but the supplementary income that could be generated from selling off their limited surplus produce had an important role in securing a livelihood and improving family finances. With capital not readily available, the only economic tool that individuals could exploit was their own labour, and since little of the surplus earnings that this generated could not be reinvested readily (or at all) in production, the profit deriving from work on the domestic plot was usually translated into higher consumption.\n\nThe lean times of the immediate post-war years did not come to an end with the initial period of consolidation but persisted right up to the mid-1960s. Domestic food consumption may have regained pre-war levels by 1950, but continuity of supplies was erratic and the choice of produce on offer was unsatisfactory, principally as a result of the irrational war economy that characterised the period following the Communist take-over of power. The characteristic weakness that was to dog the country’s socialist command economy throughout its existence, albeit to a decreasing extent during the 1980s, was shortages of goods. By the 1970s such shortages were no longer being seen in basic foodstuffs and clothing but in a chronic under-supply of more valuable modern consumer goods; they were nonetheless one of the factors that influenced ways of thinking and behavioural patterns in society.\n\nA conspicuous increase in food consumption got under way in Hungary in the early 1960s, reaching its peak, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in the late ‘80s, when annual per capita consumption of meat exceeded 80 kg and that of milk and milk products was close to 190 kg. This continued emphasis on high-calorie dietary items was, in part, a legacy of historical traditions, and although changes in dietary habits were starting to accelerate in the latter half of the 1980s, modern concepts of nutrition made only partial headway.\n\nConsumption patterns evolved steadily over the era as the selection of consumer goods expanded. A further indication of the changing quality of life was the widespread availability of electric power, which did not occur until the period immediately after 1948: whereas just one-quarter on Hungarian households had such a supply in 1941, electricity was being used in three-quarters of households by 1960 and over 90 per cent by 1990. With this came big changes in the ownership of domestic appliances, the ‘60s and ‘70s being the period when most Hungarian households acquired their first washing machine and separate spin-drier, trading these up later on for programmable, integrated washing-drying machines. Home entertainment devices – at first record-players and tape-recorders then gradually, from the 1980s, hi-fi music centres – likewise became common acquisitions.\n\nThe decade 1945-56 was a convoluted and unsettled period for the availability of goods, but by 1950 average consumption in the Hungarian population had reached and even surpassed by 8 per cent, the level it had been at in the last pre-war year. One index of the growth in material well-being during the ensuing period of consolidation under Kádár, however, is that the proportion of the national wealth held by households in the form of consumer durables rose almost two-and-a-half times between 1960 and 1974, from Ft. 73,300 million to Ft. 180,000 million.\n\nHouseholds were also altering in size and structure, with the average family becoming smaller with a falling birth-rate and fewer households comprising more than a single family. In rural as well as urban communities, the older model of the multi-generational extended family household was supplanted by that of the neolocal nuclear family as it was increasingly accepted that newly married couples would set up their own household independently of either set of parents. On top of this, the ‘50s and ‘60s saw a growing incidence of heterogamous marriages, with men and women of different social status becoming partners, as a result of which, by the mid-’70s, close to half of families with more than one person active in the workforce were of mixed social class.\n\nThe 1960s and ‘70s were a period of big changes in living conditions and standards of life for substantial numbers of rural families, not the least important aspect of which was their development of successful strategies – intensive cultivation of the household plot and entering into heterogamous marriages, amongst others – to adapt to the new circumstances. Undoubtedly these placed village dwellers under considerable strain, but they did at least provide them with a means of social advancement – even, at times, against the express intentions of the régime.\n\nIn post-war Hungary the household gained a key role as a labour unit in the operation of the economy. Going into the 1970s, Hungarian households began to show an increasingly distinct wish to lighten the load of domestic chores, to take advantage of modern appliances and have recourse to paid services. The amount of the family budget that was spent on upkeep and running the household more than doubled between the 1950s and ‘70s, whilst spending on private transport rose tenfold between 1955 and 1975. There were also major shifts in the pattern of expenditures on consumer durables. Up until the mid-’50s this was dominated by purchases of furniture, heating stoves, traditional kitchen ranges, bicycles, motorbikes, and radios, but by the early ‘60s electrical appliances (washing machines, spin dryers, refrigerators and televisions) came to the fore, and from the early 1970s the motor car.\n\nThe rapid spread of car ownership and use to become a mass phenomenon, despite the continual rise in maintenance costs, had a marked impact on lifestyles, facilitating not only daily commuting to work but also, where suitable means of conveyance were lacking, the transport to market and sale of produce from people’s domestic farm plots. The total number of motor cars registered in Hungary was just 13,054 in 1950 but reached 238,563 in 1970, 1,013,412 in 1980 and 1,944,553 by 1990. The growth in ownership – a reflection not just of changing lifestyles but also of the great attention that the conciliatory policies nurtured by the Kádár régime gave to rising standards of living – was extremely slow right up to the mid-’60s, averaging just 20,000 cars per year, but this then picked up pace to around 80,000 cars per year by the mid-’70s, a level which sustained throughout the ‘80s. In 1985 around half of the total number of cars in Hungary were owned by Budapest residents. Car ownership was, of course, an important status symbol from the start but became even more significant towards the end of the ‘80s and into the ‘90s as the model of car owned was seen as a key expression of the owner’s social position.\n\nSignificant town-country differences can be noted in household spending patterns. During the 1960s and ‘70s costs of services and public transport played a much smaller part in the budgets of villagers than in urban households, but private transport costs were higher. On the other hand, domestic appliances were generally less in evidence in rural than in town dwellings, part of this difference being explicable by the higher priority that village residents placed on acquiring implements needed for their private farming enterprises than on general household articles. Furthermore, only very gradually did rural families give up consuming their own food produce in favour of shop purchases or eating outside the home, though the latter trends did start to pick up during the 1980s.\n\nIn the early ‘60s, the average Hungarian housewife spent four times longer on household chores than the average man. This was principally a consequence of women’s persisting traditional role but also of the fact that the phenomenon of women in full-time employment had still not become general in society at that time. The total time devoted to housework did not drop during the ‘70s, though men started to assume a greater portion of the burden. Saturdays became the main time during the week for attending to such chores, especially once most workers had been freed from the remnants of the six-day working week in the early ‘80s.\n\nThe 1960s and ‘70s were, in general, the period of greatest changes in lifestyle in Hungary during the second half of the twentieth century. After the dire shortages of the ‘50s, food became the principal item of consumption in the ‘60s, to be succeeded by home furnishings and durable goods in the ‘70s. Driving this process was a strengthening of the second economy, which fuelled a fairly sharp increase in the population’s disposable incomes. Accordingly the earlier part of the Kádár era has often been referred to as the period of ‘goulash communism’, the latter part as that of ‘refrigerator socialism’.\n\nThose who moved from the country to the towns during this period were changing not only their place of residence but also their entire way of life. Many chose to leave behind old belongings and furnish their dwellings according to the norms of their new surroundings. A big wave of replacing personal belongings then swept through the villages too during the ‘70s, with those who had constructed modern ‘box houses’ for themselves likewise dispensing with most of their old furniture and appliances. The conflict between hanging on to traditions and desire for innovation was symbolised in many of the newly built village houses by the fact that they still had a room which retained, even if only partially, the function of the ‘clean room’ of old.\n\nAs compared with the earlier decades of socialism, the 1970s were a time when demand for personal, decorative and, to some extent, social status-enhancing belongings could be satisfied. Despite the scant supplies of such luxuries and the hurdles that stood in the way of acquiring them, the bulk of the population felt free to shape their private environs to their own taste, to create a sense of prosperity, to eat, drink and buy goods or property (typically, a plot of land, weekend chalet, motor car) over and above what mere subsistence demanded. It is fascinating to keep track of this process as articles that were still regarded as luxury status symbols in the 1970s, whether brand-mark bottles of spirits or gift articles, became the ordinary, everyday objects of homes of the ‘80s.\n\nIn town dwellings earlier ideas about the function of furniture as signals of one’s position in society tended to assume less importance during the 1950s and ‘60s. When it came to furnishing their homes, most people simply followed the example of others who shared much the same position and style of life as themselves: \"Within a framework of state socialism, people strove to furnish their personal space, as befits the citizens of twentieth-century consumer society, in a manner that was consumerism-centred and driven by the pleasure principle and emotion. The model of the home that they adopted was not the puritanical, utilitarian, thrifty home of the bourgeoisie but the goods-accumulating model of modern consumer society\" (S. Nagy, 1997). This changing attitude to home furnishings is also a sign of a more general transition that cultural traditions and customs were undergoing in Hungary during this period. As watching television spread in society, the television set tended to be placed in a central spot in the home. This concentration on the private sphere of life was symptomatic of a general desire to identify with the consumer societies of western Europe. The singularity of Hungarian homes, however, remained the small number of rooms in the average dwelling, giving little scope either for separation of different family activities or the personal spaces that are such a fundamental part of modern home life elsewhere. Only since the late ‘80s has opportunity arisen for fundamental change here.\n\nDress\n\nThe process of discarding traditional dress amongst the rural population, which had started in the early years of the twentieth century, rapidly culminated after World War II as the use of traditional folk apparel for everyday wear ceased during the 1960s and factory-made items completely took over the place of home-made garments. More often than not, the catalysts for the change in dress were that segment of a village’s inhabitants – generally the poorest – who had been forced to look for work outside the community and thus not only became acquainted with the clothing fashions of other areas but tended to respond most readily to them. Selection of the appropriate everyday clothes continued to be determined by pragmatic considerations. Rural women gave up their multiple-skirted dress for whatever items of urban clothing happened to be fashionable at the time – a switch that generally also required them to learn a new body posture and carriage. With the switch-over, anyone still dressing in traditional costume during the ‘60s came to be regarded as a stick-in-the-mud.\n\nThe shift had been sparked originally at least as much by the equivocal political line towards peasants pursued by pre-war governments as to changes in the circumstances in which they lived and worked, but now changes in lifestyle and the large-scale movement of rural women into full-time employment were the primary reasons: \"The disintegration of peasant culture by then had become irreversible. In the 1960s the rural populace did not merely wish to abandon the outward appearance of being peasants but undertook en masse to leave the ranks of the peasantry altogether, with all that such mobility implied\" (Fülemile, 1991). In 1960, 10.4 per cent of rural women found regular work in sectors of the economy outside agriculture, and by 1970 that proportion had already reached 40 per cent. Working outside the village, made possible by improved public transport, in itself required peasant clothing to be discarded. Adding to the pressures for change were the advertisements for non-traditional patterns of life that the mass media began to publish and broadcast from the late 1960s onwards. Forced collectivisation and inordinate industrialisation undercut the means of subsistence for the very middle peasant stratum who had acted as the mainstays of tradition and so, with that check no longer in place, and being unable to pick and choose amongst the flood of innovations with which they were assailed what was worth incorporating into their traditions and what should be rejected, the old village communities fell apart.\n\nUp till 1949 Hungary’s town-dwellers did their best to keep up with quickly shifting fashion trends. An important role in spreading these fell to women’s magazines, such as Asszonyok (Ladies), which appeared between 1946 and 1949, and its immediate successor, Nők Lapja (Women’s Own). The reviewer of a fashion show organised by the Hungarian Fashion Designers’ Trade Union in late 1947 was hinting at incipient changes in attitudes in writing that \"the working woman naturally requires other clothes in her everyday life than does the ‘decorative’ woman. It is the task... of modern fashion designers... to design attractive and practical clothes for millions upon millions of women which will serve the needs of those millions upon million of working women well on all occasions of life, home, work, sport and festivity\" (cited by Katalin Dózsa, 1991). After the turn of 1948, fashion salons, individuality and eye-catching beauty were no longer deemed necessary to the needs of ‘working women’ as a period of uniformity in dress ensued in the name of a glorified puritanical work ethic. Every aspect of clothing (including, at times, the wearing of neckties) that was incompatible with the demands of practicality and utility was condemned as superfluous. In the 1950s the tyranny of overalls, loden coat and cloth cap or beret in men’s wear was briefly flouted only by the small proportion of young men who dared to adopt the ‘teddy boy’ look (drainpipe trousers, thick crepe-soled shoes) of their Anglo-American counterparts. The place of fashion-setting salons had meanwhile been taken, from 1950, by a Garment Trade Design Company (later renamed the Hungarian Fashion Institute), whilst the nascent Hungarian ready-to-wear industry attempted to dislodge the custom-made trade. Fashion shows were still mounted, if only because the ready-to-wear industry needed showcases to sell its wares, and perhaps it is only in retrospect that the portraits of Rákosi, Lenin and Stalin seen lowering over the catwalks in photographs of the time look not just odd but comical. Anyone who decided to go shopping after such a show, however, would have had to contend with relatively high prices, a meagre choice and the poor quality of the wares on offer.\n\nStraight-laced official attitudes only began to relax a notch after the mid-1950s, when expressions of a wish for femininity or individuality in dress were no longer regarded as political comments. After 1957 it again became possible for occasional reports to be published about the latest Paris collections, and by the ‘60s the main opponents of fashion fads were no longer so much politicians as the more conservative elements in society. The fashion subculture of jeans and long hair associated with rock and roll and beat music took a long time to win any sort of acceptance outside the ranks of its fans, though these and other expressions of difference did come to be tolerated by politicians and society at large as part of a more general shift in value systems reflecting the process of ‘half-hearted embourgeoisification’ which unfolded over the course of the 1970s.\n\nThe greater weight that consumerism assumed in the eyes of the Hungarian régime had a big impact on standards of dress and fashion alike. Though the domestic clothing industry found it hard to adapt to customers’ wishes in an economy ruled by shortages, it did gradually begin to make real efforts in this direction during the 1980s as the selection of goods was widened, jeans and other denim garments started to be manufactured in Hungary, and later on even production of ‘designer-label’ fashions was licensed in. Retail outlets and their stocks of wares became brighter, and even chains selling exclusive items of clothing (e.g. S-modell shops) made an appearance. By then the trade in the shops of Budapest’s most elegant shopping district, the area around Váci utca, was already substantial and rising continuously. The long queues outside the first shop in the country to sell Adidas leisure wear belied the generally deteriorating standards of life in Hungary at the end of the decade.\n\nValues and human relationships in everyday life\n\nIt is possible that the democratisation of the immediate post-war years might have allowed Hungarian society to come to terms with its role in that war and the events of the recent past. The imposition of Communist dictatorship in 1948-49, however, buried for a long time to come whatever chance there may have been for constructing a more mature sense of national identity by failing to tackle such issues as the ‘small nation’ mentality, as underlined once again by the 1947 Paris peace treaties, or society’s rejection of its Jewish population. Nevertheless, Hungarian society was to experience a series of major shifts in its value systems over the course of the decades that followed 1948, starting with the attempt to impose the values associated with Marxist doctrine. This was at its most intense in the period between 1948 and 1956, when collectivism was taken to extremes and debasement of national sentiments and violations of human rights were at their harshest. This enforced ‘modernisation’ served to reinforce processes of individualisation, atomisation and secularisation, ushering in a new era in which pre-war standards of behaviour had little place whereas the new norms promoted by the Communist power élite had the perverse effect of eliciting social disintegration.\n\nThe period following 1956 is divisible into two phases: the years up to the mid-1970s are best characterised as a phase of ideological neutralisation in society, whilst the ensuing decade and a half up to the change in régime was a phase of explicit rejection of Marxist ideology and the values that it exemplified. Whereas the holders of power in the early 1950s had demanded society’s unconditional acquiescence and total identification with and support for the goals they set, by the 1960s they were prepared to make do with the lesser demands of tacit acceptance and respect for certain ideological and historical taboos and for the prevailing political order. The watchword of this new line was the famous slogan coined by Kádár in 1962: \"Anyone not against us is on our side\".\n\nTeetering between renewed acceptance that people’s private lives were their own affair and formal alignment to the ‘expectations of socialist authority’, the depoliticised value system that had been established by the mid-1960s underwent little alteration until the end of the ‘70s, when overt dismissal of even that compromise began to spread and eventually reach the whole of society by the end of the ‘80s. The noteworthy aspect of this process is the ascendancy that was won for many individual values in Hungarian society under the conditions of the 1960s and ‘70s, and how relatively stable those values proved throughout the ‘80s. The principal explanation for this is to be sought in the régime’s increasing disinclination to impose its ideological stance on values and forms of behaviour that were linked to material well-being. Despite the manifest problems, the ‘60s and ‘70s were a period when the family regained a role of major importance in everyday life.\n\nThere may have been no essential change in the apparatus of power in Hungary after 1956, but the techniques that it utilised in exercising that power became progressively more refined. In sharp contrast to the practice of the Rákosi régime, the goal was no longer one of converting the populace to the cause at any price but merely one of winning its passive acceptance, and under this more pragmatic approach the way the past was assessed became one of the most central ideological issues: \"Dehistoricising [the past] is the most important tool of the depoliticising efforts undertaken in the process of consolidation. The new course is not looking for a new past... The political leadership is able to renounce that by ensuring that the political consciousness articulated by society as its image of the past is such that the very image of the past extinguishes itself\" (Miklós Szabó, 1988). The first step in the process was consignment of the 1956 revolution to oblivion, and society, with its awareness of defeat and personal involvement, was a partner to this. The upshot of this suppression was that \"the revolution of 1956, [however,] ostensibly failed to enter that area of Hungarian brains where the unfinished past has its rightful place\" (Z. Szabó, 1986), and so there was a void in the national consciousness precisely with regard to \"the political nexus which defined every aspect of the subsequent 25-30 years. Anyone lacking an awareness of ‘56 can have no awareness of the politics of those thirty years... The dehistoricising of ‘56 makes it impossible for society to form a true picture of its position\" (M. Szabó, 1988).\n\nThe régime prized economic development through technological progress and offered society the highly pragmatic vision of a future of unfettered access to an expanding world of material goods. This was coupled with the lure of a ‘career-minded’ society and the prospect of slow but sure, if not spectacular, advancement. Competition thus came to take the place of solidarity.\n\nAs the era passed, increasing store was set on human relationships, particularly those within the circle of close family, relatives and friends, and informal mutual-assistance networks were still cultivated, but contacts with anybody outside these sets of acquaintances were treated with a high degree of suspicion – not least because the political régime continued to resort to punitive measures, whether through disciplinary or criminal procedures, in its attempts to regulate the behaviour of members of society. This, in turn, impeded the evolution of codes of behaviour for initiating change from within society, norms that might encourage society to organise along self-reliant paths, or channels of contacts reaching beyond the purely private sphere that might be hard or impossible for the authorities to control. Nor should it be forgotten that it was in the very nature of the régime to foster a climate of mistrust because this put the members of society in a suitably vulnerable position where they could never be sure when those not closely linked to them might bring the apparatus of power into play against them.\n\nEconomic reform and the blossoming of a second economy from the late 1960s set in train significant attitudinal changes. Whilst the reforms were designed to improve the macro-conditions of everyday life, the spread of private small-scale farming prompted the emergence of new patterns of behaviour, survival strategies and ways of thinking. By the latter half of the 1970s, the private enterprise sector, whether legal or covert, came to occupy a key role in Hungarian society – and the values of diligence, talent, ingenuity and astuteness associated with it gained ground accordingly. From the end of the 1970s, the values of the private sphere started to play a part in the development of a growing sense of national identity, outside the régime’s control, one of the important features of which was the ‘rediscovery’ of the Hungarian ethnic minorities who were living in Hungary’s neighbour states. This duplication of value systems, attitudes and behavioural codes, with public kept separate from the private, was not entirely positive in its effects. It is also symptomatic that rates of deviant behaviours, such as suicide and alcoholism, climbed uninterruptedly in Hungary after the 1950s. Worsening mortality figures, with life expectation at birth for men actually dropping back from a peak of 67.5 years in 1966 to 65.1 years by 1985 whilst the increases that had been previously recorded for women moderated sharply from 72.2 years to 73.1 years over the same period, can likewise be seen as reflections of those deviant behaviours and the social price that was paid for modernisation during the post-1956 phase of consolidation. The finding of a 1988 survey that fully 15 per cent of the adult population could be classed as suffering from moderate to severe neurotic disease is another indication of the measure of the severe psychological stress – or ‘social maladaptation syndrome’ as it has been termed (Józan, 1988) – under which society laboured. With a mounting crisis in morals and values and a growing sense of alienation in society, the great bulk of the Hungarian population in the 1970s and ‘80s felt that they were unable to achieve what they wanted and that the course of their lives was not a function of their wishes but of the largely inscrutable intentions of the authorities; in short, their sense of servitude intensified.\n\nIn the early 1980s Communist ideology had become so discredited in Hungary that by the end of the decade it had lost altogether any residual social role it might have been playing earlier. Since nothing took its place, beyond a few general political principles, this left a distinct partial vacuum. From the end of the 1970s \"intellectual values came to dominate the rank ordering of instrumental values, sometimes outstripping ethical considerations, whilst at the same time they assumed an almost exclusive role in determining changes in the structure of the value system. Though a process of individualisation had already got under way, thanks to the Communist party, a sense of atomisation and strengthening intellectualisation persisted even after the collapse of the régime... Many signs point to 1990 being not only the grave of the old power group and system but also the cradle of a new, healthier society\" (Füstös & Szakolcai, 1994).\n\nMass culture, society and education\n\nThe cultural concept and ideal nurtured and disseminated by the socialist educational system and propaganda machine diverged strongly from the humanistic and democratic reflexes and national cultural ideals which typified the transient period of coalition government that preceded it. Some of the changes were purely formal, rather than substantial, and simply involved adding the attribute ‘socialist’ to the concepts that pertained to the subject; one could then speak only about socialist culture/education/literature/theatre/film, etc. The more significant changes, however, were the standardisation and reduction of content. This was where the political ideological elements of the day came to the fore, and anything that might have thrown even the slightest doubt on socialist dogma was removed from the cultural image and teaching curricula. An Institute for Popular Education was established in 1951 to lay out the scientific principles for adult education programmes. As a mark of the ‘socialist cultural revolution’, a network of ‘culture homes’ was set up, based on a previously existing set of institutions that had been administered by the Directorate for Free Education. There were already 433 of these operating in 1950, and over subsequent years most Hungarian villages acquired one of the new institutions of communal and cultural life. At its Second Congress in 1951, the Hungarian Workers’ Party (Magyar Dolgozók Pártja, or MDP), as the Communist party was then called, set itself the target of creating 2,500 ‘houses of culture’ by 1954. Though that date was not met, local councils and trades unions were running a total of 2,770 cultural centres of one kind or another in 1960 and 3,634 in 1971. These were the places that housed the libraries that took the place of the pre-war reading circles, where concerts and other cultural events would take place, where the public lectures organised under the ‘Free Earth Winter Evenings’ programmes of the early 1950s were held, and where local social gatherings, dances and even, from the ‘60s onwards, the grander village wedding parties would be held. Over the years there was a steady shift in their duties and activities away from the propaganda activities of the early ‘50s to a greater emphasis on general education, entertainment and a range of cultural services.\n\nOne sign of changing lifestyles was the scheduling of wedding parties to weekends and a continual shortening of their duration, which tended to mean the festivities were simplified to just eating, drinking, singing and dancing, with the games that had once been a customary part of the proceedings usually being dropped. The costs of a wedding were borne by both the groom’s and the bride’s family. The dowries brought into a marriage by both partners increased steadily during the post-war years and, from the 1960s onwards, so did the money-raising function of the ‘bride’s dance’, in which male guests pay for the privilege of dancing with the bride: whereas in the early ‘60s the bride’s dance might bring in Ft 2,000-5,000, that amount was some ten times higher by the mid-’70s and went on growing thereafter. Under political pressure, the marriage ceremony itself was increasingly confined to the obligator"
