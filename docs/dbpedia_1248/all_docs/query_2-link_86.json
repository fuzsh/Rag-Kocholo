        "text": "About the Event\n\nThe unique Hungarian folk singer, Ági Szalóki, performs at the Palace of Arts in Budapest.\n\nWhen we celebrate, we elevate a moment in time and separate the sacred from the everyday. We need to do this to be in harmony with the natural world, and with the cyclical natures of our human lives. In her concert, Ági Szalóki will draw from the rich repertoire of music associated with the Christmas holiday of European Christian culture to perform works of early music, as well as folk melodies that have survived through oral tradition. Ági Szalóki is a musician who is open and willing to experiment, and is an admirer and skilled vocal interpreter of the musical traditions of the Hungarian peasantry. She has invited guests to her concert who can perform Hungarian folk music, as well as the pearls of early music from the Hungarian Carpathian Basin and Western Europe, authentically and with great virtuosity.\n\n'In December, when we are longing for light and warmth in the Earth's northern hemisphere, it feels good to rest and to fall silent. We desire revival, the celebration of birth. It's still dark, but we know and believe that things will brighten.' (Ági Szalóki)"
