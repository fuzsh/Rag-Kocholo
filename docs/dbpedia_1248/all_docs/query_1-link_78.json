He won the 40th New Zealand National Concerto Competition, 2nd prize and the Best Classical Sonata Performance Award in the 2008 Kerikeri International Piano Competition, 1st prize in the Leó Weiner National Chamber Music Competition in Budapest, and is a multiple recipient of the Dame Malvina Major Foundation Arts Excellence Award. His debut album DIGRESSIONS on Rattle Records received critical acclaim, reaching No.1 on the New Zealand Classical Chart.\n\nAfter completing his Bachelor of Music in piano and composition with Péter Nagy and Gao Ping at Canterbury University in 2009, Tony moved to Europe where he completed his Master of Music and Soloist Diploma (Konzertexamen) with Distinction at the Hochschule für Musik in Freiburg, Germany. He also received mentoring from Balázs Szokolay and András Kemenes at the Liszt Academy in Budapest, and has benefited immensely from the mentorship of pianist Edith Fischer.\n\nTony received glowing reviews for his last 14-concert solo tour in New Zealand with CMNZ, where he also premiered Gao Ping’s piano suite “Daydreams”, composed for him. He performed with Michael Houstoun and the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra at the re-opening of the new post-earthquake Christchurch Town Hall.\n\nA passionate chamber musician, Tony works with various instruments and has performed with renowned groups such as the Quatuor Sine Nomine. He regularly performs in a cello-piano duo with his duo partner, Balázs Dolfin. Tony is a regular guest artist at the Semaine Internationale Piano & Musique de Chambre festival in Switzerland.
