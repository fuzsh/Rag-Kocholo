        "text": "Miklos Perenyi will be accompanied by Balazs Szokolay on the piano at the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation tomorrow\n\nTwo well-known musicians will perform in concert tomorrow at the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation. Hungarian cellist Miklos Perenyi will be accompanied by fellow countryman pianist Balazs Szokolay.\n\nBoth men with long musical careers share similarities.\n\nPerenyi was born in a family of musicians in Budapest. His parents recognised his musical talent and started his cello lessons at age 5. He trained under Miklos Zsamboki, who had been a pupil of the famous European performer and composer, David Popper.\n\nFour years later, in the early 1960s, Perenyi made his debut in Budapest, and began his solo career. During this time he studied under Ede Banda in Budapest and Enrico Mainardi in Rome.\n\nIn 1963 Perenyi won his first prize in the International Pablo Casals Competition in Budapest and at CasalsÂ’s invitation Perenyi continued his musical education in Puerto Rico and then in the late 1960s and early 1970s at the Marlboro Music Festival.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Perenyi began teaching at the Budapest Academy of Music where he is now a professor.\n\nLike Perenyi, Szokolay began learning to play music when he was 5 years. He went on to study at the Budapest Music Academy. He is a faculty at the Ferenc Liszt Academy in Budapest, where he has been for almost 20 years.\n\nThey have performed at prestigious locations around the world.\n\nAs a soloist and chamber musician Perenyi has delighted audiences in numerous music centres and at various international music festivals at Edinburgh, Salzburg, Vienna and Berlin, the Far East and the United States.\n\nHis repertoire includes works from the 17th century to the present day. He performs regularly in orchestral concerts, solo, duo and chamber recitals. Along with his concert activities and teaching, he composes pieces for smaller and larger chamber ensembles and for the cello.\n\nSzokolay has played around the world with many accomplished musicians including cellist Clemens Hagen, conductor Simon Rattle and clarinetist Gervaise de Peyer as well as performing on television and radio. In 2001 he was awarded the Liszt Award by the Hungarian Government.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Concert Committee in co-operation with the Cultural Foundation has organised the concert at the Cultural Foundation Theatre at 8pm tomorrow."
