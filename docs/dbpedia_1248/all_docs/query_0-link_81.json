In 2007, his career took a new turn when he began conducting certain projects for Les Arts Florissants.

Since then, she has been considered one of the most prominent pianists in the world, both in ability and popularity.\n\nDespite the fact that her character has often lead her towards the virtuosic masterworks of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Martha maintains an extensive repertoire, including but by no means limited to the works of Bach, Bartok, Beethoven, and Messiaen, as well as Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Debussy, Ravel, Franck, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, and Tchaikovsky.\n\nRegularly invited by the most prestigious orchestras, conductors and music festivals in Europe, Japan, America, and Israel (with Zubin Mehta and Lahav Shani), chamber music remains a significant part of her musical life.

His particular interest in French culture has been featured in concert programs and recordings dedicated to French music.\n\nHis operatic repertoire encompasses more than 100 operas with particular emphasis on the works of Mozart, Strauss, Wagner, Verdi, Puccini, Tchaikovsky, as well as those of 20th century composers such as Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Stravinsky, Berg and Samuel Barber. He has conducted extensively the Italian and French repertoire, collaborating with the most important singers of the last three decades.\n\nChristian Badea’s strong commitment to contemporary music has brought him in direct collaboration with many composers. Among them are Leonard Bernstein, Samuel Barber, Peter Mennin, Michael Tippett, George Crumb, John Corigliano, Christopher Rouse and Romanian composers such as Dan Dediu, Stefan Niculescu and Cornel Taranu, to name just a few.\n\nHis discography includes the Saint Saens Symphony no.3 with the Royal Philharmonic on the Telarc label, award winning recordings of symphonies of American composers Roger Sessions and Peter Mennin, as well as a live recording of Samuel Barber’s opera Antony and Cleopatra, which won a Grammy Award.\n\nChristian Badea has appeared frequently in the United States on nationally telecast performances. He was also featured in televised concerts and opera performances in Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, Austria and Japan and has conducted at festival venues in Florence, Vienna, Paris, Munich, Bucharest, Hong Kong and Verona. He was the Music Director of the Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds, in Italy and the USA, for a period of 10 years.\n\nHis career is marked by important collaborations with many of the major artists of our time, such as Leonard Bernstein, Mstislav Rostropovich, YoYo Ma, Yefim Bronfman, Shlomo Mintz, Midori, Cho Liang Lin, Mitsuko Uchida, Misha Maisky, singers such as Placido Domingo, Renee Fleming, Bryn Terfel, Natalie Dessay, Thomas Hampson and many stage directors, including Stefan Herheim, Bruce Beresford, David Pountney, John Cox, Werner Herzog, Andrei Serban and Keith Warner.\n\nChristian Badea received his initial training as a violinist at the Bucharest Conservatory of Music, followed by studies in Geneva and New York with Henryk Szeryng and Dorothy DeLay. He studied conducting in Brussels, at the Mozarteum in Salzburg with Herbert von Karajan and at the Juilliard School. One of his most important mentors in New York was Leonard Bernstein.\n\nSince 2012, Christian Badea is Principal Conductor of the “George Enescu” Philharmonic in Bucharest.\n\nIn the same year, he established the ROMANIAN FOUNDATION FOR EXCELLENCE IN MUSIC, dedicated to creating projects of the highest international artistic quality. Among these projects are the Sibiu – Hermannstadt International Music Festival, the project PARSIFAL AT THE ATHENAEUM – realized in partnership with the “George Enescu” Philharmonic and the Romanian Cultural Institute, the series of the Great Concerts of the Centenary of Romania, as well as collaborations with soloists such as Mischa Maisky and Khatia Buniatishvili.\n\nHis last appearance at the George Enescu Festival was in 2019 , when he conducted the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic with Vadim Repin as soloist.\n\nIn 1947, by decree of King Michael I of Romania, the “Banatul” Philharmonic was founded in Timișoara. The first Festive Concert took place on April 27, 1947, ten days after the actual founding act, and the conductor George Pavel presented the following program: Divertisment rustic (Dance and Wedding Song) by S. V. Drăgoi, Eight Russian Songs by A. K. Liadov and the Overture to the opera The Singing Masters by R. Wagner.\n\nThe first actual concert of the “Banatul” Philharmonic took place on June 8, 1947, with both the „Banatul” Philharmonic and the Philharmonic Society of Friends of Music on the bill. The guest artists were the pianist Monique de la Bruchollerie (France) and the conductor Charles Bruck who, although adopted by the city on the Seine, did not forget his roots in Banat.\n\nThe first season of proper concerts was inaugurated on 26 October 1947, following a series of numerous concerts whose programmes did not lack Romanian works, which reveals the importance that the Philharmonic gave to Romanian music from the beginning, assuming the quality of promoter of our culture and cultural identity. As testimony to the artistic activity of the first season of the Philharmonic is the article published on 24 May 1948 by Sabin V. Drăgoi in Luptătorul bănățean [The Banat Figher]: „The orchestra is in full evolution… Regular concerts… well attended, accessible to all through popular and not luxurious admission prices, this is how this soul food can creep into the broadest strata of the masses like a beneficial and recreational balm.”\n\nAmong the guest artists who have honoured the Timisoara audience since the beginnings of the newly established institution we mention the conductors: Constantin Bugeanu, Colonel Iosif Klein, László Somagyi, Traian Mihăilescu, Egizzio Masini, Alfred Mendelsohn, Constantin Sivestri; and the soloists – Elise Cserfalvy (violinist), Monique de la Bruchollerie (pianist), Ion Voicu (violinist), Miloš Sadlo (cellist), Ecaterina Vâlcovici (soprano), Radu Aldulescu (cellist).\n\nStarting with the next season, many well-known artists have been invited, together with the permanent conductors Mircea Popa and Paul Popescu. Constantin Sivestri and Egizzi Masini, who were also invited in the previous season, also took the podium, as well as Constantin Bobescu, Atanasie Margaritoff (Bulgaria), Theodor Rogalski, George Georgescu, Jean Bobescu, Edgar Cosma, Sergiu Celibidache, Mihai Brediceanu, Emanuel Elenescu, Nicolae Boboc, Mircea Basarab, Antonin Ciolan, Nicolae Brânzeu, Radu Botez.\n\nAmong the invited soloists we mention the pianists: Mândru Katz, Leo Freund, Ella Philipp, Grete Miletineanu, Jesette Hârsu, Xenia Moscu, Valentin Gheorghiu, Gheorghe Halmoș, Sylvia Șerbescu, Sanda Bobescu, Alexandru Demetriad, Corneliu Gheorghiu, Miron Șoarec, Dan Grigore, Elisabeth Leonskaja; violinists: Ion Voicu, Virgil Pop, Lucian Savin, Nicolae Drăgoi, Mihai Constantinescu, Ștefan Gheorghiu, Mircea Săulescu, Ștefan Ruha; cellists: Radu Aldulescu and Vladimir Orlov.\n\nIn the 2022-2023 season, the “Banatul” Philharmonic in Timișoara enjoyed the presence of conductors on stage: Gabriel Bebeșelea (Conductor-in-Residence of the Filarmonica Banatul Timișoara in 2023), Róbert Farkas (Principal Guest Conductor of the Filarmonica Banatul Timișoara), Stefan Geiger (Principal Guest Conductor of the Filarmonica Banatul Timișoara in the 2022-2023 season), Cristian Măcelaru (Principal Conductor of the WDR Sinfonieorchester Cologne, Artistic Director of the French National Orchestra, Artistic Director of the George Enescu International Festival), Sasha Goetzel, Ruben Gazarian, Radu Paponiu, David Crescenzi, Valentin Uryupin, Sander Teepens, Walter Hilgers, Huba Hollókői, Sergey Simakov, Dionysis Grammenos, Gheorghe Costin, as well as soloists: Andrei Ioniță (soloist in Residence of the Banat Philharmonic Timișoara for the year 2023 – European Capital of Culture), Wynton Marsalis, David Fray, Nicola Benedetti, Sarah Nemțanu, Alexander Boldakev, Rosanne Philippens, Szimon Nehring, Bryan Cheng, Máté Szücs, Alexandru Tomescu, Florin Iliescu, Ionuț Podgoreanu, Felicia Greciuc etc.\n\nHungarian violinist Kristóf Baráti is recognised increasingly across the globe as a musician of extraordinary quality with a vast expressive range and impeccable technique. Applauded repeatedly for the poetry and eloquence that he brings to his playing, he has been described as “a true tonal aesthete of the highest order”.\n\nIn recent seasons, Baráti has performed at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, at London’s Royal Festival Hall with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and in 2019 he was the featured soloist in the opening concert of the the Verbier Festival. Baráti has played with orchestras such as Zurich Tonhalle, Oslo Philharmonic, Orchestre National de France, ORF Vienna Radio Symphony, Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal, BBC Scottish Symphony, BBC Philharmonic and Hague Philharmonic orchestras. He performs regularly with Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra both in Russia and on tour around the world including in the US and China. Highlights of his 2020/21 season included performances with the Budapest Festival and Bern Symphony orchestras, and debuts with the Bavarian Radio Symphony and Israel Philharmonic orchestras amongst others.\n\nA regular recital and chamber music player, Baráti has performed with partners such as Mischa Maisky, Yuri Bashmet, Enrico Pace, Jean-Efflam Bavouzet, Zoltán Kocsis and Kim Kashkashian amongst others. He performs every year at the White Nights Festival and in 2019 made his debut at the Seattle Chamber Music and Aspen Festivals. In 2016 he made a sensational debut at the Verbier Festival when he performed the complete solo sonatas and partitas of Bach and has since been back every year.\n\nBaráti has an extensive discography which includes the five Mozart concerti, the complete Beethoven and Brahms sonatas with Klára Würtz, and Ysaÿe solo sonatas for Brilliant Classics, and Bach Sonatas and Partitas for Solo violin on the Berlin Classics label. Of his disc of encores ‘The Soul of Lady Harmsworth’ recorded in 2016, Gramophone magazine said “for those who like to hear the violin played at its sweet and acrobatic best, then Baráti is out of the top drawer.”\n\nHaving spent much of his childhood in Venezuela where he played as soloist with many of the country’s leading orchestras, Baráti returned to Budapest to study at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music and was later mentored by Eduard Wulfson, himself a student of Milstein and Menuhin. Still resident in Budapest, Baráti performs regularly across Hungary and together with István Várdai, he is Artistic Director of the Kaposvár International Chamber Music Festival. Baráti plays the 1703 “Lady Harmsworth” Stradivarius, by kind arrangement with the Stradivarius Society of Chicago.\n\nAward-winning pianist Jean-Efflam Bavouzet enjoys a prolific recording and international concert career. He regularly works with orchestras such as The Cleveland Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Philharmonic orchestras, and collaborates with conductors including Vladimir Jurowski, Gianandrea Noseda, François-Xavier Roth, Vasily Petrenko, Ludovic Morlot, Edward Gardner, Louis Langrée, and Sir Andrew Davis among others.\n\nHighlights of the 2022/23 season include Sydney Symphony, Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony, Prague Radio orchestras, Orchestre Philharmonique de Marseille, Budapest Festival Orchestra, and Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo.

He is the International Chair in Piano at the Royal Northern College of Music and an Advisory Board member of the Pianofest in the Hamptoms. In 2012 he was ICMA Artist of the Year and in 2008 he was awarded Beijing’s first ever Elite Prize for his Beethoven complete sonata series.\n\nThe Bayerisches Staatsorchester this year celebrates its 500th birthday, making it one of the oldest orchestras in the world, rich in tradition. As the in-house musicians of the Bayerische Staatsoper, they feel at home both in the orchestra pit and on stage. In 2022 it was voted Orchestra of the Year for the eighth consecutive year by opera critics in Opernwelt magazine. At the London Gramophone Awards, they took home both opera and orchestral awards for their performances of Die tote Stadt and The Snow Queen, as well as for Mahler’s Symphony No. 7 released on the Bayerische Staatsoper Recordings label – an unprecedented tally in the history of these awards.\n\nThe Bayerisches Staatsorchester began life as the Munich court orchestra. Its origins can be traced back to the year 1523. The ensemble’s first well-known director was Orlando di Lasso from 1563. While the focus of their artistic expression consisted initially of church music, as the 17th century progressed more mainstream concerts and opera performances were added to their repertoire. By the mid-18th century, operas were being performed more regularly and today constitute one of the orchestra’s principal responsibilities. The world premieres of Mozart’s La finta giardiniera (1775) and Idomeneo (1781) soon marked early milestones.\n\nIn 1811, the members of the court orchestra founded the Musical Academy which hosted Munich’s first ever public concert series, the academy concerts. Here, the Munich audience were introduced to musicians such as Clara Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Edvard Grieg. . Today, the Musical Academy continues to influence the musical life of the city and the state of Bavaria. Alongside the symphonic concerts at the Nationaltheater and a variety of chamber music series, the Academy is also home to the ATTACCA youth orchestra and the Hermann Levi Academy which are committed to supporting and training musicians at the start of their careers. Through the company Bayerisches Staatsorchester Konzert GmbH the Musical Academy organises and manages its orchestra tours and symphonic guest performances itself. These regularly take the orchestra to the music capitals of the Europe, including Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Milan, Paris, Vienna, Lucerne and London, as well as further afield to Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei and New York.\n\nAmong the many great composers with whom the orchestra has been affiliated, Richard Wagner stands apart. In 1865, Hans von Bülow conducted the world premiere of Tristan und Isolde at the Nationaltheater. Three further Wagner operas were also premiered in Munich: Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1868), Das Rheingold (1869) and Die Walküre (1870). Many of the most significant musical personalities of their time have fronted the orchestra as chief conductor: from Richard Strauss, Hermann Levi, Felix Mottl, Bruno Walter and Hans Knappertsbusch to Sir Georg Solti, Joseph Keilberth, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Zubin Mehta, Kent Nagano and Kirill Petrenko. The orchestra also enjoyed a close relationship with Carlos Kleiber. The 2021/22 season saw Vladimir Jurowski take the reins of the Bayerisches Staatsorchester as general music director.\n\nGabriel Bebeşelea is Principal Conductor of the “George Enescu” Philharmonic Orchestra in Bucharest and Artistic Director of the period instrument ensemble and festival Musica Ricercata.\n\nBebeşelea enjoys a vibrant international career, being guest of acclaimed ensembles such as the Rundfunk- Sinfonieorchester Berlin, Konzerthausorchester Berlin, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse, Orchestre Philharmonique de Marseille, Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, Orquesta Sinfónica de Castilla y León, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, the National Philharmonic Orchestra of Russia, the Tonkunstler Orchestra, the PKF-Prague Philharmonia, etc.\n\nSeason 2023/24 kicks off with appearances at the “George Enescu” Festival alongside Musica Ricercata and Lawrence Brownlee, and sees him conduct performances of Arnold Schoenberg’s monumental “Gurrelieder” and return to the Bochumer Symphoniker, Ulster Orchestra, the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra and the “Transylvania” State Philharmonic Orchestra, of which he was Principal Conductor between 2016 – 2023.\n\nA remarkable opera conductor, Bebeşelea was named Principal Conductor of the Romanian National Opera of Iaşi in 2011, becoming the youngest ever Principal Conductor in Romania. In 2015 he was named Principal Conductor of the National Romanian Opera House of Cluj-Napoca.\n\nIn recent seasons, he has led performances of Rimsky-Korsakov’s “The Tsar’s Bride” at the Perm Opera, Rossini’s “Il viaggio a Reims” at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, Francesco Cilea’s “Adriana Lecouvreur” at the National Opera House Timisoara (European Capital of Culture 2023) and a new production of “Manon Lescaut” at the Slovenian National Theater Maribor.\n\nGabriel Bebeșelea is known to devote himself to researching and rediscovering music and is responsible for uncovering several long forgotten or neglected musical masterpieces. In 2017, to bring such music to light, he founded the ensemble Musica Ricercata – an international artistic collective dedicated to the historically informed performance of music spanning from the baroque to modern eras, with an emphasis on early music.\n\nWith the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin, he recorded a CD featuring George Enescu’s rediscovered oratorio „Strigoii” (The Ghosts) and his “Pastorale – Fantaisie pour petite orchestre” (edition curated by Gabriel Bebeşelea).\n\nIn 2015, Gabriel Bebeşelea studied with two of the world’s most appreciated conductors: Bernard Haitink at the Lucerne Festival at Easter and with Kurt Masur at the Aurora Classical Festival. Bebeșelea was also mentored by Alberto Zedda at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro.\n\nIn 2011 he was awarded a scholarship consisting of an internship at the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam, where he had the possibility to assist at rehearsals and concerts with Mariss Jansons, Bernard Haitink, Herbert Blomstedt, Christoph von Dohnanyi, Philippe Herreweghe, David Zinman and Eliahu Inbal.\n\nBorn in 1987, Gabriel Bebeşelea is winner of the 1st prize of the “Lovro von Matačić” Conducting Competition (Zagreb 2015) and the 1st prize in the “Jeunesses Musicales” Conducting Competition (Bucharest 2011).\n\nIn 2018, Gabriel Bebeşelea obtained his PhD with “summa cum laude” at the National University of Music Bucharest.\n\nThroughout his career, Avi Avital has been drawn to collaboration with musicians across a wide spectrum of genres. This is a natural and logical result of his advocacy of the mandolin — itself an instrument whose ambiguous and flexible identity is at home in contexts as varied as the Italian Baroque, klezmer, folk and jazz. The vision underlying the Between Worlds project originated in connection with Avital’s 2014 release, Between Worlds, which considered examples of the links between folk and classical traditions in Europe, Central Asia, and the Americas.\n\nBetween Worlds embodied the initial phase of Avital’s ongoing quest to explore both the vitality of folk traditions and the ways in which these have shaped both cultural identity and the development of modern ideals of art music. “From the moment I conceived this project, I have felt it as a calling,” says the mandolinist. “I feel like my whole musical life has been leading up to this.”\n\nCelebrating the heritage of unique national musical styles associated with specific geographies is only one dimension of Avital’s ongoing project. A central impetus for his vision is to bring together unique configurations of contemporary performers who defy conventional borders and expectations by sharing their expertise in traditional, classical and popular styles. The vitality they generate from blending and conversing in multiple musical dialects opens ears and hearts to a more generous embrace of our shared humanity.\n\nAvital is in the process of curating six programs for his Between Worlds Ensemble (BWE) that home in on geographical regions, each of which is stamped with a distinctive cultural identity molded by multicultural exchange: the Iberian Peninsula, the Black Sea, and the Italian Peninsula are the topics for the three programmes they are presenting this season. The interplay of styles that will be explored will fascinate and thrill audiences of all ages.\n\nA different assortment of vocalists and instrumentalists joins with the BWE players in each programme to illustrate the living legacy of folk traditions at play. They interact with the ensemble to generate new musical hybrids, mirroring the process of classical composers from the past. But where the art music nourished by these sources has often become too familiar to surprise us, these fresh encounters with authentic exponents of the folk traditions, who will perform specially crafted new arrangements, promise to restore something of its innovative edge.\n\nThe BWE comprises ten musicians whose backgrounds are especially suited to this radical versatility, including the collaborations with a group of guest artists unique to each of the project’s programmes. At the core of the BWE is the mandolin — “an incredibly versatile instrument that is at home in almost any kind of music you put it to,” as Avital puts it. The mandolin “leads you to the most exciting discoveries, yet always stays true to itself. The sense of being at home in places that seem foreign, and even of discovering aspects of yourself there, is an idea that I find very moving. And that philosophy is at the heart of this project.”\n\nIn 1989, following extensive work with specialist ensembles including Les Musiciens du Louvre and The English Concert, Biondi founded Europa Galante, which quickly became the foremost Italian period ensemble. Biondi and his ensemble have forged a reputation for “fresh, vibrant performances” (New York Times) and breathe new life into Baroque, Classical and early Romantic repertoire, performing at leading international festivals and stages including recently the Berlin Pierre Boulez Saal, Elbphilharmonie Hamburg, Wiener Konzerthaus, Enescu Festival and Edinburgh International Festival.\n\nBiondi brings this authentic and engaging approach to modern symphony and chamber orchestras, which he both conducts and directs from the violin. Recent and future highlights include the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Hong Kong Philharmonic, Orchestra dell’Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, RAI Torino, NDR Radiophilharmonie, Frankfurt Radio Symphony, Finnish Radio Symphony, Mahler Chamber orchestras and the Mozarteumorchester Salzburg. He was Artistic Director for Baroque Music at the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra for eleven years until 2016.\n\nBiondi’s passion for opera takes him to major houses including Zurich Opera, Berlin’s Staatsoper unter den Linden and in 2020 to the Grand Théâtre de Genève for Luk Perceval’s new production of Mozart Die Entführung aus dem Serail. He was Music Director 2015–18 of Valencia’s Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, where he conducted productions of Donizetti, Rossini, Haydn and Verdi Il Corsaro.\n\nAs a violinist, he is respected as a virtuoso “beyond reproach” (The Guardian), performing in recital across the world including at Carnegie Hall, Wigmore Hall, Auditorio Nacional de Música Madrid and Cité de la Musique.\n\nHis broad discography on Warner Classics, Virgin and Glossa has earned Biondi numerous awards, including the Diapason d’Or de l’Année and Choc de Musique; his widely acclaimed recording with Europa Galante of Vivaldi Four Seasons was named Disc of the Year by organizations in over five countries; and he has recorded with Joyce DiDonato, Diana Damrau, Philippe Jaroussky, Vivica Genaux and Rolando Villazón. His recent recording of ‘Paganini Sonatas for Violin and Guitar’ was named Editor’s Choice by Gramophone and BBC Music Magazine.\n\nBiondi has been an academician of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia since 2011, he was named in 2015 an Officer of the National Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture, and in 2019 was awarded the medal of Courage and Veracity by the Polish Government, in recognition of outstanding cultural achievements.\n\nIn over 35 years of stage appearances, he has collaborated with most theatres in the country, as well as with philharmonics and operas, as an actor of the Comedy Theatre, then of the Bulandra Theatre where he still works today.\n\nHe has been invited by TV channels in children’s shows, entertainment shows, TV theatre, revealing his qualities as an actor-performer, mime, tap, singer. Playing several instruments, but also with his voice, the opportunities offered have been very diverse. He has performed in musicals, opera, operetta and numerous festivals and international festivals.\n\nHe has been invited to serve on various national and international juries.\n\nHe has acted in films since the early years of his theatre studies, both Romanian and international films, speaking several widely spoken languages: for example, the last film of the late Ion Popescu-Gopo (Maria and Mirabela in Tranzistoria – role of Scăpărici), but also in films with Malcolm McDowell, Michael Paré or Jean-Claude van Damme.\n\nWith outstanding vocal skills, he has dubbed countless films in Romanian, including characters such as Donkey from Shrek, Timon from Timon and Pumba or The Lion King, Mushu from Mulan or Paddington from the series of the same name, and then continued as a dubbing director or musical director. His voice is part of Radio Romania’s Golden Sound Archives, and over the years he has recorded numerous radio plays and entertainment shows.\n\nHis composing work includes music for theatre, film, but also original musical pieces that have been presented on various TV channels or can be found on YouTube.\n\nHe has taught singing and stage speaking techniques at the UNATC Theatre Faculty, holds master classes and workshops, such as the one at the Dan Iordăchescu Arts Festival. He has directed various shows, acted in musical and theatrical performances and children’s shows.\n\nFrench-born Alexandre Bloch assumed the position of Music Director of Orchestre National de Lille at the start of the 2016/17 season. From 2015 – 2021, Alexandre was also Principal Guest Conductor of Düsseldorfer Symphoniker.\n\nAlexandre leads a diverse and thrilling range of repertoire in Lille over the 2022/23 season, performing works in their main concert series by Britten, Bartok, Mahler and Berlioz among others, featuring internationally acclaimed soloists such as Isabelle Faust, Dame Sarah Connolly and Pierre-Laurent Aimard.

Work with Orchestre National de Lille has included many symphonic programmes, a critically acclaimed Mahler cycle, performances at the Festival de St Denis and at the Philharmonie de Paris, Stravinsky’s major ballet scores and commercial recordings. Earlier seasons have taken him to Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Orchestra of the National Centre for Performing Arts Beijing and Vancouver Symphony, Musikkollegium Winterthur, Royal Northern Sinfonia, BBC National Orchestra of Wales and a tour to Kuwait with London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nPast symphonic guest conducting has also included Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Orchestre National d’Ile-de-France, Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse, Orchestre National de Lyon, Orchestre National de France, the Nash Ensemble, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestra of Opera North, Norwegian Radio Orchestra, Oslo Philharmonic, Danish National Chamber Orchestra, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Orchestre Métropolitain (Montréal), Brussels Philharmonic, Ulster Orchestra, Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, Filharmonia Poznanska, Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Adelaide Symphony Orchestra and Australian Youth Orchestra.

Opera highlights also include Donizetti’s l’Elisir d’Amore at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein and Tosca at Opera de Lille.\n\nShortly after his Donatella Flick Competition success he made his debut with Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, replacing Mariss Jansons at short notice to conduct three performances of a challenging programme including Richard Strauss’ Tod und Verklärung and a Jörg Widmann commission for large orchestra. He was named one of “2012’s Talents” by the ADAMI (French Performing Right Society) and was a conducting fellow at the 2012 and 2013 Tanglewood Music Center Festival. He also drew the attention of conductors such as Mariss Jansons, Charles Dutoit, Pierre Boulez, Bernard Haitink, Sir Mark Elder and Esa-Pekka Salonen. Under Alexandre’s direction, the Orchestre National de Lille was named a finalist for the Gramophone Orchestra of the Year Award 2020.\n\nBorn in 1985, Alexandre first graduated with diplomas in cello performance, harmony and conducting from Tours, Orléans and Lille. He then entered the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris, to further his studies in composition and conducting. In 2012, he completed his Master’s Degree in Conducting in the studio of Zsolt Nagy, prior to gaining a Diploma and the Sir John Zochonis Junior Fellowship (2012/13 season) at the Royal Northern College of Music. Admired for his musicality, enthusiasm and energy, his First Prize at the 2012 Donatella Flick LSO Conducting Competition attracted international attention and brought him the opportunity to serve as Assistant Conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nEhrendirigent Gewandhausorchester Leipzig / Staatskapelle Dresden\n\n/ Bamberger Symphoniker\n\nConductor Laureate San Francisco Symphony\n\nHonorary Conductor Danish National Symphony Orchestra / Swedish\n\nRadio Symphony Orchestra\n\nHonorary Conductor Laureate NHK Symphony Orchestra\n\nNoble, charming, sober, modest. Such qualities may play a major role in human\n\ncoexistence and are certainly appreciated. However, they are rather atypical for\n\nextraordinary personalities such as conductors. Whatever the general public’s\n\nnotion of a conductor may be, Herbert Blomstedt is an exception, precisely because\n\nhe possesses those very qualities which seemingly have so little to do with a\n\nconductor’s claim to power. That he disproves the usual clichés in many respects\n\nshould certainly not lead to the assumption that he does not have the power to\n\nassert his clearly defined musical goals. Anyone who has attended Herbert\n\nBlomstedt’s rehearsals and experienced his concentration on the essence of the\n\nmusic, the precision in the phrasing of musical facts and circumstances as they\n\nappear in the score, the tenacity regarding the implementation of an aesthetic view,\n\nis likely to have been amazed at how few despotic measures were required to this\n\nend. Basically, Herbert Blomstedt has always represented that type of artist whose\n\nprofessional competence and natural authority make all external emphasis\n\nsuperfluous. His work as a conductor is inseparably linked to his religious and\n\nhuman ethos, and his interpretations combine great faithfulness to the score and\n\nanalytical precision, with a soulfulness that awakens the music to pulsating life.

Patricia Kopatchinskaja has been Artistic Partner of the ensemble since 2018.\n\nCAMERATA BERN plays repertoire stretching from baroque to contemporary, performing standing up and without conductor. The ensemble’s innovative programming combines different periods and styles and ranges from classical concert programs to staged concerts, chamber music projects, and children’s concerts.\n\nWith its own concert series in Bern and strong ties to the city, the ensemble also appears regularly at international festivals and at leading concert halls in Switzerland, in Europe, in North and South America, and in Asia. CAMERATA BERN performs with high-profile artists such as Antje Weithaas, Sergio Azzolini, Steven Isserlis, Ilya Gringolts, Anna Prohaska, or Kristian Bezuidenhout. Each season the ensemble selects a composer in residence, in 2022/23 the German composer Jan Dvořák.\n\nRecordings on CD and vinyl have won several international awards, such as the Grand Prix du Disque, the German Record Critics’ Award or the Echo Klassik. The two most recent CD releases, «Time and Eternity» with Patricia Kopatchinskaja and «Plaisirs illuminés» with Patricia Kopatchinskaja and Sol Gabetta and featuring a commissioned piece by Francisco Coll (Composer in Residence 2018/19), were both nominated for a Gramophone Award. «Plaisirs illuminés» was also awarded the BBC Music Magazine Award in 2022.\n\nCAMERATA BERN carries out significant work in music education for children, performing regular school concert tours in the Canton of Bern.

The subscription series of the CAMERATA in the great hall of the International Foundation Mozarteum is a pillar of Salzburg´s musical life.\n\nAt the center of the repertoire, in addition to the works of Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert, is of course the work of our genius loci Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
