        "text": "This is a position paper presented at the Carolina Graduate Literature Society's annual conference, 2016. In this short position paper I explore the complicated, reciprocal entanglements between notions of criminality, race, and genre through the vehicle of film history. I will present an analysis of certain social types generated by two genres: horror and vigilante films. In particular, I will argue that these genres portray criminal deviance and vigilante justice in ways heavily inflected by historically grounded archives heavily indebted to both psychoanalysis and white supremacy. The two genres on which I will focus had their heyday in the 1970’s, a historical moment very much defined by mainstream fears regarding social disorder, urban crisis, and crime. However, the two genres draw from different cultural archives, and indicate different yet intersecting ways in which Americans have imagined crime and justice in relation to race. In earlier horror films such as Psycho, criminal deviants are often portrayed as maladjusted Freudian subjects. In later cycles, they become sociopathic geniuses or supernatural slashers in films such as Silence of the Lambs or Nightmare on Elm Street. These films make emotional appeals to the nightmarish dangers lurking in the dark unconscious of mainstream suburban settings and white bourgeois life in particular. The vigilante film, on the other hand, implicitly locates texts such as Birth of a Nation in its archive, and caters to white fears of urban crime inflected by racialized undertones. Films such as Death Wish function to assuage an offended sense of white masculinity, patriarchal dominance, and middle class (in)security by letting loose upon a fundamentally immoral and depraved urban underworld. Ultimately, these generic formations cross-pollinate to generate innovations not only in American cinema, but throughout American culture. I will wrap up by pointing to the ways in which these generic figures exert enough power over the American imagination to generate excessive, unjust, and even deadly consequences in the context of American society and, in particular, the criminal justice system.\n\nAssuming a connection between violent periods and a violent pop culture, this article explores the present conjuncture of fear, horror and terror in American films and TV through comparison with matching themes in 1970s Hollywood cinema. Both the 1970s and 2000s can be categorised as“ages of fear, horror and terror”, shaped by political, social and economic crisis. Since 9/11 and the beginning of the War on Terror a new brand of explicitly violent horror movies has scored major box office hits. “Shoot ’em up”-scenarios and revenge thrillers feature prominently, as well as conspiracy and paranoia motives. In a similar way splatter horror and dark thrillers referred to the Vietnam War, political scandals and economic problems of the 1970s. Just as the then cultural products tell us: ‘There is something profoundly wrong with our world.’ Dark and nightmarish fantasies express anger and frustration about forces out of control, warlike events and estrangement between the public and elites. The conclusion is that real/reel violence and horror overlap/mirror each other.\n\nThis article examines the ways in which violent international horror films of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s – the kinds of films once banned as &#39;video nasties&#39; in Britain – have impacted on the creative directions of British film-makers today. Using three case studies, Creep (2004), The Last Horror Movie (2003) and The Devil&#39;s Chair (2007), I draw upon the significance that new British horror&#39;s violent spectacle may hold for the British cultural past and present, and consider how its graphic aesthetic correlates/conflicts with broader issues surrounding international horror cinema&#39;s production and reception. Acknowledging the recent American phenomenon of torture porn, I display how certain British film-makers, themselves fans of the genre, utilize their fan appreciation to recall significant international texts that have a historical weight that resonates with the social unease that followed the introduction of VHS into Thatcherite Britain. In doing so, I of...\n\nThe proliferation of North American horror films in the 21st century has engendered an increase in critical and academic response which has almost exclusively focused on the conventions of mainstream horror cinema. That is, films sanctioned by classificatory bodies, released through mid to large production companies and exhibited via selected to wide theatrical releases. While academic work, drawing from film and cultural studies, has provided a much needed engagement with the popularity and themes of contemporary U.S. horror they have tended to exclude marginal or ‘hidden’ horror film examples. Therefore, working from Antonio Lázaro-Reboll’s work on the ‘archaeology of horror’ put forward in The Spanish Horror Film (2012), this paper (which is part of a monograph on the subject) will similarly seek to “reintegrate marginal filmic and cultural practices” (p.7) into 21st century U.S. horror. Within the paper an account of the aesthetic and thematic strategies of the films will be provided which will work toward supplying a definition of the term hardcore horror. A number of filmic examples will be given (such as films by Fred Vogel, Shane Ryan and Lucifer Valentine) and areas such as production, marketing, and consumption will be addressed. The importance of looking at hardcore horror is that these films operate outside of normative filmmaking practice and in doing so provide a wider examination of the cultural field of U.S. horror in terms of how it is made and experienced. The paper will hope to provide a redefinition of the boundaries of the genre within the context of contemporary U.S. horror, so that overlooked horror films and their revisions and alterations of commercial production, marketing and consumption practices can be included. In turn, this will help to better understand the interface between filmmaker and audience (and scholar), especially when it comes to cultural representations of and experience toward horror.\n\nDespite its necessary centrality within the genre, the concept of the victim has not received much direct attention within the field of horror studies. Arguably, their presence is so ubiquitous as to become invisible— the threat of horror implies the need for a victim, whose function never alters, often becoming a blank slate for audiences to project their desires and fears onto. This volume seeks to make explicit the concept of the victim within horror media and to examine their position in more detail, demonstrating that the necessity of their appearance within the genre does not equate to a simplicity of definition. The chapters within this volume cover a number of topics and approaches, examining sources from literature, film, TV, and games (both analogue and digital) to show the pervasiveness of horror's victims, as well as the variety of their guises."
