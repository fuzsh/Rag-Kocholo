        "text": "How Film Noir Inspires My Art\n\nI am an artist. Artists take input and use it as grist to generate unique output.\n\nSo, I feel I must ask myself, why noir? Why do I feel myself drawn to this imagery?\n\nFilm Noir? Qu'est-ce que c'est?\n\nThe hey-day of this film genre is roughly the 1940’s and 50’s. But, the term \"Film Noir\" was coined by French film critics later, in the 1960’s. At the time, they were simply known as “crime pictures” inspired by American hardboiled crime fiction. They were largely “B” movies with a tight budget.\n\nThe term “noir” has since expanded to not just describe a moment in movie history, but to describe a sensibility, that can be infused into any form of expression.\n\nWhy Noir? Begin the Béguin\n\nHow did I start my film noir obsession?\n\nI was hooked.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Fatale 30x36 Collage on panel\n\nAt first, I created my art directly from screenshots of films. They were very altered, but from specific scenes. Gradually, the images kept getting more and more altered, until I started to create my own scenes.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Anticipate 16x20 Collage on panel\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Blue Room 40x40 Collage on panel\n\nNow, ideas emerge from multiple sources. I may be inspired from a film scene or photograph, or I may want to express something from my own imagination. The people I paint are slivers of my own soul, maybe even archetypes of our collective soul.\n\nThe scenes in my artwork are presented without irony and are imbued with an immediacy which invites the viewer to step into the scene as a contemporary moment. If we could walk through the picture frame and become part of the action. If this could be possible, what would you see, and who would be there?\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Miss Darger II 24x30 Acrylic on panel\n\nWhy Noir?\n\nStudying Film Noir Makes Me a Better Painter\n\nI have become better at marshaling the elements of design, such as value, arrangement, and scale. I believe these skills transcend any specific style and will translate to other subjects as my creative interests evolve.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Lamplight 40x48\n\nWhy Noir? The Art and Style of the Era\n\nAny artist will tell you, the key to artistic maturity is to discover one's own unique, consistent language. I seek to find a balance of representation and abstraction.\n\nModern Art, and design in the Modernist period dealt with this specifically.\n\nItalian travel poster, Mario Puppo, 1941\n\nItalian travel poster, Mario Puppo, 1948\n\nWhile experts say Modernism died with the onslaught of WWII, I think it was a part of the cultural zeitgeist well afterwards, especially in popular culture.\n\nBlind Minotaur Led through the Night by Girl with Fluttering Dove, Picasso, 1935\n\nMy style is evocative of the painting and graphic arts that were contemporary with the hey-day of film noir. So, not only do I learn from films noir directly, I also love the style of the era, and let this inform the way I choose to depict the subject.\n\nThe Little Fish, Max Beckmann, 1933\n\nCharles Sheeler, Canyons, 1951\n\nMuch like how I engage with the subject of film noir, I like to find the essence of what I am seeing and try to express it with forthright simplicity.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Glass Houses 30x28\n\nWhy Noir? The Femme Fatale\n\nPut them both together, and it becomes:\n\nFemme Fatale:⁠\n\n1. a seductive woman who lures men into dangerous or compromising situations⁠\n\n2. a woman who attracts men by an aura of charm and mystery⁠\n\nThe word “nemesis” is often used to refer to an arch enemy or polar opposite, or, as my friend Merriam-Webster sez, “a formidable and usually victorious rival or opponent”.\n\nBut if she is so evil, why do we love her so much?\n\nBe good, be patient, look pretty and maybe the prince will come and save you. I was taught that as a girl, it was the foundation of my world view and identity. I had no examples of powerful, non-domestic women in my life. Into this vacuum stepped the only example of feminine power available to me: the Femme Fatale.\n\nShe is trying to flip a bad situation to her advantage, perhaps turning the tables of power back on the men who use and control her. For me, the Femme Fatale is often infused with a tragic quality: a resourceful gal, just trying to make the best from a bad hand dealt.\n\nIn the course of my personal maturity, I am finding my way to a healthier embodiment of power. It has taken most of my adult life to build up some understanding of how to be an entrepreneur, which is essentially what a professional artist is.\n\nI’ve had a lot of catching up to do.\n\nBut all the while, I still rejoice in the cathartic glorification of my dark princess, the lost twin star, our nemesis, the Femme Fatale.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Boudoir II 40x48\n\nFor Extra Credit!\n\nA fabulous article: In Defense of Villainesses, by Sarah Gailey- so much fun!\n\nWhy Noir? The Antihero and The Homme Fatale\n\nHow many times have you said to yourself, \"this is a bad idea,\"- then went ahead and did it anyway?\n\nThis is the essence of the typical male protagonist in film noir. A guy who is presented with a choice, and even though it is a bad idea, he goes forward with his instincts, his craving, his desire, his compulsion, his desperate need, instead of what we know would be the right choice. He must live, or die, by that fateful decision.\n\nWe watch the drama unfold, unable to look away.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Backlight 38x48\n\nMen have their own particular burden to carry. They are supposed to do, to achieve, attain, and win. But the world does not have a level playing field. Additionally, he knows that when the going gets tough, he's the one who is expected to run into the fray, stare it down and fix it. But what if it is unfixable?\n\nThe strive to win against all odds is often what motivates Antihero- or the giving up is what fuels his self-destruction.\n\nThe Homme Fatale\n\nNot all Fatales are Femme.⁠ Any androsexual will tell you so.\n\nBut here we must ask the age-old question; is the catharsis we gain from art worth the messaging it perpetuates?\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp The Boxer 30x40\n\nWhy Noir? The Doomed Romance\n\nA long time ago, a wise friend counseled me, saying “Romance is about NOT being fulfilled, it’s about longing.”\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Vacancy 48x40\n\nThe characters in film noir practice a lot of bad behavior. They smoke and drink, lie, cheat, extort and manipulate.\n\nWhy Noir? It's Complicated\n\nWhen we are engrossed in a mystery novel, the complicated plot tangles we must unravel keep us entranced.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Pursuit 24x48\n\nThe characters in noir are caught in a web of intrigue and moral ambiguity. Their exploits involve daring and danger, plot twists and betrayals. They usually believe they can manipulate a situation to their advantage over another.\n\nThe dream I weave in my paintings is a version of myself who is, in a word: clever.\n\nLike getting into a good novel or movie, my paintings invite you to take time and decipher what is being presented.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Many a Moon 38x38\n\nWhy Noir? The Unusual Suspects\n\nWhy is Shakespeare still so popular after all this time? It's because his stories and characters are timeless. There have been countless versions of his plays where the settings and characters’ identities are changed to bring new interpretations to the story presented.\n\nThere are a profusion of examples of crime novels that star characters of many kinds, from the famous private eye Easy Rollins, to tough gay guy/investigator Dave Brandstetter.\n\n©lesliepetersonsapp Bars 16x20\n\nThe themes are universal and can be ascribed to any individual. So, I can change the outer identities of my characters, and it can still be noir.\n\nTo not follow these impulses would, in effect, be negating their existence.\n\nWhether I handle this successfully is a question I continually ask myself.\n\nThe adaptability of film noir characters allows me to enlarge the limits of my understanding and expression.\n\nWhy Noir? It's Fate, Baby.\n\nBeing an artist may look like fun, but it is tough.\n\nPutting yourself out there for others to see is perennially disquieting. In order to make it all worth it, the subject and method has to be captivating.\n\nIn the words of the Czar of Noir, Eddie Muller, film noir is \"suffering with style\"."
