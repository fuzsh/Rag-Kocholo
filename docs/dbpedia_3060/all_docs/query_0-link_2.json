        "text": "Going backwards in my decades experiment is occasionally strange, especially when you reach a decade like the 1960’s. Of course, we know that this is where a lot of changes in mainstream cinema — particularly Hollywood — happened, so pitting together these different eras can be a bit of an eye opening experience. Anyway, that’s cinema. Let’s focus on where everything else was for a second: television was becoming more widely accessible, music was reaching a contemporary status with rock and roll and pop, and the world was trying to unite via “peace” (despite the wars that were ongoing and would start). Let’s now return to my initial point: these other artistic mediums were either getting going, or were becoming something of a different nature. Film was old enough to be evolving into its next phase. Strange, right?\n\nNothing was more strange than these changes, either. An influx of waves (be it French, Japanese, Czech, or New Hollywood) were colliding together to make the biggest statements to the world. The styles of old (westerns, musicals) were trying to rush in their final says before revisionism destroyed them for good. Black and white was finally being replaced by colour — Technicolor, that is — once and for all. Of course, it’s obvious that this is the time when a lot was happening in cinematic history, but really smushing all of these titles together hits that point home. For a medium that was constantly shifting, film may not have had as much movement as it did in this point and time.\n\nIn 2020, 1960 is sixty years ago, which is also sixty years after 1900; around the time when film was being used to tell stories in a big enough capacity. In a linear sense, this is around the halfway point to where we are now. Does that justify all of the movement that happened? Whatever does, all I know is that this decade is truly one of a kind for film. I keep saying this, but now I can officially confirm this (since I’ve begun my work already on the ‘50s, ‘40s and other remaining decades): the 1960’s are by far and beyond the most difficult decade to rank, and that likely won’t be changing now. I love the idea of ending this year off with the most challenging list I’ve had to make up until this point, because it feels like my biggest accomplishment in accumulating all of cinema’s finest works. Either way, I did my very best; I could have gone to two hundred, most likely. Here are the best one hundred films of the 1980’s.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven’t included documentaries, or any film that is considerably enough of a documentary (mockumentaries don’t count). I haven’t forgotten about films like Warrendale or Don’t Look Back. I’m keeping them in mind for later (wink wink).\n\nBe sure to check out my other Best 100 lists of every decade here.\n\n47. L’Eclisse\n\nBeing the worst part of a hypothetical trilogy and showing up this high on a list isn't so bad. Michelangelo Antonioni had a hell of a decade even outside of this triptych, but it’s how well L’Avventura, La Notte, and L’Eclisse work together that resonate the most of his golden period. L’Eclisse takes the concept of a lunar eclipse and applies it to romances (how someone can overshadow a loved one and steal their light). In typical Antonioni fashion, the film is invested in the time spent with another more than just delivering a plot, so moments gestate a little bit more organically. Once we're given a dilemma to solve, we can only have our own solution before L’Eclisse hands over its own, reminding you that it was always going to do what it wanted anyway. As a statement on uncontrollable love, L’Eclisse is a unique final say in a trilogy full of new approaches to how adoration can be achieved in cinema.\n\n1. Persona\n\nThe ‘60s saw many directors who were uncomfortable in their seats and needed to reposition themselves. Waves crashed up against the foundations of the old. Filmmakers rebelled against their contemporaries, their nations, and even cinema itself. Then, there was Ingmar Bergman: a director who didn’t want to live if he didn’t hit a turning point in the ‘50s and finally begin succeeding as a filmmaker. He caught that stride, and released dramas and dramedies that helped push foreign films into a new area of respect, along other directors like Kurosawa and Godard. Then, out of nowhere, and not really for any rhyme or reason, Bergman sought to completely obliterate the very medium he couldn't live without doing. Persona is a mainstream (enough) release that distances viewers so greatly from their viewing material; it’s like an experimental filmmaker was given the money that popular directors usually earn.\n\nWhy would Bergman want to push his audience away? He always fought with his faith, not knowing if he was an atheist or conflicted with the religion of his homeland in Sweden. It’s like he wanted to mimic his relationship with his priest father, the Christianity of his nation, and himself. So, Persona exists but only barely; like an incomplete formation of a film that isn’t really a film. It begins with unrelated images meant to catch you off guard (the slaughtering of a lamb, a crucifixion, a morgue), before pretending to create the narrative of a nurse taking care of an actress who has lost her voice. They retreat to an island to gather their thoughts, but their thoughts only drift away. It’s sometime around this point that Persona literally breaks; its physical self snaps in half, and the projector burns through the film. Persona concludes the very way it began; the image of said projector concluding what it had begun. With fourth walls broken, narratives destroyed, and the film as a literal object ruined, Persona is self destructive in every sense of the word.\n\nBergman’s creation hardly exists as a fully formed story; who is real, and who isn’t? Is any of this real? However, it shines as a postmodern masterpiece that many — ranging from Altman to Lynch — have tried to replicate ever since. It’s ironic that one of the finest films ever made is barely even comfortable as a film. Oddly enough, Bergman would go back to more straightforward works, aside from the films that would flirt with the unusual occasionally. Never before or after did he become completely uninhibited like Persona again; his artistic struggle to break apart the art he spent many years devoted to learn. In a decade that exhibited many groundbreakers and deviations from the norm, no one came close to Persona (not even Bergman himself): the greatest film of the 1960’s."
