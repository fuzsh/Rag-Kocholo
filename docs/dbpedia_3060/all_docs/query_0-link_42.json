        "text": "Page 42 →Chapter 2 The Dog\n\n(Rajo to kenjū, Ankokugai no bijo, Kagenaki koe, Kaikyō chi ni somete, Kutabare gurentai, Tokyo kishitai, Subete ga kurutteru, Akutarō, Toge wo wataru wakai kaze, Akutarō-den: warui hoshi shita demo)\n\nBetween 1959 and 1960, three Assistant Directors at Shōchiku studios—Ōshima Nagisa, Shinoda Masahiro, and Yoshida Yoshishige—made their respective directorial debuts. Although Suzuki Seitarō had been an A.D. at Shōchiku far senior to these three, no one in 1960 within Japan’s filmmaking or critical establishment would have considered that he belonged to the same aesthetic universe as the nuberu bagu. Few critics were aware that Suzuki existed, except perhaps as a screen credit on Nikkatsu’s B-pictures.1 By comparison, Ōshima was already a prominent film critic who received widespread acclaim for his second film (Seishun zankoku monogatari/Cruel Story of Youth, 1960); the early films of Yoshida and Shinoda received lavish attention in film magazines such as Kinema junpō as Japan’s answer to the already legendary directors of the French nouvelle vague, Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. Following the tremendous success of Nikkatsu’s taiyōzoku “Sun Tribe” films, which signified to the industry that many Japanese cinemagoers were ready to embrace “the new,” Shōchiku’s publicity machine assured that the nuberu bagu directors would be empowered as “instant auteurs” with public and cultural cachet;2 although, as Ōshima was soon to discover, this empowerment, and the backing of the studios, had its limits.\n\nAt the same time, Suzuki toiled through low-budget crime films and pop song films (kayō eiga) with second-rate Nikkatsu stars, each film serving as the lower half of a double feature at Nikkatsu theatres. Suzuki’s Page 43 →career was being outpaced, even by younger Nikkatsu directors such as Imamura Shōhei, who commanded media prestige and high budgets, much to Suzuki’s eventual resentment. Imamura’s films were viewed, then and now, as a kind of Nikkatsu cohort of the nuberu bagu; a consideration never yet granted to Suzuki’s films. The Nihon University-educated Kurahara Koreyoshi was another example. Another former Shōchiku A.D., Kurahara became a top-ranking director after only his first film, the impressive Ishihara vehicle Ore wa matteiru ze/I am Waiting (1957).3 For more than 30 years, Suzuki and the self-consciously Godardian Kurahara shared the same editor, Suzuki Akira, with the two directors reacting competitively to each other’s work through this essential intermediary. “Maybe Kurahara uses too much film,” judged Suzuki.4\n\nIt took until 1963, seven years after he started as director, for a tiny subset of critics to recognize the director of Yajū no seishun as a figure of aesthetic interest. In 1970, Satō Tadao established the orthodox view that Suzuki had made only “routine job assignments” in the 1950s.5 At that time, Satō had little means of reviewing those early films. I would argue, in contrast, that Suzuki’s “hard-boiled” B movies of the 1950s are among the studio’s most significant and transformative genre films. At first imitative of American thrillers, their transnational stylistic and cultural hybridity enabled the young director to take occasional risks with film narration and form that were unheard of in the studio cinema of the 1950s; they pioneered a distinctive use of jump cuts, problematized the cinematic gaze through visual allegories of the mediation of the camera, and utilized eccentric widescreen framing as a sort of hyper-textual commentary on filmmaking practice. I will argue, further, that experiments with color, even in Suzuki’s innocuous pop song films, represent a break with classical filmmaking of an equally profound conceptual significance as the early films of the nuberu bagu. In the conclusion of this chapter, I will also discuss how in 1960 Suzuki made at least one film related to the taiyōzoku cycle. Subete ga kurutteru/Everything Goes Crazy explored the youth-oriented social realism that was associated with Kurahara and Imamura’s films, to which it is a kind of riposte, being as audacious in form and as dissenting in its view of Japanese society (c. 1960) as the contemporary nuberu bagu films on the subject.\n\nYet despite this essentially realist and discursive “social problem” film, the films of Suzuki as a whole had long since demonstrated an alternative mode of self-reflexive filmmaking practice, evidencing a deep inquiry into the phenomenology and image-politics of the erotic and violent representations that had made these genre films so indispensable to the public. Page 44 →This reflexivity pulled Suzuki away from the (stylized) social realism of Subete ga kurutteru towards a “generic-ironic” practice; that is, one which reinvests in the discursive potential of cinematic spectacle in genre films by bending it, haltingly, towards a critique of the same mass culture and media establishment that produced these very films: that very establishment within which the director, by his own account, had found himself unappreciated, isolated, and trapped.\n\nHard-Boiled Wonderland\n\nBetween 1957 and 1958, a distinct formal practice emerged from Suzuki’s imitation of the hard-boiled crime films of his mentor at Nikkatsu, Noguchi Hiroshi.6 It is possible to illustrate the emergence of Suzuki’s “differential” style through a comparison of two early but notable hard-boiled thrillers that Suzuki made with the stars Mizushima Michitarō and Shiraki Mari: Rajo to kenjū/Nude Girl and a Gun (1957) and Ankokugai no bijo (1958).\n\nI want to justify my use of the term “hard-boiled” to mark some dozens of unsentimental, black-and-white Japanese crime films from the 1950s, chiefly, but not exclusively, from Nikkatsu. Even though Suzuki frequently used the equivalent Japanese term (hādo-boirudo) to describe his own crime films,7 my use of the term to describe this cycle of films from the mid-to late 1950s is not necessarily warranted by the critical vocabulary of the time. Rather, I am classifying a cycle of films that has never been properly recognized by Japanese film historians. Certainly, film magazines were using the term hādo-boirudo by 1960 to describe the generic affiliation of not only Suzuki’s films, but those of contemporaries such as Okamoto Kihachi,8 while Eiga hyōron compared Suzuki to the “hard-boiled” writer James Hadley Chase.9 The Nikkatsu historian Watanabe Takenobu classified the studio crime thrillers starring Shishido Jō from 1963–1967 as a hādo-boirudo cycle, but did not give a name to the earlier 1950s crime films dominated by Noguchi. Critics often referred to the early crime films of a number of different studios as gangu mono (gangster subjects), but the term is too general and somewhat misleading.10 Crime thrillers of the 1950s conspicuously did not attempt to represent the culture of the yakuza gangs (no doubt for fear of causing offence). Thus I prefer, throughout this book, to use hādo-boirudo as the best historical term available to describe this cycle of films. Despite terminological confusion, this is a significant body of at least thirty studio films, produced under the influence of a wave of American popular literaturePage 45 → and media exported to Japan throughout the decade, and producing an initially imitative, then dynamic and evolving cycle.\n\nThe hard-boiled literary movement in America has a well-defined time and place of origin. Despite its long roots in “sensationalized American pulp fiction addressed chiefly to working-class men,”11 hard-boiled fiction came into the world in 1923 through the writings of Dashiell Hammett and Black Mask Magazine under the editorship of Jack “Captain” Shaw. One of the major qualities which differentiated Hammett from the gentlemanly detective fiction which came before him was the terse, vernacular, quasi-objective diction that Hammett adapted from the quasi-modernist style of H.L. Mencken. Originally, the term “hard-boiled” focused exclusively on the tough character of the urban private detective. The twin emphasis of this literature, then, was on the detective himself and on the journey of investigation into society’s hidden corners. As the decades progressed, “hard-boiled” came into a broader usage and denoted a larger variety of crime thriller scenarios.12 In the 1940s, Raymond Chandler could speak in a very general sense about Hollywood crime melodramas when he wrote that “people can take the hard-boiled stuff nowadays.”13 It was this more encompassing use of the term that some Japanese critics would adapt, as hādo-boirudo, to describe the vigorous crime literature (and the occasional film) coming out of post-war Tokyo.14\n\nFrom 1950 to 1955, an influx of translations of American crime stories descended on the Japanese reading public, alongside the films of Humphrey Bogart and other stars of iconic status in Japan. With thirty years of American literary developments introduced in one wave, the prewar writings of Hammett, Chandler, and Cain appeared at the same time as, and sometimes later than, the pulp fictions of younger authors like Ross MacDonald and Mickey Spillane. This had several consequences. Since simultaneity of exposure emphasized similarities more than distinctions, hard-boiled fiction appeared to Japanese readers as a more compressed and consistent movement or genre.15 The term “hard-boiled” thus denoted for Japanese readers a characteristically American and contemporary literary mode and a wide collection of narrative topoi concerning urban crime and violence.\n\nThe effect on Japanese crime and detection literature was tremendous. Younger writers in the mid-1950s such as Ōyabu Haruhiko and Kōjō Kō met with instant commercial success adapting hard-boiled American prose (and its violent criminal brutality) to a Japanese idiom in novels like Ōyabu’s Yajū shisu beshi/The Beast Must Die (1958).16 It was inevitable that Japanese studios would cash in on this trend. It was arguably Kurosawa Page 46 →who produced the first examples of “hard-boiled” films in Japan, Yoidore tenshi/Drunken Angel (Tōhō, 1948) and Nora inu/Stray Dog (1949).17 The great backlog of 1940s American crime films released throughout Japan’s post-war period, the very same films which French critics had called films noir Americain,18 had clearly established a taste for a recognizably similar Japanese product. And the rise of the double feature in Japan, which made Suzuki’s career as a B-movie auteur possible, had established a viable market for this kind of film.19\n\nThus, directors of the mid-1950s, like Noguchi at Nikkatsu and Okamoto Kihachi and Makino Masahiro at Tōei, were soon followed by younger cohorts such as Sugawa Eizō at Tōhō and Ishii Teruo at Shin-Tōhō, who assembled films that showed this hybrid influence of American hard-boiled literature, film noir, the Japanese hādo-boirudo fiction discussed above, and established, indigenous thriller writers such as Matsumoto Seichō. This transnational hybridity is not a theoretical construct; it is overt and self-conscious in the films themselves: Suzuki’s Rajo to kenjū begins with a cabaret act in which the femme fatale, a dancer, wears an American cowboy hat and boots (Fig. 2.1) while shooting six guns from a holster.\n\nMost of the iconography of the American films noir of the 1940s and 50s are consciously represented in these Japanese “translations” of the genre: scenes of low-key lighting, expressive uses of shadows, tawdry night club acts with alluring singers, guns, trench coats, brutal psychotics, torture, and professional criminals in hidden, tangled networks.\n\nIt is not surprising that this trend took root particularly at Nikkatsu, which produced the majority of these thrillers. The studio had acted as a successful importer of American crime films, among others, for nearly ten years before venturing back into film production in 1954. Noguchi’s Ore no kenjū wa subayai, Nikkatsu’s earliest thriller, began the trend, and over the next two years crime thrillers replaced low-budget chanbara as the studio’s characteristic product. Chitei no uta/Song of the Underworld (1956) was one of Noguchi’s best films, and Suzuki joined the trend with his third effort Akuma no machi/Demon Town (1956)—a film so obscure, despite the presence of actor Kawazu Seizaburō, that it appears to never have been re-released in any form (unless it were at the private “Ciné-clubs” of the late 1960s). At its height of popularity, the cycle included even vehicles for Ishihara Yūjirō such as Masuda Toshio’s Sabita naifu/Rusty Knife (1958).\n\nIt is Noguchi’s iteration of the formula that most concerns us here. Suzuki’s hard-boiled films were no doubt influenced by his own reading and viewing of the American hard-boiled mode,20 and it is worth noting the American hard-boiled influence on many other renowned Japanese Page 47 →artists, including Abe Kōbō and (later) Murakami Haruki. Nevertheless, a number of local and culturally specific features of Suzuki’s early films can be traced back directly to his mentor, Noguchi. The latter was a reliable studio filmmaker who rarely departed from the stylistic norms of classical filmmaking. As a crime film innovator, nevertheless, Noguchi effortlessly adapted the seedy milieu of American urban thrillers to Tokyo in the midst of a long post-war reconstruction that often served the demands of industry over population. Noguchi depicts, in muted tones, a post-industrial cityscape of empty, somewhat alienated modern structures. He used spare yet modern interiors that made the milieu, rather than the film, look cheap.\n\nIn some ways a comic filmmaker, Noguchi takes a tongue-in-cheek notice of 1950s consumerism, and would often cut away from a scene prematurely, though not disruptively, in order to make a character or situation look absurd.\n\nFor the most part, however, his style is as muted as the low-key cabaret acts in his underworld nightclubs. This is a legitimate aesthetic choice, a hard-boiled universe in fact, and Noguchi deserves to be better known for it. But Suzuki, who used cabaret scenes for gaudy and outrageous spectacle, took the opposite course, pushing the boundaries of taste and narrative credulity.\n\nThis is evident in Suzuki’s baroque fourth film, Rajo to kenjū (1957), which strikingly anticipates Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958) as the story of an innocent man manipulated by two women (played by the same actress, Mari Shiraki) who may or may not be the same. It is also a stylistic manifesto that makes a significant use of jump cuts two years before Godard was credited with revolutionizing the cinema for doing the same in À bout de souffle/Breathless (1960). Suzuki’s film is an unpredictable mix of rather generic policier conventions and erotic titillation, as reviewers were quick to point out.21 But it also exhibits dynamic stylistic deformations that Page 48 →anticipate the revision of hard-boiled material in the much later films of the nouvelle vague such as Tirez sur la Pianiste (1962).\n\nThe inventiveness of the opening sequence is palpable, a tour-de-force of confusion, artifice, and eroticism. It begins with the meta-textual “cowboy cabaret” number mentioned above. As the strip artist fires off her imitation six-guns, a glass breaks on a table, suggesting that a real shot has been fired. In the ensuing montage of countenances, confused movement, and running feet, the film refuses to establish who shot who, but an innocent photographer (Mizushima Michitarō, Nikkatsu’s answer to Bogart) soon finds himself on the street, being lured into the dancer’s apartment.\n\nPage 49 →As the girl strips to her underwear, Mizushima whips out his camera and starts to photograph her. Soon, the girl is “play-modeling” for Mizushima, posing erotically up against the brick wall of her apartment. A medium shot captures Shiraki, gazing erotically into the camera, which is angled sharply to the left.\n\nSuddenly, a jump cut frames Shiraki in close-up, from a frontal angle, as she is creating a different pose, whipping her head and long hair from the bottom to the top of the frame.\n\nRegardless of whether anyone in the Suzuki-gumi had seen and remembered a similarly voyeuristic jump cut on Rita Hayworth in Orson Welles’ pathbreaking, baroque, critically reviled Lady from Shanghai (1947),22 the inevitably self-reflexive context in which it is used here allows Rajo to kenjū’s jump cut to depart entirely from the diegesis of this narrative film, Page 50 →momentarily, to become a photomontage, a moving magazine. It artfully depicts a social milieu of commercialized eroticism and subjectivity: the model who lives for the camera. To throw a further cog into the diegesis, this “photomontage” occurs while the protagonist is not, so far as the viewer can tell, using his camera, but gazing directly at Shiraki. The temporal and diegetic status of the image becomes completely indeterminate, appearing as a pure bravura imposition of directorial style. It is a sign of things to come.\n\nThe jump cut appears only twice in this film, however, and the style of Rajo to kenjū from this point on is both confident and largely conventional. Apart from a certain tendency to avoid shot-reverse shot patterns,23 the framing, editing, stock music, and even the location views of the stereotypically “bustling” city are unremarkable and perfectly typical of the genre. There are exceptions: on one occasion the femme fatale looks into the black slate cover of her posh record player and sees there a superimposed view of the protagonist as he drives his car. This view of the character has not occurred in the narrative prior: it is not precisely a flashback, but a sort of “re-created” vision.24 Although these flamboyant touches, upon consideration, seem to challenge any reductive understanding of narrative time in the cinema, at this stage of Suzuki’s career they are infrequent and not terribly disruptive of the hegemony of classical film form.\n\nOn the narrative level, a number of clichés are executed with seeming earnestness. Instead of focusing on the anxieties of a man who has been framed for murder, the film represents a police force bending over backwards to help him prove his innocence. This typically white-washed celebration of the Tokyo Metropolitan police is utterly reactionary for a director who would later (as early as Kagenaki koe, 1958) depict the manipulative police, and all other aggregates of institutional power, as dreadful.\n\nOther genre elements, however, are fresh and surprising: in a fight scene between the gangsters and the hero, the latter improbably passes off the flash pan of his camera as a gun. This is another emphasis, like the “cowboy cabaret,” on the fanciful “make-believe” that characterizes the whole of this scenario. Other such touches include a villain (Sugai Ichirō) absurdly made to resemble V.I. Lenin, a fight scene executed as pure farce, with both sides scurrying around without the slightest agility or courage, and a hero deftly portrayed by Mizushima as the ultimate everyman, devoid of any special heroic or romantic qualities until the disappointingly conventional finale.\n\nDespite a formidable performance from Shiraki Mari, the characterization of the femme fatale (or non-characterization, as her identity remains Page 51 →unfixed) tends towards the Hollywood idiom by which, as Janey Place writes, “we observe both the social [agency] of myth which damns the sexual woman and all who become enmeshed by her, and a particularly potent stylistic presentation of the sexual strength of woman which man fears.”25 Constantly undressed, Shiraki is a pure male projection of seductive availability. Correspondingly, the film comes across at times as an extended advert for a new style of ladies’ underwear and bra; after Kinema junpō fumed that the film’s “transparent commercialism is disgusting,” the director seems to have responded, in some sense, in Ankokugai no bijo by featuring young men in ladies’ underwear at a frivolous dance party. In the typical fashion of both Japanese melodrama and American film noir, the femme fatale must die, though not before bombing her villainous ex-lover. In doing so, one could say that Shiraki’s “gusto” all-too-briefly allows the Japanese femme fatale to inhabit the mythic territory of the ancient female shaman and her uncanny superiority over men. It is a territory much-explored in Suzuki’s later films, yet here it is effectively reined in by narrative economy, by genre, by thematic focus, by modern patriarchy in itself.\n\nGiven her seductive wiles and the exploitative nature of the picture, it is remarkable that the protagonist passes up every chance of making love to Shiraki. Here is the film’s satirical sting: given a script that largely reproduces the sexual politics of American and Japanese hard-boiled thrillers, the resulting film places a baroque over-emphasis on voyeurism. On two occasions, the hero gazes at the silhouette of Shiraki as she strips behind an opaque window (a window, moreover, that opens onto a public landing).\n\nLater, on the justification of “collecting evidence” for the police, the hero sets his camera on an adjacent rooftop and takes pictures of the heroine as she showers nude. As in Rear Window (1954), voyeurism has replaced any and all desire for sexual contact. Perhaps this should be taken as symptomatic of a post-war crisis of masculinity, or perhaps the voyeurism of the middle-aged hero, in full cooperation with the police, connotes a prewar patriarchal order in its surveillance and control of femininity. The scene features a number of extreme close-ups on Mizushima’s camera that emphasize what normative Hollywood cinema, through techniques such as eyeline matching, aims to conceal: that the notorious male gaze of the cinema, the gaze of mastery, is conditional upon its filmic mediation. Mizushima’s camera stands for the film camera and makes a critical point to which Suzuki’s films will obsessively return: the gaze should not function in the vacuum of a diegesis. That is to say, the film rejects what would be considered a normative use of the male gaze in the narrative cinema,Page 52 → an example of which might be a male and female character gazing at one another, their respective POVs captured by over-the-shoulder reverse shots which allow the actors to avoid looking directly into the camera (a potential disruption). Suzuki’s films evidently object to this attempt to conceal the mediation of the camera, and resort to often non-diegetic means to reinstate it. The viewers must be made aware of mediation, which creates (and effectively replaces) the male gaze just as surely as its object—like the silhouette of the nude femme fatale in the window—is a fantasy on a screen, a cinematic shadow.\n\nAppearing six months later, Ankokugai no bijo/Underworld Beauty (1958) inhabits the same narrative and stylistic idiom as its predecessor. It demonstrates a fuller command of classical studio narration, and yet is determined to manifest its own textual difference. The largely conventional visual schema of Rajo to kenjū is replaced here by the spectacular use of what Hasumi has called the “previously neglected [visual] details” of genre.26 In one instance, a gunfight is portrayed by means of an empty, darkened, opulent stairway, punctuated by enchanting bursts of gunpowder. In another, the audience views a mannequin made up to look like the heroine and containing a diamond in its breast. But now the mannequin is twisted apart, with the limbs and clumps of the breast torn off, and half sunk in the slime of a dank and abject sewer where the protagonist has dumped it. The shot is magnificently eerie and full of foreboding, expressive of desires so abject that they can only be expressed by simulacra, and only in passing.\n\nFor Hasumi, this hypostatization of the generic and the conventional is the authorial signature of a Suzuki film. But already in Ankokugai nobijo, Page 53 → as Eric Crosby has shown, we see evidence of a more radical bifurcation between textual intentionality (the agency at work “behind” the film text) and the dominant stylistic norms of studio cinema. Grappling creatively with its designation as one of the first “NikkatsuScope” films and with the problems of CinemaScope composition, it managed to introduce a highly differential style of framing.\n\nAfter demonstrating that Japanese studios necessarily adapted their widescreen compositional strategies from Hollywood, who created and exported the technology, Crosby analyzes the director’s penchant for “unbalanced” compositions utilizing extreme edge-framing, extreme foreground and multi-planar staging, and the “obtrusive” use of tracking shots to introduce new characters and information.27 Crosby recognizes these as departures from demonstrable stylistic norms:\n\nSurely, Suzuki could have avoided such compositional awkwardness, but the crucial point here is that he understands the convention, employs it, and. . . . frequently . . . takes this one step further by creating an expectation for compositional payoff . . . then ultimately subvert[ing] it.28\n\nCrosby seems uncertain as to whether Suzuki’s “flamboyant devices” serve a function related to “the articulation of narrative information and character psychology,” or whether a fine line has been crossed between “articulation” and disruption: “in other instances, such compositional imbalances will seem to have no function other than the purely decorative. . . . We hope for some . . . significant narrative information but we are Page 54 →thwarted as often as . . . satisfied.”29 Yet I cannot improve upon Crosby’s concluding description of the director’s early aesthetics: “Suzuki’s early widescreen cinema seems to abide selectively by American norms while also highlighting the arbitrariness of their functions.”30 Alongside a mastery of accepted convention, these films develop a reflexive critique of the same. Their differential compositions suggest alternative cinematic potentialities but also carry a negative critical force in pointing to the “arbitrary” studio reliance on one set of norms. This is not only in relation to framing. Ankokugai no bijo includes a similar deformation of narrative time involving a montage of gazes of gangsters reacting to the arrival of a hero who does not in fact enter the door until a later shot.\n\nThe sexual politics of the film, rather than problematizing male voyeurism as before, depict the hard-boiled urban milieu as a quasi-surrealist fantasia of polymorphic perversity. The figure of the store mannequin is the iconic, narrative, and ideological center of the film.31 The plot involves a hero (Mizushima) who contends not only with the cold, repressed sadism of the yakuza, but also the heroine’s boyfriend, a perverted sculptor of mannequins who is obsessed with human anatomy. Only this sculptor can retrieve stolen diamonds by dissecting the stomach of a corpse of a man who swallowed them, and he does so—accompanied by the eerie sound of twinkling bells on the soundtrack—with an expression resembling surprised ecstasy. In this hard-boiled myth of Pygmalion, both hero and perverse sculptor want to “mold” the rebellious heroine (a defiant performance by Shiraki that escapes all containment), but while the sculptor is an isolated predator resembling Peter Lorre’s M (1931), the patriarchal hero carries the full weight of institutionalized masculine prerogative. Small wonder that the film ends with a shot of a birdcage, suggesting the heroine’s entrapment in stifling domesticity with the injured hero.\n\nAlong the way, the viewer sees nude mannequins displayed at every stage of their production, from eerie shelves of detached heads with lewd expressions to fully formed figures with what appears to be artificial pubic hair (Fig. 2.9). At one point the workers on the factory floor begin to fondle their mannequins sexually.\n\nThe store mannequin is a double allegory, not only for male fetish, but for the post-war consumerism that renders everything as fetish. With Nikkatsu B-pictures at this time flirting along the edge of exploitation (with partial female nudity, for instance),32 Suzuki takes the plastic fetishism of the crime thriller to an outrageous, and yet cleverly uncensorable, degree, producing a sophisticated reflection on the genre.\n\nReleased later in the year (1958), Kagenaki koe continued to showcase Page 55 →a technical proficiency of expressive technique, but, at the same time, seemed to “step outside” of the hard-boiled continuities and developments that we have noted across the prior two films. The hard-boiled tendency continues in Ankoku no ryoken and Kemono no nemuri, two films from 1960 that, despite sporadic formal highlights, suggest that Suzuki’s career was repeating itself. Although Kagenaki koe is, in my evaluation, a near masterpiece, it is also one of the few films by Suzuki whose formal and stylistic economy, impressive as it is, seems dominated by its textual antecedents. By this I mean to say that it is based on a story by Page 56 →the revered Matsumoto Seichyamanote “commuter rail” suburbs.\n\nKagenaki koe is thus the exception that proves the rule; but its handling of its material is striking and distinctive in all departments—from Nagatsuka’s low-key stylization to an unforgettably thuggish supporting performance by Shishido Jō. Indeed, Kagenaki koe has some profound connection to later films such as Koroshi no rakuin, which turned to surrealism, rather than expressionism, for inspiration. Most notable is a roughly tripartite structure that is not at all the cumulative three-act structure of mainstream screenwriting, then and now, but rather, three parts characterized by radical shifts of setting, stylistic economy, character perspective, identification, and mysteriously weak transitions and narrative links between the parts. The first section presents the travails of a telephone operator (Shimizu Mayumi) in the workaday world of Tokyo’s lower-middle class commuter labor force, portrayed with something akin to the social realism of Kurosawa’s Nora inu (1947) as variously corruptible types who gamble their money away while awaiting decent employment. So economical is this section that one might well miss the horizontal compositions (suburban apartment blocks, fences, ubiquitous rail lines) gradually overtaken by a sense of the heroine’s entrapment in interior shots favoring right angles, verticals, and, paradoxically, extreme depth. Once the heroine’s supersensitive hearing—and her increasing distress—is established by an extreme, frontal close-up of her ear, followed by a frequent repetition of the grotesquely loud sound of mahjong tiles being shuffled in the next room, we become aware that we are in the grip of a self-consciously expressionist approach.\n\nThe second section unfolds in a series of semi-rural outskirts visited by Nitani’s reporter, whose winding investigation rediscovers the now sidelined, relocated heroine and several other witnesses from the night of the murder, incorporating several of what we may, for brevity’s sake, call “flashbacks.” This includes a harrowing montage sequence in which every shot is a canted angle, a gesture which may or may not relate to the drunkenness of one of the characters involved. While enthralled by its stylistic excess, viewers will not, as a rule, question the diegetic status of these visual distortions, because they function as markers of the “flashback”Page 57 → and are also fairly clearly the objective correlative of the characters’ emotions or heightened perceptions. This suits the conceit of Matsumoto’s story, which hinges on the heroine’s hearing. In short, Kagenaki koe is a notable classic of expressionist crime films in the wake of Fritz Lang’s M; but its contemporary and relatively undistorted social representations are more congenial to Nikkatsu’s commercialism than the early expressionism of a Shōwa period film like Kurutta ippēji (Kinugasa, 1926), for instance, would have been. While Kurosawa, for his part, was also deeply influenced by Lang and Joe May, Suzuki’s film is more recognizably expressionist: yet it thereby lacks the singular self-identity of a film like Nora inu (or Ankokugai no bijo, for that matter). Instead, it is a sophisticated and formally agile representative of a 1950s crime cinema that was practiced, across the globe, by a number of expert craftsmen, now mostly forgotten. In Kagenaki koe, in essence, we know what the filmmakers are doing and why. When Suzuki’s career was deliberately directed away from “B” thrillers towards teenage “pop song” films, however, the “what” of this unmistakable filmmaking practice became obvious, while the “whys” became permanently, tantalizingly out of reach.\n\nSuzuki’s Dog: Color, Comedy, and Modernity\n\nFrom 1960–1962, the heyday of the “Nikkatsu akushon” mega-genre, Suzuki’s career was dominated, against his will, by a series of star vehicles for Wada Kōji, the youngest member of Nikkatsu’s much-touted “Diamond Line” of action stars. The association was a blessing and a curse: while Suzuki gained some success and security as a contract director, his 1950s narratives of disorientation and unconventional subjectivity were made impossible by the fixed, dimensionless persona of Wada, a teen-aged studio creation. These types of films, branded “youngster action” (kozō akushon) by critics, were generally a mix of mild action, light melodrama, and comedy, with rock ’n’ roll thrown in. Some of these efforts, despite incidental pleasures of humor and setting, are so conventional as to be utterly dated. Suzuki’s most remunerative film of the period, Kaikyō chi ni somete/Bloody Channel (1960), was a hoary melodramatic scenario of brother against brother, enlivened only by expansive color vistas of a Japanese coastal town and finely choreographed action. Nothing about the picture—save for a single jump cut that is shocking within the straightforward economy of the whole—is out of the ordinary for, or beyond the capabilities of, such competent studio professionals as Noguchi or Masuda.\n\nPage 58 →But a few films in the Wada cycle served as an experimental ground for the advancement of the “language” of popular film. Kutabare gurentai, Suzuki’s first film with Wada and his first in color, was highly unusual in suffusing a blatantly commercial teen pop song vehicle with what can only be considered an avant-garde spirit and visual surface. Here, along with extremely differential framing, appears the non-diegetic color stylization that would characterize Suzuki’s directorial practice in films such as Nikutai no mon (1964). The improbable story concerns a lower-class teen whose adoptive father is killed by a greedy developer in a hit-and-run incident, but who suddenly inherits the leadership of the Matsudaira clan of Awaji Island. If Kutabare gurentai was, by studio design, a pop culture confection, its deployment of color and movement creates a cinematic equivalent of the matsuri (street festivals) that are woven into the picture.\n\nThe scenario—by, of all people, the liberal democratic politician Hara Kenzaburō, a future Speaker of the Diet—is a bizarre displacement of teen romance (the credited female lead is all-but-invisible) in favor of an “Oedipal romance” in which the teen hero pursues his estranged mother (Higashi Emiko), demanding that she renounce her “sordid” sexual life with a despicable industrialist. There is a certain resonance with post-war social psychology. It is played out seemingly earnestly, but the film may be a reflexive criticism of itself, and Nikkatsu’s kozō akushon cycle of films, as symptoms of a cultural arrested development.\n\nHara’s scenario also advances a suspect, or perhaps simply naïve, ideology proposing a facile reconciliation of the major class and cultural divisions of the era: new American-style consumer aspirations, symbolized by rock ’n’ roll and leisure sports, and nihonjinron discourses of Japanese uniqueness represented by the “feudal” traditionalism of the Matsudaira clan. To be fair, the film itself undercuts the out of touch gentry at every turn, whether by a retainer who loses his shoe while making his ceremonial approach to the dais, or by the street urchin hero, who dismantles the clan coat of arms while telling the matriarch to “quit the jidai-geki,” thus emphasizing the constructed (or fabricated) nature of “tradition.” Moreover, the conflict between the Matsudaira clan and the development cartel from Tokyo seems to put the lie to the very synthesis proposed.\n\nAt one point, when the teenagers have successfully resisted the cartel’s plots, they link arm-and-arm and sing a song from the war era that was well known to veterans like Suzuki, but most likely obscure to the younger generation. The intention may be a far-fetched display of trans-generational solidarity, against precisely what we do not know. But any such display, in the fall of 1960, could not help but recall the massive studentPage 59 → protests against the ANPO treaty.33 Bizarrely, the scene is filmed with a deliberate distortion of the anamorphic lens that creates an effect of “waving” parallel lines over the entire frame. What is the relation, here, of content to form? It is a question that viewers were rarely compelled to ask of a post-war Nikkatsu picture, however stylish. Yet it is an inevitable reaction to the kind of recurring, unconventional gestures in Suzuki’s films, which tantalize us to seek what is probably impossible to find: namely, the ability to determine whether gestures such as this bear an ironic or an instantiating relation to the picture’s narrative and ideological positioning.\n\nKutabare gurentai opens with a jolt of color, style, and speed. The third shot following the titles finds a car heading down a Tokyo street to the accompaniment of upbeat New Orleans jazz. The next shot is a close-up view, from inside the car, of a stuffed animal—a white dog—placed on top of the back seat.\n\nAs the shot and the music continues, the color of the white dog shifts to a gaudy purple, as if sprayed by an invisible hand.\n\nThe following two shots reveal the driver, a greedy businessman (Kondō Hiroshi), in a rapid match on action as he is kissing his mistress (the boy hero’s mother). The film then cuts back to the stuffed dog, which now shifts from purple to aqua blue, then falls forward as the car hits and kills the adoptive father of the hero.\n\nNothing in post-war Japanese cinema—not even the overtly theatrical stylization of kabuki-esque films like Kinoshita’s Narayama bushikō/BalladPage 60 → of Narayama (Shōchiku 1958)—prepares one for this flourish of non-diegetic coloration. It transforms a trivial object whose relation to the narrative is either totally arbitrary, or open to a thousand interpretations. It is a pure, non-diegetic imposition of the filmmakers’ intentionality, but to what purpose? It is a visual metaphor, but for what?\n\nI have written elsewhere about this gesture in reference to an aesthetic of “colorism,” a term used by the film theorist Gilles Deleuze in order to synthesize disparate, pathbreaking experiments in cinematic color by Minnelli, Antonioni, and Godard, the latter of whom made the definitive pronouncement, “it’s not blood, it’s red.”34 Similarly, when asked by a critic why the heroine’s fingernails suddenly turn to a yellow color in Hishū monogatari (1977), Suzuki replied that it was because the room was yellow.35 But Kutabare gurentai goes even further than the examples that Deleuze considered in its use of a “moving color” effect that asks its viewers to make meaning out of the “virtual conjunction” of a series of non-diegetic colors and the trivial, innocuous object (the toy dog) to which they become transiently attached. Although a conventionalized rhetoric of moving color in Japanese theatre, particularly kabuki, is relevant here, I am tempted to read the moving color of Kutabare gurentai metaphorically, as a form of “unsettlement” that relates it to a visual sense of the instability of demolished and rebuilt,36 rapidly changing, and electrified post-war cityscapes (consider, for example, post-war Tokyo’s iconic neon signage, which appeared prominently in Kagenaki koe, among others). When, in Page 61 →Aoi chibusa/Blue Breasts (1958), an abandoned, bombed out shack is the site of a real or possibly imagined rape, it becomes a similarly allegorical site of amorphous cultural anxiety.37 Kutabare gurentai bends color itself, rather than any particular or significant colored object, to this purpose (albeit within a semi-comical idiom). The “wild” detachment of the colors combines with the out-of-control automobile as symptoms of an anxious post-war era, characterized by speed and visual excitement but heading (like the hit-and-run driver) in a risky direction.\n\nThe “colorism” of Kutabare gurentai, through its diegetic “falseness,” opens for the viewer a window on a larger film world in which meaning effects are not dictated by or restricted to a narrative world, and in which cinema represents the “form and pressure of the time” through (often abstract) visual associations. Such a gesture, at the time, was inevitably disruptive. It violated every dictate of the predictable spatial relations and closed narrative realism of classical studio norms. It violated the balanced, earthy color scheme of classical Japanese painting,38 instead recalling the “virtual” movements of color in Taishō and European modernism, particularly surrealism (see Figure 2.12). It soon landed Suzuki in trouble with Nikkatsu, when Hori Kyūsaku reprimanded him for “extensive use of symbolism within a traditional action picture” in the final Wada vehicle, Ore ni kaketa yatsura/Those Who Bet on Me (1962).39 (In this pressurized atmosphere, it is no surprise that Kutabare gurentai was followed by the “scaling-back” of Tokyo kishitai [1960], a film which evinces no formal ambitions whatsoever, but to some extent compensates for this by the charmingly goofy comic business of its first half, including the only example, in Suzuki’s notably anti-American oeuvre, of a positively represented American character: the amusing George Ruika as an irascible music teacher.)\n\nThe “false” conjunction between colors and objects in Kutabare gurentai,40 quite apart from the metaphoric associations we might wish to glean from it or impose upon it, witnesses an early birth of the consequential non-diegetic stylization of the cinema of the 1960s. It uses color as a modernist “shorthand” to create non-diegetic observers of the spectacle—a reflexive, essentially non-fictional intimacy between viewer and screen: a moment somehow suited to particular historical conditions, yet also simply there “to be looked at” in way that, perhaps, operates beyond and above any schema of meaning effects. Kutabare gurentai’s abstract colorism seems to do for all colors what Kandinsky attributed to whiteness: “White . . . works upon us negatively, like . . . pauses in music that break temporarily the melody. . . . not a dead silence, but one pregnant with possibilities.”41Page 62 → The film, and Suzuki’s dog in particular, is similarly an example of loud, brash “silence” signifying nothing, and everything.\n\nFrom Realism to Reflexivity\n\nThe color stylization of Suzuki’s B-pictures, beginning with Kutabare gurentai, was more conceptually radical and arguably more philosophically consequential than the early stylistics of the Shōchiku nuberu bagu, which included such techniques by Ōshima as the limited use of non-diegetic sound (in Seishun zankoku monogatari, 1960), complex flashback structures, and a rhetoric of political figuration (people or emblems set against a non-diegetic black background in Nihon no yoru to kiri/Night and Fog in Japan), which actually had a number of cinematic antecedents.42\n\nLike the nuberu bagu, moreover, though not so inclined towards the Page 63 →topical, these Suzuki pictures are a site of ideological contestation, political as much as aesthetic: just as we have seen in regards to the gender representations and catalogued perversities of his hard-boiled films. One might argue that, before 1963, a fully developed connection between visual abstraction, stylistic impertinence, and ideological reversal—the negation of dominant assumptions—had yet to emerge in Suzuki’s films or in the studio system generally.\n\nThis search for a politics of the image, a synthetic grounding of the pleasures of spectacle in a space of social representation very consciously marked by ideological contradiction and critique, may help to explain how Suzuki’s career could embrace the realist social problem film of the early 1960s, only to quickly abandon it. Subete ga kurutteru is an urban teen delinquency film, a cycle that had begun with Nikkatsu’s own taiyōzoku melodramas. By 1961, it had embraced the more political films of Ōshima and Hani (Furyō shōnen/Bad Boys). Suzuki’s film—which unquestionably reflects the filmmaking practices of the French nouvelle vague, with over two-thirds of the film shot on exterior location in Shinjuku and other areas—has an equal claim to membership in the early phase of the nuberu bagu as two more famous Nikkatsu films, Imamura’s Buta to gunkan (1961) and Kurahara’s Kyonetsu no kisetsu/Season of Heat (which debuted only a week before the Suzuki picture). Only Suzuki’s “low” status as a “cult” or “yakuza” director has prevented this obvious association.\n\nMoreover, I would argue that Subete ga kurutteru advances, on certain political readings, beyond the early nuberu bagu, and certainly beyond Kurahara’s rather exploitative film. Kyonetsu no kisetsu seems to encourage a materialist or naturalist reading of teen delinquency: it as if the summer heat itself, and the teenage libido that it stokes, drives the protagonist to rape a female passerby. The morality of contemporary culture is secondary until the thorny issue of pregnancy comes up. But there is nothing “naturalist” about Subete ga kurutteru. Rather than proposing the positive or negative political significance of the masculine, teen-aged, sexualized body engaged in all manner of crime and sexual violence43 (which was after all the basis of the taiyōzoku films that had made Nikkatsu so wealthy), Suzuki’s film represents an arrested and pathologically anxious post-war masculinity, marked, in particular, by a profound fear of female sexuality. It relates this fear of the feminine to the prewar culture of a patriarchal order that, as is openly declared in the film, was responsible for the war, and now looks on in horror at the generation it has created.\n\nThe title, Subete ga kurutteru or Everything Goes Wrong, applies not only to the characters, but to post-war Japan: every aspect is misdirected, Page 64 →out-of-kilter. It is the most direct and sweeping indictment of post-war society to come out of Nikkatsu’s first decade of production—its “Burial of the Sun” (1960), so to speak. Society is a blighted urban holocaust of emotional despair, sexual predation, and enslavement to the dollar. Where Suzuki’s later films are, broadly speaking, allegorical and open-ended, tending towards the critique of institutional structures rather than the epiphenomenal constraints of ordinary lives, Subete ga kurutteru addresses these concerns through dialogue and a rather contrived plot set against the backdrop of the great student protests of 1960 against the ANPO treaty.44 It concerns a high school student, Jirō (Kawachi Tamio), who cannot get over the fact that his mother is the long-time mistress of a prominent businessman, the arms manufacturer Nanbara (Ashida Shinsuke). The mild, all-too-human Nanbara metonymically serves as a figure of responsibility for the war (Jirō’s father was run over in a “friendly fire” incident by the tanks that Nanbara manufactured) and as an agent of post-war reconstruction, of which the Cold War arms trade was a principal part.\n\nJirō’s problem with his mother has led to a pathological correlation between female sexuality and money. There is an alarming innocence to the moment when he throws coins at the free-spirited girl, Tani (Nezu Yoshiko), who has ended his virginity; he really does assume that women have sex for money. His delusion is no one’s fault, but it drives Jirō mad, like Orestes or Hamlet, until he destroys himself and all around him. When he confronts Nanbara at the climax, Jirō veers between acute perception of the failings of the war generation and an animalistic rage in which he murders the only father-figure he has ever known.\n\nIt seems as if Jirō cannot escape the war he never saw—the desperate entanglements that survival necessitated. But this is surely an incomplete reading. For each of the characters, it is not the war, but the “money-or-nothing” pattern of life under capitalism that bedevils their every step. Jirō’s desperate search for money (through increasingly criminal behavior) is ironically accompanied by an idealist’s disgust for its tainting of all relationships. The idealism only feeds his abominable treatment of Tani, herself a troubled victim/participant of a gang which pays for its thrills by prostituting female members.\n\nTani’s friend Etsuko (Nakagawa Shinako) is trying to raise money for an abortion. Etsuko is treated with casual misogyny by her boyfriend, an otherwise estimable leader of a protest group whose attitude towards her illustrates the limitations of the student movement. This is a prescient critique in an era in which younger directors (one might say a whole generation of Japanese filmmakers) were tending in the opposite direction when Page 65 →it came to the relations between New Left political discourse and gender difference—wherein rape constantly appears as a symbolic, often sacral, act of political dissent or, at the very least, dissident rage.\n\nThe desperate Etsuko waylays Nanbara into sleeping with her for money. We should and have been sympathetic to Etsuko’s plight, but as she veers wildly between seduction, extortion, and beggary, Nanbara can only look upon her pityingly. A close-up of Etsuko shows not simply desperation, but total vacancy—a vacuum devoid of values, dreams, or sense of self. Not even personal desire lives there, only moment-to-moment need.\n\nOne can imagine such faces were common in the starving post-war Tokyo of late 1945. In this film, the new prosperity and the much-vaunted doubling of average incomes have seemingly made little difference for the children of the working class. Why not? Throughout the narrative, their desperation is economic, but the finale of the film seems interested in tracing its roots to a cultural scene that is, in turn, driven by market forces heading in no clear direction. If the question is, “what do these teenagers want?”, then clearly they do not know what they want beyond a daily cycle of sexualized stimulation and response. Their desperate and circuitous behavior continually orbits around the question, neither answering it nor escaping from it. And the consequences of that behavior, when it comes up against an entrenched socio-economic structure seemingly at odds with the leisure economy and commodity culture that floats on the surface, leads to a vicious circle of entrapment.\n\nBeyond this, the film offers no answers or solutions—it is a characteristically negative analysis. Everyone is responsible and yet no one is to blame. Nostalgia, or return to the world of Nanbara, is no answer. Jirō’s Page 66 →mother admits at one point that she has become calculating, valuing her lover’s money rather than their relationship. In response, Nanbara answers enigmatically: “We didn’t have the freedom of young people today, unfortunately.” Energy, at least, and a rebellious determination not to be told what to do still belongs to the young, and though this is hardly a fulfilling ethic or a raison d’être, one can imagine that the filmmakers share Nanbara’s envy, despite the seeming inferno they make out of the youths’ cultural environment.\n\nThe final scene of the film follows a hack journalist and a hostess who are mystified by the haplessness and misfortunes of these teenagers. The camera then tracks with seeming aimlessness around the hostess’s bar, revealing an almost endless supply of useless, alienated and alienating American-style consumer paraphernalia. Has the institutionalized commercialism of desire, in partnership with a sensationalist popular media,45 created the teen degeneracy that it profitably feeds on?\n\nIn a similar film of the same year, TaiyTokyo nagaremono (1966). If Ōshima’s film creates an existentialist or naturalist (what Deleuze would call an “originary”) image of (ex-)urban Japan, Suzuki’s film lies squarely within the Society of the Spectacle—a surprisingly Godardian vision of the sub-bourgeois junkyard (I am thinking in particular of Godard’s diatribe in Prénom: Carmen [1978], perhaps the best thing about that film, on the subject of superfluous plastic coffee mugs). From the vantage point of 2022, which of the two visions, Suzuki’s or Ōshima’s, is the more prescient in its manner of critique? The answer seems obvious. But if Ōshima’s film is something of a period piece today, neither is Subete ga kurutteru above critique. Does its surface orientation and quasi-realist choice of form limit its critique to the superficial as well? Unlike some of the other films discussed in this chapter, in the creation of which we can well imagine the filmmakers strategizing how to push beyond what Suzuki had seen in À bout de souffle, the stylistic audacity (e.g., use of jump cuts) in Subete ga urutteruPage 67 → is not nearly as provocative as Godard’s. And if the film lacks a strong flavor of experimentation, so too does it seem to lack a certain quality of expansiveness common to Suzuki’s films. Even in hard-boiled efforts that managed to differentiate themselves from Noguchi, there is a sense of a unique, irreplaceable world created and embodied by each film and between films: not simply a larger narrative world, though this is certainly an achievement, but a critical and ideological world. This is what Wayne C. Booth called an ethos that connects narrative moments and gestures of a formal nature to the creative agency that produces them (as in, i.e., the popular adjectives “Capraesque” or “Hitchcockian”).\n\nIt would have been interesting to see the development of a craftsman of the empirical, in some ways Ozu-like social melodrama that is evident in Subete ga kurutteru. Not one to repeat himself, however, Suzuki somehow managed to use his unpredictable assignment roster at Nikkatsu in order to forge ahead in the new direction that would become associated with his name. But how to characterize that direction? Hasumi considered teen melodramas such as Akutarō (1963) the most important pictures of Suzuki’s earlier years because they achieved the “perfection” of the Shōchiku Ōfuna melodramas that Suzuki had encountered as an Assistant Director. This was a genre of “simplistic sentiment” about the “everyday joys and sorrows of the countryside” that lacked, to its detriment, a “crucial sense of loss.”46 In regards to Akutarō, about the schooling of a Taishō teenager, it would be hubris to attempt to improve on Hasumi’s description:\n\nThe dialogue, in flawless dialect . . . is superior to the so-called realism of someone like Shindō. Suzuki sticks to the story and the vague nostalgia for the Twenties it embodies, like a hermit in a world of abstract beauty. . . . Suzuki suddenly rises above Ōfuna melodrama and, remarkably, seems to harken back to the days of Ozu and Naruse. The way in which the fatal attraction of the young adolescent is portrayed against the background of the period is unmistakably lyrical and in no way sentimental. . . . The merely workmanlike Akutarō is neither more nor less than a juvenile melodrama in its purest form. Perhaps the film was the last melodrama, [giving] the declining Ōfuna melodrama a worthy funeral.\n\nDespite Suzuki’s attraction to the Taishō imaginary, Hasumi nevertheless subtly corroborates my own sense that pictures such as Akutarō are hardly more representative of Suzuki’s career than a film like Subete ga kurutteru. He writes, “Suzuki made a film of a kind he was not familiar with himself.”47 This is particularly evident when we consider that a “flashback”Page 68 → sequence in Akutarō is not less interesting or impressive than the rest of the picture, even though it is shot on a small studio set in a somewhat stylized way that is closer to Suzuki’s earlier films than to Akutarō’s restrained “lyrical realism,” which is defined by location shooting that captures a quiet, airy country town in crisp compositional and architectural lines.\n\nThe same is true of a humbler exercise in “lyricism” such as the Wada vehicle Toge wo wataru wakai kaze/The Wind of Youth Crosses the Mountain Pass (1961), which is even more atypical of Suzuki’s pictures before and after it. This film, a tribute to the endurance of a penny-ante magic show that travels from town to town, is steeped in semi-nostalgic rural vistas, repressed youthful attractions, and a spirit of camaraderie (even amongst yakuza) that is ideologically unchallenging but enlivened by brisk pacing and sly, deprecating humor. If we ignore the self-consciousness of Suzuki’s later films and attend to specific aspects of diegetic style—such as the static, single-shot compositions that shift, without any disjunction, from breezy hillsides to interiors pouring over with incidental plastic detail (the paraphernalia of the troupe)—than this film is aesthetically without peer amongst Nikkatsu’s output. Beloved in certain quarters (like Akutarō, which boasts a far more streamlined and precise formal economy), the picture seems at times to grasp at being a definitive representation of the lower end of show business. Why it does not do so is a matter of some critical puzzlement, since the filmmakers make the best of a scenario that has sufficient, if unremarkable, narrative interest. Perhaps the film is too concise; perhaps it is too “handsome” in representing the humiliations Page 69 →and anxieties of performing life, from the players’ mildly sordid lives to the deathly encroach of big business upon them. Perhaps the troupe’s performances are filmed in a too muted and frontal manner (though in any case they are supposed to be, at best, humble); or perhaps the film is so comfortable in the vein of Shōchiku nostalgia that it never reaches, at any point, a critical mass of energy. The troupe’s amusing final performance is perhaps too faithful to the script to fully represent the sense of what is possible when performers are given the sudden freedom and motivation to improvise. The fully cinematic energy and immediacy of the great cinematic evocations of stage work (including the noh play in Ozu’s Banshun/Late Spring and Suzuki’s own Kagero-za) is absent here.\n\nIt is nevertheless true that Suzuki’s earlier efforts in the more contemporary sub-genres of romantic melodrama (whether the adult-oriented Raburetaa or the semi-exploitative Aoi chibusa) had been less successful than these nostalgia pieces, and even betrayed a feeling of disengagement between filmmaker and material. Yamane Sadao opined, “if we try to look again at something like Raburetaa, it’s completely not what became the so-called Suzuki Aesthetic. . . . That said, it is beyond doubt a Suzuki film.”48 The comparative obscurity of these films is probably not accidental. Nevertheless, the critics who associate Suzuki’s filmmaking practice (and its formal-thematic continuities across forty Nikkatsu features) with a particularly “Japanese” and prewar lyrical nostalgia, in the vein of Akutarō,49 should not forget that the very essence of the Taishō and early Shōwa imaginary was its characteristically modan impurity: the fluidity of “code-switching” between cultural rhetorics, the earnest engagement with European thought,50 the “negative capability” of simultaneous adaptation of and irony towards Western leisure culture. All of these qualities are on display, for instance, in the theatre troupe’s offerings in Toge wo wataru wakai kaze.\n\nIn final analysis, I believe that the most formative and underappreciated aspects of Suzuki’s early films, in terms of their continuity with the later ones, are the modernist experiments with color and the mastery of the hard-boiled idiom. The latter demonstrated (on a modest scale) a cultural dynamic that was analogous to that of Taishō in its hybrid, inter-textual, transnational characteristics. Hasumi notably downplays this hard-boiled influence, just as he downplays the awareness of Hollywood forms and conventions in Suzuki’s films. (Suzuki reflected on Hollywood deeply enough to be moved, later on, to pen a tribute to the actress Susan Hayward.) Few would argue that in the 1960s, Suzuki’s films achieved a consistency that concentrated on action spectacle as well as a certain kind Page 70 →of reflexivity. Both of these things were congenial to the hard-boiled cinema, with its expressionist and surrealist undertones; neither of them, by the most inclusive measure, were hallmarks of Shōchiku Ōfuna melodrama. I argue that Suzuki’s name today—as a marker of the textual intentionalities that are conventionally attributed to a film’s director—is most typically and justifiably associated with a modernist, self-authenticating cinema practice that declared itself antithetical to realism. Made in 1965, the film Akutarō-den: warui hoshi no shita demo/Bastards: Born Under a Bad Star, plays like a parody of this transition from a rhetoric of realism to a rhetoric of reflexivity, just as it is a parody of the original Akutarō and of seishun eiga generally. It tells in its outlines the same story as Akutarō, but this time in an idiom of broad, often grotesque sex comedy at a rapid pace catalyzed by incessant wipe cuts, three-or-four second flashbacks, mysterious ellipses, subjective camera movements, verbal double entendres, extended comic digressions, and cartoonish performances that border on expressionistic—particularly the magnificent Nogawa Yumiko as a pixie-like temptress who goes to great lengths to uncover the protagonist’s member. There is even an unmotivated repetition of a shot of the hero moving from Right to Left with the screen direction reversed. Most memorable are the metaphorical sight gags, one of which (replacing a baby with a monkey) is completely non-diegetic whilst the other—which compares kendo students, in a cutaway, to quarrelsome, rapacious roosters—turns out, eventually, to be a diegetic intercut of the gambling activities of the hero’s father. As Bordwell wrote of Godard, “the more or less arbitrary juxtaposition of lighting options . . . camera angles, decoupage options, musical styles, and so forth . . . tends to be not systematically oppositional but purely ‘differential’ . . . [and] makes a whole film out of the discrete narrational flourishes. . . .”51 Whereas the political context of the setting of the original Akutarō emerges gradually through the youthful protagonist’s own, limited, point of view, the sequel is a familiar of the freewheeling, satirical comedies of the 1960s condemning provincial repressiveness through the use of historical allegory (Tony Richardson’s Tom Jones, from 1963, was a notable example).\n\nWhat was the problem with “realism” such that Suzuki’s films of the mid-1960s had to go to such lengths to distance themselves from it? The problem with (at least) the version that emerges in Subete ga kurutteru, and which Suzuki must have observed in his rivals Kurahara and Imamura, seems to have been that it relegated politics and philosophy too much to the realm of the diegesis, rather than to the role of the camera, which had established the potential to be openly discursive (in a sense) in Page 71 →the films of Godard. Realism also tended (certainly with Kurahara) to naturalize exploitation through the sway of narrative and identification with the male protagonist. Suzuki as a director was either unable or unwilling to achieve the kind of pared-down realism that could become truly differential and philosophically expressive—although some may read Akutarō as a step in that direction. The influence, moreover, of the silent era on Suzuki—expressionism, French surrealism, and Carl Theodor Dreyer—likely inclined him in the opposite direction.52 From what we know of his artistic persona, Suzuki was of no temperament to take up the position of follower of either the nouvelle vague or the nuberu bagu. Partly for this reason, and partly out of necessity as a Nikkatsu director, he would henceforth explore his formal and political concerns through genre, particularly in the allegory of crime and in the landscape of the dream-image, the collective desiring unconscious of a nation."
