Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being:\n\n1. With malice aforethought, either express or implied;\n\n2. Caused by a controlled substance which was sold, given, traded or otherwise made available to a person in violation of chapter 453 of NRS; or\n\n3. Caused by a violation of NRS 453.3325.\n\nÊ The unlawful killing may be effected by any of the various means by which death may be occasioned.\n\n[1911 C&P § 119; RL § 6384; NCL § 10066]—(NRS A 1983, 512; 1985, 1598; 1989, 589; 2005, 1059)\n\nNRS 200.020 Malice: Express and implied defined.\n\n1. Express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature, which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof.\n\n2. Malice shall be implied when no considerable provocation appears, or when all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.\n\n[1911 C&P § 120; A 1915, 67; 1919 RL § 6385; NCL § 10067]\n\nNRS 200.030 Degrees of murder; penalties.\n\n1.

Murder of the second degree is all other kinds of murder.\n\n3. The jury before whom any person indicted for murder is tried shall, if they find the person guilty thereof, designate by their verdict whether the person is guilty of murder of the first or second degree.\n\n4. A person convicted of murder of the first degree is guilty of a category A felony and shall be punished:\n\n(a) By death, only if one or more aggravating circumstances are found and any mitigating circumstance or circumstances which are found do not outweigh the aggravating circumstance or circumstances, unless a court has made a finding pursuant to NRS 174.098 that the defendant is a person with an intellectual disability and has stricken the notice of intent to seek the death penalty; or\n\n(b) By imprisonment in the state prison:\n\n(1) For life without the possibility of parole;\n\n(2) For life with the possibility of parole, with eligibility for parole beginning when a minimum of 20 years has been served; or\n\n(3) For a definite term of 50 years, with eligibility for parole beginning when a minimum of 20 years has been served.\n\nÊ A determination of whether aggravating circumstances exist is not necessary to fix the penalty at imprisonment for life with or without the possibility of parole.\n\n5.

The murder was committed by a person who knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person by means of a weapon, device or course of action which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.\n\n4. The murder was committed while the person was engaged, alone or with others, in the commission of, or an attempt to commit or flight after committing or attempting to commit, any robbery, arson in the first degree, burglary, invasion of the home or kidnapping in the first degree, and the person charged:\n\n(a) Killed or attempted to kill the person murdered; or\n\n(b) Knew or had reason to know that life would be taken or lethal force used.\n\n5.

The defendant has, in the immediate proceeding, been convicted of more than one offense of murder in the first or second degree. For the purposes of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to have been convicted of a murder at the time the jury verdict of guilt is rendered or upon pronouncement of guilt by a judge or judges sitting without a jury.\n\n13. The person, alone or with others, subjected or attempted to subject the victim of the murder to nonconsensual sexual penetration immediately before, during or immediately after the commission of the murder. For the purposes of this subsection:\n\n(a) Nonconsensual means against the victims will or under conditions in which the person knows or reasonably should know that the victim is mentally or physically incapable of resisting, consenting or understanding the nature of his or her conduct, including, but not limited to, conditions in which the person knows or reasonably should know that the victim is dead.\n\n(b) Sexual penetration means cunnilingus, fellatio or any intrusion, however slight, of any part of the victims body or any object manipulated or inserted by a person, alone or with others, into the genital or anal openings of the body of the victim, whether or not the victim is alive.

In cases of voluntary manslaughter, there must be a serious and highly provoking injury inflicted upon the person killing, sufficient to excite an irresistible passion in a reasonable person, or an attempt by the person killed to commit a serious personal injury on the person killing.\n\n2. Voluntary manslaughter does not include vehicular manslaughter as described in NRS 484B.657.\n\n[1911 C&P § 123; RL § 6388; NCL § 10070]—(NRS A 2005, 79)\n\nNRS 200.060 When killing punished as murder. The killing must be the result of that sudden, violent impulse of passion supposed to be irresistible; for, if there should appear to have been an interval between the assault or provocation given and the killing, sufficient for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard, the killing shall be attributed to deliberate revenge and punished as murder.\n\n[1911 C&P § 124; RL § 6389; NCL § 10071]\n\nNRS 200.070 Involuntary manslaughter defined.\n\n1.

Involuntary manslaughter does not include vehicular manslaughter as described in NRS 484B.657.\n\n[1911 C&P § 125; RL § 6390; NCL § 10072]—(NRS A 1981, 867; 1983, 1014; 1995, 1726; 2005, 79)\n\nNRS 200.080 Punishment for voluntary manslaughter.

A bare fear of any of the offenses mentioned in NRS 200.120, to prevent which the homicide is alleged to have been committed, is not sufficient to justify the killing. It must appear that the circumstances were sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable person and that the person killing really acted under the influence of those fears and not in a spirit of revenge.\n\n2. There is a rebuttable presumption that the circumstances were sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable person and that the person killing really acted under the influence of those fears and not in a spirit of revenge if the person killing:\n\n(a) Knew or reasonably believed that the person who was killed was entering unlawfully and with force, or attempting to enter unlawfully and with force, the occupied habitation or occupied motor vehicle, of another;\n\n(b) Knew or reasonably believed that the person who was killed was committing or attempting to commit a crime of violence; and\n\n(c) Did not provoke the person who was killed.\n\n3.

In the actual resistance of an attempt to commit a felony upon the slayer, in his or her presence, or upon or in a dwelling, or other place of abode in which the slayer is.\n\n[1911 C&P § 133; A 1931, 160; 1931 NCL § 10080]—(NRS A 1993, 932; 2017, 787)\n\nNRS 200.170 Burden of proving circumstances of mitigation or justifiable or excusable homicide. The killing of the deceased named in the indictment or information by the defendant being proved, the burden of proving circumstances of mitigation, or that justify or excuse the homicide, will devolve on the accused, unless the proof on the part of the prosecution sufficiently manifests that the crime committed only amounts to manslaughter, or that the accused was justified, or excused in committing the homicide.\n\n[1911 C&P § 134; A 1951, 524]\n\nNRS 200.180 Excusable homicide by misadventure.\n\n1.

The person killed was the assailant, or that the slayer had really, and in good faith, endeavored to decline any further struggle before the mortal blow was given.\n\n[1911 C&P § 137; RL § 6402; NCL § 10084]\n\nNRS 200.210 Killing of unborn quick child; penalty.

The Legislature finds and declares that:\n\n1. This State has a compelling interest in assuring that the victim of a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking:\n\n(a) Reports the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking to the appropriate authorities;\n\n(b) Cooperates in the investigation and prosecution of the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking; and\n\n(c) Testifies at the criminal trial of the person charged with committing the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking.\n\n2. The fear of public identification and invasion of privacy are fundamental concerns for the victims of sexual offenses, offenses involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking. If these concerns are not addressed and the victims are left unprotected, the victims may refrain from reporting and prosecuting sexual offenses, offenses involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking.\n\n3. A victim of a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking may be harassed, intimidated and psychologically harmed by a public report that identifies the victim. A sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking is, in many ways, a unique, distinctive and intrusive personal trauma. The consequences of identification are often additional psychological trauma and the public disclosure of private personal experiences.\n\n4. Recent public criminal trials have focused attention on these issues and have dramatized the need for basic protections for the victims of sexual offenses, offenses involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking.\n\n5. The public has no overriding need to know the individual identity of the victim of a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking.\n\n6. The purpose of NRS 200.3771 to 200.3774, inclusive, is to protect the victims of sexual offenses, offenses involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking from harassment, intimidation, psychological trauma and the unwarranted invasion of their privacy by prohibiting the disclosure of their identities to the public.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1993, 2475; A 2009, 1296; 2013, 2427; 2017, 2317)\n\nNRS 200.3771 Victims of certain sexual offenses: Confidentiality of records and reports that reveal identity; when disclosure permitted; penalty.\n\n1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any information which is contained in:\n\n(a) Court records, including testimony from witnesses;\n\n(b) Intelligence or investigative data, reports of crime or incidents of criminal activity or other information;\n\n(c) Records of criminal history, as that term is defined in NRS 179A.070; and\n\n(d) Records in the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History,\n\nÊ that reveals the identity of a victim of a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking is confidential, including but not limited to the victims photograph, likeness, name, address or telephone number.\n\n2. A defendant charged with a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking and the defendants attorney are entitled to all identifying information concerning the victim in order to prepare the defense of the defendant. The defendant and the defendants attorney shall not disclose this information except, as necessary, to those persons directly involved in the preparation of the defense.\n\n3. A court of competent jurisdiction may authorize the release of the identifying information, upon application, if the court determines that:\n\n(a) The person making the application has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that good cause exists for the disclosure;\n\n(b) The disclosure will not place the victim at risk of personal harm; and\n\n(c) Reasonable notice of the application and an opportunity to be heard have been given to the victim.\n\n4. Nothing in this section prohibits:\n\n(a) Any publication or broadcast by the media concerning a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking.\n\n(b) The disclosure of identifying information to any nonprofit organization or public agency whose purpose is to provide counseling, services for the management of crises or other assistance to the victims of crimes if:\n\n(1) The organization or agency needs identifying information of victims to offer such services; and\n\n(2) The court or a law enforcement agency approves the organization or agency for the receipt of the identifying information.\n\n5. The willful violation of any provision of this section or the willful neglect or refusal to obey any court order made pursuant thereto is punishable as criminal contempt.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1993, 2476; A 2009, 1297; 2013, 2427; 2017, 2317)\n\nNRS 200.3772 Victims of certain sexual offenses: Procedure for substituting pseudonym for name on files, records and reports; actual identity confidential; when disclosure required; immunity for unintentional disclosure.\n\n1. A victim of a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking may choose a pseudonym to be used instead of the victims name on all files, records and documents pertaining to the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking, including, without limitation, criminal intelligence and investigative reports, court records and media releases.\n\n2. A victim who chooses to use a pseudonym shall file a form to choose a pseudonym with the law enforcement agency investigating the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking. The form must be provided by the law enforcement agency.\n\n3. If the victim files a form to use a pseudonym, as soon as practicable the law enforcement agency shall make a good faith effort to:\n\n(a) Substitute the pseudonym for the name of the victim on all reports, files and records in the agencys possession; and\n\n(b) Notify the prosecuting attorney of the pseudonym.\n\nÊ The law enforcement agency shall maintain the form in a manner that protects the confidentiality of the information contained therein.\n\n4. Upon notification that a victim has elected to be designated by a pseudonym, the court shall ensure that the victim is designated by the pseudonym in all legal proceedings concerning the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking.\n\n5. The information contained on the form to choose a pseudonym concerning the actual identity of the victim is confidential and must not be disclosed to any person other than the defendant or the defendants attorney unless a court of competent jurisdiction orders the disclosure of the information. The disclosure of information to a defendant or the defendants attorney is subject to the conditions and restrictions specified in subsection 2 of NRS 200.3771. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n6. A court of competent jurisdiction may order the disclosure of the information contained on the form only if it finds that the information is essential in the trial of the defendant accused of the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking, or the identity of the victim is at issue.\n\n7. A law enforcement agency that complies with the requirements of this section is immune from civil liability for unknowingly or unintentionally:\n\n(a) Disclosing any information contained on the form filed by a victim pursuant to this section that reveals the identity of the victim; or\n\n(b) Failing to substitute the pseudonym of the victim for the name of the victim on all reports, files and records in the agencys possession.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1993, 2477; A 2009, 1298; 2013, 2428; 2017, 2318)\n\nNRS 200.3773 Victims of certain sexual offenses: Public officer or employee prohibited from disclosing identity; exceptions; penalty.\n\n1. A public officer or employee who has access to any records, files or other documents which include the photograph, likeness, name, address, telephone number or other fact or information that reveals the identity of a victim of a sexual offense, an offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking shall not intentionally or knowingly disclose the identifying information to any person other than:\n\n(a) The defendant or the defendants attorney;\n\n(b) A person who is directly involved in the investigation, prosecution or defense of the case;\n\n(c) A person specifically named in a court order issued pursuant to NRS 200.3771; or\n\n(d) A nonprofit organization or public agency approved to receive the information pursuant to NRS 200.3771.\n\n2. A person who violates the provisions of subsection 1 is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1993, 2477; A 2009, 1298; 2013, 2429; 2017, 2319)\n\nNRS 200.3774 Victims of certain sexual offenses: Effect of waiver of confidentiality. The provisions of NRS 200.3771, 200.3772 and 200.3773 do not apply if the victim of the sexual offense, offense involving a pupil or child or sex trafficking voluntarily waives, in writing, the confidentiality of the information concerning the victims identity.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1993, 2478; A 2009, 1299; 2013, 2429; 2017, 2319)\n\nNRS 200.378 Court may impose temporary or extended order to restrict conduct of alleged perpetrator, defendant or convicted person; penalty for violation of order; dissemination of order; notice provided in order.\n\n1. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a person who reasonably believes that the crime of sexual assault has been committed against him or her by another person may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary or extended order directing the person who allegedly committed the sexual assault to:\n\n(a) Stay away from the home, school, business or place of employment of the victim of the alleged sexual assault and any other location specifically named by the court.\n\n(b) Refrain from contacting, intimidating, threatening or otherwise interfering with the victim of the alleged sexual assault and any other person named in the order, including, without limitation, a member of the family or the household of the victim of the alleged sexual assault.\n\n(c) Comply with any other restriction which the court deems necessary to protect the victim of the alleged sexual assault or to protect any other person named in the order, including, without limitation, a member of the family or the household of the victim of the alleged sexual assault.\n\n2. If a defendant charged with a crime involving sexual assault is released from custody before trial or is found guilty at the trial, the court may issue a temporary or extended order or provide as a condition of the release or sentence that the defendant:\n\n(a) Stay away from the home, school, business or place of employment of the victim of the alleged sexual assault and any other location specifically named by the court.\n\n(b) Refrain from contacting, intimidating, threatening or otherwise interfering with the victim of the alleged sexual assault and any other person named in the order, including, without limitation, a member of the family or the household of the victim of the alleged sexual assault.\n\n(c) Comply with any other restriction which the court deems necessary to protect the victim of the alleged sexual assault or to protect any other person named in the order, including, without limitation, a member of the family or the household of the victim of the alleged sexual assault.\n\n3. A temporary order may be granted with or without notice to the adverse party. An extended order may be granted only after:\n\n(a) Notice of the petition for the order and of the hearing thereon is served upon the adverse party pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure; and\n\n(b) A hearing is held on the petition.\n\n4. If an extended order is issued by a justice court, an interlocutory appeal lies to the district court, which may affirm, modify or vacate the order in question. The appeal may be taken without bond, but its taking does not stay the effect or enforcement of the order.\n\n5. Unless a more severe penalty is prescribed by law for the act that constitutes the violation of the order, any person who intentionally violates:\n\n(a) A temporary order is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.\n\n(b) An extended order is guilty of a category C felony and shall be punished as provided in NRS 193.130.\n\n6.

A temporary or extended order issued pursuant to this section must provide notice that a person who is arrested for violating the order will not be admitted to bail sooner than 12 hours after the arrest if:\n\n(a) The arresting officer determines that such a violation is accompanied by a direct or indirect threat of harm;\n\n(b) The person has previously violated a temporary or extended order for protection; or\n\n(c) At the time of the violation or within 2 hours after the violation, the person has:\n\n(1) A concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in his or her blood or breath; or\n\n(2) An amount of a prohibited substance in his or her blood or urine, as applicable, that is equal to or greater than the amount set forth in subsection 3 or 4 of NRS 484C.110.\n\n(Added to NRS by 2009, 228; A 2017, 322)\n\nNRS 200.3781 Petitioner for order: Deferment of costs and fees; free information concerning order; no fee for serving order.\n\n1.

The clerk of the court shall provide a person who petitions the court for a temporary or extended order pursuant to NRS 200.378 and the adverse party, free of cost, with information about the:\n\n(a) Availability of temporary and extended orders pursuant to NRS 200.378;\n\n(b) Procedure for filing an application for such an order; and\n\n(c) Right to proceed without legal counsel.\n\n3.
