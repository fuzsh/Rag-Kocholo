        "text": "The moral of this case: sometimes the demonstrative evidence can be so overwhelming that it leaves the fact-finder with just one answer.\n\nWhile it may be stating the obvious, we should all recognize that surveillance films offered to impeach claimant's credibility are of all intents and purposes useless unless the claimant denies that he or she can engage in physical activities and such films indicate otherwise. We should also recognize that a well-prepared and well-presented claim will demonstrate the full extent of the claimant's disability to the judge without the necessity of exaggerating any disability or even \"showboating\" for the judge's edification. Of course, as is often stated by the host of that popular television program \" CANDID CAMERA ,\" \"smile because you never know when you will be on camera.\" Thus, it might be advisable for counsel to alert claimant to that possibility.\n\nThe evidentiary evidence of surveillance films is diminished if the evidence is distorted or misleading or if there is an attempt at improper influence by evoking emotional responses instead of rational ones. Distortion can be intentional or inadvertent and, sometimes, can result from the technical expertise of the photographer. Such distortion can be countered by the other side's expert witness. All of these factors bearing upon the authenticity and reliability of the evidence are considered by the judge as part of the evaluation process.\n\nI will now briefly highlight two significant problems in reported cases. For instance, motion pictures of a claimant disabled by spinal disc disease showing him shoveling gravel were not enough to justify reopening the case and terminating benefits. Why not, a disinterested party might ask? The record reflected that elaborate detective work was done to induce the disabled man to dig, to conceal cameras in fox holes and to spy on his other activities. The net result was to convince the judge that the man was indeed disabled because he moved cautiously, used only his arms and hands and never bent his back. Fee v. Calcasieu Paper Co. , 112 So.2d 439 (La. App. 1959).\n\nIn another case, the activities recorded on surveillance films were apparently induced by payment under the pretext the claimant, in need of money at the time, was aiding a criminal investigation. However, the appellate court held that the films were properly admitted because films \"need not be taken with either the knowledge or consent of the claimant,\" even if taken after the commencement of litigation. Isodore v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board , 77 Pa. C. 346, 465 A.2d 1096 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1983).\n\nAPPENDIX ADDITIONAL\n\nREPRESENTATIVE CASES INVOLVING\n\nUSE OF SURVEILLANCE FILMS\n\nAND THEIR PROBATIVE VALUE\n\nBENEFITS AWARDED AND/OR CONTINUED EVEN WITH SURVEILLANCE FILMS IN EVIDENCE\n\n1. Duncan v. Carlo Ditta, Inc. , 206 So.2d 140 (La. App. 1968) (employer's motion for modification was denied despite a movie film which showed claimant at work on a soft drink truck as claimant testified that although he was working, he at times required a helper and missed many days of work because of this condition; Louisiana workmen's compensation law does not require that an employee, in order to earn a living, work in pain).\n\n2. Glover v. Southern Pipe & Supply Co. , 408 So.2d 352 (La. App. 1981), cert. denied , 412 So.2d 86 (1982) (the court of appeals reversed the denial of benefits because the trial judge had placed far too much weight on a very brief film which showed the claimant lifting a light load and bending for a few seconds, i.e. , carrying a small laundry basket of clothes to and from the back seat of a car).\n\n3. Knott v. Welltech, Inc. , 428 So.2d 1221 (La. App. 3 Cir. 1983) (a 51-second film of claimant moving sacks of crawfish was not probative evidence that he was not totally disabled from his back pain because the film showed only \"very brief and not particularly strenuous activity\").\n\n4. Petz v. Boise Cascade Corp. , 58 Or. App. 347, 648 P.2d 372 (1982) (a film which showed claimant working on his house only showed that he could engage in sporadic physical activity but did not sustain the employer's burden of proving that claimant who had only an eighth grade education and was unable to obtain suitable employment was no longer totally disabled).\n\n5. Krugen v. Beall Pipe & tank Corp. , 19 Or. App. 922, 529 P.2d 962 (1974) (film only showed the claimant who was sixty-five years of age doing those things that most retired men can do such as puttering around camper equipment).\n\n6. John B. Kelly Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board , 8 Pa. C. 589, 303 A.2d 255 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1973) (films showing physical activities do not constitute an infallible measure of either disability or earning power; such films must be scrutinized with great caution by the courts).\n\n7. Constanzo v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co. , 124 So.2d 621 (La. App. 1960) (motion pictures taken at intervals lose much of their potency in refuting the extent of the claimant's disability and fair play dictates that when such pictures are used in a compensation claim, \"they should reflect all activities of the subject of the pictures, and not merely snatches of fragments taken over the four hour interval\" of surveillance).\n\n8. DeChandt v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau , 452 N.W. 2d 82 (N.D. 1990) (videotapes showing claimant welding and cutting up farm equipment did not outweigh positive medical testimony of claimant's continuing disability together with his testimony that these jobs were painful and left him in pain).\n\n9. Lambert v. Wolf's Inc. , 132 So.2d 522, 527 (La.App. 3 Cir. 1961) (evidence in the form of motion pictures must be used with great caution, because such pictures show only very brief intervals of the activities of the subject; they do not reflect whether the subject is suffering pain, and they do not show the after effects of the activities).\n\nDENIAL OR REDUCTION IN BENEFITS BASED, IN PART, ON SURVEILLANCE FILMS.\n\n1. Scott v. Wasielewski , 89 Ariz. 29, 357 P.2d 614 (1960) (motion picture film was admitted to prove fraudulent claim of disability).\n\n2. Lawler v. Industrial Commission , 24 Ariz. App. 282, 537 P.2d 1340 (1975) (benefits were terminated by the carrier based on surveillance films which caused one of the claimant's expert medical witnesses to change his opinion on the extent of disability).\n\n3. Rodriguez v. Miami Baking Co. , 430 So.2d 955 (Fla. App. 1983) (videotape showed claimant doing heavy lifting at her brother's business).\n\n4. Blackwell v. Wimberly , 53 So.2d 814 (La. App. 1951) (films made on five successive days showing heavy work as a roughneck in the oil fields with no evidence of pain).\n\n5. Bankston v. The American Insurance Co. , 171 So.2d 290 (La. App. 1965) (film showed claimant engaging in normal activities with no trouble).\n\n6. Nolan v. Stamper Drilling Company , 488 So.2d 312 (La. App. 1986) (videotape showed claimant working on his car and engaging in \"gymnastic\" activities, according to the testifying physician).\n\n7. Ulibarri v. Homestead Mining Company , 643 P.2d 298 (N.M. App. 1982) (surveillance team had developed pictures of claimant pouring and shoveling concrete to build a driveway).\n\n8. Hartzell v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board , 101 Pa.C. 137, 515 A.2d 1009 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1986) (surveillance videotape caused three physicians to alter their opinions on claimant's disability).\n\n9. Patterson v. Stayton Canning Company , 36 Or. App. 263, 584 P.2d 347 (1978) (referee credited surveillance film as impeaching claimant's credibility on the extent of his disability and the referee could disregard testimony of claimant's doctor and an employment counsellor).\n\n10. Blackford v. State Accident Insurance Fund , 521 P.2d 1092 (Or. App. 1974) (motion picture showed the claimant actively doing garden duties that he testified he had not done and could not do).\n\n11. Harpham v. General Casualty Co. , 232 Neb. 568, 441 N.W. 2d 600 (1989) (the court, rejecting as \"spurious\" claimant's assertion that he was unfairly prejudiced by the selective viewing of three videotapes, held that while those times that the claimant did not use his left arm would not establish he was unable to do so, those times that he, in fact, used his arm established his ability to do so ).\n\n[ENDNOTES]"
