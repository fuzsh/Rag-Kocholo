        "text": "Antonine, a worthless, good-for-nothing scoundrel, demands money of his cousin Galora, an energetic, provident husband and father. His demands are met with a positive rebuff, and when he becomes insistent be is forcibly ejected by Galora. As he leaves the tenement he vows to get even, and lies in wait until Galora has gone out on business. Climbing to the fifth floor, on which the Galoras live, he watches his chance, which comes when Mrs. Galora goes for an instant to visit a neighbor on the same floor. Darting into the apartment and raising the window he perceives the awful result of a drop to the ground, five stories below, and so evolves a plan that is dastardly in the extreme. Taking the infant child from the cradle, and placing it in a basket he lets it out with a short rope, the end of which he secures by letting the sash down on it, so that to raise the window would precipitate the baby to destruction. Not content with this he follows Galora and would have killed him were it not for the timely arrival of a policeman, who arrests him. Here he boasts of what he did at the home, and Galora makes a mad race to save his child, who is still dangling five stories from the ground; several times Mrs. Galora has approached the window to hang out clothes, etc., but was always called away by some fortuitous happening, until Galora bursts in followed by two policemen, who have given chase, thinking him crazy. They are now in a quandary as to how to rescue the child, for to raise the window meant certain death. At last Galora suggests they let down the top sash and he is held by the feet as head down he lifts the baby from its perilous position into the room. While the subject is intensely thrilling, it is totally devoid of gruesomeness.\n\nMr. Bodkens reads an account in the paper of different people receiving black-hand letters and warnings. To him it is a joke until one of his fellow clerks impresses on him the fact that they are really dangerous and mentions that even he, Bodkens, is liable to receive one. Bodkens is a trifle nervous when he arrives home. Finding an imprint of a black hand on his door does not help matters and added to this, when he and his wife and four friends sit down to dinner, the hand once more appears, this time on the tablecloth. The search for the owner of the hand and the finding of him, are amusingly shown and must be seen to be enjoyed.\n\nThe glove dealer had prepared a new advertisement-a gloved hand, executed in the blackest paint on a board of snowy whiteness. It was so good that he felt the world must see it at once. So the board is strapped to the back of a sandwich man, who sits i down on a seat and nods himself to sleep. Boniface, resplendent in a new white suit, is sitting back to back with the sandwich man, and he is also asleep. As the sandwich man nods, the wet paint of his board is brought into contact with Boniface's back, so that when the sandwich man awakes and goes on his way, an impression of a black hand is left on Boniface's coat. Small wonder that a passer-by, seeing this illumined sign on Boniface's back, should fly in terror for the police. Small wonder, too, that the police should enlist the aid of the fire brigade, and a motley crew of passers-by. to compass the capture of one who must undoubtedly be a dangerous criminal. Stealthily they creep to the seat where Boniface is slumbering. Boniface awakes. He sees the crowd, and runs. Boniface is at last captured at the glover's shop, where the sandwich man has just returned with his spoiled board. The mistake is soon explained, and Boniface gets a very warm time, both from his pursuers. who are furious at having made a needless chase, and from the glover and his assistants on account of the spoiled advertisement.\n\nSi Haskins, a farmer, receives word that a case he is interested in is up for trial. Si sets off for the Metropolis. He goes to Central Park. He falls asleep on a bench and a park bum, passing by, steals his bag. Si wakes up and gives him chase, but fails to catch him. The bum had been reading in an old newspaper an account of the sending of a bomb to Judge Rosalsky. In the bag the bum found the address of Si's attorney and to him he showed the bag and intimated a deadly bomb was contained therein. The lawyer put money into the bum's hand and pushed him out of his office. The attorney then saw that the bum had left the \"bomb\" behind him. The lawyer phoned to the police and pretty soon a policeman was on hand and carried away the \"bomb.\" At the station, the captain called around him his force and they went to McGowan's Point in Central Park. Here they were about to explode the \"bomb\" by flinging their clubs at it when along came Si, spied his bag, and in spite of the yells of the cops, picked it up and flew. Back at the lawyer's office the latter was congratulating himself on his safe delivery from the fate impending over Judge Rosalsky when who walked in but Si and his bag. The lawyer yelled and mounted his desk. Si went away, believing his case had been settled out of court though his attorney had an odd way of winding it up. Si made his way to Central Park again and suddenly came to the bum counting over his spoils. Si quickly seized him and carried him triumphantly to the station. In walked the farmer gripping the bum by the collar and the \"bomb\" by the grip. The officers hurled themselves through the windows. The bum escaped. Si, however, overtook the bum and gave him a sound drubbing.\n\nBill Graw is the leader of the Water Rats, a gang of thieves infesting the waterfront. He is kicked out by the gang when he is ill.
