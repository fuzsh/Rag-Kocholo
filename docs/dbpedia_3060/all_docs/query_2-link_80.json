        "text": "Social work theories may be taken from various disciplines such as criminology, law, education, politics, sociology, and psychology. Individually, each discipline attempts to explain human behavior in a context unique to that field of study. However, to ensure that you, as a social worker, are able to explain a particular behavior, it is important you find the appropriate theory, or a combination thereof. One widely recognized theory that could be beneficial for some of your clients is social learning theory.\n\nWhile social learning theory comes from psychology, its tenets are very much applicable to the study of social work. This introduction to social learning theory addresses its foundation, elements, strengths, and weaknesses, along with its application in social work. Included is a list of books and online resources to learn more.\n\nSocial learning theory suggests that social behavior is learned by observing and imitating the behavior of others. Psychologist Albert Bandura developed social learning theory as an alternative to the earlier work of fellow psychologist B.F. Skinner, known for his influence on behaviorism. While behavioral psychology focuses on how the environment and reinforcement affect behavior, Bandura put forth that individuals can learn behavior through observation.\n\nSocial learning theory has four mediational processes that help determine whether a new behavior is acquired:\n\nIn addition to the behavior, rewards and punishment that follow will be studied by the observer. If the observer perceives the rewards to be greater than the costs (punishment), they will most likely imitate the behavior. However, if the observer does not value the vicarious reinforcement, they will not model the behavior.\n\nIn 1961 and 1963, Albert Bandura conducted a series of experiments to determine whether social behaviors (aggression) could be acquired by observation and imitation. The research that entailed children observing a model punch an inflatable doll looked to support the idea that children emulate their behavior by watching others. These experiments were collectively known as the Bobo doll experiments.\n\nSupported by his findings in the Bobo doll experiments, Bandura developed the social learning theory in 1977. The theory later evolved into the social cognitive theory in 1986 which postulates that learning takes place in a social framework with an ever-changing and shared interaction between the person, environment, and behavior.\n\nSocial learning theory is grounded by several key assumptions:\n\nExamples of social learning theory in everyday life are prevalent, with one of the most common being children who imitate family members, friends, famous figures, and even television characters. If a child perceives there is a meaningful reward for such behavior, they will perform it at some point.\n\nSocial media presents plenty of social learning examples as individuals emulate others by reenacting movie scenes, copying dance moves from music videos, and engaging in various social media challenges. This frenzied behavior is typically spurred by the desire to be socially accepted or liked.\n\nNew employees in the workplace may imitate the behavior of their peers in an effort to conform to the work culture. Or, they may model coworkers’ behavior to help earn a good standing with a superior.\n\nStudents may emulate fellow students, celebrities, and mentors as a means to fit in or garner attention. While positive behaviors are imitated, problematic behaviors are modeled as well.\n\nSocial learning theory posits that people emulate the behavior they observe in their environment, especially if that behavior is reinforced in others. For example, if a child observes their parents going to work every day, volunteering at a local community center, and helping their significant other with tasks around the home, the child is likely to mimic those behaviors. If rewarded, these behaviors become reinforced and most likely repeated by the individual. This premise applies to troublesome behaviors as well. A person who observes someone treating others poorly and being rewarded for it may follow suit.\n\nSocial workers can use social learning theory to identify the behavioral models a client may be emulating and use that information to help correct negative behavior, such as underage drinking, drug use, or unprotected sex.\n\nTwo areas of application of social learning theory in social work include research and intervention. Researchers can use the theory to understand how aggressiveness and violence can be transferred through observational learning. The theory can further be used to investigate how positive role models can foster desirable behaviors and promote social change.\n\nAs an intervention tool, a social worker can implement social learning theory to influence positive new behaviors by altering the reinforcement, whether positive or negative, associated with the source of the issue. It is important to note that to effectively apply social learning theory principles as an intervention, it is essential a social worker includes the use of other methods of work such as symbolic coding, stress management, and vicarious reinforcement.\n\nAs a student in a social work program, you will discover additional applications of social learning theory and learn how to combine them with other social work theories, practices, and techniques.\n\nSocial learning theory explains complex behavior by acknowledging cognitive factors and the role they play in influencing a person’s decision to imitate behavior.\n\nOne of the primary strengths of social learning theory is its flexibility in explaining the differences in a person’s behavior or learning process, i.e. when there is a change in a person’s environment, the person’s behavior may change. Another strength is that it allows for different ways of learning. A person can learn through observation or direct experiences.\n\nHowever, the theory does not account for how we develop a wide range of behavior based on thoughts and feelings. We have a significant amount of control over our behavior and, as such, we don’t necessarily reproduce poor behavior, like violence, merely because we experience it. Similarly, the theory fails to recognize the importance of accountability. By placing greater weight on the environment, the theory largely assumes one’s behavior and actions are determined by society, not by how a person handles or processes information.\n\nSocial learning theory also disregards the influence of biological factors, such as hormones and genetics, on behavior. This limits a person’s behavior to either nature or nurture, rather than recognizing that behavior is the interaction of both one’s biology and environment. In the same vein, social learning theory overlooks ordinary developmental milestones. Although children do not mature at identical rates, certain milestones may still occur irrespective of the environmental setting.\n\nAdditionally, the theory does not account for all behavior, specifically in cases where there is no apparent role model for the observer to emulate.\n\nBy modifying and renaming social learning theory to social cognitive learning, Bandura offered a more fitting framework for how we learn from our social experiences.\n\nWhile social learning theory demonstrates that behavior, whether positive or negative, can be taught or adapted through observation, it is essential as a social worker that you employ additional relevant practices and social work theories that account for other factors that may play a role in a client’s behavior.\n\nHere are some relevant books and online resources you may find helpful throughout your social work education and career:\n\nLaunch your career in social work by earning a degree in social work.\n\nLast updated November 2023"
