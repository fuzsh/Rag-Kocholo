History

The town, anciently named Malleanum or Mallianum, was first mentioned in a document of the 9th century. It was a Norman state (internal susbdivision of a baronial circumdary) that included Capizzo, Stio and Gorga.

Heavily damaged in a fire in 1669, Magliano was rebuilt over a nearby hill, site of an ancient Goth castle, with the name of Magliano Nuovo ("New Magliano"). Some years later, the original site was rebuilt with the name of Magliano Vetere ("Old Magliano").[3]

Geography

Magliano Vetere is located in a hill area in the middle of the Cilento, above the Alento river valley and close to the gorges of Calore Lucano. It borders with the municipalities of Felitto, Laurino, Monteforte Cilento, Orria and Stio.[4] The municipality has two hamlets (frazioni), Capizzo and Magliano Nuovo.
