B.C. and other funerary finds of Roman imperial age here is that even here we confirm the presence of nuerosi peoples throughout the centuries from prehistoric times onwards.\n\nThe city center develops around St. Patrick’s Church today disappeared, its modern foundation is to be traced back in time dino year THOUSAND about when priccolo Turris Patritia center was built in the City, then he followed the administration Monks until 1258 and perhaps to them or to his Carolingian period we have the current name. In this same year Manfredi gave the small town to the nearby Fermo.\n\nIn 1414 it was besieged by the Dominion of Cesena Carlo Malatesta, but was little time that remained there under a possession, because already in 1416 the Fermana Brand returned to his possession.\n\nThese struggles between factions and municipalities and Lordships character actor rinasimentale this troubled period for all municipalities and towns of the territory.\n\nAt some point the people sought protection in the alliance with the Sforza family to escape from the dominance stop, but cone poor results.\n\nAfter the papal possession the small town of Torre San Patrizio was destroyed and later rebuilt right from Fermani.\n\nToday we can admire the Church of San Francesco a precious wooden crucifix of ‘500, the wooden art in vogue at the time and that was why a loaf now widely studied for its artistic importance and peculiarities second what is the style called Marche.\n\nInside, instead of the Church of Our Lady of the Roses is a fresco in 1446 by Pietro Alemano, a Madonna and Saints.\n\nValuable are the old city walls that distinguish all these ancient villages and villages style Medieval Hall and Torre San Patrizio also retains its dating back to 1300.\n\nThere you can ‘do not miss a visit to what is now become a public park, Villa Zara outside dall’aglomerato citizen.\n\nMonte San Pietrangeli\n\nPiazza Umberto I – 0734 969125\n\nThe first core of the town grew around the abbey founded in 1080 by the Benedictine monks of San Pietro Ferentillo (Terni).\n\nIn 1164 Frederick I donated it to the Canons of the Cathedral of Fermo. In the era of the struggles between Guelfi and Ghibellines he took refuge there the noble Florentine family of De Alleis whence primitive Latin name of S. Petri De Alleis. In 1443 the City Council, only in the Marches, resisted for more than a month siege of Francesco Sforza. It returned the orbit of Fermo, followed its vicissitudes.\n\nChurch of St. Francis already convent of Friars Minor by the quiet courtyard and the classic arcade. Baroque church from which rises a majestic bell tower. Inside keeps an altarpiece of the ‘500 attributed to Giuliano da Fano, some frescoes of popular art of the century and an organ Callido.\n\nPalazzo dei Priori, we note in the town theater built the tower in the fifteenth base has a small Gothic chapel rich in frescoes depicting the Annunciation of Our Lady.\n\nTown Hall retains Code parchment of municipal statutes dating back to 1482 written in Gothic minuscule (one of the few still in Italy); a precious icon of Mary of the late ‘500 and cineraria Roman family of Vezzi dating from the second century BC\n\nCorso Vittorio Emanuele II, 56-0734 631443\n\nThe first human settlements in the territory of Grottazzolina date from the eighth century BC\n\nTowards the middle of the tenth century A.D. was later built by the monks Farfensi the castle, the first settlement of the country, they called Montebello; shortly after he came under the domination of the Canons of the Cathedral of Fermo, which changed its name to “Cave of the Canons.” In 1208 Otto IV, elected emperor, granted to Azzo d’Estela March of Ancona. At his death, in 1217, ownership of the brand was confirmed by Pope Honorius III to his son Azzo VII (or Azzolino) who renamed the castle as “Cave Azzolina” that has remained unaltered.\n\nFrom the fourteenth century Grottazzolina is under the rule of the city of Fermo. In 1407 a thousand infantry and 1,500 cavalry, under the command of Benedict Bishop of Montefeltro, occupied the county of Fermo to expel the Lord Ludovico Improved, nep hew of Innocent VII. In 1465, after a period of relative quiet, for trivial reasons he lit a discord with the residents of Ponzano and Montegiberto. Reported to force peace by the senate stop, Grottazzolina was fortified by the Lord of Fermo Oliverotto Uffreducci, which will set up a cannon foundry one year before being made strangle Cesare Borgia.\n\nGrottazzolina erected a free municipality:\n\nFor the first time in 1537 when Pier Luigi Farnese, by order of Pope Paul III, occupied the city of Fermo fining and stripping it of all rights. Since 1600 Grottazzolina was governed, like other 47 castles, from the town of Fermo through Podestà and Vicars. After the battle of Castelfidardo became part of the Kingdom of Italy and since December 1860, when Vittorio Emanuele II took off in Fermo province unifying it with that of Ascoli Piceno, Grottazzolina became autonomous.\n\nChurches and castles:\n\nGrottazzolina castle ruins of the medieval castle and town walls (XIII century).

It was of great importance and was the subject of contention. Behind the walls of Monte Rinaldo, Ascoli up to the door, it was built i n the late fourteenth century Pievania S. Leonardo and S. Flaviano. The archaeological area of ​​”La Cuma”, surrounded by beautiful agricultural landscape, is one of the most valid reasons to visit Monte Rinaldo. Here there is a sanctuary that can rightly be considered one of the most important monuments of the Hellenistic period in the entire region. It ignores, for now, is the deity to whom it was dedicated, is the city from which it depended.\n\nArchaeological area (second century BC) The exploration, which began in 1957 and not yet over, has brought to light elements, partly reassembled, a porch along 66m. Many found objects of various kinds, such as: fixed wings, lamps, bronze statues and votive offerings related to the cult of the Goddess Cupra (for the Romans or Bona Bona Dea Mater). In the vicinity were found clay statues that adorned the pediment of the temple, traces of an inscription always referred to the worship of Jupiter. Research has shown parts with traces of fire dating back to the events of the Social War that was fought bitterly in soil Piceno.\n\nFrancavilla d’Ete\n\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele II, 34-0734 966131\n\nAt the origins the village of Francavilla d’Ete was made by Castle only equipped with six towers embattled “Guelph” with a single door, that what is now the clock, probably, if you look at the gap, it had to be drawbridge …\n\nThe current north gate, made from the floor of the town hall, was opened in 1775 under the name of Porta Nuova. The village life took place always neilimite Castle and, only when the time was propitious and safer life, the people came out and began to build in the streets. Thus arose the Borgo San Carlo and a row of buildings parallel to the south facade of the Town Hall and in continuation of the Palace of the Archbishops of Fermo, called “Palace of the Cardinal.”\n\nTown Hall located in the area which was the highest court of the castle dates back to a distant era. In the southwest corner is set one of the six towers of the castle dating back to 1140. The palace was always the seat of the rulers of the country (priori gonfalonieri, mayors, mayor) and was severely damaged by the earthquake of 1943. With the war going on, the lack of brick material and cementing, were only made repairs and rebuilt the roof eliminating the third floor.\n\nPublic clock is located in a compartment above the door to the south of the main square (the ancient door of the Castle) topped by an iron frame that holds the two bells of the hours and quarters.

In the fourteenth century the Muni Without a city wall with four towers, of which there are still some sections, east and west where you can see almost intact one of the towers near the port building. In the eighteenth century it was renewed profoundly according to a characteristic compact plant, simple but elegant, which brings together the town in a square from which branches off the streets and alleys. With the annexation of the Marches to the Kingdom of Italy (1860), Monte Giberto became a municipality in the state unit.\n\nOf great historical value is the organic heritage of the three churches, three organs of different authors of the most representative present in the Marche region: a Callido Gaetano, an Angel Morettini, a Vincenzo Paci. The concert starts itself as a viable tourist attraction.\n\nCity of Falerone\n\nPiazza Concordia, 6-0734 710750\n\nIn the sixth century BC the faleronesi are already in history definitely jealous guardians of their land so as to resist in arms to the Roman conquest (269 BC). Always reconstructing the path of their history; faleronesi in the 90 a. C. were alongside the army led by italic Vidacilio, Lafrenio and Ventidius, scattering the Roman army led by Pompey Strabo.

He slowly lifted to emerge around Mille as “Castrum Urbiani”, which would take its name, hypothesis, this, as opposed to one that would see the derivation of the name from “madder” (plant formerly widespread in the area). Castle Monterubbiano, although part of the Papal States, experienced the vicissitudes of the free communes. Its importance to the strategic position not lost on King Ladislas of Naples, Carlo Malatesta of Cesena and Ludovico Improved, ladies of Fermo, which if it fought from 1400 to 1433, when it fell under the rule of Francesco Sforza who extended and he fortified the perimeter of the castle walls (2 km).

Not far from the castle walls is the church of Santa Maria, Badia also, of the fifteenth century. Erected a free city under the aegis Badiale, around the first half of the twelfth century, this castle of the third class was almost always under the control of the bishops from Fermo. Under the Napoleonic Government its territory was divided into two areas: that of St. Philip, which included the territory to the south and that of Campofilone, the historic center and the Aso valley.\n\nCampofilone is a “common source monastic”, that is, in the twelfth and thirteenth century, the people of the countryside, to escape repeated raids of the barbarians and robbers, Abbot obtained permission to take refuge within the first circle of walls, under the protection of ‘Abbey and army Badiale.\n\nThe famous “macaroni”\n\nCharacterized by a very simple recipe and very special. The product comes as a set of thin wires as “angel hair”, are cut by hand with a sharp knife by people with particular experience and skills.\n\nThe macaroni Campofilone have a very old tradition: when the Marche was essentially a cuisine made of unique dishes, macaroni were already considered a noble dish, which was served on special occasions. Already in ‘400 are cited the “macaroni for purposes”. Over time it has become famous for the Festival that takes place in Fermo thousands of tourists every year in August.\n\nThe municipality of Sant’Elpidio a Mare\n\nPiazza Matteotti, 8-0734 8196201\n\nA long tradition traces its origins from the ashes of Cluana ancient Roman city at the mouth of the river Chienti, destroyed by the Goths in 410 AD.\n\nThe core dates back to the eleventh century and is set to flow\n\naround what veins called “Castle Sant’Elpidio”, in the territory of one of the oldest and most powerful Benedictine abbeys of the Marches, or Holy Cross Chienti to the ninth century.

The run lasted seven years (1770-1776) and were eventually delivered the magnificent paintings by Filippo Ricci representing the titular saints.\n\n“Small” shared by the “big” gastronomic qualities:\n\nThe typical dishes of the Marches, which vincisgrassi, noodles, rabbit stew, pork, offal, but everything seems to take more flavor. The slaughter of pigs born family: “ciauscoli”, loins and hams whose scents t’innebriano.

The oldest existing document in the Marches, dated 883 AD :, is a “diploma” by Carlo Grosso and speaks of that port.
