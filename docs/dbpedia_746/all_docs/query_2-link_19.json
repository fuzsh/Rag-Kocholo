        "text": "The toll is the amount the user has to pay for using the motorway. It is calculated by multiplying the Concessionaire’s unit tariff (€/km), increased by the amount chosen by ANAS, by the number of kilometres travelled, including the kilometres of junctions, slip roads and free motorway stretches before and after the tollbooth, built and managed by the Concessionaire; the amount obtained, increased by VAT, is rounded to the nearest 10 euro cents as governed by Interministerial Decree no. 10440/28/133 of 12/11/2001 of the Italian Ministry for Infrastructure and Transport and the Italian Ministry for Economy and Finance.\n\nThe unit tariff is commensurate with the characteristics of the motorway stretches (level or mountainous) and vehicle class (see Table) and is adjusted annually, by Decree of the Italian Ministry for Infrastructure and Transport in agreement with the Italian Ministry for Economy and Finance and on the basis of what is established in the Single Convention with MIT-SVCA, using a formula that takes into account 70% of the real inflation rate (NIC index) of the last 12 months (1 July-30 June) and the parameter relating to the return on new investments made.\n\nThe tariff adjustment is applied without any discretionary power on the part of Concessioni del Tirreno to all stretches within its remit; however, due to the final rounding, the toll for individual routes may be higher, lower or zero compared to the change in the unit tariff.\n\nAs per Ordinance no. 876 of 13 March 2022 of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, Civil Protection Department, exemption of the toll has been arranged for Ukrainian citizens arriving from Ukraine and persons coming from Ukraine, who enter Italy as a consequence of the current events.\n\nThe aforementioned exemption will be valid for up to 5 days from entry into Italian territory by those entitled to it.\n\nAt the time of transit out of the stations of the undersigned Company, giving preference to manual toll lanes, a duly completed and signed self-certification must be handed over to the collector; the relevant form (in Italian and English) can be downloaded by selecting the corresponding icons below.\n\nIn automatic toll lanes controlled by a remote monitoring operator, the user must collect the transit certificate and send it together with the self-certification to the e-mail address emergenzaucraina@cdtspa.it.\n\nExempt by Law\n\nPursuant to Article 373 of Italian Presidential Decree no. 495(2) of 16.12.1992, as amended, the following categories are exempt from paying the toll:\n\na) State Police vehicles with “Police” plates and A.N.A.S. vehicles with distinguishing marks;\n\nb) Carabinieri vehicles with C.C. number plates bearing an Italian Ministry of Defence registration certificate with the Carabinieri registration;\n\nc) Vehicles with C.R.I. number plates, as well as vehicles of voluntary associations and similar non-profit organisations, used for rescue in the performance of their specific service and provided with the appropriate sticker approved by decree of the Italian Minister for Transport and Navigation and Public Works;\n\nd) Vehicles with V.F. (Fire Brigade) plates, as well as those belonging to the permanent fire brigade of the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano;\n\ne) Vehicles with G.d.F. (Financial Police) plates;\n\nf) Vehicles with C.F.S. (State Forestry Corps) plates;\n\ng) Vehicles with POLIZIA PENITENZIARIA (Penitentiary Police) licence plates;\n\nh) Armed Forces vehicles used for rescue purposes (ambulances, tow trucks, etc.) in the course of duty or following motorcades;\n\ni) Armed Forces vehicles during emergency interventions and public disasters, as well as civil vehicles, with Italian or foreign licence plates, which, within the framework of bodies or organisations formally recognised by their respective States, following natural disasters or warlike events, transport basic necessities to aid the affected populations, provided that they have specific certification from the competent authorities;\n\nj) The vehicles of officials of the Italian Minister for the Interior, A.N.A.S., the General Directorate of the M.C.T.C., the General Inspectorate for Traffic and Road Safety, and the Italian Ministry for Public Works, authorised to carry out traffic police duties.\n\nVehicles with CP (Harbour Master’s Office) licence plates and mechanical rescue vehicles authorised to intervene by our Operations Centre are also exempt from paying the toll.\n\nSelf-declaration for requesting exemption and information\n\nIf the toll due (in whole or in part) is not paid, a non-payment report will be issued. The latter contains the vehicle’s data (class and number plate), the transit data (date, time, exit tollbooth and entry tollbooth, if available) and the amount to be paid.\n\nThe amount due must be paid, without any surcharge, no later than 15 days after the date of issue. If payment is made after this deadline, the amount will be increased by € 2.58 for collection costs (Art. 176(11-bis), New Italian Highway Code).\n\nIf the non-payment persists, the forcible debt collection procedure will be activated, with consequent increase of the costs to be borne by the debtor (Art. 373, Italian Highway Code).\n\nShould the non-payment report be issued for reasons not attributable to the customer, no surcharge will be applied to the toll due.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that: “For toll motorway users without an entry ticket, or who engage with the control facilities improperly with respect to the ticket in their possession, the toll to be paid shall be calculated from the farthest entry station, based on their vehicle class. Nonetheless, users have the right to prove their entry station.” (Article 176(16), Italian Highway Code)\n\nPayment can be made:\n\nonline by credit card (circuits accepted: Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, MyBank, Bancomat Pay, American Express) and Satispay App in the section Pay online;\n\nby bank transfer IBAN IT10T0623001001000042034179 – BIC CRPPIT2P120 – CREDIT AGRICOLE account in the name of Concessioni del Tirreno S.p.A.

A10 Stretch RMPP by entering the vehicle registration number and the number of the non-payment in the postal payment slip reference).\n\nIn the event of non-payment of the aforementioned amounts, the relevant documents may be forwarded to the relevant Traffic Police Reports Office, for consequent notification of administrative sanctions pursuant to Art. 176(11) and (21) of the Italian Highway Code, for ascertained breach of the obligation to pay a motorway toll (which envisages payment of a fine between € 87.00 and € 344.00, and the loss of 2 points from the offender’s driving licence).\n\nFor any further information, the Toll Office can be contacted via:\n\nE-mail: pedaggi.A10@cdtspa.it Tel: +39 0183 7070\n\nFax: +39 0183 295655"
