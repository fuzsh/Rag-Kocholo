Figuring out who to trust is stressful and hard.\n\nThat’s why we started 10Adventures Tours, we’re here to make it easy to find a great guide or tour operator. We handpick the best local guides and tour operators for 10Adventures, working to ensure you have great guides and a great trip.\n\nWe know it sucks to show up in a different country and find out the tents are junk, the guide incompetent or the route different from what we thought we were getting.\n\nWe want to give our users peace of mind that you’ll have a great trip and offer a guarantee that we will work with you to make it right.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nWell, if you feel that something about your trip didn’t’ meet your expectations, let us know. We will then work to gather the details and figure out where things went wrong. If something indeed wasn’t as described, or went wrong with your trip, and the problem was within the control of either oursleves, the guide or the tour company, we will then work out a refund with you that’s proportional to the scale of the problem.\n\nObviously the best way to make a great trip is to tell your local guide or tour operator and give them the chance to fix the solution while you are on your trip. Most things can be solved by telling your guide when the issue develops. If that doesn’t solve it, then email us right away.
