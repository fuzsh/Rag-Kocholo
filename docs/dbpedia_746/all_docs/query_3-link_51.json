An Acropolis built by the Focea colony coming from the coasts of Turkey, extending towards the east, the monumental Porta Rosa, the main entrance of the city and its walls to defend the Site, which rise on the vegetation of the Mediterranean scrub. Built at the end of the 6th century BC before being resumed and strengthened by towers in the Hellenistic age. In fact, in one of the extreme parts stands the Fortilizio di Castelluccio. In the highest areas, a series of terraces, places of worship, for outdoor sanctuaries, called Sacred Terraces (5th century BC). Next to the Acropolis, the Temple of Poseidon Asphaleios used for the cult of gods. A few tens of meters another Hellenistic Temple built between the 3rd century BC and the middle of the second century BC dedicated perhaps to Demeter, the goddess of the fields and harvests or better yet the goddess Mother Earth, but it is said that the cult was for Elea mythological figure. Instead, an imposing square is intended for public meetings, where Cippi dedicated to Zeus (5th century BC) are also found. Then follow the Hellenic Sanctuary Parmenides and Zenon founders of the presocratic philosophical school active in Elea. Archaeological site located in Ascea and Casal Velino, visited every year by thousands of tourists from all over the world, but still today a destination for many scholars and philosophers who come from all over to study the life of Parmenides and Zenon. The remains of Velia are always open to everyone, children do not pay, discounts for students. The best time to visit the site is undoubtedly spring and autumn. You can get there by land by car or even comfortably by train (train station 1 km away).\n\nscritto da Sheila Pickles - ultima modifica il 21/10/2021"
