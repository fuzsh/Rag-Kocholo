        "text": "Overview\n\nSan Gregorio Magno is located in an ethnographic region of Southern Italy with a unique form of folk music played on a specialized bagpipe called a Zampogna. The instrument is closely associated with the pastoral culture of the region and is played for secular purposes, such as the tarantella folk dance, as well as for religious devotion. San Gregorio Magno was recently featured in an independent documentary about this musical tradition entitled Zampogna: The Soul of Southern Italy."
