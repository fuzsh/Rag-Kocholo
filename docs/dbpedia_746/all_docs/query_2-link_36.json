        "text": "The motorway toll is determined by multiplying the kilometres attributed to each journey times the Concessionary Company’s unit tariff, plus any surcharges and taxes provided for by the regulations in force. The final amount of the toll is rounded up to the nearest ten cents (DIM No. 10440/28/133 of 12.01.2001 of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and the Ministry of Economy and Finance). Rounding is applied automatically, without any discretion on the Concessionary Company’s part.\n\nThe unit tariff is commensurate with the characteristics of the infrastructure (flat or mountainous) and the type of vehicle used, according to the classification system currently in use, known as ‘axle-shape’.\n\nEvery year, the tariff is adjusted according to the revision formula in force, by means of a Decree by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport in agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as set forth in the Single Convention between the Concessionary Company and the Granting Body.\n\nAs per Ordinance No. 876 of 13 March 2022 of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, Civil Protection Department, exemption of the toll for Ukrainian citizens coming from Ukraine and persons coming from Ukraine, who enter the national territory as a consequence of the current events, has been arranged.\n\nThe aforementioned exemption will be valid for up to 5 days from the entry into Italian territory of those entitled to it.\n\nAt the time of transit out of the stations of the undersigned Company, giving preference to manual toll lanes, a duly completed and signed self-certification must be handed over to the collector; the relevant form (in Italian and English) can be downloaded by selecting the corresponding icons below.\n\nIn automatic toll lanes controlled by a remote monitoring operator, the user must collect the transit certificate and send it together with the self-certification to the e-mail address emergenzaucraina@asticuneo.it.\n\nSELF-CERTIFICATION IN ITALIAN\n\nSELF-CERTIFICATION IN ENGLISH\n\nExempt by Law\n\nPursuant to Article 373 of Presidential Decree No. 495, paragraph 2 of 16/12/1992, as amended, the following categories are exempt from paying the toll:\n\na) State Police vehicles with ‘Police’ plates and A.N.A.S. vehicles with distinguishing marks;\n\nb) Carabinieri’s vehicles with C.C. number plates bearing a Ministry of Defence registration certificate with the Carabinieri’s registration;\n\nc) Vehicles with C.R.I. number plates, as well as vehicles of voluntary associations and similar non-profit organisations, used for rescue in the performance of their specific service and provided with the appropriate sticker approved by decree of the Minister of Transport and Navigation and Public Works;\n\nd) Vehicles with V.F. plates, as well as those belonging to the permanent fire brigade of the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano;\n\ne) Vehicles with G.d.F. plates;\n\nf) Vehicles with C.F.S. plates;\n\ng) Vehicles with PENITENTIAL POLICE licence plates;\n\nh) Armed Forces vehicles used for rescue purposes (ambulances, self-rescue, etc.) in the course of duty or following ambulances;\n\ni) Armed Forces vehicles during emergency interventions and public disasters, as well as civil vehicles, with Italian or foreign licence plates, which, within the framework of bodies or organisations formally recognised by their respective States, following natural disasters or warlike events, transport basic necessities to aid the affected populations, provided that they have specific certification from the competent authorities;\n\nj) The vehicles of officials of the Ministry of the Interior, A.N.A.S., the General Directorate of the M.C.T.C., the General Inspectorate for Traffic and Road Safety, and the Ministry of Public Works, authorised to carry out traffic police duties.\n\nVehicles with CP (Harbour Master’s Office) licence plates and mechanical rescue vehicles authorised to intervene by our Operations Centre are also exempt from paying the toll.\n\nVoluntary Associations\n\nPursuant to Article 373 of Presidential Decree of 16.12.1992, vehicles of voluntary associations and similar non-profit organisations, used for rescue in the performance of their specific service and provided with a corresponding sticker (which must be visibly displayed at the front of the vehicle), are exempt from toll payment.\n\nIt is also emphasised that, for the right to exemption to exist, all the following conditions must be fulfilled at the time of transit:\n\nThe vehicle must be registered in the name of the voluntary association or similar non-profit organisation\n\nThe vehicle must be used for rescue purposes\n\nThe vehicle must be engaged in the performance of the specific service\n\nThe vehicle must be provided with the appropriate sticker\n\nThe Circular of the Ministry of Public Works dated 05.08.1997, no. 3973, the Circular of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport dated 18.09.2014, no. 378, as well as the note of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, Struttura di Vigilanza sulle concessionarie autostradali, dated 02.10.2014, prot. no. 8758, illustrated the terms and methods to apply the aforementioned regulatory provision, providing that the exemption in favour of Voluntary Associations operates exclusively for emergency rescue/transportation, as well as for non-emergency transport of sick people free of charge.\n\nIn the presence of these conditions, voluntary associations can choose to define transit via Telepass devices (a) or in other ways (b).\n\n(a) The entire transaction shall be executed through the special web platform managed by the Telepass and Autostrade per l’Italia Companies, with reference to the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on the matter between all the Concessionary companies.\n\n(b) The toll collection staff is obliged to demand payment of the toll and, if not paid, a normal non-payment report shall be issued. If the voluntary association considers that the transit is exempt from the charge, it must ask the issuing Concessionary Company to cancel it, declaring under its own responsibility that it meets all the above requirements. Please note that the non-payment report will also be issued if the ambulance passes through without stopping at the toll station.\n\nIf the toll due (in whole or in part) is not paid, a non-payment report will be issued. The latter contains the vehicle’s data (class and number plate), the transit data (date, time, exit tollgate and entry tollgate, if available) and the amount to be paid.\n\nThe amount due must be paid, without any surcharge, no later than 15 days after the date of issue. If payment is made after the deadline, the amount will be increased by € 2.58 for collection costs (Art. 176/11 bis, New Highway Code).\n\nIf the non-payment persists, the enforced debt collection procedure will be activated, with consequent increase of the costs to be borne by the debtor (Art. 373 S.C.C.).\n\nShould the non-payment report be issued for reasons not attributable to the customer, no surcharge will be applied to the toll due.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that: ‘Toll motorway users without an entry ticket, or who engage the control facilities improperly with respect to the ticket in their possession, the toll to be paid shall be calculated from the farthest entry station, based on their vehicle class. Users have nonetheless the right to prove their entry station.’ (Article 176, paragraph 16, Highway Code).\n\nPayment can be made at:\n\nservice centres and in cash at participating motorway stations;\n\nall Post Offices, by bank transfer to account no. 85617942 made out to: AUTOSTRADA ASTI-CUNEO S.p.A., by specifying the vehicle licence plate number and the non-payment report number in the payment details;\n\nall Post Offices by bank transfer to POSTE ITALIANE IT29F0760110400000085617942 BIC SWIFT BPPIITRRXXX CIN F made out to: AUTOSTRADA ASTI-CUNEO S.p.A., by specifying the vehicle licence plate number and the non-payment report number in the payment details;\n\nonline by credit card and/or Satispay, at https://www.asticuneo.it/en/pay-online/(circuits accepted: Visa, Mastercard, Diners, American Express).\n\nIn the event of non-payment of the aforementioned amounts, the relevant documents may be forwarded to the Traffic Police Section’s Minutes Office, for consequent notification of administrative sanctions pursuant to Art. 176/para. 1https://www.asticuneo.it/paga-online/1 and 21, Highway Code, for ascertained breach of the obligation to pay the motorway toll (which provides for the payment of a penalty between € 87.00 to € 344.00, and the loss of 2 points from the actual offender’s driving licence).\n\nFor any further information, the Toll Office can be contacted via:\n\nEmail: pedaggi@asticuneo.it\n\nNumero Verde: 800.033.021"
