The above table is formed chiefly from a pamphlet, entitled \" Remarks on the Consumption of Public Wealth by the Clergy,\"- published in London in 1822. Some of the statements are of doubtful accuracy. According to the Edinburgh Review for June 1822, instead of one half of the population of England, or 6 millions, as above stated; two thirds, or 9 millions, belong to the established church. According to the New Edinburgh Encyclopedia, (vol. VIII, p. 623,) the annual income of the clergy of the church of England of all ranks, is supposed to amount to only about £3,000,00; and the average annual income of the parochial clergy does not exceed £100. According to Hassel and others, the Protestants in France are more numerous than above stated. See France. The ecclesiastical establishment of Ireland is the most wealthy and most burdensome to the inhabitants of any in Europe. The Catholics of that country, according to Beaufort, Newen- ham, and Wakefield, amount to at least five sixths of the inhabitants. The members of the established church, according to Wakefield, constitute only about a twentieth part ; and accord- ing to the Edinburgh Review, cannot at most exceed 500,000; yet there are 22 Protestant arch- bishops and bishops, whose aggregate annual revenue is estimated at £185,700, equal to $825,333, making the average annual income of each prelate $37,515. In the Catholic countries of Europe the wealth of the ecclesiastical establishments, and the number of ecclesiastics have been greatly diminished since the French revolution. In 1787, the clergy of France formed about one 52d part of the population ; and their annual income was estimated at £7,400.000. The real property belonging to the clergy of Spain before the revolu-. tion has been estimated at £186,500,000, exclusive of tithes and other taxes. — The following statement exhibits the number of ecclesiastics in the two countries before the revolution.

This town is built on a peninsula, or rather on a small island, which has an area of 106 square miles, and con- tains 33,800 inhabitants. The Portuguese for- tified the place, surrounded it with strong walls, and in a manner became masters of it. Macao has a Portuguese governor, and a Chinese man- darin ; and the English and other nations have factories here. The houses are of stone built , after the European manner, but they are low, i and make little show. The city is defended by ' three forts, built upon eminences; its works are j good and well planted with artillery. It was j formerly a place of the greatest importance, be- ing the centre of the trade of the Portuguese in the eastern part of Asia. Since the decline of the Portuguese trade, the town has sunk into a place of comparatively little importance. Macao, (New,) s-p. Tonquin, at the bottom of a large bay, full of islands. Lon. 107.

The town is large ; the houses are of wood, built on piles, to guard against inunda- tions. The country round about is level and beautiful, abounding with plantations and groves of cocoa-nut trees. At a distance inland the country rises into hills of great height, and becomes rude and mountainous.

The village at the East Falls is at the head of the tide, 2 m. above the junction of the two branches, and contains va- rious mills. This branch has a width of 35 rods to the falls.— The village at the West Falls, contains the county buildings, consisting of a court house, a jail, and a handsome dwelling house ; and has also various mills. The wes- tern branch,though narrow, is capable of admit- ting vessels of 250 tons, to within 50 rods ol the mills. Machias is a thriving town, and has consider- able trade. The exports which consist of boards, joist, shingles, clapboards, laths, spars, sawed and hewed timber, and fish, amount annually to upwards of 100,000 dollars. There are 26 saw-mills, which cut, on an average, upwards of 10,000,000 feet of boards in a year. The ship- ping belonging to this port, in 1816, amounted to 1,128 tons.

It is one of the largest islands in the world, and is remarkable for its fertility. The surface is greatly diversified, being intersected through- out its whole length by a chain of lofty moun- tains, the highest summits of which are said to be about 11,000 feet above the sea. The scene- ry of these mountains is often grand and pic- turesque. The forests abound in beautiful trees, as palms, ebony, wood for dyeing, bam- boos of enormous size, orange and lemon trees. The botany of the island is interesting ; iron mines abound in various parts ; other minerals are found : but the mineralogy of the island has been but little explored. The country is well watered by numerous streams mostly small, which descend from the mountains. In this ge- nial climate they produce a luxuriant fertility. Rice is the staple food of the inhabitants. Other productions are potatoes, sugar, silk, &c. The sheep produce fine wool. The cocoa nut, ban- ana, &c. flourish The inhabitants are of a variety of races, j much intermingled with each other ; but it is still possible to discover the race of real negroes, 1 having flat features and woolly hair. The lead- j ing classes, however, are of various shades ot white and olive. Some of these claim their de- scent from the Arabs, others from the Jews. The former profess the Mahometan religion. The Madagasses, who are not negroes, are of a complexion similar to that of the Indians. They are a thoughtless, gay, voluptuous people,impa tient of labour and of every thing that requires attention. Rochon enumerates 14 provinces or districts, occupied by different petty tribes. — Some ineffectual attempts have been heretofore made by Europeans to form settlements here. The London Missionary society has sent mis- sionaries to the island, and it has been annexed to the British empire as a dependency of Mau- ritius. Madah, t. Persia, Segestan; 24 S.Zareng.

The peasants are very poor, rude, and ignorant ; the hardest la- bour is performed by females. The religion is Catholic, MAD MAD The island consists of a collection of moun- tains, the most elevated of which is 5,068 feet high. The lower slopes are covered with vines, the loftier summits with forests of pine and ches- nut. A great part of the sides of the hills con- sists of abrupt precipitous rocks, supposed to be of volcanic formation. Most of the rocks along the coast are composed of a white lava. The productions, besides wine, are wheat, rye, su- gar, coffee, maize, kidney beans, arrow root, pine apples, &c. The great production is wine of well known excellence. The quantity annu- ally exported is differently stated from 15 to 40,000 pipes, one half of which goes to the Brit- ish settlements in the East and West Indies. The best vines grow on the south side of the isl- and. There are several varieties of wines ; the best is called London particular, the 2d London market, the 3d suited to the India mar- ket, the 4th for the New-York market, the 5th called cargo. London particular has been at the following rates ; in 1793 at 35/. per pipe ; in 1806 at 44/. ; and in 1811 at 54/. Adjacent to Madeira is the small island Porto Santo.

Madras Presidency. The territories subject to Fort George, or Madras, comprehend near- ly the whole of India south of the river This- trah, and also a large province in .the Deccan called the Northern Circars. Within these boun- daries are 3 native princes, the rajahs of Mysore, Travancore,and Cochin, who collect the revenue and exercise a certain degree of authority, but with respect to external politics, are entire- ly dependent on the British government. The rest of the country is under the immediate ju- risdiction of the governor and council at Madras. It is divided into the following districts, Arcot, Bellary, Canara, Chingleput, Chittoie, Coim- betore, Combaconura, Cuddapa, Ganjam, Gun- toor, Madras, Madura, Malabar North, Mala- bar South, Masulipatam, Nellore, Rajahmun- dry, Salem, Seringapatam, Tanjore, Tinne- velley, Tritchinopoly, Verdachellum, and Viza- gapatam, over each of which there is a Europe- an judge and collector.

Lat. 13. 5. N. Pop. in 1794, estimated at 300,000 ; supposed to have increased since. It was founded in 1640, on a small territory 5 miles long, and 1 broad. Its position is very unfor- tunate, being situated on a flat sandy shore, where the surf runs with extreme violence, and is surrounded by salt water creeks, or rivers, which prevents the introduction of a stream of fresh water into the town. The soil in the vi- cinity is very poor. It was taken by the French in 1744, and restored to the British in 1749, since which it has been gradually increased and improved, and it is now one of the strongest for- tresses in India. All the offices of government, and courts of justice are in the fort, which is called Fort St. George ; but the governor and all the principal inhabitants have houses at a short distance in the country where they mostly reside. The nabob of the Carnatic has also a palace called Chepauk, situated on the Choul- try plain, a short distance from the esplanade. The native, or black town, is situated about a mile to the north of the fort. It is surrounded with fortifications sufficient to repel a sudden attack. It has some good streets and bazars, but the houses are very irregular ; some of them are large brick buildings with flat roofs ; but the greater part are built of mud, with tiled roofs. Madias carries on a considerable trade, not only with Europe, but with China, Ceylon, Pegu, the isle of France, New Holland, &c. — The government is subordinate, in political mat- ters, to the supreme government of Bengal, but carries on all the other departments of a regular state. It consists of a governor and 3 members of council. The salary of the supreme judge is 6,000/. per annum, of the puisne judges 5,000Z. each. A college has lately been established here for instructing the junior servants in the native language. Several missionaries are sup- ported here by the Church, London, and Metho- dist missionary societies. The climate is very hot, but not esteemed unhealthy. The medium heat of the year is stated at 80°9 ; the medi- um of January at 75°1 ; of June 85°9. Mudre de Dios, isl. in the S. Pacific Ocean, near the coast of Patagonia, 180 miles in circ.

This town was originally laid out on an exten- sive plan, and with the expectation of its becom- ing a great city, but is only a small decayed village. It is built on ground somewhat higher than the ordinary bank of the Mississippi, but is, however, exposed to the ravages of the river, and is also environed both above and below with stagnant muddy creeks. The surrounding country is singularly fertile and productive.

It is situated in a large plain, on several eminences, S.nd is 2,200 feet above the level of the sea, being the most elevated capital in Europe. Seen at a distance, it presents nothing that an- nounces a great city, and the environs being destitute of wood, and even of vines, while most of the villages are in hollows, the prospect is uncommonly dreary. On drawing near the prospect is more cheerful. The city is of an oblong form, about 6 miles in circuit, surrounded by a high earthen wall, but has no ditch, or any other means of defence. The old streets are narrrow and crooked, but many others are wide, straight, and handsome They are paved, kept clean, and lighted. The city has 15 gates, 42 squares mostly small, 506 streets, 77 churches, 75 convents, 8 colleges, and 18 hospitals, 65 public edifices, 17 foun- tains, and several promenades. The private houses are uniform, generally low, with grated windows, and have little striking in their exteri- or. The churches are less magnificent than in several other cities in Spain. There are 2 pal- aces on a large scale, the Palacio Real at the western extremity, and the Buen Retiro at the eastern. The Palacio Real is of a square form, extending each way 404 feet, 86 feet high ; the inclosed court 120 feet square. It is strongly built, the exterior elegantly ornamented, and it contains a collection of paintings of tha best masters of Flanders, Italy, and Spain. The royal library contains about 130,000 volumes, and 2,000 MSS. The great school of Madrid has 16 masters who teach the various arts and sciences. There is another seminary on an equally extensive plan for the sons of the no- bility and gentry. There are academies for the study of the several fine arts; a botanic garden, and a variety of charitable institutions. In the vicinity are several royal residences. Before the French revolution there was only one ga- zette published in Spain. In 1820 there were 25 newspapers and periodical journals published in this city.— Natives, Lopez de la Vega, Que- vedo Velegas, and Erzilla. Madrigal, t. Spain, Old Castile ; 27 N. Avilla.

Near the town, in a san- dy and barren place, King John V. erected a building of extraordinary magnificence. It is constructed of a kind of white marble ; contains 37 windows in front, and is nearly a square of 728 feet ; the church is placed in the centre of the fabric, having the palace on one side and the convent on the other. It was begun in 1717, and finished in 1742 ; there are 300 cells in the convent, each of 20 palms or feet, by 18 ; the kitchen is 96 palms by 42 ; the new library is 383 palms in length, and 43 in breadth. In the whole building, the printed account assures us that there are 870 rooms, and 5,200 windows. The palace is not furnished, as the king seldom resides here. The palace includes a college, which has a library of 40 or 50,000 volumes, and a fine mathematical apparatus. Mafmala, small isl; in the Indian sea, near the coast of Africa. Lat. 16. 20.

The city of Magadoxo is a place of great commerce, and vast resort from the kingdoms of Aden, and oth- er parts ; whence their merchants bring cotton, silk, and other cloths, spices, and variety of drugs, which they exchange with the inhabitants for gold, ivory, wax, and other commodities.

The streets are wide, the mosques painted white, and the houses better than in most other towns in this part of Natolia. It is situated at the foot of the ancient Mount Sipylus, whose top is always covered with snow. This town was by the Persian monarch given to Themistocles to find him bread. Under John Ducas, it was made the capital of the Greek empire. The greatest ornament of the ancient town was a temple of Diana, called Leucophryene, or the Whitc-browed. Tlvc environs were formerly celebrated for the production of loadstone, and it is supposed the word magnet is derived from it. Magnisi, peninsula of Sicily, on E. coast, in the valley of Nolo ; 6 N.

Mahratta Territory, extensive country, Hind., which till recently extended across the peninsu- la of India, and is possessed by the Peshvva, whose capital is Poonah, Nagpore rajah, Scin- MAI 13 MAI die, Holcar, Guicowar, avid a few other inferior chiefs. Pop. estimated at 6,000,000. Geographic- al sq. m. 75,000. But little is known respecting the history of the Mahrattas till the beginning of the 17th cen- tury. Their original territory is said to have been Candeish. The first person that raised this nation from obscurity was Sevajec, born about 1626. His grandson Sahoo Rajah whose reign commenced about 1689, and continued nearly 50 years, extended his dominions from sea to sea, and from the province of Agra to Cape Comorin. He was succeeded by his son Ram Rajah, a weak prince, who was confined by his two chief officers, who divided the empire between them, one fixing his residence at Poo- nah, the other at Nagpore. Within a few years the descendant of Ram Rajah has been placed on the throne at Poonah. The Mahrattas are Hindoos, but except the Brahmins, not very scrupulous of what they eat. Their whole army, till lately, was composed of cavalry ; never formidable as a regular force, but depending more on the celerity of their mo- tions, and sudden incursions, than in boldly meeting their enemy : they marched at the rate of 50 miles a day. The common people are se- mi-barbarous, but the Brahmins are polished and insidious ; many of them are merchants. Mahrauzedurgam, t. Hind, in Mysore ; 6 NNE. Kistnagheri.

Education. There is a college at Brunswick, literary and theological seminaries at Water- ville and Bangor, and about 20 academies in the state. Common schools are supported by law. Religion. The Congregationalists had, in 1817, 115 chh., the Baptists 112 chh., and the Quakers 32 meetings. The Methodist are nu- merous, and there are a few Episcopalians, and a few of some other denominations. Rivers, bays, and lakes. The principal rivers are the Penobscot, Kennebeck, Androscoggin^ Saco, St. Croix, and St. Johns. The principal bays are Casco, Penobscot, Frenchman's, Eng- lishman's, Machias, and Passamaquoddy. The most noted lakes are Moosehead, Umbagog, Se- bago, Schoodic, and several others farther in the interior. Face of the country . Maine is rather an ele- vated country, having generally a diversified surface. A tract commencing on the west side of the district, east of the White Mountains in N. H., and holding a northeast direction as far as the heads of the Aroostic, about 160 m. in length, and 60 in its greatest breadth, is moun- tainous. Katahdin mountain is the most elevat- ed summit in this range. There is also a small mountainous tract in the northern extremity. The remainder of the state may be considered, generally, as a moderately hilly country. Soil and productions. The tract of country along the sea coast from 10 to 20 miles wide em- braces all the varieties of sandy, gravelly, clay- ey, and loamy soils, frequently interspersed at short distances ; seldom very rich, in many places tolerably fertile, but generally poor. Of this section Indian corn, rye, barley, grass, &c. are the principal productions. In the tract ly- ing north of this, and extending 50 miles from the sea in the western, 80 in the central, and 90 in the eastern part, the same kinds of soil ar-2 found, but they are less frequently diversified, and generally more fertile. The surface rises into large swells of generally good soil, between which, on the margin of the streams, are fre- quently rich intervals, and in other places sandy or gravelly pine plains, or spruce and cedar swamps. Of this section the principal produc- tions are grass, Indian corn, wheat, barley, rye, flax, &c. The country beyond the limits above specified, is but little settled. It exhibits great diversities in the appearance of its soil, growth of timber, and also in climate. The land on the Kennebeck, and between this river and the Penobscot, is accounted the best in the state. It is well adapted to the various purposes of agri- culture, and as a grazing country, it is one of the finest in New England. Climate. Though the climate of Maine is subject to great extremes of heat and cold, yet the air in all parts of the country is pure and salubrious. The summers in most parts are favourable to the growth of all the vegetable productions of the northern states. In some parts, however, Indian corn and some other plants of a more tender kind, are frequently in- jured,and sometimes destroyed, by frosts late in the spring and early in the autumn. The cold of winter is severe yet the serenity of the sky, and the invigorating influence of the atmosphere, during the same season, make amends, in some degree, for the severity of the weather. Commerce. Maine enjoys great facilities for commerce. The coast is indented with bays, abounding in excellent harbours. All the set- tled parts of the country lie near a market, and the produce of the farmer is readily exchanged for money, at a good price. The principal arti- cle of export is timber. Vast quantities of boards, shingles, clapboards, masts, spars, &c. are transported to the neighbouring states, to the West Indies, and to Europe. Much of the fire- wood consumed in Boston, Salem, &c. is brought from Maine. Dried fish and pickled salmon are considerable articles of export. Beef, pork, butter, pot and pearl ashes, and some grain are also among the exports. Great quantities of lime are annually exported from Thorn ?.stoivn. MAI MAK Limestone and bog iron ore abound in many places. Manufactures. The principal manufactures consist of cotton and woollen cloths, hats, shoes, boots, leather, iron, nails, distilled spirits, and cordage. Maine, see Maync. Maine, or Mayne, (an. M<mus,) r.

Sq. m. 1,410. Pop. in 1797, 140,699 ; 3,700 priests, -monks, and nuns. Towns, Palma, the capital, Pollonza, Soler, St. Martial, Andracio, Bulonia, and Alcudia. It is almost surrounded by a chain of moun- tains, a branch of which penetrates towards the centre. The climate is generally temperate, the heat of surnjner being moderated by sea breezes ; but it is somewhat subject to violent storms. The soil is fertile, but agriculture is very back- ward. Vines, orange trees, olive trees, carob trees, plane trees, &c. flourish. The principal exports consist of olive oil, wine, spirits, oranges, lemons, almonds, cheese, capers, and beans. — Corn is not raised in sufficient quantity to supply the inhabitants. Game is abundant ; venomous serpents hardly known; horned cattle email; hogs and sheep large. Coral is obtained in the bay of Alcudia. The inhabitants are said to resemble the Catalonians. People of rank speak Spanish ; the common people a medley of Limo- sin, Greek, Latin, Spanish, and Arabic. Majorca, see Palma. Major's Bay, bay of the island of St. Christo- pher. Lon.62.22. W.

Hind, on the western coast, be- tween 10 & 13 deg. N. Lat. bounded N. by Ca- nara, E. by the Western Gauts, S/ by Cochin, and W. by the sea ; 155 miles long, 35, on an average, broad. The principal towns are Cali- cut, Tellichcrry, and Cananore. The province is under the government of Madras, and is di- vided into two collectorships. The revenue, in 1817, amounted 250,000/. The part bordering on the sea is level, and the soil poor ; the other part is hilly ; and the soil in the valleys & of some of the hills, is very fertile, abounding in timber, sandal wood, cocoa nuts, coir, and black pepper. Vasco de Gama landed at Calicut in 1498. Pre- vious to this there were several colonies of orien- tal Christians, Jews, and Mahometans, estab- lished in Malabar ; each have greatly increased, though the bulk of the inhabitants are still Hin- doos. The descendants of the Portuguese, and converts to the Roman Catholic religion, are nu- merous, but are not on good terms with the ori- ental or Nestorian christians. — The name Mal- abar is frequently applied to the western coast of Hindoostan from Cape Comorin to about 100 m. S.Goa, and also the western coast indefinite- ly ; the opposite or eastern coast, being styled Coromandel. Malabrigo, s-p. Peru, in Truxillo ; 36 NE. Guamhiro. Lat. 7. 48. S. Malacatlan, t.

Malacca, or Malaya, country of India beyond the Ganges, consisting of a large peninsula, con- nected with Siam by the Isthmus of Kraw, which is about 75 miles broad. In all other places it is surrounded by the sea. It is about 775 miles long, and 120, on an average, broad. It is trav- ersed throughout by a chain of lofty mountains, and is covered with extensive forests & marshes, so that it is difficult to penetrate into the interior. The fruits are excellent and plentiful, but grain is not produced in sufficient quantity to supply the inhabitants. Its political condition alternates between a dependence upon Siam, and a divi- sion into a number of petty independent states. The principal divisions are Kraw, Queda, Pera, Salengore, Malacca Proper, Rumbo, Johore, Tringano, Packanga, and Patany. The Ma- lays are Mahometans ; much addicted to piracy ; in their disposition daring, restless, ferocious, and vindictive ; to enemies rcmorseless,to friends capricious, and to strangers treacherous. Gam- ing is common among them. Their language, however, is distinguished above all others in the east for its softness and smoothness. The in- habitants of the interior are considered a dis- tinct race, conceived to be the original inhabi- tants. Malacca, s-p. Sz capital of the above country, on the western coast, and on the straits of Ma- lacca. Lon. 102. 12. E. Lat. 2. 14. N. Pop. stated some years since at 12,000. Many of the houses are well built of stone, and there are several spacious and handsome streets. The surrounding country is fertile and pleasant. — There is a good roadstead about 1 1-2 m. distant from the town, but the entrance of the river by boats is difficult. The exports are tin, sago, MAL i? MAL pepper, canes, elephants' teeth, and gold dust.— This place was once possessed by the Portuguese, afterwards by the Dutch, till 1795, when it was subjected by a British force, and afterwards dis- mantled. Since the formation of the settlement at Pulo Pinang, its commercial importance is al- most entirely lost.

It is situated at the head of a deep bay, with a large plain to the north, while on the east and west it is sheltered by lofty mountains. The port is capable of con- taining about 400 vessels, and is one of the best artificial harbours in the world, and affords suf- ficient depth of water for ships of the line to lie close to the pier. The streets, as in other Moorish towns, are very narrow, the houses large, the public build- ings much obscured by private houses, and the city does not contain a good square. The most cons"
