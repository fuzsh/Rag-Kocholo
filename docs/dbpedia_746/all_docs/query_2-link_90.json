The Cilento Natural Park runs through this province and the natural beauty of this area will take your breath away. Verdant green hills and plains with forests of oak, chestnut, beech and ash trees form a haven for flora and fauna. In the Vallo di Diano Wild orchids, some very rare, grow in abundance and it is possible to book a trip to see them growing naturally and of course to photograph them if you wish.\n\nIf anything, the coastline is even more beautiful than the interior with white sand, azure sea, small bays and coves, cliffs with historic towns clinging to their sides and of course, the world famous Amalfi coast which belongs to this province.\n\nSalerno\n\nSalerno is a city south of Naples, and the capital of the province of the same name in Campania. It is located in the Gulf of Salerno at the eastern end of the famous 'Amalfi Coast' and covers an area of 59 square kilometres. The population is around 140,000 people. Salerno has been a lively city and important trading center throughout history. In the mid 10th century, the Duke of Benevento, Arechis II, established the first medical school in the world, the Scuola Medica Salernitana, in Salerno which was to become a great centre of learning and culture in the centuries that followed. By the 11th century, Salerno was a powerful principality, ruling over much of southern Italy.\n\nAgropoli\n\nThis seaside town lies at the beginning of the Cilento Coast and has a large yacht harbour, mainly for pleasure craft.

It is located just outside the town walls and can be reached by a flight of stairs.\n\nThe Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was built in 1601 with a Moorish style bell tower.\n\nThe Church of San Salvatore de'Birecto was built in the 10th century.\n\nCastel San Lorenzo\n\nNestled on top of hill in the centre of the beautiful Cileno Natural Park the village of Castel San Lorenzo is famous for its locally made Castel San Lorenzo DOC wine.
