BIANCHINI\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT Mentha pulegium (Lamiaceae tea has been used as a traditional medicine; however, the modulatory effect of M. pulegium extracts on damage to human erythrocytes associated to t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP exposure remains to be investigated. Accordingly, we perform this study in order to test the hypothesis that aqueous and ethanolic extracts of M. pulegium could modulate the hemolysis associated to t-BHP exposure, non-protein thiol (NPSH oxidation and lipid peroxidation (measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances - TBARS in human erythrocytes. Samples were co-incubated with t-BHP (4 mmol/L and/or aqueous or ethanolic extracts (10-1000 mg/mL during 120 min to further analysis. We found that both extracts, when associated to t-BHP, potentiate NPSH oxidation and hemolysis. Moreover, both extracts significantly prevents against t-BHP-induced TBARS production. A significant correlation among hemolysis and NPSH levels was found. Taking together, our data points that the association of M. pulegium extracts with t-BHP culminates in toxic effect to exposed erythrocytes, besides its protective effect against t-BHP-induced TBARS production. So, we infer that the use of this extract may exert negative effect during painful crisis in sickle cell anemia. However, more studies are still necessary to better investigate/understand the mechanism(s involved in the toxic effect resultant from this association.\n\nClotrimazole enhances lysis of human erythrocytes induced by t-BHP.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLisovskaya, Irene L; Shcherbachenko, Irina M; Volkova, Rimma I; Ataullakhanov, Fazoil I\n\n2009-08-14\n\nClotrimazole (CLT) is an antifungal and antimalarial agent also effective as a Gardos channel inhibitor. In addition, CLT possesses antitumor properties. Recent data provide evidence that CLT forms a complex with heme (hemin), which produces a more potent lytic effect than heme alone. This study addressed the effect of CLT on the lysis of normal human erythrocytes induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). For the first time, it was shown that 10 microM CLT significantly enhanced the lytic effect of t-BHP on erythrocytes in both Ca(2+)-containing and Ca(2+)-free media, suggesting that the effect is not related to Gardos channels. CLT did not affect the rate of free radical generation, the kinetics of GSH degradation, methemoglobin formation and TBARS generation; therefore, we concluded that CLT does not cause additional oxidative damage to erythrocytes treated with t-BHP. It is tempted to speculate that CLT enhances t-BHP-induced changes in erythrocyte volume and lysis largely by forming a complex with hemin released during hemoglobin oxidation in erythrocytes: the CLT-hemin complex destabilizes the cell membrane more potently than hemin alone. If so, the effect of CLT on cell membrane damage during free-radical oxidation may be used to increase the efficacy of antitumor therapy.\n\nIn vitro and in vivo hepatoprotective effect of ganodermanontriol against t-BHP-induced oxidative stress\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHa, Do Thi; Oh, Joonseok; Khoi, Nguyen Minh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nthe evaluation of hepatoprotective activity of ganodermanontriol, a sterol isolated from Ganoderma lucidum, and the investigation of its mechanism of action in Hepa1c1c7 and murine liver cells upon tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced inflammation. t-BHP was utilized to stimulate an anti...... were monitored to assess whether GDT protected the cells from the t-BHP-mediated oxidative stimuli. RESULTS: GDT induced HO-1 expression via the activation of Nrf-2 nuclear translocation and the subsequent transcription of the HO-1 gene in vitro and in vivo, which seemed to be regulated...... the ethnopharmacological application of Ganoderma lucidum as a treatment for hepatic disorders. GDT induced in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in t-BHP-damaged hepatic cells through the expression of HO-1, and in which PI3K/Akt and p38 kinases are involved. Our study motivates further research...\n\nRedox Regulation of the Tumor Suppressor PTEN by Hydrogen Peroxide and Tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYing Zhang\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Organic peroxides and hydroperoxides are skin tumor promoters. Free radical derivatives from these compounds are presumed to be the prominent mediators of tumor promotion. However, the molecular targets of these species are unknown. Phosphatase and tensin homologs deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN are tumor suppressors that play important roles in cell growth, proliferation, and cell survival by negative regulation of phosphoinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling. PTEN is reversibly oxidized in various cells by exogenous and endogenous hydrogen peroxide. Oxidized PTEN is converted back to the reduced form by cellular reducing agents, predominantly by the thioredoxin (Trx system. Here, the role of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP in redox regulation of PTEN was analyzed by using cell-based and in vitro assays. Exposure to t-BHP led to oxidation of recombinant PTEN. In contrast to H2O2, PTEN oxidation by t-BHP was irreversible in HeLa cells. However, oxidized PTEN was reduced by exogenous Trx system. Taken together, these results indicate that t-BHP induces PTEN oxidation and inhibits Trx system, which results in irreversible PTEN oxidation in HeLa cells. Collectively, these results suggest a novel mechanism of t-BHP in the promotion of tumorigenesis.\n\nn-BA/KOH/t-BHP behaviour in the natural rubber latex vulcanization by gamma rays\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSouza, A. de.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nNatural rubber latex was vulcanized in the absence and in the presence of sensitizer (S), with gamma ray from 60 Co source, panoramic type, at the dose rate range of 1,20-1,33 kGy/h. The components of used S were n-butyl acrylate (n-BA), the KOH as stabilizer and t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) as co-S. The purpose of this work was to study the efficiency and the behaviour of each component of S in the irradiated latex crosslinking by tensile strength (T b ), volume fraction and permanent set. In the absence of S occur straight crosslinking between macromolecular adjacent radicals. IN the presence of S, the n-BA participates in the crosslinking through acrylic bridges between macromolecules.

Different fractions of C. spinosa were examined for total phenolic content and antioxidant property. Among these fractions, hydroalcoholic extract was used to assess the hepatoprotective effect in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP induced hepatotoxicity model by determining serum biochemical markers, sleeping time and antioxidant assay such as reduced glutathione (GSH as well as histopathological examination of liver tissues. The total phenolic and Quercetin contents of hydroalcoholic fraction were significantly higher than other fractions. It also showed high antioxidant activity. Pretreatment with hydroalcoholic fraction at the dose of 400Â mg/kg and Quercetin at the dose of 20Â mg/kg showed liver protection against t-BHP induced hepatic injury, as it was evident by a significant decrease in serum enzymes marker, sleeping time and MDA and an increase in the GSH, SOD and CAT activities confirmed by pathology tests. The final results ascertained the hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of C.Â spinosa and Quercetin in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, this study suggests that possible mechanism of this protection may be associated with its property of scavenging free radicals which may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds.\n\nProtective Effects of Alkaloid Compounds from Nelumbinis Plumula on tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide-Induced Oxidative Stress\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZe-Bin Guo\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Nelumbinis Plumula total alkaloid (NPA and its main alkaloid components on oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP in the human hepatocellular HepG2 cell line. According to HPLC analysis, several major alkaloid compounds such as liensinine, isoliensinine and neferine were present in NPA. The cytotoxic effects in 0.55 mM t-BHP-induced HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited by NPA and the major compound in NPA, neferine, showed the strongest activities. The protective effect of neferine against oxidative stress induced by t-BHP may be associated with decreased ROS formation, TBARS generation, LDH release and increased GSH levels, suggesting their involvement of the cytoprotective on oxidative stress. The effects were comparable with quercetin, which was used as positive control. Overall, total alkaloid and alkaloid compounds from Nelumbinis Plumula displayed a significant cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress. Further study is needed to elucidate the relationship between the chemical structures of the components in NPA and their protective effect on oxidative stress.\n\nSalvianic acid A sodium protects HUVEC cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide induced oxidative injury via mitochondria-dependent pathway.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJia, Dan; Li, Tian; Chen, Xiaofei; Ding, Xuan; Chai, Yifeng; Chen, Alex F; Zhu, Zhenyu; Zhang, Chuan\n\n2018-01-05\n\nSalvianic acid A (Danshensu) is a major water-soluble component extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), which has been widely used in clinic in China for treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of salvianic acid A sodium (SAAS) against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) oxidative injury and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In the antioxidant activity-assessing model, SAAS pretreatment significantly ameliorated the cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by t-BHP. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) based-metabolic profiling was developed to investigate the metabolic changes of HUVEC cells in response to t-BHP and SAAS. The results revealed that t-BHP injury upregulated 13 metabolites mainly involved in tryptophan metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism which were highly correlated with mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, and 50Â Î¼M SAAS pretreatment effectively reversed these metabolic changes. Further biomedical research indicated that SAAS pretreatment reduced the t-BHP induced increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the decrease of key antioxidant enzymes through mitochondria antioxidative pathways via JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3Î² signalings. Taken together, our results suggested that SAAS may protect HUVEC cells against t-BHP induced oxidative injury via mitochondrial antioxidative defense system. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Attenuates t-BHP-Induced Oxidative Stress Injury in HepG2 Cells through Antioxidant and Antiapoptosis Activities\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYiran Sun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS in the body are a key factor in the development of hepatopathies such as hepatitis. The aim of this study was to assess the antioxidation effect in vitro and hepatoprotective activity of the active fragment of Veronica ciliata Fisch. (VCAF. Antioxidant assays (DPPH, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals scavenging were conducted, and hepatoprotective effects through the application of tert-butyl hydroperoxide- (t-BHP- induced oxidative stress injury in HepG2 cells were evaluated. VCAF had high phenolic and flavonoid contents and strong antioxidant activity. From the perspective of hepatoprotection, VCAF exhibited a significant protective effect on t-BHP-induced HepG2 cell injury, as indicated by reductions in cytotoxicity and the levels of ROS, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, and protein carbonyls. Further study demonstrated that VCAF attenuated the apoptosis of t-BHP-treated HepG2 cells by suppressing the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. Moreover, it significantly decreased the levels of ALT and AST, increased the activities of acetyl cholinesterase (AChE, glutathione (GSH, superoxide dismutase (SOD, and catalase (CAT, and increased total antioxidative capability (T-AOC. Collectively, we concluded that VCAF may be a considerable candidate for protecting against liver injury owing to its excellent antioxidant and antiapoptosis properties.\n\nGymnaster koraiensis and its major components, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and gymnasterkoreayne B, reduce oxidative damage induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide or acetaminophen in HepG2 cells\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEun Hye Jho\n\n2013-10-01\n\nFull Text Available We investigated the protective effects of Gymnaster koraiensisagainst oxidative stress-induced hepatic cell damage. We usedtwo different cytotoxicity models, i.e., the administration oftert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP and acetaminophen, in HepG2cells to evaluate the protective effects of G. koraiensis. The ethylacetate (EA fraction of G. koraiensis and its major compound,3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (DCQA, exerted protective effectsin the t-BHP-induced liver cytotoxicity model. The EA fractionand DCQA ameliorated t-BHP-induced reductions in GSHlevels and exhibited free radical scavenging activity. The EAfraction and DCQA also significantly reduced t-BHP-inducedDNA damage in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the hexane fractionof G. koraiensis and its major compound, gymnasterkoreayne B(GKB, exerted strong hepatoprotection in the acetaminopheninducedcytotoxicity model. CYP 3A4 enzyme activity wasstrongly inhibited by the extract, hexane fraction, and GKB. Thehexane fraction and GKB ameliorated acetaminophen-inducedreductions in GSH levels and protected against cell death.

Ajuwon\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The possible protective effects of an aqueous rooibos extract (Aspalathus linearis, red palm oil (RPO (Elaeis guineensis, or their combination on tert-butyl-hydroperoxide-(t-BHP-induced oxidative hepatotoxicity in Wistar rats were investigated. tert-butyl hydroperoxide caused a significant (P<0.05 elevation in conjugated dienes (CD and malondialdehyde (MDA levels, significantly (P<0.05 decreased reduced glutathione (GSH and GSHâ:âGSSG ratio, and induced varying changes in activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase in the blood and liver. This apparent oxidative injury was associated with histopathological changes in liver architecture and elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH. Supplementation with rooibos, RPO, or their combination significantly (P<0.05 decreased CD and MDA levels in the liver and reduced serum level of ALT, AST, and LDH. Likewise, changes observed in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and impairment in redox status in the erythrocytes and liver were reversed. The observed protective effects when rooibos and RPO were supplemented concomitantly were neither additive nor synergistic. Our results suggested that rooibos and RPO, either supplemented alone or combined, are capable of alleviating t-BHP-induced oxidative hepatotoxicity, and the mechanism of this protection may involve inhibition of lipid peroxidation and modulation of antioxidants enzymes and glutathione status.\n\nLico A Enhances Nrf2-Mediated Defense Mechanisms against t-BHP-Induced Oxidative Stress and Cell Death via Akt and ERK Activation in RAW 264.7 Cells\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHongming Lv\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Licochalcone A (Lico A exhibits various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative potential and mechanisms of Lico A against tert-butyl hydroperoxide- (t-BHP- induced oxidative damage in RAW 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that Lico A significantly inhibited t-BHP-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS generation and reduced glutathione (GSH depletion but increased the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM subunit and the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC subunit genes expression. Additionally, Lico A dramatically upregulated the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, which were associated with inducing Nrf2 nuclear translocation, decreasing Keap1 protein expression and increasing antioxidant response element (ARE promoter activity. Lico A also obviously induced the activation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK, but PI3K/Akt and ERK inhibitors treatment displayed clearly decreased levels of LicoA-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 expression, respectively. Furthermore, Lico A treatment markedly attenuated t-BHP-induced oxidative damage, which was reduced by treatment with PI3K/Akt, ERK, and HO-1 inhibitors. Therefore, Lico A might have a protective role against t-BHP-induced cytotoxicity by modulating HO-1 and by scavenging ROS via the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK/Nrf2 signaling pathways.\n\nInteraction between t-butyl hydroperoxide (I) and positive halogenÂ compounds. part I.

However, few studies have examined the antioxidant capacities of A. vera plants during different growth periods. In order to investigate the effects of growth on antioxidant activity, A. vera was prepared from 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 12-month-old aloe. The extracts from 6-month-old A. vera showed the highest contents of flavonoids (9.750 mg catechin equivalent/g extract) and polyphenols (23.375 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract) and the highest ferric reducing antioxidant power (0.047 mM ferrous sulfate equivalent/mg extract). The extract from 6-month-old A. vera exhibited the highest free radical scavenging potential, and the lowest IC50 values were found for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (0.26 mg/ml) and alkyl radicals (0.50 mg/ml). In addition, the extract from 6-month-old A. vera showed the greatest effects on cell viability in normal liver cells. Based on these findings, the extract from 6-month-old A. vera was examined further in order to determine its protective potential against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced oxidative stress. The extract from 6-monthold A. vera at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml showed the highest protective activity against t-BHP-induced reactive oxygen species production. These findings suggested that harvesting regimens were critical in the regulation of effects of the bioactive potential of A. vera on antioxidant activity.\n\nIsolation of major phenolics from Launaea spinosa and their protective effect on HepG2 cells damaged with t-BHP.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAbdallah, Hossam; Farag, Mohamed; Osman, Samir; Kim, Da hye; Kang, Kyungsu; Pan, Cheol-Ho; Abdel-Sattar, Essam\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSome Launaea species (Asteraceae) are used traditionally to treat liver oxidative stress. The present study investigates the protective effects of isolated compounds from Launaea spinosa Sch. Bip. (Asteraceae) against oxidative stress on t-BHP-induced HepG2 cells. Major phenolic content from flowering aerial parts of L. spinosa was isolated and identified. The protective effects of isolated compounds (10 and 20âÎ¼M) against oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) in HepG2 cells were investigated through the measurement of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. A new phenolic compound identified as 2,3-diferulyl R,R-(+) methyl tartrate (6), in addition to five known metabolites, esculetin (1), esculetin-7-O-d-glucoside (cichoriin) (2), fertaric acid (3), acacetin-7-O-d-glucoside (4), and acacetin-7-O-d-glucuronic acid (5), were isolated. Oxidant-induced damage by 200âÎ¼M t-BHP in HepG2 cells was inhibited by compounds 1, 4, and 5 (10 and 20âÎ¼M), or quercetin (10âÎ¼M; positive control). The protective effects of compounds 1, 4, and 5 were associated with decreasing in AST, ALT, and SOD levels. Compound 4 (20âÎ¼M) decreased the AST level from 128.5âÂ±â13.9 to 7.9 Â±1.8âU/mL. Meanwhile, compound 1 (20âÎ¼M) decreased ALT activity from 20.3âÂ±â7.0 to 7.6âÂ±â2.4âU/mL, while compound 5 decreased SOD levels from 41.6âÂ±â9.0 to 28.3âÂ±â3.4âmU/mg. The major phenolic compounds isolated from L. spinosa displayed a significant cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress, leading to maintenance of the normal redox status of the cell.\n\nInfluence of different chemical agents (H2O2, t-BHP and MMS) on the activity of antioxidant enzymes in human HepG2 and hamster V79 cells; relationship to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSlamenova, D; Kozics, K; Melusova, M; Horvathova, E\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe investigated activities of antioxidant enzymes (AEs), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) in human HepG2 and hamster V79 cells treated with aÂ scale of concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of these substances were evaluated simultaneously. We have found out that H2O2, t-BHP and MMS predictably induce significant concentration-dependent increase of DNA lesions in both cell lines. Cytotoxicity detected in V79 cells with help of PE test was in aÂ good conformity with the level of DNA damage. MTT test has proved unsuitable, except for MMS-treated V79 cells. Compared with human cells HepG2, hamster cells V79 manifested approximately similar levels of SOD and CAT but ten times higher activity of GPx. Across all concentrations tested the most significant increase of activity of the enzyme CAT was found in H2O2- and t-BHP-treated HepG2 cells, of the enzyme SOD in t-BHP- and MMS-treated V79 cells, and of the enzyme GPx in H2O2-treated V79 cells. We suggest that stimulation of enzyme activity by the relevant chemical compounds may result from transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of the genes CAT, SOD and GPx. Several authors suggest that moderate levels of toxic reactants can induce increase of AEs activities, while very high levels of reactants can induce their decrease, as aÂ consequence of damage of the molecular machinery required to induce AEs. Based on aÂ great amount of experiments, which were done and described within this paper, we can say that the above mentioned principle does not apply in general. Only the reactions of t-BHP affected HepG2 cells were consistent with this idea.\n\nHepatoprotective Effect of Terminalia chebula against t-BHP-Induced Acute Liver Injury in C57/BL6 Mice\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMin-Kyung Choi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We aimed to identify the hepatoprotective effects of Terminalia chebula water extract (TCW and its corresponding pharmacological actions using C57/BL6 mice model of tert-butylhydroperoxide-(t-BHP- induced acute liver injury. Mice were orally administered with TCW (0, 50, 100, or 200âmg/kg or gallic acid (100âmg/kg for 5 days before t-BHP (2.5âmM/kg injection. Liver enzymes, histopathology, oxidative stress parameters, antioxidant components, and inflammatory cytokines were examined 18âh after t-BHP injection. t-BHP injection caused dramatic elevation of serum AST, ALT, and LDH level, while TCW pretreatment notably attenuated these elevations. Inflammatory cytokines including TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 were notably increased in hepatic tissues, and then these were efficiently attenuated by TCW pretreatment. t-BHP injection notably increased malondialdehyde, total reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide in the liver tissue, while it markedly dropped the antioxidant activities including total antioxidant capacity, total glutathione contents, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. TCW pretreatment remarkably ameliorated these alterations, and these effects were relevant to gene expressions. Histopathological examinations supported the above findings. Collectively, these findings well prove that TCW beneficially prevents acute and severe liver injury and clarify its corresponding mechanisms involved in the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines.\n\nCuscuta chinensis seeds water extraction protecting murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells against tertiary butyl hydroperoxide induced injury.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGao, Jian-mei; Li, Ran; Zhang, Lei; Jia, Li-long; Ying, Xi-xiang; Dou, De-qiang; Li, Jian-chun; Li, Hai-bo\n\n2013-07-09\n\nCuscuta chinensis (C. chinensis) is a well-known traditional Chinese herb that has been used to treat heart disease, diabetes, liver injury, cancer, and aging. Murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with various concentrations of C. chinensis water extraction at different time intervals. The antioxidant effect of C. chinensis on MC3T3-E1 cells was evaluated using MTT and TUNEL assays. The effect of C. chinensis on cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide. Lipid peroxidation was measured by the HPLC method. The cellular redox status was determined from the reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) and the enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism, including glutathione reductase (GR), Glutathione S-transferase (GST), and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The changes in relative mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ÎÎ¨m) in the MC3T3-E1 cells were analyzed with rhodamine 123 staining. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the levels of cytochrome c (cyto c), Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3, Sirt3, and IDH2 expressions. The C. chinensis water extraction protects tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-treated MC3T3-E1 cells from death in a dose-dependent manner. C. chinensis treatment significantly inhibited the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), GR, GST, and G6PD. The release of cyto c from mitochondria was reduced by C. chinensis, which increased the expression of antiapoptotic IDH2, Sirt3, and Bcl-2 and decreased the expression of Bax, cyto c, and caspase 3. C. chinensis modulated the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells, probably due to its antioxidant activity and functioning via mitochondria-dependent pathways.

Cyclohexene in the reaction mixture of Cp 2 MoX 2 with tert -butyl hydroperoxide is oxidated to form cyclohexene oxide, the reaction proceeding at a high rate and with a quantitative yield. Tert.-butylperoxide of biscyclopentadienyl molybdendihalide is responsible for the cyclohexene epoxidation reaction.

Previously, we observed the presence of a t-butyl group, either covalently bond or added as an external reagent, could impart deuterium exchange to the unactivated, C1-position of estrone. Here, we provide nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of this exchange in a solvent system composed of 50:50 trifluoroacetic acid and D 2 O with either 2-t-butylestrone or estrone in the presence of t-butyl alcohol has shed insights into the mechanism of this t-butyl-catalyzed exchange. Fast exchange of the t-butyl group concurrent with the gradual reduction of the H1 proton signal in both systems suggest a mechanism involving ipso attack of the t-butyl position by deuterium. The reversible addition/elimination of the t-butyl group activates the H1 proton towards exchange by a mechanism of t-butyl incorporation, H1 activation and exchange, followed by eventual t-butyl elimination. Density functional calculations are consistent with the observation of fast t-butyl exchange concurrent with slower H1 exchange. The Ï-complex resulting from ipso attack of deuterium at the t-butyl carbon was 6.6 kcal/mol lower in energy than that of the Ï-complex resulting from deuterium attack at C1. A better understanding of the t-butyl-catalyzed exchange could help in the design of labelling recipes for other phenolic metabolites. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

The presence of gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, caffeic acid, quercetin, and apigenin in the NNF was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC. The extract had a very potent capacity to scavenge numerous free radicals. NNF extract was also able to prevent DNA damage and quench cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS generation induced by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP with no signs of toxicity. The NNF extract was able to augment the expression of both primary and phase II detoxifying enzyme, resulting in combat the oxidative stress. This is accomplished by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase (p38 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK followed by enhancing the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2. This attenuates cellular ROS generation and confers protection from cell death. Altogether, the results of current study revealed that Nymphaea nouchali flower could be a source of natural phytochemicals that could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for preventing oxidative stress associated diseases and attenuating disease progression.\n\nThe Synergistic Effects of Heat Shock Protein 70 and Ginsenoside Rg1 against Tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide Damage Model In Vitro\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDan Lu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Neural stem cells (NSCs transplanted is one of the hottest research to treat Alzheimerâs disease (AD, but cholinergic neurons from stem cells were also susceptible to cell death which Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70 was affirmed to reverse. Related to cognitive impairment, cholinergic nervous cells should be investigated and ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1 was considered to increase them. We chose tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP damage model to study in vitro. Functional properties of our recombination plasmid pEGFP-C2-HSP70 were affirmed by SH-SY5Y cells. To opposite the transitory appearance of HSP70, NSCs used as the vectors of HSP70 gene overexpressed HSP70 for at least 7 days in vitro. After transfection for 3 days, G-Rg1 pretreatment for 4 hours, and coculture for 3 days, the expression of acetylcholinesterase (ChAT, synaptophysin, and the ratio of NeuN and GFAP were assessed by western blot; Morphological properties were detected by 3D reconstruction and immunofluorescence. ChAT was markedly improved in the groups contained G-Rg1. In coculture system, the ratio of neurons/astrocytes and the filaments of neurons were increased; apoptosis cells were decreased, compared to monotherapy (P<0.05. In conclusion, we demonstrated that, as a safe cotreatment affirmed in vitro, overexpression of HSP70 in NSCs plus G-Rg1 promoted nervous cells regeneration from chronic oxidative damage.\n\nQuercetin protects human hepatoma HepG2 against oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlia, Mario; Ramos, Sonia; Mateos, Raquel; Granado-Serrano, Ana Belen; Bravo, Laura; Goya, Luis\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFlavonols such as quercetin, have been reported to exhibit a wide range of biological activities related to their antioxidant capacity. The objective of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of quercetin on cell viability and redox status of cultured HepG2 cells submitted to oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Concentrations of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde, generation of reactive oxygen species and activity and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes were used as markers of cellular oxidative status. Pretreatment of HepG2 with 10 Î¼M quercetin completely prevented lactate dehydrogenase leakage from the cells. Pretreatment for 2 or 20 h with all doses of quercetin (0.1-10 Î¼M) prevented the decrease of reduced glutathione and the increase of malondialdehyde evoked by tert-butyl hydroperoxide in HepG2 cells. Reactive oxygen species generation induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide was significantly reduced when cells were pretreated for 2 or 20 h with 10 Î¼M and for 20 h with 5 Î¼M quercetin. Finally, some of the quercetin treatments prevented the significant increase of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and catalase activities induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Gene expression of antioxidant enzymes was also affected by the treatment with the polyphenol. The results of the biomarkers analyzed clearly show that treatment of HepG2 cells in culture with the natural dietary antioxidant quercetin strongly protects the cells against an oxidative insult\n\nProtective Effects of Cultivated Ginseng, Cultivated Wild Ginseng of Korean and Chinese Against CCl4 and t-BHP Induced Acute Hepatotoxicity in ICR Mice\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKim, Young-Jin\n\n2007-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Objectives : This study was aimed at investigating live protection mechanism of Cultivated Ginseng and Cultivated Wild Ginseng of Korean and Chinese by inducing liver toxicity through and t-BHP in mice and evaluated serological findings. Methods : Experiment groups was categorized into untreated normal group, treated control group, and orally administered Cultivated Ginseng and Cultivated Wild Ginseng of Korean and Chinese experimental groups. At the termination of experiment, gross examination of the liver as well as Total bilirubin, AST, and ALT contents in the serum were evaluated. Results : 1. In the induced acute hepatotoxicity test, total bilirubin, AST and ALT didn't show significant differences between the control and experimental groups. 2. In the t-BHP induced acute hepatotoxicity test, total bilirubin, AST and ALT didn't show significant differences between the control and experimental groups. Conclusion : Taken together, Cultivated Ginseng and Cultivated Wild Ginseng of Korean and Chinese cannot be effectively used for recovering the liver functions in acute hepatotoxicity tests using and t-BHP. Further researches, for example treated long period, must be tried to verify the efficacies.\n\nProtective effects of hesperidin against oxidative stress of tert-butyl hydroperoxide in human hepatocytes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Mingcang; Gu, Honggang; Ye, Yiyi; Lin, Bing; Sun, Lijuan; Deng, Weiping; Zhang, Jingzhe; Liu, Jianwen\n\n2010-10-01\n\nIncreasing evidence regarding free radical generating agents and the inflammatory process suggest that accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could involve hepatotoxicity. Hesperidin, a naturally occurring flavonoid presents in fruits and vegetables, has been reported to exert a wide range of pharmacological effects that include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypercholesterolemic, and anticarcinogenic actions. However, the cytoprotection and mechanism of hesperidin to neutralize oxidative stress in human hepatic L02 cells remain unclear. In this work, we assessed the capability of hesperidin to prevent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH)-induced cell damage by augmenting cellular antioxidant defense. Hesperidin significantly protected hepatocytes against t-BuOOH-induced cell cytotoxicity, such as mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) deplete and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Hesperidin also remarkably prevented indicators of oxidative stress, such as the ROS and lipid peroxidation level in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot showed that hesperidin facilitated ERK/MAPK phosphorylation which appeared to be responsible for nuclear translocation of Nrf2, thereby inducing cytoprotective heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Based on the results described above, it suggested that hesperidin has potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of oxidative stress-related hepatocytes injury and liver dysfunctions.

Ninety-day toxicity studies were conducted in B6C3F1 mice and Fischer 344 (F344) rats of both sexes using dosed water. Dose levels of t-butyl alcohol were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% (w/v). Lethality was observed at the 4% level of both sexes and species. Weight-gain depression was present in all dose levels of male rats; 4% female rats; 1, 2, and 4% male mice; and 2 and 4% female mice. Water consumption was increased at lower dose levels in male rats and decreased in the higher dose levels of both sexes of rats and female mice. Clinical signs in rats were ataxia in both sexes and hypoactivity in males. Clinical signs in mice were ataxia, abnormal posture, and hypoactivity. In rats, urine volumes were reduced, in association with crystalluria. Gross lesions at necropsy were urinary tract calculi, renal pelvic and ureteral dilatation, and thickening of the urinary bladder mucosa. Microscopic lesions were hyperplasia of transitional epithelia and inflammation of the urinary bladder. In male rats treated with t-butyl alcohol, microscopic renal changes were suggestive of alpha-2 mu-globulin nephropathy. No-effect levels for the urinary tract lesions were 1% in male rats and mice (803.7 mg/kg/day for the male rats and 1565.8 mg/kg/day for the male mice) and 2% in female rats and mice (1451.5 mg/kg/day for the female rats and 4362.9 mg/kg/day for the female mice). The results indicate that in rodents the urinary tract is the target organ for t-butyl alcohol toxicity, and males are more sensitive to t-butyl alcohol toxicity than females.\n\nOn the interaction of molybdenum cyanide complexes with hydroperoxide of tertiary butyl\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVretsena, N.B.; Nikipanchuk, M.V.; Chernyak, B.I.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nConducted is investigation of interaction of potassium dioxotetracyanomolybdate (4) K 4 [MoO 2 (CN) 4 ], potassium oxotetracyanomolybdate (2) K 4 [MoO(CN) 4 ] and potassium tetracyanomolybdate K 4 [Mo(CN) 4 ] in CCl 4 and hydroperoxide of tertiary butyl medium, (HPTB).

In the present study, NecroXs, novel class of mitochondrial ROS/RNS scavengers, were evaluated for cardioprotection in in vitro and in vivo model, and the putative mechanism of the cardioprotection of NecroX-7 was investigated by global gene expression profiling and subsequent biochemical analysis. NecroX-7 prevented tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced death of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes at EC{sub 50} = 0.057 Î¼M. In doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy in rats, NecroX-7 significantly reduced the plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) which were increased by DOX treatment (p < 0.05). Microarray analysis revealed that 21 genes differentially expressed in tBHP-treated H9C2 cells were involved in âProduction of reactive oxygen speciesâ (p = 0.022), and they were resolved by concurrent NecroX-7 treatment. Gene-to-gene networking also identified that NecroX-7 relieved cell death through Ncf1/p47phox and Rac2 modulation. In subsequent biochemical analysis, NecroX-7 inhibited NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity by 53.3% (p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that NecroX-7, in part, provides substantial protection of cardiomyopathy induced by tBHP or DOX via NOX-mediated cell death. -- Highlights: âº NecroX-7 prevented tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced in vitro cardiac cell death. âº NecroX-7 ameliorated doxorubicin-induced in vivo cardiomyopathy. âº NecroX-7 prevented oxidative stress and necrosis-enriched transcriptional changes. âº NecroX-7 effectively inhibited NADPH oxidase activation. âº Cardioprotection of Necro-7 was brought on by modulation of NADPH oxidase activity.\n\nA thermal lensing study of a photolysis of di- t-butyl peroxide\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFuke, K.; Hasegawa, A.; Ueda, M.; Itoh, M.\n\n1981-11-01\n\nA photolysis of di- t-butyl peroxide (BOOB) was studied by using a thermal lensing technique.

Matsum on tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJung, Hyun Ah; Abdul, Qudeer Ahmed; Byun, Jeong Su; Joung, Eun-Ji; Gwon, Wi-Gyeong; Lee, Min-Sup; Kim, Hyeung-Rak; Choi, Jae Sue\n\n2017-09-14\n\nMilk thistle leaves and flowers have been traditionally used as herbal remedy to alleviate liver diseases for decades. Korean milk thistle, Cirsium japonicum var. maackii (Maxim.) Matsum has been employed in traditional folk medicine as diuretic, antiphlogistic, hemostatic, and detoxifying agents. The aim of current investigation was to evaluate hepatoprotective properties of the MeOH extract of the roots, stems, leaves and flowers of Korean milk thistle as well as four isolated flavonoids, luteolin, luteolin 5-O-glucoside, apigenin and apigenin 7-O-glucuronide during t-BHP-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. Hepatoprotective potential of the MeOH extracts and flavonoids derived from Korean milk thistle against t-BHP-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells were evaluated following MTT method. Incubating HepG2 cells with t-BHP markedly decreased the cell viability and increased the intracellular ROS generation accompanied by depleted GSH levels. Protein expression of heme oxygenase (HO-1) and nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) was determined by Western blot. Our findings revealed that pretreating HepG2 cells with MeOH extracts and bioactive flavonoids significantly attenuated the t-BHP-induced oxidative damage, followed by increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The results illustrate that excess ROS generation was reduced and GSH levels increased dose-dependently when HepG2 cells were pretreated with four flavonoids. Moreover, Western blotting analysis demonstrated that protein expressions of Nrf-2 and HO-1 were also up-regulated by flavonoids treatment. These results clearly demonstrate that the MeOH extracts and flavonoids from Korean milk thistle protected HepG2 cells against oxidative damage triggered by t-BHP principally by modulating ROS generation and restoring depleted GSH levels in addition to the increased Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling cascade. These flavonoids are potential natural antioxidative biomarkers against oxidative stress\n\nStereosequence distributions of poly(t-butyl methacrylate)s prepared with butyllithium\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSuzuki, Toshimitsu; Yamada, Osamu; Watanabe, Yoshihisa; Takegami, Yoshinobu\n\n1982-01-01\n\n13 C NMR spectra of poly(t-butyl methacrylate)s (PBMA) prepared with butyl-lithium (n-BuLi) were studied. Methylene carbon resonances appeared as five overlapped peaks, which were interpreted as a combination of hexad stereosequence distributions. The stereosequence distribution of PBMA prepared with n-BuLi at -78 0 C obeyed the first order Markov chain model even polymerized in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Syndiotactic PBMA was obtained with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator, and the stereosequence distribution of this polymer agreed well with Bernoullian statistics. (author)\n\nSolvent and ion-pairing effects on the chlorine kinetic isotope effect of t-butyl chloride\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMcCord, B.R.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe solvolysis of t-butyl chloride and 1-adamantyl chloride was measured in mixtures of aqueous 2,2,2-trifluoroethanols and in mixtures of aqueous ethanols. The KIEs for t-butyl chloride at 25 0 C in 94% TFE/water, and 60% ethanol/water (solvent mixtures with similar polarity) were 1.0097 and 1.0104 respectively. Further investigations showed a KIE of 1.0104 in 50% ethanol/water and 1.0105 in 100% ethanol while the isotope effect in the fluorinated ethanols rose from 1.0094 in 99% TFE/water to 1.0101 in 70% ethanol/water. The KIE in all these solvents were shown to be directly proportional to the nucleophilicity of the solvent and indicates nucleophilic attack on an ion pair. The similar KIE of t-butyl chloride in the ethanol/water solvents was found to support the contention that solvent polarity exerts a minimal effect on the chlorine KIE\n\nEffects of the Macular Carotenoid Lutein in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXiaoming Gong\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE cells are central to retinal health and homoeostasis. Oxidative stress-induced damage to the RPE occurs as part of the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration and neovascular retinopathies (e.g., retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy. The xanthophyll carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are selectively taken up by the RPE, preferentially accumulated in the human macula, and transferred to photoreceptors. These macular xanthophylls protect the macula (and the broader retina via their antioxidant and photo-protective activities. This study was designed to investigate effects of various carotenoids (Î²-carotene, lycopene, and lutein on RPE cells subjected to either hypoxia or oxidative stress, in order to determine if there is effect specificity for macular pigment carotenoids. Using human RPE-derived ARPE-19 cells as an in vitro model, we exposed RPE cells to various concentrations of the specific carotenoids, followed by either graded hypoxia or oxidative stress using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP. The results indicate that lutein and lycopene, but not Î²-carotene, inhibit cell growth in undifferentiated ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, cell viability was decreased under hypoxic conditions. Pre-incubation of ARPE-19 cells with lutein or lycopene protected against tBHP-induced cell loss and cell co-exposure of lutein or lycopene with tBHP essentially neutralized tBHP-dependent cell death at tBHP concentrations up to 500 Î¼M. Our findings indicate that lutein and lycopene inhibit the growth of human RPE cells and protect the RPE against oxidative stress-induced cell loss. These findings contribute to the understanding of the protective mechanisms attributable to retinal xanthophylls in eye health and retinopathies.\n\nSearch for mode-selective chemistry: The unimolecular dissociation of t-butyl hydroperoxide induced by vibrational overtone excitation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChandler, D.W.; Farneth, W.E.; Zare, R.N.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe use of optoacoustic spectroscopy permits both the monitoring of the overtone excitation of t-butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) and the in situ detection of the resulting reaction product t-butanol (t-BuOH). The sample is contained in a reaction cell, equipped with a microphone, in which all surfaces have been specially passivated. The cell is placed inside the cavity of a dye laser tuned to excite the 5--0 O--H stretch of the t-BuOOH at 619.0 nm. The dissociation process yields directly xOH and t-BuOx, and the latter readily abstracts a hydrogen atom from a parent molecule to form t-butanol (t-BuOH). The appearance rate of t-BuOH is obtained by ratioing the area under the 5--0 O--H stretch of t-BuOH to that of a combination band of t-BuOOH. At low pressures, below 40 Torr, a plot of the reciprocal of the t-BuOH appearance rate versus total pressure shows near linear behavior. This linearlity can be well described by a statistical model (RRKM) when careful averaging of the dissociation rate over the thermal energy distribution of the photoactivated molecules is included. At pressures above 40 Torr, a marked deviation from linearity appears. This deviation is fit to a kinetic model in which the dissociation rate of an energy nonrandomized molecule competes with the rate of intramolecular energy relaxation. This places a lower bound of > or =5.0 x 10 11 s -1 on the rate of energy randomization. A discussion of this model in the context of other possible kinetic schemes as well as other photoactivated and chemically activated systems is presented\n\nBiomarkers derived from heterolytic and homolytic cleavage of allylic hydroperoxides resulting from alkenone autoxidation\n\nDigital Repository Service at National Institute of Oceanography (India)\n\nRontania, J.F.; Harji, R.; Volkmanc, J.K.\n\nLaboratory incubation of alkenone mixtures with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and di-tert-butyl nitroxide (radical initiator) in hexane, as a means to simulate alkenone autoxidation processes, rapidly led to the formation of allylic hydroperoxides, whose...\n\nTranscriptomic profiling of chemical exposure reveals roles of Yap1 in protecting yeast cells from oxidative and other types of stresses.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Chao; Li, Zhouquan; Zhang, Xiaohua; Yuan, Li; Dai, Heping; Xiao, Wei\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTranscriptomic profiles are generated by comparing wild-type and the yeast yap1 mutant to various chemicals in an attempt to establish a correlation between this gene mutation and chemical exposure. Test chemicals include ClonNAT as a non-genotoxic agent, methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) as an alkylating agent, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) as an oxidative agent and the mixture of t-BHP and MMS to reflect complex natural exposure. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and specific DEGs were obtained by excluding overlapping DEGs with the control group. In the MMS exposure group, deoxyribonucleotide biosynthetic processes were upregulated, while oxidation-reduction processes were downregulated. In the t-BHP exposure group, metabolic processes were upregulated while peroxisome and ion transport pathways were downregulated. In the mixture exposure group, the proteasome pathway was upregulated, while the aerobic respiration was downregulated. Homologue analysis of DEGs related to human diseases showed that many of DEGs were linked to cancer, ageing and neuronal degeneration. These observations confirm that the yap1 mutant is more sensitive to chemicals than wild-type cells and that the susceptible individuals carrying the YAP1-like gene defect may enhance risk to chemical exposure. Hence, this study offers a novel approach to environmental risk assessment, based on the genetic backgrounds of susceptible individuals.

The results show that GTE inhibits the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO, a direct mutagen, and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA, an indirect mutagen, toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. In addition, GTE shows radical scavenging, reducing activities, tyrosinase inhibition, and liposome protection effects. Meanwhile, GTE in the range of 0.1â0.4âmg/mL protects liver cells from tert-butyl-hydroperoxide-(t-BHP- induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity inhibition of GTE in the t-BHP-treated cells was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis suggests that the major phenolic constituents in GTE are gallic acid, ferulic acid, and myricetin. These active phenolic components may contribute to the biological protective effects of GTE in different models. The data suggest that GTE exhibiting biological activities can be applied to antimutation, antityrosinase, and antioxidative damage.\n\nSeparation of Poly(styrene-block-t-butyl methacrylate) Copolymers by Various Liquid Chromatography Techniques\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nÅ migovec LjubiÄ, Tina; Pahovnik, David; Å½igon, Majda; Å½agar, Ema\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe separation of a mixture of three poly(styrene-block-t-butyl methacrylate) copolymers (PS-b-PtBMA), consisting of polystyrene (PS) blocks of similar length and t-butyl methacrylate (PtBMA) blocks of different lengths, was performed using various chromatographic techniques, that is, a gradient liquid chromatography on reversed-phase (C18 and C8) and normal-phase columns, a liquid chromatography under critical conditions for polystyrene as well as a fully automated two-dimensional liquid chromatography that separates block copolymers by chemical composition in the first dimension and by molar mass in the second dimension. The results show that a partial separation of the mixture of PS-b-PtBMA copolymers can be achieved only by gradient liquid chromatography on reversed-phase columns. The coelution of the two block copolymers is ascribed to a much shorter PtBMA block length, compared to the PS block, as well as a small difference in the length of the PtBMA block in two of these copolymers, which was confirmed by SEC-MALS and NMR spectroscopy.

The X-ray structures have been reported previously. We also report and interpret the temperature dependence of the solid state {sup 1}H nuclear magnetic resonance spin-lattice relaxation rate at 8.50, 22.5, and 53.0 MHz in one of the four compounds. Such experiments for the other three have been reported previously. We compare the computed barriers for methyl group and t-butyl group rotation in a central target molecule in the cluster with the activation energies determined from fitting the {sup 1}H NMR spin-lattice relaxation data. We formulate a dynamical model for the superposition of t-butyl group rotation and the rotation of the t-butyl group's constituent methyl groups. The four compounds are 2,7-di-t-butylpyrene, 1,4-di-t-butylbenzene, 2,6-di-t-butylnaphthalene, and 3-t-butylchrysene. We comment on the unusual ground state orientation of the t-butyl groups in the crystal of the pyrene and we comment on the unusually high rotational barrier of these t-butyl groups.\n\nPhotostabilization of Rhodamine 6G in acetone by Î²-carotene and t-butyl hydroxyanisole\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAoki, Keisuke; Matsuda, Masahiro; Yamamoto, Daisuke; Abe, Yasuhiro; Akutsu, Shinya; Fujita, Koichi; Doi, Kazutaka; Kobayashi, Masami\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe photostability of Rhodamine 6G is of crucial importance for the organic light-emitting display of mobilephones. Photobleaching of Rhodamine 6G in acetone was not protected by Î²-carotene, but was efficientlyphotostabilized by t-butyl hydroxyanisole. The results indicate that photobleaching of Rhodamine 6G inacetone was not caused by singlet oxygen but some radical species.\n\nProtective Effect of Theaflavin on Erythrocytes Subjected to In Vitro Oxidative Stress\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMahejabeen Fatima\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Antioxidant and free radical scavenging effect of black tea theaflavins has been shown in many epidemiological studies. In the present work we report the protective mechanism of tea theaflavins on biomarkers of oxidative stress, which are elevated during stress conditions. We hereby report the in vitro effect of theaflavins on erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA, intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH, and plasma membrane redox system (PMRS of rats. The effect of theaflavin on PMRS has also been validated through an in silico docking simulation study using Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD. We report that theaflavins show significant protection to erythrocyte against oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP.

Here we determine that the apratoxin A t-butyl group is formed as pivaloyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) by AprA, the polyketide synthase (PKS) loading module of the apratoxin A biosynthetic pathway. AprA contains an inactive \"pseudo\" GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase domain (Î¨GNAT) flanked by two methyltransferase domains (MT1 and MT2) that differ distinctly in sequence. Structural, biochemical, and precursor incorporation studies reveal that MT2 catalyzes unusually coupled decarboxylation and methylation reactions to transform dimethylmalonyl-ACP, the product of MT1, to pivaloyl-ACP. Further, pivaloyl-ACP synthesis is primed by the fatty acid synthase malonyl acyltransferase (FabD), which compensates for the Î¨GNAT and provides the initial acyl-transfer step to form AprA malonyl-ACP. Additionally, images of AprA from negative stain electron microscopy reveal multiple conformations that may facilitate the individual catalytic steps of the multienzyme module.\n\nScreening SIRT1 Activators from Medicinal Plants as Bioactive Compounds against Oxidative Damage in Mitochondrial Function\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYi Wang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1 belongs to the family of NAD+ dependent histone deacetylases and plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and response to oxidative stress. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs, as an important part of natural products, have been reported to exert protective effect against oxidative stress in mitochondria. In this study, we screened SIRT1 activators from TCMs and investigated their activities against mitochondrial damage. 19 activators were found in total by in vitro SIRT1 activity assay. Among those active compounds, four compounds, ginsenoside Rb2, ginsenoside F1, ginsenoside Rc, and schisandrin A, were further studied to validate the SIRT1-activation effects by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and confirm their activities against oxidative damage in H9c2 cardiomyocytes exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP. The results showed that those compounds enhanced the deacetylated activity of SIRT1, increased ATP content, and inhibited intracellular ROS formation as well as regulating the activity of Mn-SOD. These SIRT1 activators also showed moderate protective effects on mitochondrial function in t-BHP cells by recovering oxygen consumption and increasing mitochondrial DNA content. Our results suggested that those compounds from TCMs attenuated oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes through activation of SIRT1.\n\nAntioxidant effect of bisphosphonates and simvastatin on chondrocyte lipid peroxidation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDombrecht, E.J.; De Tollenaere, C.B.; Aerts, K.; Cos, P.; Schuerwegh, A.J.; Bridts, C.H.; Van Offel, J.F.; Ebo, D.G.; Stevens, W.J.; De Clerck, L.S.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of bisphosphonates (BPs) and simvastatin on chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. For this purpose, a flow cytometrical method using C11-BODIPY 581/591 was developed to detect hydroperoxide-induced lipid peroxidation in chondrocytes. Tertiary butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) induced a time and concentration dependent increase in chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. Addition of a Fe 2+ /EDTA complex to t-BHP or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) clearly enhanced lipid peroxidation. The lipophilic simvastatin demonstrated a small inhibition in the chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. None of three tested BPs (clodronate, pamidronate, and risedronate) had an effect on chondrocyte lipid peroxidation induced by t-BHP. However, when Fe 2+ /EDTA complex was added to t-BHP or H 2 O 2 , BPs inhibited the lipid peroxidation process varying from 25% to 58%. This study demonstrates that BPs have antioxidant properties as iron chelators, thereby inhibiting the chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. These findings add evidence to the therapeutic potential of bisphosphonates and statins in rheumatoid arthritis\n\nBiochemical Abnormalities in Batten's Syndrome\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nClausen, Jytte Lene; Nielsen, Gunnar Gissel; Jensen, Gunde Egeskov\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe present data indicate that a group of ten patients with Batten's syndrome showed reduced activity of erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (Px) (glutathione: H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.9.) using H2O2 as peroxide donor. Assay of erythrocyte GSHPx using H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide and t......-butyl hydroperoxide as donors also makes it possible biochemically to divide Batten's syndrome into two types: (1) one type with decreased values when H2O2 and cumene hydroperoxide are used, and (2) one type with increased values when t-butyl hydroperoxide is used. Furthermore an increased content of palmitic, oleic...\n\nDetermination of organic peroxides by liquid chromatography with on-line post-column ultraviolet irradiation and peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence detection.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWada, Mitsuhiro; Inoue, Keiyu; Thara, Ayuko; Kishikawa, Naoya; Nakashima, Kenichiro; Kuroda, Naotaka\n\n2003-02-14\n\nA HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous determination of organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide with peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence (PO-CL) detection following on-line UV irradiation. Organic peroxides [i.e., benzoyl peroxide (BP), tert.-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP), tert.-butyl perbenzoate (BPB), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)] were UV irradiated (254 nm, 15 W) to generate hydrogen peroxide, which was determined by PO-CL detection. The conditions for UV irradiation and PO-CL detection were optimized by a flow injection analysis (FIA) system. Generation of hydrogen peroxide from peroxides with on-line UV irradiation also was confirmed by the FIA system by incorporating an enzyme column reactor immobilized with catalase. The separation of four organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide by HPLC was accomplished isocratically on an ODS column within 30 min. The detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio=3) were 1.1 microM for hydrogen peroxide, 6.8 microM for BP, 31.3 microM for BHP, 7.5 microM for BPB and 1.3 microM for CHP. The proposed method was applied to the determination of BP in wheat flour.\n\nStandard thermochemical characteristics of combustion and formation of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone and 3,6-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone at T = 298.15 K\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPashanova, Kira I.; Abakumov, Gleb A.; Markin, Alexey V.; Piskunov, Alexander V.; Smirnova, Natalia N.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ We report the results of thermochemical study for benzoquinone derivatives. â¢ Optimal conditions for determination of combustion energy for benzoquinone were done. â¢ The formation enthalpies for crystalline benzoquinone have been detected at T = 298.15 K. â¢ The formation enthalpy of isomeric quinones were compared. - Abstract: Optimal conditions for investigations of thermodynamic properties have been determined experimentally by the method of combustion calorimetry for compounds of the o-benzoquinone series. In the present work, the energies of combustion in oxygen were measured at T = 298.15 K by static bomb combustion calorimetry for 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone and 3,6-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone.

The negative logarithm of the dissociation constant of the monomer unit of a methacrylic acid (MAA) monotonously increased with the increasing degree of dissociation corresponding to the titrant/MAA amount ratio, and was highly influenced by the copolymerization ratio. The results are discussed in terms of the suppression of the dissociation of MAA by a neighboring charged methacrylate anion unit.\n\nDevelopment of an efficient process for radiation vulcanization of natural rubber latex using hydroperoxide with sensitizer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSiri-upathum, C.; Sonsuk, M.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nAn attempt was made to reduce irradiation dose for radiation vulcanization of natural rubber latex. A promising method was to partially crosslink the latex by radiation vulcanization using n-butyl acrylate (n-BA) as sensitizer and t-butyl hydroperoxide (BHPO) as a co-sensitizer followed by redox vulcanization using residual BHPO as an oxidant and either fructose or tetra ethylene penta mine as reducing agents. It was found that the irradiation dose was reduced to 4 kGy with 5 phr n-BA as sensitizer and 0.1 phr BHPO as co-sensitizer. Successive crosslinking to full vulcanization was done by redox vulcanization using either 4 phr fructose at 60 degree C for 3 hours of 0.4 phr tetra-ethylene penta mine at room temperature for 1 hour. The rubber films obtained had tensile strength of about 25 MPa, modulus 300% of 0.9 MPa and crosslink density of about 1.5 x 10 19 crosslink/cm 3 . It was noted that the rubber film from the co-vulcanization was the average value of the values obtained by radiation vulcanization and redox vulcanization\n\nPREPARATION OF BLOCK COPOLYMERS OF POLY(STYRENE) AND POLY(T-BUTYL ACRYLATE) OF VARIOUS MOLECULAR WEIGHTS AND ARCHITECTURES BY ATOM TRANSFER RADICAL POLYMERIZATION.

In the present study, antioxidant property of KT has been investigated against tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) induced cytotoxicity using murine hepatocytes. TBHP, a reactive oxygen species inducer, causes oxidative stress resulting in organ pathophysiology. Exposure to TBHP caused a reduction in cell viability, increased membrane leakage and disturbed the intra-cellular antioxidant machineries in hepatocytes. TBHP exposure disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and induced apoptosis as evidenced by flow cytometric analyses. KT treatment, however, counteracted the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented apoptotic cell death of the hepatocytes. BT treatment also reverted TBHP induced hepatotoxicity, however KT was found to be more efficient. This may be due to the formation of antioxidant molecules like D-saccharic acid-1,4-lactone (DSL) during fermentation process and are absent in BT. Moreover, the radical scavenging activities of KT were found to be higher than BT. Results of the study showed that KT has the potential to ameliorate TBHP induced oxidative insult and cell death in murine hepatocytes more effectively than BT.\n\nMulti-wall carbon nanotubes supported molybdenyl acetylacetonate: Efficient and highly reusable catalysts for epoxidation of alkenes with tert-butyl hydroperoxide\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEsnaashari, Fariba; Moghadam, Majid; Mirkhani, Valiollah; Tangestaninejad, Shahram; Mohammadpoor-Baltork, Iraj; Khosropour, Ahmad Reza; Zakeri, Maryam\n\n2012-01-01\n\nEfficient epoxidation of olefins catalyzed by MoO 2 (acac) 2 supported on amines functionalized MWCNTs is reported.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of black rice extracts (whole grain extract, WGE and rice bran extract, RBE) on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-induced oxidative injury in HepG2 cells. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations were evaluated as biomarkers of cellular oxidative status. Cells pretreated with 50 and 100 Î¼g/mL of WGE or RBE were more resistant to oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. The highest WGE and BRE concentrations enhanced GSH concentrations and modulated antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) compared to TBHP-treated cells. Cells treated with RBE showed higher protective effect compared to cells treated with WGE against oxidative insult. Black rice extracts attenuated oxidative insult by inhibiting cellular ROS and MDA increase and by modulating antioxidant enzyme activities in HepG2 cells.

In the present study, the possible protective effects of sheep whey protein (SWP from tert-butyl hydroperoxide- (tBHP- induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells (EA.hy926 were assessed using oxidative stress biomarkers. These oxidative stress biomarkers were glutathione (GSH and ROS levels determined by flow cytometry. Moreover, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS, protein carbonyls (CARB, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG were determined spectrophotometrically. The results showed that SWP at 0.78, 1.56, 3.12, and 6.24âmg of protein mLâ1 increased GSH up to 141%, while it decreased GSSG to 46.7%, ROS to 58.5%, TBARS to 52.5%, and CARB to 49.0%. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for the first time that SWP protected endothelial cells from oxidative stress. Thus, SWP may be used for developing food supplements or biofunctional foods to attenuate vascular disturbances associated with oxidative stress.\n\nMulti-wall carbon nanotubes supported molybdenyl acetylacetonate: Efficient and highly reusable catalysts for epoxidation of alkenes with tert-butyl hydroperoxide\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nEsnaashari, Fariba [Department of Chemistry, Catalysis Division, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441 (Iran, Islamic Republic of); Moghadam, Majid, E-mail: moghadamm@sci.ui.ac.ir [Department of Chemistry, Catalysis Division, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441 (Iran, Islamic Republic of); Mirkhani, Valiollah, E-mail: mirkhani@sci.ui.ac.ir [Department of Chemistry, Catalysis Division, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441 (Iran, Islamic Republic of); Tangestaninejad, Shahram; Mohammadpoor-Baltork, Iraj; Khosropour, Ahmad Reza; Zakeri, Maryam [Department of Chemistry, Catalysis Division, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441 (Iran, Islamic Republic of)\n\n2012-11-15\n\nEfficient epoxidation of olefins catalyzed by MoO{sub 2}(acac){sub 2} supported on amines functionalized MWCNTs is reported.

The decomposition followed the kinetics of a first order reaction with formation of both monomeric and oligomeric secondary products. The proportions of oligomers slightly increased with increasing reaction temperature and decreased with increasing concentration of hydroperoxide. The activation energy was 70.4 kJ/mol +/- 4.7 kJ/mol. The decomposition of hydroperoxides proceeded partially by monomolecular cleavage, partially by formation of esters with palmitic acid.\n\nImproved stereoselective bioreduction of t-butyl 6-cyano-(5R)-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate by Rhodotorula glutinis through heat treatment.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLuo, Xi; Wang, Ya-Jun; Zheng, Yu-Guo\n\n2016-11-01\n\nOptically pure t-butyl 6-cyano-(3R, 5R)-dihydroxyhexanoate ((R)-1b) is the key precursor for atorvastatin calcium, the most widely used cholesterol-lowering drug. In this work, a strain ZJB-09224 capable of asymmetrically reducing t-butyl 6-cyano-(5R)-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate (1a) to corresponding optically pure (R)-1b was successfully isolated from soil sample, identified belonging to Rhodotorula glutinis based on the morphology, physiological tests, and the 18S rDNA sequence analysis. It was found that heat treatment of cell suspension at 45Â Â°C for 25Â Min significantly improved R. glutinis ZJB-09224 stereoselectivity. The asymmetric bioreduction of 1a was most efficient at pHÂ 7.5, 35Â Â°C, 50Â mM (15.0Â gÂ L -1 ) substrate concentration, 40.0Â gÂ DCWÂ L -1 cell loading size, 0.54Â M (60.0Â gÂ L -1 ) sodium lactate acting as co-substrate. Under these optimal conditions, 0.046Â M (R)-1b was produced with de (diastereomeric excess) value of 99.2% after 40Â H conversion.

Extract and Its Chemical Constituents\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAi-Ping Wang\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The objective of the present study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo hepatoprotective properties of Cichorium endivia L. extract (CEE, and to identify its chemical constituents. CEE significantly blocked the oxidative stress and cytotoxicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP in HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, oral administration of CEE to mice before the treatment of t-BHP exhibited a markedly protective effect by lowering serum levels of ALT and AST, inhibiting the changes in liver biochemistry including MDA, SOD, GSH and GST, as well as ameliorating the liver injuries according to the histopathological observations. According to the acute oral toxicity test, the LD50 of CEE was greater than 5,000 mg/kg, which demonstrates that the CEE can be considered practically non-toxic. Phytochemical analysis of CEE showed the presence of five compounds identified as 2-furanmethanol-(5'â11-1,3-cyclopentadiene-[5,4-c]-1H-cinnoline, which is a new cinnoline derivative derived from a natural source but not synthesis, 2-phenylethyl-Î²-D-glucopyranoside, kaempferol-3-O-Î²-D-glucoside, kaempferol, and adenosine. In the ORAC assay, CEE and its constituents kaempferol and kaempferol-3-O-Î²-D-glucoside had considerable antioxidant potency. Taken together, CEE protects hepatic tissue from oxidative damage in vitro and in vivo, potentially due to its phenolic substances, and does not cause acute oral toxicity, which suggests that CEE may be a valid and safe remedy to cure liver disease.\n\nCatalytic Activity of Î¼-Carbido-Dimeric Iron(IV) Octapropylporphyrazinate in the 3,5,7,2',4'-Pentahydroxyflavone Oxidation Reaction with tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTyurin, D.

The kinetics of this reaction are studied. It is shown the reaction proceeds via tentative formation of a complex between the catalyst and the oxidant, followed by OâO bond homolytic cleavage. The kinetics of the reaction is described in the coordinates of the Michaelis-Menten equation. A linear dependence of the apparent reaction rate constant on the concentration of the catalyst is observed, testifying to its participation in the limiting reaction step. The equilibrium constants and rates of interaction are found.

Li 2 O and ionic liquids were used as additive and stabilizers for the synthesis of the catalysts. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), N 2 absorption/desorption (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR), whereas, the oxidation reaction was followed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The as prepared catalysts exhibited good catalytic performance in terms of conversion and selectivity towards benzaldehyde. The performance of the Au-based catalysts is significantly higher than that of the Cu-based catalysts. For both Cu and Au catalysts, the conversion of benzyl alcohol increased as the reaction proceeds, while the selectivity for benzaldehyde decreased. Moreover, the catalysts can be easily recycled and reused with neither significant loss of activity nor selectivity. A kinetic study for the Cu and Au-catalyzed oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzyldehyde is reported. The rate at which the oxidation of benzyl alcohol is occurring as a function of\n\nTwo wheat glutathione peroxidase genes whose products are located in chloroplasts improve salt and H2O2 tolerances in Arabidopsis.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChao-Zeng Zhai\n\nFull Text Available Oxidative stress caused by accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS is capable of damaging effects on numerous cellular components. Glutathione peroxidases (GPXs, EC 1.11.1.9 are key enzymes of the antioxidant network in plants. In this study, W69 and W106, two putative GPX genes, were obtained by de novo transcriptome sequencing of salt-treated wheat (Triticum aestivum seedlings. The purified His-tag fusion proteins of W69 and W106 reduced H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP using glutathione (GSH or thioredoxin (Trx as an electron donor in vitro, showing their peroxidase activity toward H2O2 and toxic organic hydroperoxide. GFP fluorescence assays revealed that W69 and W106 are localized in chloroplasts. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR analysis showed that two GPXs were differentially responsive to salt, drought, H2O2, or ABA. Isolation of the W69 and W106 promoters revealed some cis-acting elements responding to abiotic stresses. Overexpression of W69 and W106 conferred strong tolerance to salt, H2O2, and ABA treatment in Arabidopsis. Moreover, the expression levels of key regulator genes (SOS1, RbohD and ABI1/ABI2 involved in salt, H2O2 and ABA signaling were altered in the transgenic plants. These findings suggest that W69 and W106 not only act as scavengers of H2O2 in controlling abiotic stress responses, but also play important roles in salt and ABA signaling.\n\nAn experimental and theoretical kinetic study of the reaction of OH radicals with tetrahydrofuran\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nGiri, Binod; Khaled, Fathi; SzÅri, Milá n; Viskolcz, Bé la; Farooq, Aamir\n\n2016-01-01\n\nby the rapid thermal decomposition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and a UV laser absorption technique was used to monitor the mole fraction of OH radicals.

The aim of this work was to determine the components of this herb and the individual constituents of GHE. In order to better understand this herb for AD treatment, we investigated the acetylcholinesterase (AChE inhibition and antioxidant activity of GHE as well as the protective effects to PC12 cells against cytotoxicity induced by tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP using in vitro assays. The antioxidant activities were assessed by measuring their capabilities for scavenging 1,1-diphenyl-2-picylhydrazyl (DPPH and 2-2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS free radical as well as in inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Our data showed that GHE exhibited certain activities against AChE and also is an efficient free radical scavenger, which may be helpful in preventing or alleviating patients suffering from AD.\n\nCLINICAL-PHARMACOLOGICAL VALUE OF TREATMENT EFFICIENCY OF BHP-PATIENTS BY ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.A.
