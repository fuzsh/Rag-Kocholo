How did each Etruscan city create its own identity, and how did they differ from each other? This innovative new series aspires to facilitate discussion of such issues among scholars and students of the ancient Mediterranean at large and thereby contribute to the vigorous dialogue currently underway regarding Etruscan culture and urbanism, state formation, trade and craft connectivity, and the socioeconomic characteristics of settlements in Etruria. The series uses an interdisciplinary approach grounded in the latest research in order to reveal the social, religious, economic, architectural, artistic, and civic fabric of each Etruscan city. This perspective highlights the unique Etruscan contribution to ancient Italy without relying heavily on previous methodologies that looked to Greece or Rome to explain Etruscan customs, culture, and traditions.\n\nCAERE Ed i te d b y N a nc y T ho m so n de G ru m m o n d a n d Lisa C .

Pie r acc ini\n\nNo comprehensive and up-­to-­date book dedicated to the great Etruscan city of Caere (modern Cerveteri, Italy) currently exists in English. Instead, to make sense of this ancient city we work from independent and diverse studies, in different languages and in various journals, exhibition catalogues, and monographs—a process that makes it difficult to acquire a satisfactory view of the city as a whole. As someone who has spent much time at Caere and attempted to introduce students to the city, I have found the absence of a unified and up-­to-­date volume on the topic challenging. The idea of writing a book dedicated to ancient Caere arose from an awareness of this lacuna in scholarship, but an even more important objective for the project was my desire to honor Mario A. Del Chiaro, my doctoral professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who inspired in me an interest in and love for the material culture of this great Etruscan city. He was directly responsible for bringing my attention to Caeretan stamped ware years ago. His own work has been preeminent in the study of red-­figure pottery produced at Caere and places him in the front rank of those who pioneered Etruscan studies in the United States. His prolific output as an archaeologist both in print and in the field is indicated by the list of his publications and excavations in appendix B of this publication. A recent exhibit dedicated to the Etruscan city of Caere took place at Lens (Musée du Louvre–­L ens), France, and Rome (Palazzo delle Esposizioni), Italy, in 2013–2014.1 Its impressive catalogue supplies recent descriptions and discussions of Caeretan material\n\n(both urban and funerary) and is a welcome contribution to the field of Etruscan Caere—especially because the last exhibits and catalogues exclusively devoted to Caere date to 1980 and 19862 and both focused on material solely from tombs. G. Nardi is near to completion of her lengthy and detailed book dedicated to ancient Caere, a publication eagerly awaited. Of special interest for all involved with the creation of the present volume is another book bringing great honor to Mario Del Chiaro and certainly relevant for issues concerning Etruscan cities, Les potiers d’Étrurie et leur monde: Contacts, échanges, transferts. Hommage à Mario A. Del Chiaro (Paris, 2014). From the initial goal of a unified book on Caere came the idea—formulated by Nancy Thomson de Grummond, to whom I am grateful—of doing a book series dedicated to all (or as many as possible) of the important Etruscan cities. The task seems daunting, but certainly necessary and worthwhile—not only for scholars who are already well versed in Etruscan art and archaeology, but more importantly for younger generations, who will now have textbooks available that cover each city’s early history, urban formation, sacred building programs, craft production, cemetery traditions, and the characteristic qualities seen in its art and cultural practices. Each of the planned volumes will offer, we hope, a fresh and intelligent synthesis with new perspectives and up-­to-­date distilled analysis. An international team of scholars (including long-­ time friends and young colleagues now working on Caere) has come together to honor Professor Del Chiaro here by writing chapters on various topics that\n\nxvi\n\nLisa C. Pieraccini\n\ncover a full range of subjects, such as Caere’s early history, economy and land, trade relations and contacts with other Mediterranean peoples, the urban plateau, tomb architecture and tomb painting, the temples, sanctuaries, and shrines, and the many craft products in clay, gold, and amber. The book is arranged generally in chronological order, insofar as practical. We also felt that it was important to provide detailed information about the local geography of Caere and its environs and Etruscan Italy in general; therefore an album of maps has been prepared with the greatest diligence under the guidance of Ingrid Edlund-­Berry, who worked with cartographers at the University of Texas, Austin, Jessica Trelogan and Beth Chichester. A generous grant from the von Bothmer Fund of the Archaeological Institute of America helped to make possible the enhancement of the illustrations. A time-\n\nline for Caere is provided as a study help (appendix A: “A Chronology of Caere”). Since the prose and poetry of the Etruscans have not survived, we are forced to rely on their material culture and fragmentary epigraphical records. Despite not having a large extant body of literature, the Etruscan civilization has left much for us to work with in its archaeological evidence. The careful task of such “deciphering,” with thorough interdisciplinary approaches, has been the focus of this study. It is the hope of the editors that this account will offer a new way of understanding ancient Caere. NOTES\n\n1. Lens-­Roma. 2. Gli Etruschi e Cerveteri; Monte Abatone.\n\nAck n owledgm ents\n\nLISA C. PIERACCINI\n\nMy greatest debt of gratitude goes to my PhD professor, Mario A. Del Chiaro, to whom this book is dedicated. I thank him for introducing me to the ancient city of Caere and planting the seed which has flourished into the present volume. I could not have taken on this task without the steadfast support and generous camaraderie provided by my co-­editor, Nancy Thomson de Grummond; it goes without saying that the book has benefited greatly from her wise counsel. Ingrid Edlund-­Berry and her cartography colleagues from the University of Texas, Austin—Jessica Trelogan and Beth Chichester—devoted much time to the maps in this volume, to the book’s great advantage. Giuliana Nardi, who has worked at Caere for many years, kindly allowed the use of her detailed map of Caere, for which I am grateful. Ercole Zapicchi has spent years accompanying me to tombs, temples, and shrines at ancient Caere and deserves mention here for his long-­standing support. I must acknowledge the debts incurred at museums and institutions that have allowed access to their collections of Caeretan material. The Villa Giulia Museum in Rome, in particular: Alfonsina Russo, Rita Cosentino, and Maria Laura Falsini (photo archives); the Museo Nazionale Cerite in Cerveteri, especially Sandro Dello Russo; and the Vatican Museums in Rome, especially Maurizio Sannibale and Rosanna Di Pinto. Two professional development grants from the University of California Berkeley made possible my sojourns in Italy\n\nduring the preparation of this book. Anna Trejo, my student from UC Berkeley, kindly worked on the Del Chiaro bibliography—for which I am grateful. I thank my family for their love and laughter and finally, my students for their questions, answers, and eagerness to learn more about the Etruscans. NANC Y THOMSON DE GRUMMOND\n\nI am thankful above all to Lisa Pieraccini for accepting me as her companion in this journey to the great Etruscan city of Caere. This volume, as noted elsewhere, is the first in a series for the University of Texas Press addressing the duodecim populi, the Twelve Peoples of the Etruscans. As editors of the overall series, we plan to pass the direction of subsequent volumes to other scholars; without announcing future volumes officially, we wish to express appreciation to those who have already begun to assemble them. Our special thanks go to the authors of the various chapters and chapter sections of the Caere volume. They have endured much as we have gone through the various stages from first drafts to final chapters and as we attempted to secure the best and most suitable images to illustrate their splendid essays. In particular, we acknowledge once again those who participated in the dedicated session on Caere at the meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America ( January 2013), an event that launched the Cities of the Etruscans series and encouraged us to think there would be considerable enthusiasm for our initiative. We appreciate enor-\n\nxviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nmously the support of the AIA, which continued further in the award of a publication grant from its von Bothmer Fund. Like Lisa, I am enormously grateful to those who have facilitated our searches and researches. In my labors as image editor, I was helped many times by Robbi Siegel of Art Resource, Inc. Other individuals who boosted our efforts and spirits in securing images, in addition to the authors themselves, include Fabio Colivicchi, Giovanni Colonna, Kevin Dicus, Flavio Enei, Rita Gianfelice, Daniele Maras, Marina Martelli, Anne Marie Nielsen, Bodil Bundgaard Rasmussen, J. G. Szilágyi, and René van Beek. Besides providing leadership in mapmaking, Ingrid Edlund-­Berry was always ready with good advice for any aspect of the project; she was a keen companion on a binge to explore by car and on foot Caere and its territory (including the heights of Tolfa!). Giovanna\n\nBagnasco Gianni taught me a great deal about Caere as she welcomed me to the neighboring city of Tarquinia, and Gilda Bartoloni, Orlando Cerasuolo, and Jacopo Tabolli were generous hosts at Veii. Stephan Steingräber arranged a day to treasure in a tour of the cemeteries and sites of old Caere. Above all, I take this occasion to thank Mario Del Chiaro for all he has done through the years for Etruscan studies in the United States. When I was a graduate student, he was well known as one of only three Etruscan specialists in the country. I hope that at least part of the satisfaction he may experience from reading this book will lie in the reminder that he pioneered a discipline that is now vigorous and flourishing, is pursued by numerous professors and students in the classroom and in the field, and is becoming known to the public as far more than “those mysterious Etruscans”!\n\nInt ro d u c t i on to th e Volu m e L i s a C. Pie r acc ini\n\nRoman writers were among the first to describe Etruscan cities, referring to the renowned duodecim populi of the Etruscans,1 a league of Twelve Peoples that met annually at the communal shrine of Fanum Voltumnae (Livy 4.23.5). Although a complete roster has not survived, many scholars agree that the following cities should be included in the group of twelve:2 Arretium (modern Arezzo; Etruscan name unknown); Kaiserie (Cerveteri); Clevsin (Chiusi); Curtun (Cortona); Persna (Perugia); Pupluna (Populonia); Veia (Veii); Tarchna (Tarquinia); Vetluna (Vetulonia); Velathri (Volterra); Velzna (Orvieto); and Velch (Vulci). Romans described the wealth and beauty of many Etruscan cities as well as the long sieges of seemingly impenetrable cities like Veii. The fame of Etruria, according to Greeks and Romans, was due to its people’s vast trade relations, fertile lands, religious practices, and formidable cities. In effect, these cities were the earliest urban centers in ancient Italy. Looking at how they grew from hut settlements to wealthy and powerful urban centers is not only vital to understanding Etruscan history, culture, and society, but ancient Italy in general. The more we examine the period between the ninth and seventh centuries BCE in Etruria, the more we recognize that Iron Age communities were literally the “bedrock” of Etruscan culture. Excavations at Caere, Veii, and Tarquinia, to cite just a few of the largest known Etruscan cities, clearly demonstrate an increase of wealth, trade, and social differentiation in the early Iron Age. It appears that this “proto-­” or “semi-­” urban period marked the transition from village to city for\n\nmany Etruscan settlements.3 But how these Iron Age villages transformed from clusters of huts to civic centers with paved roads, gates, and temples, can only be studied on an individual basis—as Etruscan cities developed at their own pace and many variables determined such developments. Nevertheless, there are fundamental indicators of such transformation that apply to all Etruscan cities, for example, the location of a settlement (preferably on a high outcrop with natural defensive cliffs), access to water and trade routes, agricultural resources, mineral wealth, and specialized craft production—not to mention social factors as indicators of “state” such as religious ideas, language, kinship structures, and culture.4 As research continues to focus on the earliest phases of Etruscan communities, villages, and cities, we will gain more knowledge about Etruscan urbanism and its legacy throughout ancient Italy. But what is increasingly clear, as C. Riva has argued, is that Etruscan urbanism is an indigenous phenomenon and not a by-­product of Greek urbanization.5 The present volume does not attempt to discuss theoretical issues related to urbanism in Etruria, but rather it strives to combine and analyze material culture from the urban and funerary landscape at Caere in order to better understand the city. The very word “city” implies an intrinsic marker for “civilization” and it is precisely this topic—namely, the civilization within the confines of the city—that this volume aims to explore. With this in mind, we are aware that the larger view of\n\nxx\n\nLisa C. Pieraccini\n\na “city” includes the hinterlands,6 and ports and areas outside the city and necropoleis proper, which are also examined here. In the case of Caere, the tombs were the first-­ discovered indicators of the “city’s” ancient past (see chapter 9, by Steingräber and chapter 10, by Naso, as well as chapter 25, by de Grummond). Urban sanctuaries, however, were among the first civic areas actually to be excavated, as best illustrated by the large votive deposit discovered in 1826 near the Manganello sanctuary and temple. The unearthing of other rich votive deposits soon followed, including the Vignaccia deposit (although the temple has yet to be excavated; see Nagy, chapter 20) and the “Temple of Hera” in the Vigna Parrocchiale (see Bellelli, chapter 5, and de Grummond, chapter 13). Excavations of the Vigna Parrocchiale and Sant’Antonio no doubt have broadened the view of the urban and religious landscape at Caere and make it possible to discuss issues related to temple architecture and decoration (Lulof and Winter, chapter 11), local workshops (see chapter 14, by Camporeale, as well as Rasmussen, chapter 15; Pieraccini, chapter 17; de Grummond, chapter 16; De Puma, chapter 18; Causey, chapter 19; Nagy, chapter 20; Roncalli, chapter 21; Harari, chapter 22; and Ambrosini, chapter 23), and the sacred urban practices that form part of the social and religious indicators of a city. Inscriptions reveal a great deal about society, religion, ritual, and myth as understood at Caere (Wallace, chapter 4; and Bonfante, chapter 6). Roads and gates were identified last century in addition to Caere’s main civic center so that we are in a much better position to discuss the topographical aspects of the city as well as the total context of the Caeretan territory (Edlund-­Berry, chapter 2). Excavations at the harbor installation at Pyrgi have in some ways transformed our thinking about the city on the plateau (Michetti, chapter 7). If we consider that cities should be analyzed as bodies of material, then Caere stands out as an impressive urban complex with abundant and varied material culture dating from the eighth to third centuries BCE (see especially Torelli, chapters 1 and 24, and Cerasuolo, chapter 3). Relatively few dated events have been recorded at Caere, but the incident of the stoning of Greek prisoners after the Battle of the Sar-\n\ndinian Sea ca. 540 BCE reveals details of history, health, and religious practices (Turfa, chapter 8). The tombs have enabled us to trace the collective funerary ideology of Caere, and this information can now be combined with the results of excavations of the urban area, such as the sanctuaries, temples, and civic buildings (e.g., the elliptical building at the Vigna Parrocchiale and the hypogeum of Clepsina) to produce a more comprehensive and wide-­ranging assessment of the city (see Bellelli, chapter 5). Combining the two areas greatly enlarges a body of knowledge that was, just a century ago, based almost exclusively on funerary evidence. The following chapters, therefore, present up-­to-­date analysis with new perspectives that allow for a fuller and deeper understanding of the urban fabric of ancient Caere. NOTES\n\n1.

We favor using Etruscan names of gods instead of the names of their counterparts in Greece and Rome, as has so often been done in the past. But since much of earlier scholarship was based on the premise that\n\nEtruscan culture was somehow peripheral to these other cultures, many terms have become so firmly embedded (e.g., names of Greek vases) that eliminating them would sever current studies from those of the past. These terms are normally retained, but at the same time we have made an effort to indicate more broadly what such words mean.\n\nA LBU M OF M APS\n\nMAP 1. The Mediterranean.

H. Lawrence’s Etruscan Places. According to Dennis, “Remote as are the days of the Etruscans, this city boasts a far prior antiquity. It was originally called Agylla.”1 He goes on to assert, “It was at least Pelasgic and of very remote antiquity.” Lawrence, who was particularly interested in the contrast between Etruscan and Roman character traits, puts it bluntly: “[Caere] was a gay and gaudy Etruscan city when Rome put up her first few hovels: probably. Anyhow, there are tombs there now.”2 Like so much of Etruscan history, the importance of Caere in the preserved historical sources is usually evaluated according to its relation to Rome. The city is reported to have been in conflict with Rome on several occasions during the reign of the Tarquins (Dionysios of Halikarnassos, Roman Antiquities 3.58 and 4.27), but also to have served as a place of safekeeping for the sacred objects of Rome when it was invaded by Gauls (Livy 5.40 and 5.50). Tarquinius Superbus went there after he was exiled from Rome in 509 BCE (Livy 1.60.2), all according to the traditional historical accounts, and Roman boys were sent to Caere for their education (Livy 9.36.3). At some point after 390 BCE, Caere was awarded partial citizen rights in Rome, as a civitas sine suffragio, from which developed the use of the Tabulae Caeritum by the censors in Rome as a tool to limit citizen rights for Romans as well (Strabo 5.2.3). If then the Roman sources tend to portray Caere as at times a convenient errand boy ready to act on\n\nRome’s behalf, and at other times an annoying neighbor with visions of grandeur, it is indeed fortunate that we have a wealth of independent archaeological material that helps create a more nuanced appreciation of the city. The archaeological evidence is of course vast, but it is thanks to the chapters in this volume that we can catch a glimpse of Caere’s true grandeur, and the many different areas in which she stood out as one of Etruria’s most important centers, perhaps the most influential in some aspects of her historical and cultural role. As presented in this volume, Caere was well equipped to produce the types of buildings, monuments, and objects that its citizens required. While skilled workers from other parts of the Mediterranean may well have visited or lived in Caere proper or in the harbor town of Pyrgi, we must not underestimate the phenomenal local effort involved in creating a center of production, providing raw materials such as clay, artisans to produce molds and casts, technicians to develop well-­functioning kilns, and merchants to create a source of commerce involving local trade as well as long-­distance travel to other markets. And all this was happening while Caere was searching out its own identity, politically and culturally, within the immediate surroundings of powerful neighbors such as Tarquinia, Veii, and Rome. Caere definitely created a profile of independence, of artistic creativity, and of tremendous entrepreneurial skill in dealing with the local population as well as foreign visitors, some of whom may have settled there to act as the source of experimentation with materials, forms, and ideas.\n\n2\n\nIngrid Edlund-Berry\n\nWhen the architectural remains of the monumental tombs at Caere are combined with the evidence of buildings from within the city proper, structures sacred as well as secular, many adorned with architectural terracottas, evidence of city planning in its streets, walls, and gates as well as the roads connecting it with neighboring settlements, and the deposits of votive offerings, all these features suggest that Caere was a highly developed community with a well-­defined political system that supported commercial activities at the highest level. It was only thanks to its own local political system that Caere was able to operate within the confines of its powerful neighbors as well as internationally, as indicated by the treasury the city set up at Delphi in Greece. While the constant influx of imported objects is a sign of its commercial network, we\n\nmust not forget that Caere, along with her neighbors, was part of the confederation of twelve (or fifteen) Etruscan peoples, aimed at providing mutual support in spite of individual differences, and thus forming a solid yet flexible coalition intended to maintain Etruscan independence among the constituent cities while at the same time benefiting from the obvious commercial advantages of extensive trade and communication within Italy and, further afield, throughout the Mediterranean. NOTES\n\n1. G. Dennis, The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria (London, 1907), 2:19. 2. D. H. Lawrence, Etruscan Places (New York, 1957), 11.\n\nc hapter 1\n\nT h e Hi story Mar io To r e lli\n\nLike virtually all the cities of maritime Etruria between the mouths of the Tiber and the Arno rivers, Caere, called by the Greeks Agylla, but whose ancient Etruscan name has been reconstructed as *kaiserie (later Caisri, Caisra, and Cisra),1 is situated on top of a low, extended plateau, easily defensible and close to the coast, but not directly on the seashore (see maps 2–4). North and south of the plateau are two streams, respectively called Fosso del Manganello and Fosso della Mola, which separate the inhabited area on the plateau from the adjoining hills (see map 6 ). The main cemeteries of historical times, the Banditaccia and Monte Abatone, flank the city proper, while a third, less extended necropolis, that of the Sorbo, is on a smaller and lower hill southwest of the urban plateau.2 The rise of the city in Etruria and Rome is a question intensely discussed in the last fifty years.3 In spite of all these discussions, the urban organism and its development at Caere are still under examination. The process behind the creation of a city at Caere seems to be most similar to that of Tarquinia. In the tenth and ninth centuries BCE, during the time frame known internationally as the Iron Age, and in Etruria as the Villanovan period, Tarquinia shows a clear plurality of villages, spread in a wide extension, each with its own small cemetery. By the mid eighth century BCE these cemeteries were replaced by just one single necropolis, that of Monterozzi, on the site of a previous Iron Age settlement, more or less following the same process visible in Rome, where, again toward the middle of the eighth century, one great necropolis came to substitute for a plurality of small cemeteries belong-\n\ning to a number of villages spread all over the future urban space. As far as Caere is concerned, at the beginning of the Iron Age (tenth and ninth centuries BCE), two cemeteries are known, the one at the Cava della Pozzolana northeast of the ancient town, and the one at Sorbo on the southwest, themselves at the origin of two main cemeteries of historical times (see map 6 ). There is no proof of the existence of a Villanovan Iron Age phase of the extensive necropolis of Monte Abatone. There is evidence that the “Elliptical Building” ( fig. 5.7; pl. 6 ) at Vigna Parrocchiale in the center of the town, a construction of around 480 BCE,4 was a sort of sacred enclosure encircling a space formerly occupied by an Iron Age cemetery. If the hypothesis is correct, we would have a cemetery in the center of the future town of Caere, abandoned (but later religiously enclosed) when the period of formation of the town was definitely over. Though the publication of the Iron Age cemeteries is far from complete,5 the Villanovan culture of Caere appears to be lesser in quantity and quality in comparison with that of the great neighboring cities Tarquinia, Veii, and Vulci. The appearance of a complex social structure at Caere belongs to the early years of the seventh century BCE, at the beginning of the Orientalizing period, with a sudden explosion of an impressive opulence, evidenced by tomb contents. The chamber tombs, after a tentative appearance at the end of the eighth century BCE, from 680 BCE on acquire a monumental size. Starting with the Tomb of the Hut,6 we may easily appreciate the main characteristics of the\n\n6\n\nMario Torelli\n\nCaeretan cemeteries from the seventh to the fourth centuries BCE, namely, the presence of mounds above the upper structure of the underground tombs and the imitation, carved in the soft tufa bedrock, of architecture resembling the interior of private dwellings. The funerary architecture allows us to follow the evolution of the princely residences, from the primitive huts to the long rectangular houses (680–630 BCE), up to the more sophisticated, almost palatial buildings covered with heavy terracotta roofs and embellished by porticoes and courtyards of the last decades of the seventh century BCE.7 This evolution has a specific significance not only for historians of architecture but also for historians in general, as it constitutes precious evidence of social and political changes. The emergence of the chamber tombs at the end of the eighth century BCE is one of the clearest indicators of the waning of a prehistoric, tribe-­based solidarity that had been founded on kinship. It demonstrates the replacement of these relationships with the economic and juridical forms connected with the nuclear family. Such a new social organization was the cradle of a powerful aristocracy of gentilicial families, or clans, whose political control on society was founded on the employment of nonkinsmen dependents for the land and military work; these individuals belonged to the serf class, which Latin sources called servi and the Greek authors called penestai.8 The sudden surge of wealth at Caere at the beginning of the seventh century BCE is surely the consequence of the triumph of the new gentilicial order and of the wide control that a small group of families had over the exploitation of the land. It is likely, however, that these economic factors were then connected to a second crucial activity, already known in other great Etruscan centers, but only now for the first time attested at Caere—the aristocratic practices of piracy and commerce, an activity that Greeks named idie prexis, i.e., “private affairs.”9 In its Etruscan version such idie prexis meant mainly privateering and close control of the transformation and exchange of metals, of iron in particular.10 The aristocratic interest of the Etruscans in seafaring is clearly shown by the widespread popularity of images of ships on pottery from the ninth century BCE on.11 The most impressive\n\nevidence of such interest in the Caeretan aristocratic milieu is the monumental fresco representing a ship painted above a funerary bed in the main chamber of the Tomb of the Ship (but no longer visible today).12 The seafaring and mercantile activities of Caere were also the cause of its close relationships with the entire Greek world (see map 1), which were greater than those of any other Etruscan city at that time.13 Thus Caere possessed a treasury in the great Panhellenic sanctuary at Delphi,14 a privilege that it shared with another maritime town, Spina,15 the sole commercial port of the Etruscan cities in the Po River valley. These special relations both with the mercantile activities and with the Greek world, described by D. Musti,16 are responsible for the undisputed primacy of Caeretan craftmanship during the entire Archaic period and for its strong Hellenizing flavor,17 as shown by Italo-­ Geometric pottery, the bucchero wares, and the products of the workshop of the Caeretan hydrias, not to mention the epigraphic materials attesting the presence of a Greek-­speaking community at Caere.18 The exceptional wealth of the princely tombs of the seventh century BCE is especially documented by the great amount of personal jewelry and by the silver and bronze vessels of Eastern origin, that, together with objects produced locally, formed the grave goods of the only tomb belonging to the ruling class of the Early Orientalizing period that has reached us miraculously intact: the Regolini-­Galassi Tomb in the Sorbo necropolis (see figs. 18.1–18.3, 19.1).19 It was found in the center of a great mound surrounded by a series of peripheral, later tombs of the same family.20 But the Regolini-­Galassi Tomb was not an isolated example of wealth. Old and new21 discoveries demonstrate that in seventh-­century BCE Caere, perhaps more explicitly than in other south Etruscan cities, power was the object of fierce strife involving a small number of wealthy families. These families were in possession of conspicuous means and even private armed troops. It is not difficult to imagine that the competition could easily turn bloody, in an open conflict with the official power of the king.22 The presence in Archaic Caere of dominant figures, heads of extended and powerful clans documented by the archaeological evidence, is inscriptionally matched\n\nThe History7\n\nby individuals who have contributed to the formation of crucial Etruscan and Latin myths, like Laucie Mezentie, whose name is scratched on an impasto cup from an unknown tomb in Caere (see fig. 4.4).23 Laucie Mezentie or someone of his family gave rise to one of the main figures of Trojan myth in Latium, the cruel tyrant of Caere, Mezentius, celebrated by Virgil in the Aeneid.24 The formation of the Mezentius myth is more complicated than it appears, however. In fact, as C. de Simone25 has argued, the name may be a generic term for an administrator that came to be used for a particular individual. It is not difficult to suppose that the whole social structure must have undergone substantial changes as a result of the tensions that no doubt accompanied the political expressions of the enormous riches of Caere in the seventh century BCE. Up to the first decades of the sixth century BCE, new chambers were created inside the major mound tombs (tumuli), a phenomenon that marks the existence of a remarkable continuity of several gentilicial clans. In some instances, as in tumulus II of the Banditaccia necropolis, we can follow for more than two centuries an aristocratic lineage, from its beginning at the dawn of the seventh century BCE up to the central years of the fifth century BCE.26 The greatest tumuli are surrounded by a cluster of smaller mounds, each containing a single tomb for a couple or for a small family; such groupings constitute a three-­ dimensional representation of the dominant social structure. The rather inconspicuous families buried in these smaller tombs were patently dependent on the clans buried in the monumental tumuli, bound to the aristocratic groups by ties of solidarity—the core of the typical Etruscan serfdom. We can detect such a social order not only in the city of the dead but also in that of the living. Modern research has recognized that all through the seventh and sixth centuries BCE in Etruria there were in each settlement one or more dwellings belonging to families of high social standing, and decorated with splendid figured architectural terracottas.27 Caere was no exception. The building discovered by M. Cristofani at Vigna Parrocchiale28 can be described as a “palace,” or regia, possibly one of the various examples of such buildings that existed in Caere.\n\nA significant change takes place, however, at the beginning of the sixth century BCE. In the Banditaccia necropolis the apparent disorder of the Orientalizing period is replaced by an organization in which the tombs are arranged along rectilinear, sometimes orthogonal streets, such as the streets called “of the Caeretan Mountains” (dei Monti Ceriti), “of the Tolfa Mountains” (dei Monti della Tolfa), and Fifth and Seventh Streets. In these tombs only the interior section, where the funerary depositions were placed, was excavated in the tufa rock. The exteriors were largely built with square blocks to form cubic structures, a type now referred to as the tombe a dado (“tombs in the shape of a cube”).29 Besides giving us a vivid image of the possible aspect of the real streets of the town, this new typology of tombs embodies a historical datum of primary importance: in this period the Etruscan cities (and Rome, too) are trying to reform the social order according to principles that the Greek political vocabulary called isonomia, i.e., an organization where all the members of the same class enjoyed equal rights. At Caere, no new tumuli were built, but the space given to these tombe a dado appears to be a limited one, different from Volsinii (Orvieto), where the tombs of all the cemeteries (Cannicella, Crocifisso del Tufo, Fontana del Leone) were built in this regular, isonomic way. We may then conclude that in the early sixth century BCE there were important experiments of constitutional reforms in the direction of the Greek isonomia, to oppose tyrannical rule. A good confirmation of this rather general political situation at the beginning of the sixth century BCE comes from the analogous isonomic experiments attempted in contemporary Rome, where the trend took the more radical shape of Servius Tullius’s constitutional reforms.30 In this way, at the beginning of the sixth century BCE each Etruscan city, although preserving much of the previous social structure of the Orientalizing period, was transformed from a sort of confederation of powerful clans into a real urban organism that may be compared with the Greek polis. New social classes, easily recognizable from their choice of the new typology of the tombs, were born and quite certainly obtained enlargements of the civic bodies through which they could express their status. In the sixth cen-\n\n8\n\nMario Torelli\n\ntury BCE, in most of the greatest Etruscan cities, like Tarquinia, Vulci, Clusium, and Volaterrae, we witness a parallel phenomenon that perhaps had already started in the late Iron Age—the growth in size and population of the major towns resulting from the conquest and abandonment of the minor centers within a range of twenty to thirty miles. These smaller settlements, less extended and therefore less powerful than the greater cities, were very likely each governed by a single aristocratic clan. These prominent groups lived in princely dwellings, which were luxuriously decorated with architectural terracottas and functioned as a palace where the head of the clan controlled both the sacred and the judicial sphere and could head the local army.31 Thanks to the excavations of a number of foreign scientific teams—the Swedish at Acquarossa, the Americans at Murlo, the Germans and the French at Castellina del Marangone—we now happen to know quite a lot about the appearance of these princely residences of the seventh to sixth centuries BCE and of the minor Etruscan towns. The conquest and the destruction of these minor centers and—we may surmise—the transfer of the subjugated community into the major, victorious towns must have been a constant phenomenon all through Etruria for the entire Archaic period, with an acceleration in the final decades of the sixth century BCE.32 Caere shows no exception to this trend, in spite of the lack of modern excavations in minor centers around the ancient town, which later in the fourth and third centuries BCE sometimes play the role of oppida and castella, that is, fortified places to control land and routes. For the Archaic period we happen to know some imposing Orientalizing tombs at these sites. Archaeological evidence tells us that the early sites of Alsium, Ceri, and Tragliatella, minor power centers of the Orientalizing period, entered the Caeretan sphere during the sixth century BCE. At Alsium we know of imposing Archaic tumuli, explored (with unfortunate results) in 1838–1839.33 Ceri, an Archaic fortified site of some importance, has produced a rock-­cut tomb with two seated figures (see fig. 3.6 ), one with a scepter and the other with a lituus, or sacred wand, clearly representing men in possession of power.34 Recent Franco-­German explorations have added to this evidence, thanks to the\n\ndiscovery at Castellina del Marangone,35 a fortified site not far from the Tyrrhenian Sea, about fourteen miles north of Caere, of a princely house decorated with figured architectural terracottas. This site, inhabited from the ninth century BCE to the beginning of the fifth, was abandoned and reoccupied around the middle of the fourth century BCE, and was definitively deserted after the Roman conquest in 273 BCE. At the beginning of the sixth century BCE Caere finally assumes a definite urban aspect. We must date to that time the first documented phase of the city walls,36 extended for six kilometers, and a number of monumental temples, which adorned first the town37 and subsequently the port of Pyrgi.38 The buildings are known only for a few of these cult places, like the sanctuary of the Manganello, and some of the more recent explorations, like the twin temples of the Sant’Antonio area, perhaps sacred to Hercle and Turms.39 Other areas, like the Vigna Parrocchiale, contain both sanctuaries and possibly civic buildings.40 Though modern research is still incomplete at this time, the civic buildings of the city must be sought in a rather central place in the town, more or less at the meeting point of the two main axes that cross the plateau (see map 6 ). This is in an area between two nineteenth-­century vineyards, the Vigna Parrocchiale, where a temple and the aforementioned elliptical enclosure are known and where in the Roman times the theater would be built,41 and the Vigna Marini-­Vitalini, where we have evidence for one or even two great temples.42 Significantly, in this latter area C. Genucius Clepsina, founder of the Roman-­era municipium in 273 BCE,43 would place the sanctuary of the Lares Publici of the new Roman Caere.44 For the entire sixth century BCE the social and political dynamics at Caere progress at an accelerated rate. This period sees a series of epoch-­making events, starting from the sea battle in the Sardinian Sea (often referred to as the Battle of Alalia; ca. 535 BCE) between the Phokaians and the Etruscans of Caere, who were allied with the Carthaginians.45 Probably later, in the fourth century BCE, this alliance would develop into an Etrusco-­Carthaginian isopoliteia, a community of citizenship, known to Aristotle.46 Also for Caere, in the background of many events we have eventually to imagine the diffused presence of armed brotherhoods,\n\nThe History9\n\nlike the one headed by the brothers Avle and Caile Vipinas (Aulus and Caelius Vibenna), active between Vulci and Rome.47 Archaeology reveals a situation of political, social, and military instability in the years around 500 BCE; this evidence is confirmed by literary sources concerning Rome, which describe the end of the monarchy there. In the birth of republican states, however, we have to reconstruct the existence of a variety of intermediate situations, and what happens at Caere in this moment is a precious confirmation of that. A man called Thefarie Velianas, revealed by the famous golden tablets inscribed in Etruscan and Phoenician found in the great sanctuary of Uni/Astarte at Pyrgi (see pl. 9), claims to have acquired a powerful political position (in Etruscan zilath, equivalent to the Latin praetor; in Phoenician mlk, i.e., “king”), thanks to the intervention of the goddess, with whom he pretends to have celebrated a “hierogamy,” a “sacred marriage” in pure Oriental style.48 G. Colonna has published a group of inscriptions scratched on the walls of a rather inconspicuous tomb in the necropolis of the Banditaccia that give another perspective on the same Thefarie Velianas. He was apparently the central figure in the creation of relationships among members of different families, resembling those of a Greek hetaireia, an association which worked as a political party.49 No matter which strategies he employed to obtain the power and how long he possessed it, his “kingship” (as the Phoenician inscription references his status) arguably looks more similar to the power of a Greek tyrant than that of an Archaic king or magistrate as he is in fact presented in the tablets. The unusual figure of Thefarie Velianas marks the change from the Archaic past, characterized by bloody struggles between families and factions and by territorial expansion of the city, to the Classical period. The entire fifth century BCE at Caere has many features in common with the rest of Etruria. At that time the city-­states, having reached the boundaries of historical times, possessed territories of considerable size. In such huge territories minor settlements seem either to no longer exist, to be destined for territorial defense, or even to be occupied by groups of serfs, as shown by a good example of such centers, the site of Ghiac-\n\ncio Forte in the territory of Vulci.50 The conspicuous consumption of the ruling classes is now over and, as a consequence, the quantity and quality of the craftsmanship have considerably declined. After a century or more of strong competition, in 470 BCE families and sanctuaries ceased to vie in the construction of more and more sumptuous monuments. Only by the end of the fifth century BCE is there a sort of resurrection of both artisanal production and building activity and a contemporary reoccupation of the satellite settlements of oppida and castella. Even if the severe naval reverses, at Cumae in 474 BCE and at Lipara several times in the fifth century BCE, were not relevant to the emergence of economic difficulties, this period, coinciding with the greatest part of the fifth century BCE, has been described in the past by historians and archaeologists as a moment of crisis. This assumption is partial and incorrect. It is more accurate to interpret the “crisis” as the clearest economic and social expression of an oligarchic choice by the Etruscan ruling classes, parallel to the one made around 470 BCE by the patricians in Rome. Finally, in Rome as in Etruria, the neat separation between classes put an end to social mobility, which through almost four centuries—between the middle of the eighth and the beginning of the fifth century BCE—had enabled a remarkable capacity for advancement through the strata of society.51 The renewal of building activity and the resumption of craft activities—markers of the new expansion of Etruria and of Caere in particular between the beginning of the fourth century BCE and the Roman conquest—are to be connected with the formation of a new society, with various aspects similar to the patricio-­ plebeian noble class of the Roman mid-­Republic. This new class had brand-­new preferences for its sepulchers.52 There is a prevalence of wide, square underground chambers with a great number of plain funerary beds surrounding a central shrine area, as in the Tomb of the Alcove belonging to the Tarnas family, or with niches in the walls, as in the Tomb of the Inscriptions (Tarchna family)53 and the Tomb of the Reliefs (Matuna family).54 There are even tombs built with barrel vaults, like the monumental tomb in the small peripheral necropolis of Greppe di Sant’Angelo.55 Fur-\n\n10\n\nMario Torelli\n\nther, there are also experiments in pictorial or stuccoed decoration. Tombs may contain decorated sarcophagi, as in the Tomb of the Sarcophagi (Apucu family) and the Tomb of the Tamsnie family.56 All these changes in funerary customs and lifestyle presuppose a completely new society, although one that is based again on gentilicial families and still has strong expectations for a future of very long, strongly intertwined lineages. The foundations of agricultural production, however, now rest on a social structure different from that of the past. Even though the elite class resumes the building of new temples and restores the old ones, we perceive the existence of a new impetus for the dedication of votive gifts in the sanctuaries, which are less luxurious than in the past, molded in clay instead of being cast in bronze. The huge deposits of such votive gifts57 are the best representation of the new social class that replaced the serfs: it possessed some freedom and autonomy, but definitely did not belong to the dominant elite. In the fourth and third centuries BCE the popular custom of dedicating terracotta ex-­votos, statuettes, and above all reproductions of anatomical parts aims to leave in the cult places tangible evidence of a faith in divine interventions or gratitude for what the individual has received from the gods. To the historian they reveal the end of the social system founded on serfdom. Perhaps following Archaic traditions, this new Caeretan society chose to follow, at the beginning of the fourth century BCE, the policy of a close friendship with Rome. Caeretans did not understand that this decision was simply paving the way for eventual conflict—and therefore destined to put an end to their old and glorious city. Livy tells us of an episode of Fabius Rullianus’s wars in 310 BCE,58 in which the aristocratic Fabius showed a perfect command of the Etruscan language; as the Paduan historian records, at that time the sons of the Roman patricians used to go to Caere to receive proper instruction. As we shall discuss later in this volume,59 Rome thus entered Caere a century before her brutal conquest of the old metropolis in 273 BCE.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. See the discussion by R.

Marconi Cosentino 1995:9 Iam Caeretanos demonstrat navita fines: aevo deposuit nomen Agylla vetus. Then the sailor shows the Caeretan boundaries; with time Agylla has lost its old name. Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, De reditu suo 225– 226 Even long after ancient Caere, known to the Greeks as Agylla, had declined, the late Roman poet Namatianus was eager to describe the coastline and land that once secured her status as the second-­largest Etruscan city, smaller than Veii to the south but larger than her northern neighbor, Tarquinia.1 Although located inland, the city of Caere benefited from its access to the sea and the harbors located along the coast, as discussed elsewhere in this volume.2 In addition, however, the presence of natural resources— the mines in the Tolfa Mountains and the fertile soil around the city—contributed to Caere’s strong position within the confederation of Etruscan cities and also allowed her to hold her own in relation to Rome well into the third and second centuries BCE (see maps 2–3; pl. 1). Like so many areas of Italy, modern Cerveteri and the surrounding territory in the province of Lazio offer a variety of scenery. Ranging from wooded mountainous areas around Tolfa and Allumiere to gently sloping hills and lush fields, interspersed with streams, the\n\nlandscape encompasses winding roads and clusters of farmhouses with hill towns overlooking their immediate territory. Along the coast, the sea provides an open horizon, and to the east, the waters of Lake Bracciano form a basin linking the land of Cerveteri to her inland neighbors. It may be tempting to superimpose the landscape of today onto the remains of Etruscan settlements, cemeteries, roads, and sacred spaces in order to create a feel for the habitat of the ancient Etruscans in the territory of Caere. But in addition to obvious modern additions such as highways, large factories, and commercial and residential establishments, we would have to take into account the effect of the changing sea level, erosion, climate change, and other factors which with time have altered not only the appearance of the landscape, but also how it is used.3 Much has been written about the beauty and variety of the Etruscan landscape overall, but here the focus is on the territory of Caere and the evidence for how this city and its countryside interacted in antiquity.4 As can be expected, the available data is limited, but may serve to document the many ways in which Caere played a vital role in the development and strength of Etruscan, and to some extent also Roman, culture. LANDSCAPE AND N AT U R A L R E S O U R C E S\n\nNon è facile riscostruire il paesaggio agrario dell’Etruria antica: le trasformazioni subite nel corso del tempo, e sopratutto l’impoverimento e l’abbandono delle campagne,\n\n16\n\nIngrid Edlund-Berry\n\niniziato in età romana, impediscono di cogliere, in tutti i suoi dettagli, una situazione che doveva essere comunque piuttosto fiorente. Cianferoni 2005:87 Like so many Etruscan cities, the city hill of Caere was flanked by water, the streams Manganello and Mola (the latter also known as Fosso Vaccina; Caeritis amnis, Vergil, Aeneid 8.597).5 The surrounding territory was defined by the geology of the area, and by the natural boundaries created by the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, the rivers Mignone to the north and Arrone to the south, and Lake Bracciano to the east (see maps 3 and 6 ). As today, the territory provided convenient access to neighboring communities and Caere could rely on its location and resources to create and maintain active commerce both on land and at sea. The primary geological features of the territory of Caere6 were the Tolfa Mountains and the crater lakes created by volcanic eruptions during the Pliocene Epoch.7 The landscape thus created gave rise to the earliest settlements, which benefited from the access to minerals, fertile soil, and water.\n\nMinerals An important resource for the wealth of Caere were the mineral deposits in the Tolfa Mountains (see pl. 2), where there is evidence of human presence as early as the Paleolithic period.8 During the Later and Final Bronze Age, scattered settlements were located near ore deposits containing copper, lead, iron, cinnabar, and alum, and exploitation of minerals continued into the Iron Age.9 Intense mining in later periods and changes in the patterns of agriculture and forestry make it difficult to document the earliest exploitation of the mineral resources in the area. The location of the Bronze Age settlements is taken as evidence for the extraction of alum already in antiquity, activity which is otherwise best documented from the Renaissance until the twentieth century.10 As for other minerals, fragments of slag dispersed through the area suggest a period of intensive production within the Tolfa Mountains that was interrupted in the eighth century BCE, perhaps as a\n\nresult of changes in population, trade patterns, or social stratification.11 Although this is difficult to prove through specific datable archaeological evidence, the mineral resources seem to have continued to guarantee a source of livelihood for the inhabitants who settled in the surrounding valleys in the seventh century BCE and later, and provided opportunities for trade by sea and on land between the city of Caere and her neighbors.\n\nSoil and Vegetation Since the area around the city of ancient Caere has been both cultivated and inhabited continuously since prehistoric times, the best evidence for the use of the land comes from studies of habitation and burial patterns.12 These suggest that the area was occupied by individual farmhouses as well as clusters, but that the distribution varied with time and location. Land divisions suggest the size of individual farms, and the yield of grain and other crops provided a livelihood for the rural population as well as opportunities for trade. In spite of deforestation through the centuries, the Tolfa Mountains in particular must have been heavily forested in antiquity; these trees would have provided the fuel for the processing of iron and other minerals. Wood was also needed for shipbuilding and for the kilns, used for the production of terracotta tiles and pottery.13 Evidence for the kinds of trees grown in antiquity in the territory of Caere comes from a reference to silver fir trees in Vergil’s Aeneid 8.599 (nigra nemus abiete cingunt), which has been corroborated by remains found in a well at temple A at Pyrgi, which contains samples of silver fir (abies) and oak (quercus).14 Studies of modern varieties of oak and other trees confirm the diversity of the area’s flora, especially in the Tolfa Mountains, today much appreciated for hiking and nature trails.15\n\nWater In addition to the long coastline along the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, and the shores of Lake Bracciano to the east, Caere benefited from the many rivers and streams that permeate the landscape even today. The\n\nTopography and Natural Resources, Agriculture and Economy17\n\nlarger rivers, including the Mignone River (see pl. 3), provided connecting links from coast to inland, and may also have served as boundaries between the land of the living and the cemeteries, and between communities. Also, as suggested by the ancient sources, the navigability of a river had an important role in the economy of an area.16 A spring with healing waters is known from Valle Zuccara, east of the city of Caere,17 and the Aquae Caeretes (Caeretanae), mentioned by Livy (22.1.10) and Strabo (5.2.3), have been identified as a Roman bath complex at Piano della Carlotta at Sasso, inland from Sasso di Furbara (see map 4).18 Other sources of excellent water turned into Roman baths have been located at Civitavecchia (Aquae Tauri), Centumcellae, Bagni di Stigliano, and at Greppe Sant’Angelo on the outskirts of Caere proper (see maps 4–6 ).19 T E R R I T O R I A L BO U N D A R I E S\n\nBecause of the geological formation of hills and streams in the south Etruscan landscape and the location of cities and towns in relation to corresponding cemeteries, it is easy to view the rivers and mountain ranges as natural boundaries between the territories of such cities as Tarquinia, Caere, and Veii. Such natural boundaries would define the territory of Caere as the land between the Mignone River to the north,20 Lake Bracciano to the east, the Arrone—or a combination of this river and its tributaries, Fosso Pietroso and Rio Maggiore—to the south, and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west.21 Ongoing endeavors to define the boundaries of the territory are guided by the acknowledgment that some types of artifacts and architectural features such as tombs seem to identify an area or a settlement as culturally or politically dependent on Tarquinia or on Caere.22 The settlements on either side of the Mignone River, for instance, are assigned to Tarquinia or to Caere based on what is perceived as the political status of either city, in particular in relation to their neighbor to the south, Rome.23 Thus a sudden increase in habitations and burials might mark the need for either city to define its borders, or to defend itself with fortified settlements.24 At the same time, specific artistic tradi-\n\nFigure 2.1. Etruscan cities and their territories. After de Grummond and Simon 2006: VII.6, modified by Ingrid Edlund-­Berry and Jessica Trelogan.\n\ntions such as tomb architecture suggest the presence of artisans, probably itinerant, who served communities on either side of the Tolfa Mountains.25 While the historical accounts of the interactions between neighboring Etruscan cities as a rule treat the respective cities and their territories as a unit, it is likely that control over various areas in the countryside shifted with time (fig. 2.1).26 Attempts at reconstructing boundaries, and hence territories, range from the study of the landscape as expressed in scientific/statistical terms to linking the presence of sanctuaries as indicators of boundaries under divine control. Linear Thiessen polygons have been applied to different parts of Etruria to establish modules of size and proportion between small and large communities. For Caere, the method has been used to illustrate the distribution of Bronze Age settlements,27 but has also been combined with a study of natural and religious boundaries to evaluate possible changes in the size of the territory.28 Although the different methods do not change the overall concept of a line of boundaries between Tar-\n\n18\n\nIngrid Edlund-Berry\n\nFigu r e 2.2. Temple at Grasceta dei Cavallari, near Tolfa. Photo: Ingrid Edlund-­Berry.\n\nquinia and Caere and Caere and Veii, the function of Lake Bracciano and its shores as Caere’s boundary to the east remains more difficult to pinpoint.29 The issue of determining Caere’s territory is closely linked to the fact that a line of sanctuaries has been identified toward Tarquinia, running from the coast along the Marangone River and up into the Tolfa Mountains.30 The sites have been excavated and studied extensively, and present a variety of forms and states of preservation, ranging from scattered finds of architectural terracottas to remains of structures, such as those at the site of Grasceta dei Cavallari (fig. 2.2; see fig. 13.5).31 Likewise, the natural boundary to the south has been defined as the river Arrone. This determination is reinforced by the presence of settlements and sacred\n\nspaces along a line from Lake Bracciano to the sea. Here finds at sites such as Tragliatella (see pl. 4)32 and Casali di Torrimpietra33 suggest that the area facing Caere as well as Veii, and later Rome, was a center for both habitation and trade, and therefore in need of divine protection. A G R I C U LT U R E A N D A N I M A L H U S B A N D RY\n\nOverall, Etruria was considered an agricultural resource for the rest of Italy, and the area was known to produce a variety of crops and fruits,34 in addition to its animal husbandry. Although the landscape of Caere and her territory provides an immediate impression of productivity and abundance, there is sparse concrete\n\nTopography and Natural Resources, Agriculture and Economy19\n\nevidence from ancient sources and archaeological remains. Thus Livy states (28.45.13–18) that among a number of Etruscan cities Caere offered grain ( frumentum) and supplies (commeatus) to Rome in 205 BCE as Scipio Africanus prepared the fleet destined to attack Carthage.\n\nCrops As can be expected, remains of agricultural tools are as rare in the territory of Caere as elsewhere. There are, however, examples of nenfro (a variety of tufa) grindstones from the village (pagus) at Piana di Stigliano in the Tolfa Mountains, indicating the onetime presence of a farming community.35 As for actual seed remains, the sanctuary at Sant’Antonio at Caere has yielded samples of grains, beans, grasses, and even grape pips.36 As is well known, wine and olive oil constituted a main component of the ancient Etruscan diet, and Caere has"
