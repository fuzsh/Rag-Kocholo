        "text": "Via Crucis Living in the walls of Casal Velino\n\nVia Crucis living representation in Barile\n\nEvery year in this beautiful country facing the sea of Cilento, and precisely in Casalvelino Capoluogo, in front of the Magna Grecia di Elea, the locals they organize a culto-religious event involving non-professional actors and actors, women and children, young and old men, all disguised in clothes of those times.\n\nEverything takes place in two evenings: with Good Friday where Jesus is tried before the Sanhedrin and after, the representation of the Last Supper with the apostles, prayer in the Garden of Olives, the betrayal of Judas, the capture of Jesus, the denial of Peter; and on the Saturday with the Process of Jesus ahead of Pilate, sentence to death of Jesus, delivery of Jesus to the High Priests, Veronica and Magdalene and then finish the representation with the Crucifixion of Jesus. Two magical evenings realized in the villages and streets of Casal Velino, transformed into a real movie set, with choreography and ideas from ancient times.\n\nIt starts on Good Friday, that is, 29 March at 17:30 and then on Holy Saturday at 17:00, which is essential to all the people who want are invited participate both as actors and spectators.\n\nscritto da David Robertson - ultima modifica il 21/10/2021\n\nExcursion to the Ridge of the Gods: Ancient Elea of Velia\n\nThe Ridge, its name immediately identifies an important part of an elevated and safe path, a hilly ridge of a certain interest, especially when it has been used for centuries by peoples for their travels, trades and why not as then did Domus and Temples for prayers and meditation. An Acropolis built by the Focea colony coming from the coasts of Turkey, extending towards the east, the monumental Porta Rosa, the main entrance of the city and its walls to defend the Site, which rise on the vegetation of the Mediterranean scrub. Built at the end of the 6th century BC before being resumed and strengthened by towers in the Hellenistic age. In fact, in one of the extreme parts stands the Fortilizio di Castelluccio. In the highest areas, a series of terraces, places of worship, for outdoor sanctuaries, called Sacred Terraces (5th century BC). Next to the Acropolis, the Temple of Poseidon Asphaleios used for the cult of gods. A few tens of meters another Hellenistic Temple built between the 3rd century BC and the middle of the second century BC dedicated perhaps to Demeter, the goddess of the fields and harvests or better yet the goddess Mother Earth, but it is said that the cult was for Elea mythological figure. Instead, an imposing square is intended for public meetings, where Cippi dedicated to Zeus (5th century BC) are also found. Then follow the Hellenic Sanctuary Parmenides and Zenon founders of the presocratic philosophical school active in Elea. Archaeological site located in Ascea and Casal Velino, visited every year by thousands of tourists from all over the world, but still today a destination for many scholars and philosophers who come from all over to study the life of Parmenides and Zenon. The remains of Velia are always open to everyone, children do not pay, discounts for students. The best time to visit the site is undoubtedly spring and autumn. You can get there by land by car or even comfortably by train (train station 1 km away).\n\nscritto da Sheila Pickles - ultima modifica il 21/10/2021\n\nMuseo Archeologico Nazionale di Paestum\n\nCapaccio\n\nThe National Archaeological Museum of Paestum is located in the archaeological area of the homonymous city. It contains numerous finds from the city of Heraion and the nearby necropolis of Gaudo and Santa Venera. The structure of the Museum is divided into three floors in turn divided into six sections that chronologically trace the origins of the city and its evolution.\n\nTorre di Paestum\n\nCapaccio\n\nThe tower was built in the 16th century, and is one of the three towers in the Paestum area. It is a symbol of the end of the night attacks of looting groups, in the place. The citizens, now accustomed to such attacks, left access free and united their homes, building farmhouses. In the second half of the XVI, the Spanish took possession of the whole of the South of Italy. They then reinforced the whole place, building a system of towers. The tower is now visible only externally.\n\nRistorante Museo\n\nCapaccio\n\nThe Museum Restaurant is located in the center of the archaeological area of Paestum, namely the old Greek city of Poseidonia. It was opened thirty years ago and has always been run by the same family. Visitors can take a little moment of relaxation after visiting the city, sitting in the indoor room, or in the beautiful garden. In the restaurant you can taste the typical dishes of the area, where the service is excellent. The museum also has a large private and free parking available only for guests.\n\nCastello dell'Abate\n\nCastellabate (20 Km)\n\nBuilt in 1123 to protect the population from Saracen attacks. The fortress has its perimeter walls with four corner towers and inside it has everything it needed to survive in the event of an attack: homes, ovens, cisterns and warehouses. You can also visit the dungeons, which, according to legend, should allow the escape to the sea in case of invasion.\n\nTorre della Pagliarola\n\nCastellabate (19 Km)\n\nNorman-Aragonese tower of the 'Pagliarola' (better known on site as' Perrotti '), which combined with 'Palazzo Perrotti' dominates the Marina Piccola di Santa Maria. The origin was traced back to the Middle Ages, but it was further enhanced in the years 1570-71.\n\nTorre Angioina\n\nCastelcivita (15 Km)\n\nThe Angevin Tower was built around the 13th century by Pandolfo di Fasanella. Primarily, the structure served as a defence. The Tower is located in the highest part of the Municipality, from which it was possible to oversee the whole city.\n\nAntiquarium\n\nAgropoli (12 Km)\n\nThe Municipal Antiquarium of Agropoli was built in 1975 and is located at Palazzo Coppola. The archaeological objects that the museum owns were donated by individuals and by the 'Agropoli Archaeological Group'. The finds belong to a period from the 7th century to the fourth century before Christ.\n\nTorre San Francesco\n\nAgropoli (12 Km)\n\nThe Tower of San Francesco had the function of sighting. It was built near the Franciscan Convent built here in 1230, as this was a strategic position that allowed to communicate in the north with the Castle and with Torre San Marco and to the south with the Tower of Trentova and with that of the tip Tresino.\n\nCastello di Agropoli\n\nAgropoli (11 Km)\n\nThe origins of the castle are very ancient, the first testimonies date back to the Greek-Byzantine period. Its architecture has changed from time to time but what gave the final touch was the restoration of the 15th century, time when it became a military fortress. Then the castle lost this function and became a residence for noble families. There are two characters that are linked to the Luisa Sanfelice castle: the coat of arms of the family that is still on a door of the castle and the French writer Marguerite Yourcenar."
