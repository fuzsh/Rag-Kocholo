It is located in the municipality of Ascea (province of Salerno), and in ancient times it was part of Magna Grecia: it had in fact been realized by the Greeks who took were moved to the coasts of Southern Italy. As a result, it is possible to admire many works that are very closely reminiscent of Greek and classical architecture, which characterize the area. Works that mix with those made instead in Roman times (when the locality changed its name to Velia). This makes the archaeological site unique and interesting. An important heritage of the city for which it is also considered a World Heritage Site, is the Eleatic School. This renowned philosophical school founded by the philosopher Parmenides and his disciple Zenon, promoted the truth of Being. The excavations are open every day, and those who go to Elea Velia can admire the harbor area, the Agora, the Acropoli, the Roman and Hellenistic Baths, the Archaic Quarter and the Roman Quarter. The ticket has a very low price (three euros), and the excavations can be visited from 8.45 am until an hour before sunset (time therefore variable depending on the season): the Entrance at the excavations it is located at the ancient Porta Rosa. In addition to the ticket office, near the excavations there was also a parking lot, which therefore allows tourists and visitors to reach the area by their own means.

An Acropolis built by the Focea colony coming from the coasts of Turkey, extending towards the east, the monumental Porta Rosa, the main entrance of the city and its walls to defend the Site, which rise on the vegetation of the Mediterranean scrub. Built at the end of the 6th century BC before being resumed and strengthened by towers in the Hellenistic age. In fact, in one of the extreme parts stands the Fortilizio di Castelluccio. In the highest areas, a series of terraces, places of worship, for outdoor sanctuaries, called Sacred Terraces (5th century BC). Next to the Acropolis, the Temple of Poseidon Asphaleios used for the cult of gods. A few tens of meters another Hellenistic Temple built between the 3rd century BC and the middle of the second century BC dedicated perhaps to Demeter, the goddess of the fields and harvests or better yet the goddess Mother Earth, but it is said that the cult was for Elea mythological figure. Instead, an imposing square is intended for public meetings, where Cippi dedicated to Zeus (5th century BC) are also found. Then follow the Hellenic Sanctuary Parmenides and Zenon founders of the presocratic philosophical school active in Elea. Archaeological site located in Ascea and Casal Velino, visited every year by thousands of tourists from all over the world, but still today a destination for many scholars and philosophers who come from all over to study the life of Parmenides and Zenon. The remains of Velia are always open to everyone, children do not pay, discounts for students. The best time to visit the site is undoubtedly spring and autumn.
