When the flurry of motion became too much, she looked up ahead and fixed her gaze on a particular tree, following it as it slowly approached, streaked past, and then gradually receded behind her. Was life like that? You could look ahead to the future or back at the past, but the present moved too quickly to absorb. Maybe sometimes. Not today. Today they were driving along an endless two-lane highway through the forested hills of Connecticut. “Why didn’t you tell us Grandpa Sorenson lived in India?” Seth complained. Her brother was eleven and heading into sixth grade. He had grown weary of his handheld video game—evidence that they were on a truly epic drive. Mom twisted to face the backseat. “It won’t be much longer. Enjoy the scenery.” “I’m hungry,” Seth said. Mom started rummaging through a grocery bag full of snack food. “Peanut butter and crackers?”\n\nSeth reached forward for the crackers. Dad, driving, asked for some Almond Roca. Last Christmas he had decided that Almond Roca was his favorite candy and that he should have some on hand all year long. Nearly six months later he was still honoring his resolution. “Do you want anything, Kendra?” “I’m fine.” Kendra returned her attention to the frantic parade of trees. Her parents were leaving on a seventeen-day Scandinavian cruise with all the aunts and uncles on her mother’s side. They were all going for free. Not because they’d won a contest. They were going on a cruise because Kendra’s grandparents had asphyxiated. Grandma and Grandpa Larsen had been visiting relatives in South Carolina. The relatives lived in a trailer. The trailer had some sort of malfunction involving a gas leak, and they all died in their sleep. Long ago, Grandma and Grandpa Larsen had specified that when they died, all their children and their spouses were to use an allocated sum of money to go on a Scandinavian cruise. The grandchildren were not invited. “Won’t you get bored stuck on a boat for seventeen days?” Kendra asked. Dad glanced at her in the rearview mirror. “The food is supposed to be incredible. Snails, fish eggs, the works.” “We’re not all that thrilled about the trip,” Mom said sadly. “I don’t think your grandparents envisioned an accidental death when they made this request. But we’ll make the best of it.” “The ship stops in ports as you go,” Dad said, deliberately redirecting the conversation. “You get to disembark for part of the time.” “Is this car ride going to last seventeen days?” Seth asked. “We’re nearly there,” Dad said. “Do we have to stay with Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson?” asked Kendra. “It’ll be fun,” Dad said. “You should feel honored. They almost never invite anyone to stay with them.” “Exactly. We barely know them. They’re hermits.” “Well, they were my parents,” Dad said. “Somehow I survived.” The road stopped winding through forested hills as it passed through a town. They idled at a stoplight, and Kendra stared at an overweight\n\nwoman gassing up her minivan. The front windshield of the minivan was dirty, but the woman seemed to have no intention of washing it. Kendra glanced up front. The windshield of the SUV was filthy, smeared with dead bugs, even though Dad had squeegeed it when they last stopped to refuel. They had driven all the way from Rochester today. Kendra knew that Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson had not invited them to stay. She had overheard when Mom had approached Grandpa Sorenson about letting the kids stay with him. It was at the funeral. The memory of the funeral made Kendra shiver. There was a wake beforehand, where Grandma and Grandpa Larsen were showcased in matching caskets. Kendra did not like seeing Grandpa Larsen wearing makeup. What lunatic had decided that when people died you should hire a taxidermist to fix them up for one final look? She would much rather remember them alive than on grotesque display in their Sunday best. The Larsens were the grandparents who had been part of her life. They had shared many holidays and long visits. Kendra could hardly remember spending time with Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson. They had inherited some estate in Connecticut around the time her parents were married. The Sorensons had never invited them to visit, and rarely made the trek out to Rochester. When they came, it was generally one or the other. They had only come together twice. The Sorensons were nice, but their visits had been too infrequent and brief for real bonding to occur. Kendra knew that Grandma had taught history at some college, and that Grandpa had traveled a lot, running a small importing business. That was about it. Everyone was surprised when Grandpa Sorenson showed up at the funeral. It had been more than eighteen months since either of the Sorensons had visited. He had apologized that his wife could not attend because she was feeling ill. There always seemed to be an excuse. Sometimes Kendra wondered if they were secretly divorced. Toward the end of the wake, Kendra overheard Mom cajoling Grandpa Sorenson to watch the kids. They were in a hallway around a corner from the viewing area. Kendra heard them talking before she reached the corner, and paused to eavesdrop. “Why can’t they stay with Marci?” “Normally they would, but Marci is coming on the cruise.” Kendra peeked around the corner. Grandpa Sorenson was wearing a brown jacket with patches on the elbows and a bow tie. “Where are Marci’s kids going?”\n\n“To her in-laws.” “What about a baby-sitter?” “Two and a half weeks is a long time for a sitter. I remembered you had mentioned having them over sometime.” “Yes, I recall. Does it have to be late June? Why not July?” “The cruise is on a time frame. What’s the difference?” “Things get extra busy around then. I don’t know, Kate. I’m out of practice with children.” “Stan, I don’t want to go on this cruise. It was important to my parents, so we’re going. I don’t mean to twist your arm.” Mom sounded on the verge of tears. Grandpa Sorenson sighed. “I suppose we could find a place to lock them up.” Kendra moved away from the hall at that point. She had quietly worried about staying with Grandpa Sorenson ever since. Having left the town behind, the SUV climbed a steep grade. Then the road curved around a lake and got lost among low, forested hills. Every so often they passed a mailbox. Sometimes a house was visible through the trees; sometimes there was only a long driveway. They turned onto a narrower road and kept driving. Kendra leaned forward and checked the gas gauge. “Dad, you’re under a quarter of a tank,” she said. “We’re almost there. We’ll fill up after we drop you kids off.” “Can’t we come on the cruise?” Seth asked. “We could hide in the lifeboats. You could sneak us food.” “You kids will have much more fun with Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson,” Mom said. “Just you wait. Give it a chance.” “Here we are,” Dad said. They pulled off the road onto a gravel driveway. Kendra could see no sign of a house, only the driveway angling out of sight into the trees. Tires crunching over the gravel, they passed several signs advertising that they were on private property. Other signs warded off trespassers. They came to a low metal gate that hung open but could be shut to prevent access. “This is the longest driveway in the world!” Seth complained. The farther they advanced, the less conventional the signs became. Private Property and No Trespassing gave way to Beware of .12 Gauge and Trespassers Will Be Persecuted.\n\n“These signs are funny,” Seth said. “More like creepy,” Kendra muttered. Rounding another bend, the driveway reached a tall, wrought-iron fence topped with fleurs-de-lis. The double gate stood open. The fence extended off into the trees as far as Kendra could see in either direction. Near the fence stood a final sign: Certain Death Awaits. “Is Grandpa Sorenson paranoid?” Kendra asked. “The signs are a joke,” Dad said. “He inherited this land. I’m sure the fence came with it.” After they passed through the gate, there was still no house in sight. Just more trees and shrubs. They drove across a small bridge spanning a creek and climbed a shallow slope. There the trees ended abruptly, bringing the house into view across a vast front lawn. The house was big, but not enormous, with lots of gables and even a turret. After the wrought-iron gate, Kendra had expected a castle or a mansion. Constructed out of dark wood and stone, the house looked old but in good repair. The grounds were more impressive. A bright flower garden bloomed in front of the house. Manicured hedges and a fish pond added character to the yard. Behind the house loomed an immense brown barn, at least five stories tall, topped by a weather vane. “I love it,” Mom said. “I wish we were all staying.” “You’ve never been here?” Kendra asked. “No. Your father came here a couple of times before we were married.” “They go the extra mile to discourage visitors,” Dad said. “Me, Uncle Carl, Aunt Sophie—none of us have spent much time here. I don’t get it. You kids are lucky. You’ll have a blast. If nothing else, you can spend your time playing in the pool.” They pulled to a stop outside the garage. The front door opened and Grandpa Sorenson emerged, followed by a tall, lanky man with large ears and a thin, older woman. Mom, Dad, and Seth got out of the car. Kendra sat and watched. Grandpa had been clean-shaven at the funeral, but now he wore a stubbly white beard. He was dressed in faded jeans, work boots, and a flannel shirt. Kendra studied the older woman. She was not Grandma Sorenson. Despite her white hair streaked with a few black strands, her face had an\n\nageless quality. Her almond eyes were black as coffee, and her features suggested a hint of Asian ancestry. Short and slightly stooped, she retained an exotic beauty. Dad and the lanky man opened the back of the SUV and began removing suitcases and duffel bags. “You coming, Kendra?” Dad asked. Kendra opened the door and dropped to the gravel. “Just place the things inside,” Grandpa was telling Dad. “Dale will take them up to the bedroom.” “Where’s Mom?” Dad asked. “Visiting your Aunt Edna.” “In Missouri?” “Edna’s dying.” Kendra had barely ever heard of Aunt Edna, so the news did not mean much. She looked up at the house. She noticed that the windows had bubbly glass. Bird nests clung under the eaves. They all migrated to the front door. Dad and Dale carried the larger bags. Seth held a smaller duffel bag and a cereal box. The cereal box was his emergency kit. It was full of odds and ends he thought would come in handy for an adventure—rubber bands, a compass, granola bars, coins, a squirt gun, a magnifying glass, plastic handcuffs, string, a whistle. “This is Lena, our housekeeper,” Grandpa said. The older woman nodded and gave a little wave. “Dale helps me tend the grounds.” “Aren’t you pretty?” Lena said to Kendra. “You must be around fourteen.” Lena had a faint accent that Kendra could not place. “In October.” An iron knocker hung on the front door, a squinting goblin with a ring in its mouth. The thick door had bulky hinges. Kendra entered the house. Glossy wood floored the entry hall. A wilting arrangement of flowers rested on a low table in a white ceramic vase. A tall, brass coatrack stood off to one side beside a black bench with a high, carved back. On the wall hung a painting of a fox hunt. Kendra could see into another room where a huge, embroidered throw rug covered most of the wooden floor. Like the house itself, the furnishings were antiquated but in good repair. The couches and chairs were mostly of the sort you would expect to see while visiting a historical site. Dale was heading up the stairs with some of the bags. Lena excused herself and went to another room.\n\n“Your home is beautiful,” Mom gushed. “I wish we had time for a tour.” “Maybe when you get back,” Grandpa said. “Thanks for letting the kids stay with you,” Dad said. “Our pleasure. Don’t let me keep you.” “We’re on a pretty tight schedule,” Dad apologized. “You kids be good and do whatever Grandpa Sorenson tells you,” Mom said. She hugged Kendra and Seth. Kendra felt tears seeping into her eyes. She fought them back. “Have a fun cruise.” “We’ll be back before you know it,” Dad said, putting an arm around Kendra and tousling Seth’s hair. Waving, Mom and Dad walked out the door. Kendra went to the doorway and watched them climb into the SUV. Dad honked as they drove off. Kendra fought back tears again as the SUV vanished into the trees. Mom and Dad were probably laughing, relieved to be off by themselves for the longest vacation of their married lives. She could practically hear their crystal goblets clinking. And here she stood, abandoned. Kendra closed the door. Seth, oblivious as ever, was examining the intricate pieces of a decorative chess set. Grandpa stood in the entry hall, watching Seth and looking politely uncomfortable. “Leave the chess pieces alone,” Kendra said. “They look expensive.” “Oh, he’s all right,” Grandpa said. By the way he said it, Kendra could tell he was relieved to see Seth setting the pieces down. “Shall I show you to your room?” They followed Grandpa up the stairs and down a carpeted hall to the foot of a narrow wooden staircase leading up to a white door. Grandpa continued on up the creaking steps. “We don’t often have guests, especially children,” Grandpa said over his shoulder. “I think you’ll be most comfortable in the attic.” He opened the door, and they entered after him. Braced for cobwebs and torture devices, Kendra was relieved to find that the attic was a cheerful playroom. Spacious, clean, and bright, the long room had a pair of beds, shelves crowded with children’s books, freestanding wardrobes,\n\ntidy dressers, a unicorn rocking horse, multiple toy chests, and a hen in a cage. Seth went straight for the chicken. “Cool!” He poked a finger through the slender bars, trying to touch the orange-gold feathers. “Careful, Seth,” Kendra warned. “He’ll be fine,” Grandpa said. “Goldilocks is more a house pet than a barnyard hen. Your grandmother usually takes care of her. I figured you kids wouldn’t mind filling in while she’s gone. You’ll need to feed her, clean her cage, and collect her eggs.” “She lays eggs!” Seth looked astonished and delighted. “An egg or two a day if you keep her well fed,” Grandpa said. He pointed to a white plastic bucket full of kernels near the cage. “A scoop in the morning and another in the evening should take care of her. You’ll want to change the lining of her cage every couple days, and make sure she has plenty of water. Every morning, we give her a tiny bowl of milk.” Grandpa winked. “That’s the secret behind her egg production.” “Can we ever take her out?” The hen had moved close enough for Seth to stroke her feathers with one finger. “Just put her back afterwards.” Grandpa bent down to put a finger in the cage, and Goldilocks instantly pecked at it. Grandpa withdrew his hand. “Never liked me much.” “Some of these toys look expensive,” Kendra said, standing beside an ornate Victorian dollhouse. “Toys are meant to be played with,” Grandpa said. “Do your best to keep them in decent shape, and that will be good enough.” Seth moved from the hen cage to a small piano in the corner of the room. He banged on the keys, and the notes that clanged sounded different from what Kendra would have expected. It was a little harpsichord. “Consider this room your space,” Grandpa said. “Within reason, I’ll not bother you to pick things up in here, so long as you treat the rest of the house with respect.” “Okay,” Kendra said. “I also have some unfortunate news. We are in the height of tick season. You kids ever hear of Lyme disease?” Seth shook his head. “I think so,” Kendra said.\n\n“It was originally discovered in the town of Lyme, Connecticut, not too far from here. You catch it from tick bites. The woods are full of ticks this year.” “What does it do?” Seth asked. Grandpa paused for a solemn moment. “Starts out as a rash. Before long it can lead to arthritis, paralysis, and heart failure. Besides, disease or no, you don’t want ticks burrowing into your skin to drink your blood. You try to pull them off and the head detaches. Hard to get out.” “That’s disgusting!” Kendra exclaimed. Grandpa nodded grimly. “They’re so small you can hardly see them, at least until they fill up on blood. Then they swell to the size of a grape. Anyhow, point is, you kids are not allowed to enter the woods under any circumstances. Stay on the lawn. Break that rule and your outdoor privileges will be revoked. We understand one another?” Kendra and Seth nodded. “You also need to keep out of the barn. Too many ladders and rusty old pieces of farm equipment. Same rules apply to the barn as apply to the woods. Set foot in there, and you will spend the rest of your stay in this room.” “Okay,” Seth said, crossing the room to where a little easel stood on a paint-spattered tarp. A blank canvas rested on the easel. Additional blank canvases leaned against the wall nearby, beside shelves stocked with jars of paint. “Can I paint?” “I’m telling you twice, you have the run of this room,” Grandpa said. “Just try not to destroy it. I have many chores to attend to, so I may not be around much. There should be plenty of toys and hobbies here to keep you busy.” “What about a TV?” Seth asked. “No TV or radio,” Grandpa replied. “Rules of the house. If you need anything, Lena will never be far.” He indicated a purple cord hanging against the wall near one of the beds. “Tug the cord if you need her. In fact, Lena will be up with your supper in a few minutes.” “Won’t we eat together?” Kendra asked. “Some days. Right now I need to visit the east hayfield. May not be back until late.” “How much land do you own?” asked Seth. Grandpa smiled. “More than my share. Let’s leave it at that. I’ll see you kids in the morning.” He turned to leave and then paused, reaching\n\ninto his coat pocket. Turning back, he handed Kendra a tiny key ring holding three miniature keys of varying sizes. “Each of these keys fits something in this room. See if you can figure out what each unlocks.” Grandpa Sorenson walked out of the room, closing the door behind him. Kendra listened as he descended the stairs. She stood at the door, waiting, and then gently tried the handle. It turned slowly. She eased the door open, peered down the empty stairway, and then closed it. At least he had not locked them in. Seth had opened a toy chest and was examining the contents. The toys were old-fashioned but in excellent condition. Soldiers, dolls, puzzles, stuffed animals, wooden blocks. Kendra wandered over to a telescope by a window. She peered into the eyepiece, positioned the telescope to look through a windowpane, and began twisting the focus knobs. She could improve the focus but couldn’t get it quite right. She stopped fiddling with the knobs and examined the window. The panes were made of bubbly glass, like those in the front of the house. The images were being distorted before they reached the telescope. Unfastening a latch, Kendra pushed the window open. She had a good view of the forest east of the house, illuminated by the golden hues of the setting sun. Moving the telescope closer to the window, she spent some time mastering the knobs, bringing the leaves on the trees below into crisp focus. “Let me see,” Seth said. He was standing beside her. “Pick up those toys first.” A mess of toys lay piled near the open chest. “Grandpa said we can do what we want in here.” “Without making it a disaster. You’re already wrecking the place.” “I’m playing. This is a playroom.” “Remember how Mom and Dad said we need to pick up after ourselves?” “Remember how Mom and Dad aren’t here?” “I’ll tell.” “How? Stick a note in a bottle? You won’t even remember by the time they get back.” Kendra noticed a calendar on the wall. “I’ll write it on the calendar.” “Good. And I’ll look through the telescope while you do that.”\n\n“This is the one thing in the room I was doing. Why don’t you find something else?” “I didn’t notice the telescope. Why don’t you share? Don’t Mom and Dad also tell us to share?” “Fine,” Kendra said. “It’s all yours. But I’m closing the window. Bugs are coming in.” “Whatever.” She shut the window. Seth looked into the eyepiece and started twisting the focus knobs. Kendra took a closer look at the calendar. It was from 1953. Each month was accompanied by an illustration of a fairyland palace. She turned the calendar to June. Today was June 11. The days of the week did not match up, but she could still count down to when her parents would return. They would be back June 28. “This stupid thing won’t even focus,” Seth complained. Kendra smiled.\n\nChapter 2\n\nCollecting Clues The next morning, Kendra sat at breakfast across from her grandfather. A wooden clock on the wall above him read 8:43. Reflected sunlight flashed in the corner of her eye. Seth was using his butter knife to bounce sun rays. She was not seated close enough to the window to retaliate. “Nobody likes the sun in their eyes, Seth,” Grandpa said. Seth stopped. “Where’s Dale?” he asked. “Dale and I got up a few hours ago. He’s out working. I’m just here to keep you company on your first morning.” Lena set a bowl in front of Seth and another in front of Kendra. “What’s this?” Seth asked. “Cream of wheat,” Lena replied. “Sticks to your ribs,” Grandpa added. Seth probed the cream of wheat with his spoon. “What’s in it? Blood?” “Berries from the garden and homemade raspberry preserves,” Lena said, placing a platter on the table containing toast, butter, a pitcher of milk, a bowl of sugar, and a bowl of jam.\n\nKendra sampled the cream of wheat. It was delicious. The berries and raspberry preserves sweetened it to perfection. “This is good!” Seth said. “Just think, Dad is eating snails.” “You kids remember the rules about the woods,” Grandpa said. “And to stay out of the barn,” Kendra said. “Good girl. There’s a swimming pool out back that we got ready for you—all the chemicals are balanced and whatnot. There are gardens to explore. You can always play in your room. Just respect the rules and we’ll get along fine.” “When is Grandma coming back?” Kendra asked. Grandpa glanced down at his hands. “That depends on your Aunt Edna. Could be next week. Could be a couple months.” “Good thing Grandma got over her illness,” Kendra said. “Illness?” “The one that kept her from going to the funeral.” “Right. Yeah, she was still a little under the weather when she left for Missouri.” Grandpa was acting a little peculiar. Kendra wondered if he was uncomfortable around children. “I’m sad we missed her,” Kendra said. “She’s sorry too. Well, I better be off.” Grandpa had not eaten anything. He pushed his chair back, stood up, and stepped away from the table, rubbing his palms against his jeans. “If you swim, don’t forget to wear sunblock. I’ll see you kids later.” “At lunch?” Seth asked. “Probably not until supper. Lena will help you with anything you need.” He left the room. *** Dressed in her swimsuit, a towel over one shoulder, Kendra stepped through the door onto the back porch. She carried a handheld mirror she had found in the nightstand by her bed. The handle was mother-of-pearl studded with rhinestones. The day was a bit humid, but the temperature was pleasant. She walked to the railing of the porch and gazed over the gorgeously manicured backyard. Paths of white stones meandered among flower\n\nbeds, hedgerows, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, and flowering plants. Tangled grapevines curled along suspended lattices. All the flowers seemed to be in full bloom. Kendra had never seen such brilliant blossoms. Seth was already swimming. The pool had a black bottom, and it was fringed with rocks to make it seem like a pond. Kendra hurried down the steps and started down a path toward the pool. The garden teemed with life. Hummingbirds darted among the foliage, wings nearly invisible as they hovered. Huge bumblebees with fuzzy abdomens buzzed from one blossom to another. A stunning variety of butterflies fluttered about on tissue-paper wings. Kendra passed a small, waterless fountain featuring a statue of a frog. She paused as a large butterfly alighted on the rim of an empty birdbath. It had huge wings—blue, black, and violet. She had never seen a butterfly with such vivid coloring. Of course, she had never visited a world-class garden. The house was not quite a mansion, but the grounds were fit for a king. No wonder Grandpa Sorenson had so many chores. The path finally deposited Kendra at the pool. Variegated flagstones paved the poolside area. There were a few recliners and a circular table with a big umbrella. Seth leaped from a stone outcropping into the swimming pool, legs curled up, and hit the water with a big splash. Kendra set her towel and mirror on the table and grabbed a bottle of sunblock. She smeared the white cream over her face, arms, and legs until it disappeared into her skin. While Seth was swimming underwater, Kendra picked up the mirror. She angled the face so it reflected sunlight onto the water. When Seth surfaced, she made sure the bright splotch of sunlight covered his face. “Hey!” he shouted, swimming away from her. She kept the glare from the mirror on the back of his head. Gripping the side of the pool, Seth turned to look at her again, throwing up a hand and squinting to ward off the light. He had to look away. Kendra laughed. “Cut it out,” Seth called. “You don’t like that?” “Quit it. I won’t do it anymore. Grandpa already yelled at me.” Kendra set the mirror on the table. “That mirror is a lot brighter than a butter knife,” she said. “I bet it already did permanent damage to your\n\nretinas.” “I hope so, then I’ll sue you for a billion dollars.” “Good luck. I have about a hundred in the bank. It might be enough for you to buy some eye patches.” He swam toward her angrily, and Kendra walked forward to the edge of the pool. As he started climbing out, she shoved him back in. She was almost a full head taller than Seth and could usually handle him in a fight, although if they ended up wrestling he was pretty squirmy. Seth changed tactics and started splashing her, making quick scooping motions across the surface of the pool. The water felt cold, and Kendra recoiled at first, then leapt over Seth into the water. After the initial shock, she swiftly grew accustomed to the temperature, stroking over to the shallow end away from her brother. He chased her, and they ended up in a splash fight. Locking his hands, Seth swung his arms in wide arcs, skimming the top of the water. Kendra pushed at the water with both hands, a churning motion that generated smaller but more focused splashes. Soon they grew tired. It was hard to win a water fight when both participants were already soaked. “Let’s have a race,” Kendra suggested as the splashing subsided. They raced back and forth across the pool. First they raced freestyle, then backstroke, breaststroke, and sidestroke. After that they created handicaps, like racing with no arms or hopping across the width of the shallow end on one foot. Kendra usually won, but Seth was faster at backstroke and some of the handicapped races. When Kendra grew bored, she got out of the pool. Walking toward the table to retrieve her towel, she stroked her long hair, enjoying the rubbery texture as the wetness made the strands cling together. Seth climbed on top of a big rock near the deep end. “Watch this can opener!” He jumped with one leg straight and the other bent. “Good job,” Kendra said to placate him when he surfaced. Shifting her gaze to the table, Kendra froze. Hummingbirds, bumblebees, and butterflies swirled in the air above the handheld mirror. Several other butterflies and a couple of large dragonflies actually rested on the face of the mirror itself. “Seth, come look at this!” Kendra hissed in a loud whisper. “What?” “Just come here.”\n\nSeth boosted himself out of the pool and padded over to Kendra, arms folded. He stared at the cloud of life whirling above the mirror. “What’s their deal?” “I don’t know,” she replied. “Do insects like mirrors?” “These ones do.” “Look at the red and white butterfly. It’s enormous.” “Same with that dragonfly,” Seth pointed out. “I wish I had a camera. I dare you to go get the mirror.” Seth shrugged. “Sure.” He trotted over to the table, grabbed the mirror by the handle, dashed to the pool, and dove in. Some of the insects scattered instantly. The majority drifted in the direction Seth had gone but dispersed before reaching the pool. Seth surfaced. “Any bees after me?” “Get the mirror out of the water. You’ll ruin it!” “Settle down, it’s fine,” he said, stroking over to the side. “Give it to me.” She took the mirror from him and wiped it dry with her towel. It looked undamaged. “Let’s try an experiment.” Kendra placed the mirror face up on a lounge chair and backed away. “Think they’ll come back?” “We’ll see.” Kendra and Seth sat down at the table, not far from the lounge chair. After less than a minute, a hummingbird glided over to the mirror and hovered above it. Soon it was joined by a few butterflies. A bumblebee alighted on the face. Before long another swarm of small winged creatures crowded the mirror. “Go turn the mirror face down,” Kendra said. “I want to see whether they like the reflection or the mirror itself.” Seth crept toward the mirror. The little animals took no apparent notice of his approach. He reached forward slowly, flipped the mirror over, and then retreated to the table. The butterflies and bees that had landed on the mirror took flight when it was overturned, but only a few of the winged creatures flew away. Most of the swarm lingered. A pair of butterflies and a dragonfly landed on the lounge chair at the edge of the mirror. Taking flight, they flipped the mirror over, nearly sliding it off the chair in the process. With the reflective surface showing again, the swarm pressed close. Several of the creatures landed on the face.\n\n“Did you see that?” Kendra asked. “That was weird,” Seth said. “How could they be strong enough to lift it?” “There were a few of them. Want me to flip it again?” “No, I’m scared the mirror will fall off and break.” “Okay.” He draped his towel over his shoulder. “I’m going to go change.” “Would you take the mirror?” “Fine, but I’m running. I don’t want to get stung.” Seth moved toward the mirror slowly, snatched it, and ran off into the garden toward the house. Part of the swarm gave lazy pursuit before scattering. Kendra wrapped the towel around her waist, picked up the sunblock Seth had left behind, and started toward the house. When Kendra reached the attic playroom, Seth was dressed in jeans and a long-sleeved camouflage shirt. He picked up the cereal box that served as his emergency survival kit and headed for the door. “Where are you going?” “None of your business, unless you want to come.” “How will I know whether I want to come if you don’t tell me where you’re going?” Seth gave her a measuring stare. “Promise to keep it a secret?” “Let me guess. Into the woods.” “Want to come?” “You’ll get Lyme disease,” Kendra warned. “Whatever. Ticks are everywhere. Same with poison ivy. If people let that stop them, nobody would ever go anywhere.” “But Grandpa Sorenson doesn’t want us in the woods,” she protested. “Grandpa isn’t going to be around all day. Nobody will know unless you blab.” “Don’t do this. Grandpa has been nice to us. We should obey him.” “You’re about as brave as a bucket of sand.” “What’s so brave about disobeying Grandpa?” “So you’re not coming?” Kendra hesitated. “No.”\n\n“Will you tell on me?” “If they ask where you are.” “I won’t be long.” Seth walked out the door. She heard him tromp down the stairs. Kendra crossed to the nightstand. The handheld mirror rested on it beside the ring with the three tiny keys. She had spent a long time the night before trying to find what the keys fit. The biggest key opened a jewelry box on the dresser that was full of costume jewelry—fake diamond necklaces, pearl earrings, emerald pendants, sapphire rings, and ruby bracelets. She had not yet discovered what the other two opened. She picked up the keys. They were all small. The smallest was no longer than a thumbtack. Where could she find such a miniscule keyhole? The night before, she had spent most of her time on drawers and toy chests. Some of the drawers had keyholes, but they were already unlocked, and the keys did not fit. Same with the toy chests. The Victorian dollhouse caught her attention. What better place to find tiny keyholes than inside a little house? She unlatched the clasps and opened it, revealing two floors and several rooms full of miniature furniture. Five doll people lived in the house—a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, and a baby. The detail was extraordinary. The beds had quilts, blankets, sheets, and pillows. The couches had removable cushions. The knobs in the bathtub really turned. Closets had clothes hanging inside. The armoire in the dollhouse’s master bedroom made Kendra suspicious. It had a disproportionately large keyhole in the center. Kendra inserted the tiniest key and turned it. The doors of the armoire sprung open. Inside was something wrapped in gold foil—opening it, she saw it was a piece of chocolate shaped like a rosebud. Behind the chocolate she found a small golden key. She added it to the key ring. The golden key was larger than the key that opened the armoire, but smaller than the key that opened the jewelry box. Kendra took a bite of the chocolate rosebud. It was soft and melted in her mouth. It was the richest, creamiest chocolate she had ever tasted. She finished it in three more bites, savoring each mouthful. Kendra continued scouring the tiny house, investigating every piece of furniture, searching every closet, checking behind every miniature\n\npainting on the walls. Finding no more keyholes, she closed the dollhouse and fastened the clasps. Scanning the room, Kendra tried to decide where to look next. One key left, maybe two if the golden key also opened something. She had been through most of the items in the toy chests, but she could always double-check. She had searched through the drawers in the nightstands, dressers, and wardrobes thoroughly, as well as the knickknacks on the bookshelves. There could be keyholes in unlikely places, like under the clothes of a doll or behind a bedpost. Kendra ended up beside the telescope. Improbable as it seemed, she checked it for keyholes. Nothing. Maybe she could use the telescope to locate Seth. Opening the window, she noticed Dale walking along the lawn at the outskirts of the woods. He was carrying something in both hands, but his back was to her, impeding a view of what he held. He stooped and set it down behind a low hedge, which continued to prevent her from seeing the object. Dale walked off at a brisk pace, glancing around as if to ensure nobody was spying, and soon passed out of view. Curious, Kendra rushed downstairs and out the back door. Dale was nowhere in sight. She trotted across the lawn to the low hedge beneath the attic window. Grass continued for about six feet beyond the hedge before stopping abruptly at the perimeter of the forest. On the grass behind the hedge rested a large pie tin full of milk. An iridescent hummingbird hung suspended over the pie tin, wings a faint blur. Several butterflies flitted around the hummingbird. Occasionally one would descend and splash in the milk. The hummingbird flew away, and a dragonfly approached. It was a smaller crowd than the mirror had attracted, but there was much more activity than Kendra would have expected around a small pool of milk. She watched as a variety of tiny winged animals came and went, feeding from the pie tin. Did butterflies drink milk? Did dragonflies? Apparently so. It was not long before the level of milk in the pie tin had markedly fallen. Kendra looked up at the attic. It had only two windows, both facing the same side of the house. She visualized the room behind those gabled windows and suddenly realized that the playroom consumed only half the space the attic should fill. Abandoning the tin of milk, she walked around to the opposite side of the house. On the far side was a second pair of attic windows. She was\n\nright. There was another half to the attic. But she knew of no other stairway granting access to the uppermost story. Which meant there might be some sort of secret passage in the playroom! Maybe the final key unlocked it! Just as she decided to return to the attic and search for a hidden door, Kendra noticed Dale coming from the direction of the barn with another pie tin. She hurried toward him. When he saw her coming, he looked temporarily uncomfortable, then put on a big smile. “What are you doing?” Kendra asked. “Just taking some milk to the house,” he replied, changing direction a bit. He had been heading toward the woods. “Really? Why’d you leave that other milk behind the hedge?” “Other milk?” He could not have looked more guilty. “Yeah. The butterflies were drinking it.” Dale was no longer walking. He regarded Kendra shrewdly. “Can you keep a secret?” “Sure.” Dale looked around as if someone might be watching. “We have a few milking cows. They make plenty of milk, so I put out some of the excess for the insects. Keeps the garden lively.” “Why’s that a secret?” “I’m not sure your grandfather would approve. Never asked permission. He might consider it wasteful.” “Seems like a good idea to me. I noticed all the different kinds of butterflies in your garden. More than I’ve ever seen. Plus all the hummingbirds.” He nodded. “I like it. Adds to the atmosphere.” “So you weren’t taking that milk to the house.” “No, no. This milk hasn’t been pasteurized. Full of bacteria. You could catch all sorts of diseases. Not fit for people. Insects, on the other hand, they seem to like it best this way. You won’t spoil my secret?” “I’ll keep quiet.” “Good girl,” he said with a conspiratorial wink. “Where are you putting that one?” “Over there.” He jerked his head toward the woods. “I set a few on the border of the yard every day.” “Does it spoil?”\n\n“I don’t leave it out long enough. Some days the insects consume all the milk before I collect the pans. Thirsty critters.” “See you later, Dale.” “You seen your brother hereabout?” “I think he’s in the house.” “That so?” She shrugged. “Maybe.” Kendra turned and started toward the house. She glanced back as she mounted the stairs to the rear porch. Dale was placing the milk behind a small, round bush.\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Ivy Shack Seth pressed through dense undergrowth until he reached a faint, crooked path, the kind made by animals. Nearby stood a squat, gnarled tree with thorny leaves and black bark. Seth examined his sleeves for ticks, scrutinizing the camouflage pattern. So far he had not seen a single tick. Of course, it would probably be the ticks he failed to see that would get him. He hoped the insect repellent he had sprayed on was helping. Stooping, he collected rocks and built a small pyramid to mark the point where he had intersected the path. Finding his way back would probably be no problem, but better safe than sorry. If he took too long, Grandpa might figure out he had disobeyed orders. Rummaging in his cereal box, Seth withdrew a compass. The animal track ran northeast. He had set off on an easterly course, but the undergrowth had grown denser as he progressed. A faint trail was a good excuse to veer slightly off course. It would be much easier going than trying to hack his way through shrubbery with a pocketknife. He wished he owned a machete. Seth followed the trail. The tall trees stood fairly close together, diffusing the sunlight into a greenish glow laced with shadows. Seth imagined that the forest would be black as a cave after nightfall.\n\nSomething rustled in the bushes. He paused, removing a small pair of plastic binoculars from his cereal box. Scanning the area, he spotted nothing of interest. He proceeded along the trail until an animal emerged from the undergrowth onto the path not twenty feet ahead. It was a round, bristly creature no taller than his knees. A porcupine. The animal started down the path in his direction with complete confidence. Seth froze. The porcupine was close enough that he could discern the individual quills, slender and sharp. As the animal trundled toward him, Seth backed away. Weren’t animals supposed to flee from humans? Maybe it had rabies. Or maybe it just hadn’t seen him. After all, he was wearing a camouflage shirt. Seth spread his arms wide, stomped a foot, and growled. The porcupine looked up, twitched its nose, and then turned from the path. Seth listened as it pushed through foliage away from the trail. He took a deep breath. He had been really scared for a minute there. He could almost feel the quills pricking through his jeans into his leg. It would be pretty hard to conceal his excursion into the woods if he came home looking like a pincushion. Though he dreaded admitting it, he wished Kendra had come. The porcupine probably would have made her scream, and her fear would have increased his bravery. He could have made fun of her instead of feeling frightened himself. He had never seen a porcupine in the wild before. He was surprised how exposed he felt staring at all those pointy quills. What if he stepped on one in the undergrowth? He looked around. He had come a long way. Of course, finding his way back would be no trick. He just needed to backtrack along the trail and then head west. But if he turned for home now, he might never make it back this way again. Seth continued along the trail. Some of the trees had moss and lichen growing on them. A few had ivy twisting around their bases. The path forked. Checking his compass, Seth saw that one path went northwest, the other due east. Staying with his theme, Seth turned east. There began to be more space between the trees, and the shrubs grew closer to the ground. Soon he could see much farther in all directions, and the forest became a little brighter. To one side of the path, at the limit of his sight, he noticed something abnormal. It looked like a large square of ivy hidden among the trees. The whole point of exploring\n\nthe woods was to find strange things, so he left the path and walked toward the ivy square. The dense undergrowth came up to his shins, grasping at his ankles with every step. As he tromped toward the square, he realized it was a structure completely overgrown with ivy. It appeared to be a big shed. He stopped and looked more closely. The ivy was thick enough that he could not tell what the shed was made of—he could see only leafy vines. He walked around the structure. On the far side a door stood open. Seth almost cried out when he peered inside. The shed was actually a shack constructed around a large tree stump. Beside the stump, dressed in crude rags, sat a wiry old woman gnawing at a knot in a bristly rope. Shriveled with age, she clutched the rope in bony hands with knobby knuckles. Her long, white hair was matted and had a sickly yellowish tint. One of her filmy eyes was terribly bloodshot. She was missing teeth, and there was blood on the knot she was chewing, apparently from her gums. Her pale arms, bare almost to the shoulder, were thin and wrinkled, with faint blue veins and a few purple scabs. When the woman saw Seth, she dropped the rope immediately, wiping pink saliva from the corners of her meager lips. Supporting herself against the stump, she stood up. He noticed her long feet, the color of ivory, peppered with insect bites. Her gray toenails looked thick with fungus. “Hail, young master, what brings you to my home?” Her voice was incongruently melodious and smooth. For a moment, Seth could only stare. Even as bent and crooked as she was, the woman was tall. She smelled bad. “You live out here?” he finally said. “I do. Care to come inside?” “Probably not. I’m just out for a walk.” The woman narrowed her eyes. “Strange place for a boy to walk alone.” “I like exploring. My grandpa owns this land.” “Owns it, you say?” “Does he know you’re here?” asked Seth. “Depends who he is.” “Stan Sorenson.” She grinned. “He knows.”\n\nThe rope she had chewed lay on the dirt floor. It had one other knot besides the one she had been gnawing. “Why were you biting the rope?” Seth asked. She eyed him suspiciously. “I don’t care for knots.” “Are you a hermit?” “You could say that. Come inside and I will brew some tea.” “I better not.” She looked down at her hands. “I must look frightful. Let me show you something.” She turned and crouched behind the stump. A rat ventured a few steps out of a hole in a corner of the shack. When she came back from behind the stump, the rat hid. The old woman sat with her back to the stump. She held a little wooden puppet about nine inches high. It looked primitive, made entirely of dark wood, with no clothes or painted features. Just a basic human figure with tiny gold hooks serving as joints. The puppet had a stick in its back. The woman set a paddle on her lap. She began making the puppet dance by bobbing the stick and tapping the paddle. There was a musical regularity to the rhythm. “What is that thing?” Seth asked. “A limberjack,” she replied. “Where’s his ax?” “Not a lumberjack, a limberjack. A clog doll. A jigger. Dancing Dan. Shuffling Sam. I call him Mendigo. He keeps me company. Come inside and I’ll let you give it a try.” “I better not,” he said again. “I don’t see how you could live out here like this and not be crazy.” “Sometimes good people grow weary of society.” She sounded a little annoyed. “You happened upon me by accident? Out exploring?” “Actually, I’m selling candy bars for my soccer team. It’s a good cause.” She stared at him. “I have my best luck in the rich neighborhoods.” She kept staring. “That was a joke. I’m kidding.” Her voice became stern. “You are an impudent young man.” “And you live with a tree stump.”\n\nShe gave him a measuring glare. “Very well, my arrogant young adventurer. Why not test your courage? Every explorer deserves a chance to prove his mettle.” The old woman withdrew into the shack and crouched behind the stump again. She returned to the doorway holding a crude, narrow box made of splintered wood, wire, and long, jutting nails. “What’s that?” “Place your hand inside the box to prove your valor and earn a reward.” “I’d rather play with the creepy puppet.” “Just reach inside and touch the back of the box.” She shook it, and it rattled a bit. The box was long enough that he would have to reach in to his elbow in order to touch the back. “Are you a witch?” “A man with a brave tongue should support his words with courageous actions.” “This seems like something a witch would do.” “Stand by your loose words, young man, or you may not have a pleasant journey home.” Seth backed away, watching her closely. “I better get going. Have fun eating your rope.” She clucked her tongue. “Such insolence.” Her voice remained soothing and calm, but now held a menacing undertone. “Why not step inside and have some tea?” “Next time.” Seth moved around the shack, not taking his eyes from the ragged woman in the doorway. She made no move to pursue him. Before he moved out of her sight, the woman raised an arthritic hand with the middle fingers crossed and the others bent awkwardly. Eyes half-shut, she appeared to be murmuring something. Then she was out of view. On the far side of the shack, Seth plunged through the tangled undergrowth back to the path, glancing over his shoulder all the way. The woman was not chasing him. Just looking back at the ivy-covered shack made him shiver. The old hag looked so wretched and smelled so foul. There was no way he was sticking his hand in her weird box. After she had offered the challenge, all he could think about was learning in school how shark teeth angled inward so fish could swim in but not out. He imagined the homemade box was probably full of nails or broken glass set at cruel angles for a similar purpose.\n\nEven though the woman was not following him, Seth felt unsafe. Compass in hand, he hurried along the path toward home. Without warning, something struck him on the ear, barely hard enough to sting. A pebble the size of a thimble dropped to the path at his feet. Seth whirled. Somebody had thrown the little stone at him, but he saw nobody. Could the old woman be stealthily following him? She probably knew the woods really well. Another small object bounced off the back of his neck. It was not as hard or heavy as a stone. Turning, he saw another acorn whistling toward him, and he ducked. The acorns and the pebble had come at him from opposite sides of the path. What was going on? From above came the sound of wood splitting, and a huge limb fell across the path behind him, a few leaves and twigs swishing against him as it passed. If Seth had been standing two or three yards back along the path, a branch thicker than his leg would have clubbed him on the head. One look at the heavy limb, and Seth took off down the path at a full sprint. He seemed to hear rustling sounds coming from the shrubbery on either side of the scant trail, but did not slow down to investigate. Something caught a firm hold on his ankle, sending him tumbling to the ground. Sprawled on his belly, a cut on one hand, dirt in his mouth, he heard something rustling through the foliage behind him, and a strange sound that was either laughter or running water. A dry branch snapped like a gunshot. Not looking back for fear of what he might see, Seth scrambled to his feet and dashed along the path. Whatever had tripped him had not been a root or a stone. It had felt like a strong cord stretched across the trail. A tripwire. He had noticed no such trap previously on the path. But there was no way the old woman could have done it, even if she had started running the moment he passed out of her view. Seth raced past the place where the trail forked and sprinted back the way he had come. He scanned the trail ahead for wires or other traps. His breathing became labored, but he did not slow down. The air felt hotter and more humid than it had all day. Sweat began to dampen his forehead and drip down the sides of his face. Seth remained alert for the little pyramid of rocks that would mark where he should leave the path. When he reached a gnarled little tree with black bark and thorny leaves, he halted. He remembered the tree. He had noticed it when he intersected the path. Using the tree as a\n\nreference, he found the spot where he had built the pyramid of rocks, but the rocks were gone. Leaves crunched behind him off to one side of the trail. Seth glanced at his compass to confirm that he was heading west and ran into the woods. He had walked this way at a leisurely pace, examining toadstools and unusual rocks as he went. Now he tore through the forest at full speed, undergrowth clawing at his legs, branches whipping against his face and chest. Finally, panting, the energy of his panic wearing thin, he glimpsed the house up ahead through the trees. The sounds of pursuit had dwindled to nothing. As he stepped out into the yard under the sun, Seth wondered how much of what he had heard had actually been something chasing him, and how much had been invented by his flustered imagination. *** The wall opposite the windows in the playroom held several rows of bookshelves. The door to the stairs was built into that wall. And one of the bulky, freestanding wardrobes was backed up against it. Kendra held a blue book with golden letters. The title was Journal of Secrets. The book was held shut by three sturdy clasps, each with a keyhole. The remaining key Grandpa Sorenson had given her fit none of the keyholes, but the gold key she had found in the dollhouse armoire fit the bottom one. So one of the clasps was unlocked. She had found the book while searching the bookshelves for a trigger to a secret passage. Using a stool, Kendra had reached even the higher shelves, but so far the search had been in vain. There was no sign of a secret door. When she noticed a locked book with an intriguing title, she had quit the search in order to test her keys. With the bottom clasp unlocked, Kendra tried to pry up the corner of the book and get a peek. But the cover was solid and the binding firm. She needed to find the other keys. She heard somebody stampeding up the stairs and knew it could be only one person. Hurriedly she shelved the book and pocketed the keys. She did not want her nosy brother interfering with her puzzle. Seth charged through the door and slammed it behind him. He was flushed and breathing hard. Dirt smeared the knees of his jeans. His face\n\nwas smudged with sweat and grime. “You should have come,” he sighed, flopping onto his bed. “You’re getting the bedspread filthy.” “It was freaky,” he said. “It was so cool.” “What happened?” “I found this path in the woods and met this weird old lady who lived in a shack. I think she’s a witch. A real one.” “Whatever.” He rolled over and looked at her. “I’m serious. You should have seen her. She was a mess.” “So are you.” “No, like all scabby and gross. She was biting an old rope. She tried to make me stick my hand in some box.” “Did you?” “No way. I took off. But she chased me or something. She threw rocks at me and knocked down this big branch. It could have killed me!” “You must be pretty bored.” “I’m not lying!” “I’ll ask Grandpa Sorenson if he has homeless people living in his woods,” Kendra said. “No! He’ll know I broke the rules.” “Don’t you think he would want to know a witch built a shack on his property?” “She acted like she knew him. I went pretty far. Maybe I was off his property.” “I doubt it. I think he owns everything for a long ways.” Seth leaned back, lacing his fingers behind his head. “You should come visit her with me. I could find my way back.” “Are you nuts? You said she tried to kill you.” “We should spy on her. Find out what she’s up to.” “If there really is a weird old lady living in the woods, you should tell Grandpa so he can call the police.” Seth sat up. “Okay. Never mind. I made it up. Feel better?” Kendra narrowed her eyes. “I found something else cool,” Seth said. “Have you seen the tree house?” “No.”\n\n“Want me to show you?” “Is it in the yard?” “Yes, on the edge.” “Okay.” Kendra followed Seth outside and across the lawn. Sure enough, in the corner of the yard opposite the barn, there was a light blue playhouse up in a thick tree. It was situated on the back side of the tree, making it hard to see from most of the yard. The paint was peeling a little, but the little house had shingles on the roof and curtains in the window. Boards had been nailed into the tree to form a ladder. Seth went up first. The rungs led up to a trapdoor, which he pushed open. Kendra climbed up after him. Inside, the tree house felt bigger than it looked from the ground. There was a little table with four chairs. The pieces to a jigsaw puzzle were spread out on the table. Only a couple had been fit together. “See, not bad,” Seth said. “I started that puzzle.” “It’s beautiful. You must be gifted.” “I didn’t work on it long.” “Did you even find the corners?” “No.” “That’s the first thing you do.” She sat down and started looking for corner pieces. Seth took a seat and helped. “You never like puzzles,” Kendra said. “It’s more fun doing them in a tree house.” “If you say so.” Seth found a corner piece and set it aside. “Think Grandpa would let me move in here?” “You’re a weirdo.” “I’d only need a sleeping bag,” he said. “You’d get freaked out once it was late.” “No way.” “The witch might come get you.” Instead of responding, he started looking more intently for the other corner pieces. Kendra could tell the comment had gotten to him. She decided not to tease him any further. The fact that he seemed scared of the lady he had met in the woods legitimized his story a lot. Seth had never scared easily. This was the kid who had jumped off the roof under\n\nthe misguided assumption that a garbage bag would work like a parachute. The kid who had put the head of a live snake in his mouth on a dare. They found the corners and finished most of the perimeter of the puzzle by the time they heard Lena calling them for dinner.\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Hidden Pond Rain pattered endlessly against the roof. Kendra had never heard such a noisy downpour. Then again, she had never been in an attic during a rainstorm. There was something relaxing about the steady drumming, so constant that it almost became inaudible without ever decreasing in volume. Standing at the window beside the telescope, she watched the deluge. The rain fell straight and hard. There was no wind, just layer upon layer of streaking droplets, blurring into a gray haze in the distance. The gutter below her was about to overflow. Seth sat on a stool in the corner, painting. Lena had been creating paint-by-numbers canvases for him, sketching them with expert speed, customizing each image to his specifications. The current project was a dragon battling a knight on horseback amid a fuming wasteland. Lena had outlined the images in considerable detail, including subtleties of light and shade, so that the finished products looked quite accomplished. She had taught Seth how to mix paint and given him samples of which hue corresponded to each number. For the current painting, she had incorporated more than ninety different shades.\n\nKendra had rarely seen Seth demonstrate as much diligence as he did on the paintings. After a few brief lessons on how to apply the paint, including the purposes of different brushes and tools, he had already finished a large canvas of pirates sacking a town and a smaller one of a snake charmer diving away from a striking cobra. Two impressive paintings in three days. He was an addict! And he was almost done with his latest project. Crossing to the bookshelf, Kendra ran a hand along the spines of the volumes. She had searched the room thoroughly and had yet to find the last keyhole, let alone a secret passage to the other side of the attic. Seth could be a pest, but now that he had become immersed in his painting, she was starting to miss him. Maybe Lena would outline a painting for her. Kendra had turned down her initial offer, since it sounded childish, like coloring. But the finished products looked much less juvenile than Kendra had anticipated. Kendra opened the door and descended the stairs. The house was dim and quiet, the rainfall more distant as she left the attic behind. She walked along the hall and down the stairs to the main floor. The house seemed too quiet. All the lights were out despite the gloom. “Lena?” There was no answer. Kendra went through the living room, the dining room, and into the kitchen. No sign of the housekeeper. Had she left? Opening the door to the basement, Kendra peered down the steps into the darkness. The stairs were made of stone, as if leading to a dungeon. “Lena?” she called uncertainly. Surely the woman wasn’t down there without any light. Kendra went back down the hall and slid open the door to the study. Having not yet entered this particular room, she first noticed the huge desk cluttered with books and papers. The massive head of a hairy boar with jutting tusks hung mounted on the wall. A collection of grotesque wooden masks rested on a shelf. Golfing trophies lined another. Plaques decorated the wood-paneled walls, along with a framed display of military medals and ribbons. There was a black-and-white picture of a much younger Grandpa Sorenson showing off an enormous marlin. On the desk, inside a crystal sphere with a flat bottom, was an eerie replica of a human skull no bigger than her thumb. Kendra slid the study door closed.\n\nShe tried the garage, the parlor, and the family room. Maybe Lena had run to the store. Kendra walked out to the back porch, shielded from the rain by the overhang. She loved the fresh, damp scent of rainfall. It continued to come down hard, puddling around the garden. Where did the butterflies hide from such a downpour? Then she saw Lena. The housekeeper knelt in the mud beside a bush blossoming with large blue and white roses, absolutely soaked, apparently weeding. Her white hair was plastered to her head, and her housecoat was drenched. “Lena?” The housekeeper looked up, smiled, and waved. Kendra retrieved an umbrella from the hall closet and joined Lena in the garden. “You’re sopping,” Kendra said. Lena rooted out a weed. “It’s a warm rain. I like being out in the weather.” She stuffed the weed into a bulging garbage bag. “You’re going to catch a cold.” “I don’t often take ill.” She paused to stare up at the clouds. “It won’t last much longer.” Kendra tilted her umbrella back and gazed heavenward. Leaden skies in all directions. “You think?” “Wait and see. The rain will pass within the hour.” “Your knees are all muddy.” “You think I’ve lost my marbles.” The diminutive woman stood up and spread her arms wide, tilting her head back. “Do you ever look up at the rain, Kendra? It feels like the sky is falling.” Kendra tilted the umbrella back again. Millions of raindrops rushed toward her, some pelting her face and making her blink. “Or like you’re soaring up to the clouds,” she said. “I suppose I should get you inside before my unusual habits rub off.” “No, I didn’t mean to disturb you.” Back under the protection of the umbrella, Kendra wiped droplets from her forehead. “I guess you don’t want the umbrella.” “That would defeat the purpose. I’ll be in shortly.” Kendra returned to the house. She stole glances at Lena through a window. It was just so peculiar, she couldn’t resist spying. Sometimes\n\nLena was working. Sometimes she was smelling a blossom or stroking its petals. And the rain kept falling. *** Kendra was sitting on her bed, reading poems by Shel Silverstein, when the room suddenly brightened. The sun was out. Lena had been right about the rain. It had relented about forty minutes after her prediction. The housekeeper had come inside, changed out of her wet clothes, and made sandwiches. Across the room, the painting of the knight charging the dragon was complete. Seth had gone outside an hour ago. Kendra was in a lazy mood. Just as Kendra returned her attention to the latest poem, Seth burst into the room, breathing hard. He wore only socks on his feet. His clothes were streaked with mud. “You have to come see what I found in the woods.” “Another witch?” “No. Way cooler.” “A hobo camp?” “I’m not going to say; you have to come see.” “Does it involve hermits or lunatics?” “No people,” he said. “How far from the yard?” “Not far.” “We could get in trouble. Besides, it’s muddy out.” “Grandpa is hiding a beautiful park in the woods,” Seth blurted. “What?” asked Kendra. “You have to come see it. Put on galoshes or something.” Kendra closed the book. *** The sunlight came and went, depending on the shifting clouds. A soft breeze ruffled the foliage. The woods smelled mulchy. Scrambling over a damp, rotting log, Kendra shrieked when she saw a glistening white frog. Seth turned around. “Awesome.”\n\n“Try disgusting.” “I’ve never seen a white frog,” said Seth. He tried to grab it, but the frog took an enormous leap as he approached. “Whoa! That thing flew!” He checked the underbrush where the frog had landed, but found nothing. “Hurry up,” Kendra said, glancing back the way they had come. The house was no longer in sight. She could not shake the sick, nervous feeling in her stomach. Unlike her little brother, Kendra was not a natural rule breaker. She was in all the accelerated classes at school, got almost perfect grades, kept her room tidy, and always practiced for her piano lessons. Seth, on the other hand, settled for lousy grades, routinely skipped his homework, and earned frequent detentions. Of course, he was also the one with all the friends, so maybe there was a method to his madness. “What’s the rush?” He took the lead again, blazing a trail through the undergrowth. “The longer we’re gone, the more likely somebody will notice we’re missing.” “It isn’t much farther. See that hedge?” It was not exactly a hedge. More like a tall barrier of unkempt bushes. “You call that a hedge?” “The park is on the far side.” The wall of bushes extended as far as Kendra could see in either direction. “How do we get around it?” “Through it. You’ll see.” They reached the bushes and Seth turned left, studying the leafy barricade as he went, occasionally squatting and checking closer. The interlocked bushes ranged from ten to twelve feet tall, and they looked really thick. “Okay, I think this is where I squirmed through.” There was a deep indentation at the base of where two bushes overlapped. Seth dropped to all fours and forced his way in. “You’re going to have a billion ticks,” Kendra predicted. “They’re all hiding from the rain,” he replied with perfect confidence. Kendra got down and followed him. “I don’t think this is the same way I got through last time,” Seth admitted. “It’s a little more cramped. But it should work.” He was now\n\nslithering on his belly. “This better be good.” Kendra squirmed on her elbows, eyes squinted. The damp ground felt cold, and droplets fell from the bush as she jostled it. Seth reached the far side and stood up. She crawled through as well, her eyes widening as she got to her feet. Before her lay a pristine pond, a couple of hundred yards across, with a small, verdant island at the center. A series of elaborate gazebos surrounded the pond, interconnected by a whitewashed boardwalk. Flowering vines wound along the latticework of the impressive promenade. Elegant swans glided on the water. Butterflies and hummingbirds wove and darted among the blossoms. On the far side of the pond, peacocks strutted and preened. “What in the world?” Kendra gasped. “Come on.” Seth started across the lush, neatly mown lawn toward the nearest gazebo. Kendra looked back, understanding why Seth had called the disheveled barrier of bushes a hedge. On this side, the bushes were neatly trimmed. The hedgerow encompassed the entire area, with a single arched entryway off to one side. “Why didn’t we come through the entryway?” Kendra asked, trotting after her brother. “Shortcut.” Seth paused at the white steps leading up to the gazebo to pluck a piece of fruit from an espalier. “Try one.” “You should wash it,” Kendra said. “It just rained.” He took a bite. “It’s so good.” Kendra tried one. It was the sweetest nectarine she had ever tasted. “Delicious.” Together they mounted the steps of the extravagant pavilion. The wood railing was perfectly smooth. Although unshielded from the elements, all the woodwork appeared to be in flawless condition: no peeling paint, no cracks, no splinters. The gazebo was furnished with white wicker love seats and chairs. In some places the ubiquitous vines had been woven into living wreaths and other fanciful patterns. A bright parrot sat on a high perch staring down at them. “Look at the parrot!” Kendra exclaimed. “Last time I saw some monkeys,” Seth said. “Little guys with long arms. They were swinging all over the place. And there was a goat. It ran away as soon as it saw me.”\n\nSeth took off, clomping down one of the boardwalks. Kendra followed more slowly, absorbing the scene. It looked like the setting of a fairy-tale wedding. She counted twelve pavilions, each unique. One had a small white quay projecting into the pond. The little pier was connected to a floating shed that had to be a boathouse. Kendra strolled after Seth, whose ruckus was sending the swans drifting toward the far side of the lake, leaving V-shaped ripples in their\n\nwake. The sun broke through the clouds and gleamed upon the water. Why would Grandpa Sorenson keep a place like this a secret? It was magnificent! Why go through all the trouble of maintaining it if not to enjoy it? Hundreds of people could gather here with room to spare. Kendra went to the gazebo with the pier and found that the boathouse was locked. It was not large; she guessed it held a few canoes or rowboats. Maybe Grandpa Sorenson would give them permission to paddle around the pond. No, she could not even tell him she knew about this place! Was that why he had told them about the ticks and made rules against venturing into the woods? To keep his little Eden hidden? Could he be so selfish and secretive? Kendra finished a complete lap around the pond, walking on clean wooden planks the entire way. Across the pond Seth yelled, and a small flock of cockatoos took flight. The sun retreated behind clouds. They needed to get back. Kendra told herself she could return later. *** Kendra was concerned when she cut into her steak. The middle was pink, almost red at the center. Grandpa Sorenson and Dale were already taking bites. “Is my steak cooked?” Kendra ventured. “’Course it’s cooked,” Dale said around a mouthful. “It’s pretty red in the middle.” “Only way to eat a steak,” Grandpa said, dabbing his mouth with a linen napkin. “Medium rare. Keeps it juicy and tender. If you cook it all the way through, you might as well eat shoe leather.” Kendra glanced at Lena. “Go ahead, dear,” the woman urged. “You won’t get sick; I cooked it plenty.” “I like it,” Seth said, chewing on a bite. “We have any ketchup?” “Why would you go and ruin a perfectly good steak with ketchup?” Dale moaned. “You put it on your eggs,” Lena reminded him, placing a bottle in front of Seth. “That’s different. Ketchup and onions on eggs is a necessity.” “That’s sickening,” Seth said, upending the bottle over his steak.\n\nKendra took a bite of the garlic potatoes. They were tasty. Mustering her courage, she sampled the steak. Bursting with flavorful seasoning, it was much easier to chew than other steak she had eaten. “The steak is wonderful,” she said. “Thank you, dear,” said Lena. They ate in silence for a few moments. Grandpa dabbed his mouth with his napkin again and cleared his throat. “What do you suppose makes people so eager to break rules?” Kendra felt a jolt of guilt. The question was addressed generally and hung there awaiting a response. When nobody answered, Grandpa continued. “Is it simply the pleasure of disobedience? The thrill of rebellion?” Kendra glanced at Seth. He stared at his plate, picking at his potatoes. “Were the rules unfair, Kendra? Was I being unreasonable?” “No.” “Did I leave you with nothing to do, Seth? No pool? No tree house? No toys or hobbies?” “We had things to do.” “Then why did you two go into the woods? I warned you there would be consequences.” “Why are you hiding weird old ladies out in the forest?” Seth blurted. “Weird old ladies?” Grandpa asked. “Yeah, what about that?” Grandpa nodded thoughtfully. “She has a rotten old rope. You didn’t blow on it?” “I didn’t go near her. She was freaky.” “She came to me and asked if she could build a shack on my property. She promised to keep to herself. I saw no harm in it. You shouldn’t go bothering her.” “Seth found your private retreat,” Kendra said. “He wanted me to see it. My curiosity got the better of me.” “Private retreat?” “Big pond? Fancy boardwalk? Parrots and swans and peacocks?” Grandpa looked at Dale, speechless. Dale shrugged. “I was hoping you’d take us out on a boat,” Kendra said.\n\n“Who said anything about a boat?” Kendra rolled her eyes. “I saw the boathouse, Grandpa.” He tossed his hands up and shook his head. Kendra set her fork down. “Why would you let such a nice place go to waste?” “That is my business,” Grandpa said. “Yours was to obey my rules, for your own protection.” “We’re not afraid of ticks,” Seth said. Grandpa folded his hands and lowered his eyes. “I was not entirely honest about why you needed to stay out of the woods.” He lifted his gaze. “On my land, I provide refuge for some dangerous animals, many of them endangered. This includes poisonous snakes, toads, spiders, and scorpions, along with bigger game. Wolves, apes, panthers. I use chemicals and other controls to keep them away from the yard, but the woods are extremely hazardous. Particularly the island in the center of the lake. It is deliberately infested with inland taipans, also called ‘fierce snakes,’ the deadliest serpent known to man.” “Why didn’t you warn us?” Kendra asked. “My preserve is a secret. I have all the necessary licenses, but if my neighbors complained, those could be revoked. You must not tell a soul, not even your parents.” “We saw a white frog,” Seth said breathlessly. “Was that poisonous?” Grandpa nodded. “Quite lethal. In Central America the indigenous people use them to fashion poisoned darts.” “Seth tried to catch it.” “Had he succeeded,” Grandpa said gravely, “he would be dead.” Seth swallowed. “I’ll never go into the woods again.” “I trust you won’t,” Grandpa said. “All the same, a rule is of no value unless the punishment is enforced. You will have to stay in your room for the rest of your stay.” “What?” Seth said. “But you lied to us! Being afraid of ticks is a lame reason to stay out of the woods! I just thought you were treating us like babies.” “You should have brought those concerns to me,” Grandpa said. “Was I unclear about the rules or the consequences?” “You were unclear about the reasons,” Seth said. “That is my right. I am your grandfather. And this is my property.”\n\n“I am your grandson. You should tell me the truth. You’re not setting a very good example.” Kendra tried not to laugh. Seth was in lawyer mode. He always tried to maneuver out of trouble with their parents. Sometimes he made some pretty good points. “What do you think, Kendra?” Grandpa asked. She had not expected him to solicit her opinion. She tried to collect her thoughts. “Well, I agree that you didn’t tell us the whole truth. No way would I have gone into the woods if I knew there would be dangerous animals.” “Me neither,” Seth said. “I made two simple rules, you understood them, and you broke them. Just because I chose not to share all my reasons for making the rules, you think you should escape punishment?” “Yes,” Seth said. “Just this once.” “That doesn’t sound fair to me,” Grandpa said. “Unless the punishments are enforced, rules lose all their power.” “But we won’t do it again,” Seth said. “We promise. Don’t lock us up in the house for two weeks!” “Don’t blame me,” Grandpa said. “You locked yourself up by disregarding the rules. Kendra, what do you think would be fair?” “Maybe you could give us a reduced punishment as a warning. Then the full punishment if we mess up again.” “Reduced punishment,” Grandpa mused. “So you still pay a price for your disobedience, but you get one more chance. I might be able to live with that. Seth?” “Better than the whole punishment.” “That settles it. I will reduce your sentence to a single day. You will spend tomorrow confined to the attic. You can come down for meals, and you can use the bathroom, but that is all. Break any of my rules again, and you will not leave the attic until your parents come for you. For your own safety. Understood?” “Yes, sir,” Kendra said. Seth nodded his agreement.\n\nChapter 5\n\nJournal of Secrets Did you ever notice the keyhole on the belly of the unicorn?” Seth asked. He was lying on the floor beside the fanciful rocking horse, hands laced behind his head. Kendra looked up from her painting. She had asked Lena to create a paint-by-numbers to help her endure her incarceration. Kendra had wanted to paint the pavilions around the pond, and Lena had quickly sketched a scene with startling accuracy, as if the housekeeper had the place memorized. Seth declined to have another canvas prepped. Stuck in the attic or not, he was sick of painting. “Keyhole?” “Weren’t you looking for keyholes?” Kendra got off her stool and crouched beside her brother. Sure enough, there was a tiny keyhole on the underside of the unicorn. She retrieved her keys from the nightstand drawer. The third key Grandpa Sorenson had given her did the trick. A small hatch swung open. Out fell several rose-shaped chocolates wrapped in gold foil, identical to the one she had found in the miniature armoire. “What are those?” Seth asked. “Soap,” Kendra said.\n\nKendra reached up into the hatch and felt around inside the hollow rocking horse. She found a few more rosebud chocolates and a tiny golden key like the one from the armoire. The second key to the locked journal! “They look like candy,” Seth said, snatching one of the ten chocolates. “Have one. They’re perfumed. You’ll smell pretty.” He unwrapped it. “Funny color for soap. Smells a lot like chocolate.” He popped the whole thing in his mouth. His eyebrows shot up. “Holy cow, this is good!” “Since you found the keyhole, how about we split them fifty-fifty.” She was a little worried he would eat all of them otherwise. “Sounds fair,” he said, grabbing four more. Kendra placed her five chocolates in the nightstand drawer and retrieved the locked book. As she expected, the second gold key unlocked another clasp. Where could the third one be? She slapped her forehead. The first two had been hidden inside things the other keys had opened. The other one must be in the jewelry box! Opening the jewelry box, she rummaged through the compartments of glittering pendants, brooches, and rings. Sure enough, disguised on a charm bracelet, she found a tiny golden key matching the other two. Kendra eagerly crossed the room and inserted the key into the final lock on the Journal of Secrets. The final clasp unlatched and she opened the book. The first page was blank. So was the second. She thumbed quickly through the pages. The whole book was blank. Just an empty journal. Was Grandpa Sorenson trying to encourage her to keep a diary? But the whole game with the keys had been so sneaky. Maybe there was a trick to this as well. A hidden message. Disappearing ink or something. What was the trick with disappearing ink? Spray it with lemon juice and hold it up to a light? Something like that. And there was another trick where you rubbed gently with a pencil and a message appeared. Or maybe something even more devious. Kendra surveyed the journal more carefully, hunting for clues. She held a few pages up against the window to see if the light would betray hidden watermarks or other mysterious evidence. “What are you doing?” Seth asked. He had only one chocolate rosebud left. She would need to hide her chocolates someplace more\n\nsecure than the nightstand drawer. She held up a final page. The light revealed nothing. “Practicing for my audition at the insane asylum.” “I bet you’ll win first prize,” he teased. “Unless they see your face,” she retorted. Seth went over and scooped some kernels for Goldilocks. “She laid another egg.” He opened the cage to retrieve it and stroked her soft feathers. Kendra plopped down on the bed, leafing through the last pages. Suddenly she stopped. There was writing on one of the final pages. Not really hidden, just tucked away in an unlikely spot. Three words written near the binding, toward the bottom of an otherwise empty page. Drink the milk. Folding the corner, she flipped through the remaining pages. Then she skimmed the rest of the pages from the start to make sure she had missed no similar messages. There were no other cryptic clues. Drink the milk. Maybe soaking a page in milk would make words appear. She could soak one in the tins of milk Dale left out. Or that could be the milk the message was talking about! A challenge to drink unprocessed cow’s milk—what purpose could that serve? To give her diarrhea? Dale had made a special point of warning her not to drink the milk. Of course, he had acted sort of peculiar about it. He could be hiding something. Drink the milk. All the hassle of finding holes for the keys Grandpa Sorenson gave her, in order to uncover extra keys that fit a locked journal, for that odd message? Was she missing something, or overanalyzing? The hunt might have simply been meant to occupy her time. “Do you think Mom and Dad would let us get a pet chicken?” Seth asked, holding the hen. “Probably right after they get us a pet buffalo.” “Why don’t you ever hold Goldilocks? She’s really good.” “Holding a live chicken sounds disgusting.” “Better than holding a dead one.” “I’m fine just petting her.”\n\n“You’re missing out.” Seth held the hen up to his face. “You’re a good chicken, aren’t you, Goldilocks?” The hen clucked softly. “She’s going to peck your eyes out,” Kendra warned. “No way, she’s tame.” Popping one of the rosebud chocolates in her mouth, Kendra replaced the Journal of Secrets in the nightstand drawer and returned to her painting. She scowled. Between the gazebos, pond, and swans, the picture required more than thirty shades of white, gray, and silver. Using the sample hues Lena had given her, she prepared her next color. *** The sun was bright the next day. There was no evidence that it had ever rained or that it would ever rain again. Hummingbirds, butterflies, and bumblebees had returned to the yard. Lena gardened in the back beneath a large sun hat. Kendra sat in the shade on the back porch. No longer a prisoner in the attic, she felt better able to enjoy the fine weather. She wondered if the diverse butterflies she saw in the yard were among the species Grandpa Sorenson had imported. How did you keep a butterfly from leaving your property? The milk, perhaps? She passed the time with a game she had found on a shelf in the attic —a triangular board with fifteen holes and fourteen pegs. The object was to jump pegs like checkers until you had only one left, which sounded simple at first. The problem was that in the process of jumping, certain pegs ended up stranded, unable to jump or be jumped. The number of pegs you left stranded on the board determined your score. Her best effort so far was three, which the directions labeled typical. Leaving two was good. One was genius. Five or more labeled you hopeless. While resetting the pegs for a fresh attempt, Kendra saw what she had been waiting for. Dale was walking along the perimeter of the yard with a pie tin. Setting the peg game on a table, she hurried to intercept him. Dale looked mildly distressed at her approach. “I can’t let Lena see you talking to me like this,” he murmured in low tones. “I’m supposed to put the milk out on the sly.” “I thought nobody knew you put the milk out.”\n\n“Right. See, your grandfather doesn’t know, but Lena does. We try to keep it our secret.” “I was wondering what the milk tastes like.” He looked nervous. “Didn’t you hear me last time? You could get . . . shingles. Scabies. Scurvy.” “Scurvy?” “This milk is a bacterial stew. That’s why the insects like it so well.” “I have friends who have tried milk fresh from the cow. They survived.” “I’m sure those were healthy cows,” Dale said. “These cows are . . . never you mind. Idea is, this ain’t just any milk. It’s highly contaminated. I wash my hands good after even handling the stuff.” “So you don’t think I should taste it.” “Not unless you’re aiming for a premature burial.” “Would you at least take me in the barn to see the cows?” “See the cows? That would be breaking your grandfather’s rules!” “I thought the point was we might get hurt,” Kendra said. “I’ll be fine if you’re with me.” “Your grandfather’s rules are your grandfather’s rules. He has his reasons. I’m not about to go breaking them. Or bending them either.” “No? Maybe if you let me see the cows, I’ll keep your secret about putting out the milk.” “Now see, that’s blackmail. I’ll not stand for blackmail.” “I wonder what Grandpa will say when I tell him at dinner tonight.” “He’ll likely say you ought to mind your own affairs. Now, with your leave, I have chores to do.” She watched him walk away with the tin of milk. He surely had acted defensive and strange. There was definitely some mystery surrounding the milk. But all the talk about bacteria made her reluctant to try it. She needed a guinea pig. *** Seth tried a flip off the boulder into the pool, but landed on his back. He never could quite make it all the way around. He surfaced and stroked to the side to try again. “Nice back-flop,” Kendra said, standing beside the pool. “That was one for the blooper reel.”\n\nSeth climbed out of the water. “I’d like to see you do a better one. Where have you been?” “I found out a secret.” “What?” “I can’t explain. But I can show you.” “Good as the lake?” “Not quite. Hurry up.” Putting a towel over his shoulders, Seth stepped into his sandals. Kendra led him away from the pool through the garden to some flowering shrubs on the outskirts of the yard. Behind the plants lay a large pie tin full of milk where a crowd of hummingbirds were feeding. “They drink milk?” he asked. “Yeah, but that isn’t the point. Taste it.” “Why?” “You’ll see.” “Have you tried it?” “Yes.” “What’s the big deal?” “I told you, try it and you’ll see.” Kendra watched curiously as he kneeled by the tin. The hummingbirds dispersed. Seth dipped a finger into the milk and put it on his tongue. “Pretty good. Sweet.” “Sweet?” He lowered his head and puckered his lips against the surface of the milk. Pulling back, he wiped his mouth. “Yeah, sweet and creamy. A little warm, though.” Looking beyond Kendra, his eyes bulged. Seth jumped to his feet, screaming and pointing. “What the heck are those?” Kendra turned. All she saw was a butterfly and a couple of hummingbirds. She looked back at Seth. He was turning in circles, eyes darting around the garden, apparently perplexed and amazed. “They’re everywhere,” he said in awe. “What are?” “Look around. The fairies.” Kendra stared at her brother. Could the milk have totally fried his brain? Or was he messing around with her? He didn’t appear to be faking. He was over by a rosebush gazing at a butterfly in wonder. Tentatively he reached a hand toward it, but it fluttered out of reach.\n\nHe turned back to Kendra. “Was it the milk? This is way cooler than the lake!” His excitement seemed genuine. Kendra eyed the tin of milk. Drink the milk. If Seth was playing a prank, his acting skills had suddenly improved tenfold. She dipped a finger and put it in her mouth. Seth was right. It was sweet and warm. For an instant the sun gleamed in her eyes, making her blink. She glanced back at her brother, who was creeping up on a small group of hovering fairies. Three had wings like butterflies, one like a dragonfly. She could not suppress a shriek at the impossible sight. Kendra looked back at the milk. A fairy with hummingbird wings was drinking from her cupped hand. Other than the wings, the fairy looked like a slender woman not quite two inches tall. She wore a glittering turquoise slip and had long, dark hair. When Kendra leaned closer, the fairy zipped away. There was no way she was really seeing this, right? There had to be an explanation. But the fairies were everywhere, near and far, shimmering in vivid colors. How could she deny what was before her eyes? As Kendra continued to survey the garden, startled disbelief melted into wonder. Fairies of all conceivable varieties flitted about, exploring blossoms, gliding on the breeze, and acrobatically avoiding her brother. Roaming the pathways of the garden in a daze, Kendra saw that the fairy women appeared to represent all nationalities. Some looked Asian, some Indian, some African, some European. Several were less comparable to mortal women, with blue skin or emerald green hair. A few had antennae. Their wings came in all varieties, mostly patterned after butterflies, but much more elegantly shaped and radiantly colored. All the fairies gleamed brilliantly, outshining the flowers of the garden like the sun outshines the moon. Rounding a corner on a pathway, Kendra stopped short. There stood Grandpa Sorenson, wearing a flannel shirt and work boots, arms folded across his chest. “We need to talk,” he said. *** The grandfather clock tolled the hour, chiming three times after the introductory melody. Sitting in a high-backed leather armchair in\n\nGrandpa Sorenson’s study, Kendra wondered if grandfather clocks got their name because only grandparents owned them. She looked over at Seth, seated in an identical chair. It looked too big for him. These were chairs for adults. Why had Grandpa Sorenson left the room? Were they in trouble? After all, he had given her the keys that ended up leading her and the guinea pig to sample the milk. Even so, she could not quit worrying that she had discovered something that was meant to stay hidden. Not only were fairies real, but Grandpa Sorenson had hundreds in his yard. “Is that a fairy skull?” Seth asked, pointing to the flat-bottomed globe with the thumb-sized skull on Grandpa’s desk. “Probably,” Kendra said. “Are we busted?” “We better not be. There were no rules against drinking milk.” The study door slid open. Grandpa entered along with Lena, who carried three mugs on a tray. Lena offered Kendra a mug, then Seth and Grandpa. The mug contained hot chocolate. Lena left the room as Grandpa took a seat behind his desk. “I am impressed how quickly you solved my puzzle,” he said, taking a sip from his mug. “You wanted us to drink the milk?” Kendra said. “Assuming you were the right kind of people. Frankly, I don’t know you that well. I hoped that the kind of person who would take the trouble to solve my little puzzle would be the kind of person who could handle the notion of a preserve full of magical creatures. Fablehaven would be too much to swallow for most people.” “Fablehaven?” Seth repeated. “The name the founders gave this preserve centuries ago. A refuge for mystical creatures, a stewardship passed down from caretaker to caretaker over the years.” Kendra tried the hot chocolate. It was superb! The flavor made her think of the rosebud chocolates. “What do you have besides fairies?” Seth asked. “Many beings, great and small. Which is the true reason the woods are off-limits. There are creatures out there much more perilous than venomous snakes or wild apes. Only certain orders of magical life forms\n\nare generally permitted in the yard. Fairies, pixies, and such.” Grandpa took another sip from his mug. “You like the hot chocolate?” “It’s wonderful,” Kendra said. “Made from the same milk you sampled in the garden today. Same milk the fairies drink. Just about the only food they’ll eat. When mortals drink it, their eyes are opened to an unseen world. But the effects wear off after a day. Lena will prepare you a cup every morning so you can stop stealing from the fairies.” “Where does it come from?” Kendra asked. “We make it special in the barn. We have some dangerous creatures in there, too, so it’s still off-limits.” “Why’s everything off-limits?” Seth complained. “I’ve been a long way into those woods four times and I’ve always been fine.” “Four times?” Grandpa said. “All before the warning,” Seth amended hastily. “Yes, well, your eyes were not yet opened to what truly surrounded you. And you were fortunate. Even when you were blind to the enchanted creatures populating the forest, there are many places you could have ventured into from which you would not have returned. Of course, now that you can see them, the creatures here can interact with you much more readily, so the danger is much greater.” “No offense, Grandpa, but is this really the truth?” Kendra asked. “You’ve told us so many versions of why the woods are forbidden.” “You saw the fairies,” he said. Kendra leaned forward. “Maybe the milk made us hallucinate. Maybe they were holograms. Maybe you just keep telling us whatever you think we’ll believe.” “I understand your concern,” Grandpa said. “I wanted to protect you from the truth about Fablehaven unless you sought it out for yourselves. It is not the kind of information I wanted to thrust upon you. That is the truth. What I’m telling you now is the truth. You’ll have ample opportunity to confirm my words.” “So the animals we saw at the pond were actually other creatures, like how the butterflies were fairies,” Kendra clarified. “Most assuredly. The pond can be a hazardous place. Return there now, and you would find friendly naiads beckoning you near the water in order to pull you under and drown you.” “That’s so cruel!” Kendra said.\n\n“Depends on your perspective,” Grandpa said, spreading his hands. “To them, your life is so ridiculously short that to kill you is seen as absurd and funny. No more tragic than squashing a moth. Besides, they have a right to punish trespassers. The island at the center of the pond is a shrine to the Fairy Queen. No mortal is permitted to tread there. I know of a groundskeeper who broke that rule. The moment he set foot on the sacred island, he transformed into a cloud of dandelion fluff, clothes and all. He scattered on the breeze and was never seen again.” “Why would he go there?” Kendra asked. “The Fairy Queen is widely considered the most powerful figure in all fairydom. The groundskeeper had a desperate need and went to plead for her assistance. Apparently she was not impressed.” “In other words, he had no respect for what was off-limits,” Kendra said, giving Seth a meaningful look. “Precisely,” Grandpa agreed. “The queen of the fairies lives on that little island?” Seth asked. “No. It is merely a shrine meant to honor her. Similar shrines abound on my property, and all can be dangerous.” “If the pond is dangerous, why does it have a boathouse?” Kendra asked. “A previous caretaker of this preserve had a fascination with naiads.” “The dandelion guy?” Seth asked. “A different guy,” Grandpa said. “It’s a long story. Ask Lena about it sometime; I believe she knows the tale.” Kendra shifted in the oversized chair. “Why do you live in such a scary place?” Grandpa folded his arms on the desk. “It’s only frightening if you go where you don’t belong. This entire sanctuary is consecrated ground, governed by laws that cannot be broken by the creatures who dwell here. Only on this hallowed soil could mortals interact with these beings with any measure of safety. As long as mortals remain within their boundaries, they are protected by the founding covenants of this preserve.” “Covenants?” Seth asked. “Agreements. Specifically, a treaty ratified by all the orders of whimsical life forms who dwell here that affords a measure of security for mortal caretakers. In a world where mortal man has become the\n\ndominant force, most creatures of enchantment have fled to refuges like this one.” “What are the covenants?” Kendra asked. “The specific details are complex, with many limitations and exceptions. Speaking broadly, they are based on the law of the harvest, the law of retribution. If you do not bother the creatures, they will not bother you. That is what affords you so much protection when you are unable to see them. You can’t interact with them, so they generally behave likewise.” “But now we can see them,” Seth said. “Which is why you must use caution. The fundamental premises of the law are mischief for mischief, magic for magic, violence for violence. They will not initiate trouble unless you break the rules. You have to open the door. If you harass them, you open the door for them to harass you. Hurt them, they can hurt you. Use magic on them, they will use magic on you.” “Use magic?” Seth said eagerly. “Mortals were never meant to use magic,” Grandpa said. “We are nonmagical beings. But I have learned a few practical principles that help me manage things. Nothing you would find very remarkable.” “Can you turn Kendra into a toad?” “No. But there are beings out there who could. And I would not be able to change her back. Which is why I need to finish this thought: Breaking the rules can include trespassing where you are not allowed. There are geographic boundaries set where certain creatures are allowed and certain creatures, including mortals, are not permitted. The boundaries function as a way to contain the darker creatures without causing an uproar. If you go where you do not belong, you could open the door to vicious retribution from powerful enemies.” “So only good creatures can enter the yard,” Kendra said. Grandpa became very serious. “None of these creatures are good. Not the way we think of good. None are safe. Much of morality is peculiar to mortality. The best creatures here are merely not evil.” “The fairies aren’t safe?” Seth asked. “They aren’t out to harm anyone, or I wouldn’t allow them in the yard. I suppose they are capable of good deeds, but they would not normally do them for what we would consider the right reasons. Take\n\nbrownies, for instance. Brownies don’t fix things to help people. They fix things because they enjoy fixing things.” “Do the fairies talk?” Kendra asked. “Not much to humans. They have a language all their own, although they rarely speak to each other, except to trade insults. Most never condescend to use human speech. They consider everything bene"
