        "text": "Chances are, if you’re reading this, you’re already familiar with the music and fantastical tales of Guild of Lore, but if not, you’re missing out on one of the most revered acts in the genre. Not only is the music consistently outstanding, but the conceptual worlds and landscapes paint a picture of Medieval admiration and enchantment. As if that was not enough, Lamp & Dagger was created and offers a assortment of hand crafted candles, with mystical scents to match a variety of darkened realms. I recently had an opportunity to interview the mastermind behind Guild of Lore to discuss the magnificent force that drives these projects (and several others) to their peak consummation.\n\n1. What an honor it is to have this interview with the great Guild of Lore! How have things been going for you lately?\n\nThings have been going swiftly. Last year was a crazy roller coaster for me, both in my personal life and in music. Felt like a constant mixed bag of good and bad, which I won’t get into. But I say “swiftly” because it felt and continues to feel like time is just moving too fast for my liking. Which I suppose comes with the fact that I’m approaching 50. I am planning on relocating to another state this year, so I imagine that won’t be changing anytime soon. All in all, doing alright.\n\n2. Take us back to the inception of this project. How did you come up with the idea for Guild of Lore and what influenced the name?\n\nSeems like ages ago. I had been working on another project over the Summer of 2018 and was pretty frustrated with it after a couple of months. I kept beating it, twisting and turning it and pulling my hair out trying to get something out of it. To the point that every time I’d try to work on it, I was just making it worse. So somewhere in October, I finally chose to drop it completely, archive it and work on something totally different. That particular end of the year was a cold one. A lot of rain, lots of snow in the mountains and grey and foggy days. Pair that with playing through Skyrim for an umpteenth time and listening to a lot of neo-folk and dark ambient stuff and I had the necessary ingredients for what was to become GOL. Which led me to writing Winterstead and writing differently than I had been in the past. Really taking in my surrounding atmosphere and channeling the type of feelings that Winter can bring. I allowed myself to write freely without expectation, being more influenced by these images of places I had drawn up. I was making a lot of the art at the same time I was recording. As far as the name.. It took a while to fall into place. I probably had 50 different names I was playing with, not one of which I can remember. But both the words Guild and Lore were peppered in there and if I remember right, I looked at them all one night and saw those two words together and it just locked in. I knew that I was building a world which would be rich with lore and thus the Guild was born to record such lore and stories.\n\n3. You’ve created quite a few albums that are in the Winterstead realm. First of all, what a fascinating and creative world it is. How did this concept come about?\n\nAs I said, it all came about simultaneously during the Fall and Winter of 2018. I was writing its background and short stories while writing the music and drawing the art all together. I have a deep love for these two seasons, so they played a big part. But Winterstead quickly grew on its own. To the point that I would sit back a lot of times and ask myself where this or that came from. It would just develop itself. I think that’s when I first realized that this world was much much bigger and that the territories of Winterstead were just one massive part of that world.\n\n4. The first Guild of Lore album, ‘Winterstead’ came out in 2018. Did you have any Dungeon Synth projects going on before this?\n\nNo I didn’t. I mentioned earlier that prior to writing Winterstead, I had been working on an album from a different project. That was for my project called Breather1, which ironically, I had created years prior as a means to take a break or “breather” away from whatever project I might be working on at the time. And honestly I don’t even remember what I was working on in early 2018 that steered me to work on a B1 album. But I do find it very peculiar that the Breather1 album that I was working on to get away from some other project ended up frustrating me enough to put it down to create an entirely new project out of thin air. Perhaps divine intervention? Perhaps the intense effects of the elements. Whatever it was, it helped give birth to my first Dungeon Synth project. A point of interest for those curious. The B1 album that I was working on at that time would later end up being Studies From The Outer Worlds. Which I went back to and completely deconstructed and rebuilt at the beginning of 2020.\n\n5. Musically, Guild of Lore has a vast instrumental sound. Do you use a mix of electronic and acoustic instruments?\n\nYes. But for the most part the majority of it is electronic. I have a lot of acoustic instruments that I am partial to within my DAW. However, on the analog side I’m a bit of a percussion junkie. So there are percussive instruments throughout the discography that have been recorded direct and to analog tape. A lot of which I have sampled as well and integrated into my workstation. Ideally, I would love to own all of the acoustic instruments that I use physically such as the dulcimers and lutes etc. But limited space and life realities have kept those dreams at bay for now. Hopefully the new Guild headquarters will have plenty of space to accommodate new instruments.\n\n6. My introduction to Guild of Lore was the 2019 release, ‘Autumn Massacre’. This is still one of my favorite Dungeon Synth releases. What was the journey of this album about?\n\nWell, my love for Halloween and the Autumnal season played a huge part. And I had already been chomping at the bit to introduce a part of the world that had all of the fantastic things that Autumn brings. Much the same way Winterstead was written, Autumn Macabre took shape quickly and really wrote itself. I took a lot of inspiration from my childhood growing up in Visalia, my home town. Which ended up translating pretty heavily to both the music and the artwork. Foggy cornfields and pumpkin patches. Groves of oaks and walnuts. A countryside filled with mystery and decrepit graveyards unattended all while a sense of foreboding darkness lingers on the edge of sight. The foothills at the base of the Sierras used to be prime for exploring and finding relics and ruins, even if they weren’t that old. Imagination can take you to many wondrous places. The journey, to answer your question, was just that. A romp through all of these places I’d imagined over so many years. Some dark and frightening. Some not so much, but those came out more on Bohollow.\n\n7. Is the ‘Autumn Bohollow’ release a continuation of this concept? If so, do you have any future releases that will continue this story?\n\nIt is. Over the course of writing these albums, it became very clear to me that there were ongoing stories happening in different locations of the world which would lead to multiple albums just based in those locations. Some even overlapping and converging like the way Bohollow ends for instance. Calling for a return to Winterstead, which we have now done and laid the groundwork for yet another Winterstead album to continue that part of the story. However, when concerning the Autumnal lands, the story is far from over. In 2022 I began writing the 3rd Autumn album, which I had very briefly teased at releasing that year. I quickly retracted that idea though. I was approximately 16 tracks deep with a written story that was growing bigger and bigger everyday. I knew there was no way it was going to be ready by October. So I made the decision to throw a curveball into my discography and switched gears to write Night of Halloween. After releasing the Portals albums, I figured why not go through a portal to 1988 USA and put out a Halloween synthwave album? Do some spooky tongue in cheek narrative and give it a 4/4 beat. It was a fun one to make indeed! All the while, I continued to write the 3rd Autumn album and the story kept growing. When I first started, I had a lot of plans to have a full narrative with multiple characters and dialog. And that may still happen, but I’m not too sure, the story is already beyond that of short story length. As I continue to write it, I find myself considering releasing it as a printed book. Which I have long wanted to publish a GOL book as it is, so this may very well be the first to come as it were. The album would obviously need to come at the same time, so as you can imagine it’s a rather large undertaking. I dare say, more so than any other album I’ve written.\n\n8. Tell us how you got involved with The Spine of Night project. The music and the movie were both incredible. How rewarding was this project to do and complete?\n\nI was contacted by Philip in late 2019 after he had listened to Autumn Macabre. He asked if I would be interested in writing a piece for a film that he was working on. Sent a few details about the movie and what he was looking for and I in turn said yes of course. I was excited to work on a soundtrack for film, however the timing of the offer came when I was organizing Dungeon Siege West and preparing to fly to Seattle. You could say my plate at that time was pretty well stacked. Regardless though, I managed to work on the music for Spine of Night even while doing DSW. Which I believe I completed in January or February of 2020. I ended up recording seven tracks for the film, four of which were used. I really enjoyed writing for film and the experience was invaluable. It honestly made me want to find a producer to do some GOL work. Maybe a GOL movie or a series? You never know.\n\n9. Do you know if there will be a Part II for this as well?\n\nThat I do not know, I suppose it’s possible. I’m sure a lot of people would love to see more of that world, myself included.\n\n10. The latest Guild of Lore album, ‘Return To Winterstead’ was a surprise Christmas drop. First of all, THANK YOU! What made you revisit the Winterstead theme?\n\nI knew early on that there would be a return to Winterlands and Bohollow is meant to segue into that return. As I mentioned previously, this album was to lay the groundwork for another, exposing some new locations and to give the listener a welcome back into the snow. But as we know from the journey in Bohollow, all is not well in Winterstead. The Macabre has grown and spread to the snowy land and has given reason for a call to arms. The album was written much in the same style as the original was. Winterstead has always felt more stripped down and organic to me. I opted to use minimal field recordings and used the soundscapes as interludes so that it was more focused on the acoustic songs for the return. These to me tell the stories of this land and help to paint a vivid picture for the listener.\n\n11. I’d like to talk a bit about your Lamp & Dagger label. What a unique concept to not only release some of your other musical projects, but your very own candles as well. How did this endeavor come about?\n\nI am a candle fanatic which has led me to spending a lot of money on them over the years. At one point I stopped and thought, it’s got to be cheaper just to make my own. From there, I fell head first down the rabbit hole. Started ordering supplies and learned how to make them by trial and error. This and the label all sort of came together at the same time. Friends Fen Walker, Sombre Arcane, Shrouded Gate, FVRFVR and Halm had all been artists that I enjoyed, who in talking with had expressed interest in releasing physical material on the label. And I wanted to corral my DS projects under its umbrella as well, keeping with the same level of physical releases that I had been doing with GOL. Pairing the candles with physical releases was something I’d been wanting to do as a form of further immersion for the listener. Having the artwork, the music and the scent of the places they’d travel you to helped to accomplish this. Brendan Elliot became a big part of this as well. His artwork is hands down some of my most favorite out there and the paintings he has done for L&D definitely help to create fantastic places for the listener to visit.\n\n12. I’m also a fan of your Pathworn Pilgrim project and it’s showcases a different creative space than Guild of Lore. How did this project come about?\n\nPathworn was created simply out of my love for The Elder Scrolls. My introduction into that universe was through Morrowind years ago, and has long been a favorite place to revisit. Equally, Cyrodiil and Skyrim both get revisited often each year. Pathworn acts as a means of tribute to these places and looks to expand even further on the musical aspects, giving the listener yet another perspective therein. It’s a project that has been received well within the community and that I very much enjoy working on. Many have asked whether there will be an Oblivion based album, to which I will answer, yes.\n\n13. The Lamp & Dagger “Halloween” releases were incredible too but last year, you created a separate page for Halloween Scene. Why wasn’t that one release on Lamp & Dagger.\n\nI loved This Tape Is Haunted one and too. Aptly named by my friend Brenden, who was loosely putting a spin on the old “This Magazine is Haunted.” The artists on those compilations did phenomenal work and I really enjoyed putting it all together. But this past year I had to come to a decision on whether I was going to continue with it or not and ultimately chose not to. The story for those two albums was pretty straight forward. Making your way to a haunted house as well as the surrounding areas and then actually exploring the inside of the haunted house. It seemed proper to leave the two at that. Though as I have said before, I love Halloween and I love Halloween music. Especially the old sound FX cassettes from days long gone. I used to love collecting those in the 80’s no matter how cheeseball they were, I’d have a bunch lined up for listening throughout October. So came Halloween Scene, which is essentially an extension of the idea that started with This Tape Is Haunted. The project intends to be an audio magazine of sorts with one release per year during the witching season.\n\n14. Will you continue to release annual Halloween albums?\n\nI fully intend to!\n\n15. In 2022, you released a Dark Noir/Dark Jazz album under the moniker, Radio Roadhouse that loosely pays tribute to Twin Peaks. How did this come about and will there be any more releases?\n\nI have long been a fan of the work David Lynch does. But beyond anything he has done, Twin Peaks remains my all time favorite. Before the grand invention of the internet and streaming services, I used to have a marathon once a year where I would just soak up all the Twin Peaks I could. These days, with it readily accessible, I find I go back even more. I watched a lot that year as well as the previous, which ultimately led to me wanting to do a tribute. I’m a big fan of all things jazz and I love the moods that jazz noir can set. Obviously Angelo Badalamenti was a huge influence in that sector, Bohren too as well as my old friend Manet. I really just wanted to expand on some of the things that I loved most about this place. Everything from the campy cheese to the down right dark and scary. And before I knew it, I had an album. Which I quickly had to put a lid on, because it was growing way too fast in track count. Originally it was meant to be a one and done project, but I’m not so sure now. The desire to do more jazz and jazz noir comes and goes often with me. And it has a tendency to leak into other projects a lot. You can find it especially in B1 and even GOL.. So I may end up going back to Radio Roadhouse just to fulfill that need and expand more on some Twin Peaks ideas.\n\n16. I can’t end this interview without mentioning Breather 1 – the dystopian-based, chillwave/synthwave projects with a handful of amazing releases. What brought about this project?\n\nBreather1 was originally intended as an escape for me. Something to switch gears and get away from other projects I might be working on. I learned that it was good for me to have multiple projects to bounce between so that I would encounter less writer’s block and tunnel vision. It was also my excuse to do sci-fi/space music, something that at first I didn’t have to take too seriously. That began to change after the Outer Worlds album when it really started to develop a more synthwave/cyberpunk direction. With no intention of putting it into a box of course, the project still remains loose to me, without boundaries. But it has become pretty evident in direction.\n\n17. I absolutely loved ‘The Noodle Bar’ and am hoping that ‘The Sushi Bar’ will be a future follow-up (LOL). Do you have plans to continue this synthwave endeavor?\n\nI think it’s inevitable that the project is going to continue down this path. I like the material and the world that it’s sitting in right now. And I have often thought about doing a follow up to Noodle Bar, perhaps another mystery that takes place in this dystopian city. But we shall see.. I also would like to expand further into another Drive album, which is something I really enjoy working on. I like solo drives at night with minimalistic, repetitive almost drone synth music playing. I used to do that a lot. Go find some roads on the outskirts of town and just get lost driving. It’s good therapy and helps to clear the headspace.\n\n18. What are your musical plans for 2024? Do you have any physical releases (cassettes, CD’s, etc.) planed as well?\n\nYeah, this year is going to be very busy for me. Firstly, preparing to relocate to the state of Texas will be a pretty big venture. My wife and I have spent the past year working on this and even spent some time there last Spring to scout locations. It will surely be an adventure with our three dogs, five cats and the possibility of even bringing along a couple of strays that we take care of. I know it’s not the most ideal place for someone who is a Fall/Winter lover and is used to having access to a massive mountain range. But as they say, change is good and opens new doors. And with the recent surge of DS artists and live shows happening in TX, I’m really feeling optimistic about the move. This is obviously going to directly affect everything I do from L&D to writing music. I’m hoping that once settled I can get back to work on both as I am way behind on physical releases. And I get asked a lot about that. There are plans to release the albums that I have done over the past year physically. When it will happen and in what capacity I just don’t know yet, which I imagine is just as frustrating to fans as it is to me. But rest assured, these things are constantly on my radar.\n\n19. I really appreciate your time and most of all your music and friendship! Do you have any final thoughts for those that may be reading this interview?\n\nI would very much like to express my eternal gratitude to all of the folks out there who continue to listen to and support what I do. None of this work would exist without them. So a very big thank you to all of you. And a huge thank you to the dungeon in deep space for everything that it has done and for having me here for this interview. This site has been an instrumental place for getting the word out on dungeon synth and dark ambient that people might not otherwise know about. Much respect to you for that! I am looking forward to this new year and to all the new adventures that it brings!\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://guildoflore.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://lampanddagger.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://halloweenscene.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://pathwornpilgrim.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://radioroadhouse.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://breather1.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/guildoflore?igsh=ZGF5bGJ3dHhjaGh4\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lampanddaggerco?igsh=d3J2YnM1YzZrNW1k\n\nThis was another fantastic year for Dark Ambient music. Not only were there many releases from well-known artists, but there were many great releases from up and coming artists as well. That being said, I was a fan of so many Dark Ambient albums this year, that it was almost impossible to come up with a Top 10. I could have easily had a Top 100 but it would have taken me forever to compile and write about each of them. After much thought (and a few changes along the way), I’m happy with this Top 10 list and hope you enjoy it as well. If some chance you’ve not heard any of these projects, I highly recommend them. Happy readings, Happy New Year and I already can’t wait for 2024!\n\n10. Monasterium Imperi – Sanctium Choir Collection\n\nScorpio V has released four extremely impressive albums under the Monasterium Imperi moniker this year but ‘Sanctium Choir Collection’ is the grandest of them all. Over two hours of bleak, Gregorian chants over haunting drones is exactly what I love about this project and ‘Sanctium Choir Collection’ delivers in a monumental way. In all honesty, I wish this album was about four hours long but the seven epic tracks contained within will do just fine. Perfect for meditation, background noise or sleep music, I can’t recommend this one enough. Even though it’s only been out about a week, it definitely deserves a spot on my year end list. Don’t sleep on this one!\n\n9. Infinexhuma – Denown\n\nInfinexhuma released ‘Denown’ back in March and it’s been one of my go-to Dark Ambient albums ever since. Featuring a murky blend of industrial noises and immeasurable drones, this album almost has a ritualistic essence to it. This intense collection of colossal modulations is – at times – downright terrifying. There are bits of sinister vocalizations that will have you checking the perimeters for evil entities and I wouldn’t recommend this to fall asleep to, unless you desire the most extreme forms of nightmares in existence. Highly recommended for fans of more extreme forms of Dark Ambient music.\n\n8. Metatron Omega – Kataphasis\n\nScorpio V’s second entry in this year end list is for his bellwether project, Metatron Omega. Released on the mammoth Cryo Chamber label, ‘Kataphasis’ continues a long string of Metatron Omega albums that emphasizes Dark Choir chants and haunting ambient textures. In addition to the elongated droning modulations, there are some beautifully melodies throughout that adds another dimension to this imposing offering. Chances are, if you’re reading this article, then you’re already aware of this massive project and the consistent vibes of the six releases available on the Cryo Chamber label Bandcamp site; but if you’re not familiar with Metatron Omega, I highly recommend ‘Kataphasis’ as a starting point.\n\n7. Dev-I-Ant – A Place Of Warmth And Tears\n\nDev-I-Ant is another amazing project that has a pretty consistent catalog of sinister offerings. From the opening modulations of ‘A Place Of Warmth And Tears’, I knew this album was going to be a malevolent journey into the depths of darkness. From terrifying soundscapes throughout and the horror-like theme that spews from every track, there is no way that I could leave this masterpiece off of my year end list. If your aim is to be aghast while experiencing Dark Ambient music, then look no further than this album and be prepared for a frightful encounter.\n\n6. Sonologyst – Shortwave Spectrum\n\nSonologyst excels at releasing masterful Dark Ambient albums that build upon isolationism through elongated drones and minimalist haunts. On the projects latest effort, ‘Shortwave Spectrum’, the intonations go above and beyond than ever before. Featuring over ninety minutes of ghastly sequences that are reminiscent of sounds that may be heard at an abandoned communication station, these tracks provide the full experience of abandonment and psychotic terror. Although not as ominous as other releases in my collection of Top 10 releases, there is an everlasting presence of dread that has an equivalent effect. If nominal Dark Ambience is your thing, then the works of Sonologyst will be right up your alley and ‘Shortwave Spectrum’ would be the perfect starting point for diving into this eerie style.\n\n5. Eshaton – Pneumos\n\nThe third and final entry for this Top 10 list by Scorpio V is the enthralling, latest chapter of raw, Gregorian Chants by Eshaton called, ‘Pneumos’. Consisting of a single, thirty four minute track, ‘Pneumos’ builds upon coarse production efforts, grainy synth modulations and persistent dark choir effects to deliver an ancient – almost Medieval – sound that is consistently bleak but with an emotive posture. As Scorpio V continues to expand his unique sound fit for a fantastical universe, Eshaton is quickly becoming my favorite project out of all of his endeavors. Even fans of Dungeon Synth will become drawn to this effort and appreciate this massive sound for what it is – dismal and introspective.\n\n4. Blackweald – The Fermi Exhibit\n\nI continue to be astonished by the consistent output from Blackweald. Not only are the albums filled with dreadful, Dark Ambient soundscapes, but the theme choices and album length are a huge undertaking as well. ‘The Fermi Exhibit’ is over five hours of unhinged, maniacal ambient music that contains bits of Space Ambient, Ritualistic tones, industrial Ambient and Isolationism all wrapped up in a single release. Additionally, the use of field recordings and demonic effects are prevalent throughout, making this a true Dark Ambient masterpiece. My favorite track is the one hour, forty four minute long “Vast Emptiness”, as it is a Space Ambient showcase that goes from nominal tones to penetrating horror and the listener gets to experience the dark unknowns of doomed space travels. Don’t pass on this immaculate offering.\n\n3. Stars Without Light – Beneath And Before\n\nStars Without Light is a completely new listening experience for me and I was immediately hooked when listening to ‘Beneath And Before’. Even though this is the first album from this project, it’s easy to identify that the music contained within is the product of a veteran Dark Ambient musician. From crisp drones to apocalyptic soundscapes, this is for certain, one of the darkest offerings in my Top 10 list. At times, it borders into complete noise terror with complacent Industrialism, with a surprising ritualistic twist, and other times it sways through chaotic soundscapes that are equivalent to vicious nightmares. Even though this offering is just under thirty six minutes, you’ll feel completely drained of any comforts upon the first listen. This is a brilliant release that must be heard by all fans of Dark Ambient music.\n\n2. Ruptured World – Xenoplanetary\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the Planetary series by Ruptured World, then you’re probably living under a rock or are not familiar with Ambient music in the first place. All jokes aside, This series – which consists of four releases – is an enthralling experience that has a complete story narration that is just as exhilarating as the music. In the latest installment, ‘Xenoplanetary’, Ruptured World goes all out to provide one of the best listening experiences ever recorded and – in my opinion – the best chapter of the Planetary series. The music, which is completely captivating and full of trance-induced emotions, plays on loop until the listener is completely entrapped. Then, the haunting narrations of Alistair Rennie will send you spiting into an otherworldly experience like no other. Tracks like “The Cruel Darkness” and “The Daze Of Foreboding” are so good, they’ve remained on repeat since the album was released in January.\n\n1. God Body Disconnect – The Weight Of Regression\n\nGod Body Disconnect is one of the most consistent artist on the Cryo Chamber label and whereas his albums has mostly a dystopian feel to them, I find myself drawn in by the simple (and sparse) narrations that provide a huge amount to expression to each release. However, ‘The Weight Of Regression’ is a monumental achievement in multiple ways and this seventy six minute endeavor is my favorite Dark Ambient album of 2023. Not only are the dreamy synths still present throughout, but the addition of percussion instruments provides a Dark Noir texture which ultimately emits a potent sound that is highly addictive. “Remnants Of A Soldier” is almost like a Post-Rock track that hypnotizes for over eleven minutes, while “Dosed And Dreaming” is one of the most calming experiences on the entire album. All in all, there is a lot of variety on this album that gives it the ability to remain fresh and relevant for a long time to come.\n\nThe first time I heard Skuggkonungen, it was an instant gratification to these ears. A masterful blend of my favorite musical genres to include Dungeon Synth, Dark Ambient and Berlin School, this kindred fusion of Medieval resolve produces an output of top notch synth music that is really impressive and warming to listen to. I recently had the opportunity to communicate with the entity behind the project and found a humble, yet engaging dude that loves making music. Heres what he had to say:\n\n1. I really appreciate this interview opportunity and Happy New Year to you. How’s 2023 going so far?\n\nLikewise! Thank you! So far it´s going pretty good! Me and my wife spent New years eve in a cabin in the countryside with some friends. How was yours?\n\n2. It was time we’ll spent with family, thanks for asking. I’m always interested in learning about an artists beginnings. How did you learn of Dungeon Synth and what made you want to play this style of music?\n\nI was always kind of aware of it. I heard about Mortiis when i was a young ultra-TRVE teenage metalhead, but i was not at all interested in electronic music at that point, it was far later that i “noticed” DS. I got really interested in it in 2019/2020 when i was dming a lot of fantasy ttrpgs, it was the perfect music to have in the background, or just when writing or just chilling out. I´ve played in punk and metal bands since i was 13 and later “discovered” electronic music, and started making it myself when i was 16-17. I was drawn to the aspect of making music yourself without other people, not needing to compromise which im sure that everyone who has ever been in a band will know all about.\n\nI think what drew me to try and make it myself was just experimentation. That´s how i usually learn how to do things, by trying out a specific genre, or technique like: “Hmm i wonder if i could make a techno track, let´s try”. One of the things that drew me towards it was the sense of DIY, especially the culture of releasing on tapes. I have a unhealthy obsession with cassette tapes haha.\n\n3. Your first album, ‘Det Glömda Landet’ has a lot of Dark Ambient textures. Is that another genre of music that influenced your brand of Dungeon Synth?\n\nI´m a bit ashamed to say that i have ZERO experience with dark ambient haha. I´ve surely enjoyed some dark ambient artists/bands but I could not tell you like a single band/artist name im afraid! Det glömda landet was as you probably know inspired by a ttrpg campaign I ran for my wife and some friends, so I was mostly trying to capture the feeling of that setting (which is so amazing, please check out Forbidden lands) and the vibe of the characters.\n\n4. Where you going for a particular theme with this collection of songs?\n\nThe campaign that we played focused a lot on an ancient demon slowly gaining power in the region that the players were in, so I tried to capture that vibe of impennding doom. Two of the players were Orcs belonging to basically a death cult so that was a theme I tried to incorporate as well. I wanted to make a tribute to the campaign and to my players, something that they could listen to and remember those game sessions.\n\n5. On ‘Västmarken’, I notice a shift in ethereal soundscapes, was this in an attempt to expand your overall sound?\n\nI actually wrote most of Västmarken before Det glömda landet, but I remember trying to make something more ambient and not so melody driven. I have a modular synth that I remember using a lot on those sessions. Im a very lazy musician and I try to be very cautious of just doing the same thing over and over again, so I try and make music in very different ways and I think Västmarken is a perfect example of that, just trying a different approach.\n\n6. I love how dreamy this album sounds and it seems to embody a particular celestial spirit. What is the meaning of this album for you?\n\nI recorded most of Västmarken in the late summer of 2021, and I remember playing a lot of Skyrim and Stardew Valley on my switch at that time and I definetly think that influenced the sound of it! I think it reflects on that period of late summer, autumn is slowly creeping in, in sweden the late summer and early autumn is kind of a very somber, or bittersweet time. It gets very dark and cold, but in the same time it´s very beautiful. I enjoy that time very much and i wanted to capture that feeling i think.\n\n7. My introduction to this project was the amazing release, ‘Månens Vidunderliga Kraft’ and again, it shifts toward a very minimalistic vibe. What was the influence for this recording?\n\nMånens vidunderliga kraft was the first Skuggkonungen music I ever recorded actually! I sent it off to a couple of labels, I was expecting rejection but hopefully someone would give me some constructive feedback so I was kind of amazed when Voices of the Ainur wanted to release it! So I think the minimalism of it was mostly due to me not knowing how to write “Dungeon synth”! The phrase “Månens vidunderliga kraft” was something that came to me when I was working night shifts at my job. It translates roughly to: “The wondrous power of the moon”, I thought there was something powerful about that sentence. It´s like an incantation in a way, or a warning. Beware the wondrous power of the moon. I always like to start with something in that vein when I start a new project, a phrase, word or vibe that will go on throughout all the album.\n\n8. The title track for that album has such enlightening harmonies. What instruments did you use to record that song?\n\nThank you! I´m pretty sure the main melody is a electric piano patch on my Korg volca FM, I also used an access virus TI Snow for the pad, and the Korg Minilogue for other chords and melodies. The Minilogue in particular is one of those synths that I’ve used on all Skuggkonungen releases.\n\n9. As you may know, ‘Dar Skuggor Aldrig Bleknar’ was included in my Top 10 Dungeon Synth albums of 2022. What does the title mean (In English) and what was your focus for these icy cold songs?\n\nAnd I’m so thankful for that! I was kind of amazed when I saw it! Där Skuggor aldrig bleknar translates (roughly) to: Where shadows never pales”. The concept was sort of a place where the veil between the living and the dead were very thin, a place where shadows never pales, where no one is ever truly gone or there. The inspiration for that actually came from the Lucio Fulci movie “The Beyond”, I wont spoil it but if you´ve seen it, you´ll know…It also came from negative experiences with my last job. My line of work can be very hard emotionally and I really felt like a lot of the anxiety and dread that I was carrying around went into that album.\n\n10. The title track has a Berlin School influence – which is one of my favorite synth styles. Could you see yourself doing a Berlin School-styled project?\n\nIt´s one of my favorite styles as well! I think I’m leaning pretty heavily into Berlin school, sometimes I think to myself that I’m not even a “Dungeon synth artist” anymore haha. But I love that most people in this scene is actually very cool with artists expanding and experimenting with other genres inside the DS “sphere” if you will.\n\n11. Your latest album, ‘Analoga Ritualer’ has a heavy use of Berlin School sequences but the base music form is almost like a return to your earlier albums. How did this album come together?\n\nI think that it´s a combination of me listening to a lot of tangerine dream and trying to experimenting and trying to refine my own sound. It´s hard to define your own voice in a way, and that was something i was definetly aware of when making that album, and that reflects in the name: “Analogue rituals”, I’m trying to conjure up my own music. I usually write my music in “Manic episodes”. No Skuggkonungen album has taken more than two weeks to write and record. I wanted to capture that in that particular album.\n\n12. Of all the albums you’ve released, which is your favorite?\n\nIm very fond of Det glömda landet. Mostly because of the memories attached to it. But all of my releases has a sentimental value for me.\n\n13. How has the feedback been from your fans on the output of these albums?\n\nI’m not sure actually haha. I love getting feedback but I suffer from intense shyness and a pretty bad self-confidence so I get kind of embarrassed when people compliment my music. Dont get me wrong: I’m very proud of my music and the success I’ve had but i always kind of feel like one of these days people are going to go: “Wait a minute, his music is shit”. This is a very swedish way of seeing things haha. We have something called “Jantelagen” which is a swedish mentality of: “Dont think you´re better than anyone”. It´s kind of hardwired into almost all swedes. A perfect example of this is this: Everytime I send music to a label I think: “They are probably going to reject me and tell me not to quit my day job”. On the flipside it kind of keeps you humble I guess.\n\n14. What are your recording plans for 2023 and are there any additional surprises in store for us?\n\nI’m becoming a Father in March so I’m not sure how music I will actually be able to make but I got a lot of music done that I’m looking to sign! I got a very special release with a “big” label in the pipeline but im not sure how much I can talk about it, so i´ll leave it at that haha. Im very interested in working with some labels I’ve released with in the past so hopefully that will work out! At the moment I’m gearing up to record a full-on Berlin school EP based upon the concept of Ancient astronauts and Erich Von Dänikens interesting (but full of bullshit takes) book “Chariot of the gods”. I’ve also played around a lot with my old gameboy so I have a lot of “chiptune Dungeon synth” that I don’t know what to do with haha. AND as a last surprise..: I recently started working on a follow-up or sequel if you will to Det glömda landet, based on the new West marches style Forbidden lands campaign I’m running!\n\n15. Again, I appreciate the opportunity for this Interview and most of all, the wonderful music. Do you have any final words for those that may be reading this interview?\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be interviewed and for supporting my music, I really appreciate it alot! Keep buying tapes and if you want to support my music directly be sure to check out my bandcamp. And thank you to all the nice people who are saying nice things about my music!\n\nSkuggkonungen Links:\n\nBC: https://skuggkonungen.bandcamp.com/music\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/skuggkonungen?igshid=NDk5N2NlZjQ=\n\nOne thing that is really unique about the artists on the Cryo Chamber Label, is that they all have their signature sound that distinguishes them amongst their label mates. Tineidae brings a fresh, exciting sound that is perceptible in several ways. For one, there is an invigorating fusion of Berlin School, trance, and other facets of electronic music that create a futuristic sea of emotion. There is also an abrupt sense of dystopian landscapes that are crushing in every way. That being said, Tineidae has become a premier up-and-coming Dark Ambient artist that you won’t want to miss. I had a chance to catch up with the rhapsodic producer to find out more about this exhilarating project, it’s beginnings and what the future holds.\n\n1. I really appreciate this interview opportunity. Tineidae has already released a few really impressive albums on the mighty Cryo Chamber label. How did that relationship come to be?\n\nHey and thanks for the questions! Cryo Chamber is a bunch of creative people with quite a specific aesthetic, that I myself dig. I liked some of the older stuff of Atrium Carceri released in Cold Meat Industry era (in fact that was one of the first dark ambient projects I have enjoyed listening to). Naturally after some time I had a change in the sound of the project that seemed to be fitting. So as per usual, I looked up Cryo Chamber demo policy and sent in my demo (which was EXO at that time). It was a gradual development and there was communication going on between Simon and me, but in the end he quite liked it and so EXO was set to be released through Cryo Chamber.\n\n2. ‘Exo’, released in 2020, had such a massive, dystopian sound – which perfectly matched the times of the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Did you explore a lot of Dark Ambient tones or situational events when coming up with your signature sound?\n\nAh man, it’s hard 😀 I’ll be honest, I don’t really remember what led me to it. It’s just more bass-heavy ambient, I guess. I wasn’t really aiming at something specific, as most part of it I think was created still when pandemic wasn’t a thing. But yeah, it played nicely together, esp. that I like heavier and darker feel in music in general.\n\n3. You impressively blend in subtle bits of Berlin School and Trance. What are some of your influences for the Tineidae project?\n\nFunny that you mention trance, and actually you’re quite on point 🙂 For Berlin School electronica part, I think most of it comes from the time when i was a kid and my parents and i liked to listen to a lot of 80s electronica on cassetes or vinyls. And for trance, yeah, all the supersaw trance of 2000, but also later post-industrial stuff (aggrotech, rhythmic noise, dark-electro etc.) were all heavily focusing on synth leads with that trance-like feel and that is the kind of music that i like to this day. I just like catchy melodies i guess.\n\n4. Before Tineidae, were you involved with other musical ventures?\n\nThere were some, yes, fortunately none of those are on the Internet anymore (or at least I hope so). At around 2007-2008 when I was quite under influence of post-industrial (and esp. goth industrial on peak of its popularity), there was one project where together with another guy we were making music (something akin to aggrotech) and I was on vocals. It was fun, there even were some local gigs, but ultimately I stopped enjoying it after a few years. Later on there were two other bands (some black, some death metal) where I tried as a vocalist, but I think I attended a few practice sessions at most and didn’t really feel like it was my thing.\n\n5. Since you mentioned Black and Death metal, do you there there is a parallel between extreme metal and Dark Ambient music?\n\nOh absolutely. Someone was asking me on discord some time ago about what it feels like to release stuff on Cryo Chamber and be part of its roster, and I was joking that it often feels like a chill-room for tired metalheads, as a lot of artists are or were involved in different kinds of extreme music.\n\n6. Earlier this year, we saw the release of ‘Mothership’ which greatly expanded on the ‘Exo’ sound. What was the process like going into producing this album?\n\nIt was indeed an attempt to expand the setup and have some more bits of lore here and there suggested by the track names. The sound turned to be a bit more aggressive (at least now when i listen and compare, i feel like it is), unintntionally, likely again due to the heavier influence of industrial and other dark electronica i’m into lately. We’re not done yet tho 🙂\n\n7. What kind of world/dimension do you want your listeners to experience when listening to your work?\n\nI don’t like to have things overly specific, as this way every listener has their own story in mind that unravels with each album. For me personally it is a story of distant future where people drift through space living aboard huge motherships, harvesting resources from the planet’s atmosphere, discovering new habitats and lifeforms.\n\n8. “Behind The Seal” is my favorite track from ‘Mothership’. There are so many explorations in this track that make it stand out amongst the others. What was your vision for this particular track?\n\nFor people who are still living on the planet’s surface, Mothership is more of a mystery, they only see its lights slowly drifting in the night sky every once in a while, knowing nothing about what’s actually happening inside. As the album is retold from a point of view of a new recruit who comes aboard the mothership, it is that moment of unveiling the greatest mystery of his life (as no one ever returns back from the Mothership).\n\n9. In terms of the equipment that you use for recording, did anything change between albums or did you use the same gear? Can you describe what your recording setup is like?\n\nThe setup is rather minimal – field recordings are done with good old Zoom h2n, some sounds come out of Roland JD-XI, some from a bass guitar meticulously tortured by different exciters, but like 95% is in the box (VST synthesizers and effects, samples etc.). Actually i think i even got the whole process of making at least one of the tracks during live-streams (uploaded to my youtube now), and that one was 100% in the box (okay maybe some odd field-recordings or other noises from “outside” sources, but that’s about it).\n\n10. Going back to ‘Mothership’, another track that I find truly impressive is “Manufacturing Facility”. The dynamics of that track is so massive and the sampling sequences are quite mesmerizing. Do you approach each track with a particular idea or do you build a story and find ways to connect each track?\n\nThanks, yeah that’s a neat track. Usually there is a rough idea it all starts with and there are different approaches to try and implement it, sometimes it takes a good bunch of attempts to get somewhere. In this particular case it all started with a sound design session, which means, i just get some sound source and try to destroy it with a variety of effects, modulations and what not, all while recording it. Then a resampling comes into play, where I pick the parts that I like the most and do another bunch of processing and mangling and modulations and what not. The process continues till I arrive at something that feels particularly close to what I have in mind, or if not I may restart it from scratch. In this case I had a bunch of “best picks” from one of such sessions, that sounded quite mechanical to me. At that time I already had an idea of a space inside the Mothership that would be some sort of a factory or a refinery unit, so all these things pretty much started falling into their places after some time spent arranging and playing with moods and melodies. In other tracks I sometimes start with melodies instead, and continue developing ideas with more focus on melodies, but resampling and sound design usually still find there way in.\n\nFor the second question, I tend to have an idea first and at least try to lead the sound that way (it doesn’t always work tho and sometimes music just starts living on its own, which isn’t bad either)\n\n11. Most recently, you released a collaboration album with Drifting In Silence called ‘Simulation’. How did this partnership come about?\n\nDerrick has found me on facebook and IG some time after ‘Slowly Drown In Static’ was released. at that point I haven’t heard his music yet, we had some chats about music in general, he’s just a cool human being who happens to have a similar taste in music. At some point we started discussing the possibility of a collaborative release, and yeah he had some amazing ideas and so he was more like leading the way and we started working on it (slowly, with some breaks at least on my end due to IRL stuff and having several other projects ongoing at the same time – bad time management skill, simply put).\n\n12. Musically, both Drifting In Silence and Tineidae are sonically different, yet the combination of these projects work quite well. How did the two of you collaborate on the actual song building?\n\nAs I mentioned, Derrick had some really good ideas, and some jams and drones recorded in his studio – those were a starting point. Some tracks were in my opinion pretty much ready, so i probably added just a bit of flavor, and others we worked on different layers, sometimes adding sometimes taking out things, or even splitting and rearranging some of the longer tracks giving them different feel and texture. There was quite a bit of experimentation and trusting the gut feeling so to speak on my end, but i feel like for the most part those experiments turned out pretty good.\n\n13. Do you have any plans to collaborate with other artists in the future?\n\nI love collaborations, really, often to the point that I start too many and have hard time finishing any of those in a timely manner. And so this year several of those came out and some yet to come out at the end of this year, and there are still several ongoing and I can’t wait to share more info about those when they’re more fleshed out.\n\n14. Speaking of collaborations, I just realized that you took part in last years’ annual Cryo Chamber Lovecraft release, ‘Dagon’. What was that experience like?\n\nThe whole collab is akin to a big brainstorm process, but in musical terms – all artists have some ideas and generate sounds and drones that are fitting the narrative or overall atmosphere,and then those are used as building blocks to form a bigger picture. It’s a pretty cool opportunity, esp. for a more sound-design-driven approach (as not everything has to be a drone or a melody), and you get a chance to focus on the fine details of each sound as much as you want to. Also limited sound pool lets you find different ways for implementing creative decisions as some of the sounds may be out of your “comfort zone” and you have to figure out how to make it work the way you want it to.\n\n15. When not creating music yourself, who are some other artists (any genre) that you enjoy listening to?\n\nWithout a specific order or priority: Access to Arasaka, Sole Massif, 0 0 0, Belief Defect, X1-Y2, LORN, Cresil, REZZ, Tzafu, Swarm Intelligence, Maenad Veyl, Swarm Intelligence, Braden Koksal, Filmmaker, Jim Kimchi, meii, Prox.Bleep, Carpenter Brut, Sierra, Restive Plaggona, Pact Infernal, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and stuff in that vein.\n\n16. If not done so already, are there plans to bring Tineidae to a live setting?\n\nLikely the other way around (at least for now) 🙂 Back in the days of Tympanik Audio, I had some live shows and performances here and there. Currently with all the stuff happening IRL I doubt I’ll be able to properly prepare for live events, so instead i’d rather focus on production more and stream the process for anyone finding any helpful info in it.\n\n17. Again, I truly appreciate your time and most of all, the fantastic music that you produce. Do you have any final thought for your fans or anyone else that may be reading this article?\n\nThank you so much for the questions, and you’re very kind. Stay true to yourself, put the most effort into what makes you feel complete or fulfilled, make your dreams into goals and plan on how to realistically achieve them (if possible of course), and most importantly try to keep your physical and mental health in check.

Whether it’s a darkened forest in a horror movie, or the ruffling of leaves in an evening breeze that has us looking over our shoulders for something creepy, trees create a space of frightening imagination with limitless potential for purpose. For Halloween, trees portray a gruesome shadow in the night that causes goosebumps and chills when not expected. Remember the tree in the original Poltergeist film? They also create a blockade for hiding behind so that you can jump out and scare your friends while trick or treating. Whatever the case may be, trees serve more of a purpose than the ecology for their existence. Like trees, music provides the same escape by enticing an imaginative spark for which you can escape from reality. That’s exactly the case for these twelve chilling albums. They are the soundtrack for the season and so much more. Please enjoy these summary reviews and show your support for these artists by downloading their killer albums. Happy Halloween!! 🎃\n\n1. Lamp & Dagger – This Tape Is Haunted Too!\n\nLamp & Dagger is back with their second spooktacular collaboration, featuring a handful of ominous artists that aim to frighten your very existence. From Sombre Arcane’s psychedelic massacre to a modicum of Dark Ambient soundscapes from The Night Keep that feature morbid field recordings and samples. FVRFVR offers a chip tune spectacle that is part crypt hop and part nostalgic cinema. Whispering Mirror offers a droning canticle full of gruesome modulations, while Halm conjures up some disgusting field recordings to create a gruesome scene of terror. The final track by Spectral Manse proposes a climactic ending with eerie narrations, malevolent haunts and lots of dark melody that penetrates deep in the psyche, proving that the sequel is just as damning as the original offer. I’ll never get enough of these compilations so I’m already looking forward to Halloween 2023.\n\n2. Guild Of Lore – Night Of Halloween\n\nDungeon synth stalwart, Guild Of Lore, steps beyond the realm of Winterstead, leaving behind the Medieval intonations to embrace a world of 80’s-influenced synthwave with elements of cinematic horror. The results are a fascinating blend of B-horror movie anthems full of ghoulish field recordings, theatrical samples and rhythmic patterns that scream the elements of classic horror film soundtracks. “Lurking In The Shadows” is a prime example of ample beats, darkwave undertones, and retrospective synths, while “The Festivities” is done in the style of a skit, with spooky narrations, haunting screams and bleak atmospherics. This is an album that’s not just enjoyable during All Hallows’ Eve, but can provide eerie entertainment throughout the year, and for many years to come.\n\n3. Erythrite Throne – A Shade Of Melancholy In The Shadow Of Death\n\nIf your not listening to Erythrite Throne on All Hallows’ Eve, then you’re either very much afraid or have already been bitten by a post-apocalyptic zombie. In the case of the latter, perhaps ‘A Shade Of Melancholy In The Shadows Of Death’ has become the perpetual soundscape for your existence. Expertly fusing classical synth tones and the occasional blasts of tasty percussion, this is another magnum opus from the master of Dungeon Synth music. Just as the title suggests, this album is a bit more lugubrious than other Erythrite Throne albums, but that’s what makes this project so special. Especially on Halloween, this is some classically creepy music to enjoy on this malevolent night.\n\n4. Aleksis Tristan Shaw – Crooked Teeth\n\nThe ever so cleaver Aleksis Tristan Shaw once again keeps us on our toes with a musical endeavor that defies genre categorization but is presented just in time for Halloween. These three tracks showcase beautiful, yet twisted piano melodies with a dreamy, atmospheric production. Just as the album cover suggests, I can only imagine a blurry figure sitting behind the ivories and playing these dirges to conjure up the spirits of ancient past, allowing them to provide frights once again. Although each track is different, they each have a thematic element that maintains a dark but elegant mood. A full album of these ghastly sounds would be awesome as well.\n\n5. Wodenwyrd – The Teutoburg Massacre\n\nWodenwyrd presents a rather unique recording as a short narrative is read over obscure backing tracks that fusses Dungeon Synth, Dark Ambient and synthwave. Read over a series of Acts (seven in all), the story summarizes the first battle between German forces and the Roman Empire around 9 AD. As compelling as the story is, the music fits perfectly and produces a brooding gray background for a malevolent narrative. There are three stand alone tracks that serve as an intro, intermission and outro and they explore more nostalgic territories such as 80’s cinema and dreamy effects. In all, this is a fantastic album and I wouldn’t mind having a series of recordings in this style.\n\n6. Born From Pain – Begotten (1989)\n\nJust in time for Halloween, Born From Pain delivers another compelling motion picture re-score. This time, 1989’s horror/fantasy film, ‘Begotten’, becomes the object of creativity as the quest for Dark Ambient obscurity reigns supreme. Over seventy two minutes of ethereal order becomes the pallet for rediscovering this film in a more sinister light. The film itself, is supremely bleak and a boldly obscure statement for cinema at the time of its release. If your a fan of cult filmmaker, Maya Deren, then you’ll have a good understanding of this film. As for the music, Born From Pain masterfully captures that essence with gloomy soundscapes and haunting effects that will lead to nightmarish outcomes in itself. Another fascinating adventure that I can’t recommend enough.\n\n7. Scott Lawlor – The Livestream Series, Volume V\n\nScott Lawlor, the king of spatial Drone music and a jack-of-all-trades Ambient musician that never stops working and has enough released material to create the soundtrack to your very existence for years on end. On Halloween of last year, he produced a five hour livestream special that will be digitally released on Halloween this year. Spanning eleven tracks, this colossal of an album, flows like a never ending experiment through celestial voids and dark passages, as enigmatic effects combine with baneful textures to create the realm you’ve always dared to travel through. Each track presents a malefic journey through dark regions of the subconscious, bringing a terrorized reality to the forefront of the mind. Good luck getting through all five hours of this but enjoy the breathtaking adventure along the way.\n\n8. Orcchasm – OrcChasm!\n\nOrcchasm is truly unique experience, as we encounter a variety of musical intonations during this thirty one minute endeavor. From creepy ambience and whimsical synths to bazaar arrangements and nonstop frills, this is a musical adventure that is equally enjoyable and fulfilling. From grandiose, Medieval incantations to light, flute fills, you never know what direction the music is headed. However, hold on to your witches hat and broomsticks because this is a venture that won’t want to miss. Each track flows seamlessly into the next, showcasing a story of dark dungeons and numerous escapades. “Groping For Wild Hogs In The Dark Paphian Abyss” is my favorite track and it truly represents the musical prowess of this album as a whole. Don’t pass up on this warm journey into the wildly unknown.\n\n9. Pumpkin Witch – The Return Of The Pumpkin Witch\n\nIt’s been a few years since we’ve heard from Halloween favorite, Pumpkin Witch. However, after finally rising from the Orange tomb of seasonal vegetation, they’ve returned with their most enigmatic spectacle to date, ‘The Return Of The Pumpkin Witch’. Eleven spooky anthems that provide an audial bludgeoning for almost forty four minutes, these progressive haunts are just what the doctor (or vampire or serial killer) has ordered to infiltrate your Halloween playlists. From distorted, doom-laden guitar tones and retrospective drum beats to hair raising electro sequences and synthwave tactics, this is the album that checks all the blocks for horrifying entertainment. Tape hisses and reverberated production efforts create a sinister ambiance that drives the mail in the coffin (no pun intended) for this masterful recording.\n\n10. Ammothea – My God Is The Moon\n\nAmmothea, the ambient-infused post metal project by Glacial Anatomy, is truly a riveting encounter that satisfies the pallet of those that enjoy the multi-genre experience. Soft, careening vocals, doom metal riffing and dreamy production yields a hypnotic effect, so that you can sit back, close your eyes and indulge in your own trip. These five tracks disperse almost sixty four minutes of playing time but, it’s over before you know it due to being completely lost in the mix of these alluring intonations. “Depth” and “My God Is The Moon” are standout tracks that incorporate a more upbeat approach without diverting away from the haunting gray that the entire album discharges. This is an extremely impressive release and I’m already looking forward to more from this artist.\n\n11. Whöreplay – Whöreplay\n\nA good dark wave tune goes hand in hand with the Halloween season, given its close ties to Gothic romanticism, vampires and grim landscapes. It also has provided bleak, atmospheric backdrops for scenes in classic horror films such as ‘Silence Of The Lambs’. This two track spectacle from newcomer, Whöreplay, fits right in with all of the aforementioned. Although only five minutes long, the artists wastes no time setting the listener on a collision course with haunting electronics, reverberated vocals, and a dreamy production. These tracks slice through like a jagged dagger, leaving a spot of coagulated blood for the creatures of the night to feast on.\n\n12. Unsheathed Glory/Ozeregroth – Nights Shadow Darkening\n\nThere is no better time to come together for delivering a darkened dungeon synth experience than Halloween. Unsheathed Glory and Ozeregroth combine their talents of Medieval summonings to render a five track split album, culminating in twenty four minutes of effortless canticles set to the gloomiest night of the year. Not only does each artist produce two tracks of their own, but they collaborate on the daunting self title track. Although each artist delivers contrasting tones, they mesh together very well and and flow transparently with ominous accord. This is one of my favorite Dungeon Synth collaborations of the year and I hope these artist get together again in the future, to produce more music like this.\n\nAdditional forest photos courtesy of Carlton Whittle Photography.
