        "text": "This one is for an emergency, Tanu was saying. It's an enlarger, doubles my height, makes me big enough to wrestle an ogre. The ingredients for enlargers are extremely hard to come by. I've only got one dose, and once I use it, I don't expect to own another. Shrinking is easier. Each of these little vials carries a dose that makes me eight times shorter. I\n\nend up just under ten inches tall. Not so helpful in a brawl, but not bad for sneaking around.\n\nCoulter and Vanessa sat on opposite ends of an antique sofa. Dale was perched on a stool he had brought in from another room. Grandma wheeled in Grandpa and took a seat in the last armchair.\n\nGrandpa cleared his throat. Tanu fell silent, returning his potions to his pouch. Getting to the point, we probably have a traitor among us, so I thought we should talk this through.\n\nNobody spoke. Kendra made brief eye contact with\n\nVanessa, then with Coulter, then with Tanu. Ruth and I are fairly certain how Olloch got onto the property, Grandpa continued. Somebody signed him in on the register within208 the past two days. He probably waltzed right through thefront gate. And he didn't come alone.\n\nWhat's the register? Kendra asked.\n\nThe register is a book that controls access to\n\nFablehaven, Grandma said. When you come to visit, we write your name in the register, and that action disarms on your behalf the spells guarding the gate. Unless they were signed in on the register, it would be effectively impossible for anyone to get past the fence.\n\nSomebody signed in Olloch? Dale asked.\n\n-- Advertisement --\n\nBetween now and two evenings ago, the last time we checked the register, someone signed in Christopher Vogel and Guest, Grandma said. We blotted out the names, but the damage has been done. Christopher Vogel, whoever that is, came onto the property and turned Olloch loose.\n\nTherefore we must assume we have two enemies out there, Grandpa said, motioning toward the window. And one in here.\n\nCould somebody from outside have gotten to the register?\n\nDale asked.\n\nThe register was hidden in our room, Grandma said.\n\nOnly Stan and I knew where it was. Or so we thought. Now we've moved it. But coming into the house unnoticed after we shut it down for the night is almost as difficult as getting through the gates. Let alone writing in the register right under our noses.\n\nWhoever wrote in the register is more than likely the same person who released the drumants, Grandpa said. Is209 it possible that somebody outside this room accessed ourbedrooms twice? Yes. Probable? No.\n\nCan we trace the handwriting? Coulter asked.\n\nGrandma shook her head. They used a stencil.\n\nApparently they weren't in a rush.\n\nPerhaps all of us should leave, Tanu suggested. The evidence is too glaring to ignore. Kendra and Seth are above suspicion, as are Ruth and Stan. Maybe the rest of us should depart.\n\nThe thought crossed my mind, Grandpa said. But now that we have two foes on the preserve, it is hardly a good time to send away our protectors, even if one is probably a traitor. At least until we can summon replacements.\n\nI am stuck in this chair, and the children are young and untrained. The situation is maddening. As I consider each of you individually, you seem above suspicion. Yet someone wrote in the register, and since you all appear equally innocent, you consequently appear equally guilty.\n\nI hope we find another explanation, Grandma said.\n\nFor the moment, we must acknowledge the likelihood that one of us is a master deceiver working for our adversaries.\n\nIt gets worse, Grandpa said. The phone lines are down again. We've been trying to summon aid via Vanessa's cell phone, but our chief contact has not been answering.\n\nWe will keep calling, but none of this bodes well.\n\nThe other immediate problem is Olloch himself,\n\nGrandma said. As he gorges himself on whatever edible matter he can find, he will continue to gain both size and\n\nPower. He quit trying to enter the yard hours ago, which210 means he realizes that if he gets big enough, he could gainsufficient power to overthrow the treaty, access the house, and claim his prize.\n\nLike how Bahumat almost overthrew the preserve last year, Kendra said.\n\nYes, Grandpa said. Olloch could conceivably muster sufficient power to plunge Fablehaven into lawless chaos.\n\nKendra glanced at Seth, sitting silently. She had rarely seen him so quiet and contrite. It looked like he wanted to melt away into the love seat and vanish.\n\nWhat can we do? Tanu asked.\n\nOlloch the Glutton will not stop until he has devoured and digested Seth, Grandpa said. Slaying Olloch is well beyond our power. We have an ally who suggested there might be a way to subdue the demon, but we have not been able to reach him. The glutton has already reached a size that will allow him to ingest just about whatever he chooses, and his appetite will not abate. We cannot sit idly by. Our peril is literally growing by the minute.\n\nWe must assume our benefactor is on the move,\n\nGrandma said. He is a heavily desired target of the Society.\n\nWe'll keep trying to telephone him, and assume that he'll make himself available as soon as he can. Otherwise, we're just not sure how to find him. He moves too frequently.\n\nHow long before Olloch becomes strong enough to countermand the treaty? Vanessa asked.\n\nGrandpa shrugged. With the kind of game he can find inside Fablehaven, magical and nonmagical, it is a worst-case scenario. He'll grow much faster than he would out in211 the normal world. He must have had help getting to his currentsize, probably from that Christopher Vogel character.\n\nMy best guess? A day, more likely two, maybe three. I can't imagine it would take much longer.\n\nMaybe you should just feed me to him, Seth said.\n\nDon't talk nonsense, Grandma said.\n\nSeth stood up. Wouldn't it be better than letting\n\nOlloch destroy all of Fablehaven? Sounds like he'll get me sooner or later. Why should I make him go through all of you first?\n\nWe'll find another way, Coulter said. We still have some time.\n\nHe'll have to eat me to get to you, Dale said.\n\nWhether you like it or not.\n\nSeth sat down. Grandpa pointed at him. Now is not the time to leap to rash solutions. We have not yet spoken with our most knowledgeable ally. Seth, I repeat, you are not culpable for awakening Olloch. You were tricked and are not to blame. You should not have been out in the woods alone ----\n\nthat was a most foolish error in judgment, the exact kind of nonsense I hoped you would have abandoned by now-but you are far from deserving a death sentence. Since the satyrs were involved, I take it you were trading for batteries? I\n\nhaven't asked, what did they give you?\n\nSeth lowered his eyes. Some gold.\n\nMay I see it?\n\nSeth went and retrieved his emergency kit. He pulled out the gold bar. Grandpa examined it. You do not want to be caught out in the open with this in your pocket, he said.212 Why? Seth asked.Grandpa handed the bar back to Seth. It was clearly stolen from Nero's hoard. What did you suppose the 'N'\n\nstood for? He will be scrying for it in his seeing stone. In fact, the presence of the gold could grant him the power to see within the walls of our home. The satyrs must have only recently stolen it, or Nero would have already reclaimed it.\n\nSeth placed a hand over his eyes and shook his head.\n\nWhen will I do something right? he moaned. Should I go chuck it into the woods?\n\nNo, Grandpa said. You should go set it on the porch, and we'll return it to its rightful owner as soon as reasonably possible.\n\nNodding sheepishly, Seth exited the room. We also have some encouraging news, Grandpa said. Coulter made an important breakthrough today. We may be close to uncovering the relic we have been seeking. The latest revelation harmonizes with the information we already possess.\n\nAt this juncture, I believe there is more wisdom in sharing this information openly than in hiding it. No matter which of us is the traitor, the rest of us must continue functioning.\n\nBetter we make our knowledge common than become paralyzed.\n\nNot that the traitor will be sharing secrets with us,\n\nVanessa said bitterly.\n\nAll the same, Coulter will disclose his discovery,\n\nGrandpa said.\n\nThe fog giant Burlox reported that Warren was213 investigating the four hills area before he turned white,Coulter said.\n\nOne of the main areas Patton mentioned suspiciously,\n\nVanessa said.\n\nAnd the same area I investigated today, Tanu said.\n\nThe grove on the north end of the valley is definitely cursed. I did not risk treading there.\n\nSeth came back into the room and reclaimed his spot on the love seat.\n\nMany areas of Fablehaven carry terrible curses and are protected by ghastly fiends, Grandpa said. The valley of the four hills is one of the most infamous. At the moment, the evidence seems to suggest a pair of related mysteries. We may very well find not only that the grove contains the relic we have been seeking, but also that it is guarded by whatever entity transformed Warren.\n\nOf course, all that would need to be confirmed,\n\nGrandma said.\n\nCarefully, Grandpa admonished. As with several of the most dread regions of Fablehaven, we have no idea what evil haunts the grove.\n\nWhat is our next move? Vanessa asked.\n\nI say we need to focus on Olloch before we try to penetrate whatever secrets lie inside the grove, Grandpa said.\n\nExploring the grove safely will require all of our resources and focus. Even under ideal circumstances it is a hazardous assignment.\n\n'So we wait to see if Ruth can reach your contact?\n\nCoulter asked.214 Grandpa was picking at the frayed edge of his cast.Ruth will keep calling on Vanessa's cell phone. For now, the rest of us should try to get a good night's sleep. It may be our last chance for a while.\n\nKendra closed the bathroom door, locked it, and set the sheet of paper on the counter. She had found the blank paper beneath her pillow, but with Seth in the room, she dared not light the candle and give away her secret. Alone in the bathroom, Kendra struck a flimsy match and put the flame to the wick until it caught. Shaking out the match, she watched as glowing words came into view on the formerly empty page:\n\nKendra,\n\nSorry we didn't get to talk much today. Can you believe all the commotion? We need to keep your brother on a leash!\n\nLetme know if thismessagecame through all right.\n\nYour friend,\n\nVanessa\n\nKendra blew out the candle, and the luminous words vanished. Folding up the note, she climbed the stairs to the attic bedroom, pondering how she should reply to the secret message. Seth was setting up toy soldiers on the floor. One in front, with two behind him, then a row of three, and another of four. Kendra crossed the room and climbed into215 bed. Seth walked several paces away and bowled at the soldierswith a softball. He knocked down seven.\n\nTurn off the light and come to bed, Kendra said.\n\nI don't think I can sleep, Seth protested, retrieving the softball.\n\nI know I can't with you rolling balls around the room,\n\nKendra said.\n\nWhy don't you go sleep someplace else?\n\nThis is where they put us.\n\nAt home we each have our own room. Here, with way more rooms, we sleep in the same one. He rolled the softball again, claiming two more soldiers.\n\nThis isn't the sort of place I'd want to sleep alone,\n\nKendra admitted.\n\nI can't believe they took my gold, Seth said, setting up the soldiers again, this time placing them closer together. I\n\nbet it was worth thousands of dollars. It isn't my fault if\n\nNewel and Doren stole it from Nero.\n\nYou can't just do whatever you want and always get away with it.\n\nI've been good! I've tried hard to be careful and keep secrets and follow all the rules.\n\nYou went into the woods without permission, Kendra reminded him.\n\nJust a little ways. It would have been fine if somebody hadn't let that demon onto the preserve. Nobody saw that coming. If Olloch hadn't caught up with me today, he might have caught up with us tomorrow, when we were out with\n\nVanessa, a lot farther from the house. I might have saved our216lives. He rolled the ball again. Missing the front soldier, hestill knocked down eight.\n\nWay to avoid taking any responsibility, Kendra said, leaning back onto her pillow. I'm glad they grounded you. If it were up to me, I'd lock you in the dungeon\n\nIf it were up to me, I'd give your face plastic surgery, he said.\n\nReally mature.\n\nDo you think they'll figure out a way to stop the demon? Seth asked.\n\nI'm sure they'll think of something. The Sphinx seems really smart. He'll have a plan.\n\nHe said you beat him at Foosball, Seth said.\n\nHe wasn't too good He didn't even spin his cowboys\n\nShaking his head, Seth bowled the ball again and picked up the spare I don't think Nero could follow me off the preserve. Maybe I should just take the gold and go. Then everyone will be out of danger.\n\nStop pitying yourself.\n\nI'm serious.\n\nNo you're not, Kendra said, exasperated. If you take off, Olloch will hunt you down and eat you.\n\nBetter than having everyone hate me.\n\nNobody hates you. They just want you to be cautious, so you'll be safe. The only reason they get mad is because they care about you.\n\nSeth arranged the soldiers in the tightest formation yet.\n\nThink I can knock them all down with one roll?217 Kendra sat up. Of course, you set them up like dominoes.Seth took his position and rolled the ball, totally missing all of them. Looks like you were wrong.\n\nYou missed on purpose.\n\nI bet you couldn't knock all of them down.\n\nI could easily, Kendra said.\n\nProve it.\n\nShe got out of bed, grabbed the ball, and went and stood by her brother. Taking careful aim, she bowled it hard, right down the center, and all the soldiers fell. See?\n\nAlmost like I let you win.\n\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nNothing, he said. Who do you think is the traitor?\n\nI don't know. It doesn't seem like any of them.\n\nMy guess would be Tanu. He's too nice.\n\nAnd that makes him evil? Kendra asked, getting back into bed."
