        "text": "In this sequel to 'Fablehaven', Kendra and Seth are faced with more magical dilemmas. A goblin appears in Kendra's class, Seth gets bitten by some sort of demon, and they can't get a hold of their grandfather. Soon they are whisked back to Fablehaven - but are they any safer there? Not only do they have enemies wishing to penetrate the preserve, but soon they realize that there is an enemy from within, too.\n\nI was not quite as enchanted by this book as I was by its precursor. I did like the imaginative creatures and situations introduced in it, as well as appearances by some familiar things from the first book. The characters did not seem as fleshed out as in the first, which was disappointing. However, it was still a fun, fresh adventure and I will definitely pick up the third book. A good read, but not great. If you liked the first, you will probably like this one as well."
