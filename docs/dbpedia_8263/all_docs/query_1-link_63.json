Grandpa Sorenson, the caretaker, invites three specialists — a potion master, a magical relics collector, and a mystical creature trapper — to help protect the property from the Society of the Evening Star, an ancient organization determined to infiltrate the preserve and steal a hidden artifact of great power. Time is running out. The Evening Star is storming the gates. If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the downfall of other preserves and possibly the world. Will Kendra learn to use her fairy gifts in time? Will Seth stay out of trouble? Can they overcome paralyzing fear? Find out in Book 2 of this bestselling series.\n\nThe Fablehaven series has been awarded the Mormon Letters Award, the Nevada Young Readers’ Award and Tennessee’s Volunteer State Book Award, was a finalist for Lambda Literary Award, and has been nominated for the Rebecca Caudill Young Reader’s Book Award, Hawaii’s Nene Award, New Mexico’s Land of Enchantment Book Award, the Indian Paintbrush Book Award, Colorado’s Children's Book Award, Wyoming’s Soaring Eagle Book, and the Pacific Northwest Young Reader's Choice Award.\n\nDeseret Book"
