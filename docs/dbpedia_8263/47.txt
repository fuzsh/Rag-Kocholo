Fablehaven #2 Rise of the Evening Star by Brandon Mull

(Summary taken from the back of the book) “At the end of the school year Kendra and her brother, Seth, find themselves racing back to Fablehaven, a refuge for mythical and magical creatures. Grandpa Sorenson invites three specialists–a potion master, a collector of magical relics, and a trapper of mystical creatures–to help protect the property from the Society of the Evening Star, an ancient orgainization determined to steal a hidden artifact of great power. Time is running out. If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the downfall of other preserves and possibly the world.”

I liked this book a lot more than I liked the first one. I think it seemed more “real,” if that’s possible. It caught my attention more. There are still some corny parts, but overall I liked it. It’s a good, easy read that is entertaining and good when you just want a fun book. It is fairly well written and has some good twists and turns. The last page brings a surprise, even though I had thought about the possibility of it while reading. I like the characters and the story. It is good, clean fun. There is some gore and some scarier scenes, but there is no language and no “physical intimacy.”

Rating: PG There is some gore and might be scary for littler children.

Recommendation: 1st grade and up, if being read to. If reading alone probably 2nd or 3rd grade. My 2nd grader wants to read it. It may be a little too difficult for him, but I think I’ll let him try. I think I’ll read it aloud though.
