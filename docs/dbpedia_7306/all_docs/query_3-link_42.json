        "text": "David Gilmour Might Not Play Roger Waters-Era Pink Floyd Songs at Future Shows\n\nDavid Gilmour is full of news lately, especially after announcing his first new album in nine years last week.\n\nTo begin with, the guitar icon announced six upcoming shows at London’s Royal Albert Hall. According to his website, these shows are his first live gigs in London in eight years. They will take place October 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 and will go on sale to the general public on Friday, May 10 at 10 AM BST via Ticketmaster.\n\nHowever, it appears these shows may not feature Gilmour playing some of Pink Floyd’s biggest songs. He told Uncut (h/t Neptune Pink Floyd) in a new interview that he has “an unwillingness to revisit the Pink Floyd of the ‘70s.”\n\nFurthermore, Gilmour expressed he’s more likely to revisit Pink Floyd material from the ’60s, 1987’s A Momentary Lapse of Reason and 1994’s The Division Bell. Gilmour particularly singled out the later album’s closing track, “High Hopes,” which he called “as good as anything we ever did at any time.”\n\nOf course, Gilmour’s resistance to playing ’70s-era Pink Floyd songs may have to do with his ongoing feud with Roger Waters, who was Floyd’s primary creative force during that time. This war of words has also included Gilmour’s wife and longtime collaborator, Polly Sampson.\n\nDetails on David Gilmour’s New Album\n\nGilmour’s new album, Luck and Strange, comes out on September 6. A full tracklist is below, and the album is available for pre-order in a variety of formats at DavidGilmour.com.\n\nThe album announcement states Luck and Strange was recorded during a five-month period and produced by Gilmour and Charlie Andrew. Gilmour said of working with Andrew, “He’s very direct and not in any way overawed, and I love that. That is just so good for me because the last thing you want is people just deferring to you.”\n\nAs expected, lyrics were written by Polly Samson, Gilmour’s wife and collaborator for the past three decades. The overall theme of the album addresses growing older and how mortality is often top of mind as someone ages.\n\nA number of musicians are featured on Luck and Strange, but Pink Floyd fans will be thrilled to find out the late keyboardist Richard Wright can be heard on the album’s title track. Wright’s recording is from a jam session in a barn on Gilmour’s residential property back in 2007.\n\nThe album’s first video for “The Piper’s Call” can be seen below.\n\nDavid Gilmour – Luck and Strange – Tracklisting\n\nBlack Cat\n\nLuck and Strange\n\nThe Piper’s Call\n\nA Single Spark\n\nVita Brevis\n\nBetween Two Points (With Romany Gilmour)\n\nDark and Velvet Nights\n\nSings\n\nScattered\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
