        "text": "During the year of 1979, I was a student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, getting a Bachelor’s Degree in Communication Arts. While at JMU, I worked part-time at Public Radio station WMRA 90.7 FM, that served the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nWhen I wasn’t attending classes or working at WMRA, I would spend my spare time listening to other radio stations that I could pick up in Harrisonburg. Most of my radio surfing was concentrated either on Top 40 outlets or album-oriented rock (AOR) stations.\n\nWith this music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be my favorite top 40 hits from 1979. My selections are 45-rpm singles that I treasured while a JMU student, and I still love these songs today.\n\nSince I started my radio career at legendary Top 40 WROV 1240 AM Roanoke in 1974, I was drawn to listening to any radio station that featured top 40 radio during my JMU student years.\n\nMy time in Harrisonburg gave me an opportunity to hear various Top 40 stations on any given day. The local Top 40 station that JMU students could pick up on campus was WQPO (Q101) 100.7 FM in Harrisonburg.\n\nI was not a fan of Q101 as it was automated with no live DJs. I preferred tuning in WWWV 97.5 FM (3WV) in Charlottesville as they were an AOR formatted station. Plus, 3WV had an excellent morning show and live DJ staff throughout the broadcast day.\n\nTo get my fix of Top 40 radio while I was at JMU, I would listen to stations out of Richmond and Washington DC radio markets. Picking up these stations tended to be hit or miss, depending on the weather conditions. Cloudy days seemed to be the best opportunity to hear these signals coming in strong at my Harrisonburg home.\n\nBelow are the Top 40 radio signals that I could pick up on a regular basis in Harrisonburg during 1979:\n\nWRVQ (Q94) 94.5 FM Richmond\n\nWPGC 95.5 FM Washington DC Market\n\nWRQX (Q107) 107.3 FM Washington DC Market\n\nAs a side note: Top 40 K92 92.3 FM Roanoke came on the air January 1, 1980. Between New Year’s Day and my JMU graduation in May 1980, I would listen to K92 on a regular basis in Harrisonburg.\n\nAfter sundown, I would also listen to a couple of high-powered 50,000 watt AM stations: WLS 890 AM Chicago and WABC 770 AM New York. Those stations always had top-notch DJs playing the hits. On the Big 89 WLS, my favorite DJs were Jeff Davis, Larry Lujack and John Records Landecker.\n\nFor the rest of this message, I will be counting down my favorite Top 25 singles from 45 years ago. The sole criterion I utilized with song tabulation for the countdown is simple: I used Billboard’s “Year-End Hot 100 singles chart for 1979.”\n\nAs I surveyed the prominent 1979 hits, the countdown is entirely based on my opinions. The songs that I selected are singles that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nFor a historical reference, below are the top 15 singles of 1979, according to Billboard magazine:\n\n1 “My Sharona” The Knack\n\n2 “Bad Girls” Donna Summer\n\n3 “Le Freak” Chic\n\n4 “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy?” Rod Stewart\n\n5 “Reunited” Peaches & Herb\n\n6 “I Will Survive” Gloria Gaynor\n\n7 “Hot Stuff” Donna Summer\n\n8 “Y.M.C.A.” Village People\n\n9 “Ring My Bell” Anita Ward\n\n10 “Sad Eyes” Robert John\n\n11 “Too Much Heaven” Bee Gees\n\n12 “MacArthur Park” Donna Summer\n\n13 “When You’re in Love with a Beautiful Woman” Dr. Hook\n\n14 “Makin’ It” David Naughton\n\n15 “Fire” The Pointer Sisters\n\nBefore I start my countdown, I want to share some of my favorite top 40 singles from 45 years ago that were not ranked by Billboard on their 1979 Top 100 year-end chart.\n\nLet’s Go—The Cars\n\nCruel to Be Kind—Nick Lowe\n\nCrazy Love—Poco\n\nBlow Away—George Harrison\n\nRoxanne—The Police\n\nLove Takes Time—Orleans\n\nDriver’s Seat—Sniff ‘N’ the Tears\n\nServe Somebody—Bob Dylan\n\nBlue Morning, Blue Day—Foreigner\n\nHeart of the Night—Poco\n\nGet It Right Next Time—Gerry Rafferty\n\nSong on the Radio—Al Stewart\n\nPeople of the South Wind—Kansas\n\nMorning Dance—Spyro Gyra\n\nTake Me to the River—Talking Heads\n\nNext are songs that I considered for the countdown but fell just outside of my top 25. These selections are not ranked and are placed in a random order:\n\nLady—Little River Band\n\nGold—John Stewart\n\nNew York Groove—Ace Frehley\n\nA Little More Love—Olivia Newton John\n\nFire—The Pointer Sisters\n\nReunited—Peaches & Herb\n\nThe Devil Went Down to Georgia—The Charlie Daniels Band\n\nI Want You to Want Me—Cheap Trick\n\nStrange Way—Firefall\n\nDouble Vision—Foreigner\n\nDance the Night Away—Van Halen\n\nThe Gambler–Kenny Rogers\n\nJust When I Needed You Most—Randy VanWarmer\n\nLotta Love—Nicolette Larson\n\nPromises—Eric Clapton\n\nI Was Made for Loving You—Kiss\n\nShake It—Ian Matthews\n\nI Just Fall in Love Again–Anne Murray\n\nChuck E’s in Love—Rickie Lee Jones\n\nStumblin’ In—Suzi Quatro & Chris Norman\n\nMusic Box Dancer–Frank Mills\n\nI Just Wanna Stop—Gino Vannelli\n\nShe Believes in Me–Kenny Rogers\n\nShine a Little Love—Electric Light Orchestra\n\nGot to Be Real—Cheryl Lynn\n\nTragedy—The Bee Gees\n\nShake Your Groove Thing—Peaches & Herb\n\nWe Are Family—Sister Sledge\n\nAin’t No Stoppin’ Us Now—McFadden & Whitehead\n\nGoodnight Tonight—Paul McCartney & Wings\n\nWithout further ado, my stellar singles of 1979 countdown begins:\n\n25. I Will Survive—Gloria Gaynor\n\nPeak positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 6th Biggest Song of 1979\n\nLyrics have become an anthem for female empowerment. Inducted into Library of Congress National Recording Registry in 2016. “I Will Survive” received a Grammy Award for “Best Disco Recording.”\n\n24.

I completely understand that my listing of songs in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent 1979 singles, your tabulation may be totally different. What do you consider to be best preeminent singles from ’79? I hope you will comment below.\n\nI have passionate memories of my college years at JMU and hearing my favorite songs played on the radio during 1979. I still cherish and fondly remember the excellent music of 45 years ago. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nWhen I think about core instruments in pop rock music, there is one that doesn’t fit into that category: a flute. While this woodwind may be more at home with orchestras, the breezy sound of flutes was an integral part on many top 40 hits during the 20th century.\n\nWith this music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be my favorite songs featuring a flute. My selections are mostly tunes that I treasured when I was a teenager or as a young adult and I still love these songs in 2024.\n\nMy listing of fantastic flute songs all became hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the golden age of top 40 radio. Obviously, that means that outstanding ensembles, classical masterworks, and any other genre of music outside of pop, rock and soul, are excluded from this article.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I used to narrow down my listing of outstanding flute songs:\n\nMy selections were aired on Top 40 radio between the years 1966 and 1976.\n\nOnly songs released as 45-rpm singles are listed.\n\nNo album tracks used on countdown.\n\nFlute needs to be prominently heard in a song.\n\nLead flute solos on instrumental breaks on songs with lyrical singing.\n\nCountdown songs peaked at #40 or higher on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThere are many top 40 songs that employ flutes as part of their musical mix but the instrument doesn’t standout. A good example of this is the Beatles’ song “Penny Lane.”\n\nThis tune features oboes, piccolos, trumpets and a flugelhorn, as well as traditional pop instruments of piano, guitar, bass and drums. Thus, the flute sound is not distinguishable on this masterpiece song by the Beatles.\n\nAnd since my countdown only spans from 1966 through 1976, excellent 80s flute singles won’t be listed on this message. If I had chosen music from the totally tubular decade of the 80s, I surely would have included the 1982 Men at Work song “Down Under” as a superb flute single.\n\nAs I surveyed the prominent flute hits, the countdown is entirely based on my opinions. My selections are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nBefore I start the countdown, I am sharing some other first-class flute singles in a couple of different categories. I am a fan of all of the extra songs that didn’t make my favorite flute songs all-time listing.\n\nSongs played on Top 40 and AOR (album-oriented-radio) stations but not released as 45-rpm singles:\n\nMoondance—Van Morrison\n\nAqualung—Jethro Tull\n\nSo Long, Frank Lloyd Wright—Simon & Garfunkel\n\n45-rpm singles that charted number 41 or lower on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\n\nLocomotive Breath—Jethro Tull\n\nWhite Bird—It’s a Beautiful Day\n\nCan’t You See—The Marshal Tucker Band\n\nThis next group are songs that I considered for the flute countdown but fell outside of my top 20 selections.

I am grateful that Jerry encouraged me to watch “The Greatest Night in Pop” film last month and I highly recommend viewing this outstanding documentary.\n\nWhile I won’t be giving a review of “The Greatest Night in Pop” movie, I will be sharing about certain aspects of the film, the recording of “We Are the World”, and the songs significance in modern music history.\n\nI also will be communicating what I consider to be the best 1980s singles by 15 of the artists who had solo vocal lines within the 1985 charity song. Every song that I will be listing was a major pop hit during the 80s.\n\n“We Are the World” was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, with Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian producing the song which was recorded by a supergroup of pop artists called USA for Africa.\n\nAccording to “The Greatest Night in Pop” documentary, over 40 pop artists assembled at A&M Recording Studios in Hollywood, California, to record final vocal tracks for the “We Are the World” song.\n\nMichael Jackson arrived first for this historic musical event around 8:00 pm. Soon after scores of other artists came on the scene, with many coming directly from the American Music Awards happening that evening, including the host of the annual music ceremony Lionel Richie.\n\nAround 10:30 pm, Quincy Jones gathered the vocal artists and musicians together to start the recording process. This assembled multitude worked throughout the night during their marathon recording session completing the final audiotape at 8:00 am.\n\nSix weeks later on March 7, 1985, “We Are the World” was released as a single. The song was an immediate hit: Reaching number 1 on three Billboard charts: R&B Singles chart, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks listing and the Hot 100 Pop singles survey, where it spent 4 weeks at the top spot.\n\nAfter “We Are the World” was released, it was honored by multiple music awards. In 1986, the song achieved 4 Grammy Awards. The single also received awards by MTV for its music video, a People’s Choice Award and an American Music Award.\n\nThe original inspiration for artists to come together and record a song for African famine relief came from Harry Bellafonte. He is quoted on the USA for Africa website about the lasting effect of the “We Are the World” single:\n\n“In 1985, the music industry and the world came together in an unprecedented outpouring of generosity in response to the tragic famine wreaking havoc in Africa at the time. The biggest names in music ‘checked their egos at the door’ to create what was and still is a worldwide phenomenon.”\n\nBellafonte continues: “The recording of the original We Are the World sold more than 7 million records worldwide. The worldwide sale of that record generated more than $60 million which has been used to assist Africa and Africans affected by the famine and other critical issues since 1985. The song became and remains the people’s anthem and continues to be revered and loved globally.”\n\nBelow are artists who sang solo parts on the “We Are the World” song:\n\nLionel Richie\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nPaul Simon,\n\nKenny Rogers,\n\nJames Ingram\n\nTina Turner\n\nBilly Joel\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nDiana Ross,\n\nDionne Warwick\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nAl Jarreau\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nKenny Loggins\n\nSteve Perry\n\nDaryl Hall\n\nHuey Lewis\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nKim Carnes\n\nBob Dylan\n\nRay Charles\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will convey what I consider to be the best and most memorable 80s pop hits, by 15 of the artists who had solo parts on the “We Are the World” recording. The songs that I have selected were all major top 40 singles from 1980 through 1989.\n\nThe top 15 songs and artists that I have picked are entirely based on my opinions. My selections are singles that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nIn researching historical musical data for this article, I used “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn for documentation. The placement of singles on the countdown derives solely on my favorability of songs and not on how I rate each of the artists listed.\n\nNow without further ado, here is my countdown of 15 outstanding singles from “We Are the World” singers:\n\n15. That’s What Friends Are For—Dionne Warwick: 1985\n\nPositions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, The #1 biggest single of 1986\n\nThat’s What Friends Are For” was written by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager and was recorded as a charity single for AIDS research and prevention.

I completely understand that my listing of 80s singles in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent 80s pop hits by the same artists, your tabulation may be totally different. What do you consider to be the best singles by the “We Are the World” pop stars? I hope you will comment below.\n\nIn closing, I must ask this question: Is the recording in late January 1985 of “We Are the World” the greatest night in pop? Obviously, the answer to this query is debatable.\n\nI will say that the assembly of over 40 artists for “We Are the World” has to be considered the greatest gathering ever of pop music superstars with the recording of this historic session. It may never be duplicated again.\n\nWill there ever be another version of fundraising similar to what pop artists did with “We Are the World” in 1985? I am hoping that type of event will happen this century.

In some other trios, keyboards are substituted for either a guitar or a drum set.\n\nAt the same time that instruments are being played by all members, one or more of those same individuals will provide singing on songs that have vocals. These bands tend to have a full, rich sound with just three members.\n\nThe fresh electric sounds of British Invasion bands in the mid 60s such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who, gave inspiration to those wanting to play that type of music with just 3 musicians. Soon thereafter, many new rock trio bands started forming in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nAs I did research for the topic of rock trio bands, I realized there were other types of musical groups with just 3 members. I classify these artists as vocal pop groups, that featured 3 singers that didn’t play musical instruments.\n\nBelow are some outstanding 3-person vocal groups from the 60s and 70s. These trios performed in a variety of musical genres from pop, rock, folk and soul.\n\nThe Supremes\n\nThree Dog Night\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nPeter Paul and Mary\n\nThe Isley Brothers\n\nMartha and the Vandellas\n\nWhile all of the above 3-person vocal groups produced excellent music, they are not power trio rock bands and have been excluded from consideration on my countdown. Maybe I will write and publish a separate article on outstanding 60s and 70s trio vocal groups in the future? Stay tuned.\n\nHere are the criteria I used in compiling my countdown of best rock trio bands:\n\nMajority of album chart success between the years of 1965 and 1985.\n\nSince my home country is in America, my rankings are based solely on what bands achieved in the United States.\n\nIn researching historical musical data for this article, I used Billboard and Cash Box magazines for documentation.\n\nI also gathered artist information from the liner notes of vinyl albums that I still own in 2024.\n\nBands received significant airplay on Top 40 and Album Oriented Rock (AOR) radio in the U.S. from mid 60s through to the mid 80s.\n\nSome groups listed in countdown may have had more than 3 members at some point but stayed as a trio during a majority of the band’s existence.\n\nI will document main members of trio bands and may leave out part time personnel and/or people in a band whom stayed for short periods of time.\n\nPlease note that my ranking of albums and songs within the countdown of best rock trio bands is entirely based on my own opinion. My rating system reflects directly upon music that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nWithout further ado, my countdown of the ten best trio rock bands begins:\n\n10. James Gang\n\nMain Lineup: Joe Walsh (guitars, lead vocals), Dale Peters (bass) and Jim Fox (drums). Widely acclaimed album: “James Gang Rides Again.” My #1 top-rated song: “Walk Away.” Second favorite track: “Funk #49.”\n\nActive years as a trio: 1968-1974.

The CSN trio contributed outstanding vocal harmonies and all were first-rate singer-songwriters.\n\n2.

I completely understand that my listing of songs and albums in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent trio rock bands, your tabulation may be totally different.

Billboard magazine lists that 60 percent of the Hot 100 singles that charted 40 years ago were in the pop rock category.\n\nWith my latest music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be my favorite singles and videos that MTV aired during 1983.\n\nThe genesis of pop music’s explosion in the 80s goes back to the demise of disco music being aired on Top 40 stations. In lieu of playing disco hits, radio playlists consisted of mainly pop, rock, easy listening ballads and country crossover singles.\n\nIn my hometown of Roanoke, Virginia, K92 FM 92.3 was the number 1 rated radio station. This hot, hip and happening Top 40 outlet remained the biggest and most listened to station throughout the 80s decade. Below is an audio clip of K92’s David Lee Michaels from July 1981.\n\nElsewhere in the early 80s, many top 40 programmers and consultants rebranded their stations with a new format name: “Contemporary Hit Radio” (CHR). Most of these CHR outlets were on the FM dial.\n\nDuring 1981, radio consultant Mike Joseph was hired by WCAU FM Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to set a new tone for that radio station. Joseph created the “Hot Hits” radio format for WCAU and is credited as revitalizing CHR/Top 40 radio for FM stations in the 80s.\n\nOne of the DJs on WCAU FM was Terry Young, who began his career in 1973 working at WROV 1240 AM Roanoke. Below is an audio clip of Young on WCAU FM in 1983, provided by Ellis Feaster via YouTube.\n\n1983 also saw the launch of CHR Z100 New York. This legendary radio station was programmed by DJ Scott Shannon and went from “worst to first” with ratings in just 60 days. I am sharing an audio clip of Shannon on Z100’s third day on the air, August 4, 1983. Aircheck provided by Ellis Feaster via YouTube.\n\nThe rise of pop music can also be attributed to the advent of airing music video clips on cable TV. Music Television (MTV) debuted on August 1, 1981 and MTV totally revolutionized how music was heard and seen by folks in the United States.\n\nDuring the first 18 months of MTV, the cable music channel aired an “Album Oriented Rock” (AOR) format. One of the chief criticisms of MTV during this time period was the lack of music videos by Black artists being played on the cable music channel.\n\nIt wasn’t until March 1983, that Michael Jackson’s video for “Billie Jean” was added and became the first video by a Black artist to be aired in heavy rotation on MTV. In my humble opinion, Jackson’s “Billie Jean” clip is the number one best and most influential music video that MTV aired during the first two years in operation.\n\nSoon after, MTV added “Little Red Corvette” by Prince into its hot rotation. Then “Beat It” by Michael Jackson and “1999” from Prince were regularly aired on MTV. Finally Black music had a place on the cable music channel.\n\nProbably the most renowned video that MTV played in 1983 was from the “King of Pop” Michael Jackson and his single “Thriller.” This clip was released during the fall of ‘83 and set the standard for well-produced music videos during the 80s decade.\n\nOther influential video clips aired on MTV during 1983:\n\nHungry like the Wolf—Duran Duran\n\nRio—Duran Duran\n\nEvery Breathe You Take—The Police\n\nKing of Pain—The Police\n\nSweet Dreams (Are Made of This)—The Eurythmics\n\nTotal Eclipse of the Heart—Bonnie Tyler\n\nSharp Dressed Man—ZZ Top\n\nModern Love—David Bowie\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will be counting down what I consider to be the best CHR singles of 1983. The countdown is entirely based on my opinions. My selections are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nIn researching 1983 historical musical data for this article, I used 3 sources: Billboard and Cash Box magazines, along with MTV, for documentation.\n\nBefore staring the countdown, below are 1983 singles that I consider to be excellent songs but fell outside my top 25 selections. These selections are not ranked and are placed in a random order:\n\nDer Kommissar—After the Fire\n\nThe Safety Dance—Men Without Hats\n\nToo Shy—Kajagoogoo\n\nJeopardy—The Greg Kihn Band\n\nShe Works Hard for the Money—Donna Summer\n\nStraight from the Heart—Bryan Adams\n\nI Know There’s Something Going On—Frida\n\n99 Luftballons—Nena\n\nShock the Money—Peter Gabriel\n\nPhotograph—Def Leppard\n\nBack on the Chain Gang—The Pretenders\n\nOur House—Madness\n\nLawyers in Love—Jackson Browne\n\nHeart to Heart—Kenny Loggins\n\nRock the Casbah—The Clash\n\nCome Dancing—The Kinks\n\nBreaking Us in Two—Joe Jackson\n\nYou Got Lucky—Tom Pretty & the Heartbreakers\n\nManeater— Daryl Hall & John Oates\n\nManiac—Michael Sembello\n\nElectric Avenue—Eddie Grant\n\nTell Her About It—Billy Joel\n\nIslands in the Stream—Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton\n\n(Keep Feeling) Fascination—The Human League\n\nTrue—Spandau Ballet\n\nWithout further ado, my quality 1983 CHR singles countdown begins:\n\n25.

The lyrics for this song are credited to all four members of the Irish band.\n\nThe “New Year’s Day” single was the first track from U2’s 1983 “War” album. Subject matter of the song was inspired by the Polish Solidarity movement of the early 80s.\n\nMusically, it features a distinctive bassline by Adam Clayton, melodic piano and guitar playing from the Edge, superb drumming by Larry Mullen Jr. and strong, heartfelt vocals from Bono.\n\nWithout a doubt, I proclaim that “New Year’s Day” as my favorite U2 song of all-time. And the band’s first single to chart in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100, is my number 1 best CHR single of 1983.\n\nThat wraps up what I consider to be my favorite and best top CHR hits for 1983. I completely understand that my listing of songs in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent 1983 singles, your tabulation may be totally different. What do you consider to be best preeminent singles from ’83? I hope you will comment below.\n\nListening to music on CHR radio and watching music video clips from MTV during 1983, will always have a special place in my heart. I still cherish and fondly remember the excellent music of 40 years ago.

If I asked the above inquiry to 100 folks, I would surely receive one hundred different responses.\n\nWith my latest music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be my favorite Top 40 singles of 1972.\n\nI have fond memories of listening to Top 40 radio in ’72 as I turned 17 years old that year in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\nDuring daylight hours, I exclusively listened to Roanoke’s legendary WROV 1240 AM. This station featured a Top 40 format and was the number one top-ranked radio outlet in my city.\n\nBart Prater and Larry Bly were my two favorite WROV DJs 51 years ago. I also remember hearing DJs Ron Tompkins, Charlie Bell and Phil Beckman on the station nicknamed the “Rock of Roanoke” back during 1972.\n\nLink above: Larry Bly and Bart Prater aircheck on WROV Roanoke in October 1972. Courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett\n\nWhen WROV reduced power at sundown, I would listen to 3 top 40 AM radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home.\n\nAfter sundown, I would tune into three 50,000-watt clear channel AM stations: WLS 890 AM Chicago, WCFL 1000 AM (Super CFL) Chicago and WABC 770 AM New York.\n\nFor my countdown of ’72 superfine singles, I consulted two sources in my calculation of the biggest records in this category: Billboard and Cash Box magazines’ year-end top 100 singles charts for 1972.\n\nAs I surveyed the prominent hits from 1972, the countdown is entirely based on my opinions.

Go All the Way—The Raspberries\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #5 Hot 100, 33rd Biggest Song of 1972\n\nThis tune starts off kicking: Blazing guitars, infectious guitar riff and catchy hooks.

American Pie—Don McLean\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1972: #1 Hot 100: 3rd Biggest Song of Year\n\nI consider “American Pie” as the second-best epic story song from the golden age of top 40 radio. Lyrics proclaim “The day the music died” as a 1959 plane crash that killed rock artists Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens. Don McLean explores cultural changes within rock ‘n roll, proclaiming philosophical angst, disillusionment and disappointment with rock music created after the tragic event of 2/3/59.\n\n8.

The opening line on this song is a reference to a 19th Century Van Gogh painting, ‘The Starry Night’. Tune is among the most melodic top 40 hits during 1972.\n\n5. Day After Day—Badfinger\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #4 Hot 100, 39th Biggest Song of 1972\n\nWritten by Peter Ham of Badfinger and single was the biggest hit for the band.

Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)—Looking Glass\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1972: #1 Hot 100: 12th Biggest Song of Year\n\nElliot Lurie of Looking Glass has an engaging story: Brandy works in a seaport harbor town as a barmaid and the man she loves is a sailor. Unfortunately for Brandy, the seaman is never in port and honestly declared to her before leaving for the last time: “But my life, my lover and my lady is the sea.”\n\n“Brandy” is favorite song for my immediate family and we will always sing this classic song whenever hearing it played on the radio. This Looking Glass sing-a-along single is one of my all-time favorite hits from the early to mid 70s.\n\n1. Nights in White Satin—The Moody Blues\n\nPeak positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100, 32nd Biggest Song of 1972\n\nMy top selection on this countdown is “Nights in White Satin” by the Moody Blues. Written by frontman and guitarist Justin Hayward, it is the biggest selling single by the British progressive rock band.\n\nOriginally released as a single from the album “Days of Future Passed” in 1967, the song didn’t chart in the U.S. and was only a minor hit in the U.K. Five years later in 1972, “Nights in White Satin” was reissued as a single and became a world-wide smash.\n\nMusical backup on the track was provided by the London Festival Orchestra and gave the tune a unique sound, quite different from most hits during early to mid 70s on top 40 radio. Over the years, the song has achieved critical acclaim and is considered by many as a progressive rock masterpiece.\n\nWithout a doubt, I proclaim “Nights in White Satin” is my third favorite song of all-time and the Moody Blues hit is my number one best top 40 single of 1972.\n\nThat wraps up what I consider to be my favorite and best top 40 hits for 1972. I completely understand that my listing of songs in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent 1972 hits, your tabulation may be totally different. What do you consider to be best preeminent singles from ’72? I hope you will comment below.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart.
