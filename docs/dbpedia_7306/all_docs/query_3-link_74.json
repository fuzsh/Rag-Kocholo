        "text": "A new book titled Everything Under the Sun – The Complete Guide to Pink Floyd, set to be published on August 29th, promises to be the definitive account of the career of rock’s most devastatingly emotional and articulate band. Author Mike Cormack takes a deep dive into the music of Pink Floyd, resulting in the first serious appraisal of the band’s immense achievements, whilst also giving an overview of the UK’s concurrent social and political history as seen through the prism of the band. In addition to a song-by-song analysis, Mike also shares exclusive band interviews, a full chronology and gig guide, and a full bootleg guide. Keep an eye out for future updates, as the publisher and author have graciously provided our team with a copy, so stay tuned for our full review!\n\nYou can order your copy here: UK | USA\n\nOut today, the third single from David Gilmour’s new album Luck and Strange, titled Dark and Velvet Nights, is a powerhouse of a tune!\n\nWritten by David Gilmour and Polly Samson, ‘Dark And Velvet Nights’ came from a poem Polly had written. David Gilmour ‘The music sprang out one day. It was so exciting to have come across this groove. Polly had given me a beautiful poem for our wedding anniversary, which was sitting on the desk right next to me, so I picked it up and sang it on the track, to hear what it would sound like with words. I played it to Polly, and she said, “Lovely, great, I’ll need to fiddle with it a bit. So she added a couple of verses, and there it was – very serendipitous.”\n\nThe single is available on all digital platforms you can watch the official music video below.\n\nDavid Gilmour - Dark and Velvet Nights (Official Music Video)\n\nScheduled for release on November 1st this year, the upcoming 11-CD box set will celebrate the 50-year solo career of Phil Manzanera, the Roxy Music guitarist, record producer, and musical collaborator. Among the highlights of this collection, Pink Floyd fans may find interest in Disc Seven’s 6PM (2004) which features David Gilmour on guitar for tracks 11 and 12. Most notably, Disc Eleven’s The Manzanera Archives RARE TWO contains the previously unreleased Pink Floyd demo titled “Demo PM 1” an early version One Slip (from 1987’s A Momentary Lapse of Reason) that Phil wrote with David Gilmour. Phil as we know is a long time friend and collaborator with David. Phil co-produced David’s albums On An Island in 2006 and Rattle That Lock in 2015, and he was also a member of his touring band during those years.\n\n50 Years of Music is beautifully presented in a 10”x10” hard-slip featuring eleven of his original albums, remastered by Alchemy Mastering’s Barry Grint at London’s renowned Air Studios and overseen by Phil. A 100-page book accompanies this extraordinary musical journey, with photos, handwritten notes, tape boxes, scribbles, clippings, alternate artwork, lyrics, compositions, thoughts as well as the original album booklets.\n\nA perfect companion to Manzanera’s critically acclaimed 2024 memoir.\n\nTracklisting:\n\nDisc One: Diamond Head (1975)\n\nFrontera\n\nDiamond Head\n\nBig Day\n\nThe Flex\n\nSame Time Next Week\n\nMiss Shapiro\n\nEast Of Echo\n\nLagrima\n\nAlma\n\nBonus Tracks\n\nCarhumba (previously released on 2011 re-issue)\n\nCorazon Y Alma (previously released on 2011 re-issue)\n\nDisc Two: Listen Now (801) (1977)\n\nListen Now\n\nFlight 19\n\nIsland\n\nLaw and Order\n\nRude Awakening\n\nQue?\n\nCity Of Light\n\nInitial Speed\n\nPostcard Love\n\nThat Falling Feeling\n\nBonus Tracks\n\nBlue Gray Uniform (Demo @ PSL Studios) (previously only available on 2015 Japanese re-issue)\n\nRemote Control (Demo @ PSL Studios Psychedelic Version) (previously only available on 2015 Japanese re-issue)\n\nIsland (Secret Fingers Remix) (previously only available on 2015 Japanese re-issue)\n\nListen Now (Velvet Season and The Hearts of Gold Remix) (previously only available on 2015 Japanese re-issue)\n\nDisc Three: K-Scope (1978)\n\nRemote Control\n\nCuban Crisis\n\nHot Spot\n\nNumbers\n\nSlow Motion TV\n\nGone Fishing\n\nN-Shift\n\nWalking Through Heavens Door\n\nYou Are Here\n\nBonus Tracks\n\nRemote Control (Live 801 Tour 1977) (previously available on 2000 reissue)\n\nIt Don’t Matter To Me (Demo @ PSL Studios Manzanera) (previously available on 2000 reissue)\n\nOut Of The Blue (Live 801 Tour 1977) (previously available on 2000 reissue)\n\nWalking Through Heaven’s Door (ZSOU Remix) (previously only available on 2015 Japanese re-issue)\n\nDisc Four: Primitive Guitars (1982)\n\nCriollo\n\nCaracus\n\nLa Nueva Ola\n\nBotaga\n\nRitmo de Los Angeles\n\nEurope 701\n\nImpossible Guitar\n\nBig Dome\n\nEurope 80-1\n\nBonus Tracks\n\nImpossible Guitars (Theo Parrish Feat.
