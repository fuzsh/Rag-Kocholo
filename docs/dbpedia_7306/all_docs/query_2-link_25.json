        "text": "Opinion\n\nPoles Apart\n\n\"Is Pink Floyd really Progressive Rock?\"\n\nA few Prog moments do not a Prog band make\n\nBefore one can answer the question of whether or not Pink Floyd are a Progressive Rock band, one must first answer the question \"What is Progressive Rock?\"\n\nThis is not as easy a question to answer as one might think. The easy answer is that Progressive Rock attempts to push the envelope of Rock. The issue gets a little cloudy when one considers that Rock has itself been sort of progressive all along. For example, Good Charlotte bear little resemblance to Chuck Berry, and yet both acts are still considered \"rock.\" This demonstrates that the genre of Rock has itself progressed over the last fifty years, though many of the constituent elements remain the same.\n\nRock, on the simplest level, is a sub-genre of Popular Music. Both genres use similar song structures, they're just applied differently. It could be said that Rock is itself a progression from Pop. Over the course of its existence, artists such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Everlast have all pushed the boundaries of Popular Music and by extension, that of Rock itself.\n\nBut are these artists \"Progressive\" in the same sense that bands such as Yes, King Crimson, and Peter Gabriel-era Genesis (to name but a few) are? No, they are not. And why is that?\n\nThe Beatles, Zeppelin, and Everlast all have at least one thing in common: a fairly rigid adherence to \"Pop\" song structures. The songs are melodic, abound with \"hooks\" and have structures that don't require massive amounts of attention to keep up with: verses lead into pre-choruses, which lead into choruses, which lead into bridges, and so on.\n\nYes, King Crimson, and early Genesis really don't stick with such formulas. Within the confine of a single piece, the music may change direction so sharply that it's almost as though a different song has slipped in.\n\nThe idea of Progressive Rock is to bring the musicianship of Classical and Jazz (among other forms) into the performance of Rock Music. In my opinion, Progressive Rock has much in common with modern Metal music; it's all really a boring display of hubris to me. Speed, agility, and complexity take precedence over melody. The epic-length song structures are a barefaced display of endurance. It becomes more about the math than about the heart.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of Progressive Rock. I've been a fan of Rush for as long as I've been a fan of Pink Floyd. But make no mistake about it, Pink Floyd are not a Progressive Rock band.\n\nPink Floyd are not about flexing their musicians' muscles; David Gilmour freely admits to being one of the laziest musicians in the world. Richard Wright, Nick Mason, and Roger Waters certainly seem to share Gilmour's \"relaxed\" attitude towards their instruments. Mason doesn't perform complex polyrhythms, Waters doesn't take solos, Wright doesn't use dissonant chords on any sort of a regular basis, and Gilmour isn't into precisely picking 64th note runs for eighty-seven measures.\n\nIn a Pink Floyd song, it seems more like a change in a song is brought about only because the band have wrung every last drop of atmosphere out of one progression and it's simply time to move on toward the chorus.\n\nSure, Pink Floyd have some very \"Progressive\" type songs in their repertoire. But they also have some \"Cock Rock\" songs there, too. Are Pink Floyd a \"Cock Rock\" band? I think not.\n\nWithin the history of Pink Floyd (at least as far as I'm familiar with it), anytime they have tried to do something that no one else has done before, it's always had to do with the staging of the show... with the lights and the props. Puppets and lasers and walls, oh my. But the music behind the spectacle is still old blues riffs and pop song structures, and there's really nothing Progressive about that.\n\nSean Ellis is a staff writer for Spare Bricks.\n\nPink Floyd is Prog, through and through\n\nI suppose I should say up front that I'm not a big fan of the Prog Rock genre, in general. But when I think of mainstream Prog, I think of early Genesis, Yes, Rush, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Jethro Tull. And, to a certain extent, Pink Floyd.\n\nTo me, Prog Rock blends elements of classical music with rock instrumentation and rhythms. The songs tend to be long, and are often broken into multiple parts. There may be several disparate sections of music woven together into a single composition. Much Prog Rock experiments with complex rhythms and shifting meters, and often pushes the limits of the musicians' technical abilities--that is to say that Prog Rock is often fast and challenging to play, with a tendency toward lengthy instrumentals. Prog Rock lyrics tend to be intellectual and 'deep', and paying homage to literary influences (especially science fiction and and/or fantasy) is not uncommon. And it is also common to weave songs or albums into complex concept works.\n\nSo how well does Pink Floyd stack up against this admittedly broad definition? First, the Floyd have always sought to expand the horizons of rock by using elements of other styles of music, from the whimsical folk of \"Scarecrow\" and \"The Gnome\" to the deliberate classical/orchestral direction they pursued in \"Atom Heart Mother\".\n\nThat the Floyd is fond of lengthy songs in multiple 'movements' is fairly evident: \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" had nine parts; \"Atom Heart Mother\" had six, and \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" is occasionally listed as four distinct sections. (\"Saucerful\" had the distinction of being the longest--and most experimental--track on the album that bore its name; at just under 13 minutes it was certainly a departure for a band whose studio output was mainly 3-minute pop songs.) \"Echoes\" began as no fewer than 24 individual musical ideas which were deftly woven into a seamless whole. And that's not to mention songs like \"Pigs on the Wing\", \"Another Brick in the Wall\", \"For the First Time Today\", and others that appropriated the proggy conceit of the multi-part song as an excuse to recycle melodies, or \"Perfect Sense\", which is split into two parts for no apparent reason. Of the four solo sections on the Ummagumma studio LP, only Waters' compositions are not broken into 'movements'.\n\nThat the Floyds are fond of instrumentals (such as \"Interstellar Overdrive\", \"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\", \"One of These Days\", \"Any Colour You Like\", and \"Marooned\", to name but a few) almost goes without saying. And the Floyd (and Roger Waters in particular) are so fond of weighty lyrics and concept projects that when rock historians mention 'concept album', two or three Pink Floyd albums are held up as some of the finest examples.\n\nThe one area of Prog Rock that the Floyds have a hard time fulfilling is the technical prowess. David Gilmour is the closest thing the Floyd has to a 'virtuoso', and even he readily admits that he isn't interested in playing fast or technically, and Roger Waters has gone so far as to admit that he has very little interest in improving his bass skills. But even the 'non-musical' Waters wrote songs in odd meters, such as the 7/4 of \"Money\" or the repeated 5/8 bars in \"Mother\". And for a time the Floyds were particularly enamored of a 12/8 triplet rhythm (heard in \"One of These Days\", part of \"Echoes\", \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part VI)\", \"Sheep\"), which is certainly a long way from Bo Diddley or \"Blue Suede Shoes\".\n\nAs a fine example of Pink Floyd's prog ambitions, have a listen to \"Dogs\". For starters, it clocks in at just over 17 minutes in length--not as long as \"Atom Heart Mother\" or \"Echoes\", which each took an entire LP side--and while it isn't divided into distinct movements, it clearly combines several different musical ideas in distinct 'feels'. Rather than a straightforward four-on-the-floor rock rhythm, it employs a highly-syncopated rhythm guitar figure that is more than a little mystifying to the average rock fan. If you can't hear the Prog influences in \"Dogs\", then maybe you can't recognize 'Prog Rock' in the first place.\n\nMike McInnis is a staff writer for Spare Bricks.\n\nWho is the strongest, who is the best?\n\nThe top ten Pink Floyd progressive rock songs\n\nWhen I think of Prog Rock, something elaborate comes to mind, such as several songs tied together with a central theme, or even one lengthy song taking up half of an album side. This depth and complexity is why albums like Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are considered two of the greatest prog rock albums of all time, despite being made up of mostly shorter pieces. Taken individually, most of the songs may not seem \"proggy\", but each album as a whole certainly is. And those two albums really should be taken in their entirety when discussing prog rock. The impact they have had in the progressive rock genre is immeasurable. Pink Floyd's influence on some prog rock bands that followed (such as Marillion, The Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater and even newer bands like Riverside) is quite obvious.\n\nIn my attempt to list my top ten Pink Floyd prog rock songs, I considered all of these factors, with special attention to complexity. For me, that's the most important ingredient in Progressive Rock. It wasn't easy, since just about every song Pink Floyd ever did (post-Syd Barrett) could be considered Progressive Rock. That said, because Progressive Rock is easily my favorite form of music, the task was quite enjoyable.\n\nJust what is progressive rock anyway? One thing is for sure, progressive rock has many ingredients. That's probably what makes it so progressive. When one thinks of prog rock, something elaborate comes to mind, such as several songs tied together with a central theme making up a whole album, or even one lengthy song taking up half of an album side. One may think prog rock is music ahead of its time. Or possibly music that constantly changes and progresses to another level each time out. There really are many different ways to define progressive rock, but the bottom line is we all know what it is.\n\nProg rock that hit its peak in the '70s with bands like Yes, King Crimson, Rush, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Camel, and Pink Floyd. For me, the main distinction between prog rock and other forms of rock is the difference between simple songs and elaborate songs. It may pertain to a whole album or to just one song. This depth and complexity is why albums like Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are considered by many to be two of the greatest prog rock albums of all time despite being made up of mostly shorter pieces. Most of the songs taken individually may not seem \"proggy\" but the album as a whole certainly is.\n\nAnd those two albums really should be taken in their entirety when discussing prog rock. The impact they have had in the genre is immeasurable. Pink Floyd's influence on prog bands that followed such as Marillion, The Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater and even newer bands like Riverside is very obvious. In my attempt to list my top ten Pink Floyd prog rock songs, I considered all of these factors, with special attention to complexity. For myself, that's the most important ingredient in the genre. It was not an easy thing to come up with this list since in reality just about every song Pink Floyd ever did, post-Syd Barrett, could be considered Progressive Rock. That said, because Progressive Rock is easily my favorite form of music the task was quite enjoyable.\n\nHere then are my Top Ten Pink Floyd Progressive Rock Songs. Apologies in advance for leaving off some sure favorites:\n\n10. \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" from A Saucerful of Secrets\n\nAfter the whimsical, psychedelic Pink Floyd sound with Syd Barrett, this was the song that got it all started for Progressive Pink Floyd and pointed them suddenly in a new direction. The idea of using charts and graphs to write the song is exactly what Prog Rock is all about. Just brilliant. As a progressive freak-out, this song was the foundation for all that followed. The live version on Ummagumma, often regarded as a progressive rock classic, shows that Pink Floyd were even far more progressive live than their reputation in the studio.\n\n9. \"Set The Controls For the Heart of the Sun\" from A Saucerful of Secrets\n\nAnother progressive rock classic, also performed on the live Ummagumma set, was the next step into the progressive rock genre for the band. Now moving in a completely different direction after the departure of Syd, this was Roger Waters' first real attempt at writing a progressive rock song. The lyrics regarding space travel were probably what propelled Pink Floyd into the progressive rock genre. Though the Barrett-penned \"Astronomy Domine\" (with its \"space\" lyrics) could certainly also be considered prog, I've always considered the studio version to be more psychedelic. But the prog roots are definitely there and it's evident on \"Set The Controls.\"\n\n8. \"The Narrow Way\" (Parts 1 - 3) from Ummagumma\n\nIn my experience, I've found this song to be Pink Floyd's most underrated prog rock epic. In truth, it's one of Pink Floyd's greatest prog rock moments. Broken into three different parts, each part so unlike the other two, the dichotomy and break between parts so stark, it's amazing how they still manage to blend together perfectly. A jump-in-your-face fade in and a stunningly jumpy acoustic solo fades quietly into a dark and hypnotic electric guitar solo, which again quietly fades out and brings us to the vocal finale. One of David Gilmour's first attempts on his own into prog rock ranks as one of his best.\n\n7. \"Main Theme\" from More\n\nThis moody instrumental piece is probably the shortest song on this list, but the progressive improvisation puts the masters of prog on full display. Even better when played live, the band extended the improvisations to make the song much longer. The centerpiece song on the album, as indicated by the title, is also the best and most progressive song on the album. It's a clear continuation of Pink Floyd's progressive rock direction after \"Saucerful\" and \"Set the Controls.\"\n\n6. \"Us and Them\" from The Dark Side of the Moon - On Dark Side, Pink Floyd pushed progressive rock to another level all on their own. This is literally where they created their own genre of music. Individually, the songs may not sound like your typical prog rock. But taken as a whole, it's prog rock at its best. So which song to choose for this list? \"Any Colour You Like\" and \"Breathe\" could easily be here instead of \"Us and Them\". But this song is just so different from anything else, to me it's the most progressive song on the album. While Richard Wright has always contended that he was mostly influenced by jazz, his music writing and playing on \"Us and Them\" shows why he will always be regarded as a progressive rock artist.\n\n5. \"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\" from Ummagumma\n\nThough driven by a simplistic bass line, the music is layered beautifully. Add in Waters' famous scream and Gilmour's frantic guitar work, and the song is another example of Pink Floyd's progressive roots. The performance of \"Axe\" in 1977 in Oakland, California is further evidence that the band is, was, and will always be a classic progressive rock band. Playing to a respectful and appreciative crowd, the band wanted to play one more song after the planned encores were finished. They chose this song, showing that they were a true progressive rock band at heart.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\"\n\n\"Fat Old Sun\"\n\n\"Obscured By Clouds\"/\"When You're In\"\n\n\"Welcome to the Machine\"\n\n\"Comfortably Numb\"\n\n\"Yet Another Movie\"\n\n4. \"Atom Heart Mother\" from Atom Heart Mother\n\nThe first real epic in the Pink Floyd catalogue, the band added the progressive touch of a symphony orchestra to accompany them. But even when they sometimes played the song live without the orchestra, it's still very progressive with the constant time changes, the soft harmonizing vocals, and the brief appearance of a farm tractor. The guitar changes from blues to funk to rock, changing the emotion of the song on a dime. Some like the song with the horns, some do not. Either way, it's pure progressive rock that takes the listener on a ride from start to finish.\n\n3. \"Dogs\" from Animals\n\nI consider \"Dogs\" a prog rock masterpiece. In 1977, when the music scene was turning towards simpler forms of music in punk and disco, the dinosaurs of prog rock released this thin piece of vinyl with basically just three songs. Yet the music is indeed up to Pink Floyd's weighty standards, proving that progressive rock was not going to fade away quietly. Taking up most of an LP side, \"Dogs\" packs one huge progressive punch. The musicianship involved, progressive brilliance from everyone, layer upon layer, is not only one of the group's highlights as a band, but individually all four members shine on their own.\n\n2. \"Echoes\" from Meddle\n\nIn my view, this is the first song anyone thinks of when discussing progressive rock and Pink Floyd. The opening, starting with the \"ping\", is pure progressive bliss. The sometimes rather annoying 'screeching whales' section in the middle of the 20-something minute epic only just removes this song from the \"Masterpiece\" category. Composed from many small segments of music, and blended into a cohesive whole, \"Echoes\" shows just how much of a progressive rock band these guys really are. Not only did the band briefly resurrect the song on the 1987 tour, David Gilmour, with Richard Wright on keyboards, still played this song on the \"On An Island\" solo tour in 2006. Progressive to this day.\n\n1. \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" Parts I-V and Parts VI-IX from Wish You Were Here\n\nSpeaking of masterpieces, simply put, the entire \"Shine On\" opus is progressive rock at its absolute best. From the lush guitar in the first half to the howling wind and driving bass on part VI, the sound throughout is rich and warm, with an amazing, atmospheric presence. I've always felt that Pink Floyd is a band that is very difficult to label--a band that created its own genre, and this song is a perfect example. Yet all the elements of progressive rock are here. And if you've ever heard \"Shine On\" live, you know that they also were able to retain that progressive genius in a live setting... and both Waters and Gilmour continue to play the song on their solo tours to this day. If we have to place Pink Floyd into any particular genre of music, it clearly has to be progressive rock, and this is some of the best.\n\nBob Cooney is a staff writer for Spare Bricks."
