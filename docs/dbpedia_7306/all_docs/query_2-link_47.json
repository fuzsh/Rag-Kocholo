        "text": "Rarely do a mere prism and spectrum of light signify so much.\n\nThe cover of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon is recognizable by all denizens of the Western world, rock fan or not. For so many, it also opens a treasure box of associations: The themes of irth and death, greed and madness, and the relentless tick-tock of time. An ecstatic vocal aria. The specter of a departed Syd Barrett. The lunatic on the grass. Money: it's a gas.\n\nAfter half a century of headphone-clad zone-outs and The Wizard of Oz re-rewatches, The Dark Side of the Moon transcends mere codification and ubiquity; it remains a work of uncommon perceptiveness, concision and ingenuity. And the arrival of a new boxed set invites listeners back through the gates of its mind-expanding, incisive, philosophical universe.\n\nRead More: 20 Albums Turning 50 In 2023: Innervisions, Dark Side Of The Moon, Catch A Fire & More\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon — 50th Anniversary Boxed Set, out Mar. 24, encompasses a lavish array of ways to re-experience this classic rock staple. The set includes CD and gatefold vinyl of the newly remastered studio album, as well as Blu-Ray/DVD audio featuring the original 5.1 mix and remastered stereo versions, as well as a diamond-sharp Atmos mix.\n\nJust as enticing is a CD and LP of The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974, which illuminates how an album that stretched the boundaries of the studio took on new dimensions on stage. When you see Roger Waters continue to stage ambitious, polemic productions across the globe, trace a line backward to Floyd's culture-shaking live show 50 years ago.\n\nTo mark the re-release of what many consider to be Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason's crowning achievement, here are five facts you may not know about The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nRoger Waters Sought Unprecedented Lyrical Clarity\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon wasn't just a leap forward aurally, or conceptually: the band had never been so vivid and specific with their words.\n\n\"I think we all thought — and Roger definitely thought — that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect,\" Gilmour told Rolling Stone in 2003, referring to past albums like Obscured by Clouds and Meddle. \"There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific. That was a big leap forward.\"\n\nThus, the band produced a work of thematic depth and concision, full of unforgettable one-liners like \"All you touch and all you see/ Is all your life will ever be\" and \"There's someone in my head/ But it's not me.\"\n\nWatch Now: Inside Pink Floyd's Progressive Masterpiece The Wall | For The Record\n\nClare Torry Was Paid Just £30 For Her Vocal Performance\n\nDespite the singer's lack of name recognition, millions and millions have heard Clare Torry's voice. Her cyclonic, wordless aria on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" — they nixed a first attempt, partly on account of the word \"baby\" — is one of the most memorable parts of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nSo it might be surprising to hear that Torry was paid a standard rate of £30 for her work — and ended up suing the band in 2004 for a songwriting credit and lost wages. (The case was settled out of court.)\n\nIt Could Have Been Called Eclipse, With The Silver Surfer On The Cover\n\nWhen a now-obscure band called Medicine Head released an album called Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd's desired title seemed under threat.\n\n\"We weren't annoyed at Medicine Head,\" Gilmour later said. \"We were annoyed because we had already thought of the title before the Medicine Head album came out.\" But when Medicine Head's album failed commercially, the door was open to proceed as planned.\n\nAnd, accordingly, while Pink Floyd desired the prismatic cover as soon as they saw it, the band had previously kicked around the idea of a Marvel superhero on the album sleeve.\n\n\"We were all into Marvel Comics, and the Silver Surfer seemed to be another fantastic singular image,\" Aubrey Power of art design group Hipgnosis remembered. \"We never would have got permission to use it. But we liked the image of a silver man, on a silver surfboard, scooting across the universe. It had mystical, mythical properties. Very cosmic, man!\"\n\nRead More: Remixing Animals: How Pink Floyd's 1977 Album Set The Stage For Melodic Metal\n\nThe Band Performed The Album In Its Entirety A Year Prior To Release\n\nThroughout 1972, the band performed a proto version of The Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics (its addendum at the time) in sequence. They also refined the song cycle as one continuous piece, with transitions at all, eventually landing on the continuum of music we know and love today.\n\nThat being said, there were significant differences in these nascent live versions — for example, \"On the Run\" was a guitar and keyboard jam, and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was hung on an organ solo, not a vocal solo.\n\nThere's A Beatles-Related Easter Egg Near The End\n\nPaul McCartney, then finishing Wings' Red Rose Speedway, was among the various interview subjects interspliced into the finished project — but as his appearance was a comedic put-on against the band's wishes, they scrapped his appearance. But that doesn't mean there's no Fabs on The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nNear the end of \"Eclipse,\" during the famous \"Matter of fact, it's all dark\" quip an orchestral version of \"Ticket to Ride\" can be faintly heard. This detail among so many others is more audible than ever in the new remaster — where the light shines through clearer than ever.\n\nWhat Does U2 Stand For? To Mark Songs Of Surrender, 6 Facts About The 22-Time GRAMMY Winners\n\nAcross 2023, we've been treated to a shower of fantastic reissues, remixes and/or expansions. From the Beatles' Red and Blue albums, to Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, to the Who's Who's Next, the list is far too massive to fit into a single article.\n\nAnd, happily, it's not over yet: from now until Christmas, there are plenty more reissues to savor — whether they be mere vinyl represses, or lavish plumbings of the source material replete with outtakes.\n\nAs you prepare your holiday shopping list, don't sleep on these 15 reissues for the fellow music fanatic in your life — or pick up a bundle for yourself!\n\nX-Ray Spex - Conscious Consumer (Vinyl Reissue)\n\nWhether you view them through the lens of Black woman power or simply their unforgettable, snarling anthems, English punks X-Ray Spex made an indelible mark with their debut 1978 album, Germfree Adolescents.\n\nSeventeen years later, they made a less-discussed reunion album, 1995's Conscious Consumer — which has been unavailable over the next 27 years. After you (re)visit Germfree Adolescents, pick up this special vinyl reissue, remastered from the original tape.\n\nThat's out Dec. 15; pre-order it here.\n\nFall Out Boy - Take This to Your Grave (20th Anniversary Edition)\n\nReleased the year before their breakthrough 2005 album From Under the Cork Tree — the one with \"Dance, Dance\" and \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" on it — Fall Out Boy's Take This to Your Grave remains notable and earwormy. The 2004 album aged rather well, and contains fan favorites like \"Dead on Arrival.\"\n\nRevisit the two-time GRAMMY nominees' Myspace-era gem with its 20th anniversary edition, which features a 36-page coffee table book and two unreleased demos: \"Colorado Song\" and \"Jakus Song.\" It's available Dec. 15.\n\nCoheed and Cambria - Live at the Starland Ballroom\n\nCoheed and Cambria is more than a long-running rock band; they're a sci-fi multimedia universe, as well as a preternaturally tight live band.\n\nProof positive of the latter is Live at the Starland Ballroom, a document of a performance at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey, in 2004 — that hasn't been on vinyl until now. Grab it here; it dropped Nov. 24, for Record Store Day Black Friday.\n\nJoni Mitchell - Court and Spark Demos\n\nPost-aneurysm recovery, Joni Mitchell's on a well-deserved victory lap. But it's far more rewarding to analyze her as a musical genius than simply shower her with icon-status accolades.\n\nJoni Mitchell Archives – Vol. 3: The Asylum Years (1972–1975), from last October, is a terrific way to do just that; its unvarnished alternate versions strip away the '70s gloss to spellbinding effect.\n\nWhich is no exception regarding the Court and Spark demos, which got a standalone release for RSD Black Friday.\n\nP!NK - TRUSTFALL (Deluxe Edition)\n\nThe dependable Pink returned in 2023 with the well-regarded TRUSTFALL, and it's already getting an expanded presentation.\n\nIts Deluxe Edition is filled with six previously unheard live recordings from her 2023 Summer Carnival Stadium Tour. Therein, you can find two new singles, including \"Dreaming,\" a collaboration with Marshmello and Sting. Pre-order it today.\n\nSnoop Dogg - Doggystyle (30th Anniversary Edition)\n\nAfter his star-making turn on Dr. Dre's The Chronic, 16-time GRAMMY nominee Snoop Dogg stepped out with his revolutionary, Dre-assisted debut album, Doggystyle.\n\nPermeated with hedonistic, debaucherous fun, the 1993 classic only furthered G-funk's momentum as a force within hip-hop.\n\nRevisit — or discover — the album via this 30-year anniversary reissue, available now on streaming and vinyl.\n\nAs per the latter, the record is available special color variants, including a gold foil cover and clear/cloudy blue vinyl via Walmart, a clear and black smoke vinyl via Amazon and a green and black smoke vinyl via indie retailers.\n\nAlicia Keys - The Diary of Alicia Keys 20\n\nAlicia Keys has scored an incredible 15 GRAMMYs and 31 nominations — and if that run didn't exactly begin with 2003's The Diary of Alicia Keys, that album certainly cemented her royalty.\n\nHer heralded second album, which features classics like \"Karma,\" \"If I Was Your Woman\"/\"Walk On By\" and \"Diary,\" is being reissued on Dec. 1 — expanded to 24 tracks, and featuring an unreleased song, \"Golden Child.\"\n\nThe Sound of Music (Super Deluxe Edition Boxed Set)\n\nFifty-seven years has done nothing to dim the appeal of 1965's The Sound of Music — both the flick and its indelible soundtrack.\n\nRe-immerse yourself in classics like \"My Favorite Things\" via The Sound of Music (Super Deluxe Edition Boxed Set), which arrives Dec. 1.\n\nThe box contains more than 40 previously unreleased tracks, collecting every musical element from the film for the first time, along with instrumentals for every song, demos and rare outtakes from the cast.\n\nFurthermore, an audio Blu-ray features the full score in hi-res plus a new Dolby Atmos mix of the original soundtrack. And the whole shebang is housed in a 64-page hardbound book with liner notes from film preservationist Mike Matessino.\n\nABBA - The Visitors (Deluxe Edition)\n\nWith their eighth album, 1981's The Visitors, the Swedish masterminds — and five-time GRAMMY nominees — stepped away from lighter fare and examined themselves more deeply than ever.\n\nThe result was heralded as their most mature album to date — and has been repackaged before, with a Deluxe Edition in 2012.\n\nThis (quite belated) 40th anniversary edition continues its evolution in the marketplace. And better late than never: The Visitors was their final album until their 2021 farewell, Voyage, and on those terms alone, deserves reexamination.\n\nAretha Franklin - A Portrait of the Queen 1970-1974\n\nRolling Stone didn't recently declare Aretha Franklin the greatest singer of all time for no reason: in 2023, there's nary a pretender to the Queen of Soul's throne.\n\nA Portrait of the Queen 1970-1974 compiles her first five albums of the 1970s: This Girl's In Love With You, Spirit in the Dark, Young Gifted and Black, Hey Now Hey (The Other Side of the Sky), and Let Me In Your Life.\n\nEach has been remastered from the analog master tapes. The vinyl version has a bonus disc of session alternates, outtakes & demos. Both CD and vinyl versions are packaged with booklets featuring sleeve notes by Gail Mitchell and David Nathan. Grab it on Dec. 1.\n\nFela Kuti - Box Set #6\n\nFrom the great beyond, Fela Kuti has done music journalists a solid in simply numbering his boxes. But this isn't just any Kuti box: it's curated by the one and only Idris Elba, who turned in a monumental performance as Stringer Bell on \"The Wire.\"\n\nThe fifth go-round contains the Afrobeat giant's albums Open & Close, Music of Many Colors, Stalemate, I Go Shout Plenty!!!, Live In Amsterdam (2xLP), and Opposite People. It includes a 24 page booklet featuring lyrics, commentaries by Afrobeat historian Chris May, and never-before-seen photos.\n\nThe box is only available in a limited edition of 5,000 worldwide, so act fast: it's also available on Dec. 1.\n\nKate Bush - Hounds of Love (The Baskerville Edition) / Hounds of Love (The Boxes of Lost Sea)\n\nKate Bush rocketed back into the public consciousness in 2022, via \"Stranger Things.\" The lovefest continues unabated with these two editions of Hounds of Love, which features that signature song: \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God.)\n\nThere is no new audio on either edition; they feature distinctive packaging, and the latter splits the album into two boxes. Read on here, and pre-order them via Bush's site; they arrive Dec. 1.\n\nThe Rolling Stones - December's Children (And Everybody's), Got Live If You Want It! And The Rolling Stones No. 2 (Vinyl Reissues)\n\nThese three '60s Stones albums have slipped between the cracks over the years — but if you love the world-renowned rock legends in its infancy, they're essential listens.\n\nNo. 2 is their second album from 1965; the same year's December's Children is the last of their early songs to lean heavily on covers; Got Live If You Want It! is an early live document capturing the early hysteria swarming around the band.\n\nOn Dec. 1, they're reissued on 180g vinyl; for more information and to order, visit here.\n\nPink Floyd - Atom Heart Mother (Special Edition)\n\nNo, it's not half as famous as The Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall — but 1970's lumpy Atom Heart Mother certainly has its partisans.\n\nRediscover a hidden corner of the Floyd catalog — the one between Ummagumma and Meddle — via this special edition, which features newly discovered live footage from more than half a century ago.\n\nThe Black Crowes - The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion\n\nAfter endless fraternal infighting, the Black Crowes are back — can they keep it together?\n\nIn the meantime, their second album, 1992's The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, remains a stellar slice of roots rock — as a sprawling, three-disc Super Deluxe Edition bears out. If you're a bird of this feather, don't miss it when it arrives on Dec. 15.\n\n7 Musical Sibling Rivalries: CCR, Oasis, The Kinks & More\n\nFifty years ago, a young generation of British rock 'n' rollers were ready to show the world that the lessons learned from the Beatles were not lost on them. If the kaleidoscopic Sgt. Pepper’s had proven that pop music could be anything you wanted it to be, the artists that followed took those radical ideas to a new level.\n\nUnited by the vague, umbrella-like term of progressive rock, bands like Genesis, Pink Floyd, Queen and King Crimson expanded the lexicon of rock with influences that ranged from classical and baroque to free jazz and acid-folk; blues to reggae and music hall. Today, these records define the sound of classic rock.\n\n1973 signified an absolute apex — the sweetest moment in time when everything seemed possible and each new album gleamed with the joy of innovation. Here are 10 records from British artists that marked a before and after for classic rock.\n\nPink Floyd – The Dark Side of the Moon\n\nYears of psychedelic wanderings and space-rock exploration — not to mention the trauma of losing a beloved bandmate to drugs — crystallized into Pink Floyd’s unequivocal masterpiece. An album so sublime, it makes the seven LPs that preceded it sound like rough sketches in comparison.\n\nThe lyrics are wicked in their cynicism and existential malaise, and the band finally sounds tight and economical. But Dark Side's greatest virtue here is the sheer beauty of the melodies, one gauzy song leading into the other with effortless grace. \"Money\" was the hit single and \"Time\" redrew the boundaries of rock through immersive sound effects. But \"The Great Gig in the Sky,\" with its wordless female vocals and achingly nostalgic chords, showed that the Floydian mystique was as soulful as the blues.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Brain Salad Surgery\n\nTrilogy, the dreamy 1972 album by mad keyboardist Keith Emerson, bassist/vocalist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer, had been constructed in the studio with layers and layers of overdubs. As a natural reaction, the trio decided their next effort should be the kind of record they could play in a live setting.\n\nSporting an ominous cover by Alien visual artist H. R. Giger, Brain Salad Surgery is, strangely enough, the antithesis of prog-rock pomp. Behind the epic length of multi-part symphony \"Karn Evil 9\" lurk visceral touches of dissonance and noise, nocturnal piano harmonics and a goofy sense of humor. At the time, ELP was vilified for its pretension to merge rock with classical. Half a century later, they deserve praise for letting their collective imagination run wild.\n\nKing Crimson – Lark’s Tongues in Aspic\n\nLed with unspoken dictatorial fire by acerbic guitar mastermind Robert Fripp, the mid-‘70s incarnation of the ever-evolving King Crimson played abstract heavy metal for the soul. All hell breaks loose when the freeform improvisation of \"The Talking Drum\" gives way to the demonic groove of \"Lark’s Tongues in Aspic (Part II),\" enhanced by the pristine clang-clang finesse of Bill Bruford, the most intellectual drummer of his generation.\n\nAll Crimson albums drown their sorrows in an unexpected moment of pastoral bliss, and \"Book of Saturday\" doesn’t disappoint, the lament of vocalist John Wetton framed by Fripp’s avant-pop guitar — a song so quiet and beautiful, it almost hurts.\n\nCamel – Camel\n\nThere was a pervasive sweetness of spirit, a caramel tint to Camel’s nimble instrumental workouts and monotone vocals. Their soundscapes were a tad too delicate and whimsical to match the imposing scale of ‘70s heavyweights like Genesis and Floyd.\n\nIn retrospect, Camel stands as the most criminally underrated band of the classic prog movement. This full-bodied debut is jazzy and psychedelic, showcasing the wide-eyed melodic sense of guitarist Andy Latimer and keyboardist Pete Bardens. Camel proved that you don’t need a powerful vocalist to make the music soar.\n\nGenesis – Selling England by the Pound\n\nA doorway into an enchanted world of sumptuous keyboard solos, 12-string guitars and rambunctious drum fills (hello, Phil Collins), Genesis’ fifth studio album has mystified and enthralled generations of art-rock lovers. The sonic manifesto of five young musicians at the top of their game (all of whom would eventually enjoy success as solo artists), Selling combines a wacky, quintessential British eccentricity with sweeping melodies, social satire and the surreal imagery of singer/lyricist Peter Gabriel.\n\nKeyboardist Tony Banks found inspiration in Rachmaninoff for the majestic intro to \"Firth of Fifth,\" while \"The Cinema Show\" namedrops T.S. Eliot. \"The Battle of Epping Forest\" turns a gang massacre over urban boundaries into a delirious mini-opera. An album of limitless imagination, it has aged remarkably well.\n\nQueen – Queen I\n\nMany fans prefer Queen’s early, heavier glam-rock albums over the polished commercial blockbusters that followed — and they have a point. An exhilarating debut, Queen I is deliciously rough around the edges, but at the same time brims with the grandeur and melodic genius that characterized the London quartet from its inception. \"Liar\" boasts the singalong melodrama that would explode in A Night at the Opera, while guitarist Brian May’s \"The Night Comes Down\" hums with folk-rock longing. Funky and defiant, opening cut \"Keep Yourself Alive\" unlocks the hit-making blueprint of a band poised to conquer the world.\n\nYes – Tales from Topographic Oceans\n\nAt the time of its release, Yes’ sprawling double album based on four separate volumes of ancient Hindu scriptures appeared to encapsulate the excesses of ‘70s rock — and why the punk movement would aim to counteract and destroy rock. Tales even motivated keyboardist Rick Wakeman to leave the band, claiming that he couldn’t play music that he didn’t comprehend (no worries, he would return to the fold several times.)\n\nFive decades later, it can be appreciated for what it really is: An ambitious sonic adventure that is in no rush whatsoever to take you to the bridge. Its four, 20 minute-long \"songs\" are cohesive, ethereal and filled with lovely moments, from the gentle meditation of \"The Remembering\" to the percussion freakout that brings \"Ritual\" to a feverish climax. Not for everyone’s taste, sure enough, but as dense and rewarding as a Gustav Mahler symphony.\n\nRoxy Music – Street Life\n\n\"Here as I sit at this empty café, thinking of you,\" croons a mournful Bryan Ferry on \"A Song for Europe.\" As the six-minute track meanders on – torrid sax lines, grandiloquent piano, lyrics in Latin and French — the Roxy Music aesthetic blooms, fully formed.\n\nThe third of eight exquisite albums that make up the Roxy canon, Street Life betrays Ferry’s fine arts studies at Newcastle with its combination of garish pop spectacle, avant-garde esoterics and a perverse obsession with the beauty of everything — from the group’s legendary LP covers to the ornate hooks and the aural architecture of it all. And the bridge, it sighs.\n\nMike Oldfield – Tubular Bells\n\nWunderkind Mike Oldfield was only 19 when he recorded the majority of this remarkable debut, performing every instrument himself. Inspired by the mystical sweep of English folk and drawn to minimalism and multi-tracking, the guitarist was in tune with the progressive trends of the time, but his long form pieces are stubbornly idiosyncratic.\n\nTubular’s opening theme was used in the horror movie hit The Exorcist and Oldfield became an instant rock star. Still, this album is only an intriguing opening statement for the many masterpieces that followed – most notably, Ommadawn (1975) and Incantations (1978.)\n\nLed Zeppelin – Houses of the Holy\n\nHaving cemented the bulldozer-like propulsion of its hard-rock creed, Led Zeppelin spent most of 1972 making an album that reflected the current times: expansive, stylistically omnivorous, preoccupied with grander themes. Seeped in haunting Mellotron textures, \"The Rain Song\" is the quartet’s proggiest moment, and \"D’yer Mak’er\" goes reggae-rock with impeccable taste. Conservative Zep fans found solace in the rollicking opener \"The Song Remains the Same,\" proving that hardrock still enjoyed a creative peak in 1973. They had a dream, oh yeah, a crazy dream, and we’re still grooving along.\n\n20 Albums Turning 50 In 2023: 'Innervisions,' 'Dark Side Of The Moon' 'Catch A Fire' & More\n\nFifty years ago, a record-breaking 600,000 people gathered to see the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers Band and the Band play Summer Jam at Watkins Glen. This is just one of many significant historical events that happened in 1973 — a year that changed the way music was seen, heard and experienced.\n\nOngoing advancements in music-making tech expanded the sound of popular and underground music. New multi-track technology was now standard in recording studios from Los Angeles to London. Artists from a variety of genres experimented with new synthesizers, gadgets like the Mu-Tron III pedal and the Heil Talk Box, and techniques like the use of found sounds.\n\n1973 was also a year of new notables, where now-household names made their debuts. Among these auspicious entries: a blue-collar songwriter from the Jersey Shore, hard-working southern rockers from Jacksonville, Fla. and a sister group from California oozing soul.\n\nAlong a well-established format, '73 saw the release of several revolutionary concept records. The Eagles’ Desperado, Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, Lou Reed’s Berlin and the Who’s Quadrophenia are just a few examples that illustrate how artists used narrative techniques to explore broader themes and make bigger statements on social, political and economic issues — of which there were many.\n\nOn the domestic front, 1973 began with the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. Internationally, the Paris Peace Accords were signed — starting the long process to end the Vietnam War. An Oil crisis caused fuel prices to skyrocket in North America. Richard Nixon started his short-lived second term as president, which was marked by the Watergate scandal.\n\nPolitics aside, the third year of the '70s had it all: from classic- and southern-rock to reggae; punk to jazz; soul and R&B to country. Read on for 20 masterful albums with something to say that celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2023.\n\nBand On The Run - Paul McCartney & Wings\n\nLaid down at EMI’s studio in Lagos, Nigeria and released in December 1973, the third studio record by Paul Mcartney & Wings is McCartney’s most successful post-Beatles album. Its hit singles \"Jet\" and the title cut \"Band on the Run\" helped make the record the biggest-selling in 1974 in both Australia and Canada.\n\nBand on the Run won a pair of GRAMMYS the following year: Best Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical. McCartney added a third golden gramophone for this record at the 54th awards celebration when it won Best Historical Album for the 2010 reissue. In 2013, Band on the Run was inducted into the GRAMMY Hall of Fame.\n\nHead Hunters - Herbie Hancock\n\nReleased Oct. 13, Herbie Hancock’s Head Hunters was recorded in just one week; its\n\nfour songs clock in at just over 40 minutes. That the album was not nominated in the jazz category, but instead Best Pop Instrumental Performance, demonstrates how Hancock was shifting gears.\n\nHead Hunters showed Hancock moving away from traditional instrumentation and playing around with new synthesizer technology — especially the clavinet — and putting together a new band: the Headhunters. Improvisation marks this as a jazz record, but the phrasing, rhythms and dynamics of Hancock’s new quintet makes it equal parts soul and R&B with sprinkles of rock 'n' roll.\n\nThe album represented a commercial and artistic breakthrough for Hancock, going gold within months of its release. \"Watermelon Man\" and \"Chameleon,\" which was nominated for a Best Instrumental GRAMMY Award in 1974, were later both frequently sampled by hip-hop artists in the 1990s.\n\nGreetings From Asbury Park, N.J. - Bruce Springsteen\n\nBruce Springsteen, 22, was the new kid in town in 1973. This debut was met with tepid reviews. Still, Greetings introduced Springsteen’s talent to craft stories in song and includes many characters The Boss would return to repeatedly in his career. The album kicks off with the singalong \"Blinded by the Light,\" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard 100 four years later via a cover done by Manfred Mann’s Earth Band. This was the first of two records Springsteen released in 1973; The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle arrived before the end of the year — officially introducing the E Street Band.\n\nInnervisions - Stevie Wonder\n\nThis Stevie Wonder masterpiece shows an artist, in his early 20s, experimenting with new instrumentation such as TONTO (The Original New Timbral Orchestra) — the world’s largest synth — and playing all instruments on the now-anthemic \"Higher Ground.\"\n\nThe song reached No.1 on the U.S. Hot R&B Singles Chart, and Innervisions peaked at No. 4. The album won three GRAMMYS the following year, including Album Of The Year. Wonder was the first Black artist to win this coveted golden gramophone. In 1989, Red Hot Chili Peppers kept the original funk, but injected the song with a lot of rock on their cover — the lead single from Mother’s Milk.\n\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon - Pink Floyd\n\nCritics perennially place this Pink Floyd album, the band's eighth studio record, as one of the greatest of all-time. The Dark Side of the Moon hit No.1 and stayed on the Billboard charts for 63 weeks.\n\nA sonic masterpiece marked by loops, synths, found sounds, and David Gilmour’s guitar bends, Dark Side of the Moon is also a concept record that explores themes of excessive greed on tracks like \"Money.\" Ironically, an album lambasting consumerism was the top-selling record of the year and has eclipsed 45 million sales worldwide since its release. The album’s cover has also become one of the most recognized in the history of popular music.\n\nPronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd - Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nThis debut release features several of the northern Florida rockers' most beloved songs: \"Gimme Three Steps,\" \"Tuesday’s Gone\" and \"Simple Man.\" The record, which has since reached two-times platinum status with sales of more than two million, also includes the anthemic \"Free Bird,\" which catapulted them to stardom. The song with its slow-build and definitive guitar solo and jam in the middle became Lynyrd Skynyrd's signature song that ended all their shows; it also became a piece of pop culture with people screaming for this song during concerts by other artists.\n\nHouses Of The Holy - Led Zeppelin\n\nThe first Led Zeppelin record of all originals — and the first without a Roman numeral for a title — Houses of the Holy shows a new side of these British hardrockers. Straying from the blues and hard rock of previous records, Houses of the Holy features funk (“The Ocean” and “The Crunge”) and even hints of reggae (“D’Yer Mak’er”). This fifth studio offering from Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham also includes one of this writer’s personal Zeppelin favorites — \"Over the Hills and Far Away.” The song was released as the album’s first U.S. single and reached No. 51 on the Billboard charts. Despite mixed reviews from critics, Houses of the Holy eventually achieved Diamond status for sales of more than 10 million. Interesting fact: the song “Houses of the Holy” actually appears on the band’s next record (Physical Graffiti).\n\nQuadrophenia - The Who\n\nThe double-album rock opera followed the critical success of Tommy and Who’s Next. Pete Townshend composed all songs on this opus, which was later adapted into a movie. And, in 2015, classically-scored by Townshend’s partner Rachel Fuller for a new generation via a symphonic version (“Classic Quadrophenia”). The story chronicles the life of a young mod named Jimmy who lives in the seaside town of Brighton, England. Jimmy searches for meaning in a life devoid of significance — taking uppers, downers and guzzling gin only to discover nothing fixes his malaise. With sharp-witted songs, Townshend also tackles classicism. His band of musical brothers: Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Keith Moon provide some of their finest recorded performances. The album reached second spot on the U.S. Billboard chart.\n\nBerlin - Lou Reed\n\nProduced by Bob Ezrin, Berlin is a metaphor. The divided walled city represents the divisive relationships and the two sides of Reed — on stage and off. The 10 track concept record chronicles a couple’s struggles with drug addiction, meditating on themes of domestic abuse and neglect. As a parent, try to listen to \"The Kids\" without shedding a tear. While the couple on the record are named Caroline and Jim, those who knew Reed’s volatile nature and drug dependency saw the parallels between this fictionalized narrative and the songwriter’s life.\n\nCatch A Fire - Bob Marley & the Wailers\n\nThe original cover was enclosed in a sleeve resembling a Zippo lighter. Only 20,000 of this version were pressed. Even though it was creative and cool, cost-effective it was not — each individual cover had to be hand-riveted. The replacement, which most people know today, introduces reggae poet and prophet Robert Nesta Marley to the world. With a pensive stare and a large spliff in hand, Marley tells you to mellow out and listen to the tough sounds of his island home.\n\nWhile Bob and his Wailers had been making music for nearly a decade and released several records in Jamaica, Catch a Fire was their coming out party outside the Caribbean. Released in April on Island Records, the feel-good reggae rhythms and Marley’s messages of emancipation resonated with a global audience. A mix of songs of protest (\"Slave Driver,\" \"400 years\") and love (\"Kinky Reggae\"), Catch A Fire is also notable for \"Stir it Up,\" a song American singer-songwriter Johnny Nash had made a Top 15 hit the previous year.\n\nThe New York Dolls - The New York Dolls\n\nThe New York Dolls burst on the club scene in the Big Apple, building a cult following with their frenetic and unpredictable live shows. The Dolls' hard rock sound and f-you attitude waved the punk banner before the genre was coined, and influenced the sound of punk rock for generations. (Bands like the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and KISS, cite the New York Dolls as mentors.) Singer-songwriter Todd Rundgren — who found time to release A Wizard, A True Star this same year — produced this tour de force. From the opening \"Personality Crisis,\" this five-piece beckons you to join this out-of-control train.\n\nAladdin Sane - David Bowie\n\nThis David Bowie record followed the commercial success of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust & The Spiders from Mars. Many critics unfairly compare the two. A career chameleon, with Aladdin Sane, Bowie shed the Ziggy persona and adopted another alter-ego. The title is a pun that means: \"A Lad Insane.\" For the songwriter, this record represented an attempt to break free from the crazed fandom Ziggy Stardust had created.\n\nA majority of the songs were written the previous year while Bowie toured the United States in support of Ziggy. Journal in hand, the artist traveled from city to city in America and the songs materialized. Most paid homage to what this “insane lad” observed and heard: from debauchery and societal decay (\"Cracked Actor\") to politics (\"Panic in Detroit\") to punk music (\"Watch That Man\"). Top singles on Aladdin Sane were: \"The Jean Genie\" and \"Drive-In Saturday.\" Both topped the U.K. charts.\n\nFaust IV -Faust\n\nThis fourth studio album — and the final release in this incarnation by this experimental avant-garde German ambient band — remains a cult classic. Recorded at the Manor House in Oxfordshire, England (Richard Branson’s new Virgin Records studio and the locale where Mike Oldfield crafted his famous debut Tubular Bells, also released in 1973), Faust IV opens with the epic 11-minute instrumental \"Krautrock\" — a song that features drones, clusters of tones and sustained notes to create a trance-like vibe. Drums do not appear in the song until after the seven minute mark.\n\nThe song is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the genre British journalists coined to describe bands like Faust, which musicians largely did not embrace. The rest of Faust IV is a sonic exploration worthy of repeated listens and a great place to start if you’ve ever wondered what the heck Krautrock is.\n\nBrothers & Sisters - the Allman Brothers Band\n\nGreat art is often born from grief, and Brothers & Sisters is exemplary in this way. Founding member Duanne Allman died in 1971 and bassist Berry Oakley followed his bandmate to the grave a year later; he was killed in a motorcycle accident in November 1972. Following this pair of tragedies, the band carried on the only way they knew how: by making music.\n\nWith new members hired, Brothers & Sisters was recorded with guitarist Dicky Betts as the new de facto band leader. The Allman Brothers Band’s most commercially successful record leans into country territory from the southern rock of previous releases and features two of the band’s most popular songs: \"Ramblin’ Man\" and \"Jessica.\" The album went gold within 48 hours of shipping and since has sold more than seven million copies worldwide.\n\nCall Me - Al Green\n\nCall Me is considered one of the greatest soul records of the 20th century and Green’s pièce de résistance. The fact this Al Green album features three Top 10 Billboard singles — \"You Ought to Be With Me,\" \"Here I Am\" and the title track — helps explain why it remains a masterpiece. Beyond the trio of hits, the soul king shows his versatility by reworking a pair of country songs: Hank Williams’ \"I’m so Lonesome I Could Cry,\" and Willie Nelson’s \"Funny How Time Slips Away.\"\n\nKilling Me Softly - Roberta Flack\n\nThis Roberta Flack album was nominated for three GRAMMY Awards and won two: Record Of The Year and Best Female Vocal Pop Performance at the 1974 GRAMMYs (it lost in the Album of the Year category to Innervisions). With equal parts soul and passion, Flack interprets beloved ballads that showcase her talent of taking others’ songs and reinventing them. Producer Joel Dorn assembled the right mix of players to back up Flack — adding to the album’s polished sound. Killing Me Softly has sold more than two million copies and, in 2020, Roberta Flack received the GRAMMY Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThe album's title cut became a No.1 hit in three countries and, in 1996, the Fugees prominently featured Lauryn Hill on a version that surpassed the original: landing the No.1 spot in 21 countries. The album also includes a pair of well-loved covers: Leonard Cohen’s \"Suzanne\" and Janis Ian’s wistful \"Jesse,\" which reached No. 30.\n\nBette Midler - Bette Middler\n\nCo-produced by Arif Mardin and Barry Manilow, the self-titled second studio album by Bette Midler was an easy- listening experience featuring interpretations of both standards and popular songs. Whispers of gospel are mixed with R&B and some boogie-woogie piano, though Midler’s voice is always the star. The record opens with a nod to the Great American Songbook with a reworking of Johnny Mercer and Hoagy Carmichael’s \"Skylark.\" The 10-song collection also features a take on Glenn Miller’s \"In the Mood,\" and a divine cover of Bob Dylan’s \"I Shall be Released.\" The record peaked at No. 6 on the U.S. charts.\n\nImagination - Gladys Knight & the Pips\n\nReleased in October, Imagination was Gladys Knight & the Pips' first album with Buddha Records after leaving Motown, and features the group’s only No. 1 Billboard hit: \"Midnight Train to Georgia.\" The oft-covered tune, which won a GRAMMY the following year, and became the band’s signature, helped the record eclipse a million in sales, but it was not the only single to resonate. Other timeless, chart-topping songs from Imagination include \"Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me,\" and \"I’ve Got to Use My Imagination.\"\n\nThe Pointer Sisters - The Pointer Sisters\n\nThe three-time GRAMMY-winning Pointer Sisters arrived on the scene in 1973 with this critically-acclaimed self-titled debut. Then a quartet, the group of sisters from Oakland, California made listeners want to shake a tail feather with 10 songs that ranged from boogie-woogie to bebop. Their sisterly harmonies are backed up by the San Francisco blues-funk band the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils. The record opens with \"Yes We Can,\" a hypnotic groove of a song written by Allen Toussaint which was a Top 15 hit alongside another cover, Willie Dixon’s \"Wang Dang Doodle.\"\n\nBehind Closed Doors - Charlie Rich\n\nThis pop-leaning country record of orchestral ballads, produced by Billy Sherrill, made Rich rich. The album has surpassed four million in sales and remains one of the genre’s best-loved classics. The album won Charlie Rich a GRAMMY the following year for Best Country Vocal Performance Male and added four Country Music Awards. Behind Closed Doors had several hits, but the title track made the most impact. The song written by Kenny O’Dell, and whose title was inspired by the Watergate scandal, was the first No.1 hit for Rich. It topped the country charts where it spent 20 weeks in 1973. It was also a Billboard crossover hit — reaching No. 15 on the Top 100 and No. 8 on the Adult Contemporary charts.\n\n1972 Was The Most Badass Year In Latin Music: 11 Essential Albums From Willie Colón, Celia Cruz, Juan Gabriel & Others\n\nWhen Pink Floyd released Animals in January 1977 amid the burgeoning punk movement. The band's 10th album is often described as the group's response to punk, but — intentionally or not — the atypically dark and aggressive album also lit the fuse for the eventual rise of melodic metal.\n\nMusically and lyrically, Animals represented Pink Floyd at its most forceful and ambitious; the dreamy space-rock textures that characterized their breakthrough album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and its followup, 1975's Wish You Were Here, were scaled back in favor of a harsher approach. Animals featured lyricist/bassist Roger Waters' most focused lyrics to date. Inspired in part by George Orwell's dystopian 1945 novel Animal Farm, the album presented an allegory in which all of humanity is characterized as pigs, dogs and sheep.\n\nAs a result, many saw Animals as the British group's take on the contemporary punk scene, a movement spearheaded in the U.K. by the Sex Pistols, the Damned, the Clash and others.\n\nWith some reluctance and caveats, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason allows that punk did have some influence on the album. The group's previous albums had been created at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London — the same world-class studio used by the Beatles to record most of their work — which was populated with skilled engineers who followed strict rules; Mason chuckles as he describes them as wearing \"smart white coats.\"\n\nBut by 1976, Pink Floyd had converted part of their equipment storage/rehearsal facility, Britannia Row, into a recording studio. There the band could work at its own pace, making its own rules. The Britannia Row studio was smaller and less sophisticated than Abbey Road, and that would be reflected in the sound of Animals. \"Everyone was sort of looking at punk and thinking about doing things faster,\" Mason recalls. \"Rather than settling into a two- or three-year project, it was, ‘Let's get on with it. Let's do it.'\"\n\nYet Mason emphasizes that the punk rock that was happening all around the band didn't exert direct influence on the barbed character of Animals. \"Were we particularly excited by [punk]?\" he asks rhetorically. \"No. Every now and again, there'd be something that would be interesting, but an awful lot of punk really wasn't of that great interest to us.\" He chuckles and adds, \"It was all a bit too fast and noisy.\" (Mason was later tapped to produce Music for Pleasure, the second album by punk heroes the Damned, but emphasizes that \"I learned far more from them than they did from me.\")\n\nStill, the tone and approach of Pink Floyd's late '70s release would inspire future artists, especially among the style that would come to be known as melodic metal. In the 1990s and beyond, Steven Wilson created a body of work that drew upon Pink Floyd as a primary influence. Working first as a solo project and later as a band, Wilson released 10 albums under the Porcupine Tree banner. While early Porcupine Tree explored sonic dreamscapes, by the time of 2005's Deadwing and its followup Fear of a Blank Planet (2007), the band had moved decidedly in the direction of melodic metal.\n\nAnd while Wilson has always been inspired by a widely eclectic range of influences, his metal-leaning work bore the influence of Animals. He admitted as much in \"Animals and Me,\" a 2020 essay for Prog Magazine. While Pink Floyd is often described as progressive rock, Wilson asserted that with Animals, the band moved beyond that genre. \"There's nothing about it that's stereotypically progressive rock,\" he wrote.\n\nAnimals is often viewed as the beginning of the dominance of Roger Waters within Pink Floyd — he composed all of the record's lyrics and is credited with most of the music — though Wilson hears something else. \"For me, it's [David] Gilmour's part; the guitar work on the album is the greatest of all, which is saying something.\" Throughout the record, Gilmour's always inventive and lyrical lead guitar work takes on an uncharacteristically angry tone, one in keeping with the album's dark, often pessimistic themes.\n\nAnd such serious, weighty themes would become a foundational part of music by later melodic metal bands including Nine Inch Nails, Dream Theater and Tool. Maynard James Keenan is vocalist and songwriter for metal bands Tool and Puscifer, and credits Animals as an inspiration for both groups. \"Pink Floyd, [and] specifically Animals, has had a huge influence on Puscifer and Tool,\" Keenan tells GRAMMY.com. \"Not just because of the compositions, but also the approach to production and instrumentation.\"\n\nThat influence endures some 45 years after Animals' release. Keenan's more recent work continues to find inspiration not only from Waters' lyrics, but from the distinctive keyboard textures of Pink Floyd's Richard Wright. Keenan notes that like Animals, Puscifer's most recent release, 2020's Existential Reckoning \"has the Arp Solina [String Ensemble] all over it.\"\n\nWhen a who's who of progressive and metal artists collaborated on the 2021 album Animals Reimagined: A Tribute to Pink Floyd, two members of Dream Theater enthusiastically participated, underscoring their appreciation for the influential ‘77 album. Singer James LaBrie took the lead vocal on a reading of \"Pigs (Three Different Ones),\" and Jordan Rudess provided extensive keyboard work on \"Dogs.\"\n\n\"The driving and hypnotic – while still rocking – nature of Animals made it a very unique album and source of inspiration to me,\" says Rudess. \"That pulsing sound opened the door for so many; in our music we have proudly tipped our hats to the mighty Floyd many times.\"\n\nNick Mason agrees that there are some through lines connecting Pink Floyd's 1977 album with the more tuneful side of modern heavy metal. While taking mild issue with the term melodic metal (\"I'm opposed to putting labels on anything,\" he emphasizes), he allows that Animals can be thought to fit that description. \"If I was going to put a label on it,\" Mason says with a smile, \"there's something quite nice about that one.\"\n\nWhile Animals is neither punk nor metal, four and a half decades after its release the album can be seen as a kind of link between the two rock subgenres. In 1977, Pink Floyd was sometimes viewed as among the \"dinosaurs\" that punk hoped to sweep away. \"I think the big thing that punk did that was really useful was [to take] the wind out of the sails of prog rock that had become so bombastic,\" Mason says.\n\nThe comparatively stripped-down aesthetic of Animals was in line with that kind of approach, and in the process it provided some musical cues for metal players to come. In his Prog essay, Steven Wilson made a similar point when writing specifically about Animals: \"At their very heart, [Pink Floyd] have very simple songs, without unnecessary complexity, and I think that's given them a timeless quality,\" he wrote. And he – among many others – took those values to heart in much of his own work. \"It wouldn't be overstating to say that Animals is responsible in many ways for the path that my career took,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nAnd it continues to influence artists who make today's melodic metal. \"Animals carved new ground for music production,\" agrees Dream Theater's Rudess. \"And it has played an important part of all the rock that has followed.\"\n\nSound Bites: Iggy Pop Explains How A \"Primal Groove\" Was The Genesis Of His Raw Power Onstage"
