The Story of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd” is slated for theatrical release in North America in June, with theaters and dates to be revealed in the coming weeks.\n\nDirected by award-winning filmmaker Roddy Bogawa and the late, acclaimed album cover designer Storm Thorgerson, the feature length doc lifts the lid on the relationship between the visionaries behind prog rock and British psychedelic music and founding member Barrett, who left Pink Floyd before they met stardom.\n\nRevered by many as one of music’s most influential and mysterious figures, it was Barrett who gave the group their moniker by combining the names of two obscure blues players, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.\n\nNarrated by actor Jason Isaacs, the film features intimate interviews with Floyd bandmembers David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Roger Waters in an attempt to uncover Barrett’s impact on the group, which lasted well after he left.\n\nIt also includes interviews with original band managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King, as well as the Who’s Pete Townshend and Blur’s Graham Coxon.\n\n“Would anyone care about the story of Syd Barrett if Pink Floyd hadn’t become one of the biggest bands of all time? Would Pink Floyd have existed without Syd?” Bogawa, the filmmaker behind “Taken by Storm: The Art of Storm Thorgerson and Hipgnosis,” said in a statement.\n\n“I miss Storm probably in the same way as many of those in our film miss Syd, a friend who they dearly loved and shared fond memories and adventures,” Bogawa added. “Syd just happened to become one of the most famous cult icons in music.”\n\nBarrett and Pink Floyd crystallized a cultural moment where anything seemed possible but where that freedom could come at a cost. And in the remaining years, all the mystery around Barrett created nothing but more questions.\n\nWas Syd just another drug casualty? Did he suffer from an undiagnosed mental health condition?\n\nOr did he dislike the attention and fame as the fun turned to work? Was he really left by the band on the side of the road after a gig?\n\nHow much of the group’s success is owed to Barrett?\n\nWhile there are no crystal-clear answers, there is the feeling by all those around Barrett that something went terribly wrong.\n\n“Have You Got It Yet?” is both a chronicle and a montage of his creative and destructive impulses, his captivating presence and absence making for a portrait of the complex puzzle that was Barrett’s life.\n\nHopefully in a few weeks, more of the pieces will come together.\n\nVinyl of the Week\n\nKeep an eye on this spot as each week we’ll be looking at new or soon-to-be-released vinyl from a variety of artists. It might be a re-pressing of a landmark recording, special edition or new collection from a legendary act.\n\nThis week, it’s the reissue of an LP celebrating the four-decade mark by a beloved Canadian prog-rock trio.\n\n• Rush: “Signals, 40th Anniversary”\n\nThe Rush 40th anniversary album series celebration continues Friday with an expanded edition of the band’s decade-defining 1982 release, “Signals,” which made it clear that despite an ever-shifting 1980s musical landscape, the iconic three-piece band wasn’t going anywhere.\n\nOriginally released in September 1982, “Signals” and its technology-embracing riffs and rhythms, continued the forward-thinking trajectory of the acclaimed Canadian trio as it continued to chart the demands of a new decade.\n\nThe album’s eight songs built upon Rush’s penchant for adapting to the flow of the times without compromising its flair for melding long-established progressive roots with radio-friendly song arrangements.\n\n“Subdivisions,” the generation-defining lead-off track on “Signals,” succinctly captured the angst of the perpetual restless dreams of youth, and the synth-driven song subsequently became one of Rush’s most celebrated FM favorites as well as a concert staple for the remainder of the bandmembers’ careers.\n\nThe 40th anniversary of “Signals” is available in three distinct configurations, including the Super Deluxe Edition, one-LP Picture Disc Edition, and a Dolby Atmos Digital Edition.\n\nThere will also be a limited edition Super Deluxe box featuring eight lithographs of drummer Neil Peart’s original hand-drawn lyrics\n\nfor each song on “Signals” only available through the official Rush online store, rushbackstage.com.\n\nThe Super Deluxe Edition includes one CD, one Blu-ray audio, one 180-gram black-vinyl LP with new artwork from original album designer Hugh Syme in a premium tip-on jacket, and 7-inch singles for four songs, “Subdivisions,” “Countdown,” “New World Man,” and “The Weapon,” all with new artwork from Syme.\n\nThe set encompasses the Abbey Road Mastering Studios 2015 remastered edition of the album for the first time on CD. The Blu-ray audio disc contains the core album newly mixed from the original multi-tracks in Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD 5.1.\n\nAlso included on the Blu-ray are new animated visualizers for all eight songs, as well as two bonus remastered vintage promo videos for “Subdivisions” and “Countdown,” the latter of which features NASA-authorized Space Shuttle Columbia launch footage.\n\nAdditionally, the LP in the Super Deluxe Edition has been cut via half-speed direct metal mastering on a 180-gram audiophile black-vinyl LP.\n\nThe Super Deluxe Edition of of “Signals” includes several exclusive items, like a 40-page hardcover book with new song illustrations, new artwork and unreleased photos from the “Signals” tour, along with three lenticular lithographs that transition from the original black-and-white band headshots into the original album’s “Digital Man” color headshots.\n\nThe set also features four “Signals” tour band lithographs, Syme’s original album cover sketch lithograph and a double-sided 24-inch by 24-inch poster featuring the new “Signals” artwork on one side and an outtake photo from the original album cover shoot on the other side.\n\nAll contents are housed in a premium lift-top box, which features significantly reimagined cover artwork by Syme.\n\nThe second configuration of “Signals” is a one-LP Picture Disc Edition, housed in a transparent plastic sleeve showcasing the new Hugh Syme artwork on both album sides.\n\nFinally, the third configuration, the Dolby Atmos Digital Edition, is the digital equivalent of Richard Chycki’s expert Atmos mix of all eight tracks from the original album.\n\nLook for “Signals, 40th Anniversary” online and from all respectable retailers who carry vinyl.\n\nTo contact music columnist Michael Christopher, send an email to rockmusicmenu@gmail.com.
