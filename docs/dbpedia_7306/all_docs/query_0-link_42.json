        "text": "Pink Floyd’s Animals: The Story 40 Years Later\n\nFrom classicalbumsundays.com\n\nIn 1976 Pink Floyd were flying high with their incredibly successful The Dark Side Of The Moon. It was still on the album charts and would be for an additional 12 years. The band had also had great success with their follow-up Wish You Were Here which met with commercial success even though the concept of the album centred around long lost bandmate Syd Barrett and their disdainful feelings toward the music business.\n\nAt this time the band decided to take a break from touring and instead, supplied with their somewhat increased earnings, turned their focus to building their own studio. They plowed in half a million pounds and after a year of construction, the Britannia Row studios in London’s Islington district was open and ready to record their next album, Animals.\n\nDue to their success and the rise of Roger Waters as the band’s creative conceptualist and lyricst, there were a lot of tensions within band due to creative disagreements. After their huge success all of the band members had considered quitting at one point or another. Despite the tensions, Waters once again hopped in the driver’s seat and this time steered the album’s concept in another direction as he turned his eye to society, itself.\n\nThe album is much more direct as it features confrontational lyrics loosely based on George Orwell’s Animal Farm. The Orwellian novel explores the corruption of power and human nature’s predisposition to destroy even the best ideals. The novel criticised Stalinism and represented the people within the different levels of communist society as animals. Somehow this seems particularly apt in the current political climate.\n\nThe pigs are the smartest animals and originate the idea of a rebellion against the farm’s oppressive owner. The pigs then run the farm and abuse their power. They use the dogs as secret police and to keep the other animals in line by killing those they considered traitors. The sheep are the mindless masses who follow the pigs’ every whim no matter how ridiculous they may seem.\n\nInstead of critiquing Stalin’s political system, Waters used the metaphor to apply to people in thrall with, or subject to capitalism.\n\nHe in particular applied this concept to 1970’s Britain. The pigs are dictators scared of the unknown but want to decide what is best for all. The dogs are cut-throat corporate stooges who will use any means necessary to climb on top of the heap. The pigs use the dogs to keep the meek and subservient masses of sheep in line.\n\nWaters felt compelled to write about society’s woes as he said at the time: “I think the world is a very, very sad place. I find myself at the moment, backing away from it all. I think these are very mournful days. Things aren’t getting better, they’re getting worse and the seventies is a very baleful decade.”\n\nThere are three pigs, two of which represent real characters. The first is the corporate pig, the second is Margaret Thatcher, and the third is Mary Whitehouse, leader of the National Viewers and Listeners Association who spoke of moral pollution through an intense censorship campaign. As Waters said “Why does she make such a fuss about everything if she isn’t motivated by fear? She’s frightened that we’re all being perverted. I was incensed by Mary Whitehouse, as I am by all book-burners and Bible-bashers: people who foster that sexual guilt and shame, who try and deny people any opportunity to fulfill their sexual destiny.”\n\nOf the sheep Waters had to say, “Sheep was my sense of what was to come down in England, and it did last summer with the riots in England, in Brixton and Toxeth, and it will happen again. It will always happen. There are too many of us in the world and we treat each other badly. We get obsessed with things, and there aren’t enough of things, products, to go ’round. If we’re persuaded it’s important to have them, that we’re nothing without them, and there aren’t enough of them to go ’round, the people without them are going to get angry. Content and discontent follow very closely the rise and fall on the graph of world recession and expansion.”\n\nAs “Shine On You Crazy Diamond” did on Wish You Were Here, “Pigs On The Wing” sandwiches the rest of the album by opening and closing it in two parts. The song tempers the rage on the rest of the album as it is a love song for Waters new wife, Carolyne Christie. Guitarist David Gilmour felt it was a good fit as he explained, “There are moments when real ear-splitting, abrasive sound is right and moments when it just isn’t. You try to make each piece of music fulfill its potential.”\n\nWith regards to the music, a couple of the songs had been developed when touring before Wish You Were Here was recorded, including “Raving And Drooling” which was reworked and reappeared as “Sheep” and “You’ve Got To Be Crazy” which became “Dogs”.\n\nLike The Dark Side Of The Moon, Pink Floyd use sound EFX to reinforce the lyrical content, this time complete with animal noises which are further played with by running them through vocoder and Leslie speakers.\n\nThe album cover was once again designed by Hipgnosis’ Storm Thorgeson and Aubrey Powell, but this time along with Roger Waters. It pictures a 30-foot inflatable pig tethered over Battersea Power Station in London. The shoot took three days to complete. On the first day they hired a marksman to shoot the pig if it broke free. They didn’t recall seeing him on day two when the pig broke free and sailed through Heathrow airspace and eventually landed in a Kent field whose farmer was furious it had scared his cows.\n\nWhen Animals was released in January 1977, it didn’t receive overwhelmingly great reviews. It came out during the punk and disco heyday, a time when Johnny Rotten had taken to wearing a Pink Floyd shirt on which he scrawled “I hate”.\n\nThis probably didn’t create a conducive setting and may have subconsciously influenced critics’ opinions of the album. They may have also been reacting to the band’s overwhelming success and their predilection for shunning the press (they didn’t even have a PR agent).\n\nHere is a bit of the Rolling Stone review: “For Pink Floyd, space has always been the ultimate escape. It still is, but now definitions have shifted. The romance of outer space has been replaced by the horror of spacing out… Animals is Floyd’s attempt to deal with the realization that spacing out isn’t the answer either. There’s no exit; you get high, you come down again. That’s what Pink Floyd has done, with a thud.”\n\nOnce again critics were proved wrong as Animals is many Floyd fans’ favourite. It is also interesting to note that Johnny Rotten’s position was slightly rocked when Floyd drummer Nick Mason later went on to produce The Damned’s 1977 album “Music For Pleasure”.\n\nAnd forty years later, it’s message continues to resonate.\n\nPink Floyd Animals (1977)\n\nFrom sputnikmusic.com\n\nOne of the greatest albums of all time – not only a musical accomplishment to the highest degree, Animals is also a scathing criticism of the system that spawned it.\n\nAnimals is Pink Floyd’s greatest album.\n\nSuch a statement will be forever refuted by those who fervently admire any of Pink Floyd’s other masterpieces; it’s arguable as to which album is the pinnacle of their success. Of course, it always comes down to a matter of opinion, but with this review I intend to ardently argue Animals’ case; not only as the greatest Pink Floyd album, not only as one of the greatest records to have ever been made, but also as a triumphant and pessimistic reflection of the world’s descent into capitalism.\n\nIn addition to the musical achievement that is Animals, it is a radiant and contemptuous piece of political literature, akin to its Orwellian influence. The metaphorical value of ‘Dogs’, ‘Pigs’ and ‘Sheep’ are extensively ingrained in the criticism of the society which we take for granted, and Animals eloquently lays down a sweeping mockery of the system. In regards to the album’s position amongst Pink Floyd’s far-reaching discography, Animals is situated in a transient period; bearing marks of the band’s psychedelic and drug infused past, building on the largely tentative previous two albums, all while paving the way for The Wall’s concreted concept.\n\nIt is because of this unique position that Animals holds as to why it is distinguishable from the Pink Floyd catalogue. It does not rely on musical oddities, vast soundscapes or experimentation; it is a composition perfect at its very core, from the pure genius of its songwriting, to a concept to beat all concepts in its relevance and societal value. Animals is, without a doubt, one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe profound left uprising of the 1970s is a large determinant of the ideology evident on Animals; the after effects of the Vietnam War, a stalemate between the opposing sides of the ideological spectrum, left the world in a disarray, seemingly disillusioned by the supposed sanctity of capitalism in contrast to the ‘Evil Empire’. Economic crises gripped Britain (along with other Western nations, but particularly Britain in respect to Pink Floyd), a pressure borne by the working class.\n\nIt was these conditions and others like them that ultimately led to the deep seeded cynicism apparent on Animals. The album’s construction is purely metaphorical: ‘Dogs’, ‘Pigs’ and ‘Sheep’ represent the different tiers in the capitalist hierarchy, each song creating a representation of its respective character through ingenious lyrics and at times, musical expressions that are reflective of a particular character’s nature. Beginning with ‘Dogs’, Pink Floyd paints the portrait of a ruthless and self-obsessed bourgeoisie, the hounds of the upper class.\n\nIn layman’s terms, businessmen, utilizing the free market system to their own and their superiors’ advantage; ultimately to the disadvantage of the lower classes, who are forced to bear the brunt of actions from the likes of H.E. Pennypacker, wealthy industrialist and philanthropist, an alias brought to life by Seinfeld’s Cosmo Kramer. Such a personality is immortalized in the lines:\n\nYou got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed\n\nAnd then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight\n\nYou gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking\n\nThe vehement scorn of Pennypacker and co. is brought to light after an atmospheric interlude, one which harkens back to the musical techniques more commonly associated with Pink Floyd’s past; the barking of dogs layered over a synthetic backdrop does well to set the mood and build up towards one of the greatest imaginable finales to a song. Cleverly using the metaphor of a dog, the song alludes to the action of tying a stone around a dog’s neck, subtly referring to the inevitable downfall that awaits the bourgeoisie.\n\nAnd when you lose control, you’ll reap the harvest you have sown\n\nAnd as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone\n\nAnd it’s too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around\n\nSo have a good drown, as you go down all alone\n\nDragged down by the stone\n\nChanging from the momentous disposition of ‘Dogs’, ‘Pigs (Three Little Ones)’ is ostensibly acerbic, sarcastic in its tone and vicious in its outset. Obviously representing the upper class, the cynicism is aimed at the absurdity of this class’ existence, and the seemingly unjust dessert that is bestowed upon them merely because of their position in society. Greedy, gluttonous and ignorant to the suffering of the proletariat, their place at the top of the social order is the subject of Pink Floyd’s ridicule.\n\nThe repeated line of ‘Ha ha, charade you are’, the obvious reference in ‘Hey you, Whitehouse / Ha ha charade you are … Mary you’re nearly a treat / But you’re really a cry’, and the derisive ‘You like the feel of steel / You’re hot stuff with a hatpin / And good fun with a hand gun’, are all worthy mentions of this song’s disdainful view of the upper class. The real world allusions it gives of the conservatives, through its reference to Mary Whitehouse, are cleverly cloaked in the album’s mordant tenor. The song’s discourse is complemented by its composition; the circus-like, almost irritating melody seems to epitomize the song’s likeness of the upper class.\n\nGilmour’s solo is superb, at times sounding like the babbling, or even the screaming, of pigs, adding yet more colour to the song’s portrait. Although being from an indeterminate source, it is said that the solo was played with a purposely modified and out of tune guitar, so much so that it cannot be replicated exactly. Not significant, but another detail that adds to the album’s distinctiveness. Gilmour closes the song in an epic fashion, not repeating any of the moods set in ‘Dogs’. Rather, his tasteful second solo that finishes the track tops off the insinuations already brought into the fold: a false grandeur, an artificial opulence, a corrupted prominence.\n\nThe last tier to be articulated is that of the proletariat, the working class. Not much elaboration is needed in determining why sheep are an ideal animal to portray this particular position in society. Holding up the capitalist pyramid, the weight of said system keeps the proletariat in place; easy pickings for the dogs and to the ultimate benefit of the pigs, the sheep are exploited for their obedience and coerced submission. ‘Sheep’, in contrast to the previous two songs, contains an inkling of hope. Although spelling out how the sheep are victims to the higher classes, the song moves towards an optimistic outlook, one in which the sheep break free of their shackles. This is expressed in one of history’s greatest lyrical moments:\n\nBleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream.\n\nWave upon wave of demented avengers\n\nMarch cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream.\n\nAn atmospheric mid-section precludes this ‘revolution’, one which builds up with the bleating of sheep, and bursts to life with a human scream. However, although optimistic, the use of the word ‘dream’ casts a shadow of doubt over such a revolution’s legitimacy, and whether it is really a realistic prospect that could lie at the end of capitalism’s lifeline. ‘Sheep’, while portraying the proletariat, also plays a pivotal role in describing the position of the church in a capitalist society. The aforementioned mid-section contains a speech where the church is implicated as a tool of the capitalist system, merely indoctrinating the proletariat and allowing the upper classes to further exploit the immobile masses.\n\nWith bright knives He releaseth my soul.\n\nHe maketh me to hang on hooks in high places.\n\nHe converteth me to lamb cutlets,\n\nFor lo, He hath great power, and great hunger\n\nWith ‘Sheep’, the album’s critique comes to an end. The significance of these three songs is immeasurable; through their various metaphorical constructs, they assemble a bleak and misanthropic outlook of the capitalist society. Musically and lyrically, the band deserves immense commendation; in a single album they’ve managed to create something parallel to great works like Orwell’s Animal Farm, the chief artistic influence behind Animals. In addition to this, the album is book ended by two short pieces, respectively ‘Pigs on the Wing’ Parts One and Two.\n\nEssentially, they are love songs; written by Waters for his wife at the time, they are brisk and simple, and apparently disconnected to the themes associated with the three main tracks. Nevertheless, Waters implies in these two tracks, particularly Part Two, of his previous exploits as a ‘dog’, and how he was somehow saved by his love for the woman in question. Touching pieces as they are, they are the icing on the cake to what is a fantastic concept; the world may be descending into madness, but if we all showed a little love and care for our fellow man, such an austere perspective of capitalism would not be needed.\n\nJust over thirty years have passed since Animals’ release. Nonetheless, its relevance has hardly subsided. The Iraq War, the recent global economic crisis, and the misdeeds of the Bush administration and their Western counterparts are crudely analogous to the conditions which created Animals. Politics is reactionary; with every rise in a particular ideology, an opposing ideology will always gain strength; for example, with every fascistic military junta in Turkey’s history, almost non-existent leftist groups would rise out of nowhere, as a counter to the authoritarian military rule.\n\nHistory has already proven to us that socialism cannot work; self interest is in our very nature, and hence naturally we are inclined towards a capitalist system where we have the opportunity to better our situation. It is my personal belief that Animals was not written as a precursor to the beginnings of a socialist revolution; it does, however, have a message aimed at the stark belief in the purely capitalist society, where minimalist government intervention leads to the oppression of the proletariat. This said belief maintains that capitalism merely reflects human nature, and this may be so, but this does not effectively justify the transgressions so vividly outlined in the album.\n\nThis review is by no means an advocate of socialism or of capitalism’s demise; simply a reflection of the criticisms found on Animals. The album’s political foresight is unbelievable; with the US presidential election occurring as I write, it’s hard not to draw comparisons. It is with this that I again state that Animals is Pink Floyd’s greatest album. A musical masterpiece, a literary work of genius, and a political tour de force, this album delves so deeply into the human psyche that it will leave you stunned. As an album, Animals is easily worth the mounds of hyperbolic claim that I give it; a piece of genius, and a genius that will never die."
