        "text": "Where Pink Floyd started and where they ended up are entirely different places. As one of the U.K.'s premier psychedelic bands, they pioneered a style and sound that influenced countless artists over the next several decades. Their discography is as wildly varied as any you'll find, with soundtrack albums, concept records and de facto solo LPs scattered among their catalog.\n\nAfter original leader Syd Barrett flamed out with a series of mental and drug-induced breakdowns, the band changed direction, slowly turning into one of progressive music's most accomplished and successful groups. They were also one of rock's most challenging acts in the '70s, but that didn't stop millions of fans from making them global superstars with such albums as The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, both multi-platinum chart-toppers.\n\nAs Pink Floyd's history grew, the relationships among the four remaining members slowly deteriorated, to the point where '80s albums like The Final Cut and A Momentary Lapse of Reason are essentially solo albums by, respectively, Roger Waters and David Gilmour. Still, their discography is one of rock's sturdiest, from the psychedelic masterpiece that kicked it all off in 1967 to the quiet ambient requiem they ended their career with in 2014."
