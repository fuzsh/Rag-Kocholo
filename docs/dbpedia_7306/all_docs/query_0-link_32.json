        "text": "Mr. Fielder had a bit of trouble getting his hands on this album for a proper review, but when he finally got it he gave it top marks. One of the great Floyd albums this one, making a top 3 placing in most charts around the world except for Finland (9) and Canada (12).\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that it is only certified for sales of 100.000 albums in the UK, which is only half the certied sales figures of Canada and only a quarter of the same figures in France. Something must surely be wrong with that number in the UK?\n\nRead on!\n\nPig deal!\n\nFloyd bring home the bacon\n\nThe Pink Floyd: “Animals” (Harvest SHUL 815) *****\n\nAlbum review by Hugh Fielder\n\nI WANNA tell you a story.\n\nThe release of a new Pink Floyd album is a major event in the rock calendar and the music press together with radio and television have been busy jostling for prime positions in anticipation of ‘Animals’ which was scheduled to hit the record shops in the latter part of January.\n\nWe should all have known better. Floyd albums seldom run to timetable and this time artwork problems on the sleeve (which will unite a pig with Battersea Power Station) have delayed the emergence of this vital piece of vinyl by a fortnight or more.\n\nWhich shouldn’t matter too much except that sundry radio DJ`s had already been given or acquired copies of the album and had arranged to preview it. And a special playback for the press had been arranged (at Battersea Power Station!) which caused eager editors to allocate space for a review this week. However, there were no advance copies of the album for distribution at the playback which caused great consternation. Did they seriously expect us to review the album on one listen? No. Actually they didn’t expect us to review it at all for the time being. But eager editors were not put off lightly, particularly on hearing that the album was to be previewed on the radio. Harvest compromised to the extent of offering reviewers one more listen to the album, as if two listens will be adequate to assess the product which has taken the Pink Floyd several months to perfect. Drastic situations call for drastic solutions and subterfuge in the form of bootlegging has been necessary to obtain a longer, if still woefully inadequate, perusal of the goods. Obviously the album`s delay caused problems for Harvest and the Floyd but they can`t really have expected the press to sit back quietly while the radio stations went ahead with their plans regardless. Even if copies of the record were not available it would have been just a few hours work to make cassettes available so that the music could have been heard with something approaching the care and attention that went into making it.\n\nI can but quote the words of Roger Waters on the first side of ‘Animals’ (acquired courtesy of Industrial Espionage Ltd again): I gotta admit that I’m a little bit confused/ Sometimes it seems to me as if I’m just being used’.\n\nAll of which is a lengthy preamble to saying that I haven’t been able to give ‘Animals’ the attention it deserves or to hear a pristine version of it at leisure so the following observations are initial reactions and the author reserves the right to stand on his head in a week or two if he wishes.\n\nBUT SOMEHOW I don’t think I will. The first impressions are encouraging enough. ‘Animals’ reveals a familiar Floyd that a significant proportion of the world’s record-buying public will identify without difficulty but at the same time there’s a sense of purpose and commitment through much of the album that was lacking on ‘Wish You Were Here’.\n\nSpearheading this revival are Dave Gilmour whose guitar has recovered its bite and aggression, and Roger Waters whose lyrics have been jerked back to reality and often have an unexpectedly sharp cutting edge.\n\nEssentially, ‘Animals’ contains three tracks with a short theme to open and close the album. At first sight that might seem to give the group plenty of space through which to roam but it’s a trap they steer clear of most of the time and the tracks are carefully structured to maintain impetus using the proven style that has become the Floyd’s special hallmark.\n\nA short acoustic introduction sets the album in motion with ‘Pigs On The Run (Part One)’. Two guitars provide a steady rhythm for a simple melody line which wonders ‘which of the buggers to blame’? Already the lyrics are showing their teeth.\n\nThe same guitars then switch to a faster tempo and we are into `Dogs’ which occupies the remainder of side one. The keyboards scarcely have time to make their presence felt before the vocals take over. The song may be a long one but the Floyd waste no time in getting stuck in. The song settles down to medium pace with prominent echo on the vocals to emphasise key words and Gilmour’s guitar slicing between the verses. Finally Gilmour gets his own break and dives into one of those classic sweeping guitar phrases that have characterised the last three Floyd albums. The song rolls forward resolutely until the final word of the next verse is echoed away to infinity and the keyboards and drums bend your ear with a constantly shifting pattern of sounds and rhythms. The two acoustic guitars return to pick up the song and guide it back to the main guitar theme and the group are now on course for the final verse with its laboured chords and repetitive phrases, pushing relentlessly on to the climax. Our guided tour round the farmyard continues with ‘Pigs (Three Different Ones)’ and after a short orgy of grunting a gentle circular keyboard phrase sets forth only to be broken by some raucous guitar chords. ‘Pigs’ is about aggression, musical and lyrical, in rather the same style as ‘Welcome To The Machine’ from `Wish You Were Here’ but now there is a greater sense of realism involved.\n\nThe three different pigs in question are a bloated wheeler dealer, a viscous sounding elderly lady and that protector of the nation’s moral welfare, Mary Whitehouse who gets the third verse all to herself:\n\n‘Hey you, Whitehouse\n\nHa ha charade you are.\n\nYou house-proud town mouse,\n\nHa ha charade you are.\n\nYou’re trying to keep our\n\nfeelings off the street\n\nYou’re nearly a real treat,\n\nAll tight lips and cold feet.\n\nAnd do you feel abused?\n\n(Deep breathing)\n\nYou gotta stem the evil tide\n\nAnd keep it all on the inside\n\nMary you’re nearly a treat\n\nMary you’re nearly a treat\n\nBut you’re really a cry’.\n\nMy sentiments entirely! And it’s good to see the Floyd putting themselves out on a limb once more.\n\nThe harsh vocals and instrumental work cools down between the second and third verses with a keyboard passage that develops a rather aimless drift at times but you know it will come back in the end and it does with the aforementioned Whitehouse verse. The song powers out on Glimour’s guitar while the grunts change to bleats to indicate that we are now ready for ‘Sheep’.\n\nAgain a soft, lilting keyboard passage leads us into the track, bubbling away with neat phasing while underneath Waters’ bass builds up one of those classic Floyd bass lines which explodes into the first verse.\n\nSuddenly the Floyd are firing on all cylinders and the effect is almost goose-pimply. The lyrics are more disembodied and less direct than what’s gone before but they are delivered with some force.\n\nWhen the break comes we delve back into the Floyd’s early repertoire for a heavy dose of ‘Careful With That Axe Eugene’ but the icing on the cake shows the degree of sophistication the group have attained over the intervening nine years.\n\nThe rocking bass line returns, as does the noisy flock of sheep and an atmospheric voice that intones ‘The lord is my shepherd…’ with some interesting changes that I’ll leave you to find out for yourself. Then the band put their collective foot hard down on the accelerator for the final verse and lengthy fade-out before ‘Pigs On The Wing (Part Two)’ re-appears to round the album off and set our musical and lyrical minds at resting with some words of comfort.\n\nThose on the search for new musical trends will probably criticise ‘Animals’ for failing to provide a great leap forward. They’ve slammed the previous two albums for exactly the same reason but the argument is pointless. The Floyd have hit a formula that appeals to millions of people around the world and I can’t see any of them being disappointed with this album.\n\nThe crunch of finding a phenomenally successful formula such as the Floyd have done comes when your musical policy starts being dictated by commercial considerations. They show no such tendency at present. Freed from the paranoia of having to produce a follow-up to ‘Dark Side Of The Moon’, the group have been able to relax in the studio once more and it shows. In doing so they’ve rediscovered the more abrasive side of their nature which puts `Animals’ ahead of its predecessor.\n\nFrom where I’m standing, that’s going forward and I’ll give it five.\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

But it’s not just any old new studio — it happens to belong to yer actual Pink Floyd — and at drummer Nick Mason’s invitation SOUNDS was able to pop in and get an exclusive look around a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThose who were hoping that Nick would talk about anything other than the new studio were in for a disappointment. He didn’t want to expound his current views on the cosmos, and he wasn’t giving away anything about the band’s future recording or live appearance plans at that time either. In fact, he seemed vaguely bored with the whole business of being regarded as a star from whose lips gems of wisdom spill, and was quite content to chat about the studio much as he might were he the architect who designed it rather than the musician who used it. His architectural background showing through, no doubt.\n\nAnyway, the first thing I discovered as I sat next to the grand piano, on a stool which was a little too high for comfortable note-taking, was that the studio is at the moment exclusively for the Floyd’s use, although it is hoped to run it on a slightly more commercial basis later on. I say ‘slightly more’ because, while the band would like to see the place earning some money, their chief concern is that it should be available for their use whenever they want it. They want, if you like, to be able to boot people out whenever it suits them, so they obviously can’t run it along the lines of normal commercial venture.\n\nBecause the studio is primarily for their use, there are a number of personalised features to be found in it. Nick explained: “The design criteria for the studio were related directly to our needs. For one thing the building also contains our PA store, lighting store, group office and workshop. Secondly, the place is designed to be operated by one person, with lining up and preparation kept to a minimum. For example, we’re using DBX instead of Dolby because it’s easier.”\n\nOne tends to assume that a band like the Floyd has limitless funds to pour into such a venture but, while the place isn’t exactly sparsely furnished (equipment and comfort-wise), neither is it noticeably lush. Does this, I asked Nick, therefore represent the state of the art in studio design?\n\n“Well it probably represents the state of the art in low budget studio design.” Really? You could have knocked me down with a feather. Low budget? The Floyd? My raised eyebrows spurred Nick into some amplification of his statement.\n\n“I mean it hasn’t got every wonderful innovation. After all it’s primarily for our use so we looked for a cheap system to fulfill most of our needs.”\n\nAnd what they found was equipment manufactured by the American company, MCI. It’s all off-the-shelf stuff and consequently much cheaper than custom-made equipment. The desk is an MCI 32-into-24 track, and the tape machines are MCI 24, 4 and 2 track, with three Revoxes and a Nagamichi cassette machine thrown in for good measure.\n\nFacilities include two stereo parametric eq, two digital delay lines and — through the PA company — access to phasers, flangers and the like.\n\nSitting in the studio, the place seemed to me to be remarkably cluttered with instruments and amps, mike stands and associated paraphenalia. But, I discovered, there’s a reason for this.\n\n“There is an attempt,” said Nick, “to leave the studio fully set up. It’s all part of trying to make it as quick and easy as possible to get results.” Yet a lot of the equipment the band uses for recording wasn’t even in the studio at the time. Nick’s maple Ludwig kit was upstairs and a couple of synthesisers were in the control room. Why the control room?\n\n“We put in a lot of lines so people can do stuff in the control room. We often prefer to do things that way, and again it makes it as easy as possible for one person to do everything.”\n\nQuite apart from the low cost of MCI equipment — Nick estimated it at 2/3 to 1/2 the cost of other makes — it has the advantage of being compact. Monitor controls, for example, are included in each desk module, the desk also has a unique mike/ tape/ remix selection system, and the tape autolocate has motion sensing logic so it goes straight back to the point you want on the tape and doesn’t overshoot. All useful, time saving features.\n\nBut of course equipment isn’t everything when it comes to studio design. Acoustics play an important role too and acoustic designer Ken Shearer looked at a number of ways of achieving the desired acoustic properties. It was decided that Lignacite brick would be used for the interior walls but apparently the results have been a little disappointing.\n\n“I’m afraid it’s not as good as we’d hoped, although the studio sounds quite quiet.” The walls of the control room had to be treated with baffles made up from a kind of sandwich of acoustic wadding and Rockwool before the desired sound levels could be obtained. Fortunately this doesn’t get in the way too much or detract seriously from the appearance of the walls, although Nick hinted that if he were doing it again, he’d probably take a closer look at the kind of solution that Westlake Audio (or Eastlake, as it is now) has applied in places like The Manor — walls lined with acoustically absorbent stone.\n\nWhen we talked, the band hadn’t really worked out in detail how the proposed semi-commercial operation would be organised.\n\n“We might set aside specific periods — say three weeks at a time — when it would be free for other bands. We’d probably charge about £40 an hour and get our custom by word of mouth.\n\nDo they plan to put in any of the comforts associated with some of the bigger commercial studios, like games room, bar, lounge etc?\n\n“Well we do have a kitchen, but as yet there’s no lounge. There are some other facilities but they’ll only be for us really. The problem about your own studio is that it’s a communal thing for you and you don’t really want it to be like a public waiting room.”\n\nOne gets the impression that privacy comes pretty high up on these lads’ list of priorities, and who can blame them, if they can afford it? In the long run it’s still probably cheaper for them to do it this way than spend a year at a time in somebody else’s studio.\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

I wish I could travel back in time and watch it all. Probably a little tame by todays standards for a show but still fascinating.\n\nRead on!\n\nDazzling side of the Floyd\n\nConcert review by Steve Clarke\n\nCOULD THEY DO it? Hadn’t Bowie found the going difficult the previous weekend when thrown to the mercy of the vast Earl’s Court exhibition hall? Would the giant arena gulp up these rock astronauts?\n\nYes, these were the questions the Floyd would answer tonight: a wet British night.\n\nOn the way to the gig the sellers of scarves and posters emblazoned with likenesses of the Floyd are noticed… by their absence. Floyd fans aren’t interested in substitutes. They want the real thing.\n\nOnce inside, the eye immediately catches sight of an over sized balloon hung from the ceiling to depict the moon. Either side of it are suspended silver balls; dope and incense are in the air and the crowd are getting impatient. A chick behind me mutters that it can’t be much fun sitting in the balcony. No, it can’t. But then this is the Pink Floyd and here they come…\n\nWhen 18,000 people cheer on their heroes it’s no whisper. Strange sounds erupt and we have lift-off. The drums are heavy and it sounds fine. How they make these sounds I’ll never know: it comes from the back, the front… everywhere. Nick Mason gets ferocious and strobe sparks appear from the drum-kit. Gilmour’s guitar sends shivers down the spine, up and down until they reach the roots of your hair.\n\nThere’s no standing on chairs. No aggro. The audience is quiet and attentive.\n\nThe lights change colour. Red, yellow and orange where they mix. With the smoke still rising the Floyd could be playing in a smouldering fire. Richard Wright’s Hammond comes to the front — or is it the back? Or the side? The guy could be playing right next to you. Oh, what a sound.\n\nNext, it’s “Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun”. Roger Waters puts his guitar down and bangs the gong. Red floodlights — white spot on Waters. The lights mesh to form a rainbow. The music reaches a climax and the gong bursts into flames. The sound is almost alive as it travels quadraphonically around this massive arena. — Then hypnotic rhythms of “Careful With That Axe, Eugene” follow. Waters whispers the vocals and horrifying screams fill the air. Smoke belches forth from above the Floyd`s heads.\n\nIt’s interval time and the Floyd are winning. A voice comes over the PA and we’re told unidentified flying objects are scheduled to arrive. They won’t harm us.\n\nWhat’s going to happen?\n\nNot long after, the heart-beat introduction to “Dark Side Of The Moon” is heard. People find their seats as the beating gets louder. Th-thud-th-thud-th-thud. The ‘moon’ is lit up and a voice out of nowhere screams “I’ve been mad for – years.” Maniac screaming. The lights go down and the Floyd are back in position. The sound is excellent and even more intense than on the record. It reaches the passage with the footsteps and the airport announcement. Lights start flashing everywhere. Blinding white searchlights scan the arena. Revolving orange lamps set in the top of the PA; frightening noises echo around the hall.\n\nAnd then it happened. Out of nowhere (it was launched from the far end of the arena) an aircraft flies the entire length of the hall and seemingly disappears into a cloud of orange smoke above the Floyd, stunned eyes following every inch of the flight path.\n\nNow that’s presentation.\n\nApplause and looks of disbelief. “Time” follows and the stadium is turned into an enormous hall of clocks and watches. Back to the music and, for “The Great Gig In The Sky”, the band are joined by three chick singers and a sax player. The ladies wail in ecstasy and Richard Wright plays beautiful quasi-classical piano.\n\n“Gig” is contrasted with the sheer funk of “Money”. Mr. Sax delivers a raunchy solo and it fills up the hall. Cathedral organ chords herald the way into “Us And Them”. Gentle pushing sax. The hall is once more filled with madman screams. Shooting rockets signify the end of the piece.\n\nThey encore with “One Of Those Days” which shows the band at their most powerful. More fireworks and it’s over.\n\nPeople are always saying “This is the best gig ever” so I won’t bother. But Floyd’s night at Earl’s Court was rock theatre at its best, music at its finest — and if that ain’t enough the night’s proceeds, and that of the previous nights, are being donated to Shelter. There’s a spirit in the sky.\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

You decide!\n\nRead on.\n\nFloyd: The Great Gig In The Sky\n\nAlbum review by Tony Stewart\n\nPINK FLOYD: “Dark Side Of The Moon” (Harvest).\n\nSince their performance of this work at the Brighton Dome last year, when, due to technical hitches, the piece fell apart half way through, the structure of “Dark Side Of The Moon” has developed considerably. Like an aircraft, or spaceship, it has been the subject of numerous modifications to enable lift-off. The result is what is aptly described by one of the cuts as The Great Gig In The Sky.\n\nMusically this album is not unsimilar to the style formulated with first, “Atom Heart Mother” and then “Meddle”, though thematically it’s stronger — on the most worldly of subjects: madness.\n\n“I`ve been mad for fucking years” says a voice as Nick Mason’s heart-beat drum starts “Speak To Me”. Bum-bum, bum-bum…\n\nThat in itself is an over simplification, because close inspection of Roger Waters lyrics in “Breathe” or “Money” reveal ties with the causes of lunacy or death from overwork, and to the separation of races or classes in “Us And Them”.\n\nWith the possibility of sounding a little high faluting, “Dark Side” is about life and the result is not too pretty a picture, particularly as suggested by “Eclipse”.\n\nProbably this is Floyd’s most successful artistic venture. Not only are the lyrics statements of opinion, usually quite discernable, but they’re enhanced by some clever tape and sound effects. And there are hideous mad-man laughs frequently recurring.\n\nThe music from “Speak To Me” oozes gracefully into the melody of “Breathe”, with the vocals swaying in a wondrous relaxed magic, to be followed by the hi-hat running assimulation of Mason. Then the airport announcement, and footsteps from speaker to speaker, and you feel you’re “On The Run”.\n\nA roar of thundrous electronics preludes, with clock ticking, “Time”. Which follows a mentronome tempo throughout, with some startling synthesiser effects that would not be misplaced during a half hour with Dr. Who.\n\nAlthough one may find musical similarities with the two previous sets, there is doubtless a development in form and structure, such as the way “Time” reeks of thick chords and the way the simple foundation is built with the female backing vocals.\n\nOr through a reprise of “Breathe”, and a gradual, unobtrusive transgression to that melody with Rick Wright’s pretty little piano lines, fluttering until the guitar creeps in.\n\nHere the structure becomes overworked because the basic simplicity of the bass line is completely repetitive, but because of the magnificent voice of Clare Torry it avoids losing one’s attention – which probably would have happened.\n\nFloyd, it would appear, are now widening their scope to provide new focal points. In the same way as these ladies boost the vocals, the sax blows of Dick Parry create an alternative lead to the guitar or keyboard. But the door of musical influences is slightly ajar, to allow in “Us And Them” and a vocal peak which is more akin to the Moody Blues than the Floyd.\n\nThat piece is preceded by a long instrumental build, designed for late-night listening and coffee-drinking, with the sax drifting around in the saucer. But I`ll bet by the time you`ve got to eating your After-Eight you`ll have spilt a lot of the beverage. Though the band climb slowly through “Brain Damage” and “Eclipse”, they once again reached a climax, and in a most annoying way they chop it. “There is no dark side to the moon really, as a matter of fact,” informs a voice, “it`s all dark”, Bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum…\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nA good transcript from an interview originally intended just for radio. Should be of interest for everyone that likes Pink Floyd and David Gilmour.\n\nRead on!\n\nThe Floyd tapes\n\nCapital DJ Nicky Horne talks to Pink Floyd`s Dave Gilmour\n\nThe Pink Floyd rarely give interviews so when Dave Gilmour guested last week on Nicky Horne’s ‘You’re Mother Wouldn’t Like It’ show on Capital Radio, we were intrigued. Capital have kindly given us permission to print this on the air chat which sheds some light on subjects previously obscured by clouds.\n\nNormally reclusive, Dave Gilmour stepped out of hibernation long enough to chat amiably with disc jockey Horne and later answer some audience phone-in questions. The guitarist also spoke of the possibility of a Pink Floyd British tour in November.\n\nNicky: The Pink Floyd have a great mystique. Do you think this mystique is magnified by the infrequency of interviews?\n\nDave: It’s an individual thing with us. There’s no policy about it. We haven’t got a group where no one goes and does anything. I don’t think anyone’s got any specific objections to doing interviews.\n\nBut the mystique is magnified.\n\nYes definitely but we have tried to break that down over the years, more in the last three years. That whole mystique thing is a burden because it isn’t what we are, isn’t what we want to be.\n\nDo you think the mystique has been perpetuated by the press?\n\nPartly that. Also in the mind of the public from what our beginnings were, the things that happened to the band in the first year or two was certainly something we perpetrated at the time.\n\nWas the image deliberate at the time?\n\nNo it wasn’t deliberate as an image but certainly everything one could associate with us had that mystique stamped all over it but I don’t think at that time anyone would have come right out and said we were fantastic space cadets or anything like that. That’s never been our idea of ourselves.\n\nI remember hearing that they played a Pink Floyd record on Juke Box Jury once and said something to the effect that it was such a lot of rubbish and the whole psychedelic thing wasn’t going to last.\n\nI wasn’t around at the time. I believe the guy that was saying the stuff at that time didn’t last long.\n\nI wanted to talk about your early career with the Floyd. You replaced the now legendary Syd Barrett. You did say that at one point you got very paranoid about your relationship with the band.\n\nNot my relationship with the band (laughs) my relationship with the audience.\n\nDid you find it difficult at that time to replace Mr. Barrett?\n\nDefinitely. I think probably anyone coming into a fairly well known band and having to follow in someone else’s shoes is quite hard to do.\n\nCause at that time you weren’t playing lead guitar.\n\nWell the theory was that I did but I didn’t play much lead guitar (laughs).\n\nIt must have been extremely difficult.\n\nYeah. Extremely difficult. Hardly what you would call orthodox.\n\nThere is a mythology about the Floyd. Were the early gigs that weird?\n\nI didn’t feel anything myself before I joined. After I joined they weren’t that strange. The idea was to make the shows a bit less strange. I’d only seen the band a couple times before that when they were still playing Bo Diddley.\n\nWhen did the departure from tradition take place?\n\nWhen I joined the band already had made that transition.\n\nThe band has always been described as being very insular within the rock business.\n\nPossibly a little less insular than people think. Certainly at that time we did go out and play with other bands on the same bill. We probably became more insular when that stopped.\n\n`Dark Side Of The Moon’ was one of the most phenomenal albums, in success terms, that you’ve ever done. Did you ever think it would still be in the charts?\n\nNo, but I thought it would do better than anything we’d done before, more likely to sell. The difference between that album and the others was fairly large.\n\nThe whole concept of ‘Dark Side Of The Moon’, people read so many things into it.\n\nAll psychological (laughs).\n\nHow do you protect yourself from the business pressures, the record company moguls?\n\nI don’t think about it myself. It’s not that tough on us. We laid it on the line from early on about what we want to do, our relationship to them. They market us but don’t press us into releasing more ‘product’.\n\nYou’re lucky to be in that position, to dictate.\n\nYes we are lucky but we have always done it like that. We`re lucky to maintain that position of power from the beginning. It’s an impossibility for most bands.\n\nUnlike most bands, with the Floyd you feel that the studio becomes part of the art form.\n\nWe don’t believe in the ethic of just setting down the music as we play it onstage. You use whatever facilities you have to the limit. We never try to strip the pieces of music down to something we think we’ll be able to play onstage. We do it the other way round. We record first and worry about reproducing it after. You can certainly find a way.\n\nThere have been criticisms that the music is contrived.\n\nI can’t conceive of that. It’s all down to the person. Music is whatever you want to call it… sound, or whatever. Everything, like guitars, tape recorders, studios are all just means of reproducing sounds from inside your head. I only worry about being able to transmit what is inside your head to other people.\n\nWe were talking about that classic line in ‘Have a Cigar’…”Oh by the way which one’s Pink?” The whole song is obviously a satirical look at the rock business.\n\nWell we always look at it as a joke but it used to be fairly common line that got asked to us by interviewers and joe-publics. Not so much recently, I guess they know. They really used to ask that.\n\nWe’ve been discussing the type of songs the band put out and mostly they’re about people’s brains.\n\nWhat else is there?\n\nBut you rarely talk about love.\n\nI think you could find a few if you looked for them, you’ve played one already tonight that’s about love from ‘Obscured By Clouds’. Seems to me that one’s about love, mind you I’d have to ask Rog.\n\nPure love is rarely featured.\n\nWell it’s rarely focused on by a lot of people but there are quite a few if you look at them.\n\nBut they’re not obvious love songs.\n\nWell they’re the one’s people look upon, and we do sometimes, as kind of throw-away things that are there. None of the tracks you call definitive are in that vein.\n\nWe’ve had huge arguments about what exactly to do on some of those soundtrack albums and other albums. Some of us thought we should just put songs on them, others thought we should turn the whole thing into one subject concept for the whole album. That’s the way they worked out.\n\nRoger has certainly got a bit of an obsession about making the whole album into a one subject deal, into what you might call a concept album.\n\nDo you hate the word ‘concept’?\n\nIt’s a bit jaded, isn’t it?\n\nA lot of people have been ringing up, asking when the Floyd are going to tour?\n\nI think we are planning on touring Europe, I don’t know whether that includes England or not, probably does. Towards the end of the year, November or December.\n\nWith ‘Wish You Were Here’ some of the reviews said you were finished, run out of ideas, and you were on the decline. What did you think about all that?\n\nQuite frankly all criticism hurts but not so much that we are liable to give up. I guess they’re entitled to their own opinion. I don’t think we’ve run out of ideas, I think we’ve got a long run in front of us but you never know. I’ve got plenty of ideas and I’m sure all the others have got plenty of ideas.\n\nWill the Floyd ever individually be doing solo albums?\n\nAt this point there are centainly things within each of us that we find we can’t do within the Pink Floyd set-up. Most of us, all of us, at some point will do solo albums because we’ll feel that we have to. I’m certain about Roger and certain about myself.\n\nWith any four people there are going to be compromises and restrictions on what you do and while that is fine, in the end there are things that you need to do without compromise with other people, so certainly at one point solo albums will have to happen.\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.
