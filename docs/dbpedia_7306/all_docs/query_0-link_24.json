        "text": "\"Astronomy Domine\" Song by Pink Floyd Track 1 on the album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn Released August 4, 1967 Recorded April 11 - 13, 1967 Genres Psychedelic rock • space rock Studio Abbey Road Studios Length 4:12(Piper)\n\n8:32(Ummagumma)\n\n4:20(Pulse)\n\n5:02(Live in Gdańsk) Label EMI Columbia (UK)\n\nTower (US) Vocalists Syd Barrett • Richard Wright Songwriters Syd Barrett Producers Norman Smith\n\n\"Astronomy Domine\" (alternative \"Astronomy Dominé\") is a psychedelic rock song by the English rock band Pink Floyd. It is the opening track on most releases of their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). The song was written by original frontman and guitarist Syd Barrett some time from late 1966 to early 1967[1] and is sung by him and keyboardist Richard Wright. The working title of the track was \"Astronomy Dominé (An Astral Chant), and the word \"domine\" in the title is the Latin vocative of \"Lord\"; as such, the full title may be translated as \"An Astral Chant to the Lord\".\n\nAstronomy Domine is one of a few early Pink Floyd tracks credited with cementing the band's legacy as one of the original space rock bands.\n\nMusic[]\n\nAlternative versions and live performances[]\n\n\"Astronomy Domine\" was played regularly in concert from 1967 until it was dropped in mid-1971. The first known time it was played was on October 14, 1966 at All Saints Church Hall in London[2]. The last time the song was played with bassist Roger Waters was on June 20, 1971, at PalaLottomatica (then known as Palazzo dello Sport) in Rome, Italy[3]. 143 performances of the song by Pink Floyd have been documented prior to its revival in 1994, after which it was played another 91 times; in total, 234 live performances of \"Astronomy Domine\" by the band have been documented.[4]\n\nUmmagumma[]\n\nA live version of the track, performed by the post-Barrett band with David Gilmour, can be found on the first half of the 1969 double album Ummagumma. It was one of the four \"fan favorite\" tracks chosen for inclusion on the live half of the album. This version of the song is over twice the length of the original, clocking in at 8:32 in comparison to the original's runtime of 4:12. This performance features Gilmour in place of Barrett on guitar and vocals. To extend the song's length, the first verse is repeated twice, followed by a lengthy instrumental section as a merge of the psychedelic and progressive styles of the band at the time.\n\nPulse[]\n\nAlthough the song had been dropped from their live set in mid-1971, it was brought back 23 years later as the opening song from some performances on the band's 1994 tour of The Division Bell. This performance features as the second track on the Pulse live album and is very similar to the original studio version of the song from 1967. It is the only song on the album to feature no backing musicians, although touring band member Guy Pratt is present on the bass and vocals.\n\nPersonnel[]\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn version\n\nSyd Barrett - lead and slide guitar (Fender Esquire), low vocals\n\nRichard Wright - Farfisa organ, high vocals\n\nRoger Waters - bass guitar\n\nNick Mason - drums\n\nPeter Jenner - spoken word intro\n\nUmmagumma live version\n\nDavid Gilmour - guitar, high vocals\n\nRichard Wright - Farfisa organ, low vocals\n\nRoger Waters - bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nNick Mason - drums\n\nPulse live version\n\nDavid Gilmour - guitar, vocals\n\nRichard Wright - keyboards, vocals\n\nNick Mason - drums\n\nGuy Pratt - bass guitar, vocals\n\nLive in Gdańsk live version\n\nDavid Gilmour - guitar, vocals\n\nRichard Wright - keyboards, vocals\n\nGuy Pratt - bass\n\nJon Carin - keyboards, vocals\n\nSteve DiStanislao - drums\n\nPhil Manzanera - guitar\n\nSources[]"
