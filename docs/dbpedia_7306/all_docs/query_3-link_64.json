        "text": "The Machine Performs Pink Floyd, one of the most influential progressive-rock cover bands presently touring, is performing at Howelsen Hill Saturday in the most recent show of the Steamboat Free Summer Concert lineup.\n\nThe evening will begin with openers Worried Men at 6:00 p.m. TMPPF will play two sets after taking the stage at 7:30 p.m.\n\nJohn Waldman, of Great Knight Productions, called the group “one of the best Pink Floyd tribute acts touring today”.\n\nThe concert will mark the first time that TMPPF performs in the Yampa Valley. Despite that fact, they have heard of the strong love of music that exists in the community.\n\n“I got the feeling that there is that musical element to being in Steamboat,” said Tahrah Cohen, who is one of the group’s co-founders.\n\nTMPPF was founded in 1988 by Tahrah Cohen and the late Joe Pascarell in an attempt to carry on the spirit and sound of the original band.\n\n“The music is timeless,” said Cohen. “It’s not caught up in a period. It speaks to everyone. The lyrical content is about life, and death, and isolation, and beauty, and pain. It’s just universal music and sonically it’s very interesting with the textures and sounds.”\n\nThe group currently consists of Tahrah Cohen on drums, Scott Chasolen on keys and vocals and Ryan Ball on guitar and vocals. The newest member of the group, Chris DeAngelis, plays bass while also contributing to the group’s vocal range. Cohen and Ball have known each other since high school. Originally a bass player, Ball transitioned to playing the guitar in the band in 2013 after Pascarell temporarily stepped away.\n\nPascarell passed away in 2022, which led to Ball taking on the lead guitar role permanently.\n\nCohen began her musical career in fourth grade, when she first took drumsticks in hand. By sixth grade, she had purchased her first drum set and by the age of 13, she was playing with several different bands. Her progression as a musician led to her taking lessons and expanding her artistic contributions to a wide variety of different music groups.\n\n“The Machine has always been my steady since we started in 1988,” said Tahrah. “We’ve been at it for almost 36 years. We are excited about how this music sounds.”\n\nWhile many of the band members have other groups that they play with, TMPPF generally comes together sixty times a year to play their tribute shows.\n\n“We’re very active,” said Cohen when discussing the band’s energy. “We’re musicians and we play in original music acts and everyone also writes their own music.”\n\nSince the beginning, the group has successfully recreated the broad cannon of Pink Floyd classics around the world. Dark Side of the Moon, which was released by Pink Floyd in 1973, is an album that TMPPF enjoys performing in its entirety due to the level of its lyrical content, the high caliber of the guitar playing, and what Cohen described as the overall power of the music.\n\n“Performing it as musicians, it’s very satisfying,” said Cohen. “The crowd can feel the energy coming from the stage, feel our energy, feel our passion and authenticity towards recreating this music pretty faithfully.”\n\nCohen explained that there was no intention among the founders for the band to endure for as long as they have and that there was no goal to become one of the world’s biggest, and most notorious, Pink Floyd cover bands. In the beginning, Pink Floyd was only a small part of the music that TMPPF played. Over time, however, the evolution of their energy and talent lent itself more and more to covering the iconic progressive and psychedelic rock giants.\n\n“We just started the band out of a love of music and out of a love of playing with your friends…and making music with your friends,” said Cohen. “Pink Floyd was just what people took a real interest in. It was not an intention. It was just something that we did because we loved it.”"
