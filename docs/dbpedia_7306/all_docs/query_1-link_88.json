        "text": "Pink Floyd – The Endless River\n\nFebruary 10, 2019\n\nALBUM REVIEW\n\nOVERALL (OUT OF 10): 1\n\nOddly enough, Pink Floyd’s final studio album is much like the Puritan conception of God as described in the Westminster Confession of Faith, in that it is wholly “without body, parts, or passions”. It is comprised of formless, shapeless, shallow little snippets of music devoid of anything even remotely resembling human emotion. If the album is the final tribute to Rick Wright that it was advertised to be, the rest of Pink Floyd must not have liked him all that much. Wright passed back in 2008, and I suppose the cover of the album is intended to convey the idea that he is rowing a boat to that Great Gig in the Sky – or perhaps the cover was meant was a warning to fans that the music inside was like the clouds surrounding Rick on his journey to the unknown – airy, immaterial, slight, and substanceless.\n\nI was as excited as anybody when I heard Pink Floyd was releasing an album in 2014, although the excitement was tempered somewhat by the knowledge that the album consisted of leftovers from The Divison Bell, hardly the high point of the band’s legendary career. And sure enough, it sounds like scraps of undeveloped musical ideas leftover from The Division Bell sessions. Imagine an album consisting of nothing but short versions of “Cluster One” and “Marooned” and suchlike in rudimentary form, and that is pretty much what you get.\n\nOf course, tons of reviewers fell all over themselves praising it, because that’s what reviewers do when burnt out rockers release lackluster new albums. Some of them went so far as to compare it to the band’s early experimental albums before Dark Side of the Moon made their unique brand of cerebral pop not only eminently commercial, but reliably bankable. Ultimate Classic Rock’s reviewer Michael Gallucchi opined “…and if it has more in common with the band’s post-Syd Barrett, pre-superstardom records than the mid-’70s epics that turned on millions of headphones-wielding fans, that’s sorta the point, too.” Allmusic’s Stephen Thomas Erlewine waxed excessively grandiloquent, gushing that\n\n“…it is one of the most popular bands of the 20th century returning to slowly pulsating aural waves that characterized their biggest albums — the very shift away from vocals realigns the band with not only Wish You Were Here (which this often resembles) but their pre-Dark Side records for Harvest, undercutting the arena-pleasing aspirations of the Gilmour-led reunion while underscoring how Pink Floyd always were an arty band at their core.”\n\nUh, no. It sounds nothing like Wish You Were Here, and anyone who has actually listened to those “pre-Dark Side records for Harvest” knows The Endless River couldn’t be more unlike them. For one, most of The Endless River songs exude the aura of vaguely New Agey 21st century elevator music – if most of them played while I was on hold on the phone with my dentist’s office, they wouldn’t seem at all out of place. It is Muzak Floyd, and there was absolutely nothing Muzak about Ummagumma or Atom Heart Mother or Meddle or Wish You Were Here – those albums are poles apart from The Endless River (pardon the Floydism there). They don’t even sound like they were made by the same band.\n\nWhat’s more, those old Floyd albums took time to unravel and explore their musical ideas – “Atom Heart Mother” and “Echoes” both took up an entire side of an LP, and “Shine On You Crazy Diamond” would have if they hadn’t broken it in half and put the others songs in the middle of it. There was a commitment to taking as long as needed to let a song slowly unfurl at its own pace, the willingness to give it time to ebb and flow and crescendo and fade – the songs on The Endless River are uniformly short, many little more than a minute, and with too few musical ideas to fill even so little time. Many of the songs originally on The Division Bell sprang from Gilmour, Wright, and Mason endlessly jamming in the early 90s, and they came up with a plethora of little snatches of musical phrases, undeveloped and embryonic. The best were worked over to become some of the songs on The Division Bell. The rest were left in their immature state, and for the 2014 album rather than take the time to really make something of them, the last Floyds left standing overdubbed a few additional instruments here and there and some sound effects and voila – a new Pink Floyd album, and with little to no effort required. I am struck at what a lazy effort this is. And the unfleshed out musical sketches on The Endless River weren’t even the most promising of the jam session snippets, the best ones got developed and enhanced and worked on and shaped into the songs on The Division Bell. The ones on The Endless River weren’t considered worthy of much thought or development at the time, and only after a twenty year drought of new Pink Floyd music did anyone consider releasing them, when fans were starved enough to snap up anything. Some of these “songs” – and I use the word very loosely – are pretty blatantly lazy. “On Noodle Street” is honesty in advertising, it really is just the three of them noodling around with some pointless jamming that goes nowhere. “Night Light” is one minute and forty-two seconds of completely forgettable keyboard texture. There’s almost a danger of an actual song breaking out in “Anisina”, but it never quite gets there, at best sounding like maybe the instrumental backing to a demo of a real song.\n\nBut where The Endless River most deeply and treacherously betrays the spirit of the old Harvest albums is in the construction of the songs. “A Saucerful of Secrets” may have sounded somewhat random and spontaneous, but it wasn’t. David Gilmour had just joined the band when they recorded it, and he talked about how Roger Waters and Nick Mason, former architecture students, had drawn out a blueprint for the song. It didn’t just emerge from a jam, there was thought put into the building of the structure of the song. According to David Gilmour:\n\n“’A Saucerful’ was inspired when Roger and Nick [Mason, Pink Floyd’s drummer] began drawing weird shapes on a piece of paper. We then composed music based on the structure of the drawing.”\n\nBoth of them approached the development of the song much as they would have designed a building. It wasn’t random, pointless jamming – it was purposeful, created according to an artistic conception, following a previously thought-out design. The only commonality between “A Saucerful of Secrets” and any of the songs on The Endless River is that they are instrumentals – beyond that any similarity ends. “Atom Heart Mother” was no halfhearted jam – they had to score orchestra parts for it, a lot of work and consideration and sweat went into that song, as opposed to “The Lost Art of Conversation” which sounds like Rick Wright stumbled onto five seconds of moderately interesting keyboard rambling and figured that was all he had in him to give it.\n\n“Autumn ‘68” is just Rick Wright playing a simple, uninteresting keyboard figure on the pipe organ at the Royal Albert Hall – given he was using such a marvelous instrument in such a legendary venue, you’d think he would have come up with something more befitting the occasion, rather than the tossed off little bit of keyboard frippery he probably came up with right there on the spot. And that brings up another point – some reviewers have tried to make it sound like The Endless River is some kind of showcase of Rick Wright’s musical genius (Rolling Stone magazine, ever impeccable and inerrant its its musical judgment, published reviewer David Fricke’s assessment that “Wright was the steady, binding majesty in the Floyd’s explorations. This album is an unexpected, welcome epitaph.”). But if anything, it threw into sharp relief his limitations as a keyboardist – in the 60s and 70s, when the use of keyboards in popular music was just emerging, he was great at texture, at atmosphere, at ambience. He was able to find particular sounds that enhanced the musical ideas that the Floyd was trying to put across in a song. He was never a virtuoso, completely lacking in the skill required for flashy playing or impressive technique. His parts were always appropriate to the song, but never awe-inspiring in their execution. In terms of sheer musicianship, virtually any other keyboard player in any other band had him beat. However, he fit in perfectly with Pink Floyd’s sound in a way that a Jon Lord or a Mike Pinder never could have. But coming up with fresh keyboard sounds in 1968 was one thing – doing it in the early 90s was a whole other kettle of fish, and by the time these songs were released in 2014, there was little hope he’d produce anything groundbreaking. And sure enough, he didn’t. So much of it sounds very 90s adult contemporary, a universe away from the rich textures and sonic palettes he employed in the 60s and 70s on Floyd’s classic albums. His legacy as a musician would have been far better off had this album not been released.\n\nFrom time to time on the album there are feeble attempts to revisit old glories. “Talkin’ Hawkin” recycles the Stephen Hawkin quote from “Keep Talking” and doesn’t manage to get much more mileage out of it. “Allons-y” 1 & 2 sound suspiciously like “The Last Few Bricks” from the live shows of The Wall. But mostly our three intrepid Floydians sound like they are trying to be Brian Eno and failing at generating anything that holds your interest. Even the three of them weren’t interested enough in the songs to give them much more than a minute or so of life. In 1971 “Echoes” unfolded over 21 absorbing, entrancing minutes – most of these songs exhaust what little interest they held in less than a minute, and Gilmour, Wright, and Mason are perfectly happy to let them peter out soon thereafter. On “Skins” Mason found a single drum pattern he liked, which he played over and over until after a minute or so he apparently got bored with it, and that’s the song. That’s all there is to it.\n\nThe low point of the whole album is the one time when they actually bother to put together a song, with lyrics even, on “Louder than Words”. And it’s enough to make you grateful they didn’t put lyrics to any of the rest of them: “It’s louder than words/This thing that we do/Louder than words/The way it unfurls/It’s louder than words/The sum of our parts/The beat of our hearts/Is louder than words/Louder than words/Louder than words/This thing they call soul/Is there with a pulse/Louder than words/Louder than words…”. Blech. That’s awful. If there was ever an argument to be made that they really needed Roger Water’s lyrics, that’s it right there.\n\nGilmour, of course, is probably the most melodic lead guitar player the world has ever known. I consider his solo at the end of “Fat Old Sun” on Live in Gdansk to be the most spectacular lead guitar playing I have ever heard, an aural compendium of everything that made Gilmour such a great guitar player. It is unthinkable that’s he’d play on an album and not have some moments of guitar brilliance, and of course he gets some in here. But without substantial songs to pin them to, even his best parts on the album ring kind of empty and hollow. His greatest solos always enhanced Pink Floyd’s songs. His solo on “Time” expresses nihilism, emptiness and futilty in a way that goes beyond mere words, and his immortal solo on “Comforably Numb” takes the lost wonder and bygone innocence of the chorus to a whole new level. On The Endless River, the solos have nothing to enhance – without a message, or an emotion of some kind to communicate, his playing has nothing really to hang on to. It’s just empty decoration, pleasing but meaningless. There’s just nothing in the songs for his solos to take to the next level.\n\nI have to give some reviewers their due, not every rock critic gave in to the urge to heap praises on this schlocky piece of New Agey product. In Pitchfork, Stephen M. Deusner wrote “As The Endless River threatens to live up to its title, the music veers into aimless, repetitive noodling, and the band settle for formless ambience rather than exactingly sculpted songs.” In The Independent, Andy Gill nailed the album pretty well, complaining that it was “just aimless jamming, one long thread of Dave Gilmour’s guitar against Rick Wright’s pastel keyboards and Nick Mason’s tentative percussion, with nary a melody of any distinction alighted upon for the duration …. without the sparking creativity of a Syd or Roger, all that’s left is ghastly faux-psychedelic dinner-party muzak.” In the Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood labeled it “excruciatingly dull” – and he’s got that right. So this time around not everyone jumped on the “five stars for the classic rock superstars of old” bandwagon, and I respect those critics who were willing to call a spade a spade.\n\nThe Endless River is a shabby, tattered, lazy, careless end to one of the greatest discographies in the annals of rock. The Division Bell was no masterpiece, but it at least had moments of grandeur, glimpses of the old Floyd, a few really great songs, and a suitably epic finale in “High Hopes”. The Endless River is Pink Floyd cotton candy, fluffy, insubstantial and unsatisfying. It is an tepid collection of uninspired musical doodles by a group of musicians who were capable of so much more. Even without Roger Waters, they could still make music worth listening to on occasion – but this is nothing more than scraps they left on the cutting room floor while they were making The Division Bell. And it isn’t as though David Gilmour had lost the ability to make great music in 2014, Rattle That Lock was released the next year and had some fantastic songs on it. He just couldn’t be troubled with making great music here.\n\nTheologically, I was always mystified by something that could be “without body, parts, or passion”, and could never conceive what that would even be like. After years of wondering, Pink Floyd finally showed me what it would be like, and I’ve decided I really don’t care for it. Good thing I’m not a Puritan.\n\n“The Endless River has as its starting point the music that came from the 1993 Division Bell sessions. We listened to over 20 hours of the three of us playing together and selected the music we wanted to work on for the new album. Over the last year we’ve added new parts, re-recorded others and generally harnessed studio technology to make a 21st century Pink Floyd album. With Rick gone, and with him the chance of ever doing it again, it feels right that these revisited and reworked tracks should be made available as part of our repertoire.” – David Gilmour\n\n“Well then we’re damn lucky it’s the only 21st century Pink Floyd album, because apparently 21st century Pink Floyd albums suck pretty bad. They listened to 20 hours of jamming and picked these songs? I cant even imagine how boring and uninspired the ones they didn’t pick must have been, because the ones they selected for the album were bland enough.” – Brutally Honest Rock Album Reviews"
