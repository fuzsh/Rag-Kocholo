Explore rare studio sessions and electrifying live performances, each a shimmering fragment of the band's metamorphosis in 1968-1969.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nMGDC 015LP\n\nThis concert was the first time that Pink Floyd were able to perform the whole of what became the Dark Side of The Moon album in its entirety, the previous night's performance in Brighton having been halted for technical reasons. Remarkably, at its first full live performance at the Guildhall in Portsmouth, England on 21st January 1972, most of the album was in the form it would be when released 14 months later.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nPFRLP7\n\nReissue, originally released in 1972. 180 gram vinyl. \"Obscured by Clouds is the soundtrack to the Barbet Schroeder film La Vall√©e, and it plays that way. Of course, it's possible to make the argument that Pink Floyd's music of the early '70s usually played as mood music, similar to film music, but it had structure and a progression. Here, the instrumentals float pleasantly, filled with interesting textures, yet they never seem to have much of a purpose. Often, they seem quite tied to their time, either in their spaciness or in the pastoral folkiness, two qualities that are better brought out on the full-fledged songs interspersed throughout the record. Typified by 'Burning Bridges' and 'Wot's...uh the Deal,' these songs explore some of the same musical ground as those on Atom Heart Mother and Meddle, yet they are more concise and have a stronger structure. But the real noteworthy numbers are the surprisingly heavy blues-rocker 'The Gold It's in The...,' which, as good as it is, is trumped by the stately, ominous 'Childhood's End' and the jaunty pop tune 'Free Four,' two songs whose obsessions with life, death, and the past clearly point toward Dark Side of the Moon. ('Childhood's End' also suggests Dark Side in its tone and arrangement.)...\" --Stephen Thomas Erlewine, AllMusic\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nMGDC 012LP\n\nPink Floyd, live at Concertgebouw, Amsterdam on September 17, 1969.

It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock. It has also been described as an experimental and psychedelic as well as an example of proto-prog. Waters once called the song \"an abstract piece\". Not connected to pop music, a long improvisatory quality. The stereo version of the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker, the effect is not on the mono version of the song, where it gains extra organ and guitar sounds, in fact the organ is very prominent during the first minute of the mono version-along with some special effects-but inaudible in the stereo mix. You will find both mono and stereo versions off the LP plus a rare edit (French only released at the time) and a long freak out version that clocks in at 16:49.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nNK 202101LP\n\nLimited restock.

This well-recorded performance captures Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason in their very early post-Syd Barrett era; the time when the band was busy trying to reinvent themselves after the crucial split with genius Syd Barrett. This was even before the release of their second album, when Waters and Co. really began to extend the classic three/four-minute song format towards longer and more open sound forms. A marvelous track list including seminal compositions and psychedelic manifestos such as \"Astronomy Domine\", \"Set The Control For The Heart Of The Sun\", and \"Interstellar Overdrive\" all great sparks for visionary instrumental progressions and far-out improvisations. The album ends with an excerpt of Roger Water's voice from a radio interview broadcast.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nNK 201901LP\n\nPink vinyl. Performing on four different dates in 1968, just prior to and following the release of their legendary second LP, A Saucerful of Secrets, this is Pink Floyd at their early psychedelic peak. The first two tracks come from live shows in London at the Barnes Common and East Stratford at the Abbey Mills Pumping Station, recorded live for the BBC programs The Sound of Change and All My Loving, respectively. The four tracks from June 25th were recorded in-studio at the BBC's own Piccadilly Studios for the classic program, Top Gear, and finally, all of side B comes from an amazing December 2nd set from BBC's Studio 4, BBC Maida Vale Studios, in London, again for Top Gear. This is essential live recordings of Pink Floyd during their greatest era.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nNK 201801LP"
