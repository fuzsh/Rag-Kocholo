        "text": "I won’t make any bones about this, because Pink Floyd has always been one of my favourite bands. Even before I really knew their music, I knew that they represented the UK underground to a huge degree. They had been a house band for the original Summer of Love Happenings and had been regulars on the bill at the UFO club. Pink Floyd was the psychedelic sound of 1966-67 London, very much doing what The Grateful Dead were doing in San Francisco.\n\nThe band had its origins in 1963-63 when several young architecture students at what was the the London Polytechnic started playing music together. That original two were Nick Mason on drums and Roger Waters on guitar with a floating group of students filling in. They were later joined by Richard Wright, a keyboards player who also played guitar. They went through many name changes, recruiting another guitarist, Bob Klose along the way, with Waters switching to bass. By mid-1964, they were called The Tea Set and around this time they were joined by another guitarist, Syd (actually Roger) Barrett. Waters and Barrett had known one another since childhood in Cambridge. Later Floyd member David Gilmour was another Cambridge friend of Barrett’s.\n\nWith a settled lineup of frontman Barrett, rhythm section of Mason and Waters and Wright on keyboards the band began gigging in London as The Pink Floyd Sound. Starting out with a live set of mostly R ‘n’ B, Barrett and Wright began experimenting and the songs stretched out into long improvisations. It was a sound that suited the psychedelic underground of 1966-67 perfectly. Managed by Pete Jenner and Andrew King, who operated as Blackhill Enterprises, the band’s reputation grew and by 1967 were signed to EMI as Pink Floyd. The band’s first single, “Arnold Layne” soon followed. Despite its somewhat controversial subject matter, a degree of legerdemain saw the single get into the Top 20. It was soon followed by a second single, “See Emily Play“, which got to Number 6 in June 1967 and Pink Floyd appeared on Top Of The Pops.\n\nThe band’s first LP, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, recorded in early 1967 and produced by Norman Smith, was released in August and became a Top 10 album in the UK, just missing out on the Top 5.\n\nPiper showcased two sides of Pink Floyd. There were shorter songs, with a particularly whimsically- English psychedelic quality, such as “Flaming” “The Gnome” and “Bike” and more experimental pieces which were very much based on their live shows, with the epic “Interstellar Overdrive” running to over nine minutes, including a largely-improvised “spacey” middle section. Syd Barrett was responsible for most of the songwriting. His song “Astronomy Dominé” would become a cornerstone of the band’s live set.\n\nSadly, Syd wasn’t really doing very well on a personal level. He was a massive user of psychedelic drugs, mainly LSD and his behaviour became increasingly erratic and bizarre. Nick Mason, in his 2005 book, Inside Out later described Barrett as “completely distanced from everything going on”. The reality was that Barrett was suffering from severe mental health issues, brought on by his excessive use of drugs. By the end of 1967, Cambridge pal David Gilmour was recruited as a second guitarist. Syd was just too much of a liability. The band never knew which Syd would turn up. He could be catatonic on stage or just play with his guitar out of tune, or maybe not even turn up at all. By the beginning of 1968, the band stopped picking him up on the way to gigs. Officially still in the band until midway through 1968, and appearing on parts of the band’s second album, A Saucerful Of Secrets, Barrett seemed to be somewhere else. Finally, he was; out of the band. Barrett’s departure saw managers Jenner and King leave too. They thought that Barrett was the musical genius and that the band were nothing without him.\n\nI’m not going to dwell on the drawn-out tragedy of Syd Barrett and how the other members of the band handled the situation. Suffice to say, Barrett, no longer in Pink Floyd was always in the collective psyche of Pink Floyd.\n\nWithout Barrett, the band struggled to find a way forward. Leaving the soundtrack album More aside for a moment, the band’s next official album, A Saucerful Of Secrets saw Waters and Wright shouldering the writing workload and the album only contained one Barrett song, the album’s closer “Jugband Blues“, which is a truly poignant farewell to Syd, the musical spark in the early Pink Floyd. In Syd’s words;\n\n“It’s awfully considerate of you to think of me here\n\nAnd I’m most obliged to you for making it clear\n\nThat I’m not here.“\n\nthere is obvious pain, sadness, anger and other inchoate emotions.\n\nElsewhere on Saucerful, we see the band pursuing their “space rock” live sound on the opening “Let There Be More Light“, the mysterious “Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun” and the multi-part title track, the latter two songs remaining live staples until just before the band’s stadium rock era in the mid-1970s. Saucerful also has Rick Wright’s lovely “Remember A Day“.\n\nSaucerful isn’t a bad record at all, really, it is just a record where the band is trying to make sense of how to take things forward without Barrett. Nick Mason has claimed it as his favourite Floyd album, which is probably why his current band is called Nick Mason’s Saucerful Of Secrets. It is instantly recognisable as Pink Floyd for those of us who see the band’s underground career as being their best times. It also marks the start of Pink Floyd’s lengthy artistic relationship with Hipgnosis, who designed most of their album covers. It sold well, getting to Number 9 in the UK album chart.\n\nI am briefly going back to the soundtrack album More, which was actually the band’s first recorded work after the departure of Barrett but which wasn’t released until early 1969, all I am going to say here is that it is worth hearing, because it contains some of Floyd’s loveliest early songs, pieces like “Cirrus Minor” and “Cymbaline“, as well as other pieces that contain bits and pieces that would be reused to much greater effect later on. If you aren’t a huge fan, you might want to avoid it, but give it a go.\n\nI’ll also mention the band’s late 1968 single “Point Me at the Sky” mainly because it contains the first recorded version of the live monster “Careful With That Axe, Eugene” which used to be the high point of the band’s live act. “CWTAE” also appears on the soundtrack to the incoherent and dull film, Zabriskie Point, where it is called “Come In Number 51, Your Time Is Up“. That version is on the band’s early compilation album, Relics.\n\n1969 saw the band release a fourth album, Ummagumma, a two-record set with one live disc (excellent) and one of experimental pieces by each of the four members. The studio stuff is pretty weird in places, Rick Wright chooses to explore a range of scary and avant garde ways of getting sounds out of his keyboards, Nick Mason fiddles about with percussion, David Gilmour shows us that his musical vision is more melodic and straightforward that the other two and Roger Waters messes around in the studio on the annoying and pointless “Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict” but also gives us the shimmeringly beautiful pastoral psychedelic folk of “Grantchester Meadows“. Ummagumma did well commercially. It got to Number 5 when it was released at the end of 1969.\n\n1970 amazingly saw Pink Floyd have a genuine Hit Album! Atom Heart Mother got to Number One, which still seems odd to me. I am pretty sure that David Gilmour hates the record to this day. He has often been really critical of what the band was doing in the 1968-70 period, despite it being a really exciting period for the fans. I don’t think that it has any classic Floyd tracks on it, though, even if “Fat Old Sun” has a nice Gilmour guitar workout as its climax. What AHM does have is the band moving away from all the improvised stuff and looking at making more structured records. That is a big pointer to where they were heading.\n\nRecorded during 1971 after a long gestation period while the band was touring, and following a long period of messing about with ideas, different songs and, to put it bluntly, lots of running into intellectual brick walls, Meddle was released in November 1972. As an aside, this was the first Pink Floyd album that I bought without having heard it first. I will be honest here and say that it is my favourite of all their albums, beyond any shadow of a doubt. It is almost perfect for me, apart from the throwaway tracks, “St. Tropez” and Seamus. It opens with a very muscular track, “One Of These Days“, goes into a couple of acoustic gems in “A Pillow Of Winds” and “Fearless“, dips into throwaway and then gives us the peerless beauty of “Echoes“.\n\nWhile touring to support Meddle, Pink Floyd started performing a long work-in-progress piece called Eclipse, made up of a number of linked songs. In the post-Syd period the band had often linked individual tracks with instrumental passages, and given the collective title of The Man and The Journey. However, this never had a single unifying concept or theme, well not one that was explicitly identified. Eclipse was different. It was the brainchild of Roger Waters, the beginning of his takeover of the band and its creative thrust. It was also about a few linked themes; life, death, the passage of time, religion, poverty and madness. In other words, what André Malraux would have called La Condition humaine.\n\nAs the work developed, it changed several times, becoming known as The Dark Side Of The Moon. The resulting album would be released in 1973, and it turned the essentially English underground psychedelic rock band into a global musical phenomenon. Yes, it is a great album, some might call it a masterpiece. Meh. I’m in two minds about it. It has some fantastic tracks. I love “Breathe“, “Time“, “Us And Them” and “Brain Damage“, but I don’t much like “Money” and “Any Colour You Like” and half a century after first hearing the recorded version of “The Great Gig In The Sky” I still can’t make my mind up about it. Also, what I don’t like about TDSOTM is that it turned Pink Floyd into a stadium rock act. All the mystery, magic, weirdness and strange beauty was sacrificed for album sales and success in American football stadiums. Of course, it was all that which killed the band.\n\nActually before TDSOTM came out, Floyd released another soundtrack album, Obscured By Clouds. It is song-based and it has some decent songs, but no classics. Enough of that one.\n\nI’m going to stop here. There are bits of Wish You Were Here I like a lot, especially the title track, I rarely play Animals and I utterly hate The Wall. To tell the truth, in my opinion, it would have been better if TDSOTM had been less successful.\n\nOK, so people now know that I liked Floyd best when most people didn’t know who they were or what they sounded like, when their fans were the hippies and heads and when you would queue up for tickets to see them where everyone was wearing loon pants, kaftans and Afghan coats, reeking of patchouli."
