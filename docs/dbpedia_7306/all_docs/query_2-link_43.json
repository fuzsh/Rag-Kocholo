Tickets are $25 each, and will be available at the door, or online at the band’s website.\n\nThe band was formed to pay tribute to Pink Floyd, an English rocphk band, which initially earned recognition for their psychedelic and space rock music, and later, as they evolved, for their progressive rock music.The band is known for philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, innovative album cover art, and elaborate live shows.

American Floyd and this show pays homage to Pink Floyd with a full band and a sound and light show sure to entertain even the most loyal and ardent fan.\n\nAmerican Floyd plans on presenting portions of Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, Momentary Lapse of Reason, and more. “We are doing the album Animals from start to finish.” He continued, “We will touch on every Pink Floyd album at some point during the show.”\n\n“The band is 10 times better than it was last May,” said Mark Hawkins the front man for the group. He was referencing the May 2010 concert held by the band at the Dunn Center which drew almost 800 people. ” We have Phil Kensie, a world famous sax player who has over 20 gold and platinum albums. He played with the eagles, Rod Stewart. He played the signature sax solo in Al Stewart’s Year of the Cat, which has been voted into the top 10 sax solos of all time.\n\nThe band features Mark Hawkins on the guitar and lead vocals, Vocals, Phillip Neal on the Keyboard and Lead Vocals, Steve Ross on the bass guitar, Michael Whitney on drums, Dennis Shepard on the steel guitar, and Brandon Hester on the Keyboard, and Phil Kensie on Saxophone. They will be backed up by the lovely Anne Marie Brown, Cherry Cole, Bonnie Lavender.\n\nThe band has been playing and working together for the last 2 years, while some of the members have been together for as long as 20 years. Michael Whitney, Steve Ross, and Mark Hawkins also play in a classic rock band called ProblemChild. The band was formed in 1990.\n\nThis show is going to be a little bit different according to Hawkins, “We will once again feature a spectacular laser light show, there will be a lot of movement, and a variety of props in the show.” There will also be a 40′ video screen behind the band.\n\nPhoto Gallery"
