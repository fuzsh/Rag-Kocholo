        "text": "Pink Floyd - The Space Rock Era - The Legendary Broadcasts 1967-1968 (CD)\n\nThis anthology features the live to air broadcasts featuring Pink Floyd from 1967 to 1968.\n\nThe early radio and TV broadcasts by Pink Floyd featured tracks such as Astronomy Domine, Interstellar Overdrive and Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun. Album tracks such as Cirrus Minor and the wonderful image on Ummagumma featuring the band's equipment laid out to form the image of a spaceship helped to underline what was considered to be a space rock theme. Although Roger Waters denied that Pink Floyd were ever a space rock band, the first three Pink Floyd albums are popularly known as the Space Rock era.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. Astronomy Domine - (BBC - 27th January 1967)\n\n2. Interstellar Overdrive - (Palazzo Del Sport, Rome 6th May 1968)\n\n3. Let There Be More Light - (Le Bilboquet, Paris - 31st December 1968)\n\n4. Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun - (Bouton Rouge 24th Feb 1968)\n\n5. Flaming - (Bouton Rouge 24th Feb 1968)\n\n6. Pow R.Toc H - (BBC - 27th January 1967)\n\n7.
