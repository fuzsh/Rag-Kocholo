        "text": "When Pink Floyd released Animals in January 1977 amid the burgeoning punk movement. The band's 10th album is often described as the group's response to punk, but — intentionally or not — the atypically dark and aggressive album also lit the fuse for the eventual rise of melodic metal.\n\nMusically and lyrically, Animals represented Pink Floyd at its most forceful and ambitious; the dreamy space-rock textures that characterized their breakthrough album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and its followup, 1975's Wish You Were Here, were scaled back in favor of a harsher approach. Animals featured lyricist/bassist Roger Waters' most focused lyrics to date. Inspired in part by George Orwell's dystopian 1945 novel Animal Farm, the album presented an allegory in which all of humanity is characterized as pigs, dogs and sheep.\n\nAs a result, many saw Animals as the British group's take on the contemporary punk scene, a movement spearheaded in the U.K. by the Sex Pistols, the Damned, the Clash and others.\n\nWith some reluctance and caveats, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason allows that punk did have some influence on the album. The group's previous albums had been created at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London — the same world-class studio used by the Beatles to record most of their work — which was populated with skilled engineers who followed strict rules; Mason chuckles as he describes them as wearing \"smart white coats.\"\n\nBut by 1976, Pink Floyd had converted part of their equipment storage/rehearsal facility, Britannia Row, into a recording studio. There the band could work at its own pace, making its own rules. The Britannia Row studio was smaller and less sophisticated than Abbey Road, and that would be reflected in the sound of Animals. \"Everyone was sort of looking at punk and thinking about doing things faster,\" Mason recalls. \"Rather than settling into a two- or three-year project, it was, ‘Let's get on with it. Let's do it.'\"\n\nYet Mason emphasizes that the punk rock that was happening all around the band didn't exert direct influence on the barbed character of Animals. \"Were we particularly excited by [punk]?\" he asks rhetorically. \"No. Every now and again, there'd be something that would be interesting, but an awful lot of punk really wasn't of that great interest to us.\" He chuckles and adds, \"It was all a bit too fast and noisy.\" (Mason was later tapped to produce Music for Pleasure, the second album by punk heroes the Damned, but emphasizes that \"I learned far more from them than they did from me.\")\n\nStill, the tone and approach of Pink Floyd's late '70s release would inspire future artists, especially among the style that would come to be known as melodic metal. In the 1990s and beyond, Steven Wilson created a body of work that drew upon Pink Floyd as a primary influence. Working first as a solo project and later as a band, Wilson released 10 albums under the Porcupine Tree banner. While early Porcupine Tree explored sonic dreamscapes, by the time of 2005's Deadwing and its followup Fear of a Blank Planet (2007), the band had moved decidedly in the direction of melodic metal.\n\nAnd while Wilson has always been inspired by a widely eclectic range of influences, his metal-leaning work bore the influence of Animals. He admitted as much in \"Animals and Me,\" a 2020 essay for Prog Magazine. While Pink Floyd is often described as progressive rock, Wilson asserted that with Animals, the band moved beyond that genre. \"There's nothing about it that's stereotypically progressive rock,\" he wrote.\n\nAnimals is often viewed as the beginning of the dominance of Roger Waters within Pink Floyd — he composed all of the record's lyrics and is credited with most of the music — though Wilson hears something else. \"For me, it's [David] Gilmour's part; the guitar work on the album is the greatest of all, which is saying something.\" Throughout the record, Gilmour's always inventive and lyrical lead guitar work takes on an uncharacteristically angry tone, one in keeping with the album's dark, often pessimistic themes.\n\nAnd such serious, weighty themes would become a foundational part of music by later melodic metal bands including Nine Inch Nails, Dream Theater and Tool. Maynard James Keenan is vocalist and songwriter for metal bands Tool and Puscifer, and credits Animals as an inspiration for both groups. \"Pink Floyd, [and] specifically Animals, has had a huge influence on Puscifer and Tool,\" Keenan tells GRAMMY.com. \"Not just because of the compositions, but also the approach to production and instrumentation.\"\n\nThat influence endures some 45 years after Animals' release. Keenan's more recent work continues to find inspiration not only from Waters' lyrics, but from the distinctive keyboard textures of Pink Floyd's Richard Wright. Keenan notes that like Animals, Puscifer's most recent release, 2020's Existential Reckoning \"has the Arp Solina [String Ensemble] all over it.\"\n\nWhen a who's who of progressive and metal artists collaborated on the 2021 album Animals Reimagined: A Tribute to Pink Floyd, two members of Dream Theater enthusiastically participated, underscoring their appreciation for the influential ‘77 album. Singer James LaBrie took the lead vocal on a reading of \"Pigs (Three Different Ones),\" and Jordan Rudess provided extensive keyboard work on \"Dogs.\"\n\n\"The driving and hypnotic – while still rocking – nature of Animals made it a very unique album and source of inspiration to me,\" says Rudess. \"That pulsing sound opened the door for so many; in our music we have proudly tipped our hats to the mighty Floyd many times.\"\n\nNick Mason agrees that there are some through lines connecting Pink Floyd's 1977 album with the more tuneful side of modern heavy metal. While taking mild issue with the term melodic metal (\"I'm opposed to putting labels on anything,\" he emphasizes), he allows that Animals can be thought to fit that description. \"If I was going to put a label on it,\" Mason says with a smile, \"there's something quite nice about that one.\"\n\nWhile Animals is neither punk nor metal, four and a half decades after its release the album can be seen as a kind of link between the two rock subgenres. In 1977, Pink Floyd was sometimes viewed as among the \"dinosaurs\" that punk hoped to sweep away. \"I think the big thing that punk did that was really useful was [to take] the wind out of the sails of prog rock that had become so bombastic,\" Mason says.\n\nThe comparatively stripped-down aesthetic of Animals was in line with that kind of approach, and in the process it provided some musical cues for metal players to come. In his Prog essay, Steven Wilson made a similar point when writing specifically about Animals: \"At their very heart, [Pink Floyd] have very simple songs, without unnecessary complexity, and I think that's given them a timeless quality,\" he wrote. And he – among many others – took those values to heart in much of his own work. \"It wouldn't be overstating to say that Animals is responsible in many ways for the path that my career took,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nAnd it continues to influence artists who make today's melodic metal. \"Animals carved new ground for music production,\" agrees Dream Theater's Rudess. \"And it has played an important part of all the rock that has followed.\"\n\nSound Bites: Iggy Pop Explains How A \"Primal Groove\" Was The Genesis Of His Raw Power Onstage\n\nHe also extended his love and gratitude to his fiancée, Whitney Alford, and shouted out his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates. Lamar specifically praised Top Dawg's CEO, Anthony Tiffith, for finding and developing raw talent that might not otherwise get the chance to pursue their musical dreams.\n\n\"We'd never forget that: Taking these kids out of the projects, out of Compton, and putting them right here on this stage, to be the best that they can be,\" Lamar — a Compton native himself — continued, leading into an impassioned conclusion spotlighting some of the cornerstone rap albums that came before To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\n\"Hip-hop. Ice Cube. This is for hip-hop,\" he said. \"This is for Snoop Dogg, Doggystyle. This is for Illmatic, this is for Nas. We will live forever. Believe that.\"\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly singles \"Alright\" and \"These Walls\" earned Lamar three more GRAMMYs that night, the former winning Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song and the latter taking Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (the song features Bilal, Anna Wise and Thundercat). He also won Best Music Video for the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood.\"\n\nLamar has since won Best Rap Album two more times, taking home the golden gramophone in 2018 for his blockbuster LP DAMN., and in 2023 for his bold fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.\n\nWatch Lamar's full acceptance speech above, and check back at GRAMMY.com every Friday for more GRAMMY Rewind episodes.\n\n10 Essential Facts To Know About GRAMMY-Winning Rapper J. Cole\n\nRarely do a mere prism and spectrum of light signify so much.\n\nThe cover of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon is recognizable by all denizens of the Western world, rock fan or not. For so many, it also opens a treasure box of associations: The themes of irth and death, greed and madness, and the relentless tick-tock of time. An ecstatic vocal aria. The specter of a departed Syd Barrett. The lunatic on the grass. Money: it's a gas.\n\nAfter half a century of headphone-clad zone-outs and The Wizard of Oz re-rewatches, The Dark Side of the Moon transcends mere codification and ubiquity; it remains a work of uncommon perceptiveness, concision and ingenuity. And the arrival of a new boxed set invites listeners back through the gates of its mind-expanding, incisive, philosophical universe.\n\nRead More: 20 Albums Turning 50 In 2023: Innervisions, Dark Side Of The Moon, Catch A Fire & More\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon — 50th Anniversary Boxed Set, out Mar. 24, encompasses a lavish array of ways to re-experience this classic rock staple. The set includes CD and gatefold vinyl of the newly remastered studio album, as well as Blu-Ray/DVD audio featuring the original 5.1 mix and remastered stereo versions, as well as a diamond-sharp Atmos mix.\n\nJust as enticing is a CD and LP of The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974, which illuminates how an album that stretched the boundaries of the studio took on new dimensions on stage. When you see Roger Waters continue to stage ambitious, polemic productions across the globe, trace a line backward to Floyd's culture-shaking live show 50 years ago.\n\nTo mark the re-release of what many consider to be Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason's crowning achievement, here are five facts you may not know about The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nRoger Waters Sought Unprecedented Lyrical Clarity\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon wasn't just a leap forward aurally, or conceptually: the band had never been so vivid and specific with their words.\n\n\"I think we all thought — and Roger definitely thought — that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect,\" Gilmour told Rolling Stone in 2003, referring to past albums like Obscured by Clouds and Meddle. \"There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific. That was a big leap forward.\"\n\nThus, the band produced a work of thematic depth and concision, full of unforgettable one-liners like \"All you touch and all you see/ Is all your life will ever be\" and \"There's someone in my head/ But it's not me.\"\n\nWatch Now: Inside Pink Floyd's Progressive Masterpiece The Wall | For The Record\n\nClare Torry Was Paid Just £30 For Her Vocal Performance\n\nDespite the singer's lack of name recognition, millions and millions have heard Clare Torry's voice. Her cyclonic, wordless aria on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" — they nixed a first attempt, partly on account of the word \"baby\" — is one of the most memorable parts of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nSo it might be surprising to hear that Torry was paid a standard rate of £30 for her work — and ended up suing the band in 2004 for a songwriting credit and lost wages. (The case was settled out of court.)\n\nIt Could Have Been Called Eclipse, With The Silver Surfer On The Cover\n\nWhen a now-obscure band called Medicine Head released an album called Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd's desired title seemed under threat.\n\n\"We weren't annoyed at Medicine Head,\" Gilmour later said. \"We were annoyed because we had already thought of the title before the Medicine Head album came out.\" But when Medicine Head's album failed commercially, the door was open to proceed as planned.\n\nAnd, accordingly, while Pink Floyd desired the prismatic cover as soon as they saw it, the band had previously kicked around the idea of a Marvel superhero on the album sleeve.\n\n\"We were all into Marvel Comics, and the Silver Surfer seemed to be another fantastic singular image,\" Aubrey Power of art design group Hipgnosis remembered. \"We never would have got permission to use it. But we liked the image of a silver man, on a silver surfboard, scooting across the universe. It had mystical, mythical properties. Very cosmic, man!\"\n\nRead More: Remixing Animals: How Pink Floyd's 1977 Album Set The Stage For Melodic Metal\n\nThe Band Performed The Album In Its Entirety A Year Prior To Release\n\nThroughout 1972, the band performed a proto version of The Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics (its addendum at the time) in sequence. They also refined the song cycle as one continuous piece, with transitions at all, eventually landing on the continuum of music we know and love today.\n\nThat being said, there were significant differences in these nascent live versions — for example, \"On the Run\" was a guitar and keyboard jam, and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was hung on an organ solo, not a vocal solo.\n\nThere's A Beatles-Related Easter Egg Near The End\n\nPaul McCartney, then finishing Wings' Red Rose Speedway, was among the various interview subjects interspliced into the finished project — but as his appearance was a comedic put-on against the band's wishes, they scrapped his appearance. But that doesn't mean there's no Fabs on The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nNear the end of \"Eclipse,\" during the famous \"Matter of fact, it's all dark\" quip an orchestral version of \"Ticket to Ride\" can be faintly heard. This detail among so many others is more audible than ever in the new remaster — where the light shines through clearer than ever.\n\nWhat Does U2 Stand For?
