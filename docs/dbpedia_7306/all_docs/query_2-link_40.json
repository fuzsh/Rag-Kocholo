        "text": "From the sweet, trippy melodies of the hippie era to the harsh yet experimental sounds of rock of the 1970s, Pink Floyd’s concept album The Dark Side of the Moon released in March 1973 to an audience of young people disillusioned with contemporary society was a siren song to anxiety, mortality, and madness. In addition to launching Pink Floyd into stardom in North America, Dark Side spent 14 consecutive years on Billboard’s Top 200 and, today, remains among the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nRoger Waters, the lyricist of the album, had replaced the songwriter and band co-founder Syd Barrett after he left in 1968 due to his worsening mental condition. Much of Waters's lyrics and the themes in Dark Side encapsulate post-World War II British anxieties. The album also reflects the feelings of the time about the waning hippie era, staying sane in the face of rapidly changing modernity, and the band members’ personal emotions about losing Barrett as a bandleader.\n\nDespite the monumental success of the album, having received many awards and solidifying itself within rock history, its success is an enigma to musicologists and even the band members. In the cover art book Mind Over Matter: The Images of Pink Floyd written by the British graphic designer and album artist Storm Thorgerson, Thorgerson wrote, “here was no string of hit singles (no single at all in Europe), no videos, no famous personalities; no catchy hook lines that people hummed, no scandal, no mammoth tours. All in all no obvious reason to account for Dark Side being a critical success…” In general, members of the band knew it was their best work to date, but were surprised by its commercial success. It was not just about being a good album, drummer Nick Mason later said, but it was about “being in the right place at the right time.”\n\nThe idea that there were no singles or, at least, catchy, hummable, tracks might strike some as arguable, especially to those who know Pink Floyd primarily from tunes like “Time” or “Money.” The opening audio of “Money,”—with its now legendary pseudo-beat made up of sound effects of cash registers and coins clinking—sums up the mixture of experimentation and pop/rock melodies that characterize the full album. The balance between experimentation and song composition is tipped back and forth as the album progresses, and yet today, it’s often featured on classic rock radio, on film and TV.\n\nBut on the more experimental end of the spectrum, is track two: “On the Run.” Pink Floyd developed the song—an instrumental that uses cutting edge sonic sound and droning effects—through live performances. Drummer Nick Mason’s hi-hat keeps a brisk 165 BPM tempo, while a Synthi AKS, which only had just come out about a year before, performs a relentless 8-note loop. The warp speed of the song and dark phrasing of the synthesizer reflect the pressures of air travel, which could precipitate death—an early version of the song was called “The Travel Sequence.” Some say it was an early vision of techno, and electronic music at large.\n\nOther songs have messages in tune with the overall concept of the album, that seemed to strike a chord for its post-war audience, but also prove meaningful today. “Us and Them” criticizes the cut-and-dry, black and white narrative often present during wartime. The most poignant track, “Brain Damage,” is both a track about mental instability and psychosis, and a personal lament towards the former band member Syd Barrett. The album end, “Eclipse,” recalls the themes of the album in the form of a lyrical litany of each track’s theme, the band harmonizing together before ending on the sound of heartbeats.\n\nSometimes the songs match those themes without lyrics at all, as in “Great Gig in the Sky” in which Clare Tory’s vocals turn from humming a melody into a rage-filled screaming, as if she lost her mind in the process of singing. Underneath, careful listeners are treated to clips of interviews from people who were asked questions about life and death. “I am not frightened of dying,” says a janitor at Abbey Road, where the album was recorded, “Any time will do, I don't mind.”\n\nThe commercial success may have proved surprising, but it decidedly launched Pink Floyd to the top of many lists, and set the tenor of the 70s as well as music to come. Thorgerson sarcastically wrote that it must have been the album’s cover all along—a joke not without merit as its cover is iconic and emblematic of 70s rock, but the historical contexts surrounding the album’s release, the seamless and cyclical quality of the album gives the album a timelessness that enables listeners from the ‘70s to the 2020s to relate with its themes to this day. In short, it is a great rock album."
