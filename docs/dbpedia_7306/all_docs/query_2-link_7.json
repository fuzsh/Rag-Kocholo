        "text": "Space Rock: what the hell is it?\n\nSome include Pink Floyd in the genre, if it is quite a \"genre\" even, but I most associate it with Hawkwind and those who make Hawkwind-inspired noises. In particular there is one noise, or at least one group of noises, that emanated from what seems to be called a VCS3 ring modulator, which is some kind of \"oscillator,\" which I take to be something that oscillates. What exactly is it, though? Who the hell knows, some kind of keyboard device.\n\nSpace Rock is kind of a vague genre term, and (for me at least) it is often hard to pin down what makes something Space Rock. One pretty good indicator is if a band makes the aforementioned Hawkwind Noise (either the VCS3 or something like it--I'm pretty loose about counting something as the Hawkwind noise, as Monoshock seem to approximate it with guitars).\n\nAnyway, there is already a thread for space rock recommendations, here I would like to ask what is it, and who is it? What makes something \"space rock\"? It seems like kind of a vague term to me. If in the course of discussion recommendations are made and the other thread is duplicated a bit, I think we'll all make it through this traumatic event.\n\nBands that I am familiar with that are sometimes classified as Space Rock:\n\nPink Floyd: I guess some of their stuff could be called Space Rock, and they are influential, I think, among current purveyors of this kind of music. I like a lot of their stuff, but like many of you I'm a bit more into the first couple albums or so, and it is this early stuff that is probably closer to something like Space Rock.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? No.\n\nHawkwind: Awesome band and I am on something of a Hawkwind kick lately. I am a big fan. They have numerous spinoffs, I haven't heard much of the recent \"Hawklords\" stuff but if anyone is into it let me know.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Of course.\n\nOzric Tentacles: Jammy and somewhat proggy and a little maybe new agey or something.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? No, I don't think so, but in a way they do--their souls cry out in a Hawkwind Noise kind of way.\n\nGong: Some of their stuff seems to fit the bill. And as a bonus, the Om Riff album/track by Acid Mothers Temple and the Cosmic Inferno is one of the best things ever recorded in the space rock medium, I think.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes, I'm actually unsure if they arrived at it independently, kind of a Newton/Leibniz situation maybe.\n\nAcid Mothers Temple: Awesome band. Absolutely impossible to keep up with their discography.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes, incessantly, almost to the point of comedy--there are times I wish they'd lay off it for a change of pace. If, like Bob Dylan, they did a straightforward album of Sinatra/Great American Songbook type material, they'd slather the Hawkwind Noise all over it.\n\nCosmic Jokers: Some Krautrock stuff gets labelled \"Space Rock\" sometimes and these are the most plausible candidates to my ears. Amon Duul II also gets the label sometimes but I'm not sure it's apt. CJ's parent band, Ash Ra Tempel, is to my ears more like a Grateful Dead-type band with ambient-moody leanings.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? No.\n\nHidria Spacefolk: They are said to be reminiscent of Gong. I haven't listened to much, does anyone know know much about them?\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? I'm not sure, there are certainly noises in that vein anyway. I'm listening right now and I don't hear an oscillator per se but their overall sound is space-inflected, if we may say that, with many Hawkwindesque sounds.\n\nLunar Dunes: Very much seems to be a band trying to make \"Space Rock.\" They sound great but I think they are better approached as background music.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes, sometimes.\n\nVespero: Another band I've seen labelled with the label. These are Russians, like Drago they were probably funded by the government and shot full of dope to make them rock harder.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Not exactly.\n\nMonoshock: This stuff is amazing. Everyone should listen to Monoshock. It rocks harder than anything else.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? They have it in spirit, anyway--they sort of make it with the guitars.\n\nComets on Fire: Frenetic like Monoshock but a good bit cleaner and more eclectic. They are a highly rated band by your Pitchforks and such but I'm not sure that there are many actual songs, when you get down to it.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes, and it's probably the best thing about them.\n\nThe Bevis Frond: Curious band, this (a lot of it is one dude, actually). They have some instrumentals that are definitely space rock, and they retain the services of Hawkwind's probably second-best bass player, Adrian Shaw. But they also have singing songs that are far from space, not even really psych some of it, kind of Elvis Costello-ish vocals and a folky vibe.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? I don't think so but they manage to convey the idea.\n\nOresund Space Collective: They have \"space\" in their name.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes.\n\nFirst Band from Outer Space: this is surely space rock if anything is.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind noise? Yes.\n\nChrome: I'm not sure if they belong but they were on a list I consulted online. Killer band, some Hawkwind in their DNA for sure (and Helios Creed played on some Nik Turner stuff) but I'm not sure if they are aptly titled Space Rock. Really great music, though.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? No.\n\nKrankschaft: They are I suppose technically a Hawkwind spinoff as they sort of evolved from the excellent Inner City Unit.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes.\n\nCircle: Sometimes they get listed but I'm not sure it's the right tag. I love them, though.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind noise? No.\n\nWhite Hills: So-so psyche band, sometimes they hit the mark.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes, sometimes.\n\nST 37: less-known spacers.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes.\n\nCarlton Melton: pretty spacy.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? No, but it gets pretty widdly.\n\nSilver Apples: they oscillate, it would seem odd to call it the \"Hawkwind noise\" in their case...\n\nFollakzoid: I don't know if this qualifies, it takes you somewhere though.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? No.\n\nF/I: Space. Blanga. Yes.\n\nHere and Now: some spacy stuff where they make the noise.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes.\n\nSpacelords: I have just discovered them, good instrumental space rock, pretty heavy.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? It seems close, there's some squiggling.\n\nThe Spacious Mind: good, heavy, jammy hard rock with a little squiggling, although I don't think they use an oscillator or make the Hawkwind Noise as such.\n\nSteve Hillage has some spacy stuff and even makes the noise sometimes (or somebody does).\n\nTangerine Dream is sometimes called Space Rock and it seems like an apt term in a way but in a very different way from the aforementioned bands.\n\nDo they make the Hawkwind Noise? Yes.\n\nSometimes Spacemen 3 and Loop get the tag, but I don't know about that (I love both bands though)."
