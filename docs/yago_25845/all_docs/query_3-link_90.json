        "text": "The Best Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Orbital by Samantha Harvey. Just stunning. My full review is here.\n\nThe Worst Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… River East, River West by Aube Rey Lescure, from my 2024 reading list. Mixed-race Alva and her American mother Sloane live in Shanghai, where Alva attends a local school and dreams of the kind of life she could access via her US passport, although she has never left China. When Sloane hooks up with their landlord, Lu Fang, Alva assumes he’s just the next in a series of Chinese men her mother’s dated for their money. But it turns out that Sloane and Lu Fang have a shared past that reaches back more than twenty years, when Lu Fang was working in a shipping yard in Qingdao, miserable after missing out on his chance of finishing university due to being caught up in Mao’s ‘Down to the Countryside’ movement in 1966 and sent for rural re-education.\n\nRiver East, River West is extremely competent: it’s readable, the writing flows well, the plot beats land correctly. Lescure has some important things to say about the prejudice of American expats towards the locals and the difficulties that Alva faces, labelled as a laowei by her Chinese classmates and yet dismissed by foreign visitors. But for me, this just lacked soul. It reminded me of the modern-day sections of Susan Barker’s The Incarnations, which are also set in 2007-8, though in Beijing rather than Shanghai; it’s also about a group of miserable people who wreak misery on each other and the innocents who happen to cross their paths. When I finished this, I found that the only characters I’d really cared about were tertiary: Alva’s rooftopping friend Gao Xiaofan and Lu Fang’s sad son Minmin. I don’t need to like fictional people for their stories to work for me, but there has to be something more to them than this. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Short Story Collection I Most Wanted To Connect More With This Month Was…\n\n… Out There Screaming ed. Jordan Peele. This is a solid collection of short speculative fiction by Black North American writers, most of it horror or horror-adjacent, and I’m not sure why I didn’t like it more than I did. As you’d expect for an anthology edited by Peele, the horror often emerges from societal racism more than the supernatural elements. The dangers of travelling while Black are a recurrent theme. Tananarive Due’s ‘The Rider’ follows two sisters who are travelling to join the Freedom Riders in Montgomery in 1961 and find themselves in peril when they board a Greyhound bus in Tallahassee, while in Maurice Broaddus’s ‘The Norwood Trouble’, a Black town in Indiana protected by a mysterious orchard finds itself in danger after one little girl crosses the town boundaries to get ice-cream. Nicole D. Sconiers’s ‘A Bird Sings By The Etching Tree’ features a Black girl haunting a highway after she was driven off the road, while in Chesya Burke’s ‘An American Fable’, a group of Black people are forced off the train in inter-war Cincinnati towards a terrifying fate. At the same time, characters are often protected by the power of their ancestors, or by shared magical traditions, in both these stories and in others, such as Rion Amilcar Scott’s arresting and beautifully-written ‘A Grief of the Dead’.\n\nYet, despite how well most of these stories work, I found that I only connected with a few of them – often the ones where the speculative elements took centre stage. I loved Erin E. Adams’s ‘Lasirèn’, based on Haitian folklore, where a siren lures a girl into the darkness of the water. I was also struck by Ezra Clayton Daniels’s disconcerting ‘Pressure’, and P. Djèlí Clark’s ‘Hide and Seek’ was so nearly brilliant (I wish Clark had resisted the temptation to constantly spell out the irony of his story, e.g. ‘This is hide and seek. And it’s not a game.’). Still, definitely a worthwhile collection, just one that for, whatever reason, won’t stick with me.\n\nThe Fluffiest Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Valley Verified by Kyla Zhao. I thought this second novel from Zhao would be more The Devil Wears Prada meets Uncanny Valley, but no: this is straightforward chick lit. Nothing wrong with that, and current fans of the genre may enjoy it more than I did. Valley Verified is about a fashion journalist, Zoe Zhang, who trades a job working on a magazine to work at a start-up for a new app in Silicon Valley. Feeling out of her depth, Zoe wonders if she will ever get the tech industry to take her ideas seriously, or connect with her new colleagues. This is a predictable novel and I have to admit I eyerolled a lot in the first third, when Zoe seemed unbelievably naive, assuming that she’d automatically be able to bond over clothes and gossip with her only female colleague, for example. However, I did like how her character developed over the course of the novel as she had to reassess her initial judgments, and I enjoyed her growing friendship with software engineers Bram and Austin. The romantic sub-plot is kept light and I appreciated that the focus was on Zoe’s work problems, although there’s still an incredibly clunky scene where the character development for the love interest is basically accomplished by him writing a personal essay which he shares with Zoe. Valley Verified is, however, readable, fun, and more intelligent than it initially seems. Also, gorgeous cover. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nHon. mention: Young Jane Young by Gabrielle Zevin, which is much lighter and fluffier than Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. Told by five different narrators, it ranged from the intelligently light (Jane’s mother) to the shallow (Jane) to the unbearably cutesy (Jane’s daughter) for me.\n\nMy Best Re-Read This Month Was…\n\nL: The cover of the Kindle edition I read first time round. R: The cover of the second-hand paperback edition I read this time.\n\n… The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell. I first read this Jesuits-in-space SF novel back in 2018 and remember being completely riveted by the mystery of what went so badly wrong during a first-contact mission to a distant planet. The sole survivor of the mission, Emilio, a Jesuit priest, returns with mutilated hands, traumatised by what he has seen and questioning his relationship with God; the title of the novel refers to what he once believed about this relationship (‘Not one sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it’). This time through, I was naturally less inclined to speed-read the novel to find out what happened, and I missed the intensity of my first reading. Having said that, though, I found myself disagreeing with some of the criticisms I made of the book the first time round: back then, I felt ‘the last third of The Sparrow feels too compressed’, it’s ‘structurally clunky’ and ‘tries to do too much.’ Re-reading the book more slowly (in 2018, I read it over the course of five days; in 2024, I read it in ten) allowed me to get more out of it. I no longer found it clunky or compressed, and I felt Russell does what she sets out to do, which is to depict Emilio’s devastating crisis of faith and how it emerges from his closeness to God. The persistent sense of menace throughout this novel is balanced by the smart generosity of its secondary cast (this description of Anne, my favourite of the secondary characters, could really stand for all of them: ‘for although she was a woman of highly trained intelligence, she passed all experience through her heart’). You don’t need to hold any kind of religious belief or indeed, usually enjoy reading SF, to appreciate this brilliant novel.\n\nThe Most Resonant Novel I Read This Month Was…\n\n…The Twilight Zone by Nona Fernández, trans. Natasha Wimmer. This piece of autofiction is told by a nameless narrator who grew up under Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile in the 1970s and 1980s, and who is haunted by the cover of a magazine she encountered as a child, where an intelligence agent for the regime, Andrés Valenzuela Morales, confessed ‘Yo Torturé’, translated here as ‘I Tortured People’. Our narrator tells the stories of these tortured, vanished people by intertwining them with fictions she also remembers from her childhood: most often, the serial TV programme The Twilight Zone, where books kill and an actress merges into her own image on the movie screen, but also the Back to the Future films and A Christmas Carol. This is a good novel by any definition, but it particularly resonated for me this month through some book/life serendipity; the narrator’s reflections on recording and viewing atrocities reflected Samantha Harvey’s musings on Michael Collins’s photograph and Velázquez’s painting Las Meninas in Orbital, while I also went to see an exhibition at the Baltic that showcased some Central and South American artists (among others) working with themes of trauma and dispossession. And although this is realist fiction, its intertextuality reminded me of horror novels set in other South American countries that have suffered from regimes of terror: Mariana Enríquez’s Our Share of Night (Argentina) and Julianne Pachico’s The Anthill (Colombia). Finally, it made me think of Elissa Washuta’s brilliant White Magic, which also braids together 80s pop culture with personal trauma, though from the perspective of a Native North American.\n\nWhat books stood out to you this month? Have you read any of these? Would you like to?\n\nAs always, I won’t be posting my Top Ten Books of 2023 until the 31st December, but here are some books that almost made my top ten – and also my biggest disappointments of the year. Links are to my reviews. All books are first read by me in 2023, not necessarily first published in 2023.\n\nHighly Commended\n\nI thought I was tired of the wave of #MeToo novels that have emerged since 2017, despite some outstanding examples like Kate Elizabeth Russell’s My Dark Vanessa. But this year, writers have stepped it up a notch, examining not just the impact of sexual assault and rape on individual women, but how society gaslights women as a whole. My favourite of these novels is in my top ten books of the year, but my second favourite, Rebecca Makkai’s I Have Some Questions For You, is nearly as good: it follows Bodie as she reassesses her memories of her own adolescence in an elite prep school while reinvestigating a cold case.\n\nThere have also been some outstanding memoirs. Chanel Miller’s Know My Name was the standout for me, as she analyses the aftermath of her rape by Stanford student Brock Turner: ‘On the day the verdict of my case was read, a Washington Post article quoted Brock saying that in ten years he hoped to be in residency to be a surgeon. His sister wrote, Goodbye to the Olympics. Goodbye to being an orthopaedic surgeon… At the time of the assault, he had worked as a lifeguard for two years and then at a store called Speedy Feet. But I never read this anywhere. He was not forced to acknowledge the facts of his present. He was talked about in terms of his lost potential, what he would never be, rather than what he is. They spoke as if his future was patiently waiting for him to step into it.’\n\nHorror is hot at the moment, and while it’s always been one of my favourite genres, I’m delighted by the new wave of horror fiction that centres women, queer people and/or people of colour, including Indigenous voices. These three horror books exemplify this trend perfectly (for more, see my top ten books of the year). Jessica Johns’s Bad Cree follows a young Cree woman who reconnects with her heritage when she finds herself pursued by a terrifying supernatural threat; she’s assisted by her dead kokum (grandmother). Zen Cho’s Black Water Sister picks up on some of the same story beats as a lesbian American-Malaysian woman is suddenly addressed by the ghost of her grandmother, Ah Ma, and they have to deal with an angry god. Genuinely funny but also properly scary, this confirmed how much I love Cho’s work. Finally, Isabel Yap’s short story collection Never Have I Ever draws brilliantly from Filipino folklore, from her take on the manananggal myth in ‘Good Girls’ to her brilliant evocation of the kind of urban legends that circulate in a girls’ school in ‘Have You Heard The One About Anamaria Marquez’.\n\nThe Women’s Prize for Fiction longlist initially disappointed me, but the Prize did nominate some excellent novels this year. My three favourites were Jacqueline Crooks’s dub reggae 1980s-set Fire Rush, Sheena Patel’s nailing of an obsessive relationship in I’m A Fan, and Barbara Kingsolver’s irresistibly voiced Demon Copperhead, which ended up being the overall winner.\n\nI’m weary of familiar psychological thrillers and police procedural, but I read some excellent cross-genre and literary thrillers this year. Eleanor Catton’s Birnam Wood, a loose retelling of Macbeth where a guerrilla gardening group tangle with an amoral billionaire,‘injected plot back into litfic and serious morality back into thrillers’. Nicola Griffith’s Stay, the second book in the Aud Torvingen trilogy, continues to brilliantly dissect the manipulative, ruthless, traumatised Aud alongside a pacy modern noir plot. Cory Doctorow’s For The Win is a smart techno-thriller set between LA, China and Mumbai, following a group of workers who try to resist capitalist exploitation – but their means of production isn’t the traditional factory, but multiplayer online games. Louise Doughty’s A Bird In Winter further blows apart the literary/thriller divide by following a woman on the run through rural Scotland; it’s both a nuanced character study and a spy novel.\n\nSome of my favourite writers were back on form this year after some disappointing previous works. I adored Ann Patchett’s deeply resonant Tom Lake, where she finally crystallises her more mature writing register as she tells us about Lara, who, in her turn, is telling her three adult daughters about the summer she spent in northern Michigan with a famous actor in 1988. Emma Donoghue’s Learned By Heart sees her return to the historical period where she is clearly most confident; exploring Anne Lister’s girlhood at boarding school in the very early nineteenth century and her real-life love affair with fellow classmate Eliza Raine, she’s brilliant on the specifics of this society, and how it constrains our protagonists. Meanwhile, Karen Russell’s short story collection Orange World was both disappointing and incredible at the same time: many of the stories didn’t work for me but those that did were unforgettable. I was especially struck by ‘The Tornado Auction’, a near-perfect short about a man who was forced to give up raising storms when his daughters were young but can’t resist purchasing one last cyclone in his old age.\n\nBest Rereads\n\nA new category this year to highlight the books that were most satisfying upon rereading! The highlight here has to be Daphne du Maurier’s My Cousin Rachel, which I last read in my late teens. Picking apart both Philip and Rachel was absorbing, and the novel is so technically brilliant. I also loved rereading Tracy Chevalier’s lightning-doesn’t-strike-twice gem, Girl With A Pearl Earring, and Kate Murray-Browne’s domestic chiller The Upstairs Room. A special shout-out, too, to Val McDermid’s Tony Hill novels, which I’ve been reading in sequence for the first time over Christmas. I’ve been amazed at just how good the character development is when you actually read the books in order; novels that I thought were ‘weaker’ entries in the series, like Cross and Burn, have really come into their own, although my favourite remains the utterly terrifying The Wire In The Blood, which prefigured the unmasking of Jimmy Savile.\n\nBiggest Disappointments\n\nBy ‘biggest disappointments’ I don’t mean that these were my worst books of the year, but that they were books I’d been looking forward to, that had been hyped by publishers/reviewers/friends/all of the above, and which fell well short of my expectations.\n\nThe Women’s Prize for Fiction delivered two of my biggest disappointments of the year. Cecile Pin’s Wandering Souls and Parini Shroff’s The Bandit Queens were both on my 2023 list of anticipated reads, but neither worked for me. I thought Wandering Souls was thinly written and cliched as it related a familiar refugee narrative that seemed designed to pull on white liberal heartstrings. Similarly, The Bandit Queens had a great premise – women in an Indian village band together to murder their husbands – but felt like it was designed to sell stereotypes about the misery, dirt and abuse of rural India to a Western audience.\n\nSome horror and speculative fiction also fell short of the mark. Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s Silver Nitrate sounded SO promising. When Monserrat and Tristan, two friends living in Mexico City in the 1990s, encounter a cult horror director who stopped making films decades ago, the director claims he can change their lives if they help him complete the dubbing of a film made by a Nazi occultist on fragile silver nitrate. But the incredibly slow pace and flat affect robbed the narrative of all its tension. Erica Ferencik’s supernatural Arctic story Girl in Ice ticked all my boxes, but was ruined by its frustrating protagonist. I loved Mary Robinette Kowal’s Lady Astronaut trilogy but her earlier novel, Ghost Talkers, didn’t work for me at all. Another great premise – a female medium working in the ‘Spirit Corps’ during the First World War talks to the ghosts of men who have recently been killed to extract important information – but I couldn’t invest in the central romance.\n\nWhat books stood out to you this year? Did you have any particular disappointments? And have you read any of my picks?\n\nThe Best Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Elissa Washuta’s White Magic. This stunning collection from my 2023 reading list was sold as a Native woman reflecting on the appropriation of Indigenous magical traditions by ‘Instagram witches’ but is really about intergenerational trauma, time and relationship with the land. Washuta brilliantly repeats and returns to different moments, physically encountering her past and future selves but also finding resonance in objects as well as in popular culture, from Twin Peaks to Oregon Trail to anti-drug public information adverts from the 90s. If you loved Carmen Maria Machado’s In The Dream House, read this. In contrast: Jenn Ashworth’s Notes Made While Falling, another collection of autobiographical essays about trauma and alcoholism from my list, didn’t work for me at all – I found it simultaneously pretentiously academic and gratuitously explicit. Did not finish.\n\nThe Worst Book (That I Actually Finished) This Month Was…\n\n… Legends and Lattes by Travis Baldree. I don’t do ‘uplit’ but I honestly think I could be the right audience for ‘cozy fantasy’. I don’t care about plot, I love invented worlds you feel like you can snuggle into (though, given that I find the Scholomance cozy, maybe my tastes are a bit offbeat here) and while I am not the best fantasy reader, I usually get along with low-stakes, folktale-esque stories in the vein of Patricia C. Wrede’s Enchanted Forest Chronicles or the early books in Tamora Pierce’s Protector of the Small quartet. But as Legends and Lattes seems to be THE example of this sub-genre at the moment, maybe it isn’t for me. I thought this book was just about OK. In short, I think to make this sort of thing work you need really distinctive, loveable characters and worldbuilding that feels properly solid without being too complicated. Legends and Lattes’ cast are nice enough, and the romance is sweet, but I didn’t get attached to any of them, probably because, with the exception of Viv, the orc protagonist who decides to open a coffee shop, they’re all a bit one-note. It was the world, however, that made this drop over into ‘silly’ rather than ‘cozy’ for me. As Nataliya says in her review, this is just a book about somebody reinventing Starbucks*. It’s all too nudge-nudge-wink-wink: ooh, people hog tables doing their university work in fantasyland too! Wow, what if we wrote people’s names on mugs so they could take drinks away? There was a marked improvement in the last 40% or so, so I’d be willing to admit that this could’ve been a fun novella. But as I liked Becky Chambers’s A Psalm for the Wild-Built even less, I’m still holding out for my perfect cozy SFF read. Any suggestions?\n\n*also, given that Charlie’s coffeehouse in Robin McKinley’s Sunshine exists, I don’t think I could ever get properly attached to any other magical coffee-making establishment\n\nMy Most Nostalgic Reread This Month Was…\n\nL: The hardback library copy I originally read. R: the second-hand paperback copy I read this time.\n\n… The Monsters of Templeton by Lauren Groff. I have an incredibly vivid memory of first reading The Monsters of Templeton, back in the summer of 2008, when I was 21, just graduated from my undergrad degree and waiting to start my masters. In the meantime, I was having a miserable time working at Presto Pasties in Bath, which put me off pasties for life; on my lunch breaks, I would sit under the stone arches immediately next to the shop, which sits in the courtyard outside Bath Abbey, and read. I’d checked this novel out of the local library and immediately related to both Willie, our protagonist, who’s dropped out of her archaeology PhD and fled back to her home town of Templeton, and her mother Vi, who captured my imagination by boarding a Greyhound bus back to Templeton in her turn when she was seventeen. (For some reason, Vi ‘in the sun on a shuddering bus… deep in a voluptuous, open-mouthed sleep… having traveled from a mild San Francisco February into an upstate New York ice storm’ made a deep impression on me, an image of freedom and self-reliance). Despite having plans for my immediate future, I guess I, too, was wondering what’s next. Unsurprisingly, then, The Monsters of Templeton did not resonate with me in quite the same way this time round. While I still warmed to Willie, whose story is the right side of quirky, I found most of the historical interludes about her family tree tiresome. The mysterious monster found dead in Lake Glimmerglass is still fantastic, though. #LoveYourLibrary\n\n(It was interesting to reread this right after reading Groff’s latest, The Vaster Wilds, as you can absolutely see how the seeds of that later, bleaker novel were already present in Groff’s mind. The Monsters of Templeton features brief snatches of narration from both eighteenth-century colonisers and from the colonised. And Marmaduke Temple, family patriarch, writes of how, in 1785, he ‘traveled into the vast and melancholy wilderness of New York.’)\n\nThe Book That Most Made Me Want To Play More Computer Games This Month Was…\n\n… Critical Hits: Writers on Gaming and the Alternate Worlds We Inhabit ed. Carmen Maria Machado and J. Robert Lennon. I have intermittently played a few computer games throughout my life (mostly Diablo, Diablo II, The Sims and The Sims 4 – an interesting combination) but I’ve encountered them far more often in the pages of novels like Ready Player One, For The Win and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. Nevertheless, I’m absolutely fascinated by their storytelling potential and in people’s emotional experiences with them, and, like all pop culture, how they weave themselves through our lives – and so I was excited by this collection of essays about digital gaming. In retrospect, Critical Hits starts so strongly that it was almost bound to be disappointing. Machado’s introduction is incredible, if nothing less than I would expect from the writer who dealt with pop culture so brilliantly in In The Dream House.\n\nThe first essay in this collection, Elissa Washuta’s ‘I Struggled A Long Time With Surviving’, is also fantastic. She retells the story of The Last of Us so movingly that I was totally captivated despite knowing very little about the game, linking it to her own experiences of chronic illness. Her White Magic, which I wrote about above, features an essay on Red Dead Redemption 2 that could easily have fit into this anthology, ‘In Him We Have Redemption Through This Blood’. And there are other strong essays in Critical Hits, although none quite so strong as these first two entries. Tony Tulathimutte’s ‘Clash Rules Everything Around Me’ is great on how some things, like gaming, are ranked as ‘a waste of time’ because they are seen as ‘something outside of the narrative of whatever you’ve called your real life, some menial and unproductive activity that doesn’t amass wealth, deepen your relationships and quality of life, or improve you. Something that makes time pass without changing anything else.’ Or in other words, a term that might encompass our deepest flow states and most important experiences, things that can’t be captured in the logic of capitalism because they are unproductive.\n\nHowever, many of the other essays in this collection were forgettable and sometimes a bit frustrating: the writers are often content with pointing out problematic narratives in games without saying anything else, which is important work for reviews or articles, but I expected more from both these individual contributions and from this collection as a whole. My fuller review is on Goodreads. I received a free proof copy of this collection from the publisher for review. It’s out in the UK on 7th November.\n\nThe Best ‘Modern Noir’ Novel I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Stay by Nicola Griffith. I’m never quite sure how to classify the Aud Torvingen novels, probably because they’re a kind of book I would never have picked up if they weren’t written by Nicola Griffith. A lot of reviews call them ‘modern noir’, so let’s go with that. As with the first book in this trilogy, The Blue Place, the draw here is not the familiar plot (bad guy needs to be stopped from people trafficking), but Aud herself, who remains a brilliant character study. She’s still most of the things she was in the first book – former police lieutenant, lesbian, six-foot tall martial arts practitioner, Norwegian-British-American, carpenter – but her social manipulation is dialled right down in this one, probably because she’s dealing with personal trauma. Instead, even more so than before, she prefers to solve problems with violence. Such a brilliant antidote to all the books like this I’ve read about troubled straight men, and, as ever, if Griffith wrote the back of a cereal packet I’d shoot out to buy it. Another classic early 00s cover, as well!\n\ncopyright macrovectorart from 123RF.com\n\nI’m combining my October Superlatives with reviews of two books I read (or part-read) for Spooktastic Reads, which runs from 19th to 31st October, and focuses on ‘stories on the boundaries of fantasy and horror’.\n\nThe Best Spooky Collection of Short Stories I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Never Have I Ever by Isabel Yap. This has been on my TBR for some time, principally because of its stunning cover. Many of Yap’s imaginative and evocative short stories draw from Filipino folklore. There’s dark here – from her take on the manananggal myth in ‘Good Girls’ to her brilliant evocation of the kind of urban legends that circulate in a girls’ school in ‘Have You Heard The One About Anamaria Marquez’ and ‘A Canticle For Lost Girls’. But there’s also a surprisingly joyful, queer short story, ‘A Spell for Foolish Hearts’, which I adored, despite my usual problems with cozy fantasy (see above). Yap is obviously a versatile writer, and here she also moves between stories that feel like pretty faithful folklore retellings (‘How To Swallow The Moon’) to stories inspired by contemporary superhero movies (‘Hurricane Heels (We Go Down Dancing)’). There were two kinds of story in this collection that worked less well for me. The two stories that engage with SF tropes (‘Syringe’ and ‘Milagroso’) felt a bit hackneyed. On the other end of the scale, there were a couple that drift into magical realism, becoming too mystical and vague for my liking (‘Only Unclench Your Hand’, ‘All The Best Of Dark and Bright’). But overall, this is such an impressive collection, and I loved the way that Yap used the language of her Manila girlhood, bits of Tagalog and Spanish slang, without feeling the need to explain it to the reader – when a term is crucial to the story, we’re given enough clues to work it out on her own. This is published by Small Beer Press, who also published one of my favourite short story collections of last year, Zen Cho’s Spirits Abroad, so I’ll need to watch out for more from them.\n\nThe #SpooktasticReads Book That Went Most Wrong For Me This Month Was…\n\n… The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern. A grad student called Zachary discovers a mysterious book that leads him to a magical library. This started brilliantly and I was immersed up until the point Zachary actually enters the library – even the snippets of lore and story, which felt a bit superfluous, were dark enough to add a pleasant chill. But after that, The Starless Sea got increasingly slow and increasingly twee, and the interweaving threads became more and more distracting. Made it about halfway through, but did not finish.\n\nDid you take part in #SpooktasticReads? What were the best and worst books you read this October? And do any of these appeal to you?\n\nThe Best Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Tom Lake by Ann Patchett. This novel is emotionally deep in the same way as a lake itself: you can see right down to the bottom, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a long way down. It’s 2020 and Lara’s three adult daughters have returned to pick cherries on their family farm in northern Michigan in the middle of the pandemic. Isolated from the world, they ask Lara to finally tell them the full story of the few months she spent with the famous actor Peter Duke in 1988. I’ve always thought Patchett is a wonderful writer, but after finding her last two novels, Commonwealth and The Dutch House, quite underwhelming, I’d started to wonder if I was really more of a fan of her non-fiction. It’s such a joy, therefore, to read something like Tom Lake, which I think really represents a step forward for her as a writer: I don’t think it’s necessarily better than the best of her early stuff but it’s as if she’s finally crystallised her more mature voice, moving away from the Anne-Tyler-esque family sagas in her more recent novels to something more reflective, beautiful and resonant. My full review is on Goodreads. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Worst Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Femlandia by Christina Dalcher. After her thought-provoking and moving The Sentence, this was a major disappointment. An unwritten rule seems to have been established over the past few years that all-female communities in speculative and dystopian fiction must be portrayed as brainwashed, abusive cults, and Femlandia is no exception: it ends up being both misogynistic and misanthropic, with a bit of lesbophobia thrown in for good measure. My full rant review is on Goodreads.\n\nThe Book That Made Me Think The Most This Month Was…\n\n… Reverse Engineering II ed. Tom Conaghan. I loved Reverse Engineering so this was a must-read for me – another set of seven short stories with commentary by their authors. And Reverse Engineering II hits higher highs, but also lower lows, than the previous collection, in my opinion. There are some absolutely stunning stories here – the ones that stood out to me all painstakingly and beautifully record the detail of ordinary lives, often hinging on chance encounters in hairdressers, beauty salons, under bridges. Tom Drury’s ‘Path Lights’, Tessa Hadley’s ‘Bad Dreams’, Yiyun Li’s ‘All Will Be Well’ and Wendy Erskine’s ‘To All Their Dues’ were all in this group. I was especially struck by one of Erskine’s reflections on her craft, which is in tension with a lot of contemporary writing advice, but rings absolutely true to me: ‘The thing that is often said about the short story form [and I’d add, about novels as well] is that every single sentence must drive the story forward – I’ve got to say I don’t entirely agree with it… there’s also the room for aspects of the story that are providing a kind of complexity or nuance or supplying a kind of texture… Also, I absolutely hate the idea of backstory. I think that’s such a misnomer. It gives the impression that the past is always subservient to the present and that people’s past experiences are only interesting and have validity in how they form the present.’ My full review is on Goodreads.\n\nThe Most Underwhelming Final Book In A Series I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The Ends by James Smythe. As I gradually progressed through the Anomaly Quartet, I started to realise that one of Smythe’s aims with this series was to critically engage with a specific genre or sub-genre in each of the books. The two strongest entries in the quartet, The Explorer and The Echo, are both takes on different kinds of SF, with a big helping of horror. The Explorer plays with classic SF tropes like the bootstrap, the brave astronaut, the manly space mission; The Echo picks up on the idea of the troubled scientist and the mysterious, abandoned ship. Given this, I found it unsurprising that I struggled with the third instalment, The Edge, which rewrites the psychological thriller: I’m so done with this genre, and so this one inevitably felt less fresh and original to me than the earlier novels. My problems with The Ends were slightly different. This one is post-apocalyptic. The Anomaly has now enveloped the Earth and people can no longer die; they simply follow their own time loops round again. Smythe, again, piles on the tropes: we have a global pandemic, a road trip, a suicide cult. And although The Ends engages intelligently with this source material, these are things that I just don’t find interesting in fiction (I do like a pandemic novel, but that’s not really the focus here) and so there was a limit to how well this book was going to work for me. The treatment of the cult, in particular, felt a bit morally simplistic, and I wondered if there was more Smythe could have done with the brilliant concept of a society that has lost the threat, and release, of death. I will return to the first two Anomaly novels – I already have done – but I’m not sure the second two added much for me. From my 2023 reading list.\n\nThe Book That Most Pleasantly Surprised Me This Month Was…\n\n… All The Lonely People by Mike Gayle. I would NEVER have picked this up had it not been selected as a book club read. I give a wide berth to anything advertised as ‘inspiring’, ‘heartwarming’, ‘uplifting’ or anything that can possibly be compared to Eleanor Oliphant, The Lido or Three Things About Elsie. Also, I’d read one of Gayle’s early chick lit novels and wasn’t a fan. But, this was actually a delight! Hubert Bird is an eighty-four-year-old man living alone in Bromley; part of the Windrush generation, he came to England from Jamaica in 1958. Hubert has withdrawn from the world after something terrible happened five years ago, but when his daughter, Rose, who lives in Australia, announces she is coming to visit, Hubert has to seek out the kind of lively social life he’s been pretending to have during their weekly phone calls, so Rose doesn’t worry about him even more. The rest of the novel alternates between tracing the course of Hubert’s life after his arrival in England, and his efforts to make friends in the present day. I think this worked for me because of its gentle humour; Hubert is a genuinely loveable character, but he has a great line in snarky grumpiness, and the narrator backs him up (‘Hubert was by no means a fan of cat-kind and would chase any feline intruder from his garden with whatever weapon happened to be closest to hand’). Frankly, it’s refreshing to read a novel like this written by a black man rather than a white woman (and I LOVE that Gayle used to be an agony uncle for the teen magazine Bliss – I think I read his ‘boy’s point of view’ columns back in the day!). All The Lonely People skirts the edge of being saccharine, but its emotional honesty helps it stay clear – and I was glad that Gayle didn’t tie up all the loose ends in the novel’s conclusion. A late twist also works far better than any version of this kind of twist I’d read before (and there are a few 🙄). I borrowed this book from North Shields library #LoveYourLibrary\n\nThe Novel That Most Failed To Live Up To Its Potential This Month Was…\n\n… We Measure The Earth With Our Bodies by Tsering Yangzom Lama. This debut novel comes much-garlanded, having been shortlisted for the Giller Prize in 2022 and longlisted for the inaugural Carol Shields Prize in 2023. I picked it up in Toronto because I was attracted by learning more about the experience of Tibetan exiles: it follows sisters Lhamo and Tenkyi, who flee Tibet for Nepal in 1960 following the Chinese invasion, and Lhamo’s daughter, Dolma, who was born in a Nepalese refugee camp but is now trying to pursue graduate studies in ancient Tibetan history in Toronto. Sadly, I was so disappointed that this very much falls into the familiar rut of the ‘inter-generational history of a non-Western family novel’, despite the important things it has to say about the dispossession and colonialisation of Tibet, both by China and by white ‘experts’. I would have loved to read an entire novel about Dolma, but most of We Measure The Earth With Our Bodies follows traditional ‘family saga’ lines, with characters differentiated solely by their roles in the family – sacrificial parents, responsible older sister, love interest – and the storytelling thin in the sections set in the Nepalese camp. Lama faithfully depicts the life lived by Tibetan refugees but it all feels distanced and emotionless. The handling of chronology is awkward, too. I thought this could have been fantastic if it had focused on Tenkyi and Dolma in Toronto and told their story in a simpler chronological order, as Dolma gradually learns about her family history after finding the object that makes her realise just how much has been taken from them. My full review is on Goodreads.\n\nThe Best Speculative Thriller I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The Husbands by Chandler Baker. Given my new Stepford Wives obsession, I had to try this gender-flipped, Texas-set version. And it turned out to be a lot better than I thought it was going to be – even if it doesn’t fully lean into the horror of the Stepford premise. Nora and her husband have a four-year-old daughter and both work full-time, but Nora carries the mental load, which means that she also ends up doing far more for their daughter – especially as her husband contrives to travel slowly home from work or spend a long time in the bathroom when there might be something that needs doing. Nevertheless, he is constantly applauded for being a ‘hands-on’ dad because he sometimes does bath or bedtime. Pregnant again, and trying to make partner at her law firm, Nora knows something has to change. When she meets a group of women with remarkably helpful husbands at the exclusive neighbourhood of Dynasty Ranch, she starts to wonder how she can become part of their world. Baker soft-pedals a bit when it comes to why the husbands are so perfect, which means that The Husbands has less of an edge than it might have done, and we also just don’t get to see enough of their uncanny niceness. Still, I liked how she slowly built up Nora’s resentment of her husband, capturing the drip-drip-drip of someone who isn’t pulling their weight but is doing just enough to avoid scrutiny, and a sub-plot with a teenage daughter of one of the Dynasty families is nicely chilling. I’d read more by Baker.\n\nThe Book I Most Wanted To Like This Month Was…\n\n… Silver Nitrate by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. I so want to love Moreno-Garcia’s novels in general, as they always have amazing, very different premises, and I do admire her short fiction. Unfortunately this is the second book of hers that I haven’t finished (the other being Gods of Jade and Shadow) and so I’m not sure I’ll be picking up anything novel-length from her again, however enticing it sounds. Silver Nitrate has all the ingredients of brilliant speculative horror. Set in Mexico City in the 1990s, it has two great, nuanced protagonists: Monserrat, a stubbornly independent, no-bullshit sound editor, and her childhood friend Tristan, a washed-up soap star. It also has a creepy hook: when Monserrat and Tristan encounter a cult horror director who stopped making films decades ago, the director claims he can change their lives if they help him complete the dubbing of a film made by a Nazi occultist on fragile silver nitrate. Sadly, not only is the pace of this novel incredibly slow (it takes a long time to even get to this inciting incident), even when genuinely frightening things happen, they somehow don’t create the frisson that they should. Everything plays out with the same flat affect. I gave up three-quarters of the way through. My full review is on Goodreads. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nMy Most Illuminating Reread This Month Was…\n\nL: book swap copy, later book-swapped for something else. R: current copy, bought for 99p on Kindle.\n\n… The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, which I first picked up from a book swap while backpacking round South America in 2010. While, in some ways, I learnt nothing new about my tastes from this reread (I rated the book 3.5 stars in both 2010 and 2023), I was struck very differently by the plot, which ends with a white woman illegally adopting a Cherokee child after the abused little girl is abandoned in her truck. Kingsolver clearly clocked that she had Done Wrong here, and tried to fix her mistake by writing an entire sequel, Pigs in Heaven, which I also read this month (for the first time), and which highlights the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 that gave tribal governments exclusive jurisdiction over the fostering or adoption of reservation children.\n\nUnfortunately, I think Kingsolver would have done better to leave the matter alone: Pigs in Heaven manages to make the whole thing even more uncomfortable than it was before, and, lacking the strong first-person narration that made The Bean Trees so striking, is a much weaker novel (the first line of The Bean Trees is just brilliant, establishing character, setting and voice in one fell swoop: ‘I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up and throw Newt Hardbine’s father over the top of the Standard Oil sign‘.) It was, however, fascinating to read The Bean Trees, Kingsolver’s debut, having recently read her latest, Demon Copperhead: they share much in common, possibly more than anything else Kingsolver has written*. Both are completely made by their fantastic narrators, Taylor and Demon; both deal with the impact of growing up in rural poverty in the Appalachians; and both are occasionally marred by preachiness and sentimentality, though I’d say The Bean Trees is heavier on the latter but lighter on the former than Demon Copperhead. In short, Kingsolver fans, it’s worth trying The Bean Trees, but I’d skip Pigs In Heaven.\n\n*unless Animal Dreams is super similar – it’s now the only Kingsolver novel I haven’t read!\n\nWhat were your best and worst reads this month? Have you read any of these books?\n\nThis post will contain major spoilers for My Cousin Rachel.\n\nBefore rereading: I first read My Cousin Rachel in July 2005, when I was 18. I was on a family holiday in Slovenia and Croatia the summer before I started university and was mentally in a very dark place; I remember the constant, solid sunlight and how far removed it was from how I was feeling. I decided to reread it this summer after reading JP Delaney’s The New Wife, which is a modern take on the novel.\n\nThe first time I read My Cousin Rachel, I left no record of my thoughts on it, but I remember thinking that, although I liked it, I hadn’t connected with it in the same way as Rebecca – not necessarily because I thought it was a worse book, but because it was darker and more difficult. I imagine that the mood I was in when I read it didn’t lend itself to loving anything. I was likely disgusted by Sally Beauman’s introduction to this edition, which argues that My Cousin Rachel is a feminist text because it shows how Rachel is trapped by the possessiveness of patriarchal society, and the novel is really about the poison of misogyny. I’d hated Beauman’s take on Rebecca, and although this one is a bit more sensible, I would have disagreed then and I still disagree now.\n\nAfter rereading: This is such an unforgettable novel. I hesitate to say it’s a better novel than Rebecca, because I don’t think it is – but I’d argue that it is more technically brilliant, more perfectly paced, lacking that slightly baggy and repetitive middle. And what makes it so unforgettable, for me, are several things: the impossibility of fully reading Rachel; the way that du Maurier sweeps us into Philip’s emotional world, much as she does with that of Mrs de Winter; and the heartbreaking ending. It’s clear that Philip, the young man who becomes obsessed with Rachel after she becomes first his cousin Ambrose’s wife and then his widow, is no innocent victim.\n\nDu Maurier clearly enjoys showing not only how the misogyny that Philip learnt from Ambrose is wrong-headed, but how many of his statements about women perfectly describe him. When he cannot understand Rachel’s emotional response in one of their conversations, he asks himself ‘What trail of thought, confused and indirect, drove through those minds of [women], to cloud their judgment? What waves of impulse swept about their being, moving them to anger and withdrawal, or else to sudden generosity? We [men] were surely different, with our blunter comprehension, moving more slowly to the compass points, while they, erratic and unstable, were blown about their course by winds of fancy.’ This comes from a man who abruptly decides to bestow his entire fortune upon Rachel; who moves from declaring his love for her to putting his hands around her neck; who throws himself into the sea to swim one night even though it’s freezing cold. Meanwhile, almost everything Rachel does seems increasingly deliberate.\n\nPart of the draw of My Cousin Rachel is the fact that everyone who reads it will have their own interpretation of Philip, and of Rachel, and that this may well change on a re-read. I can’t remember what I thought first time round, but it does seem to me that for this novel to work we have to believe good and bad of them both. It would be a boring story if Rachel were simply an evil witch; but an even more boring story, if, as Beauman wants it, she were simply a helpless victim. I also think that we need to sympathise with Philip, at least partly, to be drawn into the emotional heart of the book. This doesn’t mean that we can’t sympathise with Rachel as well, but that we do have to desperately hope, as Philip does, that Rachel is what she seems, so we can be truly invested in working her out. Even though, of course, we never will.\n\nOn this read-through, I felt fairly convinced that Rachel married Ambrose for his money, and upon his death came to England in the hope of squeezing more money out of his heir, Philip; she agrees to marry Philip to get the estate, and abandons the idea when Philip gives it to her anyway. What is much more doubtful is whether, as Philip believes by the end, she poisoned Ambrose, and then Philip himself. I don’t think that she did; she had nothing to gain from poisoning either of them, unless she believed that Ambrose had signed his will (and she’s obviously not stupid; surely she would have checked?). This makes the relationship between Philip and Rachel satisfyingly complex. She is manipulating him, but she may have been genuinely grieved by Ambrose’s death, may have come to feel something for Philip himself, even after he turns violently against her. Rachel isn’t just a pawn; she may even be the queen; but she isn’t the one who wrote the rules of the game.\n\nRating July 2005: predates my rating systems, probably ****\n\nRating June 2023: *****\n\nThe Best Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Phase Six by Jim Shepard. This is the best book about the immediate onset of, and response to, a pandemic that I’ve ever read. Unlike most pandemic literature (for example: Emily St John Mandel’s wonderful Station Eleven), Phase Six is very closely focused on the first few weeks and months after a new pathogen is released into the environment due to the thawing of Greenlandic permafrost. Jim Shepard digs deep to produce an incredibly well-researched picture of how the CDC, WHO, and healthcare centres might respond, which I found fascinating to read in its own right. I love medical detail, especially epidemiology, and the way Shepard has woven in references to Covid-19 in what was clearly a later draft of this novel only emphasises how realistic his original version was. However, Shepard also transcends this material to tell the human stories of a handful of characters caught up in this pandemic; the abrupt and open ending is intentionally frustrating, but also beautiful, speaking to how our own personal stories always finish before we want them to. This makes Phase Six sound like a dark and difficult read, but I didn’t find it so. In many ways, it’s uplifting, emphasising co-operation and collaboration between humans rather than selfishness. This is not a dystopian novel, but a realistic exploration of how people respond to adversity, and the power as well as the limitations of scientific research. If the Wellcome Book Prize had still been active in 2021, this would have been a perfect winner.\n\nThe Worst Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Nineteen Claws and a Black Bird by Agustina Bazterrica, trans. Sarah Moses. This collection of very short stories has echoes of a number of other collections I’ve read recently about girls and women, sex and violence; the stories that worked better for me in Nineteen Claws and a Black Bird, like ‘Roberto’ and ‘Unamuno’s Boxes’, are reminiscent of writers like Julia Armfield, Carmen Maria Machado and Kate Folk, whereas the more experimental and bizarre pieces, like ‘Candy Pink’ and ‘Dishwasher’, reminded me more of Irenosen Okojie‘s stories with their accumulation of detail, a style I’ve struggled with in the past. Most of the stories aim to shock and I found that, once I’d worked out the pattern, I was often just waiting for the twist ending, so although they are tonally different, they also feel very similar. I wasn’t greatly impressed. I received a free proof copy of this collection from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Book I Just Simply Enjoyed The Most This Month Was…\n\n… Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld. Sittenfeld is such a reliable joy for me; if you exclude her bizarre Eligible, I’ve loved everything she’s ever written. And her latest novel is just as captivating, if not as complex as some of her other work. Sally works as a scriptwriter on comedy sketch show The Night Owls [Saturday Night Live]. When her friend Danny hooks up with a movie star, she’s frustrated enough at this latest example of a trend to propose a sketch that she calls ‘The Danny Horst Rule’: men often date and marry women far more beautiful and successful than them, but ordinary women never end up with celebrity men. Of course, before Sally has even finished writing her sketch, she’s met pop idol Noah, who seems interested in her – but obviously, he can’t be. Can he? The first third of this novel was the most truly satisfying for me, as Sittenfeld convincingly explores the way Sally’s show is put together, with some great observations on how comedy sketches are written, and traces her developing connection with Noah as well as her sparky friendships with her colleagues. The rest of the book, which relies heavily on emails, felt slighter, giving Sittenfeld less opportunity to show what she’s good at, which is mapping complicated human connections. Nevertheless, it made me reflect that if all romance was written this well, I might be more of a fan of the genre.\n\nThe Book That Was Ruined By Its Protagonist This Month Was…\n\n… Girl In Ice by Erica Ferencik. I ought to have loved this slow-burn speculative thriller, which ticked all my boxes. Set in a remote Arctic research station, it focuses on the mysterious thawing of a small girl, alive, from the ice. How did she survive, and will she continue to do so? At the same time, there’s a nice touch of horror with the introduction of freezing katabatic winds that are striking people unawares throughout the world and killing them on the spot. Ferencik is a great writer, and the Arctic landscape is beautifully evoked. BUT, I could not handle Girl In Ice‘s protagonist, a linguist called Val who suffers from such crippling anxiety that she has barely travelled anywhere in her life and relies heavily on medication, which she starts to supplement with alcohol once she’s forced to travel out to the Arctic to try and understand what the unfrozen girl is saying. I’m absolutely on board with novels exploring this kind of anxiety and trauma, but I just don’t think it can be explored well in this kind of thriller, and yet novelists keep on trying to do it (see also: The Dark by Emma Haughton). In this sort of book, I really want a competent and practical protagonist who’s able to deal sensibly with other people. It made me reflect on why the nervous, incompetent protagonist of Ferencik’s first, brilliant thriller, The River At Night, worked so well for me: one, she wasn’t faced with urgent research mysteries, and two, her apprehension about going white-water rafting turned out to be totally reasonable and justified! Other readers, though, might warm to Val more than I did.\n\nThe Best Novel I Read About Capitalism This Month Was…\n\n… For The Win by Cory Doctorow. Set between LA, South China and Mumbai in the near-future, this novel follows a group of young people, mostly teenagers, who are getting exploited by capitalist bosses in their low-wage, long-hour jobs. However, its major focus isn’t the traditional setting of the factory but the virtual world of online multiplayer games, where most of the protagonists are making money by churning through quests to earn virtual gold and level up avatars that can be sold on to richer players. ‘Gold farming’ in these games is technically illegal, but there’s little the game companies can do about it. This means, though, that gold farmers are vulnerable to mistreatment, getting locked out of their workplaces – internet cafes – or having their pay cut if they dare to complain. Big Sister Nor, who started off organising workers in the ‘real world’, now leads trade union Industrial Workers of the World Wide Web, or the ‘Webblies’, playing on the ‘Wobblies’ of the early twentieth-century US. The Webblies are trying to organise workers across borders, breaking down old rules about unionisation, which is often about resisting undercutting by foreign labour; but they have all the power of the internet on their side.\n\nFor The Win is both a fast-paced techno-thriller and a crash course in basic economics and how workers might stand up for their rights. It’s now more than a decade old, but it possibly feels even more relevant today than it did when it was published. I loved the way that Doctorow weaves his accessible explanations into the story, and how this information becomes crucial as the plot unfolds. I also loved that this is a story without individual villains. There are people who do bad things, but the antagonist is the bigger social and economic system rather than any of our narrating characters, even those who hold power in companies like Nintendo. This was apparently badged as YA when it was first sold, but it definitely doesn’t feel like a young adult novel – though I’m sure many teenagers would get a lot out of it. It’s basically a serious, thoughtful and yet still fun examination of what Marx would have called alienated labour. Brilliant. I borrowed this book from my local library #LoveYourLibrary\n\nThe Best Summer Thriller I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The New Wife by JP Delaney. I’ve read and enjoyed some of Delaney’s earlier thrillers, but this felt like a big, and interesting, change of pace. (The cover art reflects the way his other books have been marketed, but doesn’t feel right at all for this novel – don’t be put off!). Finn and his sister grew up in Mallorca on a decaying finca, but after an abusive childhood, both of them left in their teens and haven’t looked back. Now their father has died and they’ve inherited the finca – but their father’s new wife, Ruensa, is still living there with her adult daughter Roze. Finn travels to Mallorca to sort out the legalities, but is stunned by what he finds – Ruensa and Roze have transformed the finca and its grounds, planning to set it up as a functioning agrotourism spot and a hostel for hikers. Moreover, he’s immediately attracted to Roze, who draws him in with her mix of lightheartedness, practicality, and fragility. But was it really a coincidence that Finn’s father died so shortly after his marriage? And will Ruensa and Roze give up their fledging business so easily?\n\nIn short: this is a retelling of Daphne du Maurier’s unforgettable My Cousin Rachel, and Delaney does capture some of its beauty and menace, gorgeously evoking his Mallorcan setting. As with Rachel in the du Maurier novel, we both want Roze to be what she seems and fear that she isn’t – Delaney makes it completely convincing that Finn would be entranced by her against his better judgment. A late twist is effective, but I did feel that, unlike My Cousin Rachel, The New Wife then leans a little too hard into one interpretation of the characters, despite Delaney’s efforts to keep the ending open. Du Maurier said that she deliberately never made up her mind about Rachel’s true motives; Delaney admits, in his afterword, that he does know what Roze was about. Nevertheless, this is perfect summer reading.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review. It’s out in the UK on 20th July.\n\nThe Best Debut Novel I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Neon Roses by Rachel Dawson. It’s 1984 in the valleys of South Wales, and Eluned is tired of her boyfriend, her job and her life. In the midst of the miners’ strike, having fun is a distant memory, as all her wages need to go to support her family. Even worse, her sister Mabli is sleeping with the enemy, being wined and dined by one of the policemen who oppress the miners on the pickets. When LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners) turn up in Eluned’s village, her attraction to lesbian June makes her realise why she has never quite fit in with her community’s expectations – but can she really leave her whole life behind? This accomplished novel vividly evokes a range of settings across Britain in the mid-1980s, from rural Wales to Cardiff to London to Manchester. It has all the verisimilitude of Louise Kennedy’s Trespasses but, for me, much more originality and heart. As a historian of this period, I loved how effortlessly Dawson brought queer communities and protest movements to life, weaving in detail without over-explaining or overloading. I know much less about the specifics of her South Wales setting, but I felt that was also beautifully done; Dawson refuses to pander to the reader by explaining the ‘Wenglish’ that many of her characters use, but I never felt lost. There’s a depth to this novel that is absent from most twentieth-century historical fiction.\n\nMy only question is: why didn’t I love it more, as it literally ticks all my boxes? This is probably a me problem rather than a book problem, but I never quite warmed to Eluned as much as I wanted to, despite the homophobia and hardship she faces, and the solidarity she shows. (So great to read a book that understands that identifying as a lesbian, especially in the 1980s, is about more than who you sleep with.) On a macro level, she never seemed to truly experience any vulnerability, although I can appreciate that Dawson puts her in many situations where she’s positioned as vulnerable; something about what was happening to Eluned on the outside and what was happening in her head didn’t quite connect. On a micro level, I wondered if this wasn’t helped by the slightly detached prose, which keeps us at a fair distance from Eluned (Dawson continually uses ‘Eluned’ when ‘she’ would have done, and this jolted me outside of her consciousness). I wanted to fall in love with Eluned and June, and I just didn’t. Nevertheless, a brilliant debut. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Re-Read That Made Me Think The Most About Rereading This Month Was…\n\n… The Wonder Spot by Melissa Bank. I adored this novel when I first read it aged twenty, in 2007; I re-read it in 2008 and 2009, and was equally captivated each time. Last summer, I re-read Bank’s debut, The Girls’ Guide To Hunting and Fishing, which I never had liked as much, and commented ‘I enjoyed revisiting Girls’ Guide, but I have much higher hopes for [rereading] The Wonder Spot’. Both books follow a similar trajectory, tracing the life of a young Jewish woman struggling with jobs and dating; in The Wonder Spot, our heroine is Sophie. I do still think The Wonder Spot is better than Girls’ Guide; the humour is subtler, and Bank has abandoned the tics that annoyed me in her first novel. But, I was disappointed! Although I still admired Bank’s observational skill and the way she doesn’t feel the need to tell the reader everything, I couldn’t remember why I had once loved The Wonder Spot so much.\n\nI think this was a book that spoke much more to my younger self; I intensely re-read it during the period of my life when I was struggling the most with romantic relationships, meeting men (that was my first mistake) who messed me around, played games or just weren’t right. And The Wonder Spot is incredibly good at showing us, rather than telling us, why Sophie’s relationships don’t work out. Most of the chapters in the book stand alone as short stories that dissect the behaviour of men who seem to have potential, but just aren’t the one; I especially enjoyed ‘Teen Romance’ and ‘The One After You’, which have the most mature takes on Sophie’s love life. More than fifteen years on, though, this reminded me too much of the Disaster Women novels that are now so popular, although Sophie is definitely Gen X rather than a millennial or Gen Z, and Bank can write much better than most. Having said that, though, I would press her books on anybody who actually likes this kind of fiction; Bank was well ahead of her time. PUBLISHERS TAKE NOTE: if this were rejacketed for 2023, I think it would be a hit again.\n\nWhat books stood out for you in May?\n\nHere we go again! Quite a positive bunch of Superlatives this time round…\n\nThe Best Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Fire Rush by Jacqueline Crooks. Set at the dawn of the Thatcher era, this follows a young British-Jamaican woman, Yemaye, as she raves in dub reggae clubs and encounters the hard side of the British state she calls ‘Babylon’. This isn’t a perfect novel, but if it was, it probably wouldn’t be as good. I’d love to see this win the Women’s Prize. My full review is here. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Worst Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… And Put Away Childish Things by Adrian Tchaikovsky. This is the third in a thematically-linked set of three novellas by Tchaikovsky published in the UK by Rebellion Publishing; I liked the first, Walking to Aldebaran, so I thought I would try this one. And Put Away Childish Things is a portal fantasy where a man stumbles into the world of the beloved children’s series his grandmother wrote (think Narnia) and encounters unexpected horrors. To be honest, I wouldn’t have picked up a book with this blurb if it wasn’t by Tchaikovsky, whom I also know and admire from his Children of Time trilogy. I adore the idea of stumbling into an imaginary world that’s come alive but have found that the execution never works for me. People always seem to end up in the tweest of children’s literature rather than entering the genuinely frightening and original landscapes that characterise many children’s books. The whole thing feels silly to me when I want it to be scary. Sadly, And Put Away Childish Things falls into exactly the same traps. Probably a Just Not for Me rather than a novella that’s objectively bad, but I would love to see a writer properly and seriously explore the imaginative spaces of childhood. I received a free proof copy of this novella from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Best Book About Siblinghood I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Homesick by Jennifer Croft. Amy and Zoe grow up in their own world, homeschooled after Zoe develops a brain tumour, constructing their own universe of shared references, words and games. But when Amy leaves for college at fifteen after a sudden tragedy, the sisters’ childhood abruptly comes to an end. Homesick was first published in Spanish as Serpientes y escaleras (Snakes and Ladders) before being published in the US in 2019 by Unnamed Press as a memoir with photographs and then published in the UK in 2022 by Charco Press in this novel-form with no images. And the first half of this text, where we are also bound by the tight limitations of Amy and Zoe’s early years, is mesmerising. It’s remarkably elevated from the many novels that touch on sisterhood and growing up: I think because of the serious, concentrated attention that Croft gives to the girls’ experiences, refusing to sentimentalise or to slip into cliches about childhood or about ‘opposite’ or competing siblings. It resonated deeply with me as somebody who was only homeschooled for a very short time in my childhood, but nevertheless grew up very close to my younger sister after moving from the US to Britain, uprooted from all our friends and cultural references, and then ending up living in a pretty rural location. While I was reading this first half, I was sure this was going to be a five-star read for me. It’s a shame, therefore, that it peters out somewhat in the second half, feeling thinner and rushed after the slow, intense build of the sections that focus on childhood, and I didn’t feel that Croft quite tied everything together thematically. Still, probably the best thing I’ve read on this kind of siblinghood. This novel has been longlisted for the Women’s Prize for Fiction 2023. I borrowed it from the library #LoveYourLibrary\n\nMy Best Reread This Month Was…\n\n… Girl With A Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier, which I first read in 2003 (when I was Griet’s age at the start of the novel, ouch) and re-read again in 2004 and 2011. This re-read was inspired by visiting the Vermeer exhibition in Amsterdam and finally seeing ‘Girl With A Pearl Earring’ in real life. I’ve always found Chevalier a bit hit-and-miss, but for my money this is a really good novel, easily her best. It’s so interesting that she wrote it in a compressed time-frame because she was pregnant; the straightforward, elegant narrative works so well, and makes Griet’s narration so convincing. This time round, I found myself reflecting on how many ‘rules’ of fiction this hugely successful novel breaks. Most obviously, Griet is an almost entirely passive protagonist. She has little agency and her actions don’t drive the story forward. Chevalier does pick up on some quiet moments when Griet’s decision to share an observation with Vermeer is significant, but these are limited. But Griet works so well for me as a character precisely because of her lack of agency. First, it’s realistic; second, it makes her much more sympathetic, as we see how she’s caught between the demands of her different employers. She has no wish to risk her place as a maid, a key source of income for her family, but she has no choice. I’ve also always loved the melancholy ending.\n\nThe Best SF Novel I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Frontier by Grace Curtis. This satisfyingly strange debut novel augments its SF setting with western vibes. It opens when an escape pod crashes into the parched landscape of a future Earth, and our protagonist steps out into an unfamiliar land. As she searches for a way to communicate with Noelle, the lover she left behind, she encounters drug-carrying tortoises, threatening saints, complex barter systems and apartments built within the ruins of an old spaceship. Curtis constructs the novel through a series of vignettes, and we often see our protagonist through the eyes of other characters. This kind of quest narrative rarely works for me, but it does here because Curtis uses it as a way of letting us walk through the world she’s created, and explore the different societies people have built up since the vast majority of the population left Earth. Despite the devastation caused by climate change and the presence of fundamentalist religion, Frontier feels bright and fun rather than grim: Curtis enjoys playing with western tropes, and the focus is on how we rebuild rather than on how we destroy. It’s the atmosphere of this world that will remain with me rather than the specifics of the story, but I look forward to whatever Curtis writes next. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Best Book Set In A Convent I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The Book of Eve by Meg Clothier. As you may know, I am a big fan of novels set in convents. This one is a quasi-historical novel set in a version of Renaissance Florence, though it’s difficult to pin down precisely – the book at the centre of the novel is inspired by the fifteenth-century Voynich manuscript, but the story and setting also reminded me strongly of Sarah Dunant’s Sacred Hearts, set in a late sixteenth-century Ferrara convent. Like Bridget Collins’s The Binding, this is basically fantasy dressed up as history. This decision serves Clothier well, as she is able to infuse magic into her story almost imperceptibly at first. Our protagonist is Beatrice, the convent librarian, who comes across the titular book and gradually realises both that there is something strange about it and that other people want it very badly. But one of the strengths of Clothier’s novel – and something that often flourishes in a convent setting – is the way she develops the wider cast of convent sisters. Mother Chiara is especially vivid and interesting, but I also enjoyed many of the women who get less page-time, like Hildegard. For me, the first half of this novel was strongest, beautifully immersive. It became a little more familiar when the pace picks up, and we get a rather cartoonish religious villain. However, there’s just enough weirdness to stop it becoming too simplistically emancipatory. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Best Thriller I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The Lost Night by Andrea Bartz. Lindsay’s best friend Edie killed herself in 2009; ten years on, Lindsay discovers an unsettling video that suggests that she might have been involved in Edie’s death, and given that she can’t remember chunks of that night, she doesn’t know how to prove otherwise. Unsurprisingly, I didn’t spend my early twenties in a Brooklyn party loft, but I don’t think I’ve ever read anything that’s so evocative of that particular life stage for millennials of my age. There are a ton of books about nostalgia for the late teens and university years, but Bartz is so good at capturing what’s particularly special and difficult about striking out on your own, when you think you’re really grown-up but are still a very young adult. Lindsay’s growing horror as she starts to doubt herself is gripping and disorientating, too. As ever with thrillers (Bartz’s We Were Never Here commits the same crime) this has a bit of a silly twist ending, but it’s worth reading for the central chunk of the story.\n\nDid you have any stand-out reads this month? Anything you hated? Anything you loved?\n\nBefore re-reading: I first read this in May 2012, when I was 25. I’m fairly certain I bought it as part of a Waterstones 3 for 2, given the patch on the front cover where there was once a sticker. We’ve been flooded by Greek myth retellings in recent years, but back then, this felt like something new and different.\n\nThe first time I read The Song of Achilles, I wrote a very long review! You can read the full thing here, but in summary: I loved this novel when I first read it, thinking that ‘Miller has a wonderful command of the pace, letting the story lull and loiter, at certain points, only to engage the reader’s interest more strongly when the next part of the tale kicks into action. There are several mini-stories told throughout the novel; Patroclus’s childhood; training with Chiron; journey to Troy; the saga of Briseis; Achilles’ quarrel with Agamemnon; and Miller unites them beautifully, but lets each tale complete itself before going onto the next. The most resonant scene in the novel, for me, was the well-known sequence where King Priam comes to beg Achilles for his son’s body; a scene that is powerful because it has equal resonance for a modern and classical audience, I imagine. “It is right to seek peace for the dead,” Priam tells the bereaved Achilles. “You and I both know there is no peace for those who live after.”‘\n\nHowever, I did have some concerns about ‘the softening of the harsh classical belief systems of honour and sacrifice’ in the novel, especially through ‘Patroclus’s intense human sympathy and fellow-feeling for those suffering’. I thought that I would have liked to see Miller make ‘Achilles and Patroclus sympathetic in spite of this, rather than simply removing the obstacles to our identification with them… Patroclus’s modern values make Achilles and Patroclus feel sundered, set apart from the rest of the classical-minded Greeks, and I wanted to feel that they were part of that culture, even if their homosexual relationship differentiated them from the other men.’\n\nAfter re-reading: This was an interesting one to reread! I felt like the doubts I expressed in my first review all crystallised into one big problem: the characterisation of Patroclus. I seem to have liked him a lot more when I first read The Song of Achilles, but this time round, I had doubts about him from the very first pages. I’m not sure why Miller decided to make him quite so useless at everything, so passive, so negative, so obsessed with Achilles to the exclusion of everything else. He sits at odds with the rest of the novel and with the society he’s grown up in, and made me feel, for most of the narrative, that Miller had tried too hard to make him an exception to this cult of heroic masculinity, which speaks to the ‘softening’ of the story I originally observed. It’s especially bizarre that she makes him totally unable to fight, given that we know he does a good enough job when he dons Achilles’ armour. Maybe she was trying to say something interesting about how inhabiting a different role unleashes abilities we didn’t know we had – but unfortunately, because Patroclus has skived military training for most of his life in this retelling, it’s just unbelievable that he’d perform well.\n\nIn contrast, Achilles is incredibly compelling: perhaps idealised for much of the text, but then, he’s the son of a goddess, and I don’t think the normal rules apply. I loved how Miller showed how his life was fundamentally shaped by divine foreknowledge: first, the knowledge that he will be the greatest of the Greeks, then the knowledge that he will die at Troy, and so he’s sacrificed the rest of his life in service of his honour. This is how you modernise a story like this, for my money: think through the real psychological burdens of believing these kind of prophecies. When Achilles seeks revenge on Agamemnon near the end of the novel by using Briseis as a pawn, his actions aren’t sympathetic but they are understandable because we know he’s staked so much on his reputation. (In contrast, Patroclus hangs around in the background being useless and ‘nice’, happy to let Briseis carry on being in love with him, which feels especially distasteful after he previously slept with another woman because he felt sorry for her). The secondary cast are also brilliantly portrayed: I LOVED Odysseus, as before, and feel even more aggrieved at how Miller does him wrong in Circe; she manages a morally grey Achilles here, but is happy to cast Odysseus to the dogs.\n\nHaving said all this, The Song of Achilles still stands as one of the best of the modern Greek myth retellings I have read, alongside Pat Barker’s The Silence of the Girls – and its last hundred pages are truly brilliant, as Achilles and Patroclus both cast aside much of the idealisation that constrained them during the rest of the novel, and become much more compromised, and more interesting, men.\n\nRating May 2012: ****1/2\n\nRating March 2023: ****\n\nI originally borrowed this post format from Elle; I enjoyed writing these posts so much last year that I’ve decided to bring them back for 2023!\n\nThe Best Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… I Have Some Questions for You by Rebecca Makkai. Pleasingly, unlike the set of books I read in January, there was some stiff competition for this coveted slot this month, and I’ve put a couple of honourable mentions below. However, this prep school novel won through because it was one of those rare books that was both completely gripping and immersive, but also so thoughtful and thought-provoking. I just loved reading it so much. My full review is here.\n\nHon. mentions: Bad Cree by Jessica Johns and Hijab Butch Blues by Lamya H.\n\nThe Worst Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The Witch in the Well by Camilla Bruce. This novel focuses on a rekindled rivalry between childhood friends Catherine and Elena after they both decide to write books about a figure that haunts the history of their town. That figure is Ilsbeth Clark, a woman accused of horrific crimes in the nineteenth century. It’s constructed mostly from a series of documents: Catherine and Elena’s own narratives, plus excerpts from Catherine’s novel and sections from the historical records she’s been researching in the archives. Another, undocumented voice intrudes occasionally, and refreshingly, but this is the bulk of the novel. And unfortunately, in striving to give Elena and Catherine distinctive voices, Bruce makes them both hopelessly irritating. Elena uses plentiful hashtags, CAPS LOCKS and exclamation marks; Catherine, despite her more formal prose, actually sounds quite similar; both come off as equally deluded. I’m a big fan of an unsympathetic narrator but they have to be interesting, and I had no interest in either of these women. The only bit that gave me any kind of frisson was the description of the ‘witch in the well’ game played in the school playground, stepping in and out of a circle of chalk; otherwise, this totally lacked atmosphere. I received a free proof copy of this book from the publisher for review.\n\nMy Favourite Reread This Month Was…\n\n… The Life and Death of Sophie Stark by Anna North. I first read this novel back in 2015 and named it as one of my top ten books of the decade in 2019, so I’m glad it held up! It tells the story of unconventional filmmaker and director, Sophie Stark, though a range of narrators; Sophie herself never gets to narrate, but we hear from her lover, her brother, her husband, her producer. North’s prose is utterly hypnotic, and I spent most of the book trying to work out how she does it (especially as I’ve since read her Outlawed and liked it a lot, but didn’t think it was nearly this brilliant). I think what makes this book so great is its series of nested stories. It starts with a woman telling a story on a stage and never really leaves that mode. I felt glued to the page by the narrative drive of a campfire tale, even when the stories told were much more complex and difficult. Sophie herself is a fantastic character, properly weird rather than movie weird, and both hard to like and to truly dislike. It was particularly special to read this book around visiting a wonderful exhibition at the film museum in Amsterdam, Saodat Ismailova’s 18,000 Worlds.\n\nHon. mention: Orkney by Amy Sackville, which I liked as much as I did last time I read it, back in 2013… but I do think it should have been a novella, which is possibly the only time I’ve ever said that!\n\nThe Best Ghost Story I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The Upstairs Room by Kate Murray-Browne. Another reread! This debut, which I first read back in 2018, has been so thoroughly misunderstood by Goodreads reviewers that I want to shout its praises everywhere. It’s not a thriller or a (traditional) ghost story, but a deeply unsettling dissection of why we settle where and when we do – whether that’s in a relationship, in a job, or in a house. Any summary of the novel makes it sound like a mix of the ‘rootless millennial woman’ genre crossed with ‘middle-aged people’s marriage troubles’, but Murray-Browne’s writing is just so good: one of the writers that makes me feel I’m looking more clearly at the world after reading her, that my own life has been placed into better order. I’d shelve this next to Naomi Booth’s Exit Management. I’m thrilled to hear that Murray-Browne has a new novel coming out in 2024, which sounds great: ‘One Girl Began entwines the stories of three women, separated by history but connected by the same building. For Ellen in 1909, it is a box factory where she finds work and a transformative circle of friendship when her family fall on hard times. For Frances in 1984, it is a derelict ruin, where she joins a group of squatters and is drawn into a coercive relationship. And for Amanda in 2020, it is a gentrified conversion, where she finds herself trapped in a tiny flat and grappling with new motherhood as the pandemic looms into view. Over the span of 111 years these three women will come to haunt one another backwards and forwards in time.’\n\nThe Silliest Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… The Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi. Jamie is fired from his job at a food delivery start-up at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic but then gets a new job opportunity; he can go and work in an alternative version of Earth, where tropical jungle covers Canada and enormous kaiju roam wild. But as the kaiju are powered by organic nuclear reactors, things could quickly get out of hand. This book is not intended to be serious. As Scalzi writes in his afterword, ‘KPS is not, and I say this with absolutely no slight intended, a brooding symphony of a novel. It’s a pop song.’ And it is pretty much as silly and fun as it promises, with a likeable protagonist and a serviceable secondary cast of scientists who work with the kaiju. For peak escapism, I would have preferred it to be a bit more immersive – the jungle setting is barely described and I felt like there was too much snarky dialogue, not enough space for the concept to breathe. Still, it’s hard to feel badly towards this novel.\n\nThe Best Sequel I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Hell Bent by Leigh Bardugo. I was worried that this sequel to Ninth House might have too much action for me, but while I feel this Yale-set dark academia series could still stand to let its characters breathe a bit more, Hell Bent hits about the same balance as the first book, and is just as atmospheric. Alex is back for a second year at Yale, trying to perform the duties of Lethe by herself while investigating the mysterious murders of two faculty members. Looking forward to the third book!\n\nHave you read any standout books in February?"
