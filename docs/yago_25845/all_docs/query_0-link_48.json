He worked on the implementation of the progressive 2010 Kenyan Constitution as head of the Judiciary and President of the apex court in the country. He advocated, in his writings and judgments, for the development of indigenous, robust, patriotic, decolonized, progressive jurisprudence that is not insular and does not pay unthinking deference to other jurisdictions, regardless of how prominent they may be. He has also advocated for a progressive jurisprudence for Africa and the global south as part of the signiﬁcant contribution in the struggle for a new just, peaceful, and equitable world.\n\nDuring his tenure as Chief Justice, Mutunga sought to lay permanent and indestructible foundations for a transformed judiciary.

He supported and strengthened the Judicial Training Institute as a nucleus for juristic training and an institution of higher learning.
