Tezepelumab, a human monoclonal antibody, blocks thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of tezepelumab with increased statistical precision in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and perennial aeroallergen sensitization using pooled data from the phase 2b PATHWAY and phase 3 NAVIGATOR studies.\n\nMethods: PATHWAY (NCT02054130) and NAVIGATOR (NCT03347279) were multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with similar designs. Patients who received tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks and had a positive or negative fluorescence enzyme immunoassay test for serum-specific immunoglobulin E against at least one perennial aeroallergen were included in this analysis. The annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks (primary endpoint in both trials) and the annualized rate of exacerbations that required hospitalization or an emergency department (ED) visit over 52 weeks were assessed in patients grouped by perennial allergic status.\n\nResults: Overall, 1299 patients were included; 815 (63%) had perennial aeroallergen sensitization and 484 (37%) did not. Tezepelumab reduced the AAER over 52 weeks compared with placebo by 62% (95% CI: 53–70) in patients with perennial aeroallergen sensitization and by 54% (95% CI: 38–66) in those without. The annualized rate of exacerbations that required hospitalization or an ED visit was reduced with tezepelumab compared with placebo by 80% (95% CI: 61–90) in patients with perennial aeroallergen sensitization and by 74% (95% CI: 41–88) in those without.\n\nConclusions: Tezepelumab reduced exacerbations compared with placebo, including those that required hospitalization or an ED visit, in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma with or without perennial aeroallergen sensitization. These findings further support the benefits of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma, including those with allergic and non-allergic asthma.\n\n2 Effect of tezepelumab on seasonal exacerbations in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma grouped by blood eosinophil count\n\nJonathan Corren1, Andrew Menzies-Gow2, Christopher S.

In the phase 3 NAVIGATOR study (NCT03347279), tezepelumab reduced exacerbations in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma with high or low baseline blood eosinophil counts (BECs) and across all seasons in the overall population. This pre-specified exploratory analysis evaluated the effect of tezepelumab on seasonal asthma exacerbation rates in NAVIGATOR patients grouped by baseline BEC.\n\nMethods: NAVIGATOR was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients (12–80 years old) were randomized 1:1 to tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) was assessed by season in patients grouped by baseline BEC. Data from patients in the southern hemisphere were transformed to align with northern hemisphere seasons.\n\nResults: Of 1059 treated patients, 618 had a BEC of < 300 cells/μL and 441 had a BEC of ≥ 300 cells/μL at baseline. In the placebo group, there were seasonal variations in the AAER, with a peak in winter of 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.85, 2.91) and 3.07 (95% CI: 2.36, 4.00) in patients with BEC of < 300 cells/µL and ≥ 300 cells/μL, respectively. In patients with a BEC of < 300 cells/μL, tezepelumab reduced the AAER versus placebo by 31% (95% CI: − 4, 54) in spring, 37% (95% CI: 5, 58) in summer, 43% (95% CI: 20, 59) in fall and 55% (95% CI: 36, 68) in winter. In patients with a BEC of ≥ 300 cells/μL, tezepelumab reduced the AAER versus placebo by 62% (95% CI: 38, 77) in spring, 80% (95% CI: 67, 88) in summer, 66% (95% CI: 49, 77) in fall and 72% (95% CI: 57, 82) in winter.\n\nConclusions: Tezepelumab reduced exacerbations versus placebo across all seasons in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma with high or low baseline BECs, consistent with the overall NAVIGATOR population.\n\n3 Analysing phenotypes post exposure in allergic rhinitis (APPEAR): comparing phenotype distribution in the environmental exposure unit and nasal allergen challenge\n\nAbigail Davis1,2, Sophia Linton1,2,3, Jenny Thiele1,2, Lubnaa Hossenbaccus1,2,3, Hannah Botting2, Terry Walker2, Lisa Steacy2, Anne K. Ellis1,2,3\n\n1Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen’s University, Kingston, ON; 2Allergy Research Unit, Kingston Health Sciences Center—KGH Site, Kingston, ON, 3Department of Medicine, Queen’s University, Kingston, ON\n\nCorrespondence: Abigail Davis\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):3\n\nBackground: Previous studies described clinical phenotypes of allergic rhinitis (AR) based on total nasal symptom score (TNSS) as early-phase responders (EPRs), protracted early-phase responders (pEPRs), and dual responders (DRs) [1–3]. The purpose of APPEAR was to determine if these phenotypes could be validated using different allergens (birch, grass, ragweed, and house dust mite (HDM)), and different AR models (nasal allergen challenge (NAC), and Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU)).\n\nMethods: The APPEAR database consisted of 252 allergen exposures from NAC (n = 7) and EEU (n = 4) studies ranging from 2010 to 2021. Participants were phenotyped based on criteria described previously [1]. Statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 9.0.\n\nResults: The phenotypes described by Soliman & Ellis (2015) were present across all models and allergens. A novel low responder (LoR) phenotype was defined; participants experienced dampened symptomatic response (TNSS < 4). EPRs accounted for 124 (49.2%) participants followed by 77 (30.6%) pEPRs, 32 (12.7%) DRs, and 19 (7.5%) LoRs. Phenotype distribution between NAC versus EEU and allergens did not differ significantly. A strong negative correlation between TNSS and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) existed when grouping by phenotype (EPR, R2 = 0.82, p < 0.0001; pEPR, R2 = 0.78, p < 0.0001; DR, R2 = 0.78; LoR, R2 = 0.83, p < 0.0001).\n\nConclusions: AR phenotypes were reproducible in this larger sample size amongst all allergens and models used. We demonstrated that the same AR phenotypes can be identified using subjective TNSS and/or objective PNIF scoring methods. We established participants likely exhibit their intrinsic phenotypes regardless of the allergen exposure model or allergen used. Further research is warranted to investigate differences between perennial and seasonal allergens due to limited number of participants in HDM NAC. Future studies should be designed to directly compare the NAC versus EEU model in the same participant.\n\nReferences\n\nSoliman M, Ellis AK.

Li1, Harold Kim2,3, Stephen Betschel1\n\n1University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; 2Western University, London, ON; 3McMaster University, Hamilton, ON\n\nCorrespondence: Daniel H. Li\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):4\n\nBackground: Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is a standard approach used by allergists to treat patients with aeroallergen sensitization. However, administration errors in the delivery of SCIT can lead to serious systemic reactions. Quality improvement projects are important to try to improve the safety of this process and a key first step would be to identify where to implement these interventions. Given that there is no Canadian data which identifies the location of where SCIT is administered and the satisfaction of instructions provided to practitioners to administer SCIT, the first step was to determine this by survey methodology.\n\nMethods: A brief seven question survey was generated to examine different facets of SCIT administration including: the number of patients per allergist per year typically started on SCIT, where patients receive their SCIT injections, who performs the injections, satisfaction with the instructions provided to administer SCIT and the geographic distribution of respondents to ensure adequate representation across Canada. The survey was sent out via the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) April 2022 newsletter addressed to practicing allergists in Canada.\n\nResults: A total of 35 responses were received for our survey with diverse representation of each region across Canada. Most allergists initiate less than 100 patients per year on SCIT for aeroallergens. 75% of respondents have 50% to 75% of their patients on SCIT receive injections at their family physicians’ offices. For those that administer SCIT in their clinic, it is typically done by the clinic nurse 50% of the time. 80% of respondents were satisfied with the instructions provided by manufacturers with their SCIT.\n\nConclusions: Most patients receive their SCIT injections at their family physician’s office. Future surveys to identify key areas of quality improvement regarding the safety of SCIT administration will need to focus on this setting.\n\n5 Biomarkers associated with lung function decline and dupilumab response in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study\n\nIan D.

Currently, there are limited data on prognostic and predictive biomarkers for LFD. Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody, blocks interleukin 4/13 signaling, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation. In phase 3 QUEST (NCT02414854), dupilumab improved lung function and was generally well tolerated. Here we assessed baseline characteristics associated with rapid LFD in patients who received placebo during QUEST and the effect of dupilumab on LFD.\n\nMethods: Baseline characteristics were assessed in patients who received placebo during QUEST with rapid (> 2%/year) or no (< 1%/year) LFD (defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1 percent change). To evaluate the predictive/prognostic role of biomarkers, LFD was evaluated across different baseline blood eosinophil (eos) (< 150, ≥ 150, ≥ 300 cells/mL) and FeNO (< 25, ≥ 25, ≥ 50 ppb) thresholds across dupilumab and placebo populations.\n\nResults: Placebo patients with rapid LFD had higher baseline FeNO levels (36 ppb, n = 271) compared with patients without LFD (27 ppb, n = 49), but similar eos. Placebo patients with elevated baseline FeNO had greater lung function decline, irrespective of baseline eos: LFD in placebo patients with high baseline FeNO ≥ 25 and ≥ 50 combined with low eos < 150 was − 116 mL/year (n = 53) and − 102 mL/year (n = 20), respectively, compared to − 56 mL/year (n = 187) and -71 mL/year (n = 90) in patients with low FeNO < 25 and high eos ≥ 150 and EOS ≥ 300, respectively. LFD was attenuated in dupilumab-treated patients across populations, ranging from + 43 (n = 27) to + 4 (n = 99) in the high FeNO/low eos group and from − 17 (n = 363) to − 35 (n = 172) in the low FeNO/high eos group.\n\nConclusions: FeNO was elevated in patients with rapid LFD vs no LFD. High baseline FeNO levels were associated with greater LFD in placebo patients, which was attenuated in dupilumab-treated patients, suggesting FeNO may be prognostic for accelerated LFD and predictive of the treatment response to dupilumab.\n\n6 The effect of allergen sensitization status on dupilumab efficacy on lung function in VOYAGE pediatric patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe type 2 inflammatory asthma\n\nWanda Phipatanakul2,3, Nikolaos G.

Asthma can lead to severe and/or frequent exacerbations and abnormal lung function. Dupilumab (DPL), a fully human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for IL-4 and IL-13, key and central drivers of T2 inflammation in multiple diseases. In phase 3 VOYAGE (NCT02948959), add-on DPL vs placebo reduced severe asthma exacerbations and improved lung function in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled, moderate‑to‑severe T2 asthma. Dupilumab has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. To determine the effect of allergen sensitization, we conducted a post hoc analysis comparing efficacy of DPL vs placebo in non-, monoallergen- and multiallergen-sensitized VOYAGE patients with T2 asthma.\n\nMethods: Children were classified as non- (total serum IgE < 30 IU/mL or no perennial aeroallergen-specific IgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L at baseline), monoallergen- or multiallergen-sensitized (total baseline serum IgE ≥ 30 IU/mL in both, and 1 (mono-) or > 1 (multi-) aeroallergen-specific IgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L, respectively). The change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator (BD) percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (pre-BD FEV1pp) was compared.\n\nResults: DPL vs placebo significantly improved pre-BD FEV1pp in multiallergen-sensitized patients at Weeks 2 (LSMD [95% CI]: 5.3 percentage points [1.4–9.2]; P = 0.007), 24 (8.7 percentage points [4.1–13.3]; P < 0.001) and 52 (9.0 percentage points [4.0–14.1]; P < 0.001) and monoallergen-sensitized patients at Weeks 24 (LSMD [95% CI]: 8.1 percentage points [2.0–14.2]; P = 0.01) and 52 (10.1 percentage points [4.2–16.1]; P = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: DPL significantly improved lung function by Week 24 in monoallergen-sensitized patients and by Week 2 in multiallergen-sensitized patients and sustained these improvements through Week 52.\n\n7 Dupilumab improves exacerbations and lung function irrespective of prior asthma exacerbations: liberty asthma traverse\n\nAlberto Papi1, Mario Castro2, William W.

Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukins 4/13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases. In phase 3 QUEST (NCT02414854), add-on dupilumab significantly reduced exacerbations and improved lung function in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma. The TRAVERSE open-label extension study (NCT02134028) evaluated dupilumab long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy in patients from a previous dupilumab asthma study. Dupilumab safety during TRAVERSE was consistent with the known safety profile. This post hoc analysis examined the relationship between prior exacerbations and lung function in patients with type 2 asthma (blood eosinophils ≥ 150cells/μL or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb at baseline) from QUEST enrolled in TRAVERSE.\n\nMethods: Patients who received placebo or dupilumab in QUEST received dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks in TRAVERSE for up to 48/96 weeks (placebo/dupilumab and dupilumab/dupilumab groups). This analysis assessed annualized severe exacerbation rates (AER) and change from baseline in % predicted (pp) FEV1 in non-exacerbators (0 exacerbations) and exacerbators (≥ 1 exacerbations) during QUEST.\n\nResults: In the exacerbator group, dupilumab reduced AER vs placebo in QUEST (1.67 vs 2.59, respectively); AER was low in TRAVERSE (dupilumab/dupilumab 0.78, placebo/dupilumab 0.56). In the non-exacerbator group, dupilumab maintained low AER (dupilumab/dupilumab 0.11, placebo/dupilumab 0.17) in TRAVERSE. Mean ppFEV1 change at Week 2/48 was 9.08/9.88 and 11.28/13.58 for dupilumab/dupilumab and placebo/dupilumab in the exacerbator group and 13.86/14.52 and 11.59/12.88 for dupilumab/dupilumab and placebo/dupilumab in the non-exacerbator group. Improvements in lung function were maintained up to Week 96 of TRAVERSE.\n\nConclusions: Dupilumab reduced exacerbations and improved lung function in the placebo/dupilumab group and sustained improvements in the dupilumab/dupilumab group irrespective of prior exacerbation status.\n\nAllied health\n\n8 Asthma exacerbations after Covid-19 diagnosis among children receiving asthma education\n\nLenore Johnstone2, Nancy Ross2, Elinor Simons1,2,3\n\n1Section of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Pediatrics & Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB; 2The Children’s Allergy and Asthma Education Centre (CAAEC), Winnipeg, MB, 3Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB\n\nCorrespondence: Lenore Johnstone\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):8\n\nBackground: Asthma education has been a critical support to children and families managing new and pre-existing asthma during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Much remains unknown about the relationship between COVID-19 and asthma in children. Nurse educators at the Children’s Allergy and Asthma Education Centre (CAAEC) noticed asthma exacerbations requiring education 2–3 months after a child’s diagnosis of COVID-19, and hypothesized a possible association between COVID-19 diagnosis and presentation of asthma several months later. We are evaluating this question using records of CAAEC Asthma Education.\n\nMethods: We examined sequential COVID-19 positive children who received their first Asthma Education session with the CAAEC Nurse Educators from September 2021 to May 2022. We characterized the timing of their positive test for COVID-19, testing for other respiratory viruses, timing of asthma exacerbations, first or repeat presentation for asthma, and sociodemographic factors.\n\nResults: Among 23 sequential children who had a reported or documented positive test for COVID-19 at the time of their asthma education with a CAAEC Nurse Educator, the median age was 3 years (range 1–15 years); 13% of children were newly diagnosed with asthma at this presentation and 22% received their education during an inpatient admission to the Children’s Hospital. The median time between positive testing for COVID-19 and asthma exacerbation was 2 months (range 0–6 months). Evaluation of documented infection with other respiratory viruses and sociodemographic features is ongoing.\n\nConclusions: CAAEC Nurse Educators observed delayed asthma exacerbations several months after COVID-19 among children receiving asthma education for the first time. Characterization of this possible association will add to the body of knowledge regarding COVID-19 and asthma in children.\n\n9 Biweekly delivery of food allergy-friendly grocery kits decreases food costs and increases mental health within 3 months\n\nMichael A.

Protudjer\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):9\n\nBackground: Dietary avoidance is essential to prevent a potentially fatal allergic reaction. This near-constant need for dietary vigilance contributes to a social burden, including excess food costs and poorer mental health, for families who manage food allergy. Herein, we aimed to describe the financial and mental health impact of the first three months of a biweekly delivery of food allergy-friendly grocery kits to Winnipeg families managing milk allergy.\n\nMethods: As part of an interventional study, we enrolled 10 Winnipeg families whose children aged ≤ 6 years with allergist-diagnosed milk allergy, and who had a net annual household income of less than $70,001. Families were recruited via social media and word-of-mouth. The intervention consisted of a bi-weekly, contactless home delivery (or elsewhere, by mutual agreement) of food allergy-friendly grocery kits, valued at ~ $75/kit. At baseline and midpoint (3 months after the start of the intervention), families completed a series of questionnaires on food costs and mental health.\n\nResults: In total, the 10 participating families enrolled had an average monthly income of $3493.81. Surveys were completed exclusively by mothers. Children with milk allergy were age 3.0 ± 1.4 years, on average, and were ethnically diverse. In addition to milk, other food allergies were reported, most commonly to eggs, peanut and soy (n = 4 each). At baseline, monthly food costs averaged $736.36 ± $387.36, which decreased at midpoint to $673.75 ± 201.28, representing a non-statistically significant decrease of $62.61, or 8.5%. Regarding mental health from baseline to midpoint, generalized anxiety, depression and perceived stress did not change (all p ≥ 0.60). Mothers’ perceived life status, assessed using a visual analogue scale from 1–10, non-statistically significantly increased by 10.5% (baseline 6.82 ± 0.48; midpoint 8.0 ± 0.46).\n\nConclusions: Within three months, this unique intervention to support low-income families managing food allergy had reduced grocery costs, despite globally increasing food prices, and shows modest gains in perceived life status.\n\n10 Parent feedback regarding virtual asthma, food allergy, and eczema education sessions during the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nNancy Ross1, Shauna Filuk1, Jo-Anne St. Vincent1, Lenore Johnstone1, Caroline Doucette1, Elinor Simons1,2\n\n1The Children’s Allergy and Asthma Education Centre, Health Science Centre Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB; 2Section of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB\n\nCorrespondence: Nancy Ross\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):10\n\nBackground: The Children’s Allergy & Asthma Education Centre (CAAEC) has a long history of providing in-person education to parents and children with asthma, food allergy and eczema. In April 2020, CAAEC in-person programing was halted due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and education sessions with asthma and allergy nurse educators were offered virtually. CAAEC sought to evaluate feedback from parents regarding this virtual education.\n\nMethods: From June 2020 to June 2022, CAAEC received referrals from Emergency Departments, physicians’ offices, and self-referrals from the community to provide education to the families of children (0–17 years) with asthma, food allergy, and eczema. Parents were emailed a Microsoft Teams link for a 60-min session with a Certified Asthma Educator with experience in food allergy and eczema education. The nurse educators used PowerPoint slides and other visual aids to demonstrate correct inhaler, epinephrine auto-injector, and topical treatment techniques. Following the sessions, families were emailed electronic asthma, food allergy, and/or eczema resources and an anonymous SurveyMonkey® questionnaire link.\n\nResults: CAAEC received 217 questionnaire responses for one or more of asthma (46.1%), food allergy (59.9%), and eczema (38.7%) education for children ages 0–6 years (83.9%), 7–11 years (12.9%), and 12–17 years (3.2%). Most participants reported that they had all their questions answered (97%), learned a great deal of new information (72%), found the information useful (87%) and clear (95%), and better understood how to manage (92%), and felt more confident in the management of (90%) their child’s asthma, food allergy, and eczema.\n\nConclusions: Virtual sessions with a qualified allergy nurse educator were a positive experience for parents, met their education needs, and improved their knowledge of and confidence in managing their child’s allergic condition. Virtual education continues to be offered as part of CAAEC programing. Further research evaluating its cost and accessibility would be useful.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank all the parents and families who completed education sessions and provided their anonymous feedback.\n\n11 Evaluation of nurse-led eczema education sessions\n\nJo-Anne St-Vincent2, Shauna Filuk2, Shannon Deane1, Elinor Simons1\n\n1Section of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba,, Winnipeg, MB; 2The Children’s’ Allergy and Asthma Education Centre, Winnipeg, MB\n\nCorrespondence: Jo-Anne St-VIncent\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):11\n\nBackground: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with significant impairment of caregivers’ and children’s quality of life. Treatment for this inflammatory skin disease is not curative and long-term daily maintenance therapy is required to prevent chronic relapses. The CAAEC developed an education program to help caregivers gain knowledge and skills to manage AD. Our goal was to evaluate knowledge, behavior change, and caregiver satisfaction following an eczema education session.\n\nMethods: The standardized Eczema Education Program was developed and directed towards children and teens with moderate-to-severe AD, and their caregivers. The program included a knowledge portion, direct demonstration of the application of emollients and prescribed medications, and specialized interventions such as wet wraps. Prior to April 2020, education was offered in person. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, most subsequent education sessions were provided virtually via Microsoft Teams video conferencing. A caregiver satisfaction questionnaire was emailed to families via Survey Monkey™ post education.\n\nResults: Between June 2020 and June 2022, 23 participants responded to the questionnaire and reported:\n\nbetter ability to recognize early signs of eczema flare (87%),\n\nimproved understanding of management strategies (82%)\n\nincreased use of moisturizers (78%)\n\nfewer eczema flares (56%).\n\nthat they would contact the educator in the future for questions and support (87%).\n\nInformation identified as “very useful” included: physiology of eczema, information about bathing, application of moisturizers, use of topical medicated creams, tips for managing itch and the availability of the educator for ongoing support.\n\nConclusions: AD education programs are rare and providing education can help to improve management of children’s AD. Information, treatment demonstration, and support provided to families can improve adherence to and efficacy of AD treatment. Virtual sessions are an effective way to increase knowledge and positively affect behavior change for eczema management. Educators play an ongoing role in supporting and educating families with AD.\n\nFood allergy/anaphylaxis\n\n12 SMS messaging for patients on maintenance dosing for food allergen immunotherapy\n\nAlexandra V.

Cunada1,2, Rishma Chooniedass1,3, Lianne Soller1,2\n\n1BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, 2Division of Allergy & Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, 3School of Nursing, Faculty of Health and Social Development, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC\n\nCorrespondence: Alexandra V. Baaske\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):12\n\nBackground: BC Children’s Hospital Allergy Clinic provides longitudinal care to ensure patients are adherent and tolerating food allergy immunotherapy (FAIT). Scheduled follow-up visits occur during buildup and infrequently at maintenance, but between these appointments there is little communication between the patients and their healthcare team, relying on families to inform the clinic if there are issues. Increasing proactive communication with patients might reduce patient/caregiver anxiety and improve treatment adherence.\n\nMethods: Patients who reached maintenance for FAIT between April 2021 and May 2022 were invited to receive bi-weekly text messages asking, “How are you?” via a healthcare communication platform called WelTel. Participant responses were categorized into “Okay” and “Not okay”. Healthcare providers monitored WelTel daily and responded to messages. Families were invited to complete surveys evaluating adherence, satisfaction, anxiety, and caregiver burden related to food allergy at the beginning of maintenance, and every 6 months thereafter.\n\nResults: 136 families were approached for this study and 60 enrolled (44.1%). Of these, 57 parents and 3 adolescents received bi-weekly messages. The median age at start of FAIT was 6 years (IQR: 3.75, 11), and the most common foods treated were peanut (73.8%) and tree nuts (57.4%), with 53.3% on multiple foods. 46 families (76.7%) responded to at least one message. Two families withdrew from the study.\n\nThere were 271 total text conversations between families and healthcare providers, with 2.47 average messages per conversation. Most recognized responses were categorized as “Okay”. There was not enough data to analyze surveys quantitatively.\n\nConclusions: Automated text messaging might be a feasible way of increasing communication between patients and providers during maintenance of FAIT, where there is infrequent follow-up. This form of communication would not necessarily increase healthcare resource utilization. Future work will analyze effects on adherence and patient/caregiver outcomes such as anxiety, satisfaction, and caregiver burden.\n\n13 Comparing relative allergen content and specific IgE binding in protein extracts from crushed peanut versus bamba\n\nCasey G. Cohen1, Wei Zhao1, Diana K. Toscano1, Danbing Ke2, Duncan Lejtenyi2, Liane Beaudette2, Christine McCusker2, Bruce D. Mazer1,2, Moshe Ben-Shoshan2\n\n1Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC; 2Division of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Montreal Children’s Hospital, Montreal, QC\n\nCorrespondence: Casey G. Cohen\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):13\n\nBackground: Peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) could be achieved using crushed peanut or Bamba peanut snack (Osem, Israel). While the total peanut protein content in each food has been estimated, relative allergen content, extractability of proteins, and specific IgE binding have not been compared.\n\nMethods: Raw peanut, roasted peanut, and Bamba were each processed into protein extracts and total protein concentrations were equilibrated. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE to analyze total protein content. Antibodies specific for allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 8 were used for detection in Western blot analyses and for relative quantification via ELISA. A pooled serum of 4 patients with high specific IgE for peanut (median sIgE: 474 kU/l, median age: 15 years old, 75% male) was used to quantify relative specific IgE binding via ELISA.\n\nResults: Following the extraction of equal masses of food (Bamba or peanut) in equal volumes of buffer, Bamba samples yielded less extracted total protein when compared to raw (6.6-fold less) or roasted (3.3-fold less) samples. After adjusting total protein levels to equal concentrations, no significant differences in relative Ara h 1, Ara h 2, or Ara h 8 levels nor in specific IgE binding were found across all samples.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate similar allergen proportions in both Bamba and crushed peanut. However, less protein is extracted from equal masses of Bamba when compared to raw or roasted peanut, making Bamba a less potent and potentially safer substrate for peanut OIT.\n\n15 Factors associated with tolerating a single-blind placebo-controlled food challenge in the pediatric population\n\nLuca Delli Colli1, Pasquale Mulé1, Casey Cohen1, Benjamin Lawson1, Sofianne Gabrielli1, Bruce Mazer1, Christine McCusker1, Danbing Ke1, Duncan Lejtenyi1, Liane Beaudette1, Edmond S.

We aimed to assess factors associated with tolerating a single-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (SBPCFC) in the pediatric population.\n\nMethods: Patients were recruited from the Montreal Children’s Hospital, British Columbia Children’s Hospital, the Hospital for Sick Children, and Hôpital Sainte-Justine. Children above 6 years old with physician-diagnosed food allergy to milk, peanut, hazelnut, and/or egg, and a convincing history of reaction to the food were deemed eligible for recruitment [1]. Prior to beginning oral immunotherapy (OIT), all patients underwent a SBPCFC, as oral food challenges are the gold standard for diagnosis of food allergy. Factors associated with tolerating SBPCFC were assessed using a multivariate regression.\n\nResults: Over 9 years, a total of 168 children were recruited to participate in OIT. The median age was 10.5 [Interquartile range (IQR) 8.0, 14.0] and 54.8% were male. SBPCFC to milk, egg, peanut, and hazelnut were tolerated in 7 (6.80%), 1 (5.00%), 2 (6.25%), and 7 (53.8%) patients, respectively. Previous epinephrine use was reported in 38.3% of patients challenged to milk, 21.7% of patients challenged to egg, 34.4% of patients challenged to peanut, and 7.69% challenged to hazelnut.\n\nTolerating SBPCFC was more likely in patients challenged to hazelnut [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.41 (95% CI, 1.22, 1.64)], and in those with lower baseline sIgE levels [aOR 0.998 (95% CI, 0.997, 0.999)] while adjusting for sex, age, and baseline skin prick test measurement.\n\nConclusions: Compared to other food allergens, children with physician-diagnosed hazelnut allergy are more likely to tolerate the culprit allergen and hence, a food challenge is crucial prior to hazelnut OIT initiation.\n\nReferences\n\nBen-Shoshan M, Harrington DW, Soller L, Fragapane J, Joseph L, St Pierre Y, et al.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a modified sesame desensitization protocol in children in real-world clinical practice.\n\nMethods: Children with a history of sesame allergy and a positive skin prick test to sesame were recruited at the Montreal Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Clinic located in Montreal. After obtaining consent, an initial dose of sesame protein (3–25 mg) was introduced in the form of either tahini muffin or sesame seeds. Patients continued the same dose for 2–5 weeks at home, filled out a symptom diary, and returned to the clinic for updosing until maintenance was reached (2 teaspoons of hummus or 2 mL of tahini). A non-parametric test (Wilcoxon rank sum test) was used to compare the numbers of allergic reactions between tahini muffin and sesame seed protocols.\n\nResults: Between January 2021 and May 2022, 31 children (58.1% male; median age 2.5 years) were recruited. The majority of patients (77.4%) has eczema, 32.3% had asthma, and 81.3% had other food allergies (mainly peanut (61.5%), cashew (42.3%), and hazelnut (30.8%)). Oral desensitization was performed using one of two strategies according to the allergist: initial doses were either tahini muffin (69.2%) or sesame seeds (41.9%). To date, 7 patients (22.6%), after an average of 7.4 visits, reached the maintenance dose. Among the 8,515 total intake doses of sesame, 13 cases of non-anaphylactic allergic reactions and 1 case of anaphylaxis occurred. Over half (57.1%) of the reactions occurred at clinic during first visit or updosing. There were significantly more non-anaphylactic allergic reactions to sesame seeds than to tahini muffin (p-value = 0.016).\n\nConclusions: Modified sesame desensitization protocols can be safely used in children with sesame allergy.\n\n19 Safety and efficacy of early oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy in a primary care setting\n\nVictoria Landry1, Christopher Vaillancourt1,2,3, Kavish Chandra1,2,3, Rachel Lewis4, William Lewis4, Jacqueline Fraser2,3, Andrew Flewelling3, Paul Atkinson1,2,3\n\n1Dalhousie University, Saint John, NB; 2Saint John Regional Hospital Department of Emergency Medicine, Saint John, NB; 3Horizon Health Network, Saint John, NB, 4Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS\n\nCorrespondence: Victoria Landry\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):19\n\nBackground: Peanut allergy is a common food allergy that can cause life threatening anaphylaxis. Early oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy (P-EOIT) has been shown to be effective and safe in research and specialty clinic settings. New Brunswick has limited access to specialty allergy care, and provision of P-EOIT in primary care would make it available to more patients. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of successful P-EOIT completion in a primary care setting, along with rates of peanut-related allergic reactions leading to emergency department (ED) visits and use of epinephrine.\n\nMethods: This study included all patients starting P-EOIT under 36 months old at a primary care allergy clinic in New Brunswick, Canada from 2016 to 2020. Patients had a history of allergic reaction to peanut with a positive skin prick test or positive peanut specific IgE level (ps-IgE), or ps-IgE ≥ 5 kU/L with no history of peanut allergy. Patients had biweekly clinic visits with graded increase in peanut protein up to a maintenance dose of 300 mg peanut protein daily. A blinded retrospective chart review was conducted along with phone interviews regarding ED visits and epinephrine use. This study was approved by our Regional Research Ethics Board.\n\nResults: Of 69 consented patients, 67 (97.1%) were followed up successfully. All consented patients reached maintenance dose, over a median of 29 weeks, and 66 patients (95.7%) were still regularly consuming peanut protein after one year of maintenance. One patient had a peanut ingestion-related ED visit requiring epinephrine during the escalation phase of peanut protein dose (1.5%; 95% CI 0.0 to 8.0%). During the first year of maintenance phase, no patients had peanut ingestion-related ED visits or required epinephrine.\n\nConclusions: P-EOIT in a primary care setting appears to be safe and effective with the majority of patients reaching the maintenance phase.\n\n20 The effectiveness of oral immunotherapy on food allergy related quality of life\n\nBenjamin J.

Lawson\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):20\n\nBackground: Food allergies have become increasingly common in North America, and place many patients at risk of severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. A lower health-related quality of life may be experienced by families with food-allergic children as a result of anxiety related to the possibility of accidental exposure and psychosocial consequences. We seek to assess the effect of successful Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) on parent-reported quality of life given a growing body of evidence that shows it can greatly reduce the risks associated with food allergies.\n\nMethods: Children with a convincing history of allergy diagnosed via a positive skin prick test to either sesame, peanut, or walnut were recruited at the Montreal Children’s Hospital and The Children’s Clinic located in Montreal. Parents of participants were assessed using a Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Parent Form (FAQLQ-PF) at baseline prior to desensitization, and again after participants had reached maintenance (Either 2 teaspoons of hummus, ¼ teaspoons of peanut butter, or 1/8 walnut, dependent on allergen). A non-parametric test was conducted to detect differences in the scores at baseline and at follow-up.\n\nResults: 14 Children (57% female, median age = 1.8 years) were included in the study. Participants had undergone desensitization for peanut (79%), sesame (14%) and walnut (7%). No significant difference between total FAQLQ-PF scores at baseline and at follow up were found (p = 0.391). Similarly, no significant differences were found in the scores of the Food Anxiety (p = 0.906), Emotional Impact (p = 0.149), and Social/Dietary Restriction (p = 0.972) subscales. A significant difference was found between the baseline and follow-up scores of the subscale assessing parental concern regarding accidental exposure (p = 0.037), but not in the subscale assessing the child’s level of concern regarding accidental exposure (p = 0.447).\n\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that parental concern is significantly affected by pediatric OIT, but global Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) is not.\n\n22 Long-term adherence and risk of allergic reactions in children who attained milk oral immunotherapy maintenance\n\nPasquale Mulé1, Bruce Mazer1, Danbing Ke1, Lydia Zhang1, Duncan Lejtenyi1, Chiara Lucchesi1, Liane Beaudette1, Luca Delli Colli1, Julia Upton2, Eyal Grunebaum2, Ciriaco Piccirillo3, Edmond S.

We aimed to assess long-term adherence and the risk of allergic reaction after attaining OIT maintenance.\n\nMethods: Thirty-six children who reached their OIT maintenance dose of 200 ml milk were followed at the Montreal Children’s Hospital. Patients were queried annually on milk consumption and allergic reactions. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the risk of reaction and adherence to OIT.\n\nResults: Patient ages ranged from 8 to 21 years old (median 15, 50% male). Median follow-up time after beginning maintenance was 2.5 years (range 0.4—5.4 years). Eighteen patients (50%) adhered to OIT protocol (≥ 200 ml milk, ≥ 3 times per week), 3 patients (8%) partially adhered (< 200 ml milk or baked goods, ≥ 3 times per week), 6 patients (17%) did not adhere (dairy products 1–2 times per week), and 9 patients (25%) stopped ingesting dairy products.\n\nReactions occurred in 13 patients (36%). 3/13 (23%) reactions occurred following maintenance dose ingestion and 10/13 (77%) reactions occurred following dietary exposure (cheese and baked goods). Exercise was the only cofactor (38% of reactions). Reactions occurred in 2/18 (11%) adherent patients, in which one was anaphylaxis. Reactions occurred in 11/18 (61%) patients who deviated from protocol, 8 of which were anaphylaxis. No association was observed between risk of reaction and sex (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, 95% CI [0.35–3.16]), or age (HR = 1.06, 95% CI [0.90–1.24]). Adherent patients had lower risk of reaction (HR = 0.41, 95% CI [0.09–1.88]), although this effect was not statistically significant.\n\nConclusions: Half of our cohort adhered to OIT protocol, and reactions occurred in approximately a third of patients. While adherent patients had a lower risk of reaction, the small sample size precluded definitive conclusions.\n\n23 In vitro sublingual protein penetration rates of peanut sublingual immunotherapy preparations\n\nBrock A. Williams, Yigong Guo, Lianne Soller, Edmond S. Chan, Anubhav Pratap-Singh\n\nThe University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC\n\nCorrespondence: Brock A. Williams\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):23\n\nBackground: Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a safe therapy which can be used in the treatment of peanut allergy. Studies demonstrating peanut SLIT efficacy have relied on glycerinated food extracts for the administration of food allergens. These extracts are costly, not licensed for SLIT, and largely unavailable for patient use at home, thus limiting the accessibility of this treatment. Objective: To determine the in vitro sublingual protein penetration rates of commercially available peanut powder, in comparison with glycerinated peanut extract (the current standard in research).\n\nMethods: Defatted peanut powder (~ 6 g protein per 15 g serving) and glycerinated peanut extract (1:20 w/v fully dissolved in 0.2% phenol and 50% glycerinated saline) were tested for in vitro sublingual protein penetration rates using human buccal carcinoma cell lines (TR 146). To determine protein penetration rates, samples from the basolateral chamber of the TR 146 cell line were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after inoculation with 37 ◦C incubation. The permeated amount of protein from extract was analyzed by Bradford protein assay.\n\nResults: Glycerinated peanut extract showed higher protein penetration rates at 0.5 h (36.7 ± 1.2% vs. 30.3 ± 1.5%), 1 h (82.2 ± 2.0% vs. 72.1 ± 1.5%) and 2 h (89.8 ± 1.5% vs. 80.0 ± 2.0%) of incubation compared with peanut powder (p < 0.05), but not after 4 h (95.5 ± 1.5% vs. 96.1 ± 1.5%, respectively) (p > 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Glycerinated peanut extracts had higher sublingual penetration rates from 0.5–2 h of incubation than peanut powder. Further work using in vitro and in vivo methods to establish the potential use of widely accessible peanut powder as a therapeutic in peanut SLIT is warranted.\n\n25 Using the Canadian egg ladder in canadian children with food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) to egg\n\nLinlei Ye1, Victoria E. Cook2, Stephanie C. Erdle2\n\n1Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, 2Division of Allergy and Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC\n\nCorrespondence: Linlei Ye\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):25\n\nBackground: Current management of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) involves strict avoidance of the offending food for 12–18 months, followed by oral food challenge under physician supervision. Prolonged avoidance may increase the risk of IgE-mediated allergy, particularly in atopic patients. Food ladders have shown success in promoting accelerated tolerance in patients with IgE-mediated allergy. Our case series evaluated the safety of use of the Canadian Egg Ladder in patients with FPIES to egg.\n\nMethods: From May 2020 to November 2021, patients with mild FPIES to egg, defined as no history of lethargy or intravenous fluid administration, were started on the Canadian Egg Ladder. Patients were followed every 3—6 months, at which time information was collected regarding progression up the ladder, symptoms while on treatment, and interventions required. Treating allergists completed a survey to capture baseline demographic characteristics and prior tolerance to egg. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using MS Excel.\n\nResults: 21 patients with mild FPIES were started on the Canadian Egg Ladder. Median age at initiation of the ladder was 10 months (IQR, 9–11). Seventeen (80.9%) patients successfully completed the ladder, tolerating a serving size amount of cooked egg, with a median duration of 7 months (IQR, 4–9). Four (19.0%) patients experienced symptoms while undergoing treatment including vomiting (9.5%), pallor (9.5%), belching (4.8%), and irritability (4.8%). There were no reports of lethargy. No patients required health care presentation or intravenous fluid administration. No patients discontinued the ladder.\n\nConclusions: The Canadian Egg Ladder can safely guide the gradual advancement of egg-containing foods in patients with mild FPIES to egg, without needing prolonged avoidance and resource intensive oral food challenges. Promoting consistent consumption of egg may reduce the risk of developing IgE-mediated egg allergy. Larger scale prospective studies are planned to confirm these promising results.\n\nImmunology\n\n26 Cross-sectional study of patients with secondary immunodeficiency: Ontario Immunoglobulin Treatment (ONIT) case registry data\n\nArmin Abadeh1, Stephen Betschel1, Susan Waserman2, Donald W. Cameron3, Juthaporn Cowan3\n\n1University of Toronto, Department of Medicine, Toronto, ON; 2McMaster University, Department of Medicine, Hamilton, ON, 3. University of Ottawa, Department of Medicine, Ottawa, ON\n\nCorrespondence: Armin Abadeh\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):26\n\nBackground: Despite the increasing number of cases of secondary immunodeficiency and immunoglobulin utilization, there is a paucity of data in the literature on clinical outcomes and patient-reported health-related QoL measures in this population. This is the first report from the Ontario Immunoglobulin Treatment (ONIT) registry, a multicentre program based at Ottawa, Hamilton and Toronto, on patients with secondary immunodeficiency.\n\nMethods: Cross-sectional study of patients with secondary immunodeficiency enrolled in the ONIT Case Registry from June 2020 to March 2022 was completed. Demographics, comorbidities, indication for immunoglobulin treatment, clinical data infections, and patient-reported quality of life parameters were collected and analyzed.\n\nResults: A total of 108 patients (45 male; 63 female; average age of 66) with secondary immunodeficiency as the main indication for IG treatment were identified. Of these patients, 93 were on SCIG (of whom 19 were previously on IVIG) and 15 were on IVIG. The most common indication was CLL (N = 33), followed by lymphoma (N = 20) and transplant (N = 11). 92% of patients were followed by one or more subspecialists, with the most common being hematology/oncology (62%). SCIG average dosage was 0.57 ± 0.30 g/kg/4 weeks and IVIG average dosage was 0.49 ± 0.15 g/kg/4 weeks. IG treatment reduced average annual number of infections by 83% (4.3 vs. 0.7) and the number of emergency department visits by 85% (1.3 vs 0.2). 91.7% of the patients who switched from IVIG to SCIG reported their health as same or better compared to before the switch. Overall, 80.5% of patients reported their health as better compared to before they started immunoglobulin treatment.\n\nConclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest cross-sectional descriptive study reported on patients with secondary immunodeficiency receiving IG treatment in Canada. IG treatment has improved clinical and quality of life reported outcomes. The data reported here can be invaluable in improving care coordination and management of these complex patients.\n\n27 Validating the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation for the MILLIPLEX® SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin-A,G,M magnetic bead based immunoassays\n\nAlyssa G.

Burrows\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):27\n\nBackground: Globally, severe-acute-coronavirus disease-2(SARS-CoV-2) has caused over 500 million infections and over 6 million deaths, respectively [1]. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is crucial to determining population immunity.\n\nMethods: Serum samples were collected prospectively from Queen’s University Faculty of Health Sciences(FHS) students and recovered community members to determine asymptomatic carriage and seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2. A blank, recovered, vaccinated and negative control samples were selected and run in duplicate with the SARS-CoV-2 immune-globulin(Ig)-A,M,G MILLIPLEX®(MilliporeSigma) Luminex®XMap® magnetic bead-based immunoassays to measure antibodies to four SARS-CoV-2 proteins(spike-1(S1), spike-2(S2), nucleocapsid(N), receptor-binding-domain(RBD)) and four control beads(Control Bead(CB)-1, CB2, CB3, Negative Control Bead). With the goal of validating the intra- and inter-assay %CV across a larger sample size of assays and comparing them to the manufacturer’s provided intra- and inter-assay %CV of < 15% and < 20%, respectively. The assays were read with Bio-Plex Manager™ Software6.2 and calculations were done with Excel(2016).\n\nResults: Between May 2020-June 2021, 1,229 and 16 serum samples were collected from 457 FHS participants and 11 recovered community participants, respectively. The mean intra-assay %CV for the SARS-CoV-2 proteins ranged from 5.50–7.14, 4.49–5.87, and 4.67–6.67 for IgA(n = 14), IgM(n = 14), IgG(n = 15), respectively. The mean intra-assay %CV for the four control beads ranged from 2.83–9.67, 3.24–5.73, and 1.27–10.23 for IgA(n = 14), IgM(n = 14), IgG(n = 15), respectively. The mean inter-assay %CV for the SARS-CoV-2 proteins ranged from 8.69–11.02, 9.10–11.20, 7.52–11.71 for IgA(n = 14), IgM(n = 14), IgG(n = 15), respectively after the removal of outliers (S1 for negative control sample for IgA and IgG and RBD for blank well for IgG).\n\nConclusions: The mean intra-assay %CV for all targets were < 10% except for IgG for CB3. The mean inter-assay %CV were < 12% after the removal of the aforementioned outliers. The intra- and inter-assay %CV were lower than the manufacturer’s reported < 15% and < 20%.\n\nCOVID-19 Map [Internet]. Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. [cited 2022 May 5].

Blueprint Genetics, Espoo, Finland\n\nCorrespondence: Christine Davies\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):28\n\nBackground: Identifying the genetic etiology of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) significantly impacts management but can be challenging if the primary immunodeficiency (PID) overlaps with hematological disorders like cytopenia and bone marrow failure. A Comprehensive Immune & Cytopenia (CIC) next-generation sequencing panel was developed to address this need. We compared the results of this panel to those from a PID panel during the same period.\n\nMethods: A retrospective review of deidentified results from 1,243 consecutive patients tested with the CIC (642 genes) or the PID (298 genes) panel was performed. Test results, patient age, clinical information and panel used were extracted. The PID and the CIC panels contain 7 and 313 unique genes respectively and share 329 genes in common. Target regions included all coding exons (unless otherwise indicated), 20 base pairs at intron–exon boundaries, and select noncoding variants. Copy number variants (CNVs) were analyzed bioinformatically with a proprietary pipeline to detect exon-level CNVs. Variant interpretation was performed using a modification of the ACMG guidelines.\n\nResults: The BTK (9%) and STAT3 (6%) genes made up most diagnoses for the cohort tested with the PID panel. For the CIC panel, the gene responsible for the most diagnoses was XIAP (9%). CNVs were responsible for the diagnosis in 15% of patients while noncoding variants were responsible for the diagnosis in 7% of patients. Variants in difficult-to-sequence genes accounted for 10% of the diagnoses.\n\nConclusions: We demonstrate the clinical utility of genetic testing for IEI and its hematologic phenocopies. While both panels had a similar yield, the most frequent diagnostic genes are panel specific. CNVs, noncoding variants, and difficult-to-sequence genes are important contributors to the diagnostic potential highlighting the value of panels with high-resolution CNV capabilities, methods to resolve challenging regions, and the inclusion of clinically relevant noncoding variants for this patient population.\n\n29 Dupilumab reduces biomarkers of type 2 inflammation in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in parts a and c of a three-part, phase 3 lLIBERTY EoE TREET study\n\nMarc Rothenberg2, Ikuo Hirano3, Evan S.

Part A of 3-part, phase 3 LIBERTY-EoE-TREET (NCT03633617) demonstrated the efficacy and safety of weekly dupilumab 300 mg vs placebo in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) for 24 weeks. For patients completing Part A, Part C was a 28-week extended active treatment period to evaluate efficacy and safety of weekly dupilumab 300 mg for 52 weeks. This analysis assessed dupilumab effect on biomarkers of type 2 inflammation in Part C.\n\nMethods: Of 81 patients (42 dupilumab; 39 placebo) enrolled in Part A, 77 continued to dupilumab in Part C (40 dupilumab [dupilumab/dupilumab]; 37 placebo [placebo/dupilumab]). Median changes from Part A baseline (∆BL) in serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), plasma eotaxin-3, and serum total IgE were assessed.\n\nResults: Part A BL biomarker levels were similar across treatment groups. In Part A, at Week 24, median ∆BL(Q1,Q3) for dupilumab vs placebo in TARC was -115.5 pg/mL(− 204.0, − 60.0) vs -35.0 pg/mL(− 67.0,32.0) (Part A BL values[Q1,Q3]: 322.0 pg/mL[232.0,430.0] vs 293.0 pg/mL[226.0,418.0]); eotaxin-3 was -88.6 pg/mL(− 212.0,-47.0) vs − 9.0 pg/mL(− 148.0,53.0) (Part A BL values[Q1,Q3]: 217.5 pg/mL [139.0,330.0] vs 217.0 pg/mL[163.0,448.0]); and total IgE was -45.7kU/L(− 198.0, − 23.7) vs − 8.6kU/L(− 72.0,4.7) (Part A BL values[Q1,Q3]: 110.0kU/L[51.1,463.0] vs 100.0kU/L[46.7,294.0]) (all nominal P < 0.0001). In Part C, at Week 52, median ∆BL(Q1,Q3) for dupilumab/dupilumab and placebo/dupilumab in TARC was -98.0 pg/mL(-182.0,-37.0) and − 122.0 pg/mL(− 194.0, − 28.0); eotaxin-3 was − 118.0 pg/mL(− 225.3, − 63.8) and − 160.9 pg/mL(− 367.0, − 104.6); and total IgE was − 62.9kU/L(− 410.0,-35.4) and − 57.6kU/L(− 178.8, − 28.7). Dupilumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in Part C; TEAEs occurring ≥ 10% in dupilumab/dupilumab and placebo/dupilumab were injection-site reactions (10.0% and 21.6%) and injection-site erythema (10.0% and 13.5%).\n\nConclusions: Dupilumab suppressed TARC, eotaxin-3, and total IgE in EoE patients over 52 weeks, consistent with prior assessment in EoE and other type 2 inflammatory diseases. Placebo/dupilumab patients in Part C showed similar treatment effects to dupilumab patients in Part A.\n\n30 Long term natural history of Good’s Syndrome\n\nVanessa Polito, Aunonna Kabir, Christos Tsoukas\n\nMcGill University, Montreal, QC\n\nCorrespondence: Vanessa Polito\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):30\n\nBackground: Good’s syndrome is a rare adult-onset combined immune deficiency, characterized by thymoma and hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients present late in disease, following recurrent sinopulmonary infections, opportunistic infections, cytopenias, absent B cells and T-cell abnormalities. Documentation of the long term clinical and laboratory evolution is lacking due to the rarity of the disease and the relative lack of cohort studies.\n\nMethods: We report a longitudinal, single site, case series of seven patients from 1980 to present. Demographics, clinical presentation including age at key events including: hypogammaglobulinemia, immunoglobulin replacement, and death were collected along with the type and frequency of infections, and thymoma pathology. Clinical and laboratory evolution over time, including quantitative immunoglobulins, complete blood count, B and T cell numbers and function were documented.\n\nResults: Mean age at thymoma diagnosis was 51, of hypogammaglobulinemia was 50, and of immunoglobulin replacement was 58.5. In 5/7 patients, thymoma pathology was WHO type AB. All patients had absent B cells, and all but one patient were severely hypogammaglobulinemic. All but one patient developed recurrent sinopulmonary infections prior to the thymoma. All demonstrated in vitro and in vivo T cell dysfunction, on either lymphocyte proliferation testing or delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing. Clinical history was notable for opportunistic and chronic bacterial infections. Cytopenias appeared to emerge with advanced disease in 4/7 patients. Two patients are deceased: one patient from progressive multifocal encephalopathy due to polyoma virus at age 69, another with systemic cytomegalovirus and subsequent septic shock from pseudomonas pneumonia at age 71.\n\nConclusions: During the last 4 decades, we systematically documented the natural history of seven patients with Good’s syndrome. Clinical and laboratory evolution of these patients provides crucial longitudinal information about the disease progression and will support efforts to better characterize this rare disease.\n\n32 Stimulation of human mucosal B cells with germinal center cytokines results in the generation of Il-10 + regulatory plasmablasts\n\nNicholas Vonniessen, Eisha Ahmed, Jana Abi Rafeh, Bruce Mazer\n\nMeakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University, Montreal, QC\n\nCorrespondence: Nicholas Vonniessen\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):32\n\nBackground: The ability of B cells to regulate immunity, beyond antibody production, resulted in the classification of a novel subset of B-cells, called regulatory B-cells (Breg). The identification of this subset was initially based on their ability to attenuate inflammation through the production of IL-10. Considering their critical role in promoting peripheral tolerance and suppressing the development of type II inflammatory responses that drive allergic disease, we sought to evaluate whether Th2 GC conditions were capable of inducing the expansion of IL-10 + Breg using human mucosal B cells.\n\nMethods: Human tonsillar B cells were cultured for 2 to 5 days at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 12-well plates. Cells were stimulated with or without anti-CD40 (1ug/mL, purified from the G28.5 cell line), IL-4 (100U/mL), IL-21 (50 ng/mL) or CpG ODN 2006 (5ug/mL). For intracellular cytokine detection by flow cytometry, 50 ng/ml PMA, 1ug/ml ionomycin and 2uM GolgiStop were added for the last 5 h of culture. IL-10 secretion was assessed by ELISA and ELISpot.\n\nResults: Compared to CpG + anti-CD40, a well-cited method for the induction of human regulatory B cells, stimulation with anti-CD40 + IL-4 + IL-21 resulted in a robust induction of CD19 + IL-10 + Breg. Class-switched plasmablasts defined the primary Breg subset within the CD19 + IL-10 + CD27 + IgD- population in response to both CpG + anti-CD40 and anti-CD40 + IL-4 + IL-21 on Day 2; however, this population persisted until Day 5 only in response to stimulation with anti-CD40 + IL-4 + IL-21.\n\nConclusions: Results identified anti-CD40 + IL-4 + IL-21 as a novel highly effective condition for the induction of human regulatory B cells and suggests a role for these cells in the regulation of Th2 GC responses. The induction and maintenance of regulatory plasmablasts in response to GC cytokines raises questions regarding the role of these cells in the suppression of IgE-mediated inflammation and whether a deficiency in this response may contribute to the pathophysiology that characterizes allergic disease.\n\nOther allergy/immunology\n\n33 Vaccine confidence amongst those living with allergy during the Covid pandemic (ACCORD): a scoping review\n\nAyel Luis R.

Batac\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):33\n\nBackground: Despite the clear evidence on vaccine safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, misinformation remains rampant across online platforms. In addition to the dissemination of misinformation online, documented reports of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have contributed to decreased vaccine confidence among the general population. We aimed to conduct a living scoping review on peer-reviewed and grey literature on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and allergic reactions.\n\nMethods: Guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework for methodological reviews, we searched four scientific databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL) using a search strategy developed by content and methodological experts. No restrictions were applied on the type of COVID-19 vaccine, country of study, and language of publication. Grey literature searches were restricted to 10 languages. The study population included patients of all ages. The search was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews.\n\nResults: Of the 1114 unique records retrieved from our comprehensive search, a total of 54 (4.8%) studies were included. Findings from the current review provide evidence of low prevalence rates of allergic reactions in the general population. Thirteen of the 54 (24%) included studies highlighted vaccine hesitancy due to possibility of an allergic reaction. Additionally, the present review also highlights research on incidents/details of vaccine-related allergic reactions and risk assessment studies of possible allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among individuals living with allergy and those with no previous known allergic disease history, is influenced by the fear of an allergic reaction.\n\nConclusions: Despite the low prevalence rates of serious vaccine-related adverse reactions, fear of allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine remain to be one of the leading causes of vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, it is imperative to dispel misinformation and ensure that the appropriate information is promoted correctly and widely to reduce vaccine hesitancy.\n\n35 Improving access to pediatric allergy care through use of mixed virtual and in-person outreach clinics in northern British Columbia\n\nSean Duke2, Alanna Escott3, Zaneta Lim2, Bahar Torabi2, Stephanie C. Erdle2, Victoria E. Cook1,3\n\n1University of British Columbia, Victoria, BC, 2University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, 3Community Allergy Clinic, Victoria, BC\n\nCorrespondence: Sean Duke\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):35\n\nBackground: Patients living in remote and rural regions of British Columbia (BC) have limited access to pediatric allergy care, including important diagnostic and treatment modalities. Patients have historically travelled to BC Children’s Hospital in Vancouver, BC, to be seen by a pediatric allergist, which is a significant economic burden to families. Outreach clinics, where specialists visit rural communities, and virtual allergy visits, more widely used in the era of COVID-19, are two methods that can improve access to care. Here we describe our experience with the first 1.5 years of a mixed virtual and in-person allergy outreach clinic in Terrace, British Columbia.\n\nMethods: In January 2021, we began accepting referrals for patients ages 0–17 years with allergic concerns residing in Northern, BC. Patients were triaged and assigned either an initial virtual or in-person visit, depending on the reason for referral. Follow-up in-person visits were conducted if needed. Two in-person outreach clinics (5 full clinic days) in Terrace, BC, were conducted between March 2021 and April 2022.\n\nResults: From January 2021 to April 2022, 55 patients were referred for assessment. Reasons for referral were food allergy (65%), asthma/allergic rhinitis (13%), eczema (7%), drug allergy (7%), hives (5%), and venom allergy (2%). Thirty-eight patients were assigned to an initial virtual visit; of these, 26 required additional visits (1 virtual visit, 27 in person visits). During in-person clinics, we completed a total of 15 oral food challenges, and 4 drug allergy assessments, 3 of which underwent challenges. Seven patients were started on oral immunotherapy (initial doses in outreach clinics, subsequent dose escalations observed virtually).\n\nConclusions: The use of a mixed virtual and in-person outreach clinic model facilitated timely access to pediatric allergy care, including diagnostic and treatment interventions that require in-person management, without the need for patient travel.\n\n36 An investigation of the relationships between infantile atopic dermatitis and perinatal anxiety\n\nMichael A.

Golding\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):36\n\nBackground: Caring for a child with atopic dermatitis (AD) can impose a considerable burden on parents through its impact on infant sleep and its time consuming treatments. While some research has linked this burden to greater levels of psychosocial dysfunction, few studies have investigated the impact of the condition on perinatal anxiety. Consequently, the current study explored whether levels of perinatal anxiety differ between mothers of infants with AD and those without.\n\nMethods: The current study recruited mothers with an infant, 18 months or younger, from allergy and dermatology clinics, to complete several self-report measures of physical and psychosocial health. As part of this package, participants completed the Patient-Oriented Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD), a measure of AD severity. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess whether mothers with a child with AD reported greater levels of perinatal anxiety relative to the mothers of children without the condition.\n\nResults: The final sample was comprised of 33 mothers with an infant with AD and 65 mothers without. The participants had an average age of approximately 31 years (SD = 4.32), while the average infant age was roughly eight months old (SD = 4.25). Mothers with an infant with AD did not significantly differ from controls in their level of perinatal anxiety; however, AD severity was found to predict higher total perinatal anxiety scores (b = 0.34; 95%CI = 0.02; 0.67) as well as greater scores on the subscales related to worry and specific fears (b = 0.16; 95%CI = 0.04; 0.29) and perfectionism, control, and trauma (b = 0.10; 95%CI = 0.002; 0.20).\n\nConclusions: While differences in anxiety between cases and controls failed to reach statistical significance, findings suggest that anxiety does increase with the severity of a child’s AD. More research is needed to determine whether mothers of children with more severe cases of atopic dermatitis are at increased risk of problematic anxiety during the postpartum period.\n\n37 Symptoms reported in environmental exposure chamber and symptoms reported during natural season are highly correlated in subjects who reported at least 3 h outdoors during the grass pollen season\n\nAnne M. Salapatek, Yasmeen Goyal, Patricia Couroux\n\nCliantha Research, Mississauga, ON\n\nCorrespondence: Yasmeen Goyal\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):37\n\nBackground: Environmental exposure chambers (EECs) are valuable clinical tools. They provide a controlled yet naturalistic environment to study allergen-induced symptoms. The current study compared the symptoms reported in EEC to those symptoms in natural pollen season.\n\nMethods: This study consisted of 7 scheduled visits to the study site, including a medical screening visit; Four EEC visits in which Total Symptom Score (TSS (24) = Total Nasal Symptom Score (12,TNSS) + Total Non-Nasal Symptom Score (12,TNNSS)) were collected over 3 h with grass pollen exposure (3500 ± 500 pollen grains/m3); and 2 site visits flanking an at-home assessment of TSS during peak grass season. Subjects also reported the time spent outdoors (6 days). Symptoms were reported on the same electronic patient data acquisition device. Average TSS collected over the EEC sessions and peak grass allergy season (2015) by same subjects were compared. Pearson correlation analyses were performed.\n\nResults: The average TSS for subjects in the EEC and during a 6-day period in the field was less variable in EEC than in field. Subjects who reported spending > 3 h outdoors had higher average TSS than subjects < 3 h. A low correlation (non-significant) was observed between reported TSS in the EEC and TSS for subjects who spent < 3 h outdoors (r = 0.2131). There was a strong and highly significant correlation between TSS in the EEC and TSS for subjects spending > 3 h outdoors (r = 0.51, p < 0.0001).\n\nConclusions: There is a high correlation between each subject’s response in the EEC and their response in the Field for those who reported at least 3 h outdoors. Conversely, those subjects who spent less time outdoors did not develop adequate symptoms and did not correlate with their response in the EEC. This further supports the use of the EEC to ensure patients are included in allergy trials who have an adequate level of symptoms to test allergy treatments.\n\n38 Reduction of anosmia in patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) treated with dupilumab\n\nAndrew P.

Lane\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):38\n\nBackground: Dupilumab improved sense of smell in patients with CRSwNP versus placebo in the SINUS-24/-52 (NCT02912468/NCT02898454) studies. We report a post hoc analysis of olfactory and clinical outcomes in patients from the SINUS studies.\n\nMethods: Patients with baseline smell impairment (loss of smell score ≥ 1 [at least “mild”] and University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT, 0–40] ≤ 34/ ≤ 33 [women/men] and at least “very mild problem” in the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22] smell/taste item) who received dupilumab 300 mg or placebo q2w were analyzed. Change from baseline in nasal polyp score (NPS, 0–8)/nasal congestion (NC, 0–3)/SNOT-22 (0–110) was reported for patients achieving normosmia (UPSIT > 34/ > 33 [women/men]) and those reporting anosmia (UPSIT 0–18) at Week 24 (pooled SINUS-24/-52) and 52 (SINUS-52).\n\nResults: Most patients had anosmia at baseline (dupilumab n = 322/398 [81%]/placebo n = 213/267 [80%]); 6% in each group had mild hyposmia (UPSIT ≥ 31/30- ≤ 34/33 [women/men]). Among patients with baseline anosmia, the proportions achieving normosmia or mild hyposmia with dupilumab/placebo were 29%/0.5% at Week 24 and 29%/0% at Week 52; 94% of patients remained anosmic at Week 52 with placebo versus 33% with dupilumab. In patients with baseline smell impairment, mean [SD] changes from baseline in NPS/NC/SNOT-22 with dupilumab were greater in patients achieving normosmia than those reporting anosmia at Week 24 (NPS: − 2.56 [1.80] versus − 1.22 [1.65]; NC: − 1.44 [0.70] versus − 1.01 [0.95]; SNOT-22: − 33.96 [20.03] versus − 20.56 [20.50]) and Week 52 (NPS: -3.57 [1.77] versus − 1.16 [1.79]; NC: − 1.68 [0.59] versus − 0.82 [0.84]; SNOT-22: − 29.73 [11.44] versus − 16.79 [19.15]).\n\nConclusions: Most patients with severe CRSwNP had anosmia, of whom approximately one-third treated with dupilumab improved to normosmia/mild hyposmia at Week 24 and 52, while almost all treated with placebo remained anosmic.

Merrill\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):40\n\nBackground: COVID-19 vaccines are critical to the pandemic response. As such, vaccine hesitancy poses a threat to global health. Despite the rarity of allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccines, people with allergies may still hold reservations. We aimed to describe the perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines amongst individuals managing allergy.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews regarding COVID-19 vaccines were conducted with two categories of participants (all eligible for vaccination): (1) parents of children with allergies, (2) adults with allergies. Participants were recruited via social media. Transcripts were analysed independently by two researchers utilizing thematic analysis.\n\nResults: At this time, eight interviews have been conducted (n = 5 parents of children with allergies; n = 3 adults with allergies). All participants (and eligible children of participants) have been vaccinated, with a range of allergies, including food and drug allergies. Thus far, three major themes have been identified: (1) limited resources available regarding allergies and COVID-19 vaccines caused distrust, and ultimately delay, in vaccination, (2) specific allergic disease history not reflected in clinical trials or published literature increased vaccine hesitancy, and (3) allergists’ advice enhanced confidence in obtaining the vaccine. Many participants cited medical professionals, government, and researchers as reputable sources to obtain information surrounding vaccines, despite significant misinformation in the media. Allergy community groups, such as Facebook groups for parents with food allergies, served as social supports and influenced the decision making of others in similar positions.\n\nConclusions: Despite evidence of the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for those with allergies, vaccine confidence was initially shaken due to gaps in resources, professional medical advice, and representation in the literature. Ultimately, the decision to be vaccinated often was influenced by diverse stakeholders, including medical professionals, scientists, and governmental organizations, as well as community groups. Knowledge translation efforts should address the identified gaps to reduce the spread of misinformation.\n\n41 Safety of Covid-19 vaccines and effect of Covid-19 infection in patients with mastocytosis\n\nAlex Nguyen1, Catherine K.

Given the paucity of data and concern of anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis, it is crucial to assess the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in this population. We aimed to assess the risk of allergic reactions and the effect of COVID-19 infection and vaccines among patients with mastocytosis.\n\nMethods: Participants were recruited from the Mastocytosis Registry (MASTER; Canada) and Sheba Medical Center (Israel) between December 2021 to May 2022. Consenting participants were administered standardized questionnaires querying: whether they were infected with COVID-19 and reported symptoms, if they received the first and second dose vaccines, and post-vaccination side effects including allergic reactions (urticaria/angioedema, current rash flaring and/or need for updosing medications, or respiratory symptoms) and common side effects including injection site pain and flu-like symptoms.\n\nResults: Forty-one participants with mastocytosis were administered a standardized questionnaire (mean age = 19, SD = 20.85; 58.5% male; 57.7% cutaneous mastocytosis; 38.5% systemic mastocytosis; 11.5% mast cell activation syndrome). Amongst all participants, 39.0% reported COVID-19 infection. Most (75.0%) reported flu-like symptoms, 18.7% were asymptomatic, and 6.2% had anosmia/ageusia. Of the 25 participants who were eligible for vaccination (3;5 years-old), 84.0% received a first-dose vaccine (71.4% Pfizer, 19.0% Moderna, 9.5% AstraZeneca) and 72.0% received a second-dose vaccine (83.0% Pfizer, 16.7% Moderna). Of those who received the first-dose vaccine, 38.1% reported common symptoms (flu-like symptoms, injection site pain), 14.0% allergic reactions (4.8% current hives flaring, 4.8% angioedema, 4.8% respiratory symptoms, 9.5% chest pain/palpitations, 9.5% ostealgia, and 4.8% diarrhea). Of those who received the second-dose vaccine, 50% reported common symptoms, 5.6% respiratory symptoms, 5.6% chest pain/palpitations, and 5.6% diarrhea. No significant difference was found between side effects of both vaccine doses. No reactions fulfilled the criteria for anaphylaxis in either dose.\n\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 infection and vaccines are well-tolerated in most patients with mastocytosis.\n\n42 Mimicker of cellulitis: colophony induced allergic contact dermatitis\n\nVivian Szeto1, Madeleine Smee2, Gordon Sussman2\n\n1Western University, London, ON, 2. University of Toronto, Toronto, ON\n\nCorrespondence: Vivian Szeto\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):42\n\nBackground: Colophony is a plant resin that is found in over 300 different types of products. It is a known allergen that causes bronchial asthma in those exposed to colophony fumes and allergic contact dermatitis in those who use band-aids, anti-wart agents and musicians who play string instruments. Allergic contact dermatitis is also a known mimicker of cellulitis. Differentiating features between the two include: increased rubor and heat in cellulitis, while in allergic contact dermatitis there is more pruritus, presents with tiny vesicles, weeping, fissuring, and crusting of the skin. In this case report, we present a patient with an erythematous lesion with overlying bullae that was initially treated as cellulitis.\n\nMethods: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of these details.\n\nResults: 67-year-old male was stung by an unidentified insect in the posterior aspect of his upper left leg. He was treated with Polypsorin and applied a band aid over the site for a week and a half. He subsequently developed erythema and bullae that spread to the medial and anterior aspect of his left leg. He was assessed at a walk-in-clinic and diagnosed with cellulitis. He was treated with oral cephalexin and transitioned to IV ceftriaxone due to lack of improvement. Patch skin test was performed to (1) paper tape (2) colophony (3) Shoppers Drug Mart band Aid (4) neomycin sulfate (5) Bacitracin. He tested positive to colophony and negative to the other agents with appropriate responses to positive and negative controls.\n\nConclusions: In this case, the patient has been counselled on different products that contain colophony and to avoid them moving forward. This case also highlights the importance of recognizing colophony allergy to increase early removal of the allergen. As well, it reviews the different clinical features between allergic contact dermatitis and colophony.\n\n44 Population, delivery and efficacy of patient education in atopic dermatitis: a scoping review\n\nBethany F. Wilken, Yuka Asai, Michele Zaman\n\nQueen’s University, Kingston, ON\n\nCorrespondence: Bethany F. Wilken\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2024, 20(Suppl 2):44\n\nBackground: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Poor treatment adherence in AD requires interventions to promote self-management; patient education in chronic diseases is key to self-management. Many international AD management guidelines published to date include a recommendation for educating patients as part of their treatment but there are no formal recommendations on how to deliver this knowledge.\n\nMethods: A scoping review was performed in the online databases MEDLINE and Ovid in October 2021. The search strategy yielded 388 articles. Of the 388 articles screened, 15 studies met the eligibility criteria, and the quantitative data was summarized by narrative synthesis.\n\nResults: The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials conducted in Europe, Asia and North America. Since 2002, there have been limited studies evaluating patient education in the treatment of AD. Frequent education methods used included group-based educational programs, educational pamphlets, individual consultations and online resources. Education was most commonly directed at caregivers and their children. Only one study compared the efficacy of different education methods. In all included studies, the heterogenous nature of outcome measures and study design limited the consistency of results. Despite the heterogeneity of studies, patient education was shown to improve quality of life (QoL), disease severity and psychological outcomes in AD patients.\n\nConclusions: This scoping review highlights that patient education is effective in a variety of domains relevant to AD treatment"
