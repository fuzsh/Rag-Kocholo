        "text": "Name: Elissa Johnson-Green\n\nOrganization: University of Massachusetts Lowell\n\nTitle: Assistant Professor of Music and Music Education\n\nGenre: General music education focused on composition\n\nYears in the Field: 20\n\nWhat do you do at University of Massachusetts Lowell?\n\nI teach future music teachers. I also have created and run a program called the EcoSonic Playground Project, which provides open access to musical instrument play for all children. We have brought this program to diverse learning communities in the US, Canada, and Ireland.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nMy whole life has revolved around music. After being a classical performer (flute and voice) for many years, I decided to shift my focus to music education. I started out as a music teacher in K-8 education. This experience taught me that children understand music as a powerful and meaningful force in their lives – one that they rely on for so many aspects of their social interactions, emotional development, artistic development, and learning. Now, as a professor who trains music educators, I teach my adult students how to approach teaching music from the perspective that music is at the core of what makes us human. I do this work because I want to influence my students to teach music as a dynamic, living art form and as an essential form of expression.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nTeaching! I am fortunate to work with amazing students who are dedicated to music education. They are talented, intelligent, and passionate about bringing music to all children.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nAll of the administrative tasks I need to do to make sure my program runs smoothly. Helping my students to navigate the scheduling system – and making sure they are on track to graduate.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nI take seriously my responsibility to provide high quality music educators to my community. Having more great music teachers available and working in the schools, means it’s more likely that the schools will value their music programs. My hope is to graduate students who will contribute to the growth and development of music education for all.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nI listen to anything that I consider to be good music. Some of my favorites: Palestrina, J.S. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, Bartok, Kendrick Lamar, Logic, Aretha Franklin, Koko Taylor, Led Zepplin, Rush, Bela Fleck, Abigail Washburn, Alison Krauss, and anything that Yo Yo Ma has ever played.\n\nSeen any good movies lately?\n\nInto the Spider-Verse. I highly recommend it.\n\nName: Betsy Hinkle\n\nOrganization: musiConnects\n\nTitle: Founder, Resident Musician and Curriculum Design\n\nMusic Genre: Chamber Music\n\nYears in the Field: 20\n\nWhat do you do at musiConnects?\n\nAfter founding the organization in 2007 and being its only director for 8 years, currently I perform as a violinist in our chamber music performances, and I teach private violin lessons, Chamber music and a K2 String instrument readiness class. I design (with a collaborative approach) and help implement all of our private lesson and chamber music curriculum.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nI firmly believe that access to the highest quality music education and performances is a right, not a privilege. I also firmly believe that to fully reap the benefits that music education has to offer, it must be done in a tailored, one-on-one approach, and that chamber music is the best model for young children to learn self-expression, peer leadership, and community development skills.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nIt seems that ideas for teaching approaches and solving problems seem to flow out of me. Sometimes my ideas get changed right after I try them, but there are always new ones to take their place. I also love when some ideas stick and continue to work, so I try and find ways to keep these ideas solidified and continued, by helping to make them second nature for teachers. I also love hearing others’ approaches and identifying new approaches that work, and adopting them.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nGoing with the flow when the unexpected happens: a student you’ve invested so much in, and whom you communicate so well with, just quits all of a sudden. When an audience or community is completely different than you imagined and your wonderful planning doesn’t get used at that moment.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nStudents whose previous experience in school or other activities wasn’t positive are suddenly revered, praised, role models. It takes a few years for some community members to trust that what we bring will be positive or lasting or relevant. But when they do, their commitment to the work takes on a new role, as collaborator.\n\nHow do you blow off steam?\n\nWatch TV, knit, do yoga, walk or hike, cook and bake.\n\nWhose work in the Creative Youth Development field do you admire and why?\n\nSebastian Ruth of CMW, he was a pioneer in this work, and who directly inspired musiConnects. Also Apple Hill Center for Chamber Music – a collective and long standing organization where chamber music ideals are really practiced in all aspects of the organization and passed along to all who encounter it.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nCarolina Chocolate Drops, Pixies, Crooked Still, AC Newman, and the New Pornographers\n\nDo you live with any animals?\n\nOne cat and I’d love to get a dog. Do my two kids and husband count?\n\nThe unauthorized biography of your life is titled:\n\nSlowly but Surely: the search for order amongst chaos inside the mind of a creative perfectionist\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nI’m going to continue to create, test, hone, and eventually publish my curriculum which includes a systematic approach to working with kids (violin, viola, cello) with few home-based supports and a graded chamber music curriculum with original compositions and arrangements for similar students.\n\nName: Paul J. Pitts\n\nOrganization: Boston Latin School\n\nTitle: Director of Fine Arts\n\nMusic Genre: Band, Jazz, Orchestra and Vocal\n\nYears in the field: 38\n\nWhat do you do at Boston Latin?\n\nI organize and coordinate a large arts department consisting of 1,100 music students, 900 visual art students, and 300 drama students. We have 11 full time arts faculty as well an additional eight adjunct faculty. I also conduct the Wind Ensemble, the Symphonic Band, the Big Band, and the Dues Band.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nFor a few reasons. I really love music, all kinds, some more than others but it is all really cool. The idea is if you love what you do most days it is not like work but more like a great way to spend a day. The groups that I teach are really quite good and we are able to play music that I find quite challenging to conduct and it is awesome to get to study and conduct this great music. Last year we played lots of Bernstein’s music, it was great. Great music and the students played it really well, a joy to work on with my groups. In jazz band we do a lot of Mingus and Ellington and other more contemporary charts but the charts that they are able to play has really gotten better every year so it is great to work on this music at such a high level. The other reason I do it is because I really like kids, I guess it keeps me young, talking to young people, I tend to think about what they are thinking about instead of my feet hurt and I need to sit down.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nThe music, the passion for the music. I spend a lot of time searching for music, at times it can be tough but I have been able to find music that is great, and once the students get to a certain level that can appreciate great music as well.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nThe daily grind is demanding, it is relentless, there is always something to do. So many students, events, festivals, auditions, concerts, etc etc. I am concerned for younger teachers, it seems like they keep asking for more and more from teachers that is not related to student instruction, but things that require more and more time. It seems to be getting even tougher to do a great job teaching with all of the non-teaching requirements.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nThat is sort of difficult to answer, they seem to enjoy the concerts, the auditorium is pretty well packed for most all of our major concert throughout the year. I get many positive comments from alumni when we perform for them several times throughout the year. I know the students enjoy it otherwise they would not take the elective classes.\n\nWhose work in the Creative Youth Development field do you admire and why?\n\nSome band directors in Massachusetts who have been role models for me and had outstanding programs. Paul Alberta from Norwood, Steve Massey from Foxboro, Jeff Leonard from Lexington and Vinney Macrina from Brockton. They have all had fantastic programs for many years, unfortunately all but one is retired but I still use them for questions about musical and administrative details.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nJazz all the time, in the last two years I have become a big fan of Dudamel in LA I love the music he selects, lots of classical music from Latin America that is so rhythmic and groove oriented. I always love to go to the Boston Symphony when I can, it is such a fantastic orchestra and a beautiful hall. Sixties rock and roll, I saw Led Zepplin live at the garden back in ’72 when I was 15 and it blew me away, they were incredible. I saw the Eagles last summer and they were also great.\n\nWhat are you currently reading?\n\nMostly magazine articles, the last book I finished was Miles Davis’ autobiography. I am reading Mingus’ now, Beneath the Underdog. A friend gave me John Coltrane’s book but I have not started it yet.\n\nThe unauthorized biography of your life is titled:\n\nMistakes in music, learn from mine.\n\nName: Sean Elligers\n\nOrganization: Berkshire Children and Families’ Kids 4 Harmony\n\nTitle: Teaching Artist\n\nMusic Genre: Mostly classical\n\nYears in the field: 9\n\nWhat do you do at Kids 4 Harmony?\n\nAt Kids 4 Harmony, I teach music theory, composition, trumpet, and some string technique to students ranging 3rd to 11th grade. I work with students on various music theory skills (scales, arpeggios, chord structures) and, through collective improvisation or using the notation software, Noteflight, students compose their own music based on those concepts. I also play the role of unofficial photographer for our program.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nMy students are incredibly smart, curious, introspective, often (intentionally) hilarious individuals and I feel incredibly fortunate to have developed close connections with them. As someone who thrives on collaborative work, I am instantly swept away and energized by their ideas and am committed to helping them gain access to the tools and knowledge they seek to pursue their compositional and performance ambitions.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nEngaging with the students and their families. More specifically, one of my favorite things to do is go to a student’s parent at the end of the program and brag about the new composition that their student has started or how great the student played in orchestra. The students will be the first to tell you that I’m far more excited than they are, but the parents still appreciate it.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nI regret never being able to spend a sufficient amount of time to help each student on their individual compositional projects in class. Despite running around to each student, helping them navigate questions with the software or find that initial spark of inspiration for their piece, it’s frustrating when class ends and there are eight students raising their hands begging you to come listen to their compositions or their revisions. I’m thrilled that they are eager to share but it always burns to tell them they’ll have to wait until next class.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nThanks to Berkshire Children and Families, the social service agency that Kids 4 Harmony is part of, our program is given the support and visibility that has helped us make collaborative relationships with the local schools, colleges, and other arts programs in the Berkshire community. Our families are always generous to share their appreciation for our program and for the opportunities the students are given to perform at these events.\n\nHow do you blow off steam?\n\nI chip away at my own compositions, try to make sense of synthesizers, and try to get better at instruments I’m less familiar with, like the violin or accordion.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nI drive a lot and I often find myself in a low-stakes crisis of what music I want to listen to. I might pull from a range of artists/genres (Ambrose Akinmusire, Mount Eerie, Bjork) but as of recently, I’ve found myself unexpectedly defaulting to any original soundtrack from SEGA Genesis or Super Nintendo video games.\n\nDo you live with any animals?\n\nI do! Her name is Cammie and she’s a chihuahua mix. True to her breed, she keeps us on our toes: shaking when we come home, shaking when she wants our food and shaking during thunderstorms.\n\nName: Kahmal London\n\nOrganization: The Clubhouse Network\n\nTitle: Coordinator/ Program Manager\n\nArtistic Genre: Fantasy Art\n\nYears in the Field: 3 Months\n\nWhat do you do at the Clubhouse Network?\n\nAt the Flagship Clubhouse, I work as a Coordinator who manages the Clubhouse space and all the materials present. Most of my time is spent encouraging the youth to be inspired and take ownership and responsibility for their work and desires. I work to help the youth take pride in the amazing work they create, and am passionate about helping them achieve their goals. I work with and discover new, innovative ways to be creative with the tools we have available, and share them with Clubhouse members and Mentors. I also perform outreach to various organizations within our community to attract more members to our space and increase productivity.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nI was a member of the Clubhouse as a youth in high school and learned many different techniques on how to apply myself artistically. I was offered techniques and tools that I would not have had the chance to experiment with outside of the Clubhouse, such as Adobe Creative Suite. I work as a Coordinator to ensure that youth are offered the same experiences I had that they may not have at home. I aim to encourage and inspire youth to use their imaginations to be as creative as possible and apply that to their careers and educational goals.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nI’m a highly optimistic person who sees the potential in everyone I meet. I feel one of my greatest strengths is discovering creativity and helping it flourish in the best way possible. I love meeting new members, discovering what they like, and inspiring them to continue to build upon their work to take it levels above what they originally imagined.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nTwo challenges I’ve discovered so far are planning and community building. I have long term plans of how I imagine the Clubhouse to be, but could do better at creating short term steps on how to achieve these goals. As I am a relatively new Coordinator, there are many long-term members that have their own visions on how they see our space. With more time, I would like to know each and every member and formulate a way to respect everyone’s wishes and desires of how they operate in our creative space.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nThe Clubhouse serves as a creative space for underserved youth who may not have the equipment needed to expand their imaginations. In my youth, I was one of those individuals who did not have the creative equipment available, but had a wild imagination. The Clubhouse inspired me to use my artistic talents to attend a four year college. It is very personal and important to me that we provide a space for youth to be creative for those who have never had the opportunity to do so. There are some very creative youth in my home neighborhood that could benefit from being a Clubhouse member and exploring their creativity. I am very passionate about my community acknowledging that we care about our youth’s dreams and aim to provide many opportunities for them to grow and know they are amazing!\n\nHow do you blow off steam?\n\nDrinking water really helps to calm me down. I am patient person and rarely get angry, but if I do, I drink water. I also laugh a lot.\n\nWhat do you create in your free time?\n\nI illustrate many different concepts in my free time. I’m an animal lover so I practice drawing different animals often. I also grew up reading comic books and playing a lot of video games so many of my drawings may revolve around those. When I have time, I also animate my illustrations, sculpt with clay, and paint.\n\nWhose work in the Creative Youth Development field do you admire and why?\n\nI attended Artists For Humanity when I was younger and was mentored under Robb Gibbs. He is a big influence on my creative style and how to manage myself artistically. His work is inspiring not only for me, but many others I grew up with and has done a lot for our community. I aim to inspire others the way he inspired me to never give up on my passions.\n\nSeen any good movies lately?\n\nAvengers: Infinity War was a big deal to me and was everything I wanted out of it. I love Marvel comics so I watched it expecting a lot to be influenced off the comic series and was so excited to learn it was completely different. Very creative and well done.\n\nThe unauthorized biography of your life is titled:\n\nSmall Canvas – Big Imagination\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nContinuing to be creative and inspiring!\n\nSee Kahmal’s work:\n\nhttp://www.wisemidasworld.tumblr.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/violx\n\nName: Josh Snyder\n\nOrganization: Sociedad Latina\n\nTitle: Manager of Arts, Culture, and Civic Engagement\n\nArtistic Genre: Guitar\n\nYears in the field: 5\n\nWhat do you do at Sociedad Latina?\n\nI oversee all of our arts programming and most recently, am taking on oversight of our health education and civic engagement program. More specifically, we serve 30 high school youth in our after school programming and are aiming to serve 300 students through our in school arts classes and Saturday lessons program.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nMusic had been a passion of mine since early middle school, being an adult and able to sustain my life on something I truly love is extremely rewarding. Beyond this, I really enjoy being able to provide tools and resources to young people who are passionate about music as well; having a supportive figure during my early years as an artist was crucial.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nThe front line work with students is by far my favorite part of the work I do. When students discover something they enjoy or have never been able to do before, it pushes me to continue to challenge them and provide guidance.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nAdmin tasks! I really struggled with sending emails on time, organizing data, and putting together long term plans when I first started. I’ve since remedied this due to the fact that all of these “no fun” pieces allow me to deliver better programming to the youth\n\nwe serve.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nTo be honest, I can’t speak for what it means to all of the students. My job is to make sure the access is there for them to develop their own artistic vision and ability. Whether its a student on the track for a conservatory, or a weekend living room musician, I treat every student with the same amount of respect and urgency. I hope\n\nthey see me, other instructors, and Sociedad Latina as a safe, fun, and challenging space for them to develop.\n\nHow do you blow off steam?\n\nOther than playing music with friends, I like to get rid of stress rock climbing. When the weather is good, I’m often in New Hampshire or Western Mass with friends camping and climbing for the weekend. I’ve also has the opportunity to climb in New York, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Utah.\n\nWhat do you create in your free time?\n\nI’ve been really inspired lately by solo acoustic guitar pieces. One of my favorite players, Julian Lage, has really pushed me to work harder in this style. I’m trying to get together a full set of repertoire to record a CD of original pieces.\n\nWhose work in the CYD field do you admire and why?\n\nMy supervisor, Juan Maldonado, is someone I’m very inspired by both professionally and musically. His approach to teaching and working with young people commands respect and challenges students to really utilize the time they have in program. Musically, he is a fantastic bass player (among many other instruments) and\n\ncomposer.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nI listen to a lot of jazz, both contemporary and classic, hip hop, R&B, folk, indie, really all styles besides country.\n\nName: Pedro Cruz\n\nOrganization: IBA (Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion)\n\nTitle: Youth Arts Program Coordinator\n\nArtistic Genre: Photography/Poetry\n\nYears in the Field: 11\n\nWhat do you do at IBA?\n\nI am currently the Youth Arts Program Coordinator for IBA’s Youth Development Team. This means I work with teens on a daily basis throughout the school and summer cycle. According to my job description my duties are to design art based curriculum that introduces the idea of social justice, as well as help the youth express their own views and concerns through art. But anyone in this field knows it’s more than that. If you ask me, my number one job is to build strong, long lasting relationships with my youth. The type of relationships that save lives.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nI was born and raised in what I like to call a concrete jungle. It’s easy to be overlooked or judged when you’re a young minority from a community that suffers from poverty, turf wars and gentrification. I remember while growing up the only safe space I had was the local community center and teen spaces. I will never forget the impact those places had on me. I guess now I just want to be who I wish I had when I was younger.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nThe easiest thing for me about this job is connecting with the youth. There is no science to it. I just do it. I was born and raised in the same streets they are navigating today. I know their struggles, their challenges and their desires. I know what they have to go through on a daily basis. I know how it feels to leave your neighborhood and feel as if you’re crossing into enemy territory. I know how it is to stay out of trouble but still be considered part of the problem just because of where you live or who you hang out with. These things can’t be thought. They must be lived.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nThe one thing that challenges me most is not being able to serve every youth that I come across. Sometimes it’s because of limited space or funding, but it hurts me to meet a youth and not be able to serve them the way they need to be served. Some youth require a lot more attention than others do, and that is not something easy to live with. In this job you need to know when to ask for help, and asking for help wasn’t something I did a lot of growing up.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nThe beauty of all of this is that I currently work for the same Creative Youth Development Program I attended when I was a teenager. I have been blessed with the opportunity to work in my community and serve children I literally saw grow up around me. At this point, I can only speak from what I been told and I like to think that it means a lot to my community to see me doing this type of work. There has been many cases where parents feel a lot more comfortable allowing their kids to participate once they know it’s me who’s running the workshop or activity. That has to count for something.\n\nHow do you blow off steam?\n\nBelieve it or not, I go for walks around the city. No destination in mind. I just leave my house and wander around. There’s something about this process that I find therapeutic. I let my spirit guide me as I am studying people, soaking in the sounds and just watching an entire city live around me.\n\nWhat do you create in your free time?\n\nEasy- photographs and poems.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nI must admit, I am possibly the biggest Blackbear fan in Boston. I love his music because it’s real. There’s no filter or sugarcoating to it. It is what it is. I like to think my art is the same way.\n\nThe unauthorized biography of your life is titled:\n\n“Building New Rome”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThat’s always a good question to think about. Truthfully, I am currently working on a poetry book and building my photography brand. I just want to continue building my name as an artist and youth worker in the Boston area.\n\nSee Pedro’s work:\n\nwww.flakoveli.com\n\nwww.instagram.com/mrflakoveli\n\nName: Tony Jones\n\nOrganization: Enchanted Circle Theater\n\nTitle: Teaching & Performing Artist\n\nArtistic Genre: Performance Arts\n\nYears in the Field: 27\n\nWhat do you do at Enchanted Circle Theater?\n\nAs a Teaching and Performing Artist, I work in the classroom, in communities, and anywhere learning happens using the arts as a tool to teach, to empower, and to bring about change!\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nI wouldn’t know what else to do. I have spent my entire career as an actor and educator. It is my heartbeat.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nConnecting with people whose voices get silenced comes naturally to me. I know what it’s like to feel unheard and unseen. My objective is to make everyone’s voice count.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nI wish there were more time in the day.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nMy community becomes an example of how education and the arts are stepping stones for further advancement. Working with disadvantaged youth and being an example of what could be if you work hard and work for change is the example I am always trying to set. I want every community to have a voice.\n\nHow do you blow off steam?\n\nI read. I cook. I eat. I listen. I learn.\n\nWhat do you create in your free time?\n\nI write a lot of poetry. I create spoken-word. I create a peaceful atmosphere around me.\n\nWhose work in the CYD field do you admire and why?\n\nI admire everyone’s work in this field. It all matters.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nErykah Badu, Whitney Houston, Black Star, Conscious Hip-Hop\n\nDo you live with any animals?\n\nI want a dog so bad, but I am never home long enough to take care of one.\n\nSeen any good movies lately?\n\nGet Out was excellent!\n\nWhat are you currently reading?\n\nThe Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Maria Kondo\n\nThe unauthorized biography of your life is titled:\n\nSlow and Steady Wins the Race\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nRehearsal\n\nName: Rebecca Frost\n\nOrganization: Margarita Muñiz Academy\n\nTitle: Lead Teacher of El Sistema-Inspired Music Program\n\nMusic Genre: Varied Genres – Wind Ensemble\n\nYears in the Field: 9\n\nWhat do you do at Margarita Muñiz Academy?\n\nI teach instrumental music (wind ensemble) to high school students ranging from beginners to students with 3-4 years of experience. On a typical day, I coach students in sectionals and/or direct full ensembles. When in sectionals, I work mostly with woodwind players, while our faculty who specialize in brass and percussion typically work with those sections accordingly.\n\nWhy do you do what you do?\n\nSince I was in high school, I knew that I wanted to go into music, and then I fell in love with teaching when I was in college. I love watching students grow as people and as musicians; their excitement fuels my motivation on a daily basis! I am also passionate about providing quality music education to students who wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity.\n\nWhat comes easiest to you in this work?\n\nTeaching beginners. They are eager to learn and their enthusiasm at every accomplishment fuels their motivation to continue learning more and improving.\n\nWhat challenges you in this work?\n\nSupporting students through many challenging situations that happen outside of school. It is hard for me to imagine what many of my students live with on a daily basis – violence, interrupted schooling, language barriers, living in a shelter, or being the primary caretaker at home. I am constantly wondering how we can better support our students not only as musicians, but as people.\n\nWhat does it mean to your community that you do this work?\n\nThere is a need for high quality music programs in Boston Public Schools, and the Margarita Muñiz Academy attracts students not only for its dual-language curriculum, but also for its music program. We also provide opportunities for teaching artists at local universities and music organizations to come in and work with our students, in addition to accepting student teachers from Boston Conservatory/Berklee. Our students participate in collaborative community events with the El Sistema community, Boston Public Schools community, Charles River Wind Ensemble, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra through their residency program in Jamaica Plain.\n\nWhat do you create in your free time?\n\nI try to “create” space to relax in and focus on life. I practice flute regularly and I fill-in as a flautist with various local ensembles. I also enjoy making modern needlepoint artwork. I have many of them framed in my apartment, and I make them for friends sometimes too. I also “create” time to volunteer. In the past, I have volunteered weekly at a soup kitchen and a senior home; I am currently volunteering at Daily Table in Dorchester – a non-for-profit grocery store that provides high quality healthy food at affordable prices.\n\nWhat music do you like listen to (if even a little too loudly)?\n\nI like a wide variety of music, and what I listen to depends on my mood. I like classical music, especially Shostakovich, Copland, and Mahler. I also really like a lot of international music – lots of Latin music and sometimes Irish music. I am a huge fan of Broadway shows, so I often shuffle some Broadway soundtracks into my listening. Right now, I’m listening to a lot of “Hamilton”, “Les Miserables”, and “Book of Mormon.”"
