This expectation is naturally excited by the somewhat wide patronage accorded to the first volume. There is not a public library of any magnitude in any State of the Union upon whose shelves this work has not be.en placed, a fact partially explained by the unique prestige which belongs to Georgia as one of the original thirteen States of the Union and as the youngest of the English Colonies in North America.\n\nOnly a few words of explanation in presenting this volume. The apparent inequalities between the different sections of the State, with respect to materials possessing historic value, are due largely to the fact that some localities are much older than others and have been much more actively and vitally concerned in the making of history. There has also been a difference in the degree of co-operative encouragement extended to the author. Some to whom the writer has looked for help have eagerly embraced an opportunity for assisting in the preserva tion of Georgia's records; but others, for what have doubtless seemed to them good reasons, have been strangely indifferent. Such has ever been the way of the world; and many who are slow to help are prompt to criticize. But we need not find fault. It is only natural that we should take a delight in doing wha,t we can do best. To the patriotic women of our State, the author wishes to renew his expressions of gratitude for assistance most graciously and freely given. Their kindness has been a cruse of oil, which through seasons of drought, has never failed. Else where in this work specific acknowledgments are made to these gentle contributors.\n\nThe reader's attention is specially directed to the elaborate index which this volume contains, an index which embraces both volumes of the set, traversing the whole history of the State, since the time of Oglethorpe, and aggregating nearly 20,000 names. Historical research has heretofore been greatly handi capped by a lack of good indexes. In fact, most of our earlier histories are wholly without this important aid to investigation. Much time and labor have been spent in the preparation of this feature. To ascertain whether an ancestor is represented in\n\nvt\n\nPREFACE\n\nthis work tlie reader needs only to consult the index, in \"which, a thorough analysis of the work is presented in an alphabetical scheme of arrangement. Special attention is also called to the numerous inscriptions grouped together in the section on \"Historic Churchyards and Burial-Grounds\"; to the somewhat extended list of early settlers who served either as town commis sioners or as academy trustees; and to the monograph entitled '' Under the Code Duello.'' Most of the information herein set forth has been derived at first hand from personal visits to various parts of the State and from direct and immediate access to official records. Quite a number of rare Indian Legends have been dug out of old reports in the Library of Congress; and some of these, because of the novelty which attaches to them, will be read with much interest.\n\nIntervals of leisure, extending over a period of five years, have been occupied in gathering the materials for this work and in putting them, into permanent literary form. Professional engagements have not been, seriously disturbed, nor the routine of official labors interrupted. The writer has accomplished his task by making the field of Georgia history his playground. He tws given to it his early morning- hours, frequently beginning \"his\" day's work at dawn and outlining a full chapter before breakfast. The other end of the day has always found him taxed' to 'exhaustion and ready for sleep. He has burned no midnight oil.\n\n. Infallibility is not vouchsafed to mortals. Exact Truth, if the hope, is also the despair of historians.- To 110 one are the shortcomings of this work in ore painfully apparent than to the Author'himself. Mindful of his human frailties and limitations, he,has'Sought only to render conscientious and. faithful service to Ms State. THIs has ever been his endeavor. He will be satis fied if Georgia's benediction rests upon his labors; happier sti'll'if, when his day's work is done, he can fall asleep in the cla:'sp of liei* violets around him the ashes of his loved ones and' over him an epitaph, like this: \"Here lies one who gave ft is\" peri to Georgia's memories, whose ambition was to brighten the names on her fading records and to deepen the epitaphs on Tier mouldering monuments, wrhose richest recompense of reward wa.s' found in the all-sufficient joy of service, and who coveted iiaxight 'within the gift of the old mother State, save the privilege of loving every foot of her soil and every page of her history/ 7\n\n..-\"., i >:; , : -. - ;..\n\nLiTiciAisr LAMAK KNIGHT.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nSECTION I.\n\nUNDER THE CODE DTJEI,LO_ ______ \"_^_____^-,______^___.. ________ 1-48\n\nSECTION II.\n\nLANDMARKS ANT> MEMORIALS---- -.,,,,______________._____-_____- 51-271\n\nCHAPTER I__ _ _ __ _ . _ ._Hernando DeSoto: Memorials of his March\n\nThrough Georgia in 1540_____________ 51-52\n\nCHAPTER 1I_ _______ _\"Hoine, Sweet Home:\" John Howard Payiie's\n\nGeorgia, Sweetheart and Imprisonment- 62-71\n\nCITAFTEB HI ________Lost for 114: Years: the Mystery of General\n\nGreene's Place of Entombment _______ 71-89\n\nCHAPTER IV _ , _ _ __ __ .Georgia's Great Seals. _ _____ ., ____________ 89-99\n\nCHAPTER V __________ Georgia Issues the First Patent for a Steam\n\nboat __________._ __________________ 99-102\n\nCHAPTER VI_ _______ .President Washington's Georgia Visit: the\n\nDiary of his Trip ___________________ 102-100\n\nCHAPTER VIT,_._-\n\nGeneral Elijah Clarke's Trans-Oconee Re\n\npublic. _ ________.--------______-__..__ 106-115\n\nCHAPTER VIII--- _ _ - _ .Famuli at Goliad: Story of the Brutal Mass\n\nacre of 1836 _________________________ 115-121\n\nCHAPTER lX_-_-____ William H.

Trial by battle or wager of battle represented a crude form of justice to which the Lombards began to resort as early as the year 659 of the Christian era and \"which, subsequent to the battle of Hastings, in 1066, was intro duced into England by AVilliam the Conqueror. But the general practice of duelling to settle affairs of honor be tween gentlemen may be said to have commenced in 1527, when Francis I, of France, issued a challenge to Charles V, of Germany, directing him to name his own time and place and to make his own choice of weapons with which to fight.\n\nThe affair seems to have grown out of an abrogated treaty, in consequence of which the German Emperor sent a curt message to King Francis, through the latter's her ald, declaring him to be not only a base violator of public faith but a stranger to the honor becoming a gentleman.* Incensed at this message, which he considered a wanton insult, the impetuous French sovereign instantly sent\n\n2\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nback the bearer with a cartel of defiance, in which he gave the lie to Emperor Charles and incidentally, by way of royal precedent, laid the foundations for the mod ern duel. Equally high-spirited, Charles V promptly accepted the challenge of the French King; but, during the correspondence which ensued, there arose complica tions of an international character, and after exchanging several messages in \"which German expletives weTe \"well matched with French epithets, the idea of meeting each other in mortal encounter was finally abandoned.\n\nNevertheless, the spectacle of a quarrel between two of the most illustrious potentates of Christendom, on a mooted question of honor, attracted too much attention find carried too great a weight of authority to be without its effect upon the chivalry of Europe ; and, from this time on, the practice of duelling, especially at the royal courts, in the university towns, and among officers of the army, became prevalent. During a period of eighteen years, under the reign of Henry IV, it is said that 4,000 lives were sacrificed on the Field of Honor.\n\nFrance became the chief patron of the Code; but the mania for duelling swept the civilized world like a besom of fire, involving, on both sides of the \"water, men of the highest political and social distinction. Its effect was most tellingly felt upon Democratic America, where it struck deep root and began to spread like the deadly Upas. Formerly, duels were fought under judicial ap pointment; but the precedent set by Francis I, of France, caused impetuous Hotspurs instantly to adopt this method of redress for private wrongs, without the intervention of the courts; and thus, until public sentiment began to insist upon a return to saner measures, the duel be came 'One of the established institutions of society, among\n\nmen of Caucasian blood.\n\nGeorgia was one of the first States of the Union to find the duel an effective instrument for the adjustment of differences between gentlemen; and likewise one of\n\nUNOEK THE CODE DUELLO\n\n3\n\nthe last States to abandon a custom, perhaps, more hon ored in the breeeh than in the observance. At a time when party strife was most intense and bitter, it was an almost daily occurrence for men to cross swords or to exchange shots in personal encounters, but everything was done according to prescribed form and with punc tilious regard for the Code of Honor. There was scarcely a public man in Georgia who was not credited with at least one duel, fought usually in the earlier stages of his career. If one refused to fight when challenged by a gentleman he was at once posted; and such an open dis grace meant social ostracism. Political honors were not awarded to cowards nor to those who, weighed in the balances of an imperious custom, were found wanting in courage; and, for upwards of a hundred years, the public life of this State was ruled with a rod of iron by that grim arbiter of destinies : the Code Duello.\n\nFor the paramount sway of the duelling-pistol in a State like Georgia there were sound reasons. To begin with, the partisanship of the Kevolution entailed upon us a host of feudal animosities. It also engendered the military spirit, to which life on the frontier gave con stant exercise, through the ever present dread of an Indian outbreak. Children at play revelled in the use of toy weapons, with which they stormed, imaginary forts and citadels. The long protracted warfare between Clark and Crawf ord, at a later period, divided the State into two hostile camps, in consequence of which there were personal wrangles and disputes without number.\n\nScores of the best families of our State traced de scent from the nobility of England; and there was in grained in the very nature of the average Georgian an inherent love of personal encounter, as old as the tilt-yards of the Norman Conqueror. While the main body of our population was of English origin, there was an intermingling of two other strains in which the duel found a congenial soil: the Scotch-Irish, grim and silent, tenacious of personal opinion, untatight to yield an inch\n\n4:\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS., MEMOKTAT.S AND LiMiiNDS\n\nof ground; and the French Huguenot, fiery and impulsive, full of the military spirit, and prone, without thought of consequences, to seek the bubble, Eeputatioii, at the can non's mouth. ISTor is it strange that in a State which knew nothing of the austere Puritan there should have flourished an institution reflecting the love of swords manship, the relish for adventure, and the contempt of personal danger, which, from time immemorial, have been peculiar to the English Cavalier.\n\nGwinnett and The earliest duel of which there is any\n\nMclntosh.\n\nmention in the records of Georgia was the\n\nfatal encounter which occurred, on May\n\n15, 1777, betwT eeii Button Gwiimett and Jjachlan Mcln\n\ntosh.* It \"was just after the adoption of our first State\n\nConstitution and wdien the State was in the midst of\n\npreparations for an expected invasion by the1 British.\n\nBoth combatants were zealous Whigs and men of the\n\nhighest distinction in public affairs. Biittoii Gwinnett\n\nhad been one of the revered trio of patriots to sign the\n\nimmortal scroll of independence on behalf of Georgia and\n\nhad subsequently administered the affairs of the1 Province\n\nas President of the Executive Council. Lachlan McTntosh\n\nwas at this time the commanding 'officer of Georgia's first\n\nbattalion of State troops and was destined to attain high\n\nrank as a soldier under Washington. The misunder\n\nstanding between the two men grew out of a heated con\n\ntroversy in which they were both rivals for the same\n\noffice: that of commandant of the new battalion lately or\n\nganized in Georgia for service in the Continental Army.\n\nMclntosh was the successful candidate. .\"Later, on\n\nthe death of Archibald Bulloch, who was then President\n\nof the Executive Council, Gwinnett succeeded to the\n\nhelm of civil affairs in Georgia; and, while acting in\n\nthis capacity, he planned an expedition against St. Au-\n\n*Jones: History of Georgia, Vol. 2, p. 270; McCall: History of Georgia, Vol. 2, pp. 331-335, reprint.\n\nUNDER THE CODE DUELLO\n\n5\n\ngustine, which lie expected to command in person, ignor ing General Mclntosh. At the same time, in various other ways, he evinced his hostility toward his former rival and sought to magnify the civil at the expense of the military department of the State government.\n\nCut the projected advance on St. Augustine failed to materialize. Moreover, in the first election for Governor by the State Legislature, held on May 8, 1777, G-winnett, an avowed candidate for the office, was defeated by John Adam Treutlen, who, by virtue of his election at this time, became the first Governor of Georgia \"under the Constitution.\n\nG'winuott was naturally chagrined at his defeat. On the other hand, Mclntosh \"was elated; and, with the bluntness 'of the Scotch Highlander lie not only expressed his gratification at the result but went so far as to denounce Gwinnctt as a scoundrel, in the presence of the Execu tive Council. This open insult was more than the im perious nature of Gwimiett could endure and, chafing already under his disappointment, he at once challenged Mclntosh to mortal combat.\n\nPreliminaries were arranged and at day-break next morning they met on the outskirts of Savannah. At a distance of only twelve feet apart, they exchanged pistol shots and both fell to the ground. It was discovered on examination that each was wounded in the thigh. Mc lntosh recovered. But Gwmnett's wound proved fatal; and, after Jing'ering\" in great pain for twelve days, he ex pired: the first known victim in Georgia to the Code of Honor.\n\nExcitement in Georgia ran higii. As a Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Gwimiett was much revered by the people, notwithstanding his impetuosity of tem per. Dr. Lynian Hall, a former colleague in Congress, Avho signed the scroll of independence with Gwinnett, broug'ht the matter before the Legislature and: accused\n\n6\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\ntlie judicial officers of criminal neglect in not ordering Macintosh's arrest. At this critical moment, Mclntosh, of his own accord, surrendered himself to the civil au\n\nthorities. But the Gwinnett faction was not appeased. In the\n\nface of a common enemy, Georgia was threatened with a serious division in her ranks. To avoid a rupture of the State, at a time when the cause of liberty called for a solid phalanx, Colonel George Wilton, of Georgia, and Colonel Henry Laurens, of South Carolina, both members of Congress, acting as friends of Mclntosh, obtained for him a command in the Northern Department; and thus an embarrassing situation was relieved. With his trans fer to the Northern Department, Mclntosh gradually rose to high rank and won by his gallantry the personal friendship and esteem of AVashington.\n\nIjater he returned to Georgia in time to participate in the defence of Savannah. There was no longer any feeling of animosity toward him and at the close of the Revolution he re-established his home in Savannah, where he was made President of the Georgia Society of the Cincinnati. Gwinnett was an Englishman who came to Georgia only four years prior to the Revolution. He purchased St. Catharine's Island and became an exten sive planter of rice and indigo. His home was just oppo site the old town of Sunhury, in the Parish of St. John.\n\nDuel on Horse- Two of the most distinguished officers Back Prevented. in command of Georgia's State troops\n\nduring the Revolution were Colonel John Baker and Major John Jones, both of whom were devoted patriots. But they came near shedding each other's blood in a most spectacular fashion, while await ing an expected encounter with the British soon after the fall of Savannah. As the result of a misinterpreta tion of orders they quarreled; and, one thing bringing on another, they agreed to settle the issue between them by\n\nUNDER THE CODE DUELJ..O\n\n7\n\nfighting a duel on horse-back. Accordingly they repaired to a grove, near old Midway church, somewhat back from the travelled highway; but, when the hour for combat arrived, an officer whose uniform told that he was a Brigadier-Gen oral suddenly appeared upon the scene of\n\naction.\n\nIt was General James Screven. Only a few moments before while seated in camp, a courier had brought him word of the affair; and, putting spurs to his horse, he dashed like a bolt of lightning through the forest. Breath less with excitement, he arrived just in time; for the two men \"were already facing each other with deadly in tent. Lifting his hand as he drew rein, he commanded them to desist; and then pleading the country's sore need he reminded the combatants that it w-as no time for brother officers to be seeking each other's life, when the\n\ncause of liberty was imperiled. High-spirited though both men \"were, they yielded to\n\nthe importunities of General Screven, realizing the force of his argument. The spirit of patriotism prevailed over the mere desire for personal redress; and, shaking hands on the field of honor, the would-be duellists agreed to bury their quarrel there on the spot and to reserve their fire for the British Bed-Coats, who were already beginning to swarm over Georgia like a plag'ue of locusts. But strange are the ways of fate. Within a few months, General Screven was shot from ambush near this same place, while engaged in reconnoitering'.\n\nGov. Jackson Old Governor James Jackson illustrious As a Duellist. in the annals of Georgia for his crusade\n\nof fire against the Yazoo conspirators was the most inveterate duellist of his day. He was con stantly on the war-path. Growing\" out of the spectacu lar part played by him in causing the famous Yazoo Act of 1795 to be rescinded, he was drawn at frequent inter vals into affairs of honor, from few of which he escaped\n\n8\n\nGEORGIA ''s JJATXTDMARKS, M/K MORTALS AND TJEGE:N\"DS\n\nwithout loss of blood. For at least ten years, his life was literally a round of duels.\n\n\"When the Tazoo measure became a law in 1795, the old Governor was then serving his first term in the United States Senate. Incensed at what he considered the trickery by \"which this legislation, was accomplished, he relinquished his toga of office and took his seat in the Legislature of Georgia as a member from Chatham. Tim infamous measure in question convoyed to four separate and distinct land companies the whole of Georgia's west ern domain, in return for -which the State was to be compensated in the sum of $500,000, or at the rate of one and a half cents per acre, for thirty-live million acres of land. Such a transaction was regarded by the old Gov ernor as a blot upon Georgia's escutcheon, and with im passioned eloquence he sought to erase this iniquitous measure from the statute books. He accomplished his ymrpose. The Legislature of 1796 rescinded the obnox ious Act; and on the State House Square, in the solemn presence of the General Assembly, every record pertain ing\" to the transaction was burned, with impressive cere monies. It was on tliis occasion that Governor Jackson, by means of a sun-glass, called down the fire of heaven. Thus was Georgia's honor redeemed.\n\nT>ut the old Governor reaped a harvest of feudal en mities. TTis duelling-pistols were rarely ever cool. .But so violent 'was the Jacksonian temper, that he did not always wait upon the tardy formalities of the Code. Oc casions arose when he demanded satisfaction instanter. Writing to John Mil ledge, in a letter dated Savannah, March 8, 1796, he describes one of these extemporaneous encounters, in Avhich he proceeded to bite his antagonist's fiiig'cr.* On ordinary occasions the Governor was a great stickler for decorum. Hotspur though he was, booted and spurred for battle, he always bore himself with the urbanity of a Chesterfield. No one was ever more considerate of the rights of others.

To\n\nward the close of the Revolution, he became involved in\n\na controversy with Lieutenant-Governor \"Wells, in con\n\nsequence of which the two men met in deadly encounter\n\nsome time during' the year 1780. The latter lost his life\n\nin this exchange of shots. Governor Jackson then a\n\nM>ajor in command of partisan troops -was severely\n\nwounded in both knees. If. there were any eye witnesses\n\nto this duel, the details were never divulged, and tradition\n\nis strangely silent upon the subject. Judge Charltoii,\n\nthe authorized biographer of Governor Jackson, says\n\nthis \"We only know that they went upon the ground\n\nwithout seconds and fought at the desperate distance of\n\na few feet.\" .However, among the papers of Governor\n\nJ'acksoii has been discovered a letter in which he laments\n\nthe necessity of the duel, stating- that it was imposed upon\n\nhim \"by the overbearing disposition of the Lieutenant-\n\nGovernor.* But if the temper of Governor \"Wells took\n\nfire any more readily than did Governor Jackson's, it\n\nmust have been more explosive than nitro-glyccrine.\n\nHis Duels with Perhaps the most inveterate political Robert Watkins. enemy of the old Governor was TJobert\n\nWatkiiis, of Augusta. Watkins \"was at this time one of the recognized leaders of the Georgia bar. He was a member of the Yazoo Legislature of 1795 and a supporter of the bill for the sale of Georgia's western\n\n*Charlton: Life of Jackson\n\n10 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nlands, regarding this measure purely in the light of a real estate transaction. With his brother, George, he compiled the earliest Digest of Georgia Laws.\n\nBut, most unfortunately, when the volume appeared, in 1800, it contained the obnoxious Yazoo Act, rescinded by the Legislature of 1796; and Governor Jackson, who was then occupying the Executive Chair, refused to draw his warrant upon the treasury and in other ways put the seal of his official condemnation upon this earliest Digest of Georgia Laws. Jn vain Watkins expostulated, lie showed that ^vhile his digest carried the obnoxious measure, it also carried the Eepealing Act, the one coun ter-balancing the other. But the old Governor was ob durate. He regarded the Yazoo Act as a usurpation and he did not wish to see it monumentalized upon the statutebooks.*\n\nThus the issue was joined. On both sides there was much bitterness of feeling. At least three separate duels were fought between Gov. Jackson and Robert Watkins. In the last of these encounters, the old Governor was se verely wounded in the right hip. He was lifted from the ground and, finding that he could still stand alone, in sisted upon another exchange of shots. But the surgeon urged an examination. He pried into the wound and, fearing that the bullet might have entered the cavity, ordered a cessation of hostilities. With great civility, so it is said, Mr. Watkins helped to bear the wounded man from the field; whereupon, the old Governor, who re mained perfectly rational throughout and who was not to be outdone in courtesy by his antagonist, was heard to observe :\n\n\"Hang it, Watkins, I thought I could give you another shot.\"*\n\nThough a small appropriation was secured for the Watkins Digest, the book was never authorized.

Marbury and Crawford prosecuted the task alone and, in due time, com pleted the undertaking-. It is known to this day as Marbury and Crawford's Dig'est of Georgia Laws.\n\nBesides the formal encounters which took place be tween Jackson and Watkins, they met somewhat uncere moniously on certain occasions and engaged, in fisticuff fights. One of these occurred soon after the Yazoo Act was rescinded, showing that the enmity between the two men ran back to the famous land speculation in which some of the most influential men of Georgia were in volved. The difficulty occurred in Louisville, at the close of the Legislative session. AVe quote this paragraph from a letter describing\" the affair: \"This was done to bring on dispute. Flesh and blood of such ^cxture as mine would not bear it (i. e., the provocation offered by Watkins), and the lie and stick involuntarily new on him.\"* In this encounter, Gov. Jackson was stabbed in several places and for a time his wounds were thought to be mortal.\n\nHis Duel\n\nThomas Gibbons, a lawyer of Savannah,\n\nWith Gibbons. who as early as the year 1800 is said to\n\nhave earned $15,000 per annum from the\n\npractice of law, an income equivalent to $60>000 at the\n\npresent time, was frequently on opposing sides to Q-ov-\n\nernor Jackson in civil litigation before the courts. He\n\nwas also extensively eng'aged in land speculations. Con\n\nsequently, there was little in common between the two\n\nmen except a violent temper, the effect of which was to\n\nhasten them, to the field. But they appear to have met\n\n12\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MKMOKIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nonly once, at which time three shots were exchanged between them, without effect.\n\nThere is nothing- in the records on which to base any positive statement to the effect that Grov. Jackson ever became involved in personal difficulties with Gen. Gunn, but the latter was a notorious Yazooist and was a col league of G-ov. Jackson in the United States Senate when the Jattcr relinquished the tpg-a to begin his fight against the speculators. If they did not meet on the field of honor, it is little short of marveloiis. In the opinion of not a few commentators upon the subject, the Yazoo \"Fraud has been overworked by historians. Some of the leading men of the State were concerned in it oil the ground that it \"was merely a real estate transaction; and when we remember that it was before the days of railway and telegraph communication, we must admit that Geor gia's western lands were comparatively worthless. Even so pronounced a patriot as Patrick Henry headed one of the Yazoo companies organized in Virginia.\n\nI5ut Governor Jackson was undoubtedly sincere in his fight against the Yazooists, whom he regarded in the light of conspirators. No man was ever more inflamed with, the ardor of a righteous indignation. But he paid the penalty. According' to Thomas Hart Bcnton, with whom he served in the United States Senate, his death, in 1806, was due directly to wounds received in a duel, the last ofenarry caused by his opposition to the Yazoo Fraud. More than any other man in Georgia, Governor Jackson was distinguished for his prowess in personal combat; and he carried to his grave the sears of count less hostile meetings on the field of honor.\n\nTaliaferro Even the Bench became infected by this and Willis. homicidal mania. Col. Benjamin Taliaferro,\n\na comrade-in-arms of the fiery Jackson, was also a duellist, though he is credited in the authentic records with only one encounter. Col.

He was not himself a disciple of Blackstonc, l>ut such was his reputation, -throughout the County of Wilfees, both for sound business judgment and for strict probity of character that, layman though he was, the Legislature which rescinded the Yazoo Act elevated him to the' Bench and made him the first judge of what was then kuown as the Western Circuit. lie was a man whose sense of de corum was unusually acute, but such was the ethical standard of the times with respect to duelling that his position on the Bench did not prevent him from meeting Col. Francis Willis for a round of buck-shot.\n\nThis was in 1796. Col. Willis was a man of means. He was also a prominent Yazooist. Aggrieved by some decision adverse either to his political faction or to his personal interests, he challenged Col. Taliaferro to a duel, \"which the latter lost no time in accepting. The Judge's aim \"was unerring; and, in the eucounter which followed, Col. Willis received a wound in his rigiit breast, so near the vital center, that he declined a second shot. Col. Taliaferro, in this engagement, used the old horse man's pistols worn by him when he belonged to Lee's Legion. *\n\nGolden Age But the Golden Age of the Code Duello in of the Duel. Georgia was the period extending from\n\n1800 to 1830, when the public life of this State was dominated by two powerful personalities: Gen. John Clark and Hon. William H. Crawford. Party spirit iu this State has never been more rancorous than during this period ; and, indeed, to the feudal animosity between these two noted Georgians, making them the most invet erate personal and political enemies, some \"writers have even traced the origin of parties in Georgia. But this is not entirely accurate. During the Revolutionary period, our State was divided between the Whig's and the\n\n14 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND IJEGENDS\n\nTories. For a score of years after the Federal Consti tution was adopted, the Bepublicans and the Federalists were rival political parties in Georgia; and while the latter was never numerically very strong in this State, due to the fact that some of its leaders were actively in volved in the Yazoo transaction, it was nevertheless at one time sufficiently entrenched in the citadel of wealth to force Josiali Meigs from the Presidency of Franklin College, on the ground that he was ah extreme Jeffersonian.*\n\nGen. John Clark. At the close of the war for independ ence, John Clark with the prestige of\n\nhis gallant record as a. soldier, became a dominant figure in the politics of 'Upper G-eorgia. When only fourteen years of age, he had fought by his father's side at Kettle Creek and later had won military renow7n by his cam paigns and forays against the Indians. The battle of Jack's Creek was so called in honor of John Clark whose nickname among\" his inti?nate friends and comrades of the army was \"Jack.\" Trained in the exercise of arms, it is not strange that he should have 'carried his charac teristics as a fighter into the arena of politics; nor is it strange that\"the veterans who followed his distinguished father and who knew John Clark himself in the perilous days of battle should have remained his loyal supporters to the very last.\n\nThough not an educated man, at least in the academic sense, lie was a ma,n of strong intellect, rugged in char acter, somewhat blunt of expression, full of bold initiative, and with a rare capacity for leadership. According to G-OV. Gilmer, he possessed the temper of the clansman and was domineering and dictatorial; but Gov. Gilmer wT as identified wdth the Crawford faction, few of whom could discover any virtue in John Clark. Gen. Jackson, in the lower part of the State, was for years a stumbling-\n\n*W. II. Meigs: Life of Josiah Meigs, p. 92.\n\nUNDEK TJJE CODR DTJBLLO\n\n15\n\nblock in the way of dark's ambition, for the old Gov ernor did not approve of the latter's land speculations.\n\nBut ill the politics of Upper Georgia, John Clark was an imperious figure. Here he was on his native heath; and here the frontiersmen flocked to his standard like the Hig-liland elans to the horn of Ehodorick Dhu. Here as a leader whose word was law and gospel, he exercised an unopposed sway unti] a new star beg'aii to loom upon the horizon just north of Augusta and a new political Warwick arose to divide with him the honors of public life, in the person of his future hated rival, William H. Crawford.\n\nWilliam H. Mr. Crawford was a man of Titanic proporCrawford. tions. At the Court of France, in after\n\nyears, his majestic figure caught the admir ation of the great Napoleon who impulsively declared that Mr. Crawford was the only man to whom lie- ever felt constrained to how. Better educated than John Clark, he was a man of unusual culture for the times, a most effective public speaker, and a born leader of men. These qualities eventually made him United States Sen ator, Minister to France, Secretary of the Treasury, and, except for an unfortunate stroke of paralysis, might have placed him in the Presidential chair of the nation.\n\nThe settlers of Upper Georgia were at this time, in the main, either from Virginia or from North Carolina; and, according to ancestral bias, took sides in the politi cal wrangles of this early period. As a rule, the North Caroliniaiis attached themselves to Clark, while the Vir ginians allied themselves with Crawford, who likewise derived strong support from the aristocratic families of the Georgia coast. The elimination of Crawford became naturally the first strategic move of the Clark faction ; and to accomplish this end a duel offered the most con venient instrument and promised the most effective\n\nresults. Mr. Crawford, nnlike Gen. Clark, possessed little\n\n16\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMOBIAT^S AND LEGTCSSTDS\n\nknowledge of the use of arms. He was not a child of\n\nthe camp. For this reason, his opponents argned that lie would, in all likelihood, decline a challenge to the field of combat. In. fact, such, a refusal to fight \"was ex actly \"what his enemies \"wanted, since they could then\n\npost him as a coward and easily accomplish his political undoing.\n\nCrawford and To put into effect this proposed plan of\n\nVan Alien.\n\nstrategy, the first champion to repre\n\nsent the Clark faction and to test the met\n\ntle of \"Mr. Crawford's arm was a young- Klbertoii lawyer :\n\nPeter Lawrence \"Van Alien. Mr. Van Alien \"was by birth\n\na New Yorker. He came of an old Dutch family of the\n\nEmpire State and, on the authority of tradition, was a,\n\nkinsman by marriag'e to Martin Van Bureu, the sage of\n\n'Kinderhook. Locating' In Georgia for the practice of\n\nlaw, lie identified himself with the Clark faction and be\n\ncame Solicitor-General of the \"Western Circuit. He \"was\n\nalso a Yazooist and a Federalist. Van Alien was a good\n\nspeaker, \"witty and eloquent, and early iii the year 1800\n\nbeg'an hostile tactics against the opposite faction by\n\nbringing a petty suit against Judge Charles Tait, of El-\n\nbcrton, who was then Mr. Crawford's law partner and\n\nmost intimate friend. In his speech to the jury, \"Van Al\n\nien assailed Judge Tait with merciless satire, and natur\n\nally the effect- of this tirade was to nettle Judge Tait,\n\nwho finally olialleng-cd him to fight.\n\nBut Judge Tait was not the game for which Van Alien\n\nwas hunting; and on the ground that the judge was not\n\na gentleman and, therefore, beyond the pale of the Code,\n\nhe refused to meet him, expecting Mr. Crawford, of\n\ncourse, as Judge Tait's second, to take up the g'ag'e of\n\nbattle and to carry on hostilities. However, Mr. Craw\n\nford was loath to step into hJs principal's shoes, since\n\nthe quarrel was not one of his own seeking; and on this\n\naccount he exposed himself to animadversion, incurring-\n\nthe well-meant criticism of many of his own faction.\n\nUNDER THE CODE DUELT.O\n\n17\n\nBut circumstances soon goaded lilin into a change of mind. While stopping- at the Willis Hotel, in \"Washing ton, Ga., ho chanced in an unexpected manner to encoun ter Van Alien, who grossly insulted him in the lobby of the hotel and challenged him to fight. According* to the imperious standard of the times, there was no alternative for Mr. Crawford; and, rather than jeopardize his polit ical fortunes by exposing himself to the charge of cow\n\nardice, he agreed to meet his antagonist. As to what followed, we quote an account of the duel\n\nfrom a well-known historical writer: \"It was arranged that Van Alien and. Crawford should meet at Fort Char lotte, the famous old duelling ground, twelve miles below Petersburg, on the Carolina side. Crawford's bravery was not without stoicism, for he went to the place of meeting without the slightest preparation. He had bor rowed a pair of old pistols to be used by him, and these he did not examine until the morning of the meeting, and in trying them, they snapped twice. On the first fire nei ther party was touched. Crawford afterwards stated to Judge Garnctt Andrews that he was disconcerted on the first fire by an ug'Iy grimace made by Van Alien, and that on tlie second fire he drew down his hat brim so that lie could not see it. On the second round both combat ants again fired, and Van. Alien was seen to fall mor tally wounded. Crawford was unharmed.\"*\n\nCrawford\n\nTwo years elapsed before Mr. Crawford was\n\nand Clark. ag.ain asked to vindicate his courage on the\n\nfield of honor. This time it was John Clark\n\nhimself who stepped into the lime-light and became one\n\nof the principals. On the resignation of Judge Thomas\n\nP. Carries from the judgeship of the Western Ci rcuit,\n\nJudg'e Griffin, a brother-in-law of Gen. Clark both having\n\nmarried daugiitcrs of Col. Micajah Williamson received\n\nfrom Gov. John Milledgc an ad interim appointment to\n\n*Shipp: Life of Crawford, p. 49.\n\n18\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND TJKGENDS\n\nthe vacant scat. When the regular election \"was held by the State Legislature some time later, Judg'c Tait, a member of the Crawford faction, successfully opposed Judge Griffin for this office, though Judg-e G-riffin was un questionably a fine lawyer and a man of blameless rep utation. Thereupon an acrimonious controversy ensued between Gen. Clark and Mr. Crawford, growing out of the issues of the campaign.\n\nSmarting- from the defeat of his candidate, Gen. Clark called Mr. Crawford to task for certain pre-election state ments made by him to the effect that he, Gen. Clark, had influenced the grand juries of certain counties to recom mend his brother-in-law. This brought forth a reply from. Mr. Crawford. With pens dipped in vitriol both men indited bitter diatribes and branded each other with harsh epithets until finally Mr. Crawford, exasperated beyond control, challenged Gen. Clark to a duel, which challenge was, of course, promptly accepted by the im petuous old \"warrior.\n\nCol. Thomas Flouraoy, acting as second to Mr. Craw ford, and Capt. Ilowell Cobb, serving' in a, like capacity for Gen. Clark, arranged the details for the hostile cncounter. As the place of meeting, a secluded spot was chosen on the Carolina side of the Savannah Kiver, just below historic old Petersburg and some eleven miles from where Van Alien, two years previous, fell before Mr. Crawford's deadly fire. But the duel was never fought. At this sta^e of the proceedings, a number of disinterested friends besought Gov. Millcdge to inter vene, urging\" the value to the State of both men, whose deadly intent portended fatal results.\n\nWith much difficulty, Gov. MrHedg-e obtained the con sent of both principals to the appointment of a board of arbitration, charged with, adjusting the difficulties be tween them. Each belligerent was given the right to choose two friends to represent him, and these in turn selected a fifth arbitrator who was really to hold in his hands the balance of power. Jared Irwin, Abraham\n\nUNDER THE CODE DTTEL/LO\n\n19\n\nI Jackson, James Seagrove, David ~B. Mitchell, and J. Ben Maxwell constituted this court of appeals ; and, on De cember 12, 1804, a plan of arbitration was submitted, to which both parties\", without loss of prestige, yielded\n\nassent.\n\nAnother Issue But the hatchet was only temporarily bur-\n\nArises,\n\nied. The smoldering fires of hostility\n\nbegan to ]eap into renewed flame ere the\n\nink was dry upon the paper which both signed in appar\n\nently good faith. Still, more than a year elapsed before\n\nmatters reached anything like a crisis. On Feb. 24-, 180G,\n\nJosiah. Glass, a North Car oilman, appeared upon the\n\nscene in Georgia with a warrant for one .Robert Clary,\n\ncharged \"with the offence of stealing' a negro. Judge Tait,\n\njn his capacity as a judge, was called upon to endorse\n\nthis \"warrant, which lie readily did as a matter of form,\n\nexpecting a trial of the case to establish the facts.\n\nIn a few days thereafter, while on the Bench, he re\n\nceived a note from Glass in which the latter stated that\n\nClary was ready to make an affidavit in which there\n\nwould be some startling revelations. After tea, on the\n\nevening of this particular day, Judge Tait, taking with\n\nhim a Mr. Oliver Skinner, repaired to the room \"where\n\nClary \"was held a prisoner in charge of Glass. Thereupon\n\nfollowed a long confession in \"which statements were in\n\ncidentally made involving Gen. John Clark, who it ap\n\npears from this affidavit was charged with a land trans\n\naction for which the money paid in exchange was coun\n\nterfeit.\n\nJudge Tait attached no importance to this affidavit,\n\nfor the deponent's character was such that he could\n\nnot be trusted ; and \"while he \"was none too friendly with\n\nGen. Clark, lie was above listening to a slanderous story\n\nin the mouth of a low criminal; so he informed Glass\n\nthat the matter would not be prosecuted and need not\n\nbo made public.\n\n20 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS ANT> LEGENDS\n\nBut Glass nevertheless took a copy of the affidavit which, in some mysterious way, fell into the hands of Gren. Clark. The latter on ascertaining- that the affidavit was taken at night, immediately jumped to the conclusion tnat a foul conspiracy was on foot to \"wreck him and that, back of this dark proceeding\", was his arch-enemy, William H. Crawford.\n\nPassion often beclouds the truth. As a matter of fact, Clary \"was an unprincipled fellow^ \"who, knowing1 tlie differences between Clark and Crawford, sought to help his own case, wdiile under arrest, by trumping up a charge against den. Clark; but Judge Tait was too just a man to give ear to what was manifestly a mali cious fabrication.\n\nClark Appeals to Contrary to the General's past record, the Legislature. and at variance with his \"well-known\n\nfiery disposition, instead of inviting Judge Tait to meet him on the field of honor, Tic strangely enough presented a memorial to the State Legislature, asking for Judge Tait's impeachment. At this time, Mr. Crawford w.as a member of the House from Ogiethorpe, and naturally he espoused Judge Tait's cause. As chair man of the special investigating committee, he submitted a report to tbe Ftouse, in which Judge Tait's g'ood name was upheld, with the further statement that no evidence could be found on \"which, to base an impeachment. This report was supported by Mr. Crawford in an eloquent speech upon the floor. Ilis powers of logic, of sarcasm, and of invective, were never heard to better advantage; and, when a call of the roll was taken, on the adoption of the committee's report, there were only three votes cast in opposition, to fifty-seven, in favor of exonerating\n\nJudge Tait. Thus the matter ended. Gen. Clark was willing to\n\nlet Judge Tait escape now that larger game was in sight; and, taking- offence at Mr. Crawford's partisan activities in Judge Tait's behalf, and especially at his speech be-\n\nI\n\nUNDER THE COD*; DUETTO\n\n21\n\nfore the House, he sent him a challeng'e through liis friend, John I'orsyth. Mr. Crawford yielded compliance to this demand for satisfaction and selected George Moore to arrange the details for the meeting. On account of engagements in the federal Court, John Forsyth was prevented from acting as Gen. dark's second, whereupon the latter chose Gilbert Hay, of Washington, Ga., to fill this post.\n\nDuelling Ground High Shoals, on the Appalachee Biver, at High Shoals. in what was then Indian Territory, was\n\nthe ^ite selected for the proposed en counter. Near the scene of this hostile meeting, three counties to-day converge, viz., Walton, Morgan and Oconee. Before the duel took place, a code of rules was agreed upon by the seconds; and, on account of the light which these rules will serve to throw upon the history of the times, especially in showing how affairs of honor were conducted after the arrival of the combatants upon the scene of action, they are herewith reproduced in full, for the better inCornuition of those interested:\n\nof the pisto\n\nright the\n\n22 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nArt. 32.

In the meantime, Mr. Crawford, keyed for combat, became restless and impa tient. To quote his biographer, \"he was temperament ally unfitted for a duellist,\" while dark, on the other band, \"was a practiced fighter, thoroughly skilled in the use of weapons, and equally courageous.\" Quoting still further, from this same authority, \"The result was what might have been anticipated. Crawford swaggered, to the peg1 with the same degree of carelessness that he \"was wont to exhibit when addressing a jury in Oglethorpe. His left arm \"was forgotten and heedlessly held unprotected by his body in a way to catch the ball of the rawest duellist. At the first fire, Clark was un touched and Crawford's left wrist was shattered and the bones crushed rn a way to cause him many weeks of ex cruciating pain. Clark was not satisfied and insisted that the shots be continued; but George Moore declined to allow his principal to proceed further, the terms of the agreement having been fully met.\"*\n\nHumor of\n\nWith this decision the affair ended. !But\n\nan Irishman.

Mr. Crawford could\n\nnow decline to meet him? without incurring adverse crit\n\nicism or hazarding his reputation as a man of courage.\n\n*Shipp: Life of Crawford, p. 73\n\nUNDER THE CODE DUELLO\n\n23\n\nBut the partisan warfare still continued between the loyal followers of the two men and, as time \"went on, the feudal inheritance \"was transmitted from sire to son, with solemn abjuration. Georgia \"was divided into two hostile camps; and even churches, \"while preaching a gospel of forgiveness, insisted upon a sharp line of di vision. Perhaps an amusing anecdote will illustrate the\n\ntemper of the times : \"To introduce the subject of politics in any promis\n\ncuous gathering was to promote a quarrel. A son of Erin, lately from Limerick, opened a bar-room in a vil lage in Greene County, Ga. He endeavored by strenu ous neutrality, to catch the trade of both parties. After a week's trial, he gave it up in disgust. When describing this experience he said: 'As soon as a Crawford man would come in, he would at once inquire if this was a Crawford bar; and, faith, when I told him it was naither, he cursed me for a Clarkite and refused to drink. When a Clark man came in and I told him I was naither, he cursed me for a Crawfordite, and I sold not a gill to anyone. Faith, it pays to be a politician in Georgia.' \"*\n\nAfter Judge Tait Though Gen. Clark did not call Judge With a Cow-Hide. Tait to the field of honor, as a result\n\nof the alleged conspiracy for which he sought his impeachment 'by the Legislature, he did visit him in a most spectacular manner and in a most literal sense, \"with the marks of his displeasure. The story is thus told :\n\nOne day, in the summer of 1807, when Judge Tait, then an occupant of the Superior Court Bench, was driving along Jefferson Street, in Milledgeville, Gen. Clark came up, gracefully cantering on a handsome sorrel. The Gen eral always rode a fine horse, \"with best accoutrements, and rarely failed to make an impression. Whatever else might be said of him, John Clark was a born soldier,\n\n*SMpp: Lifo of Crawford, p.\n\n24\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nand tie appeared to special advantage- on horse-back. Biding up to Judge Tait, be engaged liim in a brief con versation :\n\n\"This is the first time I have seen you, sir,\" began Gen. Clark, ''at least since your hasty departure from Louisville.\"\n\n\"Yos,\" replied the Judge, \"I have not seen yon since then.\"\n\n\"Tait,\" resumed the General, 'after a moment's pause, \"under the eloak of judicial authority, you have sought to destroy my reputation, and for your infamous attempt to do so 1 shall give you the lash.\"\n\nThereupon, before any reply could be made, General Clark came down with his riding whip upon the shoul ders of the jurist, inflicting severe blows upon him with the aid of powerful muscles. On account of his wooden leg, Judge Tait was no match for his irate antagonist. While the interview was in progress, Tail's horse took fright, but Clark kept along side of him until his wrath was appeased.\n\nFor this attack upon a Judge of the Superior Court, Gen. Clark was duly prosecuted and, on conviction, was sentenced by Judge Early to pay a fine of $2,000 and to give security for his good behavior for a period of five years. However, this sentence was never put into effect. Governor Jared Irwin, an old comrade-in-arms, feeling that Gen. Clark was an injured man, afterwards issued an executive order remitting the fine imposed upon him by Judge Karly and furthermore releasing the old soldier from any and all other legal consequences attached to his rash conduct. As for Judge Tait, he af terwards became a United States Senator, but eventu ally removed to Alabama where he spent his last days.\n\nJudge Dooly's When T?cter Van Alien foil at Fort (Jbnr-\n\nBee-Chim.\n\n]otte, before Mr. Crawford's fire, the so-\n\nlicitorship of the Western Circuit, made\n\nvacant by his death, was conferred ^by appointment upon\n\nTTNT>\"RR TTTE CODE DuTCT-J^O\n\n25\n\n.a gentleman noted in the annals of Georgia for his Attic salt: Hon. John M. Dooly. Judge Dtooly was afterwards elevated to the Bench, from which circumstance arose the title by which he was universally known. \"He was easily the greatest wit of his day in Georgia, a master of satire and as quick at repartee as chained lightning. Public speakers seldom, if ever, engaged with him in joint debate, for prudential reasons. Crowds throng*ed his court-room whenever' lie appeared on the circuit; and if Charles Dickens could only have met this unique char acter, he might have improved, upon the drolleries of Pickwick.\n\nOn a. certain occasion, when this same feud between Clark and Crawford was still alive, Judge \"Dooly became involved in a controversy with his predecessor upon the Bench: Judge Charles Tait. As a result Judge Tait challenged him to mortal combat. There are several ver sions to this story, but, according' to one of them, Judge D'ooly accepted the challenge arid actually appeared upon the scene of encounter, though lie \"was notoriously op posed to shedding blood, especially from his own veins.\n\nGen. Clark was Judge Dooly's second, \"while Mr. Crawford, in a like capacity, served Judge Tait; and the af fair was probably planned with the utmost seriousness by the friends of both parties. Now, it happened that one of Judg'e Tait's bodily infirmities \"was a wooden leg, and it was a knowledge of this fact \"which inspired Judge Z>ooly's singular feat of valor. At the appointed time, Judge Tait, with his second, Mr. Crawford, appeared upon the scene of \"action, where lie discovered Judge Dooly sitting patiently alone upon a stump. In reply to an inquiry from Mr. Crawford, concerning' the \"where abouts of Gen. Clark, with \"whom he wished to confer in advance of the duel, Judge Dooly replied:\n\n\"Gen. Clark is in the woods looking for a bee-gum.\"\n\n\"May I inquire,\" asked Mr. Crawford, \"what use he intends to make of a bee-gum7\"\n\n\"I want to pnt my leg in it,\" replied Judge Dooly.\n\n26\n\nGEORGIA'S IJA-NDMARKS, MEMORIALS A~ND TJKGENDS\n\n\"Do you suppose for a minute that I am going to risk a good leg of flesh, and blood against Tait's wooden stump? If I hit his leg, he can get him another one before tomor row morning; but if he hits mine I may lose my life, cer tainly my leg; and to put myself on equal footing with Tait, I must have a bee-gum for protection. I can then fight him on equal terms.''\n\n\"Then am I to understand that you do not intend to fight Judge Tait?\", inquired Mr. Crawford.\n\n\"Well,\" responded Judge Dooly, \"I thoug'ht every one knew that.''\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Mr. Crawford, \"but you will fill a newspaper column in consequence of this day's business.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" replied the Judge, with an arch smile, \"I would rather fill a dozen newspapers than one coffin.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to be said. Judge Tait was, of course, chagrined at this unexpected turn of affairs. He expected to humiliate Judge Dooly, even if he could not force him to fight; but Jndg-e Dooly had cleverly man aged the situation and, without putting his good legs in jeopardy, had come off the victor. Gallant Jack Falstaff himself could not have managed the affair with keener strategy or with cooler discretion.\n\nDuelling- Forbidden Prior to December 12, 1809, there was\n\nBy Statute.\n\nno law on the statute books of Geor\n\ngia forbidding the practice of duel\n\nling, though it was customary for belligerents to cross\n\nthe State lines, to avoid indictment on the general charge\n\nof murder, in the event of fatal consequences. But the\n\nfrequency of such affairs, involving men of the highest\n\nintellectual type and of the greatest public usefulness,\n\neventually produced a revulsion of sentiment. The kill\n\ning of Alexander Hamilton by Aaron Burr, perhaps more\n\nthan any other event, served to call nation-wide atten\n\ntion to the imperative need of reform in this direction.\n\nTIT.R (\"ODE DUELLO\n\nIt \\s hardly an exaggeration to say that not less than a thousand duels were fought in Georgia in consequence of this feudal enmity between Clark and Crawford; and there were few households in the State which were not bereaved, either directly or indirectly, by the countless sacrifices which were made during this period to ap pease the demands of this bloody Moloch.\n\nConsequently, on December 12, 1809, Gov. David -B. Mitchel] signed a measure, passed by the 'General Assem bly of Georgia, making it unlawful either to extend or to accept a challenge, or to be concerned in any way therein, either as principals or as seconds; and on con viction the offender was to be excluded from the right to hold any office of trust, honor, or emolument in this State.* Gov. David 13. Mitchell, whose signature as Chief-Magistrate was attached to this measure, him self figured on one occasion in an affair of honor.\n\nIt was well enough to have such a law upon the stat ute-books, in deference to humane public opinion. But for years it was practically a dead-letter; and, to procure an acquittal from an average jury it was orily necessary to show that the duel was fought in a decorous manner, according to the strict ethics of the Code of Honor. Here the law stopped. It required something more than a leg islative enactment to uproot the traditions of chivalry in a land of Cavaliers.\n\nGeneral Floyd's Duel Perhaps the most famous of GeorWith Three Weapons gia's Indian fighters was General\n\nJohn Floyd, who \"won renown on the frontier during the war of 1812. Skilled in the exercise of arms, there wTas scarcely any sort of weapon, from a shot-gun to a bowie-knife, with whose effective use he was not familiar; nor was it solely with Indian warriors that this seasoned old regular engaged in hand-to-hand encounters. Down in Cam den County, Ga., where Gen.\n\n28\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LF.GKNDS\n\nFloyd spent most of liis life and wlioro lie lies buried on one of liis plantations, tradition credits him with having fought what in some respects was the most extraordinary duel of which there is any record in the 'bloody chronicles of the Code.\n\nHis antagonist, a Mr. Hopkins, was equally skilled in the nse of weapons, and equally fearless. It was Greek against Greek. As the challenged party, Mr. Hopkins claimed the right to choose' wen/pons ; but, instead of sat isfying himself with one kind, he' chose three a most radical departure from the venerated traditions. To settle the grievance between them it was agreed to fire a round with shot-guns, at a certain sj)eciiicd distance. In the event neither was killed or disabled in this ex change of shots, they were to approach several feet near er with drawn pistols, and if both remained on foot after this second fire, they were to end the affair in a hand-tohand grapple with bowie-knives, fighting- till one or both should fall mortally wounded.\n\nOn both sides, this program was commenced in deadly earnest. -But Gen. Floyd's antagonist, in either the first or second round was so effectually disabled by loss of blood that resort to bowie-knives as a finality was aban doned. The incident suffices to show Gen. Fl'oyd's grim hardihood as a fighter. His characteristics in this respeot were transmitted to his son, Gen. Charles Ij. Fioyd, and to his grandson, Capt. Kichard S. Floyd, both of whom are 'credited with affairs of honor. Hon. Wni. G. McAdoo, the present (listing-mailed Secretary of the Treasury in President Wilson's Cabinet, and the hitter's son-in-law, is a lineal descendant of Gen. Floycl ; and, \"while ho has not emulated the prowess of his ancestor as a duellist, he has turned the fighting spirit of his family into industrial channels, with the result that he is to-day credited with one' of the g-reatest achievements of modern times : the construction of the Hudson River tunnels.\n\nUNDER THIS CODE DUELLO\n\n29\n\nGrim Relic Owned Hon. Eb. T. Williams, of Atlanta, a by Col, Williams. distinguished member of the Georgia\n\nliar, owns a duelling-pistol which fignred in oiie of tlic most dramatic episodes of Georgia's history prior to the Civil War. It is an old flint-and-steel weapon, made by Man.ton and Son. of London, famous in an earlier day for the manufacture of fire-arms used on. the field of honor. The barrel is one of very large bore, inlaid with platinum and encircled by silver bands. The device for sighting- is also of silver, while the powder pan is covered with a layer of platinum. From end to end, the pistol measures some eighteen inches in length. It is handsomely engraved, and when fresh from the lab oratory of Mantoii and Son, must .have been a \"work of art. The pistol, was pur chased by Col. Williams years ago from an old locksmith of Augusta, by the name of Bogers.*\n\nDuel Between According to legendary accounts, this\n\nGumming\n\ngrim relic of duelling days in Georgia fig-\n\nand McDuffie. ured iii more than one tragic encounter;\n\nbut the affair of honor to which its rust-\n\ncovered, cylinder unmistakably points, after a lapse of\n\nnearly one hundred years, \"was a duel which occurred\n\nat Sister's Ferry, on June 8, 1822, between Col. William\n\nCumming, of A.ugusta, and Hon. George1 McDuffie, of\n\nSouth Carolina, the latter of whom afterwards became\n\nGovernor of the Palmetto State and United States Sen\n\nator.

Army, by President Polk, but declined this appointment also, main ly, no doubt, on account of his age, which was then about sixty,\n\nIt is difficult to vouch for the circumstances at this late clay; but as gleaned from newspaper accounts the duel originated in. this wise:* An article, without signa ture, appeared in one of the Augusta papers, supporting the claims of Mr. Crawford against those of Mr. Calhonn for President of the United States. This article provoked a salty reply from a gentleman of South Carolina, whose name was likewise undisclosed. The Georgia writer re joined on the assumption that the South Carolina writer was Mr. Mcl^uffie, which gentleman nettled by the strict ures therein contained replied in the 'belief that his op ponent ^vas Col. Crimming, a gentleman whose pen was famous in the controversies of his time.\n\n!Both men were mistaken. The affair proved to be a comedy of errors. !But no explanation was made on either side and subsequent developments led to a chal lenge, which was promptly accepted. It is understood that a proposition to which Mr. M'cDuffie gave assent but to which Col. Gumming demurred was made by mutual friends in the hope of a satisfactory adjustment; and, this effort failing, the1 details of the meeting were ar ranged :ly seconds after the usual custom.\n\nAccording to newspaper accounts, Col. Gumming wished to fight in round-jackets or shirt-sleeves; but his antagonist sug'gested the conventional frock coat. This dress was accepted. At the appointed hour, Gol. Gum ming appeared upon the field in a suit of cotton; Mr. MeDuffie came attired in silk. The combatants, facing each other at a distance of ten paces, exchanged shots. MeUuffie's ball struck the ground about four paces from his own feet, while the bullet of his antagonist entered the\n\nUNDER TTTE Conn DTJKLT.JO\n\n31\n\nformer's back obliquely just below the sliort ribs and de flected. Only one round was fired, tlie surgeons agreeing' that Mr. McDuffie was too severely wounded to continue the hostile interview.\n\nThis wound eventually caused the groat orator's death. A a a reason why the bullet did not penetrate deeper, the Augusta Chronicle, some time afterwards, in giving- a purported authentic account of the affair, made this statement: \"Cumming's bullet was loaded for the side, not for the back; and for the resistance of common drapery, not for several folds of strong silk.\"* On the authority of Judge John B. O'Neill, in his \"Bench and Bar of South Carolina,\" the wound received by Mr. McDuJue in this duel changed his entire disposition, embit tered his life, and sent him a wreck to his tomb.\n\nMr. Forsyth John Forsyth was one of the ablest men Wounded \"by a of his day in the arena of national politics.

As an orator, he was superior, in the judgment of many, even to Judge Berrien, our American Cicero, with whom, in the famous Tariff Convention of 1833, he engag'ed in a grapple of argument lasting' for three days.

One of the most distinguished of 'Georgia's ante-bellum physicians\n\nwas Dr. Ambrose Baber; and there were few men in the State before the war who possessed a \"wider circle of friends or left a profouuder impress upon public affairs.

Mitchell was allied with the Clark faction in politics and at the time of the\" duel was the newly elected Solicitor-General, of the Southern Circuit. He was a na tive of Lanrcns District, S. C., but studied law at Eatonton, Ga., under Judge .Kli S. Shorter, after winch he settled at Hartford, da., to practice his profession. Major Bcall was residing- at this time in Talbotton, G-a., but af terwards removed to Macon, \"where ho became the first mayor of the young' town. At a later period in his life he also held a Brjgvndier-Geiieral's commission in the State militia.\n\nThe difficulty between the two men g*rew out of a triv ial remark made by Col. MitcheTl at the dinner table of a friend, to which remark Major Beall took exception. As a result there sprang- up between these gentlemen a quarrel which proved to be so persistent that a resort to weapons offered the only sane solution and accordingly they ag'recd to adjust matters between them by fig'hting1 a duel at Hamburg-, S. C., just opposite the city of Au gusta. Capt. Joseph Morgan, second for Major Beall, and Mr. John P. Booth, second for Col. Mitchell, arranged the details. Two rounds were fired without effect, after which, mutual friends, a number of whom were present, intervened, to prevent further hostilities. The courage of both men having- been attested, a reconciliation was effected and the combatants .shook hands on the field.\n\nDuel With\n\nTin fortunately, some comment np-\n\nThomas D. Mitchell. on the duel made by Dr. Baber, who\n\nattended as surg'eon to Major Bcall\n\nat Hamburg, S. C., was resented by Col. Mitchell. The\n\nlatter subsequently published a card which gave offence\n\nto Dr. Baber, who, after a brief controversy on the sub\n\nject, demanded of Col. Mitchell the satisfaction due a\n\ngentleman under the Code. The challenge was accepted,\n\nand rifles, at a distance of ten paces, were selected as the\n\nweapons. In the spring of 1826, the parties met at Ham-\n\n34 GEORGIA'S LAXBMARKS, MKMOKIAI.S AND LEGF.NDS\n\nburg, S. C., tlie scene of the former duel; and, on the sec ond fire, Col.

Isaac W. ifitchell, a brother of the deceased, was present at the duel, acting' in the capacity of surgeon, and attended upon the dying- man in his last moments. It was a sad duty to perform, but tlie ordeal was soon over, arid there were no pangs of lingering- distress, thanks to the deadly work of the bullet. Dr. Mitchell was a life-long resident of Thomas County, Ga., where he amassed a large property and died well advanced in years. Col. Mitchell, at the time of his death, was still a young rfiMii, aged thirty-three, and tinmarricd. Exceptionally well-equipped for his profession, he was a man of splen did talents, but sensitive' to a fault and inclined to be somewhat rash and dictatorial, especially when aroused by aYig'er.\n\nTragic Death Dr. Baber survived his hostile encounter of Dr. Baber. with Col. Mitchell by twenty years and\n\nwas still in the prime of life 'when he came to his death in a most tragic and sudden manner. As narrated by .Judge Kichard H. Clark, the circumstances are these: Among the patients of Dr. Baber was a man with consumption, named Jarrell, in East Macon. On Saturday the doctor made for him a prescription which contained cyanuret of potassium. This drug consists largely of the elements of prussic acid, and if taken in too large a dose is a deadly poison. The prescription was put iip by George Payne, then nnd now, a prominent drug gist of Macon and a most excellent man. Detecting the mistake, Mr. Payne, nevertheless, filled the prescription, but tied it to the valve and wrote the patient not to take it, that it was a killing dose, and to show the prescription, witli his note, to Dr. Baber, when he arrived. The next morning early Dr. P>abcr made his accustomed visit and wa.s disappointed and irritated that his patient had not\n\ntaken the1 medicine the clay before, as lie directed. The dose was a teaspoonful.\n\n\"To satisfy you there is no danger In it.** said the doc tor to tlie patient, on the impulse of the moment, \"I will take a double dose.\"\n\nSuiting the action to the word, lie swallowed two teaspoonsful, staggered to a chair, and in seventeen min utes, drew his last breath. The mistake was due to a misprint in the formulary used by Dr. Babe?. After wards, due to the notoriety which this affair attained, the entire edition was celled in and destroyed by the publish er, but no amends could restore the life of one of the most useful public men of the State. The excitement which prevailed throughout the city of Macon on the fatal Sunday morning which witnessed this tragic occurrence was most intense. It was Macon's dark Sabbath.\n\nCrawford On January 25, 1828, at Fort Mitchell, in\n\nand\n\nthe Greek Nation,'on what is now the Ala-\n\nBurnside. hama side of the Gliattahoocliee Kiver, just\n\nbeJow the present city of Colnmibus, occur\n\nred the famous duel between George W. Crawford and\n\nThomas E. Burnsidc. Both principals were then talented\n\nyoung lawyers, residing at Appling, in Columbia County,\n\nG-a. The former was a kinsman of the renowned William\n\nH\\ Crawford and was himself destined to 'become scarcely\n\nless distinguished in the political history of Georgia. He\n\nserved his State as Governor and held the portfolio of\n\nSecretary of War in the cabinet of Gen. Taylor, after\n\nwhich he presided over the historic Secession Convention,\n\nat Millcdgeville, in 1861. As a lawyer, he encountered few\n\nequals at the Bar; and for his services in prosecuting\n\nthe celebrated Galpbin claim against the United States\n\ngovernment, lie received a fee of $80,000.\n\nBurnside, who was fated to fall in this encounter on\n\nthe threshold of what promised to be a brilliant career\n\nin public life, was an uncle of the noted Federal comman-\n\n36 GEORGIA'S LAKDMAK.KS, MEMORIALS AND LKGENDS\n\ncler Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, afterwards Governor of Rhode Island and United States Senator.\n\nThe duel between Crawford and Hum side grow out of a newspaper article published, without signature, in one of the Augusta papers, criticizing Hon. Petor Crawford, a Whig. Peter Crawford was for years prominent in Georgia politics and was at this time- in very poor health. George \"W. Crawford, incensed at this attack upon his father by an unknown \"writer, demanded the authorship of this offensive card. But the editor de clined to disclose the writer's name. Col. I). W. Jjewis, who \"was afterwards Gov. Gilmer's private secretary, says that the writer of the article in question was a lady and that it was for this reason that Mr. Crawford's de mand was refused.\n\nHowever, Thomas K. Burn side assumed responsibil ity for the article, whereupon he promptly received a challenge from George \"W. Crawford to mortal combat. Ue seems to have been reluctant to fight, but at a time when the Code Duello \"was in vogue, he well knew the consequences to himself and to his political fortunes, should he refuse to meet his antagonist on the field. Pie, therefore, accepted the challenge and repaired at once to the scene of combat. But, on the night before the fatal meeting perhaps with some premonition of the result in mind. he dispatched the following note to Mrs. Burnside:\n\nPort Mitchcll, Jan. 24, 18^8.\n\nBear Wife and Mother:\n\nTomorrow I fight. I do it on principle. \"Whatever may bo my fate,\n\n1 believe I am right.

Thomas E. Burnside fell mortally wounded in the encounter which followed. His body was interred, with every show of respect, in the private burial ground of Col. Growell, whose residence was not far from the spot on which the unfortunate man fell. More than two ^veeks elapsed before Burnside's family received the sad news, which, when it finally came, after so long a period of suspense, almost cost Airs. Burnside her life; but she rallied her strength for the sake of her children and af terwards removed to .Dablonega, Ga., where she resided until her death.\n\nBurnside was held in high, esteem by his countless friends and colleagues at the Bar. He was a native of S'outh Carolina,, where he was born in 1794, and after settling at Appling for the practice of law, lie i-cpresented Columbia, County in the General Assembly of Georgia. The late .Judge W. A. Burnside, for years a trustee of the North Georgia Agricultural College, \"was his son. Numerous tributes were paid to Burnside's character, and from these honors it may be inferred that he was a, man \"of splendid parts. At Appling, a mass-meeting- of his personal and political friends was held, over which Tur ner Clanton presided. There was also a meeting of the Bar of his circuit at which resolutions were adopted and a movement launched for erecting a monument.\n\nAccording to Col. W. P. Price, this duel between Burnside and Crawford caused great excitement in Georgia and, more than any other personal conflict, it led the people of this State to make a crusade ag'ainst duelling\" and to demand reform in the method of seeking satisfac tion for aggrieved honor. Gov. Crawford always de plored the unfortunate affair and, clown to the day of his death, expressed the tendercst solicitude for the bereaved widow and children, whoso helpless condition he caused. On more than one occasion it is said that he substantially befriended them, by seeking the help of intermediate parties, withoirt letting his own name be given, and for more than one act of kindness from an unknown friend the family was indebted to George W. Crawford.\n\n38\n\nGKORGT.V'H IjAHOMAifKW, MEMORIALS AND L/KGE^DS\n\nJudge Cone's Assault Alexander IT. Stephens was not an Upon Mr, Stephens, athlete. It is doubtful if the former\n\nConfederate Vice-President ever tipped the scales at more than ninety-six pounds, his exact weight in 1843, when he made his maiden speech in the national House of Representatives. Throughout his long- career in public life, he presented the typical look of an invalid, wan and emaciated. But Mr. Stephens was an utter stranger to the sense of fear, either moral or physical. He was game to the core; arid every ounce of flesh which gripped his spare bones contained as much real pluck as Caesar ever displayed in Gaul.\n\nOn the steps of the old Thompson Hotel, in Atlanta, during the fall of 1848, there occurred an incident which well illustrates the courage of Mr. Stephens. It will also serve to show that lie bore a charmed life. At this time he encountered somewhat unexpectedly Judge Francis H. Cone, of Greensboro, with whom he \"was then on strained terms. Judge Cone had severely criticized Mr. Stephens' for something which the latter had either said or done in 'Congress, and among other choice epithets which the Judge is said to have used was the term \"traitor\".\n\nDifficulties almost immediately ensued. Mr. Stephens probably infuriated Judge Cone by returning his vituper ative adjectives, whereupon Judge Cone, delving under neath his broadcloth, whipped out a. knife \"with which he made a leap toward Mr. Stephens. The latter was doubly at a disadvantage, not only because in avoirdupois he was1 a pigmy beside Judge Cone, but also because he was unarmed, except for an umbrella which, shot out from his left elbow. \"With this somewhat unheroic weapon, Mr. Stephens sought to parry the blow of Judge Cone; but he was soon overpowered by his antagonist and fell bleed ing upon the floor.\n\n\".Retract!\" demanded the irate jurist, who now bent over his prostrate foe.\n\nUNDER THE CODE DUELLO\n\n39\n\n'\"Never!\" replied- Mr. Stephens, tlio blood gurgling from his wounds,, but the proud spirit of the man still unquenchcd. Ag'ai?i the knife descended, severing1 an intercostal artery, but Mr. Stephens still refused to retract. He continued to grapple with his adversary, growing\" momentarily weaker and weaker, until at Jast rescue came from some of the hotel guests who, hastening to the scene of encounter, separated the belligerents. Though Mr. Stephens received the best medical attention, he lay for \"weeks hovering between life and death. Finally he arose from his sick bed to renew his campaign for reelection. !But he never fully regained the use of his right liand which was frightfully lacerated in the struggle; and his penmanship as well as his person bore the marks of the encounter as long as he lived. In justice to Judge Cone, who was one of the ablest lawyers in the State and a man much beloved in his social and domestic relations, it'may be said that he was completely upset by his violent anger and did not perhaps stop to think of the difference in physical strength between himself and Mr. Stephens. They had once been good friends, in spite of professional tilts and rivalries; and later on in life the cordial rela tions of earlier vcars were resumed.\n\nBenjamin H. Hill But this is only an incidental story.\n\nChallenged\n\nThe affair between Mr. Stephens and\n\nby Mr. Stephens. Judge Ooiie could hardly be called a\n\nduel. It was not fought according to\n\nthe ethics of the Code and was a one-sided battle, at least\n\nwith respect to weapons. But there came a time when\n\nMr. Stephens appeared in the role of challenger. It \"was\n\nduring- the presidential campaign of 185G, and the invita\n\ntion to mortal combat grew out of a joint debate between\n\nMr. Stephens and Mr. Hill in the town of Hexing-ton.\n\nThe period was one of transition. Mr. Stephens and Mr.\n\nToombs had both left the old Whig party and had now\n\ncome into the Democratic r;mks; while Mr. Hill stood\n\nsquarely upon the American or Know-nothing platform.\n\n40 GEORGIA'S T-JANIJMAHKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nWith, merciless oratory Mr. Hill pilloried Mr. Stephens on his change of front. Mr. Stephens, in his speech assailed the American candidate for President, characterizing- him as Judas, to which Mr. Hill retorted \"by saying that while Judas did betray his Master for thirty pieces of silver he did not abuse his1 Master after he betrayed Him. There was an implication In this lan guage which Mr. Stephens did not like; but nothing further was said on the subject at tills time, in a joint debate with Mr. Toombs at Washington, the latter was taxed in pretty much the same fashion. It was a novel spectacle to see a youngster like Mr. Hill touch the breast plates of old veterans like Mr. Toornbs and Mr. Stephens ; and stories of Jack the G-iant-rxiller began to circulate up and down the State.\n\nWhat Mr. Tbornbs thought on the subject does not appear, but Mr. Stephens was by no means pleased with the garbled accounts which reached him within the nextfew days, and, putting some vitriol into his ink bottle, he wrote to Mr. Hill for information. Said he in substance: \"I have been informed that in your speeches at Thomson and Augusta you declared that you had charged upon Mr. Toombs and myself that we had betrayed the Whig party and had acted toward it worse than Judas Iscariot, for though he betrayed his Master he did not abuse Him afterward; that you had thundered this in our ears and that we had cowered under your charges. Please let me know if this be true, at least so far as X am concerned.''\n\nTo this letter Mr. Hill replied in substance that he had repeated at Thomson and Augusta exactly what had taken place at Lexington and Washington, no more and no less; that he met argument with argument, sarcasm with sarcasm, and ridicule with ridicule; that he dis claimed any personal ill-will and made shots only at those who built batteries.\n\nMr. Stephens was not satisfied with the terms ill which this reply was couched, and several additional love-letters -were exchanged in which Jndas was the only\n\nUNDER TTTE CODE\n\n41\n\none of the disciples whose name was mentioned; and finally Mr. Stephens, nettled by what he considered an admission of tho rumors with an effort to escape the con sequences,, challenged. Mr. Hill to mortal combat. Tt was quite a predicament in which tho latter was placed. He knew1 tho risk which, he wa.s bound to .Incur, if he declined an invitation. At the same time, he shrank from fighting an invalid. ITc did not wish Mr. Stephens to take his life, nor did he \"wish to take the life of Mr. Stephens. More over, he was anxious to serve his State. Accordingly he declined the challenge; but he gave a summary of his reasons therefor and closed his letter with this para graph : \"While I have never at any time had an insult offered to me nor an aggrcs'sion attempted, I shall yet know how to meet and repel any that may be offered by any gentleman who may presume on this refusal.\"\n\nUnable to obtain satisfaction through this avenue of redress, Mr. Stephens published a card in which he set forth the result of the correspondence and lambasted Mr. Hill with picturesque epithets; but Mr. Hill, who was an adept at the same art, came back 'with his own review of the controversy and \"wound np by giving' as bis last reason for declining a duel with Mr. Stephens his now celebrated rejoinder :\n\n\"I have a family and a conscience; you have neither.\"\n\nMr. Hill Hurls There have been many exaggerated acan Ink Bottle counts of a personal difficulty which ocat Mr. Yancey. curred in 1862 between Benjamin H. Hill\n\nand William L. Yancey on the floor of the Confederate Senate. The dispute grew out of an argument with which Mr. Hill as usual was defending soioe policy of the Davis administration. It may have been on the bill for establishing a Supreme Court. At any rate, an exciting' debate had been in progress for several days and Mr. Yancey had made some severe\n\n42\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nstrictures upon certain executive matters. Indeed, lie had g'one so far as to declare, in the licat of towering1 argument, that Mr. Hill had spoken \"what he knew to be false.\n\nThis was a declaration 'which carried a challenge, and, reaching for a missile with which to repel the charge, he chanced to strike an ink 'bottle upon his desk. Swiftly calculating1 the distance, lie hurled this projectile at Mr. Y.'.mcey, with the force of a catapult and with the aim of a rifleman, striking1 the surprised Senator upon the cheek-bone. He had shown himself an adept in the use of ink-bottles, whether employed in the g'entle art of letters or in the deep-chested and muscular science of pugilism; but he had also nettled the Titan wrath of one of the superb invincibles.\n\nThings looked serious. Mr. Yanccy was1 not a man to brook an affront. -But the possibility of further diffi culties was prevented by the interference of Senators who now rushed between the combatants ; and the doors being' closed the aft'nir was amicably adjusted by med iating i'riends. \"With some difficulty, Mr. YTaucey sup pressed. his1 resentment, feeling that the hot haste in which, Mr. Hill had acted was perhaps natural under the circumstances and that the subject-matter of disagree ment was too trivial to estrange patriots.\n\n!Both subsequently became fast friends. The story that Mr. Van coy's death, which occurred not long after this encounter, was clue to the effect of the blow received from Mr. Hill, is1 only artistic fiction. The wound pro duced an effusion of blood, but it was never regarded as serious, and Mr. Yancey resumed his argument soon after the difficulty occurred. He subsequently died of kidney trouble. Both his brother, Ool. _B. C. Yancey, of Home, and his son, Capt. Goodloe H. Yancey, of Athens, continued to be numbered among Mr. Hill's steadfast friends and supporters.*\n\n*Ben5.
