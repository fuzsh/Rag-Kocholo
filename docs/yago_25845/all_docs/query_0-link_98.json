        "text": "Snippets from Synthetic Collective’s A DIY Fieldguide for Reducing the Environmental Impact of Art Exhibitions and a Reading List\n\n“Centred on the impacts of plastics in our culture and the environment, one of the additional guiding questions of our project Plastic Heart was: can we make an exhibition that is carbon-neutral? This question is deceptively simple because the layers of the exhibition that the viewer sees hide the many steps that go into building the exhibition itself. Where does one begin to tally the environmental impact of an exhibition? Is it in the space itself as the art works and artefacts are assembled? Or is it in the very first steps of the process, which might involve mining for heavy metals and pigments, manufacturing chemicals and products, laying the fibre optic cables that underlie the systems of communication that are key components of exhibition making….”\n\n“We suggest that art museums and exhibitions can provide a model for showcasing how exhibitions can themselves be sites for research into the environmental consequences of materially-based public facing forms of education…. We remain cognizant that any “solutions” must be part and parcel of and contribute to advocacy efforts that extend far beyond the realm of the museum.”\n\n“Museums, especially large ones, tend towards a simultaneous embrace of the new amid a culture of indefinite preservation. In the vast expansion of museum complexes has emerged a fundamentally paradoxical relationship to time, such that the goal of collecting is to arrest time through the twin processes of collection and preservation, while simultaneously museums are charged with either portraying or recreating pasts that should have decayed, thus creating a kind of unnervingly static past-in-the-present. This is true even of the most cutting-edge contemporary art institutions, which nestle a resistance to changing environments and an embrace of unwavering humidity levels at the core of a perception that the content of the gallery is always ahead-of-the-times.”\n\n“[I]mportant advances in protecting and preserving artworks and artefacts have led to the imposition of stringent controls on museum settings, and sophisticated lighting, ventilation, heating, and cooling systems that exact a heavy energy cost. As the climate changes outside in increasingly erratic ways, inside the museum it maintains an artificial constancy that belies the very conditions often depicted or analyzed by many works of eco- or environmental art.”\n\nPlastic Heart: Surface All the Way Through is an experimental exhibition that examines plastic as art material, cultural object, geologic process, petrochemical product, and a synthetic substance fully entangled with the human body. Curated by Synthetic Collective, the exhibition mobilizes practices of institutional critique and proposes an alternative method of exhibition development and presentation that addresses ecology and sustainability in content and form.\n\nSynthetic Collective is an interdisciplinary collaboration between visual artists, scientists, and cultural workers. They work to sample, map, understand, and visualize the complexities of plastics and micro-plastics pollution in the Great Lakes Region. Synthetic Collective is Kelly Jazvac, Kirsty Robertson, Kelly Wood, Patricia Corcoran, Heather Davis, Tegan Moore, Sara Belontz, Lorena Rios Mendoza, Kathleen Hill, and Ian Arturo.\n\nConceptions of White: A Research Toolkit on the Origins and Meanings of White Identity\n\nIn the midst of global and local uprisings against the systemic violence perpetrated upon Black, Indigenous and racialized communities, John Hampton and Lillian O’Brien Davis are sharing some resources from their active research for our joint winter 2022 exhibition Conceptions of White. The exhibition looks at the origins, travel, and present reality of “whiteness” as a concept and racial invention for classifying degrees of humanity and justifying discrimination throughout all our social structures.\n\nThe subjugation of Black, Indigenous and other racialized bodies is a foundational tenet in how the concept and institution of the “White Race” was created. And whilst there has never been any scientific or genetic basis for the category, and where there are no essential characteristics that can be prescribed to white people, one thing has remained constant since its invention. In the North American context, state power (as represented in all its infrastructures and institutions, from the police to healthcare, design of cities and education, art and cultural history) has been—since colonization—consolidated under white leadership and ideologies. If the brutal murder of George Floyd, and the ongoing acts of police violence closer to home, have newly opened many more eyes to the structural devaluing and vilification of Black lives, there continues to be a profound and more insidious violence in systemic racism—blindness, active denial, and blaming the victims.\n\nThe exhibition seeks to make visible the nature of white identity as the norm within North American legal, political, social, and economic models. We are undertaking this project to more fully understand our institutional foundation, and to be able to better recognize the normalized forms and invisibility of white identity in our society. It is also part of a larger project of examining the existential, experiential, and ethical dimensions of our institutional presence and activities, including how we can resist and undo the racist frameworks embedded within our own histories and context in order to help create a more just and inclusive community and culture. It is active, evolving, and ongoing, and we welcome your input and participation.\n\nConceptions of White is curated by John Hampton (Interim Director and CEO, MacKenzie Art Gallery and Adjunct Curator, Art Museum) with Lillian O’Brien Davis (Curatorial Assistant, MacKenzie Art Gallery), along with support from Barbara Fischer (Executive Director and Chief Curator, Art Museum at the University of Toronto). The exhibition is co-produced by the Art Museum at the University of Toronto and the MacKenzie Art Gallery, where it is scheduled to open in Winter and Fall 2022, respectively."
