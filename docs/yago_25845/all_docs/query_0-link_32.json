        "text": "Missouri Humanities’ 6th Annual Humanities Symposium “Roots & Routes of the Ozarks: People & Pathways” was centered around the movement of people into, out of, and within the Ozarks.

Since the 1980s, agricultural industries have attracted growing groups of immigrants from a range of backgrounds including Cuba, Central America, and Mexico. Many have now grown up in the region and are seeking education pathways, but barriers continue to be present especially for women. Our panel discussion talked about the challenges Latinas face in Higher Education from first generation to second generation to third generation.\n\nThis panel received federal support from the Latino Initiatives Pool, administered by the National Museum of the American Latino, and is hosted in partnership with the Smithsonian Folklife Festival with support from the efactory.\n\nThe Panelists and Moderator:\n\nJudith Martinez (Panelist) is an Associate Professor of Spanish Literature, Language, and Culture at Missouri State University, where she has also served as the University Provost Fellow for Diversity and as the Provost Fellow for Faculty Development.

Missouri is the longest and one of the toughest sections of the ride, sometimes called “Misery” by riders because of its hilly terrain.\n\nWe heard from riders featured in the film, along with the president of the Missouri Trail of Tears Association, as we discussed the Remember the Removal Bike Ride, forced removal, and the Trail of Tears.

Resettlement can be a pathway for at-risk people to find safety, equilibrium, and stability after being faced with some of the more harrowing aspects of humanity. In the panel discussion, we explored refugee resettlement in the Ozarks. We looked at the history of refugees in and out of the region–including why and what refugee populations have chosen the Ozarks as their home.

For our closing event, Ozarks Alive’s Kaitlyn McConnell taught about the opportunities to experience the region on a new level through its places and traditions. From annual cultural events to longstanding businesses, we heard how to meaningfully connect with the region and truly experience the “Roots & Routes of the Ozarks”!\n\nHosted in coordination with Ozarks Alive and in partnership with Mother’s Brewing Company.\n\nMeet The Presenter:\n\nKaitlyn McConnell began writing about the Ozarks when she was 17 years old.
