        "text": "Having been awarded the MBE for Services to the Business and Financial Sectors in the West Midlands in January 2022 by HM the late Queen, I finally managed to collect my insignia from Prince William at Windsor Castle. The Investiture was amazing and it’s a day I will cherish for a long time. However, even though I was being honoured, the real honour should go to my both sets of grandparents and my mum and dad. It was the values that they instilled in me that has led to the MBE. Really all 6 of them should have have been there to watch my big day. Unfortunately my grandparents have all passed and my dad died at the very young age of 47. My mum is now too ill to leave her house. My dad came to England in 1968 at the age of 21 with £5 in his pocket. Even though he was well educated he was only offered a job in a foundry. He worked hard for many years and eventually set up his own successful business. By the time he passed away his house and business were both debt free. He was an example that I have tried to live up to. There is no way I could go with £5 to a foreign country and be successful. Along my life journey I have been lucky not to only have a brilliant family and friends but I have had amazing school teachers, professional professors at University and some of the best managers and colleagues at work. So really this honour is for everyone that has touched my life. So you can imagine that although I had a surreal time at Windsor Castle, it was also bittersweet because my grandparents and mum and dad were not there. So make the most of the time you have with your loved ones because we do not know when that time will be taken away. I have learnt throughout my career and life that if you are friendly, nice and caring then that will go along way to make everyone’s mindsets better. Lastly the only constant in life is change so embrace it. Whatever dreams and aspirations you have - go for for it - as they do come true. Never stop dreaming and always fight for what you believe in."
