        "text": "William Shatner has notched up an impressive 70-plus years in front of the camera, displaying heady comedic talent and being instantly recognizable to several generations of cult television fans as the square-jawed Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the starship U.S.S. Enterprise.\n\nShatner was born in Côte Saint-Luc, Montréal, Québec, Canada, to Anne (Garmaise) and Joseph Shatner, a clothing manufacturer. His father was a Jewish emigrant from Bukovina in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while his maternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews. After graduating from university, he joined a local Summer theatre group as an assistant manager. He then performed with the National Repertory Theatre of Ottawa and at the Stratford, Ontario, Shakespeare Festival as an understudy working with such as Alec Guinness, James Mason, and Anthony Quayle. He came to the attention of New York critics and was soon playing important roles in major shows on live television.\n\nShatner spent many years honing his craft before debuting alongside Yul Brynner in Die Brüder Karamasow (1958). He was kept busy during the 1960s in films such as Urteil von Nürnberg (1961) and Weißer Terror (1962) and on television guest-starring in dozens of series such as Alfred Hitchcock präsentiert (1955), Preston & Preston (1961), The Outer Limits (1963) and Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959). In 1966, Shatner boarded the USS Enterprise for three seasons of Raumschiff Enterprise (1966), co-starring alongside Leonard Nimoy, with the series eventually becoming a bona-fide cult classic with a worldwide legion of fans known variously as \"Trekkies\" or \"Trekkers\".\n\nAfter \"Star Trek\" folded, Shatner spent the rest of the decade and the 1970s making the rounds, guest-starring on many prime-time television series, including Hawaii Fünf-Null (1968), Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969) and Der Chef (1967). He has also appeared in several feature films, but they were mainly B-grade (or lower) fare, such as the embarrassingly bad Euro western Rio Hondo (1968) and the campy Mörderspinnen (1977). However, the 1980s saw a major resurgence in Shatner's career with the renewed interest in the original Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) series culminating in a series of big-budget \"Star Trek\" feature films, including Star Trek - Der Film (1979), Star Trek II - Der Zorn des Khan (1982), Star Trek III - Auf der Suche nach Mr. Spock (1984), Zurück in die Gegenwart (1986), Star Trek V - Am Rande des Universums (1989) and Star Trek VI - Das unentdeckte Land (1991). In addition, he starred in the lightweight police series T. J. Hooker (1982) from 1982 to 1986, alongside spunky Heather Locklear, and surprised many fans with his droll comedic talents in Die unglaubliche Reise in einem verrückten Raumschiff (1982), Loaded Weapon 1 (1993) and Miss Undercover (2000).\n\nHe has most recently been starring in the David E. Kelley television series Practice: Die Anwälte (1997) and its spin-off Boston Legal (2004).\n\nOutside of work, he jogs and follows other athletic pursuits. His interest in health and nutrition led to him becoming spokesman for the American Health Institute's 'Know Your Body' program to promote nutritional and physical health.\n\nAlthough she was presented in 1969 the first Film Star of Tomorrow by The Motion Picture Exhibitors of Canada, the status of Sharon Acker as a star never materialized. Not that she was inactive, quite the opposite, but she worked almost only for TV and appeared only in a few undistinguished movies. She will, nevertheless, remain remembered for her role as Lee Marvin's ex-wife in John Boorman's classic Point Blank - Keiner darf Überleben (1967). The victim of Marvin's rough manners, Acker as Lynne left a deep impact on male brains. Born in 1935, the Canadian-born actress started her film career in England when the play she was in, \"Lucky Jim\", Kingsley Amis' classic, was made into a movie. But she was not seen in many movies, except during the sixties, either in Canada or in the U.S. Meanwhile, she was very active on TV, first in Canada from the age of 19, then in the U.S. in made-for-TV movies or series like Raumschiff Enterprise (1966), Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966), Rauchende Colts (1955), Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969), Barnaby Jones (1973), etc. She was a regular in the series The Bold Ones: The Senator (1970) for one year and played \"Della Street\" in the short-lived The New Perry Mason (1973). A talented actress seen too little in movie theaters.\n\nCarlos Albornoz is a Toronto based Actor. He has been featured on hit television shows, Grand Army, Kim's Convenience, Schitts Creek, and was cast as Prince Markie Dee in the Salt-n-Pepa biopic.\n\nAs a child, Carlos would constantly daydream about being on set. He would imagine lights and cameras surrounding him on his walks home from school and would never run out of make-believe acting partners. After graduating high school, Carlos entered the workforce, believing that he could not make a career out of acting. After being laid-off his \"Safety job\", he decided to pursue what made him most happy. \"I'm just a guy who decided to chase a dream, and it was the best decision of my life\". Carlos went on to study Theatre Performance at Humber, School of Creative and Performing Arts, where he was exposed to various acting techniques and methods. He strives to create and develop Latino-Canadian stories, giving a voice to Latino youth and communities. He is also working on developing, directing and producing his own films and TV shows.\n\nFlex Aleo is a Canadian, Nigerian and South African Actor and Producer.\n\nBorn and raised near Johannesburg - South Africa, Flex has always been curious about culture and digital media. In 2008 Flex stepped on a one-way flight to Toronto to pursue his education and has been forging his dreams ever since.\n\nFlex has appeared in various TV shows, films and advertisements. His career highlight was the lead role in a TV series titled \"Fear Thy Roommate\". A spin off of \"Fear Thy Neighbor\", the episode aired across the US & Canada on the Investigation Discovery Channel. He has also appeared in national TV commercials such as Mary Browns and print commercials such as Canadian Tire.\n\nHe hopes to one day make a speech on a world stage and utter the words: \"It's not where you start or where you finish, it's about the journey in between. That's where life happens. Live your life like a movie and be your own star everyday.\".\n\nA rising talent in the acting world, George Alevizos is making waves with his dynamic range and versatility.
