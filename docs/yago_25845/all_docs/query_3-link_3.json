        "text": "Author Profile: Elissa Ambrose\n\nAuthor Name: Elissa Ambrose\n\nWebsite: http://www.elissaambrose.com/\n\nBio: Elissa Ambrose was born in Montreal, Canada. After graduating from McGill University with a degree in English, for some strange reason she embarked on a career in computer programming. Seventeen years later, after an amicable parting with technology, she returned to her first love—the written word. First she was an editor at a company that produced educational material, and later at a literary magazine. Prior to Sex, Lies & Hot Tubs, she published four romances with Harlequin and several short stories. Along the road to publication, she raised two daughters. She and her husband now live in Arizona. (Yes, it’s hot. But it’s a dry heat, remember? And you can’t shovel heat.)\n\nSee my 5 star review for Sex, Lies & Hot Tubs!\n\nVisit Elissa’s tour page!\n\nConnect with Elissa:\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttp://www.ElissaAmbrose.com\n\nFacebook:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Sex.Lies.HotTubs\n\nTwitter:\n\n@ElissaAmbrose\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ElissaAmbrose\n\nGoodreads:\n\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13579414-sex-lies-hot-tubs\n\nBuy the Book!\n\nAmazon:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sex-Lies-Hot-Tubs-ebook/dp/B0079OSS2M\n\nBarnes &Noble:\n\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/c/elissa-ambrose\n\niTunes:\n\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/book/sex-lies-hot-tubs/id543138838?mt=11\n\nSex, Lies & Hot Tubs by Elissa Ambrose\n\nElissa Ambrose is now on tour with CLP Blog Tours and Sex, Lies & Hot Tubs. What a book! You know you are engrossed in a story when you have your Kindle balanced on your laptop so you can sneak in sentences while working! I think that is the definition of “not being able to put a book down.” I had a great time with this book and the characters that filled the pages. Ellen Dunwell is our MC, a mother, a wife, a friend, and a high school teacher. She stumbled upon her husband’s – a dermatology doctor- affair in the past with his receptionist, and now she has a suspicion that he is back to his usual ways. When he goes missing, the mystery is amped. Did her really take off with a new girlfriend? What about his shady new side business Ellen thinks he got involved in – could something have taken a wrong turn in that aspect? Ellen is also dealing with a hormone-charged, angst-ridden teenage daughter calling for attention, as well as her students, her friends, and a Peeping Tom neighbor.\n\nThere is a lot going on in this book, but I never felt confused or unable to get into a sub-plot. Ambrose gives readers mystery, humor, suspense, sex, and a quick-pace that made me finish this within two days. I really don’t want to give anything away because there is plenty of shock-able moments, but I can’t recommend this book more. A big 5 star review for me, and another to add to my Favorites List!\n\n[Rating: 5]\n\nBlog Tour Sign Up: Sex, Lies & Hot Tubs by Elissa …\n\nIf a woman tries to preserve a marriage that has been damaged by infidelity, is she heroic or is she delusional? How many times does her husband have to cheat before she calls it quits? How many times does he have to get caught?\n\nMeet Ellen Dunwell, doting wife, loving mother, high school teacher extaordinaire. She’s worried that her husband, the respected Dr.\n\nJeffrey Dunwell, wonderful father, great lover, is having another affair. As if that’s not bad enough, her friends don’t understand her, her neighbor’s son is a Peeping Tom, and her angst-ridden teenage daughter is stashing pot in her room and dating a control freak. When Jeffrey suddenly disappears, Ellen nearly slips over the edge.\n\nInstead, she pulls herself together and sets out on a mission to find him—only to get caught up in a web of intrigue and danger, where nothing is as it seems and the stakes are her life."
