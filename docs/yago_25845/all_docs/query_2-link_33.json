        "text": "Elissa Ambrose\n\nBiography\n\nOriginally from Montreal, Canada, Elissa now resides in Arizona with her husband, her smart but surly cat, and her sweet but silly cockatoo. She's the proud mother of two daughters, who, though they have flown the coop, still manage to keep her on her toes. After graduating from college with a degree in English literature, Elissa embarked on a career in computer programming. She still hasn't figured out the connection between the two fields, but she believes that all those years in data processing gave her a strong, detail-oriented focus. Two decades and countless programs later, she now serves as the fiction editor at Anthology magazine, a literary journal published in Mesa, Arizona. When not writing, editing, or reading, Elissa can be found trying to master a new spin or jump on the ice rink (translation: trying not to break her neck), or in the kitchen, trying out a new recipe. Besides skating and cooking, she loves to travel. After she completes a manuscript, she and her husband fly to England for a little R&R, in search of the perfect pub."
