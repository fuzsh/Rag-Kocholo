        "text": "Muroff-Kotler Visual Arts Gallery\n\nThe Muroff-Kotler Visual Arts Gallery serves as a center for creative artistic activity at the College and for the outside community. It also functions as an environment for teaching, performing, and exhibiting.\n\nThe College's permanent art collection enriches the cultural climate on campus by making additional works of a high level of artistic achievement available to students and the community. In this manner, the collection serves as a permanent visual reference source.\n\nThe College believes that the acquisition of art works and the presentation of different art exhibitions assist the College community in setting standards for judgment and perception.\n\nArt Events & Exhibitions in the Gallery Spring 2024\n\nVISITING ARTIST —James E.

She is drawn to remote places where she studies nature and makes art inspired by it. Her work encompasses drawing, painting and sculpture. In 2021 Cochius received an NYSCA Decentralization Grant for an Individual Artist Commission. She is a 2020 recipient of a Foundation for Contemporary Arts (FCA), Emergency Grants COVID-19 Fund grant. In 2017 Cochius completed a public sculpture commission for the Village of Wappingers Falls, NY made possible by a grant from the Hudson River Foundation.\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nI am fascinated by growth-forms, root systems of plants, movements of microscopic organisms, seedpods, and animal architecture. In these I see a sensitive unpredictability that both contains and propels the origins and energies of life.\n\nMy sculpture, drawings, and paintings capture such fleeting moments in an organic world dominated by chaos and change. The energy that natural forms temporarily contain yet inevitably transform particularly inspires me. Evoking the mystery and power of nature through intensely materialist and tactile forms and imagery, my work explores the porous boundary between what is seen and felt, where perception and experience merge.\n\nI aim to create a mesmerizing effect of movement;, something that looks familiar, but that you cannot exactly define. Every inch of my work is as important as the whole, like fractal dimensions, seen through a microscope or a telescope.\n\nPast Events & Exhibitions\n\nFall 2019 | Fall 2018 | Spring 2018 | Fall 2017 | Spring 2017\n\nCOLLECTIVE EXPEDITIONS\n\nFriday, November 8 – Friday, December 13 Opening Reception:\n\nFriday, November 8\n\n5:00 – 7:00 p.m. Muroff-Kotler Gallery\n\nThe International Society of Antiquaries is a league of artists who are bound by a desire to look back in order to look forward. Collective Expeditions is their inaugural show and features painting, works on paper, sculpture, and installation. Although the artists have diverse practices, their work fits together in complex and interesting ways that speak to the importance of understanding our past—sometimes as far back as prehistory—in order to comprehend who we are as a species and where we are going. “Individually and collectively our work references tribal, shamanic, ancestral, as well as contemporary art; esotericism; anthropology; and archaeology in various direct and indirect ways.”\n\nParticipating artists\n\nKyle Cottier\n\nOlivia Baldwin\n\nElisa Pritzker\n\nGreg Slick\n\nVISITING ARTIST MARTIN WITTFOOTH\n\nThursday, September 12 – Friday, October 18 • Burroughs Lecture Hall 120\n\nOpening Reception • Slide Show & Lecture: Thursday, September 12 • 7:00 p.m.\n\nMartin Wittfooth is an artist whose paintings, drawings, installations and sculptural works investigate themes of the intersection and clash of industry and nature, and the human influence on the environment. Many of his works explore the theme of shamanism - rituals and practices as old as our species - through which we have attempted to dialogue with nature: the nature outside of ourselves and the nature within. His creative language uses the combination of allegory and symbolism to convey visual narratives. Martin Wittfooth was born in Toronto, Canada in 1981. He currently splits his time between two studios, Savannah, Georgia, and the Hudson Valley. He earned his MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 2008. Wittfooth’s work has been exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide, including the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art, Akron Art Museum in Ohio, and La Halle Saint-Pierre in Paris, with solo exhibitions in New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Montreal. His paintings have also appeared in numerous publications, including Juxtapoz, American Art Collector, and Vice, and cover features in New American Paintings, Hi- Fructose, and American Artist Magazine.\n\nArt Events & Exhibitions in the Gallery: Spring 2019\n\nHAMMER DANCE: New Works by Chris Victor\n\nFebruary 8 – March 29\n\nOpening reception: Friday, February 8, 2019\n\n5:00 - 7:00 p.m.\n\nChris Victor is a visual artist working primarily in repurposed and commonly available materials. For this exhibition, Chris has created a body of abstract, wall-based works inspired by his desire to return to painting, but using the materials, processes and methods of making things. The works reveal his curiosity and dexterity while exploring improvised making techniques inspired by the inherent qualities of the materials he is working with. This improvised method creates the works’ formal elements, with each piece developing from its own particular invented process. As the artist puts it, his aim is “to create works which are completely open about their own process of becoming.” Chris’s work has been in numerous shows including The Grand Rapids Public Museum, the Trenton City Museum at Ellarslie, and The Samuel Dorsky Museum. Chris has been a resident at the Wassaic Project artist residency and was awarded an NYFA Fellowship in Sculpture in 2014. This event is free.\n\nSTUDENT WORKS\n\nApril 24 - May 18, 2019\n\nOpening reception: Wednesday, April 24, 12:00 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThis annual exhibition will bring together the creative work of students in the Visual Art, Design and Fashion Design programs for a lively interaction of diverse media. This event is free.\n\nFUTURE VOICES: HIGH SCHOOL ART FROM ULSTER COUNTY\n\nMay 30 - June 13\n\nOpening reception, Thursday May 30, 2019\n\n5:00 - 7:00 p.m.\n\nThis annual exhibition features artwork from Ulster County High School students.\n\nParticipating schools include Saugerties, Onteora, Rondout Valley, Kingston, Coleman Catholic, and Ellenville.\n\nThis event is free.\n\nArt Events & Exhibitions in the Gallery: Fall 2018\n\nThe Form of Shadows\n\nRecent photography by Ernest Shaw\n\nFriday, November 16 – Friday, December 14, 2018\n\nOpening Reception: Friday, November 16, 5:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m.\n\nLocal resident Ernest Shaw will be exhibiting recent photography in his show, THE FORM OF SHADOWS. This exhibit is primarily focused on photography, a \"new\" medium in his 50 year career with sculpture, paintings, and drawings. The photographs integrate his lifelong concerns with mortality, the nature of the \"self\" and shadow, and the relentless search for integration and wholeness, particularly in the consequences of action and gestures, of moments and eons. One of these series, \"Are we flesh or wood?\" explores our fundamental unity and relatedness with the natural world, of life with death. The photographs, primarily visual, are also deeply grounded in our psychological condition, our relationship to ever changing time and place. These themes resonate with Shaw's other career as psychiatrist, psychotherapist and long-time teacher of mindfulness meditation practices. As Shaw has written, \"articulate compassion is common ... silence is the dialogue of centuries\". This body of work asks, \"are we one, or two ... or none? This event is free and open to the public.\n\nA Message from the Exterior\n\nAndrew Zuckerman, Photographer, filmmaker and curator\n\nThursday, October 11 – Friday, November 2, 2018\n\nSlide Lecture/Opening Reception: Thursday, October 11, 7:00 p.m., College Lounge, Vanderlyn Hall\n\nVisiting Artist Andrew Zuckerman is an award winning photographer, filmmaker, and curator. Much of his work is concerned with the intersection of nature and technology. His immersive investigation of the natural world has produced multiple books and exhibitions collected in three volumes: Creature (2007), Bird (2009), and Flower (2012).\n\nZuckerman’s ongoing portrait practice utilizes both photography and filmed interview formats to examine human perspectives. With the support of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, he released Wisdom in 2008 as a book, a feature length documentary film, and a global traveling exhibition.\n\nFor this exhibition, Andrew will show a selection of works from his series A Message from the Exterior, an installation of photographic works from his continued investigation of the human relationship to the natural world. Through a systematic and objective approach to live subjects, presented in extreme resolution and clarity, his intention is to celebrate these subjects in a way that makes them feel new and somehow undiscovered. This event is free and open to the public.\n\nHers & His: 25 Years of Art & Marriage\n\nA Selection of Works by the Artists Allyson Levy and Scott Serrano\n\nFriday, August 31 – Friday, September 28, 2018\n\nOpening Reception: Friday, August 31, 5:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m.\n\nMuroff Kotler Visual Arts Gallery\n\nFor over 25 years of marriage, Allyson Levy and Scott Serrano have been making art and yet their only collaborative works are their son and daughter. In 1999 they moved to the rural forested area of Stone Ridge. Since that time they have become fascinated with nature and plants. A life immersed in nature’s cycles and growing plants has dominated both of their art for the last 18 years. Plants are the sources of inspiration and are used directly in paintings as art materials.\n\nThey collected so many diverse plants that they started a Botanical Garden called ‘Hortus Conclusus’ that is classified as a a level II Arboretum."
