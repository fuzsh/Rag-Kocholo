Despite a casual interest in folk music as a teenager, after high school, he landed at Tufts University in Massachusetts. There he became a psych major, later completing a graduate degree in Special Education and was ABD (“all but dissertation”) for the doctorate in Human Development and Family Studies at Cornell. In 1970, Irwin, Bill Nowlin, and Marian Leighton Levy started Rounder Records, with the simultaneous release of albums by old-time banjo player George Pegram and young old-timey Cambridge stringband the Spark Gap Wonder Boys. With such modest beginnings and equally humble goals, Rounder started to build its catalogue, documenting what one reviewer of that period referred to as “roots music and its contemporary offshoots.”\n\nIrwin was actively involved in signing and discovering new artists. Irwin was responsible for signing previously unsung talents including Alison Krauss, Béla Fleck, Mark O’Connor, Jerry Douglas, Ricky Skaggs, George Thorogood, Buckwheat Zydeco, and, more recently, Bradley Walker, James Hand, Harley Allen, Donna Hughes, Sierra Hull, and Dailey & Vincent, among others. Among the bluegrass and old-time artists he has worked with are Hazel Dickens, James King, Del McCoury, IIIrd Tyme Out, the Johnson Mountain Boys, Bobby Osborne, Jeannie Kendall, the Whitstein Brothers, and many more. He also helped to raise awareness of bluegrass’s first generation, producing and licensing a series of crucial reissues by some of the music’s legendary early figures, including Jimmy Martin, Bill Monroe, Jim & Jesse, Flatt & Scruggs, and others — keeping this essential music in print when few other labels did so. Irwin has also created many illuminating and bestselling compilations drawn from Rounder’s archive of over 3,000 albums, among them the remarkable O, Sister: A Women’s Bluegrass Collection (which doubled as a document of Rounder’s extensive efforts to promote female bluegrass musicians), Blue Trail of Sorrow, and Bluegrass #1s. Outside of bluegrass, Irwin has been involved with producing a string of Grammy-winning polka records with bandleader Jimmy Sturr.\n\nWhen not on the road, in the studio, at a festival, or at a conference, Ken lives with his wife in a coastal city north of Boston and still feels the same excitement and passion for the music that he always has.\n\nSkip and Marge Motes, of Newburyport, have been researching Newburyport’s history since moving here in 1995. Skip has given lectures for the Newburyport Preservation Trust, Custom House Maritime Museum, and the Newburyport Public Library Lecture Series. Marge answered queries for fourteen years for the Museum of Old Newbury and has published North End Papers, 1618-1880: Newburyport, Massachusetts—Development of the North End of the City, a compilation of the writing of Oliver B. Merrill, and has transcribed the newly discovered Newburyport Revolutionary War records for the Committee of Safety, Correspondence and Inspection. Their first book, published in 1994, was Laurens & Newberry Counties, S.C.: Saluda and Little River Settlements, 1749-1775, which won the National Genealogy Society prize for methods and sources.\n\nThe Motes’ Newburyport area publications include The Newburyport Art Association: First Sixty Years, 1948-2008; Harbor Range Lights, Newburyport, Massachusetts, 2016; Harbor Range Lights and the Waterside; Legendary Newburyporters, Briggs Exhibition, Custom House Maritime Museum; Going One Better, and The Federal Street Mansion of William Bartlet, Merchant 1778-2024, Newburyport, Massachusetts. Their compilations list includes Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker, and Other Occupations in Newburyport, Massachusetts 1850 Census; Reminiscences of Newburyport Peter Fudge an 18th Century Boy (originally published in the Daily Herald in 1858), and Among the Whales, Joseph Nye Clark.\n\nCharlie Sawyer developed his passion for both photography and blues music back in the mid-1960s. In 1980, Doubleday published The Arrival of B.B. King, Charlie’s biography of the talented orphan who became a great bluesman and international star. Today, many of Charlie’s photographs from that book and his recent one, B.B. King: From Indianola to Icon (Schiffer Books 2022), are displayed in the B.B. King Museum in Indianola, Mississippi—B.B. King’s hometown in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, birthplace of the blues. Besides the blues, Charlie’s photographic subjects include Eastern and Central Europe just before the end of Communism; Israel, the Caribbean, New England, American politics in the 1970s and ’80s, and rodeo life in the U.S. and Canada. Charlie still leads the blues band, 2120 South Michigan Avenue (harp/keys/vocals), shows his photographs, gives talks, and does whatever he can to ensure that the great blues artists of the 20th century are remembered and revered."
