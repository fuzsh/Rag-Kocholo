        "text": "Happy New Year‚Äôs Eve! New Year‚Äôs Day, aka the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God is coming up tomorrow, and is a holyday of obligation in many countries, including the US and Canada, so get thee to Mass!\n\nThe next major feast day after that is Epiphany, one of our favorites! We have LOTS of family Epiphany traditions. I‚Äôve got a post about many of them here (but you‚Äôll have to scroll past last year‚Äôs Christmas cardüòÅ).\n\nTODAY, I want to focus on just one, the Epiphany House Blessing, which is the subject of the next installment of the Catholic All Year Liturgical Living Video Series!\n\nThe Epiphany House Blessing prayers that we use in the video are available online here, or as a printable pdf booklet here. Also available en Espa√±ol! Booklet purchases from the Catholic All Year Shop sponsor the creation of these videos by my very talented friend Elissa, so thank you!\n\nAlso available is the Catholic All January Printable Booklet, including the Epiphany House Blessing, and all the other prayers, songs, Bible readings, and blessings our family uses throughout the month of January.\n\nIt‚Äôs now also on Amazon as a paperback booklet! If you have purchased it, please see here.\n\nWe like Epiphany so much, we ended up making TWO videos for it! Stay tuned for a video on how to make an easy cheater King Cake and crown a family King or Queen of Epiphany! That should post on Wednesday, January 2nd.\n\nAnd for today, December 31st . . .\n\nThe Te Deum, historically attributed to St. Ambrose, is recited in thanksgiving at the end of things. On the last day of the year, there is a plenary indulgence available for its public recitation!\n\nTe Deum\n\nYou are God, we praise you:\n\nYou are the Lord: we acclaim you;\n\nYou are the eternal Father:\n\nAll creation worships you.\n\nTo you all angels, all the powers of heaven,\n\nCherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise:\n\nHoly, holy, holy, Lord God of power and might,\n\nHeaven and earth are full of your glory.\n\nThe glorious company of apostles praise you.\n\nThe noble fellowship of prophets praise you.\n\nThe white-robed army of martyrs praise you.\n\nThroughout the world, the holy Church acclaims you:\n\nFather of majesty unbounded,\n\nYour true and only Son, worthy of all worship,\n\nAnd the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.\n\nYou, Christ, are the King of Glory\n\nThe eternal Son of the Father.\n\nWhen you became man to set us free,\n\nYou did not spurn the Virgin‚Äôs womb.\n\nYou overcame the sting of death,\n\nAnd opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.\n\nYou are seated at God‚Äôs right hand in glory.\n\nWe believe that you will come and be our judge.\n\nCome then, Lord, and help your people,\n\nBought with the price of your own blood,\n\nAnd bring us with your saints to glory everlasting.\n\n<kneel>\n\nV: Save your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance.\n\nR: Govern and uphold them now and always\n\nV: Day by day we bless you.\n\nR: We praise your name forever.\n\nV: Keep us today, Lord, from all sin.\n\nR: Have mercy on us, Lord have Mercy\n\nV: Lord, show us your Love and Mercy\n\nR: for we put our trust in you.\n\nV: In you, Lord, is our hope:\n\nR: and we shall never hope in vain.\n\nAmen.\n\nPublic recitation means in a church, family, religious community, or group of friends.\n\nThe usual conditions for a plenary indulgence include having been to Mass and received communion within three days before or after the action of the indulgence, sacramental confession within three weeks before or after, being in a state of Grace (Catholic, not excommunicated or in schism), not attached to sin (this doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt commit the same sins often, just that you don‚Äôt LIKE the sin), and praying for the intentions of the pope. If all of these conditions are not met, the indulgence becomes partial, which is still pretty great.\n\nIndulgences can be applied to oneself or to the soul of a deceased person, but not to another living person.\n\nFor more on indulgences, see here, and have a very Happy New Year‚Äôs Eve!"
