        "text": "Judy Duarte always knew there was a book inside her, but since English was her least favorite subject in school, she never considered herself a writer. An avid reader who enjoys a happy ending, Judy couldn’t shake the dream of creating a book of her own.\n\nThat dream became a reality in 2002, when Silhouette released her first Special Edition. Since then, more than fifty of her books have hit the shelves, including four women’s fiction novels and two novellas.\n\nHer stories have touched the hearts of readers around the world, landing her a prestigious Reader’s Choice Award. In 2009, she won the Maggie and finaled in the Inspirational category of the Rita® with MULBERRY PARK. And in 2010, ENTERTAINING ANGELS finaled in the Rita®, won the Maggie, and placed second in the Inspirational Readers Choice.\n\nWhen she’s not cooped up in her writing cave, Judy spends time with her somewhat enormous, but delightfully close family near the beach in Southern California.\n\nEver since the age of four when she pilfered her brother’s comics, Elissa knew she wanted to be a writer. The road to publication, however, had a few detours. After graduating with a degree in English literature, she became a programmer (go figure). Years later, after an amicable parting with technology, she was an editor at a company that produced educational material, and after that, the fiction editor at a literary journal. Working with so many talented writers was what finally spurred her forward, inspiring her to write Journey of the Heart, her first novel.\n\nOriginally from Montreal, Canada, Elissa now lives in Arizona with her computer-guru husband, and no, she doesn’t miss the snow. (It’s a dry heat, remember? And you can’t shovel heat.)\n\nBest-selling, award-winning author Gina Wilkins sold her first novel to Harlequin in 1987, the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. She is the author of 115 Harlequin books. Her psychological suspense novel, WAKE ME, is a Kindle exclusive release.\n\nWhether through drama, humor or suspense, the underlying theme in her storytelling has always been \"the universally-identifiable search for a safe place to call home.\" She is a four-time winner of the respected Maggie Award for Excellence sponsored by Georgia Romance Writers and was nominated for a Lifetime Achievement Award by the reviewers of Romantic Times magazine.\n\nA lifelong resident of central Arkansas, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Journalism from Arkansas State University and worked in advertising and multi-media employee training before launching her writing career. She has been married for more than forty years to her husband, John, with whom she raised two daughters and a son, all pursuing careers in science and medicine."
