        "text": "Author Name: Elissa Ambrose\n\nWebsite: http://www.elissaambrose.com/\n\nBio: Elissa Ambrose was born in Montreal, Canada. After graduating from McGill University with a degree in English, for some strange reason she embarked on a career in computer programming. Seventeen years later, after an amicable parting with technology, she returned to her first love—the written word. First she was an editor at a company that produced educational material, and later at a literary magazine. Prior to Sex, Lies & Hot Tubs, she published four romances with Harlequin and several short stories. Along the road to publication, she raised two daughters. She and her husband now live in Arizona. (Yes, it’s hot. But it’s a dry heat, remember? And you can’t shovel heat.)\n\nSee my 5 star review for Sex, Lies & Hot Tubs!\n\nVisit Elissa’s tour page!\n\nConnect with Elissa:\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttp://www.ElissaAmbrose.com\n\nFacebook:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Sex.Lies.HotTubs\n\nTwitter:\n\n@ElissaAmbrose\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ElissaAmbrose\n\nGoodreads:\n\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13579414-sex-lies-hot-tubs\n\nBuy the Book!\n\nAmazon:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sex-Lies-Hot-Tubs-ebook/dp/B0079OSS2M\n\nBarnes &Noble:\n\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/c/elissa-ambrose\n\niTunes:"
