This is the case for Sorbonne University. Quick access via Google by typing Numerical Probability, Gilles PagÃ¨s.\n\nObjectives of the course\n\nThe aim of this course is to present the Monte-Carlo and Quasi-Monte-Carlo methods commonly used in finance. Numerous examples from pricing and hedging problems illustrate the developments. A computer implementation of the techniques discussed will be carried out during the TD sessions. Each student will have to carry out, in pairs, a computer project (in C language) implementing either price calculations and option hedging or simulations of financial models. This course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to learn about the different aspects of the subject matter of the course. This course covers the following topics:\n\nIntroduction to simulation: generation of random variables following the usual laws. Simulation of Gaussian processes (Brownian, fractional Brownian). Simulation of standard Poisson processes.\n\nMonte-Carlo method: calculation of expectation by simulation. Confidence interval. Application to European options pricing.\n\nVariance reduction methods: control variables, preferential sampling, antithetic variables (co-monotonicity), stratification, preconditioning.\n\nQuasi-Monte-Carlo: theory and practice. Koksma-Hlawka inequality, Halton sequence, Sobol, Niederreiter.\n\nStochastic gradient methods.\n\nTime discretization of stochastic differential equations (Euler scheme, Milstein scheme): application to European options pricing.\n\nImprovement of the method in the case of path-dependent options: Brownian bridges,…\n\nCalculation of hedges and sensitivities by Monte-Carlo method: tangent process, log-likelihood by Euler scheme. - - - Bismuth formulas, Haussmann-Clark-Occone, Monte Carlo paradigm, Malliavin.\n\nIntroduction to multilevel methods, with and without weights.\n\nIn parallel to this course, 4 sessions of 2 hours will be dedicated to the implementation of these algorithms in Python. Particular attention will be paid to the efficiency of the codes for random simulation in Python. Interfacing with C++ will also be discussed.\n\nThe evaluation of the course is done through an exam and the submission of a computer project (in the second semester): each student will have to realize, in pairs, a computer project implementing either price and option hedging calculations or financial model simulations. They will submit a report describing the methods used and commenting on the results obtained.\n\nReferences"
