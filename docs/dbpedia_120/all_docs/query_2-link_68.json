        "text": "The Monte Carlo Simulation, also referred to as the Monte Carlo Analysis or the Monte Carlo Method, is used to identify the probability of outcomes of uncertain events to help make difficult decisions. It uses values of an estimated range to get a probability distribution, or a range of values where, with confidence, one can believe the outcomes will most possibly occur. This method gives decision-makers better confidence in where the outcomes will lie so that decisions can be made.\n\nThe Monte Carlo Simulation was developed by Stanislaw Ulam, who tried to devise a mathematical shortcut to predict the outcomes of the card game solitaire when he was ill. Although this did not help him win any card games, he realized that it could be used to help provide predictions for other important decisions. He joined forces with John von Neumann, a famous mathematician. Together, they worked on using what they deemed the Monte Carlo Simulation, named after the famous casino town in Monaco, to support its use with computational science.\n\nThe application of the Monte Carlo Simulation is most useful in highly uncertain projects with complex decisions. This could include how stock options will perform to help an investor decide which stocks to buy, what a project's costs and profits may be for a business to help them make sound financial decisions for marketplace expansion, or how the scheduling of a project may turn out so an organization can make long-range plans. Since its creation, this simulation is now used in all fields that use probability and statistics.\n\nThe Steps of a Monte Carlo Analysis\n\nDifferent steps or phases can be outlined for completing the Monte Carlo Simulation. This lesson will focus on breaking the Monte Carlo Analysis into four steps.\n\nIt is important to note that risk analysis happens at any step of the process. Each situation is different, and risks can expand or contract based on what is being placed within the simulation.\n\nAlthough this analysis can be done manually, it is typically done with software pre-programmed with the Monte Carlo Simulation. This is because the simulation is complex and requires extensive detail and calculations to provide a proper solution that one can derive confidence from the outcomes.\n\nUse relevant historical data: To gain a good probability distribution, one should input relevant historical data. For example, if the model is in relation to pricing data, one should input historical prices to provide a realistic sampling to gain appropriate outcomes.\n\nUse relevant statistics: Identify the statistics that could be relevant to the case being modeled, such as average, percentage of change, or variance, as this helps provide more accurate outcomes and leads to greater confidence in the output.\n\nDetermine the random input: Pick a data point through random generation from a computer program, or a researcher may choose random inputs. This allows for multiple outputs in step four.\n\nRepeat the desired number of times for confidence: Repeat the process until enough simulations have been performed to provide a solid picture of what the outcomes could be and confidence is felt in the responses (e.g., data points) that have been gathered from the results of the calculations.\n\nWhat Is a Monte Carlo Simulation?\n\nJust like life, projects are uncertain. Before jumping into a project, it's wise to evaluate the risks. How do we analyze these risks? We can use tools that'll show us the outcome of our decisions. Monte Carlo Simulations are one such tool that's used to analyze risk and help us make better decisions.\n\nA Brief History of the Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nRandom outcomes are most common in gambling, and there's a gambling spot in Monaco called Monte Carlo. The Monte Carlo Simulation is named after this gambling spot. A simulation is another word for imitating the actual process. In the Monte Carlo Simulation, we run through the various outcomes without actually going through a process or project. Stanislaw Ulam is the creator of the Monte Carlo Simulation, along with John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam's interest in the model arose when he wanted to predict his chance at winning in solitaire games.\n\nHow the Monte Carlo Simulation Works\n\nThe Monte Carlo Simulation is a quantitative model that predicts each outcome and what the likelihood of each outcome is; likelihood is termed as probability in quantitative analysis. For example, consider the decision of trying out a new restaurant. There's likely three outcomes for this decision: you might love the food, hate it, or just find it good enough to eat when you don't have other options. Each option in this case is said to be equally likely, and hence has a probability of one-third.\n\nIn every situation, we have the option to make a number of decisions. The decisions could be categorized as very conservative, very radical, or in between. The Monte Carlo Simulation considers each decision and all the possible outcomes for each decision. For example, there's a likelihood that a very conservative decision might result in a very undesirable outcome.\n\nAdvantages of the Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nThe major advantage of the Monte Carlo Simulation is that it helps to make decisions by analyzing various outcomes. When a project manager makes a decision using the Monte Carlo Simulation she or he needs to be able to communicate the reasons for her or his decisions to various stakeholders. With the Monte Carlo Simulation, a graph can be plotted with outcomes and their likelihood, which can be communicated easily. It also helps the decision maker to reconsider their inputs after looking at which input has the biggest negative impact on the result, as well as looking at the interdependence between inputs."
