        "text": "Unlike a normal forecasting model, Monte Carlo Simulation predicts a set of outcomes based on an estimated range of values versus a set of fixed input values. In other words, a Monte Carlo Simulation builds a model of possible results by leveraging a probability distribution, such as a uniform or normal distribution, for any variable that has inherent uncertainty. It, then, recalculates the results over and over, each time using a different set of random numbers between the minimum and maximum values. In a typical Monte Carlo experiment, this exercise can be repeated thousands of times to produce a large number of likely outcomes.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulations are also utilized for long-term predictions due to their accuracy. As the number of inputs increase, the number of forecasts also grows, allowing you to project outcomes farther out in time with more accuracy. When a Monte Carlo Simulation is complete, it yields a range of possible outcomes with the probability of each result occurring.\n\nOne simple example of a Monte Carlo Simulation is to consider calculating the probability of rolling two standard dice. There are 36 combinations of dice rolls. Based on this, you can manually compute the probability of a particular outcome. Using a Monte Carlo Simulation, you can simulate rolling the dice 10,000 times (or more) to achieve more accurate predictions.\n\nRegardless of what tool you use, Monte Carlo techniques involves three basic steps:\n\nSet up the predictive model, identifying both the dependent variable to be predicted and the independent variables (also known as the input, risk or predictor variables) that will drive the prediction.\n\nSpecify probability distributions of the independent variables. Use historical data and/or the analyst’s subjective judgment to define a range of likely values and assign probability weights for each.\n\nRun simulations repeatedly, generating random values of the independent variables. Do this until enough results are gathered to make up a representative sample of the near infinite number of possible combinations.\n\nYou can run as many Monte Carlo Simulations as you wish by modifying the underlying parameters you use to simulate the data. However, you’ll also want to compute the range of variation within a sample by calculating the variance and standard deviation, which are commonly used measures of spread. Variance of given variable is the expected value of the squared difference between the variable and its expected value. Standard deviation is the square root of variance. Typically, smaller variances are considered better."
