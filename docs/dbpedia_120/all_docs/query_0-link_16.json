        "meta_description": "This concise, practical hands on guide to Monte Carlo simulation introduces standard and advanced methods to the increasing complexity of derivatives portfolios. An invaluable resource for quantitative analysts who need to run models that assist in option pricing and risk management. This concise, practical hands on guide to Monte Carlo simulation introduces standard and advanced methods to the increasing complexity of derivatives portfolios. \nRanging from pricing more complex derivatives, such as American and Asian options, to measuring Value at Risk, or modelling complex market dynamics, simulation is the only method general enough to capture the complexity and Monte Carlo simulation is the best pricing and risk management method available. \nThe book is packed with numerous examples using real world data and is supplied with a CD to aid in the use of the examples.",

KotzéRudi Oosthuizen\n\nBusiness, Computer Science\n\nThis paper discusses Monte Carlo (MC) simulation as implemented and used by the JSE.\n\nPricing Asian Options using Monte Carlo Methods\n\nHongbin Zhang\n\nBusiness, Computer Science\n\nThe results suggest that the Least Squares Monte Carlo method is more suitable for problems in higher dimensions than other comparable Monte Carlo methods.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation with Stochastic Differential Equations\n\nR. Seydel\n\nMathematics, Business\n\nThis chapter presents methods for pricing options using the Monte Carlo approach, and describes two Monte Carlo approaches for American-style options, namely, parametric methods and regression methods.\n\nA semi-analytical method for VaR and credit exposure analysis\n\nBen De PriscoI. IscoeA. KreininAhmed Nagi\n\nBusiness, Economics\n\nNew analytical methods for computing Value-at-Risk (VaR) and a credit exposure profile are discussed and it is found that the analytical methods are more accurate than RiskMetrics delta VaR, and are more efficient than Monte Carlo, for the case of fixed income securities.\n\nNumerical and Empirical Studies of Option Pricing\n\nPrzemyslaw S. Stilger\n\nMathematics, Business\n\nThis thesis makes a number of contributions in the derivative pricing and risk management literature and to the growing literature that exploits information embedded in option prices. First, it…\n\nOption Pricing and Estimation of Financial Models with R\n\nS. Iacus\n\nMathematics, Business\n\nAnalysis and implementation of models goes beyond the standard Black and Scholes framework and includes Markov switching models, Lvy models and other models with jumps and topics other than option pricing include: volatility and covariation estimation, change point analysis, asymptotic expansion and classification of financial time series from a statistical viewpoint.\n\nDerivative Pricing, Numerical Methods\n\nK. Vetzal\n\nMathematics, Business\n\nNumerical methods are needed for derivatives pricing in cases where analytic solutions are either unavailable or not easily computable. The subject of numerical methods in the area of…\n\nMonte Carlo methods -A review of Variance Reduction Techniques\n\nH. AnderssonCarlo metoderH. AnderssonT. Sörensson\n\nBusiness, Mathematics\n\nThis research paper tries to evaluate different variance reduction strategies used for pricing financial options using Monte Carlo simulations. Within the field of finance and theoretical pricing of…\n\nComputation and modelling in insurance and finance\n\nE. Bølviken\n\nComputer Science, Mathematics\n\nThis introductory account provides readers with essential tools for handling complex problems and explains how simulation models can be created, used and re-used (with modifications) in related situations."
