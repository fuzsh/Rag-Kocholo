        "text": "3.1. Monte Carlo method\n\nThe Monte Carlo method, also known as statistical simulation and random sampling, is a stochastic simulation method based on probability and statistical theory, which uses a random number (or more common pseudo-random number) to solve a variety of computational problems. Whether it is used on the computer is taken as an important sign. Therefore, although it belongs to the calculation method, it is quite different from the general calculation method. It links the solved problem to a fixed probability model and uses a computer to implement random sampling or statistical simulation, thereby obtaining an approximate solution to the problem [13].\n\nWith the continuous development of computer technology, the application of the Monte Carlo method becomes increasingly extensive. In addition, because of the excellent adaptability of the method, the calculation of integral, the solution of equations, and the calculation of eigenvalues can be easily obtained. Currently, the Monte Carlo method is mainly used to solve two types of problems, i.e., the randomness and certainty. Among these problems, the deterministic problem needs to establish a probability model. In such a process, the model is randomly observed, and its arithmetic mean is used to solve the approximate estimate of the model [14]. The random problem is that it is affected by random factors and needs to be solved by random sampling. The Monte Carlo algorithm is mainly used to study the probability density function, random number generator, sampling rule, simulation result record, error estimation, variance reduction technology, and parallel and vectorization [15–16]. The probability density function mainly generates a set of probability density functions describing a problem or system. Then, it generates a uniformly distributed random number of [0, 1] through a random number generator and randomly extracts obedience from these random numbers. For a given random variable, the corresponding simulation results are recorded, the errors of these results are estimated, and the variance reduction technology is used to reduce the number of calculations in the simulation process. Eventually, the method is operated [17–19].\n\nWhen analyzing its convergence and error estimation, it is necessary to analyze its arithmetic mean value and expected value. The number of samples is denoted as N, the arithmetic mean of the samples is assumed as X1, X2, X3, … XN, as shown in Eq (1):\n\nX¯N=1N∑i=1NXi\n\n(1)\n\nAs an approximation of the solution, the sequence of variables in the sample is independent and identically distributed, and the probability value [20] can be obtained according to its expected value, as shown in Eq (2):\n\nP{limN→∞X¯N−E(X)}=1\n\n(2)\n\nHowever, since there is a certain error between the Monte Carlo approximation and actual value, and its variance value is shown in Eq (3):\n\n0<σ2=∫(x−E(X))2f(x)dx<∞\n\n(3)\n\nIn the above equation, f(x) is the distribution density function of X, then:\n\nlimN→∞P(Nσ|X¯N−E(X)|<x)=12π∫−xxe−t22dt\n\n(4)\n\nIf N tends to infinity, Eq (4) can be approximated as Eq (5):\n\nP(|X¯N−E(X)|<λασN)≈22π∫0λαe−t22dt=1−α\n\n(5)\n\nTherefore, the error of the Monte Carlo method can be obtained as shown in Eq (6):\n\nε=λασN\n\n(6))\n\nIn the above equation, σ indicates the fluctuation rate of the market, N indicates the times of simulation, α is the confidence degree, 1−α indicates the confidence level, the order of the error convergence speed is O(N-1/2), and the corresponding estimated value is as shown in Eq (7):\n\nσ^=1N∑i=1NXi2−(1N∑i=1NXi)2\n\n(7)\n\nAs shown in Eq (6), the convergence speed is not related to the dimension of the problem sought, and its multiple integrals are proportional to the power of the dimension.\n\n3.3. Asian option pricing\n\nThe risk-return characteristics of financial derivatives are different from those of general financial products. For example, an option can not only restrict market risk but also have a reservation effect on the market to retain profitable space. It is another characteristic that is different from the risk-return of basic assets. It is precise because of these advantages of financial derivatives that financial derivatives have won the favor of many investment enthusiasts, which makes financial derivatives gradually become an integral part of the basic asset portfolio.\n\nAs a financial derivative, options have a certain effect on risk avoidance and can avoid undesired consequences. In addition, it can largely benefit from good results. Currently, options have become one of the most versatile investments in financial instruments. In stock investment, continuous compounding is usually adopted. Also, the rise and fall of stock prices are generally irregular and will be affected by many factors. However, the randomness of the stock price also allows users to treat it as the value of a variable during the research process, which varies in an uncertain way over time. When the future prediction value of the variable in the stochastic process is only related to the current value of the variable and is independent of the past value, the stochastic process can be called as the Wiener process. The standard basic Wiener process is shown in .\n\nAs shown in , the behavior of the variable Z can be seen by the basic Wiener process generated by R, thereby predicting that the short time interval is a change of the variable Z. Asian options, also known as average price options, are derivatives of stock options and are based on lessons learned from the implementation of options, such as real options, virtual options, and stock options. Asian options are one of the most actively traded options in the current financial derivatives market. The difference between stock options and stock options in the usual sense is the limit on the execution price, which is the average price of the stock price for a period of time before the execution date. The difference from the standard option is that when the options income is determined on the maturity date, instead of using the market price of the underlying asset at the time, the average value of the asset price marked for a certain period of the contract period is used. Such a period is called the average period. When averaging the prices, the arithmetic mean or geometric mean is used.\n\nAssuming that an Asian option is priced at K and the expiration time is T, P represents the fee payable when purchasing an option, and its calculation can be expressed as Eq (13):\n\nP=[exp(1T∫0Tln(St)dt)−K]+\n\n(13)\n\nIn the above equation, St represents the stock price at time t. However, since the currency is time-worthy, P' represents the current value of payment fees, and its calculation can be expressed as Eq (14):\n\nP'=exp(−rT)[exp(1T∫0Tln(St)dt)−K]+\n\n(14)\n\nAssuming that the option is bought at time t, P* represents the current value of payment fees, and its calculation can be expressed as Eq (15):\n\nP*=−fc+exp(−rT)[exp(1T∫0Tln(St)dt)−K]+\n\n(15)\n\nThe return of the lookback option has a certain relationship with the maximum value of the underlying asset before the maturity date. The simulation results are shown in :\n\nThe pricing of fixed-looking call options and European call options is related to the strike price, while the price of the fixed-back call option is higher than the corresponding European call option. If the risk does not pose a threat, the expected yield of the stock is the risk-free rate. Therefore, the expected stock price on the maturity date will be higher than the average stock price during the effective period. At this time, the price of the floating look-up call option will be higher than the price of the corresponding Asian call option.\n\nThe value of the lookback option mainly depends on the highest or lowest price of the underlying asset that can be observed during the life of the option. In particular, there is an analytical solution to the pricing of the option under the continuous model, i.e., the lowest price or the highest price of the stock can be obtained when the continuous observation is performed. However, since the price of the underlying asset is discrete, the price under the continuous model can only be considered as an approximation of the actual price. As the frequency of observation increases, the probability of observing the extreme value increases. At this time, the price of the lookback option also shows an upward trend with the increase of the observation frequency. The Monte Carlo simulation of the European option is shown in :\n\nThe Asian option differs from the standard option. In such a case, when the options income is determined on the maturity date, the average value of the asset price of a short time target within the short time of the option is used to determine the price average operation. The method is mainly to avoid malicious manipulation of stock prices, and it can also reduce the insider trading of internal employees and damage the interests of the company to a certain extent.\n\n7 Feb 2020\n\nPONE-D-20-02638\n\nThe Value of Monte Carlo Model-Based Variance Reduction Technology in the Pricing of Financial Derivatives\n\nPLOS ONE\n\nDear Miss Zhang,\n\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE.

The results show that the Monte Carlo model-based variance reduction technology can significantly improve the simulation efficiency of financial derivatives pricing. In addition, the importance sampling method is used to optimize the selection, thereby making it closer to the theoretical values. The proposed method is easy to implement and has higher computational efficiency, which can ensure the financial benefits of users holding financial derivatives during the holding period. Therefore, this article is of great significance to the pricing of other products.
