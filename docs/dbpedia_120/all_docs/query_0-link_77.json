        "text": "\"The advanced theory of finance, like many other areas in which complex mathematics plays an important part, is undergoing a revolution aided by the computer and the proliferation of powerful simulation and symbolic mathematical tools. This is the mathematical equivalent of the invention of the printing press. The numerical and computational power once reserved for the most highly trained mathematicians, scientists, and engineers is now available to any competent programmer. \"\n\n—From Chapter 1\n\nMonte Carlo simulation methods are among the most powerful and broadly applicable tools available for valuing derivatives and other financial securities. Recent exponential increases in the power and speed of computers have greatly expanded the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations, leading to the need for a comprehensive and thoroughly updated reference on the use of Monte Carlo techniques for financial engineering and modeling.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation and Finance provides financial engineers, researchers, and students with today's most detailed and application-based examination of Monte Carlo modeling techniques. Filled with valuable insights and methodologies for formulating the problem at hand; setting specific objectives; choosing and implementing the most applicable model; determining parameters; running the simulation; and documenting results and conclusions in light of the simulation results, the book features:\n\nTechniques for using performance measures to calibrate a simulation model\n\nMethodologies for addressing survivorship bias\n\nVariance reduction in simulation\n\nImportance sampling and pricing exotic options, including Asian options and Barrier options\n\nPricing options under alternative, more realistic models\n\nQuasi–Monte Carlo multiple integration methods, which often generate estimates superior to traditional Monte Carlo methods\n\nExamples of van der Corput, Halton, Faure, and Sobol low-discrepancy sequences\n\nChapter-ending problems that both test newly acquired knowledge and suggest avenues for further exploration\n\nAn insightful discussion of the future of Monte Carlo financial simulation\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation and Finance is an essential reference for anyone, professional or academic, looking to design and implement accurate models for securities pricing and risk management. Further theoretical and mathematical information supporting theconcepts discussed throughout this book also appear in an online appendix at www.wiley.com/go/mcleish. Today's most up-to-date and results-based guide to this vital area, Monte Carlo Simulation and Finance is certain to set the standard for Monte Carlo reference texts throughout the remainder of this decade.\n\nPraise for MONTE CARLO SIMULATION & FINANCE\n\n\"Dr. McLeish's clear exposition of simulation methods and their application to a wide variety of practical financial problems, along with the enlightening exercise problems, make this text perfectly suited for use at both the senior undergraduate and graduate levels. As a reference, this refreshing volume will be a handy aid for researchers and practitioners in constructing complex financial simulations and in using sound, statistical techniques to evaluate the output. This book is a valuable and important contribution to an increasingly vital area of quantitative finance.\"\n\n—R. Mark Reesor, SHARCNet Research Chair in Financial Mathematics Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Western Ontario\n\n\"This book fills an important niche in a rapidly growing and very topical subject area. Both teachable and highly readable, this book is pitched at just the right level for anyone seeking to learn about this subject. The thoughtful choice of topics covered is greatly enhanced by very useful sets of exercises appearing at the back of each chapter.\"\n\n—Andrey Feuerverger, Professor of Statistics and Instructor in the Mathematical Finance Program University of Toronto\n\n\"Excellent source of information on topics rarely covered elsewhere. The book not only explicates Monte Carlo techniques but also is full of stimulating insights that reflect the wealth of experience Don McLeish has in statistical methods.\"\n\n—Adam Kolkiewicz, Associate Professor Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Waterloo"
