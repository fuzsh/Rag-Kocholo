This course provides a first introduction to Monte Carlo methods from complementary theoretical and applied points of view, and will include implementation of practical algorithms. Topics include random number generation, sampling, Markov chains, Monte Carlo integration, stochastic processes, and applications in computational science. Students need a basic background in probability, multivariable calculus, and some coding experience in any language. Coding assignments will be done in [Python üêç](https://www.python.org/). **Key Topics:** definitions of randomness, random number generation, randomness testing and quality measures, curse of dimensionality, sampling and aliasing, Markov chains, Monte Carlo methods, stochastic processes, sample generation algorithms, applications of random numbers in computation #### Course Overview Random numbers are a basic tool for achieving robustness, scalability, and correctness in the design of algorithms. Moreover, randomness is an essential part of models used to describe the behavior of systems found throughout science, technology, and engineering. The Monte Carlo method in particular was recognized by SIAM as one of the [most important 10 algorithms of the 20th century](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~web6140/). This course complements the existing curriculum, helping to better prepare students to apply randomness to problem solving in both academic and industrial settings. The goal of this course is to enable students to identify situations where random sampling provides the best solution to a computational/algorithmic problem, and to train them in the practical implementation of associated methods. Students should also acquire the mathematical background needed to derive new algorithms from first principles, rather than purely applying existing techniques, and to analyze the correctness and efficiency of these algorithms. (For example, they should be able to determine whether a given Monte Carlo estimator is unbiased, and measure the empirical efficiency of such algorithms in terms of statistics such as variance.) A secondary goal of this course is to expose students to a collection of application areas in computer science and the broader sciences where randomness can be profitably applied. In computer science, this set includes problems in computer systems/networking, programming languages, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and computer graphics. In the broader sciences, this includes partial differential equations arising in physics/chemistry/biology/etc., and stochastic models appearing in mathematical finance. #### Learning Objectives * Identify situations where random sampling provides the best solution to a computational/algorithmic problem. * Implement the associated methods. * Acquire the mathematical background needed to derive new algorithms from first principles. * Analyze the correctness and efficiency of these algorithms. * Become familiar with a collection of application areas in computer science and the broader sciences where randomness can be profitably applied. #### Prerequisite Knowledge _What prior knowledge must students have in order to be successful in this course?_ Students must have basic knowledge of coding (in any language), as well as basic knowledge of probability and multivariable calculus.

The room is big, and people inevitably drop. Please just hang in there. - If you're on the waitlist and hope to join the class, **please still show up to lecture, and complete / hand in the assignments!** Doing so will only make life easier once you are officially enrolled in the class. - If there are free spots in the class but you're still stuck on the waitlist, there is likely an administrative block (e.g., you don't officially meet the prereqs, or are signed up for too many hours). Good to check with your advisor. - Note that _instructors do not have the ability to move students off the waitlist directly_‚Äîwe have to coordinate with the course administrators. We do periodically clear the waitlist, so again, please just hang tight if things aren't getting updated immediately. - If you are adding the course late for any other reason, please make sure to: - Review the slides/notes from the lectures you missed, which are linked from the [schedule](#schedule). If you have trouble understanding the material from the slides alone, the [Monte Carlo book by Owen](https://artowen.su.domains/mc/) provides all the essentials (and much more!). - Complete the [assignments](#assignments) you missed. Like any other assignments, these are covered by the policy on [late days and dropped assignments](#latedays). - Chat with your peers, the TAs, and the instructors in [office hours](#officehours), on [Discord, and on Discourse](#infrastructure) to help fill in the gaps in your understanding. - Note that **instructors will not do one-on-one makeup sessions on missed material** (sorry!). But again, please take full advantage of the resources above, which should be enough to get you up to speed. #### Collaboration Policy - _Encouraged_ to work with anyone/everyone! - Must write up final solutions _100% on your own_ (including code) - e.g., erase the board, walk home, write up solutions - **Copying any part of someone else‚Äôs solutions is considered cheating** - any instance of cheating will result in an immediate ‚ÄúR‚Äù for the class - both/all parties will be considered cheating, no questions asked #### Grades - **Weekly assignments** ‚Äî 70% - each assignment worth the same amount - _can_ collaborate - _can_ use late days & drops - **Take-home midterm & final** ‚Äî 15% each - cumulative - _not_ collaborative - _cannot_ use late days & drops #### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at [access@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu). #### Student Wellness As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus [here](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling). Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.\n\nThis page rendered with showdownjs."
