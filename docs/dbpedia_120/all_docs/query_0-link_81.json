Based on the variance reduction technology, a Monte Carlo model that can effectively analyze financial prices is added to analyze price fluctuations and find the optimal holding time for users of financial derivatives, thereby reducing the risk of holding the financial derivatives. The results show that the Monte Carlo model-based variance reduction technology can significantly improve the simulation efficiency of financial derivatives pricing. In addition, the importance sampling method is used to optimize the selection, thereby making it closer to the theoretical values. The proposed method is easy to implement and has higher computational efficiency, which can ensure the financial benefits of users holding financial derivatives during the holding period. It can be seen that the Monte Carlo model-based variance reduction technology has high application value in the pricing of financial derivatives, and it is of great significance for the pricing of other products.",

        "text": "2.2. Monte Carlo model\n\nSpurzem and Giersz (2018) introduced a new method to analyze the gas models with different standards and performed dynamic analysis by Monte Carlo technology. The results showed that the standard theoretical model and the direct N-body model simulation results were more consistent, which also indicated that the method was an efficient and realistic model [8]. Wang et al. (2017) used the Monte Carlo model to analyze the impact of classification accuracy index and the variant on sample size, number of latent categories, category distance, and number of indicators, and their combinations on latent profile analysis. The results showed that there was a high correlation between Entropy value and classification accuracy, but it also changed with the sample size and index number. When other conditions were unchanged, the larger the sample size was, the smaller the Entropy value was, and the worse the accuracy of the classification was. If the sample size was small, the more the number of indicators was, the Entropy value also showed a better effect [9]. Zhang (2017) considered the real strategy of options trading and analyzed the trend of option value. In the process of using Monte Carlo in simulation, the value trend was analyzed from the perspective of intrinsic value, time value, and external volatility. The results showed that there was a certain correlation between the intrinsic value of the option and the time value. In addition, as the option time was shortened, especially on the option expiration date, the intrinsic value and time value of the option would decrease, while the external fluctuation rate and leverage would increase. Therefore, users who held the options were reminded to hold the options as early as possible before the expiration date [10].\n\n2.3. Variance reduction technology\n\nZhu and Chen (2018) used the Monte Carlo method to estimate the option price error and convergence rate. In addition, they utilized the least-squares method, the storage reduction technique, and the variance reduction technique to price the options of derivative securities. The research results showed that the standard deviation reduction effects of the control variable method and the dual variable method were obvious, and the dual variable method had a relatively average performance under different parameters. In addition, the effect of the control variable method depended on the correlation coefficient between the target assets, which was determined by the selected control variable. The convergence of the Monte Carlo method was improved by using a deterministic low-deviation sequence instead of a random point sequence [11]. Gao and Chen (2017) pointed out that under the Vasicek interest rate model, the pricing equations of ordinary bonds and European call options were deduced, and the discrete barrier options were priced based on them while the variances such as conditional expectation and importance sampling were used to reduce the variance and optimize the experimental analysis. The results showed that the Monte Carlo simulation method of conditional expectation and importance sampling and the two-variance reduction technology could be used to analyze the price of discrete obstacles, which could obtain more stable price data [12].\n\nIn summary, previous studies have focused on the prediction of derivatives prices in various industries, while the Monte Carlo model and variance reduction technology can better predict the value of derivatives. Therefore, in this paper, based on the Monte Carlo model of variance reduction technology, the value of financial derivatives pricing can make a good judgment on the holding time of financial derivatives holders, which is very important to judge the better time of holding.\n\n3.1. Monte Carlo method\n\nThe Monte Carlo method, also known as statistical simulation and random sampling, is a stochastic simulation method based on probability and statistical theory, which uses a random number (or more common pseudo-random number) to solve a variety of computational problems. Whether it is used on the computer is taken as an important sign. Therefore, although it belongs to the calculation method, it is quite different from the general calculation method. It links the solved problem to a fixed probability model and uses a computer to implement random sampling or statistical simulation, thereby obtaining an approximate solution to the problem [13].\n\nWith the continuous development of computer technology, the application of the Monte Carlo method becomes increasingly extensive. In addition, because of the excellent adaptability of the method, the calculation of integral, the solution of equations, and the calculation of eigenvalues can be easily obtained. Currently, the Monte Carlo method is mainly used to solve two types of problems, i.e., the randomness and certainty. Among these problems, the deterministic problem needs to establish a probability model. In such a process, the model is randomly observed, and its arithmetic mean is used to solve the approximate estimate of the model [14]. The random problem is that it is affected by random factors and needs to be solved by random sampling. The Monte Carlo algorithm is mainly used to study the probability density function, random number generator, sampling rule, simulation result record, error estimation, variance reduction technology, and parallel and vectorization [15–16]. The probability density function mainly generates a set of probability density functions describing a problem or system. Then, it generates a uniformly distributed random number of [0, 1] through a random number generator and randomly extracts obedience from these random numbers. For a given random variable, the corresponding simulation results are recorded, the errors of these results are estimated, and the variance reduction technology is used to reduce the number of calculations in the simulation process. Eventually, the method is operated [17–19].\n\nWhen analyzing its convergence and error estimation, it is necessary to analyze its arithmetic mean value and expected value. The number of samples is denoted as N, the arithmetic mean of the samples is assumed as X1, X2, X3, … XN, as shown in Eq (1): (1)\n\nAs an approximation of the solution, the sequence of variables in the sample is independent and identically distributed, and the probability value [20] can be obtained according to its expected value, as shown in Eq (2): (2)\n\nHowever, since there is a certain error between the Monte Carlo approximation and actual value, and its variance value is shown in Eq (3): (3)\n\nIn the above equation, f(x) is the distribution density function of X, then: (4)\n\nIf N tends to infinity, Eq (4) can be approximated as Eq (5): (5)\n\nTherefore, the error of the Monte Carlo method can be obtained as shown in Eq (6): (6))\n\nIn the above equation, σ indicates the fluctuation rate of the market, N indicates the times of simulation, α is the confidence degree, 1−α indicates the confidence level, the order of the error convergence speed is O(N-1/2), and the corresponding estimated value is as shown in Eq (7): (7)\n\nAs shown in Eq (6), the convergence speed is not related to the dimension of the problem sought, and its multiple integrals are proportional to the power of the dimension.\n\n3.3. Asian option pricing\n\nThe risk-return characteristics of financial derivatives are different from those of general financial products. For example, an option can not only restrict market risk but also have a reservation effect on the market to retain profitable space. It is another characteristic that is different from the risk-return of basic assets. It is precise because of these advantages of financial derivatives that financial derivatives have won the favor of many investment enthusiasts, which makes financial derivatives gradually become an integral part of the basic asset portfolio.\n\nAs a financial derivative, options have a certain effect on risk avoidance and can avoid undesired consequences. In addition, it can largely benefit from good results. Currently, options have become one of the most versatile investments in financial instruments. In stock investment, continuous compounding is usually adopted. Also, the rise and fall of stock prices are generally irregular and will be affected by many factors. However, the randomness of the stock price also allows users to treat it as the value of a variable during the research process, which varies in an uncertain way over time. When the future prediction value of the variable in the stochastic process is only related to the current value of the variable and is independent of the past value, the stochastic process can be called as the Wiener process. The standard basic Wiener process is shown in Fig 1.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229737.g001\n\nAs shown in Fig 1, the behavior of the variable Z can be seen by the basic Wiener process generated by R, thereby predicting that the short time interval is a change of the variable Z. Asian options, also known as average price options, are derivatives of stock options and are based on lessons learned from the implementation of options, such as real options, virtual options, and stock options. Asian options are one of the most actively traded options in the current financial derivatives market. The difference between stock options and stock options in the usual sense is the limit on the execution price, which is the average price of the stock price for a period of time before the execution date. The difference from the standard option is that when the options income is determined on the maturity date, instead of using the market price of the underlying asset at the time, the average value of the asset price marked for a certain period of the contract period is used. Such a period is called the average period. When averaging the prices, the arithmetic mean or geometric mean is used.\n\nAssuming that an Asian option is priced at K and the expiration time is T, P represents the fee payable when purchasing an option, and its calculation can be expressed as Eq (13): (13)\n\nIn the above equation, St represents the stock price at time t. However, since the currency is time-worthy, P' represents the current value of payment fees, and its calculation can be expressed as Eq (14): (14)\n\nAssuming that the option is bought at time t, P* represents the current value of payment fees, and its calculation can be expressed as Eq (15): (15)\n\nThe return of the lookback option has a certain relationship with the maximum value of the underlying asset before the maturity date. The simulation results are shown in Fig 2:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229737.g002\n\nThe pricing of fixed-looking call options and European call options is related to the strike price, while the price of the fixed-back call option is higher than the corresponding European call option. If the risk does not pose a threat, the expected yield of the stock is the risk-free rate. Therefore, the expected stock price on the maturity date will be higher than the average stock price during the effective period. At this time, the price of the floating look-up call option will be higher than the price of the corresponding Asian call option.\n\nThe value of the lookback option mainly depends on the highest or lowest price of the underlying asset that can be observed during the life of the option. In particular, there is an analytical solution to the pricing of the option under the continuous model, i.e., the lowest price or the highest price of the stock can be obtained when the continuous observation is performed. However, since the price of the underlying asset is discrete, the price under the continuous model can only be considered as an approximation of the actual price. As the frequency of observation increases, the probability of observing the extreme value increases. At this time, the price of the lookback option also shows an upward trend with the increase of the observation frequency. The Monte Carlo simulation of the European option is shown in Fig 3:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229737.g003\n\nThe Asian option differs from the standard option. In such a case, when the options income is determined on the maturity date, the average value of the asset price of a short time target within the short time of the option is used to determine the price average operation. The method is mainly to avoid malicious manipulation of stock prices, and it can also reduce the insider trading of internal employees and damage the interests of the company to a certain extent."
