        "text": "Monte Carlo Simulation Definition\n\nThe Monte Carlo Simulation, also referred to as a multiple probability simulation, is a probability model used to predict the probability of various outcomes actually occurring.\n\nDefining Monte Carlo Simulation in Simple Terms\n\nThe financial field is constantly attempting to predict outcomes. Whether it be the performance of a stock, or the viability of an individual paying back their loan, members of the financial community are always wondering what's going to happen next.\n\nUnfortunately, even the best predictions are not impenetrable to the effect of random variables. Which as a result increases the possibility of both risk and uncertainty for any financier.\n\nThe Monte Carlo Simulation then, is used to help mitigate the possibility of unpredicted outcomes.\n\nHow the Monte Carlo Simulation Works\n\nThe way the Monte Carlo Simulation works is by substituting any factor that has inherent uncertainty for a range of values, like probability distribution.\n\nSo then, rather than calculating one result the Monte Carlo Simulation can calculate hundreds even thousands of results as well as the likelihood of their occurrence depending on where they fall in the curve of the distribution.\n\nPredicting With the Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nIn finance, Monte Carlo Simulations can be used to predict the price movement of a particular stock.\n\nBy taking into account the historical data of the stock's drift and volatility, then inputting those points of data into the simulation; an analyst is then able to determine the likelihood of the stock moving one way or another in the future.\n\nBeyond Finance"
