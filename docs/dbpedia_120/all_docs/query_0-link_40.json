        "text": "In this thesis, Monte Carlo methods are elaborated in terms of the notion of the performance of games of chance and observing their out- comes based on sampling random numbers and calculating the volume of possible outcomes. The basic tool of generating random numbers is the Monte Carlo simulation. The variance reduction techniques and their applications to pricing options are also being reviewed for their crucial role in ensuring the reduction of the error occurrence in variance. More- over, the use of deterministic low-discrepancy sequences, also known as quasi-Monte Carlo methods for the valuation of complex derivative se- curities are being described. Monte Carlo simulation is a widely used tool in finance for computing the prices of options as well as their price sensitivities, which are known as Greeks. Furthermore, background about stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is introduced and defined in terms of stochastic calculus.\n\nA general purpose variance reduction technique for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimators, based on the zero-variance principle introduced in the physics literature, is proposed to evaluate the expected value, of a function f with respect to a, possibly unnormalized, probability distribution . In this context, a control variate approach, generally used for Monte Carlo simulation, is exploited by replacing"
