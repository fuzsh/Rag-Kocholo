        "text": "Financial Investment\n\nSuppose we invest $10,000 in a particular stock. We want to estimate how much money we will get in 10 years. The change of stock prices is stochastic, meaning that they change randomly. The stock returns can be treated as random events.\n\nSuppose the annual returns of this stock in the next 10 years are 0.2, 0.01, 0.3,â¦. Then by the end of the first year, we will earn an interest of $10,000Ã0.2 = $2,000 and our total balance will be $10,000 + $2,000 = $12,000 = $10,000Ã(1+0.2). By the end of the second year, we will earn an interest of $12,000Ã0.01 = $120 and our total balance will be $12,000 + $120 = $12,120 = $10,000Ã(1+0.2)Ã(1+0.01). Doing the same calculation for the third year, we find our total balance will be $10,000Ã(1+0.2)Ã(1+0.01)Ã(1+0.3) = $15,756. In general, if the annual return rates in the next 10 years are \\(r_1, r_2, \\cdots, r_{10}\\), the total amount of money we will get (including our initial $10,000) is \\[A = P (1+r_1)(1+r_2)\\cdots (1+r_{10}) = P \\prod_{i=1}^{10} (1+r_i)\\] where \\(P=\\)$10,000 is the initial amount of money we invest in the stock. To simulate the possible outcomes in 10 years, we need to build a model for the annual return rates."
