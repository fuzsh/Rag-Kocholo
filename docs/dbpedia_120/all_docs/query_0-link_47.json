This course introduces the fundamentals of computer-based simulation techniques used in computational finance and economics. The major categories of simulation methods include Discrete-event simulation, Monte Carlo simulation, and Agent-based simulation. With the introduction of basic philosophy and methodology behind simulation in computational finance and economics, students will learn advanced topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Bayesian Monte Carlo, Zero Intelligent Agent Model, and Utility Optimization Agent Model. On the subject of the agent-based approach, this course will introduce a widely used agent-based modeling framework where financial market prices and information are modeled from the bottom up with large numbers of interacting agents. Students will learn simulation packages in R and RNetlogo. At the end, students will be able to formulate simulation models and perform statistical analysis, evaluation and sensitivity analysis using these tools."
