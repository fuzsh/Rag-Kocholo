        "text": "2.3. Moment Formulas\n\nFor a random vector U=(U1,â¦,Un), denote the mean by m1(U):=E[U], and the kth central moment of U by mk(U):=(E[(U1âE[U1])k],â¦,E[(UnâE[Un])k]), kâ¥2.\n\nFor a general BDLP Z, Lu (Citation2022, Lemma 1) gives formulas for the moments of Zâ(Î) in terms of the moments of Z. Combining this with (Equation2(2) X(t)=eâÎ»tX(0)+eâÎ»tâ«0teÎ»sdZ(Î»s),tâ¥0.(2) ) and conditional on X0 (or assuming it is constant), the moments of the LDOUP X are given by m1(X(t))=eâÎ»tX0+(1âeâÎ»t)m1(Z(1)),m2(X(t))=(1âeâ2Î»t2)m2(Z(1)),m3(X(t))=(1âeâ3Î»t3)m3(Z(1)),Covâ¡(Xk(t),Xl(t))=(1âeâ2Î»t2)Covâ¡(Zk(1),Zl(1)),kâ l. The stationary distribution Y of X is the distribution such that if X0=DY, then X(t)=DY for all tâ¥0. Thus, the stationary mean, which is the mean of the stationary distribution, is Î¼Â¯=E[Z(1)]. This is the level that we expect the process to return to in pairs trading.\n\nNow specializing to the case where Xâ¼OU-WVAGn(Î»,a,Î±,Î¼,Î£,Î·), and using the moment formulas for the WVAG process in Michaelsen and Szimayer (Citation2018, Remark 4 and Appdendix A.1), we have (7) E[X1(t)]=eâÎ»tX0+(1âeâÎ»t)(Î·1+Î¼1),(7) (8) Varâ¡(X1(t))=(1âeâ2Î»t2)(Î£11+Î±1Î¼12),(8) (9) Skewâ¡(X1(t))=(1âeâ3Î»t3)(3Î£11Î¼1Î±1+2Î¼13Î±12)((1âeâ2Î»t2)(Î£11+Î¼12Î±1))3/2(9) (10) Covâ¡(X1(t),X2(t))=(1âeâ2Î»t2)a((Î±1â§Î±2)Î£12+Î±1Î±2Î¼1Î¼2).(10) Furthermore, Î¼Â¯=Î¼+Î·. These formulas will be used for control variates in the Monte Carlo method. Note that (Equation7(7) E[X1(t)]=eâÎ»tX0+(1âeâÎ»t)(Î·1+Î¼1),(7) ) to (Equation9(9) Skewâ¡(X1(t))=(1âeâ3Î»t3)(3Î£11Î¼1Î±1+2Î¼13Î±12)((1âeâ2Î»t2)(Î£11+Î¼12Î±1))3/2(9) ) apply to OU-VG processes with b1=1/Î±1.\n\n4.2. Control Variates\n\nNext, we use control variates to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimators of the value function. We refer to Glasserman (Citation2003, Chapter 4) for the details of the method. Specifically, to estimate E[P], the method of control variates defines the random variable PC=PâÎ²(CâE[C]), where C is the control variate for which E[C] has an analytic representation, and Î² is chosen to minimize Varâ¡(PC), resulting in an unbiased estimator with reduced variance. Since the true value of Î² is unknown, the control variate estimator P^C is the sample mean of PC with Î² estimated by Î²^, the least squares estimator (LSE) of the slope in a linear regression where C is the regressor and P is the response variable. Note that Î²^ is also the sample estimate of the true Î².\n\nThis method can be extended to multiple control variates, and the control variate estimator is equivalent to the prediction of a linear regression. See Appendix for details.\n\nWe apply the control variate method to estimate both E[P] and E[P2] in the value function (Equation12(12) V:=V(c+,câ,d+,dâ)=E[P]âÎ³Varâ¡(P)=E[P]âÎ³E[P2]+Î³E[P]2,(12) ). Consider the control variates X(t1)âÎ¼Â¯,â¦,X(tp)âÎ¼Â¯, where 0,t1,â¦,tp are equally spaced points on [0,T]. When estimating E[P2], we include the additional control variates (X(t1)âÎ¼Â¯)2,â¦,(X(tp)âÎ¼Â¯)2. Note that E[X(t)âÎ¼Â¯] and E[(X(t)âÎ¼Â¯)2] can be analytically computed using (Equation7(7) E[X1(t)]=eâÎ»tX0+(1âeâÎ»t)(Î·1+Î¼1),(7) ) and (Equation8(8) Varâ¡(X1(t))=(1âeâ2Î»t2)(Î£11+Î±1Î¼12),(8) ).\n\nFurther, we may want to consider the event of entering and exiting a trade, and the event of entering and not exiting over the observations X(t1),â¦,X(tp) as additional control variates to approximate the indicator variable appearing in the profit function (Equation11(11) P:=P(c+,câ,d+,dâ)=1{Ïd+â¤Ïdâ}eârÏc+(X(Ïd+)âX(Ïc+))+1{Ïd+>Ïdâ}eârÏcâ(X(Ïcâ)âX(Ïdâ)).(11) ). But the event that X(t1),â¦,X(tp) passes some level cannot be computed analytically for use as a control variate. Instead, the probability of a related event using the iid sequence of innovations Zâ(Î)(i), i=1,â¦,p can be. Specifically, this motivates the inclusion of two additional control variates 1A and 1B. Define A as the event that Zâ(Î)(1),â¦,Zâ(Î)(p) âenters a tradeâ (even though there is no actual trading on this sequence) by passing the level eÎ»Î(Î¼Â¯+d)âÎ¼Â¯ or eÎ»Î(Î¼Â¯âd)âÎ¼Â¯ and then âexits the tradeâ by passing the level eÎ»Î(Î¼Â¯+c)âÎ¼Â¯ or eÎ»Î(Î¼Â¯âc)âÎ¼Â¯, respectively.\n\nThe modified levels for Zâ(Î)(i) are the levels such that X(ti)=eâÎ»Î(X(tiâ1)+Zâ(Î)(i)) passes the entry levels Î¼Â±d when X(tiâ1)=Î¼Â¯, and similarly for the exit levels. Further, B is the same as A except without exit. Thus, A and B are the events that Zâ(Î)(i), i=1,â¦,p, enters and exits these modified levels, and enters and does not exit, respectively. Due to collinearity, the complementary event that the sequence does not enter is not included, and if p = 1, the event A, which has probability 0, is also not included. We have expressed this for symmetric levels c=c+=câ and d=d+=dâ, but this can be modified in an obvious way for the asymmetric case.\n\nSince Zâ(Î)(i), i=1,â¦,p, are iid, we can compute the probabilities of A and B since we can compute P(Zâ(Î)â¤x) by applying the Fourier inversion to the characteristic function of Zâ(Î) determined by (Equation3(3) Î¨Zâ(Î)(Î¸)=â«0Î»ÎÎ¨Z(etÎ¸)dt,Î¸âRn,(3) ). The Fourier inversion methodology is described in Michaelsen and Szimayer (Citation2018, Section 4.1).\n\n4.3. Variance Reduction\n\nConsider the two separate linear regression models, (13) Y1=X1Î²1+Ïµ1,Y2=X2Î²2+Ïµ2,(13) where Y1 and Y2 are the vector of m simulated values of P and P2, respectively. In this section only, we let X1âR(p1+1)Ãm and X2âR(p2+1)Ãm be the design matrices, including an intercept. As outlined in Section 4.2, X1 includes the control variates X(ti)âÎ¼Â¯, i=1,â¦,p, 1A, 1B, and X2 includes the control variates in X1 in addition to (X(ti)âÎ¼Â¯)2, i=1,â¦,p. Since each simulated sample path of the LDOUP is independent, we have Covâ¡(Ïµi)=Î£Ïµ,iiI, i = 1, 2 and Covâ¡(Ïµ1,Ïµ2)=Î£Ïµ,12I for some 2Ã2 covariance matrix Î£Ïµ=(Î£Ïµ,ij)i,j=12, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nFor each of the linear regression models, i = 1, 2, let Î¼C,i be the mean vector of the control variates computed as outlined in Section 4.2, then the predictions xi=(1,Î¼C,i) are Y^i=xiâ²Î²^i. As explained in Appendix, the control variate estimators of E[P] and E[P2] are the predictions Y^1 and Y^2, respectively. Thus, for each argument, the control variate estimator of the value function in (Equation12(12) V:=V(c+,câ,d+,dâ)=E[P]âÎ³Varâ¡(P)=E[P]âÎ³E[P2]+Î³E[P]2,(12) ) is V^C:=Y^1âÎ³Y^2+Î³Y^12=bâ²Y^+Y^â²AY^, where A=(Î³000),b=(1âÎ³),Y^=(Y^1Y^2). Let YÂ¯1,YÂ¯2 be the sample mean of Y1,Y2 respectively, then V^M:=YÂ¯1âÎ³YÂ¯2+Î³YÂ¯12 is the corresponding Monte Carlo estimator of the value function.\n\nGiven that our approach involves parameters that are estimated by a function of two control variate estimators, rather than the usual situation of only one, we now derive the variance reduction factor in this context. For a large number of Monte Carlo simulations m, the asymptotic normality of the LSE gives Y^â¼N(Î¼C,Î£C) approximately for some Î¼CâR2 and Î£CâR2Ã2. Using results on multivariate linear regression, and the law of total variance, noting that X1 and X2 are random, we have Î¼C=(x1â²Î²1x2â²Î²2),Î£C=(Î£Ïµ,11x1â²E[(X1â²X1)â1]x1Î£Ïµ,12x1â²E[(X1â²X1)â1X1â²X2(X2â²X2)â1]x2âÎ£Ïµ,22x2â²E[(X2â²X2)â1]x2), where â denotes the rest of the matrix is completed by symmetry. By the plug-in principle, these parameters are estimated using Î¼^C=(x1â²Î²^1x2â²Î²^2),Î£^C=(Î£^Ïµ,11x1â²(X1â²X1)â1x1Î£^Ïµ,12x1â²(X1â²X1)â1X1â²X2(X2â²X2)â1x2âÎ£^Ïµ,22x2â²(X2â²X2)â1x2), where Î£Ïµ,ij is estimated using Î£^Ïµ,ij=Ïµ^iâ²Ïµ^jmârâ1, and Ïµ^1,Ïµ^2 are the residuals from the linear regressions in (Equation13(13) Y1=X1Î²1+Ïµ1,Y2=X2Î²2+Ïµ2,(13) ), r=p1 for i = j = 1, and r=p2 otherwise.\n\nNow since V^C is a quadratic form in Y^, and Y^â¼N(Î¼C,Î£C) holds approximately for large m, by Rencher and Schaalje (Citation2008, Theorem 5.2câd), the variance of the control variate estimator is (14) Varâ¡(V^C)âbâ²Î£Cb+2trâ¡((AÎ£C)2)+4Î¼â²AÎ£CAÎ¼C+4bâ²Î£CAÎ¼C=(1+4Î¼C,1Î³+4(Î¼C,1)2Î³2)Î£C,11+2Î³2(Î£C,11)2â2Î³(1+2Î¼C,1Î³)Î£C,12+Î³2Î£C,22.(14) Then estimated variance Var^(V^C) is obtained by replacing Î¼C and Î£C with Î¼^C and Î£^C, respectively. By the asymptotic normality of V^M, (Equation14(14) Varâ¡(V^C)âbâ²Î£Cb+2trâ¡((AÎ£C)2)+4Î¼â²AÎ£CAÎ¼C+4bâ²Î£CAÎ¼C=(1+4Î¼C,1Î³+4(Î¼C,1)2Î³2)Î£C,11+2Î³2(Î£C,11)2â2Î³(1+2Î¼C,1Î³)Î£C,12+Î³2Î£C,22.(14) ) is also used to compute Var^(V^M) by replacing Î¼^C and Î£^C with Î¼^M=(YÂ¯1,YÂ¯2) and Î£^M=Î£^Y/m, respectively, where Î£^YâR2Ã2 with the sample covariance Cov^(Yi,Yj) as its (i,j)-entry.\n\nThus, the estimated variance reduction factor of using control variates relative to Monte Carlo without control variates is R=Var^(V^C)Var^(V^M). In the context of a single parameter estimated using control variates, while the true variance reduction factor using the true value of Î²i is no greater than 1, when using LSE Î²^i instead, R>1 is possible. This topic is discussed in Glasserman (Citation2003, Section 4.1.3).\n\n5.1. Effect of Control Variates\n\nConsider two examples using control variates.\n\nExample 5.1\n\nSuppose the spread X has parameters (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(1,1,â0.5,0.015,0.5), and Î³=0.1. The number of time points p used in the control variate method can be chosen to obtain the optimal variance reduction factor, however, this also depends on the entry level d. We optimize this iteratively by using no control variates to optimize d, then use this value of d to optimize p with the resulting optimal value denoted pâ. Doing this, Figure shows that for d = 1.086, the optimal number of time points for the control variates is pâ=130 when searching over p=10,20,â¦,200. This gives a moderate optimal variance reduction factor of Râ=0.735.\n\nEstimated variance reduction factor R as a function of the number of time points for the control variates p. The parameters are (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(1,1,â0.5,0.015,0.5), X0=0, Î³=0.1, r = 0.01.\n\nUsing pâ=130, Figure shows the estimate of the value function V(d), which has optimal entry level dâ=1.086. The control variate reduces Varâ¡(V^C), however, it does not change the optimal entry level dâ in this example because the variability is already quite low, in fact, the coefficient of variation of V^C(dâ), the estimate of V(dâ) conditional on dâ, is 0.0038 after control variates.\n\nThe estimate V^C(d) of the value function V(d) and the optimal entry level dâ=1.086. The parameters are (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(1,1,â0.5,0.015,0.5), X0=0, Î³=0.1, r = 0.01.\n\nDifferent choices in the parameters result in different variance reductions. In Table , results are shown varying b,Î¼ (which also affects Î·), and for the parameters, decreasing b>0 increases Râ, while decreasing Î¼<0 reduces and then increases Râ.\n\nConsider the case shown in the second row of Table where (b,Î¼)=(2,â0.05) and pâ=120. Surprisingly, for large Î³, such as Î³=1.5, it is possible that the control variate method reduces the variance of the estimator of E[P] with an estimated variance reduction factor 0.910, and E[P2] with estimated variance reduction factor 0.816, but increases the variance of the estimator of V(dâ)=E[P]âÎ³E[P2]+Î³E[P]2 with variance reduction factor 1.139. In comparison, when Î³=0.1, this does not occur, and those estimated variance reduction factors are 0.892, 0.793, 0.904, respectively.\n\nExample 5.2\n\nWe use the same setup as Example 5.1, except X now has parameters (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(0.01,50,0.5,4,â0.5). Since Î»â0, this process has little mean reversion, and is close in law to a variance gamma process, so the value function is estimated with a relatively large amount of simulation error as shown in Figure . To address this, a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess) smoother is applied to the estimated value function before maximizing it. Then the optimal entry level is dâ=0.506 without using control variates, and dâ=0.456 using the optimal number of control variates, which is pâ=1. The optimal variance reduction factor is Râ=0.817 and the coefficient of variation of V^C(dâ) is 0.0281, which is consistent with the much larger variability of the estimated value function compared to Example 5.1, Figure . Unlike in Figure , using control variates here has an effect on the estimate of dâ, the size of this effect varies with the simulation. Note that Râ is the variance reduction of estimating V(d) for fixed d using control variates, and the method is not designed to reduce the standard error of dâ, although reducing the former should be expected to reduce the latter. For these optimal values, only 63.91% of simulations resulted in a trade that is entered and exited before the terminal time due to the slow mean reversion, compared to 90.88% in Figure .\n\nThe estimate of the value function V(d) (solid lines) and the corresponding loess smooth (dashed lines) with (red lines) and without (black lines) control variates. The optimal entry level is dâ=0.506 without using control variates, and dâ=0.456 using the optimal number of control variates pâ=1. The parameters are (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(0.01,50,0.5,4,â0.5), X0=0, Î³=0.1, r = 0.01.\n\n5.3. Exit Level Different From the Mean\n\nRecall that we set c=c+=câ for simplicity. So far, we have set c = 0. However, it is possible to find examples where câ is much greater than 0. Such a situation can occur when X0>Î¼Â¯ and the discount rate r is very large. Let X0=0.25 and r = 1 while the other parameters are as before with (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(1,5,0,0.015,0). We optimize c, d for 0<c<d, and find that the optimal exit level is câ=0.105, while the optimal entry level dâ is any value câ<dâ<0.25 as shown in Figure , which plots the estimate of the value function V(c,d).\n\nThe estimate of the value function V(c,d) with entry level d and exit level c. The parameters are (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(1,5,0,0.015,0), X0=0.25, Î³=0, r = 1.\n\nThus, the pairs trading strategy is to enter the trade immediately, and because the large discount rate greatly reduces the profit if the trade is not exited quickly, the trade is exited at câ=0.105 above the stationary mean Î¼Â¯ rather than waiting for it to fall to Î¼Â¯.\n\nFigure shows how the optimal exit level câ changes for different values of the discount rate r. For the plotted values, the point at which câ>0.000 (to 3 decimal places) is r = 0.3. For all these plotted values of r, if the initial value is instead set to X0=Î¼Â¯=0, then the optimal exit level would be câ=0.000. This demonstrates how having an initial value different from the stationary mean and a large discount rate can make the optimal exit level câ different from 0. It is difficult to find other situations where this occurs, which suggests optimizing c may have little benefit beyond this, and fixing c = 0, which corresponds to exiting the trade when the spread passes Î¼Â¯, simplifies the optimization.\n\nThe optimal exit level câ for various value of discount rate r=0.01,0.1,0.2,â¦,1.5. The other parameters are (Î»,b,Î¼,Ï2,Î·)=(1,5,0,0.015,0), X0=0.25, Î³=0.\n\n6.1. Paris Trading Problem\n\nWhile there are many ways to set up a pairs trading strategy on multiple spreads, we use the following setup to generalize the notion of one trade cycle used in the univariate setting. A trade is entered for the first time that either spread Xk is above Î¼Â¯k+dk or below Î¼Â¯kâdk for k = 1, 2. If a trade on spread Xk is entered, then exit occurs when the spread passes Î¼Â¯k+ck or Î¼Â¯kâck, respectively. When a trade is entered, no further trades can be initiated, even if the other spread later passes the entry level.\n\nMore generally, it is possible to have asymmetric entry and exit levels for both spreads, where d+,1, dâ,1 are the levels for entering a trade on spread X1 from the positive and negative sides, respectively, and similarly for the other entry and exit levels. For each spread k = 1, 2, there are 8 relevant passage times defined by Ïd+,k=inf{tâ¥0:Xk(t)>Î¼Â¯k+d+,k}â§T,Ïc+,k=inf{tâ¥Ïd+,k:Xk(t)<Î¼Â¯k+c+,k}â§T,Ïdâ,k=inf{tâ¥0:Xk(t)<Î¼Â¯kâdâ,k}â§T,Ïcâ,k=inf{tâ¥Ïdâ,k:Xk(t)>Î¼Â¯kâcâ,k}â§T, with 0â¤cÂ±,k<dÂ±,k. However, we will not need to use this much generality in the examples below.\n\nThe nonzero probability of common jumps for the WVAG process used as the BDLP, and hence for X, means that the event {Ïd+,1=Ïd+,2} also has nonzero probability, that is, both spreads can pass their corresponding entry levels simultaneously. In this case, we invest with 50% weight in each of the spreads. An alternative approach would be to invest fully in the spread furthest from the mean-reverting level. However, in the numerical examples we consider below, both approaches produce virtually the same results, since it is rare that both spreads pass the optimal entry levels simultaneously. Therefore, we will only consider the former approach.\n\nLet Ï=min{Ïd+,1,Ïdâ,1,Ïd+,2,Ïdâ,2}, c=(c+,1,câ,1,c+,2,câ,2) and d=(d+,1,dâ,1,d+,2,dâ,2). The profit over one trade cycle is given by P:=P(c,d)=1{Ïâ{d+,1,d+,2}}âk=1,2eârÏc+,kWk(Xk(Ïd+,k)âXk(Ïc+,k))+1{Ïâ{dâ,1,dâ,2}}âk=1,2eârÏcâ,kWk(Xk(Ïcâ,k)âXk(Ïdâ,k)), where the weights are (W1,W2)={(1,0)ifÏd+,1<Ïd+,2orÏdâ,1<Ïdâ,2,(0,1)ifÏd+,1>Ïd+,2orÏdâ,1>Ïdâ,2,(0.5,0.5)otherwise, and r is the discount rate.\n\nThe objective function is the value function V(c,d)=E[P]âÎ³Varâ¡(P),Î³â¥0. We want to find the optimal level c,d for the pairs trading strategy to maximize the value function, that is maxc,dV(c,d).\n\n6.3. Numerical Implementation and Analysis\n\nWe consider two examples of bivariate pairs trading on the spread Xâ¼OU-WVAG2(Î»,a,Î±,Î¼,Î£,Î·) simulated using the approximate method above with stepsizes Î=0.01 and Î~=0.001, and terminal time T = 50. In all cases, the initial value is X0=0, Î³=0, we do not consider control variates, and Î¼=âÎ· so that Î¼Â¯=0. Unless stated otherwise, we assume for simplicity that the entry levels are symmetric with dk=d+,k=dâ,k, k = 1, 2, and the exit levels are c=0, so we optimize the value function over d1,d2. We use m = 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nIn our numerical examples, we explore the effect of correlation on the optimal entry level and the optimal expected profit. In the first example, the correlation has little effect, whereas in the second example, it has a larger effect. The correlation of the components of X is in part controlled by the correlation parameter Ï=Î£12/Î£11Î£22. However, note that Ï is the correlation of the Brownian motion subordinate in (Equation6(6) Z=DBâT,(6) ), and is related to the correlation of the components of X by (15) Corrâ¡(X1(t),X2(t))=Corrâ¡(Z1(t),Z2(t))=a((Î±1â§Î±2)Î£12+Î±1Î±2Î¼1Î¼2)Î£11+Î±1Î¼12Î£22+Î±2Î¼22(15) for all t>0, due to (Equation10(10) Covâ¡(X1(t),X2(t))=(1âeâ2Î»t2)a((Î±1â§Î±2)Î£12+Î±1Î±2Î¼1Î¼2).(10) ) and (Equation8(8) Varâ¡(X1(t))=(1âeâ2Î»t2)(Î£11+Î±1Î¼12),(8) ).\n\nExample 6.1\n\nLet (16) Î»=1,a=2.5,Î±=(0.20.3),Î¼=(0â0.2),Î£=(0.015ÏÎ£11Î£22â0.02),(16) and r = 0.01.\n\nTable shows the optimal entry levels d1â and d2â, the optimal expected profit V^M(d1â,d2â), and the estimated probability of which spread is traded, and each of these quantities is approximately equal across the values of Ï considered.\n\nWhen pairs trading on the univariate spreads X1 and X2, the optimal expected profit is 0.227 (see the second row of Table ) and 0.331 respectively, while it is 0.334â0.336 in this bivariate pairs trading example. Bivariate pairs trading is more profitable than univariate pairs trading on either spread, although it is approximately as profitable as trading only X2 since this accounts for 79â84% of trades. The optimal expected profit of the bivariate pairs trade must be at least that of the best univariate pairs trade, as the latter strategy can be implemented within bivariate pairs trading by setting the other spread to have an arbitrarily large optimal entry level. Indeed, this is happening to some extent here as the optimal entry level of the spread X1 has increased from 0.220 in the univariate case to 0.305â0.318 in the bivariate case. Thus, this decreases the probability of only X1 entering a trade from 96.79% to 11â16% in Table (the latter accounts for the probability that a trade on X1 fails to be entered because a trade on X2 is entered first, while the former is univariate pairs trading and does not include this). So in this example, the method has essentially identified that X2 is the more profitable spread, regardless of correlation, and has accordingly increased the optimal entry level of X1 to reduce the instances where it is traded.\n\nExample 6.2\n\nNow we consider an example where different values of the correlation parameter Ï can have a larger effect on the optimal entry level and optimal expected profit. Suppose the parameters are now (17) Î»=1,a=6.65,Î±=(0.150.15),Î¼=0,Î£=(0.015ÏÎ£11Î£22â0.015),(17) and r = 1.\n\nRecall the parameter boundary a<1Î±1â§1Î±2. In Example 6.1, the upper bound of Corrâ¡(X1(t),X2(t)) as a function of Ïâ(â1,1) is 0.395 by (Equation15(15) Corrâ¡(X1(t),X2(t))=Corrâ¡(Z1(t),Z2(t))=a((Î±1â§Î±2)Î£12+Î±1Î±2Î¼1Î¼2)Î£11+Î±1Î¼12Î£22+Î±2Î¼22(15) ). The upper bound converges to 1 as aâ1Î±k while keeping Î±k,Î¼k,Î£kk,Î·k constant for all k. Since aâ1Î±1=1Î±2 here, this example represents monitoring two spreads X1=DX2 that are equal in law for each fixed Ï, with X1 and X2 converging pathwisely as Ïâ1, since in the limit, Corrâ¡(X1(t),X2(t))=1 for all t with X0=0. Also, appealing to the symmetry of X(t) for each fixed t, all components of the optimal entry levels dâ are equal to dâ, say. Thus, we optimize over d, the symmetric entry level for all components.\n\nTable shows the results for this example over different values of Ï. Here, the optimal expected profit V^M(dâ) increases from 0.032 to 0.040 as Ï decreases from 0.99 to 0, this represents a 26% increase in the optimal expected profit. The case where Ï=0.99 is approximately the case of univariate pairs trading, which occurs in the limit as Ïâ1. Since V^M(dâ) is larger when Ï is much less than 1, the results demonstrate a situation where bivariate pairs trading is much more profitable than what is effectively pairs trading on a single spread, and where correlation has a larger effect.\n\nThese results are consistent with intuition. Monitoring multiple spreads of the same law presents additional opportunities to enter into the trade sooner, which increases the optimal expected profit relative to monitoring only one spread, while having a larger discount rate r substantially rewards entering the trade sooner. Thus, in this example, using bivariate pairs trading by choosing pairs that are uncorrelated (as represented by the Ï=0 case) is much more profitable than either univariate pairs trading or choosing highly correlated spreads (both represented by the Ïâ1 case)."
