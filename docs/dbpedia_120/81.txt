Monte Carlo methods are used in many application areas, including: finance, bioinformatics, computer graphics, discrete event simulation, physics, and statistical inference. Regarding graphics, there have been at least two technical Oscars awarded for Monte Carlo methods and one for quasi-Monte Carlo. This is a course on Monte Carlo as its own subject, so the application areas are used to motivate the ideas of Monte Carlo.

We will cover a broad selection of topics, touching on some applications, and on recent developments in Markov chain Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo.

Here is a list of topics. Last time we were able to cover almost all of them. The online text is more developed than last time. So I plan to bring in more advanced material. If time permits I will add some sequential Monte Carlo.
