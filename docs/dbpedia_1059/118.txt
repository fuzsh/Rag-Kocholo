The Home Fleets were the Royal Navy's unified home commands in British waters from 1912 to 1914.

History

On 29 March, 1912, a new organisation of the fleet was announced, to come into force on 1 May. The former Home Fleet, which had been organised in four divisions, was divided into the First, Second and Third Fleets of the new Home Fleets. Ships in the First Fleet would be in permanent commission with full crews; ships in the Second Fleet would be kept in commission with nucleus crews, and receiving full complements of active service ratings on mobilisation; ships in the Third Fleet would remain in commission with reduced nucleus crews or in "Matériel Reserve" and requiring reservists on mobilisation. The whole fleet came under the command of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleets.[1]

Initially, the three fleets of the Home Fleets comprised eight Squadrons, each squadron consisting of a Battle Squadron and a Cruiser Squadron and attached ships, numbered consecutively. The First and Second Divisions of the former Home Fleet became the First and Second Squadrons. The Atlantic Fleet became the Third Squadron. Provision was made for the formation of a Fourth Squadron at a later date. These comprised the First Fleet. The Third Division of the Home Fleet became the Fifth and Sixth Squadrons of the Second Fleet. The Fourth Division became the Seventh and Eighth Squadrons and the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Cruiser Squadrons of the Third Fleet.[1]

The Home Fleets ceased to exist when the Grand Fleet was constituted on the eve of war in August, 1914.
