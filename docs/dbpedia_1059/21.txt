The Kilrathi Home Fleet was also known as the First Fleet of the Claw in the Kilrathi military command structure. The Home Fleet was the personnel fleet of the Emperor of Kilrah and the naval arm of the Imperial Guards or the "Drakhai". With the fleet there were several Drakhai infantry units for the personal protection of Emperor and members of the Kiranka Royal House such as Crown Prince Thrakkath. Only the elite were recruited to the Drakhai with each pilot applicant requiring eight Confederation kills in order to be accepted and to be assigned to the Imperial Guard was considered a high honor.

Once the Kilrathi gained space flight Kilrah had become the sole property of the Emperor and the ruling Kiranka clan. The Home Fleet was as much a political tool as it was a military weapon. It protected the Emperor from enemies, both foreign and domestic, and his seat of power on Kilrah. In situations of cultural importance the Home Fleet could be deployed to participate in combat operations.

During the Terran-Kilrathi War, the Home Fleet was deployed for the Sivar-Eshrad Ceremony on Firekka in 2655.293. It was also deployed in 2667 to counter the Confederation's invasion and false occupation of Vukar Tag. All ten carriers of the Home Fleet and several legions of Imperial Marines were sent to avenge the honor of the Emperor's dowager mother Graknala whose ancestral home was destroyed during the invasion. This deployment resulted in the Battle of Vukar Tag and the First Battle of Kilrah. In both engagements the Kilrathi suffered heavily. At Vukar Tag five of the seven carriers involved were destroyed by the Confederation while two more were heavily damaged, four Imperial Legions were completely annihilated and Kalralahr of Fleets Rusmak and Kalralahr of the Imperial Legions Gar were killed.
