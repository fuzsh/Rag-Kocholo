        "text": "Welcome to the 13th Coast Guard District!\n\nWe, the men and women of the Thirteenth Coast Guard District, provide critical maritime services within the Pacific Northwest. Our missions - maritime security, safety, and national defense - require superior professionalism, devotion to excellence and the highest standards of integrity. We pride ourselves in treating others with respect and dignity, facilitating partnerships with local, state and national agencies, and being innovative in our approach to meeting the region's needs.\n\nAbout\n\nThe Coast Guard 13th District comprises the Pacific Northwest and is the gateway to the North Pacific and Alaska. D13's Area of Responsibility encompasses four states and the entire Pacific Northwest coast. We also share a border with Canada to the north and California to the south.\n\nThe Coast Guard first established its presence in the Pacific Northwest with the construction and operation of 16 lighthouses along the coast built between 1852 and 1858. The presence was reaffirmed in 1854 with the entry of the Revenue Cutter Jefferson Davis to Puget Sound. Today, D13's headquarters is located in Seattle with two Sector offices managing operations in their respective areas - Puget Sound, located in Seattle, Washinton and Columbia River, located in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe men and women of D13 conduct a vast array of daily operations in support of the Coast Guard's statutory missions. Our crews can be found conducting search and rescue, patrolling coast, sound and North Pacific to enforce safety and fisheries regulations, conducting safety and compliance inspections and exams on commercial vessels and waterfront facilities and protecting our nation's strategic defense and critical infrastructure.\n\nD13 is home to the largest domestic ferry system in the U.S. moving 24 million passengers and 11 million vehicles annually across 10 routes, the 3rd largest domestic port, the 3rd largest cruise ship port, and the number one grain export gateway in the U.S. through the Columbia River.\n\nD13 is made up of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. More than 3,000 active duty and reserve members, civilian employees, and Coast Guard Auxiliarists are stationed in the Pacific Northwest. D13 operational assets include 21 Cutters, 132 Boats and 11 Aircraft.\n\nD13 also provides support and a homeport to Coast Guard Pacific Area assets including three medium endurance cutters, three icebreakers, a port security unit, maritime safety and security team, and Base Seattle."
