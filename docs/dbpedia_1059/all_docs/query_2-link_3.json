Before the First World War, it consisted of the four Port Guard ships.[which?] During the First World War, it comprised some of the older ships of the Royal Navy. During the Second World War, it was the Royal Navy's main battle force in European waters.\n\nPre-First World War[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nOn 1 October 1902, the Admiral Superintendent Naval Reserves, then Vice-Admiral Gerard Noel, was given the additional appointment of Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, and allotted a rear-admiral to serve under him as commander of the Home Squadron.[2] \"... the nucleus of the Home Fleet would consist of the four Port Guard ships, which would be withdrawn from their various scattered dockyards and turned into a unified and permanent sea-going command – the Home Squadron – based on Portland. Also under the direction of the commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet would be the Coast Guard ships, which would continue to be berthed for the most part in their respective district harbours in order to carry out their local duties, but would join the Home Squadron for sea work at least three times per year, at which point the assembled force – the Home Squadron and the Coast Guard vessels – would be known collectively as the Home Fleet.\"[3] Rear-Admiral George Atkinson-Willes was Second-in-Command of the Home Fleet, with his flag in the battleship HMS Empress of India, at this time.[4] In May 1903 Noel was succeeded as Commander-in-Chief by Vice-Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson.[5]\n\nOn 14 December 1904, the Channel Fleet was re-styled the Atlantic Fleet and the Home Fleet became the Channel Fleet.[6] In 1907, the Home Fleet was reformed with Vice-Admiral Francis Bridgeman in command, succeeded by Admiral Sir William May in 1909. Bridgeman took command again in 1911, and in the same year was succeeded by Admiral Sir George Callaghan. On 29 March 1912, a new structure of the fleet was announced, which came into force on 1 May 1912. The former Home Fleet, which was organised into four divisions, was divided into the First, Second and Third Fleets as Home Fleets.[7] The Home Fleets were the Navy's unified home commands in British waters from 1912 to 1914.[8] On 4 August 1914, as the First World War was breaking out, John Jellicoe was ordered to take command of the Fleet, which by his appointment order was renamed the Grand Fleet.\n\nAdmirals commanding[]\n\nPost holders during the pre-war period were:'[9]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet [10] 1 Vice-Admiral Sir Gerard Noel 1 October 1902 – 21 May 1903 2 Vice-Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson 21 May 1903–31, December, 1904\n\nNote: There was no Home Fleet between 1905 and 1907 remaining ships at a lesser state of readiness were split into 3 divisions: Devonport Division, Nore Division, and Portsmouth Division [11]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet [12] 1 Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman 5 March 1907 – 24 March 1909 2 Vice-Admiral Sir William May 24 March 1909 – 1911 3 Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman 25 March 1911 – 5 December 1911 4 Vice-Admiral Sir George Callaghan 5 December 1911 – 31 July 1912\n\nOf note:The Home Fleets were a new organisation of the Royal Navy's unified home commands (First, Second, Third, Fleets) instituted on 31 July 1912 to December 1914.

The Home Fleet comprised the flagship Nelson leading a force that included the 2nd Battle Squadron (five more battleships), the Battlecruiser Squadron (Hood and Renown), the 2nd Cruiser Squadron (Vice-Admiral Edward Astley-Rushton), CB, CMG aboard Dorsetshire (three cruisers), three destroyer flotillas (27), a submarine flotilla (six), two aircraft carriers and associated vessels.[18]\n\nAdmirals commanding[]\n\nPost holders during the inter-war period were:[19]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet 1 Admiral Sir John Kelly October, 1931-September, 1933 2 Admiral Sir William Boyle September, 1933-August, 1935 3 Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse August, 1935-April, 1938\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Home Fleet was the Royal Navy's main battle force in European waters during the Second World War. On 3 September 1939, under Admiral Forbes flying his flag in Nelson at Scapa Flow, it consisted of the 2nd Battle Squadron, the Battle Cruiser Squadron, 18th Cruiser Squadron, Rear-Admiral, Destroyers, Rear-Admiral, Submarines (2nd Submarine Flotilla, Dundee, 6th Submarine Flotilla, Blyth, Northumberland), Vice-Admiral, Aircraft Carriers (Vice-Admiral L.V. Wells, with Ark Royal, Furious, and Pegasus), and the Orkney and Shetlands force.[21] Its chief responsibility was to keep Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine from breaking out of the North Sea. For this purpose, the First World War base at Scapa Flow was reactivated as it was well placed for interceptions of ships trying to run the blockade.\n\nThe two most surprising losses of the Home Fleet during the early part of the war were the sinking of the old battleship Royal Oak by the German submarine U-47 while supposedly safe in Scapa Flow, and the loss of the pride of the Navy, the battlecruiser Hood, to the German battleship Bismarck.\n\nThe operational areas of the Home Fleet were not circumscribed, and units were detached to other zones quite freely. However, the southern parts of the North Sea and the English Channel were made separate commands for light forces, and the growing intensity of the Battle of the Atlantic led to the creation of Western Approaches Command. Only with the destruction of the German battleship Tirpitz in 1944 did the Home Fleet assume a lower priority, and most of its heavy units were withdrawn to be sent to the Far East.\n\nAdmirals commanding[]\n\nPost holders during the Second World War were:[22][23][24]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet 1 Admiral Sir Charles Forbes April, 1938-December, 1940 2 Admiral Sir John Tovey December, 1940-May, 1943 3 Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser May, 1943-June, 1944 4 Admiral Sir Henry Moore 14 June 1944 – 24 November 1945\n\nSecond in command[]\n\nPost holders included:[25]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Second-in-Command, Home Fleet 1 Vice-Admiral Sir Alban T.B.

Cunninghame Graham July 1945-October 1946\n\nPost-Second World War[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Home Fleet took back all of its peacetime responsibilities for the Royal Navy forces in home waters and also in the North and South Atlantic. With the Cold War, greater emphasis was placed on protecting the North Atlantic from the Soviet Union in concert with other countries as part of NATO. Admiral Sir Rhoderick McGrigor supervised combined Western Union exercises involving ships from the British, French, and Dutch navies in June–July 1949. Admiral McGrigor flew his flag from the aircraft carrier Implacable. Also taking part in the exercises were Victorious and Anson, along with cruisers and destroyers. During the exercise, the combined force paid a visit to Mount's Bay in Cornwall from 30 June-4 July 1949.[27]\n\nAdmiral Sir Philip Vian, who was Commander-in-Chief from 1950-1952, flew his flag in Vanguard.[28] In late 1951, Theseus joined the fleet as flagship of the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron.[29]\n\nFrom 1947 to 1957 superfluous battleships and aircraft carriers were assigned to the Home Fleet Training Squadron headquartered at Portland Dockyard to provide basic training. The carriers stationed here were mobilised as helicopter carriers for the Suez operation in 1956. In December 1951 the Admiralty authorised the creation of a new Heavy Squadron to be assigned to the Home Fleet it consisted of a battleship HMS Vanguard aircraft carriers and cruisers.[30] Its commanding officer was known as Flag Officer, Aircraft Carriers who had administrative responsibility for all the operational carriers the squadron was disbanded October 1954 [31] The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, gained an additional NATO responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic, as part of SACLANT, when the NATO military command structure was established in 1953 at the Northwood Headquarters in northwest London. The Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet still flew his flag however in Tyne at Portsmouth. During Exercise Mainbrace in 1952, NATO naval forces came together for the first time to practice the defence of northern Europe; Denmark and Norway. The resulting McMahon Act difficulties caused by potential British control of the United States Navy's attack carriers armed with nuclear weapons led to the creation of a separate Striking Fleet Atlantic, directly responsible to the commander of the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet, in his NATO position as SACLANT, by the end of 1952.[32]\n\nThe submarine tender Maidstone was the fleet's flagship in 1956. In 1960, C-in-C Home Fleet moved to Northwood, and in 1966 the NATO Channel Command (a post also held by C-in-C Home Fleet) moved to Northwood from Portsmouth.[33] In February 1963 all remaining frigate and destroyer squadrons in the Home, Mediterranean and Far East Fleets were merged into new Escort Squadrons.[34]\n\nIn April 1963, the naval unit at the Northwood Headquarters was commissioned as HMS Warrior under the command of the then Captain of the Fleet. In December 1966 all remaining squadrons in the Home Fleet were disbanded.[35] In 1967 the Home Fleet was amalgamated with the Mediterranean Fleet in 1967. With its area of responsibility greatly increased and no longer being just responsible for the defence of home waters of the UK, the name of the fleet was changed to the Western Fleet (1967-1971) and no squadrons existed in that Fleet.[36] Thus the famous, historic name of the Home Fleet was consigned to history.\n\nAdmirals commanding[]\n\nPost holders after the Second World War were:[37][38]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet 1 Admiral Sir Edward Syfret Novembe,r 1945-January, 1948 2 Admiral Sir Rhoderick McGrigor January, 1948-January, 1950 3 Admiral Sir Philip Vian January, 1950-June, 1952 4 Admiral Sir George Creasy January, 1952-January, 1954 5 Admiral Sir Michael Denny January, 1954-January, 1956 6 Admiral Sir John Eccles January, 1956-January, 1958 7 Admiral Sir William Davis January, 1958-July, 1960 8 Admiral Sir Wilfrid Woods July, 1960-January, 1963 9 Admiral Sir Charles Madden January, 1963-July, 1965 10 Admiral Sir John Frewen July, 1965-October, 1967\n\nNotes[]\n\nSources[]\n\nHeathcote, Tony (2002).
