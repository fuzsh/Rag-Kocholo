        "text": "Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 314 is the United States Marine Corps’ only operational and forward-deployed F-35C squadron. Over the past year, VMFA-314 as a Tactical Air Integration squadron, integrated with Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9) through multiple pre-deployment exercises conducting large-force missions practicing to take down the world’s most advanced integrated defenses.\n\nVMFA-314 is now underway conducting routine operations in the 3rd Fleet and 7th Fleet area of operations to support the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Combatant Commander, ensuring freedom of navigation in accordance with international law and assuring allies and partners.\n\n“VMFA-314 Marines have excelled in every step of our training. Our maintenance readiness is exceptional,” said Lt. Col. Jeffrey C. Davis, commanding officer of VMFA-314. “Our Marines are the best trained in the fleet. Our pilots are the most tactical. We will be ready for any mission our senior leaders ask of us.”\n\nVMFA-314 plans to participate in exercises with key allies and partners over the next several months, enhancing coalition interoperability and assuring security.\n\nOn July 20, Davis addressed the Marines of VMFA-314 on the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72). During this address, Davis discussed why VMFA-314’s presence is so important.\n\n“The United States is a global force for good – we promote peace and stability,” Davis said. “Our willingness to leave our homes and families to be operational at sea demonstrates our commitment to peace and prosperity. Your presence acts as a deterrent to potential adversaries who look to gain advantage over our allies and partners—the combat readiness you generate sends a clear message to those in the region. We are the best partner for peace and the strongest partner for defense.”\n\nDuring the formation, Davis awarded a special commanding officer coin to Marines who made a significant positive impact on the unit. Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Bryce Donovan and Lance Cpl. Nicholas Miller, an F-35C airframes mechanic, were recognized in front of their peers for their exceptional positive attitude and willingness to go the extra mile.\n\nVMFA 314, assigned to CVW-9 aboard the Abraham Lincoln, is underway conducting routine operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations. U.S. 7th Fleet is the U.S. Navy's largest forward-deployed numbered fleet, and routinely interacts and operates with allies and partners in preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region."
