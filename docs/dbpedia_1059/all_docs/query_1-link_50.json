        "text": "Extreme detail about Texas becoming a Texas.\n\nWhat did you love best about Lone Star Rising?\n\nThe detail. Where and how the culture of Texas was formed. There was so much I did not know and so much helped me make a lot of sense of why Texas culture is like it is today.\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nSam Houston. The book made him real. Extremely complex.\n\nWhat does Jonathan Hogan bring to the story that you wouldnâ€™t experience if you just read the book?\n\nHe read very well and with passion for a book compromising so much detail.\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nThe battle between Santa Anna and the Texans. I had no idea we were so lucky. Extreme luck.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nThis will teach Texans a lot about their history and to appreciate Tejanos a lot more.\n\nExcellent History of Texas Revolution\n\nWilliam C. Davis is one of my favorite American historians. This was a topic I knew very little about, and was not really that interested. However, Davis' book ended up being a \"page turner,\" and I felt like I had a much better understanding of the subject after finishing.\n\nMy original thoughts on the narration were that it was, \"blah,\" but no complaints really. This may be a difficult book to speed listen to but only because of the detail and the amount of names, not because of the narration.\n\nThe author gives a terrific background of the area to start off the book, one that is quite detailed and may be difficult to follow at times. The reason I say it may be hard to follow has nothing to do with Davis; it's just that the history of the territory is complex. There are so many frequent changes. Davis' recap of all of the failed revolutions prior to Mexican independence is ridiculous detailed. We're talking what seems like dozens of schemes and attempts. It's even hard to tell when Mexico actually does achieve independence.\n\nThroughout the rest of the book the listener will hear about all of those legendary names: Austin, Houston, Bowie, Crockett, et al. Once again, things are very complex and well detailed. The recounting of the battles was the portion of the book that I found most exciting. Much of the rest of the book is quite interesting, but there's a bit of a feeling of just wanting to get to the part where it's decided what the plan is.\n\nDavis covers the post-independence period and the build up to American annexation and the United States' war with Mexico.\n\nAs you would expect, Davis attempts to separate myth and legend from fact. With this particular topic, that's a difficult task, but he does a wonderful job.\n\nDisappointing\n\nI generally love history reads but this was painful. I use audible to pass the time while traveling and actually turned this off several times from frustration. Lots of detail with some of it repeated. An abridged version might be the way to go on this one. I liked the backgrounds of Travis, Houston, Austin, etc. You'll need to be a real Texas history buff to enjoy this one!"
