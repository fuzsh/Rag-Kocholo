        "text": "Former naval fleet of the Royal Navy\n\nThis article is about the British naval formation. For the American naval formation of 1838–1861, see Home Squadron. For the American naval formation of 1865–1902 sometimes called the \"Home Squadron\", see North Atlantic Squadron.\n\nHome FleetActive1902–1904, 1907–1914, 1932–1967CountryUnited KingdomBranch Royal NavyTypeFleetCommandersNotable\n\ncommandersGeorge Callaghan, John Tovey, Bruce Fraser\n\nMilitary unit\n\nThe Home Fleet was a fleet of the Royal Navy that operated from the United Kingdom's territorial waters from 1902 with intervals until 1967. In 1967, it was merged with the Mediterranean Fleet creating the new Western Fleet.\n\nBefore the First World War between 1902 and 1904 the Admiralty reorganised its ships in home waters into a permenant force called the Home Squadron.[1] At the beginning of 1905, it was renamed the Channel Fleet. In 1907 a new Home Fleet was formed from ships in reserve and new ships, and in 1909 the Channel Fleet was merged into it, forming the principal fleet in British waters. In 1912 it was renamed the Home Fleets, formed of the First, Second and Third. On the outbreak of the First World War the First Fleet became the Grand Fleet. When the Grand Fleet was redistributed after the war, the reserve fleet was briefly named Home Fleet in 1919 before being renamed, and after the Invergordon Mutiny in 1931 the Atlantic Fleet was renamed Home Fleet in 1932. During the Second World War, it was the Royal Navy's main battle force in European waters.\n\nPre-First World War\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the first years of the 20th century, the Royal Navy had four 'Port Guard' ships, stationed in the major naval bases, partially to act as flagships for the admirals commanding at those ports.[3] These vessels appear to have been stationed at the Nore, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, as well as one other major base.[which?]\n\nOn 1 October 1902, the Admiral Superintendent Naval Reserves, then Vice-Admiral Gerard Noel, was given the additional appointment of Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, and allotted a rear-admiral to serve under him as commander of the Home Squadron.[4] \"... the nucleus of the Home Fleet would consist of the four Port Guard ships, which would be withdrawn from their various scattered dockyards and turned into a unified and permanent sea-going command – the Home Squadron – based on Portland. Also under the direction of the commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet would be the Coast Guard ships, which would continue to be berthed for the most part in their respective district harbours in order to carry out their local duties, but would join the Home Squadron for sea work at least three times per year, at which point the assembled force – the Home Squadron and the Coast Guard vessels – would be known collectively as the Home Fleet.\"[5] Rear-Admiral George Atkinson-Willes was Second-in-Command of the Home Fleet, with his flag in the battleship HMS Empress of India, at this time.[6] In May 1903 Noel was succeeded as Commander-in-Chief by Vice-Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson.[7]\n\nOn 14 December 1904, the Channel Fleet was re-styled the Atlantic Fleet and the Home Fleet became the Channel Fleet. In 1907, the Home Fleet was reformed with Vice-Admiral Francis Bridgeman in command, succeeded by Admiral Sir William May in 1909. Bridgeman took command again in 1911, and in the same year was succeeded by Admiral Sir George Callaghan. On 29 March 1912, a new structure of the fleet was announced, which came into force on 1 May 1912. The former Home Fleet, which was organised into four divisions, was divided into the First, Second and Third Fleets as Home Fleets.[8] The Home Fleets were the Navy's unified home commands in British waters from 1912 to 1914.[8] On 4 August 1914, as the First World War was breaking out, John Jellicoe was ordered to take command of the Fleet, which by his appointment order was renamed the Grand Fleet.\n\nCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nPost holders during the pre-war period were:'[9]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet[10] 1 Vice-Admiral Sir Gerard Noel 1 October 1902 – 21 May 1903 2 Vice-Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson 21 May 1903 – 31 December 1904\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet[10] 1 Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman 5 March 1907 – 24 March 1909 2 Vice-Admiral Sir William May 24 March 1909 – 1911 3 Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman 25 March 1911 – 5 December 1911 4 Vice-Admiral Sir George Callaghan 5 December 1911 – 31 July 1912\n\nSecond in command\n\n[edit]\n\nPost holders included:[11]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Second-in-Command, Home Fleet 1 Rear-Admiral George L.

The Home Fleet comprised the flagship Nelson leading a force that included the 2nd Battle Squadron (five more battleships), the Battlecruiser Squadron (Hood and Renown), the 2nd Cruiser Squadron (Vice-Admiral Edward Astley-Rushton) aboard Dorsetshire (three cruisers), three destroyer flotillas (27), a submarine flotilla (six), two aircraft carriers and associated vessels.[16]\n\nCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nPost holders during the inter-war period were:[17]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet 1 Admiral Sir John Kelly October 1931 – September 1933 2 Admiral Sir William Boyle September 1933 – August 1935 3 Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse August 1935 – April 1938\n\nSecond World War\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Home Fleet was the Royal Navy's main battle force in European waters during the Second World War. On 3 September 1939, under Admiral Forbes flying his flag in Nelson at Scapa Flow, it consisted of the 2nd Battle Squadron, the Battle Cruiser Squadron, 18th Cruiser Squadron, Rear-Admiral, Destroyers, Rear-Admiral, Submarines (2nd Submarine Flotilla, Dundee, 6th Submarine Flotilla, Blyth, Northumberland), Vice-Admiral, Aircraft Carriers (Vice-Admiral L. V. Wells, with Ark Royal, Furious, and Pegasus), and the Orkney and Shetlands force.[19] Its chief responsibility was to keep Germany's Kriegsmarine from breaking out of the North Sea. For this purpose, the First World War base at Scapa Flow was reactivated as it was well placed for interceptions of ships trying to run the blockade.\n\nThe two most surprising losses of the Home Fleet during the early part of the war were the sinking of the old battleship Royal Oak by the German submarine U-47 while supposedly safe in Scapa Flow, and the loss of the pride of the Navy, the battlecruiser Hood, to the German battleship Bismarck. 2nd Battle Squadron under Admiral Blagrove was effectively disestablished when he died in the sinking of Royal Oak.\n\nThe operational areas of the Home Fleet were not circumscribed, and units were detached to other zones quite freely. However, the southern parts of the North Sea and the English Channel were made separate commands for light forces, and the growing intensity of the Battle of the Atlantic led to the creation of Western Approaches Command. Only with the destruction of the German battleship Tirpitz in 1944 did the Home Fleet assume a lower priority, and most of its heavy units were withdrawn to be sent to the Far East.\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commanders-in-Chief, Home Fleet, 1938–1945 1 Admiral Sir Charles Forbes April 1938 – December 1940 2 Admiral Sir John Tovey December 1940 – May 1943 3 Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser May 1943 – June 1944 4 Admiral Sir Henry Moore 14 June 1944 – 24 November 1945\n\nPost holder sources for the Second World War:[20][21][22]\n\nSecond in command\n\n[edit]\n\nPost holders included:[23]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Second-in-Command, Home Fleet 1 Vice-Admiral Sir Alban T.

Dalrymple-Hamilton June 1944 – April 1945 5 Vice-Admiral Sir Rhoderick R. McGrigor April – July 1945 6 Vice-Admiral Sir Angus E. M. B. Cunninghame Graham July 1945 – October 1946\n\nPost-Second World War\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the Cold War began, greater emphasis was placed on protecting the North Atlantic sea lanes from the Soviet Union in concert with other Western countries. Admiral Sir Rhoderick McGrigor supervised combined Western Union exercises involving ships from the British, French, and Dutch navies in June–July 1949. Admiral McGrigor flew his flag from the aircraft carrier Implacable. Also taking part in the exercises were Victorious and Anson, along with cruisers and destroyers. During the exercise, the combined force paid a visit to Mount's Bay in Cornwall from 30 June – 4 July 1949.[25]\n\nAdmiral Sir Philip Vian, Commander-in-Chief from 1950 to 1952, flew his flag in Vanguard.[26] In late 1951, Theseus joined the fleet as flagship of the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron.[27]\n\nFrom 1947 to 1957 superfluous battleships and aircraft carriers were assigned to the Training Squadron, Home Fleet headquartered at Portland to provide basic training. The carriers stationed here were mobilised as helicopter carriers for the Suez operation in 1956. In December 1951 the Admiralty authorised the creation of a new Heavy Squadron to be assigned to the Home Fleet, consisting of the battleship Vanguard, aircraft carriers, and cruisers.[28] Its commanding officer was known as Flag Officer, Aircraft Carriers who had administrative responsibility for all the operational carriers; the squadron was disbanded in October 1954.[24]\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Royal Navy's geographic commands were gradually merged into fewer but larger formations (1954 to 1971).[29] After 1951 the term flotilla applied to the higher command organisation of squadrons in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. The squadrons of the Home Fleet were grouped under a Flag Officer, Flotillas, Home Fleet, who became the main seagoing flag officer. A similar arrangement applied to the Flag Officer, Flotillas, Mediterranean Fleet.[29] In the Far East the Flag Officer 5th Cruiser Squadron became Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet with similar seagoing duties.[29] Increasingly the term 'Submarine Flotilla' was used to describe the squadrons under command of the Flag Officer Submarines.[29]\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, gained an additional NATO responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic (CINCEASTLANT), as part of Allied Command Atlantic, when the NATO military command structure was established in 1953. CINCEASTLANT was set up at the Northwood Headquarters in northwest London. The Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet still flew his flag however in Tyne at Portsmouth. During Exercise Mainbrace in 1952, NATO naval forces came together for the first time to practice the defence of northern Europe, Denmark and Norway. The resulting McMahon Act difficulties caused by potential British control of the United States Navy's attack carriers armed with nuclear weapons led to the creation of a separate Striking Fleet Atlantic, directly responsible to the commander of the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet, in his NATO position as SACLANT, by the end of 1952.[30] The submarine tender Maidstone was the fleet's flagship in 1956.\n\nIn the spring of 1960, C-in-C Home Fleet moved permanently ashore to Northwood, while Flag Officer, Flotillas, Home, retained effective control at sea as the C-in-C's deputy.[31] Cecil Hampshire writes that the ships with the fleet in 1960 included the flagship Tyne, a destroyer depot ship which by then was more than 20 years old; carriers Victorious and HMS Albion; fast minelayer Apollo; seventeen destroyers and frigates; and sixteen submarines. Another aircraft carrier, cruisers Lion and Blake; the first four guided missile destroyers, and other ships were under construction.\n\nIn February 1963 all remaining frigate and destroyer squadrons in the Home, Mediterranean and Far East Fleets were merged into new Escort Squadrons.[32] In April 1963, the naval unit at the Northwood Headquarters, in northwest London, was commissioned as HMS Warrior under the command of the then Captain of the Fleet.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1967, then-Rear Admiral Sir Michael Pollack was listed as Flag Officer Second in Command, Home Fleet.[33]\n\nIn December 1966, all remaining squadrons in the Home Fleet were disbanded.[24] In 1967 the Home Fleet was amalgamated with the Mediterranean Fleet and redesignated the Western Fleet.\n\nCommanders-in-Chief\n\n[edit]\n\nRank Flag Name Term Commanders-in-Chief, Home Fleet 1945–67 1 Admiral Sir Edward Syfret November 1945 – January 1948 2 Admiral Sir Rhoderick McGrigor January 1948 – January 1950 3 Admiral Sir Philip Vian January 1950 – June 1952 4 Admiral Sir George Creasy January 1952 – January 1954 5 Admiral Sir Michael Denny January 1954 – January 1956 6 Admiral Sir John Eccles January 1956 – January 1958 7 Admiral Sir William Davis January 1958 – July 1960 8 Admiral Sir Wilfrid Woods July 1960 – January 1963 9 Admiral Sir Charles Madden January 1963 – July 1965 10 Admiral Sir John Frewen July 1965 – October 1967\n\nSource for post holders after the Second World War:[34]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nHeathcote, Tony (2002).
