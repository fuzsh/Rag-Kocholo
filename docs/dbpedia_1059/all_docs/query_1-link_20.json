His attestation papers have the information that he was age 20, place of birth Honiton Devon, he was a labourer, 5ft 5½in, with black hair, grey eyes, fair complexion. He was assigned to 59 Company, and was discharged on 6 October 1812 to \"settler NSW\".[1]\n\nHe was one of the marines guarding the convicts on the ship Calcutta which left Portsmouth with the store ship Ocean on 27 April 1803. Under the command of David Collins, they were to start a new settlement at Port Phillip. During the voyage, he was referred to as \"Private William Davies\", one of a group of one corporal and six privates whom Collins transferred to the Ocean at Rio de Janeiro because of the unruly behaviour of the settlers on board this ship on the voyage to Rio.[2][3]\n\nFinding Port Phillip an unsuitable area, Collins moved the settlement in early 1804 to the River Derwent, using the Ocean and the Lady Nelson.[4] William was listed as Corporal William Davis in the 1804 settlement at Hobart. [5]\n\nWilliam was promoted to rank of Sergeant on 19 April 1809.[2]\n\nMarriage: William Davis married Jane Williams on 23 March 1812 at Hobart, Tasmania.[6] Jane was born on Norfolk Island. She was the daughter of First Fleet convict Frances Williams and (possibly) First Fleet marine Robert Ryan, and she used the name Williams when she married.\n\nIn 1812 the Detachment was to return to England, but most of them remained in Tasmania. William Davis, with the other two sergeants MacCauley and Gangell, submitted a memorial to Governor Macquarie on 24 November 1812, on behalf of the members of the detachment, \"most of them have faced the Enemies of the King and County in the sharpest Actions in the East and West Indies, Egypt &c, but are nearly worn down in the Service.\" They \"humbly claim the generosity of the Government to receive remuneration for the clothing, Back-pay due and other privations and such indulgences as were granted to the First Fleet Marine Detachment when they were discharged\".[2]\n\nWilliam was granted 180 acres of land in the district of Staffa (Mangalore) in 1813.[2]\n\nThe Hobart Town Gazette (1819, May 8) reported: \"WILLIAM DAVIS is appointed Constable for the District of Black Brush.\"[7]\n\nColonial Conviction: William and his wife Jane were convicted in June 1824 of receiving stolen sheep, and were transported to Macquarie Harbour. Details of the crime were in the Hobart Town Gazette.[8]\n\nGovernor Arthur wrote to Lt Samuel Wright, who was the commandant at Macquarie Harbour:\n\nGovernment House, 17th July 1824.\n\nSir,\n\n...\n\nI presume you will find a difference, even amongst the degraded people who are sent down to you. For instance, amongst others now embarked, is William Davis, who has been a receiver of stolen sheep: this man for several years bore a most excellent character, and, although it is no excuse, he seems to have been entirely the victim of the plans of his wife. This man, therefore, I cannot view in the same light with some others who are sent to you; it is possible he may be reclaimed, and the reformation of character, I hope, you will always consider a grand object.[9]\n\nAfter their conviction, what happened to William and Jane's two children Eliza and William Thomas? Eliza was placed in the Children's Orphanage, It is not known where William Thomas was during this time.[4][10]\n\nTheir third child Amelia was born at Macquarie Harbour on 25 May 1825, and her birth registration recorded that William was working as a shoe maker at Macquarie Harbour.\n\nJane and her husband William were sent to Maria Island from Macquarie Harbour in 1829 and they received their tickets of leave in 1830.[4]\n\nThey received their Conditional Pardons on 31 August 1836.[11]\n\nDeath: William Davis died on 20 March 1844 the day after he was knocked down by someone riding a horse when he was walking along a street at night. During the inquest a witness stated that he was known as \"Sergeant Davis\" and he resided at the Black Brush, and his age was about 60 years.[12][13]\n\nHe was buried in St. Mark's Anglican Cemetery, Pontville, Tasmania, Australia. His gravestone has his age 71.[14]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nNote there is ANOTHER COUPLE with the names William and Jane Davis: William Davis (abt 1789-1865), a whaler, and Jane MURRAY (1794-1875). They lived at BRUNY ISLAND. Some trees have confused them with this couple, and have mixed up the children's births. For example, some trees incorrectly have their son James William Davis (born 1838 at Bruny Island) as a son of William Davis and Jane Williams. Alexander Thomas Davis (1826-1893) is also a son of the Bruny Island couple. John Given's otherwise excellent book Royal marines at Port Phillip New South Wales and at Hobart Town Van Diemen's Land 1803-1812 also incorrectly has these two as sons of the Black Brush couple.\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"A description of Men who have enlisted for His Majesty's Royal Marines stationed at Portsmouth\" PRO ADM 158/91-206, cited in Given, John W.
