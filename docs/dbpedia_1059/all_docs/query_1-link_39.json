        "text": "PHOTO INFORMATION\n\nFRCSE earns environmental award\n\nFRCSE Wins CNO Environmental Award\n\nBy Clifford Davis, Fleet Readiness Center Southeast Public Affairs DLA Disposition Services\n\nThe chief of naval operations recognized Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE) in February for its environmental successes with the CNO Environmental Award for Sustainability.\n\nThis is the second consecutive year the command has earned this prestigious award. FRCSE will now advance to compete for the Secretary of the Navy Environmental Award.\n\nFRCSE is a full-spectrum industrial aircraft facility that involves engineering and manufacturing components, logistics and maintenance of high-performance engines, aircraft and weapons systems. These operations offer multiple opportunities to be good stewards of the environment, of which FRCSE employees have taken full advantage.\n\n\"I make this run two or three times per week,\" said Charles Miller, an FRCSE material identifier, as he picked up a cart full of residual aluminum chips from a computer numerical control machine. \"I wash them three times to remove any oil residue and dust, then a truck takes it to Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services to be sold as bulk.\"\n\nThe scrap aluminum, steel and titanium are left over after aircraft components are milled from bulk stock. The metal shavings are just a sliver of FRCSE's efforts to further shrink its environmental footprint. It's just one part of a coordinated effort by the environmental department and military depot workers to keep the command in compliance with state and federal regulations.\n\n\"Our goal was to develop environmental acumen across the command,\" Environmental Engineer Henry Pape said. \"We created a compelling scoreboard, determined specific actions that would lead to the scores we were looking for and held each other accountable by posting information in shop areas to let them know how they were doing from an environmental standpoint. It is absolutely gaining traction.\"\n\nAmong FRCSE's top environmental accomplishments were:\n\n* Reduced energy by implementing steam reduction and high-efficiency lighting.\n\n* Reclaimed more than eight tons of Rhenium, a chemical element of metal, and expanded its metals reclamation program to include F404, F414 and TF34 engine components, totaling 49 tons.\n\n* Reclaimed two EA-6B Prowler aircraft, recycling nearly 19 tons of aircraft material and recovering aircraft parts for a Navy cost avoidance of $14.5 million.\n\n* Diverted 250 tons of waste from landfills and recycled more than 1,680 pounds of universal waste.\n\n* Recycled more than 160 tons of used oil for energy recovery and reduction.\n\nTo be recognized for such an award - for the second consecutive year - requires all hands on deck, Pape said. \"It's a team effort, it's not just something our office does,\" he said. \"All we can do is help to facilitate and guide the team working on these aircraft.\"\n\nThe facility's success is the result of the command's emphasis on environmental care and employees' dedication to that standard, FRCSE Commanding Officer Capt. Chuck Stuart said.\n\n\"The selection of both FRCSE and FRC Southwest for this award shows the importance that Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers places on environmental stewardship, and that focus has filtered down through the ranks,\" Stuart said. \"I could not be more proud of our entire team on their sustained and structured approach toward eliminating any impact we may have on the environment - a very lofty goal.\""
