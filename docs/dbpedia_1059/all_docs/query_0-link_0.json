The Davis family were landed gentry, of Well Close, Brockworth, Gloucestershire; Davis's middle name came from the family estate.[1][2] Davis was educated at Summer Fields School in Oxford, the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.[3]\n\nNaval career\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis was commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1917, towards the end of the First World War.[4]\n\nHe also saw active service in the Second World War, initially as Executive Officer on the battlecruiser HMS Hood. From 1940 he was Deputy Director of Plans at the Admiralty and then, from 1943, returned to sea as Commander of the cruiser HMS Mauritius, in which capacity he was involved in the Sicily landings, the Normandy landings, and the action at Audierne Bay.[4] From November 1944 to February 1946 he was appointed Director of Torpedoes and Mining.[5]\n\nAfter the War Davis was made Director of Underwater Weapons at the Admiralty and then, from 1948, Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.[4] He became Naval Secretary in 1950 and Flag Officer, Second in Command of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1952.[4] He went on to be Vice Chief of the Naval Staff in 1954 and Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet and Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic Area in 1958.[4] He was First and Principal Naval Aide-de-camp to the Queen from 1959 to 1960.[4] He retired in 1960.[4]\n\nFamily\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 28 April 1934 he married Lady Gertrude Elizabeth Phipps, daughter of Constantine Phipps, 3rd Marquess of Normanby; they went on to have two sons and two daughters.[1] His first cousin was the actor Stringer Davis, husband of Margaret Rutherford.[1][2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
