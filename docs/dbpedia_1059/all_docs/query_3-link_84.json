        "text": "MACON TWP. — The 112th annual Memorial Day service at Macon Cemetery on Sunday, honored the service of the fallen as well as Cpl. William H. Crittenden, one of the soldiers responsible for capturing Jefferson Davis during the Civil War.\n\nCrittenden, also known as “Tip,” belonged to Company E of the 4th Michigan Cavalry, which departed for war in 1862. He originally was from the Macon and Tecumseh areaand is buried at Macon Cemetery.\n\nBob Elliot, a local historian, was a guest speaker at the ceremony and told attendees a little about Crittenden. He was married to Rosetta, and they had five children. He was only 24 years old when he was called to fight. He died on Nov. 29, 1924, as the last soldier still alive who captured Davis.\n\n“It must have been difficult to leave his bride and head off to war, but it was a noble thing to do, and I’m sure he felt like many of his fellow countrymen, that this great country was worth saving, to keep the Union together and to free another race of Americans from the bondage of slavery,” Elliot said in his speech.\n\nElliot said that Davis, president of the Confederacy, would disguise himself in his wife’s clothing to escape, but he would wear men’s boots, which exposed his disguise. Crittenden was one of the soldiers who demanded that Davis halt and one of the soldiers who took him to Fortress Monroe in Hampton, Virginia.\n\nTo honor Crittenden and all of the fallen soldiers, the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War put on their uniforms and gear and marched down the cemetery as the Village Brass performed “Battle Hymn of the Republic.” They then stood single file and remained standing during the rest of the ceremony. Penny Hunt, secretary of the Macon Cemetery board, said that there are more than 160 veterans buried in Macon, and 40 of those veterans fought in the Civil War.\n\nNathan Smith, state commander, was another speaker at the ceremony.\n\n“We have awarded medals to soldiers, added their names to monuments and named buildings for them to honor them for their bravery. But nothing can ever replace the hole left behind by a fallen service member and no number of medals or ribbons can comfort the ones left behind,” Smith said in his speech.\n\nSmith then asked service members and relatives of service members to stand.\n\nThe ceremony included the laying of a wreath at the Civil War monument by Gary Naugle, who helped organize the event; state Rep. Bronna Kahle of Adrian; and, representing Sen. Dale Zorn of Ida, Tracy Oberleiter.\n\nNaugle, Kahle and Oberleiter presented a tribute to two of Crittenden’s great-great-grandsons, Steve and Mark Crittenden, who were in attendance. The tribute was signed by Kahle, Zorn, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist.\n\nKahle read part of what was written on the tribute, which said, “In special tribute therefore, this document is signed and dedicated to honor the courage and strength Corporal Crittenden demonstrated in protecting the freedoms we all hold so dear. May he and his family know of our heartfelt appreciation for his distinguished service and high esteem he has held by the people of Lenawee County, by the state of Michigan and by our nation.”\n\n“It was very humbling to be able to honor a true hero,\" Kahle said in an interview. \"To think that one of the people responsible for helping to end the Civil War is from Tecumseh, Michigan, is incredible and absolutely deserving of all of our recognition and this special event today, to be able to memorialize what he has done permanently with a plaque and with the community coming together in unity, ironically, because this was about preserving the Union of the United States, so how special that we’re here in unity to recognize what he did.”\n\nThe ceremony ended with a 21-gun salute and the playing of taps."
