        "text": "Maritime Activity Reports, Inc.\n\nHSV-X1, the 96-m Wave Piercing Sealift Catamaran, which is formally known as Joint Venture and currently on charter to the U.S. military from Bollinger/INCAT USA, has entered the next level of its experimental program - its recent transfer from the U.S. Navy to the U.S. Army. The vessel has been involved in a partnership of component commands from the U.S. Navy, Army, Marine Corps, U.S. Special Operations Command and Coast Guard, which are together exploring operational implications and opportunities of new marine technologies that are bringing higher speeds, longer ranges and increased payload capacities to surface vessels. With administrative control of HSV-X1 transferred to the U.S. Army at Rota Naval Air Station, Spain on March 20 following the Battle Griffin exercise off Norway, Joint Venture then underwent minor modifications to enhance the vessel's capabilities and to provide additional versatility in a logistical role. The Army Command Post of HSV-X1 consists of three senior officers with approximately 53 years of experience among them. The vessel will be under the command of CW4 William R. Davis, who reiterated Joint Venture's mission of providing logistical support within theater, to further test and evaluate the craft in intra-theater lift requirements. Joint Venture will also be commanded by CW3 Rebecca Brashears,. and Chief Engineer Gregory Ellison, a CW3 with 18 years of service to the Army Watercraft Transportation Corps."
