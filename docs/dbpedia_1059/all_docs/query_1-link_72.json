White; Vol. 1, Pg. 913]\n\nAccording to tradition, at the time of the Revolutionary War, William worked in his father's shipyard. They had been Royalists until their shipyard was burned, William having guided the British fleet through Hell Gate Channel into New York City at the time of its capture. After the loss of the shipyard, William took his wife and children to her parents' home and joined the Army of the Co Colonists and fought for the American Cause. (Viola Trainer Manu).\n\nWilliam migrated to Washington Co. Pennsylvania 1789 and to Harrison County Virginia 1792 (Pension Record). He bought all the bottom land east of Salem, where Bristol is now located and from that acquired the name Bottom Billy. He was at one time Sheriff of Harrison County, Virginia (West Virginia). About 1832 or 1833 he and his wife and several of their children migrated to Clark County, Ohio. It is believed that she died in Clark County, 1834, and he died in Clark or Shelby County, 1834 or 1840.[Davis--The Settlers of Salem, West Virginia; Susie Davis Nicholson]\n\nBiography:\n\nSketches of Pioneers. William Davis. William Davis is supposed to have been born in New Jersey, and came to Harrison County some time after the war of the Revolution. He settled in the Bottom land between Salem and Bristol. Was a large owner of lands, removed to Ohio and died there some time in the thirties. He always signed his name William Davis 'Bottom' to distinguish him from two or three other William Davis' who lived in the neighborhood.\n\nTradition says that he had been a sailor and that during the Revolution he was loyal to the King and that he piloted the British fleet through the Hell Gate Channel, under the command of Lord Howe, at the time New York was captured in 1776, and for his services on that occasion he received a large bag of gold. After the close of the war and upon his return home, he found it a little unpleasant for persons of his political opinions, and emigrated to the western country as it was then called, where some of his relatives had come before. Deeds executed by him show that he lived in this county as late as 1825. His father resided near the Battlefield of Brandy Wine, and rode out from home, on a white horse, to see the battle, and the color of his horse attracting attention, he was fired on and killed. [History of Harrison County, WV, by Henry Haymond, pg. 369].\n\nStory:\n\nWilliam was a ship carpenter. One day he went into a ship yard looking for work. The boss said to him \" Can you make a pin?\" He says \"I can try.\" The boss gave him a new hand ax and a piece of timber for a pin and led him to the \"hack block\" which proved to be a large stone. He finished his pin without touching the block with the edge of his ax greatly to the surprise of the boss, and raising his ax high into the air, struck a tremendous blow into the face of the rock as though he took it for an ordinary hack block into which he was accustomed to stick his ax after finishing a job. \"Thad will do\", says the boss. \" I will give you $30 a month.\" He worked here but a short time, shortly after being a sailor on the high seas.\n\nAt the beginning of the Revolutionary War he was a Tory and joined the British Army. It is said that he ran the first British gunboat through Longg Island Sound to New York. The following story is told as related by him. \"one day while consulting with the British Officers, concerning the strength of the Colonists, it began to thunder and not a cloud in sight, we took a spy-glass and discovered a small black cloud not larger than a man's hand rising in the west. It kept getting lsrger until we could see it with the naked eye. It came up and settled over the vessellying at anchor nearby and a flash of lightning struck her magazine which blew up completely destroting the vessel.\" He believed it was an act of providence, which convinced him that he was fighting on the wrong side. He deserted the British and joined the American forces.\n\nAfter the close of the war and about 1789 0r 90 he moved from Shrewsbury NJ to Harrison county Virginia and settled on a tract of land near the moouth of Cherry Camy Run. The viilllage of Cherry Camy was afterward built on this farm. He built the first mill in that vicinity. The foregoing is an illustration of the sterling worth and character of the man. He had strong likes and dislikes and was ready to fight for that which he believed was right. The following historical facts prove his patriotism and courage in fighting for his country when comvinced that the then present authority was in the wrong.\n\nWilliam Davis of Monmouth County, New Jersey, Private in the detachment of Monmouth County NJ Militia enlisted at Monmouth, July, 1776, served one month as guide. Private under Lieut. Colonel Auke Wykoff's third regiment for one month. Served as private in Capt. Dennis' Co. 3rd Reg. Monmouth county militia.

The wound in his breast was from a rifle ball, which was removed, leaving a large scar for the remainder of his life. James Davis, the oldest son of William, appeared before the President at Springfield, Ohio, where he lived, June 28th, 1833, and testified that he was a son of William Davis and was born April 1, 1774, that he remembered well when his father left home, and that he and his mother went to live with her father, John Havens of Shrewsbury, NJ and he remembered distinctly when his father returned home from captivity, when he was five or six years old and that afterward he went away again to serve in the Militia.\n\nWilliam Davis 1663-1745 And Descendants Compiled by Thomas Clayton Davis as published in The Alfred Sun, Alfred, NY, 1945-1948]"
