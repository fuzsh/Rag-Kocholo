        "text": "Part four of my summaries. The Mauritius Command brings O’Brian’s series to a grander naval scale and our co-protagonist Aubrey to new levels of rank and responsibility. In the three preceding books, Aubrey took his first command, fought hard to gain the status of post captain, and gained his most famous ship and sailed it to India. Now he is saved from his disappointing domestic life by his friend Maturin and given not just a ship but a squadron. The large action–whole fleets in motion, islands invaded–is matched by large characters. Aubrey’s chief nemesis is, in fact, not the French Admiral he has been sent to defeat but a captain under his own command: Lord Clonfert strives for, above all else, status and recognition, and he is driven to beat his old shipmate Aubrey. Clonfert is also at odds with Captain Corbett, who has a reputation for disciplinary cruelty and is not exactly well loved by his crew. In short, while Aubrey must manage a campaign to control the south Indian Ocean he must also manage the officers who make up that campaign. He finds this to be much more of a burden than he expected.\n\nThe heart of the series remains Dr. Maturin. His observations, especially of Aubrey and Clonfert, give emotional depth to a book that might otherwise be little more than Navy reports. He does not, unfortunately, have much time for natural history, because the mission to control Mauritius and its neighboring islands requires as much political maneuvering as military maneuvering. Maturin’s abilities as spy and, now, of negotiator and propagandist, make him critical to the campaign. As a character, Maturin brings to the novel both humanity and complexity. It kinda needs it; without Maturin, the book would be all militial tension.\n\nO’Brian brings this all together with a huge amount of historical accuracy, or at least historical inspiration. Aubrey’s earlier exploits were based on the real Thomas Cochrane. In The Mauritius Command, Aubrey is taking the role of the real of Josias Rowley. Names of officers, names of ships, and the unfolding of events are all drawn directly from records, climaxing with a telling of the disastrous Battle of Grand Port. This level of detail also made this book the hardest to summarize so far. In other words, SPOILER ALERT of the strongest order.\n\n“Portsmouth” by Joseph Mallord William Turner\n\n“A View of the Cape of Good Hope” by Hodges\n\nA map of the island of La Réunion\n\nRivière des Pluies, La Réunion\n\n“Combat De La L’Ile De La Passe (Ile de France)” by Morel-Fatio\n\n“Battle of Grand Port: HMS Nereide” by Pierre-Julien Gilbert"
