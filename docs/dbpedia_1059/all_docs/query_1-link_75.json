        "text": "The Coast Guard has 14 C-27J Spartans in its medium range surveillance aircraft fleet, along with its HC-144 Ocean Sentries, to perform drug and migrant interdiction, disaster response and search and rescue missions. The aircraft’s range, endurance and speed make it a valuable asset in addressing the Coast Guard’s maritime flight-hour gap.\n\nUnder the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, 13 C-27J aircraft were regenerated from a preserved status at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. A 14th aircraft was transferred to the Coast Guard after formal acceptance by the Air Force in April 2017.\n\nAs delivered, the C-27Js are outfitted with weather radar and communications equipment capable of supporting transport and other Coast Guard missions. The Coast Guard worked with Naval Air Systems Command to determine which additional specialized equipment will be installed to enhance and expand the aircraft’s capabilities. The C-27J missionization package is based on the Minotaur mission system architecture that the Coast Guard is implementing across the rest of its fixed-wing fleet. The first Spartan entered the mission system integration process at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, in September 2017. Prototype installation is scheduled for completion in 2022, with testing to follow.\n\nThe HC-27J Asset Project Office (APO), at Elizabeth City, North Carolina, oversaw the aircraft regeneration process and conducted many of the acquisition duties, including development of Coast Guard-specific crew duties, procedures, technical manuals, curricula and test and evaluation reporting.\n\nAir Station Sacramento, California, is the first operational unit using C-27Js; it received its sixth and final Spartan May 1, 2017. The remaining aircraft are stationed at the APO or in the mission system integration process.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nLength: 74 feet 6 inches\n\nWingspan: 94 feet 2 inches\n\nHeight: 31 feet 8 inches\n\nMaximum Weight: 70,000 pounds\n\nCruise Speed: 290 knots true airspeed\n\nRange: 2,675 nautical miles\n\nEndurance: 12 hours\n\nFeatures\n\nStandardized Minotaur mission system across all Coast Guard fixed-wing aircraft (under development)\n\nMilitary communications\n\nMultimode radar\n\nLarge search windows\n\nNight vision goggle capabilities\n\nEighteen HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft are included in the Coast Guard’s medium range surveillance fleet, along with the C-27J Spartans. The fixed-wing, turboprop aircraft has an endurance of more than 10 hours and an extensive sensor capability that helps the Coast Guard fulfill its maritime patrol, drug and migrant interdiction, disaster response and search and rescue missions more effectively.\n\nThe Ocean Sentry is particularly effective at locating objects in large search areas and vectoring other military, government and first responders to these locations. The aircraft has the capability to perform aerial delivery of search and rescue equipment such as rafts, pumps and flares. With its sophisticated command and control system, it also can serve as a platform for an on-scene commander during homeland security missions.\n\nThe Ocean Sentry features a rear ramp that allows crews to quickly reconfigure the aircraft for varied operations, including command and control, medical evacuation or passenger transport.\n\nThe Coast Guard is upgrading its HC-144A fleet to improve mission effectiveness and situational awareness through the Ocean Sentry Refresh project. Each aircraft will receive a new cockpit control and display unit, used in flight management as the primary avionics computer for communication control, navigation and equipment monitoring. Upon completion, each aircraft is redesignated as an HC-144B.\n\nThe service is also integrating the Navy’s Minotaur mission system architecture across its fixed-wing aircraft fleet. The Minotaur integration process for the prototype HC-144B began at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, in July 2016. The missionization process is scheduled for completion by 2024.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nLength: 70 feet 2 inches\n\nWingspan: 84 feet 8 inches\n\nHeight: 26 feet 10 inches\n\nMaximum Weight: 36,380 pounds\n\nCruise Speed: 215 knots true airspeed\n\nRange: 2,100 nautical miles\n\nEndurance: 10+ hours\n\nFeatures\n\nStandardized Minotaur mission system across all Coast Guard fixed-wing aircraft (under development)\n\nGlass cockpit instrument panel, autopilot and avionics suite\n\nMultimode search radar and electro-optical/infrared sensors\n\nMission data recording and a first responder/law enforcement and maritime communications suite\n\nCruise Speed: 215 knots true airspeed\n\nAirborne Automatic Identification System\n\nSecure and nonsecure voice and data using satellite communications"
