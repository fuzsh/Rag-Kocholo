Davis in Macon, Georgia. Shortly after graduating from Peter G. Appling High School he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on 31 August 1961. After recruit training at Parris Island SC, he was transferred to Camp Lejeune NC for individual combat training. He then joined Company K, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines at Camp Lejeune and served as a rifleman until May 1964. While at Camp Lejeune, he was promoted to Pfc and Lance Corporal.\n\nLcpl Davis was ordered to London, England for a three year tour of duty as an embassy guard. He was promoted to corporal, and then sergeant in December 1966. Ordered to the Republic of Vietnam in August 1967, he was assigned duty as a Platoon Guide with Company B, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division. On 06 September 1967 he was operating with his unit in the Quang Nam Province on a search and clear mission during Operation Swift. When attacked by a large enemy force, elements of the platoon were pinned down in a trench line by mortars, heavy automatic and small arms fire. He went from man to man encouraging them on and also returning fire at the same time. An enemy hand grenade fell in the trenches his men were fighting from and without hesitation he threw himself upon the grenade. He saved his fellow Marines in this selfless act and thus earned the nation's highest military decoration: the Medal of Honor.\n\nUSS Rodney M. Davis (FFG 60) (1987-2015) was the first ship to be named in his honor. Bill Gonyo\n\nDowney, Cal.\n\nAssoc.
