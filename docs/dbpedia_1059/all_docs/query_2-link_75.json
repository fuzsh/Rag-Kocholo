        "text": "The Atlantic Fleet got underway from Hampton Roads under the command of Rear-Admiral Robley Evans, a graduate of the Naval Academy, loyal to the Union, who fought a received to severe wounds in the Civil War while attacking Fort Fisher in 1965. He was the last active duty officer that had served in the Civil War.\n\nRADM Evans had suffered from his wounds his entire career and during the first portion of the cruise around South America, the pain became to much and, on March 14, 1908 he announced he would retire when the fleet reached San Francisco. On May 7th, 1908 the fleet was transferred to the command of RADM Charles M. Thompson. RADM Thompson entered the Naval Academy in 1861 and after graduation in 1865, served four years on Asiatic Station on the USS Shenandoah. As was the policy at the time, the maximum age to be on active duty was 62, and RADM Thompson would turn 62 on October 1, 1908, before the fleet was scheduled to return. And so, a week later, command was turned over to RADM Charles Sperry who had entered the Naval Academy in 1862 and would be able to serve in command until the end of the cruise. The forth Rear-Admiral at the start of the cruise was RADM William Emory, a classmate of RADM Sperry at the Naval Academy. Four Civil War era commanders at the beginning of 1908! When RADM Sperry took Command, Captain's Schroeder and Wainwright were promoted to Rear-Admiral, taking Division Command of Third Squadron and Second Squadron.\n\nThe original photograph at right, taken in Sydney, Australia shows the four Admirals of the fleet seated from left to right, RADM Emory, RADM Sperry, RADM Schroeder, and RADM Wainwright. There aids are standing behind them."
