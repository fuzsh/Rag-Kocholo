        "text": "The Department of the Air Force selected Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, as the preferred location to host Air Force Special Operation Command’s third power projection wing.\n\nTransforming the 492nd Special Operations Wing into a power projection wing with all of AFSOC’s mission capabilities (strike, mobility, ISR, air/ground integration) will enable the Air Force to regionally focus each power projection wing on a geographic combatant commander. The transition will also allow AFSOC to further diversify its locations to protect against natural disasters by ensuring it can maintain its ability to respond to president-directed missions on very tight timelines.\n\nThe additional location will also permit AFSOC to take advantage of the Barry M. Goldwater Range, which will provide additional training opportunities, capacity and increased prioritization as its forces prepare to meet the priorities of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nStanding up the new wing at Davis-Monthan AFB requires several relocations, planned throughout the next five years. The final decision will be made following completion of the environmental impact analysis process.\n\nThe following outlines the planned transition actions:\n\nThe 492nd SOW at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will relocate to Davis-Monthan AFB. The relocation includes the 492nd SOW’s transition from support wing into a power projection wing.\n\nThe U-28 Draco fleets at Cannon AFB, New Mexico, and Hurlburt Field will be replaced by the OA-1K Armed Overwatch aircraft. As part of the 492nd SOW’s transition to a power projection wing, one OA-1K Armed Overwatch squadron will relocate from Hurlburt Field to Davis-Monthan AFB.\n\nAn MC-130J Commando II squadron will relocate from Cannon AFB to Davis-Monthan AFB to join the 492nd SOW.\n\nAn additional MC-130J squadron will activate at Davis-Monthan AFB.\n\nThe 21st Special Tactics Squadron will relocate from Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, to Davis-Monthan AFB.\n\nThe 22nd Special Tactics Squadron will relocate from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, to Davis-Monthan AFB.\n\nThe 492nd Theater Air Operations Squadron will activate at Duke Field and transfer to Davis- Monthan AFB."
