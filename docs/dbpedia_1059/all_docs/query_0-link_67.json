He finished training during the Falklands Conflict in 1982 in time to join 809 NAS and sail south on the newly commissioned HMS Illustrious to relieve HMS Invincible which remained on station after the surrender. Further frontline tours on 801 NAS and 800 NAS as Air Warfare Instructor culminated as a staff pilot on 899 NAS HQ training squadron where he displayed the Sea Harrier for 2 years earning a Queens Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air.\n\nAlistair left the Royal Navy in 1990 to start a commercial career with British Airways where he flew TriStar, B747, B737, Embraer 145, single aisle Airbus and finally B777 for 30 years. He held technical and training management roles including Chief Pilot of BA’s regional carrier BA CitiExpress.\n\nIn 2020, Alistair joined Navy Wings as a volunteer fixed wing pilot and now is contracted as Director of Flight Operations leading our operations team and highly experienced pilots. He displays the Seafire and Harvard. “It is with immense pride and privilege that I have been given the opportunity to fly these historic aircraft, national treasures in their own right, and return to the warm embrace of a Royal Navy squadron environment. Who wouldn’t want to be involved!”\n\nLittle Known Fact – On 6th June 1983 Alistair led a 2 aircraft surface search mission in which his wingman got lost and landed on a small Spanish container ship. Google ‘Alraigo Incident’ to get more information!\n\nLieutenant Commander Glenn Allison joined the Royal Navy in 1984 as an apprentice aircraft engineering artificer at HMS Daedalus and subsequently worked on Lynx helicopters at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Portland and in 1990 he was selected for officer and flying training.\n\nHe followed the well-trodden path of a Naval helicopter pilot, through BRNC Dartmouth to Elementary Flying Training on the Bulldog at Topcliffe and thence to 705 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) Gazelle helicopters at RNAS Culdrose, where he was awarded “Wings” in 1992. Advanced and Operational flying training came on the Sea King Mk4 and he became a Commando “Jungly” pilot.
