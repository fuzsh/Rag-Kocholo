        "text": "By AWF2 Olana Wesley\n\nStaff Writer\n\nForty-five students from Boynton Aerospace Science Academy (BASA) toured NAS Jax Feb. 23. The students learned about the contribution of naval aviation to the overall mission of the fleet - in addition to the station's celebration of the Centennial of Naval Aviation.\n\nThe group gained insight into important events in naval aviation history as NAS Jax Command Historian/Safety Officer Ron Williamson took them inside the glass enclosure that protects the Stearman N2S-3 aircraft at Heritage Park. The Stearman was an advanced trainer used by naval aviators in the 1930s and 1940s to perfect their flying skills at NAS Jax.\n\nBASA is a unique program in which Palm Beach County Schools System and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University partnered to create an opportunity for high students to gain college credit while exploring the academia of aviation, aeronautical science and aviation maintenance.\n\nBASA students also visited Aviation Survival Training Center Jax, Fleet Readiness Center Southeast, air operations and Helicopter Maritime Strike Wing Atlantic Rescue Swimmer School.\n\nThe students' intuitive questions showed their desire to increase their knowledge in all aspects of aviation.\n\n\"They were very interested in the operations of Navy search and rescue,\" said AWRC(NAC/AW) William Davis, who briefed the students after poolside demonstrations provided by rescue swimmer school staff and Swimmer Class No. 11004. \"It was a great pleasure to meet such eager young students.\"\n\nBASA Director Paul Hershorin remarked, \"This was a diverse experience into careers involving aviation. Safety was the key and consistent lesson that these students will take home with them, from aviation survival training to maintaining the aircraft.\"\n\nHershorin expressed the importance of the tour at NAS Jax to the aspiring aviators and aerospace engineers.\n\n\"Our students will remember this for years to come. When we talk about aircraft in the classroom setting, they'll relate what the learned at NAS Jax and the many hours of workmanship that goes into aircraft maintenance. This only adds to the significant impact of the BASA program.\""
