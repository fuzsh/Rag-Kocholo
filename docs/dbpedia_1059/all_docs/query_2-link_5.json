Royal Navy official writings describe Navy Command Headquarters both as a physical site, on Whale Island, Hampshire, a collective formed of the most senior RN officers,[2] and as a budgetary grouping.\n\nOn 1 April 2006 the Fleet Top Level Budget was established.[3] A Top Level Budget (TLB) is the major financial accounting group of the MOD. On 1 April 2010 the Fleet TLB was renamed Navy Command. Navy Command is the Top Level Budget (holder) for the RN.[4] Navy Command supports the First Sea Lord in the management of the Command, and delivers the Service's current and future outputs as articulated in the Command Plan.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Navy was historically divided into a number of fleets and ashore commands, prominent examples being the Home Fleet; Mediterranean Fleet; East Indies Station; and Far East Fleet. In the late 1960s the Home Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet were amalgamated into Western Fleet. In the 1970s Western Fleet and Far East Fleet were amalgamated into CINCFLEET.[6] At the same time, the post of Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth was merged with that of Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth to form Naval Home Command. As overseas bases continued to be reduced, the Navy's shore establishments became more concentrated in the UK, under Naval Home Command.\n\nThe purpose-built Headquarters at Whale Island, Portsmouth was opened in 2002 was named after Admiral of the Fleet Sir Henry Leach, the First Sea Lord during the Falklands War.\n\nAs of 2017 official descriptions said that the headquarters was based at Whale Island, but also includes the Command Centre in Northwood, and support staff in Portsmouth Naval Base.[7] As of 2017 it included:\n\nHenry Leach Building and West Battery Building, HMS Excellent, Portsmouth – Senior Naval staff\n\nMoore Building, HMS Excellent – Fleet Battle Staff.\n\nCommand Centre, Northwood – Maritime operations staff.\n\nHMNB Portsmouth: – Support Staff\n\nMaritime Warfare Centre\n\nFlag Officer Sea Training – training of warships for combat preparatory to deployments\n\nRoyal Navy Chaplaincy Service – provision of religious ministry.\n\nStructure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, is the Royal Navy's professional head and chairman of the Navy Board. He is responsible to the secretary of state for the fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the Naval Service, and supports the Secretary of State for Defence in the management and direction of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe Fleet Commander exercises Full Command, on behalf of the First Sea Lord, over all Fleet Units, Battle Staffs, the Fleet Air Arm, Royal Fleet Auxiliary and the Royal Marines. He is responsible for the generation of units for tasking, and the operation of the Fleet in meeting standing commitments, conduct of current operations, and maintaining their contingent capability, as directed by Head Office and articulated in the Navy Command Plan.[8]\n\nThe Second Sea Lord leads Navy Command HQ and is responsible for the Development and Delivery of future and current capability in support of the Fleet Commander, as detailed in the Navy Command Plan.[8]\n\nThe previous office of the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Submarines) and Deputy Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland, as of January 2017,[9] was disestablished under the Navy Command Transformation Programme, April 2020.[10]\n\nChanges by 2020-2021 saw the Commander, UK Strike Force, take up command of the UKSTRKFOR Enterprise, including the Maritime Battle Staff. ** The Maritime Battle Staff appears to be a change of name for the previous Fleet Battle Staff. The Fleet Battle Staff, based in two locations (Portsmouth and Plymouth), was the operational planning department, that planned exercises and operations for large multinational naval and marine task groups across the globe.[11] But in actuality the Fleet Battle Staff was merely a collective name for the COMUKMARFOR, COMUKAMPHIBFOR, Commander UK Task Group (COMUKTG), and the 3 Commando Brigade Headquarters.[12]\n\nOffice of the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff\n\n[edit]\n\nUpdated where possible to 2020-2021:[13]\n\nFirst Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff – based at the Ministry of Defence in London as part of the Chiefs of the Defence Staff.\n\nSecond Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff\n\nFleet Commander\n\nRear Admiral Iain Lower, Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Policy), directs and develops naval strategic policy and strategy for the Royal Navy.\n\nCommodore Paul S.
