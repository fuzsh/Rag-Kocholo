V.H. Danckwerts as Director of Plans, taken from Stephen Roskill's \"Churchill and the Admirals\" (1978), pages 93-94: \"There can be no question that Churchill's return to the Admiralty in September 1939 was warmly welcomed throughout the navy, though doubts soon began to arise regarding the soundness of some of his strategic and technical ideas. That he invigorated the whole administrative machinery of the department and made his personality feIt far and wide is beyond doubt; but he also diverted to fruitless schemes manpower and materials which were sorely needed for more conventional purposes - sometimes on the advice of Professor Lindemann who was convinced that his rocket weapons could provide better A-A defence than conventional guns. As in World War I Churchill regarded the Baltic as the best theatre for launching the 'naval offensive' which he was always seeking. Since he himself has given a full account of the preparations for operation 'Catherine' there is no need to repeat them here in detail; but some of the exchanges it produced, which have not been published before, are relevant to this study. On 18 September the first of a series of meetings took place in Churchill's room to discuss War Plans in general and a paper which two very senior admirals, Sir Reginald Drax and Sir Gerald Dickens, had produced. Their conclusion was that we could not be ready to take the offensive at sea for six months - which was highly distasteful to Churchill. Admiral of the Fleet Lord Cork and Orrery, who had last served at sea in command of the Home Fleet 1933-5 and was sixty-seven years old, was brought in to prepare for 'Catherine', the object of which was defined as being 'a force a passage into the Baltic and maintain there a naval force'. Churchill proceeded cautiously, and on 20 September stated that 'At present the decision is only for exploration and no question of action arises. But the search for a naval offensive must be incessant.' Though Cork repeatedly pressed for a decision on whether the operation was to be launched, and was obviously ready and anxious to lead it, at the end of the year Churchill told him that 'the political situation in the theatre has considerably changed', doubtless due to the Russo-Finnish war, and he should therefore review his plan. Neither the Admiralty nor the Government was, he stated, committed to action. The position was that 'the gun is to be loaded ready for firing. This and no more'. Meanwhile Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord, and the naval staff had developed and expressed strong doubts about the feasibility of the undertaking; and Cork himself described it as 'very hazardous'. On 10 January 1940 Pound told Churchill that he and Cork had discussed the plan thoroughly, and he was 'of the opinion that a strong force of submarines could achieve the object we desire while a surface force could not'. He was anxious that 'we should if possible end the war with our sea supremacy unchallenged' - a somewhat long-term hope. If we lost all the submarines sent to the Baltic 'it would not really matter' he wrote; but 'if we lost a considerable part of our surface fleet the story would be a very different one'; which shows how wedded Pound was to the 'battle fleet concept' and how little aware of the growing influence of air and underwater weapons. The outcome was that on 23 January 1940 the order was given that preparations to carry out the operation that year were to cease. In retrospect the decision was a wise one, since no surface force could possibly have survived for long against the air, submarine and mine counter measures which the Germans would certainly have brought to bear against it. It does therefore seem very unfair that the able Director of Plans, Captain V.H. Danckwerts, should have been sacked for criticizing the plan too vigorously; but his departure was an ominous warning to staff officers of the fate which awaited them if they opposed Churchill's ideas.\" Dane,\n\nClement Richard\n\n14.09.1883\n\n-\n\n25.08.1963\n\nMidsh. 15.05.1900 S.Lt. 15.05.1903 Lt. 31.12.1905 Lt.Cdr. 31.12.1913 Cdr. 30.06.1915 (retd 21.11.1924) Capt.
