        "text": "Lucky Bag\n\nFrom the 1919 Lucky Bag:\n\nLoss\n\nWilliam was lost on October 2, 1945 when the seaplane he was aboard crashed on Honshu, Japan. He was Commander, Carrier Division 22.\n\nThere is more on the flight and search operations. The wreckage wasn't located until November 1948.\n\nBiography\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nWilliam Dodge Sample (9 March 1898 – 2 October 1945) was a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy and an Escort Carrier Division commander in World War II. He was the youngest rear admiral in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II.\n\nSample was born in Buffalo, New York and graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918.\n\nDuring World War I, Sample served aboard the transport Henderson. For meritorious service during a fire onboard Henderson, he received a letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy. Detached in August 1918, he served on several destroyers based at Queenstown, Ireland. He remained in the European Waters Detachment after the end of World War I.\n\nIn December 1921, Sample was transferred to the gunboat Pampanga in the Asiatic Fleet.\n\nSample attended flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida and was designated a Naval Aviator on 23 June 1923. Shortly thereafter, he served as Commanding Officer of Scouting Squadron VS-1. In the 1920s, he successively served in the Aviation Departments of the light cruisers Raleigh and Richmond, and battleships Arizona and New York.\n\nSample served on board the aircraft carriers Saratoga and Lexington, commanding Fighter Squadron VF-5 on the latter from 1932-1934. Promoted to Lieutenant Commander, Sample saw duty at the Bureau of Aeronautics from 1935-1937 followed by duty as Navigator on Ranger in 1938. In 1939, Sample was assigned as Air Operations Officer on Yorktown. His last duty before World War II was as Supervisor of Aviation Training at Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, he assisted in the conversion of the oil tanker Santee into an escort carrier. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to Commander. Assuming command of Santee on her commissioning, he was awarded a letter of commendation for service during Operation Torch (the invasion of North Africa).\n\nCaptain Sample assumed command of Intrepid on 19 April 1944. In May 1944, he was transferred to serve as Commanding Officer of Hornet and in the ensuing months participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and a strike against the Volcano Islands.\n\nIn late summer 1944, Sample was promoted to Rear Admiral, flying his flag aboard the escort carrier Marcus Island as Commander, Carrier Division 27 (CarDiv 27), for the invasion of Palau. In October 1944, at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, his CarDiv 27 was part of Task Unit 77.4.2 (TU 77.4.2, otherwise known as Taffy II) at the Battle off Samar under Rear Admiral Felix B. Stump. In early 1945, Commander, CarDiv 27, and Marcus Island supported the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Philippines. For the Invasion of Okinawa, Sample moved his flag to CarDiv 22 and Suwannee.\n\nDuring the Leyte invasion, Rear Admiral Sample \"desired a better view of operations\" and decided to hitch a ride in a torpedo bomber. He lay in the \"tunnel gun\" position and observed through the window below the tail. The plane was hit by antiaircraft fire. Sample was severely cut on the head and shoulders. James C. Edinger, ARM3c, USNR, of Foxburg, Pennsylvania, came down from the \"blister\" where he was manning a .50 in (13 mm) machine gun, and applied first aid. Edinger said that it took them more than an hour to return to Marcus Island, during which he kept kicking Sample in the face with his foot to keep the Admiral from passing out. Sample was a big man: Edinger was afraid that if they ended up in the water, he wouldn't be able to get him out of the plane. Each time Sample would warn Edinger to make sure the .30 cal machine gun in the tail was empty. He was afraid that when they landed the gun would go off. Later, Sample explained to Edinger that he could see the headlines in the paper, \"Admiral lands upon carrier: shoots hole in deck\". According to the ship's surgeon, Commander Lee, \"the excellence of Edinger's treatment helped prevent infection\". Admiral Sample was awarded the Purple Heart, and at Sample's request, Edinger was promoted to Aviation Radio Man, Second Class.\n\nOn 2 October 1945, shortly after the war ended, Sample was listed as missing after his Martin PBM Mariner aircraft failed to return from a familiarization flight near Wakayama, Japan. Rear Admiral Sample was officially declared dead on 3 October 1946.\n\nThe remains of Sample, Capt. Charles C. McDonald of Suwannee (CVE-27), and the seven members of the flight crew were discovered in the wreckage of the aircraft on 19 November 1948, recovered, and returned to the United States to be interred together at Arlington National Cemetery on 17 May 1949.\n\nWilliam was survived by his wife, Mary Lee, and daughter, Carolyn. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nAnother biography was written before his death. From \"History of U.S.S. Intrepid 16 August 1943 — 1 March 1945\":\n\nCaptain Sample was born in Buffalo, New York, March 9, 1898, the son of W. R. Sample, now Brigadier General, USA, Retired.

He had his high school education in the Lowell High School, San Francisco, and the New Mexico Military Institute, Roswell, New Mexico, and was appointed to the Naval Academy by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915. He was graduated with the class of 1919 on June 6, 1918, was commissioned Ensign on June 7. His subsequent promotions are as follows: Lieutenant (junior grade) September 21, 1918; Lieutenant, June 3, 1922; Lieutenant Commander, January 5, 1933; Commander, January 1, 1939; Captain, June 17, 1942.\n\nAfter graduation in 1918, Captain Sample was ordered to duty and destroyers based in Queenstown, serving in the USS Bixie, USS Trippe and USS Wilkes. He remained on duty in European waters for 2 1/2 years after the war, during which time he had consecutive duty in the USS Lansdale, USS Pittsburgh, USS Olympia, and as U.S. Naval Representative at Italian Naval Headquarters, Pola, Italy. He joined the USS Southard in July, 1920 and early in 1921, cruised in her to the Asiatic Station via the Suez Canal. He was transferred to the USS Wilmington in January, 1922, and from that ship to the USS John D. Edwards in May of that year.\n\nAfter Captain Sample's return to the United States in December, 1922, he was ordered to the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, for flight tarining, reporting on January 4, 1923. He was designated Naval Aviator on June 23, of that year and attached in September. After two months in the Naval Unit, Edgewood Arsenal, Edgewood Maryland, he reported to the USS Wright, Flagship Aircraft Squadrons, Scouting Fleet, for duty in Scouting Squadron 1 (F5L). In November, 1924, he was assigned to duty in Observation Squadron 3, attached to the Light Cruisers and served in that squadron based consecutively on the USS Raleigh and the USS Richmond.\n\nCaptain Sample was stationed at Pensacola from January, 1926 until July, 1928. From August, 1928, until May, 1931, he served consecutively in Observation Squadron Three based on the USS New York, and in Scouting Squadron Two based on the Saratoga. He was General Inspector of Naval Aircraft, Central District, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, from June, 19311 until June, 1932. Following that dirty he was aide and flag secretary on the staff of the late Rear Admiral John Halligan, when that Admiral was Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force; (name changed to Base Force upon reorganization of Naval Aeronautical forces on April 1, 1933) and Aircraft, Battle Force. In June, 1934, Captain Sample joined Fighting Squadron Five based on the USS Lexington as Squadron Commander and in June, 1935, he reported for dut in the Plans Division, Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, Washington, D.C. he returned to see duty in June, 1938, has navigator of the USS Ranger and in April, 1939, he transferred to duty as operations officer on the staff of Vice Admiral Charles Adams Blakely, Commander Aircraft, Battle Force, USS Yorktown, flagship. Captain Sample relieved Rear Admiral (then Commander) T. L. Sprague as Superintendent of Aviation Training at the Naval Air Stations, Pensacola, Florida, in June, 1940, and later was Executive Officer until June, 1942, when he reported to the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, for duty fitting out the USS Santee of which he assumed command when commissioned.\n\nIn may 1943 he was ordered to duty at Headquarters, Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet as operations officer of the 10th fleet.\n\nOrdered to the Intrepid in April 1944, Captain Sample stayed a month before being ordered elsewhere.\n\nPhotographs\n\nFrom Find A Grave\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\nFrom Find A Grave\n\n\"William as a CDR, circa 1941,\" from Find A Grave.\n\nLegion of Merit\n\nFrom Hall of Valor:\n\n(Citation Needed) - SYNOPSIS: Rear Admiral [then Captain] William Dodge Sample, United States Navy, was awarded the Legion of Merit (Posthumously) for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. HORNET (CV-12), on 20 June 1944.\n\nGeneral Orders: Bureau of Naval Personnel Information Bulletin No. 362 (April 1947)\n\nService: Navy\n\nDivision: U.S.S. Hornet (CV-12)\n\nNamesake\n\nUSS Sample (FF 1048) was named for William; the ship was sponsored by his daughter.\n\nCharles McDonald '24 was also lost in this crash.\n\nNavy Directories & Officer Registers\n\nThe \"Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps\" was published annually from 1815 through at least the 1970s; it provided rank, command or station, and occasionally billet until the beginning of World War II when command/station was no longer included. Scanned copies were reviewed and data entered from the mid-1840s through 1922, when more-frequent Navy Directories were available.\n\nThe Navy Directory was a publication that provided information on the command, billet, and rank of every active and retired naval officer. Single editions have been found online from January 1915 and March 1918, and then from three to six editions per year from 1923 through 1940; the final edition is from April 1941.\n\nThe entries in both series of documents are sometimes cryptic and confusing. They are often inconsistent, even within an edition, with the name of commands; this is especially true for aviation squadrons in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nAlumni listed at the same command may or may not have had significant interactions; they could have shared a stateroom or workspace, stood many hours of watch together… or, especially at the larger commands, they might not have known each other at all. The information provides the opportunity to draw connections that are otherwise invisible, though, and gives a fuller view of the professional experiences of these alumni in Memorial Hall."
