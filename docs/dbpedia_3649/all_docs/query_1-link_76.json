        "text": "WALLY ZATYLNY\n\nBA ‘87\n\nFootball\n\nThere may never have been a more electrifying offensive football player for the Gaiters than Wally “White Lightning” Zatylny. From 1985 to 1987, Wally was an exceptionally fast wide receiver as well as punt and kick-off returner for the Gaiters.\n\nDuring his university career Wally scored 20 touchdowns in 21 games and was literally a threat to score every time he touched the ball. Wally was awarded OQIFC all-star status for three consecutive seasons. The Greenfield Park native was named CIAU All-Canadian in 1986. In 1987 Wally led the nation in reception average and was awarded the Alouette Alumni Award as the most outstanding Quebec University football player.\n\nWally enjoyed an eight-year CFL career (seven years in Hamilton, one in Toronto ) and was a CFL Eastern Conference all-star in 1989. Wally still holds the Hamilton Tiger-Cat career kick-off return record with 3,373 yards.\n\nAn engaging personality, Wally has been in high demand as a football colour commentator on various television networks in Canada.\n\nThanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"
