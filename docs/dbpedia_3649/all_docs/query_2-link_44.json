        "text": "Our husband and father, Randy W. Harris, 77, returned to his Heavenly home on Monday, August 5, 2024. He was born on October 18, 1946, in Rigby, Idaho to Wallace Roscoe and Violet Sara McClure Harris of Roberts, Idaho, the first of six children. Dad had a good life growing up on a farm where he learned the importance of hard work.\n\nDuring his school years he enjoyed many sports, but his favorite was church softball. He was also active in 4-H and the high school Ag program in which he won many awards for his prize livestock. His favorite pastime was drag racing his GTO or Mustang…anyone who knew him, knows he loved his vehicles. He graduated from Roberts High School in 1964 and then he attended Ricks College where he earned his Junior College Diploma.\n\nAfterwords, he moved to Salt Lake City, Utah and began working for Utah Power & Light. After a few chance encounters, he finally met his future wife, LuCinda (Cindy) Smith. They were married on February 13, 1971, and were blessed with five children. They were later sealed in the Idaho Falls Temple in 1978.\n\nAfter several transfers with dad’s employer, our family finally settled in Preston, Idaho. He loved taking his family camping, 4-wheeling, and fishing. He enjoyed sharing his love of the outdoors with his kids.\n\nDad was active in the Franklin County Search and Rescue and served as a Commander. In 1986, he was awarded the “Life Saving Award” by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States for his life saving efforts.\n\nHe enjoyed serving his community and held several callings over the years in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints. He was currently serving as the Legacy Branch Elder’s Quorum President. Dad retired from Utah Power & Light after 42 years of service. He was loved and admired by so many people in the community and everywhere you go, he is known for being an honest and kind man.\n\nHealth issues haunted dad most of his life and was the cause that ultimately led him into the Franklin County Long Term Care. He had a wonderful and caring “Posse” that took care of him for the past two and a half years where he finished his mortal journey with family by his side.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife, Cindy, and his children Stacy (Blake) Rindlisbaker, Preston, ID; Ryan (Kacey) Harris, Grantsville, UT; Alisha (Chris) Graham, Preston, ID; Clint (Becky) Harris, Preston, ID; and Samantha (Claye) Stokes, Waxhaw, NC; sixteen grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, and his siblings Rick Harris and Tammy Maughn. He was preceded in death by his parents, Wally and Violet Harris, his brothers Bradley, Garth, and Myron Harris. The family extends a special thank you for the wonderful care at Franklin County Long Term Care Center.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Saturday, August 10, 2024, at 1:00 pm at the Preston South Stake Center 55 East 100 South in Preston, Idaho. The family will receive friends on Friday, August 9, 2024, from 6:00 – 8:00 pm at Webb Funeral Home and Saturday, August 10, 2024, from 11:30 am – 12:30 pm at the Stake Center. Interment will be in the Preston Cemetery. Condolences may be shared with the family at webbmortuary.com. Services will be available to stream live on Sat 1:00 pm MDT at the following link:"
