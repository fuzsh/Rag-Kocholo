        "text": "The Morgan-Canales era begins in Carolina as the Panthers kick off the 2024 preseason against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium on August 8.\n\nDave Canales brings 14 seasons of NFL experience to Carolina. He comes to the Panthers from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he spent one season as the team’s offensive coordinator. Canales spent his first 13 years in the NFL with the\n\nSeattle Seahawks (2010-22).\n\nNew England also enters the 2024 season with a new head coach, promoting Jerod Mayo who spent the previous five seasons (2019-23) leading the team’s inside linebackers. The Patriots finished with a 4-13 record in 2023, placing fourth in\n\nthe AFC East.\n\nThis will mark the 13th preseason matchup between the two clubs with their first meeting coming in 1999. The Patriots have an edge in preseason matchups, holding a 9-3 record against the Panthers.\n\nThe Mathcup\n\nAbout Carolina\n\nNewly appointed at the helm, Dan Morgan and staff brought key additions to the roster this offseason, trading for wide receiver Diontae Johnson and signing key free agents including offensive linemen Robert Hunt and Damien Lewis, outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney, linebacker Josey Jewell, defensive linemen A’Shawn Robinson and DJ Wonnum, safety Jordan Fuller and cornerback Dane Jackson.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers defense finished the season ranked near the top of several categories both in the NFL and franchise history. The unit allowed the fourth-fewest yards per game this season in the NFL, 293.9, which also ranks as the third-fewest allowed in a season in franchise history.\n\nThe Panthers finished second in the NFL averaging 26.5 yards per kickoff return. They were also one of four teams to average at least 26 yards per kickoff return (Texans, Patriots, Seahawks).\n\nQB Bryce Young recorded 20+ completions in eight-consecutive games to start his rookie season which ranks second all-time behind Justin Herbert who did so in 15-straight games in 2020.\n\nDT Derrick Brown set an NFL record for the most tackles by a defensive lineman in a season (according to StatsPass, since 1994) with a careerhigh 103, surpassing Dolphins DT Christian Wilkins’ 2022 total of 98. He was the only player in the NFL in 2023 to record 100+ tackles, 15+ quarterback hits and 7+ tackles for loss.\n\nAbout New England\n\nThe Patriots allowed just 3.3 yards per rush, the lowest in the NFL in 2023 and the lowest in team history since the 1970 merger. The previous low was 3.4 yards per rush by the 1974 team.\n\nThe 2023 Patriots finished with the 7th ranked total defense. The team has finished in the top 10 for defense 11 times since 2000. It is also the third straight year the team finished in the top 10 in total defense.\n\nVeteran QB Jacoby Brissett should be expected to start and play at least a series or two before giving way to 2024 NFl Draft 3rd overall pick Drake Maye, 2024 6th round pick Joe Milton and 2022 4th round pick Bailey Zappe.\n\nThree 2023 draft picks were in the starting lineup on opening day in 2023 with first-round pick CB Christian Gonzalez starting at cornerback, fourth-round pick OL Sidy Sow starting at right guard and fifth-round pick OL Atonio Mafi starting at left guard.\n\nThe 2023 Patriots had three players finish with 100 tackles in 2023 with LB Ja’Whaun Bentley (114), LB Jahlani Tavai (107) and S Kyle Dugger (107). It is the fourth time since 2000 that the Patriots have had three players reach 100 tackles.\n\nConnections\n\nPanthers T Badara Traore (Hyde Park) and OQC Dean Petzing (Wellesley) both grew up in Massachusetts. OLBs Tem Lukabu was the defensive coordinator for Boston College from 2020-22.\n\nPatriots QB Drake Maye (Charlotte), G Nick Leverett (Concord), LB Oshane Ximines (Ahoskie) and DE Keion White (Raleigh) are all from North Carolina. LB Joe Giles Harris (2016-18) attended Duke, S Kyle Dugger played at Lenoir Rhyne (2014-19), QB Jacoby Brissett attended N.C. State (2013-15).\n\nMaye (2021-23) and DCA Jamael Lett (2023) both spent time at UNC and Leverett attended NC Central (2015-18). RB Deshaun Fenwick (2018-20), RB Kevin Harris (2019-21) and TE Jaheim Bell (2020-22) all attended the University of South Carolina while aOLs Robert Kugler was an offensive quality control coach at Appalachian State in 2020.\n\nCarolina vs Chicago\n\nAll-Time Series (Preseason): 12 matchups | New England leads 9-3\n\nLast Preseason Game: 8/19/22 | New England 20 vs Carolina 10\n\nSeries Record at New England (Preseason): New England leads 5-0\n\nHow to Watch\n\nKickoff: 7:00 p.m. ET Queen City News: Play by Play – Anish Shroff, Analyst – Steve Smith Jr., Sideline – Carla Gebhar\n\nLive Stream: Panthers.com\n\nRadio: WRFX 99.7FM in Charlotte market – Jim Szoke (Play by Play), Kurt Coleman (Color), Kevin Donnalley (Color), Sharon Thorsland (Sideline)\n\nPer Release\n\nShare This"
