        "text": "Every year, law enforcement agencies across the South Bay — and statewide and nationally — provide a one-day opportunity for public safety officers to show their softer side.\n\nThat day is called National Night Out, and it took place in multiple South Bay Cities on Tuesday evening, Aug. 6. During the myriad events, law enforcement officers, emergency personnel and the public came together to learn about crime prevention tips, safety tips for around their homes and creating neighborhood watch groups — while having fun in a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nAnd there aren’t many better ways to relax than by petting some furry friends.\n\nThat was the scene at the Inglewood Police Department on Tuesday evening as that agency provided a petting zoo, in addition to a classic car show, face painting, music and giveaways.\n\nSome of the other South Bay cities to commemorate the night — held on the first Tuesday of August — included Torrance, which hosted a meet-and-greet at a park; El Segundo, which taught lessons in defensive tactics; and Gardena, which hosted a summer block party.\n\nRedondo Beach, meanwhile, will hold its National Night Out event from 4 to 8 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 10, in the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center’s parking lot. There will be vehicle displays, games, K9 officers, a dunk tank and food trucks.\n\nThe performing arts center is at 1935 Manhattan Beach Blvd. For more information, visit tinyurl.com/ukywef6r."
