        "text": "Less than three weeks after being thrust into the 2024 U.S. presidential race as the presumptive nominee on the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday (Aug. 6) chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nHarris made the pick official Tuesday evening at a rally in Philadelphia, noting that Walz is a “proud product of a middle class family,” a veteran of the Army National Guard who went to college on the GI Bill, and worked as public school teacher and football coach. She noted that Walz was the highest-ranking enlisted person to ever serve in Congress, worked to raise the federal minimum wage, pushed for legislation allowing workers to join a union, and was a key vote in passing the Affordable Care Act during the Obama Administration.\n\nWalz, 60, was first elected governor in 2018 and won re-election in 2022. Walz was a coach and Army National Guard member before entering politics.\n\nAfter high school graduation, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard, attended Chadron State College and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in social science in 1989. Walz spent a year teaching abroad before returning home to serve full time in the Army National Guard and eventually accepting a high school teaching and coaching position.\n\nAfter 24 years in the Army National Guard and achieving the rank of Command Sergeant Major, Walz retired from the Army in 2005. He won his first election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 and was re-elected for another five terms.\n\nPresident Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 following a dismal debate with former President Donald Trump. Biden handily won the Democratic primary for the nomination, but there were concerns about Biden’s age entering the 2024 presidential election cycle.\n\nThe issue become more acute following the June 27 debate between Biden and Republican nominee Donald Trump, 78, during which Biden was often unable to complete sentences.\n\nHarris’ choice comes less than two weeks before the Democratic National Convention begins in Chicago on Aug. 19, and gives Harris and Walz time to travel around the country to build enthusiasm for the ticket against former President Donald Trump and his VP pick of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.\n\nRecent polls by various media outlets and polling groups show Harris as overcoming a previous lead by Trump, but still within the margin of error. Polling continues to show the race as being close in key battleground states that include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n“Governor Tim Walz is an Arkansas kind of choice,” said Grant Tennille, chair of the Democratic Party of Arkansas. “His leadership in Minnesota has been focused on creating a better state for families, kids, students, and working-class people. As an Army National Guard Veteran and public school educator, Gov. Walz embodies the values and commitment to service that will resonate deeply with the people of Arkansas. … His dedication to service, his understanding of rural issues, and his commitment to improving the lives of working families make him the ideal partner for Vice President Harris. Together, they will continue to build a stronger, more equitable America.”\n\nTalk Business & Politics will update this story throughout the day."
