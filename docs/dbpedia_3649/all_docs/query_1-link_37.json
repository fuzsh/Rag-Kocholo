        "text": "NEIL Harris has hailed ‘exceptional’ former Millwall star Jed Wallace as the winger prepares for his second return to The Den.\n\nWallace enjoyed an outstanding five years with the Lions after being brought to the club by Harris in 2017.\n\nThe two will now face off on Good Friday as Wallace looks to keep his new side West Bromwich Albion pushing for promotion.\n\nIt will be Wallace’s second return to The Den after he assisted John Swift’s goal during West Brom’s 2-1 defeat to Millwall in October 2022.\n\nWallace turned 30 earlier this week and Harris said of the West Brom captain: “I thought he was exceptional for this football club. Fans are always the best people to ask for opinions on their players. But putting sentiment aside, I think 100 per cent of fans would have been Jed Wallace fans when he had a Millwall shirt on.\n\n“For me personally he was a terrific character, an excellent professional, a real good leader of men. One of the best and most consistent Championship players with attacking output over the last seven years. A player that in my opinion has been destined to play in the Premier League for the last ten years. At the moment he’s flourishing as captain in that very talented West Brom side that are trying to get back in the Premier League. I look forward to seeing Jed.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate to work with some really good players at different levels and pound-for-pound, he has to be up there with the best players that I’ve managed.”\n\nWallace played 260 times for Millwall, scoring 42 goals and registering 49 assists."
