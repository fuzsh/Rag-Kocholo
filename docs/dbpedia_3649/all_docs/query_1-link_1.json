In 1987, he became an NHL Supervisor of Officials until he retired in 2002.\n\nHarris was the referee for the famous 3-3 tie between the Montreal Canadiens and the Soviet Union’s Central Red Army team on December 31, 1975, a game fondly remembered and widely regarded as one of the best ever played."
