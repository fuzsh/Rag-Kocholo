Spectrum News' Kelvin Washington was there and provided reactions.\n\nThen, babies are growing up with screens in their hands. We know screen time is bad for kids, so why are parents ignoring the warnings?\n\nPlus, Elon Musk is moving out, but his divorce with California has become an ugly split.\n\nAnd finally, we head to Tahiti, where massive waves have fascinated and terrified visitors â and are now taunting Olympic surfers."
