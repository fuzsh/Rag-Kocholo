        "text": "Tributes have been paid to D-Day war hero Wally Harris, who died on the day he was due to return to Normandy.\n\nMr Harris, who had terminal stomach cancer, died at Thames Hospice in Windsor last Thursday.\n\nThe Military Medal (MM) holder had been due to travel to France after he was unable to join the official 70th anniversary commemorations due to ill health.\n\nWally’s son George said: “It is with a heavy heart filled with sadness, but bursting with pride, I announce Walter Frederick Harris MM, passed away.\n\n“He died peacefully while sleeping in Thames Hospice where he has been cared for wonderfully.\n\n“Myself and my eldest brother David were in the hospice, and his immediate family and dear friends had been to see him.\n\n“Wally had a quite incredible memory and sense of humour for his 93 years and, despite his frailty, was remarkably sanguine regarding his terminal stomach cancer.\n\n“He knew his time was very limited so that’s why he was so insistent about doing these last few very special events and interviews.”\n\nLast week Mr Harris, of Loughborough, Crown Wood, spoke to The Bracknell Times about landing on the beaches on June 6, 1944.\n\nTributes have flooded in from across the community.\n\nRita Woolford, of Binfield Art Society: “I worked for a charity that was dealing with grants for carers and Wally was caring for his wife Dolly, they were married for 73 years.\n\n“He was the most inspirational man I have ever met.\n\n“I asked him two years ago to open the Binfield Art Society’s annual exhibition.\n\n“At 91 he readily agreed and it was an honour for the artists.\n\n“The artists and guests were so impressed they still talk of him today with great respect and admiration.”\n\nJane Currie, who knew Mr Harris through her work at Bracknell Forest Voluntary Action, said: “Although he was a hero he was also a hero in his daily life, by how he dealt with what life threw at him and his wife.\n\n“His wicked sense of humour never diminished, even as his illness took hold in the last few months.\n\n“When my carer’s role ended, it never entered my head that I would not continue to visit Wally out of work hours and our lives are all the richer for it.”\n\nMr Harris joined the Territorial Army aged 18 in April 1939 and was called up two days before the war broke out.\n\nHe served for 14-and-a-half years before moving to Bracknell in 1959 with wife Dolly.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife Dolly and five sons.\n\nA funeral with full Military Honours will be held The Garrison Church of St Eligius in Tope Road, Arborfield on Friday, June 27.\n\nThose who wish to attend should gather at 2.30pm for a 3pm service.\n\nA cremation will be held at Easthampstead Park Cemetery and Crematorium in South Road followed by a wake at REME Arborfield in the Bailleul Sergeants’ Mess, where the bar is named after Mr Harris.\n\nMr Harris’ family has requested donations in lieu of flowers to Thames Hospicecare, Hatch Lane, Windsor, SL4 3RW.\n\nTo confirm attendance contact George Harris on 07808 495766 or (01344) 485 820 or george_harris@hotmail.co.uk."
