        "text": "Good evening! The battle for the Blue Wall states got dialed up a notch today, with dueling campaign events in Wisconsin and Michigan. Here’s your Wednesday update.\n\n‘Joyful Warriors’ Harris and Walz Hit the Midwestern Campaign Trail\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, looked to build momentum for their ticket Wednesday by holding a large rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The Harris campaign said it had raised $36 million in 24 hours after the Walz selection was announced.\n\n“As Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors,” Harris told the crowd.\n\nRepublican Sen. JD Vance also held an event in Eau Claire, as his schedule plays off that of the Democratic ticket.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, wasn’t out on the campaign trail, and he doesn’t have any rallies scheduled before a Friday night event in Montana. He did, however, call into “Fox & Friends” Wednesday morning, and he claimed to be “thrilled” by the “shocking” choice of Walz, who he called “very, very liberal” and a “smarter version” of Harris.\n\n“This is a ticket that would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner,” Trump claimed baselessly. “We want no security. We want no anything. He's very heavy into transgender. Anything transgender he thinks is great, and he's not where the country is on anything.”\n\nThe energy behind the new Democratic ticket is unmistakable, though. Harris and Walz followed up their rally in Wisconsin with one in Detroit, near where Vance started the day.\n\nFiscal News Roundup"
