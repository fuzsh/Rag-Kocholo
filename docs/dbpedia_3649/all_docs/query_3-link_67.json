        "meta_description": "Unprecedented collaboration between Tribes has generated the largest small business financing consortium in the country.WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the approval of up to $83 million in State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) funds for a consortium of 125 Alaska Tribes. Funded by the Biden-Harris Administration’s American Rescue Plan (ARP), this investment supports the nation’s largest Tribal SSBCI consortium and is part of the most expansive investment in small business financing for Tribal governments in history. The launch of intertribal SSBCI consortia has been critical to enabling small, remote, and capacity-constrained Tribes to access federal funding. Through the consortium, 125 Tribes will access critical economic development resources for Alaska’s Tribal economy.The funds are anticipated to catalyze as much as $830 million in additional private sector investment across the state and in Native-owned businesses. The funding will be administered on behalf of the Tribal consortium by the Alaska Small Business Development Center (Alaska SBDC) within the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) Business Enterprise Institute (BEI).For the first time ever, the ARP included dedicated SSBCI funding for Tribal governments. With today's announcement, Treasury has now approved SSBCI applications for up to $415 million to support more than 220 Tribes through the SSBCI Capital Program for small businesses and Tribal enterprises. “Today’s announcement reflects success that is only possible when federal agencies listen to Tribal Nations to understand their unique needs and incorporate their feedback in developing program policy and guidance. Through the flexibility of the consortium model, these Tribes will benefit from the historic opportunity that these resources for small businesses presents to Indian Country. These funds will serve some of the most rural populations in the United States, creating jobs and expanding capital access for Tribes across Alaska. We look forward to following this announcement with Treasury’s first official visit to an Alaska Native Village at Chickaloon Village,” said U.S. Treasurer Chief Lynn Malerba.“Our Tribe is looking forward to the transformational impact this funding can have on the Tribal economy of Alaska. Rural Alaska is entrepreneurial. Our SSBCI consortium will address capital access barriers and unlock private financing for all of our small businesses that are ready to grow,” said Rena Greene, Deputy Director and Acting Executive Director of Nome Eskimo Community, one of the 125 consortium member Tribes.“Alaska’s tribes are the backbone of our rural economies. The Alaska SBDC is proud to have worked with the Alaska Federation of Natives to bring 125 Alaskan tribes together in the largest tribal consortium in the nation. This collaborative effort over the last two years will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in private sector loans and equity investments flowing into rural and Alaska Native-owned businesses, drastically changing the economic landscape of some of the most remote communities in the nation,” says Alaska SBDC State Director Jon Bittner.“When the American Rescue Plan Act was signed by President Biden, AFN set out to make sure that Alaska Tribes accessed as much of the funding as possible. Our Navigators worked closely with UAA to help over 100 Tribes access SSBCI, an unprecedented program for Tribal nations. We are proud of that work and proud of the over $80 million in small business funding that we are bringing to Native Alaska,” said Executive Vice President and General Counsel for the Alaska Federation of Natives Nicole Borromeo.\"Our local and Alaska-Native centric economies thrive and rely on homegrown small businesses—from coffee shops to electricians. This funding invests in what’s already working here in our state and helps us grow our economies the Alaska way, not the Lower 48 way,” said Congresswoman Mary Sattler Peltola.Reauthorized and expanded as part of the ARP, SSBCI is a nearly $10 billion program to support small businesses and entrepreneurship in communities across the United States by providing capital and technical assistance to promote small business stability, growth, and success. SSBCI represents a transformational investment in American small businesses and is expected to catalyze at least $10 of private investment for every $1 of SSBCI Capital Program funding to increase access to capital to small businesses and entrepreneurs, including those in underserved communities.The Alaska SSBCI Tribal Consortium offers four programs, approved for up to $83.1 million. The programs include a Loan Participation Program, a Loan Guarantee Program, a Collateral Support Program, and an Equity/Venture Capital Funds Program.The Loan Participation and Loan Guarantee Programs, allocated $10.3 and $37.9 million respectively, are designed to reduce interest rates or risks associated with critical small business investments in Alaska and Native-owned businesses. The Collateral Support program, allocated $12.0 million, will provide collateral for small business lending. The program will incentivize loans to underserved borrowers across Alaska. Rural Tribal communities in Alaska depend on small businesses like fishing operations and tourism enterprises, and collateral support is expected to incentivize lenders to support those businesses. The equity/venture capital program, allocated $22.9 million, provides equity capital support to small businesses through a new venture capital program implementing a fund investment strategy, targeting Tribal member-owned businesses, mostly located in rural areas of Alaska.The Treasury Department has worked across the Biden-Harris Administration to deploy historic support from the American Rescue Plan to Indian Country, including over $500 million in Tribal SSBCI funding and $20 billion allocated through the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund program to nearly 600 Tribal governments, the largest-ever single infusion of federal funding into Indian Country. The Biden-Harris Administration has also delivered the largest-ever infusion of federal capital to Native-serving CDFIs through the Emergency Capital Investment Program, Rapid Response Program and Equitable Recovery Program. Treasury invested $234 million in Native-owned and Native-majority shareholder depository institutions through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP), and Treasury projects that the investments across the ECIP portfolio could increase lending in Native communities by up to nearly $7 billion over the next decade based on preliminary analysis.Lenders and small businesses who are interested in receiving more information about the consortium’s SSBCI programs can contact: SSBCI.State@aksbdc.org or SSBCI.Tribal@aksbdc.org.###",
