        "text": "LIBIS, Valdis “Wally” – In his 80th year, passed away peacefully at University Hospital in London, Ontario, on March 15th, 2022. Born in Riga, Latvia, in 1943, he was the son of Valdemars and Maria Libis and brother to Maija Libis.\n\nWally, forever a proud Latvian, started life escaping the Soviet occupation of his birthplace at the end of WWII before landing in a refugee camp in southern Germany, where he lived until the age of 5. Soon after the war, he came to Canada with his parents (Valdemars and Maria) and sister (Maija). The family settled in Hamilton, Ontario, where he attended Westdale Collegiate. Upon graduation, he completed his bachelor’s degree at McMaster University in Hamilton, followed by a law degree from Osgoode Hall in Toronto before moving to London to start what would become an illustrious 50+ year career as a criminal defence attorney. Wally leaves behind a lasting legacy on the London courthouse and legal community, where he fought tirelessly on behalf of his clients and developed countless friendships over the years.\n\nHe was a scholar with a passion for sports, having played football and hockey throughout his academic years at the varsity level, and became known for his tenacious spirit on and off the field and ice, a reputation that followed him into the courtroom. His love of sports and camaraderie continued well into his 60s, playing in a London men’s hockey league, skiing with his family and life-long friends, and cruising on his motorcycles.\n\nFor those who were lucky enough to know him, Wally was a big man with an even bigger heart.\n\nEven when facing health complications, he lived life to its fullest alongside his devoted wife Lorrie and their dog, Maddie. He treasured his children and grandchildren’s visits and phone calls and loved meeting up with his Saturday morning breakfast club.\n\nHe will be sadly missed by his beloved wife Lorrie (Piper) Libis, his children Jeffrey (Kimberly Crane) Libis of Halifax, Michael (Caroline Dunnet) Libis of Toronto, Jennifer Libis of London, their mother Linda (Baird) Libis, and grandchildren who he so fondly admired, Desmond and Lydia of Halifax. He will also be honoured, celebrated, and remembered by his loyal group of friends, extended family in Australia, Patricia Affleck (mother-in-law), and Robert Piper (brother-in-law).\n\nThe entire Libis family would like to thank the staff at LHSC and the extended medical community in London who helped Wally throughout his journey. In lieu of flowers, the Libis family welcomes memorial contributions to the London Health Sciences Centre (Cardiac Care): https://bit.ly/wallylibis\n\nA private family celebration will be held at a later date."
