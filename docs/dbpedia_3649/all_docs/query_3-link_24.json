        "text": "A war hero in his 80s has been given a top honour in recognition of his bravery in World War Two – the Freedom of the City of London\n\nVeteran Wally Harris, of Loughborough in Crown Wood in Bracknell, treasures the accolade very highly but it also means he can now herd sheep or drive cattle across London Bridge with his sword drawn – should he wish to.\n\nThe award, first given out in 1237, also traditionally gives recipients the right to carry a ‘naked’ sword in public and, should police find a freeman drunk and incapable, they must put him in a taxi rather than a cell.\n\n“It’s quite funny really but I am very honoured,” 87-year-old Wally said.\n\n“My family are really pleased.”\n\nHe added: “The drunk and disorderly part isn’t much use to me because I don’t drink, and I don’t own a sword!”\n\nThe old campaigner got the award in recognition of his life-saving actions when his platoon came under heavy fire in Belgium in 1944.\n\nDespite being an engineer rather than a frontline soldier, Wally drove his vehicle into an exposed position and killed or wounded at least 12 soldiers before organising a patrol that took 15 prisoners.\n\nWally was nominated for his award by two City of London Aldermen after a friend recommended him.\n\nHe will be presented with his certificate in a ceremony in the impressive Guildhall, on Thursday, March 24.\n\nHe will be asked to read a declaration which says: “I solemnly declare that I will be good and true to our Sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth II; that I will be obedient to the mayor of this city and I will keep this city harmless.”\n\nAfter the ceremony, Wally and his friends and family will have a lunch at the Guildhall Luncheon Club.\n\nWally has nine medals, including the Military Medal for Gallantry and stars for service in France and Germany, Italy and Africa.\n\nFreedom of the City of London fact box\n\n- People granted the Freedom of the City of London become ‘Freemen’;\n\n- The first recorded instance of the Freedom being given was as long ago as 1237;\n\n- Freemen’s children get admission preference at the City of London School for Girls and the City of London Freemen’s School;\n\n- Famous Freemen include Nelson Mandela, the Queen and Winston Churchill."
