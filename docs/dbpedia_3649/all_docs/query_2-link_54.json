He was on the same level as Cusack with a deep baritone voice. Perhaps some time in the future posthumously.\n\n@Ratty\n\nRobert Henry Castellon (March 9, 1929 – January 15, 2015), known as Bob Wilson, was an American radio personality who served as the longtime radio voice of the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League. In 1987, Wilson was honoured with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, enshrining him in the broadcasters' wing of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcaster's Hall of Fame in 2007. His booming baritone voice and his ability to articulate for radio listeners the dynamic flow and possession changes of ice hockey distinguished him from his peers. He also was noted for his detailed descriptions of hockey fights, which pleased his fans but sometimes gained him disapproval from critics.\n\nBob Wilson (sportscaster) - Wikipedia\n\nGordonHowe\n\nHFBoards Sponsor\n\nSep 21, 2005\n\n16,454\n\n17,667\n\nNewton, MA.\n\nMar 10, 2019\n\n#17\n\nWally Harris, despite his blown call here, was generally a very good referee.\n\nThe referees of that era.
