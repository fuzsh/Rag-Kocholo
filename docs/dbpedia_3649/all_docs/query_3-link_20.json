        "text": "NUNICA -- When he was in his early 50s, Wally Harris knew he had gotten a bit out of shape after spending years behind a desk as a counselor at Fruitport High School.\n\nThe Nunica resident joined a fitness class at the Tri-Cities YMCA in Grand Haven and counted his calories to become more health conscious.\n\nThat was about 25 years ago. Harris, now 77, has remained dedicated to physical fitness, even after his retirement in 1986. He runs a couple 5-kilometer road races each year and goes bike riding with his wife at least once a week when the weather is nice, often traveling 20-40 miles.\n\nFor his efforts, Harris was recently appointed as one of nine \"fitness ambassadors\" from around Michigan who will run across the Mackinac Bridge on Labor Day. He is one of 400 runners selected through a lottery system for a chance to run the bridge. They will be followed by a group of as many as 50,000 walkers. The free bridge walk event is in its 52nd year.\n\nGov. Jennifer Granholm usually runs across the bridge that day, but she plans to walk this year. The 50-year-old governor will walk across the bridge with her aunt and uncle, who are in their 70s.\n\nThe fitness ambassadors were chosen by the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness as role models to encourage Michiganians to pursue healthier lifestyles, said Gretchen Mensing, the council's spokeswoman.\n\nMensing said each individual has a story to share -- one of a barrier they've overcome to stay active. In Harris' case, she said, it's a story of how fitness keeps you young.\n\n\"He's like the ultimate example of: 'Here's what you can do if you make this commitment,'\" she said. \"He's so active and he shows himself that he can do a lot of things that other people his age can't do because he's had that regular exercise.\"\n\nHarris is modest about his appointment as ambassador, referring to it only as a \"pleasant surprise.\"\n\n\"I'm just hoping I can run far enough to make it all the way,\" he said, laughing, and thinking of the bridge's span over the Straits of Mackinac. \"It's five miles, and half of it is uphill, you know.\"\n\nPhyllis Harris, Wally's wife, said she'll join him in the travel to Mackinaw, though the 4 a.m. wake-up time Wally anticipates on run day might not be too fun.\n\n\"It's just really exciting and he really works at staying fit,\" she said. \"He'll be pretty hyped up.\"\n\nWally Harris said his biggest motivation through the years has been his constant involvement with fitness classes at the \"Y.\" He and his wife have been in the same class with many of the same people for more than 20 years, and make it a point to call and check on other participants if they fail to show up after a couple days.\n\nBarbara Peacock, instructor of the class the Harrises attend, said the couple is an inspiration to other participants. They frequently come in with stories of fly-fishing, downhill skiing or other active outdoor experiences.\n\n\"Every trip they ever take, it's like it has some adventure to it, and it's a physical adventure,\" she said.\n\nWally Harris plans to continue running on a regular basis as long as he can.\n\n\"If I ever get to the point (where I have to stop) I'll be very disappointed in myself,\" he said."
