        "text": "A decorated war hero who fought on the beaches during the D-Day landings is expected to travel back to Normandy next week.\n\nWally Harris, of Loughborough, Crown Wood, was among the 156,000 troops sent to the Battle of Normandy on June 6, 1944.\n\nThe 93-year-old, who was awarded the Military Medal for his heroism when he took on a German machine gun crew single-handed with a weapon he had salvaged from the beaches, has been invited to go back to Normandy next Thursday.\n\nMr Harris, who was called up to the army two days before war was declared, was also invited to a commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the landings this weekend but has had to turn it down due to terminal stomach cancer.\n\nBut he hopes to visit memorials and cemeteries in Normandy next week, which has been arranged by the Westminster Dragoons, central London's only Army reserve cavalry unit.\n\nMr Harris, who was a craftsman with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), landed on Gold Beach as part of the Allied invasion force.\n\nHis was one of the first regiments ashore. As part of the LAD (Light Aid Detachment) it was his job to stay close to the unit and keep all vehicles and equipment operational.\n\nLater he and another enterprising colleague went back into the sea to salvage equipment from vehicles that had ‘drowned’ on landing.\n\nHe said: “I actually pinched a Browning machine gun from one of the Sherman tanks that had been knocked out. I could have got into serious trouble for that but twice later we were attacked by enemy aircraft and were able to use it to good effect.”\n\nThe salvaged gun also saved the day in the French village of Mons en Pevelle as the British came under heavy attack on the way to liberate Brussels.\n\nHe said: “We had no idea German troops were in the village, I was really frightened, shaking in my boots.”\n\nArmed with only the Browning and a rifle, Mr Harris and a corporal found some high ground and fired on the German troops gathered in the village until their vehicle exploded and then took the survivors prisoner.\n\nIt was rare for a REME craftsman to get involved in direct fighting and for his quick-thinking that day; Mr Harris was awarded the Military Medal for Bravery. His citation read: “Sgt Harris’s courage and coolness undoubtedly saved the LAD and ‘B’ Echelon considerable casualties and damage.”\n\nMr Harris joined the Territorial Army (TA) aged 18 on April 14, 1939 and was mobilised into the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. He was called up on September 1 1939.\n\nHe served in the Armed Forces for 14 and a half years before moving to Bracknell in 1959 with Dolly, his wife of 73 years, where they had seven sons.\n\nAlongside his medal for bravery his exploits also earned him Freedom of the City of London and has inspired filmmakers to produce an independent movie, called Above and Beyond: The Craftsman.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1956 he also received the 39-45 Star, Africa Star, Italy Star, France and German Star, Defence Medal, War Medal, Coronation Medal and TA Efficiency Medal.\n\nAfter he retired, Mr Harris called on the help of the Bracknell division of the SSAFA, a charity supporting forces personel and their families, for support and assistance."
