About the speaker:

The 2018 season marks Wally Buono's 16th year with the Leos, his seventh as VP of football operations and his 12th as the team's head coach. In November 2017, Wally stepped down as GM following 15 seasons in the role, appointing Ed Hervey in his place.

Wally had also previously retired as head coach following a remarkable nine-year run and a Grey Cup title in the 2011 season. The win brought to a close, a record-setting tenure in which he ultimately led the Lions to two Grey Cup wins in 2006 and 2011. Through 2017, Buono has coached BC Lions teams to ten playoff appearances; seven Western Finals and a crossover visit to the Eastern Final. He returned to the sidelines in 2016.

In recognition of his numerous accomplishments as a coach and former general manager as well as his dedication to Canadian football, Wally was awarded the Order of Canada in 2015 and he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

In addition to his accomplishments as a coach and administrator, Wally is a noted contributor to the community and was recognized for his work with the Paul Harris Award in 2001. Wally continues to donate a significant amount of time as an ambassador of the Royal Columbian Hospital Foundation and as a spokesperson for the Heart and Stroke Foundation.

Among his charitable efforts, Wally is actively involved with Operation Christmas Child, giving clothing and toys to children of impoverished nations. Following the passing of his good friend and former teammate Tony Proudfoot in 2010, Wally lends his support to the ALS Society of BC's WALK for ALS.
