A brand new family friendly Halloween movie that quietly snuck up on us, Zombie Town, based on the R.L. Stine novel of the same name, arrives in theaters today, starring Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase.

The official synopsis: Amy (Madi Monroe) and Mike (Marlon Kazadi) uncover a centuries-old secret when they decide to watch an exclusive film reel. Before they know it, their town has been turned to the undead before their eyes. The duo must track down an infamous filmmaker (Dan Aykroyd) and navigate a town of hungry zombies to break the curse before it’s too late.

According to dialogue in the opening of the trailer, Aykroyd’s horror director character is planning to premiere his first new zombie movie in over 30 years “right here in Carverville” on Halloween Night.

Comedy legends Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase both appear in the film, along with Henry Czerny (Scream VI), Madi Monroe, and Marlon Kazadi. Peter Lepeniotis directed the film, from a screenplay by Lepeniotis, Michael Samonek, and Michael Schwartz, based on R.L. Stine’s 2012 book.

Zombie Town opens in theaters today (September 1).
