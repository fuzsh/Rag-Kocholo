Judging by the images that we've already seen on set, there will be plenty of nods and references to the Ghostbusters movies that we all know and love in the upcoming reboot from director Paul Feig.

While there has been much speculation on whether any of the original cast will actually appear (there's been a constant will he/won't he over Bill Murray) Dan Aykroyd took to Facebook to confirm his cameo role in the movie.

Although the post was quickly removed, probably due to the fact that he might have been told to keep it a secret, He wrote a short message saying that the "lady GBâ€™S are adorable, hilarious and badass" and that his time on set was "exhilarating".

Aykroyd starred in the original alongside Murray, Ernie Hudson and the late Harold Ramis, and his blessing (of sorts) for the reboot will surely put a few fans at ease. The movie is due to be released in July of 2016, and something tells us this might not be the last set leak that we hear of.
