        "text": "I know this incredibly random and inconsequential, but I was just half watching Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom for probably the 30th time in my life and I suddenly noticed who I thought was Dan Aykroyd making a cameo as the British guy who shows Indy and Willie to a plane after escaping Lao in the very early part of the film. I checked and it's him. Weird that I missed this all these years.\n\nHe basically thought he was a member of the Hells Angels or something.. he’d come riding in with a bunch of buddies on Harleys, all of them dressed head to toe in black leather.. my title was Floor Manager i think, but i was really just a glorified bouncer.. one of my jobs was to walk the employees a few blocks safely to their cars after work.. a couple of times Aykroyd made it his business to coordinate all of the guys on bikes to take the employees to their cars, but it was odd the way he was barking instructions, he made it quite a spectacle- you would have thought we were all about to storm the beach at Normandy or something .. guess you had to be there.. this was pre smartphones or id have recorded it .\n\nAnd cliff from cheers is in empire strikes back\n\nThis movie came out a few years before Cheers debuted on NBC and began its 11-year run as the most popular, beloved TV drama series that helped launch the careers of Kirstie Alley, Woody Harrellson, Leah Remini, Shirley Long, and although he'd been in a few movies and series as a supporting actor, Ted Danson. My point is John Ratzenberger was just another struggling, up-and-coming actor who's \"cameo\" on a 1980 memorable Star Wars film is worth seeing today only because of the fame he achieved afterwards. Sylvester Stallone was a bit character in a mid 70's porn movie before first Rocky film came out in 1976.\n\nHim being the uncle of former SNL comedian/actor Jason Sudekis helps out, too.\n\nHe basically thought he was a member of the Hells Angels or something.. he’d come riding in with a bunch of buddies on Harleys, all of them dressed head to toe in black leather.. my title was Floor Manager i think, but i was really just a glorified bouncer.. one of my jobs was to walk the employees a few blocks safely to their cars after work.. a couple of times Aykroyd made it his business to coordinate all of the guys on bikes to take the employees to their cars, but it was odd the way he was barking instructions, he made it quite a spectacle- you would have thought we were all about to storm the beach at Normandy or something .. guess you had to be there.. this was pre smartphones or id have recorded it .\n\nIve heard some stories about the notorious mid-late 70's SNL \"after-party\" shows held at SNL's meeting rooms at NBC Universal headquarters at 30 Rockefeller where cocaine, booze, hookers, one, constant, insane ancient Roman Caligula-and-Tiberius styled Isle of Capri parties that sometimes lasted until Monday morning. Very few of the original SNL crew werent at least habitual/occasional drug users, John Belushi was probably the most hardcore of all of them with his speedball addiction. IIRC, Jane Curtain as a devout Catholic may have been one of the few main cast members who werent involved in SNL's \"afterparty\" scene. According to Ackroyd himself, he, as well as Al Franken, Chevy Chase (whom they despised), were involved with drugs, although not nearly to the level of others like Belushi."
