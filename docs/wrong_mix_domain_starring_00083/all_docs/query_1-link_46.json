        "text": "Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase have entered Zombie Town, a mystery teen romancer based on author R.L. Stine’s book of the same name.\n\nThe indie, now shooting in Ontario, also stars Henry Czerny and co-teen leads Marlon Kazadi and Madi Monroe. The ensemble cast also includes Scott Thompson and Bruce McCulloch of the Canadian comedy show Kids in the Hall.\n\nCanadian animator Peter Lepeniotis will direct Zombie Town. In the adaptation of Stine’s kid’s book, a quiet town is upended when young Mike and his friend Amy watch a horror movie called Zombie Town and unexpectedly see the title characters leap off the screen and chase them through the theater.\n\nZombie Town will premiere in U.S. theaters before streaming on Hulu and then ABC Australia in 2023.\n\n“We are delighted to bring the pages of R.L. Stine’s Zombie Town to the screen and equally thrilled to be working with such an exceptional cast and crew on this production. A three-time Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award winner with book sales of over $500 million, R.L. Stine has a phenomenal track record of crafting stories that engage and entertain audiences,” John Gillespie, Trimuse Entertainment founder and executive producer, said in a statement.\n\nExecutive producers are Trimuse Entertainment, Toonz Media Group, Lookout Entertainment and Viva Pictures.\n\nPaco Alvarez and Mark Holdom of Trimuse negotiated the deal to acquire the rights to Stine’s Zombie Town book."
