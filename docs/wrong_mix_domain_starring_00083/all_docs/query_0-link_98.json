        "text": "Maine Hauntings\n\nEveryone loves a good ghost story, and there's definitely no shortage of them throughout Maine. There's Fort Knox in Prospect, Wood Island Lighthouse in Saco Bay, Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor, and countless others.\n\nBut, speaking of cemeteries -- and obviously, it's not exactly shocking that there are stories of a cemetery possibly being haunted because, hi, full of our passed away friends and family members -- one legend comes with more than just a possible haunted cemetery.\n\nBut first, a brief but related history lesson.\n\nBucksport Maine History\n\nAccording to the official Town of Bucksport website, Colonel Jonathan Buck was captain and owner of the sloop Sally (basically, a wooden yacht) that founded Bucksport in June 1762, and began building it the following year.\n\nHowever, some drama went down during the Revolutionary War, forcing Colonel Buck to leave his land (then known as Plantation No. 1) behind during battle, and the British torched it.\n\nFast forward to 1783, when Plantation No. 1 was resettled and, according to Enchanted New England, renamed to Buckstown Plantation, then Buckstown, then finally what we know today as Bucksport.\n\nAnd that's where the haunted drama begins.\n\nThe Curse of Buck's Tomb\n\nThere are a few different versions of what actually happened next, none of which have officially been confirmed, but all have to do with Colonel Buck sentencing a woman to death that allegedly was a witch or used witchcraft and \"explain\" the stain seen on his tombstone.\n\nOne version, according to Enchanted New England, mentions that Colonel Buck sentenced the woman to be burned at the stake, and during the burning, one of her legs rolled out of the fire and landed at his feet. Another variation of the story has the woman declaring that she would forever be dancing on the Colonel's grave when that time comes.\n\nA third version, and possibly one of the most-believed versions of the story, involves a bit of a monologue the woman gave to Colonel Buck just as she was being hanged, raising one hand in the air and stating,\n\nJonathan Buck, listen to these words, the last my tongue will utter. It is the spirit of the only true and living God which bids me speak them to you. You will soon die. Over your grave they will erect a stone that all may know where your bones are crumbling into dust. But listen, upon that stone the imprint of my feet will appear, and for all time, long after you and you accursed race have perished from the earth, will the people from far and wide know that you murdered a woman. Remember well, Jonathan Buck, remember well.\n\nAccording to the legend, no matter how many times the tomb has been cleaned or replaced, the leg and foot stain always reappears, always in the same spot."
