        "text": "Even though we’re still talking about what’s left to come in 2023, we should also begin looking forward to the big films of 2024. And one of those films is the latest “Ghostbusters” sequel. And thanks to a new teaser, we finally have our first look at the upcoming supernatural comedy, “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Ghostbusters’: Gil Kenan Takes Over Directing Duties From Jason Reitman For The Upcoming Sequel\n\n“Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” is a sequel to 2021’s “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” the legacy sequel that picked up from the original franchise and continued the story with a new generation of ‘Busters. That film was largely applauded by its loyal fanbase, who felt burned after Paul Feig’s reboot/remake in 2016. ‘Afterlife’ followed in the footsteps of other legacy sequels, featuring some of the old cast making emotional returns and handing the baton off to the new cast. The sequel picks up where the first film left off, now taking place in New York City, the home of the first two films.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see if the goodwill from ‘Afterlife’ is enough to carry over with the new film or if the fanbase is going to be upset that the sequel doesn’t have the same nostalgia-bait of the previous.\n\nReturning from ‘Afterlife’ are actors Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Logan Kim, Celeste O’Connor, Carrie Coon, and Paul Rudd. They’re joined by newcomers to the franchise, Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, James Acaster, and Emily Alyn Lind. Once again, the film is written by Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman. However, the director’s chair is getting a new occupant, with Kenan taking over the directing duties from Reitman.\n\nFilming began earlier this year and was wrapped up before the SAG strike began. As of now, the film is expected to release on March 29, 2024. You can watch the new trailer below:"
