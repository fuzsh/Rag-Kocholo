He’s one of those EGOT awardees, the rare entertainer that has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.\n\n“What Could Possibly Go Wrong?”\n\nAnyway, they’ve put together some other comic giants from years gone by for this documentary. Specifically, Dan Aykroyd, Jim Belushi, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nealon, and yes, holy crap, they pulled this SOB, Norm, George Wendt from the Cheers mothballs for this adaptation of Tom Standage’s book of the same name available on Amazon.\n\nIt’s five very funny guys, with Dan leading a history lesson while bartending."
