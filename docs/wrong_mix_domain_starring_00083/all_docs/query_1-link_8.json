For years, Disney has had a death grip on the animated market, but, as we enter the latter years of the 1990s, the corporation that gave us Bambi and Snow White is finding their dominance cha...\n\nBelushi\n\nOne of the criteria I often use to determine whether a documentary biography is “good” (as opposed to “mediocre”) is whether it provides something beyond what I could find by perusing the Wikipedia article about the subject. In the cas...\n\nBlues Brothers 2000, The\n\nThey're back, and this time they're not on a mission from God. Strictly speaking, however, only one of the original Blues Brothers has returned -- Dan Aykroyd's Elwood. His partner, Jake (played by the late John Belushi), died in prison, so n...\n\nChaplin\n\nChaplin is Sir Richard Attenborough's account of the life and times of film great Charlie Chaplin. The story picks up in 1894, when Charlie is five, and lasts until 1972, five years before his death in 1977. Along the way, Attenborough gives us g...\n\nDriving Miss Daisy\n\nDriving Miss Daisy, the first movie to win the Best Picture Oscar during the decade of the 1990s, is, at its heart, a buddy film.

Get on Up, like Jersey Boys, is more notable for its music than for anything else that ends up ...\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife\n\nGet ready for a deep dive into nostalgia. Ghostbusters: Afterlife, although boasting a next generation of Ghostbusters, works best for those who have seen (and at least somewhat remember) the original two Ivan Reitman films from the ‘80s. Althou...\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire\n\nAfter 40 years and four movies, Ghostbusters is starting to feel as long-in-the-tooth as the returning members of the main cast.
