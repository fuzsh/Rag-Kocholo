        "text": "It looks as though the 2020 festivities will be more cozy and intimate, spent at home with just close family members, but that doesn’t mean that we have to miss out on the magic of this festive season.\n\nOur recipe for this homely Christmas? Soft lighting, a blanket on the sofa, a Christmas movie marathon and our Pomì recipe book to warm up the atmosphere.\n\nDiscover our list of Christmas films: true classics that entertain, move and delight. For each film, we suggest one of our festive dishes to enjoy from the comfort of your sofa.\n\nHOME ALONE\n\nTop of the list is the exciting adventures of little Kevin McCallister – played by Macaulay Culkin – forgotten at home by his family during Christmas.\n\nNext up… Be sure to also check out the 1992 sequel: Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\n\nEnjoy with… the pizza Christmas tree. Children love cooking and this quick and easy recipe is perfect for preparing for the Christmas marathon together with the kids.\n\nTRADING PLACES\n\nIt’s not Christmas without Trading Places. Like a pandoro cake, it’s an essential part of the Christmas menu. The hilarious retelling of the story of the rich man and the poor man, starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, is an important part of Christmas tradition!\n\nNext up… Miracle on 34th Street If it’s not pandoro, then it’s panettone: this film is another Christmas must-have.\n\nEnjoy with… Macaroni and cheese with tomato. A classic American recipe that pays tribute to the glimpses of New York dolled up for Christmas, the true best actress in a supporting role in the two films.\n\nHOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS\n\nBased on a Dr. Seuss Christmas classic, the film follows the story of the Grinch – a grumpy, green, wrinkled creature who intends to sabotage Christmas – played by the master of disguises Jim Carrey.\n\nA fairy tale with a happy ending to enjoy a laugh with the whole family.\n\nNext up… A Christmas Carol. Another great performance by Jim Carrey as grouchy old Scrooge and his encounters with Christmas past, present and future in the screen adaptation of Dickens’ tale.\n\nEnjoy with… Pizza-style Christmas biscuits. They can be made in just a few minutes and are delicious, fragrant and tasty, without yeast or eggs.\n\nTHE HOLIDAY\n\nLast but not least... let’s make room for a romantic comedy. The Holiday tells the story of the magical atmosphere of Christmas that can kindle love during the festive season.\n\nNext up… Love Actually, another ensemble comedy that portrays all the facets of love.\n\nGet your mistletoe ready, these films make you want to kiss!\n\nEnjoy with… Puff pastry star with tuna, olives and tomato. Tasty and eye-catching, this recipe is a beautiful sight and boasts a delicious filling."
