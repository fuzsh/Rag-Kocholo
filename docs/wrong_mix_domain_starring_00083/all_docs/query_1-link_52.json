        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Lamorne Morris, Dylan O’Brien, Cory Michael Smith and Matt Wood have joined the cast of Sony Pictures’ SNL 1975, which will be directed by Jason Reitman and based on the real-life behind-the-scenes accounts of the opening episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nMorris will play Garrett Morris, O’Brien will play Dan Aykroyd, Smith will play Chevy Chase, and Wood will play John Belushi. The original screenplay is written by Reitman and Gil Kenan.\n\nOn October 11, 1975, a ferocious troupe of young comedians and writers changed television forever. SNL 1975 is the true story of what happened behind the scenes that night in the moments leading up to the first broadcast of NBC’s SNL. It depicts the chaos and magic of a revolution that almost wasn’t, counting down the minutes in real time to the infamous words, “Live from New York, it’s Saturday Night!”\n\nThe screenplay is based on an extensive series of interviews conducted by Reitman and Kenan with all the living cast members, writers and crew. Reitman, Kenan, Jason Blumenfeld, Erica Mills and Peter Rice are producing.\n\nMorris can currently be seen in FX’s fifth season of Noah Hawley’s drama series Fargo as North Dakota Deputy Witt Farr. He joined the cast of Netflix’s Unstable for Season 2 opposite Rob Lowe. Before that, he starred as the lead in the hybrid live-action/animated Hulu series Woke, inspired by the life and art of cartoonist Keith Knight.\n\nO’Brien was most recently seen starring in Ponyboi, which premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at this month’s Sundance Film Festival. Up next, he will be seen in the feature films Caddo Lake, from the writing-directing team of Logan George and Celine Held and producer M. Night Shyamalan, and Anniversary, a thriller co-starring Diane Lane, Kyle Chandler, Zoey Deutch and Phoebe Dynevor. His other credits include Searchlight feature Not Okay from writer-director Quinn Shephard; the crime drama The Outfit opposite Mark Rylance, Deutch and Johnny Flynn; Paramount’s Love and Monsters; and the popular Maze Runner franchise.\n\nBest known for his role on as the Riddler on the Fox series Gotham, Smith can currently be seen as Julianne Moore’s son in Todd Haynes’ May December. He most recently starred as Varian Fry in Anna Winger’s limited series Transatlantic opposite Gillian Jacobs and Corey Stoll for Netflix. Smith has also worked with Haynes in both Carol (as private investigator Tommy Tucker) and Wonderstruck.\n\nWood has appeared in the original Broadway cast of SpongeBob SquarePants and as husky kid icon Augustus Gloop in the Broadway First National Tour of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. TV credits include Law and Order: SVU, Instinct and Difficult People.\n\nMorris is represented by CAA, Entertainment 360 and Myman Greenspan Fox Rosenberg Mobasser Younger & Light. O’Brien is repped by WME, Principal Entertainment LA and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols, Feldman, Rogal, Shikora & Clark. Smith is repped by Circle of Confusion. Wood is repped by BRS/Gage Talent Agency."
