These elements play a crucial role in catching the attention of hiring managers and making a strong impression. To ensure your resume stands out from the competition, keep the following points in mind: Resume Length: Maintain a concise resume that is no longer than two pages. Recruiters often have limited time and prefer resumes that are easy to scan quickly. Focus on highlighting your most relevant and recent experience. Older roles can be summarized or excluded altogether to save space. Resume Design: Opt for a clean and professional design that is visually appealing. Use a simple font and avoid excessively decorative elements. Consider using sections and headings to organize your information in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.
