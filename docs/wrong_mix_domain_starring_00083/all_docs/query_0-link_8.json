I agree with their assessment that this is probably unrestrained Akroyd, and studios probably put the kibosh on some of his ideas in the other films.\n\nNothing But Trouble is my nomination.

If a movie is popular, they probably made a sequel. And if the sequel really sucks, nobody remembers that and only remembers the classic first one. Same goes for remakes. Do people remember the remakes for Total Recall or Robocop?\n\nI'll add Memoirs of an Invisible Man. A movie even John Carpenter completist like to forget.\n\nYou can probably add Journey to Bethlehem on this list sometime in the future.\n\nI doubt a musical that took massive liberties about the birth of Jesus (and barely made it's budget back) is going to stick around.\n\nI doubt hard-core religious people are going to accept it.\n\nHowever, Antonio Banderas hamming it up King Herod might make it stick around.\n\nJourney To Bethlehem - Good To Be King (Antonio Banderas, Joel Smallbone) (Movie Scene)\n\nOfficial Movie Scene for “Good To Be King (with Antonio Banderas & Joel Smallbone)” from Journey To BethlehemStream & Download “Good To Be King”: https://jou...\n\nBloodshot came out right before covid lockdowns and I was only reminded of its existence when people started making \"VIN DIESEL IS THE GRENADE MAN\" meme videos years later.\n\nThe only reason I bought a ticket for Bloodshot was because the first 500 tickets sold in the Cinemark app got a free download code for Nioh 2 on PS4. I got the game, but I didn't even see the movie.\n\nLet me tell y'all about a certain movie that came out in 1999:\n\nIt starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a character named Jericho Cane\n\nThe genre was \"horror action\"\n\nHe had to battle Satan, yes Satan, who was played by Gabriel Byrne of all people\n\nIt had a budget of $100 million dollars (that's about $184M in today dollars)\n\nIt had a soundtrack with music from Eminem, Korn, Guns n Roses, Creed and Limp Bizkit\n\nAlso just look at the theatrical poster:\n\nAnd going by the fact this thread already has a lot of replies that haven't mentioned this movie, I'm guessing the world also collectively forgot this existed.\n\nBtw Check out the how the governor finishes off Satan:\n\nEnd of Days (1999) - Falling on the Sword Scene (10/10) | Movieclips\n\nEnd of Days - Falling on the Sword: Jerry (Arnold Schwarzenegger) rebels against Satan's possession.BUY THE MOVIE: https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/detail...\n\nStreet Fighter the legends of Chun-Li.\n\nTo this day, I have never met a single person that has seen the movie. Whats even more wild, is that I cannot remember a single commercial for it and I dont think it has ever played on TV. Even the DOA movie seems to be more well knowed.\n\nBut those people missed one of the greatest performances ever put to film.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/Id7DLq7bpTw?si=mBrPt1CcQgTQJGFM\n\nLet me tell y'all about a certain movie that came out in 1999:\n\nIt starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a character named Jericho Cane\n\nThe genre was \"horror action\"\n\nHe had to battle Satan, yes Satan, who was played by Gabriel Byrne of all people\n\nIt had a budget of $100 million dollars (that's about $184M in today dollars)\n\nIt had a soundtrack with music from Eminem, Korn, Guns n Roses, Creed and Limp Bizkit\n\nAlso just look at the theatrical poster:\n\nAnd going by the fact this thread already has a lot of replies that haven't mentioned this movie, I'm guessing the world also collectively forgot this existed.\n\nBtw Check out the how the governor finishes off Satan:\n\nEnd of Days (1999) - Falling on the Sword Scene (10/10) | Movieclips\n\nEnd of Days - Falling on the Sword: Jerry (Arnold Schwarzenegger) rebels against Satan's possession.BUY THE MOVIE: https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/detail...\n\nSchwarzenegger appeared on the then-new WWF Thursday Night Smackdown! to promote that movie. Vince declared him the \"Box Office Champion\" and the show ended with him laying out Triple H before sharing a beer with Stone Cold Steve Austin. Doesn't get more 1999 than that.\n\nThat episode also featured a segment in which the Big Boss Man towed the Big Show's father's casket behind a police car with a giant bullhorn on the roof. You know, the Attitude Era.\n\nNothing But Trouble is my nomination. Dan Akroyd was basically given an unlimited budget after Ghostbusters to make this absolute bonkers movie about a Chevy Chase and Demi Moore trying to escape a backwoods judge's backwoods boobytrapped mansion, his mutant family, and John Candy in drag.\n\nAlso Tupac and Digital Underground show up.\n\nEvery bit of this movie is so bizarre, it feels like it should be a Rocky Horror style cult classic....but no one has ever heard of it that I haven't shown it to.\n\nThere have been multiple videos done online about the making of this film that have gathered over 100,000 views. To a certain population of in tune movie goers, it's not that forgotten. Like most \"bad movies\", it fascinates people.\n\nNothing But Trouble - It's Not THAT Bad - A Retrospective\n\nYou either love it or hate it, but I guarantee part of it has also stayed with you. Here's why Nothing But Trouble deserves to be remembered.Written, Present...\n\nNothing But Trouble is a Very Weird Movie\n\nToday we are going to talk about Dan Aykroyd, Ghostbusters, and how Nothing But Trouble became the infamous movie that it is today. Thank you so much for wat...\n\nExploring Nothing but Trouble - The Untold Story Behind Dan Aykroyd's Notorious Production\n\nGoodBadFlicks takes a deep dive into the insanity of Nothing but Trouble. Directed by Dan Aykroyd. ◘ PATREON ► https://goo.gl/1Gmiur◘ TEE SHIRTS ► https://ti...\n\nNothing But Trouble is my nomination. Dan Akroyd was basically given an unlimited budget after Ghostbusters to make this absolute bonkers movie about a Chevy Chase and Demi Moore trying to escape a backwoods judge's backwoods boobytrapped mansion, his mutant family, and John Candy in drag.\n\nAlso Tupac and Digital Underground show up.\n\nEvery bit of this movie is so bizarre, it feels like it should be a Rocky Horror style cult classic....but no one has ever heard of it that I haven't shown it to.\n\nI have seen this movie at least a dozen times and I own a copy of it, but I still don't believe it's a real movie.\n\nI'll throw this one out there. I know \"Benjamin Button\" has sort of become a slang/meme in the lexicon but even as a big David Fincher fan I forget this thing exists, I've only ever watched it once and barely remember anything about it other than the fact that Brad Pitt plays a dude who was born an old man.\n\nI'm sorry but no. Benjamin Button is firmly part of popular culture.\n\nThe first ever adaptation of an all-time classic manga's original chapters, and the first feature film in that series' history, all put together for a special 20th anniversary release. You'd think it'd be remembered just for being the first adaptation of famous source material material alone, or for being the first film, or for the anniversary celebration angle. What you wouldn't expect, however, is being so forgotten that it's never been seen again since theatres - not via TV, DVD, streaming, or even pirated bootlegs. 100% vanished, and even had its wikipedia article removed a few years back, and so has become even more obscure, just mentioned as a footnote in articles about the JoJo series as a whole. Wild stuff, and maybe the most recent example of an outright lost film I can think of. To this day nobody knows why it's so neglected and buried, though many disproven rumours have floated around.\n\n\"Be Cool\", the sequel to \"Get Shorty\".\n\nI remember seeing this in theaters and thinking, \"This has to be one of the most braindead movies I've ever seen.\"\n\nAnd yet, the cast is pretty stacked:\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nUma Thurman (Pulp Fiction reunion)\n\nVince Vaughn\n\nDanny Devito\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson\n\nJames Galdolfini (Tony Soprano)\n\nJames Woods\n\nHarvey Keitel\n\nCedric the Entertainer\n\nChristina Milian\n\nAndre 3000\n\nWyclef Jean\n\nGene Simmons (Kiss)\n\nRZA\n\nFred Durst (Limp Bizkit)\n\nFergie (Black Eyed Peas)\n\nThis was just on one of the HBO channels like 2 hours ago after not thinking about it in nearly 20 years.\n\nthere is a caddyshack 2\n\nand an airplane! 2\n\nI watched caddyshack 2 before seeing the original. Since the plot is pretty much the same I liked it.\n\nAt least, I only found out about it a couple years ago, which is bizarre given the actors and it being Oscar nominated.\n\nMid 90s Robin Williams\n\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola\n\nlol, okay. I enjoyed The Big Lewbowski, but definitely didn't memorize all the lines.\n\nLol to add some actual context. Yeah John Turturro wanted to reprise the Jesus character since forever, so he requested permission from the Coen brothers to make a spinoff. It's super bad and he directed and wrote the screenplay himself (Coen brothers were not involved at all)\n\nBeing a fairly ignorant parent, I saw the cover for this and thought my three-year-old would enjoy it. We watched the first 10 minutes or so and we ended up pausing it. It seemed awfully dark and edgy for the cover art. I figure maybe it was just because I didn't understand the book it was based on.\n\nDirected by Zach Snyder??\n\nEssential viewing: https://youtu.be/mpzK2CMTuAo?si=kzi8x_S4D3l4_t7w&t=1299\n\nNothing But Trouble is my nomination.

I haven't seen it in a long time so I don't know how well it holds up though.\n\nI don't think I have ever heard anybody talk about Opportunity Knocks. Dana Carvey as a con man who falls in love with someone he is conning. I remember liking it when I saw it when I was younger. Then never watched it again, until about two or 3 months ago when I saw it pop up on streaming and I still liked it. Not the best movie but has its charms.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/orrDqRLh32Q?si=-anK5bRshhwEF-4a"
