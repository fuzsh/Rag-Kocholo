        "text": "Even though Dan Aykroyd spoiled the existence of a Ghostbusters sequel well before the announcement, his return wasn’t officially confirmed by the studio. But during a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Aykroyd didn’t bother waiting for a studio announcement.\n\nVia The Hollywood Reporter, Aykroyd said “I’m not in the pictures so much anymore. We’ve got the Ghostbusters movie that we’re working on now and I will have to be performing in that. Ivan Reitman’s son Jason has written a new movie called [Ghostbusters 2020] It will be all, most of the original people and then young stars.”\n\nAykroyd co-wrote the original Ghostbusters film and co-starred as Ray Stantz. He reprised his role on the big screen in Ghostbusters 2, and more recently lent his voice and likeness to Ghostbusters: The Video Game.\n\nRELATED: Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man Gets NYCC Exclusive Toy\n\nAlthough most of the original film’s stars are expected to return, Aykroyd seemed to suggest that Bill Murray has not been locked in for a cameo. Instead, Aykroyd shared his hope that Murray will return. Besides Aykroyd, only Sigourney Weaver has said she will appear in the sequel. But Ernie Hudson is also a safe bet.\n\nGhostbusters 2020 will star Carrie Coon and Paul Rudd in leading roles. So far, all we know about Coon’s character is she’s a single mother. Mckenna Grace and Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard are co-starring as the children of Coon’s character. Sony Pictures will release Ghostbusters 2020 on July 10, 2020.\n\nAre you glad to hear that Aykroyd is officially back for Ghostbusters 2020? Let us know in the comment section below!"
