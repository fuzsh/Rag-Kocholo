        "text": "“This is one of the comedies that changed the way people look at comedies,” beamed Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire star Patton Oswalt about the comedy franchise.\n\nAs such it was a pinch-yourself moment for many of the stars as they got to soak up the stories from Ghostbusters OG cast Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson onset. For Oswalt, he was “blown away” when he walked on the recreated fire house set from the original movies.\n\n“I saw this movie when I was 13, and it melted my mind,” exclaimed Oswalt, “I’m about to see myself in a Ghostbusters movie tonight, it’s hard to wrap my head around it.”\n\nPaul Rudd, who starred in 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife, regales, “One of things that was fun about this was that didn’t take our phones. We all sat together in between set-ups, which doesn’t happen that often. And one time Dan Akyroyd was sitting there; Pat, was there, Kimal was there: How did you meet (John) Belushi? How did The Blues Brothers come about? Just really spending a good hour talking about SNL when it started, and his friendship with John Candy when they were kids. To get a front row seat to this comedic history.”\n\nHudson’s fave moments from the original 1984 movie was shooting the scene in the New York City mayor’s office when Murray’s Dr. Peter Venkman and Akyroyd’s Dr. Ray Stanz speak to truth to power to the official about the apocalypse descending on the Big Apple (Venkman hysterically emphasized, “Cats and dogs, living together — mass hysteria!”\n\nThere’s was also a chilly moment for Hudson when he was covered in slime on a freezing cold day of production in the NYC subway.\n\nMeanwhile, does Ghostbusters: After Life and Frozen Empire star Carrie Coon believe in ghosts?\n\n“We know what we don’t know,” she says, “I’m still waiting for a visitation.”\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire from Sony opens on March 22."
