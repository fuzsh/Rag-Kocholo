        "text": "Dan Aykroyd may be stuck in his quest to resurrect Ghostbusters, but now he’s resurrecting the past for a new movie endeavor.\n\nThe actor-writer-director wrote on his Facebook page late Monday night that he is working with his former Saturday Night Live castmate Chevy Chase.\n\n“Chevy (Chase) and I are about to start work on a script concept for a comedy movie,” Aykroyd wrote. “Cannot say too much about the concept, but the joy of working with him again is one that I am extremely excited about. Chevy is one of my favourite people, and one of the great anarchistic and physically committed comedians in the business.”\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 Grossing Films\n\nThis pairing directly contrasts Aykroyd’s struggle with another SNL castmember, Bill Murray, who refuses to star in a revival of the Ghostbusters franchise.\n\nThe pair has worked together on a movie set before, as Chase starred in Aykroyd’s 1991 directorial debut, Nothing but Trouble."
