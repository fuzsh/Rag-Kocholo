Zombie Town, published in 2012, tells the story of “a quiet town that is upended when 12-year-old Mike and his friend Karen watch a horror movie called Zombie Town and unexpectedly see the title characters leap off the screen and chase them through the theater”.\n\nDan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase are reuniting for the film, having previously co-starred in four films – Nothing But Trouble, Spies Like Us, Caddyshack II, and The Couch Trip. They star alongside Henry Czerny, Marlon Kazadi, Madi Monroe, Scott Thompson and Bruce McCulloch.\n\nAnimator Peter Lepeniotis directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Michael Samonek, Michael Schwartz and Jason Bourque.\n\nR.L Stine teased that Zombie Town will be released in December, and thus we’ll keep you updated as we hear more. In the meantime, here’s the poster for the film…\n\nBloody Disgusting\n\n—\n\nThank you for visiting!
