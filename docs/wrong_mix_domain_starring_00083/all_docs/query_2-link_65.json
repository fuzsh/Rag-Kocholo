The result of their efforts is Sony Pictures’ upcoming SNL 1975, a movie retelling the story of that night.\n\nRELATED: Every ‘SNL’ Cast Member Over the Years Since 1975\n\nThe pic, which Reitman and Kenan co-wrote and which Reitman is directing, tells the chaotic behind-the-scenes story of what happened that first night, just before the live cameras clicked on to launch a late-night institution and a slew of eventual stars among the young, mostly unknown troupe of comedians including John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner, all under the watchful eye of creator Lorne Michaels.\n\nSome of the fun with SNL 1975 is following as the cast assembles to play members of that iconic SNL team, with The Fabelmans star Gabriel LaBelle among the first to land a role, playing Michaels.\n\nRELATED: Who’s In The Season 49 Cast of ‘Saturday Night Live’\n\nScroll below to see what other actors have landed parts, and who they are playing. Check back as more are announced."
