        "text": "It's been a grueling 14-hour day on the set of \"The Coneheads.\"\n\nSuddenly, a strange sucking sound echoes off the avails. For the cast and\n\ncrew it's the signal that they can go home - Dan Aykroyd is ripping the\n\nplastic cone off his head.\n\nNo longer dressed like Beldar the head Conehead, Aykroyd is\n\nshorter and happier. But he still has work to do. He's one of the\n\nwriters as well as the star of \"The Coneheads,\" which he helped create as\n\na skit back in the golden age of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Tonight,\n\nrepresentatives from a toy company need to meet with him about a line of\n\nConehead toys, the assistant director needs to discuss tomorrow's shots,\n\nhis secretary hovers nearby to talk about juggling his schedule. When he\n\nfinally gets to pass through the guarded gate to the parking lot, he's\n\nspotted by a few lingering stage-door johnnies. One, an eight-year-old\n\nboy, grabs a friend by the shoulder and squeals, \"Look at that. It's Bill\n\nMurray!\"\n\nAykroyd smiles and shakes his head. \"Close,\" he says, \"but no.\"\n\n\"I know you're a Ghostbuster,\" the boy counters. 'Aren't you?\"\n\n\"That I am,\" replies Aykroyd.\n\nIndeed he is. Dan Aykroyd has been a Blues Brother, a Ghostbuster\n\nand a Conehead. He does killer impressions of Richard Nixon and Jimmy\n\nCarter. He's won an Emmy and has been nominated for an Oscar and a\n\nGrammy. Yet he can still travel unrecognized -- or at least be mistaken\n\nfor Bill Murray.\n\nUnlike others who have graduated from \"Saturday Night Live\" to\n\nsuccess in films, Aykroyd is such a gifted sketch actor that he is better\n\nknown for the characters he has played than as a comedic personality.\n\nOver the years, he's preferred to let his work speak for him, keeping a\n\nlow profile in the media, while some of his \"SNL\" contemporaries -\n\nincluding a few who followed years later - achieved major stardom, burned\n\nout and are planning their comebacks.\n\nDespite his 27 movies -- some, like \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Driving\n\nMiss Daisy,\" were blockbuster hits -- Aykroyd will be forever linked to\n\nhis days on \"SNL\" His legendary moments range from the Weekend Update\n\nnewscasts to send-ups of Nixon, Carter, Tom Snyder and Julia Child to\n\nskits featuring the Blues Brothers, Two Wild and Crazy Guys, Killer Bees\n\nand the Coneheads. He also divas one half of the show's most outrageous\n\ncomedy duo: Aykroyd and his best friend, John Belushi, were lauded as the\n\nLennon and McCartney of comedy.\n\nTogether, Aykroyd and Belushi ventured into movies with \"1941\"\n\nand \"Neighbors.\" Two characters they created for \"SNL, \"Jake and Elwood\n\nBlues, moved to the big screen in the monster-budgeted \"Blues Brothers,\"\n\nin which dozens of police cars and an entire shopping mall were\n\ndemolished. They also recorded best-selling albums and performed to\n\nsold-out audiences, even opening for the Rolling Stones and getting a\n\nGrammy nomination for best new artists. As Elwood, Aykroyd played a\n\nconvincing harp and did one of the funniest and stiffest shuffles ever\n\nseen onstage.\n\nWhen Belushi died of a drug overdose in 1982, Aykroyd began a\n\nsolo career. He thrived, landing starring roles opposite Eddie Murphy in\n\n\"Trading Places,\" Walter Matthau in \"The Couch Trip\" and Kim Basinger in\n\n\"My Stepmother Is an Alien.\" He co-wrote \"Ghostbusters,\" in which he\n\nstarred with Harold Ramis and Bill Murray. It was the number-one-grossing\n\ncomedy until it was topped in 1990 by \"Home Alone.\" Aykroyd also earned\n\ngood reviews for his re-creation of the role of Sergeant Joe Friday in\n\nthe movie version of \"Dragnet,\" another of his script-writing efforts.\n\nJust when it seemed as if Aykroyd were destined to a career of\n\nsweet if often silly comedies, he was a surprising casting choice as the\n\nworried son in \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" directed by Bruce Beresford. The\n\nfilm won the 1990 Oscar for best picture, and Aykroyd earned a best\n\nsupporting actor nomination. That was followed by a role in \"Sneakers\"\n\nwith Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier. Next, Sir Richard Attenborough\n\ncast him in \"Chaplin,\" which he finished shortly before launching into\n\n\"The Coneheads\" with his boss at \"SNL,\" Lorne Michaels.\n\nAykroyd was born in Ottawa, Canada into a practical-joking,\n\nmovie-watching family in which seances were typical Saturday night\n\nentertainment. He attended Catholic schools and over the years worked at\n\njobs that pointed many places other than show business. He drove mail\n\ntrucks, load-tested runways for jumbo jets, surveyed roads and wrote a\n\nmanual for penitentiary guards.\n\nAt Carleton University in Ottawa he became involved in a theater\n\ngroup, the first of several comedy ensembles he joined. He was soon\n\nappearing on Canadian TV in what he describes as a hip precursor to\n\n\"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in,\" which led to a stint with the Second City\n\ntroupe in Toronto with co-stars Gilda Radner and John Candy. While in\n\nToronto he met Belushi, then a performer with Second City in Chicago.\n\nLike Belushi, Aykroyd had his wild years, though he says he\n\npreferred wine and beer to the heavy drugs that brought down Belushi. He\n\nloved hanging out with friends, and he opened the Blues Bar in lower\n\nManhattan for late-night or, often, all-night parties.\n\nNow his life is far quieter. On the set of \"Doctor Detroit,\"\n\nAykroyd fell in love with his co-star, Donna Dixon (who appeared in\n\n\"Wayne's World\"). They married and have a daughter, Danielle, now three.\n\nThe family spends as much time as possible at its 70-acre lakeside farm\n\nin Ontario. When the Aykroyds are there, the serenity of the Canadian\n\nnights is occasionally broken by the sound of one of Aykroyd's several\n\nmodified Harley-Davidsons; he's an obsessed biker. He planned to head\n\nback to Canada as soon as \"The Coneheads\" wrapped.\n\nContributing Editor David Sheff, whose last tete-a-tete in these\n\npages was with musician-philosopher Frank Zappa, took on the tete-a-cone.\n\nHere is Sheg's report: \"When I first met Aykroyd, in 1979, he had\n\nrecently completed 'The Blues Brothers.' He was a less-than-eager\n\ninterview subject, seemingly uncomfortable talking about most aspects of\n\nhis life. In the years since then, everything seems to have changed, not\n\nonly in his life and career but in him. For this interview he was\n\nforthcoming and at ease. Often, he came across as overly earnest --\n\nalmost corny -- as if time had taken the rebel out of him. But there's no\n\ndoubt he seemed genuinely happier.\n\n\"I met with Aykroyd on the set of 'The Coneheads,' which was\n\nbeing filmed in Los Angeles. He was in costume for much of the interview,\n\nand I found it disconcerting, if somehow appropriate, to look up at him\n\nduring impassioned conversations and realize I was talking with a\n\nConehead.\"\n\nPLAYBOY: Is it a surprise to find yourself back en cone after all these\n\nyears?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah. I thought we had put away the cones for good. But Lorne\n\n[Michaels], now a successful movie producer after Wayne's World,\n\nthought it was the most logical project.\n\nPLAYBOY: What originally inspired the Coneheads?\n\nAYKROYD: I was looking at the TV and thinking, If people's heads were\n\nlike this [he presses the sides of his skull together], they\n\ncould fill the screen a little more.\n\nPLAYBOY: Has the cone changed over the years?\n\nAYKROYD: The original was just a cheap piece of plastic that was glued to\n\nthe forehead and around the top of the ears. This cone is done\n\nby a top-notch, professional makeup guy, David Miller, who did\n\nthe Freddy Krueger makeup.\n\nPLAYBOY: It's a little unsettling.\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah, it kind of frightens small children.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is it uncomfortable?\n\nAYKROYD: No, but I bump my head a lot because I forget how tall I am. It\n\nadds six inches. There are two moments of discomfort when they\n\nput it on. I imagine it's like being decapitated or getting a\n\nlethal injection: You feel a pinprick and then it's all over.\n\nWith this you feel two applications of cold glue -- to your neck\n\nand forehead -- and that's it. It's comfortable enough for me to\n\ntake naps in. Actually, it's like wearing a dunce cap all day,\n\nwhich former teachers of mine might find fitting.\n\nPLAYBOY: Since Wayne's World, which also started as a skit on Saturday\n\nNight Live, was such a success, do you feel extra pressure with\n\nThe Coneheads?\n\nAYKROYD: Oh, yeah. They're going to be sitting there with their arms\n\nfolded, tapping their feet, waiting for this one to bomb. But\n\nthat can't really affect what I'm doing here. The writing's\n\ngood. The story's great. I'm reasonably confident because I know\n\npeople want to laugh. It's time for laughter.\n\nPLAYBOY: Why now?\n\nAYKROYD: People always need laughter. It's well known that laughter\n\nproduces some kind of endocrinologic response that cures and is\n\notherwise good for people. The more the better.\n\nPLAYBOY: Are hard times -- recessions, ethnic wars abroad, inner-city\n\ntensions -- fertile times for comedy?\n\nAYKROYD: There was a profusion of light-hearted movies in the Thirties,\n\nall meant to get people's minds off the Depression, but I don't\n\nthink filmmakers consciously make movies to take people's minds\n\noff hard times.\n\nPLAYBOY: You're working with several of your former co-stars from\n\nSaturday Night Live. Do you feel like you're in a time warp?\n\nAYKROYD: Having Jane [Curtin] walk in and -- bang -- go right into the\n\ncharacter, just where we left off, is great. It's like it never\n\nstopped. Some of us have put on weight or gotten gray, but it's\n\nbetter. The skills increase over time.\n\nPLAYBOY: What about your sense of humor?\n\nAYKROYD: It's sort of the same. We're still into shock humor and we still\n\ndeal with the absurd.\n\nPLAYBOY: Has what's funny changed?\n\nAYKROYD: Some things are always going to make people laugh. In\n\nNeanderthal times, people probably laughed at jokes about\n\nburning themselves with fire and how funny their mates looked.\n\nWe're laughing at the same things today -- the things in our\n\nlives, human behavior. We laugh at toilet jokes, at shock. Then\n\nyou get into the Nineties and you have guys like Sam Kinison,\n\nGod rest his soul, and Andrew Dice Clay -- the abrasive and\n\ncaustic humorists. That's really what has changed. It's like\n\neverything is through the top now and we have people out there\n\nwho are striving to shock. I don't know what the year 2000 will\n\nbring. Maybe guys will be chopping off their fingers.\n\nPLAYBOY: Are there places where lines should be drawn?\n\nAYKROYD: I'm not much into bathroom humor unless it is really well done.\n\nWe did a skit called the Widettes, in which the characters had\n\nhuge haunches. Once, we hung toilet paper out of the backs of\n\ntheir pants. That was justified. I have never been into\n\ngratuitous sex or swearing, though; it has to have a purpose.\n\nPLAYBOY: How about the meanness -- you mentioned Clay and Kinison?\n\nAYKROYD: It makes me laugh, but I don't do that kind of thing.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you find some of it in questionable taste?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah, and I don't really like vulgar stuff. People may call\n\nliquefying a bass vulgar, but I don't think so.\n\nPLAYBOY: You're referring to the Bass-o-matic routine you did on Saturday\n\nNight Live.\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah. But to people who think that liquefying a bass is\n\noffensive, I have to point out that this woman in Canada, sort\n\nof our Julia Child, uses the blender to make fish soup -- bones,\n\nhead and all.\n\nPLAYBOY: Are there certain targets that should be off-limits?\n\nAYKROYD: I don't think the weak, oppressed, poverty-stricken and\n\nhandicapped should be targets, unless they do it themselves, and\n\nthen I'm ready to laugh. There are things I wouldn't do, but it\n\ndepends on the writing. If it's good, I'll do just about\n\nanything. You're talking to the man who had his pants down below\n\nhis hips and who then put a pencil between his cheeks -- on\n\nnational television.\n\nPLAYBOY: What was the occasion?\n\nAYKROYD: I was playing a refrigerator repairman on Saturday Night Live.\n\nIt was a nerd sketch -- the Lupners -- with Billy [Murray] and\n\nGilda [Radner]. I came in as the refrigerator repairman and the\n\nnerds were breaking up watching me move the fridge because I was\n\none of those guys who wear their belts very low. I just got\n\ndown like this [he demonstrates] and did the character, and when\n\nI put the pencil in, I rested it -- against broadcast standards'\n\nrequest -- right there between the cheeks. Now, people may argue\n\nthat was as vulgar and cheap as you can get, and at first I\n\ndidn't want to do it. Lorne talked me into it. The audience\n\nhowled. It was a magic moment You have to watch the tape to see\n\nhow subtle that insertion was.\n\nPLAYBOY: How tough was it to make the move from TV to films?\n\nAYKROYD: Movies are a whole other canvas, like working with acrylics\n\ncompared with modeling clay. TV is like skywriting and movies\n\nare more like setting up dominoes and letting them fall.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is it frustrating to work in movies where you have less control\n\nover the material?\n\nAYKROYD: The frustration is that good ideas are put into a blender. There\n\nare so many factors -- writers, producers, directors, actors and\n\nothers -- that make or break what might be a great idea. We go\n\ninto these projects with the best intentions, willing to do the\n\nbest work possible. You just never know how they're going to\n\nturn out. You can do only so much, and so much of movies is out\n\nof your control. On the other hand, when it works there's\n\nnothing else like it.\n\nPLAYBOY: It seemed to work for you in Driving Miss Daisy. Many people\n\nthought you were an unusual choice for that role.\n\nAYKROYD: A friend saw the play and said the part was good for me, so when\n\nI heard they were making the movie, I had my agent call. I sat\n\ndown with the producer, Richard Zanuck, and told him I'd like to\n\ndo it. I was thrilled when I got it.\n\nPLAYBOY: Were you consciously trying to get away from your usual comedic\n\nroles?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah, I wanted a little variety in the career.\n\nPLAYBOY: What was your reaction to the Academy Award nomination?\n\nAYKROYD: Obviously it was very gratifying. It sort of legitimized my\n\nefforts.\n\nPLAYBOY: Were you surprised?\n\nAYKROYD: Oh, yeah. But I knew I wasn't going to win because I had seen\n\nGlory. I knew Denzel [Washington's] performance was the one.\n\nBut it was cool. I still went to the show. Morgan Freeman and I\n\nhopped up and down like excited little kids when Driving Miss\n\nDaisy won Best Picture. If I never do another dramatic part, I\n\ncan look back and say I was in the best picture of 1989.\n\nPLAYBOY: After doing all those comedies, did you have any trouble playing\n\na more serious part?\n\nAYKROYD: No. The acting is different but it's still the same. The hardest\n\npart is getting producers and directors to consider you when\n\nthey already think of you as a comic actor. For me it has less\n\nto do with what kind of movie it is than who I'm working with.\n\nIn Driving Miss Daisy, I got a chance to work with Jessica Tandy\n\nand Morgan Freeman. More recently I did Sneakers with Robert\n\nRedford and Sidney Poitier. By now I've worked with some of the\n\nbest. Walter Matthau in The Couch Trip, Bill Murray in\n\nGhostbusters, Eddie Murphy in Trading Places, Tom Hanks in\n\nDragnet.\n\nPLAYBOY: You wrote Dragnet, one of your many movies featuring cops and\n\nrobbers. From where does the fascination with crime come?\n\nAYKROYD: I like to explore adventures and events that I wouldn't normally\n\nbe part of. I'm an armchair quarterback. I don't really have to\n\nlive that life, but I can act it.\n\nPLAYBOY: You even studied criminology.\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah, in college. I gravitated immediately to sociology and\n\nabnormal and deviate psych.\n\nPLAYBOY: Ever think of being a cop?\n\nAYKROYD: I couldn't be a cop because I have two differently colored eyes\n\nand webbed feet. It means I'm a genetic mutant and would\n\nprobably be rejected for any kind of service.\n\nPLAYBOY: So what's behind your interest?\n\nAYKROYD: I was curious about what makes a person turn from the straight\n\nand narrow to a life of crime. And the other side of it is law\n\nenforcement. I have a lot of friends who are cops.\n\nPLAYBOY: After you ruled out police work, what led you to acting?\n\nAYKROYD: I had done plays in college in Ottawa. I was kind of hoping\n\nsomething would come up so I wouldn't have to go through and get\n\nthe degree. When I was seventeen, Valerie Bromfield, who was a\n\nwriter and performer in Ottawa, got me started doing a cable\n\nshow. She had met Lorne Michaels, who was doing a show called\n\nthe Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour, sort of like the Canadian\n\nRowan and Martin, but earlier. They had long hair and they were\n\nthe only hip thing Canada had seen. I eventually became involved\n\nin that. Then I went back to school until Valerie dragged me out\n\nand moved me to Toronto for good. We formed a comedy team doing\n\nMike Nichols and Elaine May -- type bits. We used to go on after\n\na transvestite named Pascal. He/she opened for us. This led to\n\nSecond City.\n\nPLAYBOY: Where you worked with Gilda Radner for the first time.\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah. Gilda was already breaking hearts left and right. All the\n\nguys loved her. You know how Bill Murray would pick her up and\n\ntwirl her around his head? I felt that way about Gilda.\n\nPLAYBOY: Huh?<\n\nAYKROYD: I would express it differently, but I understood it when Billy\n\nwould pick her up and twirl her around and begin biting her.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did you remain friends with her after SNL?\n\nAYKROYD: We all kind of lost touch with Gilda. She married Gene Wilder\n\nand built a life with him. Our paths didn't intersect for many\n\nyears, until I saw her at a party at Laraine Newman's house one\n\nyear before she died. Everyone there was around her like filings\n\naround a magnet. But we had a lot of years together at Second\n\nCity and then on Saturday Night.\n\nPLAYBOY: How did you get the job on Saturday Night Live?\n\nAYKROYD: John Candy and I were both at Second City and we took a drive to\n\nPasadena in his Mercury Cougar to be at a dinner-theater show\n\nthat Second City was opening. It took thirty-eight hours, and as\n\nsoon as we arrived, Lorne Michaels called and asked me to come\n\nback for an audition. I flew to New York. People were lined up\n\neverywhere. I thought, I'm not prepared for this, this is crazy.\n\nBut I went in and Lorne put me behind a desk to do a news\n\nreport, a la Weekend Update. That was 1974. I was with SNL\n\nthrough 1979. I've often thought, If I ever get a tattoo, it's\n\ngoing to be a little TV set with SNL 75-79. It's like if you\n\nspend time on the USS Guadalcanal and get a patch.\n\nPLAYBOY: Have you ever heard from the subjects you skewered on SNL?\n\nAYKROYD: No, though I was in an elevator with Tom Snyder. I don't think\n\nhe recognized me. I hope he didn't. I tried to disguise myself.\n\nPLAYBOY: What about Jimmy Carter?\n\nAYKROYD: I performed with Chevy Chase at the Carter inaugural. Chevy\n\nplayed the chief justice swearing in Carter. I did Carter. There\n\nwe were, at the Kennedy Center, with all the people who move the\n\nmachinery of government sitting there. And I came out onstage\n\nin a jeans jacket and the traditional inaugural stovepipe hat,\n\nand Chevy swore me in using the Crest toothpaste oral dentifrice\n\npledge. Later we found out that at the moment Chevy and I\n\nstepped onstage, Carter was called away. He was told that there\n\nwas an important Department of Defense briefing, but I'm sure\n\nthey just wanted to get him out of there.\n\nPLAYBOY: But he probably had to approve your appearance in the first\n\nplace, didn't he?\n\nAYKROYD: No. He asked Chevy to come and do Ford. Chevy snuck me in.\n\nPLAYBOY: Who was your favorite subject to impersonate?\n\nAYKROYD: Nixon. I mean, he was just rich. Reagan was good, too.\n\nRepublicans are much richer to do. Ross Perot, too. What a\n\ndream for an impressionist. That voice, that look.\n\nPLAYBOY: Have you tried doing Clinton or Gore?\n\nAYKROYD: Clinton is Phil Hartman's territory. I could look at Gore. There\n\nare a few things there -- the posture, the stance, the pace. But\n\nfor me there's nothing like good old Nixon.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you vote for the candidate who would be the best target for\n\nparody?\n\nAYKROYD: As a Canadian citizen I don't have a vote in this country. My\n\nwife has the vote in the family and I try to convince her, but\n\nshe votes the way she wants.\n\nPLAYBOY: How would you describe your political bent?\n\nAYKROYD: In Canada I would probably be classified as a far-left liberal,\n\nanti-socialist, free enterprise capitalist.\n\nPLAYBOY: Where do you stand on the Quebec secession?\n\nAYKROYD: I will stand behind Quebec. Whatever the citizens of that\n\nbeautiful part of the world do, I will stand behind them. If\n\nthey choose to separate from the rest of Canada, I will support\n\nthem, with reluctance, because I don't want to see my nation\n\nsplinter. My mother is full French Canadian and I'm half\n\nFrench-Canadian. She feels the same way: sad, sorry things\n\nhaven't been worked out. But the problem there dates back to\n\nwhen the English seized the nation and called it English Canada.\n\nQuebec license plates read JE ME SOUVIENS, which means, \"I\n\nremember.\" Basically it means, \"I remember how I was fucked over\n\nby the English.\" They remember that they are really French and a\n\nseparate cultural entity.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did you begin your training as a performer in Canada?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah. My parents sent me to drama and improv classes when I was\n\ntwelve. I was distracted by theater and the arts and acting all\n\nthe way through. Other fathers made their kids toy guns; my\n\nfather carved me a little wooden microphone, painted black on\n\nthe top, with a rope for a cord.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is a sense of humor hereditary?\n\nAYKROYD: In my case. My grandmother on my father's side was always\n\nwriting verse and poetry and couplets and funny rhymes with\n\nlittle lessons in them. Then there was my grandfather, who had a\n\nnice, wry sense of humor. On my mother's side of the family\n\nthere was always music around, someone banging on the piano,\n\nsinging a song.\n\nPLAYBOY: In the movie The Blues Brothers you poke fun at Catholicism. Was\n\nyour family religious?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah, I was an altar boy.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did your parents cringe at your irreverence?\n\nAYKROYD: Not really. They know it's true. And I'm not slamming religion.\n\nI'm not what you would call a fervent practicing Catholic, but I\n\ndo slip in the back door of church a couple times a year.\n\nPLAYBOY: Why?\n\nAYKROYD: I like the music. I have a faith of a kind. I'm not a born-again\n\nChristian, but I have some faith. I think that God is in and\n\naround all of us, in everything, and thus we're all connected. I\n\nhave always believed that. I feel a link to the squirrels\n\noutside, and that's what God is to me. If He introduces Himself\n\nto me, sits me down and tells me something different, then I\n\nwill reconsider my feelings.\n\nPLAYBOY: It sounds as if you had a nice, cheery childhood, not the\n\ntormented childhood many comics endure.\n\nAYKROYD: My parents and grandparents and my home life were warm and\n\nbeautiful, with probably the normal deficiencies. My mother and\n\nfather both worked. I went to work at fourteen because I had a\n\nlifestyle to maintain. I wanted to be out in the world\n\nexploring, I wanted to have money for dances and movies. My\n\nfather earned a government salary and my mother had a salary\n\nbarely enough to keep the car, the house, the groceries going.\n\nNo way I could lie around and wait for a BMW.\n\nPLAYBOY: Were you exposed to big-name comics when you were young?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah. I appreciated all the great practitioners of the craft --\n\nJack Benny, George Burns. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in those road\n\npictures. Desi Arnaz, one of the great, great comedians; Lucille\n\nBall, amazing timing. Carol Burnett, Carl Reiner, Sid Caesar,\n\nMorey Amsterdam -- all the classics -- Dick Van Dyke and Mary\n\nTyler Moore on the early show. Red Skelton. Jackie Gleason and\n\nArt Carney in The Honeymooners. The work Walter Matthau and Jack\n\nLemmon did together. Of course, Bob Newhart, Tim Conway and\n\nHarvey Korman. I grew up with these people.\n\nPLAYBOY: Were you a Charlie Chaplin fan? Did that weigh in your decision\n\nto take a role in Chaplin?\n\nAYKROYD: Not really. I saw all his movies when I was a kid. My dad would\n\nrent them and show them on a bedsheet in the basement. But I\n\npreferred the Keystone Cops, Laurel and Hardy, and Buster\n\nKeaton. I appreciate Chaplin more after making the movie. It was\n\na fun movie to make and it was incredible to work with Sir\n\nRichard Attenborough, who directed it. That one just came to me.\n\nI was asked to read for the part.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is it more interesting for you when you write the script, too?\n\nAYKROYD: I love writing scripts. But it's different. It is also great to\n\nhave a truly good script written by someone else and to come in\n\nand just do the job as an actor.\n\nPLAYBOY: Were you writing most of your stuff back in the SNL days?\n\nAYKROYD: I had nothing to do with many of the great pieces. James Downey,\n\nwho was a producer of the show, wrote the Two Wild and Crazy\n\nGuys skit, though Steve [Martin] and I came up with the idea.\n\nSteve came up with his continental guy, which I fused with my\n\nCzech architect. It was like dealing with split personalities.\n\nJulia Child cutting her hand and bleeding everywhere was written\n\nby Al Franken and Tom Davis. Belushi wrote a great piece for me\n\nabout the Swiss army gun. Instead of spoons and blades, it had\n\nblowtorches and bazookas and all. I wrote some pieces with Alan\n\nZweibel, who went on to produce It's Garry Shandling's Show and\n\nwho wrote Dragnet with me. We did The Headcheese Cash Machine\n\nsketch, in which all U.S. currency has been converted to\n\nheadcheese.\n\nPLAYBOY: Were there limits to how far you could go on Saturday Night?\n\nAYKROYD: They didn't want me to put the pencil between my cheeks. We had\n\nto fight over some things. Placenta Helper was a big fight.\n\nPLAYBOY: Remind us.\n\nAYKROYD: It was like Hamburger Helper for placentas. There was this New\n\nAge, Greening of America sort of concept where the husband would\n\neat the placenta for all kinds of strange reasons. Franken and\n\nDavis wrote it but it never got on the air. But there weren't\n\ntoo many fights. Some of the Weekend Update fights were pretty\n\nextensive. Lorne would fight for us every time. If a writer\n\nbelieved in something and wouldn't give up, Lorne would fight to\n\nthe wall.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did he usually win?\n\nAYKROYD: Eighty percent of the time. The rest of the time they drew the\n\nline. I think we had to fight to say 'Jane, you ignorant slut\"\n\nwhen we were doing our point-counterpoint thing. The word slut\n\nwas the problem. Another thing we did was have the audience send\n\nin joints. We did a bit saying, \"Pot is bad, so send your joints\n\nto us.\" And people sent us joints.\n\nPLAYBOY: How much pot came in?\n\nAYKROYD: Many envelopes. Some good, some not so hot, some homegrown, some\n\nreal good. A lot of pot was sent in. And dollars. Another time\n\nwe asked for dollars. I think it's illegal to get money. I think\n\nSoupy Sales did it once and was chastised for it.\n\nPLAYBOY: What do you think of the current SNL?\n\nAYKROYD: I'm a big, big fan. I watch whenever I don't fall asleep.\n\nPLAYBOY: Does it amaze you that the show is still going?\n\nAYKROYD: Definitely. It was touch and go there for a while because they\n\nthought it wasn't going to succeed after everybody left.\n\nPLAYBOY: You didn't go back to guest on the show for years. What took so\n\nlong?\n\nAYKROYD: The fact of the matter is it was emotionally trying for me to go\n\nback to 8H.\n\nPLAYBOY: 8H?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah, 8H, the studio at NBC where we made Saturday Night. I had\n\nbig memories of John. I remember all kinds of things -- him\n\nbeing wheeled down the halls when he twisted his knee after\n\ndoing the twist offstage and then whirling out, taking a bow and\n\nheading right into the orchestra pit. Things like that. I still\n\nsee him in the halls there. I go through such emotion. I guess I\n\nwas a little afraid of the feelings that would well up. I was\n\nafraid I'd go up there and get maudlin.\n\nPLAYBOY: When did you first work together?\n\nAYKROYD: I came down on my bike from Toronto to Manhattan and did a guest\n\nspot on the National Lampoon Radio record that he was working\n\non. I was a drummer on a Helen Reddy parody. We started to work\n\ntogether in earnest on Saturday Night.\n\nPLAYBOY: How would you characterize the relationship?\n\nAYKROYD: We just immediately clicked and became fast friends. We brought\n\neach other different sensibilities. He introduced me to the\n\nAllman Brothers and Bad Company and heavy metal and I introduced\n\nhim to old blues. He took me under his wing. He had the capacity\n\nto sweep you along into his rhythm. With John you just kind of\n\njumped onto the inner tube and took a ride. John and his wife,\n\nJudy, let me stay in their apartment. I slept at the foot of\n\ntheir bed for almost a year, because I was commuting from Canada\n\nwhen I wasn't sure whether I was going to move to New York. They\n\nwere sort of like my aunt and uncle.\n\nPLAYBOY: Can you describe what each of you brought to the collaboration?\n\nAYKROYD: It's one of those mystery things of instant chemistry. The two\n\nof us together had a good look. Both of us would play straight\n\nand both of us would play support. I don't know. It was just one\n\nof those things.\n\nPLAYBOY: Somebody called you and John the Lennon and McCartney of comedy.\n\nAYKROYD: For a while I guess we were. Elaine May and Mike Nichols and Art\n\nCarney and Jackie Gleason -- there are a lot of great teams\n\naround. We had our moment.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did you have a favorite moment together?\n\nAYKROYD: On the show doing the Nixon and Kissinger thing. I think Richard\n\nand Henry bonded us.\n\nPLAYBOY: What do you remember about hearing the news that he had died?\n\nAYKROYD: Well, you know, it was over for me very quickly. It was really\n\nover for me in the first minute I realized that he was gone.\n\nPLAYBOY: Had you tried to intervene when it was clear he was having\n\nproblems with drugs?\n\nAYKROYD: We all tried to talk to him. It was hard because he refused help\n\nfrom people who loved him. In retrospect I see that the Betty\n\nFord confrontation technique is about the only way we could have\n\ndone anything, but if we had used it, I can see him getting mad\n\nat all of us and storming out the door and disappearing for\n\ndays. We would have literally had to handcuff him, and I think\n\nthat's what we should have done. He made progress the summer\n\nbefore he died. He was completely off the powders. But he got\n\nfrustrated.\n\nPLAYBOY: By what?\n\nAYKROYD: The business. And there were people around to hand him anything\n\nhe wanted.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you blame those people?\n\nAYKROYD: Well, you can be sure that with all those people, it was John\n\nwho was running their lives, not the other way around. He was\n\nhaving them come and go as he wanted. He was the captain of his\n\nown ship. He was at the helm. Or maybe he wasn't, and that's the\n\ntrouble. He was downstairs in the galley and there was no one\n\nat the helm. So I can look back only with great fondness and a\n\nlittle anger. But we had eight good, rich, fulfilling years\n\ntogether, creatively and in terms of a friendship.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did you expect something like that to happen?\n\nAYKROYD: He said he was heading for an early grave. He was always\n\nalluding to that. But that's no reason why we should have\n\naccepted it.\n\nPLAYBOY: It sounds as if you feel somewhat guilty.\n\nAYKROYD: It's very hard when someone doesn't want to change, or if they\n\nwant to change and their will is weak. But I regret that I\n\nwasn't stronger, and in a way I do feel a little bit of guilt\n\nfor letting him slip through my fingers. But there were times\n\nwhen I did try and there were times when I was effective. Times\n\nwhen he did listen to me. I feel good about the occasions when I\n\nwas able to help and bad about the occasions when I slipped up.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did you hear about his death from Judy?\n\nAYKROYD: No. I told Judy. I got the call from [our manager] Bernie\n\nBrillstein. He called me at the office in New York. It was a\n\nbeautiful March day and absolutely spectacular in New York. The\n\nweather was warm and clear and the streets were full of people\n\nenjoying the sunshine. I'll never forget that walk from 150\n\nFifth Avenue to Morton Street to Judy's house, because I was\n\nthinking, I can't get in a cab, I've got to keep walking.\n\nRichard Pryor described it when he was burned: He just kept\n\nrunning to stay alive. He knew if he stopped he was going to\n\ndie. I had that same desperation. I knew if I stopped, it was\n\ngoing to get me, so I just had to walk and get there before Judy\n\nheard it on the radio. I managed to get there and I told her.\n\n\"He's dying\" is all I said. And that was the most painful part\n\nfor me. After John, Gilda died. I guess the only question is,\n\nWho's next? Gilda and John are gone, and gone before the close\n\nof a millennium, which is kind of frightening, because it didn't\n\nhave to happen. Her cancer should have been detected much\n\nearlier. And John did not have to die from that speedball,\n\nbecause he should have just left L.A. He shouldn't have been\n\nhanging around with those people. He should never have gotten to\n\nthe point where he was fucking with that shit.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did what happened to John affect your views on drugs?\n\nAYKROYD: As I've always said, we're born in this pure vessel and it's our\n\nchoice what we want to do with it. There are a lot of pleasures\n\nout there. Everyone has to decide. I don't crusade against\n\ndrugs. I have a resistance to that. I suppose I say, Just be\n\nmoderate, just be careful. Look at the destruction they've\n\ncaused. John was a shell that washed up on a beach in the tidal\n\nwave of the billion-dollar cocaine industry. It's a big\n\nbusiness.\n\nPLAYBOY: Could you have gone down a path similar to John's?\n\nAYKROYD: I was never into the powders. Maybe the difference was this: In\n\na sense, of the two of us, John seemed to have the harder\n\nexterior, a more macho, male, harder thing going. In reality,\n\nthough, deep down, I'm the boulder, he was the softy. I might\n\nhave been the one who was more accommodating and more open when\n\nyou'd meet us, but I'm also the one with the controlled edge and\n\nthe hardness. He was the soft innocent. And my edge and coldness\n\nkept me from those pursuits, whereas his softness and innocence\n\nmade him vulnerable. To hide it, to close that up, he used drugs\n\n-- as armor.\n\nPLAYBOY: Even though John is dead, we've heard the Blues Brothers are\n\nmaking a comeback. Why?\n\nAYKROYD: Well, after John died I thought that would be it. But right\n\nafter, I met this friend, Isaac Tigrett, who had lost two\n\nbrothers to tragic circumstances, and his grief was so much\n\nbigger than mine could ever be. He helped me get over John's\n\ndeath. We became partners in the Hard Rock Cafe enterprise east\n\nof the Mississippi. He ran it, built several restaurants, went\n\npublic and sold the company for a hundred million English\n\npounds. So I'm out of that, but every time we opened a Hard Rock\n\nCafe, the Blues Brothers band came together. The original band.\n\nFor a while our co-singer was Sam Moore of Sam and Dave. Then\n\nthe band asked if we would license them the name so they could\n\ntour. Judy and I said, \"Go for it\"; we get a small percentage of\n\nthe take. I go out and play the harp sometimes. We do Soul Man\n\nand Knock on Wood. We rip the house apart.\n\nPLAYBOY: How do you rate your musical abilities?\n\nAYKROYD: I'm a great emcee -- front man and I can move onstage. It's\n\nfunny and exciting to see a man of two hundred-plus pounds\n\nmoving in such a way that it looks like he knows reasonably well\n\nwhere he's going and he's not going to hurt people.\n\nPLAYBOY: What are your musical tastes these days?\n\nAYKROYD: I listen a lot. My favorites are the Black Crowes, Robert Cray,\n\nBonnie Raitt, Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughan, Kim Wilson and the\n\nThunderbirds. There's also a new band called Blues Traveler\n\nwith an amazing new young harmonica player named John Popper.\n\nPLAYBOY: Might there be another Blues Brothers movie?\n\nAYKROYD: I'm working on a story with John Landis, who directed the\n\noriginal. We're going to try to bring back everybody from the\n\nfirst movie. We have to convince the studio. The walls of\n\nUniversal are still stained from the first Blues Brothers movie.\n\nPLAYBOY: Stained? Didn't Universal make money on that?\n\nAYKROYD: Not really, because it cost so much. They made their money back,\n\nbut it was traumatic getting the movie made. It was an enormous\n\nproduction. John was out of control.\n\nPLAYBOY: You've often been criticized for creating movies with runaway\n\nbudgets.\n\nAYKROYD: We are always criticized for costs -- for 1941, Ghostbusters,\n\nBlues Brothers -- but that money doesn't go into the pockets of\n\nthe actors and directors, it goes into the pockets of labor.\n\nPLAYBOY: And special effects and wrecked cars....\n\nAYKROYD: The major expense of Blues Brothers was not the seventy police\n\ncars we bought from the Chicago Police Department. We paid only\n\n$700 each for them. The major expense was labor, so that's good,\n\nit gets people working, and why shouldn't the profits of the\n\nmega-corporations be reinvested in the trades of this industry?\n\nIf I write a big show and it costs a lot of money, I make no\n\napologies. I'd be a wealthier man today and a better businessman\n\nif I sat down and wrote small movies that cost little and\n\nbrought in lots.\n\nPLAYBOY: Will you continue to make sequels -- whether based on the Blues\n\nBrothers, Ghostbusters, Coneheads or others?\n\nAYKROYD: As long as there is something new to do with them and it's\n\nenjoyable. It's kind of nice to have built-in franchises. The\n\none I don't think we'll necessarily further exploit is\n\nGhostbusters. It looks like that's about had its run.\n\nPLAYBOY: Because Ghostbusters II did poorly?\n\nAYKROYD: Yeah. It opened and Batman opened the next weekend and wiped us\n\nout that summer. Although we made a good movie, it just wasn't\n\nas commercially successful as everybody thought it would be. If\n\nI could get that team together, it would be a real dream,\n\nbecause I think there's a great story to be told. But it won't\n\nbe for a while. By the way, I heard a great ghost story about an\n\nold Manhattan hotel, the Sheraton, that is now the Chinese\n\nconsulate on 42nd Street on the West Side. We were shooting on\n\nthe fifth floor in a banquet room. I was outside having a smoke\n\nand I saw this guy go down the hall in an Air Force jacket with\n\nmaster sergeant stripes. I asked him what was up. He told me he\n\nwas an electronic-countermeasures technician who installs ECM\n\npacks on F-16s and F-106s and all that. He told me that his\n\nfather worked in the building and then he mentioned, \"We can't\n\nkeep guards.\" When I asked what he meant, he said they had gone\n\nthrough five security guards. They would come running\n\ndownstairs, yelling, \"You can keep your job.\" They finally\n\nquestioned one, who said, \"I was making my rounds and I saw\n\nsomething come through a wall.\" When the man was asked what he\n\nhad seen, he said, \"It was a man's head and shoulders. He was\n\nwearing red.\" So this guy and his dad and brother go up there to\n\ncheck it out. They were walking on the fifth floor and they saw\n\nsomething go across the hall: a guy wearing a red chef's hat and\n\nholding a knife and fork. They followed him into the kitchen\n\nand he disappeared into the mashed-potato mixer. He said they\n\nresearched the employee records of the hotel and found that a\n\nweek after it had closed, the roast beef chef, who had been\n\nthere for fifteen years or something, went to a bar around the\n\ncorner and drank himself to death. His presence is still around.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you believe that story?\n\nAYKROYD: It's a perfect example of a ghost story I can place credence in\n\nbecause it was unsolicited. Now that the Chinese consulate is\n\nthere, I've wanted to talk to someone in charge and ask if there\n\nhave been any experiences with the presence.\n\nPLAYBOY: Have you ever had a personal experience with a presence?\n\nAYKROYD: My wife and I bought Mama Cass' old house in Hollywood. It is\n\nwhere Cream, John Lennon and Harry Nillson used to hang out.\n\nRingo owned it for a while. California Dreamin' was rehearsed\n\nthere. We have a presence in that house. A psychic came in and\n\ntold us that some guy apparently died of a drug overdose in the\n\nliving room. My wife and I told a friend of ours about it and he\n\nturned ashen and gasped. He said, \"I know about that.\" It\n\nhappened just as the psychic said. It was something that had\n\nbeen hushed up.\n\nPLAYBOY: You called a psychic?\n\nAYKROYD: We had to. The maid wouldn't go upstairs. Also, my mother\n\nexperienced some stuff' there and some friends heard the piano\n\nplaying and then heard footsteps and doors closing. When the\n\npsychic said she couldn't deal with it, my wife went to more\n\ntraditional methods -- religion -- to try to get rid of it. But\n\nwe think it's still there because recently the other maid went\n\nupstairs and a door slammed. Another time I was alone in the\n\nhouse in bed and I felt the mattress depress behind me like\n\nsomething was getting into bed. You know what my reaction was? I\n\ndidn't hop up. I wiggled my rump right up next to it. I thought,\n\nIf you can like me this much, you're going to feel me right\n\nnext to you.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did you believe in ghosts as a child?\n\nAYKROYD: Of course. They had seances at the old family farm where I grew\n\nup. My mother witnessed an apparition. I once saw some lights I\n\ncouldn't explain. My father was a psychic researcher, so it was\n\nreally passed down to me.\n\nPLAYBOY: It seems Ghostbusters is your idea of a documentary, not\n\nfiction. Are you pulling our leg?\n\nAYKROYD: Definitely not. The other day I read that Harold Ramis, my\n\ncolleague in Ghostbusters, said he doesn't believe in ghosts!\n\nPLAYBOY: And that surprises you?\n\nAYKROYD: Yes, because he is a very smart person. I'm going to bring him\n\nup to Dudley Town, Massachusetts and scare the shit out of him\n\nsometime. I'll take him to the most haunted place on earth.\n\nHe's my man. He's going. I can't believe he offhandedly says he\n\ndoesn't believe in ghosts when it's a reality of life on this\n\nplanet. He's going to get spanked for that.\n\nPLAYBOY: Don't you require more proof of ghosts than those vague\n\nexperiences?\n\nAYKROYD: Sure. I'm a skeptic. If somebody tells me a ghost story, I want\n\nproof. I want to know if he or she was smoking or drinking. In\n\neighty percent of the cases I've inquired about, you can put a\n\nname to the presence, a human name. You know why they're there.\n\nPLAYBOY: Why are they there?\n\nAYKROYD: They died in an unfulfilling and unsatisfied way and they are\n\nlingering here in this world for something that they'll never\n\nhave. And it's very simple. Very simple.\n\nPLAYBOY: Frankly, Ramis' view isn't much of a surprise to us.\n\nAYKROYD: But Harold's such a brilliant philosopher. He knows that the\n\nempirical scientific world is not all there is. Maybe that's all\n\nhe sees. I just can't believe that he means it. He's such a\n\npractical man, I suppose.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did your experiences with ghosts inspire Ghostbusters?\n\nAYKROYD: Sure, and old ghost movies. Bob Hope, the Bowery Boys, the Marx\n\nBrothers all did ghost routines. Ghosts were a big part of humor\n\nin the Thirties and Forties. Ghostbusters grew out of those as\n\nwell as my commitment to and ongoing support of the American\n\nSociety for Psychic Research.\n\nPLAYBOY: Have you ever not believed?\n\nAYKROYD: No. There is just too much literature, too much research being\n\ndone, too much evidence.\n\nPLAYBOY: You have no doubts?\n\nAYKROYD: None.\n\nPLAYBOY: Are you ever nervous talking about it in public?\n\nAYKROYD: Not really. Because I got all this legitimization from my\n\nparents on it. It's a fascinating area of study.\n\nPLAYBOY: Has there ever been an advisor to you -- a publicist or manager\n\n-- who said, \"Listen Dan, this is not the kind of stuff you want\n\nto talk about\"?\n\nAYKROYD: No, not really. Ghosts are part of the general lexicon. Most\n\npeople know they exist.\n\nPLAYBOY: What is the closest thing to a real Ghostbuster today?\n\nAYKROYD: There are paranormal scientists who work in the field of'\n\ntelepathy and ESP. There are people who have equipment to detect\n\nghosts.\n\nPLAYBOY: What type of equipment?\n\nAYKROYD: Highly sensitive photo equipment and sound equipment that can\n\ndetect presences. A guy I know says that he gets seventy-five\n\npercent of his referrals from religious people.\n\nPLAYBOY: Don't priests feel that it's heresy to mess with those forces?\n\nAYKROYD: But a parish family might have a problem with their house. The\n\npriest goes over and gives a blessing, spreads around some salt,\n\nlights a candle. That doesn't work and ultimately....\n\nPLAYBOY: Who you gonna call?\n\nAYKROYD: Right. The priest refers it to a professional.\n\nPLAYBOY: How about UFOs?\n\nAYKROYD: There is no question about UFOs. There are photos, videos,\n\nrecordings. The military knows about them.\n\nPLAYBOY: Have you seen UFOs?\n\nAYKROYD: I've had two vivid experiences. One time the lights were green\n\nS-shaped cubes, like two S's following each other, like two\n\nlittle sea horses. They were at the top of the stairs in the old\n\nfarmhouse in Canada. I was with a friend. We both saw them.\n\nPLAYBOY: Were you straight?\n\nAYKROYD: We were probably not straight, which immediately discounts me by\n\nmy own rules, but I know what I saw. My mother saw an apparition\n\nthere once; that's what led to the seances they had at our\n\nhouse. I saw the other UFO on Martha's Vineyard at my hilltop\n\nestate 272 feet above the ocean. It was about three in the\n\nmorning. I went outside to take a leak off the balcony and I saw\n\nit coming from the far upper-right-hand corner of my vision: two\n\nobjects, around 150,000 feet high. They were perfect circles\n\nflying in tandem. They did a beautiful zigzag. I screamed at my\n\nwife and my friend's girlfriend to come out. They did and the\n\nthree of us saw these objects do a beautiful zigzag, and pow!\n\nGone across the sky.\n\nPLAYBOY: The problem with all the anecdotal evidence you have is that\n\nanecdotal evidence can prove anything. There can be all kinds\n\nof explanations for lights in the sky.\n\nAYKROYD: Forget anecdotes. We're talking about ghosts, UFOs. There's\n\nphysical, recorded evidence. This woman in Massachusetts, every\n\ntime she picks up a camera and takes a picture, ethereal images\n\nappear. She shot some super-H film that was silent and then\n\nplayed it backward and there were ethereal voices on it. It made\n\nmy hair stand right up on end when I heard it. UFOs? There's a\n\nfamous photo that people have proved is not a hoax.\n\nPLAYBOY: What will you tell your daughter when she asks about ghosts?\n\nAYKROYD: I have to be straight with her. She hasn't brought it up, but\n\nwhen she asks me, I'm going to have to say that some places have\n\nghosts and sometimes souls linger after life. The way to treat\n\nthem is to talk to them sharply and not let them interfere with\n\nyour existence.\n\nPLAYBOY: How has being a father affected you?\n\nAYKROYD: It has been a surprise just how much love you can feel and how\n\nmuch love you get back.\n\nPLAYBOY: What's it like playing to a three-year-old? Does she have a good\n\nsense of humor?\n\nAYKROYD: A great sense of humor. It's all sort of absurd -- mentioning\n\nwords that shouldn't be said. My only complaint is that we\n\nwaited so long to have her. We waited seven years, so we missed\n\nseven years of enjoying her. I encourage people to have kids\n\nearly. I'm forty now, and when my daughter's twenty I'll be\n\napproaching sixty.\n\nPLAYBOY: Could you have appreciated being a father in the same way ten\n\nyears ago?\n\nAYKROYD: A few months ago, Warren Beatty said something to me: \"God is\n\nvery merciful because he doesn't let you know what it's like to\n\nhave children until you have them. And if you knew that feeling\n\nbefore you had children you'd just yearn and want them so bad.\"\n\nThat veil you walk through when you have a child is something\n\nanyone could live with at any point in life.\n\nPLAYBOY: It's hard to believe that Warren Beatty has become a source for\n\nparenting wisdom.\n\nAYKROYD: I know. But of course he's just flipped out over his little\n\ngirl.\n\nPLAYBOY: You've worked with your wife, Donna Dixon, on several films. Is\n\nit difficult mixing work and marriage?\n\nAYKROYD: Oh, no. It is a lot of fun. She's an extremely capable and funny\n\ncomedienne. There have been no problems. I'd do it again any\n\ntime. But now she's given up the business. She wants to be a\n\nfull-time mother and has made that commitment. It may be\n\ntemporary. She may go back to acting and she also has a\n\ntremendous sense of interior design. She's decorated the house\n\nin California, the two houses in Canada and the house on\n\nMartha's Vineyard.\n\nPLAYBOY: Why do you own so many houses?\n\nAYKROYD: We seldom use the Martha's Vineyard house anymore, but I've had\n\nit for a long time. We're in Los Angeles when we need to be and\n\nwe go to the family house in Canada whenever we can. There are\n\ntwo houses on the property. Ours and one our friends stay in.\n\nThe property is about seventy acres with two thousand feet of\n\nwaterfront on a lake twenty-two miles long and three hundred\n\nfeet deep in some spots, they say. It's really beautiful. We\n\njet ski out to our island fifteen minutes down the lake and set\n\nup camp there. I'm really fortunate I have a place to go. The\n\nworld is sort of closing in around me. They strung a set of\n\nhigh-tension power lines across the farm next to ours, sort of\n\nvisual pollution if you're looking certain ways. The highway is\n\ngetting busier now and the city we live near is growing. But\n\nthen there are those magic nights after nine o'clock when you\n\ndon't hear any traffic and there's just the black sky and the\n\nloons on the lake.\n\nPLAYBOY: Have you ever thought of chain-sawing the towers carrying the\n\npower lines?\n\nAYKROYD: I wouldn't use a chain saw. I'd use muriatic acid and let the\n\nsolvent eat away at their bases over a long period of time and\n\nbring them all down at once. But I actually don't have to worry\n\ntoo much about it because a big windstorm tore down about three\n\nof those towers. They'll rebuild them, of course, but I've\n\ntried to rationalize the fact that the wires are there because\n\nmany UFO reports say that power lines attract UFOs.\n\nPLAYBOY: What's your off-camera life like these days?\n\nAYKROYD: I'm basically a recluse. I never go out anymore. I had all that\n\nin the old days. After the Saturday Night Live shows, we went to\n\nthe Blues Bar, a place I opened down at Dominick and Hudson. It\n\nwas a private bar. We put armor on the window so we couldn't see\n\noutside and just had wonderful nights. We would invite everybody\n\nfrom the show and stay up till Sunday morning. So I've seen the\n\nnightlife. Increasingly, it has just made me want to withdraw.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is it simply a matter of getting older?\n\nAYKROYD: I suppose it's that by nine-thirty at night, I'm beat. These\n\nwords are coming from the master night host of all time. I would\n\nbe standing at the door at three A.M. at the Blues Bar ready to\n\ninvite anybody in, to crank a song on the jukebox and serve\n\nanother beer.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is there any danger that by going to bed early you lose touch\n\nwith the scene that inspired much of your work?\n\nAYKROYD: I don't think so, not considering what I'm doing now. In fact,\n\nI've got to conserve my energy. To do these films, I get up at\n\nsix in the morning. We work more than twelve hours a day. That's\n\nnot to say that I never burn the midnight oil. I still like to\n\nsee the dawn. About once a month I stay up all night and, the\n\nnext day, I swear I'll never drink red wine again. I have had\n\nsome spectacular campfires this summer up at the old family farm\n\nin Canada. We go out into one of the fields with the trucks,\n\nlight a big bonfire, look at the shooting stars and let the cool\n\nnip of a Canadian August night roll over us. I can stay up until\n\ndawn doing that. Those late nights in the country are nectar,\n\nabsolute nectar. We try to get up there as much as we can, and\n\nI make sure that many nights' and many days' silences are broken\n\nby the sound of whining, whistling Harleys. I have two up there\n\nand bikes are always welcome. I love to hear the sound of a\n\nHarley coming down the drive.\n\nPLAYBOY: That's an interesting mixture of sensibilities. What is it about\n\nHarleys that so intrigues you?\n\nAYKROYD: I think every red-blooded North American boy at some point\n\npurchases or is given an automobile or bike that means\n\neverything. That's why I love old cars. You climb into an old\n\ncar and it smells musty, like an old barn. It smells like your\n\ngrandfather's car. To me, that's texture. These are all the\n\nthings I worked so hard to enjoy. They're very simple. I love\n\ncold-weather riding. Being on a backcountry highway on a summer\n\nnight with the mist rolling off the fields, smelling everything\n\nfrom the thickness of manure on the land to the evening mist,\n\ndriving through a little town like Poland, New York, where\n\neverybody has the American flag up on the white washed front\n\nporch and kids are out on their bicycles. You roll through town\n\nat fifteen miles an hour and take in everything. What more could\n\nyou ask for?\n\nPLAYBOY: What more could you ask for?\n\nAYKROYD: John Candy and I were recently marveling at how fortunate we've\n\nbeen. When I met him, in 1971, he was selling Kleenex and I was\n\na mailman. And now we star in feature films together, work in\n\nthese great enterprises.\n\nPLAYBOY: What movie is next?\n\nAYKROYD: I'm not sure. They're talking about My Girl 2, which I may\n\nbecome involved with. Jimmy Belushi and I are talking about\n\ndoing a Chicago police story. I'm writing a couple of things.\n\nPLAYBOY: Are you interested in doing more dramas or do you plan to stick\n\nto comedies?\n\nAYKROYD: For a while all the movies -- Doctor Detroit, Neighbors,\n\nGhostbusters, Blues Brothers -- were comedies. I was expected to\n\nget out there and be radical and produce laughs. I don't have an\n\nobsession with it, but my tastes are broader than that. That's\n\nwhy Driving Miss Daisy meant so much. Now I could see writing\n\nsomething historical or serious.\n\nPLAYBOY: Does the work get easier?\n\nAYKROYD: In some ways. But a working film actor works hard. The first\n\nthing that's hard is getting up early in the morning. The second\n\nthing that's hard is waiting. You work when they're ready, not\n\nwhen you're ready. The toughest part is when the camera's\n\nrolling, that one or two minutes of compressed time. You are\n\nconcentrating, distilling your character. You have to do that\n\nover and over every day. You have to shut out everything else.\n\nIt's like being a diamond cutter. When he looks up from his\n\nwork, there's the clock on the wall, other instruments, other\n\nstaff, customers, the money being counted. When he goes to cut\n\nhis diamond he has to slice that facet. If he doesn't hit it\n\nclean, that's it. The after activities are also hard: taking\n\ncriticism, putting it out there and having people hate it.\n\nPLAYBOY: How much do reviewers affect what you do?\n\nAYKROYD: Sometimes the reviewers love you, sometimes they hate you, but\n\nmostly they are mixed.\n\nPLAYBOY: You really got knocked for your directorial debut, Nothing but\n\nTrouble. What went wrong?\n\nAYKROYD: It was a good little story, but the studio didn't know what to\n\ndo with it. They changed the title at the last minute --\n\noriginally it was Valkenvania. It was kind of dark and they\n\ndidn't know how to sell it. On top of that, we opened when the\n\nPersian Gulf war was going on, Silence of the Lambs opened and\n\nJulia Roberts' Sleeping with the Enemy had its second weekend.\n\nWe were doomed. The studio backed away from it.\n\nPLAYBOY: Because test audiences didn't like it?\n\nAYKROYD: Right. It wasn't what they thought it would be. But sometimes\n\nfilms test bad and they go out and do business. The reviews\n\nweren't all bad for that movie. The Toronto Star thought it was\n\nfunny.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did you enjoy directing?\n\nAYKROYD: A lot. But that movie set me back ten years. Nobody's going to\n\nhand me the reins.\n\nPLAYBOY: Even after all your other successes?\n\nAYKROYD: Well, they may, but it will take some convincing. Nothing but\n\nTrouble came out when I was filming My Girl, and I remember\n\nknowing within about two days that it was all over. The way it\n\nworks now is that the people are the critics. They are the ones\n\nwho matter. The business is built on research and audience\n\nresponse cards, not reviewers.\n\nPLAYBOY: Doesn't so much reliance on feedback from audiences take a lot\n\nof the creativity out of the business?\n\nAYKROYD: Well, I still write movies for one person, and that's me. I'll\n\nfight to put in some obscure technical reference that maybe\n\ntwenty people out of the millions will understand. But it's also\n\ngood to take into consideration the responses of the people,\n\nbecause that's who we're making these movies for.\n\nPLAYBOY: You once said you wished you had the money, not the fame. Is\n\nthat still true?\n\nAYKROYD: I wish that today. The fame is worthless. It doesn't have\n\nanything to do with the quality of my work. I could happily\n\ndispense with it. I would much rather be paid for what I do and\n\nnot have to go home with it at night. But what am I going to do?\n\nMoan and cry and bitch about it? I'm the only person on the\n\nplanet who's been a Ghostbuster, a Conehead and a Blues Brother.\n\nI've had a recording career, a TV career, I won an Emmy and was\n\nnominated for a Grammy and an Oscar. I had a number-one record,\n\na number-one TV show and a number-one movie. With cable and\n\nreruns I'm going to be on the dial for the rest of my life.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did turning forty last year mean anything for you?\n\nAYKROYD: Age never really bothered me. Forty is just a number. Somebody\n\naccused me of having my adolescence arrested at fifteen. It\n\ncould be true. I am forty with a cone on my head.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you have any sense of what people think about you?\n\nAYKROYD: I think people perceive that whatever I do is going to be\n\ndifferent from what I did last. I'm perceived in the comedy\n\nsphere mostly. I think there's curiosity about what I'm doing,\n\nlike, \"What's he going to try to pull?\" or, more likely, \"What's\n\nthat maniac up to this time?\"\n\nPLAYBOY: Can that be a burden?\n\nAYKROYD: Not really. I mean, I don't always have to be funny. I just like\n\nto find out what people are thinking, I like to talk with them.\n\nI'm just thankful that I'm not treated like one of the more\n\ncontroversial figures in history. When Robert McNamara was going\n\nto his home on Martha's Vineyard, a Vietnam vet tried to throw\n\nhim off the ferry. I'm sure Henry Kissinger takes abuse. Jane\n\nFonda gets it from the vets. All I have behind me is, \"That\n\nmaniac made me laugh once or twice.\""
