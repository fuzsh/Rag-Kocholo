        "text": "Three Men and a Comic Book\n\nBart attends a comic book convention and decides he wants to buy the first issue of âRadioactive Manâ comics for $100. He tries and fails to earn the money in various ways, including helping elderly neighbor Mrs. Glick, who works him like a horse then gives him a quarter. So, Bart decides to go in with Milhouse and Martin, both of whom want the comic, though neither has enough money. They soon find that joint ownership is more difficult than it seems, as none of the three wants to let the comic out of his sight. Bart goes temporarily insane, tying up Martin and fighting with Milhouse, until the comic is blown into a driving rainstorm and destroyed, leaving the three boys to ponder the evil of greed."
