Truman,\" 28 February 1946\n\nDescription\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Ho Chi Minh reached out to President Harry S. Truman for support in ending French rule in Vietnam. In the document, Ho Chi Minh references both the Atlantic and San Francisco charters as a basis for his claims. The Atlantic Charter was drawn up in 1941 following the outbreak of World War II by the U.S. and England and the San Francisco Charter references the document that creates the United Nations (UN Charter). In both documents, the United States lends their support for support self-government by occupied peoples during World War II.\n\nTranscript of Ho Chi Minh's Letter to U.S. President Harry Truman\n\nSource-Dependent Questions\n\nWhat was Ho Chi Minh asking President Truman for in the telegram?\n\nHow does his request align with stated U.S. policy? Why would his request not be met considering the characterization of Ho Chi Minh by Operations Officer Archimedes Patti?\n\nCitation Information"
