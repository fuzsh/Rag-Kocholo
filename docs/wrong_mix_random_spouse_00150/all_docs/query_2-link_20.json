        "text": "Cryptic Paisley\n\nBy Chester Henry,\n\nFrom Christopher's 3 favorite reads in 2023.\n\nBy Christopher Church Author\n\nWhy did Christopher love this book?\n\nI found the detective at the center of the story, Truman, to be refreshing in his naivete, despite being set in the grimy big city of Los Angeles. Just because he’s not hardboiled doesn’t mean he’s stupid, however, and I had to laugh as Truman cluelessly digs himself into a mystery in the city’s fashion industry.\n\nHis pal Celeste is more street-smart, and the ups and downs of her rocky relationships with men are all too familiar. The pair of them work together to take down a cryptocurrency scam, exacting a most satisfying revenge on the mastermind of it all.\n\nThe tone of the book is light, and it makes a compelling read.\n\nBy Chester Henry,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Cryptic Paisley as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen gallerist Celeste meets an old friend at an art show, the artist explains that someone has jacked one of her fashion designs, and soon Celeste’s bestie, Truman, is on the case, diving headlong into LA’s fashion industry to investigate. Truman and Celeste soon get entangled with a hinky company run by a trio of enigmatic lowlifes who produce a very unusual fashion line. Are they full-on grifters, or just not that competent? Truman goes undercover with an industry supplier, and Celeste agrees to work for the trashy fashion folks, digging deeper into their secrets and getting way too close…\n\nPreview\n\nTruman\n\nBy David McCullough,\n\nFrom my list on preparing for writing/walking/thinking/acting against the crowd.\n\nBy Lin Wilder Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m a writer who just published a book I didn’t have any interest in writing. I didn’t like the subject matter, so I had no interest in doing the research to create credible characters and a cohesive plot.\n\nLin's book list on preparing for writing/walking/thinking/acting against the crowd\n\nWhy did Lin love this book?\n\nI didn’t have the time or energy for this tome of a book on Harry Truman. Hence, I'd never have read it had it not been ‘assigned’ by the book club I was in.\n\nBut I was mesmerized from the first pages. And felt connected to this unobtrusive, somewhat unattractive man who was in every way ordinary. But who became the president during the last days of World War ll. A man who thought and spoke clearly. A man who seemed to personify the virtues without calling them that.\n\nI learned a great deal from this book.\n\nBy David McCullough,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Truman as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Harry S. Truman, whose presidency included momentous events from the atomic bombing of Japan to the outbreak of the Cold War and the Korean War, told by America's beloved and distinguished historian.\n\nThe life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters-Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson-and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man-a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined-but also the turbulent times in which…\n\nPreview\n\nChiseler with a Glass Jaw\n\nBy Chester Henry,\n\nFrom my list on LA detectives with complex emotional lives.\n\nBy Christopher Church Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a longtime Angeleno, I’ve read a lot about the dark underbelly of our dysfunctional metropolis, both in the news and in fiction. I try to incorporate the City of Angels as a strong presence in my writing, and when I read other writers who have put Los Angeles at the center, it gives me a sense of things the way they really are, a glimpse at a deeper reality. I see the detectives in LA noir and crime fiction as inextricably intertwined with the city, their weaknesses, and their emotional quandaries emerging from this place.\n\nChristopher's book list on LA detectives with complex emotional lives\n\nWhy did Christopher love this book?\n\nI found this mystery unusual because there are two protagonists, the fledgling detective Truman and his reluctant friend Celeste. I grew up with a canny mother and sisters, and seeing Celeste tacitly guide Truman in his new career, using her broader understanding of the world, feels familiar. The pair confront a blackmailing bully and try to shut down his operation. Their hedonistic approach to life, even in the most intense moments, is lighthearted and fun, and any woman who’s had a gay best friend or vice versa will recognize the humor in the pair of them chasing the same guys.\n\nBy Chester Henry,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Chiseler with a Glass Jaw as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNever one to let a bully get away with harassing someone, Celeste intervenes with a knockout punch, and in the melee Truman winds up in possession of the bully’s cell phone. Through Truman’s inventive online stalking and Celeste tracking down the victim, they uncover a seedy nest of grifters bent on profiting from human misery. Truman gets involved with Isaac, a closeted lawyer with a quick temper, but how does he fit into the scam? Running down leads at hotel bars, hip boutiques, and a grimy body shop, Truman and Celeste go all in, posing undercover at a night club…\n\nPreview\n\nHow to Be a Normal Person\n\nBy TJ Klune,\n\nFrom my list on positive asexual representation.\n\nBy Kieran Frank Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI'm Kieran Frank, author of sexless romances. I write books with asexual characters because they're underrepresented. I write them with positive representation to avoid harmful stereotypes, and I highlight the nuances of a-spec people without sounding too preachy. I don't claim to be an expert in asexuality, but I'm passionate about writing asexual themes because it's what I want to see more of in fiction. Men are often expected to enjoy sex, especially at a younger age. I can personally relate to the harmful pressure, which is another reason I write asexual books. It can help combat toxic views that societies have instilled in many people.\n\nKieran's book list on positive asexual representation\n\nWhy did Kieran love this book?\n\nThere are times when books with asexual characters need some humor and lightheartedness for a wholesome mix. Not all ace books need to be sad or angsty. Not all ace books even need to be about sexuality itself. Asexual characters simply need to exist in more books with positive representation, and said books can help teach people that sexless romances are just as valid and meaningful.\n\nBy TJ Klune,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked How to Be a Normal Person as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA How to Be Novel Gustavo Tiberius is not normal. He knows this. Everyone in his small town of Abby, Oregon, knows this. He reads encyclopedias every night before bed. He has a pet ferret called Harry S. Truman. He owns a video rental store that no one goes to. His closest friends are a lady named Lottie with drag queen hair and a trio of elderly Vespa riders known as the We Three Queens. Gus is not normal. And he's fine with that. All he wants is to be left alone. Until Casey, an asexual stoner hipster and the…\n\nPreview\n\nRevolt of the Admirals\n\nBy Jeffrey G. Barlow,\n\nFrom my list on U.S. Naval history.\n\nBy Marc Liebman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a retired Navy Captain and Naval Aviator, who spent 26 years in the Navy, am an aviation historian and the author of 11 novels, five of which have become Amazon #1 Best Sellers. All my books have naval themes and are operationally and historically accurate.\n\nMarc's book list on U.S. Naval history\n\nWhy did Marc love this book?\n\nWorld War II is over. The U.S. is demobilizing and in 1948, the United States Air Force becomes a separate service. President Harry Truman appoints Louis Johnson as the new Secretary of Defense in 1949 after James Forrestal resigned because he would not carry out Truman’s defense cuts. Johnson accepted the Air Force’s proposal that nuclear deterrence was the sole responsibility of the Air Force and all military aviation should be under its command. This set in motion a series of events known as the “Revolt of the Admirals” which Barlow used as the title of his book.\n\nThis is a story of professional courage. A group of admirals was willing to put their careers on the line to force the Truman administration to change its policies and decisions. They fought with the Secretary of Defense Johnson as well as other officials in the administration and based their arguments on…\n\nBy Jeffrey G. Barlow,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Revolt of the Admirals as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nChronicles in compelling detail the historic showdown between the U.S. Air Force and the Navy over the role of carrier aviation in the national security framework of the United States.\n\nThe National Security Act of 1947, intended to unify the separate armed services under a single Defense Secretary, failed to settle the deeper issue that divided them, the debate over roles and missions. One symptom of this conflict was a showdown between the Air Force and the Navy over the role of carrier aviation in the national security framework of the United States.\n\nFrom the early days of aviation, Army…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Opinion Makers\n\nBy David W. Moore,\n\nFrom my list on understanding consumers and your consumer self.\n\nBy Philip Graves Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nHaving studied statistics in the 1980s and realised that forecasting energy reserves wasn’t for me, I stumbled into a career in market research. A chance reading of a book on psychoanalysis opened my eyes to how little we all understand ourselves and I started to look for better ways to identify how consumers think. After developing techniques from psychoanalysis and behavioural science I started my own consultancy firm in 2005. Over the last seventeen years I’ve been lucky enough to advise some of the world’s biggest brands, make regular appearances in the media discussing consumer affairs and, with my book Consumer.ology, to upset some of the biggest market research companies.\n\nPhilip's book list on understanding consumers and your consumer self\n\nWhy did Philip love this book?\n\nEarly in my career I was responsible for running the UK brand tracking and customer experience studies of a global brand. I was constantly battling to reconcile what the research told me with what the real data from the business showed was actually going on. This book, written by someone who was a senior editor at the Gallup market research company for years, helped me appreciate some of the reasons that survey results are inaccurate. It also reveals how opinion polls can be used to distort elections and manipulate people – scary stuff.\n\nBy David W. Moore,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Opinion Makers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWith a new afterword by the author\n\nDrawing on over a decade's experience at the Gallup Poll and a distinguished academic career in survey research, David W. Moore—praised as a \"scholarly crusader\" by the New York Times—reveals that pollsters don't report public opinion, they manufacture it. In this highly critical book, he describes the questionable tactics pollsters use to create poll-driven news stories-including force-feeding respondents, slanting the wording of questions, and ignoring public ignorance on even the most arcane issues. More than proof that the numbers do lie, The Opinion Makers clearly and convincingly spells out how urgent it is…\n\nPreview\n\nA Safe Haven\n\nBy Allis Radosh, Ronald Radosh,\n\nWhy did Jeffrey love this book?\n\nRadosh and Radosh offer a compelling and dramatic history of Truman’s decision to support Jewish emigration to Palestine in 1947, and to recognize the state of Israel in 1948. They examine Truman’s dilemmas as he made the recognition decision against the advice of the leaders of his own State Department, including his own Secretary of State George Marshall. A Safe Haven offers a careful and essential guide to American politics regarding the Zionist issue, and to the combination of political and religious arguments that were decisive in Truman’s decision making.\n\nBy Allis Radosh, Ronald Radosh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Safe Haven as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“[This] revelatory account of Truman's vital contributions to Israel's founding. . .is told. . . with an elegance informed by thorough research.\"\n\n—Wall Street Journal\n\n\"Even knowing how the story ends, A Safe Haven had me sitting on the edge of my seat.”\n\n—Cokie Roberts\n\nA dramatic, detailed account of the events leading up to the creation of a Jewish homeland and the true story behind President Harry S. Truman’s controversial decision to recognize of the State of Israel in 1948, drawn from Truman’s long-lost diary entries and other previously unused archival materials.\n\nPreview"
