        "text": "Crime writer Margaret Truman knew Washington, D.C. like the back of her hand. After all, she grew up there: Her father Harry S. Truman was elected to the United States Senate from Missouri in 1934, when she was just 10 years old. Margaret split her time and education between Washington, D.C. and Missouri, eventually graduating from D.C.'s George Washington University. Shortly after, her father moved to a famous nearby address: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Harry Truman served first as Vice President and then as President of the United States, occupying the Oval Office from 1945-1953.\n\nThe White House would later play a major role in Margaret Truman's first crime novel. But first, Margaret Truman tried her hand at other careers. She gave concerts as a coloratura soprano in symphony halls across the country, recorded with the label RCA Victor, and appeared on television. Later, she worked as a journalist and as a radio personality. Finally, Truman settled on the writing career that would see her produce her most lasting work.\n\nTruman wrote both fiction and nonfiction, and she wrote a lot. Her body of work is impressive, and diving in can be intimidating. Fortunately, we’ve done some investigating of our own to bring you the very best recommendations. Here are 11 gripping Margaret Truman books, tackling everything from her father’s time in the White House to addictive murder mysteries set in the nation’s capital."
