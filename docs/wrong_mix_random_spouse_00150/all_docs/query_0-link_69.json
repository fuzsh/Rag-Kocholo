        "text": "WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2020….. EARTH DAY…..!!!!!\n\nDEAR READERS….. The simple answer to the above question is…..”I’m staying well, healthy and hopeful in, probably one of the safest places to be right now… Key West…. during this very challenging time in our life!!!”….. Ah!!!! ‘Our Life’….. It has totally changed…..in the not too distant past, life for us used to be non stop go- go- go..morning noon and night…. often triple booked…. There were times I would think to myself…’Wouldn’t it be nice to have a couple weeks to just veg?’ ‘They’ say…. Be careful what you wish for! We have now been sequestered for some 36 days…..At first it was a novelty…. After a week of social distancing, we were all laughing about our initial personal reactions, seeing hilarious videos and messages that we could all enjoy and relate to while we were altering our lives. Must say, these bits of hilarity, inspiration, information, and entertainment are still very welcome…. but I am yearning for the warmth and caring… the connection with of our friends and Key West Family…. Will we ever be able to hug and smooch again? And I LOVE Group Hugs so much!!!\n\nQUESTIONS OUT THERE…NO ANSWERS…..Before….I would say, “if only we knew who was immune…and then if we were also immune, we could connect with “like persons”…. but the more I read and listen, I realize there are so many unanswered questions in all of this…. How many people have truly been infected? I read that many more are than we actually know about. As we speak, I may have it and not know….and there is a huge lack of adequate testing….and the testing they have is fair at best. We are told we can get a test anytime and anywhere, but we all KNOW that is a big bold lie. One has to be half dead with multiple symptoms before a test will be administered. So… we do not know how deadly it is….why it impacts one person and not another…we don’t really know how it actually spreads, how long it ‘lives’ in the air or on surfaces… how long it lives in one’s body….don’t know if a person can get reinfected after you get it?…. the list of questions is huge and so many answers are so feeble and not believable. I read where Taiwan, S. Korea, Iceland and Germany are so far ahead of us in combating this virus…. and it makes me wonder why we were not on top of things as these much smaller countries are… and can’t we learn from them, and do what they are doing? Again… no answers…..So we stay inside and distanced from everyone and everything…..and thank goodness we have that luxury when SO many people do not. Needless to say, it is all very complicated and we must be patient even when we are starting to lose patience. We want our tests to work…. not to tell us we are okay and immune and then find out the test was a sham…. and many of those tests are just that! I still rely on Gov. Andrew Cuomo for all information that I believe is truthful… also Dr. Tony Fauci… ( though have not seen him around lately!!!! )\n\nTODAY IS EARTH DAY ….THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY! LET US REFLECT ON WHAT EARTH DAY MEANS TO US…..LET US THANK THE LORD THAT WE ARE HERE IN KEY WEST…. RELATIVELY SAFE AT THIS TIME…. SURROUNDED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE OCEAN, THE SKY, THE WEATHER AND EACH OTHER WHO WE KNOW ARE THERE … EVEN THOUGH WE CAN’T BE TOGETHER AT THIS TIME!!!! WE ARE SHARING THIS MOMENT RIGHT THIS SECOND….AND I SAY….”LOVE AND HAPPY EARTH DAY.”\n\nAPPROPRIATE SONGS DURING THIS TIME…. I was sent more songs that are appropriate during this time….. They are LOOK TO THE SILVER LINING (thanks Libby)….. BLUE SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP…… IMAGINE…. HERE COMES THE SUN ….. BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER …. OVER THE RAINBOW…. COMING OUT OF THE RAIN….add those to I WILL SURVIVE …..ALWAYS LOOK TO THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE….. THE SUN WILL COME UP TOMORROW…. DON’T WORRY, BE HAPPY….. SMILE……LET A SMILE BE YOUR UMBRELLA…. PUT ON A HAPPY FACE…. Find comfort in the lyrics…..and know you are loved and there is HOPE!!!! You can hear most or all of those songs online!!!!!\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTWO WEEKS OF THINGS HAPPENING, NOT HAPPENING, THOUGHTS, SHARINGS, ETC……….\n\nAPRIL 22 thru MAY 5, ETC….. 2020, IN KEY WEST WITH LYNDA!!!\n\nHAPPY EARTH DAY APRIL 22 BIRTHDAY TO…..PHILLIP DECKER …. CAROLINE TAYLOR … JACK AGNEW …DAVID SNOWBALL … ROSEMARY STOUT …. JEFF CHESSON … (Please remember Jacob Gelt Dekker …..and Ted Watson….) HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO …. KRISTEN AND JIM RYAN…. MARLENE & DEAN DI BRITO….. (Please remember Orchid & Earl Duncan.)\n\nHAPPY APRIL 29 BIRTHDAY TO….TOMMY RYAN….SCOTT FUHRIMAN….. MATT HOLLIS HULSEY …. DIANA DAVIS …. ADAM SWEITZER …. SARAH GOODWIN …. DANIEL GENICA …. JON STEIN … SEAN BREAUX…. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO….. KATHY AND RICK ELIAS.\n\n**SOUP KITCHEN NEEDS VOLUNTEERS!!! ….. My friend, Barbara Vernovage, makes things happen! She informed me that the SOS Soup Mission needs lots of help. Volunteers are needed. Yesterday over 800 were fed. To find out more information and to volunteer, email,lisa@sosmission.org….give name, email, and cell # and tell her that you want to help…You can do it online at the following site: https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NDcyNDc= …. Or go to www.stmarykeywest.com and go to SOS Foundation.\n\n**TERRI WHITE & LARRY BAEDER TONIGHT AT 8 PM ON FACEBOOK…..At 8 pm tonight, beloved Key West Broadway Baby, TERRI WHITE and cool guitarist, LARRY BAEDER will be performing for your enjoyment life on Facebook!

This is a HIGH energy show of rock n roll, blues, swing tunes, and even some rockabilly sounds…..Performers are Megan Clay, Jerrod Isaman and the fabulous vocalist, Belle Jampol!!!!

Please let me know if you would like me to forward you these lists….. Simply send me a request and I will send you the Taurus Personality Description plus all those I know who are celebrating birthdays and anniversaries during this special time of year!!! Also, let me know if you want to be added to it. You NOW have plenty of time to send notes, cards, emails and texts while you play the waiting game sequestered….it is a chance to remember all those people too nice to forget!!!!\n\nKEY WEST SERVICE WORKERS NEED YOUR HELP…. This is for those with the Venmo or Square apps., but you can donate checks to Kim Glen (bice710@yahoo.com) and she will distribute to either those persons you choose directly or evenly to everyone… whatever you choose. Go to the link to see the names who need your help….\n\nhttp://docs.google.com/spreadssheets/d/1208FIBUhR_YVLgHxNlWvbFGaf619XJRIF7Y8h0o/htmlvie. (HOPE THIS WORKS… IF IT DOESN’T AND YOU WANT THE LIST, SEND ME AN EMAIL WITH A REQUEST.) If you read the names on the list and you see those you know who are humbly, asking for a bit of help, you could also send them checks directly.\n\n****ABSENTEE VOTING……FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO VOTE BY MAILING IN YOUR BALLOT…..There will be a Primary Election on August 18, 2020. And the General Election is November 3, 2020. If you will NOT be around during either of these times, please call Joyce Griffith’s office at 305-292-3416 to request absentee ballots. You do NOT want to forfeit your privilege to vote in these extremely important elections. So while you have this time…. please handle this. You can also go to the Supervisor of Elections website at http://www.keys-elections.org and click on Vote by Mail….and complete. I had a bit of a problem with this so I simply called and took care of it. Please do not listen to those who say that voting via the mail is a bad thing. Oddly, Trump said that, and yet he, himself, voted by mail recently. If it is good enough for him, it must be good enough, right?\n\nLL’S TEST KITCHEN……..Dave Talpasz sent me this info that he says is an outstanding alternative to going to the grocery store…This place also does wonderful family meals to go!

Just want you all to please keep Amy Culver, former owner of Mangoes, and one of Key West’s very popular and beloved characters….. has contracted the virus and is in strict quarantine as she battles it. She had recently returned from Mexico, but she claims, that as far as she knew, she was not exposed to anyone who had the virus…..Please keep Amy in your thoughts and prayers. I understand that she has a Facebook page where she is writing all about this.\n\nPLEASE TAKE HEED AND READ……***BIG ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE 2020 WATERFRONT PLAYHOUSE AQUA IDOL…Various options about completing the Final Two weeks of Aqua Idol were discussed and considered, including hosting a Virtual Idol….. However, because so many people in town are hurting…. are not employed, and are needing financial assistance during this crisis, we felt we would move the final two nights to November, 2020… seven months from now. We are hoping that by then, our circumstances will be greatly improved and new rules might be in effect. Our final eight singers were all in agreement that they preferred to wait when they can sing once again, in front of a live audience and they did not want to take dollars away from those who are truly struggling right now. So…. we will wait until the Fall… see what happens and then go from there. Keep optimistic that we will make this happen…..It will be something we can all look forward to!!!! In the meantime…I do NOT want you to forget the Final Eight Vocalists whom we have all come to know and love………They are…..STEPHANIE WISE…. BOB WOOD…. JON HERNANDEZ…. BRIA ANSARA…. GAYLA MORGAN…. TREY FORSYTH….. SARAH DORRANCE … AND… CHARLII CLARK! These are some of the most wonderful and talented individuals and nicest people I have EVER known… and that also includes those who started the event with us, way back ON JAN. 22…. including…. LUKE FOX.. ZACH FRANCHINI… CALEN D. TOMASZEWSKI… MIKE RIDGEWELL …..RICHARD QUINT ….PERKY SARAH PERKINS…. HERB MILLER..AND VERA GRIGOROVICH!!!!\n\nTHE IDOL PRIZE PACKAGE…..I want to thank everyone out there who has contributed to the Prize Package…. you are all so kind and generous. Even though we have postponed the Event until November, all those prizes WILL be used eventually when we have our Finale. The show WILL go on!!!! Let me know if you would like me to send you a list of all those who have donated thus far and I will send it to you. (For those who have promised items, please let me know as we are still picking up and some are dropping off.)\n\nMY CONCHTV WEBSITE..You are receiving this personally, but note that you can also read this blog in its entirety 24/7..anytime on my website with Conch TV… Just go to www.conchtv.com/author/lynda … and Voila! There I am!! Even a picture!!!! Also, you can see the TAURUS Birthday and Anniversary Lists and Personality Traits… Fun!\n\nGAYLA MORGAN PLAYING A WEEKLY HAPPY HOUR ON TUESDAYS…. SCROLL DOWN TO TUESDAY…..APRIL 28 FOR DETAILS…..\n\nONE CLEAN ISLAND FACEBOOK PAGE….Carol Tedesco has informed me that good info is being posted on this page. Check it out please. She also sent a plea to support the SOS and Sister Season Fund…..two organizations that I support and totally believe in especially during these crucial times.\n\nSUPPORT SOS………Prior to the pandemic, more than 50% of Monroe County residents were ALREADY living below the poverty line. SOS (Star of the Sea) Kitchens have long been providing food for those in need…. and that need is accelerating. If we support SOS and other important local social service funds our donations will be amplified by the org’s ability to collect, distribute and network. PLEASE Support SOS and other orgs such as Sister Season Fund with donations if you can. Go to…. https://cffk.org/non-profits/sister-season-fund-inc/ …\n\nSENDING ME INFO…. If you have something you would like me to print, let me know at least by next Tuesday. Please include ALL essential details like time, date, place, and contact info too. Try to be as concise as possible..\n\nBEFORE ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE IN OUR UNIVERSE…. This blog was overflowing with zillions of things happening every single day, morning, noon and night…. You will see that this is no longer the case. We have very few places to go…. and because we are home bound, our books, TV, computer, cell phone, and yards are our safe havens….. I will try to let everyone know what I hear…. and if you know of anything that we should know, please inform me. Also…. feel free to send me any fun or informative things you may be receiving.\n\nTHE STUDIOS KEY WEST….. The Studios will launch a new suite of workshops, exhibits and events that can be enjoyed anywhere….. The Event will take place on the Studios Facebook Page. thru a Facebook Live event from 6-7 pm on April 2….

For more info email continuingeducation@fkcc.edu or call 305-809-3185.\n\nCORE GROUP GETTING TOGETHER SHARING IDEAS AND THOUGHTS…..THANKS TO MAYOR TERI JOHNSTON… who is a Voice of Reason during this turbulent time. She is doing everything possible to keep us safe here on our Island Paradise. Please listen to her and follow her lead. I was glad to read that a core group is getting together to assess what will happen when this is ‘over’…. this is a great time to consider what Key West has been doing right and what it needs to do to make things better….Yes, we can be better than ever. We should be weary of those who have their own agenda…. it is time to put those Locals who live here high on the list to consider above all else! We love our tourists…. God knows that is how we started off in KW, as tourists….but Locals Rock!!!! There has to be a happy medium.\n\nPERSONAL OBSERVATIONS AND THOUGHTS….. Several things I have discovered since the shutdown……….1) Our Ocean has never looked cleaner and clearer! 2) Our streets are cleaner…. Our Island is cleaner…….personally, our 1,400 square feet of porches at our house no longer have that oily soot permeating every surface…. Why? No multiple massive Cruise Ships coming in spewing their nasty pollution! 3) Maybe it is time to reassess the number and the kinds of ships that would be allowed to dock here in the future…. maybe less of them and smaller more exclusive vessels… what we call ’boutique ships’…..to do less damage to our waters and reefs and our fragile Ecosystem……. focusing on Quality and not Quantity! 4) We must use this time to take stock of what things have gotten out of hand…. things we have let happen in the past that we don’t like anymore……. and how we can heal and take control our precious Island. In the meantime….go outside and enjoy the butterflies everywhere and listen to the birds singing… and at night go out and look up at the skies which seem so clear …. you can count the stars!!!!!! Enjoy the quiet evenings with no loud blaring noises, like motorcycles, boom boxes…. venues all trying to ‘out noise’ each other with loud outdoor music! Key Westers have their town back!!! I urge you to look into your hearts and explore the negatives and the positives from all of this….and what we really miss and don’t miss. Sit down with a pad and paper and jot down your thoughts and feelings! The big thing to figure out is… how do we keep the truly magical quirky charm and offbeat events we love so much and still maintain cleanliness combined with a sense of decorum!!! Let’s Accentuate the Positive and Eliminate the Negative!! Latch on to the Affirmative and…. Don’t mess with Mister In Between!!!!!\n\nSHOPPING FUTURE……Another thing is to consider the type of establishments we want on Duval St. Sadly, many will not survive this economic impact…. More than a few shops have been closed before this Pendamic….there could be many more stores out of business and boarded up. after the dust settles. Maybe it is time to consider altering rents to entice outstanding and unique stores to Key West. I have such fond memories of so many specialty stores on Duval when I started coming here in 1985….places like Nanny Miskell’s (Thanks Holly!!)…..and of course, Fast Buck Freddie’s (now much smaller, but still great, on Caroline). We have some great stores, not all on Duval, like Besame Mucho ……Vignette… Golden Pineapple…La Rubia….Grace ….In Touch….In One Era…. Duck & Dolphin…The Assortment…(Remember when it used to be three times larger on Duval and for both men and women?)….etc. but we lost so many…. And thank goodness we have some super chain stores like Coach, The Gap and Banana Republic…. let’s see if we can attract more…. Time to think long and hard about this and work together to make Key West even MORE appealing than before! I think we can be better than the nasty rip off cosmetic, T-shirt and Bong Shops and the ‘5 Dollah’ Stores. Don’t you?\n\nJANE DAWKINS FACEBOOK PAGE…… Along the lines of what I have been writing up above, I read in Tuesday’s Citizen that she has established a Page on Facebook called “RE-IMAGINING KEY WEST”that already has nearly 800 followers who are sharing thoughts and ideas….offering their perspectives… Those who have joined in the collaborating all have Key West’s best interests at heart. People are finding that the air, and environment since this Pandemic, are better for the health of everyone and everything. People have complained about a lot of things for a long time….. NOW is the time to look for workable solutions.. This is a time to share dreams an hopes and good ideas!!!!…. Congratulations to Jane…..she has a great big caring heart !\n\nKEY WEST DINING SPECIALS!!!! ALL BARS & RESTAURANTS ARE CLOSED… and ONLY OPEN FOR TAKE OUT ORDERS!

Sometimes we pray for strength to go on and to accept…sometimes we pray for thanksgiving. We are in this thing called ‘Life’ together….and we all have power within us to help our fellow man.

We had the opportunity to live in the Chicago area (actually Lake Forest, IL) from 1984 to around 1990. It was the year that the amazing MICHAEL JORDAN was drafted by the Chicago Bulls and where he became arguably, quite the most fabulous Basketball Star ever! He was right out of Wake Forest University and was the 3rd round draft choice. Everyone in Chicago Land fell madly in love with Michael. Now, ESPN is presenting a wonderful documentary called THE LAST DANCE in 8 or 10 segments every Sunday evening. The first was on April 19. If you missed the first part they are showing it off and on during the week. It is wonderful and is guaranteed to fascinate and enthrall all Jordan and sports lovers who are starved for sports entertainment. I have a Michael Jordan story that will probably not be in the documentary. When he FIRST came to Chicago he started off like gangbusters, and was Rookie of the Year….One afternoon, I was shopping at a store called I Magnin at a Mall on the Gold Coast…. As I was standing at the counter in the men’s department, I felt someone substantial standing next to me ….and heard this deep voice asking the clerk to see some Hanes underwear. I turned to my right and looked up up up and there he was Michael Jordan smiling that amazing smile that could light up the world! Even now I get goose bumps as I remember….Awestruck, I said…”Oh my God…it’s You.. Michael….” and before I could say anything more, he put a finger to his lips to shush me so I wouldn’t make a fuss…. ” And of course he signed an autograph for me! Thanks for letting me share this very special moment with you! Oh yes… by the way he bought briefs in every color!\n\nTHE FOLLOWING CANCELLED OR POSTPONED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE…\n\nBILL MELCHIOR AT AMERICAN LEGION CANCELLED…… Bill has cancelled his gig at The Legion until further notice…..\n\nTRUMAN WATERFRONT MARKET…CANCELLED FOR NOW……\n\nTAVERN N TOWN…ON HIATUS TILL FURTHER NOTICE…..\n\n(Never Fear….Carmen Rodriguez and Bobby Nesbitt will entertain once again from 5 to 9 pm in the Lounge….)\n\nBO’S FISHWAGON….ON HIATUS FOR NOW…\n\n(The Southernmost Magnolia on hiatus while BO’s is closed…..they will once again perform every Thurs from 6 to 9 pm….at Caroline & William Sts….Classic country music, Cajun, and bluegrass music with Maggie Moniz, Steve Gibson, Chuck Sherman, Kit Farovoy… unique sounds you will love!!!Guaranteed to make you have a darn good time!!!!)\n\nTHE GARDENS HOTEL…..GARDENS TAKING A BREAK FOR AWHILE….\n\nCONCH REPUBLIC SEAFOOD CO…ON HIATUS…..

(Maybe you were there!!!! Let me know if you were!!)….. On April 19, 2004, I had the honor and privilege of appearing LIVE ONSTAGE in Christopher Peterson’s EYECONS Show! How did this happen? We were at an auction for the then, Key West Symphony, and one of the live auction items was ” A Chance to Perform Live Onstage in Christopher Peterson’s Eyecons Show at LATEDA!!!! My dear husband Bob, bid on it and won…. and said… “I got this for you! (meaning me!)”…. OMG!!!! After meeting with Christopher several times, and sharing ideas, we became great friends and the whole experience was quite an adventure…one that I will always treasure… from going to his home to be try on an array of amazing gowns…. to rehearsing songs in his living room… it was a hoot!!! That night, a full house was there, including my dear Mother Queen Adele Stevens…..on April 19, 2004…. Chris made me up into quite the glamorous Drag Queen…. fabulous glittery gown, lots of golden tresses…. unbelievable makeup…. and Voila! the rest is History! I sang ‘When You’re Good To Mama’ from Chicago, and even went into the audience while singing… and then Christopher and I sang the hilarious song “Class” …. also from Chicago, as a duet…. and it was sooooo much fun!!!! Christopher performed with me as Bette Davis … and the audience cheered me on! Bob presented flowers to me onstage…. and my Mother just loved it…. When the show was over, she, proud mother that she was, said to Christopher…. ” Wasn’t my daughter wonderful? By the way, you weren’t bad either!” That was my mom… my biggest fan! Anyway….that event created a special bond between Christopher and Me that endures to this day. And I still have the distinction for being the only person to perform Live with Christopher in his Show!!!!\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nMONDAY…..\n\nHAPPY APRIL 27 BIRTHDAY TO ….
