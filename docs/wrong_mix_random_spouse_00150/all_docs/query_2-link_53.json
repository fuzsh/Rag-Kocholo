        "text": "MAN OF THE PEOPLE A Life of Harry S. Truman. By Alonzo L. Hamby. Illustrated. 760 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $35.\n\nText:\n\nON April 12, 1945, Vice President Harry S. Truman was having a late-afternoon bourbon with his old Senate pals at the Capitol when a message arrived from the White House. \"Please come right over,\" it said, \"and come in through the main Pennsylvania Avenue entrance.\" Truman grabbed his hat and raced out of the building to his unguarded limousine. At the White House, Eleanor Roosevelt calmly took him aside. With remarkable tenderness, Truman recalled, she put her arm on his shoulder and said, \"Harry, the President is dead.\"\n\nThe nation's grief was overwhelming. Franklin Roosevelt had been President forever, it seemed, leading his flock through the Depression and World War II. Following in his footsteps would not be easy, as Truman discovered at the White House funeral service. When he entered the room, the shaken mourners neglected to rise.\n\nThe need to be recognized and respected dominated Harry Truman's life. That is the main theme of Alonzo L. Hamby's superb new biography, \"Man of the People.\" So much has been written about Truman in recent years -- most of it celebratory -- that yet another book about him runs the risk of being ignored. That would be unfortunate in this case, since the Truman we meet in these pages is more troubled, complicated and genuine than the man we have read about before. While Mr. Hamby's account lacks the narrative drive of David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Truman,\" published in 1992, it is superior, I think, in providing a clear interpretive framework for understanding the relationship between Truman's personal traits and his momentous Presidential decisions.\n\nMr. Hamby, a professor of history at Ohio State University, presents Truman as a product of rural Missouri, caught between the certainties of small-town 19th-century America and the rapid changes of modern urban life. His values were clear, fixed and traditional. He cherished his marriage and his family. His friendships lasted a lifetime. As President, he corresponded with boyhood pals, invited old Army buddies to his inauguration (\"I don't give a damn what you do,\" he told them, \"but I want you to stay sober\" until the inaugural address) and spent two weeks at his 94-year-old mother's farmhouse while she recovered from a stroke. He possessed egalitarian instincts, remarkable courage and a pioneer's faith that big things could come from small stakes. In Truman's world view, Mr. Hamby says, \"distinctions between good and evil were unambiguous,\" and \"gray areas\" were almost unknown.\n\nThere was prejudice, too. Truman's life was a constant struggle to overcome provincial stereotypes and suspicions. After visiting New York City for the first time during World War I, he complained: \"If only I could have stayed these two days in Kansas City instead of this . . . Kike town, I'd have felt much better.\" He disliked Paris even more. The Folies-Bergere performance was \"disgusting,\" he wrote, as was most of French life. He dismissed modern art as \"the vaporings of half-baked lazy people.\" The great artists, he said, had the good sense \"to make things look as they are.\" And he fretted over attempts to redo American education, writing in his diary: \"Some day we'll awake, have a reformation of the heart, teach our kids honor and kill a few sex psychologists, put boys in high schools to themselves with men teachers (not sissies), close all the girls finishing schools, shoot all the efficiency experts and become a nation of God's people once more.\"\n\nNothing came easy to Truman. His small stature, thick eyeglasses and mandatory piano lessons set him apart from the crowd as a child. \"Why, no, I was never popular,\" he once admitted. \"The popular boys were the ones who were good at games and had big, tight fists. I was never like that.\" Despite enormous personal effort, he failed as a farmer, mine owner, oil speculator and haberdasher. His first success came as an artillery officer during World War I. Well past draft age, Truman performed \"effectively and bravely,\" Mr. Hamby notes, gaining personal confidence and widespread respect. The war brought out his leadership abilities, offered him masculine satisfaction and made him a host of important new friends. It was, in many ways, the defining experience of his life.\n\nTruman's Army contacts led him into the murky world of politics, Kansas City style. Elected Jackson County Eastern District Judge (in effect, county executive) with the aid of Tom Pendergast, a crooked Democratic boss, Truman walked a fine line between efficient service to his constituents and partisan loyalty to a corrupt political machine. Mr. Hamby provides a good view of the world in which Truman operated. Fair and honest himself, he went about the business of building better roads and improving public services while ignoring the squalor and thievery of those who put him in office. \"Looks like everybody got rich in Jackson County but me,\" Truman wrote his wife, Bess, after Pendergast went to Federal prison. \"I'm glad I can still sleep well even if it is a hardship on you and Margie for me to be so damn poor.\"\n\nWorking with the Pendergast machine had an enormous impact upon Truman. It sensitized him to the needs of diverse groups, fueled his belief in a welfare system, and got him elected to the Senate in 1934. On the other hand, the label of \"machine politician\" would plague him for years. It was hard to earn respect as a legislator, despite his substantial accomplishments in Washington, when the press kept referring to him as \"the Senator from Pendergast.\"\n\nTRUMAN was an accidental President, chosen by Democratic Party regulars to replace the enigmatic Henry Wallace as Roosevelt's Vice-Presidential running mate in 1944. \"Not having seen F.D.R. face to face for more than a year,\" Mr. Hamby writes, Truman \"was shocked by Roosevelt's haggard appearance and the way his hands trembled as he attempted with little success to pour cream into his coffee.\" When Roosevelt died a few months later, Truman publicly described himself -- unwisely, Mr. Hamby says -- as a simple man overwhelmed by the prospect of filling a giant's shoes. If he really believed this, his opinion changed almost overnight. \"It won't be long,\" he wrote to Bess, \"until I can sit back and study the whole picture and . . . there'll be no more to this job than there was to running Jackson County and not any more worry.\"\n\nIt wasn't quite that simple. In his first year in office, Truman ordered atomic weapons dropped on Japan, fenced with Stalin over the future of Eastern Europe and fought to keep the spirit of New Deal liberalism alive. There are no great surprises in Mr. Hamby's account. What emerges is a balanced treatment of Truman as decision maker, emphasizing the personal factors that shaped his thinking, limited his vision and gave him inner strength. Confronting a host of critics and revisionists on the atomic bomb issue, for example, Mr. Hamby concludes that Truman made the right choice, basing it on his own war experience and the best information at hand. As an artillery officer Truman had prided himself on losing only one soldier under his command. After hearing about the intensity of Japanese resistance on Iwo Jima and Okinawa, he feared the blood bath that would result from an invasion of the Japanese home islands. His job, as President, was to end the war quickly and protect American lives. For all the debate and second-guessing, Mr. Hamby says, one brutal certainty remained: \"Japan was unable to muster the will to quit until two atomic bombs had been dropped.\"\n\nIn some ways, Truman did view America as an extension of Jackson County and the politics he knew best. His job was to provide services to loyal constituents and legitimate interest groups. Sometimes this meant swallowing old prejudices; mostly, it meant doing what he thought was right. He struggled hard at times, as his private letters and diaries attest. On the eve of proposing the most important civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, he complained to his sister that Eleanor Roosevelt \"has spent her public life stirring up trouble between whites and blacks -- and I'm in the middle.\" As he moved to recognize the new state of Israel, against the wishes of State Department advisers, he fumed at the intense Jewish pressure on him, claiming, \"Jesus Christ couldn't please them when He was here on earth, so how could anyone expect that I would have any luck?\"\n\nTruman's greatest triumph, of course, was the Presidential election of 1948. Running as the underdog, he defeated the Republican candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, on his own, without the aid of Tom Pendergast or F.D.R. And he got to tweak the cynics, those who doubted his character and ability. But his triumph was short-lived. A rush of events -- the Alger Hiss case, the fall of China to Communism, the news of a Soviet atomic bomb, the rise of McCarthyism and the Korean War -- demolished Truman's hard-earned popular support. Either forgotten, or held against him, were the most difficult, and historically the most sound, decisions of his Presidency -- from civil rights to the Marshall Plan to the firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. When he left the White House in 1953, his positive rating in opinion polls hovered around 25 percent.\n\nAS President, Truman vented most of his considerable anger in private. His diary entries spoke of hanging \"traitors\" like the labor leader John L. Lewis and bombing the Russians. He picked over every imagined slight and displayed a hatred of the press that easily rivaled Richard Nixon's. Truman aides checked his personal correspondence to make certain that inflammatory letters, dashed off in a rage, did not reach the mail sack. Sometimes they missed. In 1950, Truman sent a furious note to a Washington Post music critic who had panned a vocal concert by his daughter, Margaret. \"Some day I hope to meet you,\" the President wrote on White House stationery. \"When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beef steak for black eyes and perhaps a supporter below!\" The critic, no doubt thrilled, sold the note to a collector.\n\nAs an ex-President, Truman expressed himself freely. In an age of televised sound bites and obvious Government deception, his plain speaking seemed candid and refreshing, in spite of the content. He attacked \"snobbish liberals,\" black sit-in protesters and politicians across the board. When asked about John F. Kennedy's Presidential ambitions in 1960, Truman blasted the candidate's controversial father: \"It's not the Pope I'm afraid of; it's the pop.\" A few weeks later, he told a Democratic dinner audience, \"If you vote for Nixon, you ought to go to hell.\"\n\nBy the time of his death in 1972, Truman had become an American hero. More than two decades later, his reputation soars. What Mr. Hamby has done, with great skill, is to remind us of the real Harry Truman, to demythologize him without slighting his accomplishments or his rough road to success. The people love Truman for good reason, as a common man who cared about them and demonstrated their potential. \"His climb to the top in this Darwinian world can be seen as a triumph of the values America represented,\" Mr. Hamby concludes. \"Thus to celebrate him is to celebrate ourselves.\" <123>\n\nOctober 29, 1995, Sunday <127> Because of an editing error, a review on page 10 of the Times Book Review today about \"Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman,\" by Alonzo L. Hamby, misstates the author's affiliation. He is a professor of history at Ohio University, not Ohio State."
