His mother, Nancy Mace, was born in Kortright, with the nineteenth century, November 10, 1800. His father, for whom he was named, John Andrews, was born in Stamford on May 11, 1798. The grandfather, Samuel Wakeman Andrews, was a farmer, who on horseback came from Connecticut to Delaware County, and settled in Stamford, where he bought a tract of wild land, and built a log cabin. This was in 1790, while Washington was in the midst of his first administration. Catskill was the nearest market. Game was very abundant. Success meant hard labor; but in this respect Samule Andrews was fully up to the mark, taking the lead among the agriculturists of his day. At his death, at the age of sixty-five, he was the proud possessor of four hundred valuable acres, and left his family the equal heritage of a good name. He was a Democrat (Republican, the party was early called), and perhaps not particularly well pleased when, not long before his son John's birth, the federalists elected John Adams, in opposition to that deep thinker and steadfast patriot, Thomas Jefferson. Mr. Andrews belonged to the Baptist church; but his wife, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Meriam, was a Methodist. They had ten sons and two daughters, all but one of whom lived to the age of about fourscore, and one was living in 1894 -- Benjmin Andrews, of new York City.\n\nAmong these children, as already suggested, was John, the father of the subject of this sketch. He grew up on the farm in Stamford, but added to farming a skilful knowledge of carpentry. His first land purchase was in another part of Delaware County, the town of Hamden, where he also found plenty to do as a builder. His next business venture was in Kortright, where he added wagon-making to his former trade, and also bought a second farm, on which he labored till the last part of his life. He passed from earth in 1881, while living in his son John's home, at the good old age of eighty-three. His wife died in the same filial home, at the age of eighty-five. Both were stanch adherents of the United Presbyterian church. Politically, he followed his father in being a Democrat; and he had nearly the same number of children, ten in all, of whom six survive. Samuel, named for his grandfather, is a citizen of the metropolis, and so are his brothers, Charles and Benjamin Clark. Their sister Elizabeth has a home with her brother John J. Mrs. Mary D. Bush, another sister, lives in the village of Hobart. Simeon Mace Andrews died at the age of sixty-six. Charles Clark, Cordelia, and Hannah Andrews died in early life. It is a religious as well as a patriotic satisfaction to the Andrews family that they are able to trace their lineage directly back to an ancestor bearing the same name, who crossed the seas in the \"Mayflower,\" and landed where \"the breaking waves dashed high, on a stern and rockbound coast.\"\n\nJ. J. Andrews was like his father in growing to manhood on the paternal acres, though in a different district. What schooling was possible he obtained in his native place. Even after he began to support himself he still lived under the parental roof-tree, and cared for his father and mother in the feebler years. He was not married till the second day of October, 1878. The bride was born in Hobart, April 24, 1859. Her name was Mary Emma Kniskern, and at the time of her marriage she was only nineteen. Her mother, Jane Eleanor Story, was born in Schoharie County, December 17, 1828; and her father, John F. Kniskern, an industrious cabinet-maker and builder, was born in the same country, February 7, 1822. Their home was, and still is, in Hobart, where they are active workers in the Methodist church. A Republican in politics, Mr. Kniskern has always been interested in everything that affects the welfare of the community. To the Kniskerns were born ten children, as also to the parents of Mr. Andrews. Walter J. is a house-painter in Hobart. Aldamont is a bookkeeper in Baltimore. Mrs. Maud Chapman resides in new York City. Claude is a resident of Hobart. Mary is the wife of Mr. Andrews. Mrs. Cora L. P. Lyon resides in the metropolis. Herman and John B. are both painters in the village of Hobart, like their brother Walter. Elloy and Jennie both died when only eighteen months old. The productive farm where Mr. Andrews and his family reside was bought in 1865, just at the close of the Civil War. To the original two hundred and eighteen acres he added one hundred and twenty-six more two years later, so that he now owns three hundred and forty-four acres, one of the largest farms in this section. Like his neighbors, he turns his attention mainly to dairy products, having seventy-five milch cows, and selling ten cans of milk daily, the year round. He also deals in fine horses, and keeps his barns and stables in excellent condition. Three children have blessed the home. Maud Elizabeth was born November 23, 1879, and still graces the homestead. John Simeon, named for grandfathers and an uncle, was born May 15, 1884, and has not yet left home; and the same is naturally true of his younger brother, Benjamin Clark, born March 22, 1887. These children are growing up an honor to their parents. Mrs. Andrews is Presbyterian in faith. Her husband, however, is a liberal in his religious views. In politics he is a Democrat, like the two generations preceding him. The home is located in the beautiful valley of the Delaware River, and surrounded by the hills and mountains forming part of the famous Catskill range.\n\nGEORGE WEBSTER. The thriving village of Walton has a full quota of live, energetic, and persevering business men, among whom is the subject of this sketch, who, in company with Mr. Frank Clark, has recently embarked in the market business. He is a man of sound judgment and keen foresight, and has met with uniform success in the various transactions in which he has engaged. He is a native of the Empire State, appearing upon the scenes of life in 1841, in the town of Milford, Otsego County, at the homestead of his parents, David and Ruth (Worden) Webster.\n\nDavid Webster was born on the green sod of the Emerald Isle, in the year 1796, in Armagh, County Down, and was named for his father. When fifteen years old, he accompanied his parents to America. They had an unusually tempestuous voyage. Their seven weeks of ocean travel being weeks of terror and danger. After landing in New York City, they proceeded at once to the town of Westford, near Schenevus, Otsego County, where they bought a tract of timbered land, on which they reared their large family of eighteen children, all of whom were born in Ireland. Many of these sons and daughters were old enough to be of great assistance in clearing and improving the land; and in a few years they had a good farm, entirely free from debt. On this homestead, which they reclaimed from the forest, David Webster Sr., and his wife spent their remaining years rearing their large family to habits of industry and economy; and all became honored and trustworthy men and women, and most of them well-to-do farmers. They were Protestant in religion, and held in high respect throughout their neighborhood.\n\nDavid Webster, Jr., the father of George Webster, was an earnest and honest tiller of the soil, and after his marriage bought a farm in Otsego County, on which he resided until 1849, prosperously engaged in mixed husbandry. During that year he removed to Delaware County, buying a farm in the town of Tompkins. After living there eight years, he exchanged that two hundred acres of land for a farm near by, and was there a resident until the spring of 1866, conducting his agricultural interests very successfully. Selling that at an advance, he purchased another farm, which was finely stiuated on the Delaware River, between Cannonsville and Deposit. In 1869, feeling the infirmities of years coming on apace, and having performed his full share of manual labor, he sold his property to his son, with whom he and faithful wife afterward made their home, both dying in Cannonsville, at the age of eighty-six years, his death occuring in 1882, and hers in 1884. Of eleven children born to them nine grew to maturity, four sons and five daughters; and of these the following are now living: John, a farmer, who lives in Sanford, Broome County; Mary Ann, the widow of Stutely Sherman, who resides near Cooperstown Junction, in Otsego County; Ebenezer, who likewise lives near Cooperstown Junction, and owns, in company with his son-in-law, a valuable farm of six hundred acres, on which they carry on an extensive business in dairying and hop-growing; Ruth Ann, the wife of N. S. Boyd, a farmer, who lives in Downsville; and George, of whom we write.\n\nGeorge Webster received a limited education in the district school, and at the early age of eight years began working on the farm, his first employment being to drive the team for his father to plough. From this time until the year 1890 Mr. Webster was steadily engaged in agricultural pursuits, and was a farmer of more than average skill and ability, his early experience in that line being of inestimable value to him. His first purchase of land was near Cannonsville, and contained one hundred and fity acres of rich and productive land, from which he received a good annual income. In 1890 he sold that farm for the consideration of six thousand five hundred dollars, and, coming to the village of Walton, bought a small tract within the corporation limits. This he divided into town lots, all of which he has sold with the exception of five. In 1893 he and his son bought the Walton bakery, which is now under the management of his two elder sons, Eugene and Arthur.\n\nThe marriage of Mr. Webster and Miss Hulda Pomeroy was celebrated September 30, 1863. Mrs. Webster Webster was born in Hamden, Delaware County, and is a daughter or Orange D. And Sally (Montfort) Pomeroy, the former of whom was born in Massachusetts, and the latter in Delaware County. This union has been blessed with three children: Eugene, who married Emma Tiffany, and has one daughter, now a few months old; Arthur, who married Florence Walworth, and also has one child, a bright boy of fourteen months; and George L., a young man of eighteen years, who is now attending the Walton High School. Mr. and Mrs. Webster occupy a very pleasant home on Park Street, which they bought from William Woodin, who had built it for his own use.\n\nIn politics Mr. Webster is an uncompromising Republican, ever interested in local matters, and now serving as Village Trustee. While in Tompkins he was for one year Assessor. In his religious views he coincides with the tenets of the Baptist church, of which he and his wife and two children are faithful and worthy members, he being a Trustee and Deacon.\n\nEDWARD AUGUSTUS SHAFFER is a leading citizen of Margarettville. Where he has a large store in the very centre of the village. He was born May 27, 1869, in the town of Andes; and his antecedents are worth considering. The great-grandparents were Adam and Laura (Shoefelt) Shaffer. Adam Shaffer was born in Dutchess County, and there married. With his wife and older children he came to Delaware County, and settled in the village of Shavertown, in Andes, on the banks of the Delaware River, on a farm now owned by W. H. Terry. He brought cattle and horses from his old home, and built almost the first log house and barn in this part of the town. On Beach Hill Creek he built subsequently the only saw-mill to be found for many miles; and, as there were as yet no roads to Kingston, the nearest settlement, only trails through the woods, it was no easy task to get together the proper materials. As there was great need of a grist-mill, he contrived a rude machine for corn-grinding, much like an old-fashioned well-sweep; only, in place of a bucket, was a heavy stone that was pounded up and down upon the grain, which was placed in a hollow log by way of a hopper. So indispensable was this pounder that farmers came from near and far to use it. Then Mr. Shaffer began to raft lumber down the river, and in the course of years was able to erect a frame house and barn, the first in this part of the county. It need hardly be said that a farmer so enterprising and inventive soon wanted more than the two hundred acres at first bought. In the woods were wolves, bears, panthers, and wild-cats, as well as deer. Like the father of the human race, this Adam could call the beasts by name, and in later life could narrate to a younger generation many an adventure of the wilderness. Six boys helped him in his work -- George, Henry, Philip, Peter, William, and John. The pioneer was a Whig in his latter days, but earlier in life was a Federalist; and the family belonged to the Dutch Reformed church. Adam Shaffer died in middle life, at fity-two; but his wife lived to be a dozen years older.\n\nAdam Shaffer's son William, on attaining manhood, bought part of his father's farm. He married Hannah Vail, daughter of Joseph and Ruby (Wilson) Vail, who came from the South settle on the banks of the Delaware, reared a large family, and lived to be old people, though the descendants are no longer found in this region. Like his father, William Shaffer not only farmed, but dealt largely in lumber, owning at one time three sawmills. Like his parents, William and Hannah Shaffer had six children. Alfred, born January 5, 1815, married Mary Jessup; and they had one child, who now lives in Andes. Delancey Shaffer was born in the last month of the year 1817. He was twice married, first to the Widow Bambardt, and second to Anne Knapp, and had in all seven children. Edwin Shaffer was born October 1, 1823. George R. Shaffer was born November 10, 1825, married Sarah Radecker, has two children, and lives in Shavertown. Sylvester Shaffer, born January 29, 1830, married Delotte Fuller, and lives in Downsville. Sallie C. Shaffer, born in August, 1839, married Dr. Oliver Carroll, lives in Port Jervis, and has one child. William Shaffer was a soldier in the war of 1812, and received for his service a thousand acres of land, divided into farms and woodland. He died March 30, 1835, and his wife on July 22, 1840.\n\nWilliam Shaffer's son Edwin, father of the subject of this sketch, studied in the district school, and worked at home, where he remained till he was thirty years old. His father gave him a saw-mill and land, and naturally Edwin took to the lumber business; but in 1864 he turned drover, taking cattle at first as far as Dutchess County, and later to New York City and New Jersey. November 29, 1863, amid the Civil War, he married, his wife being Agnes Boyce, daughter of James , Jr., and Barbara (Gordon) Boyce. James Boyce, Jr., was the son of James, Sr., and Agnes (Currie) Boyce, of Dumfries, Scotland. James Boyce the younger came to America when twenty-two years old, and here met and married Barbara Gordon, daughter of James and Mary (Hay) Gordon. Her brothers and sisters were Peter, Jane Ann, Owen, and Jeanette. At first James Boyce and his wife lived in New York City, but later in Delhi and Andes. The names of their children were: James; Joshlynn, who married Laura Caulkins, and has two children; Mary; Peter, who married Mary E. Davis, and has one boy; Fannie; Agnes, who was born march 28, 1849, and married Edwin Shaffer, as already related; John, who is dead; Thomas, who married Maggie Bell, has four children, and lives in Hartford, Conn.; William A., who married Anna Burhaus, lives in Margarettville, and is a merchant; David, who lives in Michigan; Annie, who married C. J. Dickson, of whom a special sketch may be found. James Boyce lived in Andes when his wife died, in 1882, December 20, a member of the Presbyterian church; and then he moved to Margarettville, where he now lives, at the extreme age of eighty-five. Edwin and Agnes Shaffer had only two children. Edward Augustus Shaffer was born May 27, 1869, and was married June 28, 1893. Laura Anna Shaffer was born February 28, 1877, and lives at home. Their father is a Republican, and his wife is a Presbyterian.\n\nEdward Augustus Shaffer went to school winters and worked on the farm summers. Four years he worked for T. R. McFarland, and then, at the age of seventeen, was employed as clerk by C. J. Dickson, of Margarettville, his kinsman by marriage. Being then of age, he formed a partnership with Fred. S. Tobey; and they continued three years in the hardware business, till 1883, when Mr. Shaffer sold out, and worked a year with his old employer, and then went into business elsewhere for himself, adding to his plumbing an extensive traffic in all sorts of farming tools. His place of business is on Bridge Street. He was married in 1893, at the age of twenty-four. His wife, Cora M. Terpenning, is the only daughter of H. H. and Susa (Myles) Terpenning. He was born in Ulster County, near Esopus, and first did business in New York City, but later came to Margarettville, where he purchased of C. B. Schoonmaker the Riverside Hotel, and does a large business in entertaining summer borders. Mr. E. A. Shaffer is a Republican, very liberal in his religious views.\n\nLEWIS B. STRONG, a well-to-do farmer, residing on the Franklin road in the town of Meredith, is a man of much energy and ability, and has attained success by his untiring industry, combined with a careful and wise management of his business interests. He is a native of Delaware County, having been born on September 23, 1828, in that part of the town of Meredith lying between Delhi and Meredith Square. He comes of Colonial stock, and traces his ancestry back to one Caleb Strong, his great-grandfather, who was born in Connecticut, in the town of Colchester, February 20, 1713. He was a farmer by occupation, and spent his last years in Sharon, Conn. His son, Caleb Strong, Jr., was also of Connecticut birth, born June 20, 1749. He carried on farming in Sharon until 1797, when he came to this county and cleared off a tract of land now included in the site of Meredith Squre, remaining there until his decease. He married and reared thirteen children.\n\nWilliam, the youngest, was born February 29, 1797, in the Connecticut home of his parents, and brought here by them when an infant. He was bred a farmer, and remained with his father, helping in the farm work until of age. He then began working by the month for Judge Law, and subsequently bought a farm on Honest Brook, where he lived a few years. Selling that property, he removed to Taylor, Cortland County, residing there three years. In 1834 he returned to this county, and purchased the farm now owned and occupied by his son, Lewis B., the subject of this sketch. He labored diligently in clearing and improving the land, and in course of time waving fields of grain and green pasture lands occupied the tract where formerly stood the primeval forest. On this snug homestead he and his good wife passed their remaining years, she crossing the dark river of death in 1867, he dying in 1876, at the venerable age of seventy-nine years. The maiden name of Mrs. William Strong was Charlotte Whitney. She was a native of Walton, and was one of a large family of children born to David and Nancy (Raymond) Whitney, the date of her birth being February 15, 1800. Her parents were natives of New England; but after their marriage they settled in Walton, where Mr. Whitney followed the trade of a blacksmith for many years. Seven children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Strong; Mary Ann, who married Thomas Bartlett; Marietta, who married William H. Gates; Maria, who married Thomas Graham, a butter dealer of Croton; James W.; Lewis B.; William M.; and Milton M. Mrs. Strong was a noble type of the pioneer women of her day, a faithful coadjutor of her husband in all of his labors, and a sincere member of the Presbyterin church of Meredith.\n\nLewis B., the second son of William and Charlotte Strong, was two years of age when his parents went to Cortland County, where they lived three years, and was five years old when they removed to the farm he now occupies. He shortly began his education in the district school, and completing it at the Franklin Literary Institute was subsequently engaged one term in teaching. His assistance being then needed on the home farm, he gave his attention to that until 1853, when he purchased a farm in the western part of the town, where he resided ten years, successfully engaged in general husbandry. Returning in 1863 to the home of his boyhood, he bought the place, which he has since carried on with satisfactory pecuniary results. During the lifetime of his honored parents they remained inmates of his home, and were tenderly cared for by himself and family. His farm contains one hundred and twenty acres of good land, on which, besides raising grain of all kinds and cutting a good deal of hay, he keeps a dairy of graded Jerseys, which yield him a profitable income, his sweet, pure butter finding a ready market.\n\nMr. Strong has been twice married. His first wife, to whom he was united in 1850, was Jeanette Hymers, one of ten children born to John and Elizabeth (Ormiston) Hymers, the former of whom was a native of Scotland and the latter of Bovina. Three children were born of this union, namely: Henry M., who married Anna McCormick, of Meredith, and died at the age of thirty-two years; Alfred D., a butcher in Delhi, who married Sarah Thompson, and has one child, James Madison; Frank M., who married Adelia Osborne, of Croton, and has one child, Lewis Ranson. Mrs. Strong, a sweet, lovable woman, passed to the higher life in 1878, at the age of forty-six years. She was a true Christian, and a devout member of the Presbyterian church. Mr. Strong subsequently wedded Miss Eugenia L. Covell, a native of Wisconsin, and the daughter of Peter and Jane (Moscrip) Covell died in Wisconsin; and his wife returned with her family to Delaware County, and married James Sloane, who was for many years a well-known farmer in the town of Kortright.\n\nPolitically, Mr. Lewis B. Strong is a true-blue Republican, and in the affairs of his town and county takes an intelligent interest. He has filled the office of Supervisor four terms, and for eleven years was a Justice of the Peace. Six years he was employed as Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue. Religiously, he is a believer in the tenets of the Methodist church, to which his wife belongs.\n\nMILTON H. MAYNARD, a prominent lumber merchant at Fish's Eddy, was born October 26, 1829, in Delhi, Delaware County. His earliest ancestors in this country came from England and settled in Massachusetts. Thomas Maynard, his grandfather, was born in Deerfield, on the Maynard farm, which is one of the oldest in that part of the State. He married Elizabeth Choat, of Deerfield, and, with a colony of Eastern people, comprising members of the Maynard, Choat, and Parsons families, migrated to Schoharie County, New York, late in last century, settling in that part of Blenheim now called Gilboa. They came as far as Newburg, N. Y., by water, and then were conveyed by ox carts to Blenheim, where they built their log cabins on the highest hills they could find. Here they lived a most primitive life, depending mainly upon the game, deer, and fish for their daily food. They built strong enclosures for their sheep and cattle as protection against the wolves, panthers, and bears, which were abundant. The women spun, carded, and wove the wool and flax, and manufactured all the garments worn by the family. Elizabeth, the wife of Thomas Maynard, was a descendant of the Choat family of Massachusetts, her father having a family of thirteen children, nine of whom lived to be over eighty years of age. He himself died after more than fourscore years, and was buried on the Choat farm in Gilboa, having with his wife been a faithful member of the Baptist church. A. S. Maynard, father of the subject of this biography, was educated in his native town, and assisted his parents on the home farm until he became of age. He married Ophelia Reekie, daughter of Andrew Reekie, of Stamford, Delaware County. Her father was a supporter of the last Stuart pretender to the British crown, and came to this country as a political refugee with a price upon his head. He was a soldier in the Revolutionary War, and first met at Newburg, after Burgoyne's surrender, the lady who became his wife. He served until the close of the war, then married and settled in Stamford, where he resided until his death, at the age of ninety-four years. His wife survived him ten years.\n\nA. S. Maynard was the father of eleven children, seven of whom grew to manhood and womanhood. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, and died at the age of seventy-six.\n\nMilton H. Maynard was educated in the Stamford Academy, and then went to Franklin, after which he began the study of medicine, but soon gave that up and taught school for a number of terms. About the year 1853, in company with A. B. Stimpson, he started a store, which he sold to his partner in 1857; and he has since been engaged in the lumbering business.\n\nHis first marriage was in 1854 to Marie A. Fletcher, of Davenport, by whom he had four children, namely: Augustus, now a resident of Hancock village; Lasael A., editor of the Christian at Work, a paper edited in the interest of the Christian religion in New York City; Ida P., wife of James M. Driver, of Narrowsburg, Sullivan County, who died in July, 1894; Dewhurst F., who died in 1874, when seventeen years old. The mother of these children died in 1863; and Mr. Maynard afterward married Elizabeth F. Sparks, daughter of Robert and Eleanor (Sniffin) Sparks, of Fremont, Sullivan County. Mrs. Maynard is the mother of four sons -- Edwin L., Arthur H., Carlisle M., Manton H. - all of whom live at home and assist in the management of their father's farm.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Maynard are members of the Methodist Episcopal church at Fish's Eddy, and politically he is a Democrat. He has been a Justice of Peace since 1858, and has been Justice of Sessions for two terms, still holding the position. A portrait of this useful and honored citizen, who is well known as a man of good business ability and of upright life, graces an adjoining page.\n\nJOHN H. BAUMES, one of Delaware County's enterprising farmers, proprietor and manager for several years of the first steam saw-mill in Masonville, was born in Bethlehem, Albany County, N. Y., May 24, 1835, son of David and Maria (McKnab) Baumes. His parents were both natives of the county, where they began life almost with the close of that century, the date of his father's birth being February 22, 1799, and of his mother Janury 3, 1800.\n\nJohn Baumes, father of David, was of German descent, but was born in New York State. In early manhood he owned land in Albany County, and was engaged in its cultivation. Later he removed to Schoharie County, where he died at the age of seventy-two years. Mr. John Baumes was industrious and thrifty, and was a man of substance. In politics he was a Democrat, or States' Rights man. He and his wife, Hannah Moshier, who lived to be of middle age, had a large family of children, some of whom died when young; but eight studious sons grew to manhood, and married before they went the way of all the earth.\n\nOne of these, David named above, learned the carpenter's trade, and was a contractor and builder in the city of Albany for a number of years. He afterward spent a year or two in Cayuga County, and about five years in Schoharie County, when in 1848 he removed to Masonville, where he bought land and carried on general farming. In 1856 he and his son, John H., who was then twenty-one years of age, bought the farm of one hundred and eighty acres where the latter now lives; and here he made his home during the latter part of his life. He died, however, during a visit to Schoharie County, March 8, 1867, his wife having died the previous year, on February 19, 1866. She was a Methodist, and he a liberal in religion. In politics, like his father, he was a Democrat. Mr. and Mrs. David Baumes had eight children, six of whom grew to maturity. Five are now living, as follows: Margaret Seely, residing in Sidney; Angelina Bowman, in Masonville; Louise Smith, in Hamilton, Madison County; John H., in Masonville; and James R. Baumes, a former Judge, in Sidney.\n\nJohn H. Baumes received most of his schooling in Schoharie County, but had also the advantage of one term in Hamilton Adademy. He was thirteen years old when the family removed to Masonville; and he continued to live with his parents and work for his father till he attained his majority, when he began farming for himself on the land of which he was part owner. After the death of his father he bought out the other heirs, and thus acquired sole possession of his present farm of one hundred and thirty acres. When he first began to work on the land, all but about five acres was covered with woods. To the task of clearing and improving he devoted himself with energy, sagacity, and success. Instead of preparing his land for the plough and his timber for market by the wasteful process of reducing the trees to ashes, he built a steam saw-mill; and he and his brother, buying two hundred and eighty acres more of woodland in the vicinity, were engaged profitably for about fifteen years in the manufacture of lumber, in which they did a more extensive business than any other men in the town, the product of the mill being over three hundred thousand feet hemlock. Having since disposed of both the mill and the land, he now devotes himself to the care of his original homestead, where he carries on general husbandry and dairying. He keeps twenty cows, grade Ayrshires, and has an average of twelve thousand pounds of milk a month for eight months of the year. He has a good farm which is well managed and productive.\n\nOn New Year's Day, 1867, Mr. Baumes married Mary Burnside, who was born in the town of Butternuts, Otsego County, January 13, 1847, daughter of James and Louise Burnside. Her father was a farmer. He died at the age of seventy-two, and her mother at forty-seven years of age. Mr. and Mrs. Baumes have one child, a daughter, Nellie Baumes, who was born March 6, 1868, and is a cultivated and accomplished young lady, a graduate of Oxford Academy in the class of 1888. Miss Baumes has already taught fifteen terms of school, including one year in the high school.\n\nMr. John H. Baumes inclines to liberalism in religion, and is a Democrat in politics. He has served as Highway Commissioner one year and as Assessor five years, being a man of unquestioned integrity and sound judgment in regard to property values. He is a Mason, being a member of Lodge No. 606, A. F. & A. M., and of Deposit Chapter, No. 283. Although only in his sixtieth year, Mr. Baumes is one of the oldest settlers in this part of the town of Masonville, which by his untiring enterprise he has done much to build up and improve. Diligent in business, self-respecting and respected, he lives not for himself alone, but as a useful member of society, a valued citizen of the great republic.\n\nDR. MARCUS O. LANDON, dentist, whose office is on Main Street, Delhi, possesses great professional knowledge and skill, and occupies a leading position among the prominent dentists of this part of the State. He is a native of this place, where he first opened his eyes to the light on march 15, 1859, being a son of David G. Landon, one of Delhi's most respected citizens, and a descendant of an honored pioneer. Asa Landon, the father of David, was born in New England, and there spent several years of his early life. Accompanied by two of his brothers, he migrated to this part of New York when the intervening country was little more than a wilderness, and leased a tract of wild land in Delhi, and afterward reclaimed from the forest a valuable homestead. His brothers were equally successful in their pioneer labors, and the trio spent their remaining years in this locality.\n\nDavid G. Landon, son of Asa, was reared on the parental homestead, receiving as good educational advantages as the schools of his time afforded. He was a very active, enterprising youth, and at the age of fifteen years began clearing a tract of land in Delhi. When at a suitable age to assume the responsibilities of a benedict, he married Mary Ann Dibble, the daughter of Cornelius Dibble, a prosperous farmer of Bovina; and they commenced housekeeping in the log cabin which he had previously erected on his land. He worked with untiring industry, and, as time progressed, had the satisfaction of seeing the once heavily timbered land covered with waving fields of grain, and the log cabin, in which the older children of his household were born, replaced by a substantial frame house. He subsequently sold that farm, and bought the one where he now lives, and has since continued his agricultrual pursuits. To him and his wife four children were born, namely: Amelia, who died when young; George A.; Cornelius F.; and Marcus O.\n\nMarcus O. Landon spent his boyhood days in this town, acquiring the rudiments of his education in the district school, and afterward attending the academy. In 1876 he removed to Cobleskill, where he began the work of his profession, remaining there four and one-half years in active employ. In 1881, Dr. Landon returned to the place of his nativity, and was very soon in the possession of an excellent and lucrative practice. He has now, without doubt, the largest business in dentistry in Delaware County, and is reputed to be one of the leading men in his profession in the State.\n\nThe nuptials of Dr. Landon and Emma B. Browne were solemnized on August 6, 1885. Mrs. Landon is the daughter of the Rev. George Browne, pastor of the Presbyterian church of Hamden, and his wife, Maria (McLaren) Browne. Religiously, the Doctor and his wife are esteemed members of the Episcopal church of Delhi, in which he is a Vestryman. In politics he is identified with the Republican party; and socially he is prominent in the Masonic fraternity, having belonged to Delhi Lodge, No. 439, A. F. & A. M., of which he is Past Master. He is also a member of Delhi Chapter, No. 249, of Norwich Commandery, No. 46, and of the Scottish Rite.\n\nMARTIN CHURCH, wagon-maker, residing in Sidney, is a hearty and vigorous man of seventy-seven years, still an active worker at his trade. His grandparents, James and Lois (Dart) Church, were born in Connecticut, and were there married. They reared a family of six children, all of whom were married excepting one daughter, Nancy, who died in Otego, at the advanced age of seventy-two years. Other children were born to them, but were called to their hevenly home when young. In 1806 Mr. and Mrs. James Church migrated from their New England home to the wilds of Otsego County, starting in the month of February or March, making the journey in an old-fashioned cart, drawn by a pair of oxen. On their way through the Catskill Mountains they were snowed in, and had to excange their wheels for runners, fitting up a sled, in which they completed their trip. They settled in the town of butternuts, Otsego County, where their children grew to maturity, and where they spent their remaining years, Grandfather Church living to the venerable age of ninety-three years, departing this life 1857.\n\nThe parents of Martin, Ebenezer, and Charity (Emmons) Church were natives of Connecticut, and were both born in the year 1790. Their union was celebrated in the town of Butternuts, where they afterward lived and labored as long as their lives were spared, the mother dying in 1871, and the father some seven years later. Of their four children one, Julia, the eldest born, died at the age of twelve years. Levi B. died at Butternuts in 1866, leaving one son and four daughters. Isaac, a wagon-maker and a farmer, is a respected resident of the town of Butternuts. The other, Martin, as above mentioned, lives in Sidney.\n\nMartin Church was born in Butternuts in 1817. He received a limited amount of schooling in his youth, and at the age of fourteen years began working at the carpenter's trade with his father, continuing in that occupation for several years, having inherited in a large degree the mechanical ingenuity of his father and grandfather. In 1852 he began the trade of wagon-making, without, however, having served any apprenticeship. In company with his brother Isaac, he opened a shop in the village of Gilbertsville; and this they operated in partnership until 1867, when they dissolved by mutual agreement. In 1870 Mr. Church established his business in Sidney, meeting with such encouraging success in the first year that he resolved to make this his permanent abiding-place. He accordingly built his comfortable residence at No. 24 Main Street, and the shop where he is working he erected 1889. He is a thorough-going business man, prospering well in his labors, and a valued and esteemed citizen of the village.\n\nThe maiden name of the wife of Mr. Church, to whom he was united in 1841, was Huldah Ann Fairchild. She was a native of Otsego County, having been born in the town of New Lisbon, in 1820, being the descendant of a pioneer family of that place. She bore her husband six children, two of whom died in infancy, and one daughter, Mary, when only six years of age. Of the three children now living William D., now fifty-one years of age, is a printer by trade, and has a wife and one son, Daniel; Sanford E., who was named for the governor of that period, a cousin of his father, is a railway man, and is married, but has no children; and Emma, the wife of Willard B. Ruland, has eight children.\n\nMrs. Church, who was a most worthy woman, and trained her children to habits of industry and virtue, passed on to the higher life in 1878. In politics Mr. Church is a stanch Republican, having been identified with that party since the time of John C. Fremont, and, although interested in the welfare of his town, has never held any office, excepting that of Town Collector for a while in Butternuts.\n\nWILLIAM R. SWART was born on Beeman Hill, town of Middletown, Delaware County, on the thirtieth day of January, 1821. His grandfather, Tunis Swart, was a farmer at Esopus, on the Hudson River, and had accumulated quite a competence when his possessions were suddenly lost during the Revolutionary War, at the time that the village of Kingston was burned. Having lost his property in the patriotic cause, he received afterward a lot of two hundred and fifty acres from the Livingston tract in Delaware County, at what is now known as New Kingston. His father gave him a team and lumber wagon, also some farming implements, with which to begin life; and he bravely set forth upon the way, but, when he reached Delaware County, found it impossible to go farther until a road was opened from Margarettville, and here remained until a way was cut through the uncleared country. When at last, after a long delay, he arrived at his destination, he cut timer, and built a log house, and commenced the improvement of the land. Later he leased a lot on Beeman Hill, from which place he finally moved to the town of Hamden, where he remained until his death. He reared the following-named children: John, Samuel, William, Richard, Abraham, Anna, Electra, Attie, and Mary.\n\nSamuel Swart was born in Esopus, and came to Delaware County in his youth. Here he married Anna Beeman, a daughter of Solomon and Deborah Beeman. He bought a tract of eighty acres of land, doubling it by a later purchase, and here reared the following-named family: Solomon, who married Miss Mary J. Akerly, and had two children; William R. of this notice; Peter F., who married a Miss Drummond, and died, leaving five children; Attie, who married E. J. Faulkner, and became the mother of one child; Charles, deceased; Mary, who married Peter Delamater, and died, leaving two children; Orson, who married Miss Gussie Decker, and had three children. Samuel Swart afterward moved to Margarettville, residing there until his death. He died at the age of seventy-two years, having served in the War of 1812, been a faithful Democrat, and a conscientious member of the old-school Baptist church.\n\nWilliam R. Swart passed his boyhood at Beeman Hill, receiving an education at an old log school-house on Hubble Hill. Upon attaining his majority he began farming, and a year later learned the trade of carpenter, which for some years he plied through the long winters, driving stock and doing farm work during the summer seasons. Gradually, by industry, he accumulated enough capital to invest in a store at New Kingston, and entered into a partnership with Isaac Birdsell, this being the first store of general merchandise established in that village. This enterprise was sold out, however, and a similar one started in Margarettville. Mr. Swart engaging in business with his brother. Six years later he bought the old Drummond farm, which he finally sold, and purchased a dwelling in Margarettville. Having been successful in these various enterprises, he has retired from active business, although his services as a veterinary surgeon are still in demand. He is the owner of the handsome stallion, Pride of Dutchess.\n\nIn 1842 Mr. Swart was united in marriage with Elizabeth Drummond. Her father was a progressive farmer in New Kingston, and lived to attain the age of eighty-four years. Mrs. Swart had one sister, Mrs. Henry Reynolds, of New Kingston; but both are now deceased. For his second wife Mr. Swart married Mrs. Julia E. Carpenter, widow of Richard Carpenter, and daughter of Abram Akerly, who served in the War of 1812, and died at the age of ninety-eight. Mr. Carpenter passed away at the age of eighty-four. Mr. Swart is a stanch adherent of the Democratic party. He has been an active and useful citizen, has held various local offices, for two terms having been President of the village, and has taken great interest in educational matters, at the present time being a member of the Board of Education.\n\nTALLMAN C. BOOKHOUT. In the annals of Delaware County the name of Bookhout is of frequent and honorable mention, and the gentleman whose name appears at the head of this sketch is a worthy representative of the first of that family to settle in this section of New York. Mr. Bookhout is a native of this county, and was born in the town of Roxbury, November 24, 1841. For many years he was identified with the agricultural element of Walton, and in the pursuit of his chosen occupation amassed a competence. He is a man of great energy, enterprise, and financial ability, and occupies an important position among the successful and influential business men of Walton. He is of German origin, and is a grandson of John Bookhout, a pioneer of the county.\n\nJohn Bookhout was born in Krakow, Germany, and emigrated to America prior to the Revolution, settling in the Dutch settlement then called New Hamsterdam, now New York. At the breaking out of the Revolutionary War he enlisted in the service of his adopted country, serving seven years; and the musket which he carried during that time is still in the possession of one of his descendants. After the close of the war he married Nancy Smart, and the first decade of their wedded life they spent in Dover, Westchester County. Following the tide of emigration to Delaware County, they located in the town of Roxbury, where he was one of the first settlers. He secured a tract of timbered land, on which the family camped until the customary log cabin was raised, and for a short time one end of that was used for a stable. Standing at his cabin door, rifle in hand, he had no trouble in shooting sufficient game to furnish himself and family with a dinner at any time. The nearest grist-mill was twelve miles distant, and he frequently carried his grist to and fro on his back. He and his faithful wife lived together for upward of sixty years; and both died in the town of Roxbury, he passing away at the age of eighty-two, while his widow survived him living until the venerable age of ninety-four years. They were the parents of nine children. Both were religious people, and were charter members of the Congregational church of Roxbury, of which the father was Deacon for many years.\n\nWilliam Bookhout, the father of the subject of this sketch, was the oldest son of his parents, and was born on the farm in Roxbury. He was a farmer by occupation, and in early manhood married Caroline Hull, a native of Connecticut, a daughter of William Hull, and a niece of the world-renowned Commodore Isaac Hull. They became the parents of a large family, as follows: Nancy married Urion McKay, and settled in Lenawee County, Mich., where both died. Sabra is the wife of Francis O'Conner, of Delaware County. Elizabeth is the widow of G. W. Plough, and lives at Roxbury. Isaac married Useba Craft, and they are residents of Roxbury. Mary, the widow of Urion McKay, also lives in Roxbury. Tallman C. is our subject. Margaret died at the age of four years. George W., a resident of Roxbury, married Adelia Bouton. John resides in Dallas, Tex. Rose died, unmarried, in Michigan. James, who resides in the town of Franklin, married Emma Hall, of Walton. The father was a life-long and much esteemed resident of Roxbury, and in his political views was a Jacksonian Democrat. The mother lived to the advanced age of seventy-two years, dying on the old homestead in Roxbury. She was a woman of superior character, and a devoted member of the Methodist Episcopal church. Tallman C. Bookhout assisted his brother John to obtain an education. The latter went to Texas, where in course of time he became wealthy, and paid his brother all he had expended for him. He was afterward unfortunate, and lost his all through the failure of a bank. He was fortunate, however, in having friends in the North who had confidence in him, and loaned him a few hundred dollars. With this money he purchased the site upon which the city of Dallas now stands. In the boom which afterward followed he made a vast amount of money, and is now one of the wealthiest men in the State. He married Ella Randall, of Dallas, where they now reside, and of which city he has been Mayor.\n\nTallman C. Bookhout, to whom we refer in this brief sketch, was reared to man's estate in the town of Roxbury, and received a liberal education. At the first call for troops he enlisted in defence of his country in Company I, Seventy-second New York Volunteer Infantry, being the first volunteer from his town. With his regiment he served in Sicles's Brigade, and was an active and courgeous participant in many of the most important and decisive engagements of the Rebellion, among the earlier ones being the seige of Yorktown, battles of Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Seven Pines, and the Peninsular Campaign. He was stricken with fever, and sent to the David Island Hospital, New York, where he remained five months. He rejoined his regiment at Brandy Station, Va., and was attached to General Hancock's corps at the battle of the Wilderness, but during the second day's fight was wounded and left for dead on the field of battle, which, says Draper, \"was throbbing with the wounded.\" He was sounded in the left shoulder and left eye, the ball striking his gun and being shattered, three pieces entering his body.\n\nMr. Bookhout was a very courageous soldier and an expert marksman, and in relating the history of his army life often says that, if every Union man had killed as many of his adversaries as he did, there would not have been a rebel left to tell his side of the conflict. Among his victims was the rebel who killed the Major of his regiment, Mr. Bookhout shooting at him six times before killing him, and being shot at the same number of times by his opponent. He was subsequently sent to the hospital at Fredericksburg, narrowly escaping capture on the way thither. This was within fifteen days of the time for the expiration of his term of enlistment, and he was offered a furlough. He proceeded as far as Washington on his way home; but his patriotic impulses were in the ascendant, and he returned to Fredericksburg, starting from there on foot, with the hope of striking a train. Arriving at Fredericksburg, he found himself in the rear of Grant's army, and followed with his own regiment, which he joined at Cold Harbor. He went into the midst of the fray at that place with his arm in a sling, and without fire-arms, but soon procured the latter from the body of a dead comrade. He did heroic duty with his uninjured arm, probablly firing as many effective shots as others with the use of both. He next went with his company to Ream's Station, at Bermuda Hundred, and was subsequently at the siege of Petersburg, this being after his term of service had expired. He was also in the engagement at Weldon Railroad, afterward retiring from active duty, and returning home the 8th of July, 1864. His wound was very painful, and gave him much trouble, not healing for more than a year, and costing him about one hundred and fifty dollars.\n\nIn the spring of 1866 Mr. Bookhout was united in the holy bonds of matrimony with Miss Ellen Ferris, of Ashland, Greene County, N. Y. Three children have been born of this union: Carrie is the wife of Lewis Benedict, of Walton, Alden is a student in Union College, and Sarah lives at home. In 1893 Mr. Bookhout retured from his farm labors, and removed into the village of Walton, where he is enjoying the pleasant leisure to which his previous years of toil entitle him. In politics he is a firm adherent of the Republican party, and, although not a politician, is deeply interested in local and national matters. Fraternally, he belongs to Ben Marvin Post, No. 209, Grand Army of the Republic, and is prominent in Masonic circles.\n\nGARDNER L. RIDER, who died at his home in Masonville, N. Y., August 12, 1894, was born in the town of Sidney, January 8, 1828, son of John and Charlotte (Smith) Rider, the father being a native of Vermont, and the mother of Otego, Otsego County, N. Y. The grandfather, Gilead Rider, was a resident of Vermont, little being known of his antecedents.\n\nJohn Rider settled in Otsego County when a young man, and there followed the trade of a blacksmith, his specialty being the manufacture of a high grade of scythes. He afterward moved to the town of Sidney, where he purchased a farm of one hundred acres. This, however, he soon disposed of, and bought another farm of one hundred and twenty-five acres in the same town. He thenceforth turned his attention exclusively to farming, and was a hard-working and successful man of his day. In politics he was a Democrat, but never aspired to any public office. He was married to Miss Charlotte Smith, by whom he had the following children: John G., residing on the old homestead in Sidney; Gilead, a farmer of Sidney; Hannah, wife of Olmstead Flint, of Otego; Hattie Rider, of Unadilla; Elvira, wife of Adelbert Houston, of Otego; Gardner L., and Charlotte, who died young. Mrs. Charlotte Rider died aged sixty-five, and her husband at the age of eighty-seven.\n\nGardner L. Rider was educated in the town of Sidney. He lived at home until he was twenty-one; and after that he worked out by the month for four years for one man, making good wages, but unfortunately losing over four hundred dollars of his savings by the failure of his employer. In 1858 Mr. Rider settled in town of Masonville, buying at first seventy-five acres of land and adding to it until he had a fine farm of one hundred and fifty-three acres, and carried on a large dairy business, keeping about thirty head of native cattle.\n\nMr. Rider was married, April 8, 1858, to Sarah E. Thompson, who was born November 11, 1837, in Masonville, daughter of Rufus A. Thompson and Prudence E. Wells. Mr. Thompson was born in Otsego County, and his wife in Masonville, the Wells family being among the early settlers of the town. Mr. Thompson was a tanner in early life, his latter years being devoted to farming. He died in the village of Sidney, April 18, 1890, aged eighty-six; his wife died November 3, 1840, aged thirty-one. Mr. Thompson, who was twice married, had three children by his first wife and four by his second. Four children survive him, namely: Foster W.

Frank Rider, the only son, resides at home with his mother. He married Alice Robertson, and has one son, Foster Thomas Rider.\n\nMr. Rider, like his wife, was liberal in his religious views, and in politics was allied with the Democratic party. He possessed one of the best-kept farms in Masonville. He was distinctly the architect of his own fortune, having by diligent application, good judgment, and economy acquired the competency which he enjoyed in his declining years.\n\nEDMUND A. HOWES, a worthy citizen of Tompkins, was born in this town February 27, 1857. The Howes family, which is of English ancestry, came to New York from Caped Cod. Edmund Howes, grandfather of Edmund A., was engaged in farming and lumbering in the town of Thompson, Sullivan County, where he erected a house, which still stands. His wife was Polly Fields; and they had the following family: George, Benjamin, Jesse, Samuel, Edmund, Deborah, Emilly, Elizabeth, and Jane. Edmund Howes died in 1838, having passed the greater part of his life in Thompson, where he was buried.\n\nJesse, the third son, was born in Bridgeville, and spent his boyhood on the home farm. When about twenty-one, he started out for himself as a carpenter and joiner, following that occupation until 1850, when, in company with his brother George, he purchased a tract of land on the Delaware River near Long Eddy, and here engaged in shipping lumber to Philadelphia. He was an excellent swimmer and an expert hunter, the hero of many thrilling adventures. After about eight years he sold his interest to his brother, and in 1855 purchased a tract of one hundred acres of timbered land on Bullock Hill, where he erected a log cabin, and began to fell the trees. He later built a frame house on the same site, and engaged in farming and dairying. He married Susan Jenkins, daughter of Horace and Anna (Vermilyea) Jenkins, of Roxbury, N. Y. She is still living, and is greatly esteemed by all. Her father was in his younger days one of the most prominent men of his town; he now spends much of his time with his grand-daughter, Mrs. Howes.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Jesse Howes were the parents of twelve children, namely: Anna F., widow of Charles Drake, a farmer of Tompkins, who died in 1881, and is buried on Knickerbocker Hill; Loomis; Horace J., who married Ella A.

Moore, a prominent druggist of Oneonta, and has one child, Leona; Joseph I., who was married January 18, 1892, to Miss Grace Van Vechten, of Rensselaer County, and is one of the rising young farmers of the town. He was elected to the office of Justice of the Peace, which position he now holds, and is a member of Lodge No. 466, A. F. & A. M. In politics, like his father, he is a Democrat.\n\nMr. Roberts has been Supervisor of the town for two years, and has also filled minor town offices. He is a member of Lodge No. 466, A. F. & A. M., of Oneonta, and is also a Royal Arch Mason, belonging to Delhi Chapter, No. 249. Mr. Roberts is one of the most respected farmers in Delaware County. He is a man of sterling worth, giving life and spirit to the town of his nativity, and taking a deep interest in all enterprises which tend to promote its welfare.\n\nARTHUR H. ST. JOHN, M. D., represents in a worthy manner the medical profession of Walton, one of the most prosperous and thriving towns of Delaware County, and socially is regarded as one of its most valued citizens. His native place was at Cranbury, N. J., the date of his birth being May 8, 1856. He is a son of Isaac J. and Elizabeth P. (Hanford) St. John, both of whom were natives of Delaware County.\n\nThe subject of this sketch grew to manhood in the town of Walton, whither his parents had returned shortly after his birth. Soon after his graduation from the Walton High School he entered into mercantile business, and was subsequently employed as an agent for the American Express Company, running between Oswego and New York. From his boyhood, however, he had intended to become a physician, and, with this end in view, entered the office of Dr. J. H. Keeney, of Oswego, N. Y., with whom he read medicine, going thence to the New York Homeopathic Medical College, from which he was graduated with the class of 1892. The subsequent year Dr. St. John was one of the staff of the Hahnemann Hospital. After spending some time in private practice in New York City, the Doctor located in Walton, opening his office here in April, 1893, and since that time has been in the receipt of a substantial practice. He is a close and thoughtful student, devoted to the interests of his patients, and is held in high respect both as a man and as a practitioner. He has more than an average share of the patronage of the best people of the community, and his prospects for winning a position among the leading physicians and surgeons of this part of Delaware County are exceedingly good.\n\nThe marriage of Dr. St. John and Miss Belle M. Snow, a daughter of Garrett Snow, was solemnized at Caroline Centre, Tompkins County, in 1876; and the young couple began their wedded life in Walton, which is the natal place of their only child, Nellietta, who was born in 1877.\n\nCARL HERMANN is one of the leading cottagers in the charming rural resort known as Fleischmanns, situated in the mountainous uplands of Delaware County, the summer residence of a small number of select families well known in metropolitan life. Some years ago several members of the Fleischmann family, in search of rural quiet and picturesque scenery, visited this retired neighborhood, and, charmed with its pure air CAN'T READ altitudes, and care-banishing influences, resolved that their first visit should by no means be their last. Accordingly, about 1882, Mr. and Mrs. Louis Fleischmann and Mr. and Mrs. Leopold Bleier came to the locality, and purchased a part of the old farm then owned by John M. Blish, building pleasant summer cottages, well adapted to the requirements of health and pleasure seekers. They were soon joined by others, among them Charles Fleischmann, Carl Edelheim, Mrs. Max Fleischmann, Anton Seidl, Louis Josephthal, and Carl Hermann. Bernard Ullman and Henry Mierlander added to the architectural beauties of the place by establishing spacious and picturesque homes on the mountain side, Mr. Charles Fleischmann building three more large and tasteful dwellings.\n\nThe grounds surrounding these attractive residences are exquisitely laid out, teeming with flowers and shrubbery, and broken here and there with convenient walks and well-graded carriage drives. A large deer park, in which ramble at will some choice specimens of their kind, adds greatly to the interest of the landscape. Swimming Pond, supplied with pure mountain spring water, is a convenience that has not been forgotten; neither have commodious stables and carriage houses. Another most interesting and luxurious feature of this realm of pleasance is a fine riding-school in a magnificently equipped hall, with a commodious gallery, in which the friends of the riders can sit and watch their graceful evolutions. There are costly paintings on the walls, which are elsewhere tastefully draped with rich bunting; and four large chandeliers provide brilliant illumination for evening pleasures. A portable floor has also been provided for dancing, and an orchestra of skilled musicians from New York is kept in good practice throughout the season. The railroad station, a tasteful structure, erected by the liberality of the Fleischmanns, invites the attention of the passing traveller. The surrounding grounds attest the work of an artist in landscape gardening.\n\nThis charming spot, whose natural beauties have been so enhanced by a boundless liberality, directed by cultivated taste, is yet but in embryo. The plans for the future are well calculated to dwarf the achievements of the past; and in the choice and secluded settlement of \"Fleischmanns,\" nestling in the shadow of the romantic Catskills, redolent of health, innocent gaiety, and cultured ease, we may view a place where sordid cares are excluded and the rude turmoil of life's battle stilled, its faint echoes only touching the chord of remembrance, as the reverberations of the swift express, with its varied freight of human interests, hopes, and passions, break softly on the air and lose themselves in the rural solitudes.\n\nSAMUEL W. NILES, a retired farmer of Sidney, was born in that town, August 23, 1816, and is the son of Joseph and Sally (Barstow) Niles. His grandfather, Ambrose Niles, a native of Connecticut, was a veteran of the War of the Revolution, and was drafted in the War of 1812, but hired a substitute. He came to Delaware County in 1810 with his wife and two children, and, settling in the town of Sidney, took up a lot of land consisting of about one hundred and seventy-seven acres, upon which he built a log house, and later built the second frame barn that was erected in that part of the town.\n\nJoseph Niles, son of Ambrose, was born in Connecticut, and taught school in that State before coming to Delaware County with his father when a young man. He here followed the occupation of a farmer, and filled several local offices, being Justice of the Peace for some years, well known as \"Squire Niles,\" holding his court in an old log house, many of the lawyers coming to court on horseback, with their clients behind them. He and his wife were the parents of the following children: Samuel W., the subject of this sketch; Clarinda, wife of Addison Nowland, of Chicago, Ill.; Lucina, who became the wife of Joseph Miller, and died at the age of fifty-six; Mary, wife of Norval Barstow; Celinda, wife of Cyrenus Schofield; Sarah, wife of Henry Fletcher; and Hubbard Niles, who died aged eight-one. Joseph Niles died in 1850, aged seventy-one, his wife surviving him thirty years.\n\nSamuel W. Niles was reared on the old farm, a short distance from where Sidney Centre now stands, receiving his education at the district school, which was on the farm, Gardner Olmstead being his first teacher. The school-house was of logs, and heated by fireplaces, the seats being made of slabs with pegs put in for legs. Mr. Niles had but a meagre chance of attending school, as most of his time was given to work on the farm. He remained at home until he was twenty-one, when he hired himself out to his father, receiving one hundred and twenty dollars a year and his clothes and board. He was twenty-five when he bought a farm in Otsego County, on which he lived about four years, and then sold it and moved back to the old farm, purchasing that after his father's death. In 1874 he moved to his present residence at Sidney Centre.\n\nMr. Niles was married October 22, 1840, to Susan C. Mack, who was born January 20, 1820, at Harpersfield, a daughter of Abner Mack, one of the early settlers of Delaware County. By this union Mr. Niles had four children - Sarah, Edson, George B., and Charles. Sarah, born December 12, 1850, is the wife of Frederick Shaw, of Binghamton. Edson Niles, born September 10, 1854, one of the leading merchants in Sidney Centre, married in 1880 Addie M. Baker, who died in 1888, leaving two children - Ethel May and Robert. Mr. Edson Niles married in 1890 Miss Cora A. Travis, by whom he has also two children - Susan E. and Harry. George B. Niles was born September 4, 1846, and died June 2, 1877. Charles Niles, born April 16, 1844, died December 23, 1888. Mrs. Susan C. Niles died August 25, 1884. On January 13, 1886, Mr. Niles married for his second wife Mrs. Sally Davis, a daughter of Israel and Susanna Kneeland. Her father was a native of Delaware County, and was a wheelwright by trade; but the latter years of his life were devoted to farming. He died at the early age of forty years, his wife, a native of Chenango County, surviving him thirty-four years, dying at the age of seventy-four. They had four children, two of whom are now living - Mrs. Niles and Mrs. Louisa Davis, the latter living in Masonville. Her mother having been twice married, Mrs. Niles has also a half-brother, Austin L. Welch, who resides in Texas.\n\nMrs. Niles is a member of the Baptist church, and her husband is a Congregationalist. In politics he is a strong advocate of the Prohibition party. He has been Assessor and Inspector of Elections, besides holding several other public offices, all of which he has filled most acceptably. Mr. Niles bears a high reputation for honesty and integrity, and both in private and public life has always retained the respect and esteem of his fellows. An excellent portrait of this representative citizen of Delaware County maybe seen on another page of the \"Review.\"\n\nJOHN BECKWITH, a retired farmer, owning and occupying a pleasant home at DeLancey Station, was reared to agricultural pursuits, and has followed this calling with more than average success. His present possessions are the result of his own industry, while his integrity and honesty have served to establish him in the confidence and esteem of his fellow-men. He is a native of this great commonwealth, having been born in Ulster County in 1829.\n\nJoseph Beckwith, the father of the subject of this sketch, was born in Newbern, N. C., in 1801, and at the age of sixteen removed to this State, becoming a resident of Ulster County. He was left an orphan, without means, when quite young, and consequently was obliged to seek his own living. He worked out by the month at farm labor for several years, and by steady industry and strict economy saved some money. With this to start upon, he wedded the lady of his choice, Anna Ostrander, a native of Ulster County, their nuptials being celebrated in 1826. In 1839, accompanied by his wife and four children, he came to this county, settling in the town of Andes, where he purchased a farm, on which he afterward lived and labored until his death in 1865. He was a man of enterprise and energy, meeting with prosperity in his farming operations, and leaving his family a good estate. His widow survived him several years, living to the ripe old age of ninety years. Both were devout members of the United Presbyterian Church, and highly esteemed members of the community where they had for so many years made their home. The record of the children born to them is as follows: Maria, who is the widow of John Fowler; John, of whom we write; Margaret, who died in the prime of life; Cornelius, a carpenter, who lives in Ulster County.\n\nJohn Beckwith was the second child of the parental household. He was reared on the farm, attended the district schools, and assisted his father until his marriage. He then became a farmer on his own account, carrying on his labors in such a thorough and skilful manner that his farm property in the town of Andes was among the finest, in regard to improvements and cultivation, of any in the vicinity. This farm Mr. Beckwith recently sold for three thousand dollars, and invested one thousand six hundred dollars of this money in his present home in DeLancey. It contains an acre of land, sufficient to keep a cow and a horse, and requiring just enough care and labor to keep him healthy and happy; and, with two daughters to keep house for him, he is living in comfort and ease.\n\nOn the 1st of January, 1857, Mr. Beckwith married Elizabeth Nichols, who was born in Scotland in 1827. Her parents, Andrew and Margaret (George) Nichols, were farmers by occupation, and emigrated to this country with their family in 1839. Mrs. Beckwith was endowed with true Scotch habits of industry and thrift, and proved herself a most admirable wife and companion. She passed from earth to the spirit world, January 23, 1893, leaving her devoted husband and seven children to mourn their loss. Of this family, to whom she was ever a wise counsellor and a loving mother, we record the following: Anna M., a successful teacher, lives at home. Hattie M., the wife of A. R. Worden, a farmer of Andes, has four children. Joseph, an insurance and real estate dealer in Walton, has had the misfortune to break one of his legs three times; but, notwithstanding the fact that he is lame, and not in particularly good health, he is managing a very successful business. David A., a resident of Iowa, where he is in the employ of a railway company, is married and has a son and daughter. Cornelius, a carpenter, lives in Missouri. Jane lives at home. William, also a carpenter, is in Missouri with his brother Cornelius, where both are working prosperously at their trade.\n\nMr. Beckwith is a sound Republican in his political views. The United Presbyterian church finds in him a consistent member.\n\nARTHUR J. GANOUNG, a substantial citizen of his native town, Roxbury, where he was born February 2, 1864, is of French descent and patriotic ancestry. His paternal grandfather, James Ganoung, who was born in Putnam County, New York, came to Butternuts in Delaware County while in the first vigor of manhood. Here he tried to settle, and clear up a tract of land that was, like a great deal of the surrounding country, almost a wilderness. But the Tories, who were jealous of the prosperity and increasing strength of the rebel element, drove him from his humble and toil-worn home; and the young pioneer returned to Putnam County. Both he and his brother John served in the Revolutionary War as minute-men.\n\nAfter the war the two brothers were offered a tract of two hundred acres of land at Batavia Kill, as an incentive to settle there and farm the wild and uncultivated land of that section. This offer was accepted; and the brothers had soon erected a log cabin, and were making brave efforts to establish a home, though the danger from the wild animals of the forest, the discomforts of the necessarily primitive mode of existence, the long winters, and extreme isolation made the life very hard, almost impossible. Here James Ganoung met and married Miss Deborah Jenkins, the daughter of one of the early settlers; and here they lived the first years of their married life. As old age approached, they considered it wise to change their location; so the farm was sold, and a new home was established in Roxbury. They became the parents of eight children; namely, Jason, Isaac, Arion, Smith, Abraham, Charles, Rachel, and Polly.\n\nArion, the third son of James and Deborah Ganoung, was educated at the district school. At the age of twenty-six he bought a farm, owned now by Holsight. He was married in the following year to Priscilla Redmond, daughter of John and Martha (Powell) Redmond. Her father, who lived on a farm near Griffin's Corners, was a member of the Baptist church, and was a loyal Democrat throughout the varying vicissitudes of his life of eighty years. Arion Ganoung was also a Democrat in politics. He had the confidence of the community, and held the office of Assessor in the town of Roxbury.\n\nArthur J. Ganoung, son of Arion and Priscilla, was educated at Roxbury College, and at eighteen made himself a master of telegraphy, which he followed as a vocation for several years in different places, returning in September, 1890, to Roxbury, where he has since been employed as freight and express agent. His home is near the railway station. Mr. Ganoung married Libbie Richtmeyer, daughter of Jacob Richtmeyer, a carpenter and contractor of Middletown. Mrs. Ganoung is a member of the Lutheran church. Like his father, Mr. Ganoung affiliates with the Democratic party.\n\nJOHN KLING, agent and manager of the branch dry-goods store of Frank Barclay, of Amsterdam, N. Y., is a wide-awake, energetic business man, and, although young in years, has already obtained a good start in life, and is numbered among the rising young men of the village of Walton. He comes of excellent Holland ancestry, and was born in the town of Perth, Fulton County, N. Y., April 8, 1869, being a son of Peter A. and Phyllis Ann (Banker) Kling, the former a well-known contractor and builder of Amsterdam. The parents are both members of the Baptist church, and politically Mr. Kling casts his vote with the Republican party.\n\nThe subject of this brief biographical record received the elements of a good education in the Union School at Amsterdam, and, being remarkably ambitious and industrious, secured employment as a clerk in a dry-goods store, thus spending his evenings and vacations from the time he was seventeen years old until nineteen years of age. He has since then continued his mercantile career, and during the past two years has been employed by Frank Barclay, as before mentioned. In January, 1894, Mr. Kling opened the branch store in Walton, and in this new enterprise has met with encouraging success, his honorable and upright dealings, his fidelity to the interests of his employers, and his genial and courteous manners securing for him a good patronage.\n\nApril 28, 1892, Mr. Kling was united in the holy bonds of matrimony with Miss Jennie Cramer, of Amsterdam, a daughter of William and Emma (McConnell) Cramer. On the maternal side Mrs. Kling is of Scotch extraction, her grandparents having been born, reared, and married in Scotland. They afterward emigrated to this country, stopping awhile in Albany, and going thence to Canada, where the grandfather engaged in the mercantile trade as a tobacconist. In Canada, near the town of Coburg, occurred the birth of their daughter Emma, the mother of Mrs. Kling. On the paternal side Mrs. Kling is of German descent, her great-grandfather having been a native of Germany, and her grandfather, Henry Cramer, a native of the Empire State. Her parents are esteemed residents of Amsterdam, where they are living retired from active labor. They have a family of three children: William H., who is engaged in the grocery business, lives in Amsterdam; Emma, who is an able instructor in the public schools; Jennie, Mrs. Kling, who has engaged in the millinery business for some years, and since coming to Walton has continued her occupation, her millinery parlors being in the store with her husband. She has a well-supplied stock, and displays much artistic ability, her talent being recognized by her large number of patrons.\n\nIn religious matters Mr. and Mrs. Kling are not entirely of one mind, he being a member of the Baptist church, in which faith he was reared, while Mrs. Kling worships at the Presbyterian church, of which she is a valued member.\n\nJEROME WHIPPLE, a successful farmer, and dairyman of Kortright, Delaware County, of which town he has long been a prominent citizen, was born in Roxbury, March 17, 1853. His grandfather, Abram Whipple, was a native of Vermont, where he followed the trade of blacksmith. He was a pioneer of Roxbury, Delaware County, and there resided until his death, which took place when he was eighty years old. He was a liberal-minded man, a Republican, and was the father of seven children.\n\nHis son Daniel, the father of the subject of this sketch, was born in Vermont, but grew to manhood in the town of Roxbury, where he engaged in farming. In 1865, disposing of his farm of one hundred acres there, he removed to Kortright, and purchased the farm of three hundred and twenty-two acres which is now occupied by his son Jerome. Daniel Whipple was a hard worker and progressive farmer, and resided on the farm at Kortright until his death, at eighty-seven years of age, his wife, Maria Chamberlin Whipple, dying at the age of sixty-five years. He was a Republican in politics, and both he and his wife were devoted members of the Methodist Episcopal church. They were the parents of eight children, all of whom are living: Mrs. Jane Nesbitt, of Stamford; Jerome; Mrs. Emma Goodsell, of Meredith; George, living at RoseÃs Brook; Mrs. Anna Lamport, of Stamford; Abram, of Fergusonville, Delaware County; Libbie, who lives at home; and Mrs. Sarah Nesbitt, of Fergusonville.\n\nJerome Whipple removed to Kortright with his parents when but twelve years old, and, after receiving the education afforded by the district school, gave his attention to farming, always living at home, were he took charge of the farm, and ministered to his parents in their old age. On December 5, 1888, he married Miss Mary Mehaffy, a native of Kortright, and daughter of Benjamin and Mary E. (Storie) Mehaffy, the former of whom is a farmer, now residing in Iowa. The latter died in the prime of life. Mr. and Mrs. Whipple have one child, Blanche M., who was born March 22, 1890.\n\nJust before his marriage Mr. Whipple purchased the old homestead consisting of three hundred and twenty-two acres, and now has under his control four hundred and ninety-five acres, part of which he rents. His farm is under excellent cultivation, and the dairy is a very extensive and productive one, comprising sixty-five milch cows of finest Jersey breed. Mr. Whipple has in all one hundred head of stock, employing two men throughout the year. His home is a most comfortable one, situated in the Delaware River Valley among the Catskill Mountains. The family attend the United Presbyterian church. Mr. Whipple is a stanch Republican. He is an industrious man, with remarkable business qualifications, and is eminently successful in whatever enterprises he undertakes.\n\nVICTOR FINCH, a prominent citizen of Tompkins, Delaware County, N.Y., was born September 12, 1820, in Lexington, Greene County. The ancestors of Mr. Finch came from Holland to American with the early settlers of this country, and the family has been known in its history since that time.\n\nAmos Finch, father of Victor, was born in Lexington in 1794, and died in 1868. After engaging in farming, in his native town for many years, he disposed of his property there, and purchased a farm in Maryland, Otsego County, where he lived for some time, subsequently removing to a farm that he bought in Tompkins. After the death of his wife, his eyesight failed; and he gave his property to his sons, passing his last days at the home of his son Victor, where he died November 16, 1868, a the age of seventy-four years. He was buried in the cemetery at Trout Creek. His wife, was Polly Merwin, also a native of Lexington; and she was the mother of six children Ã Lura, Victor, Samuel, Emmeline, Debias, and Wilson. Mrs. Polly M. Finch was herself the eldest of a family of fourteen children, of whom her brother, David Merwin, of Hensonville, now in his seventy-ninth year, is the only survivor. His earliest ancestors in this country came from Wales. His paternal grandfather, his father, and his uncle, Daniel Merwin, came to New York from Wallingford, Conn., soon after the Revolution, crossing the Hudson on a raft of their own construction, and traveling thirty miles, mostly by blazed trees, through a howling wilderness. They took up a tract of land in Greene County, where the father of Mrs. Finch cleared a small piece of land, sowed it with wheat, built a log house, and then went back to Connecticut, and married Thankful Parker, who returned with him to the new home, where the children were born.\n\nVictor Finch passed his boyhood in Tompkins, attending the district school, and helping with the farm work. When seventeen he went to work for a Mr. Palmer, learning the carpenterÃs trade, and at twenty-one started out in life for himself, engaging in lumbering and farming. When he was thirty-five years of age, he purchased a farm in Manchester, Wayne County, Pa., where for fourteen years he engaged extensively in his old occupation of farming and lumbering. Selling his property there, he purchased in 1856 the farm where he now resides, comprising one hundred and eight-six acres. Besides raising crops and making maple sugar, he also operates a large dairy, keeping forty-five cows, doing much of the work of the place himself. He is strong and hearty, was never known to be ill in all his life, and although seventy-four years of age, is as active and energetic as when much younger.\n\nJanuary 30, 1855, Mr. Finch married Sarah E. Taylor, daughter of James and Clementina (Harse) Taylor. Both of Mrs. FinchÃs parents were born in Winford, Somersetshire, England, where they were married, four children being born in England, two of whom died in that country. In 1828 they sailed for America with their two children in the ship ÃCosmo,Ã the voyage occupying sixteen weeks and four days. The passage was an unusually rough one, the good ship being twice blown off the coast; but, after much suffering and narrow escape from shipwreck, --the family reached New York City and settled on a small farm where Jersey City is now situated. For three years they lived there, and then moved to Honesdale, Pa., which contained at that time but one log house. The journey from the old home in Honesdale was made on foot with the children on their backs, a man driving an ox team containing all their worldly goods. The country to which they immigrated was a barren wilderness, abounding in wild animals, and was not particularly pleasing to Mr. Taylor. He accordingly removed to a tract called the French Woods, in Delaware County, N.Y., and here erected a bark cabin, in which he lived until able to build a log house. He proceeded to clear land on what is now called the Rolland farm, near Sand Pond, which is one of the largest in French Woods. Several years later he sold this property, and went to Bouchonville in the same county, where he carried on a hotel, which he afterward sold to purchase a farm in Manchester, Wayne County, Pa. Ten years later he disposed of this, and bought a farm near Lordville, Delaware County, consisting of one hundred and three acres; and here he lived until his death, which occurred January 14, 1871, the result of injuries received by being struck by the cars near his home. His wife died one year later, in 1872, and they sleep side by side in the cemetery at Lordville.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Taylor were the parents of ten children: John and Michael, born in England; Mary Ann, Nathaniel, Sarah E., Henry, and William, born in French Woods; Bessie, born in Bouchonville; and two others, who died in England. In 1848 Mr. Taylor again crossed the ocean, the death of his father, without a will, making his presence necessary in the settlement of the property. The passage over occupied three weeks; and the return trip, being very stormy, occupied seventeen weeks, both voyages being made in the ship ÃRappahannock,Ã of Liverpool. Mr. Taylor being the eldest son, and his father a wealthy farmer, his portion of the estate amounted to a comfortable fortune. His daughter, Mrs. Finch, was born July 14, 1837, in French Woods, and passed the early part of her life in Lordville, attending the district school, and residing with her parents until her marriage.\n\nMr. and Mrs.. Finch are the parents of three children; Alva Wilson, born October 16, 1856; William L., born May 4, 1860; Elmer E., born February 6, 1863. All are natives of Manchester, Wayne County, Pa., and attended the district school on Knickerbocker Hill, assisting their parents on the home farm. The son, A. Wilson, married Susan Brown of Tompkins; and they have one child, Ava, born January 30, 1891. William L. finch died July 19, 1862, at the age of two years; and Elmer works on the old home farm with his father and brother. Mr. Finch is profoundly respected for his upright character and honorable dealings.\n\nPROFESSOR WILLIS D. GRAVES. Delaware Academy, located in Delhi, is fortunate in having for its principal Willis D. Graves, a man of liberal culture and great executive ability. Under his wise regime of the past ten years the number of students has increased, the standard of scholarship greatly advanced, and many beneficial changes and improvements been made. Delaware Academy since its inception has been regarded as the leading institution of its kind in this section of the State, and its high reputation and usefulness as a classical institute grow steadily from year to year. It was established in pursuance of an act of the legislature passed April 12, 1819, which appropriated six thousand dollars, the proceeds of a Tory estate, for the purpose of establishing an academy in Delaware county. The academy was incorporated by the regents of the university, February 12, 1820; and the first building was erected upon lands given by General Erastus Root, who had been instrumental in obtaining the appropriation. Judge Ebenezer Foote was President of the first Board of Trustees, Colonel Amasa Parker the first Secretary, and John A. Savage the first Principal of the academy.\n\nFrom the start this school had a successful career; and having outgrown its accommodations in 1856 a new academy and two boarding halls were built. Recently the boarding department has been enlarged, but is yet too small to accommodate all applicants. In 1893 the number of students registered reached two hundred and twenty-three, and the representation of the school greatly extended, the non-resident attendance numbering one hundred and twenty-six. No other academic school in this section of the State approaches such an attendance of pupils from a distance, and few similar schools in the entire State of New York report such a non-resident attendance. During the past decade over ten thousand dollars has been expended in beautifying the grounds and in adding to the comfort and equipment of the buildings. Among the valuable accessories of the school is a library of two thousand volumes, an extensive collection of apparatus, a thoroughly furnished gymnasium, and every convenience for efficient work. The work of the school is mostly academic, although both a preparatory and primary department are sustained. The regentsÃ courses of study, the only recognized courses for graduation, are liberal and progressive, fitting the students in the most thorough manner for Princeton, Yale, Vassar and other colleges, and for life work.\n\nThe faculty of this academy consists of a corps of thorough educators, who devote their entire attention to the best interests of this school. Under their tuition students who have matriculated at various colleges have become distinguished scholars. One of the students of the academy recently won a three yearsÃ fellowship at Yale college, and received the degree of Ph.D. at the age of twenty-one years. Another obtained the Mental Science fellowship of six hundred dollars at Princeton College. One is instructor of Latin in the Hartford High School and another holds the chair of Oratory in Cornell University. Reports have come back from the following-named colleges wherein Delhi Academy students have distinguished themselves, testifying to the thorough preparation received in this school: Yale, Cornell, Princeton, Vassar, Wellesley, Hamilton, Middlebury, Westminster, and Elmira Female College, besides from the law, medical, and normal schools of the State. Aside from the academic course, Professor Graves has maintained a kindergarten course, in which about twenty children are taught; and a practical course in book-keeping is included within the regular course. Special courses are given in music, drawing, and painting, these special studies being under the supervision of thorough and accomplished instructors.\n\nProfessor Graves is a native of the Empire State, having been born in Bainbridge, Chenango County, August 18, 1856, the eldest of four children born to Gaylord S. and Harriet E. (Pettys) Graves. His father was a successful business man who, having amassed a competence during forty years in which he was engaged in the furniture business, is now enjoying well-earned leisure from the active pursuits of life. Professor Graves as a boy was an ambitious student, and after leaving the public school, attended the academies of Afton and Bainbridge. He subsequently spent four years as a teacher in the schools of Chenango and Broome Counties, afterward taking a full course of study at the normal school in Albany, from which he was graduated in 1879. In August of the same year he accepted the principalship of the Bainbridge Union School and Academy, a position which he retained six years, winning in the mean time a reputation as an instructor of rare ability and merit. In 1885 he leased the Delaware Academy at Delhi, which under his efficient administration occupies a front rank among similar institutions of the kind in the State.\n\nProfessor Graves was united in marriage in 1880 to Miss Elizabeth M. Rexford, an accomplished young woman of superior mental attainments, who was graduated from Vassar College with the class of 1877, receiving the degree of A.B. She is a member of the faculty of the academy, being the instructor in Latin and German. Professor and Mrs. Graves are both members of the Second Presbyterian church, and active laborers in denominational work.\n\nEZRA H. HAIT, an estimable citizen of Stamford, N.Y., was born in this town on Rose Brook, December 26, 1823, son of Stephen and Betsy (Lyon) Hait. Stephen Hait was born in South Kortright in the town of Stamford, and his wife was born on Rose Brook in the same town. His father, Ezra Hait, who was born in Connecticut, in 1790 moved to this county, and settled in Stamford in the Delaware River Valley. He bought a tract of wild land, built a log cabin, and then, returning to his native State, was there married. As soon as practicable he took his wife to their new home. The journey was made on horseback, which was then about the only way of travelling; and a hard and somewhat perilous trip it must have been, for wild animals, which are now seldom found, then abounded in the country.\n\nCatskill was the main market for the wheat crop, and four days were consumed in going thither and coming back. The grist had to be taken to Schoharie to be ground. It must have required great courage and fortitude to live under these discouraging conditions. To be sure, deer, bears, and smaller game abounded in the forests, but so did prowling panthers and wolves; and, had not the pioneers been men and women of dauntless daring as well as sturdy workers, their hearts must have failed them.

He was one of the well-to-do men of the town, and was a Presbyterian in religious views. He died on the old homestead, March 11, 1849, at eighty-nine years of age, his wife, April 16, 1839, when sixty-three years of age. They had five children, all of whom grew to maturity; but none are now living. Their names were Lydia, Betsey, Patty, Stephen, and Daniel.\n\nStephen Hait, the elder of the two sons "
