        "text": "Town in Delaware, United States\n\nBridgeville is a town in Sussex County, Delaware, United States. According to the 2020 census, the population is 2,568.[4] It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town of Bridgeville is the oldest community in western Sussex County. Records of land transactions which were made in the first quarter of the 18th century suggest that a significant agricultural community already existed in the area by that period. A small group of houses had been built along the present Main Street by the turn of the 19th century; this settlement was known as \"Bridge Branch\" for the nearby stream, which was crossed by a bridge as early as 1730. By 1804, the community had grown sufficiently to merit the establishment of a post office.\n\nThe village was formally recognized in 1810, when an Act of the Assembly was passed to establish its name as \"Bridgeville\". Early 19th century industries included a water-powered mill, tanyard, charcoal furnace, and fruit-drying business. The growth of the town accelerated greatly upon the arrival of the Delaware Railroad in Bridgeville in 1856. The town was subsequently laid out for development by William Cannon (1809-1865).[5]\n\nBridgeville's population was 613 in 1900.[6]\n\nBridgeville was named for a bridge that was built in 1730 that was located over a tributary of the Nanticoke River.[7]\n\nThe Bridgeville Historic District, Bridgeville Public Library, Eratt House, Old Bridgeville Fire House, Ricards House-Linden Hall, Scott's Store, Sudler House, and Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[8]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nRoads are the main means of transport to and from Bridgeville. U.S. Route 13 (Sussex Highway) is the primary north-south highway serving the town, connecting northward to Dover and southward to Salisbury.\n\nDelaware Route 404 is the main east-west highway serving Bridgeville, heading east towards Georgetown and west towards Maryland. The two roads are concurrent for part of their route through Bridgeville as they both bypass the center of town to the north and east. U.S. Route 13 Business and Delaware Route 404 Business follow their respective original alignments through the center of town.\n\nDART First State operates the Route 212 bus that connects Bridgeville with Delmar and Georgetown.[9] The Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line passes north-south through Bridgeville.[10]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nBridgeville is located at (38.7426137, –75.6043714).[11]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.8 square miles (2.1 km2), all of which is land.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1860250—187030020.0%188039832.7%189057644.7%19006136.4%191093953.2%19209450.6%19309874.4%19401,18019.6%19501,46824.4%19601,4690.1%19701,317−10.3%19801,238−6.0%19901,210−2.3%20001,43618.7%20102,04842.6%20202,56825.4%\n\nAt the 2000 census, there were 1,436 people, 570 households, and 381 families living in the town.
