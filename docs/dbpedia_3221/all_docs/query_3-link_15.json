It is a tiny little town that was settled as early as 1684 as Attawattacoquin, on a piece of land given from Charles Calvert the third, Lord Baron of Baltimore. Before the town received it's final name of Bridgeville in 1871, it was also known as Bridge Branch. The town itself was incorporated in 1938 and is now a growing community filled with rich history, east coast beauty and friendly people.\n\nThere is no light like the amber light of the Autumn season.
