        "text": "Mary V. Liberi passed away peacefully on Monday, August 1, 2016 surrounded by family in the comfort of her home.\n\nAfter 32 years living in Florida, Mary moved back to Delaware 4 years ago to be closer to her family and loved ones. Family truly meant the world to Mary and she loved them deeply. She always looked forward to everyone getting together, and especially loved weddings. She was as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her loving husband, Quin Liberi. Even though Mary was a native of Florida and Quin a native of Pennsylvania, they made a life in Wilmington before moving to Florida in 1980.\n\nShe is survived by her son, Bruce of Bridgeville, DE; her brother, William of Georgetown, DE; her sister, Shelby of Wilmington, DE; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nA viewing will be held at the Chapel of Gracelawn Memorial Park, 2220 N. DuPont Highway, New Castle on Tuesday, August 9 from 1:30-2:00PM. The funeral ceremony will immediately follow."
