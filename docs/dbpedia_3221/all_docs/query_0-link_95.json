        "text": "was free-born, property-owning, and engaged in the oystering business. Like Sadie's father, George's father had become a Methodist minister and had moved his family to Delaware. The couple soon settled in Bridgeville, Sussex County, Delaware's southernmost county which adjoins Somerset County, Maryland. By 1900, both were teaching in Sussex County African American schools. By 1900, too, George had become active in Republican Party politics, taking on a commitment that would grow over time. (Delaware's 1897 state constitution included provisions that effectively ended the disfranchisement of African American men.)\n\nWhile living and teaching in Sussex County, Sadie Waters immersed herself in church work, a local \"Number 2 Union\" of the (segregated) Delaware Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and the Delaware Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. In 1917, she gave a series of temperance lectures in New Castle County under WCTU auspices. She was a regular speaker at WCTU state conventions and in 1918 gave a talk on \"Prohibition a Necessity in the National Government of America\" at a temperance rally on the campus of Delaware College for Colored Students (now Delaware State University). During the Great War, she received kudos for \"spreading the gospel of saving wheat, meat, and sugar\" among Sussex County residents, and in 1919, after the Delaware General Assembly had passed a sweeping overhaul of the state's school code, one that vastly increased resources for African American schools, she and George led community meetings at the Bridgeville African Methodist Episcopal Church and at her school in Greenwood to show support for the code and for its philanthropic benefactor, Pierre S. du Pont. A letter that she and two others signed expressed \"gratitude and appreciation\" to du Pont for his efforts on behalf of \"the Negro children of today and tomorrow.\"\n\nThrough such activities, Sadie Waters encountered leading African American clubwomen, temperance supporters, and suffragists, as well as white allies. At temperance meetings at the Garrett Settlement House in Wilmington, she would have met Blanche W. Stubbs, the settlement house's executive director, who was also president of the Delaware State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, and a noted suffragist. When she gave a temperance speech at the black-owned National Theatre in Wilmington, suffragist Fannie Hopkins Hamilton, whose brother, John O. Hopkins, owned the theatre and was the city's only African American elected official, might have been in the audience. Similarly, at the State College in Dover and in her home county, her temperance and school-code advocacy brought contacts with like-minded women and men.\n\nWith the Nineteenth Amendment ratified in August, 1920, Sadie Waters turned her attention to rallying Sussex County's newly enfranchised African American women, encouraging them to register and then turn out to vote on Election Day. It was \"their duty to their country and to their race,\" she told them, to accept \"the privilege of citizenship now granted.\" Her commitment to \"votes for women\" went beyond the simple fairness of the thing to encompass a broad program of racial equity, including equalization of facilities, curricular offerings, and teacher salaries across the state's segregated schools, criminal justice reform, and state funding for institutions serving black communities. That commitment was clear in the work she completed during the post-suffrage years, using African American voters' electoral strength to press for changes in state policies toward black schools (including reform schools) as well as teacher salaries and pensions. As a member of the legislative committee of the Delaware State Colored Teachers' Association she had a presence in Dover, lobbying for educational justice.\n\nAs a trustee of the Industrial School for Colored Girls in Marshallton, a project of the Delaware Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, she helped shape the school's programs. In both endeavors, her colleagues included Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Delaware's well-known teacher, writer, suffragist, and advocate for racial justice.\n\nSadie and George Waters left Delaware in the late 1920s, moving to Coatesville, Chester County, Pennsylvania, where Sadie taught science and home economics at the James Adams School and eventually became its principal. During the Depression years, she was admired in the community for providing school lunches to needy students. After George's death in 1938, she continued her teaching career until retiring in 1943. The same year, she remarried; her second husband, Adolphus Taylor, died in 1952. Sadie Waters Taylor died on September 5, 1971 in the Chester County Home for the Aged. She was buried at the Mount Calvary Cemetery in Bridgeville, Delaware, alongside George Waters and Adolphus Taylor.\n\nSources:\n\nBiographical details on Sadie Monroe Waters and the Monroe, Wilson, and Waters families can be traced through decennial censuses, genealogical records, and city directories available through Ancestry.comand educational compendia found on HathiTrust.org.
