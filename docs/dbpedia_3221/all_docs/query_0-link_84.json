        "text": "“Delaware is like a diamond,” downstate poet John Lofland wrote in 1847, “diminutive, but having within it inherent specific value.”1 Although ranking just forty-ninth in population, the Diamond State has had a long and colorful history that belies its size. Europeans settled here only a generation after Jamestown. It was one of the original thirteen colonies and the first state to sign the Constitution, a document that gives little states significant power.\n\nAdmittedly, its contributions to the architecture of the nation have been modest; as one measure, the National Park Service does not own a single site in Delaware, historical or otherwise, making it the only state thus neglected (although plans got underway in 2003 to change this). Great architecture is often a product of cities, and Delaware is preeminently a place without them: as late as World War II, there was not a single town besides Wilmington with a population of even 5,000. As a result, a great deal of Delaware's historic architecture is rural and vernacular. And because its important buildings almost invariably show the influence of neighboring states, Delaware is mostly a place to study architectural responses rather than bold innovations—responses that are often fascinating in their variety and imaginativeness.\n\nBecause of its frontage on Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, the chief geographical characteristic of the First State is lowness: it lies more wholly in the Coastal Plain (95 percent) than any other Eastern Seaboard state except Florida. Delaware's earliest settlers, the Dutch in 1631, must have felt at home as they explored its beautiful saltgrass marshes and sinuous tidal creeks. It was Delaware Bay that was first named for English Lord de la Warr, a name later applied to the entire western shore, today's state of Delaware. The latter forms part of the Delmarva Peninsula, all of which was economically oriented toward the Chesapeake and Delaware bays and away from the wooded central spine, still sparsely populated today. The western boundary of Delaware, almost ninety miles, passes through hardly a town of significant size.\n\nIn architecture as in much else, Delaware is delightfully obscure. Few outsiders know much about it, except for having driven through it on I-95 or visited one of its racetracks or beaches. Only one American in 362 is a Delawarean. The state has the fewest counties of any state, just three, compared to 254 in Texas. Even if Delaware were a city rather than a state, it would rank only twelfth-largest in the nation, behind San Jose and Detroit. With a population of 853,500 in 2006, it is hemmed in by much larger neighbors with vigorous architectural traditions: Maryland, with a population seven times larger; New Jersey, eleven times larger; and Pennsylvania, fifteen times larger. In the colonial period, in fact, Delaware belonged to Pennsylvania as the Three Lower Counties (it was given to William Penn by the Duke of York to provide his colony with better access to the sea), and northern Delaware's architecture has repeatedly been shaped by Pennsylvania trends and Philadelphia architects. For its part, Maryland claimed chunks of southern Delaware until the 1770s, a legacy of old land disputes between Penn and Lord Baltimore. As Delaware has an average width of only twenty miles, nearly the whole state is just a short drive from Maryland, making for considerable architectural influence from there, too, especially in the south.\n\nDelaware's relationship to North and South has long been ambiguous. It lies almost entirely south of the Mason-Dixon Line (established 1763–1768)—and at the same time east of it, that famous divider between American regions making a right-angle turn to define Delaware's western border. Delaware was a slave state, yet it did not secede. Quaker abolitionists ferried runaways along the Underground Railroad here, but the state legislature would not ratify the Thirteenth Amendment (outlawing slavery) until 1901! The marked internal division between northward-oriented New Castle County (with only a fifth of Delaware's land area, but today with nearly two-thirds of its population) and the more southern Kent and Sussex counties gives the state much of its sociological interest and architectural variety.\n\nDelaware's prominent, mid-Atlantic location has exposed it to many cultural influences, with a resulting diversity of architectural forms and building types. Take churches, for example: one sees Quaker meeting houses like Pennsylvania's (MC1), Methodist chapels like those on Maryland's Eastern Shore (KT30), and urban Italian-Catholic churches like those of Philadelphia (WL77). There are high-style Gothic Revival Episcopal edifices of stone with soaring towers (CH16), much plainer Presbyterian boxes (NK5), and rustic camp meetings (WS25). The diversity only increases with time, as recent years have brought a Hindu Temple (MC2) built by workers from India and old churches reconfigured for modern social outreach (WL42). One could cite similar variety in other building types. In spite of Delaware's small size—or perhaps because of it—the overlay of architectural cultures and trends here is surprisingly complex and exciting."
