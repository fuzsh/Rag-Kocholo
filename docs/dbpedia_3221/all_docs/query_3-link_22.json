        "text": "Growing up in Bridgeville, Delaware, has definitely altered my perspective of small-town living. Here in Bridgeville, my educational, economical, social and political standings. Here in Bridgeville, my whole life I have been limited to local amenities, which are very few, since Bridgville is such a small town. There isn’t even a high school specifically in my town, the only high school I was able to attend was Woodbridge, which is a combination of our towns students and the neighboring town’s students, since there is only a small amount of us. Although this is true, I still strived to access other materials that helped by educational journey, like programs and other courses I took additionally. I would like to go to college outside of the local area aswell, since I will ultimately receive better education and gain experience in other areas that aren’t as rural."
