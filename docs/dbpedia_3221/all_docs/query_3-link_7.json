        "text": "Each year during the second weekend of October Bridgeville plays host to the Apple Scrapple Festival. The Festival celebrates the local apples harvested nearby at T.S. Smith & Sons, and the scrapple from Rapa Scrapple, the large company in Bridgeville, which has been producing scrapple since 1926. This festival features over 250 crafters and vendors and has grown over the past two decades to become one of the largest in all of Sussex County.\n\nLooking for a way to get get involved in the community or meet new people? Active organizations in the community include Lion and Lioness clubs, Kiwanis, and the Bridgeville Historical Society.\n\nBridgeville is located about 30 miles from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and about the same distance to Dover, the Capital of Delaware, to the north. In fact, it’s an easy trip from Bridgeville to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, to Annapolis or Baltimore, north to Wilmington or Philadelphia and south to Salisbury, Maryland, or the coast of Virginia.\n\nWith tons of options to pick from (most with pretty affordable price tags), Bridgeville is an outstanding place to buy a home. In fact, it's been named one of the Best Places to Retire in Delaware!"
