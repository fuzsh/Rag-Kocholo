        "text": "Mr William “Bill” Franklin Allen of Cherryville passed away Friday, July 19, 2019, at home surrounded by his loved ones. Bill was born in Cleveland County on August 30, 1924 to Harry Hampton and Modelle Davis Allen. He graduated as class valedictorian of Cherryville High School. He graduated from the UNC- Chapel Hill School of Pharmacy and was a member of the MARCHING TARHEELS. Mr. Allen was also a veteran of the United States Navy. He was a longtime member of First Baptist Church, where he sang in the Adult Choir for over 70 years.\n\nBill was married to the love of his life, Marisel Devine Allen, and they lived a life of true love until her death in 1996. Bill was much loved by all who knew him, and that was about everyone in Cherryville. He spent his professional life as a pharmacist in his drugstores, greeting everyone with a smile and a good word. His grandchildren thought he was a famous man because everywhere they went everyone knew Dr. Bill.\n\nBill loved his church. His mother was the organist there and he began singing in the church choir when he was 12. Thus, began a lifelong love of singing the great songs of the church. He finally retired from the choir at age 85 after 73 years of singing and praising the Lord. He also served as a Sunday school teacher and a deacon throughout his life.\n\nBill loved his family with a heart that loved so big. He was adored in return. His sense of humor and generous spirit made him a favorite of each family member. His sweet smile would light up his face whenever he saw a loved one. He loved his family with his whole heart and they all loved him. But his first love was Jesus. As one of his grandchildren wrote after hearing of his death, “His faith in our Father was so sure and confident he made me ache for more of Jesus”. He lived out his faith every day, in everything that he said and in everything he did. It was all to the glory of the Lord, in Whose sweet arms he now rests.\n\nBill was preceded in death by his parents, his beloved wife, a sister Dorothy Anderson, and a brother Harry Allen. He is survived by his sister Shirlee Marazza, his brother-in-law Jim Anderson, and his sister-in-law Nancy Moss, daughter Jeannie (Dr. Doug) Metcalf of Winston Salem, a son Frank (Nancy) Allen, and a son Tommy (Renee) Allen both of Cherryville. He is also survived by 9 wonderful grandchildren. Molly (Dr Brad) Freidinger of Concord, Dr Sally (Dr John) Lambeth of Winston Salem, Kathryn (Brian) Baker of Burlington, Marcy (Patrick) McCauley of Charlotte, Leigh (Brian) Kiser, Franklin Allen, Mark Allen (Natasha) of Gastonia, Sara Grace Allen of Chapel Hill and Natalie (Zack) McNeely of Gastonia; and 13 special great grandchildren.\n\nHis family would also like to thank Hospice of Cleveland County and Carolina Care Center of Cherryville. The family would also like to thank special care givers: Doretha, Marcellette, Loraine, Leah, Kim, Nancy and Dr. Tom White for the loving care they gave to Bill.\n\nMr. Allen’s funeral will be held at 4:00 PM Sunday, July 21, 2019 at First Baptist Church with Rev. Dr. Vince Hefner officiating.\n\nInterment will follow at City Memorial Cemetery with full military honors conducted by Cherryville American Legion Post #100 Honor Guard.\n\nHis family will receive friend from 2:00 to 3:45 prior to his service in the COC at the church.\n\nMemorials may be made to First Baptist Church, 301 E. First St., Cherryville, NC 28021."
