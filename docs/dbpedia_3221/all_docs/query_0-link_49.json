        "text": "Molly Magarik\n\nMolly Magarik was sworn in as secretary of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) in July 2020. As secretary, she leads the principal agency charged with keeping Delawareans healthy, ensuring they get the health care they need in a fast-changing world, and providing children, families, and seniors with essential social services, including food benefits, disability-related services, and mental health and addiction treatment. She oversees one of the largest departments in Delaware’s government, with an annual budget of more than $2 billion.\n\nAs secretary, Molly chairs the Health Fund Advisory Council and is a member of the Delaware Health Care Commission, the State Employee Benefits Committee, and the Governor’s Family Services Cabinet Council. As part of her portfolio, Molly is leading strategic planning efforts, including realigning the organization with greater accountability, reimagining service delivery to improve the public’s experience, and recruiting the workforce for the future. Additionally, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Molly, along with the Division of Public Health, will continue to advise the governor’s office on the pandemic response, while ensuring that the department’s critical services continue to meet the needs of the public.\n\nFollowing her nomination by Governor John Carney, Molly was unanimously confirmed in June 2020 by the Delaware State Senate to be the state’s 14th secretary of DHSS.\n\nPreviously, Molly served as the deputy secretary for DHSS from February 2017 to July 2020, directing and managing key priorities for DHSS, including health care financing, payment and delivery system reform; budget administration and management; early childhood education; and the state’s COVID-19 response. She also served as the department’s chief strategy officer and developed and maintained critical partnerships with Delaware cabinet agency leaders, the legislature, the federal delegation, advocates, and health care system leadership throughout the state.\n\nBefore joining DHSS, Molly served as state director for then-Congressman John Carney and political director for Beau Biden’s campaign for attorney general. She also worked as a strategic advisor across nonprofits and government, including as executive director of the Delaware Democratic Party. She earned her bachelor’s in political science and women’s studies from the University of Delaware, and her master’s in health care delivery science from Dartmouth College. She and her husband, Josh, have two daughters and live in Middletown.\n\nThe Honorable Bethany Hall-Long, PhD, RN\n\nDr. Bethany Hall-Long has served as Delaware’s 26th lieutenant governor since 2017. As a member of the Democratic Party, she served in the Delaware House of Representatives from 2002 to 2008 and in the Delaware Senate from 2008 to 2017.\n\nBethany was born and raised in Sussex County on her family farm with her two older brothers. She graduated from Indian River High School, where she met her husband, Dana, who served in the U.S. Navy for nine years. Later, she earned a BSN from Thomas Jefferson University, an MSN from the Medical University of South Carolina, and a PhD in health policy and nursing administration from George Mason University.\n\nA lifelong nurse and research scientist, Bethany has dedicated her medical career to addressing health inequities and expanding treatment options and access for mental health care in Delaware. She has been nationally recognized for her research and community service record with at-risk groups such as pregnant teens, diabetics, the homeless, and people facing mental health challenges and substance use disorder.\n\nBethany also serves as the principal investigator of the Delaware Medical Reserve Corps (DMRC), where she helps lead the state’s response to public health emergencies. In the fall of 2020, Governor Carney appointed Bethany to co-chair the Pandemic Resurgence Advisory Committee (PRAC). Comprising over 50 Delaware leaders in both the private and public sectors, the PRAC was tasked with preparing a pandemic playbook that included a strategy focused on health, business, and equity to combat a potential resurgence of COVID-19 in Delaware.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Bethany led the effort to create the Behavioral Health Consortium to address the opioid epidemic and the substance use disorder and mental health challenges facing Delawareans. As chair, she convenes parents, teachers, law enforcement, health care professionals, lawmakers, and community members who have been impacted by mental health and addiction, to expand access to treatment and care. She believes that no one’s access to health care should be determined by their ZIP code. Her efforts have helped bring substantive and effective change in stemming the opioid crisis and creating a behavioral health system that works for everyone in Delaware.\n\nIn 2018, Governor Carney tapped Bethany to chair the Governor’s Complete Count Commission. She convened leaders from all over Delaware to make sure everyone was included in the census, including those hardest to count. Bethany believes that community engagement is the key to successful leadership. That is why, at the onset of the pandemic, she started monthly calls with community leaders from across the state to ensure equity and awareness in state services.\n\nBethany is currently a professor of nursing and joint faculty in urban affairs at the University of Delaware. Her unique blend of experience in academic research and public service has allowed her to be the leading voice in ensuring that we create a stronger, healthier Delaware. Committed to training and teaching the next generation, Bethany is the national co-chair of Million Women Mentors. Her work, research, and accomplishments focus on finding real solutions to vexing social problems. She uses her skills and unmatched experience to bring people together, build consensus, and help find common-sense solutions to issues facing Delaware families and communities.\n\nGovernor John Carney\n\nBorn in Wilmington and raised in Claymont, Governor John Carney has been working for the people of Delaware for more than 30 years. He took office as Delaware’s 74th governor in January 2017, focused on making Delaware’s economy more competitive, preparing Delaware’s children to succeed, and building a long-term sustainable financial plan for the state of Delaware. Working with Delawareans across the state and with members of the General Assembly, he has made progress on each of those priorities. Governor Carney has directed new resources to high-needs schools; partnered with the private sector to drive new job creation; and taken steps to lower health care costs for Delaware families, businesses, and taxpayers.\n\nGovernor Carney began his second term as governor in January 2021. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, he has attempted to balance the need for a healthy community with the need for a strong economy. Working with Delawareans, our communities, and members of the General Assembly, Governor Carney remains focused on beating COVID-19, rebuilding our economy, making sure all Delaware children have an opportunity to succeed, and recommitting to a long-term sustainable financial plan for the state of Delaware.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2017, John served as Delaware’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. During his three terms in Congress, John worked with members of both parties to find solutions to the most important challenges facing the nation. He supported the revitalization of American manufacturing through the “Make It in America” agenda. He was a lead sponsor of the centerpiece of the Jumpstart Our Businesses (JOBS) Act, which made it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to grow and create jobs. John also introduced legislation that was signed into law to prevent critical prescription drug shortages, and he was the lead sponsor on a successful bill to help veterans more easily enter the job market.\n\nPrior to his time in Congress, John served two terms as Delaware’s lieutenant governor. Between 2001 and 2009, he developed the Lt. Governor’s Challenge to encourage Delawareans to live active, healthier lifestyles. He also created and implemented the Models of Excellence in Education program that allowed schools throughout the state to share best practices. In addition, John was a strong supporter of the Delaware smoking ban, and he led the fight for the Cancer Right to Know law, ultimately passed in 2008. John also served as the chairman of the Delaware Health Care Commission, the Criminal Justice Council, and the Delaware Science and Technology Council.\n\nUnder then-Governor Tom Carper, John served as Delaware’s secretary of finance and deputy chief of staff. Before that, he was deputy chief administrative officer for New Castle County, and on the staff of then-Senator Joe Biden. In these roles, he helped Delaware earn its first-ever AAA bond rating, played a key role in the state’s purchase of the Port of Wilmington, and worked to cut taxes nine times.\n\nThe second of nine children, John was born in Wilmington and raised in Claymont by his parents, Jack and Ann Carney, who were both educators. He attended St. Mark’s High School and led the school’s football team to its first state championship in 1973. After graduating high school, John attended Dartmouth College, where he continued his football career and earned All-Ivy League and Most Valuable Player honors. When John returned to Delaware, he coached freshmen football on the staff of UD Head Coach Tubby Raymond while earning a master’s in public administration at the University of Delaware.\n\nJohn lives in Wilmington with his wife, Tracey. They have two sons, Sam and Jimmy."
