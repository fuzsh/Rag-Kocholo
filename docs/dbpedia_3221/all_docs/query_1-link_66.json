        "text": "The way Barry dealt with the arrangements for Pfc.Daniel Bain was so respectful and dignified. The ceremony flowed so well, from all the military and the firemen to all the behind the scenes incidents. We couldn't be more satisfied that Uncle Dan was laid to rest as the Fallen Hero he was.\n\nDan and Mary Houseman\n\nOctober 18, 2019\n\nI want to thank Barry and his staff for the kind and caring assistance he has shown to our family when we needed to make arrangements for our parents - both within a matter of month.\n\nAlso I want to commend Barry on the respectful and compassionate care he gave to the arrangements for Daniel Bain's ceremony. I have never experienced such a lovely celebration of life in such a unique situation.\n\nPaula DeClaudio\n\nOctober 16, 2019\n\nBarry and his staff were so nice. Barry gave my family as much time as we all needed to be with our mom and to say goodbye to our mom\n\nDonna Long\n\nMay 10, 2019\n\nMy mother died suddenly in July of 2017. She had to be transported to Maryland where her final resting place was. Barry was an angel. His compassion and comfort he expresses are just beyond expectations. He treated my Mom like his own and made the process so much easier for me and my family. I appreciate it so much and will never forget his kindness.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nBecky Elkins\n\nMarch 16, 2018\n\nI want to thank Barry and his staff for assisting our family with the final arrangements for Leonard D. Williams. Barry was so very pleasant throughout the journey to Lenny's final rest with his widow, Shirley and his children during their time of need.\n\nWe are so very pleased with his services. You will not find a more compassionate and understanding person to help you through such troubled times. Thank you again!\n\nPatty Hovanec\n\nSeptember 21, 2016"
