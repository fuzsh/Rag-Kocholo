WKSU offered me a wide range of projects that pushed me as a designer and broadened my portfolio. The company offers a great work culture with support and kindness. They are very understanding that you are a student first and can be very flexible when needed. WKSU is my most positive work experience thus far.”\n\nBurton D. Morgan Entrepreneurship Intern\n\nMay 2018 • Kent, OH\n\n“I love the WKSU community. The newsroom is vibrant, welcoming, and full of ideas to share and develop. There's plenty of opportunities to write your own stories, and even get your voice broadcast on air.”"
