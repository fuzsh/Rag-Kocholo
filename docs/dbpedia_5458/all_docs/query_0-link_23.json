The new installations will augment the stations’ many existing <strong>Jampro</strong> systems and extend WKSU's coverage to outlying areas. WKSU is a non-commercial public radio station owned by Kent State University that broadcasts NPR news and classical music serving more than 20 Northeastern Ohio counties and parts of Western Pennsylvania. WKSU-FM (89.7) operates its 50,000-watt station from its broadcast center in Kent, plus four other stations - WKSV (89.1) in Thompson, WKRW (89.3) in Wooster, WKRJ (91.5) in New Philadelphia, and WNRK (90.7) in Norwalk - via repeaters. It also operates station W298BA (107.5) in Boardman by way of translator. As a noncommercial, educational FM station WKSU can be authorized by the FCC to rebroadcast its signal via a translator on any FM channel (201 to 300). The maximum effective radiated power permitted for any translator station is 250 watts. The JLLC is the low power version of <strong>Jampro</strong>'s series of side-mount Penetrator antennas. Rated at up to 4 kW maximum input, each bay consists of a Penetrator style radiating element with a corporate feed system. The Penetrator style is the only US made FM antenna design to be awarded a US Patent. A JLLP can be factory-tuned to any frequency in the FM Band II (87.5- 108 MHz) and subsequently tested at <strong>Jampro</strong>'s 7,500-foot full-field test range in California on a Page 1 of 2 6340 Sky Creek Drive • Sacramento, CA 95828 USA • Tel: 916-383-1177 • Fax: 916-383-1182 • WWW.<strong>Jampro</strong>.com"
