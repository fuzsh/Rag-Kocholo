        "text": "While communication for development activities are presently being carried out all over the world and included increasingly in general development planning, much still needs to be done in terms of systematically assessing the basics in order to ensure that these efforts are truly sustainable and contributing effectively to longer term community empowerment and social change. Communication is still extensively used just to market ideas, maintaining communities in their role as objects of development processes designed and decided upon by others, or developed within such a squeezed time frame that either the funder will be disappointed by limited results, compared to what was envisaged, or where the parties may actually manage to squeeze through all originally foreseen to happen, but with very little chance for longer-term sustainability and success. In order to strategically succeed in calling the attention of funders and development planners to the framework needed for the inclusion of sustainable and truly empowering communication activities in any overall development planning, it is necessary to present compelling evidence that these actually make a difference, that they are and need to be an integral component of any results based development planning and management. For this purpose effective and realistic methods need to be developed and advocated for. In light of the above mentioned urgent strategic challenge for the development community, the present article presents a concrete case where development of community radios in one of the world's poorest countries has strived to meet this challenge by on the one hand working to use existing experience and develop community radios through a slow, highly participatory process and on the other to develop and implement a set of simple \"bare foot\" impact assessment techniques, being brought to use as an interactive tool to report back on process results to both producers, community, partners and funders. Creating and measuring results where most needed-and oftentimes against all odds… The present case is set in post conflict Mozambique. After some almost 30 years of war: partly liberation war, partly externally imposed civil war, much destruction was the result. Destruction of infrastructure, of systems and organisations, such as education and health, and serious damage to the social tissue, oftentimes found unfit to ensure continuity and survival via the socio-cultural framework and traditions. With the signing of the peace accord in 1992 and preparing for the first multi-party elections in 1994, frustration and disbelief in the future, in donor-promises and in each other, was the mental climate. Very little local development initiative was subsequently seen and very few local NGOs or CBOs were active and dynamic. In this climate one of the many development interventions carried out was a major media development project, aimed at \"strengthening democracy and governance through development of the media\". While working to facilitate development of enhanced diversity, pluralism, independence, decentralisation and de-concentration of the professional media, high on the agenda was the parallel need to ensure effective use of the community radio part of the project at the service of the communities marked by the post conflict syndromes. The project as such aimed at reaching broadly in its support to establish the basics for development of a democratic culture and implementation of good governance structures: reaching for improved service of the small, but\n\nNew technologies, such as social media and web services, are becoming increasingly common and important tools for community radio stations. The convergence of community radio, social media and web services opens up new opportunities for participation from the audience and challenges previous conceptions of community, participation, empowerment and the public sphere. This study focuses on how this convergence affects notions of participation, empowerment, community and the public sphere as well as the resulting challenges and opportunities. The study was conducted at three community radio stations in the Western Cape, South Africa and used a mixed-methods approach of qualitative interviews, a survey and netnographic observations of social media and web presence. The findings show that social media and web services increases and changes participation by extending possibilities to interact independently of spatiotemporal limitations of radio broadcasts. It has direct effects on the content of the radio shows and the audience is empowered as co-producers and contributors of content. Additionally, the interaction itself creates new content in other mediums, such as blogs. The study also shows how the converging public spheres of community radio and social media are contradictory as participation becomes economized and exclusionary and relies heavily on financial means, access and digital literacy of the community. The expanded, global reach of community radio also challenges the notion of community as it includes distant and diasporic communities. However, the presence in the global mediascape harmonizes with community radio values of self-representation and self-expression. The study concludes that community radio stations need to both strategize their social media use while balancing their mandate to be a voice of the voiceless that lack access and/or digital literacy to participate.\n\nCommunity broadcasting is known as the third tier of broadcasting, occupying the space between commercial and state broadcasters. In Kenya, this sector has been active only since 2004. Despite its recognised value in other contexts across the globe, community broadcasting is still struggling to find footing in the Kenyan media landscape, and there is a paucity of research on how this sector actually operates – its structures, content and audiences. This work therefore explores the roles and relevance of community radio in the vibrant Kenyan media landscape. Using a complementary mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, three community radio stations with different social contexts, funding and management structures were investigated. The research focused on the ideas and actors behind community radio, its funding and management structures, content, content production processes, listenership patterns and participation practices. Brought to light was that this sector navigates legislation and funding challenges, and juggles between global and local ideals about community broadcasting, most distinct of which are democracy and development. The local, the national and the global inform the ideas under which Kenyan community broadcasting operates, and these ideas are interpreted differently in each context. Communities interact with each of the stations based on their particular local contexts. Not only do they listen to community broadcasters according to specific daily rhythms, but they also mobilise themselves into social formations – most often fan groups and clubs – as a way of collective participation in the life of the station. Contrary to much radio audience research, this work shows that listenership is a distinct activity and participation in and through the media is not only an individual endeavour, but a collective undertaking drawing on pre-existent social solidarities. Community radio content addresses its listeners as different kinds of communities and publics at specific times of the day, and they respond accordingly. As well, there is content transformation across diverse media platforms, which may be a step towards new genres. Despite working within different and hybrid journalistic cultures, the producers play similar roles to their communities across the three contexts including mediation, mobilisation, space-creation, information and entertainment. Of these roles, mobilisation is a strength of community radio. The research reveals the intertwined nature of state, media and audience relationships, and argues for the fact that there are no homogenous audiences even at a micro-level, and that the affective and democratic functions of media participation are intricately linked to each other.\n\nProve It: A community radio research methodology Dr. Eleanor Shember-Critchley, Manchester Metropolitan University Context The UK has over 200 full time licensed community radio stations, all of which aim to deliver ‘social gain’. The Community Radio Order 2004 states this primary outcome to be: “Local services provided…for the good of members of the public, or of particular communities, and… in order to deliver social gain, rather than…for commercial reasons” (p. 3). This definition of social gain focuses not on the broadcast output of the radio station but prioritises outcomes such as helping people into employment, improving the take up of public services, enabling access to local democratic processes or simply boosting well-being. For station managers who have been developing their community presence since 2005 evidence of social gain is experienced in day-to-day interactions and from listener/volunteer feedback. Yet managers struggle to see beyond a numbers based, audience focused, approach when faced with the need to attract advertisers. Quantitative research methodologies cannot demonstrate how and why audiences, community and stakeholders engage with their local community radio station. By repeatedly using narrow commercial methodologies the sector fails to properly account for itself. Prove It The changing and growing sector, alongside an ever-harsher funding environment prompted the ‘Prove It’ project; a methodology to help stations prove their impact beyond audience numbers – to funding bodies, their staff and volunteers and their communities. This paper outlines the methodology and explores the results of the accompanying small-scale trial results of the methodology. In particular, the paper will address how use of the toolkit: 1. Equips community radio managers and volunteers with the tools enabling them to carry out their own soft outcomes research and peer review. 2. Enables stations to assess their effectiveness in achieving their aims and to review their methods and projects to maximise the impact that they have with their listeners and community; 3. Demonstrates the effectiveness of the station to potential grant funders and service delivery partners thereby boosting the station’s ability to secure grants and service delivery contracts. This is particularly important given the increasing financial pressure that stations are currently facing. The methodology builds on a qualitative framework first developed by a team at Griffith University in Australia (2006). Combined with Griffith’s approach are quantitative methods that enable community radio stations to build a rich picture about their audiences, stakeholders and how successful they are in delivering social gain. Using the resulting toolkit, station staff and volunteers can carry out data collection - conducting street surveys, recording one-to-one interviews, and facilitating focus groups. This is encapsulated by a ‘peer review’ (buddying) approach, whereby stations pair themselves to support each other and to collect data in each other’s transmission areas. The paper argues that successful research methodologies are those that carry their worth over to practitioners and how research for community radio station is a key survival tool."
