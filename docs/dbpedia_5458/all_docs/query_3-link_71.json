        "text": "When a would-be assassin attempted to shoot former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania just after 6:00 pm ET on Saturday (7/13), many American news/talk stations were airing either pre-recorded or network programming. Stations were able to turn to their national news organizations for network coverage since most had reporters covering the rally. Many stations called in their local talent to connect with listeners who wanted to talk about the event. Bruce Collins is PD and news director at Cumulus Media Dallas-Fort Worth. He tells TALKERS, “We immediately texted and sent push notifications on WBAP and KLIF and then went to FOX News Radio for wall-to-wall coverage. I then called in our WBAP morning hosts Ernie Brown and Carla Marion to talk with medical experts, police officials, and Secret Service experts in between the FOX coverage. After Ernie and Carla, WBAP PM drive host James Parker took over and fielded local listener reactions in between the FOX coverage. Phones and social media were flooded. Local WBAP host Chris Krok then did a special national broadcast on Westwood One’s “Red Eye Radio” and took local calls throughout the night.” At Red Apple Media’s WABC Radio in New York, company CEO John Catsimatidis interrupted the live “Cousin Brucie’s Saturday Night Rock & Roll Party” and brought talk host Curtis Sliwa in to go on air and work with the news team throughout the evening. Throughout the evening, WABC Radio air personalities including Dominic Carter, Rita Cosby, Greg Kelly, and more called in. Catsimatidis says, “I am immensely proud of our team who at a moment’s notice dropped whatever they were doing to bring our listeners up-to-the-minute information. Emotions are high across America. By delivering the facts, we bring a sense of calm to our listening community.” At WMAL-FM, Washington, DC, brand manager Bill Hess says, “Corey Inganamort was hosting the final hour of our live local Saturday afternoon when he noticed some activity on the studio TV. He immediately began describing what he was seeing. After several minutes, we made the call to go to our network partner, FOX News Radio, for coverage. We stayed with the network through the evening.” Urban One’s WBT-AM/FM, Charlotte, program director Mike Schaefer tells TALKERS, “Saturday evening, Brett Winterble and news director Mark Garrison were on the air within an hour of the incident, delivering the information as it unfolded. Shortly thereafter, additional members of the WBT team called in to contribute their thoughts and analysis, including Bo Thompson, Vince Coakley, Pete Kaliner, and Brett Jensen. Our coverage continued through 9:00 pm Saturday night. On Sunday we broke from regular programming and went live and local from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm, with special continuing coverage from “Good Morning BT” hosts with Bo Thompson and Beth Troutman in the morning, Vince Coakley and Pete Kaliner in the midday, and Brett Winterble and news reporter Scott Hamilton in the afternoon.” At iHeartMedia’s KFI, Los Angeles, where it was just after 3:00 pm, Neil Saavedra was live on the air. Program director Robin Bertolucci says, “We immediately went wall-to-wall covering the story. KFI’s Neil Saavedra was on the air doing his regular Saturday show, ‘The Fork Report,’ when it occurred, and he immediately switched to in-depth news coverage of the assassination attempt. KFI news had the latest and we provided ongoing updates for all of our LA iHeart properties and put up the story on all social platforms. KFI’s Gary Hoffmann came in and took over at 5:00 and we covered it wall-to-wall till 8:00 pm.” Bill Brady owns KFNX-AM, Phoenix and happened to be on the air hosting his Saturday show when news broke. He tells TALKERS, “I was on the air ‘live’ Saturday afternoon. I began the show by saying, ‘This is a very different show than I normally do. Today’s show deals with a very sensitive story. Our president was grazed by a bullet today in Butler County, Pennsylvania. A half an inch difference in the bullet’s path and this could have been an assassination. Others have been killed and wounded. There is much still to learn. Let’s try to make sense of this. It is not a day for politics.'” Salem Radio Network says, “Talk host Mike Gallagher raced to Salem studios in Tampa for a rare, two-hour live special broadcast covering this major breaking news story. Joining Gallagher were SRN’s Dr. Sebastian Gorka and Dennis Prager as well as Salem New York morning host Joe Piscopo and Salem Dallas morning host Mark Davis. Former SRN host (and one-time GOP Presidential contender) Larry Elder also joined the broadcast, which fielded calls from listeners in New York, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, Illinois and many other states.” Obviously, the coverage of a news story of this magnitude spilled over into Sunday. WBEN, Buffalo brand manager Lisa Polizzi says, “We went almost all local on Sunday with David Bellavia in the morning, our ‘Hardline’ political show that included a former FBI agent, a former Buffalo police captain, and the Erie County GOP chair, as well as ‘Reese on the Radio’ taking local calls in the afternoon.”\n\nApril 2024 PPM Data – Information for the April 2024 ratings period (March 28 – April 24) has been released for Portland, Charlotte, San Antonio, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Orlando, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Columbus.\n\nThe only requirement for a spoken-word station to be included here is that they be a Nielsen Audiosubscriber – there are no share or rank thresholds.\n\nMLB; NBA; and NHL team names of corresponding spoken-word flagship(s) are bolded.\n\nFor context, MLB’s 2024 season officially started March 20 when the Dodgers and Padres played two games in South Korea; the other 28 teams played their first game March 28.\n\nNBA and NHL playoffs began April 20.\n\nDNA – DNA = Did Not Appear – Does Not Appear\n\nComparisons are March 2024 – April 2024 (6+).\n\nPORTLAND\n\nNews/Talk\n\nKXL 6.5 – 6.4, #2 – #2\n\nKEX

The third of four rounds of ratings information from Nielsen Audio’s July 2022 PPM survey has been released for 12 markets including Portland, Charlotte, San Antonio, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Orlando, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Columbus. Nielsen’s July 2022 sweep covered June 23 – July 20. Today, TALKERS magazine managing editor Mike Kinosian presents his Ratings Takeaways from this group of markets. In Charlotte, Radio One’s news/talk WBT-AM/FM adds a half share to wrap the survey with a 5.5 share (weekly, 6+ AQH share) and rises to the #4 rank in the market. iHeartMedia’s news/talk KFBK-AM/FM, Sacramento stays flat at a 7.5 share and remains ranked #3 while sister talk KSTE tacks on nine-tenths for a 4.9 share that pushes it up to the #6 rank. In Salt Lake City, iHeartMedia’s news/talk KNRS-AM/FM dips six-tenths for a 9.6 share finish but stays in the #1 spot, while Bonneville’s crosstown news/talk KSL-AM/FM sheds 1.2 shares, finishing with a 5.6 share that drags it from #2 to #6. You can see Mike Kinosian’s complete Ratings Takeaways from this group of markets (as well as the previous two groups) here.\n\nEmmis Dismisses Eight Staffers Ahead of Urban One Indy Acquisition; Longtime WIBC News Reporter Eric Berman Among Them. According to a report in the Indiana Business Journal, Emmis Corp has let eight staffers go from its Indianapolis radio station group as the company prepares to close on its $25 million sale of the stations to Urban One. The Journal says WIBC-FM news reporter Eric Berman was the only air staffer to be let go with the others serving in marketing, IT and online content creation capacities. Berman tweeted on 8/10, “Some personal news: this morning my tenure at WIBC came to an end. For 28 years, it has been my privilege to bring you fair and detailed coverage of news affecting Hoosiers’ lives, and I hope you’ll stick around for whatever comes next.” Emmis issued the following official statement on the matter: “Today, Emmis notified eight individuals that their positions have been eliminated. Impacted individuals are being provided severance and offered insurance coverage. These are difficult days, and we wish them nothing but success.” Emmis’ sale of the Indianapolis radio stations effectively takes the company out of the radio business. It began as a broadcasting company in 1981 with the ownership of WENS-FM, Indianapolis. Earlier this year Emmis stated that after the sale of its media holdings it has “redeployed capital into new ventures which emphasize its sales and marketing experience including: Lencore Acoustics, a leader in high-quality sound masking solutions for commercial applications; Sound That BRANDS, the Los Angeles-based podcasting studio specializing in branded audio content for national advertisers; and Digonex, a leading provider of dynamic pricing solutions for attractions and live entertainment industries.”\n\nCumulus Media Renews with Learfield and Air Force Academy.

This year’s U.S. local advertising forecast is being revised by BIA Advisory Services. The firm says its new estimate is $167.4 billion, down from its original estimate of $173.3 billion issued in December 2021. It cites “headwinds from overseas conflicts, continuing supply chain issues and deep cuts in ad spending from large verticals like automotive” for precipitating the reduction. Positives for the ad market still include an anticipated strong political ad year, the expansion of online gambling local advertising and consumer spending on leisure and recreational activities. BIA SVP and chief economist Mark Fratrik comments, “The year didn’t start as strong as we had anticipated, making for a difficult first two quarters as some expected advertising spend started to retract. On the one hand, personal income continues to rise, but the cost of consumer goods, rising gas prices and inflation are having a major impact and we believe that will influence how advertisers will choose to use their ad dollars in the coming months. All of that must be weighed against what we see as positives for local advertising this year.” The latest forecast estimate still gives traditional media ad revenue a slight advantage over digital at 52.5 % of the ad spend ($87.9 billion), while digital media will get 47.5 % of the ad spend at $79.5 billion. Overall, BIA is decreasing digital estimates slightly from the original 2022 forecast due to mobile facing headwinds amid new privacy measures on iPhones. Additionally, there has been slower than anticipated growth. Even as both digital channels continue to grow, it’s at a reduced pace than originally expected. Significant growth is expected in TV OTA (+30.3 %), TV Digital (+18.3 %) and Radio Digital (+14.5 %).\n\n47th Annual Gracie Awards Luncheon Set for June 22.

He was a living symbol of the radio medium’s most glorious ideals – both in substance and style – and he was one of modern-day America’s most influential and inspirational proponents of the First Amendment.” Services will take place at Lloyd Maxcy, 16 Shea Place in New Rochelle on Tuesday, May 31 4:00 pm-7:00 pm. The funeral mass will be held at St. Anthony of Padua, 49 South Street, Litchfield on Wednesday, June 1 at 11:30 am.

In this week’s blog from the Westwood One Audio Active Group, two different types of advertising copy are studied – rational copy rooted in features and benefits and emotion-based copy that can be used to build brands. The blog reports that according to Binet and Field, the rational approach to advertising (relevant and useful targeted activation) works together with the emotion-based approach that “creates positive feelings and associations” via broad-reach ads that are “interesting and enjoyable.” The report also concludes that: 1) Emotion-based creative builds stronger brands and generates greater business outcomes; 2) Emotions guide and simplify our decision making: Positive emotional responses lead to a positive evaluation of choice; 3) According to authors John Kearon, Orlando Wood, and Tom Ewing, ads should build familiarity, create positive emotion, and make things easy to process; and 4) Podcast listeners prefer funny and entertaining ads but say they are more likely to hear rational podcast ads that communicate features/benefits.
