        "text": "I am happy to announce the re-release of our Station Finder Map, including our Road Trip functionality. This version includes several features worth noting, as follows:\n\n- It allows you to identify local NPR station based on zip code, city/state, station call letters or by broadcasting network.\n\n- It allows you to identify local NPR stations along a driving route.\n\n- It allows you to identify local NPR stations that can be heard at a specific address.\n\n- For stations returned by the finder, you can view the station's coverage map, view more information about the station, and click through to the stations' group page within the NPR Community.\n\n- It is fully supported by our recently released Station Finder API.\n\nWe are very excited to have this feature back on the site and hope that it will help our listeners find NPR wherever they may go. In a later post, I will be providing a detailed technical explanation of how the Station Finder Map works."
