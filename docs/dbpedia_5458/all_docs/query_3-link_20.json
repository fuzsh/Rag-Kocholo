        "text": "How Apple Shaped Podcasting\n\nA recent update to the Apple podcast app also included a tweak to how podcast downloads work. As a podcast user you're free to shrug and move on. But for podcast creators this could be a big deal. According to data from Podtrac, overall downloads across the industry were down 15 percent as of February. This American Life lost 20 percent of their downloads. Some shows at NPR saw a 30 percent dip. In this week's midweek podcast, OTM producer Molly Rosen looks at how Apple has shaped the podcast industry. On the Media is supported by listeners like you.

Joy! Forward! The DNC's Fave Buzzwords, Explained\n\nWhen President Biden campaigned for re-election, he highlighted threats to democracy and his long track record.

On this week's On the Media, a democratic strategist explains why we heard words like joy and freedom over and over at the Democratic National Convention. Plus, hear how Christian nationalism is shaping American politics. [01:00] Host Brooke Gladstone interviews Anat Shenker-Osorio, a democratic messaging strategist who has advised PACs and committees in battleground states, about the party's new messaging strategy. They discuss how mockery shrinks strongmen to size; why voters seem to like the word \"freedom\" more than \"democracy\"; and more. [16:39] Brooke speaks with Matthew D. Taylor, scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, & Jewish Studies in Baltimore and author of the forthcoming book, The Violent Take It by Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy.

Plus, how the phenomenon has shaped American politics for centuries. [32:23] Brooke continues her conversation with Matthew D. Taylor. Taylor introduces Brooke to the world of independent charismatic Christianity and its media, where an extreme form of Christian nationalism has taken root.
