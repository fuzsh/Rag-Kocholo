        "text": "About NPR (Online News)'s Bias Rating\n\nNPR (Online News) is featured on the AllSides Media Bias Chart™.\n\nNPR (Online News) is a news media source with an AllSides Media Bias Rating™ of Lean Left.\n\nImportant Note: This media bias rating is only for NPR's online, written news content, NOT NPR radio. AllSides also rates NPR's fact-checking section and opinion/editorial content separately.\n\nWhat a \"Lean Left\" Rating Means\n\nSources with an AllSides Media Bias Rating of Lean Left display media bias in ways that moderately align with liberal, progressive, or left-wing thought and/or policy agendas. A Lean Left bias is a moderately liberal rating on the political spectrum.\n\nLearn more about Lean Left ratings\n\nNPR Moved to Lean Left Following Feb. 2022 Blind Bias Survey\n\nSept. 2021 Editorial Review: NPR Online Bias Rated Center, Close to Lean Left\n\nNPR Online Content Rated Center, Close to Lean Left, in Feb. 2020 Blind Bias Survey\n\nNPR Bias Incidents: June 2020 to Oct. 2020\n\nAugust 2019 Editorial Review: NPR Online News Bias Rated Center, Close to Lean Left\n\nFeb. 2019 Editorial Review: NPR Maintained Center Rating, Though Close to Lean Left\n\nDec. 2017: Editorial Review and Blind Bias Survey; AllSides Created Separate Media Bias Ratings for NPR and NPR Editorial/Opinion\n\nAllSides Media Bias Ratings for NPR Prior to 2017\n\nNPR Moved to Lean Left Following Feb. 2022 Blind Bias Survey\n\nRespondents across the political spectrum on average rated NPR (Online News) as Lean Left in a Feb. 2022 AllSides Blind Bias Survey.\n\nThis differed from AllSides' rating of Center for NPR at the time. The Blind Survey results triggered an independent review, and AllSides subsequently moved NPR's rating to Lean Left.\n\nOn a scale of -9 to +9, with 0 representing Center, -9 representing farthest Left and +9 representing farthest Right, respondents to the survey on average rated NPR as -2.77, putting it in the Lean Left category, and close to Left. The middle 50% of responses lied between -5.03 (Left) and -0.71 (Lean Left).\n\nWhen normalized, 71% of respondents rated NPR as left of center and 9% rated NPR as right of center.\n\nA total of 600 people rated NPR's bias. Respondents self-rated their own bias as Left, Lean Left, Center, Lean Right, and Right. When breaking down by respondent bias, on average, respondents who self-reported as having a bias of Left, Lean Left, or Right rated NPR as Lean Left. Respondents in the Center and Lean Right, on average, rated the outlet as Left.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, on average, rated NPR (Online News) as Lean Left, while Independents rated NPR as Left.\n\nSept. 2021 Editorial Review: NPR Online Rated Center, Close to Lean Left\n\nNPR online news is a source that AllSides struggled to rate — its content continually appeared to be on the border of Center and Lean Left. We even discussed if we should create a Center-Left category for sources like this. Regardless, the AllSides team, which contains people across the political spectrum, opted to keep NPR Center during an Oct. 2021 Editorial Review. This was largely unanimous; the only dissenting opinion was from an editor with a Lean Right bias, who argued they ought to be moved to Lean Left.\n\nThe team largely agreed that NPR has a slight left-wing story choice and occasional leftward slant in word choice. Yet many articles were written very straightforward, without much spin, sensationalism, or partisan slant. Right-wing perspectives were often missing, but left-wing views weren't necessarily strongly highlighted either. It did betray a slight left lean on very controversial topics. We agreed the outlet was best thought of as Center-Left rather than a perfect Center.\n\nNPR never published content that we would consider on the right, but the team found much of its content was not slanted one way or the other. Much of NPR's slight left-wing bias showed in what it did not include — stories of interest to conservatives, as well as perspectives on the right, were largely missing, even if the content it did publish was not as overtly left-wing as other liberal media outlets. Its writing was often largely down the middle, and it often avoided partisan angles on stories on highly politicized or contentious topics.\n\nHere are some things our team noted from NPR on the day of review (Sept. 30, 2021), with review looking at content going back 6 months:\n\nAn article interviewing former Trump supporters who voted for Biden who are no longer happy with Biden offered a unique perspective that was neither fully left nor fully right;\n\nCoverage on NPR polls of Biden's approval rating were straightforward and factual;\n\nSome headlines had a left-wing bent [emphasis ours]: \"Amid Republican Efforts To Restrict Voting Rights, Biden Gives A Stark Warning\" — Republicans would dispute that their efforts are meant to \"restrict\" rights;\n\nWe noted some elite bias, with a bent toward/highlighting the opinions and suggestions of coastal elites and major global institutions that are not trusted by populists: \"Climate Change Is Accelerating, And Humans Must Cut Emissions Now, A Major U.N. Report Warns\";\n\nAn article on NBA players refusing the COVID-19 vaccine didn't quote any of them. It remarked one player had “allegedly liked Instagram posts that include vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories,\" but did not say what that misinformation or conspiracy theory was, preventing the reader from deciding for themselves; a case of bias by omission and slant;\n\nA lot of coronavirus coverage could be seen as neutral, but perhaps as left-wing or elitist by those who have dissident views on the topic: Do You Need To Wear A Mask Indoors Where You Live? Check This Map, If You're Pregnant, The CDC Really Wants You To Get Vaccinated Against COVID-19 (this article did not mention why pregnant people might not want the vaccine);\n\nAn article about a push for internet voting had a favorable slant, and did not highlight the reasons people may be against this. This is likely not an angle that would be taken by outlets on the right;\n\nBig stories on the right, such as the Sept. 2021 Haitian migrant camp in Texas, were largely downplayed or omitted; when there is a big news story with controversy, some on our team noted NPR's coverage tilts more to the left;\n\nSome stories appeared to show the Biden administration in a negative light.\n\nNPR Online Content Rated Center, Close to Lean Left, in Feb. 2020 Blind Bias Survey\n\nA February 2020 AllSides Blind Bias Survey found that NPR online news content maintained a Center bias, though barely, and close to Lean Left. During a Blind Bias Survey, people from all sides of the political spectrum and a diverse array of ages and geographic locations rate the bias of content from a media outlet blindly, meaning all identifying branding and information is removed.\n\nOur February 2020 survey found that on average, people who identified themselves as being Left, Lean Left or Center viewed NPR online news content as as Center. Those who identified themselves as Lean Right and Right rated NPR online news as on the border of Center and Lean Left. The overall average response of all groups was Center, though close to the border line with Lean Left. After assessing the results of the Blind Bias Survey, AllSides determined that Center was still the best bias rating for NPR online news content only.\n\nNPR Bias Incidents: June 2020 to Oct. 2020\n\nIn June 2020, AllSides documented a particular example of an NPR story that showed left bias and fake news, which NPR later corrected. In Oct. 2020, NPR wrote on Twitter that it would not report on The New York Post's Hunter Biden story, which suggested Hunter Biden leveraged his connection to his father, Joe Biden (former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate) to increase his pay from Burisma, a Ukrainian energy holdings company. NPR said they would not cover the story because \"we don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories.\"\n\nAugust 2019 Editorial Review: NPR News Bias Rated Center, Close to Lean Left\n\nDue to ongoing community feedback from users concerned NPR deserves a Lean Left bias rating, the multipartisan team at AllSides conducted an Editorial Review of NPR online news on August 28, 2019. We determined that NPR online news maintained a Center bias, while there was some indication that some of its pieces Leaned Left. While some pieces may have had a slight Lean Left bent, it was not frequent enough to warrant changing the NPR online news rating to Lean Left.\n\nWhile AllSides believed NPR may be on the cusp of a Lean Left rating, we also noted its bias was not as overt as other media outlets AllSides rated as Lean Left, such as The New York Times or The Washington Post. AllSides Media Bias Ratings™ are not determined relative to other outlets, but a small amount of consideration is given to the rest of the media landscape, particularly when assessing issues such as bias by omission — which stories an outlet is choosing to cover or not to cover.\n\nOverall, the AllSides team agreed that NPR's online headlines did not insert bias and largely present the facts. NPR online news did not employ sensationalism or overt bias in either direction, and its reporting was mostly in a factual, objective style, not an interpretive style. Some team members noted NPR did not always choose to highlight good-faith conservative viewpoints, choosing to omit nuanced criticism and comments by those on the right.\n\nIn alignment with past Editorial Reviews, such as the review AllSides conducted in Feb. 2019 (details below), the team found NPR online news did not focus coverage on hot-button topics favored by either side. For example, while many right media outlets frequently focus on abortion, the Second Amendment, and free speech, and left-wing media outlets focus on healthcare, economic inequality, and racism, NPR online news did not favor or even routinely cover such controversial issues at the time of review. NPR online news coverage focused more on congressional and representative politics, elections, and world news.\n\nAllSides frequently received feedback about the NPR online news media bias rating being Center. We believed most of this feedback was due to confusion from folks who thought we were rating NPR radio content, but we vowed to continue to conduct research on this outlet.\n\nFeb. 2019 Editorial Review: NPR Rated Center Bias, Close to Lean Left\n\nAfter releasing version 1 of the AllSides Media Bias Chart™, we received a lot of feedback from people who disagreed that NPR should be rated Center (though the feedback could have been people who mistakenly thought we were rating NPR's radio content). On February 19, 2019, our team conducted an Editorial Review of NPR online news. We determined that NPR online news maintained a Center media bias rating. There was perhaps a very slight left lean in NPR online news coverage overall.\n\nThe AllSides team, made up of people from all over the political bias spectrum, unanimously determined that NPR online news maintained a Center media bias. At the time, we found NPR online news did not predictably show coverage favoring left or right perspectives, and generally reported in a way that fairly showcased the perspectives of both the Left and the Right. NPR online news did not use emotionally charged or polarizing language, and maintained a relatively fair representation of issues. We found its reporting to be fact-based and not leaning left or right.\n\nOur team noted that NPR did not give lots of coverage to current hot-button issues frequently seen in coverage on the Right — such as free speech, abortion, or the Second Amendment — and in that same vein, did not give lots of coverage to hot-button issues often covered by the Left — economic inequality, climate change, or social justice initiatives. Instead, it seemed to cover issues that were of equal concern to both sides, such as healthcare, immigration, and representative politics, such as Congress and election coverage.\n\nOur team noted that NPR did a good job of ensuring Opinion pieces were not interspersed with News pieces.\n\nDec. 2017: Editorial Review and Blind Bias Survey; AllSides Created Separate Media Bias Ratings for NPR and NPR Editorial/Opinion\n\nThe AllSides NPR online news media bias rating had historically been Center, but data collected in surveys leading up to Dec. 2017 showed that NPR may slowly be inching farther Left. Because AllSides users had also expressed this belief through voting, AllSides decided to take a closer look.\n\nIn Dec. 2017, AllSides engaged in two reviews for NPR (learn more about how AllSides rates media bias). The first, a Blind Bias Survey, returned a Lean Left bias rating. Two previous blind surveys had resulted in Center ratings for NPR's online news media bias both times, though slightly towards Lean Left.\n\nWe followed up with an Editorial Review, in which the AllSides team looked at a composite of past research, media bias ratings and data, while also looking at NPR's full news coverage of that day. Considering that recent data had shown a slight move towards Lean Left, we examined both hard news pieces and op-eds (opinions pieces and editorials).\n\nAllSides found that NPR News maintained a Center media bias, as it consistently showcased multiple sides of each story and refrained from biased language and images in its news articles. Its editorials, however, were slightly biased towards the Left.\n\nWith this in mind, AllSides separated NPR into two source pages: we created a new, separate page for NPR Opinion/Editorial. This bias rating applied to all online op-eds, analysis and fact checking content. The page you are currently viewing, NPR Online News, represented a media bias rating for NPR's online news content only.\n\nAllSides Media Bias Ratings for NPR Prior to 2017\n\nA 2005 UCLA study rated NPR’s Morning Edition (not based on the news section of the website) as having a Lean Left media bias, while the AllSides Media Bias Rating™ (based on the news section of the website) for NPR remained Center. A majority of over 5,000 community members agreed with the Center rating, but in a follow-up survey of 118 members who disagreed, NPR received an average bias score of 72.5, well within the range of a Lean Left media bias. An October 2013 AllSides Blind Survey rated NPR as Center by a narrow margin.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCommunity Feedback\n\nFeedback does not determine ratings, but may trigger deeper review.\n\nAs of August 2024, people have voted on the AllSides Media Bias Rating for NPR (Online News). On average, those who disagree with our rating think this source has a Lean Left bias.\n\nConfidence Level\n\nConfidence is determined by how many reviews have been applied and consistency of data.\n\nAs of August 2024, AllSides has medium confidence in our Lean Left rating for NPR (Online News). An Editorial Review or Blind Bias Survey has affirmed this rating, or multiple reviews have returned differing results. If we perform more bias reviews and gather consistent data, this confidence level will increase.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nNPR is a multimedia news organization and radio program producer that serves as a national syndicator to a network of 950 public radio stations in the United States. Its mission is to work with member stations to create a more informed public, one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas and cultures. NPR's flagships are two drive time news broadcasts, Morning Edition and the afternoon All Things Considered; both are carried by most NPR member stations, and are two of the most popular radio programs in the country.\n\nNPR aims to be independent by generating revenue from fees it charges its member stations, as well as grants from foundations, contributions and sponsorships.\n\nAbout NPR's Audience\n\nA 2014 Pew Research study, \"Where News Audiences Fit on the Political Spectrum,\" found that \"the clear majority of [NPR's] audience (67%) is left-of-center, and it is a particularly popular source for consistent liberals, who make up 41% of its audience (compared with 16% of all respondents).\" It's important to note that Pew's assessment of NPR's audience may have included those who also listen to its radio content and are not just consumers of its online news.\n\nThird-Party Accusations of Bias and Misinformation\n\nIn April 2024, NPR Senior Business Editor Uri Berliner wrote an op-ed in The Free Press in which he said NPR had \"lost America's trust.\" NPR has always had a liberal bent,\" Berliner wrote, \"but during most of my tenure here, an open-minded, curious culture prevailed.\"\n\nThat changed in recent years, Berliner said — it now offered \"the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.\" \"An open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR,\" Berliner said. The shift began with Trump's election: \"what began as tough, straightforward coverage of a belligerent, truth-impaired president veered toward efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency.\" Berliner said reports of Russian collusion \"became the catnip that drove reporting,\" and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) purportedly became \"NPR’s guiding hand.\" Other examples of purportedly biased reporting included NPR's coverage of Hunter Biden's laptop, the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBerliner specifically criticized former NPR CEO John Lansing for treating systemic racism as a foregone conclusion, rather than an open question, as Berliner saw it. Berliner also took issue with Lansing's assertion that diversity was NPR's \"North Star,\" saying, \"Race and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace,\" including the growth of identity-based affinity groups.\n\nFinally, saying \"people at every level of NPR have comfortably coalesced around the progressive worldview,\" Berliner argued an \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" was \"the most damaging development at NPR.\" When he looked at NPR's Washington, D.C. bureau, he said, he \"found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans.\"\n\nLater that month, NPR suspended Berliner for five days without pay because, it said, he \"had failed to secure its approval for outside work for other news outlets, as is required of NPR journalists.\"\n\nTop of Page\n\nNPR (Online News) Ownership and Funding\n\nFunding and ownership do not influence bias ratings.
