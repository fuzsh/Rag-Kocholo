        "text": "Growing up in Illinois, Robert aspired to become a program director for a radio station. He first achieved this goal when he became the program director for WDTM in Detroit. Soon after, he and C. K. Patrick co-founded WCLV in Cleveland in 1962. Now observing its 60th anniversary, WCLV is just one of a handful of Northeast Ohio radio stations to have stayed with its original format throughout this time.\n\nSince 2001, Jacqueline Gerber has hosted the morning drive on WCLV. In addition to her career in radio, she has written for newspapers in Cleveland as well as her home state of Illinois. She also enjoys public speaking because, unlike in radio, she actually gets to see her audience. After two decades of waking up at 2:30 a.m. to host morning drive, she has concluded that most nightlife is overrated.\n\nRob first joined WCLV as an announcer and board operator in 1992. Since then, he has gone on to host a variety of programs, including The Quiet Hour. You can hear Rob leading The Quiet Hour every night at 11 p.m. Rob also hosts In Tribute to A. Grace Lee Mims on Wednesday nights at 10 p.m. Mims, the host of The Black Arts on WCLV for 43 years, showcased the contributions people of color made to classical music.\n\nDescribed as “a golden thread” by ClevelandClassical.com, John has been with WCLV since 2018. Currently, he hosts If It Ain’t Baroque, Night Music and the occasional special. An Iowa native, he lived and worked in Nebraska as a teacher, conductor and radio host before moving to Ohio. John is also a professional singer and holds degrees in Voice and Conducting from Coe College and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nBill joined WCLV in 1998, becoming the second program director in the station's history. A Temple University graduate, he began broadcasting a WFLN in Philadelphia. Bill met his wife Cynthia, a singer and voice teacher, and they moved to San Francisco. Here, Bill and Cynthia sang with the San Francisco Symphony Chorus and welcomed their son Brendan. The O’Connell’s now reside in Northeast Ohio.\n\nSam Petrey is a native of Cleveland Heights. As the C.K. Patrick Memorial intern, Sam greatly enjoys learning and working with the people he grew up listening to on the radio. He currently hosts WCLV Sunday Morning, Sunday Brunch and voices the arts calendar reports throughout the day. In addition, Sam is a professional violinist and performs with many of the local Cleveland music ensembles.\n\nIn 2022, Dan began providing jazz hosting services to WCLV, which allows him to do the thing he loves most in radio: sharing his favorite music with listeners. From 1987 to 2009, Dan served as WCPN's evening jazz host. In 2009, Dan joined Ideastream’s arts and culture team where he hosted both Applause America and Applause on WVIZ. These days, Dan also hosts the Crain's Cleveland podcast The Landscape.\n\nA native Clevelander, Mark trained as a chorister at Christ Episcopal Church in Shaker Heights before his voice changed. He went on to earn a degree in English literature from Old Dominion University. Mark began his radio career in 1977 as a host at WTGM (now WHRO) in Norfolk, Virginia. His love of music and his way with words meant that classical radio was a perfect fit for him. He joined WCLV in November 1977."
