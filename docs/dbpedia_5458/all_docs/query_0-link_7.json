        "text": "The Kent State University Board of Trustees is expected to vote on \"agreements for the management of WKSU stations\" on Wednesday.\n\nThe motion, listed as \"new business\" on the board's meeting agenda released Monday, came after people familiar with the plan said the university is considering a merger between Kent State's radio station, WKSU (89.7 FM), and nonprofit Ideastream's WCPN (90.3 FM).\n\nMore: Are public radio stations WKSU and WCPN planning to merge?\n\nAs of Monday, the university had not released copies of any proposed agreements pursuant to a public records request.\n\nThe university and Ideastream Public Media have declined to comment on specifics of the plan prior to the board's vote.\n\nUniversity spokesman Eric Mansfield said in a statement Monday night that discussions on \"partnerships, collaborations\" and other ways for WKSU and Ideastream Public Media to work together have been ongoing for some time.\n\n\"These discussions were reinforced by the results of an analysis conducted with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,\" he added. \"The results encouraged WKSU and Ideastream Public Media to leverage combined resources and expertise for the growth and expansion of public media service in Northeast Ohio.\n\n\"Kent State University and Ideastream Public Media are committed to continuing and enhancing quality public radio and award-winning news coverage throughout Northeast Ohio.\"\n\nMansfield was referring to a $100,000 \"collaborative operations and services grant\" the two public radio stations received last year from CPB.\n\nThe results of that analysis are also pending release pursuant to a public records request.\n\nFormer WKSU station manager John Perry, who served from 1973 to 1999, said that he had been told WKSU would become the \"primary, and only outlet, for NPR and local news\" in the greater Cleveland-Akron area.\n\nHe said WCPN would become the classical station for Northeast Ohio and WCLV (104.9 FM, also owned by Ideastream) would become an extension of the news stream for the Cleveland area.\n\nIn addition to WCPN and WCLV, Ideastream owns public television stations WVIZ and The Ohio Channel. Ideastream was founded in 2001 when WVIZ public television and WCPN merged. WCLV became part of Ideastream in 2013.\n\nIdeastream this year became Ideastream Public Media, announcing \"the change represents the integration and alignment of our organization’s broadcast, digital and program assets, community services and educational resources.\n\n\"It signals our evolution and symbolizes us coming together as a unified organization to strengthen the community.\"\n\nWKSU serves more than 20 Ohio counties and parts of Western Pennsylvania. The station’s main broadcast center is in Kent and it has repeater stations at WKSV (89.1 FM) in Thompson, WKRW (89.3-FM) in Wooster, WKRJ (91.5 FM) in New Philadelphia, WNRK (90.7 FM) in Norwalk, and via translator stations W239AZ (95.7 FM) in Ashland and W234CX (94.7 FM) in Mansfield.\n\nEric Marotta can be reached at 330-541-9433, or emarotta@gannett.com.
