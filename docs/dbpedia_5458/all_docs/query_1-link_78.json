        "text": "Your electric company will be AEP, Ohio Edison, or Holmes-Wayne Coop, depending on your location. Here is a list of internet providers:\n\nhttps://www.highspeedinternet.com/oh...0Wooster,%20OH\n\nI live south of Wooster, and am on Holmes-Wayne. I have a CenturyLink Landline with DSL. I would guess that most people use MCTV for cable. MCTV does not provide Cleveland channel 61 Univision, however. The trouble with using a TV antenna in Wooster is that Wayne county is both low in elevation and in the middle of nowhere, so over-the-air reception can be poor. On the other hand, WQKT-FM Wooster is 52,000 watts, so it comes in loud & clear. WKSU-FM has a repeater in Wooster, so you can listen to it, too. I have HD radios in my house & car, so that I can listen to HD-3 classical, instead of NPR."
