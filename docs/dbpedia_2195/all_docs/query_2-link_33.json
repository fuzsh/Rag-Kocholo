Even my puppies react when I play it loud! hahahahah\n\nGlad you like the music Setsuna! If you're a fan of trance, I'm actually working on a remix for a competition at the moment using FL studio. Pain in the ass but I'll show you when done :).\n\nAs for your link, I thought it had already been posted in the thread? If not, I must have assumed it was posted already because for the last year or so, Adagio has been my favourite trance song of all time - and that is saying a lot!\n\nI am indeed a fan of trance, so yeah don't hesitate to show me that remix once you're done with it :P\n\nAs for that song of Tiesto, yeah I thought it had already been posted here as well, but I did a quick search and it didn't appear in any of the pages. So I knew at the moment that such a great song shouldn't be missing this thread, haha. Adagio for Strings is just, how to say... supreme.\n\nThis is something else I just discovered when listening to a compilation of Dance and Trance music -- a very good song IMO, the beat is awesome: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaflNU45bVY\n\nive actually never been a fan of adagio... the orchestral version is really awesome and this adaptation has always seemed kinda lame to me, a rare misstep by tiesto.\n\nbut i am not here to complain i am here to share good music!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA9ebFeQmm0\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE0IFs_dro\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzAaBGXbGeA\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSXRKG0Zyic\n\nI have so much more if you guys like it!!!!!\n\n(keep in mind that with long dance tracks, since they are unmixed, you have to be patient before judging because it sometimes takes time to get to the fucking awesome parts! this is necessary when dancing but otherwise a little tedious, but it's only fair to the music :P it is dance music after all!)\n\nReally enjoyed that Trance song Stallion ^_^\n\nSo recently I found a DJ called \"Manian\", which is the DJ of an amazing Trance band (Tune Up), and has a lot of cool music such as Welcome to the Club. Now I've discovered more good songs of him, and I would like to put them here ^\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtyYcn0iApw --> DJ Manian: Ravers in the UK *****\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6OkujW0Kz4&feature=related --> DJ Manian: Sky ****\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDxpeLaoYv4&feature=related --> DJ Manian: Hold me Tonight ****\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrtY2lpf40 --> Tune Up: Ravers Fantasy (this was one of the more cataloged songs of 2009)\n\nBy the way Stallion, I bet you'll like the last one :P\n\nHaha Setsuna you know me too well, I did indeed enjoy the last song and am checking out the others. It's not quite hardstyles but it's harder then regular electro. I'm much more picky with this music as it's pretty easy to screw up, but i'll check out the other songs posted!! Oh and now that Setsuna has posted, I have another trance track from TyDi called Vanilla :). It was played on Armin's ASOT which is pretty prestigious!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tF8HQfY1JA\n\nEDIT: I'm not as big a fan of \"Sky\", but Ravers in the UK is very very catchy :). Hold Me Tonight isn't too bad either!\n\nAs a lover of electro, I lurk this thread, and I haven't got anything to share atm (I do have a lot of happy hardcore and trance on my iPhone, but... shy about sharing music =P), and I just wanted to say I adore what BigPDA just posted: Alexander Wolff - Destructive (Mark Norman Remix). It does take awhile to climax, but that's what you should be expecting from long dance tracks, and it's very good all the way through. Thank you for sharing! Oh, and MS, very nice work from TyDi (You Walk Away, haven't checked out the other one yet). I love vocal trance, and it hits just the right pulsing beep noises that I crave. Ethereal, just like trance should be! The shift around the 1-minute mark is very enthralling, love how it builds up...\n\nETA: Sweet, Audrey Gallagher! And seems this song was featured on an Armin van Buuren CD. Awesome =)\n\nI've been leeching off this thread for too long without giving anything back.\n\nNo more!\n\nSome people may have heard me talk about it on IRC, but I am a large fan of breakbeat especially. Here are some of my personal favourites\n\nenjoy the following polyrhythms and syncopation;\n\nSupertweeker - Killer\n\nSupertweeker - Let's Go (sorry this is not a youtube link)\n\nFar Too Loud - Screamer\n\nFar Too Loud - Midnight\n\nThe Crystal Method - Double Down Under - This is my #1\n\nMeat Katie - Dirty South"
