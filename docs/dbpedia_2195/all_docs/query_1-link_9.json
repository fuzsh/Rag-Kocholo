It is based on the members' autobiographical stories, and Subin, Yeonjun, Taehyun, and Huening Kai participated in writing the lyrics to add authenticity. We say that we will not take for granted the fact that we are by each other's side and that we will move forward into tomorrow, cherishing this miraculous relationship.\n\n” — Melon\n\nLyrics[]\n\nAudio[]\n\nSpotify[]\n\nVideos[]"
