CurrentlyTemplate:When he is a part of the duo twoloud.\n\nDJ Manian has produced a number of singles under various pseudonyms. From September 2007 to September 2013 he contributed to the musical project \"Spencer & Hill\" under the pseudonym Josh Hill alongside the founder of Vengeance.de soudset website Manuel Schleis and with former Verano member Dennis Nicholls, with whom he created at the end of 2013 the musical project \"Twoloud\", however, the duo asked not to be identified immediately.
