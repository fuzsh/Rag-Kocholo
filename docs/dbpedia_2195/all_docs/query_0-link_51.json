I work with two producers [Yanou and Manian] and the three of us make up Cascada,\" she previously explained in an old interview.\n\n\"They've always chosen to stay low-profile where I've always been the face of everything, that's why sometimes there's a misconception.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Oscar winner dies on fly-fishing trip in New Zealand\n\nREAD MORE: 'Series of lies': Sopranos star 'hid' diagnosis for years\n\nNow, Horler, 42, has announced some new music, with the new singles Ain't No Mountain High Enough and Never Be Lonely out now.\n\n9Honey Celebrity takes a look at where Cascada and Horler are now â€“ and what happened to the music act.\n\nWhere does Cascada come from?\n\nCascada hails from Germany, with all members born in the European country.\n\nHorler was born in Germany to English parents and her father, David Horler, is a jazz musician.\n\nREAD MORE: CÃ©line Dion's rare update amid health battle\n\nThe group was originally called Cascade, but they changed their name as it was similar to DJ Kascade's name.\n\nWhat is Cascada's biggest hit?\n\nDespite releasing a number of hit songs, Everytime We Touch was one of their biggest hits and spent weeks at no.1 on the charts. It's also a fan-favourite, too!\n\nThe group is one of the most successful acts to come out of Germany.\n\nHorler previously told Just Jared in an interview about having so many smash hits with Cascada that stand the test of time, that she \"can't understand it either \".\n\nShe said she keeps fit to keep up her youthful performances on stage.\n\n\"I'm still really young spirited. I make sure I keep fit. I do a stage performance that I could easily have done 10, 15 years ago,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"I hope that no one feels that they have an older artist in front of them .\"\n\nIs Natalie Horler married?\n\nHorler lives in Germany with husband Moritz Raffelberg, who she married in 2011, they share a daughter together.\n\nThe pair are notoriously private when it comes to their personal lives.\n\nNet worth\n\nHorler is said to have a networth of $US7 million, approximately $10.5 million.\n\nEurovision\n\nIn 2013, Cascada was the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\"For me, it's a very, very big honour to be able to participate.
