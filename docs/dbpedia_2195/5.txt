Cascada are working on new music, with singer Natalie Horler teasing all will be revealed soon as they celebrate their 20th anniversary year.

The group – also starring DJs/producers DJ Manian and DJ Yanou – scored hits with Everytime We Touch, Truly Madly Deeply, What Hurts The Most and Evacuate The Dancefloor throughout the 2000s, and according to Horler they’re set to make a comeback.

She tells The Sun’s Bizarre column: “I have loads of stuff planned. I am going to be in the studio recording lots of new music. You will find out soon as I don’t like keeping secrets.”

This year marks two decades since the German Eurodance act formed and released their debut single Miracle, which eventually featured on their first album, ‘Everytime We Touch’ (2006).

They went on to release a total of four studio albums – ‘Perfect Day’ (2008), ‘Evacuate The Dancefloor’ (2009) and ‘Original Me’ (2011) – three of which peaked in the UK Top 10.
