The formula is probably as old as the pop music itself: a nice singer as the face of the group, and some 'invisible' producers who determine the sound. The German dance act Cascada is also composed according to this process. Producers Manuel Reuter (DJ Manian) and Yann Peifer (Yanou) in the studio tinker the fairly solid 'eurotrance' songs together, singer Natalie Horler provides them with easy-to-hearâ€¦ lyrics. With success, because Cascada not only scores big hits in Europe, the group is also popular in the United States. On the debut album Everytime We Touch, besides the hits Miracle and Everytime We Touch, there are also quite a few covers. Such as How Do You Do by Roxette, Kids In America by Kim Wilde and Wouldn't It Be Good by Nik Kershaw, which have a typical 'Cascada sound'. Because every song continues in the same way, an entire CD quickly becomes somewhat uniform. To interrupt this, there are also some quiet tracks, for example Truly Madly Deeply (Savage Garden), Another You and the title track in a Candlelight Mix. (IV)more
