Eurodance group Cascada burst onto the scene in the early 2000s and became known for hits including Everytime We Touch and Miracle.

However, some fans may not know DJ Manian, DJ Yanou and Natalie Horler founded the group as a trio, with the British-German star as the lead singer rather than a solo act called Cascada.

''We actually are a group. I work with two producers [Yanou and Manian] and the three of us make up Cascada," she previously explained in an old interview.

"They've always chosen to stay low-profile where I've always been the face of everything, that's why sometimes there's a misconception."

What is Cascada's biggest hit?

The group is one of the most successful acts to come out of Germany.

Horler previously told Just Jared in an interview about having so many smash hits with Cascada that stand the test of time, that she "can't understand it either ".

She said she keeps fit to keep up her youthful performances on stage.

"I'm still really young spirited. I make sure I keep fit. I do a stage performance that I could easily have done 10, 15 years ago," she said.

She added: "I hope that no one feels that they have an older artist in front of them ."

Horler lives in Germany with husband Moritz Raffelberg, who she married in 2011, they share a daughter together.

The pair are notoriously private when it comes to their personal lives.

Net worth

Eurovision

In 2013, Cascada was the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.

"For me, it's a very, very big honour to be able to participate. Going on stage for an entire country is a lot of pressure. But it's also very, very special," Horler told DW.com.

At the time, there were rumours their entry song Glorious was plagiarised, which Horler said ''upset" her.
