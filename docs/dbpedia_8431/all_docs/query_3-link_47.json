        "text": "Vengeance toward the party he left in the 1990s over its EU policy appeared to be at least part of Farage’s motivation — alongside sheer enjoyment of his ability to foment chaos.\n\nHe invited voters to send him to parliament to cause “a bloody nuisance,” sounding as if he was picking himself up by the scruff of his signature covert coat and giving it a shake.\n\nThe second coming\n\nUntil that point, the 2024 election had promised to be a battle of the nerds.\n\nAllies of both Sunak and the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, admit they are competent grafters rather than showmen. Both sides argue that’s exactly what’s needed to turn the stuttering U.K. economy around.\n\nBut their lack of pizzazz left the field wide open for a charismatic — or repellent, depending on your view — figure to “ginger up” the campaign, as Farage memorably put it.\n\nFarage’s galvanizing effect was obvious last week as crowds descended upon Clacton, the seaside town in Essex where he’d chosen to stand. (It was an obvious choice — Clacton had elected UKIP’s sole MP back in the early 2010s.)\n\nFarage’s arrival was, said one admiring onlooker, “like Jesus has turned up.” Another attendee — less supportive — made their feelings clear by upending a milkshake over Farage’s head. Chaos ensued.\n\nThese headline-grabbing scenes — Farage was later mobbed in a pub — revived a persistent worry from Farage’s liberal detractors, that he is at least partly a media creation, and that his anti-immigration views would gain less traction if everyone just ignored him.\n\nFarage’s decision to stand for parliament means he cannot be ignored altogether, and means more scrutiny of what he actually stands for.\n\nReform is clear what it’s against: immigration, the net zero climate target, political correctness, criticism of Britain’s role in history. But asked by POLITICO what their positive vision for the country looks like, Reform’s flagbearers alluded vaguely to a return to Britain’s supposed former glory.\n\nFarage spoke of “a freer Britain” where the “little man” can flourish. Anderson said he wanted to see “a country where we’re not ashamed of our history, our heritage, our culture.”\n\nSome see an implicit racism in this rhetoric, a dividing line between British and non-British. Supporters dismiss such concerns as liberal nonsense, and lap it up.\n\nChallenged on claims by Tory Party veteran Michael Heseltine — and indeed some members of the public at the Clacton rally — that he and his party are “racist,” Farage told POLITICO this was a “ludicrous” accusation and “an excuse for not having a debate.”\n\nLike other dominant figures on the right, Farage dismisses most questions on his controversial positions as the bleating of a “woke” elite. And since he has never had to face the inconvenience of governing — nor even representing a constituency — he has no real record against which to be measured.\n\nReform is hoping that will change on July 4.\n\nNext stop Downing Street?\n\nFarage is outwardly bullish about his party’s chances at the election, predicting it will win more than one parliamentary seat — even as aides privately admit this is unlikely.\n\nAs was frequently the case with UKIP, Britain electoral system and the geographical spread of the party’s support means Reform could stack up millions of votes while winning precisely zero individual seats.\n\nBut those millions of votes have a power of their own, taking right-wing support away from the Tories and potentially costing them dozens of other close-fought seats. This threat meant both UKIP and the Brexit Party were frequently effective at forcing Conservative leaders to change policy, without any presence in the House of Commons.\n\nBut Reform’s future may live and die with Farage’s personal battle in Clacton, a seat currently held by the Conservatives. If he is thwarted again it will be a personal repudiation from which he will find it difficult to return.\n\nAnd if he finally wins election to the House of Commons, it could be a game-changer for his fledgling party.\n\nSecuring a seat in parliament — plus at least 150,000 votes — would mean Reform qualifies for Short Money, a formal parliamentary scheme under which opposition parties are awarded significant public funds to carry out their duties.\n\nThe party is also far more likely to attract donors under his banner, joining wealthy existing supporters such as plumbing magnate Charlie Mullins and Holly Valance, the pop singer and celebrity wife of property developer Nick Candy.\n\nFarage’s election would also introduce the specter, as his friend Towler puts it, of the Reform leader “wandering around [parliament], having a drink here and there, sitting on the smoking terrace, chatting to everybody.”\n\nMight further Tories defect? “The whips of the other parties will be crapping themselves,” Towler chuckled.\n\nThe time is ripe for such an intervention, according to Henry Hill, acting editor of the ConservativeHome website, an online bible for Tory activists.\n\n“I’ve been hearing from Conservative candidates that since Farage’s announcement, they’ve had actual activists just walk out and join Reform,” he said.\n\nHill said the party of government was facing a major problem with its core supporters, in that “pretty much no matter what wing of the Conservative Party you’re on, the last 14 years have been a disappointment.”\n\nWilson, Reform’s London Assembly Member, confessed that he had admired Farage even when he was still a Tory member, helping to crunch numbers inside CCHQ. He said a lot of fellow Tory officials inside the party felt the same.\n\nIf he gains that crucial foot in the door, Farage’s stated ambition is to use his new platform as a launchpad for Reform to become Britain’s main right-wing party of opposition by 2029 — or even to cannibalize the Conservative Party from within.\n\nSeasoned strategists believe he could do it.\n\nAndrew Cooper, former senior aide David Cameron and a non-affiliated peer, predicted that if an elected Nigel Farage was ever allowed to join the Tory Party and made it onto a leadership ballot, “it’s absolutely certain” that he would win.\n\nFarage himself has leant into the idea of some sort of Tory/Reform merger amid the ashes of what looks likely to be a crushing election defeat for the ruling party.\n\n“Something new is going to emerge on the center-right,” he told LBC Radio Thursday.\n\n“I don’t know what it’s called — but do I think I could end up leading a national opposition to a Labour party with a big majority, where I can stand up and hold them to account on issues? Yes.”\n\nThe extraordinary career of one of Britain’s most influential postwar politicians still has some way to run."
