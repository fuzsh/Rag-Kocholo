        "text": "Teachers\n\nThe FTE number of teachers increased marginally to 468,700 in 2023/24. This is an increase of 300 (<0.1%) from last year, and an increase of 27,300 (6%) since 2010/11. Headcount of teachers also increased; by 1,900 to 513,900 in the latest year.\n\nMost teachers held qualified teacher status (97%), the same as previous years. Teachers may be undertaking further qualifications during their employment to gain qualified teacher status.\n\nThe type of school in which teachers worked was split evenly between nurseries/primary and secondary schools; 47% (218,500) of teachers worked in nurseries and primary schools, 46% (217,600) in secondary schools, 6% (28,200) in special schools and state-funded alternative provision schools including PRUs. 1% (4,400) were centrally employed by a local authority.\n\nFurther information on numbers of teachers in the UK, including non-maintained schools in England, can be found in the Education and Training Statistics for the UK accredited official statistics.\n\nSupport staff\n\nSupport staff are categorised into posts of teaching assistants, administrative staff, auxiliary staff, technicians and other supporting staff, plus two new posts of school business professional and leadership non-teacher reported for the first time in 2023/24.\n\nSchool business professionals include roles such as bursar, business manager, finance officer, office manager, premises manager or ICT network manager.\n\nLeadership non-teachers are members of the school's senior leadership team who are not reported in a teaching post.\n\nThese new posts have displaced reporting from other posts, particularly administrative staff.\n\nThe FTE of support staff has increased each year since 2019/20, to 510,400 in 2023/24, and has now passed the previous peak of 2015/16. This is an increase of 4,800 (0.9%) since last year. This increase is mainly due to an increase of 2,400 in other support staff.\n\nMore support staff work part-time than is the case for teachers, this results in very different numbers for FTE and headcount. Approximately 5 in 10 technicians, 6 in 10 administrative staff and other school support staff, 8 in 10 teaching assistants, and 9 in 10 auxiliary staff work part time.\n\nTwo thirds (66%) of teaching assistants work in primary schools, and 16% work in special schools and pupil referral units. The majority of technicians work in secondary schools, 92%.\n\nInformation on support staff was collected in the school workforce census for the first time in 2011/12. Please follow this link to FTE for support staff by role.\n\nOccasional teachers and third party support staff\n\nThe school workforce census does not identify supply teachers or support staff. However, teachers and support staff who are not directly employed by the school or local authority and who are in school on census day (early November each year) with a contract or service agreement lasting fewer than 28 days are recorded as ‘occasional’ teachers and ‘third party support staff’ respectively.\n\nIn November 2023, schools reported 15,777 occasional teachers (headcount) on census day. This is down from the previous year when 16,594 were reported. Their headcount by Qualified Teacher Status is available in the data catalogue for each individual school.\n\nIn November 2023, schools reported 48,476 third party support staff (headcount) on census day. This is down from the previous year when 49,420 were reported. Their headcount by post is available in the data catalogue for each individual school.\n\nEducational Psychologists\n\nThe school workforce census asks local authorities to report the number of educational psychologists they employ. This does not include where the service has been outsourced or shared between local authorities. For information on the data collection and limitations, please see this publication’s methodology. The headcount and FTE of these educational psychologists, by local authority, is available in the data catalogue.\n\nIn November 2023, local authorities reported employing 2,546 educational psychologists (2,102 FTE) on census day. This is slightly up on the previous year, 2,325 (1,939 FTE). Data by local authority and working pattern is available to download from the data catalogue.\n\nEthnicity\n\nThe ethnic diversity of the teacher workforce continues to increase, with 16.2% of teachers identifying as belonging to an ethnic minority group, up from 11.2% in 2010/11. Within these percentages, white minorities accounted for 5.3% of teachers,\n\nThe proportion of teachers who identify as Asian or Asian British has increased by 2.3 percentage points since 2010/11, to 5.5% of the workforce. Over the same period, Black or Black British has increased by 0.8 percentage points to 2.7% and Any Other Mixed Background by one percentage point to 1.8%.\n\nIn the 2021 Census (opens in a new tab), 10.1% of the working age population were Asian or Asian British, 8.8% white minority groups, and 4.4% Black or Black British.\n\nTeachers identifying in an ethnic minority group are not equally represented at leadership positions (heads, deputy heads, assistant heads). In 2023/24, 15.9% of White British, 11.1% of White Minorities, 10.0% of Black or Black British and 8.3% of Asian or Asian British teachers were in leadership positions. This has changed over time; in 2010/11, 13.9% of White British, 8.0% of White Minorities, 8.1% of Black or Black British and 6.5% of Asian or Asian British teachers were in leadership positions. For a deeper analysis of ethnicity in teacher leadership positions see School leadership in England 2010 to 2020: characteristics and trends. (opens in a new tab)\n\nThis section presents key support staff characteristics. Further breakdowns of staff characteristics (such as by school phase /type and working pattern) are available to download from the data catalogue, or you can create your own tables in our table tool via the green ‘Explore data’ buttons.\n\nWe discuss headcount in this section, rather than FTE. This is so that we can consider the characteristics of the workforce without differences in working pattern influencing the figures.\n\nSupport staff post\n\nThe number of teaching assistants has increased almost every year since 2011/12 (when information on support staff was first collected in the census), from 221,500 to 282,900 in 2023/24 (up 28%). The numbers of teaching assistants and other school support staff are now the highest since the inclusion of support staff in the school workforce census in 2011/12.\n\nTechnicians and auxiliary staff have decreased each year since 2013/14 and 2015/16, respectively. The new reporting of school business professionals in 2022/23 primarily reduced administrative staff figures, but decreased technicians and auxiliary staff as well.\n\nMore support staff work part-time than is the case for teachers, this results in very different numbers for FTE and headcount. Approximately 9 in 10 auxiliary staff, 8 in 10 teaching assistants, 7 in 10 leadership non-teachers, 6 in 10 administrative staff and school business professionals, and 5 in 10 technicians and other school support staff work part time.\n\nOver two thirds (69%) of teaching assistants work in primary schools, with 15% in secondary schools and 14% in special schools and state-funded alternative provision schools including PRUs. The majority of technicians work in secondary schools, 92%.\n\nThe rates and numbers of entrants to the state-funded teaching profession in England have decreased this year, while the rates and numbers of leavers from to the state-funded teaching profession in England have remained stable. While leavers have returned to pre-pandemic levels, entrants have returned to figures similar to 2021/22.\n\nEach year, the number of teachers entering state-funded schools in England is higher than those leaving. In the most recent year there were 480 FTE more entrants than leavers. This, coupled with existing staff overall reducing their working pattern and increase in unqualified teachers, means that the overall FTE of teachers has increased by 300 FTE.\n\nFurther breakdowns of this information, including by age, ethnicity, gender, teaching post, type of entrant/leaver, school type and working pattern are available to download from the data catalogue, or you can create your own tables in our table tool via the green “explore data” buttons.\n\nEntrants\n\n44,000 teachers joined the state-funded school sector for 2023/24, down 3,900 since last year. This represents 1 in 10 (9.7%) of all qualified teachers; the rate and number are comparable to 2021/22.\n\nNewly qualified teachers make up a smaller proportion of entrants this year (41% versus 45% last year). Returners and entrants new to the state funded sector have increased, but deferred newly qualified entrants have decreased.\n\nEntrants have decreased in both primary and secondary school phases, however the trends in entrant types differ. In primary schools there has been a decrease in all entrant types except entrants new to state funded sector which has a small increase. In secondary schools newly qualified entrants and deferred newly qualified entrants have decreased, but both returners and entrants new to state funded sector have increased. This decrease of newly qualified entrants corresponds with the Initial Teacher Training Census.\n\nEach year, the year-on-year comparisons of teacher pay based on School Workforce Census data will not directly reflect annual pay awards for a number of reasons.\n\nWhile the annual uplifts to pay ranges in the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) for the present academic year are proposed and agreed at a national level, it is for schools to determine pay for teachers on an individual level, with these decisions incorporating schools’ pay flexibilities to deviate from the national framework, as well as teachers’ performance reviews. Such individual decisions may not have been made for all teachers by the point at which the census occurs. Therefore, some schools report data reflecting the latest pay review, but some report that of the previous academic year (without the outcome of the latest pay review applied). This is likely to be more common this year, given that the consultation process and publication of the STPCD concluded 13th October. This was later than in previous years and two weeks before the Census date, which may have delayed pay decisions more than in other years. For further information about the process by which the pay award is agreed and how this relates to the School Workforce Census collection, please see the methodology.\n\nThis year alternative estimates of teacher pay have been published as ad hoc statistics in Median teacher pay using teacher pension scheme (TPS) data. This uses administrative TPS data which is collected in the process of managing the contributions of teachers and their employers to pensions. Unlike the SWC, which provides a snapshot of data on the census date, the TPS data is retrospectively updated with any pay decisions that were backdated to before the census date in November each year. The ad hoc publication is intended to provide an estimate that is more representative of teachers' pay after the award is fully implemented. We welcome feedback from users on the quality and relevance of these estimates to inform future plans on teacher pay statistics, please see the “Contact us” section of either publication.\n\nIn addition, each year there are workforce changes which mean comparisons between years are not comparing like-for-like. For example, each year teachers retire and are replaced by newly qualified teachers. These more experienced teachers, many of whom will have been in leadership roles, will have been on higher salaries than those who are new to teaching.\n\nNote that salaries are not adjusted for inflation over time.\n\nThe average (median) teacher FTE salary reported in November 2023, by grade:\n\nClassroom teacher average salary was £43,100.\n\nOther leadership teacher (excluding headteachers) average salary was £60,500.\n\nHead teacher average salary was £75,300.\n\nFor further information on school and LA expenditure, including spend on teaching, please see the latest expenditure publication."
