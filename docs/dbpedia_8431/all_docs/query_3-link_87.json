        "text": "\"I was honoured to be part of a recent #TeamGP Perspectives podcast on GP wellbeing in which we reflected on our own experiences and used them to help explain how we have managed to turn negative experiences into positive ones. We also discussed how sharing our own lived experiences can not only be cathartic but also a source of inspiration to others who may be struggling. We need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. If we fail to prepare, we need to prepare to fail. It has never been more important to look after ourselves and our colleagues, and band together as a profession.\"\n\n\"For the last six years I have been a nationally elected member of the RCGP Council – a position I had never considered until I had the experience of being a partner in a failing practice. This led me to want to try to make a difference for other GPs and I was surprised and honoured to be elected. I have embraced the opportunity to speak for front-line GPs particularly on issues around workload and workforce. I have also had the privilege to be involved with the RCGP patient and carers partnership group, benefitting from the wisdom of the group both within and outside the college. I do believe that we can create opportunities for serendipitous events to evolve – just get out there, connect, collaborate, and light a spark.\"\n\n“Connecting with my local Faculty as a trainee provided me with a network of supportive colleagues with their own interests, experiences and a shared common passion for providing the highest quality of general practice. My interest in the intersection between the environment and health inequalities is increasingly integrated into college work, and I have enjoyed robust but respectful debates with frontline colleagues since becoming UK Council rep for East Scotland. There is much work to do to improve conditions for GPs, but the commitment of my colleagues gives me hope. I have no doubt general practice would be in a far worse state were it not for RCGP work. I hope you find the College a place where you find support and have your voice heard like I have.”\n\n\"My first interaction with the College was as a specialty trainee and in my early years as a locum, when I started attending their events. If I’m really honest, I didn’t consider the relevance of RCGPNI prior to getting a bit more involved. It’s only in the past few years I’ve realised how supportive they are of their members and how important a role they have to play through their educational events, helpful advice, and political engagement. More recently I have been working with the college to explain what Conversion Therapy is and the issues that exist around it.\"\n\n\"This year I have taken part in the RCGP Shaping the Future leadership programme. This has been a fantastic opportunity to develop my leadership skills via online modules and small group discussions. I have also had the chance to hear from some inspiring primary care leaders and to interact with colleagues at all stages of their careers who are also interested in primary care leadership. I am now really excited to apply what I have learnt in this programme to my current leadership roles, and to further explore the variety of roles that are available during my GP training and beyond. I hope that I can continue to build upon and apply what I have learnt and be a successful leader.\"\n\n\"As an advocate for my colleagues during training, I continue to represent GPs both on the Midland Faculty Board and as a member of the BMA regional council. As a GP with special interests in dermatology, minor surgery, and aesthetics, I see the value portfolio careers offer for recruitment and retention. As the First5 network facilitator for my training hub, I encourage and empower my colleagues with their career aspirations. As an associate non-executive Director for our local acute trust, I am now working to address health inequities locally.\"\n\n“I have been working as Joint Clinical Rep at the RCGP since 2018. The most rewarding aspect of the role is attending committees and boards for national workstreams and programmes, which gives a fantastic insight into strategic direction and opportunity to learn and work with colleagues from many and varied settings. It is a privilege to be able to represent the primary care perspective and support primary care colleagues through influencing direction of the above.”\n\n\"Being a volunteer Ambassador for Health and Wellbeing at parkrun for 4 years has been transformational for me, my staff, and my patients. My involvement with parkrun has enabled me to meet so many wonderful people in my community. I’ve encouraged over 100 of my patients to come down to my local parkrun in Southport and I’ve seen lives transformed – hypertension controlled, mental health improved, confidence and self-esteem grown, simply by coming along to parkrun. I’ve made great friends and bumping into patients has helped me appreciate them as people, set in context rather than simply as 'patients'.\""
