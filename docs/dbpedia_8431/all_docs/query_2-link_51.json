        "text": "An investigation by the Met Counter Terrorism Command, following the use of powers under Schedule 7 at an airport, has led to the conviction of a man for sharing terrorist documents.\n\nZaheed Hossen, 30 (12.01.1994) from north London, was found guilty on Thursday, 8 August of five counts of disseminating terrorist publications following a two week and four day trial at Kingston Crown Court.\n\nCommander Dominic Murphy, Head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, said: “This investigation came about after officers stopped Hossen using ‘Schedule 7’ powers as he travelled through the airport. These powers help us to identify potential terrorist activity and they ultimately help us to keep the public and UK safe. We’ve seen that the sharing of terrorist material can cause great harm and damage and we would encourage anybody who spots terrorist or extremist material online to ACT and report it to us, so we can take appropriate action.”\n\nAnyone who see terrorist or extremist content online can report it to police via www.gov.uk/ACT\n\nPolice began their investigation into Hossen back in August 2020 after he was stopped and examined by officers as he was travelling from Stansted airport on his way to Turkey. Using powers under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, 2000, officers stopped and spoke with him.\n\nHossen was allowed to go on his way at that time, but officers seized his phone to carry out further enquiries into the material they identified. Upon returning to the UK, Hossen was arrested for suspected possession of material that was deemed to breach terrorism legislation. When asked about the material by officers, Hossen denied any knowledge of it and he was released on bail while detectives carried out further enquiries.\n\nThe investigation continued whilst Hossen was on bail. Enquiries identified further offences in relation to sharing terrorist-related documents with others.\n\nFollowing a referral to the Crown Prosecution Service, Hossen was charged with five counts of disseminating terrorist material and initially appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 3 February 2023.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty and the case progressed to trial, resulting in him being convicted for these offences. Sentencing will take place on 17 October 2024."
