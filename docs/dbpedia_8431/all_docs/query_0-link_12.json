        "text": "Starmer and his wife enter 10 Downing Street for the first time\n\nAfter making his first address as Prime Minister, Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, greeted by staff and civil servants on Friday.\n\nWhat will Keir Starmer’s leadership mean for the world?\n\nEver since the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, there has been a perennial debate about Britain’s place in the world.\n\nThere are some who believed that Brexit would lead to the UK having a diminished voice on the world stage, despite still being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a G7 economy and a nuclear power.\n\nIt’s hard to quantify exactly how much power any country has, but arguably the biggest hinderance to the UK’s international influence has been the domestic political chaos and instability since 2016.\n\nThe logic goes that if you cannot provide certainty at home, what you say on international issues doesn’t carry much weight.\n\nDiplomats often point to the relative stability of a country like Ireland, whose political consistency, particularly on foreign affairs, affords its diplomats disproportionate heft, compared to say Australia, who went through a period of political instability which saw it lose influence.\n\nIt’s not an exact science, but political stability matters to your allies. Starmer can now as good as guarantee five years of consistency to the world, which will mean his views on foreign affairs can be taken seriously.\n\nOn Ukraine, Starmer is expected to maintain the UK government’s support.\n\nHe has said Israel has a right to defend itself, but it is expected that he will come under pressure to restrict arms sales if they are being used to commit war crimes.\n\nHe has said that he wants to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, but has ruled out rejoining the EU or any of its institutions.\n\nHow the return of Farage created a nightmare for the Tories\n\nAfter Britain left the European Union in 2020 – a cause he had championed for three decades – Nigel Farage retreated from frontline politics. When his fledgling Brexit party renamed itself as Reform UK, he slunk into the role of party chairman – still a political force, but a dormant one.\n\nJust weeks ago, it looked set to stay that way. Farage initially said he would not stand in this election, and that he would instead “help with the grassroots campaign” in the US, presumably to try to reelect former President Donald Trump.\n\nThis came as a relief to the Conservatives, who had long feared losing their more right-wing voters to Reform. But, lacking a recognizable leader, Reform looked set to be a disparate protest vote, failing to pose a real electoral challenge to the Tories.\n\nThen, everything changed. Farage said at the start of June that he was set to make an “emergency announcement,” striking fear into Conservative HQ.\n\nHe went on to win the seat comfortably, finally being elected Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts.\n\nFarage’s return injected energy into the Reform campaign and skewed the electoral arithmetic. While Reform won just four seats, it secured millions of votes, potentially costing the Conservative dozens of constituencies by splitting the vote on the right.\n\nIn the past, the Conservative Party has seen off the Faragist threat by adopting his policies. The much-diminished party now faces a similar choice: Does it try to bury Reform, or bed it?\n\nFinal results not expected until Saturday after recount in Scottish seat\n\nThe final result of the UK’s general election will likely be delayed until Saturday after a recount was called in a constituency in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nThe outcome in Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire was expected early Friday morning, before it was announced that a second recount was required and would be held Saturday.\n\nThe seat was held by the Scottish National Party in the outgoing parliament on a majority of more than 12,000.\n\nWe are also still waiting on the result from South Basildon and East Thurrock – which is expected to be held by the Conservatives – meaning just two seats out of 650 are outstanding.\n\nHere’s a reminder of the results so far:\n\nLabour: 412\n\nConservatives: 121\n\nLiberal Democrats: 71\n\nScottish National Party: 9\n\nSinn Féin: 7\n\nIndependent: 6\n\nGreen Party: 4\n\nReform: 4\n\nPlaid Cymru: 4\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party: 4\n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party: 2\n\nAlliance Party of Northern Ireland: 1\n\nUlster Unionist Party: 1\n\nTraditional Unionist Voice: 1\n\nMeet Victoria Starmer, wife of new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n\nThe British public has elected a new government, and with that a new family will be moving into 10 Downing Street.\n\nUnlike some other countries, such as the United States, when a new British prime minister comes to power, the transition into both the new role and home happens almost immediately.\n\nThat means, not only will Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, be settling into his home down the road from the Houses of Parliament, but so will his wife, Victoria, and their two teenage children.\n\nStarmer’s wife, whom he usually refers to as Vic, kept a relatively low profile during the election campaign, but she was at his side on Friday as he arrived at Downing Street for the first time as prime minister.\n\nSo, who is Victoria Starmer, and what do we know about the new occupants of 10 Downing Street?\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAt the scene: Keir Starmer's first speech as PM\n\nLittle more than an hour separated Keir Starmer’s speech from Rishi Sunak’s, but the mood outside Downing Street could not have been more dramatically different.\n\nA crowd of Labour staffers and their family members gathered a few steps from the Number 10 door while Starmer was at Buckingham Palace, some holding Union Jack umbrellas, others waving flags.\n\nAt one point a member of staff handed out Scottish and Welsh flags, after an election that saw Labour overturn a deficit to the Scottish National Party north of the border. The “One Nation” optics drew a clear parallel to Tony Blair’s Labour victory.\n\nEven Larry the cat, Downing Street’s beloved demouser-in-chief, broke out of his midday nap on the pavement and limbered up for his new housemate, doing a few laps of the street before slipping back inside.\n\nThe helicopter circling overhead and the increasingly enthused cheers from the amassed crowd signalled Starmer’s arrival, and the ever-serious politician appeared relaxed, the burden of campaigning lifted, as he took his time greeting them on arrival.\n\nHis speech was statesmanlike if not exactly soaring, the energy dipping slightly as he reached for well-worn phrases already used in countless campaign speeches.\n\nThere was no new, surprising side to Starmer that emerged - perhaps none ever will. But Starmer ended on a powerful note, promising his government’s “urgent work” will “begin today.”\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration: Starmer has decisions to make about his Cabinet, and while his majority is almost historic, he must face a public eager to see results after a fragile coalition of voters saw him into Downing Street.\n\nBut those are conversations for another day. Friday belongs to Keir Starmer, Britain’s new, uniquely powerful prime minister.\n\nStarmer pledges to steer UK toward \"calmer waters\"\n\nWrapping his speech, Starmer pledged to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” after 14 often turbulent years of Conservative rule.\n\n“If I asked you now whether you believe that Britain will be better for your children, I know too many of you would say no,” he said, pledging to fight “until you believe again.”\n\nStarmer said his government would try to “defy, quietly, those who have written our country off.\n\nHe said the four nations of the United Kingdom would stand together as they confront “the challenges of an insecure world, committed to a calm and patient rebuilding.”\n\nStarmer pledges to heal the \"weariness in the heart\" of Britain\n\nKeir Starmer said the country voted “decisively for change, and a return of politics to public service.”\n\n“When the gap between the sacrifices made by people and the service they receive from politicians grows this big, it leads to a weariness in the heart of a nation, a draining away of the hope, the spirit, the belief in a better future, that we need to move forward together,” Starmer said.\n\nThis wound, Starmer said, “can only be healed by action, not words.”\n\nHe said he intends to start work right away “with the simple acknowledgement that public service is a privilege and that this government should treat every single person in this country with respect.”\n\nStarmer praises predecessor Sunak in first speech\n\nNew UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised his predecessor Rishi Sunak in his first speech as prime minister.\n\nAfter confirming he’d accepted an invitation to form a government following a landslide win, Labour leader Starmer recognized the “extra effort” Sunak made in becoming the country’s first Asian prime minister.\n\n“And we also recognize the dedication and hard work he brought to his leadership,” added Starmer.\n\nStarmer to make first address to nation as prime minister\n\nThe UK’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to address the nation from outside Downing Street shortly.\n\nStarmer has just had an audience with King Charles at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch invited him to form the next government.\n\nHe’s now left the palace and is on his way to his new home.\n\nWhat is the King’s role in the election?\n\nYou may have noticed King Charles III hasn’t been out and about quite as much over the last six weeks. It’s not for the reason you think.\n\nSoon after Rishi Sunak called for a general election, Buckingham Palace announced the family would postpone engagements “which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign,” since the royals must stay neutral and above politics.\n\nThe King has spent the past few days in Scotland for “Holyrood Week,” an annual celebration in the royal calendar recognizing Scottish culture and community.\n\nHowever, he was needed back in London on Friday to invite the leader of the party that won the most seats in the House of Commons to Buckingham Palace.\n\nDuring Kier Starmer’s audience with Charles, he will become become prime minister and be invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nSunak lacked vision and experience, says leading PM biographer\n\nAntony Seldon has written biographies of Britain’s last eight consecutive prime ministers, but the recent churn of leaders has left him “a bit jaded.”\n\nBoris Johnson, who won the last general election in 2019, was “so awful.” Liz Truss was “just hopeless – but very destructive and fascinating.”\n\nHow did Sunak stack up against his predecessors? Seldon sees two clear flaws with his brief premiership: lack of vision, and inexperience.\n\nPainting with a broad brush, Seldon describes Johnson, with his focus on infrastructure, as “Rooseveltian;” Truss, with her penchant for libertarian economics, as “Reaganite;” and Sunak, a fan of tight money, as “kind of Hooverite.”\n\nBut he struggles to ascribe a broader strategy to Sunak. As a result, his signature policies – putting some chess boards in parks, encouraging young people to study math to 18, banning smoking – have felt “pretty micro.”\n\nRather than implementing major policies of his own, Sunak canceled ones already underway: a high-speed train between London and other major cities, and rolling back Britain’s pledges to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd, entering 10 Downing Street just seven years after becoming a Member of Parliament, Sunak “was never blooded, never had to reflect on the whole range of what a government does, the opposition does.”\n\nStarmer arrives at Buckingham Palace for audience with the King\n\nKeir Starmer has arrived at Buckingham Palace with his wife, Victoria, where they were welcomed into the King’s door for an audience with Charles III.\n\nAfter the process known as “the kissing of hands,” Starmer will be invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nWhen he leaves the palace, Starmer will have become the 58th prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nGreen Party quadruples number of seats in strong showing\n\nThe Green Party won four seats in parliament, three more than at the last election in 2019, receiving 6.8% of the popular vote.\n\nWhile the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats and it succeeded in all four.\n\nThe Greens won comfortably in Brighton Pavilion, their long-time and, until now, only stronghold, and managed to take two seats away from the Conservatives in the rural constituencies of North Herefordshire and Waveney Valley.\n\nThe Greens also won in Bristol Central, where party co-leader Carla Denyer ran against Labour candidate Thangam Debbonaire, who was first elected an MP in 2015 and was expected to become Culture Secretary in the new Labour government.\n\nDenyer thanked voters in a post on X.\n\n“As this city’s first Green MP, I promise to be a strong, independent voice for Bristol’s values, pushing the govt to be bolder on the issues that matter,” she wrote.\n\nRishi Sunak formally tenders resignation to King Charles\n\nRishi Sunak is no longer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, having formally tendered his resignation to the King during an audience at Buckingham Palace.\n\nSunak was pictured along with his wife, Akshata Murty, leaving Buckingham Palace.\n\nIncoming Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet the King next and officially take power.\n\nStarmer set for morning meeting with the King\n\nKeir Starmer will soon become the third prime minister of King Charles III’s reign. When Charles acceded the throne in 2022, Liz Truss had been in office for 48 hours. Just 49 days later, Sunak replaced her. So, how does this next part play out?\n\nAs head of state, appointing new prime ministers is one of Charles’s core constitutional duties, along with the State Opening of Parliament and signing parliamentary bills into law.\n\nSunak will head to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation and for a final farewell audience with the monarch. Little is known about what happens at this meeting.\n\nGordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister in office between 2007 and 2010, said in his memoir that his last PM meeting with the late Elizabeth II didn’t involve handing over seals of office, but “simply saying goodbye to the Queen – and thanking her.”\n\nIn his autobiography, “My Life, Our Times,” he said “as usual, she was charming and the occasion itself was relaxed.” Brown recalled how the Queen permitted his two young sons to be present when he received a parting gift – an inscribed photograph of the monarch.\n\nShortly after, Starmer will travel over to the royal residence for a process known as “the kissing of hands.” The old ceremony reflects loyalty to the sovereign, but the kissing is not expected these days. Starmer will then be invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nThe transition is a relatively quick process, taking about half an hour. Once back, we’ll get Starmer’s first address to the nation from outside Downing Street.\n\nAt the scene: Sunak's final speech as British prime minister\n\nRishi Sunak fired the starting gun on his six-week downfall in the rain. His premiership ended on Friday morning, in a drizzle.\n\nThere were plenty of umbrellas unfurled among the media masses opposite Downing Street’s famous black door — an instrument infamously ignored by the outgoing prime minister when he called the election at the end of May.\n\nBut at least the worst of the rain had cleared, averting the prospect of Sunak’s speech being hurriedly moved inside.\n\nIn the windows above Downing Street, as Sunak said his final goodbyes inside, the lights were on and the silhouettes of staff members flashed by, occasionally fiddling with the blinds.\n\nFor Sunak and for most of his political appointees, this will be their final moments inside the famous building. The handover in power in British politics is infamously sudden.\n\nThen he emerged, with his wife a few paces behind as he took to the podium. It was a cleaner speech than six weeks ago. He sounded humbled and apologetic.\n\nBut a protestor could clearly be heard shouting “Tories Out!” as Sunak delivered his final words, Sunak tapping his left foot hurriedly as he did so.\n\nWith a touch of poetic humor, the clouds did at last part over Sunak’s head as he neared the end of his speech. After a miserable, gray morning, the sky noticeably brightened over Downing Street seconds after Sunak’s departure.\n\n“I have heard your anger,” Sunak says in contrite farewell speech\n\nMore now on Rishi Sunak’s farewell speech from Downing Street.\n\nThe outgoing PM said he had heard the “anger” of British voters, who delivered his Conservative Party its worst-ever defeat, and apologized to the candidates who had lost their seats.\n\nSunak announced he will step down as party leader in the near future. Reflecting on his 21-month premiership, Sunak said he had “returned stability to our economy” and rebuilt Britain’s relations with its allies.\n\nHe singled out a major deal he struck to normalize relations between the UK and European Union in the wake of Brexit - a policy he championed - as another of his achievements.\n\nSunak wished Labour leader Keir Starmer success when he becomes prime minister later Friday.\n\nFinally, Sunak – the first British Asian prime minister – reflected on his background.\n\nPerhaps in a nod toward the surge in support for the hard-right Reform UK party, Sunak said: “We must hold true to that idea of who we are – that vision of kindness, decency and tolerance that has always been the British way.”\n\nBREAKING: Sunak pledges to step down as Conservative leader after landslide election loss\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that he will step down as leader of the Conservative party after losing the election in a landslide.\n\n“Following this result, I will step down as party leader,” he said, a move that will trigger a contest to become next Conservative leader.\n\n“To the country, I would like to say first and foremost: I am sorry,” he said in an address to the British public outside Downing Street to mark the end of his time in office.\n\n“I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters,” added Sunak.\n\nHis party was routed by the opposition Labour party and squeezed by the Nigel Farage-led Reform Party and the resurgent centrist Liberal Democrats.\n\nSeveral Conservative cabinet ministers lost their seats and the party must now decide how to respond to the challenges of opposition.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to address public from Downing Street\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak is to make a statement as he prepares to make way for election winner Keir Starmer to form a government.\n\nA podium has been set up outside Downing Street, with Sunak expected to address the public shortly.\n\nNationalist Sinn Féin party becomes largest Northern Irish party in Westminster parliament\n\nSinn Féin has become largest Northern Irish party in the Westminster parliament after a historic showing in the UK general election.\n\nNorthern Irish politicians can choose to either run for a seat in the Westminster parliament or for a seat in the devolved legislature, the Northern Ireland Assembly, referred to as Stormont.\n\nThe Assembly passes laws regarding policy areas such as health, education and policing whilst the Westminster parliament presides over issues which have not been devolved including foreign policy and defense.\n\nThe nationalist Sinn Féin party, which advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south, succeeded in winning seven out of the 18 available seats in the Westminster parliament.\n\nAfter a sweeping victory in Assembly elections held in 2022, Sinn Féin now has the largest number of seats for a Northern Ireland party in both Westminster and Stormont.\n\nSinn Féin MPs do not take up their seats in the Westminster parliament as part of the party’s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland.\n\nThe party’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill hailed their success in a social media post on Friday, thanking voters for “endorsing Sinn Féin candidates who will work hard for you every day and lead positive change for everyone.”\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the leading Unionist party which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, won five seats in total, losing some long-held seats in stronghold areas.\n\nThe UK’s transfer of power is an exercise of ruthless efficiency\n\nSomewhere in London, a removal van will soon start trundling towards Westminster. Desks will be cleared, photographs will be taken down, closets will be emptied. By this evening, 10 Downing Street will have a new resident.\n\nIn other countries, the gap between an election to the formation of a new government can take months. In the United Kingdom, power is transferred with ruthless efficiency.\n\nIn the coming hours, Sunak is expected to give a resignation speech; Starmer is expected to give a victory one; both are expected to visit Buckingham Palace.\n\nBy the afternoon, the conversation will have shifted to the makeup of Starmer’s government. We’ll be bringing you the latest until then.\n\nUK election marked by low turnout with some 40% of British voters skipping the vote\n\nLabour might have won a big majority in the parliament, but once the celebrations end, the party will need to ask itself a tough question: why did so many voters stay home?\n\nOfficial data showed electoral turnout – the proportion of eligible voters who actually voted – stood just below 60%, only the second time in the past century that more than 40% of voters decided to stay home.\n\nIt dipped to 59.4% in 2001 – something political commentators at the time attributed to the dominance of Tony Blair’s Labour Party at the time. Their win was seen as certain well ahead of the vote.\n\nGiven the predictions of a major Labour win, it is possible that some voters decided to skip the vote on Thursday because they thought the election was already decided.\n\nBut there are other possible explanations.\n\nSome voters in Scotland might have missed the vote because of its timing. Schools in Scotland have already shut down for the summer break, meaning some families might have been away on vacation. While postal vote is possible – and popular – in the UK, British media reported delays to some ballot papers being delivered.\n\nAnd then there are the voters who decided to skip the vote because they are fed up with politics altogether – not wanting the Conservatives to remain in power but uninspired by the alternatives.\n\nHere is a selection of voter turnout over past century, according to election data from the House of Commons Library:\n\n1924: 77.0%\n\n1929: 76% (The first election in which men and women had equal right to vote)\n\n1931: 76.4%\n\n1935: 71.1%\n\n1945: 72.8%\n\n1950: 83.9%\n\n1970: 72.0%\n\n1979: 76.0%\n\n1987: 75.3%\n\n1992: 77.7%\n\n1997: 71.4%\n\n2001: 59.4%\n\n2005: 61.4%\n\n2010: 65.1%\n\n2015: 66.2%\n\n2017: 68.8%\n\n2019: 67.3%\n\n2024 (as of Friday morning): 59.9%\n\nHere is how one third of votes got Labour two thirds of seats in the Parliament\n\nThe Labour Party has won an overwhelming majority in the UK Parliament, securing close to two thirds of the seats in the UK Parliament.\n\nHere is the curious thing though: in terms of the vote share, only about one third of voters cast their votes for Labour in the election yesterday.\n\nThis discrepancy is due to the British electoral system, based on the “first past the post” principle.\n\nThe country is divided into 650 constituencies, each holding their own contest to pick one member of parliament. Whoever wins the largest number of votes in their constituency becomes the MP – they don’t need to secure the majority in order to be elected. In fact, most MPs don’t.\n\nThis means that the number of seats a party wins doesn’t necessary reflect its overall popularity across the country, something that has historically disadvantaged the smaller parties.\n\nReform, the insurgent rightwing populist party led by Nigel Farage, secured 14% of the votes in this election, but came first in only four constituencies. That means they will take up four seats in the parliament – less than 1%. The Greens, who got some 7% of all votes also secured four seats.\n\nThere have been campaigns to change the electoral systems over the years, but none succeeded – possibly because the parties making the decision are the ones who could lose the most from a shift to a different system.\n\nWorld leaders congratulate Starmer on election victory\n\nLeaders from several nations have been sending their congratulations to Britain’s next prime minister Keir Starmer.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted a photo of himself and Starmer on X, writing that they have “lots of work ahead.”\n\nMeanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sent “congratulations to my friend and new UK Prime Minister @Keir_Starmer on his resounding election victory.” He added in a post on X that he was looking “forward to working constructively” with the incoming Labour government.\n\nPrime Minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Støre congratulated Starmer on an “historic election win” on social media.\n\nMalta’s Prime Minister Robert Abela said he was “delighted by @Keir_Starmer’s resounding victory in the UK general election” in a post on X.\n\n“Congratulations to @UKLabour for driving a progressive and engaging campaign that empowered UK citizens. I look forward to strengthening further the excellent relations between [Malta] and [the UK],” said Abela.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron congratulated Starmer and alluded to having already spoken to the incoming Prime Minister.\n\n“Pleased with our first discussion. We will continue the work begun with the UK for our bilateral cooperation, for peace and security in Europe, for the climate and for AI,” Macron said in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Starmer on a “convincing election victory” in a post on X.\n\n“Ukraine and the United Kingdom have been and will continue to be reliable allies through thick and thin,” he wrote.\n\n“We will continue to defend and advance our common values of life, freedom, and a rules-based international order.”\n\nJust 20 voters decided a crucial seat\n\nThe Conservatives have held a key seat by the narrowest of margins: just 20 people ensured that party’s chairman Richard Holden won Basildon and Billericay.\n\nA recount was ordered in the constituency, which went right down to wire: if just 11 votes that were initially counted for the Conservatives had in fact been for Labour, the seat would have turned red.\n\nThis constituency has been an extremely secure stronghold for the Conservatives; so safe that Holden moved himself from a northeastern seat to contest this one, against the opposition of local Tories.\n\nBut the Conservatives’ collapse and Labour’s surge turned it into a stunningly close battleground. The final tally put Holden on 12,905 votes; Labour’s Alex Harrison on 12,885 votes and Reform UK’s Stephen Conlay on 11,354 votes.\n\nHouse of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt loses seat in most high-profile defeat so far\n\nPenny Mordaunt, the House of Commons leader and a potential frontrunner in the impending race for the leadership of the Conservative Party, has lost her seat – the most high-profile loss of the night so far.\n\nMordaunt, who has been an MP since 2010, was dislodged by Labour challenger Amanda Martin in Portsmouth North. Martin received 14,495 votes to Mordaunt’s 13,715 votes.\n\nMordaunt beat Martin in 2019 with a majority of more than 15,000 votes.\n\nHer defeat will be a blow to moderate Conservatives who are hoping to wrest control of the party away from its populist wing; Mourdaunt ran against Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak in the race to replace Boris Johnson as leader in 2022, and would have been expected to run again in another contest.\n\nShe also won attention around the world as the “lady in blue” at King Charles’ coronation.\n\nRight-wing populist Nigel Farage becomes MP for the first time after winning in Clacton\n\nNigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader of the Reform UK party, has become an MP at the eighth attempt, winning a seat in the heavily pro-Brexit town of Clacton.\n\nFarage’s Reform UK party has attacked the Conservatives on their failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration, and their message won over a considerable number of socially conservative former Tory voters.\n\nThe veteran Euroskeptic played a leading role in bringing about Britain’s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country’s politics since.\n\nBut he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory. He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives’ 12,820.\n\n“It’s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the centre right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that’s exactly what I’m going to do,” Farage said after winning the seat.\n\nHe pledged to “challenge the general election properly in 2029,” and promised to turn his rhetoric towards Labour as they seem set to enter government.\n\nHis presence during the election campaign upended the Tories’ efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. Now, he’ll likely be a prominent outside voice as the Conservatives decide on their next direction as the new opposition party.\n\nCNN visited Clacton in the run-up to the election, to take the temperature of voters and assess how Farage’s anti-immigration message was received.\n\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn defeats his old party standing as an independent\n\nLabour’s ex-leader, the left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, has defeated his former party in a unique battle in London’s Islington North, dealing a symbolic blow to his successor Keir Starmer.\n\nCorbyn led Labour to two election defeats in 2017 and 2019, and was later suspended by the party for his response to an antisemitism scandal that erupted within Labour under his watch.\n\nBut the left-wing veteran mounted a challenge as an independent candidate in the north London constituency he has represented since 1983. He defeated Labour’s Praful Nargund, winning 24,120 votes to Nargund’s 16,873.\n\n“Our campaign was a positive one. Our campaign did not get into the gutter of politics, as is too often happening in this country,” Corbyn said after winning.\n\nWinning this seat was a huge priority for Labour, both as a symbolic marker of how dramatically the party’s ideology has shifted since Corbyn’s tenure, and to avoid the prospect of the politician leading a small throng of left-wing opponents to Starmer within parliament.\n\nNow Corbyn will be expected to lead a throng of opposition from Labour’s left as Starmer looks set to govern in the coming years.\n\nTwo Cabinet ministers lose seconds apart\n\nTwo Conservative Cabinet ministers have lost their seats just seconds apart, as the scale of the Tories’ misery increases on a devastating election night.\n\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps lost his seat to Labour in Welwyn Hatfield, the most high-profile defeat of the night so far.\n\nShapps has held a number of Cabinet positions under different prime ministers, including energy security and net zero secretary, business, energy and industrial strategy secretary and home secretary. He was elected to parliament in 2005.\n\nHe lost his seat to Labour’s Andrew Lewin, who won by 3,799 votes. It’s quite the fall from grace after he secured his seat back in 2019 with a majority of almost 11,000 votes.\n\nHe had been one of a number of prominent Tory candidates expected to lose their seat after the exit poll released.\n\nAlmost at the same time, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk lost his seat to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe twin defeats painted the perfect picture of a miserable night for the Conservatives, who have been carved up by Labour and the Lib Dems across the country.\n\nAnd it could get worse – more Cabinet ministers are at risk, including the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt – in what could be an unprecedented evening.\n\nWhat the UK front pages are looking like\n\nWe’re starting to get a glimpse of the Friday morning front pages which are obviously being dominated by the results of the exit poll, which foreshadows a Labour landslide and an undeniably poor showing from the Conservatives.\n\nThe Sun has opted to emphasize Labour’s win with the electoral map and a front page emblazoned with “Britain sees red.”\n\nTabloid paper the Daily Mirror has a full page shot of the Labour leader and his wife as they cast their vote on Thursday, with the headline: “KEIR WE GO.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Daily Express has gone with “CRUSHING BLOW TO TORY PARTY IN ELECTION WIPEOUT” with a photo of Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak and his wife.\n\nKeir Starmer says \"it is time for us to deliver\" after winning seat\n\nKer Starmer, who seems likely to be Britain’s next prime minister, said the country is “ready for change” after winning his seat in north London.\n\n“Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken. They are ready for change,” Starmer said at the count.\n\nStarmer was beaming as he arrived at the count, posing for selfies and taking his time to work his way through supporters and activists.\n\nOn stage, he was joined by a number of novelty candidates – including one dressed as Elmo – a unique feature of British democracy.\n\n“I promise this: Whether you voted for me or not, I will serve every person in this constituency,” Starmer said.\n\nLeft-wing populist George Galloway loses his seat to Labour\n\nLabour has narrowly defeated the left-wing populist George Galloway in a key race in Rochdale, easing concerns within the party that its stance on Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza had damaged its reputation among Muslim voters.\n\nGalloway won this seat months ago in a by-election, running on a heavily pro-Palestinian platform in the northwestern English town, which has a large Muslim population.\n\nBut Labour has returned to power in the constituency, beating Galloway by 33% to 29%.\n\nLabour was initially strongly supportive of Israel’s war against Hamas, but it has become increasingly critical of its conduct in Gaza and now supports a ceasefire, along with the return of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIts early response nonetheless hit its support among Muslim voters during May’s local elections, a trend that has worried many in the party.\n\nPopulist Reform UK party wins its first seat of the night\n\nReform UK’s Lee Anderson has won election in Ashfield, giving the right-wing populist group its first victory of the night.\n\nAnderson was formerly the deputy chair of the Conservative Party, but he defected to Reform in January, criticizing Rishi Sunak’s record on controlling migration.\n\nHe called Ashfield the “capital of common sense,” telling people at his count: “This wonderful place which I call my home is going to have a massive say in how this country is shaped in the future. I want my country back and Ashfield can play their part in that.”\n\nWinning this seat was a key target for the right-wing party, and it will hope to add a second soon, when results are announced in Clacton, where the party’s leader Nigel Farage is standing.\n\nReform were projected to win 13 seats in the exit poll. But the party earlier failed to pick up two seats in which the exit poll had projected them winners, suggesting it may fall short of that eye-catching overall predicted figure.\n\n“Reports of my demise had been greatly exaggerated,” Labour’s Dan Jarvis joked, after winning Barnsley North despite the exit poll projecting he would lose it to Reform.\n\n\"I've watched colleagues say stupid things:\" Furious backlash underway among Conservatives\n\nAn angry backlash among Conservatives has begun, with senior Tory figures hitting out at the direction of the party under Rishi Sunak.\n\nRobert Buckland, the former justice minister who was ousted by Labour in Swindon earlier this evening, launched a blistering attack on his former colleagues after becoming the first Tory to lose their seat earlier tonight.\n\n“I’m fed up with performance art politics,” Buckland told the BBC. “I’ve watched colleagues in the Conservative Party strike poses, write inflammatory op-eds and say stupid things they have no evidence for instead of concentrating on doing the job that they were elected to do.\n\n“I think we’ve seen in this election astonishing ill-discipline within the party,” he added.\n\nAnd the party was attacked from the right, too.\n\nAndrea Leadsom, a former business secretary, told the BBC the party was no longer “Conservative enough,” and said voters are “sick of all this woke stuff.”\n\nIt epitomizes the problem Sunak has faced throughout his premiership: an inability to appease either the left or right flanks of his party.\n\nSunak has flirted with populist messaging — particularly on migration — and promoted right-wing colleagues to government posts. But those decisions often ended in rows, such as with Lee Anderson and Suella Braverman, both of whom quit their roles in protest at Sunak’s failure to bring down illegal migration.\n\nSunak has meanwhile failed to build bridges with the moderate wing of his party, with many center-right lawmakers alienated by his approach and imploring the party to compete with Labour for votes in the center ground of British politics.\n\nStarmer has \"net unfavorability ratings\" despite predicted landslide for Labour, expert tells CNN\n\nDespite a predicted landslide win for the UK’s Labour Party, its leader Keir Starmer may have some work to do on his favorability raings, according to one think tank director.\n\n“We see net unfavorability ratings for Keir Starmer, even though he’s going to have this massive, massive majority,” Anand Menon, director of think tank UK in a Changing Europe told CNN. “Beneath this sort of happy story for Labour, there are some warning signs about levels of dissatisfaction with prevailing political trends in this country.”\n\nMenon noted that Starmer intends to “reset relations with European states and the European Union” after a tumultuous few years between the UK and EU after Brexit.\n\nPeople in the UK are “disillusioned,” said Menon, who is a professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King’s College London. “If you look at the polling, there’s a significant majority of people saying Brexit was the wrong decision, not the right decision.”\n\n“If you do a focus group with voters, they might say Brexit has been bad, Brexit has been a failure. But if you say to them, how about we do another referendum then and go through it all again? You will get a collective eyeroll and a groan and say actually, please, let’s not go through that again,” he told CNN.\n\nHow Labour's \"ming vase\" campaign steered it to victory\n\nThe Labour Party had a very good problem at the start when the election was called: How do you run a campaign that absolutely everyone expects you to win?\n\nKeir Starmer’s party had enjoyed a double-digit lead in opinion polls for the entirety of Rishi Sunak’s premiership, which began in October 2022, and was guaranteed to win the election as long as it didn’t rock the boat during the six-week campaign.\n\nLabour appealed to an electorate tired of the Tories’ chaotic period in government with a single-word slogan: “Change.” But Starmer simultaneously followed a path that some party strategists took to calling a “ming vase” approach, metaphorically looking after a precious and delicate lead in opinion polls. The party repeated its key themes, avoided the temptation to unveil any major policy announcements, and pledged time after time that the party would keep a tight lid on public finances.\n\nThe party’s manifesto was modest, pledging to revive Britain’s flagging public services without a large injection of cash. That has raised eyebrows by independent watchdogs, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which said their public spending offer was “tiny, going on trivial.”\n\nBut that was a calculation Labour has stuck to, as they sought to gain a reputation as a sensible, moderate party that can appeal to former Tory voters.\n\nStarmer avoided gaffes, and didn’t interrupt his opponent Rishi Sunak when he was making mistakes of his own.\n\nAnd he became an increasingly difficult rival for the Conservatives to land successful attacks against. Sunak strived to convince voters that Starmer would increase taxes, make Britain less safe, and that he didn’t have the stamina for the job of prime minister — but none of these charges appear to have stuck.\n\nLabour’s projected victory is a personal triumph for Keir Starmer that once seemed impossible\n\nThe Labour Party’s projected victory marks a historic moment in modern British political history and a huge personal triumph for Keir Starmer, the Labour leader who is set to become the country’s next prime minister.\n\nThe UK broadcasters’ exit poll suggests Labour will have a parliamentary majority of 170, returning the party to office for the first time since it lost the 2010 election to the Conservatives, who have been in power ever since.\n\nStarmer’s victory is all the more remarkable considering the journey that Labour has been on since the last general election in 2019. Then, the party suffered its worst loss in a generation under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who stood on a hard-left platform.\n\nA path back to credibility and even being competitive in a general election looked potentially a decade off, as the Conservatives emerged triumphant from the carnage of Brexit under the charismatic – but chaotic – leadership of Boris Johnson.\n\nJohnson not only defeated his political rivals, but completely upended the norms of British politics. Under his leadership, his party won seats in traditional working-class Labour areas once deemed out of reach to Conservatives. For a year at least, he seemed untouchable.\n\nIt was in this context that Starmer took control of a broken Labour Party on April 4, 2020. On that day, David Lammy, one of his Labour colleagues, took him to one side and warned Starmer: “Set yourself a 10-year cycle. You might just lose the next election, and then you can go again.”\n\nAccording to Lammy, Starmer smiled and said “No, I can do this in five.”\n\nRead more here\n\nLabour will work with Trump if he becomes US president, UK's shadow foreign secretary says\n\nA Labour government would work with Donald Trump if he is voted back in as US president, the UK’s shadow foreign secretary has said. Labour is projected to win 410 seats in the British election and take a massive parliamentary majority of 170 seats, according to the exit poll.\n\nWhen asked if Labour would work with Trump, David Lammy told ITV his party would work “with whomever the American people decide should be incumbent at the White House.”\n\nHe noted that both the UK and US are “democratic countries,” highlighting that the two countries work successfully together in areas such as intelligence and armed forces.\n\n\"The British people have chosen change:\" Labour politicians react with delight to exit poll\n\nSenior Labour politicians have praised Keir Starmer for taking his party to the “cusp of power” following its projected success in the exit poll.\n\nLabour’s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said he was “delighted” by the exit poll, which he called “remarkable.”\n\n“I’ve seen many exit polls over the years. They don’t tend to look like these ones, and if we have won this general election, that is historic for the Labour Party,” he told the BBC.\n\nIn the first victory speech of the night, Labour shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson, who won Houghton and Sunderland South, said the British people have “chosen the leadership of Keir Starmer.”\n\n“Tonight the British people have spoken and if the exit poll this evening is again a guide to results across our country – as it so often is – then after 14 years the British people have chosen change,” she said.\n\nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said Starmer had demonstrated “a sense of conviction and confidence.”\n\n“It’s been difficult, there have been some wobbly moments… In my wildest dreams, four and a half years ago, did I think we’d be here? No,” he told the BBC. He added that the Labour Party under the leadership of Starmer has been taken to “the cusp of power.”\n\n\"This, folks, is huge.\" Farage celebrates exit poll and falsely criticizes media\n\nReform UK’s leader Nigel Farage has described his party’s projected success in the UK election as “huge.”\n\nIn a video posted on X, Farage said: “It’s midnight. There are two results in from the northeast of England that put Reform on 30% of the vote. That is way more than any possible prediction or projection. It’s almost unbelievable.”\n\nThe UK broadcasters’ exit poll predicts that Reform – which did not exist in its current form at the last UK general election – will win 13 seats.\n\n“What does it mean? It means we’re going to win seats. Many, many seats, I think, right now across the country,” Farage added.\n\n“This is going to be six million votes plus. This, folks, is huge.”\n\nFarage also attacked the media claiming that no Reform spokespeople were featured in election night coverage. “There’s not a single representative on there from Reform UK,” he said – a claim that was demonstrably false. Britain’s Channel 4 played the clip and then cut directly to a Reform representative in the studio, Ann Widdecombe.\n\nThe BBC and Sky News had featured David Bull, the deputy leader of Reform, prominently in their live coverage.\n\nAs Europe turns right, why is a center-left party projected to win by a landslide in the UK?\n\nThe United Kingdom’s decision to hand the center-left Labour Party a parliamentary majority, according to the exit poll, comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge.\n\nLast month’s European elections saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally won last week.\n\nA government comprised of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries.\n\nThere are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse.\n\nSo why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, projected to buck this trend?\n\nDespite the expected seat count, the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night, is set to outperform the expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which had it down to double digits in parliament.\n\nAnother party that is set to exceed polling expectations is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives, Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK’s membership of the EU.\n\nFarage’s political success to date has all come without him holding a parliamentary seat. Now he is not only projected to have a seat himself, but also 12 colleagues to hurl grenades at Labour leader Keir Starmer. While this may seem small fry compared to Starmer’s anticipated three-figure majority, Farage will no doubt influence the debate on the future direction of the Conservative Party, possibly dragging it further to the right.\n\nIt is possible that Farage’s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer increase his majority in parliament. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn’t necessarily translate to seats. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour will ultimately win, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further.\n\nBritain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public’s imagination, as it has elsewhere in Europe.\n\nLabour gains first new seat of the night, sweeping out a former Conservative minister in Swindon South\n\nThe first of many Labour gains has just been announced – the party has taken Swindon South from the Conservatives.\n\nRobert Buckland, who served as a justice minister in Boris Johnson’s government, has been ousted by Heidi Alexander, a former Labour MP who returned to contest this seat.\n\nThe seat, in western England, was won by the Conservatives last time with an 11% lead, according to the notional results. But Labour earned a thumping majority this time – they won 21,676 votes to the Conservatives’ 12,070.\n\nA disastrous Conservative campaign puts the party on the brink of a worst-ever defeat\n\nThe sight was pitiful – and could easily have been avoided. When Rishi Sunak called the snap vote outside 10 Downing Street, he was drowned out – first by the pouring rain, then by the sound of the D:Ream song “Things Can Only Get Better,” the anthem of Labour’s 1997 election landslide, blaring from a nearby boombox.\n\nThings did not get better for the Conservatives. The campaign went from bad to worse, ending in what is projected to be a heavy defeat. Trying to make smalltalk at a Welsh brewery at an early campaign event, Sunak asked punters if they were excited for the soccer, only to be reminded that Wales had not qualified for the ongoing European Championship. In another campaign stop at the Northern Ireland shipyard that built the Titanic, Sunak, seemingly unaware of the irony, was asked if he, too, was captaining a sinking ship.\n\nBut those gaffes look minor when compared to Sunak’s disastrous decision to leave the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings early to give a routine TV interview that would not air until the following week. The Tories’ patriotic heartlands were outraged: The prime minister left veterans on the beaches. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, was delighted: Here was an opportunity to snatch more votes from dyspeptic Tories.\n\nMeanwhile, one last sleaze scandal had been brewing. It was revealed that two Conservative candidates and its director of campaigning were under investigation by the gambling watchdog for allegedly placing bets on the date of the general election.\n\n“Gamble-gate,” as it became known, summed up what for many voters may be their lasting impression of the outgoing Conservative government: A prime minister too weak to control many of his party, and a party more interested in its own fortunes than those of the country.\n\nIn pictures: Labour Party leader Keir Starmer\n\nThe center-left Labour Party will win Britain’s general election by a landslide, according to a major exit poll, ending a 14-year era of Conservative rule in decisive fashion and putting its leader Keir Starmer on course to become prime minister.\n\nOnce a leading human-rights lawyer, Starmer became director of public prosecutions in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales — a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first-ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name.\n\nStarmer, 61, has promised to be the agent of change that Britain needs. He has pledged to grow the country’s economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He has said he will set up a national wealth fund with £7.3 billion ($9.2 billion) of public money that will help pay for the transition to net zero emissions.\n\nCritics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while skeptics on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better.\n\nSee more photos from Starmer’s career.\n\nLabour win a second seat, and the Conservatives slump again\n\nLabour has won Blyth and Ashington, the second seat of the night to declare, with the populist Reform UK party again putting in a strong showing and coming second.\n\nLabour won 50% of the vote to Reform’s 27%, and the Tories slipped to 15%.\n\nThis is a new constituency, created after the boundaries of the UK’s 650 seats were adjusted following the most recent election in 2019. The borders of most seats in the country have changed at least slightly since that vote, as they do every few decades.\n\nBut Labour would have won this seat with 48% of the vote had it existed in 2019, to the Conservatives’ 34%, according to notional calculations.\n\nThe UK's exit poll is usually very accurate\n\nA reminder: the UK’s election exit poll is usually a very accurate barometer of how many seats each party has won.\n\nBut, as politicians are reminding broadcasters, it is just a poll.\n\nThe exit poll was conducted Thursday at polling stations across the country, collecting a huge sample from across the UK of how people voted. It is then modelled by a panel of experts, and closely guarded from the public and the media.\n\nIn 2019, the exit poll predicted the Conservatives would win 368 seats, just three more than they did when the final results were in. Two years earlier, it missed the Tories’ seat total by three, this time in the opposite direction.\n\nWhy can’t we report anything about the election yet?\n\nThere is a limit to how much we can tell you about Britain’s election – at least until polls close in an hour or so.\n\nThat’s because the country has strict rules on reporting while people are still voting. They apply to all broadcasters licensed in the United Kingdom, including CNN, forbidding them from reporting on campaign issues, opinion polls, political statements and candidates until the polling stations shut in the evening.\n\nThe restrictions are far stronger than in many countries, such as the United States, where candidates continue campaigning on election day as they try to drive as many voters to the polls as possible.\n\nThe UK’s Office of Communications (Ofcom) enforces the regulations, which are designed to ensure political coverage is impartial and to prevent the media from influencing voters as ballots are being cast.\n\nIt means that on election day, you won’t hear journalists or pundits speculating about politics on Britain’s TV and radio airwaves, or on digital sites.\n\nBut that all changes at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET), the moment polls close.\n\nHow does the UK’s general election work?\n\nBritain has a first-past-the-post voting system – the make-up of its next parliament won’t be decided by vote share, but by how many seats each party wins.\n\nPeople have been casting ballots in each of the country’s 650 constituencies, selecting the member of parliament (MP) to represent the area.\n\nThe leader of the party that wins a majority of those constituencies becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority.\n\nIf no party reaches that mark, the largest party could seek to lead as a minority government, or it could enter a coalition with other groups to get it over the line."
