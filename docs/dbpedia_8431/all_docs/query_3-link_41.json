However, many working men were disappointed that they could not vote.\n\nChartism was a working class movement which emerged in 1836 in London. It expanded rapidly across the country and was most active between 1838 and 1848. The aim of the Chartists was to gain political rights and influence for the working classes. Their demands were widely publicized through their meetings and pamphlets. The movement got its name from the People’s Charter which listed its six main aims:\n\na vote for all men (over 21)\n\nsecret ballot\n\nno property qualification to become an MP\n\npayment for MPs\n\nelectoral districts of equal size\n\nannual elections for Parliament\n\nWhy did the Chartists make these demands? Use the original documents in this lesson to find out more about Chartism.\n\nTasks\n\nBackground\n\nThe Chartists presented three petitions to Parliament to make their six point charter law in 1839, 1842 and 1848. Each petition was rejected. The final Chartist petition of 1848, it was claimed, had six million signatures. The Chartists planned to deliver it to Parliament after a peaceful mass rally on Kennington Common in London. According to the ‘Illustrated London News’ on 15th April 1848, ‘One hundred and fifty thousand special constables, watchful for the preservation of order, have grasped their useless truncheons and have paraded the streets without meeting a foe’. 15,000 Chartists were said to have turned up. The demonstration was considered a failure and the rejection of this last petition marked the real decline of Chartism. The petition itself was ridiculed and said to contain 1,975,496 names and many forgeries, including the signatures of Queen Victoria and Mr. Punch. Chartist conventions continued until the 1850s but without mass support.\n\nOpponents of the movement feared that Chartists were not just interested in changing the way Parliament was elected, but really wanted a revolution. They also thought that the Chartists, who said they disapproved of violent protest, were in fact stirring up a wave of riots around the country. On 4 November 1839, 5,000 men marched into Newport, in Monmouthshire, and attempted to take control of the town. Led by three well-known Chartists: John Frost, William Jones and Zephaniah Williams, they gathered outside the Westgate Hotel, where the local authorities were temporarily holding a number of potential troublemakers. Troops protecting the hotel opened fire, killing at least 22 people, and brought the uprising to an abrupt end.\n\nSupport for Chartism peaked at times of economic depression and hunger, in 1839, 1842 and 1848. In 1842, for example there was rioting in Stockport, due to unemployment and near-starvation, the new union workhouse was attacked. Also in Manchester workers protested against wage cuts, wanting ‘a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s labour’. The ‘Plug Plots’ were a series of strikes in Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Midlands and parts of Scotland that took place in the summer of 1842. Workers removed the plugs from the boilers in order to bring factory machinery to a halt. Wage cuts were the main issue, but support for Chartism was also strong at this time. In 1848 as trade was still depressed and interest in political reform peaked again with news of revolution in France and a third Chartist petition was planned.\n\nChartism is often described as a working class movement, but it had some middle class supporters who were hoped it would promote education reform and teetotalism. It was not necessarily a revolt against industrialisation either. Many chartist supporters worked in the domestic industry as handloom weavers, stocking makers, shoemakers or carpenters however, the latter two trades were not impacted by industrialisation at that point.\n\nAlthough the Chartist movement ended without achieving its aims, the fear of civil unrest remained. Later in the century, many Chartist ideas were included in the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884. At the time, the six point charter proved too radical for a Parliament representing the middle and upper classes to make into law.\n\nPossibly the movement could have made more progress had its leadership been more united. There were also regional differences in the nature of Chartist support, for example in Wales, Chartism was often associated with Nonconformist chapels but in Leeds some Chartists worked to enter local government. Despite its failure, it was a significant movement because it gave the working classes a sense of class consciousness and valuable political experience in campaigning, organizing publicity and holding meetings.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nThis lesson uses sources from The National Archives to explore the Chartist movement. Before starting, it would be useful to ensure that students are familiar with key political terms: suffrage; ballot; representation; franchise; legislature.\n\nThe first source that students examine is an extract from the handbook of the People’s Charter Union to find out about the aims of the movement. The second source is a cartoon from the ‘Illustrated London News’ which shows the ‘Attack on the workhouse at Stockport’ in 1842. The source prompts students to consider the link between dissatisfaction with the New Poor Law and support for Chartism.\n\nNext, students look at two extracts from an article in the ‘Illustrated London News’ about a riot in Preston in 1842. Here, they look at the response of the authorities to events and determine if these events were linked to the Chartist movement.\n\nThe fourth source concerns extracts from an article in ‘The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser’ about riots in Manchester and its surroundings. What is the link between the Chartist Charter and the demand for higher wages? These sources could also provide the opportunity to discuss the role of the press and how these events are reported.\n\nThe final source is an illustration showing a Chartist meeting on Kennington Common from the ‘Illustrated London News’ in 1848. Students consider what it reveals about the supporters of the movement and the advantages and disadvantages of using visual evidence. Students can also use the image shown at the top of the lesson page as evidence to further explore the nature of this Chartist meeting.\n\nYou may want to split the lesson for students working individually or use the sources in paired/group work. Students should be encouraged to think about the limitations of looking at this evidence to evaluate any understanding of the Chartist movement.\n\nAll sources are transcribed and difficult language defined in square brackets. Source one also has a simplified transcript.\n\nPlease note that content in this lesson has been redeveloped from content in our Power Politics & Protest focussed topic website which has been archived as the interactive parts no longer work.\n\nSources\n\nIllustration image: ‘A Chartist meeting at Blackfriars Bridge’ from the ‘Illustrated London News’, 15 April 1848, Catalogue ref: ZPER 34/12 f.242\n\nSource 1: Extracts from the handbook of the People’s Charter Union, 17 April 1848, Catalogue ref: HO 45/2410A, part 4, f. 5\n\nSource 2: Cartoon entitled: ‘Attack on the workhouse at Stockport’ from ‘Illustrated London News’, 20 August 1842, Catalogue ref: ZPER 34/1 f.236\n\nSource 3a & 3b Article on a riot in Preston from Illustrated London News, 20 August 1842, Catalogue ref: ZPER 34/1 f.236\n\nSource 4a, 4b, 4c: Extracts from an article in ‘The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser’, 13 August 1842, about trouble in Manchester and its surroundings\n\nCatalogue ref: HO 45/249A\n\nSource 5: A Chartist meeting on Kennington Common from the ‘Illustrated London News’, 15 April 1848, Catalogue ref: ZPER 34/12 f.242\n\nExternal links\n\nAn article on the support for Chartism with original sources from the British Library:\n\nhttps://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/chartism#\n\nAn important blog on the role of black chartist leader William Cuffey:\n\nhttps://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/black-man-party-william-cuffey-chartist-leader/\n\nA general blog on the suffrage movement including Chartism:\n\nhttps://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/reform-violence-and-the-struggle-for-suffrage/\n\nConnection to Curriculum\n\nKey stage 4\n\nAQA GCSE History: Britain: Power and the people: c1170 to the present day\n\nKey stage 5\n\nAQA GCE History: The Age of Reform: Britain 1832-1185\n\nEdexcel GCE History: Protest, agitation and parliamentary reform in Britain, c1780–1928\n\nOCR GCE History: From Pitt to Peel: Britain 1783–1853\n\nBack to top"
