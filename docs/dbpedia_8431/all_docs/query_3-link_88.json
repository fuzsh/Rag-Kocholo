        "text": "Visa retains an effective decision-making body in Europe through a revised Visa Europe Board that reflects our new structure as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Inc. and as a Bank of England designated entity.\n\nThe role of the Visa Europe Board includes approving the budget for Visa in Europe, tailoring Visa Inc. strategy for the European region and deciding on matters referred to it by the Visa Europe Executive Leadership Team.\n\nThe CEO is responsible to the Board for the day-to-day management of the European Business, supported by her leadership team and a management committee.\n\nReporting lines with the European business balance the needs of both the regional operating model and the global regional structure, with matrix reporting lines in place for central service functions.\n\nSelf-assessment\n\nIn November 2023, Visa Europe published its updated self-assessment against the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI). The point of the assessment is 23 November 2023.\n\nThe PFMIs are internationally agreed standards published by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in April 2012. They are a part of a set of standards that the international community considers essential to strengthening and preserving financial stability.\n\nVisa Europe as a Recognised Payment System has undertaken the self-assessment against the principles that apply to payment systems.\n\nYou can download a PDF version of the document here.\n\nUK Pension Schemes\n\nThe chair of the Trustee Directors of Visa Europe Pension Trustee Limited, Peter Gibbs, has provided two statements for the period ending 30 September 2023.\n\nRead Visa Europe Pension Plan Chairman’s Statement\n\nRead Visa Europe Pension Plan’s Implementation Statement\n\nIn addition, there is also a requirement to issue a Statement of Investment Principles for both of Visa’s pension schemes in the UK, which sets out the trustees’ investment strategy and their policy on environmental, social and corporate governance factors. Also, for the Visa UK Pension Plan, the trustees have produced a statement that sets out the actions they have undertaken to implement the stewardship policy in accordance with their SIP.\n\nRead Visa Europe Pension Plan’s Statement of Investment Principles dated September 2023\n\nRead Visa UK Pension Plan’s Statement of Investment Principles dated January 2024\n\nRead Visa UK Pension Plan’s current Engagement Policy Implementation Statement\n\nGender Pay Reporting\n\nIn accordance with its legal obligations, the branch of VISA Europe Ltd. in France establishes and communicates since 2019 before March 1 of each year the score of the Gender Pay Gap index.\n\nThe Gender Pay Gap index corresponds to a government measure that came into force in 2019. This index, whose overall score can reach 100 points, aims to compare the situation of women to that of men in the company according to 4 or 5 indicators, depending on the company's headcount. Given our headcount, our assessment covers only 4 indicators.\n\nOur score, obtained according to these 4 indicators, is detailed below:\n\nThe pay gap: 34/40 points;\n\nThe difference in the rate of individual increases: 35/35 points;\n\nIncrease after return from maternity leave: 15/15 points;\n\nParity between women and men among the 10 highest salaries: 5/10 points.\n\nFor the reference period from 1st January to 31st December 2023, we obtained an overall score of 89/100.\n\nAs a company we continue to strive to evolve and improve our policies which over time will drive continued improvement in our score and help us meet our client’s needs.\n\nPlease find here a link to our UK gender pay report\n\nVeuillez cliquer ici pour la version en français\n\nUnder this arrangement, we will separately compete for scheme and processing business, while continuing to meet the changing demands of a global marketplace.\n\nOur Code of Conduct helps us understand our roles and responsibilities in the context of this structure, no matter which area of Visa we are part of. It helps ensure individual and organisational compliance as we continue to deliver new and exciting products and services quickly and at scale.\n\nVisa partners with its customers in Europe – banks and payment providers – to enable payments and associated services. Our focus is on providing global, competitive and innovative solutions that meet the needs of our customers. This in turn brings tangible benefits to their customers - enabling merchants to grow their businesses and enabling consumers to pay where and when they choose, and on any device.\n\nVisa Europe Limited (Visa) operates separate management bodies for the management of Scheme and Processing.\n\nIn line with its obligations under Article 16(1) of the Regulatory Technical Standard (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/72) of 4 October 2017) (‘RTS’)1 and without prejudice to the exemption of shared services referred to in Article 12 of the RTS, Visa has set out the following clear and objective criteria to ensure that the composition of its management bodies mitigates any conflicts of interest for the decision making process between Scheme and Processing:\n\nAny Scheme and Processing management body is constituted with a defined mandate that ensures compliance with Visa’s Separation of Scheme and Processing Code of Conduct (including the protection of sensitive information and other conduct obligations to mitigate any conflicts of interest).\n\nMembers of the relevant management bodies of each of Scheme and Processing will at all times be subject to conflicts of interest policies\n\nAny circumstances where directorships may be held by the same person at the same time in the management body of Scheme and Processing will be objectively justified and restricted to the minimum necessary to address a specific need or purpose. An example of circumstances where it may be necessary would be for regulatory, prudential or other risk based oversight.\n\n1 onshored in the UK by the Technical Standards (Interchange Fee Regulation) (EU Exit) Instrument 2019"
