Useful Contacts For Students\n\nAbout the Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Team\n\nThe Office of the President and Provost (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) works to advance equality, diversity and inclusion at UCL. The team draws from diverse expertise to provide informed advice and engagement that support faculties and departments to develop EDI initiatives and good practice at UCL. The structure and purpose of the team are to embed equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives into core business and to mainstream the values on which UCL was founded. The EDI team works with and supports a number of steering groups and networks. These play an important function in:\n\nRepresenting the views of under-represented or marginalised staff\n\nHelping develop practical solutions to address equality issues\n\nProviding opportunities for networking and peer support among group members.\n\nAs a strategy team within Provost's Office, the EDI team can offer advice but do not undertake casework on behalf of individuals. The EDI team is often asked to make comment and provide advice on pressing equality issues, including on high-profile public debates or sensitive issues in the media. Any comments provided are aligned with the purpose and expertise of the team, and may not always represent the views of the President and Provost.\n\nTeam Members\n\nLesley Houfe\n\nInterim Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Director\n\nEmail: l.houfe@ucl.ac.uk\n\nI am the interim Director of EDI and lead the central EDI Team.
