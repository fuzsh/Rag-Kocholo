        "text": "In 2005, Hurricane Katrina swept through New Orleans and neighboring areas leaving a trail of destruction and chaos. As our local staffers provided round-the-clock coverage, many of them suffered — their homes destroyed or damaged and relatives rendered homeless. Hearing of their hardships, colleagues around the AP world asked how they could help.\n\nThose heartfelt offers led to the establishment of The Associated Press Emergency Relief Fund, an independent 501(c)(3), which in the years since has provided quick cash relief to staffers and their families who have been adversely affected by conflict or natural disasters — beyond insurance or the assistance that AP offers.\n\nIn the decade since Katrina, the fund has distributed nearly 50 grants totaling over $250,000 — all thanks to the generosity of fellow AP colleagues and others who revere AP.\n\nThe fund has helped rebuild houses for staffers in Myanmar after a devastating cyclone, repair and replace cars for staff in Baghdad whose vehicles were destroyed by bombs and provide rental assistance for several people in our New York headquarters after Hurricane Sandy. In one instance, after the Taliban invaded a region of Afghanistan and threatened residents, the fund provided money for a staffer there to move his family to safety. In 2020, grants went to staffers whose homes were significantly damaged by the port explosion in Beirut.\n\nDonate via Paypal\n\nIn order to be ready to help the moment emergencies strike, the Fund relies on the generous and ongoing support of the extended AP community. Donations, which range from $10 to $100,000, and are tax deductible, can be made by check or credit card at any time throughout the year.\n\nDonate by check\n\nWithin the U.S. and Canada, donations can be made by check, payable to AP Emergency Relief Fund; mail your check to AP Emergency Relief Fund, The Associated Press, 200 Liberty Street, NY, NY 10281, and be sure to include your name, address and contact information. (Donations outside of the U.S. and Canada should be made online by credit or debit card.)\n\nRelief Fund Board\n\nOn behalf of the AP staffers and families who receive aid in times of crisis, the AP Emergency Relief Fund Directors and Officers thank you."
