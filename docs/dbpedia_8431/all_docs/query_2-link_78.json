        "text": "Cllr Holland has led Lambeth Council since 2021. On Wednesday she was elected as successor to Georgia Gould, who resigned as Chair of London Councils after being elected as an MP.\n\nCllr Holland said: “I am delighted to have been elected to lead London Councils as we enter a new political era, and taking on this role builds on the important work undertaken both in Lambeth and at London Councils in tackling the climate emergency and the cost of living crisis.\n\n“It’s clear that London boroughs are a force to be reckoned with, and when we collaborate across political parties to champion and serve our city and its nine million residents we can achieve so much.”\n\nPreviously Cllr Holland was the Deputy Chair of London Councils and was Acting Chair during Georgia’s maternity leave. Before that she served on London Councils’ Transport and Environment Committee.\n\nShe will now lead collaborative work between London boroughs to improve the lives of Londoners. This includes driving inclusive and sustainable economic growth to improve living standards for all, tackling London’s housing emergency, lobbying for greater financial stability for councils, promoting prevention and wellbeing, and helping London get to net zero.\n\nTop of her to-do list will be working effectively with the new government, including on its legislative programme as announced in the King’s Speech.\n\nCllr Holland said: “We are ready to work with the new government to address the urgent challenges facing our city and country and help support a new mission-driven approach to government, working alongside the Mayor of London and our partners.\n\n“In particular, we are determined to drive growth and bring London’s housing crisis to an end – that means building more homes, investing in infrastructure and ensuring local authorities have the powers and funding we need to deliver on our ambitions for the capital.”"
