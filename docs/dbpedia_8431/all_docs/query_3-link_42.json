        "text": "How do we know what to ask the government to do? Because business tells us. Our mandate comes from our members. Our councils and committees meet every quarter, engaging 1,000 senior business leaders from over 700 of our total 1,100 corporate and 150 trade association members. And members can get involved in a variety of other ways too, feeding into reports, calls for evidence, consultations and more. They have a direct say in what we do and how we do it – our mandate comes from their concerns, their feedback and their ideas. It comes by the week, by the day and - at times - by the hour.\n\nSupporting the wider community\n\nRepresenting UK business goes beyond just speaking to government: we also do what great businesses do – support people and communities. For example, we’ve worked with the Greggs Breakfast Clubs in Scotland, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, funding clubs that provide 58,500 breakfasts to children. The CBI has worked with the Social Mobility Foundation and Mencap to provide opportunities and work experience for people from a range of backgrounds. The CBI is also a founding member of Change the Race Ratio: accelerating racial diversity in business by campaigning for change and taking real action.\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nThe CBI has worked to reduce the footprint of our activities where possible. This includes monitoring our emissions, boosting our recycling capabilities and looking at how technology can reduce our impact on the environment. You can find more details in our Annual Report.\n\nAccreditations and partnerships\n\nAs of December 2021 we are members of Change the Race Ratio, FSQS signed up to the Valuable 500, 10,000 Black Interns Programme, 10,000 Able Interns Programme and the Menopause Workplace Pledge. The CBI was also instrumental working in partnership with the TUC in the creation of the Good Business Charter, founded by retailer Julian Richer"
