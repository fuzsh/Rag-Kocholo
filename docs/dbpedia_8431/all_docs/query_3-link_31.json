        "text": "In September 2023, MEPs approved the European Council’s decision to increase the number of European Parliament seats by 15 to 720 for the 2024-2029 legislative term.\n\nThe Council’s proposal was based on an earlier report from the Parliament.\n\nSeats per country in the 2024-2029 European Parliament\n\nHow is the number of MEPs per country decided?\n\nEU law allows for a maximum of 750 MEPs, plus the President. The number of seats per country is decided before each European election.\n\nThe distribution of seats takes into account the size of the population of member states as well as the need for a minimum level of representation for European citizens from smaller countries. This principle of “degressive proportionality”, which is enshrined in the Treaty on the European Union, means that while smaller countries have fewer MEPs than bigger countries, MEPs from larger countries represent more people than their counterparts from smaller countries.\n\nThe minimum number of seats per country is six and the maximum is 96."
