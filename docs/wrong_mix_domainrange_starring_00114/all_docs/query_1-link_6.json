        "text": "American actor\n\nBrett Voyde Harrelson (born June 4, 1963) is an American actor. He is the younger brother of actor Woody Harrelson and son of hitman Charles Harrelson.[2][3]\n\nBrett Harrelson was born in Midland, Texas, the son of Diane Lou (n√©e Oswald) and Charles Voyde Harrelson, who divorced in 1964. He has two brothers, Jordan and Woody Harrelson. Harrelson's father, who was a contract killer, was arrested for the killing of Judge John H. Wood Jr. by rifle fire in 1979 in San Antonio.[4] His father was convicted and eventually died during his life sentence in United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility.[4]\n\nIn 1973, Harrelson moved with his mother to her native city, Lebanon, Ohio, where he was raised.[5] Harrelson attended Lebanon High School but dropped out at 17 to join the United States Army, and spent two years in Germany. Afterward, he returned to Lebanon and worked as a legal clerk.\n\nAt 22, Harrelson followed his brother Woody to California. \"I came to L.A. to starify,\" he says. But finding nothing like Woody's success, he gave up acting for a while to become a motorcycle racer, rising to #8 in the 1992 professional national rankings. \"After seeing a few people killed,\" says Brett, he became Woody's assistant and began to pursue his acting career again.[6]\n\nHis current activities include TV ads for \"Harrelson's Own CBD\".[7] In 2020, Harrelson co-produced Son of a Hitman, a podcast series. The show was released by Spotify Studios and High Five Content.[8]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1996 Sunchaser Younger Highway Patrol Officer 1996 The People vs. Larry Flynt Jimmy Flynt 1998 Strangeland Steve Christian 1998 Dante's View Jeremy 1999 From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money Ray Bob 1999 Inferno Buck 2003 Go Further Self Documentary\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1990 A Mom for Christmas Kendall Television film"
