        "text": "Brett Harrelson is a famous American actor and businessman who has featured in some Hollywood blockbusters of the 90s. He is also known as the younger brother of fellow actor Woody Harrelson. Want to learn more about him? Keep reading!\n\nBrett Harrelson is an American actor and businessman. He is often called âWoody Harrelsonâs younger brotherâ as he is the less-known of the Harrelson brothers. Regardless, Brett has created a niche for himself in other ways. Hereâs everything we know about him.\n\nWho Is Brett Harrelson?\n\nBrett V. Harrelson is one-half of Hollywoodâs highly acclaimed Harrelson brothers. He is an actor and businessman born June 4, 1963, in Midland, Texas, to parents Diane Lou (nÃ©e Oswald) and Charles Voyde Harrelson.\n\nCharles was a contract killer who committed the first judge assassination of the 20th century. He was convicted and sent to a maximum facility, where he later died while serving his life sentence.\n\nAt ten years of age, Brett moved with his mother to Lebanon, Ohio, where he schooled and spent most of his early life. Brett dropped out of Lebanon High School at 17 to join the US Army, spent two years in Germany, and later returned to Lebanon to work as a legal clerk.\n\nAt age 22, he followed his brother Woody to California, which is when his acting career began.\n\nHow Did Brett Harrelson Start His Career?\n\nWhile often associated with his renowned brother Woody Harrelson, Brettâs individuality shines through his diverse roles as he has also been in several of Hollywoodâs big movies. After moving with his brother to Los Angeles, California, Brett wasnât as lucky as his brother in finding acting success.\n\nHe gave up on acting for a while and pursued a career in motorcycling, which worked out pretty well for him as he ranked number 8 in the 1992 professional national rankings. Still having a flair for acting, Brett became Woodyâs assistant and returned to acting. Over the years, he has featured in some Hollywood blockbusters and is passionate about acting.\n\nWhat Movies and TV Shows Did Brett Harrelson Star In?\n\nSince his Hollywood debut, Brett has starred in several movies, TV shows, and podcasts and even made a documentary about himself. Here is a list of some of his famous appearances:\n\nA Mom for Christmas (1990)\n\nSunchaser (1996)\n\nThe People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)\n\nStrangeland (1998)\n\nDanteâs View (1998)\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999)\n\nInferno (1999)\n\nGo Further (2023), a self-documentary.\n\nAre Brett Harrelson and Woody Harrelson Brothers?\n\nYes, they are! People often ask if Brett is related to Woody Harrelson due to their similar names and resemblance. The two have consistently confirmed their blood ties since their early Hollywood debut.\n\nBrett Harrelsonâs Siblings\n\nWhile Woody Harrelson is more widely known and featured in many movies than Brett, the brothers have always seemed close. However, most people do not know that there is a third Harrelson brother, Jordan, in Hollywood too.\n\nWoodrow Woody Harrelson\n\nAfter moving to California, Woody gained fame for his role as a dim-witted bartender on the classic sitcom âCheers.â This famous American television comedy series appeared on NBC for 11 seasons from 1982 to 1993). He later got more acting roles and success in the industry and earned respect as an accomplished and magnetic film actor.\n\nWoody is also famous for his roles in movies like âVenom,â and âGame Change.â He is an Emmy award-winning actor whose acting skills have been highly praised over the years, with many big award nominations and wins under his belt.\n\nWoody still acts today and has several rumored projects on the way.\n\nJordan Harrelson\n\nJordan Harrelson is the third Harrelson brother known majorly for his voice-acting skills. He was born on December 9, 1991. He has starred as a voice actor in some movies and video games, including âWellâ (2016), âParadise Lostâ (2023), and âMy Time at Portiaâ (2018).\n\nHow Did Brett Harrelsonâs CBD Business Start?\n\nIn 2020, the actor launched his Cannabidiol (CBD) brand called âHarrelsonâs Own CBD.â It is a CBD-producing company that uses nanotechnology to make and design its products.\n\nHarrelsonâs Own CBD is licensed in the United States and has gathered a rather large customer base due to the testimonials from its consumers about how fast and effective its products are.\n\nTheir slogan is âStable. Calm. Collected. Happy.â It is said to be a verbal description of their consumersâ feelings. Since its launch, Harrelsonâs Own CBD has been highly successful, and Brett himself stars in the commercials for the brand.\n\nWoody also launched his weed brand in October 2022 with some A-list partners, including HBO âReal Timeâ host Bill Maher, hot-shot designer Thomas Schoos and the founders of Erba dispensary Jay Handal and Devon Wheeler. Their brand is named âThe Woods.â\n\nBrett might be the lesser-known Harrelson brother, but he sure knows how to make a path for himself in other ways apart from acting. He is not married but is a loving uncle to his nieces Zoe Giordano Harrelson, Deni, and Makani.\n\nncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZpqimsG1eceaqaudnKi8r3s%3D\n\nShare!"
