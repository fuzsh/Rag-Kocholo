        "text": "Favorite Films\n\nWritten & Directed by Kevin Smith\n\nStarring Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Rosario Dawson, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Trevor Fehrman, Jennifer Schwalbach, & Jason Lee\n\nRelease Date: July 21, 2006\n\nRunning Time: 1hr 37min\n\nRating: R\n\nDante Hicks (O’Halloran) and Randal Graves (Anderson) worked at Quick Stop and RST Video for over a decade; then the building accidentally caught fire. A year later, they’ve been regularly employed at the fast food restaurant, Mooby’s. Their coworkers include spunky manager, Becky (Dawson) and timid Christian teen Elias (Fehrman; whom Randal loves messing with).\n\nJay and Silent Bob (Mewes and Smith) loiter outside the place (of course), but after a run in with the law and time in rehab, they no longer partake in drugs and are devout Christians (though they continue to deal).\n\nDante is on his last day of work, as he’s planning on moving to Florida with his fiancé, Emma (Schwalbach), despite having feelings for Becky. Randal isn’t happy at the thought of losing his best friend, so there’s a bit of tension in the air, that only escalates as the day goes on and certain secrets get revealed.\n\nThis sequel was first announced around the time of Dogma (where the end credits said Jay and Silent Bob would return). However, we got Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back instead, not that I’m complaining! That was announced as being the last movie in the View Askewniverse, but thankfully didn’t happen. You bet I was gonna go see the sequel to one of my favorite films of all time!\n\nThe movie was a critical and commercial hit upon release, earning $25 million against a $6 million budget. Since then, a third entry has been in the works. For a while it didn’t seem like this was going to happen either, due to certain cast members not wanting to return. This too has thankfully changed!\n\nYeah, I adore this movie! Some don’t see it as a worthy followup to an indie classic; I respectively disagree. I loved being able to see the continuing exploits of Dante and Randal on the big screen, they’re among my favorite fictional best friends. I feel that Jeff Anderson really shines in this movie, especially towards the end when he tells Dante how much he means to him (in a totally heterosexual way), something I relate to very well (and I imagine anyone else with a best friend). The pop culture references and naughty language helps a bit too in my enjoyment (sometimes I’m pretty simple). So yeah, go see it!"
