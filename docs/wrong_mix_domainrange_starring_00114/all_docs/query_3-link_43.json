        "text": "Clerks is the story of a Generation X, college dropout named Dante, who works at the local convenience store. The film begins with Dante being dragged out of his slumber by a call from his boss. His boss asks him to come in on his day off, because someone got sick. The day turns into a complete nightmare as anything bad that could happen to Dante does. Joined by his best friend Randall, who works in the same strip mall at a video store, Dante not only has to make it through the worst day of his life, but also deal with a barage of stupid questions and customers.\n\nClerks was Kevin Smith first film. The funding for the production of the film came from ten maxed out credit cards, money he got by selling his comic book collection, a family donation, paychecks from the Quick Stop and RST Video portrayed in the film, and a Federal Compensation check he received from his car being lost in a flood. Together this all added up to $27,575, thus the movie was shot in black and white to accommodate Smith's budget.\n\nThis movie began on the road to distribution at the Independent Feature Film Market (IFFM). It was seen there by Bob Hawk of the Sudance Advisory Committee, and thus picked up and shown at the Sundace in 1994. After Sundance the movie was picked up by Mirimax pictures, which brought it to the public eye. Not even the actor who played Dante, Brian O'Halloran, expected the movie to ever be seen. He just figured that it would be something neat to show his friends. The movie became a smash hit and launched Kevin Smith into the public eye in a matter of no time.\n\nThe official cast photo which appeared on the film poster. Jay (Jason Mewes) doesn't not appear, because Mirimax thought he was too scary, and, thus, make people shy away from the movie.\n\nCredits:\n\nDirected by: Kevin Smith\n\nWriting credits: Kevin Smith\n\nCast:\n\nBrian O'Halloran....Dante Hicks\n\nJeff Anderson....Randal Graves\n\nMarilyn Ghigliotti....Veronica\n\nLisa Spoonhauer....Caitlin Bree\n\nJason Mewes....Jay\n\nKevin Smith....Silent Bob\n\nScott Mosier....Willam the Idiot Manchild/Angry Hockey-PlayingCustomer/Angry Mourner\n\nScott Schiaffo...Chewlie's Rep.\n\nAl Berkowitz....Old Man\n\nWalter Flanagan....Woolen Cap Smoker/Egg Man/Offended Customer/Cat Admiring Bitter Customer\n\nEd Hapstak....Sanford/Angry Mourner\n\nLee Bendick....#812 Wynarski\n\nDavid Klein....Hunting Cap Smoking Boy/Low I.Q.
