        "text": "Andy Serkis is joining the cast of Oren Moverman’s World War II psychological thriller “The Man With the Miraculous Hands” starring Woody Harrelson.\n\nVendôme’s Philippe Rousselet and Jerico Films’ Eric Jehelmann will produce while Vendôme’s Fabrice Gianfermi and Jeremy Plager serve as executive producers. SND will co-produce, distribute in France and launch sales in Cannes.\n\nMoverman penned the screenplay and will direct the film, which is based on a true story and takes place in 1939.\n\nPer the movie’s logline: “Felix Kersten (Harrelson), a renowned, apolitical medical masseuse, becomes the personal doctor of one of the most powerful and feared men in Nazi Germany: the chronically ill Heinrich Himmler (Serkis), head of the SS and chief architect of the Holocaust. As war rages all over Europe, and Himmler’s health declines while his authority grows, Kersten finds himself in a unique position to influence decision making on the highest level inside the Third Reich. Playing a very dangerous game that may cost him his life at every turn, and using his medical skills as a weapon, the doctor manages to influence Himmler, turn him against Hitler, and, in turn, save many thousands of lives.”\n\nSerkis starred as Gollum in “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy and portrayed Caesar in the “Planet of the Apes” trilogy. He is also currently in production as director and producer of an animated adaptation of George Orwell’s “Animal Farm.” In February 2020, he was honored by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts at the 73rd EE British Academy Film Awards with one of the organization’s highest honor, the Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award. Serkis will reunite with Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens to direct and star in Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum.\n\nSerkis is represented by CAA and Principal Entertainment."
