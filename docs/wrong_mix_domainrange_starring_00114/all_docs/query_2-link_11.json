        "text": "2012\n\nIf, as is believed in certain fringe circles, the world will come to an end in 2012, at least there will be no more movies like this one made. Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable, b...\n\nAfter Sunset\n\nAfter the Sunset is a mess, but it's a breezy, fun mess. No one is ever going to mistake this for great art, but it has a charismatic cast, moves with an effortless pace, and, in the end, almost makes you forget that it doesn't do anything memorab...\n\nEdge of Seventeen, The\n\nMotion picture coming-of-age stories are touchstones. The best are capable of transporting older viewers back to a time of life that many of us now view through rose-colored glasses. High school was never easy and that constant hasn’t changed. ...\n\nEDtv\n\nJenniCam. August Live. BaddGrrl Live. GiggleCam. These are just a few examples of one of the Internet's hottest commodities: cam sites - web pages designed by exhibitionists with voyeurs in mind.

In the romanticized 1967 gangster film, law enforcement in general and Frank Hamer in particular were portrayed as bumbling up until...\n\nHunger Games, The\n\nThe Hunger Games comes charging out of the gate with a daunting task: fill the chasm in the fangirl cinematic franchise machine created by the completion of the Harry Potter saga and the impending end to all things Twilight.
