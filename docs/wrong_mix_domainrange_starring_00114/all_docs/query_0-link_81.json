        "text": "Like the “Blues Brothers,” Denzel Washington is on a mission from God in “The Book of Eli.”\n\nBut this time it’s the Hughes brothers (Albert and Allen) driving the car. The sibling directors, whose past work includes the punishing Johnny-Depp-versus-Jack-the-Ripper project “From Hell,” set their latest film in a stunningly stark post-apocalyptic America.\n\nDenzel is Eli; we assume as much by the title of the film, and we get a peek at the “Welcome to Kmart” nametag in his traveling pack about two-thirds through the film.\n\nAt first, it seemed to me odd casting to have the Oscar-winning Denzel Washington in the role of thug of few words.\n\nBut it soon becomes apparent that Eli has a lot to say – it’s just that few of the miscreants that populate this barren new world have the IQ to keep up with him.\n\nWords, in fact, are Eli’s most powerful weapon as he fights to survive and deliver “The Book” to the people who will put it to its intended use – rebuilding civilization.\n\nHis other weapons are nothing to sneeze at, of course – especially the huge, dismembering knife that he can wield in about half a heartbeat.\n\nEli makes quick work of cannibalistic ambushers and henchmen as he follows “the path” west.\n\nBut when the battery he’s got strapped to his iPod (yep, he’s got an iPod) drains, he veers off.\n\nThen that path crosses with a more worthy nemesis – the self-appointed ruler of a tattered Western town, Carnegie (played by Gary Oldham, who in my opinion is at his best when he’s treacherous and terrifying).\n\nCarnegie, who like Eli (and few others) is from before the sun scorched the earth in the aftermath of a world war, also knows the power of the written word – and desperately wants to get his hand on “The Book.”\n\nHe tries to make an ally of Eli, and when that doesn’t work he tries to kill him to claim the prized leather-bound volume in Eli’s pack.\n\nA servant girl (played by Mila Kunis) latches on to Eli and joins his dangerous quest. Even with the tattered rags that drape over her designer jeans, Kunis looks like a supermodel.\n\nIt’s a bit odd that a movie as violent and bloody as “Eli” can also be quite spiritual.\n\nThe film’s also got its share of twists and turns – few actually that I saw coming, including the identity of “The Book” (if, like my wife, you find that obvious, you’ve read it somewhere or you’re just smarter than me).\n\nBy the time Terence Stamp shows up in a cameo five minutes before the unexpected end, your eyes should be wide open.\n\nOn DVD\n\nZombie flicks are never short on “brrrr…aaaa…iiiinnnsss!”\n\nBut the minds behind the new-to-DVD “Zombieland” are fresher than most.\n\nStarring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin and a horde of the undead, this movie falls squarely into what seems to be an emerging genre: Zomb-edy.\n\nMy favorite of these is still the UK’s “Shaun of the Dead” (2004), starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as two hapless losers so disconnected that by the time they realize there’s a swiftly spreading zombie plague, just about everyone’s already a flesh-eating fiend.\n\nBut “Zombieland” – a cross between carnival games like “Whack-a-(Zombie)” and that series of “Worst Case Scenario” survival books – is a close second.\n\nEisenberg, who looks and sounds uncannily like actor Michael Cera (the mild, dry-humor hero of movies like “Juno” and “Superbad”), narrates like he’s teaching Zombies 101.\n\nHe plays Columbus – called that because he’s trekking from college to Columbus, Ohio, where he hopes to find his family still un-zombiefied.\n\nColumbus meets Tallahassee (Harrelson), who’s got Florida on the mind. Then sisters Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin) join the journey. You can guess how they got those names.\n\nSomehow, this foursome has managed to do something seemingly very few others have – survive.\n\nColumbus credits his personal rulebook – and his strict adherence to it.\n\n“The first rule of Zombieland: Cardio. When the zombie outbreak first hit, the first to go, for obvious reasons ... were the fatties.”\n\nHarrelson, it seems, has survived on brute force alone – he kills a lot of zombies, and revels in finding creative ways to do so. Meanwhile, he’s obsessed with Twinkies and makes it his mission to gorge on the world’s last box of “spongy yellow logs of cream.”\n\nThe sisters, meanwhile, have mastered the art of the con, outwitting humans and monsters alike.\n\nLike most “road trip” movies, the destinations – from Columbus to Tallahassee – don’t matter much. All the fun is in getting there.\n\nAnd just as it starts to drag – like a zombie dragging a foot hanging on by only a tendon or two – “Zombieland” comes alive again with a hilarious cameo by a comedy icon. (I won’t spoil it.)\n\nThe conclusion, in which our heroes lay waste to an amusement park full of zombies, is alone worth the price of admission.\n\n“Rule #32: Enjoy the little things” … and fasten your seatbelts (Rule #3).\n\nTrailer time\n\nThe trailer for “Cop Out,” partnering Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan, mockingly puts it in the same class as “Dirty Harry,” “Training Day” and “The Departed.”\n\nWhile it quickly quashes any notion that this is a serious police drama, what it avoids mentioning is that it's the latest dialogue-driven, profanity-laced comedy from writer/director Kevin Smith (“Clerks” and “Mallrats,” among others).\n\nI never appreciated Morgan before “30 Rock,” but I’ve always been a fan of Willis (from the late ’80s when he played private detective David Addison in TV’s “Moonlighting” and through all four “Die Hards”).\n\nDescribing “Cop Out,” Smith says imagine Dante and Randall (the “Star Wars”-obsessed clerks from his film debut) as private investigators.\n\nShould be fun. Opens Feb. 26.\n\nRobert McCune is editor of The Independent in Massillon, Ohio. He can be contacted at 330-775-1124 or Robert.McCune@IndeOnline.com."
