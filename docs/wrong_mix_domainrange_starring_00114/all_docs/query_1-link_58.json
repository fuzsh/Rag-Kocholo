        "text": "With the newest installment of the Planet of the Apes franchise premiering in theaters on Wednesday, May 8, you’re probably wondering which streaming service currently has the rest of the films.\n\nLook no further — Hulu has everything you need to know about where to watch the Planet of the Apes movies, including watch order, cast, and the new Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024) trailer.\n\nWhere to Watch Planet of the Apes\n\nWondering where to watch the Planet of the Apes movies before the theater premiere of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes on Wednesday, May 8? You’ve come to the right place — all Hulu subscribers can watch all nine films on demand from Hulu’s streaming library.\n\nPlanet of the Apes Movies\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\nThe very first Planet of the Apes film follows the journey of astronaut George Taylor and his crew after they crash-land on a planet where apes and humans have traded places — meaning, apes are the dominant species and humans are primitive.\n\nExploring themes of prejudice, human arrogance, and power dynamics, Taylor faces captivity and oppression as he struggles to survive and escape this upside-down world. But the more he discovers about the planet’s shocking history, the more he understands what led to the downfall of human civilization.\n\nWatch: Planet of the Apes (1968)\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968) Cast\n\nCharlton Heston as George Taylor\n\nRoddy McDowall as Cornelius\n\nKim Hunter as Zira\n\nMaurice Evans as Dr. Zaius\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)\n\nThe story of astronaut George Taylor continues in Beneath the Planet of the Apes, where he discovers a subterranean society of mutated humans worshiping an ancient nuclear bomb, leading to a catastrophic battle that could change the fate of both humans and apes on the planet.\n\nDelving deeper into themes of power, survival, and the consequences of humanity’s destructive tendencies, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is widely considered a suspenseful and thought-provoking sequel to the original classic.\n\nWatch: Beneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes Cast\n\nJames Franciscus as John Brent\n\nKim Hunter as Zira\n\nMaurice Evans as Dr. Zaius\n\nLinda Harrison as Nova\n\nCharlton Heston as George Taylor\n\nPaul Richards as Mendez\n\nEscape From the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nA dystopian future, time travel, and high-intensity action — what more could you ask for in a sci-fi movie? In the third installment of the original Planet of the Apes series, a family of apes travels back in time to just before the events that led to the rise of apes depicted in the first two films.\n\nWatch: Escape From the Planet of the Apes\n\nEscape From the Planet of the Apes Cast\n\nRoddy McDowall as Cornelius\n\nKim Hunter as Zira\n\nBradford Dillman as Dr. Lewis Dixon\n\nNatalie Trundy as Dr. Stephanie Branton\n\nEric Braeden as Dr. Otto Hasslein\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nThe fourth film in the original series takes place before the first Planet of the Apes movie, serving as a prequel and franchise origin story, where intelligent apes are enslaved by humans as laborers and pets. This leads to a revolution against human oppression, igniting a violent conflict that threatens to reshape the power dynamics of society.\n\nWatch: Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes Cast\n\nRoddy McDowall as Caesar\n\nDon Murray as Governor Breck\n\nRicardo Montalbán as Armando\n\nNatalie Trundy as Lisa\n\nHari Rhodes as MacDonald\n\nSevern Darden as Kolp\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)\n\nServing as a sequel to the Conquest of the Planet of the Apes prequel, this fifth franchise installment continues the Planet of the Apes origin story. Can the apes and remaining humans find a way to establish peace in this post-apocalyptic world?\n\nWatch: Battle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes Cast\n\nRoddy McDowall as Caesar\n\nClaude Akins as Aldo\n\nNatalie Trundy as Lisa\n\nSevern Darden as Kolp\n\nLew Ayres as Mandemus\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001)\n\nMark Wahlberg stars in this Planet of the Apes reimagination film directed by Tim Burton. More than a remake, this installment of Planet of the Apes involves significant changes to the plot and characters of the original film. While it retains the basic premise of humans encountering intelligent apes on a distant planet, there are many new elements and twists to the storyline.\n\nWatch: Planet of the Apes (2001)\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) Cast\n\nMark Wahlberg as Captain Leo Davidson\n\nTim Roth as Thade\n\nHelena Bonham Carter as Ari\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan as Attar\n\nPaul Giamatti as Limbo\n\nEstella Warren as Daena\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes tells the origin story of Caesar — the central protagonist in the “reboot” series and leader of the intelligent apes. Taking place before Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, this chapter of the franchise explores the circumstances that first led to the rise and domination of intelligent apes.\n\nWatch: Rise of the Planet of the Apes\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes Cast\n\nAndy Serkis as Caesar\n\nKarin Konoval as Maurice/Court Clerk\n\nTerry Notary as Rocket/Bright Eyes\n\nRichard Ridings as Buck\n\nChristopher Gordon as Koba\n\nDevyn Dalton as Cornelia\n\nJay Caputo as Alpha\n\nJames Franco as Will Rodman\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)\n\nThe story of Caesar continues in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, picking up from the aftermath left by the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and a mere decade after a deadly virus killed most of humanity.\n\nNow, plagued with military rule, social turmoil, and an economic crisis, humans and apes are struggling to co-exist.\n\nWatch: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes Cast\n\nAndy Serkis as Caesar\n\nJason Clarke as Malcolm\n\nGary Oldman as Dreyfus\n\nKeri Russell as Ellie\n\nToby Kebbell as Koba\n\nKodi Smit-McPhee as Alexander\n\nKirk Acevedo as Carver\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes (2017)\n\nIn the third and final installment in the reboot series, War for the Planet of the Apes continues the narrative of Caesar and his struggle to survive and co-exist with humans as he and the apes are forced into a war with humans led by a merciless colonel.\n\nWatch: War for the Planet of the Apes\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes Cast\n\nAndy Serkis as Caesar\n\nWoody Harrelson as The Colonel\n\nKarin Konoval as Maurice\n\nAmiah Miller as Nova\n\nTerry Notary as Rocket\n\nTy Olsson as Red Donkey\n\nMichael Adamthwaite as Luca\n\nToby Kebbell as Koba\n\nHow to Watch Planet of the Apes Movies in Order\n\nThe great thing about the Planet of the Apes movies is that although all of the movies are connected, they can still be enjoyed in any order — each film stands alone with its own self-contained storyline and characters.\n\nHowever, watching in order by release date or by chronological order according to canon can enhance your overall understanding of the Planet of the Apes world.\n\nHow to Watch Planet of the Apes in Release Date Order\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nEscape From the Planet of the Apes\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) — optional\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes\n\nHow to Watch Planet of the Apes in Chronological Order\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) — optional\n\nNew Planet of the Apes Movie: Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"
