        "text": "Woody Harrelson doesn't just bowl in the movies.\n\nThis weekend, the actor from \"Kingpin\" was spotted bowling at Lang's Bowlarama in Cranston.\n\n\"His family and crew came in unexpectedly and had an absolute blast,\" a representative from Lang's Bowlarama told The Providence Journal. \"He had great bowling form, but didn't score too great with the regular 'house balls.'\"\n\nTo be fair, Harrelson should have great form after starring as Roy Munson in the 1996 film directed by Rhode Island's own Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Harrelson, who has won an Emmy and been nominated three times for Academy Awards, is better known for playing bartender Woody Boyd on \"Cheers.\"\n\nFamous People from Rhode Island: How many of these 50 famous people do you know?\n\nHarrelson is in Rhode Island for the filming of \"Ella McCay,\" produced and directed by James L. Brooks and starring Emma Mackey, who played one of the Barbies in the summer blockbuster \"Barbie.\" The movie about an idealistic candidate looking to move up from lieutenant governor to governor.\n\nShooting began on Feb. 5 and will run through late April, with 90% being shot in Providence, including at the State House, around the city, and the rest filming in another undisclosed community.\n\nOn screen: What were actors Jamie Lee Curtis and Woody Harrelson doing in Providence Thursday?\n\nBut before the start of filming, Harrelson had a little fun.\n\n\"They stayed for a couple of hours, had some great drinks and some great fun,\" the Lang's representative said. \"Woody was really calm and cool.\"\n\nLang's Bowlarama, 225 Niantic Ave., Cranston, is a retro bowling alley that first opened in 1960. They're open every day of the week."
