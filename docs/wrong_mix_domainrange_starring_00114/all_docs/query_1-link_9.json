        "text": "I love how these singles don't represent the sound of the album at all.\n\nI think the issue is that there is no one song to represent the album. The album is cohesive and better as a story, told from song 1 to the end. And as cohesive as it is, it goes light to dark, straight forward to the experiment, I'm just not sure there's a song that would sum it up.\n\nSent from my iPhone using U2 Interference\n\nI don't even see the point of a single at this stage, and especially not Song for Someone.\n\nU2 are not at the point of their career where they are going to get a massive chart hit, especially not the third single from an album that was free. If the purpose of the single is more to get a bit of airplay to promote the tour and sell the tickets, then I really don't think a cliche snoozefest is going to do the job. Get people in the door by getting them excited and their blood pumping. Volcano or Cedarwood Road fit that bill.\n\nBut hey, whatever, release another shit song as a single. That seems to have been U2's general approach for a long time now.\n\nSong for Someone is most like the tepid bullshit you'd hear on an \"Adult Rock\" station, so it doesn't surprise me that it would be the next single. It's easily the least memorable single they'll ever release and one of the worst album tracks they've ever done, but it could get noticed by some listeners.\n\nWouldn't surprise me if we got yet another single mix in order to make the track less boring.\n\nBut hey, whatever, release another shit song as a single. That seems to have been U2's general approach for a long time now.\n\nThey must be out of their mind again\n\nThey must be out of their mind again\n\nThey must be out of their mind again\n\nThey must be out of their mind again\n\nThey must be out of their mind again\n\nThey must be out of their mind again"
