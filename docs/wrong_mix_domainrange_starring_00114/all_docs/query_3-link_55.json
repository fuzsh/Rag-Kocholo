        "text": "It’s been years since Kevin Smith first told everyone there would be a “Clerks III.”\n\nThere’s been different scripts, different casts, different plans, but none of it ever materialized ... until now.\n\n“Passion is key to any creative endeavor, but patience and persistence are just as essential,” Smith said in an Instagram post announcing that filming for “Clerks III” would begin in the Garden State next month.\n\nYes, it took a global pandemic to bring back the Quick Stop. Not the one recreated in New Orleans for “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot” (2019), but the actual New Jersey convenience store Smith made famous in “Clerks,” the 1994 feature film debut that made him a name in Hollywood.\n\nThe movie news fulfills a promise Smith, 50, has made on multiple occasions: that he would film “Clerks III” in Jersey or bust (though he prefers to call his home state the “cradle of civilization”).\n\n“Our only budget is for New Jersey,” Smith told NJ Advance Media in March, saying he would most definitely be filming at the Quick Stop in Leonardo.\n\nWhile all of his View Askewniverse films have some New Jersey component and the director is often in Jersey himself, Smith, a Red Bank native who grew up in Highlands, has never actually filmed a feature in his “motherland” since “Clerks” in 1993.\n\n“This is dream-come-true country, Kids!” Smith said in his Instagram post.\n\nThe director cheered news that Lionsgate is funding “Clerks III,” due in theaters in 2022.\n\nSmith’s last View Askewniverse film, “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,” featured appearances from many Smith regulars and friends like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who briefly reprised their various characters. The film, which Smith shot in New Orleans, did not have a traditional theater rollout. The movie premiered in theaters, then the director took the film on a months-long roadshow across the country and beyond, hosting Q&A sessions after each screening.\n\n“Clerks II,” which came out in 2006, was largely based at the fictional fast food chain Mooby’s — which Smith turned into a pop-up restaurant during the pandemic — but “Clerks III” will be centered around the Quick Stop.\n\n“There is a line in the Tao that goes...’To be great is to go on.To go on is to go far.To go far is to return,’” Smith said in his post. “My birthday is August 2. And @lionsgate just gave me the best gift I could ever ask for: the money to make another sequel to my debut film!”\n\nNot that Smith ever went all that far. Sure, he lives in Los Angeles now, but he just made several appearances a few doors down from the Quick Stop this month for the grand opening of his SModcastle podcast theater, located near the old RST Video in the same Leonard Avenue building in Leonardo.\n\nThe Quick Stop is where Smith first introduced the two main “Clerks” characters Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) and Dante Hicks (Brian O’Halloran), along with lovable slackers Jay and Silent Bob, played by Smith and his Highlands friend Jay Mewes.\n\nOf course, Smith’s View Askewniverse has always been a bit autobiographical. When the budding director financed “Clerks” with some maxed-out credit cards in 1993, he was a Quick Stop employee.\n\nIn the upcoming sequel to “Clerks II,” Smith takes inspiration from a major event in his own life: his 2018 heart attack.\n\nBut that’s not all — he revisits that idea he had back in the early ‘90s: to make a feature film at the place where he worked.\n\n“I give Randal the heart attack that almost killed me,” Smith said of the video clerk character. “But rather than succumb to the reality of middle age, Randal rages against the dying light by telling the story of his life in an indie film he shoots with his fellow clerks at Quick Stop! 27 years ago, I made a movie about Dante and Randal that made my dreams come true and changed my life - so now I get to return the favor!”\n\nSmith is so excited about coming back to Jersey to film that he’s already selling “Clerks III” T-shirts at his Red Bank comic shop, Jay and Silent Bob’s Secret Stash (jayandsilentbob.com).\n\nSmith said O’Halloran and Anderson would return as leads alongside Mewes and original “Clerks” actor Marilyn Ghigliotti (Veronica Loughran) as well as “Clerks II” stars Rosario Dawson (Becky), Trevor Fehrman (Elias) and Jennifer Schwalbach Smith (Emma), Smith’s wife. Lisa Spoonauer, who played Dante’s ex-girlfriend Caitlin in “Clerks,” died in 2017.\n\n“Dante! Randal! Jay! Silent Bob! Becky! Elias! Veronica! Emma!” Smith said in his post. “The characters from both Clerks and Clerks II return with me to the scene of the crime at the little store that started it all: Leonardo’s legendary @quickstopgroceries!”\n\nOne of the major obstacles to making “Clerks III” wasn’t Smith’s heart attack but Anderson’s initial resistance.\n\nIn 2019, Smith told NJ Advance Media Anderson didn’t want to commit to another sequel because the actor felt like he wasn’t being valued enough (they have since reconciled).\n\n“It really was less about money and more about value, about respect,” Smith said. “It was an absolute valid point that took a few years to sink in with me.”\n\nOn Nov. 6, the director, who is the showrunner and executive producer of the animated “Masters of the Universe” revival on Netflix, will be at the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park for a screening of the documentary “Clerk,” directed by his friend Malcolm Ingram. The film, which had a virtual premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March, examines Smith’s life growing up in Highlands and his career as a filmmaker.\n\nIn his Instagram post, Smith threw it back to the original tagline for “Clerks”: “Just because they serve you, doesn’t mean they like you.”\n\nAny number of lines from the “Clerks” script resound with Smith fans.\n\n“I’m not even supposed to be here today” is an old standby, one that made it into the National Film Registry with all the others when the Library of Congress recognized the film in 2019.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
