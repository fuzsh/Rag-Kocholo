        "text": "Just when you're trying to catch up for Oscar Sunday, here comes Ghostface as a contender for best murder spree.\n\nThis weekend, the masked villain returns alongside new \"Scream\" franchise stars Jenna Ortega and Melissa Barrera for a New York City-based sixth installment of the horror series. March Madness begins next week, so Woody Harrelson slides his basketball shoes on for another hoops comedy, while Idris Elba reprises his London detective from the British cop series \"Luther\" for a cinematic continuation on Netflix.\n\nHere's a guide to new movies that will satisfy every cinematic taste, plus some noteworthy theatrical films making their streaming and on-demand debuts:\n\nIf you've been watching Ghostface since the 1990s: 'Scream VI'\n\nThe young cast of 2022's fifth franchise film escape the usual haunts of Woodsboro for New York City and of course the stabby antagonist follows them. Full of meta riffs and self-references, the latest chapter doesn't break the mold but uses its franchise history in an intriguing way, getting to know the newer main characters while spattering them in blood during the most vicious \"Scream\" of them all.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\n'Scream VI' review: Ghostface takes Manhattan in a solid but familiar stab-filled outing\n\nIf you're feeling the March Madness: 'Champions'\n\n\"White Men Can't Jump\" fans can see Harrelson hoop it up again, but this time he's on the sidelines as a disgraced coach who had a drunken run-in with a cop car and his community service is leading a team of scrappy youngsters with intellectual disabilities. It's a problematic minefield that director Bobby Farrelly navigates well in the endearing comedy, handling its subject matter with respect and charm even if leaning formulaic.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you're really feeling the March Madness: 'Chang Can Dunk'\n\nBloom Li stars as the title character, a basketball-loving marching band kid who, to impress a new fellow drum line member (Zoe Renee), bets his school's cocky hoops star (Chase Liefeld) that he can dunk in 12 weeks' time. Chang recruits a local YouTube baller (Dexter Darden) to train him up, becomes a social media sensation but makes some mistakes in a satisfying teen twist on the usual underdog sports template.\n\nWhere to watch: Disney+\n\nIf you prefer a broody Idris Elba: 'Luther: The Fallen Sun'\n\nWe've watched Elba punch a lion, tackle monster alien starfish and ride horses recently but there's nothing like seeing him in action as rule-breaking British detective John Luther. After his iffy police work is revealed publicly, Luther is jailed but has to break out to stop a psychopath (Andy Serkis in total creep mode). Cynthia Erivo's crusading detective is a nice addition in this grimly over-the-top and entertaining crime thriller.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nWhy 'Luther' is the coolest character Idris Elba will ever play: 'He's a flawed superhero'\n\nIf you think Mozart should have done more teen movies: 'The Magic Flute'\n\nThere's a pleasant mix of drama, fantasy and sweet tunes in this coming-of-age adventure starring Jack Wolfe as Tim, a youngster sent to a music school after the death of his father. After the pretentious headmaster (F. Murray Abraham) scoffs when the kid wants to audition for \"The Magic Flute,\" Tim finds himself whisked away to the magical landscape of Mozart's opera and is forced to navigate obstacles in both worlds.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you dig modern survival thrillers with heart: 'Unseen'\n\nA breakup leads to Emily (Midori Francis) being kidnapped by her murderous ex and escaping into the Michigan woods, breaking her glasses and leaving her nearly blind. A wrong number, though, links her to Florida convenience store clerk Sam (Jolene Purdy), who attempts to help Emily navigate to safety via FaceTime. Lean and mean at under 80 minutes, it's a tense, clever and subtly comedic story about human connection.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon\n\nIf you're all about dark fairy tales: 'Unwelcome'\n\nAfter a traumatic home invasion, an expecting British couple (Hannah John-Kamen and Douglas Booth) ditches their city digs for a rural Irish cottage they've inherited. But it comes with one rule: They have to leave out fresh red meat daily before sundown or risk upsetting a mystical gang of murderous goblins. The little weirdos become an issue, as does a family of troublesome construction workers, in the nifty indie folk horror flick.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (and Apple TV and on-demand platforms Tuesday)\n\nAlso on streaming"
