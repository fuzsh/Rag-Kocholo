        "text": "FRANKENLUST TOWNSHIP, MI - Scott Dikkers, co-creator of the humorous media outlet called The Onion, says its purpose is simple: to use comedy and fake news reports to say something with a ring of truth to it.\n\nBut there's a problem in 2018, Dikkers told a group of students at Delta College on Tuesday, Sept. 25.\n\n\"This has become a phenomenon that people who should know better are taking The Onion seriously and are running with it,\" Dikkers said, who has an uncanny resemblance to actor Woody Harrelson.\n\nIn its early years, The Onion had cartoons and contests and wasn't the fake news catalyst it is today. But after the first 10 years, Dikkers said making fun of news and society in a traditional Associated Press style was best.\n\n\"So now anything under the sun, you name it, (we) make fun of science, make fun of religion, make fun of human beings, human life, things that happens to us every day,\" he said.\n\nDikkers gave examples of times where people have confused Onion stories as being real.\n\nHe recalled one video story in 2008 about a child with leukemia bankrupting the Make-A-Wish Foundation because he found a loophole in the system - wishing for unlimited wishes.\n\n\"He was surrounded by baseball players, Darth Vader, and they brought on the lawyer from the Make-A-Wish-Foundation who hired an elite team of lawyers to get out of the deal with the kid but the kid wished away the legal team.\"\n\nDikkers said the production of the video was so realistic that he received an angry phone call from the head of the foundation asking him to take down the video because the organization's funders were asking if the foundation was actually going bankrupt because of this kid.\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation had to put a notice on their website that stated it was not going bankrupt, that it was a satirical piece from The Onion and they do not actually give out unlimited wishes.\n\nThe Onion has also confused the nation of China a couple of times with its fake stories as well. One story named North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un the world's sexiest man alive, which the official Chinese news agency reprinted verbatim with the photos The Onion created as well.\n\nThis style of humor, Dikkers said, has opened them up to being sued multiple times, but it never has really gotten past threats because of the right of free speech.\n\nDikkers said they use the First Amendment as a defense thanks in part to a court case involving Larry Flynt, publisher of the pornographic magazine Hustler, which was coincidentally made into a movie starring Woody Harrelson.\n\n\"The way we scare away the threats, we owe it all to Larry Flynt,\" Dikkers said. \"He was being sued by Jerry Falwell in the '80s because he made fun of him. The Supreme Court decided 9-0 he had the freedom of the press and could make fun of Jerry Falwell because he's a public figure.\"\n\nThe Onion is celebrating 30 years of misinforming and misleading those who might not understand its outrageous intent and subtext of comedy and fake news, he said.\n\nMeager beginnings\n\nWhile he was living in Madison, Wisconsin, in the 1980s, Dikkers said he met two college students who had an idea to start a college humor magazine like popular humor magazines National Lampoon and Mad Magazine.\n\nThey didn't have any money at the time and it was a very \"seat of your pants\" operation. They could only afford newspaper print because it was the cheapest.\n\nWhile not ideal, the print worked with the name because Scott said people \"peel back pages of a newspaper to get to the facts\" like layers of an onion.\n\n\"And also Chris (one of the college students) the reason onion was in the air was for breakfast every morning he would eat raw onion chopped up on a piece of untoasted bread,\" Dikkers said.\n\nThough the first issues did not do very well and the two college students he worked with decided they wanted out of the project, Dikkers saved up as much money as he could and bought the paper becoming owner and editor.\n\nPeople often ask him where The Onion finds satire writers because they are considered to be some of the best and many big companies will spend hours trying to find the right talent.\n\n\"They search high and low ... I'll tell you our secret, we did not search high and low, we just searched low,\" he said when they were first starting off looking for writers. \"Dropouts, shut-ins, disaffected liquor store clerks, grocery store clerks.\"\n\nThey were bitter, hateful, had \"no prospects in life\" and it worked out perfectly because he wanted a place for them where they could do some great comedy work.\n\n\"I loved them all, I still love them. They were the misfits, the weirds, didn't fit in anywhere and I wanted to create like a cocoon for them where they could just come and do the thing they love doing,\" he said, adding that they had a pain that he and so many other comedians like Chris Farley, John Belushi or Robin Williams understood.\n\nMany writers who started at The Onion eventually went to work on television shows like \"The Colbert Report\" and \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\"\n\n\"When you finally break through, and you invent this new thing and invent this humor newspaper and people understand what it is, that's pretty wonderful and magical,\" he said, adding that The Onion's most important legacy is it's writers. \"They found a place to flourish as creative people... and so much of the comedy landscape is now propelled by those people.\"\n\nDikkers is also responsible for creating the AV Club, The Onion's sister publication that has actual movie and television reviews and entertainment content.\n\nHe encouraged people to find out what it is they love and do it because nothing is more satisfying than realizing you're living your dream."
