Haunted Houses are common, but not one with THIS kind of ghost! Can Bob the Builder take on the mafia? Probably. \"Inside The Battlefield\" revisits G.I. Joe's and Cobraâs battle of the Weather Dominator, 20 years later.\n\nAKA Smile\n\nSomeone else in the neighborhood helps Jessica and Luke; Kilgrave prepares for a major test of his powers against Jessica.\n\nJohnson & Hopkins\n\nMiami, 1991: When Dwayne gets an on-campus job at the University of Miami, he goes on an epic adventure with his new work partner, Hopkins. Lia returns to the United States after being deported to Samoa, where she was homeless. Rocky and Ata notice that something has changed."
