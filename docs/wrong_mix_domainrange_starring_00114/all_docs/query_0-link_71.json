Woody Boyd, a naïve young man from a small, provincial Indiana town, visits Cheers only to discover that his pen-pal Coach Ernie Pantusso has died; Sam offers him a chance to tend bar at Cheers. Frasier, entering the office, tells Sam that Diane jilted him at the altar, resulting in the loss of his dignity, teaching tenure, and Italian practice. After unsuccessfully scaring Sam with an unloaded revolver, Frasier informs that, according to sources, Diane is now serving a self-inflicted penance at a convent outside of Boston after a spree of decadence in Italy. Against Frasier's wishes, Sam goes to the convent and offers Diane the old job back, but she refuses. Before he leaves, Sam tells Diane that he flew to Italy to stop the wedding and that he had hoped that they would be a couple again.

When she turns down a real person, funeral director Vinnie Claussen (Michael Alaimo), Sam confesses the truth to Carla, that \"Mitch\" is a character created by the men, angering her.

The next day, Sam humiliates the class with his self-praise over his sexual history. Diane takes him to the office and reads the paper to him, which describes him as promiscuous, an aging sexist whose life is \"cheap and pathetic\", and unable to commit to a relationship, putting him at risk of loneliness.

In order to get a job, Norm tries unsuccessfully to impress his clients, Mr. Brubaker (Robert Symonds) and his wife (Frances Bay), by taking them to the bar and Melville's. They turn out to be major bores, and only Cliff, whom Norm warned to stay away, is able to charm them.\n\n8314\"Suspicion\"James BurrowsTom ReederJanuary 16, 1986 ( )25.4 / 36 / #5[23]\n\nDiane studies paranoid behavior among bar mates by hiring Irving (M.
