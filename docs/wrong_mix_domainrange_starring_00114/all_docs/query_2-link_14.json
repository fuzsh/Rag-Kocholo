        "text": "The Third Wheel Gets the Grace\n\nWill (Eric McCormack) returns from vacation to discover that Grace's (Debra Messing) romantic relationship with neighbor Nathan (Emmy-winning guest star Woody Harrelson, \"Cheers\") is humming along - but Nathan feels neglected when Will and Grace resume their chummy friendship, complete with their own private language and code. Meanwhile, Jack (Sean Hayes) proudly takes his newfound son (Michael Angarano) shopping for school at Barney's while Rosario (Shelley Morrison) and Karen (Megan Mullally) each cruise the merchandise looking for the perfect \"anniversary gift.\"\n\nPast and Presents\n\nWill (Eric McCormack) has a fearsome flashback when a former classmate (guest star Adam Goldberg, \"Saving Private Ryan\") who once tormented him as a kid now joins his law firm as a fellow attorney - and when he resumes his evil childhood harassment, Will is tempted to turn to Nathan (guest star Woody Harrelson) for advice. Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) feels shamed when she gives Nathan a gift that is dwarfed by one from Karen (Megan Mullally). Sean Hayes also stars.\n\nLoose Lips Sink Relationships\n\nIn a sneaky ploy to bum a night off from work at Barney's department store, a conniving Jack plays matchmaker and takes advantage of his geeky female supervisor's (guest star Parker Posey, \"Best In Show\") interest in Will (Eric McCormack) - while mindful of Will's fantasy of modeling in the store's catalogue - and he parlays their mutual desires into a \"date,\" even though his unsuspecting friend doesn't have a clue of her intentions. Elsewhere, Grace (Debra Messing) goes where no woman should when she compares her previous sexual experience with her boyfriend Nathan's (Emmy Award-winning guest star Woody Harrelson, \"Cheers\"). Megan Mullally also stars.\n\nThe Rules of Engagement\n\nDuring an intimate moment, Nathan (Emmy Award-winning guest star Woody Harrelson, \"Cheers\") pops the question of marriage to Grace (Debra Messing) but she recoils simply because the situation didn't fit her childhood fantasy of a proposal - and when she realizes her mistake, she intends to return the favor and send out invitations. Meanwhile, Will (Eric McCormack) tries to soothe Grace's ruffled feathers while engaging ethically challenged Jack (Sean Hayes) and Karen (Megan Mullally) over the proper rules of bar-tipping."
