The tired formula may still have some life left in it, but not this 'Way'. This dud ranch is saddled with the charisma-free teaming of dumb guns Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland.\"\n\nYear-end lists[]\n\n5th worst – Robert Denerstein, Rocky Mountain News\n\nTop 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Mayo, The Roanoke Times\n\nDishonorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph\n\nBox office[]"
