        "text": "An HBO crime series starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson filmed over the weekend in the Bonnet Carre Spillway.\n\nScenes for “True Detective” were shot on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The production team leased Montz Park from St. Charles Parish, which served as a staging area for crew members. According to Deadline.com, “True Detective” centers on detectives Rust Cohle (McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Harrelson), whose lives collide and entwine during a 17-year hunt for a serial killer in Louisiana. Deadline says that the investigation of a bizarre murder in 1995 is framed and interlaced with testimony from the detectives in 2012, when the case has been reopened.\n\nThis is the second time in less than two years that McConaughey has filmed in St. Charles Parish. In August 2011, he ventured into Bayou Gauche for “The Paperboy,” which co-starred Zac Effron and Nicole Kidman. The movie, which is now on DVD, follows a reporter who returns to his Florida hometown to investigate the murder of a sheriff.\n\n“True Detective” will be McConaughey’s first regular role in a TV series. Meanwhile, Harrelson is returning to the medium that made him famous as bartender Woody Boyd in “Cheers.”\n\nHBO has not set a premiere date for “True Detective” though the series has reportedly been fast tracked, which means that it could appear next fall."
