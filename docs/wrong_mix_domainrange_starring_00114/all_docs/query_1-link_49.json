        "text": "PROLOGUE – THE LORD OF THE RINGS\n\nGaladriel: The world has changed. I see it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost. For none now live, who remember it.\n\nIt began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the elves: Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-lords: Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine…nine rings were gifted to the race of men… who, above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived…for another ring was made.\n\nIn the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom…the dark lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring…to control all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all.\n\nOne by one the Free Lands of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth. Victory was near. But the power of the Ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded…that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father’s sword. Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth, was defeated.\n\nThe ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend, legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, It ensnared a new bearer.\n\nThe ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there…it consumed him. The Ring brought to Gollum an unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear. And the ring of power perceived…its time had now come.\n\nIt abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.\n\nFor the time will soon come, when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.\n\nCHARACTERS INTRODUCED BY CREDITS\n\n– In order of appearance in the movie\n\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly\n\nThe Ugly (Eli Wallach)\n\nThe Bad (Lee Van Cleef)\n\nAnd The Good (Clint Eastwood)\n\nMean Streets\n\nTony (David Proval)\n\nMichael (Richard Romanus)\n\nJohnny Boy (Robert De Niro)\n\nCharlie (Harvey Keitel)\n\nSnatch\n\nCousin Avi (Dennis Farina)\n\nSol (Lennie James)\n\nMickey (Brad Pitt)\n\nVinny (Robbie Gee)\n\nFranky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro)\n\nTurkish (Jason Stratham)\n\nGorgeous George (Adam Fogerty)\n\nTommy (Stephen Graham)\n\nBullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones)\n\nBoris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija)\n\nDoug the Head (Mike Reid)\n\nBrick Top (Alan Ford)\n\nTrainspotting\n\nRenton (Ewan McGregor)\n\nSick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller)\n\nBegbie (Robert Carlyle)\n\nSpud (Ewen Bremner)\n\nTommy (Kevin McKidd)\n\nThe Faculty\n\nCasey (Elijah Wood)\n\nStokely (Clea DuVall)\n\nDelilah (Jordana Brewster)\n\nStan (Shawn Hatosy)\n\nMarybeth (Laura Harris)\n\nZeke (Josh Hartnett)\n\nThe A-Team\n\nCol.
