        "text": "Lisa Spoonauer, who starred in the 1994 movie “Clerks,” died at age 44 of an accidental overdose.\n\nAccording to TMZ, S poonauer reportedly died of acute and chronic intravenous use of hydromorphone, which is the generic brand of the narcotic Dilaudid. She was also battling cancer, anemia, lung disease and immune deficiency, all of which contributed to her untimely demise. At the time her family said she’d been fighting undisclosed illnesses.\n\nKevin Smith cast Spoonauer in the role of Caitlin Bree in “Clerks,” and posted a touching tribute on Instagram shortly after her passing. Smith wrote that she was one of “the chief architects” of the movie. He recalled that he first met Spoonauer in 1992 in an acting class at Brookdale Community College.\n\n“Lisa was easily the most natural and authentic voice in the room,” Smith wrote. “She didn’t sound like she was acting at all.”"
