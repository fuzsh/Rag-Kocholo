        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate has acquired worldwide rights to Kevin Smith’s Clerks III, which is in pre-production in New Jersey and will begin production next month.\n\nSmith has written the screenplay and will direct, with all major cast members from the first two Clerks films set to reprise their roles: Jeff Anderson as Randal, Brian O’Halloran as Dante, Jay Mewes as Jay, Smith as Silent Bob, and Rosario Dawson as Becky. The film will be produced by Liz Destro and Jordan Monsanto.\n\nIn Clerks III, following a massive heart attack, Randal enlists Dante, Elias, Jay and Silent Bob to make a movie immortalizing his life at the convenience store that started it all.\n\nSmith said, “There’s a saying from the Tao that goes something like ‘To be great is to go on. To go on is to go far. To go far is to return.’ Thanks to Lionsgate, we get to return to where it all started with almost the whole cast that started it all! And for the first time since the first time we ever made a movie in 1993, we’re shooting the entire flick on location in New Jersey, as an ode to both the enduring allure of cinema and the resourcefulness and lunacy of its storytellers. Years ago, Dante and Randal made me a filmmaker – so now it’s time I return the favor.”\n\nEda Kowan, EVP Acquisitions and Co-Productions at Lionsgate, added, “The Clerks movies are audience favorites and many of Kevin’s films like Dogma, Red State, and the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot are a beloved part of our library that continues to delight Kevin’s devoted fans. We’re thrilled to be presenting the next chapter in the Clerks saga to moviegoers worldwide.”\n\nEda Kowan acquired the project and will oversee the film for Lionsgate. Kowan, Grace Duplissea and Kaycee Holcomb negotiated the deal for Lionsgate. Destro and Jackie Eckhouse at Sloss Law negotiated the deal on behalf of Smith and the producers.\n\nThe project is being financed by Three Point Capital and BondIt Media Capital. The executive producers are David Gendron and Ali Jazayeri for Three Point and Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor from BondIt Media.\n\nSmith’s cinematic canon in the Clerks universe includes the original 1994 movie, which turns 27 this year; 2001’s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back; 2006’s Clerks II; and 2019’s Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. On July 23, Smith premieres his animated series Masters of the Universe: Revelation on Netflix."
