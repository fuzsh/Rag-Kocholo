        "text": "The Year was 1994.\n\nNancy Kerrigan is attacked by a bodyguard of Tonya Harding, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon and The World Series was canceled. We lost the likes of Kurt Cobain, Cesar Romero and Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Michael Jordan took a break and allowed another team to win an NBA Championship and the New York Rangers ended a 54-year Stanley Cup drought. There was also a little show called Friends that debuted. I watched 76 films for 1994, ranging from the best, to the worst to the absolute mediocre. Here, I rank my personal Top 10, my least favorite and a few honorable mentions of the year. So, put on Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged album, scream out “HAKUNA MATATA”, because this quack attack is back, Jack. This…is 1994!\n\nAuthor’s Note: These are just my opinions. Friendly and respectable discourse is always welcome. Also, minor spoilers, of course.\n\nFull List on Letterboxd:\n\nSong to Blast: Basket Case by Green Day\n\n10. Speed\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, Joe Morton, Alan Ruck\n\nDirected by: Jan de Bont\n\nWhere to Watch: Starz (Sub), Most Rental Platforms\n\nSpeed is a quintessential high concept action movie that doesn’t take itself too seriously. A bomb on a bus. If it goes slower than 50 MPH, it blows up. Simple as that, and yet, it is one of the coolest, most fun action films of all time. Stars Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have wonderful chemistry, the set pieces are minimal but fun and it keeps you tense the whole ride. I find myself constantly quoting, “IT WAS ONLY CANS!” more often than I should. Speed doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it fits firmly where it needs to, and that’s alright by me.\n\n9. Quiz Show\n\nStarring: Ralph Fiennes, Rob Morrow, John Turturro, Hank Azaria, Paul Scofield\n\nDirected by: Robert Redford\n\nWhere to Watch: Hoopla (Sub), Most Rental Platforms\n\nWhat would you do to win a ton of money on a quiz show? Would you cheat? Would you do whatever it takes? Don’t worry, this isn’t entrapment, just the point of one of the most underrated films of all time. Quiz Show provides an insight into this quandary, while (much like Speed), keeps you on your toes with each and every new development. Slumdog Millionaire borrowed heavily from this, I will not be told otherwise. The acting is otherworldly good, with Ralph Fiennes giving one of his finest performances. I cannot recommend this film enough to anyone who needs a solid drama to watch for the evening.\n\n8. Pulp Fiction\n\nStarring: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken\n\nDirected by: Quentin Tarantino\n\nWhere to Watch: Max (Sub), Most Rental Platforms\n\nI know what you’re thinking: how is Pulp Fiction at number 8?! How is this not number 1?! Look, this is a great film, a masterpiece if you will. There are just some I like more, and that’s okay. That takes nothing away from Quentin Tarantino’s kinetic, off-the-wall, what the Hell is happening crime drama known as Pulp Fiction. Jumping timelines, endless quotable moments and pop culture references only an obsessive person would understand, this movie has created entire personalities for people. Whether it be Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta’s hilariously outspoken hitmen, to Uma Thurman having a drug overdose, to Christopher Walken telling a tale of sticking a watch up his ass, Pulp Fiction has it all and truly needs to be seen to believe. This movie cannot be watched in clips, it needs to be viewed in its full, unadulterated glory.\n\n7. Natural Born Killers\n\nStarring: Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey, Jr., Tommy Lee Jones\n\nDirected by: Oliver Stone\n\nWhere to Watch: Most Rental Platforms\n\nNatural Born Killers is a film I had on my radar for many years and never got around to until now. I am so bummed by this. Originally written by Quentin Tarantino and heavily revised by Oliver Stone, it’s the tale of Mickey and Mallory, two mass murderers that everyone wants to be and everyone needs to see. This film is Bonnie & Clyde shot up with as much cocaine and bloodshed as possible. Every time I thought I knew where this film was headed, it took a sharp left turn. Harrelson and Lewis are meant to be. They fall in love on this set and you fall in love with them, which says a ton more about us than it really should, right? Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that everyone who loves him as Iron Man should go back and watch his earlier works. This film is a bloody good time (both figuratively and literally) and should be viewed as soon as possible.\n\n6. Leon, The Professional\n\nStarring: Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman\n\nDirected by: Luc Besson\n\nWhere to Watch: Most Rental Platforms\n\nThere were a lot of violent, gang and drug related movies in 1994, weren’t there? Leon, The Professional (sometimes called Leon, sometimes called The Professional) is one hell of a ride. We follow our titular character as he protects a little girl (played by a very young Natalie Portman) from a gang who murdered her family. Leon is a badass hitman, but also one who cares deeply for this girl, wants to protect her, wants to teach her. Where the film heads is always a fun ride, filled once again with so much violence and bloodshed, it’s hard not to turn away, but your eyes remain glued to the screen. Gary Oldman, as usual, is on another planet with his acting and I am always here for it. There’s a ton of heart to this film, as well. It’s the total package. Damn, this is a good year!\n\n5. Ed Wood\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray, Lisa Marie, George “The Animal” Steele\n\nDirected by: Tim Burton\n\nWhere to Watch: Most Rental Platforms\n\nAfter years of quirky and unabashed dark films such as Beetlejuice, Batman and Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton decided to do what some would consider a “normal” film. Well, normal for him. Ed Wood is about, well, Ed Wood, the prolific bad movie maker responsible for films such as Plan 9 From Outer Space, Glen or Glenda and Night of the Ghouls. A biopic that actually sets out to explore the man instead of what made him famous, Ed Wood is a brilliant take on this damaged person, one who doesn’t know who exactly he (or they) is, but has to put all of that into his strange style of filmmaking. This, to me, is Johnny Depp’s best performance. He is amazing, truly encompassing this role in his wacky Depp way. The rest of the cast is also amazing and Burton’s plan to put everything in black and white to make it seem like a film from a bygone era is top notch.\n\n4. The Crow\n\nStarring: Brandon Lee, Rochelle Davis, Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott\n\nDirected by: Alex Proyas\n\nWhere to Watch: Paramount+ (Sub), Hoopla (Sub), Most Rental Platforms\n\nWell, we took a slight detour with the wacky comedy of Ed Wood. Now, we’re back to an ultra violent, balls to the wall action-horror-thriller hybrid in The Crow. Based on the comic book of the same name, The Crow is pure vengeance, pure love and pure insanity from the moment the film starts. The elephant in the room will always be the late, great Brandon Lee, as he was accidentally killed on set. He, however, is the dark and brooding energy this film needs. Eric Draven, simply put, is out for revenge for those who killed his fiancee. By any means necessary. The film is improved by its over the top deaths, stoicism and excellent locations and sets. This film feels timeless but also so 1994 at the same time. As of this writing, the new adaptation starring Bill Skarsgaard is not out yet, but if you do see it without seeing this classic, get on this one as soon as possible. It can’t rain all the time.\n\n3. The Lion King\n\nStarring: Matthew Broderick, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Moira Kelly\n\nDirected by: Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff\n\nWhere to Watch: Disney+ (Sub), Most Rental Platforms\n\nIs there a more millennial film on this list than The Lion King? What can I say about this Disney classic that hasn’t been said before? It’s perfect from start to finish. The animation is picture perfect. The voice acting is top tier. It’s got loads of comedy, the most tender moments and heartbreak, all wrapped up in an excellent Disney package. You know the songs, of course. I bet you’re humming “I Just Can’t Wait to Be King” or “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” right now. Maybe you have a Hakuna Matata tattoo. Maybe, just maybe, you’ve named one of your pets Simba or Nala. The lasting impact of this film has been going strong for 30 years and that is a testament to how impactful and wonderful of a film it is. And if you don’t like it, well, you just may be the idiot we’re all surrounded by (I joke, of course).\n\n2. Clerks\n\nStarring: Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Lisa Spoonauer\n\nDirected by: Kevin Smith\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix (Sub), Hoopla (Sub), Most Rental Platforms\n\nIs there a more Generation X film on this list than Clerks? Look, if you’ve gotten this far, you either hate this pick or love this pick. Kevin Smith is simultaneously the most beloved and hated man by users of the internet. It’s crazy that a man who made his living off dick and fart jokes and doing exactly what we all do on a daily basis in discussing what we love and hate about pop culture can be so maligned. But that’s beside the point. Whatever you think of the man, there is no denying that Clerks is a cultural touchstone, a true inspirational film that proves that anyone, if they’re willing to try (and take out a few small loans) can make a film. It may end up bad, but you can do it. Dante and Randal are the two dorkiest wannabe cool guys to ever talk about Clash of the Titans and Star Wars. They’re foul mouthed, they’re crude and they have no idea how to talk to women. They’re tired, they’re bored, they want a better life for themselves that they can never accomplish. If this sounds like you (and face it, at least one of these qualities hits), Clerks is the movie for you. It’s as 90s slacker as you can get. This is an Andy Warhol painting in motion. It’s a perfect movie, even if it is as basic as it comes. Anything that came after may be up for debate, but there is no debate that Clerks is an important film that inspired a lot after.\n\n1. The Shawshank Redemption\n\nStarring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown\n\nDirected by: Frank Darabont\n\nWhere to Watch: Most Rental Platforms\n\nWell, here it is. You had to have known The Shawshank Redemption was going to be number one. This film has topped so many lists for decades. It’s at the top of both IMDB and Letterboxd’s greatest narrative films. It’s considered the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel. But what makes it such a beloved film? Why has it stood the test of time? Simply put, it’s everything. As basic as it sounds, everything in The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect amalgamation of filmmaking. The acting, the sets, the costumes, the story, the score, the location, the realism, the heartbreak, the triumph. You feel each and every aspect of these details as you watch it.\n\nA movie that makes grown men weep (not that there should ever be a problem with that). A film that inspired many to even attempt to make a film this cohesive. It blows my mind this film did not win any of the SEVEN Academy Awards it was nominated for. Retroactively, let’s give it at least Best Picture. I was lucky enough to see this spectacle on the big screen for the first time this year and I wish I could have done it twice. Every character mattered to me. Every scene resonated with me. Every jump in time made me wish for the moment Andy Dufrense crawled through 500 yards of shit smelling foulness I can’t even imagine. I love this movie. Face it, you do, too.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nD2: The Mighty Ducks, Forrest Gump, Hoop Dreams, Interview with the Vampire, True Lies, Little Women, The Mask, Reality Bites, New Nightmare\n\nNot Listed\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness (Wide Release in 1995)\n\nWorst Film of Year\n\nIt’s Pat\n\nStarring: Julia Sweeney\n\nDirected by: Adam Bernstein\n\nWhere to Watch: Most Rental Platforms\n\nSome Saturday Night Live sketches are able to sustain their comedic chops for a full length motion picture. Wayne’s World, The Blues Brothers and MacGruber all had charm and stood the test of time. It’s Pat, based on one of the dumber sketches in SNL history, does not work. It’s shockingly unfunny. It’s not even offensive, it just doesn’t make you laugh. Worst off, it’s boring. Five minutes a week was too much for this character, imagine how excruciating 78 is.\n\nHonorable Mentions"
