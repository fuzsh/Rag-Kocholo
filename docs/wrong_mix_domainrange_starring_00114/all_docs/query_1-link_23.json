        "text": "“Hunger Games” fans know Coriolanus Snow as the viscous and diabolical president of Panem (played by Donald Sutherland in the original four movies), but in “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” he is a young man being slowly corrupted by government forces. A war has left his family in financial ruin, which makes the prospect of winning the 10th Hunger Games enticing. He becomes a mentor to Lucy Gray Baird and their relationship complicates his plan.\n\nSnow in “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” is played by English actor Tom Blyth, best known until now for roles in films such as “Scott and Sid” (2018) and “Benediction”(2021). He also plays the title character in Epix’s Western series “Billy the Kid,” which is currently airing its second season.\n\n“It’s very easy to kind of paint [Snow] as the baddie because he definitely is — I mean baddie in the bad way, not the good way — not the Instagram baddie, he’s a real baddie with a capital B,” Blyth told Variety at the film’s London premiere. “But I think for me, the exciting part is getting to answer those questions that I think we all had when we watched the original films, which is ‘How did he get like this?’ And maybe look at his humanity and dig into it a little bit.”\n\nLucy Gray Baird is the female tribute from District 12 in the 10th Hunger Games. She is a member of a traveling musician group known as the Covey, and her blossoming connection to mentor Coriolanus Snow complicates her time in the games. She is a singer who is the original writer of “The Hanging Tree” within the franchise’s universe.\n\n“We channeled a bunch of people: Patsy Cline and Dolly Parton and Joan Baez, to name a few,” Zegler toldVariety at the film’s premiere about constructing her character. “That was really the voice that we were trying to find. But getting to sing live is my bread and butter, that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life and so it was really nice to get to bring that skill to my peers on set.”\n\nZegler is best known for her starring role as Maria in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story,” which won her a Golden Globe for best actress in a motion picture musical or comedy. She had a supporting role earlier this year in Warner Bros. comic book tentpole “Shazam! Fury of the Gods,” and she’s starring in the title role of Disney’s 2025 live-action “Snow White” movie.\n\nSejanus Plinth is one of Snow’s closest friends in the Capitol. He becomes a mentor to a tribute from District 2 during the 10th Hunger Games. Sejanus himself is from District 2, and the disturbing events of the games and how the Capitol government treats the tributes slowly unravels his psyche over the course of the story.\n\nRivera is a relative newcomer, and “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” is sure to be his biggest breakout role yet. He has musical chops and toured with the company of “Hamilton” during the Tony winner’s first national tour. He starred with Zegler in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” in the role of Chino, and he had a supporting role in the Sundance premiere “Cat Person.” Following “Hunger Games,” Rivera has booked a buzzy role as Aaron Hernandez in Ryan Murphy’s upcoming “American Sports Story.”\n\nRivera revealed to Variety that he’s currently in the process of beefing up to transform himself into the Patriots football player, who was later convicted of murder. “I have a trainer, I’ve been really diligent on fitness and working on and getting my body right first and foremost,” he said. “There’s a lot of studying about the NFL that has to go into something like this. We have terrific script writers, we have terrific producers.”\n\nAn older Tigris Snow was mostly cut out of the “Hunger Games” movies with Jennifer Lawrence, but her younger self is far more prominent in “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” prequel. She is Snow’s older cousin and his closest confidante. She advises him as he becomes a mentor in the 10th Hunger Games and has a more sympathetic outlook on the tributes than her cousin does. She will later become an ally of Katniss.\n\n“I literally made my own costume to be a Capitol person when I was in middle school when I was a huge fan of the books,” Schafer told Variety about her love of the franchise. “So it’s really full circle, the universe is at work. Because we’re all adults now! And now all these new kids will get to experience it.”\n\nSchafer is beloved for her breakout role as Jules Vaughn on HBO’s teen drama television “Euphoria,” which also served as Schafer’s acting debut. She has starred on the show for two seasons, and a third season is expected to film next year for a 2025 release.\n\nJason Schwartzman stars as Lucretius “Lucky” Flickerman, a presumed ancestor to Caesar Flickerman (played by Stanley Tucci in the original films). Similar to Caesar, Lucky is the flashy and motormouthed host of the Hunger Games who knows how to turn every interview into a viral media moment. Schwartzman told Variety that director Francis Lawrence gave him the freedom to come up with the bulk of Lucky’s interview and hosting dialogue. It wasn’t exactly improvisation, but Schwartzman had the freedom to change the script.\n\n“Francis gave me such freedom to come up with all these parts and bits, so they were sort of improvised but we came up with a lot of them,” he said. “He said to have something ready for every moment so that we could cut to you. We wrote 50-something pages of ideas and every morning and I’d go in with sheets of paper and talk to Francis at lunch. He’d pick everything. It wasn’t just free for all. It was amazing.”\n\nOscar winner Viola Davis stars as the villainous Dr. Volumnia Gaul, the head game-maker for the 10th Hunger Games and the key figure who implemented the games in the first place. Asked by Variety at “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” premiere in Los Angeles if she found any good in the villain, Davis responded: “I did not. I did not see that in the book. I do believe that as a general rule you have to find the good in a character. But I did not see that in her. That’s why she was more fun, because I didn’t have to find the humanity in that. She relished the evil. She relished the evil because that was a great weapon to survive the dystopia.”\n\nDirector Francis Lawrence says he was inspired by Willy Wonka when bringing Dr. Gaul to life on the big screen, but Davis did not pull from any previous big screen villains. “No not really. I didn’t think of that,” she said. “I was thinking of me. I was in survival mode. I wish I could come up with something awesome for you, but I can’t.”\n\nLysistrata Vickers is Snow’s friend and classmate in the Capitol who becomes a mentor to a tribute from District 12 during the 10th Hunger Games. Lucy Gray is the female tribute from District 12 and is mentored by Snow, while Jessup is the male tribute and mentored by Lysistrata. The latter is played by Zoe Renee, who has had roles in festival movies such as the SXSW coming-of-age drama “Jinn” and the Sundance horror favorite “Master.” She also starred in the Disney+ original sports movie “Chang Can Dunk” and appeared on the BET series “The Quad.”"
