        "text": "I am pleased to announce my new position as Studio Manager at Orange Video! Orange Video is a full service video production company based out of Tallahassee, Florida. I have worked with Orange Video previously as a Production Assistant last December for a three day production. I then got asked to step into the part-time role of Studio Manager at the beginning of April. As a Studio Manager I help with the pre-production and post production process and assist with business running smoothly. I am so grateful for this opportunity and I am excited to learn more about the production process!\n\nThe amount of applicants LinkedIn shows have applied is not true. I repeat. The amount of applicants LinkedIn shows have applied is *not true*. My team at nextOPP Search is currently recruiting for a number companies, from inside their ATS (Greenhouse, Ashby, Workable, Lever, Recruitee, and more) and I am baffled by the misinformation. A job I posted 3 days ago via the company ATS shows 100+ applicants on the LinkedIn posting. In the ATS? 36. So please don't be put off by the competition. It's fake news! Apply. You've got this.\n\nüé¨ That's a wrap on 2022! We're grateful for every one of our clients that made last year possible, here's just some of the work we created together. Stick around to see what 2023 has to offer!
