Known best for his stoner movies - from Clerks to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - Kevin Smith joins Tommy Chong and Seth Rogen as film director/actors who've been voted Top CelebStoners.

Born in Red Bank, New Jersey on Aug. 2, 1970, Smith made his directing debut with Clerks in 1994. Set in a convenience store, Clerks features two iconic Smith characters: Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (himself). They hang outside a nearby video shop and deal weed.

Smith followed with Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Clerks II. They all featured Mewes and Smith in their Jay and Silent Bob roles.

To promote Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back in 2001, Smith appeared on the cover of High Times holding a platter full of marijuana. He said at the time:

'While I’m not as out there for legalization as someone like Woody Harrelson, I’m certainly not one of those people who think it belongs on a banned substance list. It should be off and legalized.'

According to Wikipedia, Smith didn't start smoking pot until he directed Rogen in Zack and Miri Make a Porno in 2008. Smith credits Rogen with turning him on.

His latest films - Cop Out, Red State and Tusk - do no include Jay and Silent Bob, and marijuana. However, to promote Tusk, Smith asked the Buds & Roses dispensary in Los Angeles to create several new cannabis strains - Mr. Tusk and White Walrus. He went to the shop and posed in the grow room with their grow team.

Smith owns Jay & Bob's Secret Stash comic-book store in Red Bank, where they sell his Bluntman & Chronic series among many other current and collectible issues. He also has the production company, View Askew.

Smith's married and has a daughter. They live in New Jersey.
