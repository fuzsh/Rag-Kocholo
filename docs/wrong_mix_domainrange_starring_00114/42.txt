Cheers actor Woody Harrelson, who lost his place as a Mardi Gras grand marshal after he was seen supporting an anti-war rally, has accepted another invitation to New Orleans. Harrelson will take part in the Backstage '91 gala March 17, in which locals are given the chance to mingle with celebrities to raise money for the homeless, said Sister Jane Remson, director of New Orleans Artists Against Hunger & Homelessness.

"It's a cause to which he is very much committed," she said. "He said that since he won't be shooting then, he can make it, and he's very glad to be coming."

Harrelson plays bartender Woody Boyd in the TV series.

Harrelson's invitation to lead the Feb. 9 Krewe of Endymion parade was withdrawn after a television station showed film of him applauding at a California rally against the Persian Gulf war.

Among those attending the gala at the New Orleans Museum of Art will be Danny Glover, Jimmy Buffett and 10 Rita Coolidge, activist Dick Gregory and local musicians including Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas and the Dixie Cups.
