This is the case number\n\n8 IT-97-25-T, the Prosecutor versus Krnojelac.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: I thought we had finished with this witness.\n\n10 MS. KUO: No, Your Honour.\n\n11 JUDGE HUNT: All right, then. Please proceed.\n\n12 MS. KUO: Thank you\n\n13 WITNESS: FWS-172 [Resumed]\n\n14 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\n15 Examined by Ms. Kuo: [Continued]\n\n16 Q. Witness just before we broke yesterday we were discussing this\n\n17 piece of paper where you had written the names of people who were taken\n\n18 away and disappeared. The last question that was asked by the presiding\n\n19 judge was regarding whether this was prepared when you were being\n\n20 questioned by an investigator. Do you remember that?\n\n21 A. I prepared that list just after I got out of prison. I repeat, in\n\n22 order to be able to prove ...\n\n23 JUDGE HUNT: Wait a minute. Excuse me, sir. We have a technical\n\n24 problem.\n\n25 Can you hear us now? Right. Well, you did not get any of the\n\nPage 4583\n\n1 answer, I think, so perhaps, Ms. Kuo, you could ask the witness to repeat\n\n2 his answer.\n\n3 MS. KUO:\n\n4 Q. Witness, because of a technical problem we were not able to record\n\n5 your answer. Can you just repeat it?\n\n6 A. Yes. Just after I was released while my memory was still fresh,\n\n7 in relation to the people who were taken out during the night, beaten up,\n\n8 and who were never returned to our rooms, I made a list of these people\n\n9 and I handed over that list with their names to the investigators.\n\n10 Q. Now, Witness, we did see this typewritten list yesterday, but\n\n11 later in your testimony you refer to people who were taken away at the end\n\n12 of August, the 25th, the 27th, and then also the 30th of August. Did you\n\n13 prepare a separate list for that?\n\n14 A. Yes.\n\n15 Q. When did you prepare that list? Was it also immediately after\n\n16 your release?\n\n17 A. No. I did not prepare that list. I dictated that list during the\n\n18 investigations, to the best of my memory.\n\n19 Q. With the assistance of the usher, I'd like to have this witness\n\n20 shown ID 301.\n\n21 What is that, Witness? Is that the list that you have been\n\n22 referring to, that you dictated?\n\n23 A. Yes. This list in the first part relates to people who were taken\n\n24 out in larger groups, about 18 or 20, in two parts. One group was taken\n\n25 out on the 25th of August, and the other one on the 27th of August. I\n\nPage 4584\n\n1 cannot exactly distinguish between these people who was taken out in which\n\n2 group, that is, because quite a bit of time has gone by, so I can't tell\n\n3 now.\n\n4 Q. Witness, yesterday you gave us the names of some of those people.\n\n5 Does looking at this list which -- does looking at this list refresh your\n\n6 memory as to any other people who were taken out during that time?\n\n7 A. Right now, I cannot remember any more people except for these who\n\n8 are mentioned here. This other part of the list relates to people who\n\n9 were taken out between the 30th and 31st of August because we were also\n\n10 taken out on the 29th and we spent the night --\n\n11 Q. Witness, please.\n\n12 A. -- in the compound.\n\n13 Q. Please, let's just concentrate on the 25th and the 27th. My\n\n14 question was -- you mentioned yesterday several people taken out during\n\n15 that time, and you told us that you could not remember any other people\n\n16 unless you looked at the list. The list is before you now. Could you\n\n17 tell us now, in addition to the people you mentioned yesterday, were there\n\n18 other people that were taken out those two days, the 25th and 27th of\n\n19 August. Now that you've looked at the list, can you tell us from the\n\n20 list any other people?\n\n21 A. I can't remember any more names except for those that I've\n\n22 already listed, in those two days.\n\n23 Q. The people that you've written down on this list -- this is your\n\n24 handwriting, right?\n\n25 A. Yes.\n\nPage 4585\n\n1 Q. How many names are on the list for the 25th and 27th, written\n\n2 down?\n\n3 A. Between 36 and 40, approximately. Not only here in terms of what\n\n4 I did, but those are the ones that I counted as they got out during those\n\n5 two days.\n\n6 Q. The exhibit -- I'm sorry, not the exhibit, the piece of paper\n\n7 before you is a little bit difficult for someone to read who can't read\n\n8 your handwriting. Could you just read it out to us, the names of the\n\n9 people from the 25th and 27th of August?\n\n10 A. Yes. The following were taken out: Munim Kameric, Dervo\n\n11 Cankusic, Resko Hadzimesic, and his brother who is not entered here.\n\n12 Serif Hadzic, Esad Sero and two of the Nukic brothers, I don't know their\n\n13 names. Saban Durak, Zaim Rikalo, Hajro Sabanovic, Miralem Ramovic, Nusret\n\n14 Salcinovic. He was taken out exactly on the 27th, I remember that. And I\n\n15 remembered another one, Emsad Sabanovic. I remembered it just now because\n\n16 there were two Sabanovics.\n\n17 They were taken out on the 25th and the 27th of August, but I\n\n18 cannot exactly distinguish between the two groups, who was taken out on\n\n19 the 25th and who on the 26th, except for that one name I mentioned to you\n\n20 already.\n\n21 Q. Witness, you also said there were 20 people taken out of the group\n\n22 of 55, and those 20 people were primarily younger men, and that they\n\n23 disappeared. Could you tell us their names now?\n\n24 A. When we were in the mess hall in the restaurant where we ate, when\n\n25 we waited there for a long time too see what would happen to us.\n\nPage 4586\n\n1 Q. Witness, please just answer the question. Give us the names.\n\n2 We've already heard you yesterday tell us what happened. We just need the\n\n3 names of the 20 people.\n\n4 A. I can mention some, but not all of them. Out of the people who\n\n5 were taken out with me in the direction of Niksic because I said already\n\n6 that we did not get any papers or anything, we didn't know where we were\n\n7 going to --\n\n8 Q. Witness --\n\n9 A. -- or what was going on. When they returned us --\n\n10 Q. Witness, please. You have a piece of paper before you. Just tell\n\n11 us the names on the paper of the 20 people. I know it's not complete,\n\n12 but just read us the names.\n\n13 JUDGE HUNT: And may I add to what counsel has said to you, sir,\n\n14 we really only want you to answer the questions. We have a great deal of\n\n15 evidence now from other sources about the matters of which you may want to\n\n16 speak. We only want you to answer the questions that counsel asks of\n\n17 you. We don't have time to hear all of this again.\n\n18 A. Yes. The following were taken out: Asim Mujic, Karabegovic, a\n\n19 taxi driver, Ismet Cemo, Ismet Pasovic, Sevko Hodzic, Emin Smajkan, Asim\n\n20 Nesbur and his brother, a young man nicknamed Zuga, I can't remember his\n\n21 real name. And then also a younger man Dudic, and a certain Mujo\n\n22 Rizvanovic, and Granov Murat.\n\n23 Those are the people who were taken out of our group in two\n\n24 intervals, ten by ten. All trace has been lost of them. I never received\n\n25 any information as to any one of these people still being alive.\n\nPage 4587\n\n1 Q. There's a second sheet to that paper and it appears there are more\n\n2 names. Are those more of the people taken out at that same time? Please\n\n3 turn the sheet over.\n\n4 A. These other names relate to persons who have university degrees.\n\n5 Mostly younger people. There are even more of them, but I just mentioned\n\n6 some --\n\n7 Q. Okay, well --\n\n8 A. -- who are missing. They also haven't been heard from since.\n\n9 Q. Were they taken out also in that group of 20, or is that a\n\n10 separate group?\n\n11 A. These are separate groups. I did not mention in this group that\n\n12 these people were taken out. These people were taken out in separate\n\n13 groups.\n\n14 Q. The people on this second sheet that you said had university\n\n15 degrees, when were they taken out?\n\n16 A. Some were taken out during the night. Among those from the list\n\n17 that I read out yesterday, and others were taken out later, perhaps. I'm\n\n18 not sure. I cannot say exactly who was taken away when.\n\n19 Q. All right. Well, we're done with that piece of paper, Witness.\n\n20 You can put it away.\n\n21 Witness, you mentioned that of the people that you described as\n\n22 being missing, that you've never heard from them again, were you in a\n\n23 position such that if they were still alive, you would either -- you would\n\n24 know about it or have been contacted by them?\n\n25 A. Yes. They were my acquaintances. They would have expressed\n\nPage 4588\n\n1 interest in me just as I expressed interest in them. However, I haven't\n\n2 found out from any of their relatives or anyone that there's any hope that\n\n3 they had survived.\n\n4 Q. Witness, you gave a statement in 1992 and to the State Commission\n\n5 for Gathering Facts on War Crimes, and according to that statement it\n\n6 says, in describing a group that was taken out on the 25th of June, 1992,\n\n7 that \"They may have been taken to Bileca to be court martialled there but\n\n8 according to another version they were killed.\"\n\n9 Q. Do you know why -- was there ever any mention of a court martial\n\n10 in Bileca?\n\n11 A. Court martials were dealt with over the radio. Whether it was in\n\n12 Foca or Bileca I can't exactly say. To be quite frank with you, we had\n\n13 smuggled in a small transistor radio, and on a news programme it was said\n\n14 that a court martial had been established in the Crisis Staff in Foca. It\n\n15 was headed by Boja, a lawyer; Milic, the judge; and also Skipnja, Cedo,\n\n16 and Starevic. I can't remember this person's first name.\n\n17 Q. Witness --\n\n18 A. And also, a Stankovic. I also don't know his first name. I\n\n19 didn't manage to register all of that.\n\n20 Q. Witness, when people were taken out and you later never heard from\n\n21 them, were they ever told that they were going to be court martialled in\n\n22 Bileca?\n\n23 A. Court martials were never referred to, only exchanges.\n\n24 Q. Witness, could you tell us whether role call was taken at the\n\n25 detention in the evening or in the morning?\n\nPage 4589\n\n1 A. These people who were taken out had their names read out from the\n\n2 door by a guard, and then they had to leave. Every evening in the rooms\n\n3 there was a role call, and the names of all of those who were present were\n\n4 read out.\n\n5 Q. Was this information given to the guards at KP Dom? Were they the\n\n6 ones who took the role call?\n\n7 A. Yes. The guards took the role call, and then they knew how many\n\n8 of us spent the night in that room. If somebody went missing during the\n\n9 night, the next day a new list was made out and then they would insert\n\n10 various things in, who you were, what you did, et cetera. So names were\n\n11 not repeated in these lists or during the role call.\n\n12 Q. You said the next day a new list was made out. Who would make the\n\n13 new list?\n\n14 A. It was we who had remained in those rooms who made these lists.\n\n15 Usually it was Ismet Causevic who did it. He was an art teacher, so he\n\n16 had very nice handwriting, and he made the list usually.\n\n17 Q. Did the detainees make the list on their own initiative in the\n\n18 mornings after people, after people disappeared, or were you asked to do\n\n19 that by the guards?\n\n20 A. They asked the detainees to do it.\n\n21 Q. Who is \"they\"?\n\n22 A. The guards who were in the compound, or some of the guards -- or,\n\n23 rather, employees from the administration.\n\n24 Q. And you said that this was only -- was this true -- did this occur\n\n25 only in the mornings after people were taken out and disappeared, or was\n\nPage 4590\n\n1 it every morning?\n\n2 A. Only in the morning after people had been taken out during the\n\n3 night.\n\n4 Q. So would these lists made in the morning show that, in fact,\n\n5 people had disappeared at night, and who those people would be?\n\n6 A. We only knew about the room that we were in, our room, but we\n\n7 didn't have information about the other rooms.\n\n8 Q. Did that -- was it true for your room, then, if people were taken\n\n9 out from your room, that it would be clear reading the list in the morning\n\n10 that certain people disappeared?\n\n11 A. Yes.\n\n12 Q. Do you know who the warden of the KP Dom was when you were\n\n13 detained there?\n\n14 A. Yes. It was Milorad Krnojelac. Before that, he was employed in\n\n15 the elementary school, Veselin Maslesa. He taught physics and\n\n16 mathematics.\n\n17 Q. Did you see Mr. Krnojelac at the KP Dom?\n\n18 A. Yes, I saw him twice in the compound, in the afternoon, in\n\n19 uniform. He was armed with a pistol. He didn't have any other weapons.\n\n20 Q. What kind of uniform was he wearing?\n\n21 A. What kind of uniform? A camouflage war uniform, when I saw him.\n\n22 Q. Those two times when you saw him, what was he doing?\n\n23 A. He was simply strolling around the compound. I don't know what\n\n24 his exact assignment was.\n\n25 Q. Do you know who the prior warden was?\n\nPage 4591\n\n1 A. The prior warden was Radojica Tesovic.\n\n2 Q. Do you know why he was not warden during the time that you were\n\n3 detained at KP Dom?\n\n4 A. To tell you the truth, I cannot confirm that information because I\n\n5 do not know why he was replaced and why the other one was appointed.\n\n6 Q. Did any detainees who had come from Velecevo tell you that they\n\n7 saw him there?\n\n8 A. Yes. They told me that they saw him up there. Whether he was in\n\n9 charge of that plant up there or not, he didn't know himself.\n\n10 Q. Did the detainees tell you what they saw him doing there?\n\n11 A. Since there was a farm up there, there were cows and hens, et\n\n12 cetera, they saw him gathering eggs and packing them, I guess for selling\n\n13 them later.\n\n14 Q. Did you know Mitar Rasevic?\n\n15 A. Yes, I did know Mitar Rasevic. He was Commander of the guards in\n\n16 that camp.\n\n17 Q. How do you know that he was Commander of the guards?\n\n18 A. Once a piece of news leaked that an escape was being prepared from\n\n19 the prison, that is. The commander of the guards came with two guards to\n\n20 our room and he said as we talked, \"We have some indications to the effect\n\n21 that a getaway is being prepared.\" I personally laughed, and I answered\n\n22 that question in the following way: \"Where to? Out of these walls? There\n\n23 are guards all around.\"\n\n24 There were even two machine-guns from the administration building\n\n25 that were facing the rooms where the detainees were. They were pointed at\n\nPage 4592\n\n1 us, and we could see them together with sandbags.\n\n2 The next day there was an order, or whatever, that Uzeir\n\n3 Hadzialic, also an inmate, a detainee, a locksmith, that he cut all the\n\n4 bars on the windows in -- on the ground floor, or rather, that he welded\n\n5 all the bars and the nets on the ground floor windows and on the\n\n6 first-floor windows.\n\n7 Q. Can you explain to us what you meant by that, that he welded these\n\n8 bars? Did he put -- did he install bars so that detainees would not be\n\n9 able to escape?\n\n10 A. Yes.\n\n11 Q. Was that on order of the KP Dom administration?\n\n12 A. It was on somebody's orders, and who else could it have been but\n\n13 the administration.\n\n14 Q. Were land mines also put in around this time?\n\n15 A. A day or two went by, I can't remember well, but it is true that a\n\n16 platoon of soldiers came and that they placed mines on all the lawns\n\n17 within the compound and around it. This is proven by the fact that there\n\n18 were explosions during the night. I don't know whether it was cats or\n\n19 dogs that activated the mines. Even a guard or an employee at the KP Dom,\n\n20 I'm not sure which one, was wounded, wounded in the leg. That's what we\n\n21 found out.\n\n22 Q. Could you -- do you remember when this was, when Mitar Rasevic\n\n23 came and spoke to the detainees?\n\n24 A. It never -- oh, Mitar, I'm sorry. I thought you meant somebody\n\n25 else. Mitar, he talked before these bars on the windows were welded, and\n\nPage 4593\n\n1 also before mines were placed round the compound.\n\n2 Q. Do you remember approximately what date or what month it was?\n\n3 A. I cannot remember the date. I think it was the month of June,\n\n4 though.\n\n5 Q. You mentioned that a piece of news had leaked about an attempted\n\n6 escape. Could you tell us what that was?\n\n7 A. As far as I know, before in peacetime, allegedly a prisoner\n\n8 escaped from that prison through a small opening in the toilet that was\n\n9 not sufficiently protected. That opening was in that transit room. And\n\n10 in all fairness, it could be used for an escape because it was on the\n\n11 ground floor, and one could jump out without getting hurt. And since\n\n12 there was quite a bit of construction material up there, it was assumed\n\n13 that planks could be put up, although it would involve casualties because,\n\n14 of course, they would shoot, right? But then on the other hand, not every\n\n15 bullet hits its target.\n\n16 However --\n\n17 Q. Witness, was there discussion among the detainees in your room\n\n18 about how would could try to escape?\n\n19 A. Well, this was not directly discussed. Everybody shrugged their\n\n20 shoulders. It's hard. There were guards all around, at every corner.\n\n21 And also, on the administration building where those weapons had been\n\n22 placed, there was always a guard who was on duty by these weapons.\n\n23 Q. Witness, what I'm interested in is the statement you made a few\n\n24 minutes earlier that a piece of news leaked. What was that piece of\n\n25 news? Did the detainees talk at some point about trying to escape, and\n\nPage 4594\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4595\n\n1 that's why Mitar Rasevic came because he heard it or heard about it?\n\n2 A. Well, this piece of news leaked about a day or two later, perhaps\n\n3 after he came. Whether there was a bug, I don't know. Maybe they were\n\n4 eavesdropping. Maybe some of the guards said it because he himself could\n\n5 not make such an assumption.\n\n6 Q. The guards would have heard the detainees talking about methods of\n\n7 escape; is that what you mean?\n\n8 A. If there was a bug, they could have heard it; if not, they\n\n9 couldn't have. They couldn't have listened otherwise to our conversations\n\n10 in that room.\n\n11 Q. Witness, regarding Mr. Rasevic, I'd like to ask you about a\n\n12 statement that you made in 1995 to the Security Services Centre in which\n\n13 you said, \"The duties of prison commander were performed by Mitar\n\n14 Rasevic.\" Can you explain what you meant by that?\n\n15 A. The warden was the person to whom all the employees in that camp\n\n16 were subordinated, and Mitar Rasevic was commander of the guards. He\n\n17 assigned duties.\n\n18 Q. Let me ask you about medical care for the detainees. What kind of\n\n19 medical care were the detainees able to obtain?\n\n20 A. There were two doctors in that prison. One was a general\n\n21 practitioner, a detainee, and another one was a surgeon, but they couldn't\n\n22 perform any medical checkups on detainees. There used to come Cedo\n\n23 Dragovic from the hospital. He was a gynaecologist by specialisation, and\n\n24 detainees would come to him for medical checkups if they felt they needed\n\n25 one, if they felt they needed medical assistance.\n\nPage 4596\n\n1 Q. Were you able to get the medical care that you needed?\n\n2 A. One time I asked to be seen by a doctor, and since I knew Dr. Cedo\n\n3 I went there. I had had a fever for several days. I asked him to give me\n\n4 some medicine. He just shrugged his shoulders and looked at a guard who\n\n5 was standing nearby, and he gave me a painkiller called Andol to lower my\n\n6 temperature. And he advised me to drink as much fluid as possible.\n\n7 However, I couldn't get much tea to drink because all the tea we got was\n\n8 at breakfast and dinner.\n\n9 Q. Were detainees who did not have acquaintances or connections from\n\n10 the hospital, were they able to get medicines and things like that?\n\n11 A. They went for checkups. They were seen by a doctor, but I don't\n\n12 know what they received in terms of medication. I didn't see it, so I\n\n13 cannot say. I swore before this court to speak the truth, and I'm\n\n14 speaking the truth only.\n\n15 Q. Thank you, Witness. Yesterday you talked about some work groups.\n\n16 Were there also some detainees taken to work at a fishpond in Jelec?\n\n17 A. That fishpond was kept by the prison in peacetime, and then when\n\n18 the occupation and military operation started, they were afraid that this\n\n19 fishpond would run to seed. So a work group once went there to catch the\n\n20 larger fish and put them up for sale at the market.\n\n21 Q. When was that?\n\n22 A. That was in end April or early May, perhaps.\n\n23 Q. Do you know if work groups went to the fishpond later in the\n\n24 summer, or was that the only time?\n\n25 A. I don't know whether it was once or twice that they went there.\n\nPage 4597\n\n1 All I know from those who had been there is that they released the fish\n\n2 into the rivers, Govza and another river.\n\n3 Q. During the course of the summer, did any work groups go further to\n\n4 catch fish or work at any fishponds as far as you know?\n\n5 A. I don't know that they were catching or fishing. I know about\n\n6 groups who went to unload flour from mills in Ustikolina.\n\n7 Q. Witness, we don't need --\n\n8 A. Also until before the end -- before mid-May.\n\n9 Q. We don't need to hear about that any further; we have other\n\n10 witnesses who have given us that evidence already.\n\n11 Let me ask you about blood donations. Were detainees ever asked\n\n12 to make blood donations, and if so, when?\n\n13 A. Yes. I mentioned when I was speaking about the wounding of the\n\n14 warden's sons in Bota during the explosion, a medical technician appeared\n\n15 at the KP Dom on that day. He served under Bota, I believe, and he asked\n\n16 whether anyone wanted to volunteer for donating blood. People gave a\n\n17 large amount of blood. I believe there were 70 donors or so.\n\n18 Q. You said that they asked for volunteers. Were the detainees\n\n19 promised anything in return for giving blood?\n\n20 A. I don't know whether they had been promised anything, but I do\n\n21 know that they eventually received a pack of cigarettes and a small tin of\n\n22 canned meat, perhaps 100 or 150 grams a can.\n\n23 Q. How many times were people requested to give blood?\n\n24 A. That lasted for a number of days. A team from the medical centre\n\n25 was coming for several days running to take the blood.\n\nPage 4598\n\n1 Q. Did you give blood?\n\n2 A. No.\n\n3 Q. Did a television crew ever come to the KP Dom, and if so, were\n\n4 they allowed to speak with the detainees?\n\n5 A. As far as I know, sometime in July, in the beginning of July, a\n\n6 team of journalists came, and among them were some foreigners, and outside\n\n7 Rooms 11 and 13 they stood without going in. They wanted to talk to us\n\n8 detainees. There was Dr. Torlak in our room who spoke some English, and\n\n9 there was a Gordan Mujicic, we called his Gordo, who spoke French well.\n\n10 Standing at the window, we shouted, Gordo specifically shouted and\n\n11 waved his hands, motioning the journalists to come closer, and the woman\n\n12 who was an anchor in television - I know her because she was a teacher --\n\n13 a pupil of my mother's, my mother was a teacher. Her last name was\n\n14 Gigovic. She was Vesna Gigovic. She waved her hand and the guards\n\n15 commander, Rasevic, came then and turned the team away. They didn't allow\n\n16 them to come closer to our rooms and talk to us.\n\n17 Q. Was this team, the TV crew, was it then a Yugoslav crew, or was it\n\n18 a foreign crew, English speaking?\n\n19 A. I don't know what language they spoke. We assumed that perhaps it\n\n20 might be a foreign television crew, and therefore the people among us who\n\n21 could speak foreign languages came forward. But I knew this one\n\n22 journalist who worked in Novi Sad, and there was a crew from the Novi Sad\n\n23 television station.\n\n24 Q. Witness, during the more than four months that you were detained\n\n25 at KP Dom, can you tell us how your health was affected?\n\nPage 4599\n\n1 A. Well, to tell you the truth, I weighed around 100 kilos, or\n\n2 perhaps between 89 and 100 kilos, and after I was released, I lost -- I'd\n\n3 lost 14 kilos. And I suffer from obstructive nephritis and I have to use\n\n4 medication all the time, and I'm suffering from a strong spasm in that\n\n5 area. That's as far as my health is concerned.\n\n6 Q. Finally, can you tell us how this detention affected you\n\n7 psychologically?\n\n8 A. Well, I don't know how to explain it to you. When I was once\n\n9 again among normal people, they seemed to look at me all the time. They\n\n10 seemed to think I was too thin. It seems I'd lost a lot of weight,\n\n11 perhaps, because I was resettled in a community where there had been no\n\n12 military operations. Novi Pazar, Niksic, and that's where I spent the\n\n13 rest of my time before returning to Sarajevo in 1995.\n\n14 MS. KUO: Your Honours, those are the questions of the\n\n15 Prosecution.\n\n16 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you. Cross-examination, Mr. Vasic.\n\n17 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n18 Cross-examined by Mr. Vasic:\n\n19 Q. [Interpretation] Good morning to you, sir.\n\n20 A. Good morning.\n\n21 Q. I am Milorad Vasic, one of the Defence counsel of the accused\n\n22 Krnojelac.\n\n23 Sir, during your examination-in-chief, you told us the address at\n\n24 which you resided in Foca before the start of military operations. Can\n\n25 you tell us which part of town it was where you lived? Will you just\n\nPage 4600\n\n1 please wait for the interpreters to interpret our question and then make a\n\n2 pause before answering so that our participants can hear the\n\n3 interpretation of my question and your answer properly.\n\n4 A. May I?\n\n5 Q. Yes, go ahead.\n\n6 A. [redacted]\n\n7 [redacted]. [redacted]\n\n8 [redacted]\n\n9 Q. Do you know that at the beginning of the conflict, some houses\n\n10 owned by ethnic Serbs burnt down, including the house of Milorad\n\n11 Krnojelac?\n\n12 A. At that time I was still working, and I heard the news that some\n\n13 buildings had burnt down not far away from the hospital, including some\n\n14 houses near the health centre; but as far as Milorad Krnojelac's house is\n\n15 concerned, I hadn't heard anything.\n\n16 Q. Thank you, sir. You said that after being away from work you came\n\n17 back to the institution where you were employed. Did you see any road\n\n18 blocks in Donje Polje at the time?\n\n19 A. Because I was down there, I didn't see anything except for a\n\n20 vehicle down there at the bridge. Whether it was a road block or just a\n\n21 vehicle, I don't know.\n\n22 Q. Were there any persons around the vehicle at the time?\n\n23 A. From my side of this passage from the medical centre -- from my\n\n24 house to the medical centre, no, there weren't any.\n\n25 Q. During your examination-in-chief, you said that Serbian forces\n\nPage 4601\n\n1 walked in to the institution where you worked after a couple of days\n\n2 because no resistance was offered?\n\n3 A. No, there wasn't any resistance.\n\n4 Q. Will you please wait a little for two reasons: For other people\n\n5 to hear the interpretation, and second, your voice is protected and while\n\n6 my microphone is turned on, there can be no voice distortion.\n\n7 If you look at the monitor in front of you, you will be able to\n\n8 follow --\n\n9 A. There is nothing whatsoever on my monitor.\n\n10 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, we're trying to enable\n\n11 this voice distortion as far as we can.\n\n12 JUDGE HUNT: Yes.\n\n13 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Protect the witness.\n\n14 JUDGE HUNT: We'll have it turned on for the transcript.\n\n15 Now, sir, you'll see in front of you a transcript, and the Court\n\n16 reporter here is typing the translation so that when the typing finishes\n\n17 you know the translation has finished. So just wait until you see the\n\n18 typing finish before you answer any question.\n\n19 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation]\n\n20 Q. I'll repeat my question. So you said during your\n\n21 examination-in-chief that Serb forces, after a couple of days, walked into\n\n22 the hospital because there was no resistance there. My question is, why\n\n23 didn't they enter that institution earlier if, as you say, there was no\n\n24 resistance?\n\n25 A. I cannot tell you the reason. Perhaps there was some protection,\n\nPage 4602\n\n1 some defence lines in the outer circle like the Mijakovici village. Maybe\n\n2 they couldn't get in.\n\n3 Q. Does it mean that in the wider area of Donje Polje there was\n\n4 resistance on the part of ethnic Bosniaks and that is the reason why they\n\n5 hadn't entered earlier?\n\n6 A. People who had personal weapons may have tried to defend\n\n7 themselves because they were in danger.\n\n8 Q. Do you know that at the beginning of the conflict, in April of\n\n9 1992, there were Muslim military units at the KP Dom for a while?\n\n10 A. No, there weren't. That's for sure.\n\n11 Q. Why are you so sure that they -- that there hadn't been any? Did\n\n12 you have occasion to see the KP Dom and who occupied it before Serb forces\n\n13 took over this part of Donje Polje?\n\n14 A. You asked whether Muslim forces had been at the hospital, and I\n\n15 maintain that there hadn't been any.\n\n16 Q. I didn't ask you about the hospital. I said, is it true that in\n\n17 April 1992, at the beginning of the conflict, there were Muslim forces at\n\n18 the KP Dom?\n\n19 A. In my statements I stated that I went to hospital, to the hospital\n\n20 [redacted] on the 10th of April, and that from that time on I had no\n\n21 information as to where anyone was, and I couldn't claim anything about\n\n22 that.\n\n23 Q. Could you tell us how far is this hospital from the KP Dom?\n\n24 A. 800 metres away, perhaps.\n\n25 Q. While you were at the hospital, did you have opportunity to hear\n\nPage 4603\n\n1 about fighting taking place nearby?\n\n2 A. Shooting could be heard, of course, and another proof of fighting\n\n3 is the arrival of wounded people that I mentioned before.\n\n4 Q. Yes, sir. It is true you stated in your examination-in-chief that\n\n5 at that time, it was mainly civilians who were brought to the hospital.\n\n6 Who except civilians was brought?\n\n7 A. No one else after the hospital was taken over by occupying forces,\n\n8 [redacted] the time. When the forces entered the hospital, I\n\n9 can't say whether it was three or four days later, two uniformed persons\n\n10 of Serbian ethnicity were brought. In fact, one of them was an ethnic\n\n11 Hungarian, and he was an alcoholic, delirious at the time. And when I\n\n12 talked to him he told me he was a professional soldier, that he had been\n\n13 on the battlefield for eight years, that he had been on all front lines in\n\n14 all the wars.\n\n15 Another case that I remember was a younger man, a disabled man.\n\n16 His right arm was missing. He was also armed. I was so afraid that I\n\n17 didn't dare ask him even his name. I was afraid that something bad might\n\n18 happen to me.\n\n19 Q. Could you tell me, in which language did you speak to that ethnic\n\n20 Hungarian?\n\n21 A. Our language, the Bosnian language, the Serbo-Croat. He could\n\n22 speak it.\n\n23 Q. Thank you, sir. During your examination-in-chief you mentioned\n\n24 that soldiers had brought Mr. Salimovic and Mr. Cankusic to the hospital?\n\n25 A. Yes.\n\nPage 4604\n\n1 Q. Do you remember the date when that happened?\n\n2 A. I cannot say exactly whether it was the 17th or the 18th of April,\n\n3 one of those two days for sure. And maybe ...\n\n4 Q. You also said that Dr. Supic wanted to keep these persons in\n\n5 hospital. Can you tell me what is Dr. Supic from an ethnic point of view?\n\n6 A. He is a Serb, and he's a professional, and he carried out his\n\n7 duties in a professional manner.\n\n8 Q. You told us what regrettably happened to these persons, and you\n\n9 said that you saw these persons while Dr. Zijo Ajanovic was identifying\n\n10 the persons who were killed. Who were the persons that were then\n\n11 identified by Dr. Ajanovic, do you know?\n\n12 A. These persons, in addition to Cankusic and Selimovic, the ones I\n\n13 mentioned are Isanovic, Delic, Sandal, and the one who was shot at in\n\n14 front of the hospital who fell into the cemetery at Patkovina, Sejdin, a\n\n15 younger man, and also Bostandzic. Those are the corpses that I personally\n\n16 saw at the morgue.\n\n17 Q. Thank you, sir. Sir, in the second statement you gave to the\n\n18 investigators of the OTP in 1999, did you say that persons between the age\n\n19 of 16 and 75 were arrested and taken to the KP Dom, and persons who did\n\n20 not belong to a single political party or those who were very old or who\n\n21 were not considered dangerous were allowed to stay at home? Is that what\n\n22 you stated? Is that correct?\n\n23 A. As far as I can remember, out of the detainees who arrived in the\n\n24 camp, there were persons belonging to various groups, young, elderly,\n\n25 there were some who were even older than I was, considerably older. As\n\nPage 4605\n\n1 for town, I did not realise whether there were any men left, whether there\n\n2 was anyone except for women and children.\n\n3 Q. Yes. But on page 2 of your statement from 1999 it says that you\n\n4 stated the following. Would it help you if I read it out to you?\n\n5 A. If there is such a piece of paper, I would like to see it, and I\n\n6 would like to see what I said and where.\n\n7 Q. That is document ID 298, and also 298A. The B/C/S version,\n\n8 paragraph 3, second sentence: \"Persons between the age of 16 and 75 were\n\n9 arrested and taken to the KP Dom, while people who did not belong to a\n\n10 single political party or those who were very old and not considered\n\n11 dangerous were allowed to stay at home.\"\n\n12 A. I know that a group of older people were released from prison at\n\n13 the beginning of May. I don't know whether I mentioned all of that.\n\n14 Among these persons are some survivors as well, but those persons had to\n\n15 report every day to the SUP. That's the statement I made.\n\n16 Q. Thank you, sir. Was communication between detainees at the KP Dom\n\n17 prohibited, and was it restricted to persons who were staying in the same\n\n18 room only?\n\n19 A. Communication among detainees in the KP Dom was prohibited. We\n\n20 never got out of the rooms except for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We\n\n21 only communicated amongst ourselves in our rooms, except for the persons\n\n22 who went out to work. They managed to have contacts.\n\n23 Later, the persons from all rooms were taken to one room, that is\n\n24 to say, persons who worked. They were all supposed to be together so\n\n25 that they would not have any contacts with us.\n\nPage 4606\n\n1 Q. Is that your assumption, that they were separated into one room so\n\n2 that they would not have contact with you, or do you know about that?\n\n3 A. I know about that because persons from my room who worked were\n\n4 taken to this separate room, and they could be seen.\n\n5 Q. Weren't people who worked singled out and put into one room so\n\n6 that they would be concentrated all in one place, not so that they would\n\n7 be isolated from contact with other detainees?\n\n8 A. Both, because those who went out, they could get information from\n\n9 citizens, other citizens outside, and they could convey this information\n\n10 to us. That's what they were afraid of.\n\n11 Q. Thank you, sir. Tell me, please, until the 15th of May, 1992,\n\n12 were visits allowed by family members to detainees at the KP Dom?\n\n13 A. Yes.\n\n14 Q. Were detainees allowed to receive clothes and food?\n\n15 A. Clothes, yes, but under strict control rules -- food with strict\n\n16 control.\n\n17 Q. You mean provided that there was strict control over what was\n\n18 brought?\n\n19 A. Yes, strict control. Not in the rooms. Detainees were taken out\n\n20 to a special separate room for that by the entrance into the\n\n21 administration building, and not in larger groups or anything. The\n\n22 maximum was two detainees, and the family members who came to visit them,\n\n23 and this was once in 15 days.\n\n24 Q. Were these rooms for visits?\n\n25 A. As for the person -- as for the purpose, well, this was just a\n\nPage 4607\n\n1 room on the right-hand side when you enter the hallway.\n\n2 Q. Thank you.\n\n3 A. You're welcome.\n\n4 Q. Tell me, while you were at the KP Dom, did you take showers?\n\n5 A. In four months while I was there, we had only three organised\n\n6 baths, only three.\n\n7 Q. In response to my learned friend's questions, you spoke about\n\n8 medical care. Were you visited by a doctor at the KP Dom once a week?\n\n9 A. Once, yes, but perhaps even more because I did not report to a\n\n10 doctor during that interval. I cannot say with 100 per cent certainty\n\n11 whether there were other people from the room reporting to the doctor, but\n\n12 I can confirm that the doctor came in once a week.\n\n13 Q. Sir, did you state to the investigator of the OTP that at first\n\n14 prisoners got eggs and pate for breakfast, and that then this stopped?\n\n15 A. At first we would sometimes get one egg, one slice of bread, and\n\n16 tea, which was not really sweet; and then the next day we would get a can\n\n17 of pate which would be shared between two prisoners. At any rate, a loaf\n\n18 of bread weighing 650 grams was sliced into ten slices. Now, you divide\n\n19 that by ten, so you see how much you get, 6 and a half grams.\n\n20 Q. Thank you, sir. You talked about blood donations today in\n\n21 response to my colleague's questions, and you said that that had to do\n\n22 with the wounding of a person named Bota and the sons of Milorad\n\n23 Krnojelac. Why did you not mention this until now in your statements?\n\n24 A. I don't know how the questions were put, in which order, but I\n\n25 stated that during every interview I had, whoever I talked to. How these\n\nPage 4608\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4609\n\n1 corrections were made, I don't know in relation to this last question.\n\n2 Q. In your statements, either in the one you made to the state\n\n3 security station in Konjic or in the two statements that you gave to the\n\n4 State Commission for Collecting Facts about War Crimes, or in the two\n\n5 statements that you gave to the investigators of the OTP, is there any\n\n6 mention that blood donations were given because of this? Did you talk\n\n7 about it at all during your interviews then?\n\n8 A. I claim now and in response to these questions that were put, on\n\n9 all four occasions, if I was asked -- I mean, it's been nine years and\n\n10 memory fades, but I stand by this. Before blood had never been required\n\n11 from the detainees until that moment.\n\n12 Q. When were detainees donating blood at the KP Dom? Can you give us\n\n13 the date?\n\n14 A. This was in mid-June. I can't remember the date.\n\n15 Q. Did this happen during the first half of June?\n\n16 A. I'm not sure whether it is the first half of June or mid-June. I\n\n17 can't say. It's been a lot of time since then.\n\n18 Q. Were the persons you mentioned injured in the same accident?\n\n19 A. Do you refer -- are you referring to Bota and also to his sons?\n\n20 Q. Yes.\n\n21 A. According to the information we received, it was the same day.\n\n22 Q. Do you know that a person called Bota together with a military\n\n23 policeman was injured on the 17th or 18th of June when he fell into an\n\n24 ambush and was wounded by a bullet?\n\n25 A. I'm not aware of that. I never mentioned that anywhere.\n\nPage 4610\n\n1 Q. Are you aware of the fact that the sons of Milorad Krnojelac were\n\n2 injured during another accident when they, together with nine other\n\n3 persons, were in a truck that hit a mine?\n\n4 A. The information we got was that they entered a minefield somewhere\n\n5 around Tjentiste.\n\n6 Q. Are you aware of the fact that this event took place five or six\n\n7 days after the event concerning the person nicknamed Bota took place?\n\n8 A. I'm not aware of that.\n\n9 Q. Thank you, sir.\n\n10 In response to my learned friend's questions, you said that you\n\n11 were interrogated in the KP Dom, first by an interrogator who was called\n\n12 Koprivica, and then by an interrogator called Vladicic. Do you know that\n\n13 a person called Zoran Vukovic, who was chief of the military police, also\n\n14 carried out investigations at the KP Dom?\n\n15 A. I personally do not know Zoran Vukovic. I personally was\n\n16 interrogated by Vladicic, and Koprivica had actually started and then that\n\n17 was interrupted, and then Vladicic finished.\n\n18 Q. In response to my learned friend's questions yesterday and today,\n\n19 you spoke about the lists that you made. In addition to the list of\n\n20 persons who were taken out in groups from the KP Dom Foca between the 26th\n\n21 of June until the 15th of July, 1992, and the list of persons who were\n\n22 taken out that is marked ID 301 and that relates to the month of August,\n\n23 did you also make a list of employees in the KP Dom?\n\n24 A. As far as I could remember. I did make a list of those who I\n\n25 remembered.\n\nPage 4611\n\n1 Q. When did you compile this list of employees from the KP Dom?\n\n2 A. Just after I got out of prison while I still remembered these\n\n3 persons, because time makes you forget. I could not list all of them\n\n4 now.\n\n5 Q. That means in 1992?\n\n6 A. In 1992.\n\n7 Q. In part of this list that is called \"inspectors, investigators,\"\n\n8 in addition to Zoran Vladicic and Koprivica, nicknamed Kopi, you also\n\n9 mentioned Zoran Vukovic for the military police.\n\n10 A. I mentioned that because he is chief of the military police.\n\n11 That's what I heard. But he did not interrogate me.\n\n12 Q. He Did not interrogate you, but he was an investigator at the KP\n\n13 Dom?\n\n14 A. Yes. I said that I did not know him, nor do I know who that man\n\n15 is. I don't know him until the present day.\n\n16 Q. Can you then explain how come his name appeared on the list of\n\n17 investigators that you compiled in 1992 if you don't know him and if you\n\n18 don't know who he is?\n\n19 A. Other persons told me that he was chief of the military police in\n\n20 town and that he brought into custody many, many persons who were in\n\n21 prison.\n\n22 Q. When did you talk to these persons who gave you information about\n\n23 Zoran Vukovic?\n\n24 A. When we got out of prison. The group of those who survived,\n\n25 together with me.\n\nPage 4612\n\n1 Q. Where did you talk to them, in which place?\n\n2 A. In Novi Pazar.\n\n3 Q. Can you tell us who are the persons with whom you talked about\n\n4 details related to the KP Dom in Novi Pazar in 1992?\n\n5 A. The persons who got out with me. The persons who got out with me\n\n6 to Novi Pazar. There were 35 of us who had left Foca and reached Rozaje.\n\n7 About ten remained in Rozaje as they found their families there. The\n\n8 rest, 22, 23, 25, I'm not sure, since there wasn't enough room there for\n\n9 us to be accommodated, we were transferred to Novi Pazar to a centre there\n\n10 called Rajcinovic Banja. We found quite a few refugees from Foca there,\n\n11 and all these refugees started asking about their own family members as to\n\n12 where they are and whether they had survived. So there was a lot of\n\n13 talking going on.\n\n14 As for the people who were with me, there was Asim Cankusic,\n\n15 Hadzimuratovic. He was a forwarder from Gornje Polje. And another\n\n16 Hadzimuratovic from Jelec. Then Juso Cemo, Almas Kruho, Rahman Salkija,\n\n17 and another Rahman, Fajko Tafro -- Faik Tafro, Safet Kumro, and I cannot\n\n18 remember the rest right now.\n\n19 Q. Thank you, sir. So after these conversations and after this\n\n20 exchange of information, you compiled a list of employees at the KP Dom?\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. On the basis of conversations and joint memory, did you compile\n\n23 the other list that my learned friend asked you about here in the\n\n24 courtroom?\n\n25 A. You mean these lists of persons who were taken out of the camp?\n\nPage 4613\n\n1 Q. Yes.\n\n2 A. Yes.\n\n3 Q. In the list of employees at the KP Dom, did you say that Savo\n\n4 Todovic is an interrogator who is responsible for a lot of mistreatment of\n\n5 Bosniaks?\n\n6 A. I did not say that about Savo Todovic. I just knew that he was\n\n7 allegedly the assistant warden, and that he knew what happened, just like\n\n8 the warden did with these persons who were no longer there.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: May I remind you, sir, to watch that screen before\n\n10 you answer the question. You have been doing very well, but that answer\n\n11 came in a long way before the interpreters had finished.\n\n12 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation]\n\n13 Q. This list of employees at the KP Dom that you compiled, as you\n\n14 said, on the basis of conversations you had with other persons who left\n\n15 the KP Dom, is that the opinion based on the conversations that you had\n\n16 with other persons that you mentioned under number 3, Savo Todovic, an\n\n17 investigator responsible for a lot of mistreatment and killings of Bosniak\n\n18 civilians?\n\n19 A. Yes.\n\n20 Q. Thank you, sir. During your interrogation at the KP Dom, did the\n\n21 investigator ask you about whether you knew about Bosniak Muslim persons\n\n22 who had stolen medicines from the hospital in Foca?\n\n23 A. Yes, he asked me about that.\n\n24 Q. Thank you. Tell me, did Inspector Vladicic, after he concluded\n\n25 his questioning, did he say that you would be taken to trial?\n\nPage 4614\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4615\n\n1 A. Yes. Let me explain about the medicines. He asked me where the\n\n2 medicine [redacted] had gone, and also [redacted].\n\n3 My answer was that I did not use medicine, or rather, that I did not\n\n4 distribute it. I just asked for medicine for time to time [redacted]\n\n5 [redacted]. And then I said that he had to inquire in the pharmacy as\n\n6 to who had been given these large quantities of medicine.\n\n7 During the interrogation, as it ended, when he offered me this\n\n8 statement so that I could sign it, I tried to read it, but he warned me\n\n9 that I should sign it without reading it.\n\n10 Q. Please go ahead.\n\n11 A. He warned me that this would be taken to court, and he also asked\n\n12 me whether I wanted him to write down that I had killed ten persons as\n\n13 well. And I said that he can write whatever he wants to, that I was in\n\n14 his hands, and that I was powerless.\n\n15 Q. You've already explained that.\n\n16 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I'm afraid it's 11.00 so\n\n17 perhaps it would be a good time to take a break.\n\n18 JUDGE HUNT: Yes. There will be a reference in his third last\n\n19 answer that will have to be redacted, but I'll make sure that's done\n\n20 during the adjournment so that it will not be broadcast.\n\n21 We'll resume at 11.30.\n\n22 --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.\n\n23 --- On resuming at 11.31 a.m.\n\n24 JUDGE HUNT: Mr. Vasic.\n\n25 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation]\n\nPage 4616\n\n1 Q. Sir, in response to my learned friend's question about persons\n\n2 whom you say were taken out on the 26th and 27th and taken perhaps to\n\n3 Bileca to a court martial, were you saying that it was a military court\n\n4 martial?\n\n5 A. I have no information to the effect that it was a court martial.\n\n6 They only said that the court has been established in Foca. That was the\n\n7 information broadcast by the media. That was my response to the question,\n\n8 whether it existed or not, whether somebody had ordered for somebody to\n\n9 deliver those people to that court.\n\n10 Q. Sir, in your statement given to the State Commission for\n\n11 Collecting Facts on War Crimes, on the 23rd September 1992, did you say\n\n12 that the persons taken away from the KP Dom to Bileca to court martial,\n\n13 and in another version, that they were killed?\n\n14 A. In that statement I said that those persons, as far as I was able\n\n15 to find out, were taken for exchanges because there was a front line then\n\n16 at -- near Dubrovnik, and my information was that those people were being\n\n17 exchanged and that those people had never been heard from again.\n\n18 Q. Did you state that you had heard that those people had perhaps\n\n19 been taken to Bileca to a military court martial?\n\n20 THE INTERPRETER: The interpreters have the same problem as a\n\n21 couple of days ago. We don't hear everyone on channel 7, so I may have\n\n22 lost the witness's answer.\n\n23 JUDGE HUNT: Just one moment, Mr. Vasic. We have a problem here.\n\n24 The interpreters did not hear the answer to that question. Perhaps you\n\n25 should ask him to -- ask him the question again, unless you can recall\n\nPage 4617\n\n1 what his answer was.\n\n2 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] I'll ask my question again.\n\n3 Q. Did you say to the State Commission for Collecting Facts on War\n\n4 Crimes that persons who were taken away from the KP Dom on the 26th\n\n5 February were taken perhaps to the court martial, and in another version,\n\n6 that they may have been killed?\n\n7 A. I said not only about the persons who were taken out on the 25th\n\n8 of June, but persons who were on the longer list, who were taken out in\n\n9 smaller groups, that I had information that they may have been taken for\n\n10 an exchange to the Dubrovnik front, and because Mate Vancic was among\n\n11 those people, and Kruno, who dabbled in journalism, they were not of the\n\n12 same ethnicity. And I doubted it could have been true. I -- perhaps\n\n13 it was true, perhaps not. Maybe the accused can tell the Honourable Court\n\n14 where these people are.\n\n15 Q. Sir, do you know a person by the name of Dzevad Smajkan?\n\n16 A. I know Sacir Smajkan, but not Dzevad.\n\n17 Q. Do you know whether Sacir Smajkan had been detained in the\n\n18 Ministry of the Interior of Trebinje, the SUP of Trebinje?\n\n19 A. I have no such information.\n\n20 Q. Thank you, sir. Did you state to investigators of the office of\n\n21 the Prosecutor that those who were going to work considered themselves\n\n22 lucky because they received food in addition to what they were getting at\n\n23 the KP Dom?\n\n24 A. We considered that they were in an advantageous position because\n\n25 they had opportunity to contact more people, maybe even some people from\n\nPage 4618\n\n1 the town. And if nothing else, fruit was available then in July and\n\n2 August, and they could eat more. We learnt from them that they got an\n\n3 extra meal called \"snack\" while we did not have that and we were starving.\n\n4 Q. Thank you, sir. We discussed already today the lists that you\n\n5 have drawn up, lists of people who had been taken out. Can you tell me\n\n6 about these people who were taken in groups from the KP Dom from the 26th\n\n7 of June to the 15th of July, ID 299? When did you draw it up, in 1992\n\n8 when you were released, or after your return in 1995?\n\n9 A. I drew up that list immediately after I got out of prison while I\n\n10 still had a fresh memory because I knew those people, and as everyone\n\n11 knows, time means forgetting. I could have probably listed more of them\n\n12 if I had known what had happened to those people. As far as I know, those\n\n13 people in larger groups were saying they were going to be exchanged. I\n\n14 hadn't known that then.\n\n15 As for smaller groups who were taken out during the night, I came\n\n16 to the conclusion that they were killed. And from what I know, shots were\n\n17 heard, screaming, and moaning, and sounds of beating, and for all I know,\n\n18 they have never been heard from again. They never reappeared again. And\n\n19 I am asking this Honourable Court to have the accused tell us where these\n\n20 people are so that they can give -- so that they can be given a proper\n\n21 burial.\n\n22 JUDGE HUNT: Sir, I understand your concern about this matter,\n\n23 but that is not something that really can we do in the course of your\n\n24 evidence, so will you please just get on with your evidence and leave that\n\n25 point to one side.\n\nPage 4619\n\n1 A. Thank you.\n\n2 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation]\n\n3 Q. Sir, do you possess the original of this list, because you said\n\n4 these were copies?\n\n5 A. The list I had yesterday is the original. Maybe I haven't\n\n6 included everyone in that list because I didn't see everything. Maybe\n\n7 other people can give some more information. The number may be larger.\n\n8 Q. So this list, the photocopy of which you handed over to\n\n9 investigators of the OTP, the lists of people taken out from June to July,\n\n10 corresponds to the list made in 1995?\n\n11 A. Yes, it does, except for the part which concerns Uzeir Cankusic,\n\n12 Adnan Isanovic, and another person. Those people were shot outside the\n\n13 hospital in the beginning. I think they are in the list as well.\n\n14 Q. Yes, it says so in the list, but I'm interested in something\n\n15 else. On which typewriter did you type this list and where?\n\n16 A. In Novi Pazar in one of the socially-owned premises.\n\n17 Q. Is that a typewriter, or was it a computer?\n\n18 A. An ordinary typewriter. I had a handwritten list which I\n\n19 destroyed after I typed it out.\n\n20 Q. When you were drawing up and typing that list, were you alone, or\n\n21 were you in the company of other former detainees who left the KP Dom\n\n22 together with you?\n\n23 A. Since I had a list written in pencil, I was alone when I read that\n\n24 list and gave it to a typist who typed it. And I can say that Dzemo,\n\n25 Vahida, should also be on the list and is not included.\n\nPage 4620\n\n1 Q. Thank you, sir. Concerning the list of people taken out in August\n\n2 about which you told us that it was drawn up in 1997 [Realtime transcript\n\n3 read in error \"1992\"], is it your handwriting, or is it somebody else's?\n\n4 A. It's my handwriting.\n\n5 MS. KUO: Your Honours, I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's a\n\n6 discrepancy in what the question was and what's on the transcript, but I\n\n7 also think there was a factual error in that. Mr. Vasic said 1997, the\n\n8 transcript shows 1992, but in fact I think it was 1992. So perhaps we\n\n9 could have that question asked to the witness.\n\n10 JUDGE HUNT: Perhaps we should ask you what your qualifications\n\n11 are in - I hope I get the letters right - B/C/S.\n\n12 MS. KUO: But the translation, Your Honour, said 1997. That's\n\n13 what I heard.\n\n14 JUDGE HUNT: The translation, I see.\n\n15 MS. KUO: And the transcript says 1992.\n\n16 JUDGE HUNT: But you say it should be 1992 anyway.\n\n17 MS. KUO: Factually I think it should be 1992 because that's what\n\n18 I understood from the Witness's testimony. So I don't know whether the\n\n19 translation, which I heard, was somebody who misspoke 1997, or whether in\n\n20 fact Mr. Vasic did say 1997.\n\n21 JUDGE HUNT: Well, thank you for that.\n\n22 Mr. Vasic, which did you intend?\n\n23 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, in response to my\n\n24 learned friend's question during examination-in-chief, the Witness said\n\n25 that he made this list after his return to Bosnia, according to the\n\nPage 4621\n\n1 information. He got together with former detainees.\n\n2 Q. When did you make this list of people who were taken out from the\n\n3 KP Dom between the 25th of June and the 27th of August, and on the 31st of\n\n4 August?\n\n5 JUDGE HUNT: What I asked you was, did you say in 1997, and if you\n\n6 did say it, did you intend to say it? And are you disputing Ms. Kuo's\n\n7 suggestion that the witness had spoken about 1992?\n\n8 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] I said 1997, Your Honour.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: You see, earlier you said in answer to -- you asked a\n\n10 question, page 34, lines 5 and 6, \"When did you draw it up, in 1992 when\n\n11 you were released, or after your return in 1995?\" And the answer was, \"I\n\n12 draw up that list immediately after I got out of prison whilst I still had\n\n13 a fresh memory.\" That suggests he was accepting 1992 as his answer.\n\n14 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour, but we're talking\n\n15 about a list ID 299, the list of people who were taken out between the\n\n16 26th of June and 15th of July. I'm not asking him about list ID 301, a\n\n17 list of people who were taken out in August 1992, when that list was made.\n\n18 JUDGE HUNT: A different list.\n\n19 Well, Ms. Kuo, does that satisfied your query?\n\n20 MS. KUO: The -- I don't believe the witness ever said 1997, so\n\n21 that question --\n\n22 JUDGE HUNT: The first thing to do is to ascertain from the\n\n23 witness when the second list was drawn up. And then we should all be\n\n24 happy, I hope. Thank you.\n\n25 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honours.\n\nPage 4622\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4623\n\n1 Q. Sir, the list of people who were taken out in August 1992, when\n\n2 did you make it?\n\n3 A. I made that list several times. Among other things, it was\n\n4 mentioned in the statement to the Secretariat of the Interior of Konjic\n\n5 upon my return the first time, the second time at the investigator's in\n\n6 Sarajevo on two occasions, the third time when I was talking to the State\n\n7 Commission for Tracing Missing Persons. That was the fourth time.\n\n8 Q. Sir, I'm talking about the list presented to you by my learned\n\n9 friend which is number ID 301 which you read out at her request. When did\n\n10 you make this list?\n\n11 A. I made all those lists when I was giving my statements to\n\n12 investigators.\n\n13 Q. Which year was that?\n\n14 A. In 1997, one; and the other one at the Secretariat of the Interior\n\n15 in Konjic was in 1995. I don't remember about the third. One list I made\n\n16 at the state commission in 1996. I wouldn't be able to tell you about the\n\n17 sequence.\n\n18 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] With the help of the usher, I would\n\n19 like to show this witness list number ID 301, because I'm asking only\n\n20 about one of the lists.\n\n21 Q. Sir, is it true that it's your handwriting on this list?\n\n22 A. Yes. This is my handwriting exactly. This first group in the\n\n23 upper part.\n\n24 Q. You have explained that already.\n\n25 A. It relates to the departure of two groups on the 25th and the\n\nPage 4624\n\n1 27th. A group of about 36 to 40 people in total taken out in groups of 20\n\n2 on the 25th, and the 27th. And this third part relates to the group which\n\n3 got out together with me and was returned once to the prison, and then\n\n4 groups of ten were singled out, and out of those people, none has ever\n\n5 been heard from again. In total, that would be about 60 persons.\n\n6 Q. You said, sir, that this third list relates to intellectuals.\n\n7 A. Yes. And there are more of them, about 20.\n\n8 Q. You said this was your handwriting. In response to my learned\n\n9 friend's question, however, you said you dictated this list. How come you\n\n10 dictated something which is written in your own hand?\n\n11 A. I dictated at first, and then I made my own list in my own hand\n\n12 knowing that I would be coming here to testify.\n\n13 Q. Sir, can you please look at page 2 of this document, ID 301.\n\n14 That's the group which you say are intellectuals who were taken out. Can\n\n15 you tell me the profession of Mr. Avdo Kameric?\n\n16 A. Avdo Kameric is not in the group of intellectuals, but he's a\n\n17 highly skilled worker, craftsman.\n\n18 Q. What were the occupations of Pace, the father and son, that's\n\n19 second line from the top in document ID 301?\n\n20 A. No, no, no. This list here is not of intellectuals. This is a\n\n21 list of the people who were separated from us after we got back from\n\n22 Niksic to the KP Dom, except for Avdo Kameric and Fadil Divjan.\n\n23 This list here relates partly to intellectuals and partly to\n\n24 highly-skilled workers. I remember some more intellectuals which I could\n\n25 add to the list if you want me to.\n\nPage 4625\n\n1 Q. Sir, were you speaking about this list when you said to my learned\n\n2 friend that the people listed were intellectuals?\n\n3 A. There are some intellectuals, and I even failed to list all of\n\n4 them. I could add some more. I said so in response to the Prosecutor's\n\n5 question.\n\n6 Q. From this list, the name of Balic Dzemo, what was his occupation?\n\n7 You say here he was a trader.\n\n8 A. He was a trader, but I don't know that he is on the list of\n\n9 intellectuals.\n\n10 Q. Look at page 2 of document ID 301, the fourth line is Balic,\n\n11 Dzemo, a trader.\n\n12 A. He is a trader, but I don't know that all the intellectuals are\n\n13 listed here. Some names are missing. I don't know how this came about.\n\n14 I can now individually enumerate these individuals.\n\n15 Q. Is a person with the last name of Veiz also on the list, and a\n\n16 person under number six who is an employee of Maglic?\n\n17 A. He worked on repairs. He repaired the building of the KP Dom.\n\n18 Q. Can you explain, sir, why, when you were making this list, you\n\n19 failed to mention all the people which you now say you could enumerate?\n\n20 Was your memory in 1997 better than now in 2001 as far as events in the KP\n\n21 Dom are concerned? And you said you were doing this while your memory was\n\n22 still fresh so that you wouldn't forget.\n\n23 A. In 1992, I wasn't thinking about intellectuals. I never made this\n\n24 statement before 1996. I gave this statement subsequently while I was\n\n25 thinking why so many intellectuals were missing? Was it on purpose that\n\nPage 4626\n\n1 these people were killed, this very able workforce of young, educated\n\n2 people who went missing during the war years?\n\n3 Q. Sir, out of the eight people who are on the list, the people whom\n\n4 you call intellectuals, four are intellectuals and four are skilled\n\n5 workers. Do you still call this a list of intellectuals?\n\n6 A. No, I don't. I don't know really how this came about, this\n\n7 discrepancy between statements. I can now enumerate the intellectuals\n\n8 before Honourable Court and I cold even say where each of them is\n\n9 employed.\n\n10 Q. Thank you, sir. Today you mentioned that from the administrative\n\n11 building, machine-guns were pointed at the prisoners' quarters. Why did\n\n12 you fail to mention this in all the statements you made before, to the\n\n13 security station, to the Secretariat of the Interior, and the two\n\n14 statements you gave to the Office of the Prosecutor?\n\n15 A. When I was giving those statements, in all of them, I couldn't\n\n16 mention even a third of what had happened. A person isn't able to\n\n17 concentrate. He is under emotional pressure, in an emotional state, and\n\n18 it takes you over. And from the administrative building pointed towards\n\n19 the garages in the prisoners' building, I saw Brdjo on two occasions, a\n\n20 man I knew, and Kruno. They worked shifts. In the other part I just saw\n\n21 machine-guns; I couldn't see any faces.\n\n22 And a lot of time has gone by, and a person tends to remember some\n\n23 things and fails to remember other things. And from all the people who\n\n24 come here before the Tribunal, Honourable Court, you will see that all of\n\n25 them saw things differently.\n\nPage 4627\n\n1 The room where I was, was on the ground floor, and I couldn't see\n\n2 a lot of things that could be seen by other people who were on upper\n\n3 floors, people who were in rooms facing the town, people who had a view,\n\n4 and some of them could even see what was going on outside within the\n\n5 prison itself.\n\n6 Q. Sir, in response to my learned friend's question, you also said\n\n7 for the first time today that on two occasions when you saw Milorad\n\n8 Krnojelac in the KP Dom, you saw him carrying a pistol. You didn't\n\n9 mention that in any of the statements you gave before. Can you explain\n\n10 that?\n\n11 A. Nobody asked me whether he was armed or not.\n\n12 Q. I couldn't agree with you, sir, that nobody had asked you whether\n\n13 he had been armed or not. In your statement of 31 May 1999, given to the\n\n14 investigator of the Office of the Prosecutor, you stated, \"I don't know\n\n15 whether or not he had personal weapons.\"\n\n16 A. At that moment, I thought that what they meant was bigger weapons.\n\n17 I didn't think they meant personal weapons, smaller firearms, because a\n\n18 license is required for hunting rifles and things like that. I didn't\n\n19 think that licenses were needed for automatic weapons and personal\n\n20 weapons.\n\n21 Q. Sir, that's exactly what I was saying, that you were talking about\n\n22 personal weapons, not about automatic rifles, big rifles, things like\n\n23 that. You said that you were not aware of whether Milorad Krnojelac had\n\n24 personal weapons.\n\n25 A. You can say that he had nothing, but I was 30 or 50 metres away\n\nPage 4628\n\n1 from him. I saw a holster. Of course it was a pistol that he had. What\n\n2 else could he have had?\n\n3 Q. I'm going to read that part to you. That is document ID 298. The\n\n4 B/C/S version is 298A. In B/C/S it is page 4, paragraph 1; in the English\n\n5 version it is also page 4. In the paragraph where you speak about Milorad\n\n6 Krnojelac: \"Milorad Krnojelac was the warden, the camp warden, and before\n\n7 he took over this duty at the KP Dom, he was a mathematics teacher.\" And\n\n8 now the part that is of interest to us: \"A few times when I saw him, he\n\n9 wore a camouflage uniform. I don't know whether he wore -- he carried any\n\n10 personal weapons.\"\n\n11 Is this what you stated to the investigator?\n\n12 A. I don't know whether I mentioned personal weapons. I just know\n\n13 about the pistol, that he carried a pistol.\n\n14 Q. When you were giving this statement on the 31st of May, 1999, did\n\n15 the investigator from the OTP put a question to you that -- whether you\n\n16 saw Milorad Krnojelac at the KP Dom carrying any weapons?\n\n17 A. I don't know which weapons this related to. I don't know. I\n\n18 answered that I did not see that.\n\n19 Q. Thank you, sir. Today when my learned friend asked you whether\n\n20 you saw Mr. Krnojelac at the KP Dom, why did you say that he had a pistol,\n\n21 and she never even asked you about it?\n\n22 A. I saw what I saw, and I maintain that he had a pistol. I cannot\n\n23 confirm what kind of an assignment he had.\n\n24 Q. In response to my learned friend's question, you said today, sir,\n\n25 that a person had been wounded in the leg from the mines that were placed\n\nPage 4629\n\n1 around the KP Dom. Is that correct?\n\n2 A. That is correct. And it will probably be confirmed by some of the\n\n3 other persons that will be heard, or perhaps somebody has already\n\n4 confirmed it.\n\n5 Q. Sir, did you state to the investigator of the OTP, in your\n\n6 statement given on the 22nd of October 1997, that special -- that a\n\n7 special unit of the Serb army had placed mines on the lawns, but that no\n\n8 one was wounded or killed on account of these mines?\n\n9 A. None of our detainees, that's what I meant, because nobody tried\n\n10 to escape.\n\n11 Q. Thank you. My learned friend mentioned today the statement you\n\n12 gave to the State Security Centre in Konjic where you mentioned that\n\n13 Milorad Krnojelac was warden of the prison and Mitar Rasevic, commander of\n\n14 the prison. Is this the kind of statement you gave, because there were\n\n15 two parts of the prison, one part where there was a warden and another\n\n16 part where there was a commander?\n\n17 A. I never said that there were two prisons. In peacetime there was\n\n18 the Drina furniture factory, and also the part of the prison where\n\n19 convicts and the employees there worked. However, during war operations,\n\n20 I never mentioned that there were two prisons, or were there two prisons,\n\n21 for that matter.\n\n22 Q. Tell me, do you know whether the Drina unit worked while you were\n\n23 at the KP Dom?\n\n24 A. I don't know whether the unit Drina worked or not. In that\n\n25 economic unit Drina, there were some leftover materials, so craftsmen,\n\nPage 4630\n\n1 detainees, organised this work. They were finishing up what was there.\n\n2 Muratovic, Sacir, a tailor worked there; Fehim Isanovic, a carpenter\n\n3 worked there; and Soldo Ivan, who had worked in that unit before.\n\n4 I can't mention any other names, but I know that these persons\n\n5 worked there at that plant.\n\n6 Q. Do you know about the farm and the metalwork shop that they worked\n\n7 as well as the farm?\n\n8 A. I don't know about the metalwork shop, whether it worked. I just\n\n9 know that some of the locksmiths and drivers, car mechanics, electricians,\n\n10 there was this group of craftsmen. I don't know whether they were\n\n11 actually engaged in production or in repairs only. I don't know about\n\n12 that because I was not outside and I could not see.\n\n13 As for agriculture, the agricultural plant, it was separate. It\n\n14 was three or four kilometres away. Some detainees went up there to work,\n\n15 to cut grass, to dig, and also to tend to the maize and other crops that\n\n16 were sown there, but I was not up there and I could not see it.\n\n17 Q. Thank you, sir. Tell me, please, do you know that part of the\n\n18 fish from the fisheries in Jelec that you were talking about was\n\n19 transferred to Bukovica near Mjesaja?\n\n20 A. I'm not aware of that. Whether it was transferred or sold, I\n\n21 can't say.\n\n22 Q. Thank you, sir. Tell me, please, did the army take you out for\n\n23 the exchange when you went?\n\n24 A. No soldiers took us. The guards took us through the compound. We\n\n25 were searched at the administration building, and then they boarded us\n\nPage 4631\n\n1 onto a bus, and then we left, and then we stopped at Velecevo at\n\n2 headquarters. What was going on, I don't know.\n\n3 Q. Were you taken to the military command at Velecevo?\n\n4 A. We were at a plateau in front of that part where formerly there\n\n5 was the women's prison. The man who was with us went in there with those\n\n6 papers, took care of whatever. Nobody reported to us about anything. We\n\n7 didn't know what was going on.\n\n8 Q. Over there at Velecevo, were there persons in military uniforms?\n\n9 A. Yes.\n\n10 Q. Were there any military vehicles?\n\n11 A. Yes.\n\n12 Q. Thank you, sir. You said that in mid-June 1992, people were first\n\n13 taken out and beaten. Can you tell me on which date this started, if you\n\n14 can remember?\n\n15 A. I could not confirm the exact date.\n\n16 Q. Is that in the first half or second half of June 1992?\n\n17 A. From mid-June until perhaps the beginning of July, perhaps even\n\n18 up to mid-July. Because this did not happen every day. Sometimes two or\n\n19 three evenings would go by.\n\n20 Q. In response to my learned friend's question, you talked about the\n\n21 event concerning Dr. Aziz Torlak. Why did you not describe this event\n\n22 earlier on in your earlier statements? Did you not remember it, or is\n\n23 there some other reason for that?\n\n24 A. Aziz was not beaten up. He only had this small cut on his neck\n\n25 when he was asked to hand over his car keys. He did not make any comments\n\nPage 4632\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4633\n\n1 in the room. Since we had worked closely together before, he just showed\n\n2 this to me, and that was all.\n\n3 Q. There's the list that you made of persons who were taken out in\n\n4 groups from the 26th of June until the 15th of July, 1992. Can you tell\n\n5 me, for each and every one of them, on which date he was taken out, at\n\n6 what time, and from which room?\n\n7 A. I cannot mention any dates in relation to these men. I can only\n\n8 mention every person's name specifically. Sometimes it was three, four,\n\n9 or even five.\n\n10 Q. Did you see all of these people taken out personally, all of these\n\n11 people mentioned in this list?\n\n12 A. I could not have seen all these people because this was during the\n\n13 night. From my room, what did I see?\n\n14 Q. How many persons were taken out of your room?\n\n15 A. Seven, or perhaps eight. I can mention their names and surnames\n\n16 specifically.\n\n17 Q. I think that you already did this in response to my learned\n\n18 friend's questions during the examination-in-chief. Thank you.\n\n19 You mentioned that some of the detainees built isolation cells.\n\n20 Is that completely new isolation cells, and where were they?\n\n21 A. Yes, I said that. I found out about that from the people who\n\n22 were working on it. This was in a part of the building that faced the\n\n23 town, in the hall. They built cells.\n\n24 Q. Are you referring to the other wing of the building where\n\n25 detainees were?\n\nPage 4634\n\n1 A. Yes. The other wing that faced town, where detainees also were,\n\n2 because the building is F-shaped.\n\n3 Q. Thank you. A few minutes ago we mentioned Mr. Aziz Torlak. Can\n\n4 you tell me who Mr. Torlak's car, if you know?\n\n5 A. He didn't tell me that. I don't know.\n\n6 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] With the assistance of the usher, I\n\n7 would like to show the witness Exhibit 6/1 so that he could show us where\n\n8 these isolation cells were built.\n\n9 Just a minute, please. We need to use the ELMO so that we could\n\n10 all see. The usher will help you place this on the ELMO.\n\n11 Q. Could you please show us on the ELMO, not on the monitor screen,\n\n12 where these rooms were, the ones that you say were built.\n\n13 A. In building 2, in the hall. That's what I found out from the\n\n14 others. I could not see that, because I was in building number 1, and\n\n15 they were in building number 2. They were built in building number 2.\n\n16 Q. You cannot show us exactly?\n\n17 A. No, I cannot, and I am telling the truth only. I'm never going\n\n18 to say whatever is not true. I'm only saying what is absolutely true. So\n\n19 this was in building number 2.\n\n20 JUDGE HUNT: Both of you are failing to pause and you're causing\n\n21 great trouble for the interpreters. Please remember to pause before the\n\n22 question and before the answer.\n\n23 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] I do apologise, Your Honour. I just\n\n24 tried to warn the witness that he was supposed to pause. I didn't want to\n\n25 say anything else.\n\nPage 4635\n\n1 Thank you, sir. We won't be needing this floor plan any more, so\n\n2 could the usher please return Exhibit 6/1.\n\n3 Q. Sir, could you please tell me, when were these rooms built? Do\n\n4 you know?\n\n5 A. In June or July. Nusret Salcinovic, an electrician, put the\n\n6 electric installations in. Dedovic, Fehim, painted the premises. They\n\n7 were both in my room at the time and I found out about this from them.\n\n8 Q. Is that June and July 1992?\n\n9 A. Yes.\n\n10 Q. Thank you, sir. You talked about an automobile that had a faulty\n\n11 exhaust pipe that you heard during the nights when the beatings took\n\n12 place. Could this car be heard before the detainees were taken out, or\n\n13 were detainees first taken out and was the car heard only then?\n\n14 A. This car could be heard as they were coming and as they were\n\n15 going.\n\n16 Q. Thank you, sir. Can you tell me about this sound as the car was\n\n17 coming in? From which direction did it come?\n\n18 A. I cannot exactly say whether it was coming from the bridge or from\n\n19 town. At any rate, it was coming from up there.\n\n20 Q. Thank you. Do you know a person called Atif Jasarevic?\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. Did Atif Jasarevic tell you something about his conflict with Savo\n\n23 Todovic?\n\n24 A. No.\n\n25 Q. Do you know about whether Atif Jasarevic had a conflict with Savo\n\nPage 4636\n\n1 Todovic at all?\n\n2 A. No.\n\n3 Q. Sir, did you state to the investigator of the OTP on the 31st of\n\n4 May, 1999, \"I did not know Savo Todovic very well, only by name, and I\n\n5 cannot say anything about him. I know that Atif Jasarevic, who is now in\n\n6 the Ministry of Defence in Sarajevo, has direct knowledge of Savo Todovic\n\n7 because he had had a conflict with him.\"\n\n8 A. As for this statement, once I sat and talked with Asim [as\n\n9 interpreted] Jasarevic, and he told me that he had had a conflict with\n\n10 Savo. I did not know Savo well enough earlier. On that basis, I found\n\n11 out about that.\n\n12 Q. Thank you, sir. Tell me, you said that you heard gunshots. Can\n\n13 you tell us which day was this when you heard these five gunshots?\n\n14 A. I said earlier on that I cannot exactly state the date when the\n\n15 shooting was heard, and it was heard several times during the night.\n\n16 Q. Do you know who was taken out on that occasion, which ones out of\n\n17 the detainees?\n\n18 A. I said decidedly in my joint list which persons were taken out in\n\n19 various groups and in different intervals.\n\n20 Q. No. I would like you to tell me which persons were taken out on\n\n21 the day when you heard the gunshots. Do you know that?\n\n22 A. I cannot confirm the exact date, but as for these gunshots, I know\n\n23 about two of them who were taken away from dinner, and it lasted a long\n\n24 time. That was Nurko Nisic, and Halim Konjo.\n\n25 As for the other rooms, I did not know who was taken out. Since\n\nPage 4637\n\n1 Nurko and Halim were in my room, I was terrified as to what would happen,\n\n2 and I waited for a long time until the late hours 9.00 or 10.00 perhaps.\n\n3 Moans and screams could be heard. And I heard someone shouting in a loud\n\n4 voice twice, \"Nurko, Nurko.\" Then everything went quiet again, and then\n\n5 after that screaming and yelling and moaning started yet again. And then\n\n6 again everything went quiet. And then I heard four billets fired from a\n\n7 pistol. I heard that because I was standing right by a window and I was\n\n8 worried about what would happen next, and then I heard tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk.\n\n9 After a while, the sound of the car that was leaving. That is\n\n10 what I can claim. Not only then, it also happened before that and it also\n\n11 happened after that, but I remember this because that was the day when\n\n12 they were taken away from dinner. Obrenovic, nicknamed Obren, told the\n\n13 two of them to report at the exit. \"Report at the exit,\" those were the\n\n14 words that he used.\n\n15 Q. What time was it when the heard the gunshots?\n\n16 A. Perhaps it was 12.00, 1.00. I don't know. We didn't dare turn on\n\n17 the lights, and I could not look at my watch.\n\n18 Q. Can you tell us from which room the moanings and screams could be\n\n19 heard?\n\n20 A. From the administration building, from down there. That's where\n\n21 they were heard from.\n\n22 Q. Does that mean it was coming from the hall at the entrance into\n\n23 the compound of the KP Dom?\n\n24 A. Yes. You could hear it from there. You could not say whether it\n\n25 was from this window or from that window, but sounds resound during the\n\nPage 4638\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4639\n\n1 night. They reverberate all over.\n\n2 Q. From which position did you hear the gunshots?\n\n3 A. From the same building. Whether it was from the building outwards\n\n4 or it was inside the building, I cannot know that.\n\n5 Q. So according to you, they could have come from the building or\n\n6 they could have come from outside, from within the KP Dom?\n\n7 A. I was inside the building. I wasn't close enough to be able to\n\n8 tell you where within 20 metres it came from.\n\n9 Q. Today in response to another question of mine you said that when\n\n10 you heard the gun shots, you were close to the window because you were\n\n11 concerned about the fate of the people who had been taken out from your\n\n12 room; is that correct?\n\n13 A. Yes. I was very worried, very worried indeed about what was going\n\n14 on with them and what would happen to all of us.\n\n15 Q. Did you say to the investigators of the OTP on the 31st of May,\n\n16 1999, the following: \"I remember one night about 1.00 a.m. I was awake\n\n17 and I was thinking about my family, when after a beating, silence\n\n18 followed, and then suddenly five single gunshots were fired.\" Is it true\n\n19 what you said to the investigators of the OTP, or what you have just said\n\n20 today, that you were standing by the window worried, or is the other\n\n21 version true, that you were thinking about your family?\n\n22 A. I was worried about my family, and if I heard the gunshots, I\n\n23 became even more worried. What I stated is true.\n\n24 Q. Sir, thank you very much.\n\n25 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, the Defence has no more\n\nPage 4640\n\n1 questions.\n\n2 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you. Ms. Kuo.\n\n3 MS. KUO: Just very briefly, Your Honour.\n\n4 Re-examined by Ms. Kuo:\n\n5 Q. Witness, you were asked by Defence counsel about the presence of\n\n6 Muslim military forces at KP Dom. Did you ever see Serb military forces\n\n7 at the KP Dom, and if so, when?\n\n8 A. I cannot hear the translation.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: What channel -- you had better check the channel he's\n\n10 on.\n\n11 THE USHER: Channel 7.\n\n12 A. I can hear now, yes, I can hear now.\n\n13 JUDGE HUNT: Try again, Ms. Kuo, and see whether it's something at\n\n14 your end. Your microphone is not on at the moment.\n\n15 MS. KUO: Yes, Your Honour.\n\n16 Q. Witness, did you ever see any Serb military forces at the KP Dom,\n\n17 and if so, when?\n\n18 A. I saw Serb military forces on two occasions. I saw soldiers on\n\n19 one occasion who had discarded their weapons. That was after Ustikolina\n\n20 was taken. They had taken off their belts. On another occasion I saw\n\n21 soldiers when they were laying mines within the compound, and I mentioned\n\n22 that in my previous testimony.\n\n23 Q. When you first arrived at the KP Dom on the 24th of April, was --\n\n24 were there Serb military forces present at the KP Dom?\n\n25 A. When I arrived, that was on the 25th of April. I arrived around\n\nPage 4641\n\n1 5.00 or 6.00 at the gate. I was met by guards, the employees of the\n\n2 prison. There was Slavko Koroman whom I knew, and there was a Milic and\n\n3 another one.\n\n4 Q. Witness, my only question refers to the military, not about the\n\n5 guards. Were there Serb military forces at the KP Dom when you arrived?\n\n6 A. I didn't notice any.\n\n7 MS. KUO: Your Honours, those are the questions I have, but I do\n\n8 have two things I'd like to clarify with regard to when Defence counsel\n\n9 was allegedly quoting from statements. I just wanted to make sure we had\n\n10 on the record the correct quotations, and it really doesn't have much to\n\n11 do with the witness but more to do with the documents. Perhaps we can get\n\n12 Defence counsel to agree that that's what it states so then the Court can\n\n13 take that into consideration.\n\n14 JUDGE HUNT: This is additional material you want added to what\n\n15 was quoted to the witness?\n\n16 MS. KUO: Well, for instance, when Mr. Vasic was cross-examining\n\n17 the witness about the possession of the pistol, he read a certain portion\n\n18 out which, as you know the way statements here are done, was translated\n\n19 into B/C/S and then in the courtroom was translated back into English. I\n\n20 wanted to put on the record that the statement in the English original\n\n21 was, \"I do not know if he was carrying a sidearm or not,\" just so the\n\n22 Court has that word which is somewhat ambiguous.\n\n23 JUDGE HUNT: That would be permissible and we can follow the\n\n24 process that we did with the last witness or the witness before, where\n\n25 each party can ask the other party to agree that that's in the statement.\n\nPage 4642\n\n1 So you ask Mr. Vasic or Mr. Bakrac, whichever is willing to do with the\n\n2 matter, whether that is so in the English version. It may, of course, be\n\n3 necessary to look at how that was translated into B/C/S.\n\n4 MS. KUO: Yes, of course.\n\n5 JUDGE HUNT: In the one which counsel for the Defence have.\n\n6 MS. KUO: The document I'm referring to is ID 298. It's the\n\n7 English interview with the witness dated 31 May 1999. It's on page 3,\n\n8 paragraph 3, last sentence.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: We should keep the witness here just in case\n\n10 something has to be cleared up.\n\n11 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour. I believe that is\n\n12 how I asked my question of the witness. It is true that he said he was\n\n13 not carrying a personal weapon or a sidearm or not. I don't see the\n\n14 difference, but it's true that it says so in his statement.\n\n15 JUDGE HUNT: This is not a particular criticism of your question,\n\n16 Mr. Vasic, it's just ensuring that we have all of the records of that\n\n17 particular conversation.\n\n18 Yes, Ms. Kuo, what's the next one?\n\n19 MS. KUO: The other relates to the role of Mr. Rasevic, and the --\n\n20 I believe I read the quotation out the first time that Mr. Rasevic was\n\n21 performing the duties of the commander, and the witness explained what he\n\n22 meant by that. When it was quoted back by Mr. Vasic, he claimed that the\n\n23 witness said that Mr. Rasevic was the commander, and I want it to be clear\n\n24 that the direct quotation was that he was performing the duties.\n\n25 JUDGE HUNT: When you say the direct quotation, you mean from a\n\nPage 4643\n\n1 particular document?\n\n2 MS. KUO: Yes, that's ID 304.\n\n3 JUDGE HUNT: Paragraph or page?\n\n4 MS. KUO: In the English it's page 3 at the very bottom. The very\n\n5 last two lanes say, \"The prison warden was Milorad Krnojelac.\" And then\n\n6 the sentence which begins at the very end of that page says, \"The duties\n\n7 of prison commander were performed by Mitar Rasevic who was permanently\n\n8 employed at the KP Dom.\"\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: Is that agreed, Mr. Vasic?\n\n10 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour.\n\n11 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you. Are those the only matters?\n\n12 MS. KUO: That's all, Your Honour.\n\n13 JUDGE HUNT: Well, thank you, sir, for giving evidence. You are\n\n14 now free to leave.\n\n15 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I would like to thank this\n\n16 Honourable Court for their patience.\n\n17 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you.\n\n18 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You must understand my excitement\n\n19 and my emotion, and perhaps not everything ran so smoothly as I would have\n\n20 wanted it to. Perhaps some corrections are needed regarding the\n\n21 Prosecutor and the interpreters because the Defence counsel asked many\n\n22 questions about discrepancies in statements. That's all I wanted to say.\n\n23 Thank you.\n\n24 JUDGE HUNT: You should understand, sir, that we have listened to\n\n25 very many witnesses giving evidence in this trial. Many of them have the\n\nPage 4644\n\n1 same problems as you have had. We do understand the emotions with which\n\n2 each of you give your evidence here. If we have attempted at times to\n\n3 confine your evidence, it's because we have a lot of other evidence in the\n\n4 case and we do not want too much repetition. But we are very grateful to\n\n5 you for having coming here and for having given your evidence. Thank you.\n\n6 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] If you may say one more thing with\n\n7 your leave.\n\n8 JUDGE HUNT: Yes.\n\n9 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] May I?\n\n10 JUDGE HUNT: Yes.\n\n11 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] If anyone would entrust six sheep to\n\n12 a shepherd for keeping and two-thirds went missing, that shepherd would\n\n13 go on trial. That's all I meant to say. And we're talking about people\n\n14 here.\n\n15 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you very much.\n\n16 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you, too.\n\n17 [The witness withdrew]\n\n18 JUDGE HUNT: Now, I understand, Mr. Bakrac, you want to revisit an\n\n19 issue which has been discussed on many occasions about the time the\n\n20 Defence should have for the preparation of its Defence case. What is it\n\n21 you want to add?\n\n22 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I apologise in advance.\n\n23 I don't want to shift the responsibility onto someone else, but in my\n\n24 conversations with other judges [as interpreted], it has been suggested to\n\n25 me to raise this issue; namely, we expected that on the 12th when this\n\nPage 4645\n\n1 last part of the Prosecutor's witnesses started, that it would last two\n\n2 weeks, and that is how we planned our work on the ground. However, it has\n\n3 stretched into the third week, and there are still two witnesses left, and\n\n4 that it is uncertain whether we would finish with them by the end of the\n\n5 week. Perhaps we would need a fourth week.\n\n6 We had discussed and we had agreed - in fact, we have received\n\n7 permission from you - to have two weeks before beginning our Defence.\n\n8 However, there is the Easter, both the Catholic and the Orthodox one,\n\n9 we'll have one Monday off and perhaps the Tuesday as well; we would have\n\n10 to have a Pre-Defence Conference also, so that Defence is left not with\n\n11 two whole weeks but practically only one week to prepare their Defence.\n\n12 That is why I would like to ask you to make our schedule in such a way so\n\n13 that the Defence is allowed, taking account of the holidays, two whole\n\n14 weeks.\n\n15 And we would like this Pre-Defence Conference to be on the 23rd of\n\n16 April. Unless we do that, since Monday and Tuesday are days off on the\n\n17 ground and we have to travel here, we would be left with only one week's\n\n18 time to do all the preparations.\n\n19 JUDGE HUNT: I'm not sure that I follow the logic of the fact that\n\n20 you have extra time that you have less time, but let's get the progress\n\n21 sorted out.\n\n22 Before we do that, I should ask you, is the Orthodox Easter the\n\n23 same as the Christian one, the Catholic one?\n\n24 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] This year, yes.\n\n25 JUDGE HUNT: So that the weekend commencing Friday the 13th is\n\nPage 4646\n\n1 your Easter. There is, of course, a Plenary meeting of Judges on the 12th\n\n2 which takes that day out, anyway.\n\n3 Let's hear from the Prosecution when they believe they will be\n\n4 finishing their case.\n\n5 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, in the next week we will have\n\n6 the Witness 210 on Monday, and as it is a very important witness for both\n\n7 sides, I think, it will take at least one and a half day for both, that\n\n8 is, case in chief and cross-examination. And for the Witness 250 who\n\n9 would then start on Tuesday, we have at the moment actually no real idea\n\n10 how long it will take because we have never seen that witness before, but\n\n11 I estimate about a day, too.\n\n12 That means we will end -- we will rest our case on the 4th, during\n\n13 the 4th, that is, the Wednesday next week.\n\n14 JUDGE HUNT: Yes. Now, we did say that the Defence could have the\n\n15 rest of that week without counting it. There is -- which means the\n\n16 Thursday and the Friday. The following week, taking a day off for\n\n17 Easter, there are four days, and then the following week taking the Monday\n\n18 off for Easter, there are four days. That would be taking it three to\n\n19 Friday the 20th of April.\n\n20 Well, then, Mr. Bakrac, if we have the Pre-Trial Conference on the\n\n21 Monday, the 23rd, are you ready then to start on the 24th, or are you\n\n22 suggesting an even later start than that?\n\n23 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I thought, if\n\n24 possible -- well, since you ask me, I will take the liberty of saying that\n\n25 it would be convenient for the Defence for the Pre-Trial Conference to be\n\nPage 4647\n\n1 on the Thursday 26th, and for the Defence case to start on the Monday of\n\n2 the 30th of April, or perhaps Tuesday. I don't know if we work on the\n\n3 Monday the 30th. The Defence has to go to the field, and if we hold the\n\n4 Pre-Trial Conference on Monday, which means that we would have to come\n\n5 here on the Thursday or Friday the previous week, with these holidays it\n\n6 means that we would have only just six working days in the field, two plus\n\n7 four. I apologise, but if we hold this Pre-Trial Conference on Monday, we\n\n8 have to arrive before the weekend the previous week, so that means that we\n\n9 would have only one working day left in that week on the ground.\n\n10 JUDGE HUNT: Monday the 30th of April, that's the Queen's birthday\n\n11 here in the Netherlands which is, I think, a holiday. But we don't get\n\n12 labour day the next day. I see.\n\n13 Well, what is the Prosecution's attitude to the application?\n\n14 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The Prosecution has no objections.\n\n15 JUDGE HUNT: Just one moment.\n\n16 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n17 JUDGE HUNT: Mr. Bakrac, the Trial Chamber believes that it's fair\n\n18 enough for you, bearing in mind that there are so many holidays during\n\n19 your time off. We'll start the Defence case on the 1st of May, that's the\n\n20 Tuesday. And is the Pre-Trial Conference better for you on the Thursday\n\n21 or the Friday? The Thursday, I suppose, would be better in case something\n\n22 has to be done.\n\n23 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour. And thank you very\n\n24 much for your understanding and for granting this request of the Defence.\n\n25 Thursday is perhaps more convenient if we need to get some more work done\n\nPage 4648\n\n1 on Friday.\n\n2 JUDGE HUNT: So that makes the Pre-Defence Conference on Thursday,\n\n3 the 26th of April, and opening on the 1st of May.\n\n4 I just think I better consult the rules. I know you don't have to\n\n5 file any more pre-trial briefs, but does the alteration to that rule\n\n6 require you to put anything else in.\n\n7 I suppose I should ask you, Mr. Bakrac, is it intended in any way\n\n8 to amend your pre-trial brief, the one that's already been filed?\n\n9 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] No, Your Honour, there will be no\n\n10 major changes. In fact, there will be no changes at all. Perhaps in our\n\n11 opening statement, but nothing more than that.\n\n12 JUDGE HUNT: Well, we have to have something to discuss at the\n\n13 Pre- Defence Conference, so if there is anything that you think that\n\n14 should be raised, would you please give us fair notice of it and so the\n\n15 Prosecution can consider the matter. It will certainly save time on that\n\n16 Thursday.\n\n17 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n18 JUDGE HUNT: Two things. What about the photographs, have they\n\n19 been given to the Prosecution?\n\n20 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour, they have been\n\n21 given, but I must be very honest and apologise because we don't have the\n\n22 entire documentation translated as yet, and we haven't put identification\n\n23 numbers on them. Those are photographs without ID numbers, and I\n\n24 apologise for this part. However, the Prosecution has had a look at\n\n25 original photographs, and they have the photo documentation arranged in\n\nPage 4649\n\n1 the same way as theirs [as interpreted] is organised.\n\n2 JUDGE HUNT: Well, then, is it necessary for the Prosecution to\n\n3 recall any of its witnesses to deal with what can be seen out of the\n\n4 various windows? I don't want it do in reply if we can avoid it.\n\n5 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes, but at the moment I do not actually see\n\n6 any discrepancies. I cannot say that now for sure.\n\n7 JUDGE HUNT: Until you get the translation.\n\n8 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: And also, just another point, we have not yet\n\n9 got any witness list from Defence counsel, and we have actually not gotten\n\n10 any names or statements of the Defence witnesses, and there should also be\n\n11 a deadline for doing this. So we at the moment cannot prepare at all for\n\n12 the Defence case.\n\n13 JUDGE HUNT: Yes, you're entitled to that before the commencement\n\n14 of the Defence case. That's as far as the rules seem to take it still.\n\n15 When do you propose to give us the documents that are required\n\n16 under Rule 65 ter (G), that is, the list of the witnesses you intend to\n\n17 call, the name or pseudonym, the summary of the facts to be testified by\n\n18 the witness, identifying the points in the indictment as to which each\n\n19 witness will testify, and the estimated length of time required for each\n\n20 witness, and a list of exhibits that you intend to offer in your case?\n\n21 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, the Defence has witness\n\n22 statements. They are being translated. I think that will be finished by\n\n23 the end of this week. Immediately upon our arrival in Yugoslavia, we\n\n24 will make a list of witnesses, a list of exhibits, and we will forward\n\n25 that to the office of the Prosecutor, and by all means, we will have\n\nPage 4650\n\n1 copies ready for the both the Trial Chamber and the Office of the\n\n2 Prosecutor before the beginning of the Pre-Trial Conference.\n\n3 JUDGE HUNT: Oh, yes, but some time in advance of the Pre-Trial\n\n4 Conference, if possible. If we are going to have that conference on the\n\n5 Thursday, then I suggest we should have these documents required by Rule\n\n6 65 ter (G) by at least the Monday or the Tuesday of that week. They can\n\n7 be sent by fax. You don't have to be here to file them, but we do need\n\n8 them so that we know what it is we're going to discuss at the Pre-Defence\n\n9 Conference. That will give you about three weeks to get them prepared.\n\n10 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, it may be my mistake.\n\n11 Maybe I wasn't precise enough. I said that in the first week upon our\n\n12 arrival in Yugoslavia, the Defence will prepare and send all of these\n\n13 things, and I added that it will be before the Pre-Defence Conference.\n\n14 But of course, I meant we will have this entire documentation completed\n\n15 and delivered by the end of the first week after the end of the\n\n16 Prosecution case.\n\n17 JUDGE HUNT: Well, that should be sufficient. That should be more\n\n18 than sufficient, and we'll grateful to you for that, Mr. Bakrac. Is there\n\n19 anything else we can deal with here, or we start the next witness at 2.30?\n\n20 Very well, then. Thank you. We'll adjourn now until 2.30.\n\n21 I'm sorry, there was one other thing, and that's the medical\n\n22 examination of the accused. Have we got any documents for that yet?\n\n23 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The expert of the Prosecution has not\n\n24 received yet any information from the Defence expert. That is at least my\n\n25 information that I got last week. It may be different now.\n\nPage 4651\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4652\n\n1 JUDGE HUNT: Perhaps you could discuss it over lunch hour.\n\n2 --- Luncheon recess taken at it 1.02 p.m.\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 4653\n\n1 [The witness entered court]\n\n2 --- On resuming at 2.30 p.m.\n\n3 JUDGE HUNT: Ms. Kuo. This is your next witness, is it?\n\n4 MS. KUO: Yes, the witness needs to have his headphones on, and\n\n5 also he needs to make the solemn declaration.\n\n6 JUDGE HUNT: Yes. Would you stand up, please, sir, and will you\n\n7 make the solemn declaration in the terms of the document that's being\n\n8 shown to you.\n\n9 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak\n\n10 the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\n11 JUDGE HUNT: There are no microphones on.

Sir, would you please pull your chair up\n\n25 closer to the microphone so we can all hear you. Thank you.\n\nPage 4654\n\n1 Before you is a piece of paper. Could you please take a look at\n\n2 the paper? That has been identified and entered in evidence as Exhibit\n\n3 P442. On it is FWS-89. Underneath that, is that your name?\n\n4 A. Yes.\n\n5 Q. Underneath your name, is that your date of birth?\n\n6 A. Yes.\n\n7 Q. Thank you, sir. Throughout the trial we will not refer to you by\n\n8 name, but use this number.\n\n9 Now, sir, in 1992, can you tell us where you lived, what town and\n\n10 what neighbourhood?\n\n11 A. I lived in the town of Foca in the [redacted]\n\n12 [phoen].\n\n13 THE INTERPRETER: Interpret's note, could the witness please come\n\n14 closer to the microphone.\n\n15 JUDGE HUNT: Sir, the interpreters are having a great deal of\n\n16 difficulty hearing you. Could you move your chair up, and the usher,\n\n17 would you please move the microphones closer to the witness.\n\n18 MS. KUO: The microphones could be moved closer to the witness so\n\n19 he doesn't have to lean so far. Thank you.\n\n20 THE WITNESS: Thank you.\n\n21 MS. KUO:\n\n22 Q. Witness, in 1992, what kind of work were you doing?\n\n23 A. I worked at the [redacted] factory in [redacted]. I worked as a\n\n24 [redacted].\n\n25 Q.
