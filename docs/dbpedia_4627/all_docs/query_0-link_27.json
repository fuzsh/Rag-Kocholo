        "text": "Mineral Composition of Selected Serbian Propolis Samples\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTosic Snezana\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this work was to determine the content of 22 macro- and microelements in ten raw Serbian propolis samples which differ in geographical and botanical origin as well as in polluted agent contents by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES. The macroelements were more common and present Ca content was the highest while Na content the lowest. Among the studied essential trace elements Fe was the most common element. The levels of toxic elements (Pb, Cd, As and Hg were also analyzed, since they were possible environmental contaminants that could be transferred into propolis products for human consumption. As and Hg were not detected in any of the analyzed samples but a high level of Pb (2.0-9.7 mg/kg was detected and only selected portions of raw propolis could be used to produce natural medicines and dietary supplements for humans. Obtained results were statistically analyzed, and the examined samples showed a wide range of element content.\n\nSerbian lexicography today\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGortan-Premk Darinka S.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available There are three urgent tasks before the Serbian lexicographers: the vertical and horizontal defining of the contemporary Serbian language, the formation of the Serbian language corpus and the compilation of the standard descriptive dictionary: the first two tasks should be done by the Serbian linguists and by those dealing with corpora, whereas the third should be trusted to the Serbian lexicographers, both the present and the future ones. The Serbian lexicographers, the members of the Belgrade school of lexicography, who have compiled 20 volumes of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences Dictionary, six-volume Matica Srpska Dictionary, and single-volume Matica Srpska Dictionary, and outstanding Belgrade lexicologists will doubtless create a modern and reliable conception of such a dictionary, make precise working instructions based on contemporary linguistic and lexicological knowledge if the project is supported by the government. Hopefully, this extremely significant national undertaking will be completed in a few years.\n\nSerbian schools and teaching of Serbian language in Greece in the 20th century\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBlagojeviÄ Gordana\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The topic of this work is Serbian schools and the teaching of Serbian language in Greece in the 20th century. During the first half of the 20th century the existence of Serbian people in Turkey (later in Greece was acknowledged through school and church. Thanks to the Serbian schools, Serbs as an invisible minority became a visible one. In the second half of the 20th century there is primarily a teaching of Serbian language as a foreign language. During this period, Serbian was accepted primarily by Greeks at courses and private classes. At the beginning of the nineties in the 20th century because of the war in the territory of Yugoslavia, a large number of refugees went to Greece. Teaching of Serbian as a native language was organized only ten years later (at the beginning of 21st century. In some places, the schools are located in consular sections and have the assistance of the country of origin (Thessalonica, Katerini while in Hani (Crete immigrants organized them-selves without the assistance from the country of origin. By studying Serbian schools and the teaching of Serbian language, this work considers relation towards language as a symbol of ethnic identity - at the individual level, at the level of receiving country and at the level of country of origin.\n\nICT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: CONDITION AND IMPROVEMENT BY QMS - SERBIAN CASE STUDY\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMiladin StefanoviÄ\n\n2007-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper evaluates the level of Information and Communication Technology (ICT in the Serbian metal processing sector. This research uses data from the entire metal processing sector in Serbia (Sample: 20 large companies, 27 medium companies, and 247 small companies, overall with 33,057 workers. Data from the Serbian metal processing sector were compared to the relevant data from EU. In this paper, we present problems and steps for improvement of ICT in the Serbian metal processing industry. We will also present development of quality infrastructure necessary for support and improvement of Serbian ICT industry and improvement of ITC sectors in Serbian metal processing industry.\n\nSerbian language acquisition in communist Romania\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSorescu-MarinkoviÄ Annemarie\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper analyzes a unique linguistic phenomenon characterizing Romaniaâs western border areas for almost a decade, in the 1980s: the acquisition of the Serbian language by Romanians in TimiÅoara under the communist regime, primarily through exposure to Yugoslav television programmes. It gives a necessarily sketchy overview of private life under communism, notably the situation in the Banat province, whose privileged position as a result of being closest to the West both geographically and culturally was reflected in the acceptance of pluralism and a critical attitude towards authoritarianism. Taking into account the literature on foreign language acquisition through exposure to television programmes, the study is based on a research involving Romanian natives of TimiÅoara who, although lacking any formal instruction in Serbian, intensively and regularly watched Yugoslav television programmes in the period in question, and on evaluating their competence and proficiency in Serbian, through language tests, narrative interviews in Romanian and free conversations in Serbian. The conclusion is that most respondents, despite the varying degree of proficiency in Serbian depending on their active use of the language before and after 1989, showed a strong pragmatic competence, which appears to contradict the authorâs initial hypothesis.\n\nAchievement of Serbian eighth grade students in science\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAntonijeviÄ Radovan\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper considers the main results and some educational implications of the TIMSS 2003 assessment conducted in Serbia in the fields of the science achievement of Serbian eighth grade students and the science curriculum context of their achievement. There were 4264 students in the sample. It was confirmed that Serbian eighth graders had made average scale score of 468 points in the science, and with this achievement they are placed in the zone of the top of low international benchmarking level, very close to the point of intermediate benchmark. The average science achievement of the Serbian eighth graders is somewhat below the general international science achievement. The best results were achieved in the science content domain of \"chemistry\", and the lower results in the content domain of \"environmental science\". Across the defined science cognitive domains, it was confirmed that the Serbian students had achieved the best results in cognitive domain of \"factual knowledge\" and weaker results in \"reasoning and analysis\". The achieved results raise many questions about contents of the science curriculum in Serbia, its overall quality and basic characteristics of its implementation. These results can be eligibly used to improve the science curricula and teaching in Serbian primary school. .\n\nThe external sector of the Serbian economy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRistanoviÄ Vladimir\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this paper is to show the external sector of the Serbian economy, its features and peculiarities, as well as anomalies that afflicted it for years. In the analysis, data acquired from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia will be used, as well as the official international methodology. The text will include the analysis of the structure of the external sector, market share, competitive position of Serbian economy and export products according to sectors of the economy and factor intensity. Since 2000, the structure of production and exports of the Serbian economy shows low comparative advantages and competitive position throughout the world. Unfavorable structure of the sectors, departments and the product groups affected the deepening of external imbalances and high foreign trade deficit. Exports of technology of predominantly low intensity, resources, and labor-intensive products, common for Serbian economy, represent no guarantee of economic growth in the long term. The causes of external imbalances should be sought in the absence of adequate export strategy, as well as in high speed of liberalization of foreign trade flows and exchange rate policy.\n\nOrigin of differences between Serbian and Roma children in social intelligence test's achievement\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÄigiÄ Gordana\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The goal of the presented research is to identify the origin of differences between Serbian (N=166 and Roma children (N=169 of primary school age in achievement on Modified Rosenzweig Test, used as a measure of social intelligence (Roma children had lower results than Serbian children. Results show that these differences can be partly explained with extreme inviolable socio-economic and cultural status of Roma children. Social intelligence test's scores are significantly correlated with socio-economic and cultural status; this correlation is more apparent in Roma than in Serbian sample. Differences between Serbian and Roma children become less apparent when we control the influence of socio-economic and cultural status. Parent's educational level is recognized as the most important indicator of socio-economic and cultural status. Another way to identify the origin of differences was directed to investigation of adequacy of used test as a measure of social intelligence of Roma children. Our assumption that some items make whole test unfair for Roma children is not confirmed. However, results concerning the relation between experience with particular social situations and success in particular test items, and results concerning the different structures of implicite understanding of social intelligence by Serbian and Roma parents, point out that test key favors responses that Serbian people accept as optimal in task situation, while the responses according to Roma implicite understanding of social intelligence are less valued.\n\nMonitoring process hygiene in Serbian retail establishments\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVeskoviÄ MoraÄanin, S.; BaltiÄ, T.; MilojeviÄ, L.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe present study was conducted to estimate the effectiveness of sanitary procedures on food contact surfaces and food handlersâ hands in Serbian retail establishments. For that purpose, a total of 970 samples from food contact surfaces and 525 samples from workersâ hands were microbiologically analyzed. Results of total aerobic plate count and total Enterobacteriaceae count showed that the implemented washing and disinfection procedures, as a part of HACCP plans, were not effective enough in most retail facilities. Constant and intensive education of employees on proper implementation of sanitation procedures are needed in order to ensure food safety in the retail market.\n\nExternal relationships and marketing practices in Serbian firms: The intangible capital perspective\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMitiÄ Sanja\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents selected results of research on intangible capital in Serbian firms. The results are part of a broader research project, based on a survey of a sample of Serbian firms. The focus of the project is the various forms of intangible capital, and in this paper we analyse whether and to what degree firms build up their brand capital and increase marketing competencies, and what kind of external relationships they experience. The results provide the first insight into the development of the marketing resources of Serbian firms and show that this element of intangibles is gradually improving but still is at a low level. We find significant differences in the use of marketing resources between firms in regard to their size, international market experience, and ownership type. A more significant development of brand capital, external relationships, and marketing innovations and competencies is found in larger firms, firms with considerable international business experience compared to firms primarily oriented to the domestic market, and in foreign-owned firms. After identifying the strengths and weaknesses of marketing practices in Serbian enterprises we suggest some measures for overcoming the analyzed constraints in order to improve firmsâ market positioning, especially in foreign markets.[Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 179062\n\nPsychometric properties of the Serbian version of the Empathy Quotient (S-EQ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDimitrijeviÄ Aleksandar\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In the present study we examined psychometric properties of the Serbian translation of the Empathy Quotient scale (S-EQ. The translated version of the EQ was applied on a sample of 694 high-school students. A sub-sample consisting of 375 high-school students also completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI, another widely used empathy measure. The following statistical analyses were applied: internal consistency analysis, explanatory (EFA and confirmatory (CFA factor analyses, and factor congruence analysis. Correlation with IRI and gender differences were calculated to demonstrate validity of the instrument. Results show that the Serbian 40-item version of EQ has lower reliability (Cronbachâs alpha = .782 than the original. The originally proposed one factor structure of the instrument was not confirmed. The short version with 28 items showed better reliablity (alpha= .807. The three-factor solution (cognitive empathy, emotional reactivity, and social skills showed good cross-sample stability (Tucker congruence coefficient over .8 but the results of CFA confirmed the solution proposed in the reviewed literature only partially. The mean scores are similar to those obtained in the other studies, and, as expected, women have significantly higher scores than men. Correlations with all subscales of IRI are statistically significant for the first two subscales of EQ, but not for the âsocial skills.â We concluded that the Serbian version of the âEmpathy Quotientâ is a useful research tool which can contribute to cross-cultural studies of empathy, although its psychometric characteristics are not as good as those obtained in the original study. We also suggest that a 28-item should be used preferably to the original 40-item version. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 179018: Identification, measurement and development of cognitive and emotional competences important for a society oriented to European integrations\n\nMathematics achievement of Serbian eighth grade students and characteristics of mathematics curriculum\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAntonijeviÄ Radovan M.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper considers the main results and some educational implications of the TIMSS 2003 assessment conducted in Serbia, in the fields of mathematics achievement of Serbian eighth grade students and the mathematics curriculum context of their achievement. It was confirmed that Serbian eighth graders have made average scale score of 477 points, and with this achievement they are placed in the zone of intermediate international benchmarking level. The average mathematics achievement of the Serbian eighth graders is somewhat above the average international mathematics achievement. The best result was achieved in the content domain of \"algebra\", and the lower result in the content domains of \"measurement\" and \"data\". In the defined cognitive domains the Serbian students have achieved the best results in \"solving routine problems\" and \"knowing facts and procedures\", and the weaker result in \"reasoning\". Statistically significant difference was found in the mathematics achievement between girls and boys in the Serbian TIMSS 2003 sample, so the girlsâ average scale score was 480 points and the same value for the boys was 473 points. The achieved results raise many questions about the contents of mathematics curriculum in Serbia, its quality and basic characteristics of its implementation. These results can be eligibly used to improve the mathematics curriculum and teaching in Serbian primary school.\n\nDeoxynivalenol occurrence in Serbian maize under different weather conditions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJajiÄ Igor M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this paper was to investigate deoxynivalenol (DON occurrence in maize samples originating from two harvest seasons in Serbia. The key differences between harvest seasons were weather conditions, specifically the humidity. The samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography with DAD detection, after clean-up on SPE columns. In samples from 2014, DON was found in 82 (100.0% samples with the average content of 2.517 mg/kg (ranged from 0.368 to 11.343 mg/kg. Two samples exceeded maximum level permitted by EU regulations. However, analyzing larger number of samples (163 from 2015 harvest season, DON was present in 51 (31.3% samples in significantly lower concentrations (average of 0.662 mg/kg, ranged from 0.106 to 2.628 mg/kg. None of the samples from 2015 exceeded maximum level permitted by EU regulations. The data on DON presence in Serbian maize were in relation to the different weather conditions that prevailed during the two harvest seasons.

While considering whether the mechanism of parallel debt exists under the Serbian law, the Anglo-Saxon mechanism of trust is represented. Hence it is explained why the mechanism of trust is not allowed under the Serbian law. Further on, the mechanism of parallel debt is introduced as well as a debate on permissibility of its cause in the Serbian law. Comparative legal arguments about this issue are also presented in this paper. In conclusion, the author suggests that on the basis of the conclusions drawn in this paper, the parallel debt mechanism is to be declared admissible if it is ever taken into consideration by the Serbian courts.\n\nPsychometric Evaluation of the Serbian Version of the Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scale\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJovanovic, Veljko; Zuljevic, Dragan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe main purpose of this study was to evaluate psychometric properties of the Serbian version of the Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scale (MSLSS). The research was carried out on a sample of 408 high school students (250 females, 158 males), with the mean age 16.6.

Owing to their exchange of opinions, the conceptions in classifying Serbian dialects evolved over the 1905-1910 period more noticeably than in the whole of earlier or later research. The 20th century is considered to be the golden age of Serbian dialectology, the primary academic preoccupation of the two greatest Serbian linguists of the last century: Aleksandar BeliÄ and Pavle IviÄ. Though certain milestones were hit in the mentioned period (many blank spots were removed from the dialectal maps; dozens of monographic descriptions were published on individual speech types; valuable initial results were achieved in the domain of urban dialectology; valuable studies were completed in the domain of dialectal lexicography and onomasticon, many questions were answered in Serbian historical dialectology, etc., as things turned out, serious and comprehensive tasks were transferred into the third millennium. In order to pass the final judgement on the relevant matters of the discipline, it is necessary to define the areals of some phonological features on the territory of Serbia and eastern Bosnia, details that earlier researchers have missed. The results of the study of the Serbian dialectal complex were predominantly published in the Serbian Dialectological Review (Srpski dijalektoloÅ¡ki zbornik, a respectable journal established in 1905 in the Serbian Royal Academy after the publication of Aleksandar BeliÄâs seminal Dialects of Eastern and Southern Serbia. The paper emphasises the unequal degree of study of the Serbian dialectal mosaic, in which as a rule the area of the western republics of the former state âtakes precedence,â where the Serbian speeches did not have a priority\n\nRadionuclide content in laundry detergents commercially available on the Serbian market and assessment of radiological environmental hazards\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVukanac Ivana S.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Laundry detergents are chemicals widely used in everyday life, and in numerous industry branches. In order to perceive the radiological aspect of environmental pollution by wastewater, the analysis of laundry detergents available on the Serbian market was undertaken. Laundry detergent samples were measured by means of gamma spectrometry and the results are presented in this paper. Analysis of the obtained activity concentrations showed that laundry detergents in Serbia mostly fulfill the international recommendation and requirements regarding the phosphate content. Besides that, the content of the detected radionuclides in laundry detergent samples indicates the minor radiological risk to the environment via wastewaters. [Project of the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Grant no. 171018\n\nTotal protein and lipid contents of canned fish on the Serbian market\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMarkoviÄ Goran; MladenoviÄ Jelena; CvijoviÄ Milica; MiljkoviÄ Jelena\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTotal protein and lipid contents were analysed in 5 samples of canned fish (sardines, Atlantic mackerel fillets, tuna in olive oil, smoked Baltic sprat and herring fillets) available on the Serbian market. Standard methods for the determination of protein (Kjeldahl method) and lipid (Soxhlet method) contents were used on drained samples. The protein content was 21.31% on average, with a range of 18.59% - 24.17%. Total lipids showed considerably large variations (5.49% - 35.20%), and averaged ...\n\nSerbian lexicology today: Current achievements and perspectives\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDragiÄeviÄ Rajna M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available At the turn of 21st century Serbian lexicology is under the influence of the Slavic (predominantly Russian and Anglo-Saxon semanticists. Different semantic theories are used in language analyses in Serbian papers. Since the 1970s componential analysis had been a leading theory, but as of the 1990s Serbian lexicology has come under the influence of cognitive linguistics. There are more and more interdisciplinary investigations where linguistics is interwoven with psychology, communicology, and sociology. Often, lexicology is interwoven with other linguistic disciplines, such as syntax, word formation, morphology, stylistics, etc. Recently, some semantic studies have been conducted from the pragmatic viewpoint. Depending on the object of the analysis and the theory chosen, different research methods are used, such as collocational, associative, and additionally, various types of syntactic and semantic approaches are taken. The focus of interest is semantics of words, and less frequent of morphemes or sentences. The future of Serbian lexicology lies in promoting an interdisciplinary approach, and its relation with other linguistic disciplines and other nonlinguistic sciences.

Since inception of the alexithymia construct in 1970âs, there has been a continuous effort to improve both its theoretical postulates and the clinical utility through development, standardization and validation of assessment scales. Objective. The aim of this study was to validate the Serbian translation of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20 and to propose a new method of translation of scales with a property of temporal stability. Methods. The scale was expertly translated by bilingual medical professionals and a linguist, and given to a sample of bilingual participants from the general population who completed both the English and the Serbian version of the scale one week apart. Results. The findings showed that the Serbian version of the TAS-20 had a good internal consistency reliability regarding total scale (Î±=0.86, and acceptable reliability of the three factors (Î±=0.71-0.79. Conclusion. The analysis confirmed the validity and consistency of the Serbian translation of the scale, with observed weakness of the factorial structure consistent with studies in other languages. The results also showed that the method of utilizing a self-control bilingual subject is a useful alternative to the back-translation method, particularly in cases of linguistically and structurally sensitive scales, or in cases where a larger sample is not available. This method, dubbed as âforth-translationâ, could be used to translate psychometric scales measuring properties which have temporal stability over the period of at least several weeks.\n\n[125 years' of the Serbian Medical Society].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSuloviÄ, V; PavloviÄ, B\n\n1998-01-01\n\nIn the second half of the last century and under the influence of the European civilization, Serbia abandoned the conservative and patriarchal way of life and began to introduce a new, contemporary political, cultural and social spirit into the country. The development of these civilizing features was under the influence of young intelectuals who, as former scholarship holders of the Serbian government, were educated in many European countries. Among them, there was a group of physicians who returned to the country after having completed their education. They were carriers and holders of the contemporary medical science in Serbia and the neighbouring areas. On April 22, 1872 a group of 15 physicians founded the Serbian Medical Society with the intention to offer an organized medical help and care to the population. The first president was Dr. AÄim MedoviÄ and the first secretary Dr. Vladan DordeviÄ. At the meeting held on May 15, 1872 the text of the Statute of the Society was accepted and immediately submitted for approval to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In the letter addressed to the minister of internal affairs the following reasons were cited: \"... The Belgrade physicians feeling a need for having the main office for their professional and scientific meetings, for which they will find the opportunity and the funds, and in spite of their hard medical labor which requires almost all their time, decided to establish the Serbian Medical Society because they wish to be in trend and follow-up the medical progress and exchange the latest medical information not only among them but also with other graduated doctors living in areas with the Serblan population as well as with all scientists who are willing to contribute to the development of medical science in Serbia...\". In the first year of its existence the Serbian Medical Society had 9 regular members, 1 honorary member and 34 corresponding members from Serbia, Slavic and other foreign countries.

The very presence of this medical instrument in Serbian medieval art indicates its usage in Serbian medical practices of the time. Phlebotomy is one of the oldest forms of therapy, widely spread in medieval times. It is also mentioned in Serbian medical texts, such as Chilandar Medical CodexNo. 517 and Hodoch code, i.e. translations from Latin texts originating from Salerno-Montpellier school. Lancet or phlebotome is identified based on archaeological finds from the Roman period, while finds from the Middle Ages and especially from Byzantium have been scarce. Analyses of preserved frescoes and icons has shown that, in comparison to other medical instruments, lancet is indeed predominant in Serbian medieval art, and that it makes for over 80% of all the representations, while other instruments have been depicted to a far lesser degree. Examination of written records and art points to the conclusion that Serbian medieval medicine, both in theory and in practice, belonged entirely to European traditions of the period.\n\nThe Serbian idea in an era of confused historical consciousness\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMitroviÄ Milovan M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper, represents a hypothetical consideration of the phenomenology of the Serbian national idea, within the traumatic circumstances of the breakup of the Yugoslav state at the end of the 20th century, when the Serbian national issue was reopened in an exceptionally unfavorable geopolitical context for the Serbian people. The author specifically analyzes the ideological and political factors behind the Serbian confusion with the theoretical framework of Agnes Heller's critical interpreta...\n\nReliability and validity of Serbian version of children's dental fear questionnaire\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLaliÄ Maja\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background/Aim. Dental anxiety leads to avoidance of dental treatment and could lead to impaired oral health. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of the Serbian version of Childrenâs Fear Survey Schedule Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS and the relations between dental anxiety and oral health status in a sample of Serbian schoolchildren. Methods. The CFSS-DS scale was translated into Serbian and administered to 231 (12-year old patients of the Pediatric Dental Department, Public Health Center Äukarica, Belgrade. The number of healthy, decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT score in children was determined by a clinical exam. Results. The average CFSS-DS score was 26.47 Â± 10.33. The girls reported higher anxiety than the boys (p < 0.05. Most common fears were drilling, choking, going to the hospital and anesthesia. Lower CFSS-DS scores were recorded in children with all healthy teeth (p < 0.05. Children with higher CFSS-DS scores mostly visit the dentist due to pain or parental insistence, and those with lower anxiety scores more often visited dentist due to regular check-ups or non-invasive treatments (p < 0.01. A high value of the Cronbach's coefficient of internal consistency (Î± = 0.88 was found in the entire scale. Conclusion. The Serbian version of CFSS-DS questionnaire is reliable and valid psychometric instrument for evaluation of dental fear in Serbian children. Dental anxiety negatively affects dental attendance and oral health of the examined schoolchildren.\n\nSerbian Volunteers And Russian Revolution Of 1917\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIa. V. Vishniakov\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Using original documents from the Russian State Military Historical Archive, many of which are introduced for the first time, the author reveals details of creation and activities of the Serbian Volunteer Corps formed from captured soldiers and officers of the Austro-Hungarian army inOdessain the Summer 1916. The same autumn it received a baptism of fire in Dobruja fighting in the separate corps of the Russian army under the command of General Zayonchkovsky. The research interest in studying the activities of ânationalâ and \"international\" military units within the Russian army is connected with the question of expediency and effectiveness of using such forces against those for whom they have not so long ago shed blood. The author, contrary to the popular opinion of Serbian historians, shows that the call to join the First Serbian division did not arouse mass enthusiasm among the prisoners of war both Serbs and representatives of other Yugoslav nations because of well-founded fears for their close relatives living in the Dual Monarchy and a fairly comfortable stay in the Russian captivity. At the same time, the author emphasizes that this military unit, commanded by officers of the Serbian regular army, was considered by the political leadership ofSerbiaas the basis of the future armed forces of the new state ofYugoslavia. The article shows that the events of the Russian Revolution of 1917 influenced the future fate of this military formation.

All 606 participants (Mage = 10.33, SD = 1.55 completed the TEIQue-CF, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (revised version, and the Guess Who peer assessment. Data on academic achievement and truancy were also obtained. The Serbian TEIQue-CF demonstrated robust psychometric properties with satisfactory internal consistencies and extensive evidence of validity in relation to criteria such as emotion recognition, academic grades, truancy rates, and peer ratings. Factor analyses suggested a two-factor solution for the total sample, but a unifactorial structure for the two groups of younger children aged 8 to 9 and 10 to 11. Overall, the results corroborate the validity of the Serbian adaptation and the theoretical and practical importance of the construct of trait EI in children.

The morphological structure and semantics of compound lexemes are considered, as well as strategies for translating English metaphorical compound lexemes into Serbian. The analysis reveals that Serbian cannot cope with the dynamic nature of traffic engineering terminology in English, and that Anglicisms, synonyms of different polysemous terms and vague conceptual determinations are characteristic of Serbian terminological equivalents\n\nSerbian crisis: How to reflect about it?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKoprivica Äaslav D.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In this article, which is just an initial paper within a few-year-long research, we are trying to identify causes of the crisis which the Serbian state and the Serb people experience - not just in the last few years or decades, but, as we believe, already for centuries. The main problem is Serbs' long-lasting incapability to consolidate both: the national identity and a national state, which is caused by permanent instability of Serbian history, absence of an active attitude toward their own tradition and a lack of notion of self-virtue which dominate the Serbian national \"character\". There are two main difficulties of the present day Serbian crisis: the fact that our people and their state are not well-fitted to the contemporary world and its civilization, which is, as a matter fact, quite a permanent issue in modern history of the Serbs, as well as the loss of vitality, which in the past at least substituted the poor success in \"socialization\" in the world ruled by major nations. This dual shortcoming is a very unfavorable prerequisite for facing challenges which are doubtlessly expecting our, to say it with Plessner, \"uncompleted nation\".\n\nThe presidential elections in Montenegro and the destruction of Serbian national consciousness\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÄurkoviÄ MiÅ¡a\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Author uses example of the last presidential elections in Montenegro trying to analyze several factors of transition at the Balkans. The overview of the elections' process shows that international community is the key factor in preventing democratic changes in this small state. The main reason for this attitude is geopolitical rearrangement of the Balkans intended toward oppression and cleaning of Serbian factor in former Yugoslav republics. Finally, author shows that crucial factor of this chain in making of new constellation is business and Serbian political elite, whose behavior displays absolute lack of national consciousness, responsibility and solidarity.\n\nCultural borrowing - Serbian jogurt between the east and the west\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPetroviÄ SneÅ¾ana M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper offers an analysis of the cultural borrowing process of the Turkish word yoÄurt âyogurtâ in Serbian. The study begins with the analysis of the Serbian lexical material from the 19th century, when the word jogurt was marked as an exclusively foreign word. The comparison with the present status of the meaning and usage of the word jogurt in contemporary Serbian, in which the word is part of the standard language, shows two different layers of the borrowing process: the Ottoman Turkish period and the Non-Turkish one. The most recent, Post-Ottoman borrowing layer is illustrated by the usage of jogurt as an element of a proverb that is a calque from the Turk. Sutten aÄzÄ± yanan yoÄurdu (veya ayranÄ± ufleyerek yer (veya icer âwho gets burned by milk, blows into yogurt as wellâ.

The study also looked at the relationship of reading and auditory comprehension and between reading comprehension and reading aloud in these groups. Participants were 20 people with Broca's and 20 with Wernicke's aphasia. They were asked to read aloud and to understand written material from the Serbian adaptation of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. A Serbian Word Reading Aloud Test was also used. The people with Broca's aphasia achieved better results in reading aloud and in reading comprehension than those with Wernicke's aphasia. Those with Wernicke's aphasia showed significantly more semantic errors than those with Broca's aphasia who had significantly more morphological and phonological errors. From the data we inferred that lesion sites accorded with previous work on networks associated with Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia and with a posterior-anterior axis for reading processes centred on (left) parietal-temporal-frontal lobes.

Foundation initiators were physicians of the following nationalities: 5 Serbs, 3 Czechs, 2 Poles, 3 Germans, 1 Slovak and 1 Greek. Josip PanciÄ was one of its founders as well, and the first president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Dr. AÄim MedoviÄ was elected its first President at the Inaugural Assembly, and Dr. Vladan DordeviÄ its Secretary. Later, on October 17, 1874 Constitution of the Serbian Medical Society was passed and its was acknowledged by the Serbian Interior Minister. The first professional meeting was held on August 5, 1872, when they started the first medical journal named \"Serbian Archives for All Physicians\" (\"Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo\") that is being published regularly even today. At the proposal of SLD a Law on Medical Protection was passed (1881). This Law was translated into two European languages, German and French, and sent to be reconsidered by 400 towns throughout Europe. This Law included, beside the other things, the following: \"...penny intended for health cannot be spent either by King, or by the Government or by any political party because it is intended for the health, tratement of the sick and doctors' salaries...\" The first Congress of the Serbian physicians and scientists devoted to natural sciences was held in Belgrade from 5th to 7th of September, 1904, and it gahtered about 433 participants, among which over hundred were from abroad. In 1907 SLD organized in Belgrade \"The First Scientific Conference of Yugoslav Doctors for Operating Surgery\". Red Cross in Serbia was founded upon the initiative of SLD. The first initiative to establish the School of Medicine in Belgrade was given by SLD as well. Members of SLD proved their loyalty and devotion to their people, democracy and liberty during liberation wars in XIX and XX century by putting themselves in service of the sich and wrecked.

Weasel claims represent a form of covert communication and are characterized by the use of deliberately vague and misleading language. In the advertising discourse, this linguistic device helps advertisers to deal with sensitive issues, overcome consumers' distrust and thus influence their behavior. The research has been conducted on a corpus of 100 advertisements that belong to various categories, such as cars, cleaning products, cosmetics, drinks, food, etc., published in printed magazines and online sources from the year 2000 onwards. The aim of the analysis is to identify manifestations of weasel claims in the corpus, establish similarities and differences regarding their use in the given languages, and show how they influence the interpretation of the advertising message and create consumer behavioral patterns. Descriptive and contrastive analyses have been employed in the research. The study also draws on Grice's Cooperative Principle. The results will show that this deceptive tool is widespread in both languages and that its use in the advertising discourse in Serbian requires further research.\n\nAttitudes of Serbian adults towards e-cigarette use\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBiljana Kilibarda; Srmena Krstev; Nadezda Nikolic; Nevena Sovic; Nada Kosic Bibic\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIntroduction To analyze the attitudes of Serbian adults related to e-cigarettes and provide a basis for the development of targeted interventions.

The participants were 362 teachers from 57 primary schools in Serbia. Nine dimensions of job satisfaction (Pay, Promotion, Supervision, Fringe Benefits, Contingent Rewards, Operating Procedures, Co-Workers, Nature of Work, Communication were measured. The results indicate that from the dimensions of job satisfaction, Serbian primary teachers are most satisfied with the Nature of work, Communication and Supervision, while the major sources of Serbian primary teachers' job dissatisfaction are Fringe benefits, Pay and Operating procedures. When it comes to the gender difference in job satisfaction, T-test analysis shows slightly higher satisfaction among female teachers, while statistically significant difference exists only in two dimensions: Supervision and Nature of work. Serbian policy makers in the field of education as well as school administrators should pay close attention to teachers' job satisfaction and its improvement considering that it is an essential to the continuing growth of school effectiveness.\n\nFumonisins production potential of Fusarium verticillioides isolated from Serbian maize and wheat kernels\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKrstoviÄ SaÅ¡a Z.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The production of fumonisins by potentially toxigenic Fusarium verticillioides isolates originating from Serbian maize and wheat kernels was tested in vitro. A total of six F. verticillioides isolates were incubated on yeast extract sucrose medium (YESA for 4 weeks at 25 Â°C in the dark. Their toxin production potential was tested by applying a modified HPLC method for determination of fumonisins in cereals, since the TLC method gave no results. Analyses were performed on a HPLC-FLD system after sample extraction from YESA and extract cleanup on a SPE column. Although the isolates were tested for fumonisin B1, B2 and B3, only fumonisin B1 was detected. The results showed that all tested isolates had toxigenic potential for fumonisin B1 production. The average fumonisin B1 production of the isolates ranged from 7 to 289 Î¼g/kg, thus indicating a highly variable toxigenic potential among the isolates. Isolate 1282 expressed the highest toxigenic potential for fumonisin B1 production (289 Î¼g/kg, while isolate 2533/A showed a questionable potential for fumonisin production (7 Î¼g/kg.

A mostly Hungarian speaking city for centuries, Szabadka/Subotica suffered the strong pro-Serbian language policy implemented by the Yugoslavian government from the end of the First World War until the dismantlement of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which gave Hungarian and other local minority languages a second chance to survive. Nowadays, Szabadka/Subotica is home to two main language groups, southern Slavic languages such a Serbian and Croatian (over sixty per cent and Hungarian (thirty three per cent. Although Ferdinand and Komlosi employed official figures from the Serbian censuses to determine the size of each group, the situation of each language was mapped through empirical observation of language use in informal conversations, in official signage, and in permanent as well as temporary commercial signage. The results show that the role of Serbian (mostly written in Latin script is dominant in almost all spheres of public life and as a lingua franca among various groups. Nevertheless, Hungarian maintains a strong presence in the city, especially in the center and in its northwestern districts. In this paper, Ferdinand and Komlosi aim to contribute to a better general understanding of group dynamics in bilingual settings and, specifically, to provide a clearer view of the language situation in one of the Hungarian-speaking regions lost by the historic Kingdom of Hungary after World War I.\n\nNationality non-discrimination in Serbian tax treaty law\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKostiÄ Svetislav V.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper deals with the nationality non-discrimination provision in Serbian double taxation treaties. First the author analyses the historical development of the nationality non-discrimination clause found the in the OECD Model Tax Convention and illustrates the dilemmas related to its interpretation, particularly the relevance of residence of taxpayers for comparability purposes and the application of Art. 24.1 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Subsequently, the author turns his attention to the solutions found in Serbian double taxation treaties which are methodologically divided into three groups. One of them stands out as the most notable, being unique in global terms: double taxation treaties which provide for a prohibition of discriminatory treatment based on residence. The author critically addresses the fundamental flaws of the Serbian double taxation treaty policy which are recognized thorough a detailed scrutiny of the relevant norms of these international agreements.\n\nLow competitiveness of undeveloped areas: 'Narrow throat' of Serbian economy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVukoviÄ Darko\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Inconsistent development policy and traditionally inherited poverty, lack of adequate institutional support and the impact of the transition of Serbian economy are affected the deepening of the parameters of underdeveloped areas in Serbia (South Serbia and Stari Ras and appear of new underdeveloped area (Borski basen. These areas have very low competitiveness and represent bottleneck in the overall competitiveness of Serbian economy. Low Serbian competitiveness caused by many problems (corruption, ineffective legal system and weak protection of contracts, political instability and others, where undeveloped areas represent a special dimension of this problem, with their specific problems, current from almost every social standpoint. This paper explains the specific factors that are the largest source of uncompetitiveness underdeveloped areas, analyzing economic, demographic and socio-political factors, as well as infrastructure, unemployment and education. Results showed that these indicators of competitiveness in underdeveloped areas have far less values than the same indicators in other areas in Serbia. The major causes of low competitiveness of underdeveloped areas (except common with the Republic of Serbia are: low employment, low economic activity, low productivity, low investments, poor educational and demographic structure, underdeveloped infrastructure and socio-political uncertainty. At the end, the paper presents the measures and incentives which increase competitiveness of underdeveloped areas.\n\nAnalysis of the Capital Budgeting Practices: Serbian Case\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLidija Barjaktarovic\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper addresses two major research questions: which techniques firms in Serbia use for project evaluation, and how the Serbian companies calculate their cost of capital. The authors have created the questionnaire and the sample consisting of 65 companies that responded to the enquiry (out of 392 during the year 2015. The results showed that payback criterion is the most dominant capital budgeting technique used by firms in Serbia. Further, the results revealed that large firms as well as multinational firms are more inclined to use discounted cash flow capital budgeting techniques and other sophisticated techniques. Finally, the authors have concluded that the CAPM is not the dominant method for calculating cost of capital by the companies from the sample analyzing the overall sample. Consequently, skilled human capital, the adequate knowledge and developed procedures may contribute to accepting capital budgeting techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and other sophisticated techniques by larger portion of the companies in Serbia. Finally, existence of perfect financial market is a necessary precondition for implementing all these contemporary financial concepts and its development has to be posed as one of the priorities in the years to come.\n\nCrystallite size distribution of clay minerals from selected Serbian clay deposits\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSimiÄ Vladimir\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The BWA (Bertaut-Warren-Averbach technique for the measurement of the mean crystallite thickness and thickness distributions of phyllosilicates was applied to a set of kaolin and bentonite minerals.

During the period of 35 years, SLM had released nearly 800 articles about music. Majority of that number belongs to the music criticism, but there are also studies and essays about music ethno musicological treatises, polemics, obituary notices, as well as many ample and diverse notes. SLM was published during the time when Serbian society, culture and art were influenced by strong challenges of Europeanization and modernization. Therefore, one of the most complicated questions that music writers of this magazine were confronted with was the question of avant-garde music evaluation. Relation of critics and essay writers to the avant-garde was ambiguous. On one side, SLM's authors accepted modern art in principle, but, on the other side, they questioned that acceptance when facing even a bit radical music composition. This ambivalence as a whole marked the work of Dr Miloje MilojeviÄ, the leading music writer of SLM. It is not the same with other critics and essayists Kosta ManojloviÄ was more tolerant, and Dragutin ÄoliÄ and Stanislav Vinaver were true protectors of the most avant-garde aspirations in music. First of all SLM was a literary magazine. In the light of that fact it has to be pointed out that very early, way back in 1912, critics wrote about Arnold Schoenberg, and that until the end of existence of this magazine the readers were regularly informed about all important avant-garde styles and composers of European, Serbian and Yugoslav music. The fact that Schoenberg Stravinsky, Honegger or Josip Slavenski mostly were not accepted by critics and essayists, expresses the basic aesthetic position of this magazine. Namely, SLM remained loyal to the moderate wing of modern music, music that had not rejected\n\nProcess of globalization and basic traits of Serbian national character\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAtlagiÄ Marko\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In contemporary world globalization, along with many perplexities, increasingly takes on the universal/cosmopolitan character in spite of all geographical, national, racial, religious and alignment barriers. Information exchange, scientific achievements and technology are nowadays world process. Economy increasingly becomes global. Serbia and Serbian people have their own specific character, which is defined by three significant characteristics: sovereignty and territorial integrity, aspirations to social justice, the rule of people and democracy. The creators of global society should take into consideration these three important characteristics of Serbian people with which Serbian political elite is to familiarize them, for the sake of more rapid and complete process of integration of Serbs into global processes from both Serbia and its neighboring countries would benefit.\n\nAn outline for Serbian political tradition in the work of Slobodan JovanoviÄ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBaziÄ Jovan R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents considerations of the research on the Serbian political tradition in the work of Slobodan JovanoviÄ (1869-1958, a famous Serbian lawyer, historian, writer and politician, who had a very important role in the development of the Serbian political thought. His work is extensive and varied, but in essence, it relates to the whole of political life in Serbia in the second half of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century. Almost all the elements that make up the Serbian political tradition can be observed in his work. All these elements are contained in the discussion of political institutions in the 19th century Serbia, the rule of the ObrenoviÄ dynasty, political parties and party leaders, political ideas and movements in Serbia and Yugoslavia, extreme political behavior and Serbian national character. JovanoviÄ found the origins of Serbian political tradition in the epic poetry and the Kosovo myth, as well as in the poetry of NjegoÅ¡. This was a decisive factor in the formation of general ideas about the Serbs as a freedom-loving, heroic and justice-loving people. At the same time, this is where the origins of the idea of Serbs as a disunited nation can be found. JovanoviÄ paid the greatest attention to issues concerning the content of Serbian political tradition, namely: constitutional system, political institutions, parliamentary life, inter-party struggles, political events, the role of the individual in politics and culture, authoritarianism and political violence. He pointed to the political ideas that were coming from the West and which were accepted with mistrust by the patriarchal Serbian society. He appreciated the role of political parties in the democratization of political life, but he also warned of the dangers that threatened national unity: party favouritism and intolerance. In the analyses of the Serbian national character, JovanoviÄ was of the opinion that the Serbs are predominantly a\n\nResearch of consumersâ attitudes on the organic food consumption in the Serbian enclaves in Kosovo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaksimoviÄ Goran\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The organic production in Serbian enclaves in Kosovo has a great potential based on the extensive production mostly in hilly-mountainous areas with rich and convenient environment for the organic production of medicinal plants, fruits, vegetables, wine, honey etc., but it still keeps developing. The enclave can realise a high income, and thereby also an economic basis for the sustainable development of multifunctional agricultural holdings in Serbian enclaves, by the production and sale of organic products on local markets. In this paper, the authors study the consumersâ attitudes on purchase and consumption of organic food in Serbian enclaves in Kosovo. Empirical research was carried out on a spatial sample of 300 respondents, by a personal communication technique using the questionnaire as an instrument of research method. Areas of research are towns: Northern Kosovska Mitrovica, Leposavic, Zubin Potok and Gracanica. Goal of the research is to discover the preferences, motives, attitudes and interests of consumers for buying the organic products, based on a defined survey to recognise the basic features of supply and the demand of organic agricultural and food products. After analysing the conducted survey, we have discovered that the organic food market in Serbian enclaves in Kosovo has not been sufficiently developed; it is necessary to expand the range of organic agriculture products and a constant supply is required, better marketing, and better information and education of consumers in order to raise supply to a higher level.\n\nThe use of colour name yellow in English and Serbian phraseologisms\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRatkoviÄ Jelena R.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This work shows in what ways the colour name yellow is associated with extra-linguistic reality in the English language. In Serbian translations, we can see many similarities, but also the absolute impossibility of finding either formal or partial correspondents considering metaphorical phraseologisms, or pure idioms, such as for example, those in which this colour is associated with jealousy (He wears yellow stockings or cowardice (He's yellow. The most similar comparisons are those with the sunshine and gold, but there are those that, when translated into Serbian, sound strange, such as yellow as marigold or yellow as a crow's foot. Similarly, it would be strange to use this colour name describing a face (or a whole person looking unhealthy, where in Serbian we use comparison 'yellow as wax'. Metonymically, the colour transfers and labels the whole group of people who supposedly have such a colour, as can be seen from examples high yellow, yellow peril, yellow line. In the Serbian language, people from Asia are also sometimes called the 'yellow', and in Serbian, as well as in the English language, this term has derogatory meaning, but the English language is a bit richer in these phraseologisms, perhaps because people from this continent started to settle in the territory of English-speaking countries earlier than in our country. In the English language, people are qualified by the phraseologisms yellow admiral and yellow dog as well, and those are also pure idioms: it is only possible to translate them into the Serbian language by semantic correspondents - nickname for those who were promoted from captain to admiral and smuggler of alcoholic beverages (or, in another sememe 'the one who is in opposition to the Union of merchants or trade unions'. Common to both languages is the use of this colour name for descriptions of old things (or people, as can be seen from the phraseologisms 'the sere and yellow leaf', 'the paper yellowed with age' and\n\nAffirmation Modality in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarcin Grygiel\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Affirmation Modality in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian In the case of affirmation modality the speakers transform their utterances by stressing or attributing a positive value as an additional component added to the semantic structure of a proposition. This type of affirmative polarization is triggered in opposition to negation or hypothetically negative contexts. The goal of the present paper is twofold: on the one hand to compare and contrast affirmative periphrastic constructions in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian and, on the other hand, to ascertain what these constructions reveal regarding the organization of grammatical categories in general and the status of affirmation modality as a coherent and homogenous category with a linguistic validity.\n\nTranslational equivalents and composition of the entries in bilingual English-Serbian dictionaries\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZeÄeviÄ SneÅ¾ana M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this paper is the analysis of translational eqivalents as well as of the composition of the entries in bilingual English-Serbian dictionaries. It is initially assumed that there are different microstructure and macrostructure of the dictionaries of different volume and purpose, likewise the correspondence of translational equivalents of their entries. The analysis conducted for the requirements of this paper included six randomly chosen lexemes of the English language taken from three bilingual dictionaries that were contrasted with their equivalent lexemes presented in the monolingual English dictionary which was later used for checking. The results of the analysis presented less meaning of the lexemes in Colloquial and Universal English-Serbian Dictionary while the utmost variety of semantic dimensions was noted in Encyclopedic English-Serbian Dictionary which by its quality and organization presents an inexhaustible source of information necessary for translating texts from English to Serbian language.\n\nEtymology of the Serbian language: With a glance at the past and a look into the future\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVlajiÄ-PopoviÄ Jasna B.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available After an introductory overview of previous achievements in the field, abroad and at home, during the 19th and 20th centuries, this paper deals with the present state of Serbian etymology (i.e. etymology of the Serbian language among the Serbs which, for several decades now, has been closely related to the Etymological Department of the Serbian Language Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

The specific objective of the survey presented here, however, was to build up the target picture with some of the features of the ideal example of the house category, such as the shape of the house, the key materials its principal structural elements (foundations, walls, a roof are made of, the number of residential units in the house and the type of the household that occupies it, the number of the house levels, the minimum of its interior spatial components and their functions, the types of systemic parts in the house, the status and position of the house relative to surroundÂ­ing buildings, etc. Also, taking into consideration that the demographic profiles of the survey participants reflected various cultural backgrounds (which significantly influence the formation of mental images of a typical sample of the category, the survey aimed to compare the similarities and differences between the 'English' and the 'Serbian' typical house, that is the features assigned to a typical house by most of the surveyed representaÂ­tives of Anglo-American and by those of Serbian culture. Judging exclusively by the features observed and the results obtained, the study concludes that the 'English' and the 'Serbian' typical house look very similar in many aspect and that the two different cultures are not as distant as they may seem.\n\nCommon scale features of the recent Greek and Serbian church chant traditions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPeno Vesna\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper is an attempt to show the similarity between the Serbian and Greek Post-Byzantine chanting traditions, especially those which relate to the scale organization of modes. Three teachers and reformers from Constantinople, Chrisantos, Gregorios and Chourmousios, established a fairly firm theoretical system for the first time during the long history of church chant. One of the main results of their reform, beside changes relating to neums, was the assignment of strict sizes to the intervals in the natural tonal system. There are three kinds of natural scales: diatonic, chromatic and encharmonic. They all have their place in the Greek Anastasimatarion chant book, whose first edition was prepared by Petar Peloponesios, and later edited by Ionnes Protopsaltes. The first, first plagal and forth plagal modes are diatonic in each of their melos, with very few exceptions; the second and second plagal are soft and hard chromatic, while the third and varis are encharmonic. It is important to note that the Greek chanter is very conscious of the scale foundation of the melody, so he begins to chant the apechima foremost, the intonation formula that comprehends all indisposed details to enter the adequate mode, i. e. melos. One mode could use one sort of scale for all groups of melodies - melos. However, in some modes there are different melos, whose scale organisation is not equal at all. That means that it is not proper to equate mode with scale, but rather to look for the specific scale's shape through the melodies that belong to the melos. The absence of formal Serbian church music theory and, especially, the very conservative way in which church melodies are learnt by ear and by heart, has caused significant gaps, which preclude an adequate approach to the essentional principals of Serbian chant. Over the years many Serbian chanters and musicians have noted down church melodies, especially those from the Octoechos, in F or in G, with the key\n\nEvaluation of food safety management systems in Serbian dairy industry\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIgor TomaÅ¡eviÄ\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper reports incentives, costs, difficulties and benefits of food safety management systems implementation in the Serbian dairy industry. The survey involved 27 food business operators with the national milk and dairy market share of 65 %. Almost two thirds of the assessed dairy producers (70.4 % claimed that they had a fully operational and certified HACCP system in place, while 29.6 % implemented HACCP, but had no third party certification. ISO 22000 was implemented and certified in 29.6 % of the companies, while only 11.1 % had implemented and certified IFS standard. The most important incentive for implementing food safety management systems for Serbian dairy producers was to increase and improve safety and quality of dairy products. The cost of product investigation/analysis and hiring external consultants were related to the initial set-up of food safety management system with the greatest importance. Serbian dairy industry was not greatly concerned by the financial side of implementing food safety management systems due to the fact that majority of prerequisite programmes were in place and regularly used by almost 100 % of the producers surveyed. The presence of competency gap between the generic knowledge for manufacturing food products and the knowledge necessary to develop and implement food safety management systems was confirmed, despite the fact that 58.8 % of Serbian dairy managers had university level of education. Our study brings about the innovation emphasizing the attitudes and the motivation of the food production staff as the most important barrier for the development and implementation of HACCP. The most important identified benefit was increased safety of dairy products with the mean rank scores of 6.85. The increased customer confidence and working discipline of staff employed in food processing were also found as important benefits of implementing/operating HACCP. The study shows that the level of HACCP\n\nMeasuring positive and negative affect and physiological hyperarousal among Serbian youth.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStevanovic, Dejan; Laurent, Jeff; Lakic, Aneta\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study extended previous cross-cultural work regarding the tripartite model of anxiety and depression by developing Serbian translations of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C), the Physiological Hyperarousal Scale for Children (PH-C), and the Affect and Arousal Scale (AFARS). Characteristics of the scales were examined using 449 students (M age = 12.61Â years). Applying item retention criteria established in other studies, PH-C, PANAS-C, and AFARS translations with psychometric properties similar to English-language versions were identified. Preliminary validation of the scales was conducted using a subset of 194 students (M age = 12.37Â years) who also completed measures of anxiety and depression. Estimates of reliability, patterns of correlations among scales, and age and gender differences were consistent with previous studies with English-speaking samples. Findings regarding scale validity were mixed, although consistent with existing literature. Serbian translations of the PH-C, PANAS-C, and AFARS mirror the original English-language scales in terms of both strengths and weaknesses.\n\nArhaiâs Balkan folktronica: Serbian ethno music reimagined for British market\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMediÄ Ivana\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This article focuses on Serbian composer Jovana BackoviÄ and her band/project Arhai, founded in Belgrade in 1998. The central argument is that Arhai made a transition from being regarded a part of the Serbian ethno music scene (which flourished during the 1990s and 2000s to becoming a part of the global world music scene, after Jovana BackoviÄ moved from her native Serbia to the United Kingdom to pursue an international career. This move did not imply a fundamental change of her musical style, but a change of cultural context and market conditions that, in turn, affected her cultural identity.

VasiÄ in Serbian Archaeology\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAleksandar Palavestra\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Miloje M. VasiÄ, \"the first academically educated archaeologist in Serbia\", has a strange destiny in the Serbian archaeology. On the one hand, he has been elevated to the post of the \"founding father\" of the discipline, with almost semidivine status and iconic importance, while on the other hand, his works have been largely unread and neglected. This paradoxical split is the consequence of the fact that VasiÄ has been postulated as the universal benchmark of the archaeological practice in Serbia, regardless of his interpretation of the past on the grounds of the archaeological record â the essence of archaeology. Strangely, the life and work of VasiÄ have not been the subject of much writing, apart from several obituaries, two short appropriate texts (SrejoviÄ, CermanoviÄ, and rare articles in catalogues and collections dedicated to the research of VinÄa (GaraÅ¡anin, SrejoviÄ, TasiÄ, NikoliÄ and VukoviÄ. The critical analysis of his whole interpretive constellation, with \"The Ionian colony VinÄa\" being its brightest star, was limited before the World War II to the rare attempts to rectify the chronology and identify the Neolithic of the Danube valley (Fewkes, GrbiÄ, Holste. After the war, by the middle of the 20th century, the interpretation of VasiÄ has been put to severe criticism of his students (GaraÅ¡anin, MilojÄiÄ, Benac, which led to the significant paradigm shift, the recognition of the importance of the Balkan Neolithic, and the establishment of the culture-historical approach in the Serbian archaeology. However, from this moment on, the reception of VasiÄ in the Serbian archaeology has taken a strange route: VasiÄ as a person gains in importance, but his works are neglected, though referred to, but almost in a cultic fashion, without reading or interpreting them. Rare is a paper on the Neolithic of the Central Balkans that does not call upon the name of VasiÄ and his four- volume \"VinÄa\", in which Neolithic is not\n\nMandatory and Voluntary Disclosures of Serbian Listed Companies - Achieved Level and Some Recommendation for Improving their Relevance\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKsenija DenÄiÄ-Mihajlov\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Purpose â This paper investigates mandatory and voluntary disclosure practices of non-financial listed companies on the Belgrade Stock Exchange. The results help in determining the level of transparency of Serbian s listed companies and in formulating recommendations for improving the quality and relevance of disclosed information. Design/methodology/approach â We focus on modeling both mandatory and voluntary disclosure indices for financial and non-financial information in order to evaluate the level of disclosure of 63 Serbian companies for reporting period 2012. Findings â We found the low level of both mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Concerning mandatary disclosure, the information that is least frequently disclosed by the sample companies are those related to the material content of the financial statements (information on changes in accounting estimates and corrections of fundamental errors in the previous period, as well as related companies. Serbian companies usually disclose information that contributes to their greater visibility. Similar to the mandatory disclosure, usually published voluntary information are mostly \"neutral\" from the point of impact on the values reported in the financial statements, which do not contribute to a better understanding of the financial position, profitability and cash flows of the company. Research limitations/implications â There is a limitation concerning the sample size (which is generally intrinsic to Serbian capital market size and the sample structure (research is limited to listed non-financial companies. The study covers the annual reports for 2012 which in Serbia coincides with a crisis period. The same research methodology could be applied on a larger and comprehensive database (non-listed companies and include period after 2012, which will allow the analysis of evolution of disclosure practices by companies within new accounting framework.

In this paper, we assess the impact of lemmatizers and stemmers for Serbian on classifiers trained and evaluated on the Serbian Movie Review Dataset. We also consider the effectiveness of using word embeddings, generated from a large unlabeled corpus, as classification features.\n\nThe seals of Karadjordje and of other most prominent leaders in the First Serbian uprising\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAtlagiÄ Marko\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The seals which carry the symbols of the First Serbian Uprising appeared quite early, only a few months after its breakout. The seals with the Uprising symbols have a distinct West-European heraldic form. According to their main symbols, these seals belong to either the monogram or the coat-of-arms type. In this paper, the seals of Vozd Karadjordje ProviteljstvujuÅ¡Äi Sovjet [Rulling Council], Mladen MilanoviÄ, Stojan ÄupiÄ Voivode Marko KatiÄ, as well as of Luka LazareviÄ have been analysed.

However, the limitation of the paperâs possible conclusion lies in the nature of the corpus: Vuk had deliberately chosen one material over another, therefore, the corpus relating to Greeks cannot be considered as representative of the whole Serbian folk poems. Therefore, the discussion is limited to certain elements of the stereotype. Nevertheless, these Serbian epic folk poems contain many layers: historical, geographical, sociological, mythological and so on, with a strong foundation in traditional culture; thus, they provide an insight into geo-political situation of the time period, viewpoints, perspectives and experiences of other ethnic groups that Serbs have been into contact with. In particular, the relationship toward Greeks was marked with pronounced patriarchal attitude concerning others: we-others, ours-foreign, good-bad. In this sense, Greeks are portrayed as foreign, and as such, as a potential source of danger. On the other hand, Greeks are Christian Orthodox, which associates them with the category ours. In socio-economic sense, they were traders and wealthy, respected gentlemen. In epical-heroic profile, they were not considered as great heroes, but as \"lousy army\", and frequently, as unfaithful.\n\nApplied ethnomusicology in Serbia: Politics and policies of Serbian ethnomusicological Society\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDumniÄ Marija\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper deals with ethnomusicological research methodologies, the application of ethnomusicological knowledge outside academic institutions and ideologies which have contributed to ethnomusicological discourses in Serbia. Furthermore, state policy on ethnomusicology and folk music is analyzed. The recent institutionalisation of applied ethnomusicology, i.e. direct ethnomusicological engagement in society, which represents a turning point in the development of ethnomusicology, is particularly emphasized. The difference between contemporary applied ethnomusicology and ethnomusicology is in direct engagement: goals are changed, new strategies of (field- work are introduced, folk music as a political tool is adopted, neutrality of research positions is destabilized, resulting in the emergence of the greatest problem of the discipline - ethics. Applied ethnomusicology in Serbia is especially interesting not only because of local cultural characteristics, but also because of the specific position of Serbian ethnomusicology in the scientific world map. The activities of the Serbian Ethnomusiclogical Society are analyzed as a representative example of successful public engagement. The projects of the Society are classified according to the type of animation (cultural and scientific. The promotion of Serbian folk music, folk music of national minorities and bagpipe-playing revitalization fall into the first category, whereas the second one comprises scientific round tables and the projects dealing with the preservation of Serbian folk music heritage.\n\nBREAD-MAKING QUALITY OF SLOVAK AND SERBIAN WHEAT VARIETIES\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTatiana BojÅanskÃ¡\n\n2014-02-01\n\nFull Text Available The basic prerequisite for the production of bakery products of a good quality is the knowledge of the quality parameters of raw materials introduced in the production process and the ability to use their potential. The bread making properties of 17 pure European wheat cultivars were analysed. Baking experiments were carried out according to the methodology of the research workplace; 1000 g of flour was processed with the addition of salt, sugar and yeast. Fermentation for 35 minutes at 30 Â° C was followed by the baking with steaming (at 240 Â° C and then 220 Â° C. During an experimental baking test the selected parameters: loaf volume (cm3, specific loaf volume (cm3.100g-1 loaf, volume efficiency (cm3.100g-1 flour, cambering (loaf height/width ratio, bread yield (%, bread yield baking loss (% in bread were evaluated. Loaf volume has been considered as the most important criterion for the bread-making quality. In the analysed samples (11 varieties of Slovak origin and 6 varieties of Serbian origin, the value of this parameter ranged from 3575 cm3 to 5575 cm3 with higher values occurred in Slovak varieties (average 4 640.91 cm3 compared to the Serbian varieties (average 4 363.33 cm3. Based on the complex evaluation of wheat varieties of the Slovak and Serbian origin assessing the selected quality parameters of the baking experiment it can be concluded that in terms of baking quality the three Slovak varieties IS Ezopus, Bonavita and Jarissa were the best. Therefore, they are recommended for cultivation and their subsequent use in the baking industry, in particular for the production of bread According to a baking quality the evaluated varieties can be sorted from best to worst in the following order: IS Ezopus (SK > Bonavita (SK > Jarissa (SK > IS Questor > Etida (SRB > Venistar (SK > Renesansa (SRB > IS Conditor (SK > IS Corvinus (SK > Zvezdana (SRB > Simonida (SRB > Viglanka (SK > IS Agape (SK > NS 40S (SRB > Panonnija (SRB > IS Escoria (SK\n\nA decade of sulphite control in Serbian meat industry and the effect of HACCP.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTomasevic, Igor; Dodevska, Margarita; SimiÄ, Milan; Raicevic, Smiljana; Matovic, Violeta; Djekic, Ilija\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn total 7351 meat preparations and fresh processed meat products were analysed from 555 different Serbian meat producers over a 10-year period, 4.5 years before and 5.5 years after mandatory Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) implementation. From the obtained results, it could be concluded that HACCP has contributed to a better alignment of practices with the legal provisions. The share of non-compliant samples dropped from 18.6% before HACCP to 8.3% after its mandatory implementation. Average sulphite concentrations for all categories of meat preparations and fresh processed meat products decreased by 43%, declining from 33.6 to 19.3Â mg kg -1 . Typical misuse and frequent abuse of sulphites was independent of a season. Application of HACCP principles in the Serbian meat industry raised awareness about the misuse of sulphites and contributed to a better control, minimising exposure to sulphites.\n\nMethodological spot of establishing silt deposit concentration in Serbian rivers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDragiÄeviÄ Slavoljub\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Recent methodology of sampling and establishing silt deposit concentration in Serbian rivers is associated to numerous deficiencies. Daily concentrations of this type of river deposit on the most of the hydrological gauges were obtained on the base of only one measurement, which takes into consideration the matter of representative ness of those samples. Taking the samples of deposit in one point on the profile is little bit problematic because of dispersion of the obtained results. Very important matter is the question of choice of the sampling location. This analyses of data may lead to serious spots in calculating total carried deposit. From the above mentioned reasons, we decided to take precise measurements of silt deposit concentration as well as to establish methodological spots of measurements. The results of these measurements are analyzed and presented in this paper.\n\nThe identity controversies about Albanians in Serbian historiography\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÄorÄeviÄ Radomir D.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The period of our new historiography is mostly burdened by a political discourse of a new establishment, with which the so called period of \"brotherhood and unity\" began in the former Yugoslavia. In that period of time, but also after the fall of socialism in 1998, fascination with Yugoslavism is still present in the Serbian history. There are almost no textbooks or monographs in which a dogmatic way of thinking is critically reviewed as incomprehensible in our historical science. This is especially related to the problem of Albanian ethnogenesis and their presence in the Balkans. By adopting this imposed opinion that the Albanians are a native population, our historians directly made an immense damage to the Serbian people.\n\nThe foundation and work of the Serbian bookstore in Thessaloniki (1890-1896\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZarkoviÄ Vesna S.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available At the end of the 19th century, diplomatic activity of the Kingdom of Serbia was reinforced. It had especially come to the fore when in 1886 Stojan NovakoviÄ was appointed as the deputy in Constantinople. He, as an experienced diplomat, realized the significance of the national idea spreading, and worked actively to that end. After the signing of consular convention, and opening of Serbian consulates in Osman's Empire, conditions for the opening of larger number of schools were created for which the permissions from Turkish authorities were to be acquired. As the number of Serbian pupils increased, and the numbers of schools as well, the issue of books supply was raised, which was not easy at all in that time. Turkish government issued the permission in 1890 that books for Serbian schools should be printed in Constantinople. All books which were to be printed had to pass the censorship of the Educational Committee. Thanks to the reinforced Serbian diplomatic activity in spreading the national idea, some shifts were made, which led representatives of Serbs in Osman's Empire to the idea of opening bookstores. Almost in the same time, bookstores in PriÅ¡tina, Prizren, and Thessaloniki were opened. The bookstore in Thessaloniki bore the official title the Serbian bookstore, and managed to work and survive despite the propaganda of Bulgarian exarchists which tried to thwart its existence frequently by associating with Turkish authorities. The business activity report was filed to the Consulate, which regulated its activities through contracts and measures.\n\nTHE PLANNING, PROGRAMING, BUDGETING SYSTEM AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE SERBIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSasa RADUSKI\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The main purpose of introducing the PPBES to the Serbian Ministry of Defense and the Serbian Armed Forces is to provide a rational management of resources and to maintain and build capacity of the Ministry and the Serbian Armed Forces in order to achieve their goals, objectives and missions.Expected results of implementation of the PPBES are reflected in increasing the efficiency and rationalization of the defense planning to a higher level, ensuring compatibility with defense planning and budgeting system of the state and developing a foundation for the effective management of defense resources.\n\nLocal Culinary Traditions in the Integration Process of Serbian Food Market with European Union\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTadeusz Czekalski\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Its huge area of cultivated lands (about 5 million hectares makes Serbia stand out against other states of the Balkan region.
