        "text": "The present essay represents a departure from the previous literary assessments of Borislav Pekić as a postmodern writer. In it, I wish to situate Pekić’s aesthetics within the framework of Expressionism. Such an approach is warranted by the author himself quite explicitly in what I shall call his \"essay-manifesto\" of 1984, \"The Myth of Literature and the Myth of Reality.\" It consists of the seven separate sections. My analysis is focused only on the second section, \"The Destruction of Reality, or The Myth of Man,\" a concept, which Pekić seems to readily accept with entirety of the Nietzschean expressionist revolution. In the fi rst part of my essay, I discuss Pekić’s rejection of Aesthetic Realism and his consideration of the form in literature which has become to a great extent the content of art. Then I try to explain the second part of the title of Pekić’s second principle, \"[The Destruction of Reality], or the Myth of Man.\" The Myth of Man\", in my understanding, refers to the concept of human mythic consciousness, which appears to be the founding principle of narrative, which is the essence of human cognition. In the third part of my analysis, I describe briefl y Pekić’s view of the function of literature in society. In this regard, Pekić goes beyond Nietzsche and the Expressionists since he does not see that art has redemptive value. However, he recognizes the interaction between life and art. The aesthetization of life together with the destruction of reality, the priority of the literary form, and the concept of narrative clearly connects Pekić with Expressionist aesthetics.\n\nThe study discusses Ivan Slamnig’s novel entitled Bolja polovica hrabrosti with focusing on the narrative features of the beginning of the novel. Using the results of the Croatian literary studies, the paper places the novel in the context of Croatian prose as the ﬁrst postmodern Croatian novel and an outstanding example of Beat literature in Croatia and Yugoslavia, which Aleksandar Flaker called jeans prose.The paper compares the narrative features and metapoetic meanings of the beginning of the novel with the narration of the whole novel and its closure. It establishes that the beginning of the novel gives a dominant role to eventuality, coincidence, and meaninglessness instead of causally motivated storytelling. The beginning of the novel does not make sense at the level of the story told in the whole novel, however, it is important at the metalevel of narration and in its possible readings.The main character of the novel called Flaks lands without a known aim aft er escaping fro...\n\nBy using different primary sources and perspectives of various disciplines, the purpose of this paper is to describe the types of play and relation between individual and society in the second half of the 19th century in Serbia. The texts used intersect different time and genre perspectives: fiction, autobiographical texts, documentary prose and periodicals of the time. Findings show that the Serbian writers decribed different types of play, those adjusted by social norms and some forbidden, dangerous, pathological and destructive. Play was an element of both private and public space, they were often played by people of similar age. Some dances reflect a distinctive vilage and city etnography. While a folk dance “kolo“ and heroic, competitive games were organised in rural areas, ballroom dance and theatre plays were organised in urban areas. Descriptions of parents playing with their children rarely appeared; in such narratives fathers emerged as devoted and gentle figures. Male and female authors differ when it comes to choosing the type of play and its style. In the autobiographical writings, women revealed their early childhood resistance toward gender role stereotypes. When narrating the same types of play women authors showed more literary talent than men. One of the women writers described a literary game which reflected the power of her imagination and creativity. A note from a Serbian periodical of the time revealed a little known card game, which had a purpose of enforcing the canon of Serbian male writers. This study shows that play is a phenomenon inseparable from society's ethics. In its understanding, the texts' power of discovery appears as a more important characteristic than the nature of the genres.\n\nThis paper deals with prophetic and messianic ideological constructions found in Serbian literature of the Ottoman period. Prophetic accounts developed in two connected directions among the Serbs in this period. On the one hand, old Byzantine-Slavonic prophetic narratives (for example the Revelation of Pseudo-Methodius, the apocryphal Visions of Daniel, the Oracles of Leo the Wise) were copied and actualized according to the politi-co-historical context. On the other, new anti-Ottoman and anti-Islamic prophetic accounts were created. Serbian and South-Slavonic prophetic notions were mostly concentrated on the impending doom of the Ottoman Empire and the legendary emperor of the \"last times\", who was supposed to vanquish the Ottomans. Moreover, the Serbs tried to understand the new historical context of the Ottoman period and perceive it through the theological prism. Therefore they started creating a suitable messianic perspective of their destiny with the help of old, well-known ideas from the Nemanjić period (for example the idea of \"new Israel\"). Both prophetic and messianic ideological constructions seemed to be consoling ideas, which were created to highlight the memory of the magnificent past in the dramatic period of the Ottoman conquest and domination. During the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the second half of the 14 th century and the subsequent Ottoman dominance, the Christian Serbs tried to understand the emergence of the new order and the interference of the destabilizing factors. It was important to connect it to the history of salvation and God's plans for humanity according to the medieval model of the world and a strictly theological view on reality (Serbi-an literature had a medieval character until the 18 th century). Therefore, the (Serbian)"
