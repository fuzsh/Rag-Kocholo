        "text": "The paper focuses on three capitals, which are situated at three different locations in Montenegro. Comparing each one against two others, the authors have come to realize that all three pieces may be interconnected with respect to an interesting museological situation and some unique archaeological circumstances. The appearance of some morphologically striking relief motifs suggests that these artefacts should be viewed as parts of one architectural whole - an assumed, though still unexplored Early Christian church, possibly of triconch plan, in the Grbalj field, between the Bay of Kotor and Budva.\n\nThe title of this section consciously recalls that of the project currently running in Doclea for 2018-2020 (‘The Future of the Past: Study and Enhancement of Ancient Doclea, Montenegro’). The Authors focus their attention not only on extracting scientific knowledge and seeking the preservation of the site, but also on considering its future development and utilisation. The final goal is the design and completion of a sustainable plan for the relaunch of the site, in order to hand it back to its community as a tool for socio-cultural and economic growth. The rediscovery of the cultural identity of the territory and the collective memory of a community can give new life to past material culture and traditions, offering to visitors and inhabitants an integrated human experience of physical and mental well-being."
