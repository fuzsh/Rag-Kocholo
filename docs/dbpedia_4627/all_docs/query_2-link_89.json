        "text": "Committee for Collecting Data\n\non Crimes Committed Against Humanity and\n\nInternational Law\n\nBelgrade\n\nCRIMES OF GENOCIDE AGAINST SERBS IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF KONJIC (1992 - 1995)\n\nThe city of Konjic is situated to the southwest of Sarajevo (at a distance of 59 kilometers by road) and north of Mostar (71 kilometers away).\n\nAccording to the 1991 census the Municipality of Konjic had 43,878 inhabitants, of which number Muslims accounted for the largest percentage - 54.3%, Croats for 26.2 and Serbs for 15%.\n\nDuring the 20th century the population structure in the Municipality of Konjic was forcibly disrupted to the detriment of the Serbs: in 1914 after the assassination in Sarajevo, over one hundred of the most eminent Serbs were killed, and during World War II Serbs were the victims of mass genocide (223 were slaughtered, of which 205 in 1941 by the local Ustashi).\n\nDevelopments after World War II did not uphold the proclaimed national equality either: until 1991 fifteen mosques and five catholic churches had been built in the Municipality of Konjic and not a single Orthodox church; of the forty streets in Konjic only one bore the name of a Serb (the national hero Maksim Kujundžić); the names of streets, enterprises and institutions were written exclusively in the Latin script; monuments to victims fallen in World War II did not truthfully depict the nationality of the victims and the perpetrators of the crimes.\n\nGrowing nationalism threatened the survival of Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including in Konjic. Although guided by different motives and following different programmes, the Croats and the Muslims aligned with each other in the dismemberment of Yugoslavia. The Muslims sought to create of Bosnia and Herzegovina an independent state based on the ideas of Alija Izetbegović’s “Islamic Declaration” and the Croats aspired after annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia.\n\nThe Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA) was first established in Konjic and then the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and only then the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS).\n\nParallel with politically organizing themselves on a national basis, the Croats and Muslims also militarily organized and armed themselves.\n\nIn SDA’s activities in the region of Konjic aimed at establishing the Patriotic League as the military wing of the party, early in May 1991, the lead was taken by Jasmin Guska, head of the organizational unit in Konjic of the Ministry of the Interior, Šefko Nikšić, deputy head of public security in Konjic and Nijaz Salčin, head of logistics of the Ministry of the Interior in Konjic. Sefer Halilović, a former YPA officer, was among the principal organizers of the operation of the Patriotic League. Members of the Patriotic League were armed through the illegal procurement of weapons, in particular via Croatia.\n\nTowards the end of 1991 the Croats in the Municipality of Konjic set up the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). They formed two battalions and the HVO commander for Konjic was Ivica Azinović. The Croats armed themselves in an organized fashion through Croatia and the HVO also participated in the arming of Muslims.\n\nThe Croats and Muslims armed themselves also by stealing weapons and ammunition from the \"Igman\" factory in Konjic. The first theft occurred in December 1991, the second in the beginning of February 1992 and the third in late February or early March 1992. A large quantity of ammunition and over a thousand pieces of smaller caliber weapons were stolen. Among the principal organizers of the burglary was Fehim Čibo from Konjic who worked in the factory as an armorer on the proving ground.\n\nThe mass media were psychologically preparing the Muslims and Croats for a showdown with the Serbs, ever harping on the alleged threat coming from the Serbs, the \"Serbo-Chetnik peril”. Thus the reporter of Radio Konjic Stjepan Galić would say that “Serbo-Chetniks with a corrupt mind with pus oozing from their brains want to destroy the Muslims and the Croat people”, and similar formulations were also used by Ethem Badžak, a journalist of the \"Oslobodjenje\" and Ilija Šagolj, in charge of propaganda at the HVO, who openly called the Croats and Muslims to settle scores with the Serbs.\n\nAfter the war broke out, the Muslims and Croats in Konjic overtly committed crimes against the Serbs in an organized way with the objective of annihilating Serbs in the area. A particularly brutal killing campaign of Serbs took place in May 1992. During attacks on Serb villages (Bradina, Donje Selo, Blace and others), members of Muslim and Croat army units mass-killed Serbs who had not managed to escape. Throughout the area of the municipality Serbs were killed where they were found or were led away from their homes and killed or locked up in camps (Čelebići and Musala) in which they were also killed or subjected to humiliation and severe mental and physical torture often with a lethal outcome. Old men, women, children, the sick, the infirm, all were killed.\n\nA number of Serb civilians were slaughtered just like in the genocide during World War II.\n\nMujaheddin from Islamic countries who had joined Muslim army units also committed crimes against the Serbs.\n\nDespite the existence of data on mass genocidal crimes against the Serbs in the Municipality of Konjic, the proceedings before the Tribunal in The Hague have been reduced to only four perpetrators of crimes (Zejnil Delalić, Zdravko Mucić-Pavo, Hazim Delić and Esad Landžo called “Zenga”) and only for the killing of 13 Serbs in one camp.\n\n1.\n\nFollowing is a list with specific data about the mass killing of Serbs:\n\nAVRAMOVIĆ ČEDO, teacher of mathematics, from Čelebići, born on May 21, 1945 in Čelebići, father Ratko and mother Ikonija nee Lazarević, father of two children.

He was first held in custody at the Ministry of the Interior in Konjic and then at the end of May transferred to the Čelebići camp which is 200 metres away from his house. In the camp he was maltreated and beaten. Hazim Delić and Esad Landžo would take him out in front of “No.6” and beat him. He was in deep mental crisis. The actual cause of his death is unknown, possibly it was an electric shock. Witness 243/95-4 stated that in the morning when he woke up he saw that one of the cables that hung under the ceiling was loose and that Čedo was lying on the ground. He was naked to the waist and had a black spot in the region of the heart.(witnesses 380/94, 243/95-8, 100/94, 221/94-3/1, 283/94, 478/96-39, 375/97-2, 376/97-2).\n\nBABIĆ BRANKO, pensioner, from Bjelovčina near Konjic, born on May 24, 1926 in Bjelovčina, father Boža and mother Marija nee Savić, married, father of five children.

He was arrested on May 21, 1992 at his house by members of the Croato-Muslim army and with the other Serbs taken to the Čelebići camp. In the camp he was tortured in the most brutal way. Among other things a rifle barrel was rammed in his mouth. They placed him in hangar “No.6”. Witness 376/97-2 states that he was all black from the beating, that he had an open wound at the lower end of his spine, all of his teeth had been knocked out, the palate ruptured by a blow with a rifle barrel, arms and legs broken. He could neither speak nor eat nor drink. As he was in grave condition, five days later they transferred him to Konjic, to the “hospital for Chetniks” in the “3 maj” elementary school which also was a camp for Serbs. His wife (witness 412/94-18) stated that she had visited him and that her husband could not speak and was unconscious. His body was covered with bruises and his hands were full of blisters, obviously from burns, and his tongue and uvula were cut. He died on June 5, 1992 and the wife got the body on June 7, 1992 and buried him at the cemetery in Bjelovčina. According to the statements of camp inmates, he was beaten the most by Željko Mlikota from Seonica. Witness 357/97-2, who readied him for burial said that there had been visible traces of blows with a blunt object on the chest, that the left arm was crushed, teeth knocked out and the palate ruptured (witnesses 100/94, 236/94, 221/94-1, 380/94, 412/94-15, 478/96-39, 357/97-2, 375/977-2, 376/97-2.\n\nVUJIČIĆ VASO, nicknamed “KISA”, bachelor of law, worked as a market inspector at the Assembly of the Municipality of Konjic, from Bradina, Municipality of Konjic, born in 1958 in Bradina, Municipality of Konjic, father Petar and mother Jovanka, nee Djordjić, married, father of two minor children. When members of the Croato-Muslim army took Bradina, Vaso and the rest of the Serbs surrendered on May 26 1992 to them. They were driven off to the Čelebići camp. On the way to the camp, near Pero Mrkajić’s restaurant, he was taken out of the column with the brothers Živak (Slobodan and Velimir). They were led a hundred meters away in the direction of the Serbian church in Bradina and executed. Three days later his brother Dragan was arrested near Kalinovik with a group of Serbs trying to escape to the Serbian side and was killed en route to the Čelebići camp (evidence 478/96-40, 434/97-1, 361/97-2).\n\nVUJIČIĆ DRAGAN, electrician, haulier, from Bradina, Konjic Municipality, born on July 30, 1961 in the village of Bradina, Konjic Municipality, to father Petar and mother Jovanka, nee Djordjić, married, father of three children.

To end his misery he jumped out of the line and had not made three steps before he was gunned down from the back with an automatic rifle. He fell into the grass and a soldier approached him and shot him three times in the head with a pistol. The next day the Muslims brought his body to Bradina and photographed it \"manning\" an anti-aircraft machine gun, in order to \"prove\" that he had been killed in combat.
