The term ‘Montenegro’ (Black Mountain) always held a fascination for me, even before I was aware of its romantic history, the poetic works composed by Tennyson and Byron, the sweeping travelogues penned by Mary Edith Durham and Rebecca West, the anthropological studies of Christopher Boehm, or the works (both fiction and non-fiction) of Milovan Djilas. My own discovery has rather more modest roots, stemming back to seeing an article published in a 1977 edition of the National Geographic magazine (old copies a neighbour had deposited in our summer house while relocating in the late 1980s). The article, entitled ‘Yugoslavia’s Black Mountain’, vividly depicted political, cultural and social life in Montenegro. Temporarily transfixed, the fascination was fleeting and only re-emerged a decade later while I was reading for an MA in Politics and International Relations at the University of Aberdeen. By then, Yugoslavia had collapsed, and armed conflict in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later Kosovo, had scarred the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The entire Balkan region seemed to be lurching from one crisis to another. But, while much had been written about the larger Yugoslav republics, there was very little on the tiny republic of Montenegro. As I trawled through the plethora of books and newspaper articles on the Yugoslav crisis, it quickly became clear that Montenegro’s role in the process of disintegration was often limited to one or two paragraphs, even in the most detailed accounts. In an attempt to understand more clearly what had happened in Montenegro, I frantically scoured libraries for literature that would alleviate this nagging need. My endeavours led me to discover that both the city and university libraries had several short histories of Montenegro stacked away in their basements, some of which the public had not requested since before the Second World War. It was hardly an auspicious beginning, but it ignited an enthusiasm that would extend well beyond attempts simply to understand Montenegro’s contemporary history. Although I had little reason to believe it then, it was the beginning of a passion that would serve to change the direction of my life, and one that has never dampened subsequently. Montenegro is a small, multi-ethnic country in southeast Europe with a population of approximately 672,000. It shares international borders with Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo. The largest ethnic group are Montenegrins, followed by Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians, Muslims and smaller numbers of Croats and Roma. The predominant religion is Orthodox Christianity, followed by Islam and Catholicism. I visited the tiny\n\nix\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nrepublic for the first time shortly after the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and I was immediately enchanted. Montenegro has it all; from the beautiful Kotor Bay to the Zeta plains to the awe-inspiring Durmitor Mountain, it is a diverse and stunning landscape that offers an abundance of wonderful treasures. That picturesque trip from Herceg-Novi to the capital Podgorica had a significant impact upon me; something I had not experienced in other countries of the Balkan region. Little did I know then that I my life had changed forever and that I would travel that road and enjoy Montenegro’s beauty many more times. However beautiful Montenegro’s inanimate treasures, it was the animate aspect of the country that interested me most – the people, their history, and the complexity of their politics. I could scarcely have imagined, when I tentatively began this project, the political changes that would take place over the subsequent years, or that I would be fortunate enough to witness them. Montenegro became an independent state following a closely-contested referendum in May 2006. It had been independent before, recognized as such by the Congress of Berlin in 1878. A 40-year period of independence ended in 1918 when Montenegro was unified with Serbia following the Podgorica Assembly, before being incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929). Following the collapse of the Yugoslav state and the onset of war in 1941, a bitter civil war ensued, during which Montenegro was wracked with conflict. At the end of hostilities, it became a republic within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As that state collapsed in the early 1990s, Montenegro remained within the rump of Yugoslavia, known simply as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and then a looser federal structure dubbed simply Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, a bare majority of its citizens voted for independence. In short, Montenegro had passed through a series of transitions. This can be illustrated using a short, but effective, example. A person who was born in the Montenegro’s town of Cetinje in 1908, who had lived and eventually died there in 2008, would have lived through several wars, witnessed huge social upheavals and lived in six different states without leaving his or her place of birth. Yet, that individual would still have been born and died in an independent Montenegro. That so many transitions can happen within one lifespan is testament to Montenegro’s tumultuous modern history. It also helps to explain the historical ambiguities surrounding its identity and the (still ongoing) debates over nation and state in Montenegro. What Montenegro lacks in scale it makes up in beauty and in the complexity of its history and politics. In trying to understand the dynamics of Montenegrin history, society, political culture and the contested character of its identity, I benefited from lengthy discussions with individuals across the academic, cultural and political spectrum. There are too many to mention, but\n\nx\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nthe following have been an invaluable source of information: in Podgorica, Professor Milan Popović and Professor Srdjan Darmanović of the Faculty of Political Sciences, Dr Igor Lakić at the Faculty of Economics, Professor Šerbo Rastoder and Radojka Vukčević at the Faculty of Philosophy in Nikšić, Dr Dragiša Burzan and Ranko Krivokapić from the Social Democratic Party, Stanka Vučinić from the Liberal Party; Branko Lukovac of the Movement for an Independent European Montenegro; Miroslav Vlahović, Želidrag Nikčević and Budimir Alekšić from the Serbian People’s Party of Montenegro; Milka Mijović-Tadić, Miodrag Perović and Ivan Kern of Monitor magazine; Milorad Popović from the Montenegrin Association of Independent Writers, Marko Špadijer of Crnogorska matica, Koča Pavlović of Movement for Changes and the OBALA Production Company, and Irena Radović from the British embassy in Podgorica. Thanks must be extended to Bishop Luka of the Serbian Orthodox Church and Metropolitan Mihailo Dedeić of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in Cetinje. Thanks also to Boris Ristović at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Mission in Podgorica, and Nebojša Medojević of Movement for Changes for the correspondence. In Belgrade I enjoyed fruitful conversations with Aleksa Djilas, Miša Djurković, and with Aleksander Raković of the Serbian Orthodox Theological Faculty. Without the support of my friends and colleagues at the University of Stirling, the University of Aberdeen, and the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES), this project would never have come to fruition. Most importantly Dr Dejan Jović, my Ph.D. supervisor, has been a constant saviour and mentor. He knew instinctively when to encourage and when objectively to criticize. My PhD examiners, Dr Wendy Bracewell, Dr Florian Bieber, and Dr Eric Shaw provided me with valuable advice and guidance. Professor Martyn Rady, Dr Peter Siani-Davies and Dr Zoran Milutinović at SSEES have given me great encouragement, while Mr James Wyllie and Professor Grant Jordan at the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Aberdeen have always provided their support and advice. Dr Lester Crook, my commissioning editor at I.B.Tauris, showed great enthusiasm for this project and provided generous support and encouragement throughout the publication process. Liz Friend-Smith and Jayne Hill at I.B.Tauris and Jason Cohen at Oxford Publishing Services ensured that the publication process ran smoothly. Without the faith and generous financial support of the Carnegie Trust for Scotland, the Robert Nicol Trust, the Williamson Travel Trust, and the UCL Research Fund, this project would never have been completed. On my travels it has been my great fortune to spend time in the company of Her Majesty’s ambassador to Serbia and Montenegro, David Gowan, the UK’s first official ambassador to Montenegro, Kevin Lynne, Elizabeth\n\nxi\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nRoberts, Jason Gold at Getty Images, Tim Judah and Dr Peter Palmer – all know Montenegro well and gave me great encouragement throughout. I am equally indebted to my many friends in both Montenegro and Serbia. The famed (and genuine) Montenegrin hospitality is extended to everyone – all visitors. It frequently involves the early-morning ingestion of varying quantities of domača rakija (domestically distilled brandy) and ingesting excessive amounts of local produce. Research in Montenegro is not for those predisposed to refusing this kind of hospitality. For me it was never a problem, and I was lucky to meet many Montenegrins who treated me as a guest regardless of how much or how little they could afford. This book would not have existed had I never had the good fortune to meet Bojan Galić and his family (Snežana, Dalija, and in Sarajevo, Branko) or the Vičković and Sćepanović families (Bosa, Boba, Nena, Katarina and Uroš). They surpassed even the excesses of traditional Montenegrin hospitality and kindness. In Kotor, Dragan and Marijana Maslovar always made me welcome. In Podgorica, Tanja Stanišić and family, and Ivan and Susanna Vukčević were constant sources of knowledge. In Berane, thanks go to Bojana and Ana Živković and their family. In Belgrade, Uroš Todorović, Sonja Stojanović, Srdjan Stojanović and Miloš and Vanja Ković have provided great assistance. My greatest thanks, however, go to Ruud Peeten, without whom I would never have travelled through the Balkans as extensively or as inquisitively. My greatest debt is to my family, my mother and father, Anita, Lawrie, Jamie and Aidan. They invested faith – not to mention finance – in my education and encouraged me to follow my instincts even if, at times, they must have regarded my passion for this subject mildly unhealthy. During the latter stages of my writing, I received huge encouragement from wonderful Helen Oliver, a remarkable person who never wavered in her support for this work, patiently bearing the sacrifices that had to be made for it to be realized. I consider myself exceptionally fortunate to have her and my daughter, Hannah, in my life. Thanks also to Cherrie and Brian, Dennis and Janet, and the London-based branch of the Morrison clan (Bertha, Wilma and Lynne). In 2006, a one-year teaching post at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies allowed me to utilize the wealth of resources and expertise of staff and students there. As part of an academic exchange programme in 2007 I was then able to lecture to students at the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Belgrade. In London I enjoyed the great fortune of being surrounded by remarkable individuals who have played a significant role in the completion of this work. Dr Dejan Karadaglić, Luka and Andrej Mihailović, Novak Gajić, Petar Popović, Dr Milan Nikolić, Dr Bojan Aleksov and Dr Nick Endacott were true sources of inspiration. Writing this modern history of Montenegro was a rewarding, complex and, at times, frustrating task. Metaphorically speaking, the author is required to\n\nxii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n‘wear two hats’ or to ‘sit on two chairs’. The dilemma was thus: how does one write a text that would be consumable and enjoyable to the lay reader while of value to the academic community, policy-makers and regional experts? How does the author bridge the gap between scholarship and commercial viability? Will people in the region find it over-simplistic? Can one really do justice to modern history in such a short book? In attempting to juggle these elements, the final draft is a compromise in scale and content. This book could easily have been twice its final length. I have attempted to depict this period in Montenegro’s history as accurately as possible by drawing on a range of primary and secondary sources, including interviews with participants in some of the events depicted in the text and many of which I personally witnessed. Some historians, however, would argue that the witness – being subject to the emotive force of events – cannot possess the objectivity garnered by the cold distance of the passing of time. With this in mind, I have endeavoured to avoid the pitfalls of becoming overtly emotionally involved, and felt a strange sense of distance, even during the celebrations that followed the independence referendum. While I genuinely felt pleased for those who achieved their dream to reestablish a fully sovereign and independent state, I also felt empathy with those who wished to retain a joint state of Serbia and Montenegro. I sought to retain a sense of detachment and balance throughout. By doing so, I hoped to avoid the narrow subjectivity characteristic of much of what has been written about Montenegro. I have tried to represent the views of all sides, to represent a balanced and honest historical overview and it is my sincere hope that I have achieved that objective. Any oversights or deficiencies are entirely my own. Kenneth Morrison\n\nxiii\n\nMontenegro and the former Yugoslavia in 2006. (Maps reconstructed from Elizabeth Roberts, Realm of the Black Mountain: A History of Montenegro, Hurst & Company, London.)\n\nxiv\n\n1 Introduction: Nation, State and Identity The history of Montenegro is exceptionally complex and deserves meticulous scholarly research. I obviously cannot do justice to a broad yet concise history in a single text, so have framed the book in a specific temporal context and do not claim that it is a concise history. Although the opening chapters provide a broad historical overview, the main focus of the book is the period between the recognition of Montenegro’s independence following the Congress of Berlin in 1878 to the re-establishment of that independent status in 2006 (following a closely-fought referendum). I have made no attempt, for example, to discuss the differing scholarly approaches to the ethnogenesis of the Montenegrins, for they are covered in depth elsewhere.1 Thematically I focus on Montenegro’s role in broader Balkan and Yugoslav history and politics. More specifically, however, I focus on the internal dynamics of Montenegrin politics, Montenegro’s relationship with Serbia, and the interplay between two competing national traditions among Montenegrins – srpstvo (Serb-ness) and crnogorstvo (Montenegrinness). The essence of the former is that it emphasizes the Serb character of the Montenegrins, that they are an integral part of the Serbian national corpus. The latter questions this approach and emphasizes the right of Montenegrins to define themselves as a unique nation, not simply as a branch of the Serb nation. The friction between proponents of these two approaches has, at times, led to conflict among Montenegrins. Since the late nineteenth century questions of statehood, nationhood and national identity have dominated Montenegrin politics, and conflicting perceptions of them have been at the heart of Montenegrin political life since its formal recognition as an independent state in 1878. As a consequence, in this book I focus primarily, though not exclusively, on the Orthodox population of Montenegro. With questions of nationhood and statehood at the forefront, I analyse Montenegrin history from its establishment as an independent state in 1878 to the Montenegrin independence referendum of 2006. I place particular emphasis on events that have take place since 1989. The reason for this is\n\n1\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nsimple – the last 20 years of Montenegrin history have been fascinating and complex, yet there is little in-depth examination (particularly in English) of the dynamics of this period. Since 1989, Montenegro has witnessed the collapse of the Yugoslav state, the brutal wars that followed the collapse, two attempts to create a union of Serbia and Montenegro and, finally, the re-establishment of its status as a sovereign and independent state. Montenegro, unlike other Yugoslav republics, did not seek independence from Yugoslavia. Instead, it, along with Serbia, sought to preserve the existing Yugoslav federation. When it became clear that it was no longer possible to preserve the six-republic Yugoslavia, in 1992 Montenegro entered into a new federal state with Serbia – the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Unlike other Yugoslav states such as Croatia or Slovenia, Montenegro’s secession from Yugoslavia could never be straightforward. The problem with national identification – whether Montenegrins were a separate nation or essentially Serbs – lay at the root of the Montenegrin elite’s decision to remain within a federation with Serbia. But while there was consensus between ruling elites in Serbia and Montenegro between 1992 and 1997, the situation changed dramatically in 1997, when Montenegro’s monolithic Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) split into pro- and contra- Milošević factions. This split then quickly developed into a Serb versus Montenegrin dynamic – a struggle between two competing nationalisms. Between 1997 and 2006, the issue of whether it would remain federated with Serbia or seek independence dominated Montenegrin politics. While much has been written on other Yugoslav republics during this period, Montenegro (and the Montenegrin role in these processes) is often overlooked or reduced to one or two paragraphs. This, of course, cannot be said of the plethora of books by scholars in the Balkan region, but the lack of literature in English is striking. With this book I seek, if nothing else, to redress that imbalance. Although a modern history dealing with nation, state and identity, this book is also about how Montenegro’s leaders have used these themes to create and destroy states, or simply to further their own political agendas. From King Nikola’s attempts to forge a Serb state around the Piedmont of Cetinje to Milo Djukanović’s drive for independence in the early 2000s, Montenegrin leaders have utilized the national question to attain their political objectives and to further their own personal interests. The role and actions of Montenegro’s political elites is an additional theme of the book.\n\nThe Roots of the Ambiguity and Geographical Differentiations The question of Montenegrin national identity has been at the heart of Montenegrin politics since the late nineteenth century. There has never been a clear consensus. To ask ‘who exactly are the Montenegrins?’ may seem a\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION: NATION, STATE AND IDENTITY\n\nrudimentary question, but what can be attributed to the terms ‘Montenegro’ and ‘Montenegrins’? Are Montenegrins a branch of the Serbian nation or do they form a distinct and separate nation?2 Are they, as J. F. Brown inferred, ‘Serbs, or a strikingly similar variant thereof’?’3 That most authors writing on Montenegro tend to define them as Serbs is the crux of the problem and has inhibited serious study of Montenegro and Montenegrins. The ambiguity inherent in Montenegrin identity has dictated that historians and social scientists have disagreed (and continue to disagree) on the matter. According to Jozo Tomašević, writing in the mid-1950s, the question of whether Montenegrins formed a separate nation or were part of the Serbian nation remained open in the minds of many social scientists.4 And, so it remains today, even in the light of Montenegro’s newly-won independence. The process has evolved since Tomašević made his observation and, while a separate Montenegrin national identity has continued to develop, the problem remains acute.5 Why the ambiguity? Well, the answers can be found in the intertwined histories of Serbia and Montenegro and the shared experiences that forged their identities. The Serbs and Montenegrins are exceptionally close, and the casual observer would be hard pressed to identify significant differences between them. Indeed, both are, on a superficial level at least, effectively indistinguishable from one another, rendering it problematic to establish accurately the source of distinction between them.6 As Elizabeth Roberts noted in her extensive history of Montenegro, entitled Realm of the Black Mountain: Serbs and Montenegrins have much in common; in many respects their religious and cultural tradition is overlapping; they are the closest of peoples of the former Yugoslavia. And yet, other important aspects of the Montenegrin experience – history, geography and the persistence at least till very recently of a clan-based society with its own value system – have made Montenegrins different.7 Indeed, while Serbs and Montenegrins have much in common, one should remember that Montenegro’s history (despite many shared experiences, memories and myths) is quite different from that of Serbia. Testament to this is the different historical experiences that different areas of Montenegro witnessed. Following the Ottoman incursions into the Balkans in the late fourteenth century, Montenegro was effectively cut off from Serbia. Thus, before the nineteenth century, Montenegro, at least Stara Crnagora (Old Montenegro), was a territory inhabited by embattled tribes loosely led by vladikas (bishops). This area represented what would become the embryo of the Montenegrin state. Here, the inhabitants developed characteristics that differentiated them from their Serbian kin to the north; as a consequence, they tended to see themselves as Montenegrins in national terms. As Ivo\n\n3\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nBanac put it: ‘The native – intensely Montenegrin – tradition, which maintained the separate heritage of Dioclea/Zeta, permitted the Montenegrins to suffuse themselves in the genial warmth of self-being.’8 In the outlying areas (which were only incorporated into the Montenegrin state during the mid to late nineteenth century) Serb identity retained primacy. According to Banac, the populace of these areas was heavily influenced by ‘the Serbian tradition [which centred on] … a system of mnemonic devices by which the church continually admonished the Montenegrins to remember the glories of the Nemanjić state’.9 As will become apparent, people living in Cetinje (in Old Montenegro) had quite different experiences from those living in Berane (in northern Montenegro). John Allcock noted that identification with a specific Montenegrin identity was (and is) concentrated in the core area around Cetinje, with those on the periphery identifying predominantly with Serbian, Albanian or even Croatian identities. The spatial picture of identity in Montenegro is, he argues: rather like taking a photograph in which one object is held in sharp focus in the foreground. Although one is aware of a half-focused context in which the object stands, that context remains rather undefined. ‘Montenegro proper’ in this respect shades off into its subsequent territorial accretions which have had a weaker identification with Montenegro than with Serbia.10 Old Montenegro, a small area comprising four nahija (districts), was free from Ottoman incursions and in this space specific Montenegrin characteristics developed. In 1796 Old Montenegro was unified with the Brda (Mountains) and in these peripheral areas identification with Cetinje remained weak. The British anthropologist, Mary Edith Durham, in Some Tribal Origins, Laws and Customs of the Balkans, noted that the inhabitants of Old Montenegro and the Brda, while integrated into a single political territory, possessed distinct characteristics. She defined Old Montenegro as the territory around Cetinje with additions on the Hercegovinian side, and the Brda as the mountain mass that bordered Albania. She recognized that the inhabitants of the two regions were quite different and that there was some ambiguity about where overall political authority lay.11 Indeed, during the immediate period following the unification, establishment of effective state control in the Brda became a greater challenge to Cetinje than securing independence from Ottoman power.12 Thus, the inhabitants of the Brda (and other areas subsequently conjoined to Montenegro during the territorial expansions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries), entered an enlarged Montenegrin state as those who looked towards Belgrade and Serbia (as opposed to Cetinje and Montenegro) for spiritual and political leadership. For them, the unification of Serbia and Montenegro was uppermost.\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION: NATION, STATE AND IDENTITY\n\nWith territorial expansions in 1820, 1878 and 1912 (when part of the contemporary Sandžak region became an integral part of Montenegro) the country more than doubled in size. Once a tiny enclave, Montenegro became a country with a large number of minorities. After 1912, Montenegrin territory contained not only a large number of people who supported Serb– Montenegrin unification and considered Belgrade their spiritual and political centre, but also a large body of semi-hostile Muslims, many of whom were Albanians.13 While those residing around Cetinje may rightly have considered themselves ‘Montenegrin’, the same cannot be said for those who lived in the Montenegrin Sandžak, the Brda, or the Montenegrin areas of Herzegovina (many of whom were Muslim or considered themselves Serbs). Thus, we can see a complex demographic pattern emerge within a small territory, confirming Allcock’s thesis that Montenegrin identity has a spatial character. In contemporary Montenegro, these differentiations still exist. Northern Montenegro, for example, comprises what was traditionally known as the Brda, the Sandžak (Old Raška to the Serbs) and parts of Old Herzegovina. The Brda area is essentially populated by old Serb tribes (who retain a distinct Serb character), while the Montenegrin Sandžak and Old Herzegovina are more ethnically mixed, with significant Muslim populations.14 Many of Montenegro’s northern towns and villages contain largely Orthodox populations who, in terms of national self-identification, remain staunchly Serbian. Towns like Berane (known as Ivangrad between 1946 and 1992), a former industrial town on the Lim River, and Pljevlja, near the border with Republika Srpska (the Serb Republic within Bosnia & Herzegovina) remain strongholds of Serb identity. While there are historical reasons for these areas’ strong affiliation with Serbia, there are a number of factors pertaining to the conflict in neighbouring Bosnia & Herzegovina in the early 1990s to take into account. Montenegro’s northern municipalities became home to a number of Serb refugees who (given their experiences during the war) have a tendency to support proponents of Serb nationalism. Support for the continuation of political union between Serbia and Montenegro remains very strong here. The town of Andrijevica is a case in point. A small town with a small population, Andrijevica shares a border with Albania and is the heartland of the Upper Vasojevići tribe, which had historically been oriented towards Serbia. Following Montenegro’s declaration of independence from Serbia in 2006, the town’s Serb population called upon Belgrade to provide consular representation to the Serbs of Andrijevica.15 Situated on the Lim River, Berane was formerly a bustling industrial town in which the staunchly pro-Serb Lower Vasojevići tribe was predominant.16 Once considered one of the most developed industrial centres in Montenegro, its economic collapse in the late 1980s and the UN-imposed economic sanctions of the 1990s drastically affected it and, according to a recent OSCE\n\n5\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nreport, since then Berane has become ‘a lost place’.17 Refugees from the 1999 war in Kosovo compounded the town’s economic problems. Again, the refugees, who had been hardened by their experiences, were a contributory factor in the persistence of Serb nationalism and Serbian (as opposed to Montenegrin) identification there. Geographically, Berane only became part of Montenegro in 1878; its Orthodox population strongly identifies with Serbia and it has traditionally been a stronghold for Serb-oriented parties. The town was a hotbed of support for former Montenegrin president Momir Bulatović’s ‘Socialist People’s Party’ (SNP) following the DPS split in 1997 (see Chapter 9). Bulatović acknowledged Berane’s strong association with Serbia stating that, ‘they [the inhabitants of Berane] are closer to Serbia than Montenegro.’18 Relations between local authorities in Berane and the government in Podgorica have been strained since 1997. Local leaders argued that municipalities administered by Serb parties receive little in the way of aid from the Montenegrin government because Berane and other such northern municipalities were deemed ‘hostile territories’.19 To the northwest of Berane is the town of Bijelo Polje, Montenegro’s third largest city. Connected to Podgorica and Belgade by the Bar–Belgrade railway line, it is northern Montenegro’s business and administrative centre. The town, located within the Sandžak, was not nominally part of Montenegro until after the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. Its most significant historical monument is the Church of St Peter, which was built in the twelfth century (but turned into a mosque in the seventeenth, only to be restored to a place of Christian worship in 1912). Characteristic of a town with such a history, Bijelo Polje possesses a distinct Islamic character, which is absent in other Montenegrin Sandžak towns like Berane, Pljevlja or Andrijevica. Interethnic relations have been relatively stable in Bijelo Polje and this has been reflected in the voting patterns of the town’s citizens, who have tended to vote for multiethnic as opposed to ethnically-based parties. The town of Žabljak, on the lower slopes of Mount Durmitor (the highest peak in Montenegro), is in one of Montenegro’s least populated municipalities. Limited economic opportunities and a harsh climate dictate that the municipality retains a relatively small population – only 4206 permanent residents.20 The municipality is some distance from Montenegro’s administrative and historical centres (Podgorica and Cetinje) and has traditionally maintained close links with Serbia. The small town of Mojkovac is nestled between Kolašin and Bijelo Polje.21 The area around the town is known as the northern gateway into Montenegro and its strategic location has dictated that the town has borne witness to many battles, primarily during the Balkan Wars in 1912 and later during the First World War when Montenegrin forces held back the Austro-Hungarian Army, thereby facilitating the withdrawal of the Serbian Army from Andrijevica to Podgorica and on to Skadar.22 The town\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION: NATION, STATE AND IDENTITY\n\nbecame part of Montenegrin territory only in 1912, and during that period and beyond it was settled by Orthodox Serbs and Montenegrins. Muslims, fearing reprisals for their loyalty to the Ottoman Empire, departed. Again, Serb nationalist sentiment is strong here, yet interethnic relations have been historically stable. The situation in Pljevlja (close to the Serbian border) has been different. The town boasts a rather grim recent history of tensions between Orthodox and Muslim inhabitants. Pljevlja and a number of surrounding villages witnessed Serb paramilitary activity during the early 1990s (see Chapter 7). Generally, the Orthodox population regards itself first and foremost as Serb and support for pro-Serb parties has traditionally been strong. Pljevlja was incorporated into Montenegro in 1912, being formerly part of the region of Stara Herzegovina (Old Herzegovina). The Serbs of Pljevlja share many cultural characteristics with Herzegovinans in Republika Srpska, particularly with Trebinje, Foča (Srbinje to Bosnian Serbs) and surrounding villages in the eastern Herzegovina area. The municipality of Plav, close to the border with Kosovo and Albania, has three administrative centres – Plav, Murino and Gusinje. This area became part of Montenegrin territory in 1878, and its ethnic composition is distinctly different, with a much larger Muslim and Albanian population. Largely underdeveloped and in dire need of infrastructural improvement, the area around Plav (particularly the town of Murino) was damaged during the NATO bombings in 1999. Moreover, the area received an influx of refugees from Kosovo in 1998–99.23 During this period and beyond, the Plav region felt many intercommunal strains as a consequence of the conflict in Kosovo. In all the aforementioned northern municipalities (with the exception of Plav and Bijelo Polje), the majority of inhabitants voted to retain the union of Serbia and Montenegro during the 2006 referendum. The picture is very different in central Montenegro, in particular the core of Old Montenegro. By ‘central Montenegro’ we refer here not simply to Old Montenegro (Cetinje and its environs), but also to some of those areas formerly under Ottoman control, such as the contemporary capital, Podgorica and parts of Old Herzegovina, such as Montenegro’s second largest city Nikšić. Cetinje is the traditional seat of Old Montenegro and the nearby village of Njeguši was the birthplace of Petar II Petrović Njegoš. Cetinje was the capital of the independent state of Montenegro (1878–1918) and the seat of the Petrović dynasty. In 1918, when Montenegro was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Serbia essentially annexed Montenegro, the new authorities forbade the Montenegrin King, Nikola I Petrović (who had fled into exile in 1916), to return to Montenegro; all his property was confiscated. Being at the heart of the development of the Montenegrin state, the perception of Montenegrin\n\n7\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nseparateness has remained in Cetinje. While the town retains its rather rustic, underdeveloped feel, numerous former diplomatic residences and significant historical buildings such as King Nikola’s museum, the national archive, Cetinje monastery and the Njegoš mausoleum on nearby Lovćen, are testament to the town’s unique and complex history. Given its location as the seat of the Montenegrin ruling dynasty and the historic capital, Cetinje, the citizens generally posses a largely pro-Montenegrin and proindependence orientation. It was the birthplace and headquarters of the pro-independence party, the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro (LSCG). Nestling on the Zeta plain is Podgorica, Montenegro’s modern capital, administrative centre and largest city. The then small town became part of Montenegro in 1878, having formerly been a Turkish garrison. Complete devastation (largely due to Allied bombing raids in 1944) during the Second World War has left little of the remnants of its past. Only the old Turkish bridge and ‘Stara Varoš’ area remain of old Podgorica. The city was called ‘Titograd’ (after Josip Broz Tito) from 1945 to 1992 when the name Podgorica was restored.24 Podgorica is Montenegro’s only large urban centre and increasingly looks like a genuinely European capital (though Yugoslavs mocked it as the ugliest capital in former Yugoslavia). It has grown significantly since the Second World War. A search for better economic opportunities in the 1960s and 1970s led to rapid urbanization with many rural Montenegrins gravitating towards the capital. Many new estates such as Blok pet (Block 5), Blok šest (Block 6) and Zabjelo were built to accommodate the incomers. The city represents Montenegro in microcosm with a mixed population of Serbs, Montenegrins, Albanians (mainly in the Tuzi area) and Muslims. Reflecting this mix, the independence referendum was closely contested among the citizens of Podgorica. Nikšić, Montenegro’s second largest city, boasts the best beer in Montenegro – the excellent Nikšićko pivo – but it also enjoys the dubious (perhaps unfair) reputation of being a tough town. Misha Glenny famously referred to it as ‘one of the most primitive and violent towns in [former] Yugoslavia’.25 Nikšić is situated in Old Herzegovina and became part of the Montenegrin state in 1878. Fearing reprisals from an embittered Orthodox population, people began to leave the area, radically changing its demographics. Orthodox Montenegrins filled the vacuum, settling in the vacant homes of fleeing ‘Turks’.26 Given Nikšić’s history, the town’s citizens had a tradition of closeness with Serbia. The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) now administers the municipality. Nikšić is the birthplace of the current prime minister Milo Djukanović, and the town was a key battleground between the warring factions of the old DPS during the 1997 split within the party (see Chapter 9). Again, Nikšić was closely contested during the 2006 referendum.\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION: NATION, STATE AND IDENTITY\n\nThe differences are equally pronounced on the Montenegrin coast. Indeed, there is a stark distinction between some coastal regions and Montenegro’s hinterland. The coastal areas, particularly Boka Kotorska (the Bay of Kotor), have had very different historical experiences from ‘Old Montenegro’ or the Brda area. In the Bay of Kotor, there are very strong remnants of the Austrian and Venetian periods (and their related cultural influences). Kotor only became part of Montenegro in 1945. The area has a significant Croat and Catholic population and many Bokelji (residents of Boka) use Italian words mixed with the Ijekavski dialect of the hinterland. The unique cultural hybrid of the bay area finds its manifestation during ‘Bokeljska Noć’ (The Night of the Bokalese). The costumes and practices project a genuine Mediterranean culture very different from the hinterland of Montenegro. Given its Catholic population, Serb extremists targeted the area in the early 1990s (see Chapter 6). During this period, a significant number of Croats left Boka, driven out by Serbian propaganda that labelled them ‘Croatian fascists’ (Ustashas) intent on undermining Montenegro’s territorial integrity.27 Many of these Croats have now returned and a Croatian consulate has been established in Kotor. However, the tumultuous period during the breakup of the SFRY left a significant legacy on the Montenegrin coast. The influx of Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia (many of whom settled in the coastal towns of HercegNovi and Budva) altered the area’s demographic structure28 – not everybody welcomed these demographic shifts. Many of the residents of Boka felt threatened by the resurgence of Serbian nationalism in Montenegro during the late 1980s and the influx of (often embittered and volatile) Serb refugees from Bosnia did little to assuage their fears. These newcomers did not reflect the traditional multiethnic, multi-confessional character of the area.29 A case in point is the town of Herceg-Novi (only a few kilometres from the Croatian border), which retains a distinctly Serbian flavour – largely due to the influx of Serbian refugees from Bosnia and Croatia. Many signs above shops and cafés are written in the Cyrillic script (as opposed to the Latin script which is predominant along most of the Montenegrin coast). Thus, most Montenegrins regard Herceg-Novi as a Serbian enclave on the Montenegrin coast. In a controversial article published in Slobodna Bosna (Free Bosnia) in January 2005, Montenegrin journalist, Andrej Nikolaidis, described Herceg-Novi as a town of ‘Radovan Karadžić sympathizers and Slobodan Milošević supporters’, much to the disdain of many of the town’s residents, who voted overwhelmingly to retain the state union in May 2006.30 The southern coastal areas experienced fewer demographic shifts than the region around the Bay of Kotor. The town of Bar, for example, escaped the worst excesses of nationalist sentiment in the early 1990s. Bar has a mixed population of Montenegrins, Serbs and Albanians, and contains the\n\n9\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nimpressive ruins of the Roman settlement of Stari Bar (Old Bar) and Montenegro’s largest port. It is located at the foot of Mount Rumija – a place of pilgrimage for adherents to the Orthodox, Catholic and Muslim faiths. Controversially, in July 2005 the Serbian Orthodox Church placed a small tin church on the peak of Mount Rumija, which worsened interfaith relations. Further south, the town of Ulcinj has a uniquely Albanian flavour. It is home to a significant Albanian majority and the plethora of mosques is a testament to the town’s Islamic character. Ulcinj did not become part of Montenegrin territory until 1880 – two years after the Congress of Berlin (the ‘Ulcinj Question’ remained open for a two-year period until it joined Montenegro). Support for independence from Serbia was strong in both Bar and Ulcinj. Taking into account these geographical factors, we can see that Montenegro is a complex geographical, demographic, ethnic and cultural space. Historical factors have dictated that these areas entered the Montenegrin state at different times and identities and loyalties were developed prior to their incorporation into the Montenegrin state.\n\nThe Question of Identity in the Contemporary Context Fundamentally, the study of the nation raises numerous theoretical, historical and empirical dilemmas. Strict categorization of the substance of a given nation is highly problematic, and in the Montenegrin case (given the blurring between Serb and Montenegrin identity) even more so. As Ičević notes, ‘it is particularly [difficult] to find a reliable theoretical and methodological framework for defining the Montenegrin nation because of the contradictory attitudes to its existence, development and individuality.’31 Indeed, problems with clear definition are further compounded by an inextricably linked history (with Serbia), interrelated ruling dynasties, significant Montenegrin migration to Serbia, not to mention a large number of Montenegrins (until recently) seeing no contradiction in defining themselves as both Serb and Montenegrin. The root of the problem stems, according to Montenegrin political analyst, Milan Popović: From at least two centuries of long-lasting and extremely contradictory statebuilding processes. Independent Montenegro or Montenegro as part of some greater state (Greater Serbia, Yugoslavia), these two–three state ideas have been the two– three principle and sometimes warring alternatives of modern Montenegrin history. Double identity imprinted on the mass consciousness of most Montenegrins has been a contradictory but logical result of these competing and confronting state ideas.32 Such contradictory processes have led to the development of a phenomenon Srdjan Darmanović terms, a national homo duplex, a dual or double\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION: NATION, STATE AND IDENTITY\n\nidentity consciousness.33 Thus, the issues of nationhood and statehood have remained at the heart of Montenegrin politics throughout the twentieth century. Historical and political factors have dictated that Montenegrin identity possesses ambiguous characteristics that are open to interpretation. Previous census figures (from 1971 to 1991) indicate that the vast majority define themselves as Montenegrins, and the majority who defined themselves as such did so because they were citizens of the Montenegrin Socialist Republic (within the SFRY). This was misleading, however. These ‘Montenegrins’ were not a homogenous group. Many considered themselves Montenegrin and Yugoslav, or Montenegrin and Serb, or simply Montenegrin. Bound up within this large percentage of Montenegrins were individuals who had been brought up on the dialogue between Serb, Montenegrin and Yugoslav. But while in the past many Serbs in Montenegro would have simultaneously defined themselves as Montenegrins (and saw no contradiction in doing so), by 2003 the situation was quite different. What has occurred to affect this change can be understood, not by seeking to understand a crystallizing process with regard to the identity of the Montenegrins but as a result of the shifting policies of Montenegro’s ruling elite vis-à-vis Serbia. While one should not completely disregard a longer-term process of consolidation of a specific Montenegrin identity, frequent changes of ideological legitimation by the ruling Montenegrin elite have been a key factor in that consolidation. Nevertheless, we can see a bifurcation between those who define themselves as Serbs and those who define themselves as ‘Montenegrin’. Census figures from 2003 indicated that the large group simply defined themselves as Montenegrins in the previous census of 1991 – Serb or Montenegrin, not Serb and Montenegrin (citizens were given no opportunity to define themselves as both). Increasingly, the term ‘Montenegrin’ no longer implies a wider Serbian identity. Figure 1.1: Montenegrin Census Results 1971–1991\n\nSerbian (percentage) Montenegrin (percentage)\n\n1971\n\n1981\n\n1991\n\n07.5 67.2\n\n03.3 68.5\n\n13.5 84.2\n\nSource: Stanovništvo 1971–1991 Godine Prema Narodnosti po opština, Monstat, Podgorica, 2004.\n\nWe can, then, clearly see a radical departure from this trend in the 2003 census, and this new pattern is clearly demonstrated by these figures, according to which 40.5 per cent of Montenegro’s inhabitants define\n\n11\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nthemselves Montenegrin by nationality, while 30.3 per cent defined themselves as Serbs.34 Figure 1.2: Results of Montenegrin Census 2003 Nationality\n\nNumber\n\nPercentage of Population\n\nMontenegrin Serbian Bosniak Albanian Muslim Croat Roma Others Did not declare No data\n\n273.366 201.892 063.272 047.682 028.714 007.062 002.875 008.367 027.715 010.532\n\n40.5 30.3 09.4 07.1 04.3 01.1 00.4 01.2 04.1 01.6\n\nSource: ‘Rezultati popisa u Crnoj Gori’, Monstat, December 2003.\n\nThus, in contemporary Montenegro (and particularly in the years preceding the independence referendum in May 2006), the politicization of the identity question (one inextricably linked with the independence project) dictated that individuals must broadly choose between two diametrically opposed camps possessing two competing perceptions of Montenegro and Montenegrins. But politics is at the heart of this change. Whether a member of any family defines themselves as Serb or Montenegrin depends upon social, cultural, economic, and (above all) political, circumstances.35 More problematically, however, there are also a significant number within Montenegrin society who are either undecided or resent having to renounce aspects they regard as integral components of their identity. The increasing bifurcation was not simply something that existed in the abstract – it had very real manifestations in Montenegrin social life, even within the family unit. It was (and is) possible to meet one brother defining himself as Serb and the other as Montenegrin.36 Yet, again, this was more indicative of a political stance of pro or contra independence. The situation now mirrors what has happened in the past – between supporters and opponents of unification in 1918 and between Partisan, Green and Chetnik in the 1940s. Intergenerational splits, interfamily splits – these divisions are a source of bewilderment for foreign observers and analysts, but they are neither novel nor indicative of a crystallizing process – they are driven primarily by politics, both now and in the past. Furthermore, it\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION: NATION, STATE AND IDENTITY\n\nis a process that is constantly evolving. In the following analysis of Montenegro’s modern history I aim to shed light on the complex processes that have shaped its history, its people and their political culture.\n\n13\n\n2 Empires, Entities and Statebuilders: A Brief Historical Overview Although I recognize the usefulness of a detailed historical analysis that would facilitate a better understanding of contemporary events, a brief interpretation of Montenegrin history from the Roman period onward will have to suffice.1 The history of the geographical region that is now called Montenegro can be traced back to 700 BC, although little is known about the Illyrian inhabitants of the area until the development of the Roman colonial outpost of Dioclea (Duklja) during the first century AD. This province remained under Roman control until AD 395, whereupon the Roman Empire was divided between Rome and Constantinople, which put the Balkan region on the faultline between two powerful forces. In the sixth century, large migrations of Slavs arrived in the Balkans and, according to British historian Francis Seymour Stephenson, Byzantine Emperor Heraclius encouraged them to migrate because he wished to ‘erect a durable bulwark against any who should attempt to penetrate from the north-east’.2 According to Montenegrin historian, Živko Andrijašević, ‘One of the Slavic peoples settling on the Balkan Peninsula at the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh century were the Montenegrins.’3 Settling in the area of the former Roman colony, the Montenegrins, according to Andrijašević, became known as the ‘Dukljani’, and were recognized as separate from other Slavic groups: In his work De Administando Imperio, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (905–59) refers to the Montenegrins as Docleans, explaining that their name derived from the fact that they had settled in areas around the Roman town of Doclea. As Constantine Porphyrogenitus did not supply any data about the ethnic origin of the Docleans, it may be assumed that he viewed them as a separate ethnic group, just like Serbs or Croats. … Constantine Porphyrogenitus may not have known the real ethnic origin of the Docleans, but he obviously did not regard them as Serbs or Croats.4\n\n14\n\nEMPIRES, ENTITIES, AND STATE-BUILDERS\n\nA number of Serbian, Serb-Montenegrin and Western authors, however, challenge Andrijašević’s assertion that the Montenegrins were ethnically distinct from the Serbs. Fleming, for example, simply refers to the arriving Slavs as two groups, ‘virtually identical in language and customs. The Antes, who have been plausibly identified as the Slavic ancestors of the modern Bulgarians, and the Sclaveni, who formed the Slavic substratum of most of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia’.5 By the Middle Ages, however, these Slav migrants had created a number of proto-states, one of which was Zeta (renamed from Duklja by the Byzantines). Essentially a vassal state of Byzantium, Zeta emerged as a power in its own right, even becoming a centre for resistance to Byzantium. Until his death in the early eleventh century, its leader, Jovan Vladimir, toiled to retain Zeta’s independence. During the power struggle that followed his death, Vojislav emerged as the new ruler of Zeta. Territorial expansion and rebellion against the Byzantine Empire were constant features of his control. The Vojislavjevići – which Montenegrin historian Šerbo Rastoder refers to as the ‘first Montenegrin dynasty’ – began Zeta’s quest for independence from Byzantian rule.6 Vojislav’s successors, Mihailo and Bodin, sought to reconcile with Byzantium but with little tangible success. By 1077, Mihailo had successfully appealed to Rome for formal recognition of Zeta and the archbishopric of Bar was established. The Vojislavevići reigned supreme until Bodin’s death in 1101; when their power began to wane in the late twelfth century, civil war and internal power struggles ensued. The Nemanjić dynasty took advantage of the political anarchy that followed the disintegration of the Vojislavljević power base. The rise of the Nemanjić dynasty ended the 173-year-long period of Zeta’s independence, during which a state, Church and culture dominated by Western influence had been created.7 Montenegro was now under the control of the Nemanjić dynasty (1189– 1360). Born in what is now Montenegro, Stefan Nemanja was the founder of the Serbian royal dynasty and began the Serbian tradition of building churches and monasteries. Zeta, however, enjoyed a unique status (a kind of sub-state within a state), best demonstrated by the predominance of Catholicism, although increasingly the Orthodox Church made inroads into this preexisting religious composition. The youngest Nemanja son, however, made a significant impact on the ecclesiastical orientation of Zeta when, in 1219, Rastko (known in orthodoxy as St Sava), established the Serbian Orthodox Church and introduced the Orthodox rite, while simultaneously building churches and monasteries. This ensured that tangible evidence of the Serbian state remained throughout the period of Turkish rule and that the Nemanja dynasty maintained a degree of immortality. Stefan Nemanja’s influence was such that he came to be known as the ‘Holy Root’ – his successors being dubbed ‘saplings’ or ‘offsprings’ of the holy root. The psychological effect\n\n15\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nthat the proliferation of myths and symbols had on the people of the Serbian kingdom (including Zeta) was significant. Many believed that the Nemanjas were the chosen rulers and they the chosen people. As Serbian historian, Miloš Blagojević, noted: Thus, God had ordained that Nemanja’s ancestors, he himself, and subsequently his heirs, should sovereignly rule the ‘Serbian Lands’. They should take care of the ‘flock’ entrusted to them i.e. of the Serbian people, defend it and keep all evils away from it, as well as keep it together. All these [ideas] largely influenced the feeling of belonging to a common ethnic group – the Serbian nation.8 In 1331, with the accession to the throne of Dušan Silni (Dušan the Mighty), the Serbian state began a period of rapid expansion. By the 1340s, capitalizing on the weakness of the Byzantine Empire, Dušan’s state comprised the territories of Macedonia, Albania, Epirus and Thessaly.9 The expansions brought only short-term gains. Following his death in 1355, the Serbian kingdom entered a period of uncertainty as the Ottoman Empire began its advance into Europe. His son, known as Uroš V, could do little to stem the threat from the south and gradually lost control of the peripheral territories, including Zeta. Chaos reigned in Zeta, where the Venetians and opposing nobles tested the Balšićs’ emerging power. The Balšić dynasty emerged at a time of great crisis in the Balkans. In 1371, the Turks heavily defeated the Serbs at the battle on the Marica and the Macedonian lands subsequently fell to the Turkish forces. A cathartic battle then took place on 28 June 1389 at Kosovo Polje. The Serbian army led by Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović faced the might of the Turkish army under the command of Sultan Murat I. The legend of what followed has become fused into the Serbian, and by extension Montenegrin, national psyche. The Battle of Kosovo dictated the separation of Serbian and Zetan histories at this juncture. The Zetans were isolated but independent, largely due to a number of shortlived alliances that facilitated the retention of this independence.10 In the wake of the Battle of Kosovo, then, the Ottoman tide engulfed not only Serbia, but much of the Balkan Peninsula. Many Serbs fled their Turkish overlords, settling in the relative safety of Zeta’s mountain bastions, scratching a meagre subsistence from the rocky and infertile land, and frequently engaging in armed conflict with Turkish soldiers, a state of living Boehm described as a ‘refuge-warrior lifestyle’.11 After the male line of the Balšić’s became extinct in 1422, a short period of turmoil followed before the emergence of a new ruling dynasty. A tribal chieftain named Stefan Crnojević founded it during the collapse of the Serbian empire. Crucially (despite having less territory than either Zeta or Duklja), throughout the era of Crnojević rule Montenegro remained inde-\n\n16\n\nEMPIRES, ENTITIES, AND STATE-BUILDERS\n\npendent, consolidating its previously fractured and inconsistent tradition of sovereignty. Stefan, whom Venice supported, was said to have fought more than fifty battles with the Turks, all of which ended with a Turkish retreat. His reputation on the battlefield was fearsome and his people named him the Vojvoda (Duke) of Zeta. Stefan’s son Ivan succeeded him in 1465. Like his father, Ivan sought the protection of Venice, but almost immediately became unpopular with the Ottoman authorities for helping the Venetians resist the Turkish onslaught on Scutari. But their inability to rein in Montenegro’s tribes hampered the Crnojević dynasty. These tribes were regarded as the primary military, political and moral collective that controlled its members, and thus the main source of power was with the tribal chiefs.12 Their influence was hard to supersede. Leaders of individual tribes would often disregard the ruler’s authority, choosing instead to act autonomously in the interests of the tribe alone. Attempts to bring them to heel often led to bloodshed, and the near impossible task of doing so became the bane of Montenegro’s leaders for centuries. Nevertheless, the Crnojevićs stubbornly continued to resist the Turkish onslaught, but by 1482 this resistance was all but broken. Aware of the might of the Turkish armies, and understanding the geostrategic weakness of the then capital Žabljak, Ivan Crnojević deserted the town, establishing a new base in the shadow of Mount Lovćen. The town of Cetinje, which would become the Montenegrin capital until the early twentieth century, emerged. While Cetinje represented a safer strategic settlement, the Montenegrins were deprived of the fertile plains of Lake Scutari (Skadar) and were cut off from the coast. Surrounded by enemies and scratching a meagre subsistence from the barren and rocky environment, their destiny for almost four centuries was to wage incessant warfare against the Turks.13 The last Crnojević (Djurad) relinquished his home for Venice when the Porte in Constantinople discovered his collusion with Catholic countries (which he had been trying to persuade to unite in uprising against the Porte). In the light of these revelations, Djurad was given a choice – come to Constantinople to face the charges levelled against him or leave Montenegro immediately.14 He chose the latter. After Djurad Crnojević fled, Montenegro submitted to Ottoman pressure and was, according to Rastoder, ‘adjoined to the countries of the Ottoman empire as a separate region under the Bey of Skadar and Sandžak, in whose name a subaša (sub-pasha) governed Montenegro’.15 Montenegro was formally incorporated into the Ottoman-dominated Sanjakat of Scutari in 1496. The structures of the Crnojević dynasty were abolished and dismantled, but Turkish authority was severely tested and resistance was significant from the outset.16 Montenegrin life became dominated by tribal cohabitation, which persevered until the introduction of theocracy and the subsequent rule of the Petrović dynasty. Thus, it was during this period that Montenegro’s tribal structure consolidated, a system that was\n\n17\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nto remain the fabric of society for centuries to come. Surrounded by enemies, Montenegro’s position was precarious. According to Allcock, the Montenegro of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was, ‘[a] small landlocked protostate … sustained precariously in an area centred on Mount Lovćen and barely 40 kilometres across at its widest point – the size of a modest English county. This period was characterized by almost constant war with the Ottomans.’17\n\nThe Age of the Vladikas and the Unification of the Tribes Wider political circumstances would dictate that Montenegrin tribes would have to unite if they were to avoid outright domination by the Turks. During the War of the Holy League, Montenegrins openly supported and collaborated with Venice’s attempts to push back the borders of the Ottoman Empire. But this move proved counterproductive and foreshadowed a huge Ottoman invasion during which Cetinje was occupied and its monastery destroyed.18 These events also, however had a galvanizing effect. During the sixteenth century the vladikes (bishops) of the Cetinje Metropolitanate began to exercise greater authority in Montenegro. For the next three centuries, Montenegro became, in essence, a theocracy, with temporal and ecclesiastical authority vested in the vladikas.19 The vladikas were elected by the tribal skupština (assembly) and drawn from exemplary families within various tribes. From the fifteenth century onward, they represented the main focal point of resistance to the Turks. In 1697, with the election of Danilo I, the succession was restricted to within the Petrovići (the Petrović clan) and remained so until 1918 (with the exception of short periods of rule by the ‘false Tsar’ Šćepan Mali – Stephen the Small – and Arsenije Plamenac). As Orthodox bishops were forbidden to have children and could not provide heirs, the office was passed from uncle to nephew or great-nephew. The first of this lineage, Danilo I Petrović, began the process of state-building that his successors would further consolidate. He established Montenegro’s first code of law (known as Danilo’s code) and a court to arbitrate in legal matters. Danilo, like his predecessors, would struggle to unite the tribes. Montenegro’s social organization throughout this period was characterized by the predominance of the tribal system, one that had evolved and consolidated as Montenegrins, fearing occupation and forced subservience, began to inhabit the harsh, mountainous areas. Tomasevich, for example, noted that: because of the forbidding landscape, the utter poverty in arable land and other resources, its isolation from the lines of communication and the currents of civilization, and the fact that the Turks, after the conquest, controlled the plains and the lines of inland communication, the social and economic life of the country developed thereafter along very primitive lines. In these [Montenegrin] areas, more\n\n18\n\nEMPIRES, ENTITIES, AND STATE-BUILDERS\n\nthan in any other South Slav area, the tribal forces reasserted themselves after the Turkish conquest.20 Tribes were largely formed in the mid- to late-fifteenth century and the initial decades of the sixteenth century, and they organized along territorial lines comprising self-governing communities within a geographical and economic framework.21 The central characteristic of Montenegrin socio-political organization was the pleme (tribe), a typical pleme composed of various bratstvos (clans). By extension, the Montenegrin clan was composed of all males who descended from the same male ancestor and all members of a clan shared the same surname.22 These clans were often relatively isolated from one another; Montenegro, as with much of the rest of the Balkan Peninsula, is mountainous, which made for problematic communications between populated enclaves, which fragmented and compartmentalized communities. This, and the lack of centralized authority, essentially dictated that tribal identification remained the primary source of identity. According to Boehm, ‘In Montenegro, the relationships which normally identify the individual with the nation were almost wholly provided by the tribe.’23 The renowned Serbian ethnographer, Jovan Cvijić, divided the tribes of Montenegro into two distinct groups: ‘Old Montenegrin’ tribes and the tribes of the Brda (Hills).24 Concentrated in the northeast of the Zeta River and consisting predominantly of Serbian tribes who fled Ottoman occupation, the Brda tribes only became incorporated into Montenegro following the battles against the Turks at Martinići and Kruši in 1796. The Old Montenegrin tribes were organized into five (though this was later reduced to four) territorial units known as nahija (a term borrowed from Ottoman administrative terminology, used to refer to specific territories) – Katunska nahija, Lješanska nahija, Pješivci nahija (later incorporated into Katunska nahija), Rijeka nahija, and Crmnička nahija. Among these were a significant number of clans, which were often in conflict. The tribes were often ‘in blood’ with one another, with intertribal conflicts and lengthy blood feuds (krvna osveta) commonplace. In his boyhood memoirs Besudna zemlja (Land without Justice), Milovan Djilas succinctly described the character of the blood feud and the cycles of vengeance that subsequently resulted. Although written in the twentieth century, it powerfully articulates the essence of the psychology of the blood feud: Vengeance – this is a breath of life one shares from the cradle with one’s fellow clansmen, in both good fortune and bad, vengeance from eternity. Vengeance was the debt we paid for the love and sacrifice our forebears and fellow clansmen bore for us. It was the defence of our honour and good name, and the guarantee of our maidens. It was our pride before others; our blood was not water that anyone could spill. It was, moreover, our pastures and springs – more beautiful than anyone else’s – our family\n\n19\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nfeasts and births. It was the glow in our eyes, the flame in our cheeks, the pounding in our temples, the word that turned to stone in our throats on our hearing that our blood had been shed. It was the sacred task transmitted in the hour of death to those who had just been conceived in our blood. It was centuries of manly pride and heroism, survival, a mother’s milk and a sister’s vow, bereaved parents and children in black, joy and songs turned into silence and wailing. It was all, all.25 Mitigating the destructive blood feuds and uniting the tribes became the vladikas’ core objective. Despite attempts to centralize authority – vested in a central government in Cetinje – their limitations were apparent. They experienced significant difficulties while attempting to collect taxes from the local knezes (tribal leaders) and seemed incapable of stemming the destructive cycle of krvna osveta.26 While there was a certain level of cooperation between tribes, these alliances were frequently based on narrow self interest and had little to do with any sense of national cohesion, solidarity or national identity.27 A weak central government did not easily usurp tribal authority and, while there was unity and cooperation of sorts, many of the tribes continued conflicts with those with whom they had a grievance. Thus the tradition of feuding continued in spite of the best efforts of the vladikas. Prior to the ascension to power of the first of the Petrović dynasty, Petar I Petrović, tribal divisions had hampered the implementation of any form of centralized authority. The effect was twofold. First, the lack of intertribal cohesion weakened Montenegro in its struggle with the Turks (creating the conditions for the Ottoman Army to launch attacks, as in 1785, when Mahmud Pasha Bušatlija ravaged Montenegro). Second, failed attempts to create a centralized system of authority dictated that Montenegro remained backward, tribal and parochial. Creating cohesion among the tribes was fraught with difficulty, and unity between them was often non-existent, but their constant struggles against the Ottoman Empire did, however, give them reason to unite. After all, they all had a common interest in the removal of Turkish authority from the region. Galvanizing this anti-Turkish sentiment would require significant effort, but it would bring great rewards. As a consequence the pillars of a nascent state would evolve and flourish. Petar I Petrović would have marked success in bringing Montenegro’s tribes together, furthering internal organization and raising Montenegro’s profile internationally. In his Poslanice (Appeals) to the tribal leaders, he urged them to stop internal conflicts, end intertribal bloodshed and endeavour to work in harmony to defeat the Ottomans28 These appeals found manifestation in the form of the Assembly of Cetinje, held in 1787, where Petar successfully united the Old Montenegrin tribes against the Ottoman enemy. The consolidation of tribal unity brought tangible benefits. Montenegro gained territory and prestige by defeating the Ottoman army at Martinici–\n\n20\n\nEMPIRES, ENTITIES, AND STATE-BUILDERS\n\nKrusi (near Podgorica) in 1796. Following the battle, in 1796, the Brda became part of Montenegrin territory, bringing more tribes under the ‘control’ of the Vladika. Many of these tribes were settled on contested territory and, although as Christians they were frequently engaged in conflict with the Turks, their loyalties fluctuated, fighting with Old Montenegrin tribes when it suited them, but swiftly revolting if attempts were made by Cetinje to tax them. Identification with Serbia was strong in many of these areas largely due to the legacy of monastery building by the Serbian rulers Stefan and Vuk Nemanja during the zenith of the Serbian empire in the twelfth century. Eight large tribes populated the Brda region – Bjelopavlići, Piperi, Kuči, Bratonozići, Donja (lower) Morača, Gornja (upper) Morača, Rovčani and Vasojevići.29 Most of the Brda tribes were incorporated into Montenegro in 1796, with the Rovcani and the Donja Morača and Gornja Morača tribes being incorporated only after the defeat of the Turkish army at the Morača River in 1820. The Vasojevići were incorporate even later, in 1858.30 The area was noted for producing two key leaders of the first and second Serbian revolutions of 1804 and 1813 – Petar Karadjordje-Petrović (Black George) from the Vasojevići clan and Miloš Obrenović from the Bratonozići clan. Tomasevich noted that to consolidate the Montenegrin state effectively, its leaders had to impose ‘a governmental framework over the tribal structures, and regular levying of taxes which proved to be a long and hard task requiring, occasionally, the use of the sword’.31 To incorporate the new tribes successfully and to impose authority throughout Montenegrin territory, greater centralization was essential. In the period immediately following the Montenegrin victories at Martinići-Kruši, Vladika Petar began to create a new form of state organization by introducing, in 1796, the first written law in Montenegro. But 1796 also marked the advent of Montenegro’s close relationship with Russia. Following the battle, Russia chose unilaterally to recognize Montenegro as a de facto independent state.32 Thereafter, Petar I continued to consolidate the organs of a nascent state. This often required acts of violence as well as providing incentives. In 1821, Petar created his personal guard, known as the Perjanik. Drawn from the most influential tribes, they became the vanguard of his state-building project. Ruthless when required, they helped to pave the way for the consolidation of the state. Petar I Petrović died in 1830 at the age of 81. His legacy cannot be under estimated. Vladika Petar oversaw an important transitional period for Montenegro – military victories against the Turks, increasing levels of centralism and successes in attempting to unite the tribes under a single authority.\n\nPeter II Petrović Njegoš Petar I Petrović’s successor, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, was instrumental in further uniting the Montenegrin tribes, forging the structures of the state, and\n\n21\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nsetting in motion events that would lead to Montenegro’s independence in 1878.33 Born between 1811 and 1813 in the village of Njeguši in Montenegro, Njegoš (at birth Radivoje Tomov Petrović) hailed from the proud and militant Njeguši clan, one of the most active in the bastion of Old Montenegro. The tribes of the Katunska nahija were militant and fiercely independent. While many of the tribes resisted the Turks, many, acting out of naked self-interest, would return to the Turkish sway intermittently. Such deeds were unthinkable for the Katuni and, according to Djilas, were consumed by their mission to rid Montenegro of their Ottoman oppressors: The Katuni nurtured a spiritual implacability toward the Turks. They did not clash with the Turks for solely transient causes – high taxes or acts of violence. They were a different, opposite world – another conception of the world and of life. In their craggy heights, bleached by sun and storm and bereft of everything that the body needs, ceaseless struggle with the Turks was not only a way of life, but a cult. They not only believed in the myths of their religion and nationality; they lived by them.34 It was into this social context that Radivoje (Rade) Tomov Petrović was born. His destiny was not quite preordained, however, and, as Petar I Petrović’s health deteriorated, he was not the first choice for the position of Vladika. Years before his death, his nephew, Mitar Stijepov, had been the original choice to succeed him, though he fell ill while studying in Russia and passed away in the unfamiliar cold climate. Then, in 1823, Djordje Savov Petrović was chosen to become Petar’s successor and was dispatched, like Mitar, to receive an education in Russia. But Djordje, an ambitious and adventurous character, was unsuited to the religious path and, in 1829, a year before Petar’s death, enrolled in military school. Rade stood next in line. Born into a leading family within the Katunska nahija (one that had produced many leaders spanning several generations in the tiny area of Old Montenegro), he quickly became acquainted with the power and authority vested in his tribe. Unlike most Montenegrins of the period, Rade, as a young man, received an education, albeit an unconventional one. He was tutored and nurtured by the self-educated and eccentric poet, Sima Milutinović Sarajlilja, who gave him an education without any of the traditional, organized or approved methods of learning.35 Irregular though it may have seemed, it somehow provided him with a sound preparation for the challenges that lay ahead. On Petar I Petrović’s death in 1830, Rade inherited his uncle’s title as head of the church and state. Consecrated under the name of Peter II PetrovićNjegoš, he was to continue the reforms his uncle had set in motion, becoming in the process eminent as a statesman, reformer, warrior (despite an early military disaster) and poet.36 But he faced opposition on two fronts – from the tribes and from the guvernadur. It shocked the tribal leaders that a 17-\n\n22\n\nEMPIRES, ENTITIES, AND STATE-BUILDERS\n\nyear-old would become the Vladika and it took time for the tribal assembly to give its consent. Tension remained between Njegoš and Vuko Radonjić, Montenegro’s governor, who regarded him as politically inexperienced and unfit to rule.37 Seeking to take advantage of this perceived weakness, Radonjić, encouraged by the Austrians, began his (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to usurp power.38 Njegoš, supported by the tribal chiefs, began to wrest control of the embryonic state, eventually abolishing the role of governor in 1832 and forcing Radonjić into exile. This bold move essentially facilitated the shift of power towards the Cetinje Metropolitanate and to Njegoš himself. During the early years of his rule, and having defeated the main source of domestic opposition, Njegoš devoted a good deal of his energy to the second source of internal instability – the tribes. His predecessor had done much to unite the tribes in the face of Ottoman oppression, but had experienced difficulties in shaping a centralized, united intertribal political community, having only sown the seeds of an embryonic legal system. Building on these shaky foundations would prove to be a significant challenge. Continuing to insist on their continuing autonomy, the tribes initially resisted Njegoš’s efforts to consolidate the legal code and to initialize a modern tax system, both of which would have further centralized the state. Thus, while these rapid developments in domestic political affairs may have reinforced his reputation as a reformer, they did not endear him to many tribal Montenegrins, whose strong sense of tradition, characterized by individual and tribal freedom, fundamentally contradicted the notion of a mandatory payment of taxes to a central authority in Cetinje.39 Nonetheless, Njegoš continued with his often unpopular centralizing reforms, introducing a taxation system and basic law on individual and property rights that regulated the ordinary Montenegrin’s relationship with the state.40 It is not just for his achievements in state-building, political progress or uniting Montenegro’s fractious tribes that Njegoš remains such a central figure in Montenegrin history. He is also well known for his literary endeavours, not only in contemporary Montenegrin society but throughout the historical and literary schools of Europe. In fact, it is for literature that he remains such a controversial figure. His Gorski Vijenac (The Mountain Wreath) is possibly the most famous poetic work of South Slav literature.41 The epic poem draws on the events of Christmas Eve 1702 (although it is not known if these events actually took place) when, in an attempt to save Montenegro from Ottoman penetration, Montenegrin Muslims were offered the choice of ‘baptism or death’. Those who chose not to accept Christianity were put to the sword. These events, known as the ‘Montenegrin Vespers’ were articulated powerfully in Njegoš’s finest work. Indeed, one cannot over emphasize the significance of The Mountain Wreath. Any historian or analyst attempting to\n\n23\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nunderstand the roots of contemporary social, cultural or political life in Montenegro would wise to read Njegoš’s works. According to Djilas, ‘[Montenegrins] hardly knew the Bible; for them, the Mountain Wreath might have served as such a book.’42 It is the theme of the poem that divides opinion. Is it an epic poem about the struggle for freedom from oppression or a paean to the massacre of Muslims? There are numerous different interpretations and Njegoš’s classic work has been subject to much scrutiny.43 Outside the realm of poetic endeavour, Njegoš further promoted a Serb identity among the people by persuading Montenegrin tribes to adopt the kapa (cap) as a statement of solidarity with Serbia and abandon their traditional Turkish fezzes. The kapa’s black border represents mourning for the defeat at Kosovo, its red centre Serbian blood spilt, and its golden semicircles the centuries of Turkish oppression.44 Njegoš also awarded the Miloš Obilić45 military decoration to Montenegrin soldiers who showed bravery on the battlefield and it became the highest military honour. Njegoš stopped wearing a fez, which carried Turkish overtones, and, encouraging others to follow suit, wore Serbian national costume. Njegoš died in 1851 at the age of only 39, but he had left a significant legacy. During the period of his rule, he fundamentally separated church from state and laid the foundations for an independent Montenegrin state.46 Appropriately (and at his own request), he was buried upon his beloved Mount Lovćen.\n\nDanilo Petrović-Njegoš: Absolutist Ruler and State-Builder One day a group of us were with Vladka Rade, who was sitting in his chair with his eyes shut and we thought he was sleeping. Doctor Radišić asked me ‘Who will be the Vladikas heir?’ I replied simply ‘Danilo’. Branko said that he had never heard of the name before and the Vladika, without opening his eyes, said with a smile ‘If his character stays the way it is now, the whole of Europe will hear about him.47 Njegoš’s chosen successor was his 25-year-old nephew Zeko Stankov, better known as Prince Danilo. His reign may have been short at only nine years, but his legacy was as significant as that of his predecessor. Although Njegoš sanctioned his accession to power, Zeko faced significant opposition in his ascendancy.48 Having been in Vienna at the time of Njegoš’s death, Zeko found upon his return to Cetinje that his uncle (and president of the senate), Pero Tomov, had installed himself inside the Biljarda and adopted the trappings of power. Njegoš’s long period of ill health had dictated that power shifted towards the senate, the leading representatives of Montenegro’s tribes; and they felt little inclined to cede power to the young Zeko. The latter, however, was not dissuaded and in the power struggle that ensued, he\n\n24\n\nEMPIRES, ENTITIES, AND STATE-BUILDERS\n\ndemonstrated a strength and ruthlessness that would become all too familiar to Montenegrins over the next decade. He insisted that the tribal chiefs honour his uncle’s wish that Danilo become Montenegro’s next ruler. And indeed, his forceful will, the support of the Russian establishment, and his incessant harassment of the tribal leaders, led to him being formally recognized as Vladika. But not content with being simply an ecclesiastical ruler, Danilo sought to become Montenegro’s first secular ruler.49 In love with Darinka Kevekić, Danilo intended to marry. The role of Vladika would not allow for such an arrangement and, as a consequence, Danilo would have to seek endorsement for the shift towards secular rule. To do this, however, he would need both the support of the tribal chieftains and the approval of the Russian tsar. But while the tribal leaders and the Russians acquiesced to (rather than approved) the elevation of Danilo to the status of prince, the Turks, knowing that this development essentially ended Turkish claims to Montenegro, staunchly refused to recognize the new political reality.50 In 1852 the Turks, refusing to recognize Montenegro’s new status, began to meddle in Montenegrin affairs (offering the Piperi tribe special status if they accepted Turkish offers of suzerainty). In retaliation, Danilo attacked and seized control of Žabljak Crnojević (the original seat of the Crnojević dynasty on Lake Skadar). While this was merely a storm in a teacup in military terms, it gave the Turks a definitive pretext to attack Montenegro and the subsequent Turkish onslaught was considerable. Surrounded by enemy forces, the Montenegrin army did its best to hold the overwhelming Turkish force at bay. In the knowledge that Montenegrin forces would be unable to do so for long, Danilo turned to the Austrians (who were seeking opportunities to increase their influence in the Balkans) for assistance. Austria’s subsequent intervention proved effective and the Turks sued for peace in 1853. Montenegro had been saved by Vienna. The whole affair convinced Danilo that Montenegro – while unable to wage a victorious war against the Turks – could use its influence to effect change by destabilizing regions within the Ottoman Empire. As a consequence, Danilo began to support uprisings in Herzegovina, which, it was envisaged, would erode Ottoman control in Bosnia & Herzegovina. Here the Montenegrins sought to internationalize the ‘Montenegrin Question’ as a way of attaining their objectives. Danilo knew he could not defeat the Ottoman Empire, but he could create significant problems within its boundaries and destabilize relations between the Great Powers and the Ottomans. Herzegovina was fertile ground for instability, and it would cause problems not simply for the Ottomans but to the borders of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Thus, greater forces now had an interest in solving Montenegro’s territorial dispute with the Ottomans. The Herzegovinan uprising of 1857 (directed by the Montenegrins) represented a realization of Danilo’s policy. Angered by\n\n25\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nMontenegrin actions in Herzegovina, the Sublime Porte sent Husein-pasha, the commander of Ottoman forces in Herzegovina, to punish the Montenegrins. The armies met at Grahovo on 13 May and, despite its comparatively meagre resources, the Montenegrin army was victorious. Intensification of the conflict seemed inevitable before the involvement of the Great Powers, which convinced the Ottomans to consent to the establishment of a demarcation commission. Later that year the border between Montenegro and Turkey was officially established. This represented a significant step towards formal independence and a vindication of Danilo’s aggressive policies. This dogged determination was an early manifestation of Danilo’s character; internal and external enemies would later experience at close quarters his authoritarian bent. Within Montenegro Danilo was ruthless in oppressing those he regarded as enemies. Any internal opposition was met with ruthless efficiency. Some tribes did not respond well to Danilo’s centralizing measures. The shift of power towards authorities in Cetinje and away from local tribal leaders was opposed by those who felt their authority eroding. The Kuči tribe, which was under formal Ottoman rule but frequently in rebellion, was particularly well known throughout the region for its opposition to centralized rule. It not only rebelled strongly against the centralism of the Montenegrin state in the nineteenth century but was also in conflict with the Turks. In the mid-1850s the tribe was involved in two pokarati (rebellions) – prva pokara against the Turks, and druga pokara against Prince Danilo and Mirko Petrović.51 During the latter, Danilo sent Duke Mirko to bring the Kuči tribe to heel. Danilo had cultivated an aggressive but clever strategy towards his international and domestic enemies, yet his downfall would come not from external aggression but from internal dissent. He was assassinated in Kotor while holidaying with his wife, Darinka. The assassin was Todor Kadić, an exiled Montenegrin from the aggrieved Bjelopavlić tribe. Paradoxically, Danilo had become the victim of a practice he had outlawed five years before his death in 1855. Danilo’s assassination and death dictated that the line of succession fell to his only nephew, his brother Mirko’s son, Nikola. Unlike Danilo, who had been forced to contend with forces who disapproved of his accession, Nikola faced no internal challenge and was to enjoy, at least in the early years of his rule, absolute power.\n\n26\n\n3 The Rise and Fall of the Kingdom of Montenegro Danilo’s manipulation of the ‘Montenegrin Question’ had brought rapid and tangible results. His tenacity had been rewarded with respect to the formal delineation of the border between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire, the raising of Montenegro’s profile abroad, and the consolidation of the power of the state internally. Yet, increased international recognition, modernization and territorial expansion would prove a poisoned chalice. Prince Nikola I Petrović, who ascended the throne in 1860 (initially as Gospodar – Lord) at the tender age of 18, would find himself the ruler of a very different Montenegro (in terms of scale and ethnic composition) from the one his predecessors had envisaged. However, Nikola continued with the policies of state-building and territorial expansion that Danilo had so vociferously pursued. Nikola’s succession to the throne was to the exclusion of his father, Duke Mirko, whom Danilo’s widow, Darinka, considered too much of a firebrand to be ruler of Montenegro, despite his reputation as an excellent guerrilla fighter and experienced diplomat. Thus, the succession fell to Nikola. Building upon Danilo’s legacy, he would oversee the consolidation of the Montenegrin state and seek to expand its territory (by supporting uprisings in Herzegovina, for example).1 Young, well-educated, but politically inexperienced, Nikola’s early years as Gospodar were a baptism of fire. Early conflicts set the tone. Nikola (and his father) continued the tradition of supporting uprisings in Herzegovina despite the objections of the Great Powers.2 Again, the Ottoman leaders despaired of the unruly Montenegrins, whose continuing support for the rebellions brought chaos to that corner of the empire. War with the Turks was the inevitable outcome of Montenegro’s continuing support for the rebellions.3 In 1862, the Ottoman army, led by Omer-Pasha Latas, spared nothing in its attempts to bring the Montenegrins to heel and to restore order to Herzegovina. The ensuing attack led to a rapid and decisive defeat for the Montenegrins. So heavy was the defeat that the Great Powers had to intervene to stop Ottoman troops entering the Montenegrin capital, Cetinje.4 The Montenegrins would have to wait another decade to exact revenge for the humiliation, and again Herzegovina would be the\n\n27\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\npretext. In 1876, after forging an alliance with Prince Milan of Serbia, Nikola declared war on Turkey, sending 11,000 troops to Herzegovina (numbers later bolstered by Hercegovinian volunteers bringing the total to around 15,000).5 This Montenegrin force (and the 120,000 strong force from Serbia) declared war on the Ottoman Empire in June, and significant battles took place within a month. Early successes were abundant for the Montenegrins. At Vučji Do on 28 July, the Ottoman army suffered a significant defeat at the hands of the tenacious Montenegrins and, in August 1876, the pattern was repeated at Fundina. These defeats forced the Turks to the negotiating table, but despite lengthy negotiations, hostilities resumed early the following year. This time, the renewed Ottoman assault was more effective, pushing the Montenegrins deep into their own territory. Only a Russian attack and breakthrough of the Ottoman defence lines on the Danube front saved the Montenegrins from inevitable defeat. Desperate to hold their defensive line on the Danube (which represented their strategic defence of Constantinople itself), Ottoman units withdrew from Montenegro to defend against the Russian onslaught. Constantinople’s strategic decision facilitated Montenegrin gains. Nikšić, Bar and Ulcinj all fell into Montenegrin hands. And thus it stayed until the cessation of hostilities. Under these unusual circumstances Montenegro made significant territorial gains, which gave it leverage in the negotiations with the Great Powers during the Congress of Berlin in 1878. That the territories Montenegro held after the end of the Montenegro–Turkish war would go to it was only the beginning of a significant new phase in Montenegro’s history. The Congress of Berlin in 1878 confirmed that Montenegro would be compensated by the addition of new territories and be granted formal recognition as an independent state. Thus, the independence of Montenegro, forged through war and sacrifice, was acknowledged by the Great Powers, and even by countries that had been unwilling hitherto to do so formally (namely the Ottoman Empire). The 1877 Treaty of San Stefano awarded Montenegro a territory double its previous size (though this was later reduced at the Congress of Berlin in 1878), as well as access to the sea at Bar and Ulcinj. This expansion gave Montenegro vital entry to the Adriatic Sea, facilitating easier access to the free-market democracies of western Europe.6 Furthermore, as a result of the settlement at Berlin, Montenegro acquired the following cities: Nikšić, Spuž, Podgorica, Kolašin, Andrijevica, Žabljak, Bar, Plav and Gusinje.7 In the period immediately after its recognition, Montenegro continued its impressive expansion – doubling in size between 1878 and 1880 alone. As the Ottoman Empire’s grip on the Balkans weakened, Montenegro exploited the emerging power vacuum. It expanded as significant military successes led to territorial gains and economic benefits (such as the acquisition of more fertile land).8 Liberation and independence had been realized, but these apparently\n\n28\n\nTHE RISE AND FALL OF THE KINGDOM OF MONTENEGRO\n\npositive developments brought with them significant problems. Territorial expansion happened too rapidly, and, as Čagorović pointed out, ‘too fast to enable adequate integration of the population of the new areas into the ethnic nucleus of Montenegro’.9 Thus, despite the euphoria surrounding this newlyrecognized independence, there were significant drawbacks that would render their perceived improvement in fortunes self defeating. With all these territorial expansions, Montenegro, noted Ivo Banac, ‘expanded into territories where the tradition of Montenegrin uniqueness and statehood did not obtain’.10 No longer was Montenegro confined to the Brda and Old Montenegro; the expanded territory contained many Serbian and Albanian tribes whose loyalties lay elsewhere. Montenegro was now large enough to be a viable state, yet the larger it became the more diluted the core, traditional ‘Old Montenegrin’ identity, became. Ecclesiastically, Montenegro was no longer a mono-confessional (Orthodox) territory. Islamic and Catholic populations were now under the jurisdiction of the Montenegrin state and their numbers were significant. However, in this respect, assimilation was largely successful. Despite Montenegro’s overwhelmingly mono-confessional character, these minorities’ confessional rights were fully respected and inter-ecclesiastical relations improved (in fact remained excellent throughout Nikola’s rule). The Muslim population was granted the right to have its own religious leader (the Montenegrin mufti), and Montenegro’s Islamic community was founded in 1878.11 Relations with Montenegro’s Catholics were equally cordial. In 1886, Montenegro became the first Orthodox country to sign an accord with the Vatican, regulating the limits of the religious jurisdiction of the Bar archbishopric but confirming its privileges.12 Outside the ecclesiastical arena, Nikola strengthened the trust of these new minorities by inte"
