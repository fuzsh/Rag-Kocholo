        "text": "Academic painter and writer from Serbia of Montenegrin origin, Milica Vuckovic with her new novel \"The fatal outcome of athletic injuries\" she was included in the shortlist for the 2021 novel award, which is awarded for the 68th time by the Belgrade weekly NIN.\n\nShe said in an interview with \"Vijesti\" that she dedicated the novel to all those who are silent, including her aunt Draginja \"who died because of her silence\".\n\n\"Silence as an athletic injury. She was silent because she was protecting all of us from what she was surviving, and her silence cost her in the end... I am also the one who is silent. That's how I was brought up, that's how I am, they teach us to be silent and suffer,\" says Vučković in one part of the interview.\n\nCritics describe her work as \"a novel of absolute honesty\", and one of the reviewers, a writer, playwright and partisan, Bozo Koprivica points out that it is a book for the few who can withstand the honesty brought by the heroine Eva.\n\n\"Eva is a superfluous man. He has a failed life, failed and happy, because it is the path of honesty and curiosity. This is a book of anguish and love. Suzu scales, pulls the thorn out of her eye. A novel of absolute honesty. A book for the few, for those who can stand that honesty. This is not a book for nerds.\n\nThis novel would impress Jack Kerouac and, especially, on the sixth day, to the bride Rastko Petrović. A book on the trail of bruised scars: I learned everything myself, on my own knees. A book about the harsh working life in Germany, a left-wing novel: my fingernails were covered in blood, the tips of my fingers hurt like freshly amputated ones. The bigger the load, the better the body position. The greater the joy of the body, silence, rhythm.\n\nMilica Vučković as Cassius Clay, like Muhammad Ali. Vučković makes poetry out of the words stove, patched, flecked, clumsy... He makes a solo part for jazz clarinet from the word zipper, which occurs as a chorus. Vučković writes in the rhythm of jazz variations with blues sections. And it grows until the excellent finale of the novel. It roars quietly and terribly like the Danube, like a deadly disease. Like in novels Margaret Diras. Falcons for life. Love as pain and as a miracle. Love is a miracle that goes over the edge of the novel, the novel and the mind,\" says Koprivica.\n\nIt is concluded that Vučković did not make a mistake when she ventured into art, i.e. literature... People close to her told her to graduate from a faculty that would \"make bread\", because somehow it has always been understood that there is rarely such in art. Nevertheless, after the mathematics high school, she enrolled in painting, and later, as an academic painter with experience working in the hospitality industry, but also with experience in tattooing, i.e. working as a tattoo artist, she ventured into literature, where she found herself and liberated herself.\n\n\"Since I've been working with people all my life and I've been silent all my life, because I'm shy and because I don't like to talk, I spend a lot of time observing people. The human psyche is endlessly entertaining... So, I also feel what my heroes are going through, identify with them and speak on their behalf. I try not to judge my heroes, but to understand them,\" says Vučković for \"Vijesti\".\n\nShe points out that she is connected to Montenegro in various ways and promises to visit the first at the next opportunity.\n\n\"I love that cheerful spirit and that specific attitude towards life, that defiance and innate anarchy. People are still warm and close, they are not alienated like in these Europeanized metropolises like Belgrade. In a way, I feel sorry for Montenegro, I think that country has the capacity to be Switzerland, it has natural resources and beauty that cannot be found anywhere, only there are no people who love it and who love their people\", says Vučković and continues to talk about his novel, motives, inspiration, painting, society and plans for the future...\n\nYou are a painter by training, but you also express yourself in a recognizable and impressive, obvious and successful way through literature, that is, through the written word. To begin with, how did it come about? They often say that visual artists are worse with words, so that's why they choose art instruments as their means of expression...\n\nI have to admit that this is a frequent question. Here it is, I have always really liked to draw and even as a child I wanted to study painting. I don't come from an artistic family nor was my family well-to-do, so I have to admit that no one was overly happy with my idea. I finished the mathematics major in high school and they persuaded me to enroll in architecture. \"Finish, son, something that has bread\". Nevertheless, I finished painting, and since there is really no bread from it, I supported myself by catering. Nevertheless, after almost ten years of completed studies and ten years of active exposure, I managed to make a living partly from painting. I mean, I can charge for my effort and work. You have to be patient, persistent and you have to work. Doing more than being noisy. There is no winter for the one who has a \"fixed\" idea, he will surely succeed if he perseveres. As for the second part of the question, painters today, unfortunately, are often weak with words, and students from our state art faculties often graduate illiterate. That's why I started reading obsessively during my studies. I found my friends and interlocutors in books. I'm really bad with words - I don't like to talk, I don't even like to answer the phone, I always wait for the ring to stop before I send a message. That's how I started writing. When something bothers me, when I think about something, and I have no one to share it with. I like to put words together as if they were elements of a picture, for me it's not too different. For me, therefore, the greatest art is mathematics.\n\nYou debuted on the literary scene with the collection of short stories \"Swarm\", followed by the novel \"Baldwin\", and then \"The Fatal Outcome of Athletic Injuries\", which is shortlisted for the prestigious Nino Award for Novel of the Year. Before we look back at \"athletic injuries\", is there something that is the basic motive and connecting thread in your (literary) creativity, some phenomenon or topic that you are researching?\n\nIt turns out that there is, and that phenomenon is me. As it also turns out that I am a woman, the problems that I deal with in the text are problems that women face in today's society. I talked about it unconsciously, and then it turned out to be something universally important. As I am not educated in literature, I think that I write intuitively, without any big premeditation. That's what amuses me the most about writing, that I never know what will happen, that's exactly what makes me happy the most in life and why I think life is precious.\n\nThe title of the novel, to me personally, somehow sounds like sarcasm, which in the \"athletic injury\" section indicates a group of common excuses used to hide (family) violence. Maybe I'm wrong, and additionally because I read some of your explanations related to the title of the novel. But how did you come to that and what does it actually allude to, how much is the title related to the plot of the novel?\n\nMake no mistake, you understood everything well. Athletic injuries are those that do not have fatal outcomes, such as various sprains, fractures, tendonitis. The possible fatal outcome of such injuries can be when we ignore them. And so my heroes walk on broken legs or neglect their inflamed nerves, and this, in the end, costs them their lives.\n\nI read one of your interviews in which you said that you like long titles. In your opinion, how important is the title of the novel, as well as the visual design of the book cover?\n\nAs we live today under the burden of \"branding\", and as the world is reduced to a visual experience, I think it is important. Important not for literature, of course, but an important item if you want what you write to reach more people. It's a stereotype, but a male reader is less likely to get hold of a book by a female author in advance, and only if the book is pink and with flowers, then he won't at all. The design of the cover can both help and hinder, that's why, I wonder, the design should be returned to the good old form - conciseness, color, name, good typography. I consider everything else superfluous. As for titles, yes, I like long titles but that's just my personal affinity. I like titles that tell a story by themselves.\n\nIn the novel, you present, among other things, unhealthy and dysfunctional relationships and communication (or the lack thereof) among family members, but also partners, friends, and so on. Today it is talked about a lot, but again not enough because individuals or communities neglect and minimize the importance of relationships, or simply do not deal with it and do not think about it for various other reasons. How important is a healthy relationship and good communication, in any field?\n\nA healthy relationship and good communication is the only thing that matters in any relationship.\n\nI would notice that in your works you focus on women and in different ways question the position of women in a patriarchal society or in a contemporary society that inherits a patriarchal legacy. What is it that does not allow us to step away and see the benefits of freedom? Is the fight for equality still ongoing and how difficult is it?\n\nI talk about it again and again, some freedoms for women have been won, but the fight continues continuously. As long as a woman is first a woman, and only then a man, the fight must not stop.\n\nIn your works, you also raise topics that are still considered taboo today, and again, we deny that. What kind of relationship do we have as individuals and as a collective towards things that do not suit us, that we are afraid of, that trap us?\n\nOur cultural heritage and our collective unconscious shape us more than we can imagine. Everything that is taken for granted, every place where we think we have an opinion about something, every place and point of view should be re-examined. It is easiest to think by heart, to accept things \"as they are\", instead of thinking that maybe things are not like that. It is the line of least resistance, running away, not accepting, resenting, labeling, implying. I see freedom, only, in constant questioning and facing the fact that we know nothing, and that nothing is taken for granted.\n\nIn order to deal with such topics, it seems to me that it is necessary to deeply elaborate the psychological profile of the characters and to know what each or every one of them is. Is this even possible if sometimes we don't even know ourselves completely? How do you create your characters, do you have a sketch on the side, do you consult with someone during work and the like?\n\nSince I've been working with people all my life (catering, tattooing), and since I've been quiet all my life because I'm shy and don't like to talk, I spend a lot of time observing people. The human psyche is endlessly entertaining. That's how I build characters, based on experience, combining the characteristics of some people I know into one hero. I read a lot about psychology, so that helps me, and I also have a few friends who are therapists, so I often talk to them about it. I went to therapy myself, quite unsuccessfully I must admit, so I am close to \"both sides\" of psychology, so I use that knowledge when building characters. Otherwise, I am troubled by an excess of empathy and a problem with empathy, when someone describes to me how something hurts them, it immediately starts to hurt me too. So, I feel what my heroes are going through, I identify with them and speak on their behalf. I try not to judge my heroes, but to understand them.\n\nIn this regard, you once said that you dedicated the novel to those who remain silent. How harmful is this silence and can it sometimes speak for itself and thus be loud? Have you thought about making (one of) your works into a screenplay or writing a screenplay?\n\nSilence is a symptom, it is not natural to man. Silence is fatal. I dedicated the novel, first of all, to my aunt Draginja, who died in silence. Silence as an athletic injury. She was silent because she was protecting all of us from what she was surviving, and her silence cost her in the end. I am also the one who is silent. That's how I was brought up, that's how I am, they teach us to be silent and suffer. In silence, you are always alone, and a person can hardly deal with problems alone. That's why I dedicated this book to people who are silent, so that they understand that they are not alone, and that they should not be alone in whatever situation they are in. Screen adaptation or dramatization - of course I would like to see something happen, but those are things that do not depend on me.\n\nYou live and work between Belgrade and Herceg Novi, it says in your biography. What binds you to Montenegro and when will you visit us again?\n\nIn addition to the fact that, as I said, my mother is from Montenegro, my partner's parents are also from Montenegro. I have a lot of relatives down there, and that mentality is close to me. I love that cheerful spirit and that certain specific attitude towards life, that defiance and innate anarchy. People are still warm and close, they are not alienated like in these Europeanized metropolises like Belgrade. In a way, I feel sorry for Montenegro, I think that country has the capacity to be Switzerland, it has natural riches and beauties that are not found anywhere, but there are no people who love it and who love their people. I hope that all our countries have a brighter future. And I will visit you - at the first opportunity!\n\nWhat are you currently working on, do you have any future plans? Would you like to add or order something?\n\nI am currently trying to put my life in order, because I have less and less strength for this pace of life. I can't work four jobs, so now I plan to take time off from everything and paint. To dedicate myself to painting in the next year. My novels are now like grown-up children, let them go alone, let them manage, let me alone, I'll paint... What about ordering? -Never stop loving people. And to read books, if you have time.\n\nPainting is rapture and escape\n\nDoes it happen that sometimes, guided by the same idea, you create a certain motif through different media, or do the motifs not overlap with each other in painting and literature? What does it depend on and is it possible to balance the two or do you simply surrender to the one whose call you feel in the moment?\n\nI think that the era of some kind of directly engaged painting has passed. In painting, I solve artistic problems, problems of color and composition, I see painting as a kind of rapture and escape. As much as fine art today has gone in the direction of conceptual and theory, I still love and still do traditional, that is, easel painting. And the motives, the motives are always the same, what you call a calling, I call it a curse. What haunts me is present both in what I paint and in what I write, it haunts me even while I eat, walk, and sleep. I fight with that with the means that are first at hand, a brush, a pencil, a cigarette, walking.\n\nIt's easier for people to think one thing without looking at the bigger picture\n\nIn a media appearance at the end of 2021, you publicly uttered words that part of the public did not agree with and encountered various comments and condemnations. Do we have an ear for a different opinion, for those who think differently? This is followed by the question, how tolerant are we?\n\nAt this point, I will refer to what I talked about in one of the previous questions - the easiest thing is to think that you think, that you take things for granted, that you think that you have an unshakable attitude, that it is a reflection of some kind of intellect. Such an attitude just smacks of thoughtlessness. It is always easier for people to think one thing, black or white, to be this or that, and not to look at the bigger picture or to try to give some new answer. The questions are always suggestive, you are always put in an assumed context, and it is up to you to decide. I don't want to decide, nor share, with anyone, anywhere, because I don't want to limit myself to my assumed audience and collect cheap points because I don't need a pat on the back.\n\nAnd we are not tolerant in the least, nor have we ever been, precisely because of that \"determination\".\n\nThe festival in Berane is brave, ingenious and enormously significant\n\nYou were a guest at the second edition of the women's literary festival \"I literature has a female face\" in Berane. What impressions do you have from that small town in the north of Montenegro?\n\nYou will certainly consider this flattery, but I am infinitely glad that I was a guest of that festival. First of all, because I got to know the people and colleagues from Beran up close, because I felt that life as if it were my own. Centralization is one of the biggest problems of culture, so I prefer to agree to guest appearances in smaller cities. The love and enthusiasm of the people I met in Berane, whom I met in Kčevo, give me the will and strength to continue working and to think that something can happen and change. In addition, my mother is from Montenegro, and the question of the position of women in a traditional Montenegrin family is something that I carry to some extent and what I think about when I write. Creating a literary festival in Berane in which only women participate - that is brave and ingenious.\n\nIt is the only festival of such a profile in Montenegro. From that perspective, how important does that mission seem to you, and in addition, how much can something be achieved or changed through literature and art? Can literature influence society and public opinion?\n\nI think that just recently in an interview for Al Jazeera I said the following - I believe that money changes society from the outside, but that art is the only thing that can change society from the inside. Such ideas and such a program are precisely the way in which women will first of all become aware of their position, and then fight for a different one. Organizing such a festival is of enormous importance and I wholeheartedly support such initiatives.\n\nThe contemporary feminist struggle is on a see-saw between self-affirmation and self-discrimination\n\nWe talked a lot about women and the position of women. How is it in literature and does there exist \"women's writing\" and what would the phrase \"women's literature\" mean? Does this discriminate or make the creativity of women, authors, more visible?\n\nUh… I don't like to hear “female writing”. I just don't like it. I understand that it must be insisted on until female artists, in this case, writers, are equally relevant names and equally represented in institutions, readings, and the like, that this is the \"stretching of the stick\" that is necessary in order for the stick to be corrected. Despite this, still, when I crave \"female writing\", ugh... it's hard for me. As I mentioned before, as long as a woman is first a woman and then a man, we have a problem. The contemporary feminist struggle is constantly on the seesaw between self-affirmation and self-discrimination."
