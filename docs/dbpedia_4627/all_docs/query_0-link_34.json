        "text": "Usage examples of \"bozo\".\n\nHe ended it with another growl that caused Bozo to ease back in his chair and give a sheepish grin.\n\nBrodie was comparing his new lieutenant, Cliff Marsland, with the old, Bozo Griffin.\n\nThe single shot, though unexpected in this quiet neighborhood, had no aftermath until Bozo decided to give the next command.\n\nIf such were the case, the guilt must lie between Bozo Griffin and Cliff Marsland.\n\nCliff Marsland, strolling through the badlands with Bozo Griffin, had gained no suspicion whatever.\n\nThey strolled a block until they reached the front of the old hotel, where Brodie was to meet Bozo and Cliff.\n\nWith a contemptuous laugh, Brodie Brodan ordered Bozo Griffin to bring the prisoner along.\n\nI refer to that waddling and bowlegged purple-furred monstrosity with a huge and faithful heart of purest cold, Bozo the othode.\n\nI later sent a message to my friend back on Earth, informing him that we had seen Bozo and his mate, together with a litter of eight of the fattest, most adorable othode pups imaginable.\n\nBozo has gone back to the wild, with most of her litter, and Bozo, together with one of his male pups, feeling the need for human companionship again, now that the urge for domesticity had waned, took to haunting the gates of Shondakor, and finally deigned to join us in the palace as a pet of the entire court.\n\nAt any rate, my courtiers were already fond of Bozo-for it was none other than the faithful Bozo who had found the hidden door to Kuur, and because of his keen nose and hunting instinct, we found and crushed the dread and dangerous Mind Wizards.\n\nWhile in the palace, Bozo sleeps wherever he likes, sometimes in the suite I share with my beloved Darloona, sometimes on hot nights in the cool gardens-but, more often than not, he chooses to share the little bed on which Taran sleeps when he is not on duty in the cadet barracks.\n\nTaran found Koja with Bozo and Fido, returning from a spell of exercise in the palace gardens.\n\nTaran who found Bozo and Edo, it was really Bozo and Fido who found Taran."
