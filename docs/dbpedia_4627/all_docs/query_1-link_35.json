Case number IT-97-25-T, the\n\n8 Prosecutor versus Krnojelac.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: Now, sir, you are still bound by the solemn\n\n10 declaration that you took on the last occasion that you were here; do you\n\n11 understand that?\n\n12 THE INTERPRETER: The interpreters cannot hear the witness at\n\n13 all.\n\n14 JUDGE HUNT: I'm afraid your answer was not heard. I don't think\n\n15 the microphones are -- can he be heard?\n\n16 THE INTERPRETER: No.\n\n17 JUDGE HUNT: Just one moment. This is a voice distortion case,\n\n18 isn't it? I'm afraid the technicians will have to sort this one out.\n\n19 THE REGISTRAR: Can the interpreters switch to the right channel,\n\n20 please.\n\n21 THE INTERPRETER: The right channel is 7.\n\n22 THE REGISTRAR: Could the witness please say some numbers or words\n\n23 into the microphone, whatever you want to say.\n\n24 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have understood what you said.\n\n25 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you very much, indeed.\n\nPage 1059\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1060\n\n1 Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff, you are taking your witness in chief.\n\n2 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n3 WITNESS: WITNESS FWS-66 [Resumed]\n\n4 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\n5 Examined by Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff: [Continued]\n\n6 Q. Good morning, Witness.\n\n7 A. Good morning.\n\n8 JUDGE HUNT: Just one moment. I'm sorry, I've forgotten. We are\n\n9 in a different courtroom.\n\n10 Mr. Krnojelac, are you able to understand the proceedings in a\n\n11 language that you understand?\n\n12 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes, I understand.\n\n13 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you very much, indeed. Sit down, please, sir.\n\n14 Sorry, Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff.\n\n15 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n16 Q. Witness, when we -- when you started your testimony, you mentioned\n\n17 that fighting stopped after a few days in Foca. Do you recall when it\n\n18 stopped, what date it was?\n\n19 A. Well, the attack on Foca started on the 8th of April. That lasted\n\n20 for a few days, four or five days, and then it abated a bit.\n\n21 Q. What did the Muslims do when the fighting stopped?\n\n22 A. They started leaving Foca en masse. There were massive columns of\n\n23 people across the bridge on the Drina River and in the direction of\n\n24 Gorazde, for the most part.\n\n25 Q. What happened to the Muslim houses in Donje Polje during the\n\nPage 1061\n\n1 fighting or after the fighting had stopped?\n\n2 A. Most of the houses started burning, and throughout that time\n\n3 houses were burning, Muslim houses.\n\n4 Q. When you say \"started burning,\" how did they start to burn? Was\n\n5 it during the fighting activities or did they start to burn otherwise?\n\n6 A. Both during combat operations and later, when things abated. They\n\n7 were setting houses on fire.\n\n8 Q. When you say \"they,\" whom do you mean?\n\n9 A. The Serbs.\n\n10 Q. Did you actually see that?\n\n11 A. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I saw houses on fire, but I could not\n\n12 say whose house was on fire, which house was on fire exactly, because I\n\n13 didn't dare look back.\n\n14 Q. But how, then, do you know that they were Muslim houses?\n\n15 A. Well, I heard about it from these people in prison later. I heard\n\n16 whose houses had turned down. We talked amongst ourselves.\n\n17 Q. What happened to the 11 mosques in Foca that you mentioned?\n\n18 A. Today there's not a single one left. All of them were either\n\n19 burned down or mined.\n\n20 Q. When the fighting ceased, did the people resume work?\n\n21 A. No, no, they did not. Muslims did not work.\n\n22 Q. And why?\n\n23 A. Well, they didn't dare. They weren't allowed to get into the\n\n24 company where they worked.\n\n25 Q. Were there any general restrictions on movements?\n\nPage 1062\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1063\n\n1 A. There were, out of fear, for the most part.\n\n2 Q. Were there also any official restrictions, like announcements or\n\n3 orders that did allow movements?\n\n4 A. Well, they imposed a curfew in the evening. It would start in the\n\n5 evening and you were not supposed to move about, at least that's what they\n\n6 said on the radio.\n\n7 Q. These restrictions, were they equally directed against all ethnic\n\n8 groups?\n\n9 A. Yes, probably.\n\n10 Q. While you were at home, was it ever searched, your home?\n\n11 A. While I was there, no, while I was in the apartment.\n\n12 Q. Did you have a weapon?\n\n13 A. Yes, I did. I had hunting weapons. I was a member of the hunting\n\n14 association.\n\n15 Q. Did you keep this weapon throughout the war?\n\n16 A. No, no. Until the 15th of April it was at home.\n\n17 Q. Yes. And what happened on the 15th of April?\n\n18 A. On the 15th of April, a police car went through town, providing\n\n19 information as follows: that everybody who had weapons was supposed to\n\n20 bring it out to the plateau in front of the Ribarski Dom, and that all\n\n21 Muslims and Serbs should go out to this plateau, to this square.\n\n22 Q. And did you go there with your weapon?\n\n23 A. Yes.\n\n24 Q. And what happened on this plateau?\n\n25 A. On this plateau there were a couple hundred of men, women, and\n\nPage 1064\n\n1 children. Serbs and Muslims had to get out there. While we were waiting,\n\n2 we saw from the direction of the army building, we saw some soldiers in\n\n3 black uniforms walking down the street, armed with automatic weapons.\n\n4 They were walking towards this group that had gathered in front of this\n\n5 fish restaurant.\n\n6 Q. And what did you do with your weapon, and what happened to the\n\n7 other weapons?\n\n8 A. We all had to put weapons down on the sidewalk; we had to line\n\n9 them up. And when they came, they said, \"Whose weapons are these?\" and\n\n10 then all of us who had permits said that it was us. And then they divided\n\n11 the Serbs from the Muslims; Serbs on the one side and all the others on\n\n12 the other side. They collected our weapons and returned their weapons to\n\n13 them, I mean those who had brought them out, the Serbs.\n\n14 Q. And when you say \"their\" and \"them,\" you need to be more\n\n15 specific.\n\n16 A. They told the Serbs to take their weapons and to take them home,\n\n17 but they took ours.\n\n18 Q. Was anyone arrested on this occasion?\n\n19 A. Yes. That's when they started taking some of the Muslims out of\n\n20 that group. They took 15 men; they handcuffed them; they hit them; they\n\n21 put them into some kind of a vehicle, a kombi van; and they took them in a\n\n22 direction unknown to us.\n\n23 Q. Can you tell us the names of some of these 15 men?\n\n24 A. For example, Murat Crneta, Zulfo Veiz, Munib Veiz, Uzeir Aganovic,\n\n25 Adil Krajcin, et cetera.\n\nPage 1065\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1066\n\n1 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honours, the witness has just mentioned\n\n2 Munib Veiz, that is Schedule C-28; he mentioned Zulfo Veiz, that is C-29;\n\n3 he mentioned Adil Krajcin, that is C-14; and Uzeir Aganovic is also on the\n\n4 list. I forgot to note down. It's also from Schedule C.\n\n5 JUDGE HUNT: He mentioned the other Veiz as well.\n\n6 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes, I have mentioned. Munib 28 and Zulfo\n\n7 29.\n\n8 A. Yes, Zulfo.\n\n9 Q. Witness, was there a particular reason to single these 15 men\n\n10 out? Could you see a reason why them?\n\n11 A. No, no, I could not. Nobody could understand that, according to\n\n12 which criterion they singled them out.\n\n13 Q. Did you see these men again?\n\n14 A. Yes. I saw them in prison down there. And they told me that they\n\n15 were first taken to the prison Livade, called Solana [phoen], and they\n\n16 beat them there, mistreated them.\n\n17 Q. And when you say \"they,\" who do you mean?\n\n18 A. The Serbs. They beat Munib Veiz there at the plateau when they\n\n19 first took him away and later when they brought him to Livade, and Zulfo\n\n20 Veiz as well.\n\n21 Q. Witness, were you arrested, and when?\n\n22 A. I was arrested on the 23rd of April, 1992.\n\n23 Q. What time of the day did that happen?\n\n24 A. In the morning, around 10.00.\n\n25 Q. And where were you arrested?\n\nPage 1067\n\n1 A. In the apartment.\n\n2 Q. Does that mean at your home?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q. Who arrested you?\n\n5 A. Well, first, some four men in uniform came. Among them I\n\n6 recognised only one. It was a Pipovic from the village of Celebic. He\n\n7 used to go to high school; he was a student of mine. They came banging at\n\n8 the door and asking whose apartment this was. My wife went out and said\n\n9 whose apartment this was. And they asked where I was, and she said that I\n\n10 was in the apartment.\n\n11 I got out and they asked me, \"Have you got any weapons?\" and I\n\n12 said that I had weapons with a permit and that I handed them over to the\n\n13 so-called Serb military police on the 15th of April. \"Have you got more\n\n14 weapons?\" they asked me, and I said, \"Please search the apartment. If you\n\n15 find any weapons, you kill me.\" And this Pipovic said that he knew me and\n\n16 that he didn't want to go and search the apartment.\n\n17 And I asked, \"Would you like to have a drink?\" and they said that\n\n18 I should bring a drink out to them there in the staircase. I brought them\n\n19 drinks, they had a drink, and they left.\n\n20 I watched from the window, from behind the curtain. They got out\n\n21 of the building, all four of them. And in the meantime, from the\n\n22 direction of the army building, a few luxury cars appeared and on them it\n\n23 said \"Military Police.\" They stopped there in front of Ribarsko.\n\n24 Dragan Cosovic, nicknamed Cosa, got out of the first car. Later\n\n25 on I found out is that he was the commander of this military police. And\n\nPage 1068\n\n1 I saw that he called to these four guys who were at my place and said\n\n2 something to them, and then two of them returned later, pointed at my\n\n3 building, and two out of the four returned to my place again. They came\n\n4 to my door and said, \"We're sorry, but you have to come with us to give a\n\n5 statement.\"\n\n6 Q. And where did they take you?\n\n7 A. They took me into a white Golf car in front of the entranceway,\n\n8 and they said that they were taking me to the SUP, to the police, to make\n\n9 a statement. However, when I asked whether I had to get ready, they said,\n\n10 \"No, no, you will be coming back immediately. You're just supposed to\n\n11 make a statement and then you'll go straight back home.\" However, when I\n\n12 got into the car, they did not go to the police at all, they did not go in\n\n13 that direction. They went across the bridge.\n\n14 I kept silent in the car. Then they took me to the KP Dom, to in\n\n15 front of the KP Dom -- to the KP Dom.\n\n16 Q. And how long did you stay at the KP Dom?\n\n17 A. Two and a half years.\n\n18 Q. Did they ever tell you why you were arrested?\n\n19 A. You know the way it was. Everybody who was brought to the KP Dom\n\n20 had to make a statement, some kind of a statement, had to be\n\n21 interrogated. When I was brought, I was put into a room -- am I supposed\n\n22 to tell you about that as well?\n\n23 Q. I would like to know first. Have you ever been charged or\n\n24 convicted?\n\n25 A. No, no.\n\nPage 1069\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1070\n\n1 Q. Let's now move on into the KP Dom. When you arrived, who received\n\n2 you?\n\n3 A. When we arrived in front of the entrance of the KP Dom, one of\n\n4 these guys who was in the car got out and said to the driver - I mean both\n\n5 of them were in camouflage uniforms - he said that I should stay in the\n\n6 car until he went to the administration to see something. He stayed there\n\n7 for about five minutes and then he came back and he ordered me to get out\n\n8 of the car. I got out of the car. There was a group of men there at the\n\n9 entrance in front of the front door. I noticed Cedo Skipin; he was\n\n10 president of the court in Foca. And said -- he addressed me by my name\n\n11 and he said, \"How come you're here?\" And I said, \"Well, they brought me\n\n12 to make some kind of statement.\" He turned to the other side, and then I\n\n13 was taken through this detector.\n\n14 I had two packs of cigarettes in my pockets, and I passed through\n\n15 this other gate, the metal gate. A guard was there, the former guard of\n\n16 the KP Dom, Veljko Kovac, and he told me to go there to the compound. He\n\n17 opened the door for me and he said that I should report to Slavko Koroman.\n\n18 Yes.\n\n19 Q. Did you report to Mr. Koroman? And what did he tell you?\n\n20 A. Yes, I did. When I got into this compound where these buildings\n\n21 are for prisoners, I looked around. It's a big compound. And over there\n\n22 in front of the dining hall I saw Slavko Koroman because I knew him. And\n\n23 I started walking towards him. However, from both buildings people\n\n24 started coming to the windows because as soon as they'd bring someone in,\n\n25 people would gather around the windows to see who had been brought in. I\n\nPage 1071\n\n1 got lost then.\n\n2 I saw this Koroman. I started walking towards him. He saw me\n\n3 going there and then he started approaching me too, and he said, \"How come\n\n4 you're here?\" and I said to him, \"Well, yes, to make a statement.\" And he\n\n5 said, \"This is no good. This is no good that they've brought you here.\"\n\n6 Q. Did he tell you why it would not be good to be brought there?\n\n7 A. No, no, nothing. He said, \"I have to put you up in a room.\" \"What\n\n8 kind of room?\" He stood and looked at me and he said, \"The best\n\n9 would be for me to put you into Room 15. It's the sunniest of all.\"\n\n10 That's the only thing he told me.\n\n11 Q. Room 15, where was it in the building? Do you recall which floor\n\n12 it was?\n\n13 A. The third floor. It was on the third floor, in the first\n\n14 building.\n\n15 Q. When you say \"third floor,\" do you mean the top floor?\n\n16 A. Yes, yes. In that place, it's the highest one of them all.\n\n17 Q. How long did you stay in Room 15?\n\n18 A. I stayed until the autumn, sometime around October, I think.\n\n19 Q. And where were you taken then?\n\n20 A. Then the guard came once and told me to collect my things and to\n\n21 go to this other building, to number 18.\n\n22 Q. And Room 18, on which floor was this room; do you recall?\n\n23 A. Second floor.\n\n24 Q. How long did you stay in number 18?\n\n25 A. I stayed there -- I think I stayed there until the summer 1993.\n\nPage 1072\n\n1 Q. Let me just clarify something. When you say \"second floor,\" do\n\n2 you mean the floor above the ground floor or do you mean the ground floor,\n\n3 first floor --\n\n4 JUDGE HUNT: We've got a bigger problem than that because this\n\n5 building had something called the ground floor and then there was a floor\n\n6 underneath it. It really should not be difficult to sort this one out\n\n7 with a leading question, unless there's some real dispute about it. He's\n\n8 been using what I would call the American system so far, if you count the\n\n9 basement as the basement. But because the building -- how about a\n\n10 photograph?\n\n11 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. I'm having this photograph now and want\n\n12 to put it to the witness so that he can show us all the rooms he was in.\n\n13 With the help of -- oh, the usher is gone. It's the photograph\n\n14 7512 of Exhibit 18.\n\n15 THE REGISTRAR: Do you want me to leave it on the ELMO?\n\n16 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes.\n\n17 Q. Would you please look at the upper photo and show us first, where\n\n18 was the Room 15?\n\n19 A. Number 15 was over here, between the first and second building.\n\n20 Over here on the corner. Here.\n\n21 Q. So that means it's not the top floor, it's actually the third\n\n22 floor counting the basement as the first.\n\n23 A. Yes. The third floor, and then up here was the prison clinic, the\n\n24 prison hospital, as it was called, up here.\n\n25 Q. Witness, to clarify it, would you please put the pointer on Room\n\nPage 1073\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1074\n\n1 15 so that we can see which floor you mean.\n\n2 JUDGE HUNT: It's not a very good photograph for that, is it,\n\n3 because it's behind a tree.\n\n4 A. You can't see 15. You can't. It's in the corner here between\n\n5 this other building and this first building. In the corner here, you\n\n6 can't see those windows. It would be here.\n\n7 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes, Your Honour, but I think it's clear that\n\n8 he pointed on the second floor above the ground floor. And we don't\n\n9 have -- actually, we don't have a better photo than this one. But I think\n\n10 it's clear.\n\n11 JUDGE HUNT: I understood him to be saying that Room 15 was on the\n\n12 floor below the medical rooms. Now, if I've misunderstood it, perhaps we\n\n13 better sort it out. But he was on -- not the top floor, but the one below\n\n14 the top floor.\n\n15 A. Yes, below. Let me show you here. In the basement was Room 12,\n\n16 and then above it was 14, and above it was 15.\n\n17 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n18 Q. Yes, thank you. Would you now point out to us where Room 18 was?\n\n19 A. Over here.\n\n20 Q. Would you please use the same photo, 7512. I think it's easier to\n\n21 show it there.\n\n22 A. It's over here.\n\n23 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. The witness is pointing at the first\n\n24 floor above the basement.\n\n25 JUDGE HUNT: No, he's not. It depends on what you call --\n\nPage 1075\n\n1 A. No, no.\n\n2 JUDGE HUNT: To me --\n\n3 A. The basement is here.\n\n4 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you, yes. You go ahead, sir.\n\n5 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes.\n\n6 Q. And into which room were you taken after being in Room 18?\n\n7 A. After number 18, we were transferred here, to 16, and then 13. We\n\n8 were then returned to this building again.\n\n9 Q. And Room 16, that's directly below 18; is that right?\n\n10 A. Yes.\n\n11 Q. And the Room 13, you mentioned it's above 11; is that right?\n\n12 A. Yes, yes, that's right.\n\n13 Q. Okay.\n\n14 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: We can put the photo away.\n\n15 Q. When you arrived in Room 15, were there already other detainees\n\n16 there?\n\n17 A. Yes. The room was full.\n\n18 Q. How many were there?\n\n19 A. Well, that's a smaller room. Those are the smallest rooms, 14 and\n\n20 15. There were about 40 men there.\n\n21 Q. You say \"men.\" Does that mean there were only male people in this\n\n22 room?\n\n23 A. Yes, and a five-year-old girl.\n\n24 Q. How did the five-year-old girl get there, into KP Dom?\n\n25 A. Well, they captured her father at home. He could not leave her at\n\nPage 1076\n\n1 home so he brought her with him.\n\n2 Q. Was there enough space for these 40 people in the room?\n\n3 A. Well, some of those who happened to be there took the beds;\n\n4 others, on the floor. That's the way it was.\n\n5 Q. What ethnicity did the people have in Room -- in your room?\n\n6 A. All of them were Muslims.\n\n7 Q. You mentioned already the little girl. What age were the people\n\n8 in the room? Who was the eldest, for instance?\n\n9 A. Well, she was five years old, and then up to the age of 70 or 80,\n\n10 there were persons of that age.\n\n11 Q. Did you know these people from before?\n\n12 A. I knew most of them.\n\n13 Q. Were these people civilians?\n\n14 A. All of them were civilians. Civilians only. Not a single one was\n\n15 a -- not a single one was a military man. I mean, nobody wore a uniform.\n\n16 All were brought from their homes.\n\n17 Q. What state of health were these people in? Were there any sick\n\n18 people among you?\n\n19 A. Yes, there were. There were. There were people they brought from\n\n20 hospitals in pyjamas who were lying in hospital beds before that, and they\n\n21 brought them there straight from there. Juso Cebo was a man who had a\n\n22 lung condition and who had spent a long time in hospital, and that's the\n\n23 way they brought him to the KP Dom. There were also mentally disturbed\n\n24 people; there were disabled persons; there were elderly persons.\n\n25 Q. You mentioned already that you could see when you arrived that\n\nPage 1077\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1078\n\n1 there were other people in other rooms. Could you estimate how many\n\n2 detainees were there altogether in the first few months?\n\n3 A. Well, we could only count when we were going to the canteen, and\n\n4 people would stand at the windows and count, although it was forbidden to\n\n5 stand at the window. But people did it somehow and did the counting and\n\n6 then made their calculations on a piece of paper. The number varied; it\n\n7 was never the same. Some people were brought in; other people were taken\n\n8 away. And when we did the calculations, there would be about 800 people.\n\n9 Q. Did you know many of these people?\n\n10 A. I knew a lot of them.\n\n11 Q. And were they civilians, or were soldiers among them or fighters?\n\n12 A. All of them were civilians, except in 1993, they brought one man\n\n13 from Rogoj who had been captured there, and he was in uniform.\n\n14 Q. Were there any women and children detained in the KP Dom?\n\n15 A. Yes, there were, but they kept them there for only a short time.\n\n16 Q. Beside the prisoner rooms you have mentioned, were also detainees\n\n17 kept in other rooms?\n\n18 A. Yes, in solitary cells, the so-called solitaries, as they called\n\n19 them.\n\n20 Q. Could you estimate how many detainees were kept in those isolation\n\n21 cells?\n\n22 A. Those who had been in isolation cells and were later released back\n\n23 to their rooms would tell us that there had been 13 to 15 people in an\n\n24 isolation cell at a time. They couldn't sit down; there was standing room\n\n25 only. And there were people who had spent months in isolation cells.\n\nPage 1079\n\n1 Q. Were you ever taken into an isolation cell yourself?\n\n2 A. No.\n\n3 Q. What kind of detainees were kept in the isolation cells?\n\n4 A. Well, usually when they brought people in just before dark, they\n\n5 would keep them in isolation cells before they -- before taking a\n\n6 statement from them.\n\n7 Q. When you looked out of the window of Room 15, at what did you\n\n8 look? What could you see?\n\n9 A. Well, we could see the administration building where they took us\n\n10 to the so-called interrogations, and we could see those rooms where they\n\n11 took people and where we all had to go to those interrogations. From that\n\n12 room you can see the entrance of the compound to the administration\n\n13 building and the administration building itself.\n\n14 Q. I would like to show you two photos; that is, photo 7477 first,\n\n15 and I would like you to tell us if that was about the view you had.\n\n16 If you look at the bottom photo, would that be the view you had\n\n17 from Room 15, about? About.\n\n18 A. Yes. That was precisely the view we had, and we could see this\n\n19 part as well.\n\n20 Q. When you see the three --\n\n21 A. No, no, sorry. This is the warehouse.\n\n22 Q. Just look at the bottom photo.\n\n23 JUDGE HUNT: Microphone.\n\n24 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes.\n\n25 Q. Please look only at the bottom photo. These three windows that\n\nPage 1080\n\n1 you see on the ground floor next to this metal door, left from the metal\n\n2 door, what kind of rooms were they; do you know? What kind of rooms were\n\n3 they?\n\n4 A. Before the war, those were visitation rooms used for visits to\n\n5 inmates. And later this is where our people, the Muslims, were taken to\n\n6 be interrogated and maltreated.\n\n7 Q. We'll come to this later on. I would like you to look at another\n\n8 photo now, and it's the photo 7472. Please have a look at this photo, and\n\n9 can you tell us if -- from Room 15, could you see the Drina River, or were\n\n10 you below?\n\n11 A. No, we could not see the Drina.\n\n12 Q. Yes, thank you. Witness, are you familiar with the KP Dom? Did\n\n13 you ever visit it before the war?\n\n14 A. Yes, I had been there several times in the administration\n\n15 building, not anywhere else.\n\n16 Q. Have you ever been in the room of the warden?\n\n17 A. Yes.\n\n18 Q. Can you tell us where the room of the warden was? Which floor,\n\n19 for instance?\n\n20 A. I think it was the second floor. There is a ground floor, then\n\n21 another floor, and this was on the floor above, the second floor.\n\n22 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: With the help of the usher, I would like to\n\n23 show the witness the floor plan 6/3. Can you put it the other way\n\n24 around. Could you turn it. No, it's okay. Sorry.\n\n25 Q. This is supposed to be the second floor. Can you show us the\n\nPage 1081\n\n1 warden's room?\n\n2 A. This is it.\n\n3 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The witness is pointing at the big room --\n\n4 JUDGE HUNT: The witness is pointing at the room that everybody\n\n5 else has identified as the warden's room. I don't think that this is\n\n6 really in dispute.\n\n7 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The only problem is that we sometimes have\n\n8 witnesses who say they met the warden in a different room.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: Oh, yes, that's quite different to \"What was the\n\n10 warden's room?\" Everybody, I think, has agreed that that is the warden's\n\n11 office, if that is the right word for it.\n\n12 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Okay. Thank you.\n\n13 Q. Witness, were there guards in the KP Dom while you were detained\n\n14 there? And if so, who were they?\n\n15 A. When I was brought there, only the former guards, security people,\n\n16 of the KP Dom worked there.\n\n17 Q. What did they wear and how were they armed?\n\n18 A. In the beginning there was a great diversity - some were in\n\n19 camouflage uniforms; some were in other uniforms; some were in civilian\n\n20 clothes - but later they all wore police uniforms. And as to how they\n\n21 were armed, they had automatic rifles, pistols; some of them carried\n\n22 knives, and all of them had clubs, batons; some of them even had bombs on\n\n23 them.\n\n24 Q. And did you ever see a machine-gun in the KP Dom?\n\n25 A. Yes, I saw a machine-gun on the -- at the window of the\n\nPage 1082\n\n1 administration building.\n\n2 Q. Which part of the administration building, the right wing or the\n\n3 left wing when you look at it from your room, number 15?\n\n4 A. In the left wing.\n\n5 Q. On which floor?\n\n6 A. Second floor.\n\n7 Q. Was the compound mined while you were detained there?\n\n8 A. Yes, the entire compound was mined, and we saw them laying the\n\n9 mines from the windows.\n\n10 Q. When was that done, and who did it?\n\n11 A. That was in May, the mining. I recognised three of the mining\n\n12 squad; that was Miodrag Vracar, who earlier worked in the municipal\n\n13 assembly; Zelimir Troje, who had been a lecturer in a school, in a\n\n14 secondary school; and Bozo Sain, who was a mechanic in an auto repair\n\n15 shop. And there were a couple of other people whom I didn't know.\n\n16 Q. Were they soldiers at that time? Were they wearing uniforms?\n\n17 A. Yes, they were wearing uniforms, soldiers' uniforms.\n\n18 Q. Were only Muslims detained in KP Dom or people of other ethnicity?\n\n19 A. There were others too. We had Croats with us, and in other rooms\n\n20 there were Serbs as well.\n\n21 Q. How many Serbs were detained in the KP Dom, and where were they\n\n22 detained?\n\n23 A. They kept them in building 2, and I don't know how many because I\n\n24 don't know the number. Sometimes there would be a lot of them and\n\n25 sometimes the number would be smaller.\n\nPage 1083\n\n1 Q. Were they kept separate from the Muslims and Croats?\n\n2 A. In the room, yes.\n\n3 Q. Do you know in which room the Serbs were kept, which number this\n\n4 room had?\n\n5 A. While we were in Room 18, they were in Room 21. And there was\n\n6 only a staircase between us.\n\n7 Q. And what kind of persons were these Serb prisoners? Were they\n\n8 convicts or were they normal people?\n\n9 A. There were civilians among them, but most of them were in\n\n10 uniforms.\n\n11 Q. What kind of living conditions did they have? Were you able to\n\n12 tell?\n\n13 A. As for accommodation, I believe their situation was similar to\n\n14 ours, although they had more blankets and they had bed sheets; most of us\n\n15 didn't. They would have more bedding in the winter than we. The food was\n\n16 much better -- their food was much better. Our food was prepared\n\n17 outdoors, in a big cauldron, and we would get our rations in small dishes\n\n18 in which former inmates got their salads, and that was the amount of our\n\n19 rations.\n\n20 Q. How do you know that the Serbs got more -- the Serb prisoners got\n\n21 more than you? Could you see it, or how do you know?\n\n22 A. Well, I could see that. They prepared food for them inside, in\n\n23 the kitchen, and even humanitarian aid would arrive sometimes. They would\n\n24 unload the foodstuffs into the storage room. Below Room 16 there was a\n\n25 big storage room there. Our people, Muslims, would be taken there to\n\nPage 1084\n\n1 unload. And food was prepared for them from the foodstuffs from the\n\n2 humanitarian aid, and we would get cabbage. And everyone lost from 20 to\n\n3 40 kilos in the first couple of months. I lost 31 kilos in that period.\n\n4 I couldn't stand on my feet; I fainted several times.\n\n5 Q. And when you say \"we,\" you mean the detainees, the Muslims and the\n\n6 Croats, and not the Serbs; is that what we have to understand?\n\n7 A. Yes, that's what I mean.\n\n8 Q. What about the conditions in winter? You already mentioned that\n\n9 the Serbs had more blankets. How were the conditions of the other\n\n10 detainees during the winter, especially the first winter?\n\n11 A. It was terrible that first winter because there were no window\n\n12 panes. Most of them were broken. For a long time we were in those rooms.\n\n13 We were not able to get warm. They had taken away our blankets, all but\n\n14 one thin blanket, and the winter was horribly harsh. Nutrition was bad.\n\n15 People had very bad and little clothing. People started to get swellings\n\n16 on their hands and feet that winter. And for awhile people started to cut\n\n17 blankets to make pullovers and sweaters. They would hide them under their\n\n18 sheets and make gloves. The guards found out about that and there was a\n\n19 raid one day. Everyone who was caught having that sort of thing was taken\n\n20 to isolation cells where the conditions were even worse.\n\n21 Q. These conditions, did they --\n\n22 THE INTERPRETER: Microphone, please.\n\n23 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n24 Q. These conditions, did they affect your health? Besides what you\n\n25 have already mentioned, that is, the loss of weight and the swollen ...\n\nPage 1085\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1086\n\n1 A. Until the war started, I was a very healthy man, I had never been\n\n2 to see a doctor my whole life. But later, due to the fear and horrors\n\n3 that I experienced in that prison, and the conditions, I got very sick.\n\n4 I'm ill most of the time. I go to doctors and hospitals often.\n\n5 Q. What kind of illness did you get?\n\n6 A. Well, I got diabetes; inflammation of nerves in the leg and in my\n\n7 back.\n\n8 Q. While you were in the KP Dom, was medical care available to the\n\n9 detainees?\n\n10 A. Occasionally. A doctor would come from the hospital. People\n\n11 would apply to the guards, but not everyone who applied could get to see\n\n12 the doctor. In the beginning a gynaecologist would come, Cedo Dragovic;\n\n13 and then after him a radiologist, Milovan Dobrilovic; then a general\n\n14 practitioner, Biljana Stankovic; then also Slobodanka Perovic, and so on.\n\n15 Q. Did anyone die due to the conditions in the KP Dom? Do you recall\n\n16 anybody? I mean the living conditions, not the other things.\n\n17 A. Yes. First, a group of people was brought in from Montenegro,\n\n18 from Herceg-Novi where they were captured. Those people had fled from\n\n19 military operations before the war, they had fled to Montenegro, and\n\n20 that's where they were captured and brought a busful of them to the\n\n21 prison.\n\n22 Among them was a young man. His name was Esad Hadzic, whose ulcer\n\n23 burst in his stomach. He had an ulcer perforation; he was in terrible\n\n24 pain when he died. Then I also know that Juso Dzamalija hanged himself in\n\n25 an isolation cell. Sefko Kubat died; Ibraham Sandal died. Omer Kunovac\n\nPage 1087\n\n1 died; he was deaf and mute and they kept beating him. Although he\n\n2 couldn't speak, they wanted him to answer their questions, but he was deaf\n\n3 and mute. I know about that.\n\n4 An old woman died. She was isolated with two children and an\n\n5 elderly man in Room 11, when it had been emptied, and they found them\n\n6 somewhere, this old woman, two children, and a man, from somewhere in the\n\n7 village of Godjeno, and that's where this woman died.\n\n8 Q. You mentioned Esad Hadzic. When did he die?\n\n9 A. He died in June 1993 -- 1992, sorry.\n\n10 Q. And did he request medical help or did anyone request medical help\n\n11 for him when his ulcer burst?\n\n12 A. Yes. People from his room begged the guards to take him somewhere\n\n13 or to give him medicine, but nothing -- nothing ever came of that and he\n\n14 died in the room.\n\n15 Q. You mentioned that woman. When did she die, and of what?\n\n16 A. I don't know why she died, but she was a very old woman. And that\n\n17 first winter, 1992/1993, she was in that huge room without heating. We\n\n18 could see when food was brought to them in those small dishes. And one\n\n19 day she was just wrapped in a blanket, put on a freight vehicle and taken\n\n20 away somewhere.\n\n21 Q. And Sefko Kubat, when did he die, and of what?\n\n22 A. Well, for a long time he suffered from a stomach ulcer. He was a\n\n23 thin man, but he worked the whole time, until he was in such pain that he\n\n24 couldn't work anymore. Then he was taken to a hospital for a surgery, and\n\n25 three or four days later he was brought back in the state in which he was,\n\nPage 1088\n\n1 and he died there.\n\n2 Q. Do you recall when that was?\n\n3 A. I think it was the summer of 1994, around that time. I can't say\n\n4 exactly.\n\n5 Q. And you mentioned Omer Kunovac. Of what did he die?\n\n6 A. Kunovac. From beatings. People that were in the room with him\n\n7 said that he died from the beatings, and he was completely deaf and mute.\n\n8 Q. And when did he die?\n\n9 A. In 1993.\n\n10 Q. And you mentioned Ibrahim Sandal. When did he die, and why?\n\n11 A. When he was brought into the prison, he was unable to stand on his\n\n12 feet. He was black and blue and swollen all over his body. He would --\n\n13 he never wished to talk about where he had been beaten and by whom. He\n\n14 was unable to go to the canteen, although the guards would force him, and\n\n15 he would go on all fours to the canteen; he had to. But he laid the whole\n\n16 time. And one morning they came to wake him up to go to breakfast but he\n\n17 was already dead.\n\n18 Q. Yes, thank you. While detained in these two and a half years,\n\n19 were you always locked in the room or could you also go out for walks in\n\n20 the yard?\n\n21 A. For ten months I couldn't get out of my room, they wouldn't let\n\n22 me. For a full ten months I was able to go only to the canteen and back.\n\n23 Q. Was that only you, or was that the general conditions for all the\n\n24 detainees?\n\n25 A. Some were taken out to work; some were in the labour platoon. But\n\nPage 1089\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1090\n\n1 most of us were not allowed out of the room.\n\n2 Q. Did you have family visits while you were detained?\n\n3 A. Yes. Two or three times my wife came. By mid-May, that is when\n\n4 visits were forbidden. In mid-May, all visits were forbidden.\n\n5 Q. When your wife visited you, did she need to have permission? And\n\n6 if so, where did she get it?\n\n7 A. No, she didn't need a permit. It depended on the guards, whether\n\n8 they would let her in and whether they would call me so we could see each\n\n9 other. Mostly they would come to the gate. They would ask, they would\n\n10 plead, they would ask whether they could see us. If someone would let\n\n11 them in, then we could see each other.\n\n12 Q. Do you know who made this decision? Was it just the guard?\n\n13 A. I don't know that. It could have been the guard; it could have\n\n14 been someone else. I'm not sure.\n\n15 Q. Did you get letters from your family in these two and a half\n\n16 years?\n\n17 A. After a year and a half -- I mean during the first year and a\n\n18 half, I did not know at all where my wife and children were, where my\n\n19 mother was.\n\n20 Q. What effect did that have on you?\n\n21 A. Well, for most of us, had it not been for the iron bars on the\n\n22 windows, half of us would have jumped out of the window. It killed us\n\n23 psychologically.\n\n24 Q. Were you beaten at KP Dom?\n\n25 A. No, no, never.\n\nPage 1091\n\n1 Q. Did you see other detainees being beaten?\n\n2 A. Yes, yes, I saw that. I saw that. In the room, two or three\n\n3 times they would beat these detained persons, and in the rooms downstairs\n\n4 in particular.\n\n5 Q. Let me clarify. Do you mean in Room 15 itself?\n\n6 A. Yes. I saw it there too.\n\n7 Q. When did this happen? Do you recall when you saw detainees being\n\n8 beaten in your room?\n\n9 A. These were not any big beatings in the room. Usually they were\n\n10 taken to the administration, into the solitary confinement cells; that's\n\n11 where they did the big beatings. This was just beating in passing. If\n\n12 somebody asked a guard something, then he'd hit him twice or three times\n\n13 and then he'd go out and say, \"No more talking.\"\n\n14 (redacted)\n\n15 (redacted)\n\n16 (redacted)? Is my house still there?\" And then he beat him up.\n\n17 Then Halim Corovic, an elderly man, was beaten, and then Ekrem Zekovic.\n\n18 That's what I saw in the room.\n\n19 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, the witness just mentioned the\n\n20 beating of Smajo Bacvic, and it's Schedule A-1.\n\n21 Q. Who else was beaten in your room? We're speaking now first about\n\n22 beatings in your room. Was there anybody else?\n\n23 A. Yes. Not in the room. Not in the room.\n\n24 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Objection.\n\n25 JUDGE HUNT: Yes, Mr. Bakrac.\n\nPage 1092\n\n1 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, the witness just said\n\n2 that there weren't any beatings but that these were just -- these were\n\n3 just people who were sort of hit in passing, and the Prosecutor keeps\n\n4 asking about beatings. And I think that the witness distinguished between\n\n5 this.\n\n6 JUDGE HUNT: The witness said there were not any big beatings in\n\n7 the room, and he also said that there were just beatings in passing. I\n\n8 don't see the problem of calling them beatings. We know what he means,\n\n9 and the description of them will probably bear out that limitation. But\n\n10 there's nothing wrong with the question.\n\n11 You proceed, Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff.\n\n12 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n13 Q. Do you recall any other particular incidents of beating of this --\n\n14 let's call it lighter beating, in the room, in the prisoners' quarters?\n\n15 A. I mentioned this Halim Corovic. He was also beaten up there in\n\n16 the room. Then Ekrem Zekovic was beaten in the compound when we were\n\n17 going out for lunch. Predrag Stefanovic beat him in front of all of us.\n\n18 Q. Do you recall Halim Corovic - that's the incident Schedule A,\n\n19 number 4 - do you recall who beat Halim?\n\n20 A. I cannot recall now.\n\n21 Q. Was a certain Muharem Cosovic in your room?\n\n22 A. Yes, yes, in number 15.\n\n23 Q. And did anything happen to him?\n\n24 A. He was taken out of the room and beaten twice while his little\n\n25 girl stayed with us in the room.\n\nPage 1093\n\n1 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: This is the incident, Schedule A, number 2.\n\n2 Q. And do you recall when this occurred?\n\n3 A. Well, it could have been the month of May 1992.\n\n4 Q. And you said that that did not only happen in your room but also\n\n5 in other rooms. How do you know that?\n\n6 A. Well, I know because later people were mixed. I mean, they were\n\n7 being transferred from one room to another and everybody talked about what\n\n8 they had seen in their previous room, and the other people talked about\n\n9 what they had seen in their rooms previously, and that's the way it was.\n\n10 Q. You have already mentioned the big beatings, what you call the big\n\n11 beatings. Can you describe what that was?\n\n12 A. These guards, usually two of them or one of them would come into\n\n13 the room and then we would watch them. As they would come from the gate,\n\n14 when the metal gate would open, we would watch them, wondering what\n\n15 building they would go to, because we were in great fear. When he'd enter\n\n16 the building, he'd usually have a small list in his hands, and then we\n\n17 kept watching, and every room was in anticipation, wondering which\n\n18 building he is going to go into, which room. Let's say he first went into\n\n19 number 12 or number 14 or number 13, and then he went from one room to\n\n20 the another and called out persons' names. The main thing was that he'd\n\n21 have a list of these people whose names he'd call out. Then people would\n\n22 follow him. He'd lock up the room and then he'd take these people to the\n\n23 gate. We would watch them and we would see them standing in front of the\n\n24 gate. And then usually he would bring two or three into the\n\n25 administration building and the others would remain in front of the gate,\n\nPage 1094\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1095\n\n1 waiting.\n\n2 Soon after that, it would get noisy in these rooms, in these\n\n3 visitation rooms. There weren't any glass panes on the windows. Whoever\n\n4 had the courage to listen could hear what was going on; however, most of\n\n5 us put pillows on our ears so we couldn't hear these cries and moans\n\n6 and screams. Few people were returned to rooms after these tortures; most\n\n7 were not returned.\n\n8 Q. When you say \"he,\" do you mean a particular guard who took the\n\n9 detainees out all the time, or is \"he\" just meant for many guards?\n\n10 A. They worked in shifts. It depended on the day who was on which\n\n11 shift, and then that person would take people out. Whereas the others --\n\n12 I mean, there were people there whom we noticed really took this out on\n\n13 people. They behaved as if they could hardly wait to take them out to be\n\n14 beaten. They would walk through the compound, you know, with their batons\n\n15 like this. They would whistle and they would take people away that way.\n\n16 They would carry these wooden legs of chairs, cables, all sorts of\n\n17 things.\n\n18 JUDGE HUNT: Can we have some description of what he was doing?\n\n19 It was very difficult to see.\n\n20 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. The witness was moving his hand as if\n\n21 he had a baton in the hand and as if he --\n\n22 A. Yes. I said, you know a baton -- for example, when they would\n\n23 take a group out for this interrogation, then usually from the other\n\n24 building or from the factory or from the dining hall where they were, then\n\n25 these guards would probably -- most often withdraw and go towards the\n\nPage 1096\n\n1 administration building. And then I would say that -- then as I said, for\n\n2 example, Milenko Burilo, who did horrible things there, he would usually\n\n3 carry a wooden leg of a chair, and there was a leather band on it and he\n\n4 would put it around his wrist, and then he would go to the administration\n\n5 building and then all hell would break loose in those premises where they\n\n6 took the people. There were some guards who really took it out on people,\n\n7 and we had the impression that they could hardly wait to beat someone and\n\n8 to beat someone up over there.\n\n9 Q. Witness, you mentioned already the guard Milenko Burilo. Can you\n\n10 tell us names of other guards who behaved in such a manner?\n\n11 A. I can. As far as I could see, as far as we could see, Dragomir\n\n12 Obrenovic was among them, Vlatko Pljevaljcic, Vitomir Micevic, Jovo Savic,\n\n13 Predrag Stefanovic, Zoran Matovic, Radovan Vukovic, et cetera.\n\n14 Q. At what time of the day were detainees taken out in this manner?\n\n15 A. Usually in the afternoon, and it would last until the evening,\n\n16 until 9.00 or 10.00.\n\n17 Q. I know it's difficult to remember after such a long time, but are\n\n18 you able to say at what hour in the afternoon?\n\n19 A. Well, it depends. When we would hear a vehicle that had a\n\n20 characteristic sound, it was a smallish kombi van, when it would arrive in\n\n21 front of the administration building - and there was probably something\n\n22 wrong with the exhaust pipe and they did this on purpose, they did it on\n\n23 purpose - when we would hear this, then we would know that the beatings\n\n24 and the severe beatings would start. And they always threatened us with\n\n25 some kind of military police. If somebody would not admit something,\n\nPage 1097\n\n1 confess something that they were charging him with, then they would\n\n2 threaten him with the military police, saying that if this person would\n\n3 not confess, they would call in the military police, and that it would not\n\n4 go well after that.\n\n5 Q. Witness, but do you recall, was it in the early afternoon or late\n\n6 afternoon that this happened?\n\n7 A. Well, it depends. Sometimes earlier; sometimes later. It wasn't\n\n8 specific.\n\n9 Q. And you mentioned the list -- the guard had a list. Can you\n\n10 describe the list, what it was, what it looked like?\n\n11 A. Well, it was just a little piece of paper with people's names on\n\n12 it. We could not walk up to him to see what it said there. We saw that\n\n13 he had a piece of paper in his hands and that he was reading names from\n\n14 it.\n\n15 Q. You mentioned that you could hear these horrible noises from the\n\n16 visitors' rooms, which you have previously pointed out to us. Could you\n\n17 hear anything particular? So that you could, for instance, hear who was\n\n18 being beaten or who was beating?\n\n19 A. We could not come to such conclusions who was doing the beating,\n\n20 who was beating these men. There was commotion, general commotion, and\n\n21 there were cries, there were screams. You could not recognise voices.\n\n22 Q. Could you hear anything that let you conclude who was being beaten\n\n23 at that time?\n\n24 A. We only heard once when they took Zulfo Veiz out, who had been a\n\n25 policeman before the war in the city police, the town police, and we only\n\nPage 1098\n\n1 heard them say to him, \"Well, Veiz, tell us now how many Serbs had you\n\n2 beaten?\" And we didn't understand anything after that. That's when they\n\n3 started beating him. We could not discern anything else, because several\n\n4 people were hitting him and the others. It wasn't that it was one man or\n\n5 two.\n\n6 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honours, the witness is referring to\n\n7 Zulfo Veiz who is mentioned under C-29 [sic], Schedule C, and he's also\n\n8 mentioned in the count of the indictment -- in the incident, 5.27.\n\n9 Q. Witness, Zulfo Veiz, was he taken out only once or several times?\n\n10 A. Several times. He was taken to the administration building\n\n11 several times. And there was nothing noticeable on him, that he had been\n\n12 beaten, until the last time when he didn't return after that. The first\n\n13 few times he was taken out in the evening hours, in the afternoon hours.\n\n14 Allegedly he said that some of his colleagues, his former colleagues,\n\n15 Serbs, came to see him, and once he even mentioned some kind of exchange,\n\n16 that he would be exchanged for some policeman in Gorazde and that he did\n\n17 not want to accept that. Later they took him out, they started beating\n\n18 him, and he never returned.\n\n19 Q. Was he in Room 15, Zulfo Veiz?\n\n20 A. Yes, he was. Yes, he was.\n\n21 Q. You said that you could not see injuries on him when he returned\n\n22 these several times. Did he tell you that he was beaten?\n\n23 A. No, he never said that. It would have been obvious on him. He\n\n24 said that they did not beat him then.\n\n25 Q. And this last time, do you recall when you saw him for the last\n\nPage 1099\n\n1 time being led away and when you heard someone speaking to him?\n\n2 A. I remember that. How could I not remember?\n\n3 Q. No. I mean when. Do you know when that was, that last time when\n\n4 he did not return?\n\n5 A. Well, it was June 1992. I'm not that sure about the date.\n\n6 Perhaps I'll make a mistake, but I can't -- I mean, July or August, but\n\n7 it's July most probably. I can't be very accurate about this.\n\n8 Q. These big beatings, did they last -- how long did they last\n\n9 altogether? Over what period of time did they occur?\n\n10 A. Well, that lasted from May 1992 until October, these severe\n\n11 beatings and these exchanges of sorts. That is when most people were\n\n12 victims, in that period.\n\n13 Q. Was there any peak in this time period? Was there ever any\n\n14 particular time when this occurred the most? Do you recall anything?\n\n15 Maybe a month.\n\n16 A. Well, for example, this Vidovdan, on the 28th of June, that is\n\n17 when a large group was taken away. Then in September they were taken to\n\n18 pick plums allegedly. Then also this big exchange on the 30th of August,\n\n19 when they told us that there would be an exchange, when they separated\n\n20 people from the bus and half of them went missing. Things like that.\n\n21 Q. Witness, let's first stick with the beatings, and we'll come to\n\n22 the exchanges later.\n\n23 You said Vidovdan, the 28th of June, that was a particular day.\n\n24 What did you see on this day? How many people were led away, and to which\n\n25 part?\n\nPage 1100\n\n1 A. People's names were read out. They always brought some kind of\n\n2 lists from which they would read people's names and surnames. And then\n\n3 they would say to them, \"Get your things ready, whatever you have, and get\n\n4 out of the room.\" For example, from Room 15, they would take out five\n\n5 people; from another room they would take ten people out. That's the way\n\n6 it was done.\n\n7 Q. Did you ever hear shots in relation to beatings?\n\n8 A. Yes, yes, we heard them. When they took Zulfo Veiz and Kemal\n\n9 Dzelilovic, Fuad Mandzo, people like that. Some people even listened in\n\n10 the late evening hours, during the night, and they said that they heard\n\n11 bodies dropping into the river. However, most people hid away, trying not\n\n12 to hear this. We were never sure who would be next.\n\n13 Q. Witness, I had asked you if you ever heard shots and you said yes\n\n14 to this question. Did you --\n\n15 A. Yes, we did.\n\n16 Q. And did you ever -- do you recall how often you heard shots in\n\n17 relation to beatings?\n\n18 A. It wasn't often that one would hear shots.\n\n19 Q. And you have already mentioned -- on one occasion you mentioned\n\n20 Zulfo Veiz and Kemal Dzelilovic. That's the person on Schedule C, number\n\n21 7. Do you recall who else was taken together with these two? Do you\n\n22 recall anybody else?\n\n23 A. Fuad Mandzo, the two Rikalo brothers, Mato Ivancic. I can't\n\n24 remember it all now.\n\n25 Q. But does that relate to the shots you heard?\n\nPage 1101\n\n1 A. We heard the shots when they took Munib Veiz out. Not Zulfo,\n\n2 Munib. Who else was there? At any rate, five or six men were taken out,\n\n3 they were beaten up, and later shots were heard.\n\n4 Q. Munib Veiz, that's C-28 and B-29; and Fuad Mandzo is C-16.\n\n5 After you heard the shots, do you recall anything else?\n\n6 A. Well, that is when some people heard these thumps against the\n\n7 water. It sounded as if they had been thrown from the bridge into the\n\n8 Drina River.\n\n9 Q. Do you recall who else was taken out from your room in this\n\n10 manner?\n\n11 A. From Room 15, that is the room from which the least number of\n\n12 people was taken out compared to other rooms. However, Krajcin was taken\n\n13 out. Before the war he was head of finance in the mine. Then --\n\n14 Q. That's C-14.\n\n15 A. -- Murat Crneta was taken out; he was director of a factory. A\n\n16 boy from Gorazde was taken out, Said Kunduklija. A man from Srebrenica\n\n17 was taken out who was arrested in Montenegro; he was temporarily working\n\n18 in Montenegro. And there was this group of men from Srebrenica that was\n\n19 brought in, and from amongst them, one of them was assigned to Room 15.\n\n20 Things like that.\n\n21 Q. Was Halim Konjo in your room, number 15?\n\n22 A. No, he was not. He was in number 12.\n\n23 Q. Do you know what happened to him?\n\n24 A. He was also taken out. Allegedly he was killed immediately, on\n\n25 the spot, when he was being severely beaten. We heard his cries, and he\n\nPage 1102\n\n1 never returned.\n\n2 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Halim Konjo, that is B-33 and C-13.\n\n3 Q. Was Halim Konjo taken out only once and never returned, or did you\n\n4 see him --\n\n5 A. Yes. Yes, once. Once, once, I saw it once.\n\n6 Q. Was Nurko Nisic in your room?\n\n7 A. No. He was in number 12, in number 12, Room 12.\n\n8 Q. Do you know what happened to him?\n\n9 A. He was taken out several times and beaten, severely beaten. He\n\n10 could not even turn around at all. He and Mustafa Kuloglija, a teacher,\n\n11 they were beaten several times. Aziz Sahinovic as well. They never\n\n12 returned again.\n\n13 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Nurko Nisic, that is the incident 5.27 and\n\n14 C-19.\n\n15 Q. Did you see Nurko Nisic return and did see what injuries he had,\n\n16 or did you only hear about it?\n\n17 A. We saw him from the window when they were returning him. He was\n\n18 all swollen. He could hardly walk into the building from the gate. It\n\n19 was hard for him to move. He was all beaten up. Later on they took him\n\n20 out for this severe beating again and he was never returned.\n\n21 Q. You mentioned Mr. Sahinovic, did you see him --\n\n22 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: That's actually the incident 5.29, Your\n\n23 Honours.\n\n24 Q. Did you see him return, and did you see any injuries on him?\n\n25 A. Yes. He returned once and he was all beaten up then. And then he\n\nPage 1103\n\n1 was taken out again, because before the war he worked in a bank called\n\n2 Privredna Banka. He was an official in charge of some kind of foreign\n\n3 exchange transactions. And he told us that they had accused him of having\n\n4 taken some foreign currency. He said to us that he could not take it\n\n5 because it was down there in the safes. And then the third time -- I\n\n6 mean, the second time they took him over there to the bank, to where he\n\n7 had worked before. Then the third time, in the evening, sometime in the\n\n8 evening, they took him, sometime after 10.00 they called out his name, and\n\n9 he never returned either.\n\n10 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honours, it's 11.00.\n\n11 JUDGE HUNT: We'll adjourn until 11.30.\n\n12 --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.\n\n13 --- On resuming at 11.30 a.m.\n\n14 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, we have found a mistake in the\n\n15 transcript, and I probably misspoke. It's on page 3425 of the LiveNote,\n\n16 and in relation to Munib Veiz, the incident in the Schedule is B-59 and\n\n17 not B-29. That was a mistake.\n\n18 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you.\n\n19 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n20 Q. Witness, you have already mentioned Mr. Kuloglija. That's in\n\n21 Schedule C-15. What happened to Mr. Kuloglija? What do you know about\n\n22 it?\n\n23 A. I knew him for many years before the war. He was a teacher in a\n\n24 primary school called Ivanko [phoen]. And he was said to have had a fight\n\n25 with a Serb in the tavern before the war and the story circulated in the\n\nPage 1104\n\n1 town. He was then imprisoned in KP Dom, and he was taken out several\n\n2 times and beaten. He came, beaten up, back to the room twice, and the\n\n3 third time they took him away to another beating and he never returned.\n\n4 Q. And you also mentioned Fuad Mandzo - that is number C-16 - what\n\n5 happened to Mr. Fuad Mandzo?\n\n6 A. He was in Room 14. This is a young man who was allegedly captured\n\n7 in a village above the hospital. He was brought in, and I heard people\n\n8 say he was accused of being a member of the SDA party, the Democratic\n\n9 Action party, that he stood guard in the village of Donje Polje, where he\n\n10 lived; that he protected SDA leaders. He stood guard; he was their\n\n11 security, that is. They also beat him up and he never returned.\n\n12 They took him away once and he never returned after that.\n\n13 Q. Do you know if anything happened to another Mandzo in the KP Dom?\n\n14 A. Yes. Emir Mandzo, he was on the medical staff in the hospital.\n\n15 He was said to have been beaten up by mistake, they mistook him for\n\n16 another Mandzo. They also took out Salko Mandzo also by mistake. They\n\n17 told him it was a mistake, because the guard who came to pick him up, to\n\n18 call out Fuad Mandzo, he just said, \"Mandzo,\" and took out Emir Mandzo.\n\n19 Salko Mandzo was also taken out by mistake, and only after that, the third\n\n20 time, they specified it was Fuad Mandzo and took out, indeed, Fuad Mandzo,\n\n21 who never returned after that.\n\n22 Q. This Emir Mandzo you mentioned - that is actually B-36 and B-37 -\n\n23 was he in your room?\n\n24 A. Emir?\n\n25 Q. Emir, yes.\n\nPage 1105\n\n1 A. No. He was in Room 16. After the beating they threw him outside\n\n2 to the asphalt. They couldn't -- he couldn't stand on his feet because\n\n3 they beat him on his soles as well. They just threw him out through the\n\n4 gates. He fell down on the asphalt, and then he was later picked up and\n\n5 taken to another building, to Room 16.\n\n6 Q. And this Salko Mandzo - that's actually the incident 5.28 of the\n\n7 indictment - was he in your room?\n\n8 A. No. He was in Room 12. And when he returned after that mistake,\n\n9 when he got beaten by mistake, we saw that he was bleeding below his eye.\n\n10 We looked from the window. There was blood trickling from below his eye.\n\n11 They told us that they had put a knife there, saying that they would gouge\n\n12 out his eye. And he was also beaten up by mistake; he was beaten instead\n\n13 of Fuad.\n\n14 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: I would like to show the witness now\n\n15 Schedule C, that is, Exhibit 55.\n\n16 Q. Witness, we have already discussed some of the people on this\n\n17 list. I would like now to talk about particular persons on the list.\n\n18 Do you know the person number 1, Alija Altoka?\n\n19 A. No, I didn't know him.\n\n20 Q. And the person number 3 -- we have already spoken about Bico\n\n21 Salem. The person number 3, Abdurahman Cankusic, do you know this person?\n\n22 A. I knew him. He used to work in a company called Hidrogradnja.\n\n23 Q. Did you see him in KP Dom?\n\n24 A. Yes, yes, I did see him there.\n\n25 Q. When did you see him and when did you stop seeing him?\n\nPage 1106\n\n1 A. I saw him from the beginning until sometime in July or August.\n\n2 I'm not sure about the month, but it was one of those two months. And\n\n3 then he was taken away. And his brother Refik was taken away as well.\n\n4 Q. Were they taken for beatings? Was that such an incident when you\n\n5 heard beatings afterwards?\n\n6 A. You mean for the two of them?\n\n7 Q. Yes.\n\n8 A. The two of them were just taken away that day, beaten up, and they\n\n9 never returned to the compound. And their father was also imprisoned in\n\n10 Room 14 and listened all the time while they were being beaten.\n\n11 Q. And now the person number 5, Enko Cedic, also referred to as\n\n12 Ekinda.\n\n13 A. He was in Room 11, I think, or perhaps 13. He too was taken out\n\n14 repeatedly for beatings, and once they -- once they took him, never to\n\n15 take him back.\n\n16 Q. Witness, you have already mentioned Juso Dzamalija, and you said\n\n17 that he committed suicide. Can you tell us when this happened and what\n\n18 happened to him before he did that?\n\n19 A. He was shop assistant in a shop before the war, and his son, Ahmo,\n\n20 was deputy chief of police in Foca. And his son left Foca in those first\n\n21 days and the father was beaten because of the son, allegedly. And he was\n\n22 so badly beaten up, although I didn't see him myself, but I heard that he\n\n23 was so badly beaten up that during the night, that was in the beginning of\n\n24 May, I think, he hanged himself. And this nurse who was in my room, 18, I\n\n25 think it was at that time, this Gojko Jankovic, he told me in prison that\n\nPage 1107\n\n1 he was summoned to take him -- to take him down in the isolation cell\n\n2 where he had hanged himself.\n\n3 Q. And number 8, Ramo Dzendusic, what can you tell us about him?\n\n4 A. I knew him personally because he worked in the National Defence\n\n5 Secretariat until he was retired. I don't know where he was captured. He\n\n6 was kept in Room 16. We saw him being taken out and we heard him being\n\n7 beaten, but he never returned. And there is no trace of him.\n\n8 Q. And number 9, Adil Granov.\n\n9 A. Yes. That was an electrical engineer, a youngish man, who was\n\n10 also taken away one day and never returned. I didn't hear him being\n\n11 beaten; we could not make that out. But the main thing is he never\n\n12 returned and there is no trace of him, no word of him.\n\n13 Q. And number 10, Nail Hodzic.\n\n14 A. He was a driver in the electrical company, an elderly man. But he\n\n15 was a member of the SDA, probably, and he was active during the\n\n16 establishment of the party. He too was taken out, and we heard him being\n\n17 beaten.\n\n18 Q. And the next person, Mate Ivancic.\n\n19 A. That was a Croat who was employed in the hospital as a medical\n\n20 technician. He was brought from his workplace in the hospital. They took\n\n21 him out. We didn't hear them beat him.\n\n22 Q. And number 12, Esad Kiselica.\n\n23 A. That was a man who worked in the electrical company, an\n\n24 electrician, a sick man, youngish. He too was beaten and he never\n\n25 returned.\n\nPage 1108\n\n1 Q. Now we can move on to number 17, Krunoslav Marinovic.\n\n2 A. Yes. Also a Croat from Foca who had a private television repair\n\n3 shop. He too was beaten. And during his arrest - I heard he was in Room\n\n4 11 - I heard that before he was taken to prison, they broke his jaw so he\n\n5 couldn't go out to eat. And I didn't hear about any other beating. But\n\n6 in any case, he was taken away, never to return.\n\n7 Q. And number 18, Omer Mujezinovic.\n\n8 A. I don't know him.\n\n9 Q. And number 20, Hamid Ramovic.\n\n10 A. Yes. He was a farmer from Celebici whose brother was the first\n\n11 victim in Foca, a policeman, Abid Ramovic, who was killed on the 7th of\n\n12 April in Foca.\n\n13 Q. What happened to Mr. Hamid Ramovic?\n\n14 A. He too was repeatedly taken out, and we could hear him being\n\n15 beaten.\n\n16 Q. And did he disappear as the others?\n\n17 A. Yes.\n\n18 Q. And the following three are all with the last name Rikalo. Can\n\n19 you tell us something about them?\n\n20 A. I didn't know them personally. But they were in Room 11, and they\n\n21 were beaten on two occasions. After being taken out for the second time,\n\n22 they never returned.\n\n23 Q. All three of them?\n\n24 A. Yes. None of them returned.\n\n25 Q. And number 24, Seval Soro.\n\nPage 1109\n\n1 A. I don't know him.\n\n2 Q. And 25, Kemal Tulek.\n\n3 A. Before the war, he was a policeman in KP Dom. He was imprisoned\n\n4 and taken away, but I don't know about beatings. His brother, Ekrem,\n\n5 though, spent four or five months in an isolation cell and was transferred\n\n6 to Room 15, and even his next-door neighbours couldn't recognise him.\n\n7 Q. And number 26, Enes Uzunovic.\n\n8 A. That was a fine young man, a medical technician, a youth activist\n\n9 before this, president of the youth association in Foca. They beat him\n\n10 several times. They kept him below the staircase in an isolation cell.\n\n11 He was isolated down there, below. They didn't keep him in rooms with\n\n12 other prisoners. And we heard him being badly beaten down there. We\n\n13 heard his cries. He was taken away later, I didn't see when, but he is\n\n14 missing. But he was beaten and abused several times.\n\n15 Q. You said that he was kept in an isolation cell under the\n\n16 staircase. Where was he -- what isolation cell in which building?\n\n17 A. Building 1. Right after the entrance there is a staircase leading\n\n18 to the first floor. An isolation cell was built there with four cots. I\n\n19 peeped in once when there was no one around at a later stage. They kept\n\n20 him there for the whole time before they took him away. They kept him\n\n21 together with another man, Kemal Krkalic [phoen]. They kept them there\n\n22 for a long time before taking them away.\n\n23 Q. Witness, to clarify, when you say building 1, I rather would like\n\n24 to show you now the floor plan 6/2, to point out where this isolation\n\n25 cell was. First of all, was it on the ground floor or on a higher floor?\n\nPage 1110\n\n1 A. On the ground floor. Here you see the entrance to that building.\n\n2 This is the entry room, this is Room 12, then 11. Then the staircase\n\n3 leads to the first floor from here. Below the staircase, there is a\n\n4 landing here from which you go diagonally, and here on the ground was the\n\n5 isolation cell.\n\n6 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: For the record, the witness is pointing at a\n\n7 spot where the staircase is indicated on this sketch, between the Rooms 12\n\n8 and 11.\n\n9 A. Yes. Here below the staircase.\n\n10 Q. And the person number 27, Dzemal Vahida, if you look, please,\n\n11 again on the list. Can you tell us something about Dzemal Vahida?\n\n12 A. Dzemal Vahida, before the war, used to be a policeman in the town\n\n13 police. We saw him being brought to the gate, and while other people were\n\n14 being beaten, he stood at the gates waiting for his turn. And when he was\n\n15 brought inside, he never returned. I knew him as well.\n\n16 Q. Witness, from all these people on Schedule C that you have\n\n17 mentioned and that you said they disappeared, did you ever hear anything\n\n18 about them or that their bodies were found?\n\n19 A. No, never.\n\n20 Q. This -- you have mentioned at an earlier stage of your testimony\n\n21 that you heard these screams coming from the visitors' rooms in the\n\n22 administration building. Did you also hear such noises from other parts\n\n23 of the administration building?\n\n24 A. Yes. From the new wing, the so-called new wing of the\n\n25 administration building, where, before the war, there used to be\n\nPage 1111\n\n1 rehabilitation officers' rooms. They also beat and abused people there.\n\n2 Opposite Rooms 11 and 13, that's where these rooms are.\n\n3 Q. This pattern of taking people out for beatings, how did this\n\n4 affect you and the other detainees?\n\n5 A. Well, that was insufferable to listen to. Only some people could\n\n6 stand to stay by the windows and listen, while most of us hid deeper\n\n7 inside the room, covered our ears with blankets. That was really\n\n8 insufferable. Few people could stand being by the window the whole time\n\n9 and listening.\n\n10 Q. Did you fear to be taken as well for beatings?\n\n11 A. Yes, the whole time.\n\n12 Q. Were you interrogated while in the prison?\n\n13 A. Yes, at my own request. Because I had spent there ten days\n\n14 without being called to be questioned, and until I heard that those who\n\n15 did not make statements would not be allowed any visits, I kept quiet.\n\n16 But when I heard that, I started thinking and I realised I had been there\n\n17 for ten days without being called to give a statement.\n\n18 And once when I was standing there I heard -- I saw the warden\n\n19 come out into the compound. I stepped out and asked the warden why they\n\n20 had brought me in and were not calling me to be interrogated, and I heard\n\n21 that visits would not be allowed to such people, and he answered, \"We'll\n\n22 see.\"\n\n23 After that we were taken back from the canteen to our rooms, and\n\n24 half an hour later, a guard came to pick me up and took me to the\n\n25 administration building to give a statement.\n\nPage 1112\n\n1 Q. When you say \"the warden,\" who was the warden?\n\n2 A. Well, Milorad Krnojelac.\n\n3 Q. And how did you know that at that time, when you approached him?\n\n4 A. I knew. Everybody said when we would address the guards on some\n\n5 issue, asking for some sort of assistance, of course we didn't dare\n\n6 address all of them, but there were among them people whom we did dare to\n\n7 approach and they would reply that they couldn't decide without the\n\n8 warden. It was known that he was the warden. Everybody knew that.\n\n9 Q. When you approached him and talked to him, did you address him as\n\n10 Mr. Warden or did you address him with his name; do you recall?\n\n11 A. No. I stepped out of the line, I approached him, and I told him,\n\n12 \"Mico, what's this all about? Why is nobody calling me?\" I addressed\n\n13 him by his name.\n\n14 Q. Did he tell you why you were in the prison?\n\n15 A. No, he didn't.\n\n16 Q. Without giving any names now, were you the only person who\n\n17 approached Mr. Krnojelac on this occasion?\n\n18 A. On that occasion I was the only one who approached him. I don't\n\n19 know about people from other rooms. But on that occasion I stepped out of\n\n20 the line and approached him, because he wasn't very far away from us,\n\n21 perhaps 4 or 5 metres. He was passing by. In fact, he was standing there\n\n22 by a tree within the compound.\n\n23 Q. Was he alone on this occasion?\n\n24 A. No. There was his son there as well and a guard. I don't\n\n25 remember which guard. But his son was there. And I approached him on\n\nPage 1113\n\n1 another occasion, because my mother and brother lived in Donje Polje and I\n\n2 lived in the centre of town, and before, while I was at home, my telephone\n\n3 was disconnected and I didn't know what was happening with my mother.\n\n4 She's completely unable to move and almost blind.\n\n5 So on that occasion when I saw the warden standing there, I\n\n6 approached him and I asked him to allow me to go out and see if my mother\n\n7 was still alive, because I didn't know what was happening in Donje Polje.\n\n8 All the houses were burning or burnt down. I didn't know whether my\n\n9 mother's house was still standing. And he told me to go to lunch and he\n\n10 would see, that's what he said.\n\n11 And later Slavko Koroman came to my room, Room 15, and asked me\n\n12 out. So I went out and his -- that is, Milorad's son was in the car, in a\n\n13 camouflage uniform, while Koroman was in civilian clothes. The two of\n\n14 them drove me to my house where my mother and brother were; however, I\n\n15 didn't find my mother there because she had been taken to hospital. I\n\n16 found my brother at the neighbour's; he didn't dare stay in the house\n\n17 alone. He told me that nobody came for him, that my mother had been taken\n\n18 to the hospital. And both times I had asked to visit my home he made it\n\n19 possible for me.\n\n20 Q. This time when you approached him to get information about your\n\n21 mother, when was that? Was it after your first approach to Mr. Krnojelac?\n\n22 A. Yes, yes.\n\n23 Q. Can you tell us when, when that was?\n\n24 A. All of this happened in May, in early May, because I was taken\n\n25 away on the 23rd of April. We still had visits at that time, so it was\n\nPage 1114\n\n1 the first half of May, because on the 15th of May, they banned all visits.\n\n2 Q. And you said -- how often altogether did you approach\n\n3 Mr. Krnojelac, two times or three times?\n\n4 A. Only those two times. And later when I was transferred to work in\n\n5 the furniture factory, he would come with some delegations who toured this\n\n6 factory and we would just say hello when he passed by. No more than\n\n7 that. You couldn't call that a meeting. I just saw him.\n\n8 Q. You mentioned that his son was with him. Which son? The son\n\n9 Bozidar that you have already mentioned, or another one?\n\n10 A. I think it was Bozidar. I really don't know their names, but I\n\n11 think that was the one.\n\n12 Q. And what kind of a function did he have in the prison?\n\n13 A. Well, the guards said he was his personal security, but I don't\n\n14 know about that. In any case, he was wearing a camouflage uniform and\n\n15 carrying an automatic rifle. He was very strongly built. I don't know\n\n16 his real name.\n\n17 Q. You said, \"He was his personal security.\" Whose personal\n\n18 security?\n\n19 A. Of the warden.\n\n20 Q. When you were interrogated, where did that take place, and who\n\n21 questioned you?\n\n22 A. After I addressed the warden of the prison, a guard came and\n\n23 called my name out, as well as the names of two other persons from the\n\n24 room next door. So it was three of us who were brought to the gate.\n\n25 We entered the administrative building, and that is where these\n\nPage 1115\n\n1 inspectors were, these inspectors who were in charge of these\n\n2 interrogations: That was Zoran Vladicic, Vojislav Starovic, Miodrag\n\n3 Koprivica, and Petko Gasevic. They interrogated all these men who had\n\n4 been in prison.\n\n5 When the three of us were brought into this administration\n\n6 building, Zoran Vladicic, a former investigator in the criminal police in\n\n7 SUP before the war, he said to me at the door, \"Where is your Boro\n\n8 Kujundzic?\" I was friends with this chief of police before; we visited\n\n9 each other at home even. And I said, \"How should I know?\" and he\n\n10 said, \"You'll know. You'll know.\" And he cursed my mother, this Zoran\n\n11 Vladicic did.\n\n12 However, Miodrag Koprivica said to me, \"You come with me,\" and he\n\n13 took me through the hall of this administration building to a door. There\n\n14 was a door where it said \"Accounting.\" He took me in this room. Since I\n\n15 knew him personally, I asked him, \"What's this all about, Miso?\" and he\n\n16 said, \"See what's happened?\" I sat there.\n\n17 He ordered me a cup of coffee and he let me light up a cigarette,\n\n18 and he asked me sort of where I was those days until I was brought in,\n\n19 from when the attack on Foca started until I was brought to prison, so\n\n20 that I would tell him where I was during those days. I told him about\n\n21 this a bit, and he typed this out on a typewriter. It was half a page or\n\n22 a page. He let me read this text and I signed it in four copies. I read\n\n23 it; I signed it. It was nothing terrible. I mean, he wrote it the way I\n\n24 said it, where I was during those days. I signed it. He didn't give me a\n\n25 single copy. They didn't give copies to anyone; they left all of them\n\nPage 1116\n\n1 there.\n\n2 Q. And were you accused of anything particular?\n\n3 A. Yes. He said to me that there was a report against me, and I\n\n4 said, \"What kind of report?\" and he said that it said that I was shooting\n\n5 from the court building. Since the building was near my building, I mean\n\n6 this court was, it was as if I was shooting from there, and Zulfer Pjano,\n\n7 the public prosecutor from that building - Zulfer Pjano was the name of\n\n8 this public prosecutor - that he and I were shooting from the court\n\n9 building at other buildings. And that public prosecutor had escaped to\n\n10 Gorazde even before that. Throughout the war he was in Gorazde; he was\n\n11 not there at all.\n\n12 And I said, \"Miso, how could I shoot? How could I be in the court\n\n13 building?\" and he said, \"Zufer and you.\" Zufer I knew was in Gorazde.\n\n14 (redacted). I know that he escaped with his wife and his child to\n\n15 Gorazde. And he said, \"Well, all right. Of course, I doubt that you did\n\n16 it too,\" and that was not even recorded in this statement of mine. I\n\n17 signed this statement in four copies, and he kept all four copies and sent\n\n18 me back to the room, Room 15, that is.\n\n19 Q. While you were interrogated, were other detainees interrogated in\n\n20 adjacent rooms?\n\n21 A. Yes, yes, these two who were brought with me. One was\n\n22 interrogated by Vladicic, I guess, and the other one, by Starovic. The\n\n23 one who was interrogated by Vladicic was the Halim Corovic I mentioned,\n\n24 this elderly man. I heard him moaning that Vladicic had beaten him. I\n\n25 heard these moans and cries from the next-door office.\n\nPage 1117\n\n1 Q. And what about the third man? Was he mistreated?\n\n2 A. I don't know the third one. I don't know who the third one was.\n\n3 I don't know. He was brought from another room. Out of this fear, I\n\n4 couldn't ...\n\n5 Q. But did you hear anything in relation to this third person? What\n\n6 happened to him? Was he mistreated, or didn't you hear?\n\n7 A. I don't know.\n\n8 Q. These policemen who interrogated you and the other two, were\n\n9 they -- how were they dressed?\n\n10 A. Civilian clothes. They wore civilian clothes.\n\n11 Q. You mentioned that Ekrem Zekovic was beaten in the yard on one\n\n12 occasion. Did you ever see anyone else being beaten in the yard?\n\n13 A. No, no.\n\n14 Q. Did you ever see detainees being beaten on the way or in -- on the\n\n15 way to the canteen or in the canteen?\n\n16 A. I heard that, that they were beaten. But from Room 15, we could\n\n17 not see, because a group barged in. And another room was out for lunch,\n\n18 and then as they were coming back from lunch, this group barged in and\n\n19 then they started beating them as they were passing by them. But I didn't\n\n20 see this.\n\n21 Q. Did you see the group that barged in?\n\n22 A. No, I did not.\n\n23 Q. You have already mentioned that detainees were exchanged. Were\n\n24 these detainees seen afterwards again or are they missing?\n\n25 A. Most people who were taken for these so-called exchanges went\n\nPage 1118\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1119\n\n1 missing. I know that because they did not reappear in the compound, and\n\n2 until the present day, there's been no trace of them. I also see in the\n\n3 papers that their families are still looking for them, until the present\n\n4 day.\n\n5 Q. Was your brother with you in the KP Dom?\n\n6 A. Yes, he was. Two of them, actually.\n\n7 Q. Were they together with you in your rooms?\n\n8 A. (redacted)\n\n9 Q. What happened to your brothers? Are they still with you?\n\n10 A. One was exchanged together with me two and a half years later. He\n\n11 was brought in to prison from hospital, from where he had worked, in his\n\n12 white uniform. Seven doctors and seven medical workers were detained;\n\n13 there were 14 members of the medical profession in the camp.\n\n14 (redacted)\n\n15 (redacted). We were told that this group\n\n16 was being taken away for a real exchange, and I was happy that at least he\n\n17 was taken away to be exchanged. And it turned out that he's the one who\n\n18 never reappeared again.\n\n19 Q. How big was the group of people that were taken for exchange on\n\n20 the 30th of August? Do you know that?\n\n21 A. Fifty people were put on this bus. After I got out of this\n\n22 prison, I found out that this group had been stopped somewhere near Niksic\n\n23 and then they were returned to the KP Dom again. They spent the night\n\n24 there and that is where they singled out a group of some 20 younger men.\n\n25 They were taken away and there's been no trace of them since. This other\n\nPage 1120\n\n1 group of some 30 men was exchanged somewhere in Montenegro.\n\n2 Q. Did you try to locate your brother? Did you search for him?\n\n3 A. After getting out of this prison, I tried all around, through\n\n4 different people, in Serbia, even in Pozarevac. A friend of mine looked\n\n5 in that prison there, but there's been no trace whatsoever.\n\n6 Q. And the brother you are talking about, is that the person who is\n\n7 on the list in front of you, on Exhibit P401? Is that the brother you are\n\n8 talking about who is missing?\n\n9 A. Yes, yes.\n\n10 Q. You mentioned that medical staff was also detained in the KP Dom.\n\n11 Do you know a Dr. Aziz Torlak, and can you tell us what became of him?\n\n12 A. Aziz Torlak, I knew him personally. He was taken away sometime in\n\n13 1993 for some kind of an exchange, and he never returned again, nor does\n\n14 his family know anything of him. I don't know what happened to him.\n\n15 Everybody assumes that he's been killed.\n\n16 Q. Do you recall that a detainee once escaped from the KP Dom?\n\n17 A. Yes, I recall.\n\n18 Q. When did that happen?\n\n19 A. Well, this is the way it was: It was in the first half of 1993.\n\n20 I don't know the month now but it was in the first half. This one group\n\n21 of men, craftsmen, metalworkers, they were taken to this so-called metal\n\n22 plant that was outside the confines of the prison. That's where they\n\n23 worked. The rest were returned to the compound, and he escaped. This\n\n24 went on for about three days, but then they caught him and brought him\n\n25 back. They caught him somewhere on the road leading to Montenegro.\n\nPage 1121\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1122\n\n1 Q. Did this escape have any consequences on the other detainees?\n\n2 A. Yes, yes, it did. When they caught him and brought him back to\n\n3 prison again, we were forbidden to work. Nobody could get out of the\n\n4 room. There was torture those days until we were -- until he was caught.\n\n5 They halved these small meals we were getting; they took away our\n\n6 medicines, whatever we had. They hardly had anything to take away from\n\n7 us. They forbade us to get out of our rooms. There were no medical\n\n8 examinations. They carried out this raid, as they called it.\n\n9 When they brought this Zekovic, they took us out of the room and\n\n10 they lined us all up on the grounds. They brought him in front of this\n\n11 line, and Savo Todovic talked to us there before the warden. He said that\n\n12 no one should dare escape, that not even a bird was able to fly across;\n\n13 that he was caught, he was not beaten, that's what he told us; and indeed\n\n14 we did not see any traces of violence on his face, because he was not far\n\n15 away from the line, 2 or 3 metres away from us. The warden was there,\n\n16 Krnojelac, in front of us, in front of this line-up, that is. There was\n\n17 Miro Prodanovic, commander of the guards, this guard service, and Savo\n\n18 Todovic.\n\n19 Q. What did Mr. Krnojelac do? Was he just standing there or was he\n\n20 also addressing you?\n\n21 A. He was just standing there. He was just standing there. He\n\n22 didn't say anything. Only Savo Todovic spoke.\n\n23 Q. You mentioned that you were forbidden to work when this happened.\n\n24 So at that time you worked?\n\n25 A. Yes, yes, most people worked. Some worked on the prison farm.\n\nPage 1123\n\n1 There were farms for chickens, cattle, cows; it was an agricultural farm,\n\n2 what do you call it. Others worked in a mine; yet others worked in the\n\n3 furniture factory; others worked on cutting wood; others were gathering\n\n4 hay; others were repairing Krnojelac's house, things like that.\n\n5 Q. I would like to know what you worked. What were your assignments?\n\n6 A. After having spent ten months in the room, I could not take it\n\n7 anymore psychologically. I asked a guard how I could get in touch with\n\n8 the warden. He said to me, \"Write a request. Write that you want to have\n\n9 an interview with the warden,\" and that's the only thing I wrote: \"I wish\n\n10 to have an interview with the warden.\" And the guard took it, and two or\n\n11 three days later a guard called me out of my room and he took me to this\n\n12 small room at the entrance of building 2. Right by the entrance there's\n\n13 this small room where a guard sat, during the night as well, and that's\n\n14 where I found Savo Todovic. The warden did not want to see me. This Savo\n\n15 received me.\n\n16 When I got out, skinny as I was, I could hardly stand on my feet,\n\n17 and he said, \"What do you want?\" \"I want to go out and work.\" I pleaded\n\n18 with him, even in that condition, just so that I could go and work. I\n\n19 couldn't take it, being locked up in a room anymore. And he said, \"What\n\n20 are you going to do when you can't?\" and I said, \"Anything. Just let me\n\n21 go out into the compound so that I get a bit of air. I'll go crazy,\" I\n\n22 said. And he said to me, \"Well, we'll see,\" and he returned me to the\n\n23 room.\n\n24 After that there was lots of snow. Lots of snow had fallen. A\n\n25 guard called me and informed me that I was assigned to work on piling\n\nPage 1124\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1125\n\n1 firewood within the compound and carrying it to the canteen, to near the\n\n2 kitchen. I carried it for days and days, this frozen firewood, and I was\n\n3 very lightly dressed. It was so hard for me to do it, I could hardly do\n\n4 it, but it was only important for me not to be in the room. And this went\n\n5 on until spring, until we ran out of wood. Some people were cutting this\n\n6 firewood, and I was piling it there. And then I was assigned to the\n\n7 furniture factory. In the meantime, I was taken from time to time to the\n\n8 farm to work on the cornfields, and also to gather hay for the cattle.\n\n9 But for the most part I spent my time at the furniture factory.\n\n10 Q. Did you ever donate blood while in the prison?\n\n11 A. Yes, once. Once. This was at the beginning, when this prison\n\n12 medical official was going round the rooms, saying that blood should be\n\n13 donated, that there wasn't enough blood at the hospital. There were\n\n14 wounded persons there; there were Muslims, Serbs, children; there were\n\n15 quite a few wounded. And over 40 of us signed up then. A team came from\n\n16 the hospital, from this transfusion department, and we donated blood and\n\n17 we were given a pack of cigarettes each, a pack of fruit juice, and a\n\n18 sandwich, respectively, and then we were returned to our rooms. The other\n\n19 time he asked no one signed up. People were so exhausted that nobody\n\n20 dared do such a thing anymore.\n\n21 Q. Let us now move to the command structure in the KP Dom. You have\n\n22 already mentioned that Mr. Krnojelac was the warden. Why was -- do you\n\n23 know why the former warden was replaced by Mr. Krnojelac?\n\n24 A. I don't know why the previous warden was replaced. This is a man\n\n25 I knew well. He probably thought that it was not the right place for\n\nPage 1126\n\n1 him. I think that's what he did. He was a smart man. Hardly anyone\n\n2 would accept something like that, in my opinion.\n\n3 Q. This former warden, what was his name?\n\n4 A. Radojica Tesovic.\n\n5 Q. Did he remain on the prison staff? Did he do something else\n\n6 instead of being --\n\n7 A. He was in charge of the farm. He was outside the compound.\n\n8 JUDGE HUNT: Do we know what his ethnicity was?\n\n9 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: I didn't hear you. I'm sorry.\n\n10 JUDGE HUNT: Do we know what his ethnicity was?\n\n11 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n12 Q. What was his ethnicity?\n\n13 A. Radojica, what ethnicity? He was a Serb. A Serb from Celebici,\n\n14 from Zavajt.\n\n15 Q. Do you know who appointed Mr. Krnojelac in his position as a\n\n16 warden?\n\n17 A. I don't know who appointed him. I assume it was the SDS party.\n\n18 Q. You mentioned that you approached him twice in the prison. Did\n\n19 you see him more often in the prison?\n\n20 A. From time to time, when he would come in. During the day we\n\n21 worked in the factory. Perhaps he came in several times but I would only\n\n22 see him when he came to the factory, to tour the factory.\n\n23 Q. What was he wearing when you saw him in the prison?\n\n24 A. He wore a military uniform, an officer's uniform of the former\n\n25 Yugoslav army, that reserve officers had; without insignia, it was.\n\nPage 1127\n\n1 Q. Did he carry a weapon?\n\n2 A. I did not see.\n\n3 Q. When you saw him, you have already described that his son was with\n\n4 him. Who else was with him?\n\n5 A. You mean then, when I addressed him? Is that what you're talking\n\n6 about?\n\n7 Q. In general. When you saw him or when you approached him, who was\n\n8 with him?\n\n9 A. Then, when I approached him, his son was there and some of the\n\n10 guards. I can't remember who. But as he was coming to the factory to\n\n11 tour it, only the guards were there. His son was not there; his son did\n\n12 not come in. There were other soldiers with him, some other soldiers --\n\n13 some other guards who were on duty.\n\n14 Q. When you said he toured the factory, what do you mean by this?\n\n15 A. He would come with men unknown to me, probably buyers of this\n\n16 furniture. I don't know who it was. But at any rate, they passed through\n\n17 the factory; they looked at this furniture that we were making. We would\n\n18 just say hello in passing and he would pass with them. He would not stop\n\n19 to talk to anyone.\n\n20 Q. You mentioned that you approached him twice. Do you know of any\n\n21 other detainee who had conversations with him, with Mr. Krnojelac?\n\n22 A. No, I don't know. I'm not aware of that.\n\n23 Q. How long was Mr. Krnojelac the warden?\n\n24 A. Until 19 -- until the half -- until mid-1993.\n\n25 Q. And who replaced him?\n\nPage 1128\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1129\n\n1 A. He was replaced by Zoran Sekulovic from Godjen -- the village of\n\n2 Slatine, who was before the war employed in the Oslobodenje, a newspaper\n\n3 company in Sarajevo, in the marketing department, I guess.\n\n4 Q. Did the conditions in the KP Dom change after the replacement of\n\n5 Mr. Krnojelac?\n\n6 A. Yes. The abuse stopped and the attitude of the guards improved.\n\n7 They were not so rigid as before. They gave us more bread, which is the\n\n8 most important thing. And we did feel a change.\n\n9 Q. Let me put to you at that point something that the accused says\n\n10 about his position.\n\n11 He said that the KP Dom, during the war, had two separate\n\n12 sections, a military part and a civil part. The Muslim detainees were in\n\n13 the military part and the normal convicts were in the civil part, and he\n\n14 was only responsible for this civil part. Can you comment on this?\n\n15 A. That is nonsense; that is not true. There was no military part\n\n16 there whatsoever. All the people there were civilians. There was only\n\n17 one man, and I mentioned him before, who had been captured on his position\n\n18 and he was exchanged later with us. There was no other part. All of it\n\n19 was civilian. So that is not true.\n\n20 JUDGE HUNT: Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff, I don't know whether you're going\n\n21 to follow it up, but he in that answer was dealing with the people who\n\n22 were being detained there. I thought you had asked him about the people\n\n23 who were running the place.\n\n24 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes.\n\n25 JUDGE HUNT: So I think you should follow that up.\n\nPage 1130\n\n1 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. I intended to do that.\n\n2 Q. Witness, it's not -- Mr. Krnojelac does not argue that you were\n\n3 prisoners of war or involved in any military actions. He only says the\n\n4 prison, as such, was actually two different compounds, a military prison\n\n5 and a civil prison, and he was only dealing with the civil prison, that\n\n6 is, with the normal convicts and not with the Muslims.\n\n7 The question is: Was there such a division into a military part\n\n8 and a civilian part?\n\n9 A. As for the military, only Serb soldiers were locked up; in\n\n10 building 2 they were kept. And there was no one from the Muslim army, no\n\n11 military Muslims. And those people were kept there because they were\n\n12 rowdy or drunken after being out all night. Those Serbs were kept down\n\n13 there because they refused to go back to their positions. But he was\n\n14 warden for the entire complex. Everybody knows that and everybody will\n\n15 confirm it.\n\n16 JUDGE HUNT: May I suggest that you ask him directly: Were there\n\n17 any military people who were running any part of the prison? That's what\n\n18 we really have to know.\n\n19 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n20 Q. Witness, you heard the Presiding Judge. Was any part of the\n\n21 prison, whatever part, run by the military and not by the civilian staff\n\n22 and Mr. Krnojelac?\n\n23 A. I cannot know that, whether there was any military administration\n\n24 over this prison, because from my position I was unable to find out; nor\n\n25 have I ever seen any military officer enter the compound, ever.\n\nPage 1131\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1132\n\n1 Q. You have described to us Mr. Savo Todovic. What was his function?\n\n2 A. Before the war, he was the so-called officer for employment of\n\n3 former inmates, and later, at the time we're talking about during the war,\n\n4 while we were there - I don't know what his position was called - but he\n\n5 decided who would go to the mines to dig, who would go to other types of\n\n6 work. Nobody could decide that without him; no guard dared to do anything\n\n7 without his approval.\n\n8 Q. What was he wearing when you saw him in the prison?\n\n9 A. Well, sometimes he wore a military uniform; sometimes civilian\n\n10 clothes. It depends. But he often wore some kind of military fur coat,\n\n11 and that's the nickname he got, Bunda, which means fur coat. And when\n\n12 people saw him, they knew there was going to be trouble; everybody was\n\n13 afraid of him.\n\n14 Q. Did he wear a weapon?\n\n15 A. He often carried a pistol. You could see that.\n\n16 Q. Did he beat detainees or abuse them otherwise?\n\n17 A. Yes, he beat them. When Zekovic tried to escape, he interrogated\n\n18 the people who had worked with Zekovic in this metal workshop, and he beat\n\n19 most of them, as if they had known that he was going to try to escape and\n\n20 as if he had planned the escape. That's what he tried to insinuate.\n\n21 Q. Who was the commander of the guards?\n\n22 A. The chief of the guards, that's what he was called, was Mitar\n\n23 Rasevic, and he held that position even before the war.\n\n24 Q. How did he treat the detainees?\n\n25 A. As far as I could see, he didn't do any bad things then. He often\n\nPage 1133\n\n1 entered rooms, advised us not to try to do anything stupid. But I never\n\n2 saw him beat anyone.\n\n3 Q. Did you talk with him personally?\n\n4 A. You mean Mitar? I did once, when a neighbour of mine, a woman,\n\n5 brought me a shirt, some underwear, from my apartment. That's when I\n\n6 spent some time with him, when he invited me to collect this.\n\n7 Q. What did you talk about?\n\n8 A. I asked him whether he knew how long this madness was going to\n\n9 last, and he told me to keep quiet, to act normally, not to try anything.\n\n10 He told me, \"Nobody will hit you.\" That's what he told me.\n\n11 Q. Did you talk with him about the bad living conditions in the KP\n\n12 Dom?\n\n13 A. No, I didn't.\n\n14 Q. You said that you were detained until October 1994. How many\n\n15 detainees were exchanged together with you?\n\n16 A. Sixty-eight. There were 68 of us in that last group from the KP\n\n17 Dom. And from Rudo, from Batkovici, there were people as well from those\n\n18 places. It was a large exchange on that day. We were the last to get out\n\n19 of the KP Dom.\n\n20 Q. When did you meet your wife and your family again?\n\n21 A. A month after the exchange.\n\n22 Q. And when did she leave Foca?\n\n23 A. She left in August, I think, August 1992. She was given an exit\n\n24 permit from Dragan Gagovic allowing her to leave Foca together with the\n\n25 children.\n\nPage 1134\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1135\n\n1 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: With the help of the usher, I would like to\n\n2 show the witness the exit permit which has the identification number in\n\n3 the trial binders of 127 and 127A. I would like to show him the B/C/S\n\n4 version.\n\n5 You can have this one. Please do not put it on the ELMO because\n\n6 the names are on there.\n\n7 THE USHER: Yes.\n\n8 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n9 Q. Witness, when you look at this permit from the 27th of June, 1992,\n\n10 is that the name of your wife and your children on it?\n\n11 A. Yes, yes.\n\n12 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The Prosecution would like to enter this\n\n13 exhibit into evidence.\n\n14 JUDGE HUNT: Any objection, Mr. Bakrac?\n\n15 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] No, thank you.\n\n16 JUDGE HUNT: Those documents will be Exhibit P127 and P127A; they\n\n17 will both be under seal.\n\n18 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Thank you.\n\n19 Q. Witness, do you recall that you gave a statement to the\n\n20 investigators' office on one occasion and that you, on this occasion,\n\n21 handed over a list with the names of the prison staff?\n\n22 A. Yes.\n\n23 Q. When you made this list, did you make it from your recollection?\n\n24 A. Yes, based on my memory.\n\n25 Q. On this list you gave the name of -- the names of about 12 guards\n\nPage 1136\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 1137\n\n1 that you mentioned that they stood out in brutality; do you recall that?\n\n2 A. I do.\n\n3 Q. And can you repeat for the Court the names of these particular\n\n4 brutal guards?\n\n5 A. I can. Maybe not all of them but I'll try. Milenko Burilo,\n\n6 Dragomir Obrenovic, Vlatko Pljevaljcic, Vitomir Micevic, Predrag\n\n7 Stefanovic, Jovo Savic, Radovan Vukovic, Milovan Vukovic, Zoran Matovic -\n\n8 him especially, and Burilo as well, and so on. I can't remember any more\n\n9 at this moment.\n\n10 Q. Witness, you have described to us --\n\n11 THE INTERPRETER: Microphone, please, Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff.\n\n12 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: I'm sorry.\n\n13 Q. Witness, you have described to us how you suffered while you were\n\n14 there and that you also have some permanent results -- permanent physical\n\n15 damage. Do you still suffer psychologically?\n\n16 A. Yes. Often in the night I wake up screaming and I'm soaking wet.\n\n17 It's very difficult for me to shake off this state. I tremble\n\n18 frightfully. It's horrible.\n\n19 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, these are all the questions that\n\n20 the Prosecution has.\n\n21 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you. Cross-examination, Mr. Vasic?\n\n22 Perhaps I should remind both you and the witness, when you're both\n\n23 speaking in the same language, you do tend to get ahead of the\n\n24 translators, so pause at the end of the question before the answer\n\n25 commences, and pause at the end of the answer before the next question\n\nPage 1138\n\n1 commences.\n\n2 MR. VASIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honours.\n\n3 Cross-examined by Mr. Vasic:\n\n4 Q. I would like to introduce myself to the witness. I'm Miroslav\n\n5 Vasic, one of the Defence counsel for Mr. Krnojelac.\n\n6 Since you started your testimony on the 9th of November this year,\n\n7 when you took the solemn declaration, and today is the 23rd of November,\n\n8 can you please tell me where you spent this time between these two\n\n9 sessions of the court?\n\n10 A. At home.\n\n11 Q. In this period, did you talk to anyone about the subject of your\n\n12 testimony?\n\n13 A. No.\n\n14 Q. Thank you. In the first part of your testimony you mentioned\n\n15 that, together with the accused, you were a member of the Territorial\n\n16 Defence. You also said that he had a higher rank than you did. My\n\n17 question is: In the army establishment, were you superior to Milorad\n\n18 Krnojelac in the Territorial Defence?\n\n19 A. No. The commander of the staff was his superior. (redacted)\n\n20 (redacted). And he was a commander of a very large unit.\n\n21 Q. Thank you. In view of your place there, your position in the\n\n22 institution where you said you worked, are you aware that in 1994 [as\n\n23 interpreted] there was a reorganisation in the unit which was, until then,\n\n24 commanded by Milorad Krnojelac?\n\n25 A. Yes. We went to drills after that and he continued for another\n\nPage 1139\n\n1 two years in that position.\n\n2 Q. Do you know that he was replaced on that position by Mr. Radovic,\n\n3 who became commander?\n\n4 A. Radovic? No, I don't know.\n\n5 Q. Thank you. Do you perhaps remember that you were at a drill in\n\n6 1992 [as interpreted] together with the accused on the stretch from Zavajt\n\n7 to Godjen Foca?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Could you please tell us who was the commander of that drill, his\n\n10 full name?\n\n11 A. You mean the drill?\n\n12 Q. Yes.\n\n13 A. The commander of the drill was the then colonel from the district\n\n14 headquarters in Sarajevo.\n\n15 Q. What ethnicity was he?\n\n16 JUDGE HUNT: Mr. Vasic, please do wait. You're well and truly\n\n17 "
