        "text": "I analyze the role of Petar II Petrović Njegoš as Montenegro's vladika (the hereditary bishop-prince and ruler), as a European statesman, and as a modernizer in the nineteenth century. Although Njegoš is most known for his poetry, the most famous of which is Gorksi Vijenac (The Mountain Wreath), I examine more than his literary works by evaluating his political, social, and economic accomplishments and failures as the traditional ruler of Montenegro, a nationalist, and a diplomat. I scrutinize the successes and failures of Njegoš’s politics in two environments – that of nineteenth century Montenegro and of the European power struggle in the Balkans. Njegoš believed that in order to accomplish stability in his country, he had to establish Montenegro as a political presence in the European state-system, as well as modernize certain aspects of Montenegro’s internal political, economic, and social structures. In his foreign policy, Njegoš diplomatically maneuvered between the Russian, Austrian, and Ottoman Empires. Njegoš’s attempts to transform Montenegro from a tribal state into something that would resemble a European “nation-state” met with a mixed response from his fellow Montenegrins, although his reforms were generally approved and sometimes funded by the European Great Powers. Yearly Russian monetary assistance to Montenegro made Njegoš's internal restructuring possible. His reforms, including the opening of the first elementary school, the formation of a Senate, the creation of his uncle Petar I as a saint, and the establishment of a national treasury and system of taxation, were met with some approval and more noticeable resistance from Montenegro's tribes. Yet he paved the way for the next two generations of Montenegrin rulers to become princes and kings, enabling them to better participate in the increasingly secular world of nineteenth and twentieth century Europe. His life story, especially in regards to his time as vladika of Montenegro, provides important insight into the process of state-building in the Balkans in the nineteenth century, as well as a striking example of Balkan political, economic, and cultural interactions with Western and Central Europe.\n\nThe recent invention of the new historical narrative, the creation of a separate language and foundation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church are the first steps in creating a new Montenegrin nation. The article reveals that those were the result of neither real cultural need nor break-through research methods that would confirm the arguments stated in the so-called Doclean narrative, discussed in this paper. As is the case in FYR of Macedonia, the next step will be to support these actions by creating the notion of material heritage which would emphasize the link to the early Mediaeval past, with the emphasis on the Docelan period. Even though the Institute for the Protection of Monuments has existed since 1948 and, it is reasonable to expect the foundation of an Archaeology Department within the University in the near future, with the task of uncovering the Montenegrin Doclean past, as the Doclean narrative further develops. Currently, the whole territory of Montenegro is covered by 22 museums. Of these, the most important is the complex in Cetinje, which celebrates the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty and Montenegrin sovereignty. However, as the Doclean narrative emphasizes the Catholic nature of St. John Vladimir, it is expected that the museums in coastal towns, together with their urban characteristics, will receive further reinterpretation, with greater emphasis on the Catholic heritage. Although the Serbian Orthodox Church celebrates not only Nemanjić kings, but also St. Peter of Cetinje and St. John Vladimir, it can be expected that the Montenegrin Orthodox Church will replace the Nemanjić saint-kings with the Catholic saints of coastal towns, arguing their Montenegrin ethnic identity.\n\nSituated at the very heart of the Habsburg-ruled Hungarian Kingdom, the twin cities of Buda and Pest played an important role as centres of modern Hungarian (Magyar) and Slavic national movements as well in the first half of the nineteenth century. Public and semi-public urban spaces and public institutions were used by members of the emerging Slovak, Serbian, Croatian national intelligentsias. Considering their importance in this earlier stage of nation building (and not primarily because of their overall ethnic composition) it is even possible to call Buda and Pest as „Slavic cities”. These urban spaces had a specific role in the case of the Serbian national movement. In these cities institutions were founded which served as patterns for other national movements as well. During this period of time a vivid exchange of ideas between Hungarians and Serbs can be observed in the cities; multilingualism and even multiple identities were characteristic for the era. To describe complex cultural interrelations in the urban space the thesis will use the notion of urban cultural milieus introduced by Moritz Csáky for the case of Vienna. To sum up Buda and Pest can be seen as essential spaces of Serbian and other nation building(s). The main focus of the work is the development of relations after the dramatic events of 1848-1849; namely the revolutions and Serbian-Hungarian armed conflict. Is it possible to speak after the political-social context of equally oppressing neo-absolutist era about reconciliation or even about a new Serbian-Hungarian golden age as some historians are claiming? What changes had happened since the pre-1848 Vormärz period regarding the basic characteristics of the Serbian national movement? What happened to the „Serbian” urban milieu, as the social and even material preconditions of the urban space changed? In order to contribute to these major questions I intend to focus on performances in Buda and Pest being either organised by the Serbian community or having a specific importance for Serbs. The time scale is drawn between the year of the first constitutional attempts 1860 and the Austro-Hungarian compromise in 1867. The thesis attempts to distinguish two case studies. The first topic is related to the perception of a piece of theatre performed in the Hungarian National Theatre in Hungarian about the Serbian despot George Brankovich between 1856 and 1866. Later on, the drama became a symbol of Serbian-Hungarian good relationships and can be seen as part of a broader discourse on it. The second case study analyses four “besedas”, ball-like cultural manifestations presenting a variety of dances, songs, poems; short lectures and after the “frontal” part inviting guests to join the dances and songs. The thesis defines Bildungsbürgertum and Serbian University Youth in the very context of “Serbian” events; as two partially overlapping social groups within the Serbian urban cultural milieu in Buda-Pest, which can be regarded as main or minor actors of the above mentioned events. Both groups intended to represent themselves and express national identity both in the urban space and the wide-spread diaspora networks. So the levels of the urban space and the diasporas constitute two scales of the analysis."
