        "text": "Citizens who want to support the appeal with their signature can do so via the link:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQsbjoiMgzEfvZl8bhb5rQHnMc9GmHMqsqEzcLpzeqpF0j2w/viewform\n\nWe are transmitting the appeal of the Montenegrin PEN Center regarding the threat to peace and stability in Montenegro in its entirety:\n\nDeeply concerned about the burning of passions and the danger to peace in Montenegro, we call on the Montenegrin authorities to prevent the announced enthronement of the Metropolitan of the Church of Serbia in the Cetinje Monastery, which a good part of the Montenegrin public perceives as an act of humiliation of Montenegro and Montenegrins. Irresponsible calls by the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Parliament of Montenegro to the “Church-People's Assembly” in Cetinje, having in mind the mood of the citizens of Cetinje and a large part of Montenegrin citizens, are a direct threat to peace and security and proof that the highest officials care deepening divisions. With such messages, as well as the accompanying intimidation and threats to citizens who legally and legitimately express revolt due to the ostentatious behavior of the Church of Serbia and the puppet government it controls, they take responsibility for the possible consequences of the imposed enthronement of Serbian Church Metropolitan Joanikije II in Cetinje Monastery.\n\nIt is known that from its founding in 1485 until the occupation of Montenegro in 1918, the Cetinje Monastery was the center of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, as one of the spiritual pillars of the Montenegrin people, but for a long time the state seat from which the Montenegrin metropolitans until the 1930s, they ruled the state of Montenegro. Today, the Cetinje Monastery is the property of the capital Cetinje, and it houses the clergy and monastics of the Church of Serbia, while the clergy of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church is forbidden access to the Monastery, by the arbitrariness of its current users. If today's guests who have usurped hospitality respected the city in which they are, to respect the religious rights of Orthodox Montenegrins who have their own religious organization, the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, and finally to respect the state and its features, the Cetinje Monastery would be wide for all people of good will.\n\nUnfortunately, in the past 30 years, the hierarchs of the Church of Serbia have hosted war criminals and criminals in the Cetinje Monastery, who allegedly kept them away from the people of Cetinje and Cetinje, and what attitude they had towards the people who built the Cetinje Monastery and gathered around it for hundreds of years sparks of freedom – the words of the previous Metropolitan of the Church of Serbia in Montenegro speak best, who considered Montenegrins “Djilas’ bastards”, compared them to oxen, called their language beef, considered Montenegro a “cup country born in Broz's egg”, called Muslims “fake people” false faith ”and the like. That huge burden of hatred left in the legacy of the previous metropolitan is today borne by his spiritual successor who, just like him, considers Montenegrins a fictional nation and despises all elements of Montenegrin spirituality and identity. The activity of the Church of Serbia in Montenegro, unfortunately, is opposed to the basic evangelical and soteriological role of the Christian church and is reduced to the assimilation of Montenegrins as the initial phase of the destruction of the Montenegrin state. The behavior of the Church of Serbia in the political processes in the last 30 years, and especially in the previous more than a year and a half, are proof that this is an organization that is an instrument of realization of political plans of the state of Serbia, which no longer declares under the name of Greater Serbia, but already uses euphemisms such as the Serbian world or the Open Balkans.\n\nThe values ​​of anti-fascism, secularism and multiculturalism are endangered in Montenegro today. The government, which is entirely under the control of the Church of Serbia, does not shy away from open segregation, revanchism and chauvinism in relation to all citizens who do not show servility to the Church of Serbia and do not support its assimilation intentions in Montenegro. In addition to denying personal and collective rights to unfit citizens, Orthodox Montenegrins were particularly hard hit by the authorities, who were also denied basic religious rights, and because of their national affiliation and commitment to the Montenegrin Orthodox Church – as a religious organization that, unlike the Serbian Church, registered in Montenegro – today it is not possible for churches built by their ancestors and which were owned by the state of Montenegro until 1918 to perform religious rites, and even the graves of their ancestors were transferred to the ownership of the Church of Serbia, as an institution of the state of Serbia, by anti-state and anti-civilization acts of the new government.\n\nHaving all this in mind, it is clear that the announced enthronement of Metropolitan of the Church of Serbia Joanikije II in the Cetinje Monastery is an act of provocation and humiliation of Cetinje citizens and citizens of Montenegro who nationally express themselves as Montenegrins and who have full awareness of their origin and identity. In a situation where national passions and political divisions have been heated up, the responsible government would do everything to avoid radicalization and prevent unwanted consequences, but instead Montenegrin top officials are doing everything possible to enable the usurpers of the throne of St. Peter of Cetinje, under police cordons and under siege to triumphantly declare that they had conquered and humiliated Cetinje, the City of Heroes, the centuries-old libertarian port of Montenegro.\n\nWe therefore call on the Montenegrin authorities to abandon the violent attempt to enthrone the Metropolitan of the Church of Serbia in the Cetinje Monastery and to organize this act, since it is obviously subordinated to the Church of Serbia and the executor of its orders, at the headquarters of the Church of Serbia in Belgrade or in some other property of that institution which was built in the past 30 years with the generous support of the State of Montenegro. Every other scenario brings with it great challenges and the danger that the fragile peace in Montenegro will be disturbed, and the citizens of Montenegro will be exposed to security risks. In that situation, which we hope will be avoided, all responsibility for the consequences will fall on the Montenegrin government."
