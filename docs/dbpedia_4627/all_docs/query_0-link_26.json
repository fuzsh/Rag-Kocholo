        "text": "Who knows, maybe every defensive footballer, no matter how accomplished, bears the scar of an unfulfilled striker.\n\nFour decades after his retirement, Branko Rašović, once a stopper of race and class, was asked what he would change in his football life if he could turn back time. \"I would remain a striker,\" he answered the volley.\n\n\"As a young player, I was the best point guard and dribbler of my age, at that time in Titograd and beyond, but the coach sent me to defense. And that's how I became and remained a center half\".\n\nSorry for the goalscoring joy'\n\nThat evening, on April 20, 1966, at \"Old Trafford\", in the second leg of the European Champions Cup semi-final, the Manchester United forwards regretted the long-ago coaching decision! Bobby Charlton, Dennis Lowe, David Hurd (the injured George Best did not play).\n\nThe same ones who in the football feast, on the previous step, buried the two-time ruler of the Old Continent, Benfica, with eight goals.\n\nAttacking the \"black and white\" defense in order to make up for the minus two from the first match at the JNA Stadium (0:2), they bounced off the wall. With Milutin Šoškić in front of the goal, Rašović and Velibor Vasović in the half line, Partizan's defense faltered only once.\n\nEyewitnesses claim that the 24-year-old from Titograd, a stout, youthful man, spent 80 minutes in the air, hovering in aerial duels with the \"devil\" attackers.\n\n\"The tall center half from Belgrade\" - wrote the Daily Express - \"can freely go down in the history of European football, as the player who stopped the favorite\".\n\nHe found out about the nickname given to him by Yugoslav journalists upon his return from England - the Giant from Old Trafford. (By the way: those who remember him, and are able to compare, say that the later idol of the Theater of Dreams and captain of United Nemanja Vidić resembled him in stature, demeanor and game.)\n\nAnd who knows where, and who knows when\n\nAnd just two years earlier, Rašović, born in Podgorica during the war in 1942, fought on the fields of the Second League in the jersey of Budućnost. And he did it so well that the selection committee Ljubomir Lovrić - Hugo Ruševljanin allowed him to make his debut for the Yugoslav national team on April 1, 1964 - no joke - in a friendly match with Bulgaria in Čair, Niš.\n\nSome months later, he was taken by Partizan, who had been keeping an eye on him for a long time. With the obligation to pay the \"blues\" two million dinars and buy - a comfortable two-room apartment in Titograd. Since the \"black and white\" did not honor the agreement by the end of 1964, the court obliged them to pay 5,8 million dinars. A copy of Pobjeda, from which we learn that \"Budućnost beat Partizan - but in court\" cost 40 dinars.\n\nAt the JNA stadium, Rašović quickly aligned himself with the generation that was destined for great deeds - Milutin Šoškić, Velibor Vasović, Fahrudin Jusufi, Vladic Kovačević, Milan Galić, Radoslav Bečejc... Partizan's babies. \"Rebels and irresistible\", Božo Koprivica will write for them. They won the Championship of Yugoslavia in 1965 in a full race. And then in the 1965/66 season. conquered Europe. In the Champions Cup, Nantes, Werder, Sparta Prague, United fell in order... With four victories in Belgrade without conceding a goal.\n\n\"Every opponent was a bigger name and had a bigger tradition than Partizan,\" Rašović recalls.\n\nAnd in the final, in front of the gates of heaven, at the later infamous Heysel in Brussels, on May 11, 1966, the five-headed football Kerber - Real awaited the \"black and whites\". European football king from 1956 to 1960. In the last season of Ferenc Puskas (he was not in the final), with Piri, Amansia, Serena...\n\n\"We saw off four European champions from Belgrade with a score of 12:0. Why should we not believe in our own strength now\", said Rašović via the Yugoslav press before the duel.\n\nAnd Partizan felt what it was like to be in the shoes of the European champions. However, only for a quarter of an hour. With Vasović's goal after a corner, the \"black and whites\" were in the lead from the 55th minute. But they fell. Probably, because they were prone to fall.\n\nBecause, we quote Politika reporter Ljubiša Vukadinović, \"the team panicked and almost all of them retreated to the defense\". In Šoškić's wing, the Belgraders slipped twice - in the 72nd minute, Amansio dribbled past Vasović and rattled the net. Three minutes later, Serena crowned the \"royal club\" with the sixth European laurel with a shot from twenty meters. Partizan was not a weaker team than Real. However, it was a smaller club, not up to the size of the final. Most of the \"black and white\" players entered the match for the European trophy with signed lucrative foreign contracts.\n\n\"The final, instead of being the crown of exceptional games until then, was our worst edition! - post festum, Rašović said ten days ago in an interview with Sports Journal. - The football club and the Sports Association took the game at Heysel lightly, in the style: what before we play, don't lose spectacularly and return to Belgrade.On the other hand, coach (Abdullah) Gegić and technician (Stanislav) Popescu were not up to the team.\n\nThe babies have grown up, and the \"black and white\" team broke up after the night in Brussels. Vasović moved to Ajax, Šoškić to Cologne, Kovačević to Nantes, Galić to Standard Liège, Jusufi to Eintracht...\n\nAnd Rašović, waiting for the age of 28 and getting permission to leave the country, stayed in Partizan for three years - sorry, the shadow of the champion Partizan - and collected ten appearances in the national team. He continued his career in 1969 and ended in 1974 with Borussia Dortmund, playing three seasons in the Bundesliga, two in the Regional League. From 1978 to 2008, he worked as an assistant coach and teacher of junior teams in Partizan.\n\n\"It's a shame, really, it was a unique opportunity to win the Champions Cup. We've never been closer, and we won't be... As things stand\".\n\nChance arranged that after Hejsel, Real played in the elite competition until 1998, when the title was won by another citizen of Tito - Predrag Mijatović.\n\nLike father, like son\n\nVital, upright as if still in command of the defense, 74-year-old Rašović revived memories of the glorious days of Partizan's babies at a ceremony in his Belgrade two weeks ago, on the occasion of half a century since the Brussels match...\n\nHis son Vuk, born in Dortmund in 1973, was a successful first team member of Partizan, made 5 appearances in the FR Yugoslavia jersey... As a defender, of course. In 2013, in the role of coach, he led the \"Black and White\" to the championship title. Since May 2015, he has been leading Dinamo Minsk, which conceded 26 goals in 13 matches last season in the Belarusian championship. Defense gene, you name it."
