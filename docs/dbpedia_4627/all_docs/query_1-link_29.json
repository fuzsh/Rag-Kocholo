        "text": "The statement that Montenegro has always been at the outskirts of greater worlds leads us into the domain of a classical Balkan story, where the intermingling of tradition and heritage, in this part of the world, is a consequence of the domination or presence of three major religious systems (Orthodox, Catholic and the Islamic). That is why the bond between spiritual and lay, the divine and the earthly, within the historical context inevitably produced a stereotype in historical conscience, where conflict is a \"natural\" state of the dominant \"war culture\" and of its interpretation as an existential reflex, that has its concrete manifestation in the comprehension of the present as the prolonged past. The modern Montenegrin state, internationally recognized at the Berlin Congress in 1878, became a multi-confessional community with its expansion to the surrounding cities (Nikšić, Podgorica, Bar, Ulcinj), and as a result entered the system of compliance with the rights of religious minorities and of ownership rights over entire real estate (Articles 29/30 of the Berlin Treaty). With the 1912 expansion during the Balkan wars, onto the areas of Pljevlja, Berane, Bijelo Polje, Plav, Gusinje and Metohija, Montenegro gained around 250 000 new subjects, over 80% of them non-Orthodox (160 000 Muslims and 25 000 Catholics). Namely, the population of around 140 000 that Montenegro had at the eve of the Berlin Congress grew to nearly 500,000 after the Balkan wars. (Andrijašević 2003) Within the given borders Montenegro entered the newly created Yugoslav state with a territory that hasn't been integrated in any aspect (state, culture, economy, religion). Then, after 1945, as one of the Yugoslav republics in a six-member federation it encompassed the area of Boka Kotorska (which has been under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian empire until 1918) and lost Metohija, which became an integral part of the Republic of Serbia. The historical dynamics of the territorial expansion of the Montenegrin state were essentially not complementary with the processes and the logic of the development of spiritual jurisdiction of the three dominant religions (Orthodox, Muslim and Catholic). Throughout the 19 th century conflicts were evident between different tendencies of encircling the governmental and the spiritual, namely the national and the religious, which became clearly visible at the end of 20 th century when the dissolution of the Yugoslav federation began. Such a position faced Montenegro with the challenge of taking a stand regarding exterior processes, and prompted at the same time the processes of internal regrouping, which were a direct consequence of the challenges imposed by the events in the surroundings, caused by the process of balancing the national and the religious. To understand the logic of the aforementioned processes, several historical facts should be taken into consideration: After the Berlin Congress held in 1878, the Orthodox Church in Montenegro (the Metropolitanate of Cetinje) enjoyed the status of official religion with the tendency of complementary state and spiritual jurisdictions. (Rastoder 1994) The issue of the relations between the Church and the State was regulated with the Constitution of 1905,\n\nThe politicized polarization of Montenegrin society around the question of Montenegrin statehood in the context of the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, finally leading to Montenegrin independence in 2006, is accompanied by a remarkable identity change toward a clear division between Serbian and Montenegrin nationhood. I situate this development within the long-term interference between Montenegrin and Serbian categories of identification in elite articulations of national identity in Montenegro during the twentieth century. In the early twentieth century, the Montenegrin and Serbian categories were concurrently available for national identification in the context of political modernization in the country. Reflecting the lasting political and broader societal relevance of nationhood during the Yugoslav twentieth century, diverging interpretations of the relation between both categories of nationhood have continuously substantiated political divides in Montenegro. One part of the political spectrum subordinated Montenegrin regional identity to Serbian nationhood, the other part attached increasingly far-reaching political demands to Montenegrin national identity while maintaining a sense of Serbian national identity in the domain of culture and ethnicity. In the course of the Yugoslav twentieth century, the complementary relation between both categories of nationhood was challenged by exclusive definitions of Serbian and Montenegrin nationhood, a development which has to be related to the continuous questioning of relations between various concurring categories of national identity available in Yugoslavia. The current institutionalization of Montenegrin nationhood in independent Montenegro and the development toward clear-cut Serbian and Montenegrin mono-national identities is leading to the regression of multiple nationhood among the broader population.\n\nThe recent invention of the new historical narrative, the creation of a separate language and foundation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church are the first steps in creating a new Montenegrin nation. The article reveals that those were the result of neither real cultural need nor break-through research methods that would confirm the arguments stated in the so-called Doclean narrative, discussed in this paper. As is the case in FYR of Macedonia, the next step will be to support these actions by creating the notion of material heritage which would emphasize the link to the early Mediaeval past, with the emphasis on the Docelan period. Even though the Institute for the Protection of Monuments has existed since 1948 and, it is reasonable to expect the foundation of an Archaeology Department within the University in the near future, with the task of uncovering the Montenegrin Doclean past, as the Doclean narrative further develops. Currently, the whole territory of Montenegro is covered by 22 museums. Of these, the most important is the complex in Cetinje, which celebrates the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty and Montenegrin sovereignty. However, as the Doclean narrative emphasizes the Catholic nature of St. John Vladimir, it is expected that the museums in coastal towns, together with their urban characteristics, will receive further reinterpretation, with greater emphasis on the Catholic heritage. Although the Serbian Orthodox Church celebrates not only Nemanjić kings, but also St. Peter of Cetinje and St. John Vladimir, it can be expected that the Montenegrin Orthodox Church will replace the Nemanjić saint-kings with the Catholic saints of coastal towns, arguing their Montenegrin ethnic identity.\n\nDuring the early nineties, a so-called nationalized and traditional Orthodox community has been revived in the republic of Montenegro. This community calls itself the Montenegrin Orthodox Church and claims to be the representative of a resurgent form of the traditional Orthodox Church in Montenegro, which according to themselves vanished in the formation of Yu-goslavia in 1918. Since 1993 they have therefore tried to claim local traditions, customs and places as part of their revitalized \" Montenegrin \" version of Eastern Orthodoxy. Up until now the research on this community has been limited and has only focused on the – often violent – struggle between this community and the Ser-bian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral. It is difficult to grasp the reach and extent of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in these studies – is the community a paper tiger or an actual existing and thriving church? This study will focus on a selection of religio-sociological key findings on this community in order to provide a more nuanced description of them. The emphasis will be on this community's existence and a discussion about the degree to which the transformation of Montenegrin society and the independence of the Montenegrin state at large have contributed to the formation of this organization."
