        "text": "The mess left behind by the unraveling of the tense political back-and-forth that strained Croatian politics for over a year was finally given a chance to be sorted out, this time by the newly appointed and highly energetic young officers whose victory only assured them of the righteousness of their cause. Ban Vladko Maček and Reformist leaders Matija Čanić, Miroslav Navratil, Andro Vrkljan and Mihajlo Lukić debated for days and nights on end how to exactly approach the breaking of Slavko Kvaternik's cult of personality and his overwhelming influence within the Royal Croatian Home Guard.\n\nAt long last, in early November, it was decided that a special council would be formed, consisting of the leading commanders and their deputies of each branch of the military (land army, air force, navy) as well as the newly appointed Minister of Armed Forces. The assembly would democratically elect the reforms that would be introduced to the reinvigorated Royal Croatian Home Guard, all the while holding civil discussions on the merits and lack thereof for each proposal put forth to the negotiating table. The Minister of Armed Forces was given the power of veto, as he was the only civil representative within the council, and also to alleviate Maček's fears of a potential military overthrow of the government, as the paranoid times under Kvaternik's thumb so often threatened to commit.\n\nDuring this time, the German representatives in Croatia decided to meddle with the creation of the council, believing that Maček would be allowing himself far too much independence in the conduct of the military, creating a dangerous space for possible dissent that could trouble the Nazi overseers in the puppet state. Therefore, a special advisory position was created for the assembly that would be occupied by a German. Additionally, the German appointee would also hold veto powers together with the Minister, in order to quell any far-fetched thoughts and ideas that could threaten German control of the vital communication lines between Germany and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe initial make-up of the Chief Generals' Headquarters (GGS – Glavni generalski stan) would include:\n\nMilan Pribanić [1] (b. 1889) – Merchant from Garešnica (Moslavina County), Captain of the Royal Yugoslav Army (retired in 1923). One of the leading interwar commanders of the HSS-formed Civil Protection. Believed by Maček to be among the most qualified and loyal people for the job.\n\nMiroslav Navratil (b. 1893) – Aerial ace of the Great War. Proved his loyalty numerous times by fighting for the Reformists since the beginning. Believed to have convinced Uzelac to voluntarily give up his position and retire.\n\nJakov pl. Machiedo (b. 1891) – Member of a noble family from Hvar. Graduated from the Aviation Academy in Wiener Neustadt. Held the rank of Colonel of the Air Force at the time of Kvaternik's overthrow.\n\nMatija Čanić (b. 1901) – Major General of the Royal Croatian Home Guard. Main instigator and leader of the Reformist disobedience that resulted in the downfall of the Teutons.\n\nMihajlo Lukić (b. 1886) – Graduated from the Military Academy in Vienna. Attended special tank training in France in 1931. Additionally, he commanded elite Slovene mountain units just before the Invasion of Yugoslavia.\n\nNikola Steinfel (b. 1889) – A controversial appointment, largely due to King Filip's interference that enabled Steinfel to take up the position of the Supreme Commander of the Naval Forces. Due to injuries sustained to his right leg during the Great War, Steinfel can always be seen using a cane in public.\n\nAndro Vrkljan (b. 1902) – The man usurped by Steinfel. Cousin of Head of the Opposition Mile Budak and former lecturer at the Naval Academy in Gruž (now located in the Republic of Ragusa) before joining the Reformists upon Čanić's invitation and the mounting dissatisfaction at Jakčin's lack of action.\n\nGlaise von Horstenau (b. 1882) – Plenipotentiary General to the Kingdom of Croatia. Remained neutral in the war against the Teutons, though he is more than glad that the conflict was brought to its conclusion in the least violent way possible. Serves as a deterrent for potential anti-Axis leanings of the GGS.\n\n​\n\nThe troops belonging to the recently befriended Chetnik units under numerous commanders proved to be quite a hurdle to overcome regarding their learning of proper military preparedness, which prompted Supreme Commander Čanić to urge the GGS to vote on their integration into the Gendarmerie, rather than the Armed Forces. The Headquarters voted overwhelmingly in favor, Minister Pribanić included, and Internal Affairs Minister Besarović agreed to the demotion with apprehension. The Chetnik higher-ups had to be convinced on many occasions, but after some time they relented and allowed the apparent slight on their pride to go through.\n\nA force of about two thousand Chetniks began their integration into the Gendarmerie, a process that would take at least half a year to be accomplished, with their numbers steadily increasing throughout that time. Some say that by the time of the great upheaval that would arrive in early July of 1943, the Chetniks numbered about 50% of readily available gendarmes at the disposal of Supreme Commander Zvonko Kovačević, though many deem this statistic to be overblown. Needless to say, the Chetnik influence within the Croatian Gendarmerie would only grow throughout much of 1943, not least of which due to the successful lobbying and (according to some) bribing done by some Representatives of the Croatian National Parliament, most well-known of whom were Matija Parac (SDS) and Dobroslav Jevđević (SDS). Their campaign was mostly focused on building unity, fraternity and forgiveness of past crimes between the Croat-majority Gendarmerie, the Chetniks and some of the Muslims who volunteered to join the force.\n\nMihailović was even quoted as saying jokingly that if the mother of Ante Starčević, the Father of the Homeland as many loved to say, was an ethnic Serb, then we could rightly call her the Grandmother of the Homeland, earning many laughs his comrades that attended the meeting of the Chetniks in Banja Luka. Unofficially, the Serb-dominated Gendarmerie formations henceforth became known as Milica Starčević Brigades by Croats, Serbs and Muslims alike.\n\nMP Matija Parac (left) and Gendarmerie commander Draža Mihailović (right) being interviewed by pro-regime journalists\n\n​\n\nThe legalization of the Chetnik movement in the Kingdom created an odd legal limbo for Mihailović, as he found himself condemned to death in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia whilst being a free citizen of Croatia following the amnesty granted to him and his subordinates. Nevertheless, the authorities in Croatia did not seem much perturbed by the fact (aside from Siegfried Kasche), in spite of Head Commissioner Miloš Trivunac frequently contacting King Filip and demanding Mihailović's extradition. It seemed as though Čiča's incredibly risky gamble paid off, as no condemnation ever arrived from London or from the Yugoslav Government-in-exile…\n\nThe Royal Croatian Home Guard, following the reforms and expansions, came to employ about seventy five thousand men in its service, six thousand of whom belonged to the Royal Croatian Air Force, fifteen hundred to the Royal Navy and ten thousand to the Gendarmerie, whilst the rest took upon the task of defending the nation within the Land Forces.\n\nThe training regimen consisted of two thousand servicemen being sent to Stockerau and other training camps in Germany for six to eight weeks at a time, and upon their return, their education would continue, with prominent Reformists leading the charge in fixing the past mistakes of the Teutons, making the formations more flexible under pressure and when facing sudden ambushes. Great help was also provided by Prince Christoph and his SS troops before the arrival of Reinhard Heydrich to supervise the setting up of ethnically-centered Schutzstaffel formations consisting of Croat citizens.\n\nA Chetnik (left), a Home Guardsman (center) and a member of the Yatagan-horde [2] (right) reading a newspaper on the outskirts of Sarajevo (Romanija County), June 1943\n\n​\n\nCommanders Čanić and Lukić, aside from expanding the numbers of the Land Forces, also committed themselves to completely overhauling the formations that had protected the nation for almost two years. Each county received at least three thousand ready troops to maintain order and peace in coordination with the Gendarmerie, though special care was put into assigning more men into the mountainous areas of central, southwestern and southern Croatia, where the Kingdom bordered the territories that were deemed as potential dangers to the security of Filip's realm (Governorate of Montenegro and Trivunac's Serbia)\n\nThe poljanka and feldgrau uniforms became mandatory, and each and every Home Guardsman was able to possess his own uniform, without any KJV or Austro-Hungarian uniforms that made the earlier incarnation of the Royal Home Guard seem more like a hastily put-together legion of different stages of history of the region.\n\nThe remaining Teutons were forcibly retired as part of the complete defeat of Kvaternik's ideas and unwanted influence, though most were, unlike Kvaternik, given rather poor government-funded pensions, which would at a later create more divisions and controversy that the government did not need nor desire.\n\nAnother development that would prove to be more than worrying was Čanić's insistence on buildung up Vladko Maček's own cult of personality, to instill rigid loyalty to the person of the Ban within his men and to force the King into an unenviable position. It is not known whether the Ban himself approved, but the process began in earnest in early 1943 following the reforms, and did not cease for the remainder of the war.\n\nSupreme Commander Navratil inherited the Air Force from his former superior and quickly went to work. In tandem with Čanić, the GGS decided that the Home Guard would employ Blitzkrieg-like tactics against any rebellious areas that would reject the control of the royal government, a complete U-turn from Uzelac's policy of utilizing the ZKH airplanes exclusively as reconnaissance and support in such scenarios. Famous aerial aces of the time such as Cvitan Galić became the rising stars of not only the war department, but the propaganda one as well. Even Mato Dukovac, Safet Boškić and Albin Starc [3] were interviewed on the Eastern Front, though their written reports and support of the Reformist cause came months after Stalingrad, due to the difficulties of transferring such information over huge distances.\n\nNo significant purchases of new aircraft had occurred during the first half of 1943, as Navratil believed that in order to make the ZKH a force to be reckoned with, it has got to learn to utilize the equipment at its disposal to its fullest capability before it would deserve expansion. The respect and influence Navratil would garner over the coming months would result in the Air Force unofficially adopting the Heart with an Arrow (a design on Navratil's Albatross DIII with which he scored nine aerial victories in 1918) as its coat of arms, together with the classic checkerboard coat of arms of Croatia.\n\nThe seas, or at least the few reefs and stones in the Adriatic that Croatia had dominion over after the Treaty of Marburg in June 1941, were rocked once more, in spite of the apparent wave of positive normalcy seemingly enveloping the nation in a protective embrace. Due to countless outside restrictions, the Navy of the Kingdom got the raw end of the deal when compared to its brethren within the Royal Home Guard. Supreme Commander Steinfel proved to be less an able military man and more an ineffective yes-man to his financier's whims, whoever they were.\n\nAs the other two branches of the Home Guard evolved and progressed nicely, the Navy remained a hotbed of corruption and unproductive work, leading Glaise von Horstenau to derogatorily name Steinfel Die Puppe [4] as the civilians had to take matters into their own hands and patrol the bits and pieces of Croatian seaside on their own, in their little wooden fishing boats with improvised weaponry whilst Nikola Steinfel and his cronies sat around doing nothing, though that statement does seem quite inaccurate when the events of June 2, 1943 are considered.\n\nThe Thaon-Steinfel Agreement (Sporazum Thaon-Steinfel in Croatian), as it came to be known, would turn out to be one of the most unpopular decisions made by the GGS during its existence. Signed by Italian representative Paolo Thaon di Revel [5], 1st Duke of the Sea and Marshal of the Kingdom and Croatian representative Nikola Steinfel, Supreme Commander of the Naval Forces and Admiral of the KHRM in Split, the treaty denoted the Italian purchase of the unfinished destroyer Split as well as the salvage ship Spasilac, both of which were sitting in the Split harbor with low-to-nonexistent maintenance, mainly due to poor financing from the government and Jakčin's (and later Steinfel's) lack of interest in their usage.\n\nPribanić vocally protested the decision, and a quote attributed to him at one of the GGS meetings states that Croatian pride and defiance were sold for a fistful of helers to an old fart and his seafaring dogs by a man no better than them (but many believe the choice and delivery of said words to be an exaggeration, so the truth may never be known). It is known, though, that he called for Steinfel's sacking and Vrkljan's ascension, but oddly enough the Minister of Armed Forces did not veto the treaty going into signing, more than likely because of King Filip's threats aimed at him and his family if he were to kill what the Golden Lion hoped would be the chance for warmer relations between his and his father-in-law's realms. Horstenau, on the other hand, allowed it to pass as he believed Italy would need all the machinery possible to beat back the Allied invasion of Sicily that began on May 9, even if said machinery would be used for scraps.\n\nContrary to Pribanić's perceived statements, the sum paid by the Italian government was actually stated by many historians to be more than hefty, in spite of the seriously destabilizing situation bestowed upon the Apennine peninsula by Farinacci's regime. Unfortunately, the money, even if it reached Croatian coffers, was somehow lost in the black hole of corruption opened by Steinfel, and much of the payout for Croatian ships never saw the light of day, even after all these years. As one last sign of a lack of respect by Farinacci, the destroyer that ended up in Naples got renamed to Spalato, the Italian name for Diocletian's city, a certain sign that Italy's claims to the remainder of the Croatian coast were still not extinguished.\n\nTwo ZKH servicemen relaxing by a Junkers W 34 in Mostar, 1943\n\n​\n\nMeanwhile, the man who held the strings of everything related to the military for over eighteen months, the man who could have had everything had he wanted it more, was given official recognition as Count of Ozalj [6] and free reign to do however he pleased with around a dozen thousand of the town's inhabitants. The post-resignation Kvaternik-Maček Agreement also allowed some of the state funds to pour into the Kvaternik Family's coffers, in order to bolster the development of Ozalj and its economic importance within the Kingdom of Croatia. Slavko Kvaternik retreated into retirement to the renovated Ozalj Castle where he would remain secluded under a veil of privacy from the public at large for almost two years.\n\nAccording to a few of Kvaternik's biographers, chief among them being Slavko Degoricija [7], the former Supreme Commander of the Home Guard would have been lost to depression, silent brooding and the influence of alcohol much like his ministerial predecessor had it not been for Olga Kvaternik, who successfully managed to redirect her husband's attention [8] from the harmful substance to something else entirely – book collecting. The intriguing idea soon proved to be Kvaternik's salvation, as he completely devoted himself to buying out books, manuscripts, scrolls and codices of all shapes, sizes and genres, that soon began to occupy the numerous rooms of Ozalj Castle.\n\nThe once neat and nicely decorated halls of the sprawling Gothic fortress soon became a cluttered mess of reading material in numerous languages, ranging from Croatian, German, Italian and even some undesirable American books that the Kvaterniks managed to smuggle into Croatia thanks to the former Vrhovnik's hefty pension he received from the government on a monthly basis. This course of action caught the playful ire of Olga, who (according to Degoricija) oft-teased her husband to clean the mess that kept amassing in the rooms of the historical complex-turned home. This, in turn, would result in some of the most fascinating events of the Second World War in on the territory of the First Yugoslavia.\n\nBeginning in late January, Kvaternik hired notable architect Milovan Kovačević to create a viable layout and gather the finest material for the construction of a library that would store hundreds upon hundreds of books that have been gathering in the Kvaternik residence. Needless to say, Kovačević soon provided the former Supreme Commander with what later came to be known as one of the most attractive building designs of wartime Europe, proving his reputation attained thanks to his former employer Ignjat Fischer [9] (who is also believed to have assisted Kovačević in creating the plan for the library, though secretly, due to his Jewish ancestry preventing him from participating in public works by law).\n\nSlavko Kvaternik would lay the foundations for the building in early April, officially beginning the construction of his newfound passion project. The endeavor came to be quite popular locally, with people from Prigorje County frequently visiting to see the progress on one of the most ambitious ventures in recent memory, though the newspapers told a wholly different story. While the HOSP-financed publications gleefully presented the happenings in Ozalj in a positive light, they were few and far between, with the hegemony of the state-run media proving too high a burden to overcome. It seemed as though Ivanko Farolfi's mission given to all his subordinates was to utterly and fully erase the Kvaterniks from public memory, as not a single story centered on one of the most well-known Croatian families was published by his underlings since the elder Kvaternik's resignation. This status quo would remain intact all the way up to the chaotic events of the following year.\n\nCount Kvaternik laying the foundations of the new Royal Library, Ozalj, April 1943​\n\nCroatia's situation, though, seemed a unique occurrence in the grand scheme of things. The war was escalating everywhere else but the small German-backed statelet, as the campaign in Africa turned in the favor of the Western Allies, whilst the Soviets managed to force the surrender of the German Sixth Army in Stalingrad, and to shocking results too…\n\n​\n\nIn. Out. In. Out. In. Out.\n\nHe fell out of reality as if on a boat rocked by a hundred sea storms. The image of debris and pieces of concrete overcoming his vision in an instant. In a lone moment the unforgiving weight of shame crushing his shoulders came to be replaced by unconsciousness, beset on all sides by the bits of the building he had foolishly deemed safe.\n\nThe calm he had always associated with death did not come, and he thought it a fitting punishment for the misdeeds he had passively observed. The men of his own country, having lost any and all human sympathy a self-respecting Christian possessed once the black coats of despair were upon their shoulders, sowed death upon the fields and homes his armies had claimed, and only now did he understand just what had occurred, in spite of his memories playing cruel games on the few moments of clarity he had the fortune of gaining in this troubled time.\n\nOpening his eyes, despite the action seeming like one of the toughest tasks he had to accomplish in his life, the man tried to take in his surroundings, though all he could see were white blankets of ice, his heart skipping a few beats as he heard voices, so distant from his ears that he had thought the Reaper himself was approaching to make his sentence known to the world. The words leaving the mysterious figure did not make themselves any familiar as it approached. Fear overcame him. Could this be the end?\n\nLooking up to the sky for some semblance of salvation, he let out a heavy breath he did not know he had been withholding for so long. The clouds in the sky were innumerable, making the white hell around him all the more realistic. The only colors jumping out at him from the unfortunate blur were gray and black, and they were moving too. His heart froze over once more, the idea of which he deemed impossible after so much time spent in the frost-ridden landscapes of the East.\n\nThe intruder looked over him, and his eyesight did not do him any favors, the face of the creature still being a jumbled mess of different colors. He could see its mouth move, but the sound only reverberated within his skull, the headache he felt since regaining consciousness only becoming stronger.\n\n„Jeste li budni?“\n\nIt did not sound anything like German. Dear God… The Soviets had captured him. The end was near, he knew it now, as pictures of a painful march over the snowy graveyards of the East began drowning his mind. He raised his left hand over his face in some vain attempt at blocking out the rough hands that would no doubt restrain him and kill whatever strength remained in his frail body.\n\n„Would you like some water?“\n\nThe German spoken was rough, a sure sign of a non-native speaker, but after no attempts at forcible imprisonments came in the span of the few painful moments that followed, he nodded his head weakly in affirmation.\n\nThe other man fished out the canteen from his holster, opening the lid and handing it out to the lying German. He took it and drank its contents heartily, no shame in his lost eyes ever making itself known.\n\n„Who… Who are you?“\n\n„Captain Kovačić of the Latin Legion, Sixth Army of the Wehrmacht.“\n\nOh… At the very least it was one of his own men. Other questions, though, soon replaced the safety he suddenly felt around him. The rubble that drowned out his rationality and ability to think emerged once more.\n\n„D-do you recall what happened?“\n\n„That I do, Generalfeldmarschall.“\n\nNodding absentmindedly, trying to gather the words coming out of the subordinate in front of him, the Field Marshal dropped the canteen onto the icy floor, losing the strength in his left arm in the process.\n\n„Out with it, then.“\n\n„The building you were in collapsed, and my platoon managed to dig you out of the rubble. The situation was desperate, we barely managed to evade capture by the Reds… My comrades did not make it.“\n\nThe pain on his face was palpable, hitting him like a ton of bricks even if he were utterly unaware during the dramatic process. Kovačić continues.\n\n„We heard orders of the Sixth Army's surrender, but we were already out of the city before the message got sent.“\n\nThis could only mean bad things… He would be deemed a deserter if word got out, a filthy traitor to be shot like the rest of them. They had to get back to the nearest German camp.\n\n„We must go.“\n\n„I am afraid that would not be possible. Soviet death squads are already searching far and wide for you, and our own men too.“\n\n„I-I order you, Captain!“\n\n„Please, conserve your strength, we are still not out of danger.“\n\nIn his rage, he attempted to stand up and to berate the rebellious soldier before him, but he only landed with a thud, hitting his head on the cold ground behind him, drifting once more to the lands of darkness and loss.\n\n*****\n\n​\n\nA Hopeful Retreat cover – 1894 painting done by Russian landscape painter Alexei Savrasov (called Sea of Mud, or alternatively Rasputitsa)\n\n[1] IOTL he played a significant role in establishing the Independent State of Croatia, when (at the beginning of the Invasion of Yugoslavia) he commanded 800 members of the Croatian Protection Rangers (name of the Bosnian branch of the Croatian Civil Protection) in taking control of Mostar, Sarajevo and Nevesinje, in which he was majorly successful.

The guy endures the same kind of political pressure as IOTL as he was forbidden from openly enjoying architecture and making designs as he had ever since his graduation from Prague Architectural Institute in 1896.\n\nAs new life was finally breathed into the troubled Royal Croatian Home Guard after everything it had gone through, the Germans stationed in Croatia had other plans they desired to put into motion. With the arrival of Reinhard Heydrich, newly appointed Head of the Schutzstaffel after Himmler's death, to Zagreb on January 20 following his short stay in the occupied Slovene lands, the Nazis could gain an even stronger foothold in the resilient Axis puppet state.\n\nThe reception to the Man With the Iron Heart was grand, with tens of thousands of people arriving to Ban Jelačić Square to greet the man they blindly perceived as one of the countless German liberators from almost two years before, though propaganda had much to do with such an outcome. The scene of such a large, satisfied crowd came to greatly resemble Maček's Promise of a Clean Regime speech on April 7, 1941.\n\nUnder the King's command, Heydrich was invited to stay at Castle Brezovica during the following few weeks, which he reluctantly accepted, though not before stationing one hundred of his black-coated soldiers on castle grounds, the memories of failed assassination plots and the bombing attempt on his life in Paris that he had avoided by blind luck still fresh in his mind.\n\nHeydrich after the meeting with Carinthian Gauleiter Friedrich Reiner, January 1943\n\n​\n\nThe Golden Lion alone negotiated the status of the SS in Croatia with the Butcher of Paris, his eagerness greatly pleasing Heydrich, who reportedly carried out his ambitious plans in a single night and without much resistance from Filip. The new Head of the SS was very aware of the Croatian government's lack of drive toward finding the solution to the Jewish Question that Heydrich himself had asked during the Wannsee Conference over a year ago. Demanding from Filip to look into the matter in more depth in the coming weeks, he left Zagreb on February 2, 1943.\n\nThe King immediately invited Ljudevit Tiljak, by far the most infamous detective within the City of Zagreb, to his castle in Brezovica to discuss the matter in more depth. Tiljak, already having his doubts of possible collusion between the government higher-ups and Miroslav Freiberger, Chief Rabbi of Zagreb, conceived a plan that would finally break the alleged Jewish stranglehold on the servants of the Croat people (according to Tiljak), and one that Filip apparently approved of, though there are contradictory claims that state Filip was firmly against it – the kidnapping of Freiberger's only son Ruben [1] a mere ten-year-old boy at the time. Needless to say, the chief detective had many supporters within the force, and even more extremists who were willing to commit such a heinous crime.\n\nOn February 11, 1943 word of the boy's disappearance reached Vladko Maček, who was at a loss as to what do to in such circumstances. Despite the firm alliance between the two men going all the way back to the time of King Filip's coronation, the Ban contacted Alojzije Stepinac in hopes of reaching out to members of the Gendarmerie to investigate the matter, but their plights were largely ignored. The case would soon go cold, with the apparent lack of interest from the authorities killing any and all hopes of the boy's emergence, or at least it would appear to be so until 1948 and his discovery, one that would only destabilize the political situation in the region even more than it already was.\n\nIn the meantime, thousands upon thousands of volunteers would sign up upon witnessing the colorful SS-sponsored posters, whose strong imagery instilled a sense of foreboding that could only be quenched by joining the two new black-coated divisions that sprang up in January and February 1943.\n\nThe 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS, shortly named Handschar [2], would be formed on January 31, 1943 with approximately ten thousand servicemen ready to commit to the cause, with additional five thousand joining before summer 1943. Under the command of Artur Phleps [3], with its motto Handžaru – Udaraj! (Handschar – Strike!), the unit would become among the most feared formations of the Second World War, although many of their most influential contributions to the wider world would come after the war. After receiving its blessings both religious and political from Amin al-Husseini [4], the division was officially deemed ready for action.\n\nDue to its oath of loyalty exclusively to Hitler first and foremost, then the King and the Ban, the Handschar Division would become the hotbed for Muslim autonomists, neo-Ottomanists, members of the Young Muslims [5] and many other militants who had rejected the Croatian political option espoused by the Kulenovićs and other HMO members in the National Parliament. Headed by chief ideologue and Vice President of the Young Muslim movement Mustafa Busuladžić [6] as well as Imam Halim Malkoč, the Handschar would come to safeguard the extremists who would begin to openly reject Croatian statehood and embrace the fight for an independent Bosniak nation-state in the coming years.\n\nSome of those extremists and members of the 13th Waffen-SS Mountain Division included Halid Kajtaz, Tarik Muftić, Alija Izetbegović and Husejin Biščević, all of whom would leave their pan-Islamic, anti-communist and antisemitic mark on the military and political landscape of both the region and the wider world after the most destructive conflict in human history.\n\nAlija Izetbegović praying during the Third Balkan War in Gjakovë, 1990s\n\n​\n\nThe Muslims were not the only ones receiving the recognition they deemed due, as the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS was founded merely days after Handschar. On February 4, the Orthodox Christians of the Croat nation would come to form the so-called Leptiriza Division [7] of the Schutzstaffel. Populated by mostly Orthodox Serbs and under the command of Standartenführer August Schmidhuber [8], with blessings from Germogen Maximov [9], member of the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, the Division would soon field more than ten thousand Serbs, while the rest would be populated by mostly Catholics of the Kingdom.\n\nUnlike the Handschar Division, Leptiriza would not see action as soon is its Muslim brothers in arms would. The Muslim formation would be sent to the Apennine Peninsula during the summer in hopes of suppressing the American Eagle's advance towards Rome, to mixed results. Leptiriza, on the other hand, remained in Croatia and became witness to the chaos that would envelop the country in a discomforting embrace, one that would not cease until early 1944.\n\nLeft: coat of arms of the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)\n\nRight: coats of arms of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Leptiriza (2nd Croatian)\n\n​\n\nThe GGS (or some select parts of it, at least) looked on the SS-centered developments within the country with much worry, and Supreme Commander Čanić decided not to seek the vote of the Headquarters regarding what he deemed an important choice to pursue. The two units fighting in the Drina Borderlands since the beginning of the war, Ibrahim's Guard and the Hadžiefendić Legion [10], were small Muslim-majority armies whose sole purpose was the protection of its brethren against the Chetnik massacres and slaughters that were prevalent during the instability that the Republic (and later the Kingdom) endured in its first few years.\n\nThe two would become famous for their strong advocacy of pro-Croatian attitudes among the Muslim populace, and were widely endorsed by the Kulenović brothers and their political party. Despite all that, they were irregular units that had to be homogenized into the official Armed Forces of the Kingdom. With that in mind, the GGS was outraged upon finding out that Čanić desired to avoid the vote, but upon the Naval and Air Force representatives pressing the issue, Milan Pribanić vetoed the motion that the vote had to take place. Horstenau quietly agreed with the Minister.\n\nOn March 1, a large ceremony in Velika Kladuša officially marked the beginning of the Muslim-majority units within the Royal Croatian Home Guard. Headed by both Ibrahim Pirić-Pjanić and Muhamed Hadžiefendić, each member of the Yatagan-horde (Jatagan-horda in Croatian) had to personally take the oath of loyalty to both the King and the Ban, but many believe that because of Čanić's influence much focus was instead aimed towards the latter, if later events of World War II in Croatia are to be taken into account.\n\nInstead of sporting a classic royal red checkerboard as other Home Guardsmen did, the Muslims were allowed to bear a green-and-white checkered shield, with a golden crown and a green crescent moon soaring above it.\n\nOne of the ceremonial yatagans and its holster, a signature symbol of the Yatagan-horde of the Royal Croatian Home Guard\n\n​\n\nIn Ozalj, during this time, the 150-member company of the Gendarmerie stationed in the town greeted its new Count. Kvaternik, upon reading a few books concerning Slavic mythology became enamored with the idea of vukojarci, or weregoats as they were called. The mysterious shape-shifting creatures caught the former Supreme Commander's attention, making him extend his nickname of the Old Goat to the police force that helped guard the small town he had grandiose plans for.\n\nIn a speech before an audience of about four hundred Ozalj denizens on February 4, 1943, Kvaternik called forth the chief commanders of the Gendarmerie, calling them the Weregoats that this town [Ozalj] needs in this dire time, to uphold the laws and order this great nation [Croatia] strives for since its independence. The commanders were baffled at the idea, but found it hard to refuse when Slavko Kvaternik lowered himself from the podium onto the ground, carried a wooden box in front of each of them before fishing a special badge with the Kvaternik coat of arms on it – a proud silver goat on a brown shield. Needless to say, the younger officers were much more enthused and proud at the attention and respect shown from such a revered figure, from their perspective at least.\n\nThe Weregoats would, under the old Count's supervision, endure a special training regimen that was much closer to that of the Land Forces of the Home Guard than that of the auxilliary gendarmes that they were used to. Old habits die hard, and the former Number 1 of the Royal Croatian Home Guard could not abandon his roots, no matter how hard he would try in the coming months.\n\nWeregoats during training, spring 1943\n\n​\n\nWhilst seemingly every ethnic group seemed to have been busy during the winter of 1943, the Slovenes also played along with the dynamic goings-on in the country. The Slovenian National Council knew that it had to catch up to the deteriorating situation in the occupied Slovene Lands. Frankly, the leftist OF-backed uprising caught more and more steam, as Mario Roatta and his utterly genocidal policy aimed against the Slavs in the Lubiana Province was stopped abruptly after Operation Tartarus and his relocation to Zara.\n\nIt seemed as though the leftists would carry the message of a liberated Slovenia into the hearts and minds of the commoners whilst the SNS would sit around in their marble castles far and away from the dangers imposed on their people. Alas, the internal vote that took place on February 4, 1943 would change the political landscape within the Slovene-populated northwest radically. It was decided (unanimously, as some claim) that the Council would revive the guerrilla movement that fought for freedom since the beginning of the occupation in the early 1920s – TIGR.\n\nStanding for Trieste, Istria, Gorizia and Rijeka (Fiume), the movement caused massive headaches to the burgeoning fascist government of Benito Mussolini during much of his reign. Unfortunately, by the time of the Black Duce's overthrow in 1941, the freedom fighters were utterly broken, and they were de jure rendered nonexistent on the battlefield, just a mere footnote in the history of the region.\n\nWhat little men remained soon joined the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation or just became inactive, which was especially evident during the Second Trieste Trial [11] in December 1941, when over forty guerrillas were sentenced to death and executed over the coming months by the bloodthirsty White Duce in his quest for acceptance and glory by the wider Italian public.\n\nThe new formation would, in the minds of the councilmen, inherit the fighting spirit of Vladimir Gortan [12] and his comrades, free from the ideological weights that communism and anationalist elements of the OF presented to the vulnerable Slovene men and women. The Tigers, as they would be named after their famous predecessors, became tacitly supported by many elements of the Royal Croatian Home Guard, some members of the GGS included, and they would only grow in size from a measly platoon of fifteen rebels to guiding thousands of men under its blue banner by the time of the war's end.\n\nThe first anti-fascist action committed by the Tigers was an ambush on a wandering convoy of the MVAC [13] soldiers on the outskirts of Črnomelj. Headed by a Captain under the nom de guerre of Kajtimir [14], the attack on May 4 was a tremendous success, with a much smaller force overcoming the larger group of occupiers, capturing their weapons and equipment and retreating back into the forests and mountains of southeastern Slovenia.\n\nWar flag of the Tigers, the newest guerrilla unit in the occupied Slovene lands\n\n*****\n\n​\n\n[1] Ruben was actually saved by being sent to Mandatory Palestine in late 1942 IOTL, but due to the formation of the antisemitic King's Guard and Filip's secret police (KOZD) frequently raiding houses based on false suspicions ITTL, he was unable to be escorted in time, which resulted in his disappearance.\n\n[2] A type of fighting knife or sword commonly used by the Ottoman police during the Empire's rule over the Balkans.\n\n[3] A Transylvanian Saxon by birth, he had been an active member of the Romanian military in the interwar period all the way until his resignation, as a result of being sidelined due to his opposition to the government.

Despite calling itself both antifascist and anticommunists, many of its members participated in the Handschar Division IOTL, whilst others were merely associated with it, which led to many faux trials and executions after WWII.\n\n[6] Bosniak writer, intellectual and scientist. A notorious antisemite and pan-Islamist, he was an excellent speaker which often garnered him large audiences during his speeches throughout Bosnia in the interwar period. He was a polyglot, knowing six languages in total (including his native language). As Vice President of the Young Muslims, he promoted a Muslim identity separate from both Croatian and Serbian ones.\n\n[7] I named it after a genuinely disturbing 1973 Yugoslav horror film called Leptirica (lit.

Since 1924 he was a member of the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, which was based in Sremski Karlovci, Yugoslavia. Due to his close proximity to the utter bloody chaos that was the Second World War in Yugoslavia, he was declared Head of the Croatian Orthodox Church in 1942 IOTL, and executed after the war by the communists because of it.\n\n[10] Indeed, both existed in OTL with the same purpose. As a small reminder, Ibrahim's Guard committed war crimes during the War for Dalmatia in Chapter II.X.\n\n[11] One of many trials focused on destroying TIGR and its cells in occupied territories. IOTL only a few of the men were sentenced to death and subsequently executed, whilst others got large prison sentences that would be overturned with the capitulation of Italy.

After being captured by the Italian authorities, Gortan and his comrades were all sentenced to death by firing squad, but due to Papal intervention, Mussolini decided to randomly pick only one man to be shot from the captured crowd. The choice fell onto Gortan…\n\n[13] Acronym standing for Milizia Volontaria Anti Comunista, an Italian-sponsored local armed auxiliary units composed of Chetniks and Slovene anti-Partisans in Italian-occupied parts of Yugoslavia.

ITTL he is fortunate enough to be part of the lucky eleven who managed to evade capture and execution after the Rihemberk Siege.\n\nThe hardest cross I have to bear is the Cross of Lorraine.\n\n​\n\n– Winston Churchill commenting his support of the Free French Forces, January 1943\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThough the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Northern Hemisphere connect February to harsh weather and a test of patience for the coming spring reawakening, the leaders of the Free World became witnesses to completely opposite conditions, as it was proven that the port town of Casablanca, a settlement that hugged the vast Atlantic from the coasts of liberated French Morocco, certainly could host less than enviable atmosphere for negotiations that would change the fate of the entire planet in a few years.\n\nAmong the most important heads of the Western Allies seated at the picturesque Anfa Hotel were Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, as well as Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, though they were far from being the only ones attending the all-important meeting of the Allied war effort. While cooperation, coordination and concord were cited as the main reasons of arranging the Casablanca summit, the goings-on behind the scenes were anything but that, as the two politicians found themselves growing increasingly frustrated at the events unfolding slowly in Africa.\n\nThe main causes for such a depressed scene of Roosevelt and Churchill's were François Darlan, Admiral of the French State Navy as well as Marie-Pierre Kœnig [1], standing in vehement opposition to the seafarer. The United States, due to joining the war much later than Britain, still recognized the French State as the legitimate successor of the Third French Republic that was abolished in 1940. This state of affairs caused much tension with the British soldiers and many political leaders, who demanded Darlan's arrest and punishment for his work for the Axis during the height of the war. Roosevelt and Churchill, however, undrestood that a deal had to be reached with the Admiral, as the British Bulldog reluctantly defended the decision in a secret session of the House of Commons - I am sorry to have to mention a point like this, but it makes a lot of difference to a soldier whether a man fires his gun at him, or at an enemy...\n\nNevertheless, much has changed in the meantime, as Operation Torch, launched on November 8, 1942 suddenly opened a new can of worms few would have liked to see. The amphibious landings in North Africa, in their first couple of days, were immediately halted by the fierce Vichy French resistance, with progress being slow and quite worrying for the Allied military, with some more pessimistically inclined individuals even believing the attempt should be cancelled and the troops returned back to Britain and the States. Axis triumph, however, was not meant to be.\n\nAdmiral Darlan, according to Alphonse Juin and many of his junior officers, grew weary of the frail state of Pétain's nation's neutrality following numerous breaches of the 1940 Compiègne Armistice by Heydrich, Himmler as well as Hitler himself, and it is believed that for these reasons the Admiral of the French Navy decided to turn his back on the Germans and side with his enemies. Therefore, upon receiving word of the invasion of one of Vichy Government's colonies, the former Vice President of the Council ordered Gabriel Auphan [2] and Jean de Laborde [3] to refuel the ships stationed at Toulon hastily whilst préfet maritime of the city André Marquis [4] was responsible for delaying the German response through peaceful means (initially, but if the Germans were to use force, the French would be allowed to fire back), in order to allow as many ships to escape from the harbor as possible.\n\nIt was a risky endeavor, but one that had to be attempted at all costs, at least in Darlan's eyes, as the potential success of the operation would have also resulted in unprecedented promotions to his name and title that could have made him a kingmaker in the decision-making process of the Western Allies.\n\nAll in all, out of one hundred and sixty four ships located in Toulon, eighty four were able to leave the harbor before the Germans stormed the city, forty eight were scuttled, whilst the rest were captured by the German armies (even though almost half of those were sabotaged and utterly worthless for later use). Of those successfully saved and escorted to southern Mediterranean were:\n\n1 battleship (Strasbourg)\n\n3 cruisers\n\n10 destroyers\n\n9 submarines\n\n4 torpedo boats\n\n3 patrol boats\n\n7 auxilliary ships\n\n15 tugs\n\n32 other small ships\n\nLaborde was able to evade imprisonment by the German troops by refusing to follow or even help Darlan [5] over the uncertain waves of the Mediterranean to Morocco, but Auphan and Marquis were not so lucky. Both men were arrested by the members of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, enduring months of torture by Heydrich's most loyal men before being relocated to Germany. In addition, Chief of State Pétain condemned them (including Darlan) as traitors to the French nation whilst praising Laborde's actions. This, in turn, would create even more problems for the Hero of Toulon (the title Laborde received by the Vichy press), who would become relentlessly persecuted for his apparent crimes by the post-war French government and his name would become synonymous with the word traitor in French-speaking countries and territories, much like the more widely known and accepted word quisling.\n\nThe explosion at Toulon destroys Vichy French ships during the dramatic battle, November 9, 1942\n\n​\n\nThe situation in North Africa, despite showing promise following Mussolini's fall from power and the disarray that almost broke apart the Italian troops working closely with Erwin Rommel, was not capitalized upon properly by the British Empire. Despite initial minor successes, Claude Auchinleck as commander of the British Eighth Army entered an unfortunate stalemate with the Desert Fox, a series of see-saw triumphs and defeats for both sides that would last for the latter half of 1941 and much of 1942. With that in mind, a worried British Bulldog would demand change in leadership.\n\nOut goes the Auk, in goes the Strafer [6]. A man of Churchill's caliber, to be certain – aggressive, bull-headed and quite popular with his troops for his toughness and resolve. Unfortunately for the British Prime Minister, he did not take into account William Gott's exhaustion that had built up after over two years of warfare in the inhospitable desert. Brooke, as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, , noticed this during the final meeting between him and Gott, but Churchill did not want to hear any of it as the Strafer, being the dutiful serviceman he is, obediently accepted his new position as Auchinleck's replacement.\n\nAnd what a costly mistake it turned out to be, as Gott nigh snatched defeat from the jaws of victory during the summer and early fall of 1942, as Rommel almost destroyed all British armor and equipment that found itself in the barraged sands of Africa. At the seemingly last possible moment, the landings of Torch had occurred, with Allied commanders Patton, Kent Hewitt and Montgomery [7] brilliantly turning the tide in Allied favor, in spite of fierce resistance during the initial days of the operation. Additionally, Darlan's navy arrived and ordered all hostilities cease immediately. Vichy troops obeyed.\n\nThe Admiral entered negotiations with Dwight David Eisenhower, which ended in his appointment as High Commissioner of French North and West Africa, effectively bringing said area under his direct and most of all dictatorial control. The Allied press was less than impressed at the ensuing events in North Africa, citing Darlan's dubious ties with the Pétain Government whilst others praised the Chief of the French State's second-in-command's show of remorse and apparent wish for repentance he showed by siding with the United States and Britain.\n\nThe Free French under de Gaulle were furious, as their chances for gaining recognition as the sole pro-Allied French government were dashed. Cyrano [8] ordered a hastened Free French invasion of Fezzan from FF-controlled Equatorial Africa, but before the venture could gain any prominent support among the Western Allies, it quickly petered out in December after Eisenhower forbade military conduct that was not widely accepted by other members of the United Nations.\n\nHistorians shall never know how the FF would have conducted themselves in 1943, for the organization would have its wind taken out of its sails on Christmas Eve, when Charles de Gaulle was killed in a strafing run by a purported German airplane that had found itself at the right place and at the right time. Immediately, all fingers were pointed accusatorily at Darlan, though he denied any and all rumors implicating him in the tragedy, even outright denouncing the assassination committed by the conniving Germans.\n\nThe Free French Forces found themselves in utter disarray, and it had taken a few weeks before de Gaulle's successor had finally emerged – Pierre-Marie Kœnig, distinguished commander that had emerged victorious over Erwin Rommel [9] in several clashes between the Free French and the combined Wehrmacht-Regio Esercito forces. Reluctant to take the position at first, Kœnig accepted the burdensome title, knowing very well that the cooperation between France Libre and innumerable resistance cells with leftist, socialist and communist leanings in mainland France died together with a unifying figure of de Gaulle's gravitas. While a movement almost destroyed, its leaders vowed to protect the colonies they had already controlled by that point – Syria, Lebanon, Equatorial Africa, French India, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, New Hebrides, Chinese concession of Guangzhouwan, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and Madagascar (though Gaullist control of the island already began to disintegrate in the coming months [10]).\n\nAs for the Strafer, he faded into the background gradually after Torch, mostly due to the lights being focused upon Bernard Law Montgomery and his inventive and vigorous approach to desert warfare, one that would pile success upon success against the ever weaker Desert Fox. He became the British military attaché to Cairo in mid-1943 once the Axis danger in North Africa was finally vanquished, whereupon he struck an unlikely friendship with King Farouk of Egypt and became an important ally of future Prime Minister Ahmad Maher Pasha [11] in each of his terms in office. Furthermore, the loud and boisterous Gott would be one of the attendees of the 1947 Juba Conference, where he was a staunch supporter of a continuing Anglo-backed Egyptian-Sudanese union.\n\nKœnig, de Gaulle's successor and the defender of his ideals (according to Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque)\n\n​\n\nThe Conference, codenamed SYMBOL, took place from January 28 to February 8 and was intended to host Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union as well as Chiang Kai-Shek of the Republic of China in addition to the aforementioned Churchill of Britain and Roosevelt of the United States. Both men declined to attend, though, with Stalin citing the Siege of Stalingrad as the reason for his inability to arrive on time whilst Chiang could not afford to lose time by traveling such large distances away from where his troops needed him. Of course, the two would be duly informed of the conference results at the nearest opportunity.\n\nThe main agenda of the meeting would concern the future of the Allied war effort, as victory in the sands was a nigh certainty at that point. While the US Army Chief of Staff George Marshall advocated for a cross-Channel invasion of France and then the rest of Europe, Alan Brooke thought otherwise, as he believed the time was far from right for such an ambitious venture. He deemed Sicily as the perfect island for an Allied assault that would, in a best case scenario, bog down German reserves in the Apennines and allow the Western Allies the opportunity to storm the Atlantic Wall against the weakened and tired Axis defenders. Ultimately, the British Chiefs of Staff won the debate.\n\nRoosevelt, meanwhile, criticized the British for what he claimed was meager commitment to the war effort in the Pacific Ocean, and Churchill vowed to increase the Imperial troop numbers to aid the Americans against Japan, while FDR would, in turn, accede to Brooke's idea of attacking Italy first. Also, the Conference declared that aid to the Soviets as enforced through the Lend Lease Act would increase tremendously, in order to help Stalin with the offensive he had promised to enact in coordination with the Allies in the western reaches of Europe.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything could go according to plan in Casablanca, and the chief instigators of such developments were, without any reasonable doubt, Kœnig and Darlan themselves. It was certain from the beginning of Torch that relations between the two French movements would be frosty, and the tense altercations were only exacerbated after de Gaulle's death, as neither refused to acknowledge the authority or legitimacy of the other.\n\nDarlan, despite being named the official representative of the French people by an approving Roosevelt and a reluctant Churchill, was still not allowed to attend the military planning session, nor were any of his countrymen. Despite all this, the US President still expected from François Darlan and Pierre-Marie Kœnig to shake hands in front of the eager (and questioning) photographers, perhaps as a sign of French unity, perhaps for allowing them to fully attend the meeting had they come to an understanding. Of course, the distrust built up between the two would only result in a rather awkward scene where the two sucessfully shook hands after five attempts [12], after which they immediately went their separate ways without a word uttered.\n\nOf course, this was not the end of Allied woes when dealing with their newest accomplice, as his uptight, pompous and arrogant nature would put him at odds with men such as Dwight Eisenhower and Bernard Montgomery. Moreover, it seemed as though Darlan was unable to shake off his Vichy past, as he controversially maintained numerous concentration camps in the African territory under his control in which thousands of captured Free French officers, liberals, socialists and communists were tortured and killed – all this while the Allied press did not know any better, or at least pretended not to.\n\nOver the vast Atlantic, the Vichy French lobby in the United States, now fully backing François Darlan and hoping to exploit the positive attitudes of the US government toward the Admiral, began its attempts at suppresing anti-Vichy dissidents as well as negative portrayals of the Armistice French government of Philippe Pétain. Among the most notable examples of such behavior was the suppression of the Michael Curtiz romantic drama film Casablanca. Starring A-list American actors such as Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart and Paul Henreid and set in the eponymous city, the film focuses on an American expatriate who must choose between his love for a woman and helping her as well as her husband, a Czech resistance leader, escape from the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis. Unfortunately, the heavy pro-Free France bent of the motion picture's many plot points resulted in its suppression and alleged destruction of all its reels after Darlan caught wind of it. The film never got its world release that was scheduled for January 1943, and has since then been deemed a lost film of which only a few screencaps and scenes remain and highly sought after by many collectors and lost media hunters.\n\nThe Casablanca Conference did yield another important event that would shape the entire post-war world in a far greater manner – Franklin Delano Roosevelt's proclaimed doctrine of unconditional surrender. Citing General Grant from the American Civil War, the President of the USA stated in a radio address to the American people a few days after the Conference: We mean no harm to the common people of the Axis nations, but we do mean to impose punishment and retribution upon their guilty, barbaric leaders. Churchill (and later Darlan) agreed with the sentiments, mostly as a guarantee to Stalin that there would not be any separate peace treaties signed with the Axis by any of the Allies.\n\n​\n\nWith the Casablanca meeting over and the full Nazi German military occupation of Vichy France due to Case Anton, the pieces of the chessboard slowly but surely began to unravel. The North African campaign being almost secured, there is little else to mull over as the fortunes of war began to turn in the Allied favor. 1943 would become monumental in the history of the world, as the greatest war in human history, with the addition of the conniving Renart the Fox [13] and the egotistical general Monty Montgomery to the larger military and political stage, would slowly but surely set itself on a trajectory that would be unlike anything that had occurred before.\n\n​\n\nThey've been on the boat for far too many days by now, having lost count of the cold days and even frostier nights during their ordeal. His stomach heaved in agony, for it has not tasted solid food in at least a couple Sun cycles. He scratched it absentmindedly, in vain hopes of calming the growling beast from within him. Dew was ever-present on his stubble, one that adorned the grimace that had made itself a prominent feature on his once stoic, soldierly face. He wiped the water with his shaky right hand, lapping up the precious liquid like a man posessed.\n\nLooking on the man rowing the boat in front of him, he cursed him out quietly for what seemed like a hundredth time. Goran, as he liked to call himself, seemed like a creature from an otherworldly tale – exuding an utter calm that outrageously juxtaposed all the hardships that they had endured after almost a fortnight of coexistence. The younger soldier looked out into the distant seas, a man who deemed all his life's worries solved by that subtle smile that managed to irk him just enough. The simple motion would always produce the tiniest hint of rage within his core, for how could a man stuck in such a deadly predicament be able to emit such powerful peace all around him.\n\nPerhaps he had died underneath the rubble somewhere in Stalin's frozen city and these are just his last few neurons firing off a wishful final thought of peace and no more war inside his head, or at least he hopes that is the case.\n\nDamn him.\n\nHe knocks over the canteen by accident. It falls onto the wooden floor, an echo breaking out in the misty nothingness around them. Picking it up, he grunts aloud, not caring if Goran heard it. Just then, he notices his shadow's movement, an unsure dance that led to nowhere, but it was clear – the Sun had returned, and perhaps his weary bones would finally feel the warmth they were deprived from for months.\n\n„We should land over there.“\n\nHe begrudgingly had to agree. Looking over into the distance, the rocky coast was finally in sight, and an odd thing to behold it certainly was. There was no snow, as if it had never even fallen out of the somber skies back when they had embarked onto the boat not far from Rostov. The land seemed as though it came right out of a dream, with low bushes scattered with no rhyme or reason around the brown soil and small grey pebbles that were all over the place. Hope arose within his heart, or perhaps it was the supposedly incorrigible hunger aching within his soul, he did not know exactly.\n\n„It is as good a place as any.“\n\nThat smile again… He swore the day he had to survive the rubble of Stalingrad under his breath. Turning his gaze away from the ever-present pestering annoyance over to the bushes, his tired eyes began receiving shades of yellow and gold dancing their way into his consciousness. The glint in his two orbs was more than obvious, their gleam almost stronger than that of the Sun, fighting its battles with the clouds above the two escapees. He lowers his hands into the painfully cold sea in an attempt to quicken Goran's rowing to get to the golden coast, whenever they may be.\n\nThe snowy blankets that Rostov was entirely hidden under did not exist here, it seemed. A whole new world appeared in front of him, or so he had hoped, as the little Crimean beach's dreamy landscape and the mountains in the far-off distance settled down in the shakiness of his pupils.\n\nThey finally landed. He praised the God above as his feet finally felt the steady ground beneath him, a gust of chilly wind perforating his pale skin and almost making him stumble over, either from weakness or from surprise. Goran ties the ship with the rope they found on their escape vehicle on the outskirts of Stalingrad – a German military jeep that would, under no normal circumstances, be allowed to enter the roads, for it lacked the backseats, one rearview mirror, the hubcaps on each of its tires, the replacement tire in the front, even, and on each of its front lights the glass coverings were completely torn to shreds and the front seats were filled with empty bullet casings covered in blood. It was a miracle the thing's engine was even able to start.\n\nThe gas tank had enough in it to lead them to Rostov, where they had to steal one of the wooden boats that looked as if it came right out of a Carl Blechen drawing. With whatever supplies they had scavenged on their way from Stalingrad to Rostov, they took off. The journey between the embarkation and the disembarkation of the two deserters was rather uneventful, a mix of laconic phrases and lowly grumbles from the Generalfeldmarschall. Goran knew not to push his luck by attempting to speak with his superior, who did not even ask nor show any desire to have survived the slaughterhouse of Stalingrad. On the contrary, it seemed as though the German's soul had died somewhere in the rubble hundreds of miles from where they were now.\n\nNot even cracking a smile, the soldier stuck out like a sore thumb in the greys and whites of the fog, the snow and the white clouds in the discolored skies, a black hole that threatened to suck out the last bits of hope that had hidden themselves within his heart when his comrades around him fell in rapid succession, either from patriotic Russians or from Germans who were suspicious of a band of deserters abandoning the snowy graveyards, and him being the only man who survived, all the while carrying the unconscious body of the most important Axis man in the East.\n\nNow, though, Goran could enjoy the solemn silence in this little piece of heaven that they had finally found after days without food and warm shelter. Even though the chill was close to unbearable, he did not allow this mere challenge to defeat his resolve, as he attempts to soldier through this ordeal as best as he can. He notices the General stumbling over to an evergreen bush before wrapping the sleeves of his Wehrmacht coat around his hands and picking the tiny red splotches that adorned the bush's exterior. The younger man smiles, completely lost in the serenity of the area and the calm that settled down among them.\n\nLater that night, they had managed to build a small campfire from some tree branches and leaves they managed to dry up by wrapping them in their undershirts and thereupon pressing them. By using his old lighter, Goran created the fire that would nigh literally save their skins, as they again felt what real warmth was like all those months ago. Rubbing their shoulders in rapid succession, the two men took notice of the steam releasing from their mouths as breaths got released manically.\n\n„We embark first thing in the morning.“\n\n„Aye, Generalfeldmarschall.“\n\nThe old man nods in affirmation, his sight fixated upon the dancing fire and the smoke that had risen above both soldiers. The cracking of the minuscule tree branches permeates his eardrums, leaving nothing else there to provide him comfort. Although, the German had to admit – this was a moment of serenity that they are extremely unlikely to experience once more in the coming days, and they would have to cherish it as best as they can. It is then that he notices Goran fishing out a small book and a pencil from his small traveling bag.\n\nIt is a dirty old thing, barely larger than the palm of the Slav's hand, yet he opens it with such finesse and care that makes one think he is cradling a little child. He begins scribbling down whatever it was he had on his mind, and the movement of his right hand is so delicate that he got a feeling the book was made of glass, whose fragility would make itself known at the first possible rougher motion.\n\nPerhaps he might inquire the man about the contents of the small notebook, as it was not the first time he had seen him in the silent process. For now, he declared he would enjoy the somewhat companionable silence that had bled into the scene and successfully drowned out his asocial discomfort and weariness.\n\nPerhaps…\n\n*****\n\n​\n\nA Hopeful Retreat cover – 1879 painting done by Russian landscape painter Ivan Shishkin (called Mountain Path, Crimea)\n\n[1] Captain and assistant to lieutenant-colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey in the 13th Demi-Brigade of Foreign Legion of the French Foreign Legion. Returned to France after the beginning of hostilities in 1939. After having participated in the Norwegian campaign, he evaded capture in France by escaping to England from Brittany.\n\n[2] Counter-admiral of the Vichy French navy and the State Secretary of the Navy from April to November 1942. IOTL Auphan was one of the main instigators of the scuttling of the French navy in Toulon after Darlan's capture in Algiers on the eve of Torch. ITTL, with Darlan waiting in Toulon, Auphan directly obeys his superior's orders and manages to save many of the ships from the Germans.\n\n[3] Participated as Ensign in the Chinese campaign after the beginning of the Boxer Rebellion and was one of the pioneers of French naval aviation in the interwar period. Promoted to the rank of Admiral in 1938.\n\n[4] Vice-Admiral of the Vichy French navy, Maritime Prefect of the City of Toulon. IOTL he worked with Auphan and Laborde to scuttle the fleet before the Nazis could take it over, but ITTL he obeys Darlan's orders to guard the city against the Germans while Auphan and others help prepare the ships.\n\n[5] Laborde and Darlan maintained an intense rivalry IOTL which Philippe Pétain attempted to manipulate to retain control of the French navy. This led to Laborde's enraged order for the navy to resist the Allies completely after Darlan's defection to the West IOTL, which almost nobody on the ground-level obeyed. ITTL this leads to Laborde resisting Darlan in Toulon, which almost jeopardizes the entire venture, though Pétain's former second-in-command was more than fortunate in the clash.\n\n[6] Gott's nickname is a play on words regarding the Imperial German World War I slogan „Gott strafe England“ (God Punish England). With irony not winning its major laugh ITTL like it had in our own when Gott died in a strafing run by the Germans, he gets to live and become an important British ambassador in Egypt.\n\n[7] Before succeeding Gott as commander of the British Eighth Army, Monty was actually intended to succeed Harold Alexander as commander of the British First Army, i.e. the troops that would successfully land in North Africa during Torch.\n\n[8] The nickname is referencing de Gaulle's large nose and impressive height (197 centimeters), the two traits he shares with French 17th century libertine novelist Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\n[9] IOTL Kœnig actually did distinguish himself for winning against Rommel at Bir Hakeim, and he attains a similar kind of victory that impresses both the Allies and especially de Gaulle, which would only strengthen Kœnig's image as a would-be successor to Charles de Gaulle.\n\n[10] Timing is certainly not on the Free French side, as they only took control of the island on November 5, 1942, mere three days before Torch and Darlan's arrival, and much like OTL, only a tiny minority of the captured Vichy French troops declare for de Gaulle's troops.\n\n[11] OTL Prime Minister of Egypt from 1944 until his assassination in 1945. His opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood resulted in his premature death IOTL, but in this story he does not get assassinated, and his major crackdowns on the Muslim Brotherhood (main perpetrators of the attack on him IOTL) would change Egypt's trajectory in this story, but more on that in the far-off future.\n\n[12] IOTL the relations between Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud were so tense that the two could not stand each other, with their handshake being so quick that the photographers did not get the chance to take the photos on the first try. ITTL Darlan and Kœnig are quietly seething at each other, and the morbidly comical scene is only more exaggerated than it was IOTL.\n\n[13] Recurring character from medieval allegorical Dutch, English, French and German fables, oft-portrayed as the archetypal deceitful trickster. Quite an apt description of Darlan's reputation after his flip to the Allies, de Gaulle's suspicious death, maintenance of concentration camps in his territories, dirty political trickery on Madagascar and dictatorial attitude toward nation-rebuilding."
