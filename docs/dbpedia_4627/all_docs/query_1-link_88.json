From now on, they have to sew small packets of coke into jeans and deal not only with each other but also with the crazy leader on the surface. Balkan Brothers is incredibly multifaceted. Firstly, the film demonstrates that regardless of one's origins, everyone is equal and must unite. However, this drama is replete with very dark humor, considerable brutality, and doesn't even shy away from depicting rape. Does the film offer a happy ending, or does it present us with the stark truth?"
