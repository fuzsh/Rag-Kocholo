        "text": "In Ivanjica, the other day, after the match between Javor and Partizan, a man approached me and said his name Aleksandar Milivojevic. I know both the name and the character, but in that state after the game, I can't place him, so he helps me. He tells me he is a friend Boža Koprivica i Duško Vujošević. He tells me that he hears from Božova often, almost daily, and asks me if I have seen Božova's latest book, which he shares authorship with Miodrag Raičević. And he says that the book was presented the other day in Vrbas. The book was published by the Karioke house from Belgrade. I am, Aleksandar, since a few days ago I have that book with the title \"Blues of two friends\" written by the hands of two friends. Dual with us sometimes has the genitive equal to the nominative. And I saw that Đorđije K. was written next to the label \"For the publisher\".\n\nWe parted ways there, he had to go to Užice Požega, and I went to Grab via Jankova kamen. And here I am writing down perhaps what I would have said about the book to Ac Milivojević, if we hadn't parted as soon as we met.\n\n\"Blues of two friends\" goes into the literary genre Prosimeter. This species is rare in our country, it would not be surprising if some would claim that it is not a species at all. (By the way, we are beyond the whole world, we also have what the world does not have: both literary species and literary genera. Listen to the genera! I am surprised that literary brotherhoods and tribes, literary taxa, zaovs and pastures were not introduced along with the genera.)\n\n\"Blues of two friends\" is also titled \"in 54 weeks\", that is, there are chapters, but there are 55 chapters, as well as weeks. The chapters were published on Mondays in the newspaper Danas, on Saturdays they were picked up by Vijesti from Podgorica, and then they were made into a book. The prose parts of all chapters are younger than the poetic parts. The poems in the book are some old, some recent, some of them, eight of them, were taken from unpublished manuscripts at the time, but they are all older than Koprivica's text. There are many verses in \"Blues of two friends\", by many poets, and all of them, except Raičević's (and one poem Danila Kiša) composed one after the other, separated by a slash, and Raičević's are always at the end, as a rule of the whole poem, verses one below the other, in a grid, composed with italics.\n\nBož Koprivica's writings are inspired, often dramatic and tragically intoned memories of the people who determined his life. These texts are detailed, sometimes fragmentary testimonies about their own anxieties, about the deaths and suicides of their nearest and dearest, about the deaths of great football players, great poets or actors. One of those testimonies, said Aleksandar Milojević in that emergency, was told by Koprivica before he wrote it, at a literary evening in Užice Požega, in 2018. The audience was all speechless, while the guest in his inimitable way presented the catalog of suicides. in his family.\n\nThe texts about the players of the Hungarian national team from the fifties show Kopriviča's deep and authoritative knowledge of the Hungarian game and culture. His suffering after the Hungarian defeat is lifelong and irreversible, like the relentlessness of the flat desert. The chapter on the left wing by name Zoltán Czibor from Kapošvar was copied from life, and life is the stomach, that is defeat. It begins with the performance of the Kaposvar Theater \"Marat/Sade\" János Acs on Bitef, and through Danilo Kish you get to Czibor, born in Kapošvar. The text about Czibor, the last name in the composition of the Hungarian gold and silver team, is a sigh and a tear. Koprivica, that cry for the Hungarian defeat when he was five years old, cries constantly, even today when he is over seventy. Czibor played a long time ago, when the posts and crossbars were square, and Koprivica still looks at him today and trembles and dreams of entering the game, of replacing Puskas (and gets shirt number 10), and yes Péter Esterházy replace Christmas. Through the correspondence of Czibor and Margaret Atwood, and the desire to see the mythical Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, you get to the point. And the point is the song \"Round Midnight\" by Mijo Raičević.\n\nEach poem by Raičević makes the point of each of the 55 chapters of this book. The stylistic novelty of this book is in the process of making the whole poem the point. While Božo Koprivica writes his texts, Mijo Raičević is either in a hospital or in a sanatorium or in an institution for the infirm. The prosimeter of this book are the texts of an author who walks and while walking remembers, recalls and restores and one who fell in his apartment in Karaburma, \"an apartment with five thousand books and ten thousand discs of all kinds of music\". After the fall, Mijo Raičević stopped walking. The hospital, neurology, neurosurgery, convalescents, along with many others, the soul moved to Raičević Boethius, so he is now composing his \"Consolatio poesiae\" in his dungeon and he made his poems and those before available to Koprivica, in whom the souls of ancient players, poets and actors settled.\n\nThe blues of Raičević and Koprivica is not a collection of comments that resemble those of the lyrics of Ithaca, neither is \"Vita nova\". It is a memory of Koprivica, where every memory ends with a song. Raičević's poems are presented in this book in a new way, taken from collections that few people have heard of. Mijo Raičević is not unknown in poetry circles, but his poetry is unknown. This unusual anthology of his 55 poems selected by his friends reveals him as a poet who was an undeserved stepchild of both the Yugoslav and post-Yugoslav literary scene. His books were mostly published by so-called small publishers, so even though he won some literary awards, Raičević remained on the edge, which divides the literary meadow with a thousand flowers and the abyss at its border. And if he lived in America, and if he had written these songs in English, his books would have been accepted as exhibits at the Beat Museum in San Francisco.\n\nKoprivica built a unique style, sublime with elements of awe: \"Oh, power of my dreams, show yourself now.\" When you take your last breath, that word will be on your palate. I have flare-ups of schizophrenia from this heat. It's not an alibi for this rhyme, a love rhyme and a song by Mijo Raičević, because MR also knows how to return the ideal double pass to my bone: 'Round Midnight Again'\" (p. 66). The writer should be comprehensible, but the reader must also be equipped to understand: a basket is a poorly passed ball.\n\nThis blues in four hands is full of wonderful characters and wonderful scenes. Garrincha, Tostão, Pelé, Zico (amazingly, only mentioned once!). George Best, Bobek, p Milan Galic (mentioned 34 times), Eduard Strelcov, Brodski, Matvejević, Biljana Jovanović, p Dragan Lubarda, Dragiša Ajdić (poured shower on Lubarda's drawing). Well, Danilo Kiš, this is another book in which God's spirit of loyalty to Danilo floats. And loyalty to Sarajevo, Mirza Delibašić, Davorin Popović, Izet Sarajlić. And a nice memory of our fellow poet Milos Komadin few will not let a tear run down their cheek. On page 70, there is a scene when the great writer Mihailo Lalic, tells Koprivica that his father, Bož, is a partisan George I defended the Ulcinj post office in 1941. And that and that and all that.\n\nThe dribbles and tremors of Božo Koprivica gave this book an insurmountable contribution to the deep solidarity in the suffering of the poet Mijo Raičević. And recognition of his verses. Raičević's poems lend gentleness and patience to that solidarity. For those who don't have the book yet, here's the first poem from the first chapter, titled \"You Were First in the Spring Championship\":\n\nYou were first in the spring championship\n\nyou were first in the spring championship, dear\n\nand the goal difference was on your side\n\nevery attack of the opposing players ended\n\nin front of the small penalty area, but today\n\nthe ball is not as round as it used to be, you whistle\n\neven those who would not be able to perform either\n\nkickoff. I See You:\n\nyou are sitting on the veranda\n\nlegs wrapped in a blanket.\n\nThe wind sways the football boots\n\nhung on a peg. The corner flag is full of tears.\n\n(portalnovosti.com)"
