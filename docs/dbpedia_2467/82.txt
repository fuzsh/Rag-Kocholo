A man wanted by authorities for murder since November, 1984 is now back in custody in Whitfield County.

Conasauga Judicial District Attorney Bert Poston says Jay Thomas Burlison was indicted in 1984 for the murder on November 12th of that year of Ernest Griffin, and for aggravated assault against his wife, Mary Burlison, and Ron Lee Harris.

Poston says authorities arrested Burlison on Monday in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.

Burlison was arrested on a Governorâ€™s warrant and waived extradition and was brought back to Dalton Monday night and booked into the Whitfield County Jail.

Chief Investigator Glenn Swinney was the Whitfield County Detective who worked the case originally in 1984, and was the one who made the arrest on Monday.

Poston says Swinney had been looking for Burlison ever since, and recently got a break in the case when Burlison or someone on his behalf filed for social security benefits.

Burlison is currently 75 years old. He was arrested at 20 Byrd Road, Lawrenceburg, TN where he was residing with a half-brother.
