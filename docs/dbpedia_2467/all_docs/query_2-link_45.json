        "text": "Nominations for the State Award for Outstanding Contributions Are Now Open.\n\nThe American Association of Nurse Practitioners® (AANP) empowers all nurse practitioners (NPs) to advance accessible, person-centered, equitable, high-quality health care for diverse communities through practice, education, advocacy, research and leadership (PEARL). The AANP State Award for Outstanding Contributions recognizes individuals who have demonstrated excellence that supports the NP role in the areas of PEARL.\n\nMake a Nomination\n\nHistory\n\nFounded in 1991, the State Awards for Excellence was established to recognize the extraordinary contributions of NPs. This annual recognition has honored deserving recipients who demonstrated excellence in clinical practice and have advanced the image, profile and visibility of NPs. In 1993, AANP created the Advocate State Award for Excellence to honor those who led efforts to advance legislation that has positively impacted NP practice and increased awareness and recognition of NPs.\n\nIn 2024, the AANP Awards program was once again reimagined and renamed the AANP State Awards for Outstanding Contributions. This is an annual award given to one deserving individual per state based on outlined criterion.\n\nWho May Nominate?\n\nCurrent individual AANP members.\n\nSelf-nominations will be accepted.\n\nNomination Process:\n\nThe open call for nominations takes place annually at the close of the AANP national conference.\n\nNominations are submitted online through the AANP website.\n\nConsideration will only be given to nominations complete with all required information that was submitted by the published deadline.\n\nNominations received after the deadline date will not be accepted.\n\nEligibility Criteria*\n\nNominations may be submitted for an AANP member or non-member who demonstrates excellence in alignment with the mission and goals of AANP in the areas of practice, education, advocacy, research or leadership (PEARL).\n\nThe nominee has shown efforts to advance the image, profile and visibility of NPs at the state level in four or more of the following areas:\n\nServes as a role model for professionalism and ethical approach in the health care setting and in community service.\n\nDemonstrates a positive impact on health care delivery by fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nSucceeds in building strategic partnerships, coalitions or alliances that have contributed to improved health care outcomes for individuals, families or communities.\n\nSupports education by presenting at conferences, publishing and/or precepting students.\n\nEngages in advocacy as a leader in policy issues in the legislative or regulatory arena that affect the NP role.\n\nUtilizes or generates evidence-based research to enhance the quality-of-care NPs provide to patients, families or communities.\n\nHas taken part in research that has influenced health care outcomes.\n\nMentors NPs and other stakeholders in health policy, practice or education.\n\n*Previous State Award recipients are eligible for nomination after five years have lapsed from receiving an award.\n\nWho is Ineligible?\n\nNominations that include groups and organizations cannot be submitted.\n\nAANP elected leaders and staff (e.g. Board of Directors, Fellows Executive Committee, State Liaisons, Nomination Council and Awards Committee) cannot be nominated for the award.\n\nSelection Committee\n\nEach region will have a selection committee composed of the Region Director, three State Liaisons and an Awards Committee member. Each year, a call for State Liaison volunteers will be sent via the State Liaison listserv. Each selection committee will review and rank the submitted nominations of another region. If an eligible nominee is not identified, an award will not be given in that state for the award cycle. The Awards Committee will assign applications for review to the selection committees.\n\nAward Package\n\nRecipients will:\n\nBe honored during the AANP State Awards for Outstanding Contributions Ceremony at the respective AANP national conference.\n\nReceive a waiver of the national conference registration fee (workshops and additional fees not included).\n\nReceive a professional photo with the AANP President.\n\nReceive an award ribbon given at the beginning of conference.\n\nNotification\n\nAward recipients will be notified in early December of each award cycle.\n\nQuestions\n\nFor questions, contact governance@aanp.org."
