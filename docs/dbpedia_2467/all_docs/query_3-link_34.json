This is a call for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls.\n\nThe Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library (SNFL) and The Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV) have teamed up to stand against domestic violence. Once a month at SNFL a representative from the Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence will be available to answer questions about their services. ENDGBV operates the New York City Family Justice Centers, service centers which provide vital social services, civil legal and criminal justice assistance, and moreâ€”all under one roof. Learn more at www.nyc.gov/ENDGBV, or stop by our next Meet and Greet at SNFL.\n\nIn honor of 16 Days of Activism we have compiled a list of 16 books that explore some of the many topics surrounding domestic violence. For more recommendations, please drop by your local library."
