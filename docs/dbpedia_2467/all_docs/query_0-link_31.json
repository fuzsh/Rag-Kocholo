They appear in the 1900 Lewis County census. He is shown as being 27 and she is 19. There is a child who is 7. Thus it would appear TJ Burns may have been married previously. I’m trying to determine the maiden name of Lizzie Burns. I believe this indivdual to be my great aunt, Sarah Lizzie Bell, but have no documentation to prove that connection. Sarah Lizzie Bell was licensed to marry a Dossey Burlison in 1898. However, that marriage apparently did not take place, since she was (by family story) forbidden to marry Mr. Burlison by her father, William Joseph Bell, and brother, James Minor Bell. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTom Reed — 7 Duke Street, New Freedom, PA 17349\n\ntreed@blazenet.net\n\nSubmitted on Thu Jun 22 06:48:01 MDT 2000\n\nBECUM/BECKUM – RAY – WOODY – BAILEY – ROBERTSON/ROBINSON – GIBSON – SIMS – BALL Mary RAY, b @ 1784 in Orange Co, NC, was the daughter of David RAY who died in Orange Co, NC in 1808.
