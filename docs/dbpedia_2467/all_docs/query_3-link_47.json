        "text": "Remembering Those that have Passed . . .\n\n​\n\n2024\n\nLeonard Riggio. Barnes & Noble and GameStop founder Leonard Riggio passed away on Tuesday after a battle with Alzheimer’s disease, the family announced. The retail pioneer was 83.\n\nRiggio built Barnes & Noble up over half a century, opening his first college bookstore in Greenwich Village in 1965 and acquiring rival Manhattan store Barnes & Noble in 1971. B&N bought B. Dalton Bookseller, a mall chain, in 1987, and began a strategy of opening superstores, which included cafes and large newsstand offerings. The growth of the chain was accompanied by a decline in the number of independent bookstores, who found it difficult to compete with B&N’s size and selection.\n\nB&N continued to expand until the store count peaked at 726 for the fiscal year ended January 2009. But Amazon’s emergence on the retail scene in 1995 and the growth of digital content took their toll, leading to a challenging sales environment through the teens. But it was during that period that Barnes & Noble expanded its selection of manga, graphic novels, and hobby games, dramatically impacting sales in those categories.\n\nRiggio was a pioneer of retailing beyond Barnes & Noble. He also founded Barnes & Noble College Bookstores, a contract operator of college stores across the U.S., Software, Etc., and in 1999, GameStop, which grew to over 7000 stores worldwide.\n\nThrough the teens, Riggio was in and out as Barnes & Noble CEO multiple times in a period when the company had at least five CEOs. He came back one last time to oversee the sale of the chain to Waterstones parent Elliott Management Corporation in 2019 ensuring that the company would be run by a bookseller.\n\nAtsuko Tanaka, game and anime voice actor, dies at age 61. Per her son Hikaru, she died of an undisclosed illness she'd been battling for the past year. \"Including her year-long battle with illness, I think she lived a life that was typical of Tanaka,\" he wrote in a translated obituary. \"Serious, dignified, and a little playful. I am truly happy to have such a proud mother.\"\n\nBorn November 14, 1962, Tanaka was best known for voicing Motoko Kusanagi in the Ghost in the Shell franchise. Much of her voicework career was in anime including Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Lupin III, and Queen's Blade.\n\nGame-wise, she did the Japanese voice for Bayonetta in PlatinumGames' titular series. She's also been in franchises like Nier (as Kaine), Yakuza (Reina), and Devil May Cry (Trish), and was Lara Croft's Japanese voice for several Tomb Raider titles.\n\nSeveral franchises Tanaka was attached to wrote eulogies of their own following her passing. Ghost in the Shell's Twitter said she imbued Kusanagi \"with a presence that is both quiet and powerful and full of charm.\"\n\n\"I had a great time playing the role of Kaine in Nier Replicant,\" reads Nier's Twitter account. \"We sincerely pray for the repose of your soul.\"\n\nFinally, from the recent anime Frieren: \"We would like to once again express our gratitude for your appearance in Funeral Parlor Frieren and your performance, and we offer our heartfelt condolences.\"\n\nRachael Lillis. Pokémon voice actress Rachael Lillis, who starred in Pokémon TV series, films and video games dating back as far as the late 1990s, has died from breast cancer at the age of 55.\n\nLillis voiced the main characters of Misty and Jessie and many more on the beloved Japanese animated series.\n\nHer death was announced by Veronica Taylor, who co-stars as Pokémon lead character Ash Ketchum.\n\nMs Taylor wrote: \"Rachael was an extraordinary talent, a bright light that shone through her voice whether speaking or singing.\"\n\n\"We all know Rachael Lillis from the many wonderful roles she played,\" Ms Taylor wrote on social media on Monday.\n\n\"She filled our Saturday mornings and before/after school hours with her beautiful voice, her terrific comic timing, and her remarkable acting skills.\"\n\nShe said Lillis was grateful for the support she received as she battled cancer.\n\n\"It truly made a positive difference,\" Ms Taylor said.\n\n(from Jill Chang) - Tony Miller - former Mattelite, passed away after suffering a stroke at the end of June, just shy of his 84th birthday. For those that didn't know him, Tony worked at Mattel from 1968-1974 as a Project Engineer and Product Manager, then again from 1999-2003 as Vice President of Design for Hot Wheels. During the years he was not at Mattel, he stayed employed in the toy industry as either an employee, executive, or freelance designer/inventor. Throughout his life, he was passionate about design, cars and toys, so his final gig at Mattel was the perfect fit. For anyone who was on Tony's team in 2003, I've attached a photo and bit of nostalgia that he's had hanging in his office for the last 20 years.\n\nAfter parting ways with Mattel in 2003, Tony maintained his passion for all things automotive by being active in the design and creation of a wild custom 1940 Ford coupe, the reworking and additional customization of his shoebox 1951 Ford Victoria, being a docent at the Petersen Automotive Museum for a decade, actively participating on the H.A.M.B., a hot rod message board at jalopyjournal.com as @50Fraud, and of course, attending a slew of car shows. Maybe you even bumped into him at one or two! The ’40 Ford is being donated to the Petersen in Tony’s honor and will remain a part of their permanent collection. We hope you’ll join us in remembering him.\n\nMemorial Cruise-in Car Show\n\nPetersen Automotive Museum\n\nSaturday, August 17, 2024, 8:00 - 11:00\n\n​\n\nSusan Wojcicki, the former YouTube CEO and one of the first Google employees, has died at the age of 56 after two years of living with cancer. Her husband, Dennis Troper, announced the news of her death on Friday. In a post on Facebook he said: “It is with profound sadness that I share the news of Susan Wojcicki passing. My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after two years of living with non-small cell lung cancer.” Wojcicki, one of the most prominent women in tech, stepped down from her role at YouTube in 2023, a position she held for nine years, saying she wanted to “start a new chapter focused on my family, health and personal projects I’m passionate about”.\n\nBeth Schlansky, licensing and retail veteran, a pioneering figure in the licensing industry, passed away peacefully on July 29, 2024, at Columbia Presbyterian Hospice in New York City due to complications from cancer. She was 70 years old.\n\nSchlansky began her career in Macy’s Executive Training Program, where she honed her skills in the buying office and learned the store line. In 1979, she joined the corporate office of British American Tobacco U.S. (BATUS), where she sourced home goods for major retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field’s, Gimbels, and Kohl’s. Her role involved extensive international travel, particularly in Europe and Asia.\n\nIn 1986, Schlansky was recruited by Spencer Gifts, where she recognized the growing potential of licensing. She became one of the nation’s first Vice Presidents of Licensing for a retailer and was an early adopter of Direct to Retailer licensing contracts. Her innovative approach led to numerous successful licensing ventures.\n\nSchlansky also contributed significantly to Licensing International (formerly LIMA), the leading trade association for the global brand licensing industry. She served on its Board of Directors, was a LIMA Retail Officer, and became the first Charity Chairperson, where she helped inaugurate the Licensing Industry’s Charity focus, The Hole in The Wall Gang Camp, founded by Paul Newman.\n\nIn 2006, she founded her own company, Beth Schlansky, Inc., offering licensing and consulting services to licensors, manufacturers, and retailers. Her expertise facilitated numerous successful licensing deals across various industries.\n\nSchlansky is survived by her husband, George Velasco. She was predeceased by her parents, Morris and Lilian, and her beloved dog, Anna.\n\nRob Ramash - Tribute from Kim Carter: Today we are saddened to learn that our friend, and former business associate, Rob Romash died suddenly on June 9th. Rob was a larger than life talented individual.\n\nRob had a passion for flying toys as a kid and he extended this into his business career, building his business, Eclipse toys on the numerous flying toys he designed.\n\nA native of New Jersey, Rob started out in toys with Larami, moved on to Tyco / Mattel (where he worked on Matchbox) and subsequently joined Estes Rockets before setting up Eclipse toys.\n\nBeyond toys Rob was well known in model flying circles, was a talented artist, crafted wooden furniture and even designed his wife Nida’s wedding ring.\n\nEugene “Gene” Hendel passed away on June 30, 2024. Gene was a man who was anything but ordinary, and it makes no sense to write a generic obituary for a legend such as him. He’s probably shaking his head right now, saying, “I asked for simple!”\n\nGene spent 50 years in the toy industry, working with giants like Kenner, Mattel, Hasbro, and Tiger Electronics. His family was so proud when he decided to launch his own company, Gene Hendel Associates, as a manufacturer’s rep. It was a huge leap of faith with a wife, two kids, and a dog to care for, but given his stellar reputation and work ethic, he thrived and became more successful than ever.\n\nJoshua \"Rod, Rodimus, Josh\" Carter passed away on June 11, 2024, in Savannah, Georgia, at the age of 40. Born on February 29, 1984, in Charleston, South Carolina, Joshua was a cherished member of the community and a vibrant presence in the lives of those who knew him.\n\nJoshua was the beloved owner of Rodimus Toys, a haven for collectors of vintage toys and action figures, which mirrored his personal passion. From his early childhood, Joshua was captivated by the world of action figures, a love that he carried and cultivated into adulthood. His business was not just a career but a reflection of his personal joy and enthusiasm for collectibles.\n\nChris Wiggs, the inventor of Polly Pocket, died peacefully on June 20 at his home in France surrounded by love and family, The Post can exclusively reveal. He was 74. Wiggs had been recently diagnosed with a rare form of neurological cancer.\n\nThe East London native dreamed up the portable dreamhouse in 1983, while in New York on business.\n\nClive Wooster. Toy World is very sad to report that Clive Wooster passed away unexpectedly at home on Saturday, 18th May, with his beloved wife Heather by his side. Friend and colleague, Nikki Jeffery, shared that Clive Ralph Wooster, who passed away at the age of 69, dedicated his entire career to the toy industry, beginning at Fisher Price where he spent several years honing his skills – and sales patter. His career saw him taking on various influential roles in sales. In the 90s, Clive ran The First Years until RC2/Learning Curve acquired it in 2004, when he became managing director. He continued to lead during periods of significant change and oversaw the European transition into Tomy when it acquired RC2 in 2011. Clive later chose to join smaller, close-knit companies, enjoying many fulfilling years as a country manager for Famosa and more recently, working with Geomagworld. In January this year, he decided to step back to spend more time with his family and further pursue his passion for motor racing. Well-known within the industry for his kindness, humour and endless stories, Clive’s presence ensured that any room was filled with laughter and conversation. He was approachable and always willing to help. Clive inspired many through his mentorship and formed strong relationships with colleagues across the companies he worked for over the years. Many from his First Years and RC2 days remained close friends and will miss him dearly.\n\nSalvatore Anthony Mucaro of Fernandina Beach FL passed away peacefully on May 16, 2024, leaving behind a legacy of love, strength, and cherished memories.

He has several toy design patents and designed several successful toys in his long career as a package designer and toy designer.\n\nShelly Morick - former Mattel sales executive. December 21st, 1937 - May 7th, 2024.\n\n​\n\nJane Garner - Toy World is sad to report that licensing PR guru, Jane Garner of Kilogram Media, has passed away after a short illness.\n\nJane spent her career in the PR side of the licensing community. She initially ran the PR department at Copyright Promotions (now CPLG) before setting up her own agency, Kilogram Media, which specialised in supporting licensors and licensing agents from both the UK and international market. Throughout her career, Jane was ever-present at licensing shows and events across the globe, and numerous people from the licensing community will have spent many an enjoyable evening in her company...\n\nRob Auerbach - Tribute from CandyRific: \"It is with heavy hearts we write you that Rob Auerbach, Owner and CEO of CandyRific, passed away the morning of May 7, 2024. An industry icon, Rob was a toy and novelty candy creator for more than 40 years with many historic items reaching the market. He founded CandyRific in 2000 with partners, Michael and Paul Roberts, steering it to be the global industry leader it is today. A leader of licensing and branding in the candy industry, Rob’s passion was bringing great licenses and brands to products, making them amazing and enjoyable for everyone.\n\nRob founded Rainbow Blossom Natural Food Markets in 1977. Those who knew him knew of his love for thoroughbred racing and he attended the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, May 4. Above all things, Rob loved his family. He was the most positive person you could ever meet. Rob was a gifted storyteller with a great sense of humor, and he made everyone feel happier just being around him.\n\nOur hearts go out to his wife, Pumpkin, daughters, Summer and Star, and all who loved him. He will be missed by all of us at CandyRific and Hilco Sweets, and we are grateful to have called him a friend.\n\nWalter Frederick Morrison, the inventor of the plastic flying discs that eventually became known as the Frisbee, died at his Utah home on Tuesday. He was 90 and is survived by three children. For decades, Morrison's creation has been an integral part of American life. Sure, there have been other flying toys, like the Aerobie or the Flip N Flyer, but even these seem less like competitors and more like slightly-modified versions of the original toy, sort of like weird second cousins. Frisbees, whose sales have passed 200 million units, are as American as baseball, apple pie, or fireworks on the Fourth of July.\n\n​\n\nRichard Keats, founder of Kaywood Industries, died on April 7 at the age of 97, leaving behind a legacy of toy innovation. Keats was a U.S. Navy Veteran as well as a graduate of Brown University. Following his degree, Keats joined his father’s company — Buddy L Toys — in 1948. After his father’s retirement in 1976, Keats took over and ran the company until it was sold to SLM in 1990. This wasn’t the end of Keats’ toy industry career. With experience from his time at Buddy L, he founded Kaywood Industries and continued to design and invent new toys. The company went on to license products to industry leaders including Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro, and Spin Master. Products that saw success with Kaywood Industries include Brush Your Teeth Barney, Playtime Big Bird, Flatsy, MakeUp Mindy, and more. Keats attended Toy Fair and the Dallas Fall Toy Preview trade shows yearly until 2019, demonstrating his deep investment in the world of toys.

The family has been overwhelmed by the positive response of love, stories and best wishes that we’ve had. A response like that is a great comfort for the family. We knew her and loved her, but it’s nice to know the customers did too, and the response has just re-enforced what we knew about her, and that so many people felt the same.”\n\n​\n\nGleda M. Estes: A Pioneer in Model Rocketry and its Educational Opportunities. It is with heavy hearts that we bid farewell to Gleda M. Estes, an icon in the field of rocketry and a champion for education throughout her life and career. Gleda passed away peacefully on March 30, 2024 at the age of 92, leaving behind a legacy that will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nGleda Kane was born on March 4, 1932 to Lester and Anna Belle Kane in a farming community near Clarinda, Iowa. As the youngest of eight siblings, Gleda attended grade school at a nearby one-room schoolhouse and later moved to Clarinda, Iowa in 1946 to attend high school. During her high school years, she lived with the William C. Hemphill family, doing housekeeping, cooking and childcare for her room and board.\n\nWith plans to prepare herself for a career in nursing, she worked part time at the local hospital during her senior year in high school. Then, in the fall of 1950, she began her freshman year at Central College in McPherson, Kansas. It was in chemistry class at Central that Gleda met her husband, Vernon Estes. Gleda and Vern were married on May 16, 1951. They lived their early lives together in the Denver area where their three daughters Betty, Sharon and Linda were born. Together, they embarked on a remarkable journey, pioneering an innovative family business and ultimately shaping the landscape of model rocketry with the formation of Estes Industries, Inc. in 1958.\n\nAs a co-founder of Estes Industries, Gleda was Vern’s primary support and partner in their new business venture into the space-age hobby of model rocketry. A modest mail order company in its infancy, Estes quickly grew along with the budding US Space Program in igniting the imagination of our country and contributing to technological advances needed to grow the hobby of rocketry. Her keen administrative skills and dedication complemented Vern’s technical ingenuity in the development of safe and affordable model rocket engines and model designs, making rocketry accessible to enthusiasts of all ages. Gleda’s contributions helped lay the foundation for the modern rocketry movement, inspiring countless individuals to reach for the stars.\n\nIt was Gleda who did much of the work as they got their small rocket company off the ground. She rolled body tubes, typeset and printed instructions, stitched the first Estes catalogs on her sewing machine, handled the bookkeeping, packed rocket kits, and processed and shipped orders.\n\nFollowing the 1961 move to Penrose, Gleda managed the largest division at Estes Industries. It was her department that ensured kits were produced and shipped on time. She managed the mass mailings of catalogs, Model Rocket News, and other publications. It was her job to oversee the opening of the mail, and make sure each order was shipped out in the afternoon mail. Everyone at Estes knew that when it came to serving the everyday needs of customers, Gleda was the Boss. As Estes grew, so did Gleda’s division of the company. When Estes Industries was sold to the Damon Corporation in 1969, she was managing more than 150 employees.

Yet, it was his infectious smile, quick wit, and overall warm nature that won over the hearts of many, and that we, his PlayMonster family, will continue to cherish. He touched the lives of everyone he encountered, leaving behind a legacy of warmth and compassion.”\n\n“As we mourn his loss, let us also celebrate the profound impact Rich had on our lives, our company, and the toy industry as a whole.”\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with Rich’s family and loved ones during this difficult time.”\n\n​\n\nJames M. (Jim) Ward, game designer, a member of the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design Hall of Fame for his contributions to Dungeons & Dragons and other games, has passed away, according to a post on his Facebook. He was 72.\n\nWard was a friend of Gary Gygax from the very early days of Dungeons & Dragons development. He and Rob Kuntz wrote Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes in 1976 for TSR, which was the first introduction of gods into the game. He also is the creator of Metamorphosis Alpha, the first science fiction RPG, also published by TSR (see \"Jim Ward's 'Metamorphosis Alpha'\"). He worked at TSR for 20 years in a number of executive positions, and left in 1996.\n\nWard designed the Dragon Ball Z collectible card game, as well as helping with the Tomb Raider, Wheel of Time and Babylon 5 CCGs. He founded the d20 company Fast Forward Entertainment with Timothy Brown, Lester Smith, John Danovich and Sean Everett (see \"Fast Forward Takes Over Campaign\"). He later joined Troll Lord Games as a writer and later the editor for Troll Lord's Castles & Crusades magazine, The Crusader Journal (see \"Jim Ward Editor of 'Crusader'\").\n\nWard had a series of health issues over the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with a serious neurological disorder in 2010 (see \"Jim Ward Fund Requests Donations\"), and had a heart attack in 2014 (see \"Jim Ward Suffers Heart Attack\").\n\nWe knew Ward from his time at TSR in the 1980s and 90s, and found him to be a warm, funny man, and a gamer through and through. We last saw him at a Gamehole Con in the late 2010s, and at that point he seemed little the worse for wear and definitely had the same warm heart. Our condolences to his friends and family.\n\n​\n\nMutsumi Inomata, a longtime illustrator and character designer for video games, passed away on March 10 at 63 years old. Per her official Twitter, her family held a private funeral, and a cause of death was not disclosed. \"It happened so suddenly,\" wrote her sister. \"She still has rough drafts, which I’m sure are still being worked on in heaven.

Beginning with 1997's Tales of Destiny, she would work as a lead character designer on most mainline entries up to 2016's Tales of Berseria. While at Bandai Namco, she also briefly did character design for the Tekken series with Tekken 5, Tekken 6, and Tekken Tag Tournament 2.\n\nAlong with games, Inomata was a character designer or animator for anime. Those series ranged from City Hunter (and its sequel) to Sacred Seven and Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny.\n\n​\n\nShigeichi Negishi, the entrepreneur who invented the world’s first karaoke machine, has died aged 100. Negishi, whose 1967 “Sparko Box” prototype is among several devices credited with ushering in Japan’s karaoke craze, died from natural causes in January. His death, which was made public last week, was confirmed to CNN by Shiro Kataoka, managing director of the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.\n\nBorn in 1923, Negishi founded and ran a company that assembled car stereos for automobile manufacturers in northern Tokyo. A regular listener to a singalong radio show broadcast in Japan at the time, he hooked a spare tape deck up to a microphone and mixing circuit so he could hear himself singing over music.\n\n“When I asked the factory engineer, he said, ‘It’s easy,’” Negishi recalled in an account published by the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association, an industry body for Japan’s karaoke operators. “So, I attached a microphone input terminal to the car stereo and created something like the prototype of a jukebox.”\n\n​\n\nAkira Toriyama, creator of the Dragon Ball, Sand Land, and Dr. Slump manga and the character designer for Dragon Quest and other video games, died on March 1 at the age of 69. The news was announced in a letter from his design and production studio, Bird Studio. The cause of death was given as “acute subdural hematoma,” and his family held a private funeral and requested that no gifts or flowers be sent.\n\n“It’s our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm,” the letter said. “Also, he would have many more things to achieve.”\n\nAs the creator of two best-selling series, Toriyama was hugely influential in Japan, and many manga-ka cite him as a significant influence on their work. In North America, Dragon Ball was an early hit and helped expand the audience for manga and anime to include teens.\n\nToriyama was born in Nagoya, Japan, in 1955 and studied graphic design in high school, eschewing college for a job with a local ad agency. His first published manga was Wonder Island, which appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump in 1978, and over the next two years several more of his stories appeared in the magazine (these were later collected and published in English by VIZ Media under the title Akira Toriyama’s Manga Theater).\n\nIn 1980, Toriyama came up with a goofy comedy manga about an inventor who creates a super-strong robot girl. The series ran for five years in Weekly Shonen Jump, and both the manga and the anime adaptation were massive hits. In Manga! Manga!, scholar Frederick Schodt writes that Toriyama’s income in 1981, when he was 27, was over $2.4 million, and in 1982, the series won the Shogakukan Manga Award.\n\nDr Slump made Toriyama a star, but Dragon Ball made him a superstar. As his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, told the story in a 2016 interview with Forbes, Toriyama decided he wanted to move on from Dr Slumpabout six months after it launched, but it was the most popular manga in Shonen Jump and his editors didn’t want him to quit unless he came up with something even better. Torishima suggested a kung fu series, since Toriyama liked to watch kung fu movies while he worked, and this eventually evolved into Dragon Ball, which Torishima described as a “road movie” based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West. The series ran in Shonen Jump from 1984 to 1995 and was collected into 42 volumes. It is one of the top selling manga of all time, with over 260 million volumes sold throughout the world. It was also adapted into two very successful anime series, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. The different titles reflect a change in tone, as the manga started out with a lot of gags and slapstick humor but eventually evolved into a more action-focused story...\n\n​\n\nTerry Hess, a longtime environment artist for Obsidian Entertainment, passed away last week. The developer has launched a GoFundMe, whose funds will go solely to the late artist's family. Hess first worked as a 3D environment artist for BlackOps Entertainment and Manifest Games in the mid-2000s. In 2005, he joined Treyarch, where he worked on Spider-Man 3, 007: Quantum of Solace and 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, he stayed in the military shooter realm. After working on DICE's Medal of Honor: Warfighter, he joined Visceral Games and EA Montreal on Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel. In 2013, Hess started at Obsidian with its free-to-play game, Armored Warfare. He'd later be assigned to the team working on The Outer Worlds as an environment art lead.\n\nObsidian deemed Hess \"one of the main contributors\" to its early demo to publisher Private Division. The demo helped the team hone \"in on the [game's] look, and is still a meeting that gets talked about with our colleagues at Private Division to this day.\"\n\nOf his Outer Worlds 2 work, the studio noted he \"pushed on what he felt we could, and should, be doing with the worlds we create from a visual standpoint.\"\n\n\"As we continue development of the sequel,\" it continued, \"we will strive to make sure that vision is achieved.\"\n\n\"Terry was absolutely wonderful and can't be replaced,\" wrote Obsidian producer Mikey Dowling. \"Tell people you love them.\"\n\n\"Last week Obsidian had an incredible loss of Terry Hess. He was a great friend and a lovely individual,\" added lead animator Cathy Nichols.\n\n​\n\nJanice Burgess, a longtime Nickelodeon television executive who sought to promote children’s curiosity and sense of play for decades, overseeing popular shows like “Blue’s Clues” and “Little Bill” and creating her own musical children’s show, “The Backyardigans,” died on Saturday in hospice care in Manhattan. She was 72.\n\nHer death was confirmed by Brown Johnson, a longtime friend and the creator of Nick Jr., who said the cause was breast cancer.\n\nIn “The Backyardigans,” five cartoon animals — Tyrone, Tasha, Pablo, Austin and Uniqua — imagine their backyard as a place of adventure, traversing deserts, oceans, jungles, rivers and outer space while dancing and singing to music.\n\nWith the series, Ms. Burgess hoped to help children use their imaginations to have fun. In 2004, Ms. Burgess said in an interview with The New York Times that the idea for the show stemmed from memories of playing in her own childhood backyard in Pittsburgh.\n\n“I really remember it as a wonderful, happy, safe place,” she said. “You could have these great adventures just romping around. From there, you could go anywhere or do anything.”\n\nThe series became a favorite of American preschoolers after it premiered on Nickelodeon in 2004. It was adapted into a live show, “The Backyardigans Live! Tale of the Mighty Knights,” in 2008.\n\nIn 2021, several “Backyardigans” songs, including “Into the Thick of It!” and “Castaways,” found a large and nostalgic audience on TikTok, years after their original release in 2005.\n\n“Janice really taught me about representation in kids’ media and how important it was for kids to not only see themselves, but hear themselves,” Ms. Johnson said.\n\nMs. Burgess made sure to cast children of color, and the roles were recast every few years as their voices changed, Ms. Johnson said. Ms. Burgess wanted their voices to sound natural and “not Broadway,” she said. Ms. Burgess, a music lover, included 80 distinct musical genres in “The Backyardigans,” Ms. Johnson added.\n\n“It was like writing a musical every week,” she said.\n\nThe music was composed by Evan Lurie, who said in an interview that Ms. Burgess’s “ability to cut to the meat of what needed to be done was just astonishing.”\n\nJanice Burgess was born on March 1, 1952, to John Wesley Burgess and Alma Naomi (Thomas) Burgess. She grew up in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh and attended the Ellis School, a girls’ college preparatory school. She graduated from Brandeis University in 1974, according to the university’s website.\n\nShe worked at WQED, the public television station in Pittsburgh, and Sesame Workshop before joining Nick Jr. in 1995. Working at Nick Jr. taught her everything she needed to know about creating a television show for young children, she said at a National Press Club luncheon in 2006.\n\nAt Nick Jr., she oversaw the production of “Blue’s Clues” and “Little Bill,” which went on to win Peabody and Emmy Awards. She won a 2008 Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding special class animated program for her work on “The Backyardigans.” In a statement, Nickelodeon called Ms. Burgess “one of the great architects of Nick Jr.”...\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nRemembering Those that have Passed . . .\n\n2023 and into 2024\n\n​\n\nJohn Birchwood. Toy World is sad to report that popular toy trade stalwart John Birchwood passed away on 21st February.\n\nJohn was born in Nelson, Lancashire in 1940 and educated at Manchester Grammar School. He started working in a retail store for Woolworths, before joining his father, Eric Birchwood, working for Mobo Toys. After that he moved to Chad Valley and subsequently joined Berwick Toys as sales director, eventually becoming managing director.\n\nAfter the collapse of Berwick Toys and the Berwick Timpo Group in the early 1980s, some of its assets were bought from the administrators by A.B.Gee, where John worked for a short period before setting up on his own as a sales agent (Birchwood Agencies) with the help of his father, Eric. Amongst the companies John represented was Morris Vulcan (MV Toys) and after a number of years, John went to work for MV before establishing his own company, World Sports Int. UK in partnership with a Taiwanese manufacturer, which dealt predominantly in roller skates and in-line skates. In the early years of World Sports Int. (WSI), the company was the main supplier of in-line skates to mail order giants Littlewoods and GUS.\n\nIn 1994, John’s son Richard joined the business but unfortunately it was forced to close a few years later due to a series of production issues with the Taiwanese manufacturer. Richard takes up the story and explains what happened next: “In August 1998, with not a penny between us and the financial help of some of Dad’s friends from the toy industry (you know who you are and we are eternally grateful) and a friend of mine, we started J & R Sports, originally operating out of a 5,000 square foot warehouse in Aintree. In April 1999 my sister Lindsay also joined us. After a difficult first couple of years when the in-line skate business was slow, we introduced our JD Bug Scooter range in 2000 and from there the business went from strength to strength. In 2007 we relocated to a bigger warehouse in Huyton that we still run today. In 2011 we became the distribution partner for Madd Gear the UK & Ireland: this was the start of the pro scooter market and Madd Gear was a leading player. In 2012 we relocated again to our current location in Aintree.”\n\nJohn continued to work until his 80th birthday, when he announced his retirement, just before the first Covid lock down. Although Richard admitted: “He continued to come into work over the next three years, never being able to stay too far away. He wanted to know how we were doing, what was happening in the trade and would avidly read Toy World to stay in touch with what was going on.”\n\nAs well as being a proud grandfather, John was also an avid Manchester United fan. However during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, John decided to join his son Richard watching Liverpool, taking him to his first European Cup final in Paris in 1981, with fellow toy doyen Ronnie Yaffe. Also a member of the local Mini Motoring Club, John would often take Mini trips around the UK and Scotland.\n\nIn memory of John, Richard and the family have started a tribute page that contains details of his funeral and also for his friends from the toy trade to share their memories of him with his family.\n\nOur sincerest condolences to John’s children – Richard, Lindsay and Rachel – and his six grandchildren Emma, Olivia, Lily, Amelia, Zac and Ace, and all of John’s former friends and colleagues from the toy community.\n\n​\n\nMark Dodson, a voice actor across video games, TV, and film, died from a heart attack over the weekend.

Well known and liked throughout the trade, Barry Harding was a consummate sales professional. Former colleague John Mitchell described him as “honest, dependable, decent and totally committed – a salesperson of the highest integrity. He was dedicated to his craft and one of the most courteous people you will ever meet.”\n\nBarry had a long and distinguished toy trade career which spanned over 40 years, working with major companies such as Fisher Price, Playmobil and Step2 before setting up his own sales agency, BG Marketing, which represented a number of international toy companies in the UK market, including Kiddesigns.\n\nFollowing many years of service to the toy industry, in which he made a good deal of friends, Barry finally retired at the end of 2018. He will be remembered by his many acquaintances as always being perfectly turned out, with the dapper suits he wore epitomising his meticulous attention to detail and efficiency in business.\n\nToy World would like to add its condolences to Barry’s wife Gill and their children, Lee, Jason, Rebecca and Stuart, and all of his friends and former colleagues.\n\nThe funeral will take place at 11.00 am on March 12th at the Southend Crematorium (SS2 5PX), and afterwards at Roslin Beach Hotel.\n\nYoshitaka Murayama - Eiyuden Chronicle and Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama has passed away.

Mark was always bursting with pride for his two wonderful daughters, Amber and Imogen, and was always talking about them and their futures.\n\n“Mark was a valued member of the OSS team and will be greatly missed. He was a much loved agent by his customers and as one said to me earlier: he was the type of guy you wanted to go and have a beer with.\n\n“On his return from his travels, with Annie on his arm, Mark started his career in the toy trade, first working with Ty Beanies and then with Schleich. He joined OSS in 2015. At OSS Mark was more than a work colleague – we were a band of brothers who loved supporting our customers and then enjoyed our many nights out and weekends away. We were a family and this is devastating to write.\n\n“Our love and support are with Annie, Amber and Imogen and the rest of Mark’s family and friends at this truly sad time.”\n\nNick Saunders told Toy World: “The entire Brainstorm team is absolutely devastated. Mark has worked for us for many years and I have known him ever since I came into the toy trade. He was a delight to work with and we will all miss him immensely – as will all of his customers.

Tony worked for some of the industry’s most prominent toy companies during a long and distinguished career which spanned five decades. His former Palitoy colleague John Nicholas told Toy World: “Tony was my friend and mentor. He and I worked together at Palitoy through the seventies, which was a golden era for the company. Tony was initially promoted to area manager, then to export sales manager and finally to other head office duties. I remember some fantastic times at Toy Fairs over the years, particularly one snowy night in Harrogate when we had a snowball fight around the island outside the Crown hotel, as well as many other Palitoy nights going back to the Brighton Toy Fair days. He was well-liked by all of his customers and his fellow reps: he was someone you knew you could trust and he always had a joke to tell. I am proud to have called Tony a friend and we will miss him.”\n\nMost recently, Tony spent many happy years at Character Options, and managing director Joe Kissane told Toy World: “Tony was a wonderful man. He was hilarious, kind, generous and a true professional. I remember when he joined Character: we were in our early years and we were looking for a NAM to join Mike Rowe. Tony was recommended to us by Jo Hall – he had been made redundant and was working in a bakery. Mike tracked him down to where he was making bread, offered Tony the National Account Manager’s position and the following week he was selling toys again. It was undoubtedly one of the best decisions we ever made. I can honestly say he was a true gentleman in every sense of the word. The customers loved him, he spent many happy years with Character before he retired, and he is still talked about within the company.”\n\nSales director David Bramford added: “By all accounts, Tony was a truly lovely guy who earned legendary status amongst the Character team and naturally mastered the art of selling.”\n\nToy World joins all of Tony’s industry friends and colleagues in sending our condolences to his wife Marie and children Gary and Jackie.\n\nMarlene Flumerfelt (the following is from Kirsten Anderson) - Dec 9th we had a beautiful celebration of life/funeral for Marlene Flumerfelt who we lost far too soon and suddenly.

We shared an abiding love for the toy industry, children, and child development. We also shared a love for literature, especially 19th Century novels, poetry, and Shakespeare that we loved talking about--as well as being able to quote classic Looney Tunes cartoons to one another. Off mic, Richard always made me laugh, and his sometimes-quirky, always mordant humor was a constant delight.\n\nRichard had a huge heart, loved his wife, Wendy and of course his kids and grand kids. He took great pleasure in one grandson's approach to play and loved watching that.\n\nWe've lost a really great man who devoted his life to helping others and who took great joy in life. As Houseman wrote:\n\n\"Today, the road all runners come,\n\nShoulder-high we bring you home,\n\nAnd set you at your threshold down,\n\nTownsman of a stiller town.\"\n\nHe will be missed. We're all a little richer for having known him, and his loss will be deeply felt.\"\n\n​\n\nGlobal Toy News Mourns the Loss of founder Richard Gottlieb\n\nOn October 26th Richard lost his battle with ALS which he had fought for roughly 2 years. He slogged through language slurring, then no language and using an electronic voice, then a feeding tube to eat and finally in the last few weeks deep double pneumonia that was too much for him to overcome. Throughout the ordeal, he maintained his sense of humor saying when asked to do a chore, “I have a disease, you know” and never lost his interest in others.\n\nBorn in Hampton, Virginia, he went to the University of Richmond and then started with Southern Distributers in 1971, he was with them until 1984 when he joined Western Publishing Company and traveled all over the United States selling books and other products. In 1990 he went to Cadaco and then in 1994 he moved to New York City and launched Global Toy News in 2007 which he wrote for weekly until 2 weeks ago. He also started Global Toy Experts with his former client, then colleague and friend, Steve Velte doing Expert Witness work, mergers and acquisitions and all things toys.\n\nRichard was a big personality and he loved life, he loved people and he loved the toy industry. When we met over 7 years ago, since I am an educator, I was so taken with his fascinating career choice which I soon came to understand was his life blood. We talked about toys and games and their usage constantly. We often played games, especially word games which we played daily challenging each other to be better. He was a wordsmith and a book lover, reading constantly.\n\nRichard had a highly creative mind, he loved all aspects of the toy business from the creation, the manufacturing, the marketing, the selling, the packaging- the whole shebang. Over the 25 years he did this he traveled to Texas, California, China, Germany and other places to speak about, write about and celebrate the business of toys. He met the most wonderful people from all corners of the world, a small portion of whom I was lucky enough to meet too, and he spoke about the many ideas, the friendships, the joy these toys, the toy companies big and small and, the toy people brought children. He was fascinated with all the possible ideas for their implementation at home and in schools. His advice when asked what toys to buy a child was always the same: Buy them something that you love and that has meaning to you and they will love it.\n\nEarlier this month Richard was at The New York Toy Fair where so many of you said hello, came to find him, met with him and told him how meaningful he was to the industry. This meant the world to him and he felt the love and the respect and was both touched and gratified. We celebrated his 76th birthday a week later, so he exited elegantly with touchpoints from family, friends and colleagues earlier this month.\n\nWe were working on a book together with Chris Byrne about the toys famous people played with as children and the career paths they chose, and in his honor, we will continue that work.\n\nThank you all for making his world so full, he fed off your ideas, your energy and your wisdom.\n\nHe always wanted to be interesting and interested and that he was.\n\nThis article was written by Wendy Levey (Richard’s Wife)\n\nhttps://globaltoynews.com/2023/10/27/global-toy-news-mourns-the-loss-of-richard-gottlieb/\n\n​\n\nDavid A.

Peter passed away some years ago, and we are sad to announce the death of Pam on 29th September.\n\nElys Toys, which started life in 1920, closed in 2001, at the time citing growing competition from larger toy retailers and supermarkets.

The couple married in 1958, and shortly moved to London.

Smyths now operates over 272 stores across six countries.\n\nTributes have been paid to Liam by the local Chamber of Commerce, where a spokesperson described him as a leading figure in the business life of the town. In a statement, members paid tribute to his tireless efforts to improve the economy and amenities there.\n\nLiam was a proud supporter of Claremorris GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association). A statement from the club said his passing was a huge loss to the town: “Everyone associated with Mayo GAA would like to express their sincere sympathy on the untimely death of Liam Smyth, a proud Claremorris man and a great supporter of Mayo GAA over the years.”\n\nThe club said its academy squads benefited greatly from Liam’s support and added that “Liam always extended this support in a quiet and an unassuming way; his warmth and generosity extended to many other walks of life both locally and further afield.”\n\nThe Claremorris Chamber of Commerce statement added: “With his brothers Tony, Padraig and Tommie, together they accomplished what very few Irish businesses achieve, they grew one shop in a small town into a global giant. Liam wore that modestly. Regardless of how busy he was, he always found time for whatever cause or group needed assistance. He was one of a kind.”\n\nLiam is survived by his wife Anne and their five sons: Alex, Ben, Harry, Josh and Sam. Toy World would like to add its condolences to them, and to Liam’s brothers Tony, Padraig, Thomas and Joe, his sister Maura and the extended Smyth family at this sad time.\n\nJohn Cook - passed away on June 28th 2023.

A few years later, K’Nex opened its UK business in 1994, headed up by Peter Brown and Russ Ward. Simon joined them in 1995 to manage the supply chain and operations. When the K’Nex International business transferred to Hasbro at the end of 1998, Simon moved back to Hasbro for a brief period before joining forces with Peter and fellow K’Nex employee Carl Moran, putting their redundancy payments and life savings into starting Flair Leisure Products PLC – a decision Simon’s wife Tina says caused him concern early on, having only just started a family: their first child, Ellie, was barely a year old.\n\nFlair started trading on 1st March 1999 with Simon in the role of commercial director overseeing Marketing and Operations.The company forged vital and enduring partnerships that continued right through Simon’s career, most notably with Generation Media and Evolution PR.\n\nIn 2003, just four years after the company was created, Flair became a ‘Sunday Times Fast Track 100’ company, vindicating Simon’s decision to invest everything in the business. That same year, Flair was named Company of the Year at the 2004 Toy Fair industry awards.\n\nIn 2008 Peter, Simon and Carl decided to sell the business to Italian toy giant Giochi Preziosi, staying on to run the business with many of the original team.\n\nFlair progressed rapidly up the NPD industry charts. In 2009, the company was awarded not only Supplier of the Year but also Girls’ Toy of the Year for Sylvanian Families. 2011 saw the company achieve what Simon referred to as the ‘champions league’ spot when it became the No 4 toy company in the UK.\n\nIn 2013, when Peter decided to take more of a back seat and became company chairman, Simon took on the role of managing director of Flair, a position he held for further eight years. He eventually decided to leave the business in July 2021, starting a new chapter in his life and career by working on various projects with Marc Sivner and David Greenberg at Singleton Trading.\n\nSimon kept his business and personal lives very separate. A passionate football fan, he was a season ticket holder with his beloved Fulham FC for many years. The matches were a way for him to relax away from the busy world of toys.\n\nA family man, Simon had two daughters with his wife Tina, and would have celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary on Christmas Eve this year. Ellie was born just before he started Flair, and Ruby was born in the early Flair years. Sadly, Simon lost his father, Peter, in 2019. His mother, Phyllis, says his father was incredibly proud of Simon’s achievements.\n\nFriends have remembered Simon as ‘a big man with an enormous sense of humour’, who was both cheeky and quick witted. Those who knew him well enjoyed the way he rocked in his chair while holding his belly, laughing uncontrollably at something amusing; colleagues say there was a lot of laughter in the Flair years. Simon worked hard, but he also laughed a lot and loved what he did.\n\nAlways with an abundance of new ideas backed by sound commercial acumen, Simon was driven and passionate and could reliably spot an opportunity and how to make it work profitably.\n\nHis loss will be felt by a great many people, not least his family: Phyliss, Tina, Ellie and Ruby, and his sister Helen. Simon will also be missed by many friends and colleagues within the industry who knew or worked with him during his career.\n\nSimon will be remembered as a respected and successful business leader, who didn’t seek the limelight and didn’t like too much formality. His numerous acquaintances say they will treasure their many fond memories of their time with this ‘unforgettable man – our boss, our friend, and all the silly jokes, fun and laughter we shared with him’.\n\n​\n\nDoris Mae Bergen, February 11, 1932 - July 5, 2023.
