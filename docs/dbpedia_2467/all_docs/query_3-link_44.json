        "text": "“Contract with America” and speaker of the House\n\nAided by President Bill Clinton’s unpopularity, the Republican Party gained control of Congress following the 1994 midterm elections. Gingrich was seen as the architect of the victory, especially noted for helping draft the “Contract with America,” a document outlining legislation to be enacted by the House within the first 100 days of the 104th Congress. Among the proposals were tax cuts, a permanent line-item veto, and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. In December 1994 Gingrich was chosen by the majority Republicans as House speaker, and he assumed the office the following month. With one exception, all parts of the “Contract with America” were passed by the House.\n\nShortly after becoming speaker, however, Gingrich’s popularity began to wane. In late 1995 he was widely blamed for partial government shutdowns after refusing to compromise with President Clinton on the federal budget. He also faced a series of ethics investigations. In 1995 he returned a $4.5 million book advance after the House ethics committee questioned its appropriateness. The following year an investigative subcommittee found that, in connection with a college course he taught from 1993 to 1995, Gingrich had failed to seek legal advice concerning tax-exempt donations used to fund the class and that he had inaccurately denied the involvement of GOPAC, a political action committee that he once headed, in the course’s development. Based on these findings, the ethics committee concluded that he had violated House rules, and in January 1997 the House of Representatives voted to accept the committee’s recommendation that Gingrich be reprimanded for providing false information to the committee and that he pay $300,000, an amount that the committee characterized as partial reimbursement for its investigation. Amid the controversies, which resulted in Gingrich becoming the first speaker in the House’s history to be given a formal reprimand for ethics violations, he was narrowly reelected to the position in early 1997.\n\nIn January 1998, reports surfaced alleging that Clinton had lied before a federal grand jury concerning his involvement in an extramarital affair with a former White House intern. Gingrich backed a bid to impeach and remove the president from office. Many voters concluded that the House had overreached in its attack on Clinton, and the Republicans lost five seats to Democrats in the 1998 midterm elections. Following the election, there was a backlash against Gingrich within the Republican Party, with numerous Republicans blaming him for failing to present a clear and innovative agenda to the country and instead choosing to focus party strategy upon the impeachment proceedings against a highly popular president. Faced with dwindling support, Gingrich stepped down as speaker of the House in November 1998, and in January 1999 he resigned his seat in Congress.\n\n2012 presidential campaign\n\nGingrich remained involved in politics, serving as a consultant and as a television commentator on the Fox News Channel. In 2007 he founded American Solutions for Winning the Future, a public policy organization. Amid speculation that he would run for president in 2012, Fox terminated his contract in May 2011. Shortly thereafter Gingrich announced his candidacy. Gingrich’s campaign was almost over before it began, however, when many of his senior advisers resigned en masse in June 2011. Strong performances in a series of televised debates helped him regain his stride, and, by December, national polls of Republicans were showing Gingrich and Mitt Romney as the party’s leading candidates. Gingrich’s subsequent performances over the early months of 2012 were uneven: he won contests in South Carolina and Georgia and finished second in Florida, Nevada, Alabama, and Mississippi, but he placed no higher than third in some 20 other state primaries and caucuses held between January and March. By late March, Gingrich’s campaign acknowledged that he would be unable to win enough delegates to secure the nomination before the Republican National Convention in August. Gingrich subsequently reduced his staff and scaled back his public appearances, though he vowed to stay in the race. In early May, however, he suspended his campaign."
