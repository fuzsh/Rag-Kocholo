He then worked briefly in the office of Peter & Grissel, a building firm, and for Henry Roberts (1803-1876). He as also an assistant to Sampson Kempthorne (1809-1873) an architect who specialised in the design of workhouses. In 1832 he joined the office of the architect Henry Roberts (1803-1876), who was then working on the Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge. He left Roberts in c.1835 to set up his own practice and from 1838 was in partnership with William Bonython Moffatt (1812â1887) as Scott and Moffatt. The partnership was dissolved in 1846. Towards the end of his career, he was also in partnership with his second son, John Oldrid Scott (1841-1913) in London."
