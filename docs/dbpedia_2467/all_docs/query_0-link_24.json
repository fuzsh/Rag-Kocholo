        "text": "I DETROIT FREE 81 FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 1992 LOCAL NEWS Boy names accomplice, pleads guilty to murder BY SANDY MCCLURE Free Press Staff Writer A 15-year-old Holly boy who was on trial in the stabbing murder last September of an elderly neighbor woman stunned his family and others in a Pontiac courtroom on Thursday when he pleaded guilty and named an accomplice. Gerald Persails announcement caught many, including his attorney Jerome Sabbota, off guard because the judge had ruled that the boy's earlier confession to police the strongest evidence against him was inadmissible. Without the confession, Sabbota said he believed Persails would have been acquitted. \"Persails wanted to plead guilty from the outset,\" Sabbota said, \"but I wouldn't let him. If he were an adult, there's no way I'd let him plead.\" Rumors that Persails had an accomplice in Juanita Truesdell's murder the first in several years in the northwest Oakland County village had surfaced before .\n\nBut the boy did not tell authorities or his attorney about one until Thursday, they said. Persails told Oakland County Probate Judge Eugene Moore that the 71- year-old woman surprised him and a friend after they broke into her home to burglarize it on Sept. 22. Persails said she \"was in the hallway. I hit her over the top of the head with a hammer.\" WOMAN MISSING Hamtramck police are seeking Antoinette Burlison, 47, who was last seen leaving her boyfriend's home on Dec .\n\n14. Police don't suspect foul play, but fear she may be disoriented. She has reddish-brown hair, is 5 feet 6 and 145 pounds and sometimes uses the surname Burlison-Rychick. A reward has been offered; anyone with information is asked to call 876- 7823 anytime. Fee, stricter to tighten BY CHRIS CHRISTOFF Free Press Lansing Bureau Chief LANSING Stricter laws to prevent insurance companies from becoming insolvent and leaving policyholders in the lurch were proposed Thursday by Democratic and Republican lawmakers .\n\nAnd to enforce those laws, state insurance commissioner David Dykhouse said he'll seek up to a 0.1- percent fee on premiums. The fee would raise up to $20 million annually to buy computers to better track insur'ers' finances, he said. That announcement ruffled some in the industry, who said the charge would be passed to customers. \"We won't support that,\" said Doug Cruce, president of the Michigan Insurance Federation. \"This would make the insurance companies a tax collector for the state.\" Joe Olson, vice president of Citizens Insurance Co .\n\nand a close political ally of Gov. John Engler, said he would lobby the governor to oppose the fee. It would cost $1 for every $1,000 of insurance premiums. The accomplice as quoted by Persails said, \"Here's a knife. Kill her.\" Persails said: \"I stabbed her with the knife .\n\nI took the purse and left the house. He stabbed her with the knife and ran out.\" Police and prosecutors immediately began investigating Persails' allegation, but no new arrest warrant had been issued as of late Thursday, authorities said. Because he was 14 when Truesdell was killed, Persails could not be tried as an adult and can only be incarcerated until he's 21. He will be 16 on Oct. 21 .\n\nSabbota, also Persails' court-appointed guardian, said the boy likely will be free within two years. He has been named in numerous home breaking and entering charges and an assault and battery charge while in the county's juvenile home. \"Children's Village is full,\" Sabbota said. \"What are they going to do with him, send him to a halfway house?\" But assistant Oakland County prosecuting attorney Ed Cibor said the decision on how long Persails is incarcerated is up to Judge Moore. There are no state sentencing guidelines, he said .\n\nSentencing was set for Feb. 13. Persails and others had set up \"a fort\" in the woods near his house filled with items stolen during house robberies, said Gerald Persails Sr. \"It was a regular Toys Us,\" said Sabbota. laws proposed insurance reins the fee favorably because it would be a user fee and not a general tax .\n\nEngler spokesman John Truscott said the governor has not yet agreed to the fee but has asked Dykhouse to work out an agreement. House Speaker Lewis Dodak, D- Birch Run, said he didn't know if he would support the fee. \"Isn't it interesting the governor is talking about another tax increase, from a governor who pledged not to increase taxes?\" Dodak said. Dykhouse said the fee would further wean the insurance bureau from the general fund, which now pays for one-third of its regulatory operations. Fees on insurers account for the rest .\n\nThree lawmakers said they will introduce bills to give the bureau more regulatory power. The sponsors are Rep. Mary Brown, D-Kalamazoo; Sen. Paul Wartner, R-Portage, and Rep. Alvin Hoekman, R-Holland .\n\nThe bills would make it easier for the insurance bureau to use early warning signals 1 to show an insurer is overextended and unable to cover its OBITUARIES ELLSWORTH complished R. musician ELLISON, and 82, an automo- ac- DEATHS ELSEWHERE tive employee, died Tuesday after a 1A.J.

Death notices MICHIGAN DATELINE Teen is convicted in man's slaying T. CLEMENS A felony Macomb Thursday 17-year-old murder County man convicted in of jury the a 1990 slaying of a gas station attendant but acquitted a second teenager .\n\nRelatives and friends of Alexis Ayala of Chesterfield Township wept as the jury pronounced him guilty after about four hours of deliberations. The charge carries a mandatory penalty of life in prison without parole. Bradley Margret, 22, of New Baltimore was slain at the Union 76 station at Gratiot and 25 Mile Road in Chesterfield Township, on Nov. 29, 1990. The shooting was captured on a store videotape .\n\nProsecutors argued that Eric Moutray, 17, of Clinton Township conspired i in the robbery and murder, acting as decoy. Jurors said they weren't convinced that Moutray was a willing participant. STATE Court upholds ruling on Headlee tax cut plan LANSING The Michigan Court of Appeals has refused to hear an appeal filed by supporters of the stalled Headlee property tax cut initiative. The court on Wednesday upheld a ruling by state elections officials who decided that 15,000 petition signatures were invalid. Therefore, the backers can't put their proposal before voters .\n\nWhen Capitol is restored, two in GOP will stay put LANSING Two top House Republicans said Thursday they will not move into the lavishly restored state Capitol when work is completed this year. Minority Leader Paul Hillegonds, R-Holland, and Floor Leader Donald Van Singel, R-Grant, said they believe space reserved for private offices at the Capitol should be converted to a museum. Both lawmakers said they will remain in a state building across the street from the Capitol. Hillegonds said he was responding in part to public anger over reports that lawmakers were spending $800,000 to furnish the offices and committee rooms. The overall restoration, which Hillegonds said he supports, costs about $58.5 million .\n\nWAYNE Arab Americans to honor ex-hostage Alann Steen DEARBORN Former hostage Alann Steen will be honored today in Dearborn at a dinner sponsored by the Lebanese Consulate and a coalition of Muslim, Christian and Druze Lebanese Americans.
