        "text": "Family Maps of Coffee County, Alabama, by Gregory A. Boyd, J.D., 316 pages with 65 total maps; Softbound, 8.5x11 inches; publ. 2010: ISBN: 9781420315523.\n\nLocating original landowners on maps has never been an easy task until now. This volume in the Family Maps series contains newly created maps of original landowners (patent maps) in what is now Coffee County, Alabama, gleaned from the indexes of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. But it offers much more than that. For each township in the county, there are two additional maps accompanying the patent map: a road map and a map showing waterways, railroads, and both modern and many historical city-centers and cemeteries.\n\nIncluded are indexes to help you locate what you are looking for, whether you know a person's name, a last name, a place-name, or a cemetery. The combination of maps and indexes are designed to aid researchers of American history or genealogy to explore frontier neighborhoods, examine family migrations, locate hard-to-find cemeteries and towns, as well as locate land based on legal descriptions found in old documents or deeds.\n\nThe patent-maps are essentially plat maps but instead of depicting owners for a particular year, these maps show original landowners, no matter when the transfer from the federal government was completed. Dates of patents typically begin near the time of statehood and run into the early 1900s.\n\nWhat's Mapped in this book (that you'll not likely find elsewhere) . . .\n\n6844 Parcels of Land (with original landowner names and patent-dates labeled in the relevant map)\n\n95 Cemeteries, plus . . .
