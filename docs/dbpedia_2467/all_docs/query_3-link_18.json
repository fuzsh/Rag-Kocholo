Joseph received a mare and a rifle when he became of suitable age. Joseph was probably born in North Carolina, but his father's family moved into Tennessee while he was still a child. Joseph was call \"the Tennesseean\" in letter written by Mrs. Ann Royall in 1819 during her interview with him.\n\nOn February 29, 1790 Joseph married Nancy Gage. They were listed on the 1790 census of Rutherford County, North Carolina\n\nFrom the Bastrop County Tax Records, Joseph Burleson was the owner of 222 Acres of land, the original grantee was Stephen F. Austin. Joseph was taxed for 7 negros, 7 horses, 70 head of cattle, a wagon and utensils. Joseph and second wife, Elizabeth Ailor were charter members of Providence Primitive Baptist Church, their family bible in the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nBuried at Burleson Cemetary near Smithville, Texas.

Andrew Jackson fighting the Creek Indians in 1814 when his first wife Nancy died in Madison Co., Alabama. In 1813 the Creek Indians who had fought on the side of the British in the Revolution, again took up arms against the Americans beginning with the massacre at Fort Mims. The Creek confederacy with a total of 30,000 occupied most of Alabama and Georgia at one time. Joseph was involved in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on April 27, 1814 in eastern Alabama, in which Gen. Jackson won a victory over the Creek nation and produced a treaty that ended the Creek War [1813-14] and opened Alabama and parts of Georgia to white settlers. Joseph also fought in the Battle of New Orleans. Some descendants of Joseph included G. Wash. Jones and Omar Burleson who both served in the congress of the United States.\" -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF JOSEPH BURLESON \"THE TENNESSEAN\" Called \"The Tennessean\" by Anne Newport Royal (title of only novel) - published book based on letters written about interviews with various people in Alabama (one of whom was Joseph Burleson) 1774/75 - Joseph's father, Aaron Burleson II and possibly an uncle (brother of Aaron) are said to be the first white settlers to build permanent homes on the Watauga Creek which flows into the Holston River between what is now Johnson City and Elizabethton, in Sullivan County (then a part of NC), TN. Aaron had moved here from Rutherford Co, NC just across the TN line and somewhat north of Mitchell County, NC. 1782 - Aaron receives 200 acre grant on Lick Creek in Washington County, TN 1783 - Aaron Jr. receives 100 acres on Pinson Creek, Washington County, TN 1782 - First Massacre of Mitchell County, NC - Aaron killed by Cherokees, leaving nine orphans, the oldest just under 14. Joseph was 12. The family was frequently subject to raids by Cherokees and Tories. Mitchell County was located closer to Rutherford County, NC, south of Johnson City, TN. Another account of this massacre takes place in present-day Tennessee close to the Clinch River... don't understand how Aaron's family would have been involved, though, if he lived in Sullivan Co...although, Sullivan Co (at that time) should have extended as far west as the Mississippi River! Found a \"Lick Creek\" close to present-day Sumner Co, TN that bordered Lincoln Co. (later Warren Co.), KY where other Burlesons, Pulliams, Hogans, McFaddens, etc. were living at this time... may have gotten the two \"Lick Creeks\" mixed up! It would help to explain why Aaron III was here (m. Volley Hogan c. 1780) 1782 - Tax Lists for 1782 in Rutherford County, NC show no Burleson at all. But, following the Massacre in Mitchell County, NC, Aaron's family resettled on more familiar ground again. In 1790, Rutherford County, NC Census reports three Burlesons: Jonathon, Joseph and Thomas. Census records state the following: BURLISON, JONATHON M-637 007 120 01 01 02 00 00 Morgan Dist, 14th Comp BURLISON, JOSEPH M-637 007 118 01 00 01 00 00 Morgan Dist, 9th Comp BURLISON, THOMAS M-637 007 118 01 04 03 00 00 Morgan Dist, 9th Comp 1799 - Joseph makes a trip to Warren County, KY where three of his brothers had moved in 1796. There, he arranges for a land grant and returns to NC for his family. He is shown as taxpayer in Warren County for three years. 1800 - Rutherford County, NC - JOSEPH BURLISON is only one left in area - pr. 94 shows family group of 30010-10010-00. This is a young family just getting their start - 4 young children, probably married about 10 yrs. Joseph married Nancy Gage here 28 Feb 1790. 1800 - Sometime during 1800, Joseph moves his family to Warren County, KY. The records show that three brothers of Joseph went to KY. Jonathon and Thomas were listed in Rutherford Co, NC 1790 census records... Thomas with two other adult males in the household. James and John may have been these two adults. If so, then James, John, Joseph and Jonathan went to KY. Thomas and his descendants are found in Mitchell Co, NC (Thomas is said to be buried in the Burleson cemetery with three of his sons in Hawk community of Cane Creek, Mitchell Co, NC). 1804 - Joseph, James and John leave Warren County, KY and go to Hardeman County, TN (James to Davidson Co, TN) where some relatives lived. ***** Who? ***** (May have been Jonathan before his marriage to Margaret Pulliam in KY, 1818) 1805 - Hardeman Co, TN: Joseph's son Aaron was born here. 1807 - Joseph, James and John were in Mississippi Territory - a part of which would later become Madison County, Alabama. 1809 - Joseph, James (who still owned home in Davidson Co, TN) and John all signed a petition referred to as \"Intruders on Indian Land,\" asking that they be granted pre-emption to buy the land on which they had lived since 1807. 1811 - New Madrid earthquake... lost everything he owned to disreputable \"preachers\" who promised Joseph that they would prepare his family for death (thought the earthquake was God's Armageddon - never knew what an earthquake was). \"My fine wagon and team; all my horses and all my money, 1500 dollars in silver, and a fine drove of cattle, gone... I now left my wife and children to shift for themselves, and went into the army, and acting as Commissary under General Jackson, I soon recovered my losses.\" 1812-14 War of 1812 and Creek Wars - 27 Mar 1814 - Battle of Horseshoe Bend, AL (also called Battle of Tohopeka) - served on 13th Regiment Miss. Terr. Militia. James was a Capt., Jonathon, son of John, a Lieutenant. Joseph's brother, James, one of eight man firing squad which carried out death sentence on a deserter - only deserter shot during the campaign. Joseph witnesses. 1812-1815 Madison County Superior Court has records for him: 546. JOS. BURTISON vs. Peter Baloo -- said Burlison \"did steal a hog and he could prove it.\" $1000 asked for --- 1 cent awarded. 348. Isaac Taylor asse of JOSEPH BURLISTON vs. Michael Byrd (in said note called \"Burlison\"). Jury: Thos. Land Jr., Robt. S. Browning, Joseph Ward, Geo. Simmons, John Logan. 1814 - Cotaco Co, AL (now Morgan Co, AL) - Joseph and nephew Jonathon moved here and settled on Flint Creek about eight miles south of Decatur and four miles north of Hartselle, neither of which existed in 1814. 1817 - Joseph and Jonathon helped form an anti-crime organization known as \"The First Legislature.\" Horse stealing and other crimes had become too irritating to the locals south of the river. Joseph was elected President of this organization and Jonathon was Secretary. 1818 - Cotaco County appointee to determine best route for a road leading from Ditto's Ferry, at Whitesburg, by way of Somerville (then county seat), on to the Lawrence County line. 1818 - Moulton, AL - Joseph moved here and joined a group of men intent upon establishing the town of Moulton, AL which later became the county seat of Lawrence County, AL. Here, he served as trustee of the town from 1818 to 1827. He also offered to donate land to build county buildings if Moulton would become the seat of government. 1819 - Rutherford Co, NC Deeds: Burleson, Joseph / Clarke, Arthur / Deed/32-33/26/1819 29 Nov 1822 - 240 acres taken up in Marion County, AL between the Whitehouse and Buttahatchee School areas. Plot Sec. 6 & 7, T11S R11W & Sec.1 of T11S R12W. 1834 - 80 acres taken in Marion County, AL - Whitehouse to Buttahatchee School - Sec. 6 & 7, T11S R11W (same plot as in 1822...?) Early 1830's - Joseph's nephew, Edward (son of James) had gone to Texas and secured a land grant on the Colorado River. He subsequently returned to Hardeman Co, TN to his family and convinced the rest to join him. He contacted his Uncle Joe in Moulton and got him to join in. 1833 - Emigrated to Texas: 17 Aug 1835 - Cert.#244a - San Augustine Co, TX: \"I certify that Joseph Burleson a native of Tennessee of the US of A is a man of family consisting of eight persons... man of good... emigrated to the Country in 1833.\" Saml Thompson Alcd From slip of paper w/various items: \"Joseph Burleson Senior has selected League No. 13 below the Road and laying on Austin Boundary line on Walnut Creek. Application, James Rogers, Jas Burleson. Attended to... 1835 - Joseph acquired a league of land on Walnut Creek, east side of the Colorado River in Bastrop County, Texas. Three of his sons had married before the move, but all three and his sons-in-law all moved to Texas and fought in the war for Independence from Mexico. His son, Aaron and son-in-law James M. Hardeman, are two of the men holding the rope in the picture of the capture of Santa Anna (Mexican General and President), displayed in Austin, TX. A copy of the Joseph Burleson Bible is on display at the ALAMO Museum. Although only two pages are on display, a copy of the family records in the bible are available in the DTR Library just west of the Alamo. 2 Aug 1849 - Joseph dies and is buried on land that he got from the Mexican government near Smithville, Texas, now known as Burleson\\Fawcett Cemetery. His is the oldest grave.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------- From: THE STORY OF THORNHILL, MARION COUNTY, ALABAMA http://members.home.net/jmize/genealogy/thill.htm At some time in the late 1820 or 1830s, Joseph Burleson, born 1770 in the mountains of North Carolina, built an east-west road from the community of Houston (later to become the county seat of Winston) to Pikeville (the county seat of Marion). This road likely followed Indian and game trails and traversed along the north banks of Buttahatchee river in the Whitehouse area. Joseph Burleson had acquired several hundred acres centered around a homeplace on the high-ground hillside (now known as the Haley family and Whitehouse cemetery) which overlooks a sweep of verdant green pastureland that extends over a broad area along the north bank of the Buttahatchee river near its confluence with the Wyley (or Wiley) branch.\n\nJoseph Burleson, Richard Priest and others from the Huntsville & Moulton area were land speculators of their time. Some of them were able to quickly turn their modest investments in prime land for profits of up to 400% within a few years.\n\nThe story of Joseph Burlesons (b Feb 1, 1770 NC d Aug 2, 1849 TX) family history is most interesting and important to settling north Alabama and can be quickly summarized as follows:\n\nJosephs father, Aaron II (b 1734-d 1782) was killed in 1782 by Cherokee Indians in the First Massacre of Mitchell County NC (valley between the Bald Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains; on the north side of the Great Smoky Mountains, south of Johnson City TN). Joseph was 12 years old and one of nine minor children left at home when his father was killed. One of Josephs sisters was also scalped by the Indians but survived. Some of this Burleson family, including Joseph, moved on into Warren County Kentucky, near Lexington by 1796. By 1807 Joseph and his brothers John & James B. Burleson had moved into Madison County, Mississippi Territory, living near the Huntsville spring. In December 1811, Joseph had taken a trip to Missouri to visit Burlesons there and experienced the great New Madrid earthquake in which the Mississippi River is said to have flowed backward. Back home in 1812, the three Burleson brothers and five of their sons joined the Mississippi Territory Militia (two were ranked Capt. and another a Lt.) under Andrew Jackson and all participated in the Battle at Horseshoe Bend Alabama, and later at the Battle of New Orleans. After the war, Joseph ran a public house (room and board) in Moulton and there met a traveling writer from the northeast named Anne Newport Royall, who wrote of the Burleson family adventures now captured in a book entitled, \"Letters from Alabama, 1817-1822\". She later wrote a novel patterned after the life of Joseph Burleson. During the 1821-1835 period, Joseph attracted a number of his Burleson cousins to come down from TN to take land in Marion County. In about 1835, he was enticed to join with Sam Houston and others of his old Andy Jackson army comrades in fighting for Texas independence with the lure of free bounty land. Today, one of his sons (Aaron) and his son-in-law (James M. Hardeman) are portrayed in a large painting in the Texas State Capitol building in Austin as the two men holding the rope in the capture of Santa Anna. [Note: the Burleson's were strong believers in Christianity; a cousin of Joseph, one Rufus Columbus Burleson b 1823 in Morgan Co AL, went on to Waco TX where he was founder of Baylor University and served as its President for 50 years !] Sons of Josephs first cousin, David F. Burleson, who had settled in Murphreesboro TN, were among the first and long-lasting residents of Marion County. Davids son John Washington Burleson (b Sept 3, 1775 NC d Apr 25, 1845 Marion Co AL - had ten children), and his son Hilkiah (Indian name; b 1786 NC d 1856 Marion County AL - had 26 children), and a daughter, Margaret Peggy (b 1791 NC d Jan 1, 1839 Marion County AL - had nine children) who married to Ezekiel Pope (b abt.1790 d ?). The mother of these Marion County Burleson pioneers was Ursula Weatherford Burleson (b abt 1755 in NC or TN d 1835 in Rutherford Co TN), said to be an Indian princess and a close relative of the half-breed William Weatherford or 'Red Stick' who led the Creek Indians into war with the white settlers. _______ THE STORY OF THORNHILL, MARION COUNTY, ALABAMA from http://members.home.net/jmize/genealogy/thill.htm (Present Thornhill, Mize Store,Whitehouse & Buttahatchee School areas) by Joel Sanford Mize\n\nExcept for a handful of hardy pioneers who lived with the Indians, first settlement in the Thornhill area by English origin white men first occurred about the time Alabama became a state around 1819. A few French trappers may have lived in the area for brief periods for a 100 years before the English came. It was only after General Andrew Jackson defeated the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River in 1814 that Alabama territory south of the Tennessee River became safe for the settlers of european origin. The government land office in Huntsville, Alabama sold some land in the Thornhill area beginning in 1822. It was in that year that the Byler Road begun in 1819 was completed from the Tennesse River area southward to Tuscaloosa, completing a connection to Nashville via the upper Natchez Trace (Military Road). Several of these first buyers had scouted out the land in advance of the sale and usually preferred the rich river bottom lands along with some prime ridge land between the coves for its prospective agriculture (mainly cotton) use and access to good drinking water. A man named Richard Priest (son-in-law of Joseph Burleson), who lived in the Moulton area bought the first 80 acre parcel in central Thornhill in 1821-1822 followed by John Green taking an adjacent 80 acres in 1823. Priest along with Joseph Burleson and others took land in the upper Buttahatchee river bottoms near the Whitehouse to Buttahatchee school area at this same time. This first-bought acreage in central Thornhill roughly coincided with the Mitchell-Hulsey-Postell farms of more recent times. There was a waiting period of about one year from application for the land until the 'Patent Land' was issued to the buyer. Note: the area called Thornhill was broadly used to cover much of eastern Marion county in some census takings of the 1800s. Actually in 1860 the area was referred to as Haleyville (and stretched northward to current Bear Creek, then called Allens Factory) after the Green Haley family presence in the Whitehouse area; and the area of Winston county now occupied by Haleyville was then referred to as Thornhill and therefore it is proper to call Haleyville, Old Thornhill. By 1870 census this was 'flipped' and Haleyville was in Winston County and Thornhill in Marion, but for census purposes Thornhill still covered a broad area from the Whitehouse-Buttahatchee on the south to Old Ireland on the west, extending northward to near Bear Creek. The First Wave of Settlement: As one might imagine the demand for parcels to the south of current Thornhill along the Buttahatchee River bottoms were more prized and far more people took land along the corridor between the Whitehouse and the area known as Buttahatchee School. Some of the earliest State land purchasers (before 1840) are as follows: Thornhill Central (i.e., near the present church +- about 2 miles): Richard Priest, 80 acres, Nov 29, 1822, Sec 23, T10S R11W John Green, 80 acres, Oct 1, 1823, Sec 23, T10S R11W Walter Matthews, 40 acres, 1838, Sec 33, T10S R 11W Thomas Power, 40 acres, 1839, Sec 35, T10S R11W\n\nThornhill North (i.e., from the present Thornhill Rd/Hwy 129 [Mize store area] junction NE to county line): Alex Underwood, 80 acres, Sept 10, 1838, Sec 11, T10S R11W John McDaniel, 40 acres, 1839, Sec 12, T10S R11W\n\nThornhill South (from current Whitehouse to Buttahatchee School area): Joseph Burleson, 240 acres, Nov 29, 1822, Sec 6 & 7, T11S R11W & Sec 1 of T11S R12W Nathaniel Hobson, 80 acres, Dec 3, 1822, Sec 6, T11S R11W John Hobson, 80 acres, Dec 3, 1822, Sec 4, T11S R12W Isaac Reed, 240 acres, Oct 1, 1823, Sec 3, T11S R12W & Sec 4 11S 12W John Burleson, 160 acres, Oct 20, 1823, Sec 4 & 5, T11S R12W Nathan Self, 160 acres, Oct 20, 1823, Sec 28 & 33, T10S R12W Hezekiah Fredrick, 80 acres, Oct 20, 1823, Sec 21, T10S R12W Richard Priest, 80 acres, Apr 4, 1825, Sec 7, T11S R11W Hilkiah Burleson, 80 acres, Jul 5, 1827, Sec 2, T11S R12W William Nelson, 40 acres, Sept 10, 1834, Sec 30 T10S R11W Joseph Burleson, 80 acres, 1834, Sec 6 & 7, T11S R11W Daniel Stanford, 40 acres, Sept 10, 1834, Sec 1, T11S R12W Lewis Love, 40 acres, Oct 14, 1834, Sec 7, T11S R11W John Montgomery, 40 acres, Sept 10, 1838, Sec 7 T11S R11W John Burleson, 40 acres, Sept 10, 1838, Sec 7 T11S R11W John Johnston, 40 acres, Sept 10, 1838, Sec 12 T11S R12W Hilkiah Burleson, 40 acres, Aug 1, 1839, Sec 1 T11S R12W\n\nLetters would be sent 'back home' by couriers to tell family of the fair new lands; and the word would spread. Wagons in the adjoining states would then be heaped with the family goods and the sturdy oxen or the best mules would be harnessed for the journey into Alabama, which largely followed Indian trails or primitive, quickly built roads. An example of a letter sent back home is the following one sent in 1820 from a member of the Tucker family who settled down on the Marion/Fayette border.\n\nTo Willia Rhew Georgia Jasper County to be left at Joel Wises ferry or at William Scottse ferry 1820 State of Alabama, Tuscaloosa County Dear Brothers and Sisters, I gladly embrace the opportunity of riting to inform you that we are all in tolorable health at present hopeing when these few lines reaches you they will fine you all in good health. I have nothing vary particular to rite to you only I am well satisfied with the country I have taken a tripe upon the Sipsey and I like that cuntry better than where I live now and so nothing more at present only I want you Mr. William Rhew to push that note of Hambricks as quick as possible and you will oblige me vary much and so nothing more at present only, remains your unworthy brother January 20, 1820 Allen Tucker [an uncle of Prudy Tucker Tidwell of Thornhill]\n\nAt some time in the late 1820 or 1830s, Joseph Burleson, born 1770 in the mountains of North Carolina, built an east-west road from the community of Houston (later to become the county seat of Winston) to Pikeville (the county seat of Marion). This road likely followed Indian and game trails and traversed along the north banks of Buttahatchee river in the Whitehouse area. Joseph Burleson had acquired several hundred acres centered around a homeplace on the high-ground hillside (now known as the Haley family and Whitehouse cemetery) which overlooks a sweep of verdant green pastureland that extends over a broad area along the north bank of the Buttahatchee river near its confluence with the Wyley (or Wiley) branch.\n\nJoseph Burleson, Richard Priest and others from the Huntsville & Moulton area were land speculators of their time. Some of them were able to quickly turn their modest investments in prime land for profits of up to 400% within a few years.\n\nThe story of Joseph Burlesons (b Feb 1, 1770 NC d Aug 2, 1849 TX) family history is most interesting and important to settling north Alabama and can be quickly summarized as follows:\n\nJosephs father, Aaron II (b 1734-d 1782) was killed in 1782 by Cherokee Indians in the First Massacre of Mitchell County NC (valley between the Bald Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains; on the north side of the Great Smoky Mountains, south of Johnson City TN). Joseph was 12 years old and one of nine minor children left at home when his father was killed. One of Josephs sisters was also scalped by the Indians but survived. Some of this Burleson family, including Joseph, moved on into Warren County Kentucky, near Lexington by 1796. By 1807 Joseph and his brothers John & James B. Burleson had moved into Madison County, Mississippi Territory, living near the Huntsville spring. In December 1811, Joseph had taken a trip to Missouri to visit Burlesons there and experienced the great New Madrid earthquake in which the Mississippi River is said to have flowed backward. Back home in 1812, the three Burleson brothers and five of their sons joined the Mississippi Territory Militia (two were ranked Capt. and another a Lt.) under Andrew Jackson and all participated in the Battle at Horseshoe Bend Alabama, and later at the Battle of New Orleans. After the war, Joseph ran a public house (room and board) in Moulton and there met a traveling writer from the northeast named Anne Newport Royall, who wrote of the Burleson family adventures now captured in a book entitled, Letters from Alabama, 1817-1822. She later wrote a novel patterned after the life of Joseph Burleson. During the 1821-1835 period, Joseph attracted a number of his Burleson cousins to come down from TN to take land in Marion County. In about 1835, he was enticed to join with Sam Houston and others of his old Andy Jackson army comrades in fighting for Texas independence with the lure of free bounty land. Today, one of his sons (Aaron) and his son-in-law (James M. Hardeman) are portrayed in a large painting in the Texas State Capitol building in Austin as the two men holding the rope in the capture of Santa Anna. [Note: the Burleson's were strong believers in Christianity; a cousin of Joseph, one Rufus Columbus Burleson b 1823 in Morgan Co AL, went on to Waco TX where he was founder of Baylor University and served as its President for 50 years !]\n\nSons of Josephs first cousin, David F. Burleson, who had settled in Murphreesboro TN, were among the first and long-lasting residents of Marion County. Davids son John Washington Burleson (b Sept 3, 1775 NC d Apr 25, 1845 Marion Co AL - had ten children), and his son Hilkiah (Indian name; b 1786 NC d 1856 Marion County AL - had 26 children), and a daughter, Margaret Peggy (b 1791 NC d Jan 1, 1839 Marion County AL - had nine children) who married to Ezekiel Pope (b abt.1790 d ?). The mother of these Marion County Burleson pioneers was Ursula Weatherford Burleson (b abt 1755 in NC or TN d 1835 in Rutherford Co TN), said to be an Indian princess and a close relative of the half-breed William Weatherford or Red Stick who led the Creek Indians into war with the white settlers. ALABAMAS WHITE HOUSE...HISTORY LIVES ON TODAY\n\nThe history and establishment of the White House Church of Christ as told to Mr. Wesley Thompson in 1941.\n\nAlong in 1832, three dedicated young men, a Mr. Doss (possibly an uncle or cousin of Reuben J. Doss b 1820), a Mr. Burleson (possibly John Washington Burleson, Jr. b 1811) and a Mr. Cagle (possibly John Cagle b 1815) rode horseback to Huntsville, Alabama. These men were headed that way with plans to hear a great man speak of the Restoration Movement, (1832 documentary). The men then returned with a fire to bring people, fallen away from Christ, back to the original plan of the Disciples. The men started separate meetings around the community, they called the Headwater of the Butahatchee River, northwest Alabama until 1836 and established the White House Church of Christ as it is now.\n\nEarly preachers at the White House were: W.P. Caskey [further references on Caskey can be found in CASKEYS LAST BIOGRAPHY]. He was from Tennessee and came in the 1830s to west Alabama and north Mississippi; Fannin B. Srygley: T.B. Larimore; Jerry Hallbrook; Tolbert Randolph and Charlie Wheeler. All these were here in the 1830s and 1840s.\n\nThe first minister of which there was any record of was Green Haley, who was also active in the hill country during the turbulent times of the war.\n\nDuring the Civil War some of the early members were; the Dosses, the Burlesons, the Cagles, the Underwoods, the Phillips, the Mitchells and the Anson Hydes.\n\nAfter the Civil War, in connection with the White House some of the people were the Lang C. Allens, the Jim Allens, Baz Tidwell, Riley Cole, William Weatherford and R.H. Logan...\n\nMarriage\n\nHusband: Joseph* R.
