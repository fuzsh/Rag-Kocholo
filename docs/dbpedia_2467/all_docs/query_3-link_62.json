Cindy Soburn, “Re: Leona Condit Storer,” 2/9/2012, Email files of David Condit.\n\nThank you so much for responding. Yes I knew Uncle Dick passed away after my dad ...dad died in November 1994. We never got to Idaho to visit them there and I remember being very sad when they moved away from here.\n\nI remember the home they had in \"The Village\" in San Mateo and then moved to Foster City. My oldest son and I were just reminiscing of the Foster City home two nights ago - describing their home to the boys, how Uncle Dick would let us sit in the backyard and watch the airplanes come in and he would name them all!\n\nI think I heard Aunt Lee had moved to Fremont otherwise I would have visited. I have lived in Livermore for the past 14 1/2 years, moving from Fremont in 1997.\n\nI am sorry to hear Iona passed away - and yes, it was Eunice, the other sister I knew who lived blocks away from Aunt Lee and Uncle Dick in \"The Village\". I remember when Uncle Dick married Aunt Lee - we ran back and forth between their home and Eunice's!!! Was Gloria Eunice's oldest child? I vaguely remember the kids - been so long ago!\n\nI would love to have any pictures you would be willing to send me. Would it be possible to ask Gloria to contact me - maybe since she closed out Aunt Lee's estate she would possibly remember something. I'm kind of reaching, I know, but my boys and grandchildren are asking a lot of questions to which there is a bit of a void and I don't have answers,\n\nMy boy's dad passed away when they were quite young , so they not only do not have their grandparents, Aunt and Uncle they loved dearly but their dad as well. If I could fill in some blanks for them that would be wonderful.\n\nThose were very nice sentiments of my uncle - thank you. We have a very small family compared to yours! Uncle Dick was dad's only sibling and the only relative who lived relatively close to us . Mom's siblings as well as her parents all lived in Michigan or Illinois so we had little contact. I as well spent many weekends at Aunt Lee and Uncle Dick's. Great memories!\n\nI would be happy to pay you for any pictures and/or a copy of the CD - just let me know.\n\nThank you again and if and when you speak with Eunice please give her my best. I don't know if she'll remember me but tell her I was Tom and Irene Storer's daughter.\n\nCindy\n\n13204. “Montana, County Births and Deaths, 1830-2011,” For Darrell Wayne Condit, b. 1/21/1955, Memphis, Tennessee; d. 7/10/2003, Troy Lincoln, Montana, Columbus, Stillwater, Montana, digital images, Ancestry.com, Dt, Ancestry.com.

Nancy Frias, “Condit Cousins,” 1/16/2017-1/24/2017, Email files of David Condit.\n\n1/16\n\nMy name is Nancy Frias, and I come from the Condit line - Jonathan born in 1736; then his son Jonathan born in 1769, then Lucinda born 1799, then Eliza born in 1830, then Cora in 1874 who was my great grandmother and who I remember well. What is the actual website to go to and see the complete history? By that I could tell if I have anything to contribute to the ancestry line. My mother was a historian by avocation, and I have a lot of stuff. I traced my lineage so I could join the Daughters of the American Revolution and was surprised to find out sixteen members of the family were Revolutionary War veterans.\n\nThanks.\n\nNancy Frias\n\n1/17\n\nI have several pages of information I could send you right now; that would be the birth/death/marriage info for Cora Chase, her children, and the progeny of Erma Chase, her oldest daughter who is my grandmother. I also have pictures and narratives about some people; is that anything you would be interested in? I think I know who to contact about the other descendants of Cora Chase, which would be my grandmother's brothers and sisters. Shall I send you what I have by snail mail or should I scan it and send? I don't have a scanner but can probably go down to the Fed Ex store and do it. Let me know what you think. Nancy\n\n1/24\n\nYes, you had sent it previously. I have contacted a second cousin in Wisconsin who is looking through boxes for genealogical information. He would be Cora Tuttle Chase's grandson. Mine I can mostly make paper copies of with no research required. I also contacted a cousin in Sheldon, Iowa, who might have the info for the rest of Cora Chase's children. She lives in assisted living so I'm not sure how mentally acute she is. I'll get back to you but it may be a few weeks. Nancy\n\n13210.
