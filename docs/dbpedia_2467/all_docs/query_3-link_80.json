        "text": "Nature of Source\n\nRecords generated from a number of documents relating to the issue of illegitimacy and bastardy cases mostly trying to determine the name of the bastard child’s father. A child born to unmarried parents was considered by law to be illegitimate. The range of documents, mostly deposited in the parish chest, include the Bastardy Examination, Bastardy Warrants And Summons, Bastardy Order, Maintenance Order and the Bastardy Bond.\n\nA woman discovered pregnant outside marriage, apart from the social stigma attached to such behaviour, would probably become chargeable to the parish. If the putative father failed to admit his responsibility then the authorities acted swiftly and immediately instigated an Examination to establish the identity of the father carried out by either the Churchwarden and the Overseer of the Poor or the Quarter Sessions. These powers were of investigation were established under the Bastardy Act of 1575/6. The person was normally known to the mother and named by her during the examination.\n\nFollowing the Examination, heavy pressure was exerted on the father to financially maintain the child and enter into a Bastardy Bond agreeing to pay the churchwarden and the overseers for the child’s maintenance. The terms of maintenance lasted until the child was old enough to be apprenticed out. If the supposed father resisted signing the bastardy bond, the parish officials could apply to the Justices for a filiation order which forced the father to pay for the upkeep of the child. Records of payments from the father are sometimes recorded in the Overseer of the Poor accounts or Churchwarden’s accounts.\n\nThe Bastardy/Affiliation Order was issued by the Justice of the Peace at the Petty Sessions or Quarter Sessions following an examination. The Order obliged the putative father to pay for the child’s maintenance or face a possible prison sentence. After the New Poor Law of 1834, the parish authorities lessened their role in bastardy cases leaving the woman the option of applying herself for the bond from the Petty Sessions. Local newspapers often reported on maintenance orders heard before the petty sessions or quarter sessions and on fathers who failed to pay or absconded.\n\nThe Warrant gave the order for the father to appear in court if he attempted to abscond. Where disputes over payments occurred, the case papers may be found in the Petty Sessions records, although very few records remain.\n\nAgreements and discussions of individual cases can be found in the records of the churchwarden, parish constable, overseers of the poor and amongst the vestry papers. In many cases the father married the mother soon after the birth of the child or made private arrangements for the child’s upkeep, in which case no record will be found of his name amongst the bastardy documents. The putative father often married the mother under pressure, usually by license and sometimes paid for by the overseers. Marriage licence records provide a marriage date and other useful information. A bastard child belonged to the parish where it was born, so an expectant mother moving away from her legal place of settlement could be forcibly removed to her home parish before the birth of the child. Be aware however, that occasionally the wrong man was named as the father.\n\nIt was not uncommon for a married couple to assign a family surname as a middle name. However, in the event of an unmarried mother giving the illegitimate child a surname as a middle name, this could indicate the paternity of the child. It worth looking for the will of the father of a bastard, as illegitimate children had to be acknowledged as such in the will, often described as the ‘reputed’ son. The Family Law Reform Act of 1969 gave illegitimate children equal inheritance rights.\n\nAlso see\n\nApprenticeship Indentures, Parish\n\nChurch/Ecclesiastical Court Records\n\nCivil Registration, Birth including illegitimacy\n\nMarriage Licence Records\n\nOverseers of the Poor Accounts\n\nSettlement Certificates/Examinations and Removal Orders\n\nWorkhouse Records (Poor Law Unions)\n\nOnline Databases\n\nwww.findmypast.co.uk (London Poor Law Abstracts, 1581-1899.
