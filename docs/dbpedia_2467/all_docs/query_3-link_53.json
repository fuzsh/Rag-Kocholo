        "text": "***Learning Continuous*** Last week, I implemented an university enrollment system using C++. The enrollment system contained the following classes: EnrollmentSystem: stores a list of the registered universities in the system University: represents an University, with data such as the university name, registered students, and courses offered Course: stores information about a course, such as course title, course number, and which students are enrolled in the course Student: stores information about a student, such as student name and student id Some of the key features of this enrollment system include adding an university to the system, enrolling a student in a particular course, and returning information about a specific course or student. This enrollment system serves as an education management system that facilitates many of the key processes and activities required for an university entity. A common real-world application of this type of system is Canvas (https://lnkd.in/gfxRv-2z).\n\nIs Your Last Name Holding You or Your Students Back Academically? The University of Michigan researchers analyzed over 30 million grading records and found that students with last names starting with letters later in the alphabet tend to receive lower grades. This is due to biases in sequential grading and the default alphabetical order of submissions in the Canvas learning management system. These students also receive more negative and less polite comments, and their grading quality is lower, as measured by post-grade complaints. The researchers collected historical data from the Fall 2014 semester to the Summer 2022 semester and found a decline in grading quality as graders evaluated more assignments. Students whose surnames start with A, B, C, D or E received a 0.3-point higher grade out of 100 possible points than compared to when they were graded randomly. Likewise, students with later-in-the-alphabet surnames received a 0.3-point lower gradeâ€”creating a 0.6-point gap. Suggestions to improve our grading practices and minimize implicit grading bias: 1. Randomize the order for grading assignments. 2. Institute clear grading criteria and rubrics 3. Blind grading practices Source: Zhihan (Helen) Wang et al, 30 Million Canvas Grading Records Reveal Widespread Sequential Bias and System-Induced Surname Initial Disparity (2023).

In the world of creativity, there's always room for growth, and this course reaffirmed that belief for me. From mastering new techniques to polishing my design skills, the main takeaway from this experience is the importance of continuous learning and practice. Excited to apply my newfound knowledge and elevate my canvas creations to new heights! #CanvasDesign #Creativity #ContinuousLearning"
