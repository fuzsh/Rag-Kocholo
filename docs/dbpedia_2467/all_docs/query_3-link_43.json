If your search is successful, you can select those records to add to your cart. When your research is complete, the “View Request” button will take you to a form to request copies or more information about your chosen records.\n\nSome Lawrence County records have been digitized and are hosted on other websites. For a guide to finding these records on FamilySearch, Ancestry.com, and elsewhere, see “Where can I find digitized records?” below.\n\nIf you are able to visit the Archives in person, you can find information for planning your visit and lists of many of the resources available in our research room in the next column, under “At the Archives.”\n\nCemetery, Marriage, and Obituary indexes can be searched by name (marriages by date), and copies of the actual record can be requested.\n\nThe Court database contains the every-name indexes for the majority of our processed loose court records. The Deed database consists of every-name indexes for Deed Bks. A – H and will be expanded in the future. These databases can be sorted by court and type of record, searched by name and date, and include listed roles, relationships and property information whenever available."
