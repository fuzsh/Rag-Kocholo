        "text": "In the futuristic video for “Can You Feel It,” The Jacksons sang of unity and triumph as hologram-like beings tromping through a desert landscape, outer space, and above a city amid flames and waves of water. At one point, glowing gold glitter fell from a hand. I was mesmerized by the video as a kid, mainly because of Michael Jackson, later dubbed the King of Pop. The video was an early nod to the cinematic music video premieres to come, such as “Remember the Time.”\n\nI felt that same alluring magic when the late Jackson, or “MJ,” performed his hits at his “30th Anniversary Celebration” show (the concert was also televised) in New York at Madison Square Garden in 2001, just before the 9/11 attacks. He moonwalked around Usher in a dance-off and had many guests onstage and in the audience. People of all ages and ethnicities cried and hugged as they sang their favorite tunes.\n\nThat same magnetism and enchantment that left fans spellbound at the 2001 concert was captured by Broadway in Boston’s electrifying production of “MJ: The Musical” (through July 7). The incredibly talented cast — three of whom portray Michael Jackson at different points in his life — explored the star’s life through song and hinted at his troubles around the costly 1992 Dangerous World Tour. The Tony Award-winning show, which flashes back and forth in time, has a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage and is choreographed and directed by Christopher Wheeldon.\n\nJackson grew up in showbiz with his domineering father, Joseph Jackson (an excellent Devin Bowles who also doubles as tour manager Rob), who ushered most of his kids into the spotlight. This exciting jukebox musical, expertly directed by Wheeldon, shows how that relationship shaped Michael Jackson’s work ethic and packs a dizzying number of hits into the show. It also gives audiences a glimpse into how hard Michael and his brothers worked to attain and maintain fame.\n\nBane Griffith, Brandon Lee Harris (a graduate of Berklee College of Music) and Roman Banks were all fantastic as Michael Jackson as a child, during the Victory tour era in the 1980s, and around the Dangerous Tour, respectively. (Griffith shares the role of Little Michael with Josiah Benson. Griffith was playing the role when I saw the show.)\n\nPart of what makes the show so much fun to watch, apart from the magnificent dancing and singing, is the work of the lighting (Natasha Katz), sound (Gareth Owen), projection (Peter Nigrini) and set (Derek McLane). Prime examples of this were the frightening environment for “Thriller,” with red lights, fog and zombies (which made my seatmate jump), a gritty street with neon signage into the infamous Studio 54 and through the ornate “Dangerous” set, among others.\n\nThe whole creative team, including costumer Paul Tazewell, worked cohesively and dressed the cast in appropriate outfits, from fringed vests to ghoulish getups, and later outfitted Michael Jackson in his signature jackets throughout the years.\n\nThe band — with music supervision, orchestration and arrangements by David Holcenberg and music direction from Victor Simonson — created full, lush sounds for MJ’s iconic songs, including “Keep the Faith,” “Jam” and the heartwarming “Human Nature.” Jason Michael Webb provided additional arrangements and orchestrations. The music on the night I saw the show was conducted by Rick Hip-Flores.\n\nMichael Jackson’s career spanned multiple decades and spawned estimated album sales in the millions. His most popular solo album, “Thriller,” had seven hit singles according to Apple Music, won seven Grammys, and is currently certified 33 times platinum by the Recording Association Industry of America, according to Billboard.com.\n\nDespite his success, his legacy has been marked by controversy. But in the play, the eldest Michael Jackson hopes that no matter what, people will remember his music. For some, separating the artist from the art might be hard to do. (Read WBUR’s take on both sides of that argument here and here.)\n\nAs I headed out of the theater after the final scene, the band continued to play MJ’s hits. I spotted a small kid with glittering gloves on in the hallway, and I locked eyes with a theater worker who danced with me from across the room as I inched my way down the corridor and sang along to the music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the entertainer got his wish after all."
