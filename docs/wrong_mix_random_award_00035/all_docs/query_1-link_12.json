        "text": "Michael Jackson\n\nSinger, songwriter, producer\n\nFor the Record…\n\nSelected discography\n\nVideos\n\nCompositions\n\nWritings\n\nSources\n\nArtfully clad in an outfit featuring his signature white socks, red leather jacket, and single, sequined white glove, Michael Jackson is widely recognized as one of the world’s top musical entertainers. In barely two decades he has grown from a five-year-old boy-wonder singing with his brothers to a legendary solo artist who dazzles audiences worldwide with his deftness as songwriter, producer, video pioneer, showman, and vocalist par excellence. With a knack for translating tunes from almost any genre—rhythm-and-blues, pop, rock, soul—into success, the prodigy defies all labels. Jackson is “a half-mad and extraordinary talent,” marveled Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone, with the ability to “combine [his] gifts in an electrifying, stunning way … that has only been equalled in rock history by Elvis Presley.”\n\nBorn into a black, working-class family in Gary, Indiana, Jackson was the seventh of nine children, all of whose lives were shaped by their parents’ insistence on firm discipline. The Jackson parents, however, were also musical. Joe Jackson, a crane-operator for U.S. Steel, sang and played the guitar with a small-time group known as the Falcons, and Katherine Jackson played the clarinet. Both believed that encouraging their children to pursue their musical interests was a good way to keep them out of trouble.\n\nBy the time he was five years old, Michael, together with his four older brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon), had formed a rhythm-and-blues act called the Jackson Five. Initially enlisted to play the bongos, Michael revealed himself as such a little dynamo that he soon became the group’s leader, even at a young age able to mesmerize audiences with his singing and dancing. The group won their first talent competition in 1963, gave their first paid performance in 1964, and had proven themselves a popular local act by 1967. Although primarily imitative at this stage, with their work rooted in the tradition of such musical greats as the Temptations, Smokey Robinson, and James Brown, they were good enough to cut a couple of singles for Steeltown Records, an Indiana label.\n\nThey were also good enough to compete, in 1968, at Harlem’s Apollo Theatre, then the most prestigious venue for launching black musicians. Their riveting performance brought them so many national engagements that Joe Jackson left his job to manage his sons’ act. It also captured the attention of Motown Records, in its golden days as the United States’s premier black recording label. Before long, the young musicians signed with Motown and moved to California when the label relocated its headquarters there.\n\nUnder the strict guidance of the Motown magnates, the Jackson Five propelled themselves into the public eye\n\nFor the Record…\n\nFull name, Michael Joseph Jackson; born August 19, 1958, in Gary, Ind; son of Joseph (a crane operator) and Katherine (a homemaker and occasional sales clerk; maiden name, Corse) Jackson. Education: Attended schools in Indiana and California. Religion: Jehovah’s Witness.\n\nVocalist with the Jackson Five, 1963-76, recording first singles, 1967-68, began performing nationally as opener for other artists, 1968, signed with Motown, c. 1968, released first album, 1969, started appearing on television, 1970, including “The Ed Sullivan Show,” “American Bandstand,” and the “Andy Williams Show,” first worldwide concert tour, 1972; vocalist with the Jacksons, 1976-1981, signed with Epic, recording first album for that label, 1976, made a thirty-six-city tour, 1981; made “Victory” reunion tour with his brothers, 1984; co-organizer of U.S.A. for Africa famine relief effort, 1985.\n\nSolocareer, including work as a vocalist, songwriter, producer, video artist, and actor, 1972—, recorded first solo album, Got to Be There, 1972, made songwriting debut with “Shake Your Body (Down to the Grave)” on the Destiny album, 1978, with later credits including “Beat It,” “Billie Jean,” and “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” co-produced Thriller album, 1982, established himself as a significant video artist with the Thriller videos, 1983, made first solo concert tour, 1987.\n\nAlso appeared in film version of Broadway musical “The Wiz” and involved with the 3-D film fantasy “Captain Eo.” Engages in philanthropic work, including efforts to help eliminate world hunger, establishing a burn center in Los Angeles, Calif., and supporting the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and a camp for children suffering from cancer.\n\nAwards: Winner of numerous awards, including twelve Grammy Awards (eight in 1984); named number one recording artist of 1983 by Billboard magazine; winner of eight American Music Association Awards in 1984, winner of two special American Music Association Awards, 1989;The Guinness Book of World Records lists Thriller as the biggest-selling album of all time.\n\nAddresses: Home —4641 Hayvenhurst Ave., Encino, Calif. 91436.\n\nwith their first Motown single, “I Want You Back.” Released in November, 1969, the recording reached number one on the charts in early 1970 and eventually sold more than one million copies. It was quickly followed by other hit singles like “ABC,” the Grammy Award-winning pop song of 1970, as well as similarly successful albums. Even a “Jackson Five” television cartoon program was created to showcase the group’s music. By the time the Jackson Five took their version of “bubblegum soul,” as their music was now called, on worldwide tour in 1972, they were a smashing success, especially among the teenybopper set. Indeed Michael, “the little prince of soul,” was barely a teenager himself and had become not only a millionaire, but an international sex symbol ready to launch his solo career.\n\nThe rising star premiered as a solo artist with the 1972 album Got To Be There, earning him a Grammy Award as male vocalist of the year, and followed it with the gold album Ben, thus beginning a steady stream of solo recordings. With his first solo tour more than a decade away, however, the young Jackson still directed most of his energy into the group’s work. The Jackson Five, in fact, made another breakthrough in 1973 with the single “Dancing Machine.” Succeeded by the epynomous album, the sophisticated recording introduced a disco beat that broadened the group’s audience.\n\nAs members of the Jackson Five matured, so did their music, and they eventually outgrew the agenda Motown had established for them. They were eager for greater artistic control, and when their contract with Motown expired in 1976 they signed with Epic renamed as the Jacksons (Jermaine dropped out of the group while youngest brother, Randy, joined it).\n\nAlthough frustrated by the creative restrictions placed on their first two albums for the label, the Jacksons were finally given control with Destiny, an album marking Michael’s songwriting debut. The risk proved fruitful both for the recording company and for the artists. Featuring the “funkier” sound the entertaining brothers favored, the 1978 album went platinum and spun off two hit singles. In 1980 the group duplicated the feat with Triumph, written and produced by Michael, Jackie, and Randy, and in the summer of 1981 they embarked on the enormously successful thirty-six city tour that produced The Jacksons Live, the group’s last album together.\n\nAs the Jacksons disbanded to pursue individual interests, Michael exploded onto the music scene as an independent artist, outstripping the success of his own multiaward-winning album of 1979, Off the Wall, as well as shattering almost every other record in recording history. His landmark album was Thriller, unleashed in 1982. It was a sensation that appealed to almost every imaginable musical taste and established Jackson as one of the world’s pre-eminent pop artists. The album went platinum in fifteen countries, gold in four, and garnered eight Grammys; its sales exceeded thirty-eight million copies worldwide, earning it a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest-selling album in recording history; it spun-off an unprecedented seven hit singles; and it enabled Jackson to claim the spotlight as the first recording artist to simultaneously head both the singles and albums charts for both rhythm-and-blues and pop.\n\nThe extraordinary Thriller also generated a frenzy among the heartthrob’s fans, dubbed Michaelmania by the media, and its remarkable success sealed the musician’s reputation as “brilliant” and a “rock phenomenon”; one critic even went beyond “superstar” to call Jackson a “megastar.” But success has also brought the artist under intense scrutiny, both by his admirers and the communications industry, and each new achievement—from his innovative video work to his astonishing 1984 reunion “Victory” tour with his brothers to his latest, most startling album, the 1987 Bad —has only seemed to fuel the lust for information.\n\nIndeed, for someone who has been in the limelight since the age of five, Jackson has seemingly by magic kept his private life private. Writing for Maclean’s, Gillian MacKay reported that he “has astonished his fans by shedding his lively, button-cute image and transforming himself into a mysterious, otherworldly creature perpetually posing behind a mask.” So intensely private is this star that he rarely interacts with the media.\n\nHis silence, however, has tended to stimulate conjecture, and the tabloids are notorious for speculating about him. One day there are rumors that he has lightened his skin with chemicals and taken female hormones to maintain his falsetto voice quality, while the next day gossip columns question his sexual identity and charge that he has extensively remodeled his body with plastic surgery. He is also infamous for what has been described as a certain “weirdness” or “quirki-ness,” although many dismiss the charge as nonsense. As Jackson’s friend, producer Quincy Jones, was quoted in the star’s defense by People: “[Michael is] grounded and centered and focused and connected to his creative soul. And he’s one of the most normal people I’ve ever met.”\n\nDissecting the Jackson mystique is a task that even seems to have eluded more serious journalists. Most view him as a paradox. He is both superstar and devout Jehovah’s Witness, a man who—as neither drinker, smoker, nor drug experimenter, has eschewed much of the glamorous life for healthy living. Some see him as a man-child living in his own reality—like one of his heroes, Peter Pan, refusing to grow up. Others, like Newsweek’s Jim Miller, find him “a stunning live performer, but also a notorious recluse…. He’s utterly unlike you and me, with a streak of wildfire that unpredictably lights his eyes.”\n\nTheories aside, admirers and detractors alike agree, as Gilmore concluded, that Jackson’s success is based on his “remarkably intuitive talents as a singer and dancer—talents that are genuine and matchless and not the constructions of mere ambition or hype.” It is this talent, coupled with the star’s hard work and often touted perfectionism, that has enabled Jackson to cross virtually every music line ever drawn.\n\nJackson, in fact, has been credited with resuscitating a languishing music industry and with practically eliminating barriers barring blacks from mainstream music venues. More than one critic has imbued him with a chameleon-like capacity for being all things to all people and thus pleasing everyone. In a review for People, Gary Smith related the artist’s musical conquest to his ability to create “a portable dream,” explaining that “in this dream world his androgyny does not threaten the virile, his youth does not threaten the old. His blackness does not threaten the white, for nothing seems quite real and all is softened by fragility and innocence.”\n\nAlthough the music idol himself might be eccentric or enigmatic, his achievements are very real. With the completion of his first solo tour, a long, triumphant venture begun in September, 1987, Michael Jackson seems to be at the peak of his powers, a hero living the American Dream. Indeed, experts who appoint Frank Sinatra as the star of the 1940s, Elvis Presley as the star of the 1950s, and the Beatles as the stars of the 1960s have already named Michael Jackson the star of the 1980s—and speculate that he will claim the 1990s as well.\n\nSelected discography\n\nSingle releases for Steeltown Records; With the Jackson Five\n\n“I’m a Big Boy Now,” c 1967.\n\n“You’ve Changed,” c 1967.\n\n“We Don’t Have to Be Over 21 (To Fall in Love),” c. 1968.\n\n“Jam Session,” c. 1968.\n\nLPs; With the Jackson Five\n\nDiana Ross Presents the Jackson Five, Motown, 1969.\n\nABC, Motown, 1970.\n\nThird Album, Motown, 1970.\n\nThe Jackson Five Christmas Album, Motown, 1970.\n\nMaybe Tomorrow, Motown, 1971.\n\nGoin’ Back to Indiana, Motown, 1971.\n\nThe Jackson Five’s Greatest Hits, Motown, 1971.\n\nLooking Through the Windows, Motown, 1972.\n\nSkywriter, Motown, 1973.\n\nGet It Together, Motown, 1973.\n\nDancing Machine, Motown, 1974.\n\nMoving Violation, Motown, 1975.\n\nJoyful Jukebox Music, Motown, 1976.\n\nThe Jackson Five Anthology, Motown, 1976.\n\nBoogie, Natural Resources/Motown, 1980.\n\nFarewell My Summer Love (recorded, 1973; previously unreleased), Motown, 1984.\n\nAlso released numerous anthologies since 1980.\n\nLPs; With the Jacksons\n\nThe Jacksons, Epic, 1976.\n\nGoin’ Places, Epic, 1977.\n\nDestiny, Epic, 1978.\n\nTriumph, Epic, 1980.\n\nThe Jacksons Live, Epic, 1981.\n\nVictory, Epic, 1984.\n\nLPs; Solo\n\nGot to Be There, Motown, 1972.\n\nBen, Motown, 1972.\n\nMusic and Me, Motown, 1973.\n\nForever, Michael, Motown, 1975.\n\nThe Best of Michael Jackson, Motown, 1975.\n\nOff the Wall, Epic, 1979.\n\nThriller, Epic, 1982.\n\nBad, Epic, 1987.\n\nAlso narrator for E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial Storybook, MCA, 1982.

He has also been mired in controversy. By the time of his mammoth 1995 release HIStory: Past, Present and Future —Book 1, Jackson had weathered speculation about plastic surgery and family infighting, as well as accusations of child molestation, attacks on perceived anti-Semitism in his lyrics, and suspicion that his marriage was an attempt to camouflage his real sexuality.\n\nAt the same time, the marketing campaign for HIStory was the biggest ever seen for an album; amid the hype, strangely enough, Michael Jackson was trumpeting the message that he resented intrusions into his privacy. All of this tended to overshadow the music; although many critics felt that his newest work paled next to the breathless innovations of his 1980s recordings, it was clear that Jackson’s career—despite the predictions of pundits—was far from over.\n\nThe Jackson Five\n\nIt was a career that began quite early. Michael was born in Gary, Indiana, in the late 1950s; he and his brothers were assembled into a singing group when he was only five. Despite his extremely young age, he soon distinguished himself as a singer and dancer of prodigious ability. No mere child prodigy, Michael had a gift for vocal phrasing—as well as a sensual power—that was not only well beyond his years, but would have been astonishing in a performer of any age. After winning several talent contests, the Jackson 5, as the group was called, signed a recording contract with the trailblazing soul label Motown and proceeded to rule the charts in the late 1960s and early 70s with such hits as “I Want You Back,” “Stop, the Love You Save,” “ABC,” and “Dancing Machine.” By 1972 Michael had begun releasing solo albums, and sang the hit title song to the movie Ben.\n\nMichael and the group (with the exception of brother Jermaine) left Motown in 1975, signing with Epic Records, which also gave Michael a solo deal. Two years later he starred in the film version of the hit musical The Wiz, which also featured singer Diana Ross and comic Richard Pryor. Quincy Jones, who produced the soundtrack album, became one of Michael’s longtime friends and collaborators. 1979 saw the release of Michael Jackson’s extraordinarily successful album Off the Wall; this record included the hit singles “Rock With You” and “Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough” and eventually\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn Michael Joseph Jackson, August 19, 1958, in Gary, IN; son of Joseph (a crane operator) and Katherine (a homemaker and sales clerk; maiden name, Corse) Jackson.

The singer had matured into a dynamic adult entertainer, but he also began to make his mark as a songwriter, crafting durable pop that synthesized rock and disco.\n\nJackson’s next album, Thriller, was a quantum leap for him both creatively and commercially. Produced by Jones, the recording spanned a number of pop genres— cannilyenlistingrockguitaridolEddieVanHalentoplay a solo on” Beat It,” for example, guaranteed access to listeners Jackson might not otherwise have reached— and fired numerous singles up the charts, notably the title track, the insinuating “Billie Jean,” and the raucous “Beat It.” The state-of-the-art videos that accompanied these singles, meanwhile, coincided with the sudden dominance of Music Television (MTV); Jackson’s distinctive “Moonwalk” and overall visual panache (combined with brilliant choreography and lavish special effects) won him an even vaster audience. Thrillerwent on to become the best-selling album of all time and garnered 5 Grammy awards; Jackson also snagged a G rammy for his participation in the E. T.: The Extraterrestrial album for children. Jackson was also a crucial player in the all-star benefit project We Are the World, which sought to combat hunger in Africa. In addition to his epochal solo work, he continued working with his brothers as part of The Jacksons; their 1984 “Victory” tour was a landmark of the decade.\n\nAfter Thriller\n\nMichael Jackson ruled the 1980s. Though his album Bad performed less spectacularly than did Thriller, it was a colossal hit by any other standard. He also racked up both music industry awards and honors from the United Negro College Fund, the NAACP, and even the President of the United States. He had his occasional bad moments—his head was burned during the shooting of a commercial for Pepsi cola, for which he had a lucrative endorsement deal, and speculation abounded that he lightened his skin and had plastic surgery to make himself look more “white”—but by and large his image as the world’s most beloved entertainer was undimmed. In 1990 the performance rights organization BMI presented the first Michael Jackson award—to its namesake.\n\nHis sister Janet Jackson announced that she had scored the biggest record deal in history early in 1991. One week later, Michael announced his new Sony contract, which made Janet’s look paltry by comparison. His 1991 release Dangerous, however, did not perform to expectations. Some controversy was generated by the fact that Jackson reportedly only granted his innovative “Black or White” video to MTV on the condition that the network refer to him as the “King of Pop.” A 1993 interview with talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, an unusual step for the press-shy Jackson, helped boost sales. Over time, the album performed impressively; again, only the standards previously set by Jackson himself cast any doubt on its popularity. He was showered in laurels in 1993, including the “Living Legend Award” at the Grammys and, more controversially, the Humanitarian of the Year trophy at the Soul Train Awards.\n\nScandal in “Neverland”\n\nYet Jackson’s reputation as an androgynous recluse who lived in a state of perpetual adolescence—rumors of his life and hobbies at his home, “Neverland,” abounded—only increased. He also earned the scorn of some self-appointed moral guardians when one of his videos showed him smashing a car window and grabbing his crotch more flagrantly than usual; he excised the footage as soon as the eyebrows were raised. Yet no one could have anticipated the charges that rocked the entertainment world in 1993.\n\nA 13-year-old boy, identified only as a “friend” of the singer’s, asserted that Jackson had sexually abused him during his stay at Neverland. Jackson was on tour when the allegations were made public, and he promptly brought the series of performances to a halt, claiming exhaustion and addiction to painkillers. After extensive legal wrangling and much mud-slinging from both the boy’s family and lawyers and Jackson’s defense team, Jackson opted to settle out of court for an estimated $20 million. Though he settled, Jackson denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDespite investigation of a second boy who said he’d slept in the same bed with Jackson—but alleged no improper behavior on the entertainer’s part—the Los Angeles District Attorney brought his investigation to a close in 1994. Jackson’s attorney said this was due to lack of evidence, though others claimed it was the boy’s refusal to testify that weakened the case. Meanwhile, longtime friends of Jackson’s had issued passionate statements in his defense. “I am mortified and disgusted by what has been reported with no evidence of anything untoward,” fumed producer Bruce Swedien, as quoted in Rolling Stone. “Michael is one of the most decent people I ’ve ever met in my life. These allegations are preposterous.” Jackson’s own public statement expressed confidence that he would be fully exonerated. “I am grateful for the overwhelming support of my fans throughoutthe world,” it concluded. “I love you all.”\n\nYet the scandal devastated Jackson and heightened speculation that his career was over. He lost his Pepsi endorsement as well as a deal to develop several films in which he hoped to star. “They just pulled the plug when the scandal broke,” noted director John Landis— who’d helmed the epic “Thriller” video—to Entertainment Weekly. “Stopped it cold.” The rumor-mongering over the alleged molestation continued, as the media and industry insiders played the age-old game of trying to pin down Michael Jackson’s personal life.\n\nIn 1994 Jackson shocked the public again—in a very different way. He and Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of rock innovator and cultural icon Elvis Presley, were married in the Dominican Republic. The unexpected union was the cause of further speculation: had Jackson married to divert attention from his alleged homosexuality and/or pederasty? Was he hoping to save his career by establishing himself as a “normal” and adult man? A very staged kiss at the MTV Video Music Awards added fuel to the fire.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Jackson returned to what he did best—making records. He commenced recording new tracks for an ambitious package that would include his greatest hits along with an album’s worth of new material. He gathered a number of hot songwriters and producers and even recorded a duet with his sister Janet. Epic Records, the branch of Sony that handled his recordings, prepared for a massive media assault. Jackson and Lisa Marie appeared on a television interview with Diane Sawyer; the singer and his bride vehemently insisted that they had a sex life and planned to have children. Naturally, such urgency only encouraged those who felt that their public claims to “normalcy” were career propaganda. Even so, the interview earned astronomical ratings and helped prepare the way for the new album’s marketing blitz. This included the sudden appearance of building-high statues of the performer, one of which is pictured on the cover of the disc.\n\nWhen HIStory was released it met with mixed reviews. Writers for the industry trade journal Billboard were divided; columnist J. R. Reynolds felt that it “boasts some of the artist’s best work”—and not just the classic singles—and complained only of the label’s marketing overkill. Yet an unsigned review in the same issue called him “a gifted musical careerist of negligible emotional maturity, and the latter trait increasingly overshadows the former as he struggles to contrive dubious monuments to himself.” Jackson’s over-the-top spectacles, combined with his anguished pleas to be shielded from prying eyes, struck many critics as the ultimate in hypocrisy. Others felt he was all over the stylistic map, lacking the cohesive musical vision he’d shown in the previous decade. Rolling Stone called the 1995 collection an “exhilarating, misconceived, often heartbreaking package. HIStory’s ultimate goal is to position Michael Jackson’s music as a planet, a genre, a law, a marketing budget unto itself.”\n\nMany in the industry wondered if Jackson’s scandals would have a decisive negative impact on sales of the new record, but this appeared not to be a substantial problem. “People don’t give a s—t about something that happened a couple of years ago,” insisted record executive Freddy DeMann to Entertainment Weekly. Any commercial obstacles HIStory faced, it seemed, would have to do with the material itself. “It’s not where music is headed, it’s where music has been,” complained radio station music director Bruce St. James, quoted in Newsweek. The public, despite the media bombast, seemed to agree. The debut single, “Scream”—a raucous duet with Janet that was supported by a flashy science-fiction video—earned only a lukewarm reception, and HIStory dropped out of the top ten after only a few weeks.\n\nYet the record could scarcely be considered a failure, given that it was a double album and promised to issue singles for at least another year. One, the ballad “Childhood,” also appeared on the soundtrack of the family film Free Willy 2, promising an even wider audience. “There will probably be nine singles,” pronounced Epic executive David Glew to Billboard. “That puts us through two Christmases… I think this will be one of the biggest albums of all time, [but] we know it will take the full weight of this company.” Meanwhile, many fans who didn’t adore the new tracks would likely still invest in the package just to have Jackson’s classic hits in one place.\n\nAnother scandal erupted immediately, however; it involved the presence of apparently anti-Semitic lyrics on the song “They Don’t Care About Us.” Steven Spielberg, superstar filmmaker and stalwart defender of Jackson during his earlier travails, publicly criticized the lyrics, as did many other individuals and groups. Jackson announced that he harbored no prejudice toward anyone, though his remark that “my lawyers are Jewish” scarcely banished all doubt. A smaller ripple came from the revelation that Lisa Marie’s two children from her previous marriage were unhappy living at Neverland. The couple would divorce amicably in 1996.\n\nYet even when beset by rumor and scandal—and such has been his situation for much of his career—Michael Jackson has masterfully translated adversity into greater fame. While many argue that his work has been uneven, his contribution to modern pop has been enormous. Indeed, Jackson redefined stardom for the video era, and popular culture would never be the same.\n\nSelected discography\n\nSingles, with the Jackson 5, on Steeltown Records\n\n“I’m a Big Boy Now,” c. 1967.\n\n“You’ve Changed” c. 1967.\n\n“We Don’t Have to Be Over 21 (to Fall in Love),” c. 1968.\n\n“Jam Session,” c. 1968.\n\nWith the Jackson 5, on Motown\n\nDiana Ross Presents the Jackson 5, 1969.\n\nABC, 1970.\n\nThird Album, 1970.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Christmas Album, 1970.\n\nMaybe Tomorro w, 1971.\n\nGoin’ Back to Indiana, 1971.\n\nThe Jackson 5’s Greatest Hits, 1971.\n\nLooking Through the Windows, 1972.\n\nSkywriter, 1973.\n\nGet It Together, 1973.\n\nDancing Machine, 1974.\n\nMoving Violation, 1975.\n\nJoyful Jukebox Music, 1976.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Anthology, 1976.\n\nBoogie, Natural Resources/Motown, 1980.\n\nFarewell, My Summer Love (recorded 1973; previously unre-leased), 1984.\n\nWith The Jacksons, on Epic\n\nThe Jacksons, 1976.\n\nGoin’ Places, 1977.\n\nDestiny 1978.\n\nTriumph, 1980.\n\nThe Jacksons Live, 1981.\n\nVictory, 1984.\n\nSolo\n\nGot to Be There, Motown, 1972.\n\nBen, Motown, 1972.\n\nMusic and Me, Motown, 1973.\n\nForever, Michael, Motown, 1975.\n\nThe Best of Michael Jackson, Motown, 1975.\n\nOff the Wall (includes “Rock With You” and “Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough”), Epic, 1979.\n\nThriller (includes “Thriller,” “Beat It,” and “Billie Jean”), Epic, 1982.\n\nBad, Epic, 1987.\n\nDangerous (includes “Black or White”), Epic, 1991.\n\nHistory: Past, Present, and Future, Book/ (includes “Scream,” “Childhood,” and “They Don’t Care About Us”), Epic, 1995.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nRees, Dafydd, and Luke Crampton, Rock Movers&Shakers, Billboard, 1991.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, May 20, 1995, pp. 1, 13-14; July 1, 1995, p. 25.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, June 16, 1995, p. 24; July 28, 1995, p. 16.\n\nLos Angeles Times Calendar, July 2, 1995, p. 58.\n\nNewsweek, November 29, 1993, p. 70; June 5, 1995, p. 75.\n\nRolling Stone, April 1, 1993, p. 17; October 14, 1993, p. 21; June 15, 1995, p. 24; August 10, 1995, p. 55.\n\nTime, June 19, 1995.\n\n—Simon Glickman\n\nMichael Jackson 1958–\n\nVocalist, songwriter, businessman\n\nBecame a Motown Topseller\n\nNew Independence in Career\n\nStrong Sales Throughout the 1980s\n\nBecame a Sought After Recluse\n\nMarried Lisa Marie Presley\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nA powerfully creative and disciplined artist, Michael Jackson is a distinctive vocalist, an imaginative and original songwriter with a gift for turning his own experiences into powerful lyrics, and a dancer almost without peer. Keeping control over his own career, he ruled pop and rhythm-and-blues music charts throughout the 1980s. Jackson’s private life was just as fascinating as his music and dance moves.\n\nThe lead singer of the beloved family group the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson was in his early twenties when Thriller catapulted him into the ranks of the rich and famous. He has never matched the success of Thriller, and in the 1990s his career suffered serious reversals, the most damaging of which may have been the accusations of child abuse leveled against the singer in 1993. By the late 1990s, the star of the self-proclaimed “King of Pop” seemed to have dimmed. But no one who remembered the explosion of his talent during the previous decade could doubt either his overall impact as a performer or his ability to once again seize the limelight.\n\nJackson was born on August 29, 1958 in the steel-manufacturing center of Gary, Indiana, outside of Chicago. His father Joseph had played guitar in a local group called the Falcons; his mother Katherine was a country music enthusiast who instilled in her eight children a love of singing. Joseph, a very demanding and rumored—by his children—to be an abusive man, aimed to turn his five male children—Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael—into musical stars, and by 1964, before Michael’s sixth birthday, had formed them into the Jackson 5. The group played in local arenas and travelled throughout the Midwest performing before they wre noticed. Attracting the attention of hit singer Gladys Knight and pianist Bobby Taylor—not Diana Ross as some have claimed—the Jackson 5 were signed in 1968 to the Motown label, whose roster of youthful black acts had reliably been generating hits for several years.\n\nBecame a Motown Topseller\n\nMichael’s exuberant vocals defined such catchy Jackson 5 hits as “I Want You Back,” “The Love You Save,” “ABC,” and “I’ll Be There,” all of which hit Number One in 1970. He released three albums for Motown as a solo\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn Michael Joseph Jackson August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana; son of Joseph (a heavy equipment operator and part-time musician) and Katherine (a sales clerk, maiden name Scruse) Jackson. Married Lisa Marie Presley, 1994 (divorced 1996); married Debbie Rowe, 1996; two children, Prince Michael Jackson Jr. and Paris Michael Katherine. Religion: Raised as a Jehovah’s Witness.\n\nCareer: Performing and recording artist, 1963–.

With Michael as lead vocalist and choreographer, the group toured extensively, giving audiences electrified shows that made the Jackson 5 more popular with each new show. Joseph Jackson and label founder, Berry Gordy, Jr., never saw eye to eye. Joseph always believed his sons could produce and write, but were limited by Motown’s management. The Jacksons left Motown after a dispute over artistic control and signed with CBS’s Epic label in 1976.\n\nMotown sued and the Jackson 5 lost its name. The brothers (minus Jermaine, who opted to stay with Motown), now known as The Jacksons—added to the group was youngest brother, Randy—went on to be successful on the Epic label with such hits as “Blame It On The Boogie,” “Shake Your Body,” and “Heartbreak Hotel,” all of which were written by various Jackson brothers.\n\nAs the Jackson 5, the brothers appeared in their first TV special, “Goin’ Back to Indiana,” an ABC network presentation that also starred comedians Bill Cosby and Tom Smothers. ABC also aired a Saturday morning animated series “The Jackson Five” which featured the Jacksons’ singing voices. As The Jacksons, they performed in Las Vegas with their sisters Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet. Incidentally, Janet in the 1990s would eclipse Michael in popularity.\n\nNew Independence in Career\n\nMichael sought to carve out a career independent of his siblings’. Though he made solo albums as a child on the Motown label, it was on Epic that Michael became a superstar in his own right. He played the Scarecrow in the 1978 film The Wiz (opposite longtime friend Diana Ross in the role of Dorothy), and during the making of the film met music executive and producer Quincy Jones.\n\nJones would become one of the architects of Jackson’s grand successes, creating a light, sophisticated production style that effectively showcased Jackson’s quiet yet intensely dramatic vocals. A musical eclectic since his jazz days in the early 1960s, Jones also encouraged Jackson to experiment with novel stylistic fusions. The first fruit of their efforts was Jackson’s 1979 release Off the Wall, which mixed disco and ballad elements and spawned four Top Ten singles.\n\nJones also produced Thriller, the long-awaited followup to Off the Wall. After the release of the mild novelty song “The Girl Is Mine” (a duet with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney) as the first single, the album’s sales built slowly. But with subsequent single releases Jackson emerged spectacularly as a personality who could appeal to diverse audiences like no one else in American music had been able to for years. “Beat It,” featuring rock guitarist Eddie Van Halen, crossed over to attain popularity even among fans of heavy metal music; “Billie Jean” drew on Jackson’s own experience of unjust paternity accusations. Both songs reached number one, and “Billie Jean” made him the first artist to be number one on the pop single, pop album, R & B single, and R & B album charts simultaneously. Thriller went on to generate an unprecedented total of seven Top Ten singles. The album roosted atop Billboard magazine’s sales charts for thirty-seven weeks, and at its peak was reported to be selling more than 500,000 copies every week.\n\nStrong Sales Throughout the 1980s\n\nIn 1985 Jackson co-wrote the international famine-relief single “We Are the World,” one of the biggest-selling singles of all time. It seemed that everything Jackson touched turned to gold or platinum. His videos for the Thriller album helped to put the Music Television Channel, or MTV for short, on the map. His videos also showcased his dance moves that was still being imitated well into the 1990s. His most famous move, the Moonwalk, became a dance craze. Jackson first displayed the Moonwalk in his video for his song, “Billie Jean.” He also began wearing one glove that was covered with rhinestones. He was asked by Barbara Walters on the television show “20/20” why he wore one glove, Jackson replied, “Cooler than two.” Glove aside, many were impressed with Jackson’s style and moves. Jane Fonda in Time magazine, described his music as “A fresh, original sound. The music is energetic, and it’s sensual. You can dance to it, work out to it, make love to it, sing to it. It’s hard to sit still to.”\n\nJackson could also count as fans of his dancing, such pros as Bob Fosse, Gene Kelly, and Fred Astaire, who was quoted in Time as saying, “My Lord, he is a wonderful mover. He makes these moves up himself and it is just great to watch.… I don’t know much more dancing he will take up, because singing and dancing at the same time is very difficult. But Michael is a dedicated artist.”\n\nJackson reunited with his brothers, including Jermaine, for a “Motown 25” television special. Afterward, the Jacksons released another album, titled Victory, and then went on tour. Pepsi, who had signed Michael to a lucrative contract, decided to make a commercial with all the brothers performing. During production, an accident occurred and Michael’s hair and scalp was badly burned, but he fully recovered. The tour was his swan song exit. After the end of the tour, Michael left the group and soon afterward, they disbanded.\n\nHis next album release, 1987’s Bad, sold 22 million copies internationally, a disappointment only by the lofty standard Thriller had established. Bad included five number one singles: “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You,” “Bad,” “The Way You Make Me Feel,” Man in the Mirror,” and “Dirty Diana.” Dangerous, released in 1991 with new producer Teddy Riley at the helm, likewise topped 20 million in total sales. Dangerous produced “Remember The Time,” that won R & B’s best single at the Grammys. The album also featured kid rap duo Kriss Kross, rapper Heavy D, and Princess Stephanie of Monaco.\n\nJackson continued to produce videos. As his popularity grew, he was able to premiere each video during primetime television and MTV. Most videos were short form, that is, lasting the length of the songs, but some were long form which included dialogue, and some were mini-movies.\n\nHis song, “Thriller,” began the tradition, and the video, “The Making of Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller’” garnered sales in the millions. Most notable among the long form videos were “Bad”—which also starred an unknown actor by the name of Wesley Snipes—“Black or White,” which featured Macauley Culkin of Home Alone fame, and the infamous crotch-grabbing dance routine, and also “Remember The Time,” with comedian Eddie Murphy, basketball great Magic Johnson, and supermodel Iman. “Remember The Time” also featured Jackson’s first on-screen romantic kiss and one of the best choreographed dance routines of the 1990s.\n\nJackson’s songs, “Smooth Criminal” and “Leave Me Alone,” were featured in his film, Moonwalker. His other film, Captain Eo, was shown at Disneyworld and Disneyland theme parks. Although he was not given credit, Michael Jackson’s voice appeared on the animated television series, “The Simpsons.”\n\nBecame a Sought After Recluse\n\nIn the years following the release of Thriller, Jackson found himself subject to the isolation that artists in the top echelon of fame inevitably experience. A devout Jehovah’s Witness, he adopted a disguise and went door to door to promote the religion shortly after the album was released. But the pressures of stardom eventually made it impractical for him to continue his religious activities, and he renounced his membership in the sect in 1987 after his video, “Thriller,” was condemned by the group. A public perception of Jackson as a curious recluse began to take shape about this time. He was a constant subject of stories in the nation’s tabloid press. Some—such as the story that he slept in a levitating “hyperbaric chamber” for the purpose of extending his life span—were planted by Jackson’s own operatives as a way of garnering publicity. Jackson’s skin seemed to become progressively lighter, leading to rumors that he was bleaching his skin in order to appear white.\n\nJackson countered this rumor in a February 1993 interview with television talk show host Oprah Winfrey, claiming that he suffered from vitiligo, a skin disease. But public unease with the star increased markedly as a result of much more serious allegations that surfaced in August of that year. Jackson was accused of sexually molesting a thirteen-year-old boy at his Encino, California compound, called Neverland. The singer had long enjoyed surrounding himself with children; in September, his sister La Toya claimed that he had sometimes spent nights together with them in his bedroom. Jackson strongly denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that he was the victim of an extortion plot on the part of the father of the thirteen-year-old. The case was settled privately for an undisclosed sum in January of 1994, and charges were dropped, but it cost Jackson a lucrative endorsement contract with Pepsi-Cola. He has continued to deny the charges.\n\nMarried Lisa Marie Presley\n\nJackson’s musical successes since the time of these allegations have been sporadic, but his personal life has continued to provide surprises. In August of 1994 it was revealed that Jackson had married Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of legendary rock and roll innovator and pop megastar Elvis Presley, ten weeks earlier in a ceremony in the Dominican Republic. The couple was amicably divorced in January of 1996; in November of that year, Jackson married Debbie Rowe, a nurse who had reportedly been artificially inseminated and was pregnant with the singer’s child. A son, Prince Michael Jackson Jr., was born in early 1997, and the couple, who often do not reside together, were graced with the birth of a daughter, Paris Michael Katherine, in April of 1998.\n\nDespite a $30 million marketing campaign, Jackson’s 1995 release HIStory: Past, Present, and Future Book I fell short of expectations with its sales of two million units domestically, twelve million internationally; controversies over the songs “Scream” and “They Don’t Care About Us” (the latter contained an allegedly anti-Semitic lyric reference for which Jackson later apologized) and an award for song “You Are Not Alone,” did not keep the album from dropping out of the U.S. Top Ten within weeks of its release. A 1997 album, Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, fared even worse, with little marketing and domestic sales in the hundreds of thousands; it consisted largely of remixes by various hit producers of songs from the 1995 HIStory release. Jackson seemed to be attempting to update his style to fit with the technology-driven musical trends of the 1990s.\n\nDuring the late 1990s the singer was occupied with grandiose schemes to build entertainment complexes in such diverse locales as Poland, South Korea, Paris, and Detroit, where he joined with gambling magnate Don Barden to push for a proposed casino and amusement park. This effort fell through in Detroit, when the people voted no on their proposal to allow the two to bid for a casino license in August of 1998. His charitable foundation Heal the World was reported by People magazine to be cutting back on donations as Jackson’s total income dropped from an estimated $65 million in 1989 to $20 million in 1997.\n\nThat has not stopped Jackson, though. Plans for an upcoming album release and tour are in the works. Michael will reunite with his brothers for another album to be released on his record label, MJJ Music, as well as tour as a group. Michael Jackson himself sums up his 35-year career in his 1993 Grammy Legend Award acceptance speech: “My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, there was no birthdays, it was not a normal childhood, nor the normal pleasures of childhood.…But as an awful price, I cannot re-create that part of my life. However, today, when I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature. I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents.” Millions of fans, young and old, black or white, are happy Michael Jackson chose to share those talents with the world.\n\nSelected discography\n\n(as solo performer)\n\nGot to Be There, Motown, 1972.\n\nBen, Motown, 1972.\n\nMusic and Me, Motown, 1973.\n\nForever, Michael, Motown, 1975.\n\nThe Best of Michael Jackson, Motown, 1975.\n\nOff the Wall, Epic, 1979.\n\nThriller, Epic, 1982.\n\nBad, Epic, 1987.\n\nDangerous, Epic, 1991.\n\nHIStory: Past, Present, and Future Book I, Epic, 1995.\n\nBlood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, Epic, 1997.\n\n(with the Jackson 5, on Motown)\n\nDiana Ross Presents the Jackson 5, 1969.\n\nABC, 1970.\n\nThird Album, 1970.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Christmas Album, 1970.\n\nMaybe Tomorrow, 1971.\n\nGoin’ Back to Indiana, 1971.\n\nThe Jackson 5’s Greatest Hits, 1971.\n\nLooking Through the Windows, 1972.\n\nSkywriter, 1973.\n\nGet It Together, 1973.\n\nDancing Machine, 1974.\n\nMoving Violation, 1975.\n\nJoyful Jukebox Music, 1976.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Anthology, 1976.\n\nBoogie, 1980.\n\nFarewell My Summer Love, 1984 (recorded 1973, previously unreleased).\n\n(with the Jacksons, on Epic)\n\nThe Jacksons, 1976.\n\nGoin’Places, 1977.\n\nDestiny, 1978.\n\nTriumph, 1980.\n\nThe Jacksons Live, 1981.\n\nVictory, 1984.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nJackson, Michael, Moonwalk, Doubleday, 1988.\n\nRomanowski, Patricia, and Holly George-Warren, eds., The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, Fireside, 1995.\n\nTaraborrelli, J.

Vocalist with the Jackson 5, 1963-76; group signed with Motown Records, 1969; signed as solo artist with Motown, 1972-.\n\nAwards: Numerous Grammy awards for Thriller, including album of the year, record of the year, best male rock vocal performance for \"Beat It\", and best new R&B song for \"Billie Jean\"; Song of the Year for \"We Are the World,\" 1986; special humanitarian award from President Ronald Reagan, 1984; American Music Awards, Special Award of Achievement, 1989; World Music Awards for Best-Selling American Artist, World's Best-Selling Pop Artist, and World's best-Selling Artist of the Era, 1993; Grammy Award, Living Legend Award, 1993; Best R & B Single for \"Remember The Time,\" 1993; Bambi Award, for Pop Artist of the Millennium, 2002.\n\nAddresses: Web—http://mjjsource.com.\n\nIn 1985 Jackson co-wrote the international famine-relief single \"We Are the World,\" one of the biggest-selling singles of all time. It seemed that everything Jackson touched turned to gold or platinum. His videos for the Thriller album helped to put the Music Television Channel, or MTV for short, on the map. His videos also showcased his dance moves that were still being imitated well into the 1990s. His most famous move, the Moonwalk, became a dance craze. Jackson first displayed the Moonwalk in his video for his song, \"Billie Jean.\" He also began wearing one glove that was covered with rhinestones. He was asked by Barbara Walters on the television show 20/20 why he wore one glove, Jackson replied, \"Cooler than two.\" Glove aside, many were impressed with Jackson's style and moves. Jane Fonda in Time magazine, described his music as \"A fresh, original sound. The music is energetic, and it's sensual. You can dance to it, work out to it, make love to it, sing to it. It's hard to sit still to.\"\n\nJackson could also count as fans of his dancing, such pros as Bob Fosse, Gene Kelly, and Fred Astaire, who was quoted in Time as saying, \"My Lord, he is a wonderful mover. He makes these moves up himself and it is just great to watch…. I don't know much more dancing he will take up, because singing and dancing at the same time is very difficult. But Michael is a dedicated artist.\"\n\nJackson reunited with his brothers, including Jermaine, for a Motown 25 television special in 1983. Afterward, the Jacksons released another album, titled Victory, and then went on tour. Pepsi, who had signed Michael to a lucrative contract, decided to make a commercial with all the brothers performing. During production, an accident occurred and Michael's hair and scalp was badly burned, but he fully recovered. The tour was his swan song exit. After the end of the tour, Michael left the group and soon afterward, they disbanded.\n\nGrowing Popularity\n\nHis next album release, 1987's Bad, sold 22 million copies internationally, a disappointment only by the lofty standard Thriller had established. Bad included five number one singles: \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You,\" \"Bad,\" \"The Way You Make Me Feel,\" \"Man in the Mirror,\" and \"Dirty Diana.\" Dangerous, released in 1991 with new producer Teddy Riley at the helm, likewise topped 20 million in total sales. Dangerous produced \"Remember The Time,\" that won R & B's best single at the Grammys. The album also featured kid rap duo Kriss Kross, rapper Heavy D, and Princess Stephanie of Monaco.\n\nJackson continued to produce videos. As his popularity grew, he was able to premiere each video during primetime television and MTV. Most videos were short form, that is, lasting the length of the songs, but some were long form, which included dialogue, and some were mini-movies.\n\nHis song \"Thriller\" began the tradition, and the video The Making of Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' garnered sales in the millions. Most notable among the long form videos were \"Bad\"—which also starred an unknown actor by the name of Wesley Snipes—\"Black or White,\" which featured Macauley Culkin of Home Alone fame, and the infamous crotch-grabbing dance routine, and also \"Remember The Time,\" with comedian Eddie Murphy, basketball great Magic Johnson, and supermodel Iman. \"Remember The Time\" also featured Jackson's first on-screen romantic kiss and one of the best choreographed dance routines of the 1990s.\n\nJackson's songs \"Smooth Criminal\" and \"Leave Me Alone\" were featured in his film, Moonwalker. His other film, Captain Eo, was shown at Disneyworld and Disneyland theme parks. Although he was not given credit, Michael Jackson's voice appeared on the animated television series The Simpsons.\n\nPersonal Life Scrutinized\n\nIn the years following the release of Thriller, Jackson found himself subject to the isolation that artists in the top echelon of fame inevitably experience. A devout Jehovah's Witness, he adopted a disguise and went door to door to promote the religion shortly after the album was released. But the pressures of stardom eventually made it impractical for him to continue his religious activities, and he renounced his membership in the sect in 1987 after his video \"Thriller\" was condemned by the group. A public perception of Jackson as a curious recluse began to take shape about this time. He was a constant subject of stories in the nation's tabloid press. Some—such as the story that he slept in a levitating \"hyperbaric chamber\" for the purpose of extending his life span—were planted by Jackson's own operatives as a way of garnering publicity. Jackson's skin seemed to become progressively lighter, leading to rumors that he was bleaching his skin in order to appear white.\n\nJackson countered this rumor in a February 1993 interview with television talk show host Oprah Winfrey, claiming that he suffered from vitiligo, a skin disease. But public unease with the star increased markedly as a result of much more serious allegations that surfaced in August of that year. Jackson was accused of sexually molesting a thirteen-year-old boy at his Encino, California, compound, called Neverland. The singer had long enjoyed surrounding himself with children; in September, his sister La Toya claimed that he had sometimes spent nights together with them in his bedroom. Jackson strongly denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that he was the victim of an extortion plot on the part of the father of the thirteen-year-old. The case was settled privately for an undisclosed sum in January of 1994, and charges were dropped, but it cost Jackson a lucrative endorsement contract with Pepsi-Cola. He has continued to deny the charges.\n\nJackson's musical successes since the time of these allegations have been sporadic, but his personal life continued to provide surprises. In August of 1994 it was revealed that Jackson had married Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of legendary rock and roll innovator and pop megastar Elvis Presley, ten weeks earlier in a ceremony in the Dominican Republic. The couple was amicably divorced in January of 1996; in November of that year, Jackson married Debbie Rowe, a nurse who had reportedly been artificially inseminated and was pregnant with the singer's child. A son, Prince Michael Jackson Jr., was born in early 1997, and the couple was graced with the birth of a daughter, Paris Michael Katherine, in April of 1998. The couple divorced in 1999, with Jackson receiving full custody of the children in the settlement. Jackson soon added another son, Prince Michael II, with an unknown woman.\n\nJackson's public outings with his children were eagerly followed by the press. Jackson covered his children's heads with cloth in public as a precaution against kidnapping, according to Jet. In 2002 Jackson brought on public scorn for holding his infant son over the edge of a fourth-floor balcony to show fans. Soon after, Jackson released a statement saying \"I made a terrible mistake. I got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I would never intentionally endanger the lives of my children,\" as quoted in Jet.\n\nStruggled to Stay on Top\n\nDespite a $30 million marketing campaign, Jackson's 1995 release HIStory: Past, Present, and Future Book I fell short of expectations with its sales of two million units domestically, twelve million internationally; controversies over the songs \"Scream\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\" (the latter contained an allegedly anti-Semitic lyric reference for which Jackson later apologized) and an award for song \"You Are Not Alone,\" did not keep the album from dropping out of the U.S. Top Ten within weeks of its release. A 1997 album, Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, fared even worse, with little marketing and domestic sales in the hundreds of thousands; it consisted largely of remixes by various hit producers of songs from the 1995 HIStory release. Jackson seemed to be attempting to update his style to fit with the technology-driven musical trends of the 1990s.\n\nDuring the late 1990s the singer was occupied with grandiose schemes to build entertainment complexes in such diverse locales as Poland, South Korea, Paris, and Detroit, where he joined with gambling magnate Don Barden to push for a proposed casino and amusement park. This effort fell through in Detroit, when the people voted no on their proposal to allow the two to bid for a casino license in August of 1998. His charitable foundation Heal the World was reported by People magazine to be cutting back on donations as Jackson's total income dropped from an estimated $65 million in 1989 to $20 million in 1997.\n\nJackson continued to release records on Epic in the early 2000s, including Invincible in 2001 and Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection in 2003. While Invincible cost $30 million to make, it only sold six million copies worldwide by mid-2002. Though the record label spent $25 million to promote the record, Jackson believed they did not provide support in promoting the record and were trying to sabotage his career. As Jackson's musical career continued to become more irrelevant, his income also fell further. In the early 2000s, it was reported that he heavily borrowed against his assets to maintain his lifestyle.\n\nAlleged Molestation Goes to Trial\n\nIn February of 2003, an unflattering television documentary by British journalist Martin Bashir called Living with Michael Jackson was broadcast. In the program, Jackson defended as \"loving\" his practice of letting young boys sleep in his bed. In November of 2003, California authorities searched Jackson's Neverland Ranch, following allegations that he molested a young boy who had visited the Neverland Ranch and spent the night there several times. Jackson was booked on child-molestation charges that month and released on $3 million bail. Formal charges against Jackson were filed in December 2003. A grand jury indicted the 46-year-old pop star in April 2004 on charges of molesting the boy at the center of the trial, giving him alcohol and conspiring to hold him and his family captive in 2003. The case remained in the public eye through 2004, with both sides allegedly leaking information. Because of the leaks and related issues, the judge issued a gag order for both sides. This order did not prevent some of the grand jury testimony of the young victim from being released shortly before the trial was to begin.\n\nJury selection began on January 31, 2005, and Jackson's trial started at the end of February. According to CNN.com, testimony and closing arguments lasted nearly 14 weeks before the jury got the case. \"Prosecutors alleged that, following the broadcast of the Bashir documentary in 2003, Jackson and five associates plotted to control and intimidate the accuser's family to get them to go along with damage-control efforts, including holding them against their will at Neverland. The molestation charges relate to alleged incidents between Jackson and the accuser after the Bashir documentary aired. Jackson's lawyers, however, consistently portrayed the singer as a naive victim of the accuser's family, who, they claimed, were grifters—schemers—with a habit of wheedling money out of the rich and famous,\" CNN.com summed up. On June 13, 2005, the jury exonerated Jackson of all ten charges against him. If he had been convicted, he could have been sent to prison for nearly 20 years. As Jackson recuperated at his Neverland home, his fans wondered what the future would hold for him.\n\nMichael Jackson described the importance of his music career to his personal life in his 1993 Grammy Living Legend Award acceptance speech: \"My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, there was no birthdays, it was not a normal childhood, nor the normal pleasures of childhood…. But as an awful price, I can not re-create that part of my life. However, today, when I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature. I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents.\" Millions of fans, young and old, black or white, are happy Michael Jackson chose to share those talents with the world. And after Jackson's trial, Michael Sands, a Hollywood media publicist related to People that Jackson's future still held promise. \"He's still an icon, and his fans worldwide love him.\" Jackson seemed to agree, as he still referred to himself as the King of Pop.\n\nSelected works\n\nAlbums, solo\n\nGot to Be There, Motown, 1972.\n\nBen, Motown, 1972.\n\nMusic and Me, Motown, 1973.\n\nForever, Michael, Motown, 1975.\n\nThe Best of Michael Jackson, Motown, 1975.\n\nOff the Wall, Epic, 1979.\n\nThriller, Epic, 1982.\n\nBad, Epic, 1987.\n\nDangerous, Epic, 1991.\n\nHIStory: Past, Present, and Future Book I, Epic, 1995.\n\nBlood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, Epic, 1997.\n\nInvincible, Epic, 2001.\n\nMichael Jackson: The Complete Collection, Epic, 2004.\n\nAlbums, with the Jackson 5\n\nDiana Ross Presents the Jackson 5, Motown, 1969.\n\nABC, Motown, 1970.\n\nThird Album, Motown, 1970.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Christmas Album, Motown, 1970.\n\nMaybe Tomorrow, Motown, 1971.\n\nGoin' Back to Indiana, Motown, 1971.\n\nThe Jackson 5's Greatest Hits, Motown, 1971.\n\nLooking Through the Windows, Motown, 1972.\n\nSkywriter, Motown, 1973.\n\nGet It Together, Motown, 1973.\n\nDancing Machine, Motown, 1974.\n\nMoving Violation, Motown, 1975.\n\nJoyful Jukebox Music, Motown, 1976.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Anthology, Motown, 1976.\n\nThe Jacksons, Epic, 1976.\n\nGoin' Places, Epic, 1977.\n\nDestiny, Epic, 1978.\n\nOff the Wall, Epic, 1979.\n\nBoogie, Motown, 1980.\n\nTriumph, Epic, 1980.\n\nThe Jacksons Live, Epic, 1981.\n\nFarewell My Summer Love, Motown, 1984 (recorded 1973, previously unreleased).\n\nVictory, Epic, 1984.\n\nBooks\n\nMoonwalk, Doubleday, 1988.\n\nFilms\n\nThe Wiz, 1978.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nChandler, Raymond, All that Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up, Windsong Press, 2004.\n\nJackson, Michael, Moonwalk, Doubleday, 1988.\n\nJones, Bob, as told to Stacy Brown, Michael Jackson, The Man behind the Mask: An Insider's Story of the King of Pop, SelectBooks, 2005.\n\nLewis, Jel D., and Michael Jackson, comp., The King of Pop: The Big Picture: The Music!

Keeping control over his own career, he ruled pop and R&B music charts throughout the 1980s. However, beginning in the 1990s and continuing into the new millenium, Jackson’s erratic behavior overshadowed his music, and his private life made more headlines than his music did during that time.\n\nPreviously the lead singer of the beloved family group the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson was in his early twenties when Thriller catapulted him into the ranks of the rich and famous. He has never matched the success of Thriller, and in the 1990s and early 2000s, his career suffered serious reversals, the most damaging of which may have been the accusations of child abuse leveled against the singer in 1993. By 2000, the star of the self-proclaimed “King of Pop” seemed to have dimmed. But no one who remembered the explosion of his talent during the previous decade could doubt either his overall impact as a performer or his ability to once again seize the limelight.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Was Born\n\nJackson was born on August 29, 1958, in the steel-manufacturing center of Gary, Indiana. His father Joseph had played guitar in a local group called the Falcons; his mother Katherine was a country music enthusiast who instilled in her eight children a love of singing. Joseph, very demanding and rumored—by his children—to be an abusive man, aimed to turn his five male children—Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael—into musical stars, and by 1964, before Michael’s sixth birthday, had formed them into the Jackson 5. The group played in local arenas and travelled throughout the Midwest performing before they were noticed. Attracting the attention of hit singer Gladys Knight and pianist Bobby Taylor—not Diana Ross as some have claimed—the Jackson 5 were signed in 1968 to the Motown label, whose roster of youthful black acts had reliably been generating hits for several years.\n\nMichael’s exuberant vocals defined such catchy Jackson 5 hits as “ABC” and “I’ll Be There,” both of which hit number one on the charts in 1970. He released three albums for Motown as a solo artist, with singles such as “Ben,” “Rockin’ Robin,” and “Got to Be There” reaching top chart levels. With Michael as lead vocalist and choreographer, the group toured extensively, giving audiences electrified shows that made the Jackson 5 more popular with each new show. Joseph Jackson and label founder, Berry Gordy, Jr., never saw eye to eye. Joseph always believed his sons could produce and write, but were limited by Motown’s management. The Jacksons left Motown after a dispute over artistic control and signed with CBS’s Epic label in 1976.\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn Michael Joseph Jackson on August 19, 1958, in Gary, IN; son of Joseph and Katherine Jackson; married Lisa Marie Presley (a singer), 1994; divorced, 1996; married Debbie Rowe (a nurse), 1996; divorced, 1999; children: Prince Michael I., Paris Michael Katherine, Prince Michael II.\n\nVocalist with the Jackson 5, 1963-76; signed as solo artist with Motown, releasing debut album Got to Be There, 1972; appeared in film The Wiz, 1978; released Epic Records debut Off the Wall, 1979; released Thriller, one of the best-selling albums of all time, 1982; released Bad, 1987; established Heal the World Foundation, 1989; released Dangerous, 1991; released H/S- tory, 1995; released Blood on the Dance Floor, 1997; released Invincible, 2001.\n\nAwards: Grammy Awards, Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for “Don’t Stop ’til You Get Enough,” 1979; Best Children’s Recording for “E.T.

Website— Michael Jackson Official Website: http://www.michaeljackson.com.\n\nMotown sued and the Jackson 5 lost its name. Michael filed a lawsuit in 2003 to regain the rights to the “Jackson 5” name, as well as millions in unpaid royalties he claimed he was owed, but the case was thrown out in court. After leaving Motown, the brothers (minus Jer-maine, who opted to stay with Motown), now known as The Jacksons, went on to be successful on the Epic label with such hits as “Blame It On The Boogie,” “Shake Your Body,” and “Heartbreak Hotel,” all of which were written by various Jackson brothers.\n\nSolo Stardom\n\nMichael sought to carve out a career independent of his siblings. Though he made solo albums as a child on the Motown label, it was on Epic that Michael became a superstar in his own right. He played the Scarecrow in the 1978 film The Wiz (opposite longtime friend Diana Ross in the role of Dorothy), and during the making of the film met music executive and producer Quincy Jones.\n\nJones would become one of the architects of Jackson’s grand successes, creating a light, sophisticated production style that effectively showcased Jackson’s quiet yet intensely dramatic vocals. A musical eclectic since his jazz days in the early 1960s, Jones also encouraged Jackson to experiment with novel stylistic fusions. The first fruit of their efforts was Jackson’s 1979 release Off the Wall, which mixed disco and ballad elements and spawned four top ten singles.\n\nEmergence of a Pop Icon\n\nJones also produced Thriller, the long-awaited follow-up to Off the Wall. After the release of “The Girl Is Mine” (a duet with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney) as the first single, the album’s sales built slowly. But with subsequent singles, Jackson emerged spectacularly as a personality who could appeal to diverse audiences like no one else in American music had been able to for years. “Beat It,” featuring rock guitarist Eddie Van Halen, crossed over to attain popularity even among fans of heavy metal music; “Billie Jean” drew on Jackson’s own experience of unjust paternity accusations. Both songs reached number one, and “Billie Jean” made him the first artist to be number one on the pop single, pop album, R&B single, and R&B album charts simultaneously. Thriller went on to generate an unprecedented total of seven top ten singles. The album roosted atop Billboard magazine’s sales charts for 37 weeks, and at its peak was reported to be selling more than 500,000 copies every week.\n\nIn 1985 Jackson co-wrote the international famine-relief single “We Are the World,” one of the biggest-selling singles of all time. For a time, it seemed that everything Jackson touched turned to gold or platinum. His videos for the Thriller album helped to put the fledgling music video network MTV on the map. His videos also showcased his dance moves that were still being imitated well into the 1990s. His most famous move, the Moonwalk, became a dance craze. Jackson first displayed the Moonwalk in his video for his song, “Billie Jean.” Jane Fonda in Time magazine, described his music as “A fresh, original sound. The music is energetic, and it’s sensual. You can dance to it, work out to it, make love to it, sing to it. It’s hard to sit still to.”\n\nJackson could also count as fans of his dancing, such pros as Bob Fosse, Gene Kelly, and Fred Astaire. Astaire was quoted in Time as saying, “My Lord, he is a wonderful mover. He makes these moves up himself and it is just great to watch . I don’t know much more dancing he will take up, because singing and dancing at the same time is very difficult. But Michael is a dedicated artist.”\n\nHis next album release, 1987’s Bad, sold 22 million copies worldwide, a disappointment only by the lofty standard Thriller had established. Bad included five number one singles, including “Bad” and “The Way You Make Me Feel.” Dangerous, released in 1991 with new producer Teddy Riley at the helm, likewise topped 20 million in total sales. Dangerous produced “Remember The Time,” that won R&B’s Best Single at the Grammys. The album also featured kid rap duo Kris Kross, rapper Heavy D, and Princess Stephanie of Monaco.\n\nIn the years following the release of Thriller, Jackson found himself subject to the isolation that artists in the top echelon of fame inevitably experience. A devout Jehovah’s Witness, he adopted a disguise and went door to door to promote the religion shortly after the album was released. But the pressures of stardom eventually made it impractical for him to continue his religious activities, and he renounced his membership in the sect in 1987 after his video “Thriller” was condemned by the group. A public perception of Jackson as a curious recluse began to take shape about this time. He was a constant subject of stories in the nation’s tabloid press. Some—such as the story that he slept in a levitating “hyperbaric chamber” for the purpose of extending his life span—were planted by Jackson’s own operatives as a way of garnering publicity. Jackson’s skin seemed to become progressively lighter, leading to rumors that he was bleaching his skin in order to appear whiter.\n\nRocked by Scandal\n\nJackson countered this rumor in a February of 1993 interview with television talk show host Oprah Winfrey, claiming that he suffered from vitiligo, a rare skin disease. But public unease with the star increased markedly as a result of much more serious allegations that surfaced in August of that year. Jackson was accused of sexually molesting a thirteen-year-old boy at his Encino, California, compound, called Neverland.\n\nThe singer had long enjoyed surrounding himself with children; in September, his sister La Toya claimed that he had sometimes spent nights together with young children in his bedroom. Jackson strongly denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that he was the victim of an extortion plot on the part of the father of the thirteen-year-old. The case was settled privately for a sum of nearly $20 million in January of 1994, and charges were dropped, but it cost Jackson a lucrative endorsement contract with Pepsi-Cola.\n\nA few months after the settlement, the media announced the secret marriage of Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of singer Elvis Presley. The marriage, seen by much of the public as a possible distraction from the still-fresh court publicity, took place on May 26, 1994, in the Dominican Republic. Jackson’s hopes that this would be the start of a life of tranquility were shattered when Presley filed for divorce in January of 1996. In November of the same year, Jackson married Debbie Rowe, his plastic surgeon’s nurse, in Sydney, Australia. Rowe gave birth to their son, Prince Michael Jackson, in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 12, 1997. The couple, who divorced in 1999, were graced with the birth of a daughter, Paris Michael Katherine, in April of 1998. Rowe, who later described the children as “gifts” she gave to Jackson, has no contact with her children. People quoted her as saying, “I had them because I wanted him to be a father . I didn’t do it to be a mother.”\n\nAttempted to Revive Music Career\n\nThough Jackson’s personal life continued to pique the public interest, reception to his music cooled considerably. Despite a $30 million marketing campaign, Jackson’s 1995 release HIStory: Past, Present, and Future Book I fell short of expectations with its sales of two million units domestically, 12 million internationally. A 1997 album, Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, fared even worse, with little marketing and domestic sales in the hundreds of thousands; it consisted largely of remixes by various hit producers of songs from the 1995 HIStory release. Jackson seemed to be attempting to update his style to fit with the technology-driven musical trends of the 1990s.\n\nEarly in 2001 he was inducted as a solo artist into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, and later that year he released his first album of all new material in ten years, Invincible. Additionally he made an appearance at the MTV Music Video Awards and appeared as a headliner in Washington, D.C., at a benefit concert for victims of terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, against the United States. However, despite these attempts at a musical comeback, Jackson’s curious lifestyle overshadowed his performance.\n\nIn early 2003, Jackson attempted to dispel rumors by opening his life up to the public eye. British journalist Martin Bashir followed Jackson around with a camera for eight months, gathering hundreds of hours of footage, which was ultimately edited into a two-hour television special. On film, Jackson speaks blithely of sleeping in beds with young children, introduces his third child, Prince Michael II (affectionately known as “Blanket” for the head covering he is always wearing), as the product of “a surrogate mother and my own sperm cells,” and alleges he only had plastic surgery on his nose in order to hit “higher notes.” These statements, coupled with other bizarre acts including dangling his youngest child off the third story balcony of a German hotel, had many wondering whether Jackson was fit to be a father.\n\nJackson expressed outrage at being “betrayed” by Bashir, as he told People. His brother Jermaine concurred, comparing the documentary to a “modern day lynching.” Jackson put together his own television special, culled from his own cameramen that taped Bashir taping Jackson, in an attempt to set the record straight. While it didn’t soothe all critics, some felt that the persecution of Jackson had gone on long enough. MSNBC writer Michael Ventre opined, “What he should do to again conquer the charts and make the public focus on his talent rather than his ‘idiosyncracies’ is to return to his roots. Take some blues and funk and rock and pop, mix in a large dose of passion, recruit Quincy Jones to produce, and release something that harkens back to the old days.”\n\nJackson returned to the studio in late 2003 with an unlikely collaborator—R&B hitmaker R. Kelly, who was also going through his own set of trying circumstances. Jackson cut a new Kelly-penned single, “One More Chance,” which was scheduled for release in November of 2003, the only new track on Number Ones, a collection of all his greatest hits of the past 25 years, and one more chance for Jackson to revive his music career.\n\nSelected discography\n\nSolo\n\nGot to Be There, Motown, 1972.\n\nBen, Motown, 1972.\n\nMusic and Me, Motown, 1973.\n\nForever, Michael, Motown, 1975.\n\nThe Best of Michael Jackson, Motown, 1975.\n\nOff the Wall, Epic, 1979.\n\nThriller, Epic, 1982.\n\nBad, Epic, 1987.\n\nDangerous, Epic, 1991.\n\nHistory: Past, Present, and Future Book I, Epic, 1995.\n\nBlood on the Dance Floor History in the Mix, Epic, 1997.\n\nInvincible, Epic, 2001.\n\nNumber Ones, Epic, 2003.\n\nWith the Jackson 5\n\nDiana Ross Presents the Jackson 5, Motown, 1969.\n\nABC, Motown, 1970.\n\nThird Album, Motown, 1970.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Christmas Album, Motown, 1970.\n\nMaybe Tomorrow, Motown, 1971.\n\nGoin’Back to Indiana, Motown, 1971.\n\nThe Jackson 5’s Greatest Hits, Motown, 1971.\n\nLooking Through the Windows, Motown, 1972.\n\nSkywriter, Motown, 1973.\n\nGet It Together, Motown, 1973.\n\nDancing Machine, Motown, 1974.\n\nMoving Violation, Motown, 1975.\n\nJoyful Jukebox Music, Motown, 1976.\n\nThe Jackson 5 Anthology, Motown, 1976.\n\nThe Jacksons, Epic, 1976.\n\nGoin’Places, Epic, 1977.\n\nDestiny, Epic, 1978.\n\nTriumph, Epic, 1980.\n\nBoogie, Motown, 1980.\n\nThe Jacksons Live, Epic, 1981.\n\nFarewell My Summer Love, Motown, 1984 (recorded 1973, previously unreleased).\n\nVictory, Epic, 1984.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nJackson, Michael, Moonwalk, Doubleday, 1988.\n\nRomanowski, Patricia, and Holly George-Warren, eds., The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, Fireside, 1995.\n\nTaraborrelli, J.

Manheim\n\nJackson, Michael\n\nJackson, Michael, enormously successful pop /R&B singer, songwriter, and dancer; b. Gary, Ind., Aug, 29, 1958. Michael Jackson was a child prodigy who carried his brothers along with him to initial success in the pop group The Jackson Five. His father had played guitar in a local group before his marriage, and passed his dreams of pop success onto his children. The older sons (Sigmund Esco “Jackie,” b. May 4, 1951; Toriano Adaryll “Tito,” b. Oct. 15, 1953; Jermaine La Jaune, b. Dec. 11, 1954; all Gary, Ind.) formed a trio in the early 1960s and were quickly joined by Michael and Marlon (b. Gary, Ind., March 12, 1957) to form the original Jackson Five. The group played locally and even began to undertake limited tours as an opening act for other R&B groups. They were invited to try out for Motown Records in 1969, and their filmed audition, showing a very young Michael performing James Brown-esque dance moves, clinched the deal with Motown label chief Berry Gordy. He relocated the group to L.A. (where the label was then headquartered), and in classic Motown fashion began reshaping their image, dressing them in the latest “mod” fashions (large floppy hats, flowered shirts, exaggerated bell-bottoms, and botts). They hit it big almost immediately in January 1970 with “I Want You Back,” followed quickly by the top pop and R&B hits “ABC,” “The Love You Save,” and “I’ll Be There”; “Mama’s Pearl” and “Never Can Say Goodbye” were smash hits in both fields, and “Maybe Tomorrow” and “Sugar Daddy” became smash R&B and major pop hits. The group was so popular that a cartoon series was launched in 1971 featuring animated Jacksons to appeal to the kiddie market.\n\nMotown also tried to market the individual Jacksons as pop stars in their own right. In late 1971 Michael Jackson’s solo career was launched with the crossover smash “Got to Be There” followed in 1972 by a remake of Bobby Day’s “Rockin’ Robin,” “I Wanna Be Where You Are,” and “Ben,” the title song to a movie about a trained rat. Jermaine’s solo career started in 1972, but his success was largely limited to a smash remake of Shep and The Limelites’ “Daddy’s Home” in early 1973. Jackie Jackson’s solo debut on Motown from 1973 failed to produce any hits.\n\nThe Jackson Five continued to score major pop and smash R&B hits for Motown through 1973 with a remake of “Little Bitty Pretty One,” “Lookin’ through the Windows,” “Corner of the Sky,” “Hallelujah Day,” and “Get It Together.” “Dancing Machine” became a top R&B and smash pop hit in 1974, followed by the R&B smashes “Whatever You Got, I Want:” “I Am Love (Parts I and II)” (a major pop hit), and “Forever Caine Today.” In 1975 Michael scored the R&B smashes “We’re Almost There” and “Just a Little Bit of You” (a major pop hit), yet he would not achieve another hit until leaving Motown.\n\nIn 1976 The Jackson Five switched to Epic Records. Jermaine, who had married Berry Gordy’s daughter Hazel in 1973, left the group and continued to record for Motown through 1982, scoring his biggest successes with 1980’s “Let’s Get Serious” and 1982’s “Let Me Tickle Your Fancy.” Adding brother Randy (real name, Steven Randall) (b. Oct. 29, 1961), the group was legally forced to abandon the name Jackson Five, becoming simply the Jacksons, after Motown sued for breach of contract. Their enormous success continued through 1980, highlighted by the pop and R&B smashes “Enjoy Yourself” and “Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)” and the major pop and R&B smashes “Show You the Way to Go,” “Lovely One,” and “Heartbreak Hotel.” In 1978 Michael Jackson co-starred with longtime friend Diana Ross in the movie remake of The Wizard of Oz, The Wiz, which yielded his last Motown hit, “Ease on Down the Road,” in duet with Ross.\n\nIn 1979 Michael Jackson also moved to Epic Records, where his debut, Off the Wall, became a phenomenal success, staying on the album charts for more than three years and selling more than six million copies. The album yielded two top pop and R&B hits, “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough” and “Rock with You,” and two major pop hits, “Off the Wall” (an R&B smash) and “She’s Out of My Life.” LaToya Jackson (b. May 29, 1956), who had sung backup with The Jackson Five, started her solo career on Polydor Records in 1980, switching to Private I Records in 1984, where she scored her only significant success with “Heart Don’t Lie” a major R&B hit. She is estranged from the rest of the family, and has been the most vocally critical of her parents and siblings. LaToya has provoked scandal by posing nude for Playboy, as well as through her well publicized brawls with her husband, who manages her career.\n\nThanks to the production of Quincy Jones and a carefully orchestrated and sequenced promotional campaign, Michael Jackson’s 1982 release, Thriller, became the best-selling album of all time, eventually moving nearly 50 million copies worldwide. The first single, “The Girl Is Mine,” a duet with Paul McCartney, became a top R&B and easy-listening and smash pop hit. The second, “Billie Jean,” became a top pop and R&B hit, in large part due to frequent airplay of its promotional video on MTV, the first by a black artist to receive such extensive exposure. Jackson’s incredible dance moves, a highlight of all his videos, were highlighted on the Motown 25th Anniversary TV special, helping also to launch this song. The third, “Beat It,” was heavily promoted as a video by MTV and featured the dynamic lead-guitar playing of heavy-metal icon Eddie Van Halen. Subsequently, “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’” and “Thriller” became smash pop and R&B hits, “Human Nature” became a smash pop and major R&B hit, and “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)” became a major pop hit. The elaborate video for “Thriller” was itself the subject of a documentary, the first “behind-the-scenes/making of” film which became a huge-selling home video success. In the meantime, a second duet with McCartney, “Say Say Say” from McCartney’s Pipes of Peace album, became a top pop and smash R&B hit.\n\nThe year 1984 was the most successful year in the career of many of the other members of the Jackson family. Jermaine scored major pop and R&B hits with “Dynamite” and “Do What You Do” on Arista Records. Rebbie (real name, Maureen) (b. May 19, 1950), who had worked with the Jacksons from into 1977, achieved a major pop and smash R&B hit with “Centipede” on Columbia Records. Jermaine rejoined his other brothers in the Jacksons for their hugely successful Victory album and tour. The album yielded a pop and R&B smash, “State of Shock,” with lead vocals by Michael and Mick Jagger, and a major pop and R&B hit, “Torture” with lead vocals by Michael and Jermaine. However, by 1986 Michael had left The Jacksons, and the group endured into the 1990s with little success. Marlon’s 1987 debut solo album on Capitol yielded the R&B smash “Don’t Go.”\n\nAfter co-writing with Lionel Richie and performing on the “We Are the World” single in 1995 and starring in the 15-minute movie Captain Eo shown exclusively at Disneyland and Disney World, Michael Jackson recorded another album under producer Quincy Jones. Bad was released in August 1987. The album sold nearly 20 million copies worldwide in its first year and yielded an astonishing seven hits, including four top pop and R&B hits: “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You” (also a top easy-listening hit) with Siedah Garrett on backing vocals, “Bad,” “The Way You Make Me Feel” and “Man in the Mirror.” “Dirty Diana,” recorded with Billy Idol’s guitarist Steve Stevens, became a top pop and smash R&B hit, and “Another Part of Me” and “Smooth Criminal” were smash R&B and major pop hits through 1988. Again, Michael produced a series of memorable videos to promote the songs, working with distinguished directors such as Martin Scorsese on “Bad.” Between September 1987 and January 1989, Michael Jackson conducted his first solo tour, playing venues around the world.\n\nIn March 1991 Michael Jackson re-signed with the parent company of Epic Records, Sony Corporation. The 15-year contract was reportedly worth in the neighborhood of $1 billion. However, his next album, Dangerous, was met with mixed reviews, but nonetheless, produced seven hit singles. “Black or White,” recorded with Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash, became a top pop hit, while “Remember the Time” and “In the Closet” became smash pop and top R&B hits. “Jam,” recorded with rapper Heavy D, “Heal the World,” and “Who Is It” proved major cro"
