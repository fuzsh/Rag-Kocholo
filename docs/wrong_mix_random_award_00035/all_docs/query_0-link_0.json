Jackson expertly fuses fashion and basketball, showing why players’ off court style can be as impactful as what they do in the game.”\n\n—NINA GARCIA, editor in chief, Elle\n\n“You cannot be a true enthusiast of sports or fashion if you don’t own a copy of this book. European designers are too often credited with the trends that spread around the world, and Jackson shows us that those designs are nothing without validation from the streets where many NBA athletes get their start. In this beautiful celebration of culture, he captures the role these athletes have played in style on a global scale.”\n\n—D. WATKINS, New York Times bestselling author of Where Tomorrows Aren’t Promised and Black Boy Smile\n\n“What Jackson does with “Fly” is canonize the cultural impact the ‘Ballplayer look’ has had all along.”\n\n—Scoop Jackson, author of The Game is Not a Game\n\n“In Fly, Jackson does more than compile a basketball/fashion look book, and it’s more than a timeline and history. To me, what he explores is the evergreen push to remind people that the talented are more than their talents. That there’s a burning creativity and a relentless desire to express oneself, not as a highlight but as a human.”\n\n—JASON REYNOLDS, #1 New York Times bestselling coauthor of Stamped\n\n“NBA fashion has evolved so much over the years. To see the various styles worn by players throughout the eras—all in one book—is cool. Now with social media and the game being so global, everyone sees everything. NBA fashion has never been bigger.”\n\n—P.J. TUCKER, Philadelphia 76ers\n\n“a coffee-table book that elevates the subject to the same decorative status as a Dior or Gucci monograph.” —Vanessa Friedman, Chief Fashion Critic, New York Times"
