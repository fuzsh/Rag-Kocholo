The approach to music was collaborative and respectful. It was a safe zone for ideas, without a need to edit thoughts or emotions, that set the bar for our future careers.\n\nWe learned that you need to start with a great song first, the importance of storytelling with lyrics, groove, dance-ability, to not repeat yourself and to strive to create works that will have a lasting impact.\"\n\n- Anthony and Steven\n\nAbout the video:\n\nAnthony Marinelli and Steven Ray describe what it was like to be in the studio with Michael Jackson during the making of his iconic album - Thriller.

Anthony Marinelli describes how it was created, why he and Brian Banks were chosen to bring a cinematic approach to the album, the importance of visual music at the advent of MTV and the circumstances leading up to the making of the iconic song. This tag team synthesizer duo also composed, performed or programmed music on other hit records, many high profile films and award winning ads throughout the 80’s and early 90’s.\n\nSee also:\n\n- BBC Witness History Hears from Anthony Marinelli: Michael Jackson's Thriller\n\n- The Genius of Michael Jackson by Steve Knopper\n\n- Let's Make History by Brice Najar\n\n- Wikipedia - Thriller song\n\n- Discogs - Michael Jackson Thriller\n\n- MusicBrainz - Michael Jackson Thriller\n\nEquipment Used:\n\nARP 2600\n\n#ThrillerMichaelJackson #QuincyJones #MTV #Synthesizer #SteveKnopper #TheGeniusofMichaelJackson #BriceNajar #LetsMakeHIStory #ARP2600\n\nAbout Anthony:\n\nLA based composer, musician and record producer.

I recently learned from the label that this film has achieved bonafide cult status.\n\nOur music features a 4 voice all female choir, solo trumpet, slide guitar and the Synclavier Digital Music System. This score is an early example of film music combining electronic digital sounds, electronic analog sounds, acoustic instruments, choir and digitally sampled sounds. There was a lot of experimentation and improvisation involved in the process. Many of the percussive rhythms in the score were sampled loops derived from recordings of machinery at an abandoned early 20th century textile mill in Bangor, Maine located on the film set. The live players and choir were added to the tracks after the sampled loops and electronic elements most of the time.\n\nI have deep admiration for the film’s director Ralph S. Singleton for trusting and urging two young composers to supply a musical voice that could be present throughout the entire film. He encouraged us to create music and ambient soundscapes unlike anything expected in the genre to date.\n\nSpecial thanks to soundtrack producer Dan Goldwasser for his attention to detail at every phase and wonderfully sinister art design in a 23 page booklet, MV Gerhard and Matt Verboys for investing so much time and energy into this comprehensive soundtrack release, Daniel Schweiger for his creative in-depth liner notes and so much colorful behind the scenes information, James Nelson for pristine and flawless mastering and especially to Lonnie Sill (while head of music at Paramount Pictures) for backing us to score this film so early in our career.\n\n- Anthony Marinelli\n\nPurchase Soundtrack\n\nhttps://lalalandrecords.com/graveyard-shift-limited-edition/\n\nCD booklet autographed by co-composer Anthony Marinelli and Ralph S. Singleton at no additional charge. Autographs are available while supplies last and are NOT guaranteed.\n\nFilm Synopsis\n\nIn a very old textile mill with a serious rat infestation, deadly accidents start happening, but the corrupt foreman continues to put his workers in danger, until they discover a horrifying secret deep in the basement. The film stars David Andrews, Kelly Wolf and Brad Dourif, and is directed by Ralph S. Singleton. It was adapted from a short story by Stephen King first published in Cavalier magazine and later included in King’s 1978 collection Night Shift. It was adapted into Graveyard Shift in 1990.\n\nCredits\n\nGuitar - Dean Parks\n\nPercussion - Luis Conte\n\nBones - Vinnie Colaiuta\n\nTrumpet - Oscar Brashear\n\nChoir - Carmen Twillie, Donna Davidson, Beth Anderson & Gigi Worth\n\nSynclavier Digital Music System - Anthony Marinelli & Brian Banks\n\nMusic Recorded & Mixed by Mark Curry\n\nAssistant Engineer - Scott Reeder\n\nMusic Recorded at Sonar, Hollywood, CA\n\nFrom Rusted Wave:\n\nThe Young Guns original motion picture soundtrack has never been released...until now!
