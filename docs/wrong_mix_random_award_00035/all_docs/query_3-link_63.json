        "text": "What came before 'Earth Song'?\n\nMichael Jackson - Heal The World (Official Video)\n\nMichael had already released charitable or socially conscious songs.\n\nEven as a child, he recorded the song 'In Our Small Way' for his first album Got to Be There back in 1971.\n\nRead more: Remembering Michael Jackson's 'Ghosts', his forgotten follow-up to 'Thriller'\n\nYears later, he used his fame and money to promote various causes close to him. In 1985, he co-wrote the charity single 'We Are the World' with Lionel Richie, to raise funds for the poor in Africa and the US.\n\nAll of the profits from his single 'Man in the Mirror' went to charity, and he founded the Heal the World Foundation in 1992, inspired by his song of the same name.\n\nWhen did Michael Jackson write 'Earth Song' and what inspired it?\n\n'Earth Song' was recorded for Michael Jackson's 1995 album HIStory, and was the third single taken from the album after 'Scream' and 'You Are Not Alone'.\n\nMichael later said of the song's creation: \"I remember writing 'Earth Song' when I was in Austria, in a hotel. And I was feeling so much pain and so much suffering of the plight of the planet Earth.\n\nRead more: Beautiful moment Michael Jackson and Princess Diana shyly first met and sparked lifelong friendship\n\n\"And for me, this is Earth's Song, because I think nature is trying so hard to compensate for man's mismanagement of the Earth. And with the ecological unbalance going on, and a lot of the problems in the environment, I think earth feels the pain, and she has wounds, and it's about some of the joys of the planet as well.\n\n\"But this is my chance to pretty much let people hear the voice of the planet. And this is 'Earth Song'. And that's what inspired it. And it just suddenly dropped into my lap when I was on tour in Austria.\"\n\nWhat is 'Earth Song' about?\n\nThe track sees Michael sending out a wakeup-call of sorts about the terrible condition that mankind has caused to the world, from war to the killing of animals and of the earth itself.\n\nThe song becomes somewhat spiritual towards the end, where Michael calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor Abraham.\n\nMeanwhile, 'What about death again' reminds listeners to think about their eternal death, asking people to check their heart for repentance, or to see if they really ever cared.\n\nMichael had disfellowshipped himself from his previous Jehovah's Witness faith, and had simplified his faith to focus on the Biblical Jesus Christ until his death in 2009.\n\nHow was the music video filmed?\n\nMichael Jackson - Earth Song (Official Video)\n\nThe expensive music video for 'Earth Song' was directed by photographer Nick Brandt.\n\nIt later won the 1995 Doris Day Music Award at the Genesis Awards, and a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form in 1997.\n\nThe film shows images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution, poaching, poverty and war.\n\nRead more: The moment Michael Jackson did his first moonwalk on TV and changed music history forever - video\n\nBy the end, Michael Jackson and the world unite in the song's spiritual chant, summoning a force that heals the world.\n\nThe video closes with a request for donations to Jackson's Heal the World Foundation.\n\nIt was filmed in four geographic regions. The first location was the Amazon Rainforest, where a large portion had been destroyed a week after the video's completion. Natives of the area also appeared in the video, and were not actors.\n\nThe second scene sees a war zone in Karlovac, Croatia, featuring famous Serbian actor Slobodan DimitrijeviÄ‡ and residents of the town.\n\nThe third location was Tanzania, featuring scenes of illegal poaching and hunting. No animals were harmed in the making of the video, with footage coming from documentary archives.\n\nThe final location was filmed in Warwick, New York, where a safe forest fire was simulated in a corn field.\n\nHow did it perform in the charts?\n\nIn the UK, it is Michael Jackson's best-selling single. It topped the chart for six weeks, including the Christmas number one.\n\nDuring its stay at number one, it kept the first single released by the Beatles in 25 years, 'Free as a Bird', off the number one spot. It sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK alone.\n\nIt also topped the charts in Iceland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, and was his first number one in Germany.\n\nHowever, the song wasn't released as a single in the US at the time.\n\nWhat happened at the 1996 Brit Awards?\n\nOn February 19, 1996, Michael Jackson performed 'Earth Song' at the Brit Awards in the UK. He attended to collect a special 'Artist of a Generation' award.\n\nMichael sang while hanging off the edge of a crane elevator. Below, backing performers joined in, with many embracing the singer as he descended.\n\nDuring the performance, Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker ran onstage without permission, and proceeded to lift his shirt and pretended to break wind, before giving Jackson the V-sign.\n\nRead more: Barry Gibb and Michael Jackson's powerful forgotten duet 'All In Your Name' is spectacular\n\nCocker was later questioned by police over claims he had assaulted some of the children performers, but he was released without charge.\n\nThe British artist later said that he found the performance offensive, claiming that Jackson had portrayed himself as Christ-like. However, he later clarified that his actions weren't personally aimed at Jackson himself, but rather the performance.\n\nCocker said that he admired Jackson as an artist, saying: \"He can dance, [...] anybody who invents the moonwalk is alright by me\".\n\nIt was Michael Jackson's final song\n\nThe song was planned for Michaek Jackson's This Is It concerts in 2009.\n\n'Earth Song' was the last song Michael ever performed.\n\nHe rehearsed it on June 24, 2009, while preparing for This Is It, just hours before his death.\n\nRead more: Michael Jackson's mind-blowing last filmed performance 48 hours before his death - watch video"
