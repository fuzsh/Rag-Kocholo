        "text": "This is so much more than a book fair, it's a gathering of over 99 Maine authors who can sign their books and talk about their work.\n\nWill There Be Books for Sale?\n\nThis event caught my eye for several reasons. I love to read and am always looking around for new books. I enjoy reading books by Maine authors and love the idea that they'll be at the event. And I'm always looking for unique gifts from Maine for my brother who lives in New Hampshire. It's a tradition with us to give locally sourced gifts, so a signed book from a Maine author is perfect.\n\nChristopher Packard will serve as host of the event that's being held Saturday at the Bangor Public Library and will be the largest book fair ever held in the area. Packard is the author of 'Mythical Creatures of Maine,' one of the many, many interesting books you'll find at the event. Pick up some books for yourself, some gifts for your loved ones, and get them signed. All genres of books will be available, so you should be able to find something fun and interesting. Just bear in mind that some of these authors will not be able to accept credit cards, so take cash, Venmo, or PayPal to make your purchases.\n\nWhat Else is Happening at the Event?\n\nIn addition, there will be free readings, talks, and panel discussions throughout the day as the event takes over the beautiful Bangor Public Library. Several topics will be covered, including 'Three Routes to Publishing a Book.' I may stop over and check that one out because I have a book that's already been rejected by one publisher. Maybe they can give me some valuable tips.\n\nFinally, the fair will also feature the special launch of 'Rivers of Ink,' a charity anthology to support the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument's Tekαkαpimək Contact Center.\n\nWhen and Where is This Being Held?"
