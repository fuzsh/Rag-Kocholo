She wanted to release her song “Already Gone” as a third single, but she has been stopped due to Beyonce’s “Halo.” B and C have the same beat thanks to a producer. The producer gave them both the same track. They both wrote to it and they both put their versions on their albums. Kelly wanted to release it even though Beyonce had hers, but her record label shot it down. Here are the songs. Let me know which you like best. ~ Kanye the new king of pop? according to him its only natural. Kanye goes on to say “ You know everyone loves and respects Michael but times change. It’s so sad to see Michael gone but it makes a path for a new King of Pop and I’m willing to take that on. There’s nobody who can match me in sales and in respect so it only makes sense for me to take over Michael’s crown and become the new King. First there was Elvis, then there was Michael, now in the 21st century its Kanye’s time to rule. I have nothing but respect for Michael but someone needs to pick up where he left off and there’s nobody better than me to do that. I am the new King of Pop. ” ~ They are saying now that Chris and Rihanna are now back together, at least for a night. According to the paps at the New York Post, the former couple may be a couple once again. They claim they spent this weekend together in a Midtown New York hotel and tried to hide it. According to law issued in California and the conditions of a restraining order forbid this interation. You think that stopped these two volatile lovebirds? The guys reportedly checked into the Trump International Hotel & Tower on Friday. People at the hotel snitched on them, saying that they spent a full two days together in the sprawling luxury hotel. There are no photographs of the pair, but this is what they are saying. The report also claims Chris and Rihanna employed several tactics to throw off paparazzi. This includes decoys and other things. WOW. That sounds like a bad way to live. ~ GROUPIE LOVE—JAY-Z TO DISS THE GAME? There is a big, fat ol’ exclusive rumor right here. I am getting word that Jay-Z will be responding to The Game with a scathing, super epic song called “Groupie Love (My Fan Club).” The song, if it comes true, will be the first true reply that Jay-Z offers The Game, who has dogged Jay-Z pretty bad. But in recent interviews, Jay has laughed that off. I just want to see this drama unfold. There is a second part to this rumor. I am hearing the Kanye will definitely ride with Jay-Z on this instead of remaining neutral. You know, ‘Ye is cool with The Game too. Interesting, because The Game has been defending Kanye’s use of the Autotune. Where will this go? Nobody knows ~ In life, Michael Jackson sold millions of records. In death, he's spawned about as many rumors. Was he murdered? Was he gay? Did he really father those kids? Nothing's off-limits - not even his corpse. The obsession over Jackson's body heated up before it was cold. One report said he was frozen for later testing; another that the gold coffin at his memorial was empty. Motown founder Berry Gordy had to deny a story he was hiding the star's body in his family crypt at Forest Lawn Cemetery. The National Enquirer claimed the Jackson family was afraid \"organized criminals\" would steal the remains. Then there's the ultimate intrigue: that Jackson is actually still alive. The wacko concept has spawned sites such as MichaelJacksonHoax-Death.com. The latest gnarl in the family tree involves a 25-year-old Norwegian rapper and dancer named Omer Bhatti, who has emerged as a possible love child. The speculation - which first surfaced in 2002 - was fueled by Bhatti's presence in the front row of the memorial service and his striking resemblance to Jackson's 7-year-old son, Blanket. ~ Simpson faced a possible life sentence with parole on the kidnapping charge, and the robbery convictions carry mandatory prison time. On December 5, Simpson was sentenced to a total of 33 years in prison with the possibility of parole in about 9 years. Simpson’s lawyers plan to appeal, in an effort to gain eligibility for a mitigated sentence, giving parole sooner. A hearing has been set for August 3, 2009. He is serving his sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada as Inmate #1027820. has had this to say about his lovely stay. “ My cellmate is nuts. He’s a killer, and he hates me. He told me that he is in prison for murder and rape, and he hates my guts because I got away with murdering my ex-wife. He’s told me he is going to strangle me in my sleep the first chance he gets. ” ~ But, rumor around St. Louis is Nelly has kicked masked-man Slo Down out of the St. Lunatics. We hear there are some issues in the camp that make or may not have to do with money. Take that how you want to take it. Nelly’s little brother City Spud is home from prison, and rumor has it likely to replace Slo Down. Not sure if that’s the case or not, but I didn’t even know dude’s name until I got this rumor. He was “dude with the mask on.” ~ Blogxilla let us know that Nicki Minaj has cut all ties w/ Gucci Mane and his manager Deb Antney to go with Cortez & Gee (who also manage Young Jeezy, Kanye, & Drake) Cortez & Gee told Nicki that she can’t have ties to Gucci Mane and be on tour with Young Jeezy. Think about it, you couldn’t tour with Biggie and be down w/ Pac’s team now could you? They told Nicki that Wayne would not f**k with her if she had an outside manager. Now If you didn’t know Nicki sings and raps and young money promised her she could do both, but they have no intention of letting her sing because of Wayne’s focus on his girlfriend singer Shanell Brown (D Woods sister) who also recently signed with Young Money records. and with Drake dropping out of Lil Wayne’s Young Money Presents: The America’s Most Wanted Music Festival tour due to a torn ACL (a ligament in the knee) Nicki Minaj has been added to the tour line up and will be performing cuts from her mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty. ~ in case you didn’t hear, Lil Wayne is going to be working with Madonna on her greatest hits album called Celebration. It’s been long confirmed that Madonna wrangled Lil Wayne for a collaboration of sorts, and more details have recently emerged .I’m not sure how I feel about this. I hope it doesn’t backfire especially with the rumor that Lil Wayne’s rock album may never see the light of day. The song they did together is called “Revolver.” . Not be confused with the recent Weezy single ‘Hot Revolver,’ the Madonna track ‘Revolver,’ will be one of two new songs featured on the new two disc collection of Madonna’s. ~ Sisqo from Dru Hill apparently has a 10-year-old son in Switzerland, according to Swiss press. These rumors don’t come without some serious allegations either. They are suggesting that Sisqo had the kid with a girl that was 14 at the time of conception. Reports are saying that Sis and the girl met after a show in Zurich in 1999. She is now 25 and is now battling for that paternity paper. The Maury test showed that Sisqo is indeed the father of the kid. He hasn’t commented ~ I’m not sure what Miley was thinking behind this. But, she has a song called “Party In The USA” and there is this weird lyric that goes as follow: This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous My tummys turnin and Im feelin kinda homesick Too much pressure and Im nervous Thats when the taxi man turned on the radio And the Jay-Z song was on And the Jay-Z song was on And the Jay-Z song was on Well, I am hearing that Miley has changed the lyric from “Jay-Z” to “Kanye.” They are claiming that this leaked version of the song is a “demo” and that the “real” one references ‘Ye. What is going on here and is she trying to start a beef?\n\n5. Down with the King Let me start off by saying that we have surely lost the greatest entertainer of all time. My list this month is a tribute to a legend. It’s impossible to narrow it own to only 10 when th is man has contributed so much feel good music to the world. This list should at least be the TOP 50 songs by MJ! Nevertheless I ‘ll share with you 10 songs that I have witnessed while DJing in clubs all over the country that made the crowd go bananas. KR 1.

KANE T H I S Giving You More Kane for the Buck Interviewer: The \"L\" Man Edited by: Life Saver “ I felt that based on a lot of what my brother did since he was rappin’ before me. That motivated me, not in a competition way but in a rappin’ way. “ DS: What’s going down with you man? We remember you with the System Buckaz Camp. Big Kane: Yeah before then I was with MTO Liquors up in New York City , then I was with Full Fledge and with my partner we had Bigga Figa. I’ve been out here for a minute. DS: I’ve caught you free stylin’ a couple of times and I always knew I would have to sit down and talk with you about some of your projects. How long have you been in the game? Big Kane: I would say roughly 10 to 13 years. DS: When did you know that you could rap? Big Kane: I felt that based on a lot of what my brother did since he was rappin’ before me. That motivated me, not in a competition way but in a rappin’ way. DS: Just thought I would ask that because I’ve seen you with different camps and now you’re doing your own thing. You go some projects coming out and you let me hear some of you stuff. Talk to me about your projects and what’s going on with you now? Big Kane: Right now I am going into it head first because I know I got to make it happen. I got some strong winners on my side. DS: Now the title of your new project is “More Kane for the Buck”. Big Kane: Yes sir DS: Now everybody knows your name is Kane so we “ I like to let them know the sun is gonna shine and they’re not forgotten. “ M O N T H S gonna take that how you want us to take it. [lol] Big Kane: If there is another he’s a phony. I got that name from my Grandmamma when I used to sneak out the house into the sugar cane in the back of the house behind Holly Brook. I got so many ass whippings behind that name. DS: So why did you name your project “More Kane for the Buck”. It sounds like you have something to prove. That’s an aggressive title. Big Kane: It kind of speaks for itself. It ain’t stepped on, it’s pure. It is what it is. DS: That’s what’s up. Now one thing about your beats is you got some bass laced tracks that be bout to blow your speakers out. Who does your production? Big Kane: I got a little bit of everybody on this thang. It’s a mix tape and when you hear it it’s going to make you thirsty for more. What you heard was from the album, but this is the mix tape so I’m doing it from the hood. DS: Who you got featured on the mix tape? Big Kane: My brother Cliché, bald headed Louis, my main man Big Maine, Big J, my bother from another mother, Linnie so it’s going down like that. DS: A lot of rapper rap about what they see or what “ Unity, the unity got to by tight. Like my main man Shout Out said a long time ago we got to scrap the crab pot. We can do it if we all stick together and stop trying to pull each other down. Put that negative energy into a positive vibe then it will work. ” they know, but you actually have family members locked behind bars for a number of years. Do you want to talk to me about that? I know it’s personal, but can you speak on that? Big Kane: Yes I got my older brother Keith who died in prison in “91” and my other brother Gary is doing 22 ½ and my little brother Tank just caught 15. So I’m tryin’ to break that curse to get them up off of me and from around me. DS: Do they have an effect on your rappin’ when you do your projects? Big Kane: Yeah that is a big part of it. I like to let them know the sun is gonna shine and they’re not forgotten. DS: Yeah we hear your music, but people just don’t know what goes on in other people’s lives. Big Kane: You know everybody got a story to tell and this is mine. DS: I’ve heard he songs and I love the songs, but when am I going to see you on stage? Big Kane: I’m gonna crank back up after everybody gets a taste of this mix tape and then we’ll see if we can get booked. I’m not quite ready now, I’m still tryin’ to work some things out my way instead of somebody else way. DS: What is that single you got with Big Mann also known as Christian Blaq, for the radio? Big Kane: Same Thang. DS: I really like that track cuz it’s clean and it’s commercial, but it’s still street. We have a lot of independent labels in town and we have a lot of people sayin’ they getting’ signed. Since you took a year to step back from the game what is your view on the reason why there is nobody signed in a big way? Big Kane: Unity, the unity got to by tight. Like my main man Shout Out said a long time ago we got to scrap the crab pot. We can do it if we all stick together and stop trying to pull each other down. Put that negative energy into a positive vibe then it will work. DS: So basically attitudes have kept us behind. We have a Florida Music Conference coming up. Are you going to make your way there? Big Kane: 9 out of 10 I will have worked something out. I got somebody on my neck about that now. So I’m gonna have to do that. DS: Are you under new management? Big Kane: The label is Big House Ent. It’s a family thing. I got Isaiah Brown from MIA Mgmt. and Fella from the Funk Ryders. DS: I know you are not a person who chatters on and on, but I want to thank you for taking time out for the Streetz of Duval and it is the 1st time you been on the cover of Duval Streetz. That speaks big things and we are expecting big thing form Big House Ent. When you blow up holla at your boy when you spending that promo money. Big Kane: “You know I got you.” DS: You got some shout outs on the way out the door? Big Kane: A shout out to the whole SB, Jag, J-Baby, Wizard, Mannie. Rest in Peace to Nellis and my home boy Cory, my brother Keith C., Cliché, Sausage Head and them fellas over at Hustle House. It’s a movement you know. DS: I never go back into the interview at this point, but I heard a track on your album about Cory. Big Kane: That’s like a sequel to the one I put out last year. Every album I’m gonna put a song on there for my home boy. DS: That’s what’s it all about. You gonna hold it down for Duval, Big Kane in the building ladies and gentlemen. I introduce to you the next rapper for the new millennium he’s comin’ with “More Kane for the Buck” so y’all look out for it. Remember Big L. told you first….give me my damn credit. I bring you exclusives from the street. Big Kane do you have a MySpace page? Big Kane: No I had to get rid of it cuz the girls were trackin’ me down. DS: This is your boy Big L brining you the streets and I’m out. “ You know everybody got a story to tell and this is mine. “\n\n7. F E A T U R E D A R T I S T S Be careful what you sign and keep everybody out of your personal game room. Traffik Goin hard on the streetz Interviewer: Duval Streetz Written and Edited by: Life Saver DS: I’m gonna start off with this question; “Traffik, where in the hell did you come from dog?” It’s like you popped up out of nowhere. Traffik: Not out of nowhere bro, I went into this whole sh*t the wrong way. I started out doin’ shows at colleges in New York and at The Apollo for the Justo Mixtape Award Show. I was out there instead of home, so it would appear like I popped out of nowhere. I’ve been here, just no buzz. DS: I was interviewing Mob Boss, CEO of Hustle House, a few months ago and he was telling me that he was diggin’ your style of making music. That is very rare that a rapper mentions another artist during his interview. Do you know him personally? Traffik: Yeah, we haven’t linked up yet or anything, but we speak on the phone every now and again to holler. You know G sh*t, nothing too serious. And that was a big shout out too. Big shout out to them ni**as over there at Hustle House. Then ni**as be over there grindin’ buddy. DS: Everyone seems to be talking about you, but very few know how you actually look. Was that your plan of how you wanted to do things, under the radar? Traffik: Yeah, under the radar because ni**as in the city actual reaction to local ni**as as oppose to ni**as from out of town is crazy. Lil Boosie and Webbie I “ I wanted to shed a little light on this sh*t out here. Ni**as out here really like lyin’ cuz that drug sh*t sounds cool. I wanted to give these guys the day after effect, meaning the bills you didn’t pay after you went trickin’, the lawyer fees or your family in need. The miseducation of our children, that sh*t is not cool “ feel, blew up right out here, tore the town up and ni**as were really showin’ love before they got on. So I try to appear as if I’m from out of town and show them later who I am. After they like me like I’m from out of town, then it’s too late to care if they know I’m from here or not because they would have already given the cd a chance. Just a little marketing heads up for ni**as out there. DS: Who are you signed with as far as management? Traffik: Brick Management based out of Atlanta, real people. Richard Skinner and Amp, they do a lot for me. DS: How did y’all hook up? Traffik: We knew each other for a good little while, and then he left for Atlanta and had had a lot of relationships. By the time we met up again I had got better at rappin’ so we linked up and we’re going for that deal now. DS: Well you have a good Manager and street promotions. I had a chance to speak with Richard Skinner briefly and he seems to be a genuine business man and sounds like he knows what he is talking about. Traffik: He has been at it for a long time, years of working man. All the beats on the album I went through him man, so I urge people to feel free to hit him up and get some of that production. DS: There is a small rumor that you actually do have a record deal your about to sign. Is that true? Traffik: I have a few things on the table around me, nothing definite though so that is what it is. DS: Well if you don’t have a deal yet, it is because they haven’t listened to track #4, “Prada’s” or track #5, “Push”. I have to tell you, I called your Manager on Sunday morning while I was at the gym because of those songs. I could not get past the track called “Push”. Do you get responses from those songs a lot? Traffik: Yeah man, Mobb Boss’ favorite is “Prada’s”. That’s what made buddy get in contact with me. But, Yeah “Push” is a big record man. That’s one of them records I don’t wanna waste, feel me? DS: The CD you have out is called “The Red Pill” (Triple Stack Edition). Why did you use that title for your project? Traffik: Because of the vision I had for the CD. I Wanted to shed a little light on this sh*t out here. Ni**as out here really like lyin’ cuz that drug sh*t sounds cool. I wanted to give these guys the day after effect, meaning the bills you didn’t pay after you went trickin’, the lawyer fees or your family in need. The miseducation of our children, that sh*t is not cool and they need to know a ni**a that used to do that sh*t they rappin’ bout don’t feel strongly about that sh*t and that sh*t is not real. I was sellin’ that sh*t to pay bills not run around the city hot doggin’ and sh*t. Real rap. DS: Where have your performed on stage? Traffik: Apollo, Lehman College, TSI, Hip Hop Hell, by the time they read this, Aqua July 4th 09, Lavilla parking lot and Endo Exo. DS: Since you got in the game, what is one of the lessons you’ve learned? Traffik: Be careful what you sign and keep everybody out of your personal game room. DS: What is the next move for the man they call “Traffik”? Traffik: Radio, gotta get that buzz right. DS: Do you have any shout outs on the way out the door? Traffik: Kenny Ca$h, Shawn Cummings Pheezie R.I.P. Perry the whole m.p.m. team My guy Jamel Johnson, Dre, Cleveland and 45th street, Cleveland Arms, Grand Park, Flag Street, Dakota, Petaford Big Ben, THE FIREMEN DJS, Koolaid, Bigga Rankins, DJ Tru Story 151, Ivory Orr, Ben, Vernon Dime Ent. Chris Slade Bloodhound, Pokey, 4 Nickel, Party Carl T-roy, Lajuan, Spivey, Larry, yak, KOOL all my guys man, they know who they are. DS: How do people get in contact with you for booking or features? Traffik: traffik@tmail.com and for beats, send that to promise904@gmail.com or the on the CD. I started out doin’ shows at colleges in New York and at The Apollo for the Justo Mixtape Award Show. I was out there instead of home, so it would appear like I popped out of nowhere. I’ve been here, just no buzz.\n\n8. Crutch Creating a Powerhouse Movement Interviewer: Duval Streetz Newz Written and Edited by: Life Saver DS: Crutchfield. You’ve come on the seen of the City and got straight to work didn't you? I’ve never even heard of you one minute and the next minute your name starts poppin off left and right. What's up? Crutch: Grinding is the best way I can sum it up. I went hard, I came back to Jacksonville with a mind set that I was gonna put on for the city and it went down just like that. I mean, tell me where else in da ‘ville are you gonna go and find the baddest dancers and the baddest girls in the city all in one spot. Exactly, you can’t think of one. Duval Knights ENT and STACXS ENT, we the streets right now and it ain’t just me. I put my whole team on like my main man Red, Shanks, P.I.G. (from Da Dirt Records) and a gang of others.It isn’t hard to get sh*t right when you got a team of people working with you that you know. This city has got to learn that our strength is in numbers. We stand united and if we come together we accomplish more. This is just the tip of the iceberg, just wait until 2010. DS: Where are you originally from playa? Crutch: Duval County, I grew up in Moncrief Village 4657 Flynn Ct. I grew up watching Blood Raw and Uncut. DS: Rumor has it you were a “Big Time” NFL star that recently retired. How true is that and if that is true, why in the hell did you leave that great job? Crutch: I wouldn’t use the words “big time”. I did my thing while I was playin’. I built up a decent fan base, but football is one of those things you can’t do forever. You have to understand the NFL really stands for Not For Long. You have to get your money and get out. I wasn’t ready to retire, but a couple of injuries and politics forced me to. Do I miss playin’, hell yes but I’m happy doing what I’m doin’. Now at the end of the day the only thing that matters is the money. I’m making money so it ain’t no love loss, just great memories and a whole lot of prestige. DS: You’ve started taking on leadership roles in the city when it comes to labels and artist. Tell me a little abut that. Crutch: I’ve mainly been tryin’ to just pull everybody together and get this city like the ATL where everybody calabs together to make money. One thing labels andartist need to understand here is that you’re only as strong as your strongest contact. It helps a lot if you have somebody who can pick up the phone and talk to executives at different records labels, magazine etc. That’s what I bring to the table. This ain’t New York where you can do downtown and walk in major labels’ office. This is the South so you have to create a demand first, and then shop your product. Marketing is the key in this business. I try to educate and work with as many artist and labels as I can. I work with artist all over the Southeast. They all want the same thing; “exposure”. Somebody has to step up to the challenge in Jacksonville. The streets talk. DS: I believe you were working with Dank World Ent. when I met you. I believe that is not the case today. Do you care to comment on the recent and abrupt change of motion? Crutch: I still do things with Dank World. They are still my people. One thing about business you can’t stay complacent. You have to stay busy. I own clubs, I promote, I work with a lot of artist, labels and Ent. Companies. I can’t limit myself to just one thing. I f*ck with everybody and everybody f*ck with me. I want everybody in this city to work together. That’s what I stand for; “Let’s all eat”. So many people may see me f*ckin’ with Hustle House, Da Dirt, Loyalty, Po Boy, MSG Records and be like; I thought he was with Dank World. I just stay movin’. It’s about money and it’s a grind everyday out here. The decisions you make on a daily basis influences your future. I’m still down with Dank World; they’re on the right track. DS: It seems like artist, managers and labels in this city change like the sun rising and setting. Why can’t we seem to get a format and stick with the plan in the city? Crutch: You’ve got to be strong out here. If you’re a boss out here, you’ve got to run your team right. You have to teach your people how to take the good with the bad because when it rains, it pours. If you a real boss and you’ve raised some men up under your belt, your team will weather the storm whatever the circumstances may be. The main reason ni**as fall out is over money and girls; that’s bullsh*t. We can’t be falling out over money or girls, especially not girls. You can change them like clothes. Everybody has to stand up and be accountable for their own actions, so I don’t think it’s the format. The person on top has to be a strong leader and a real boss. DS: Recently I found out that you and your partner own your own night at Mascara’s. How did that come about? Crutch: I was in the club a couple of months ago and I liked the setup, so I approached the owner about doing a listening party there for some of my artists. I was going to invite a couple of majors to come down and listen to some music etc etc. The owner liked me and my proposal and asked why I don’t I help him here and that’s how it started. It was me and my main man, Red first then my partner, Shanks came in the following week and the rest is history. Saturday nights at Mascara is the hottest place in the city right now. The August line up of artist that will be appearing there on Saturdays is stupid. I ain’t even gonna drop no names, I’m gonna just let the radio and the flyers do the talking. One of the owners (Big John) has become a good friend of mine and has taught me a lot about the club business. It’s hard to find people in the business you can trust, but I will say he is one of them. Me and my partner Shanks put a lot of time into getting the club bammin’ like it is now. We ain’t goin’ no where. DS: Is the adult entertainment business different from running a regular entertainment business and if so, how? Crutch: Hell yeah. Money changes hand in the adult entertainment business way more often than regular business. You have to watch everybody. I would compare it to the movie “Casino”, where everybody is watching everybody. Then you have the girls because you working around sexy ass females all day and night; it ain’t hard to get off focus. To be honest bro, it’s just what you this it is; “Paradise”. Come to my club and you will think you’re in a….. Dime pieces everywhere, Stallions to be exact. F*ck with me and you’ll have your own stable in no time. Real talk. DS: What has been your craziest moment since you have decided to get into the entertainment business? Crutch: What has been the craziest moment? There isn’t just one, everyday is “party, party, party let’s all get wasted”, real talk. You have to go hard or go home and I throw parties and they all be loose. We’ve done did it all; big pool parties, late night hot tubs, partying until the sun comes up. I can’t pick one thing out. I’ve been out here for a while. I played pro ball for eight years before this so I’ve lived a life, feel me? Tell you what, the next event Duval Knight Ent. does, be there and I will make sure ya’ll see some sh*t ya’ll ain’t seen here yet. I really do this sh*t cuz, YouTube can vouch for that. DS: Have you ever though about returning to the NFL? Crutch: I gave it some thought but at the end of the day I’m still puttin’ up athlete numbers, so I’m good. Besides it’s that easy anyway. I’ve been livin’ a rockstar lifestyle for a while now. If I wanted to stop, I couldn’t. The streets won’t tlet me. People love our events and every time my club is packed or my events are successful, I feel like I just intercepted a pass and took it down the sideline for six. The only football you will see me play again is on the ESPN classics. One side note though, I will be getting honored for my accomplishments at Clemson on Sept. 25th. I believe at one of the home games and I still get all the perks from being a Philadelphia Eagle Alumni. Life is good. DS: What is your partner in crime’s name? Crutch: Kenneth Shanks DS: How did you guys team up? Crutch: Da Mighty JA. We work so good together the Lord had to make it possible. That’s my dog, we’ve been through ups and downs, but we’re still standing. Now we’re up and we ain’t lookin’ back. We do Mascara’s, we own our own studio and have a couple of clubs. We doin’ big things now. If I told you everything, this interview would have to be continued. DS: What is the next “Big” step for your company? Crutch: The studio we’re building and the clubs we’re purchasing, right we have 6400 sq. ft. building we are designing our studio in. I’m talkin’ about the place is goin’ be flat screen’d out. Live You Tube feeds, separate editing room, green room, photography studio; all that sh*t is goin’ down. Naw, this ain’t no game. Me and main man got one goal in mind. “Let’s get it”. DS: What is your opinion on the loss of Michael Jackson? Crutch: He was truly a star, but more than that what he and his brothers accomplished in the late 60’s early 70’s helped expose African American culture to the restof the country. The whole Motown, Barry Gordy and Jackson 5 opened a lot of doors. Not only in music for African Americans, but also in basic civil liberties. Mike was accepted by all nationalities world wide. We can’t forget how many ethnic stigmatisms that Mike help tear down. We’re not only minus one great entertainer, but also one great humanitarian who did a lot for all races. DS: If someone, after reading this interview would like to get with you, how would they go about that? Crutch: Call me at (904) 487-8043 or hit me up on myspace.com/DuvalKnights. (period is on the end), myspace.com/DuvalKnights or e-mail at crutchfield904@gmail.com. DS: Do you have any shout outs on the way out the door buddy? Crutch: I want everybody out there doin’ their thing, if you wanna take it to the next level holla at me or Stacks and we will make it happen. If you already on the next level, let’s do it even bigger. GO HARD OR GO HOME! “ We stand united and if we come together we accomplish more. “\n\n9. Shanks Creating a Powerhouse Movement Interviewer: Duval Streetz Written and Edited by: Life Saver DS: Shanks, thanks for taking the time to speak with us. What the hell is goin’ on playa? Shanks: Tryin’ to stay up man, that’s all. DS: I met you the first time at Dank World. You were doin’ some stuff with the group. Shanks: Yeah, we were trying to put together a starting point for this big movement. DS: When I spoke with you, you were trying to form a movement for artist around the Jacksonville area. Do you want to go into that for our readers? Shanks: Well, not just artist, it’s for all in the entertainment biz. Basically it’s just sayin’ we can do the same. A lot of people in the industry like to doubt the South talking about they don’t feel his music. We can adjust to what ever, just like the North, West or whoever. DS: What has it been like working with the artists here in town? Shanks: Aw man, everybody has different minds. That’s good and all, but we have to stay focused. You know the devil stays busy, so I just try to keep everybody on the positive and away from the negative. DS: Could you tell me some of the different groups you have worked with? Shanks: Dank World, Gutta Black, F.A.M., Duval Mafia, Dis-n-Dat, House of Rep., Nephew & Hustle House, Solo, LooneyBenz, Baby Mama and da crew, Jericho, Trap Life Records, 205, Made Money, Vandetta Nation, BrandNew Pro., J Gutta, LiLA D. , T-Rone, Grad A Ent. DJ Bigga Beats, DJ Spin, Mr. 904, J. T. Money, D. G Yola, Slip n Slide, Eastside Boys, Def Jam, Biggmann, J Frost, 904 Fashions, Street Hustle and many, many more. DS: What do you think has hindered Duval artists from getting to the next level? Shanks: Motivation, a lot of them have to look for some kind of motivation to keep it hype. A lot of them don’t know how to push a movement, you got to be dedicated and keep the path clear of what it is you want. DS: We have many excuses why people are not getting signed here in Jacksonville, but I think we all are responsible for our own success. Do you agree? Shanks: Oh yeah, I think everyone thinks it’s suppose to happen overnight and easily loose focus. DS: Well, enough of that. You and Crutchfield have formed an entertainment power house. Where did that idea start? Shanks: Basically just getting back from what we were doin’. Goin’ partying, throwing money everywhere, and spending big dollars at the clubs. Now it’s like getting’ money from these clubs and one door led to many doors. It’s amazing. DS: What is the name of company you and Crutch have? Shanks: I’m STACXS Ent., but we associated with Duval Knights and Street Hustle DVD. DS: I see ya’ll have a hot night at Mascaras. How is that coming along? Shanks: It’s what we do. We turn simple clubs into Terradomes. We hype any club and politely move on. DS: What is the next step for the company playa? Shanks: I’m opening a huge studio where we do it all for anybody and everybody in the entertainment biz. We’ll do photos, video, docs, beats, duplication, graphic design, laser printing, group gear or whatever. Come see me and my family, you might leave with a deal. I have so many people waiting to hear what’s new. DS: How can people get a hold of you? Shanks: stacxsentertainment.com, stacxs101@myspace.com, stacxs101@gmail.com, or just call the studio at (904) 619-1365. DS: Do you have any shout outs?

RUMORS & GOSSIP Michael Jackson: The King of Pop By: Lil Rudy and Jasmine the Assistant ( lilrudyru@yahoo.com , jasminetheassistant@gmail.com ) O n June 25, 2009 the legendary Michael Joseph Jackson suffered an apparent cardiac arrest and later died in L.A California, just two months shy of his 51st birthday. With Michael's sudden death it left his family and the media with plenty of unanswered questions such as: Who gains full custody of the children? What was the cause of his death? Was it accident or murder? Reporters say that around 11:30 am, Michael received a Demerol shot and 30 minutes later suffered a cardiac arrest. According to LAPD, they were not able to release the cause of Jackson's death until autopsy results came back the next day, when it was then announced that neither heart disease nor artery blockage caused the singers death, and their were no signs of trauma or foul play. The Jackson family, however, were still looking for answers and hired a private pathologist who completed the second, more thorough autopsy. These results found Michael's stomach empty, aside from partially dissolved pills he had taken before receiving the Demerol injection that stopped his heart. Shortly after, Latoya Jackson released a statement to TMZ claiming her brother had been murdered by the in-house physician Dr. Murry, who apparently wasn't certified through UCLA as he had persuaded the Jackson family to believe, meaning he was never authorized to administer the medications in the first place. With this new information surfacing, it's no surprise that the LAPD cant locate or get in touch with Dr. Murry. Was Michale bankrupt when he died? According to Latoya, he had money hidden in the house along with his will, which she was able to recover before the cops arrived at the home of the late superstar. Not to mention the one billion dollars in assets, which was left to his mother Catherine, after his debt was taken out (an estimated 500 million dollars). There is also a cloud of uncertainty over how much of his own music Michale owned the rights to through his partnership with Sony, and what will become of the invaluable masters to all the Beatles music (which they want back now that Michale is deceased and has turn everything over to his mother). What about the children? Although Michale's will stated that his mother would gain full custody of his kids and assets, several people disagree with this decision and are contesting it in court. Debbie Rowe, the mother of Prince and Paris, has asked for 100 million dollars in cash or full custody of her kids, even though she signed over her parental rights to Michale at the time of the children's birth. Also it has been discovered that Blanket, the youngest of the three Jackson children, is a \"test-tube baby\", and not really the biological offspring of Michale. With this information floating through the media, Blanket's biological mother, who donated her eggs to Michale, has stated her intentions of gaining full custody of her child. It's so sad what money will do to people's morals. Even the girl from the Thriller video has come forward with accusations, claiming she was never fully compensated for her role in the legendary music production. Last but not least: Was Michale Jackson the King of Entertainment? There are no rumors or gossip about that! Record sales and sold out shows around the world are enough evidence to make this a fact: Michale Jackson IS and will ALWAYS be the King of Pop, the King of Entertainment, and the King of Record Sales.\n\n11.

Williams T he sparkly glove, the penny loafers, the hat, the white socks, the high water pants… all trademark items associated with the biggest figure in pop culture, Michael Jackson. He is arguably the most controversial and breathtaking entertainer of all time, or as Time Magazine put it, “a star of records, radio, [and] rock video. A oneman rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too.” Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana to Joseph and Katherine Jackson, the seventh of nine children (six boys and three girls). At age five, he made his musical debut as the youngest member of the original Jackson 5, a quintet featuring Michael and his brothers Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Jackie. The group was signed to Motown Records from 1968 to 1975 and during that tenure with the major label made history by becoming the first musical act to have its first four singles reach the number one spot on the top 100 singles list. Those singles included the well-known sing-a-longs, “I Want You Back”, “ABC”, “The Love You Save” and “I’ll Be There.” The Jackson 5 left Motown for a new deal with CBS Records in the summer of 1975, changing their name to simply, The Jacksons. Michael launched his solo career in 1971, still under the Jackson 5 umbrella. He released four solo albums while signed to Motown. In 1978, Jackson met acclaimed producer, Quincy Jones while starring in a musical production of The Wiz and the two teamed up for Michael’s breakout album, Off the Wall. The album garnered four top 10 hits, including “Don’t Stop Til’ You Get Enough,” which lead Jackson to win a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. In 1982, Jackson released his sixth solo album, Thriller, currently the best-selling album of all time, selling over 50 million copies worldwide and counting. The album broke numerous records. It remained in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for a ground breaking 80 consecutives weeks, spending 37 of those weeks in the number one spot. Thriller was also the first album to have seven top 10 singles in the Billboard Hot 100 (“Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” “The Girl Is Mine,” “Thriller,” “Beat It,” “Billie Jean,” “P.Y.T,” and “Human Nature”). The album catapulted Jackson’s career and helped establish his credits as an innovator and entertainer. The video interpretation of “Billie Jean” shattered racial obstructions when it premiered on popular video network, MTV, making it the first heavily rotated video featuring an African American artist. On March 25, 1983, Michael performed live on the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever television special, and debuted his signature dance move specified as the “moonwalk,” which is also exhibited in the video that showcases Jackson dancing around town and on top of syncopated lights flashing to the beat of his feet. Unexpectedly, the video for “Thriller” broke the mold for the visual interpretation of song when it premiered on MTV as a 14-minute long mini horror film. It later won a Grammy for Best Long Form Video. Jackson’s follow-up efforts have yet to reach the successful heights of Thriller; however, they did help to sustain his position as the King of Pop. Jackson starred in the Francis Ford Coppola-directed 3-D film Captain EO. It was the most expensive film produced on a per-minute basis at the time, and was later hosted in Disney theme parks. Disneyland featured the film in its Tomorrowland area for nearly 11 years, while Walt Disney World screened the film in its Epcot theme park from 1986 to 1994.With the industry expecting another major hit, Jackson’s first album in five years, Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991) and HIStory (1995) each set historic milestones in their own respects and proved that Jackson could still make an impact with the release of his radio friendly singles. His last studio album, Invincible (2001) initiated a comeback of sorts with the simultaneous promotion of a special 30th Anniversary celebration that took place at Madison Square Garden in September 2001. The televised event served as a celebration of Jackson’s 30 years as a solo artist. He premiered his new single “You Rock My World” with a live performance and also reunited with his brothers during a lengthy and reminiscing melody of Jackson 5 songs. In a high-profile visit to Africa, Jackson visited several countries, among them Gabon and Egypt. His first stop to Gabon was greeted with a sizable reception of more than 100,000 people in “spiritual bedlam”, some of them carrying signs that read, “Welcome Home Michael”. In his trip to the Ivory Coast, Jackson was crowned “King Sani” by a tribal chief. He then thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed official documents formalizing his kingship and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances. One of Jackson’s most acclaimed performances came during the halftime show at Super Bowl XXVII. As the performances began, Jackson was catapulted onto the stage as fireworks went off behind him. As he landed on the canvas, he maintained a motionless “clenched fist, standing statue stance”, dressed in a gold and black military outfit and sunglasses; he remained completely motionless for several minutes while the crowd cheered. He then slowly removed his sunglasses, threw them away and began to sing and dance. His routine included four songs: “Jam”, “Billie Jean”, “Black or White” and “Heal the World”. It was the first Super Bowl where the audience figures increased during the half-time show, and was viewed by 135 million Americans alone; Jackson’s Dangerous album rose 90 places up the album chart Jackson’s personal life eventually began to overshadow his musical achievements. In 2005, he faced child sexual abuse allegations for the second time and endured the extremities and allegations of the public. Jackson was later found not guilty and cleared of all charges. He departed the U.S. to begin a new life away from the public and to further develop a relationship with his three children, Prince Michael Jackson, Paris Katherine Michael Jackson and Prince Michael Jackson II, also known as “Blanket.” However, Jackson’s name resurfaced in 2008 with the release of two era marking compilations, Thriller 25 and King of Pop. In March of 2009, he publicly announced what his fans had patiently been waiting for, a comeback. He was preparing to headline 50 scheduled performances at London's O2 arena beginning on July 13, 2009 and ending on March 6, 2010, 50 dates to highlight his 50 years. It would have been a masterful return. On June 25, 2009 we lost an icon and a true musical pioneer, but luckily, Michael Jackson was recognized for many of his achievements before he suddenly passed away. He was a true humanitarian who raised millions of dollars for the 39 charities he supported, including his Heal the World Foundation. He held The Guinness World Record for “Most Successful Entertainer of All Time,” was a double-inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, won 13 Grammy Awards and sold over 750 million records worldwide. In the following days, the media will continue to urge on the following unresolved matters: two marriages that were possible publicity stunts to hide his homosexuality, theories about his skin color and whether or not he really had vitiligo, his numerous surgeries, the mystery of how he was able to bear white kids and seemingly least in the plethora of the madness but most important, the cause of his death.But, none of that matters because today and forever, we celebrate his legacy, attributions and the many accomplishments he left for us to cherish in his memory. Jackson had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world. He broke down racial barriers, transformed the art of the music video and paved the way for modern pop music in his own country. Jackson’s work, distinctive musical sound and vocal style have influenced scores of hip hop, pop and R&B artists, including Mariah Carey, Usher, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and R. Kelly. For much of his career, he had an “unparalleled” level of worldwide influence over the younger generation through his musical and humanitarian contributions. May he rest in peace, respectfully.\n\n15. 3733 Southside Blvd. Suite 10 904-636-0787 pk@salonpk.com\n\n17. Fathers Teach Your Children How To Survive It is a wise father that knows his own child By William and Sean Jackson O ur young men are being taken away at an alarming rate, either being killed or incarcerated. The recent Real Talk.. Real Change, Black Male Symposium and Boys2Men Symposium address similar issues. We see more shootings that are claiming the lives of those who should have a promising future ahead of them and young black males not being responsible. Young men such as these fell at the hands of those who have sworn to protect and serve, young men such as Sean Bell, Omar Edwards and DeAuntae Farrow; they did not know who their killers were by name, but were unable to prevent the events of their demise. Tragic events show that fathers, grandfathers, stepfathers and even men in ministry/clergy, those that are mentors to young men are hard pressed to teach our young black men survival skills to keep them from being targets and victims. Even President Barack Obama has challenged black fathers to step up and take on their responsibility in the lives of their children. He sets a model for other fathers even with the added responsibilities of his Presidential service. In a past Fathers Day speech,”If we are honest with ourselves, we’ll admit that too many fathers are missing – missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men. And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it” (Sen. Barack Obama 2008). This comes from a man who looks like us, has a wife and children who look like us, so no excuses can be given against such true words even in the cases when Bill Cosby and Rev. Jessie Jackson spoke similar words, they were criticized but spoke similar truths. Constitutional Rights and Religion The constitutional right of “due process” has in some cases been bypassed from innocent until proven guilty, to guilty judgments and a sentences of executions. There appears that the constitutional rights of young black males has been violated, subjugated and denigrated to the point of guilty and execution (figuratively). The first part of Ephesians 6:4 says, \"Fathers, don't exasperate your children\" (NIV). In other words, encourage them in honorable actions, don’t anger them then turn them out to a world where their lives are not taken as important and valuable. In Proverbs 4:4 “Let thine heart retain thy words: keep my commandments and live” (KJV). Who would have thought these words would prove so truthful in the 21st century. In these United States of America our young men’s time lines are slowly diminishing; devaluing to a point of unimportance. Across this country more and more young men are being gunned down by those who look like them. Fathers, our teachings to our sons must go beyond how to ride bike, being respectful to women, the importance of obtaining an education, going to church for praise and worship, we have to teach our children the lessons of life, the lessons of survival, how to stay alive when there are those who do not value them as we should and do. What if fathers were more involved. Bertrand Russell states, “The fundamental defect of fathers is that they want their children to be a credit to them” (1963), but how can this be if fathers are not there to teach, guide and be a model? What has changed since we celebrated 100 years of Fathers Day celebrations in 2009, are fathers more committed to their children, have they resigned to the fact that they have responsibilities that require them to man up and be a father to their children? Are there more mentors in our communities, churches and schools? As Reggie Fulwood states, “You could easily argue that if more men are involved in their children’s lives crime would be down and more of our youthespecially young men have more of a sense of direction.” I would take it one step further that if more men did their jobs our young men would not have targets on their backs and tomb stones over them. Personal Fears I fear for my son who is 17 years old, I fear that he may die before I do either at the hands of an overzealous service revolver or the hands of someone who looks like him, instead of a connection to possible violence there should be a connection of unity in celebrating brotherhood and culture. Searching for a cure to cancer, diabetes, heart defects, world peace, fighting poverty and hunger, these are the things I must teach him; to look over his shoulder, to be mindful that some officers see him as less than a man, a trouble maker, or possible drug dealer, a future criminal to be, instead of a young man with a bright future just as Sean Bell, Omar Edwards and DeAuntae Farrow and the others we may never know about. I fear I may not see him graduate from high school or college, I fear that because of imposed stereotypes of society he may not reach his destiny, but as his father it is my duty and responsibility to teach him and make sure he does get to where he needs to be in life. Evidence is seen Increasing Father Involvement by Brooke-Weiss, stated that, “Fathers provide emotional, spiritual, and financial involvement as a whole, bringing a stable environment to children allowing them to develop into productive adults and become successful in society in educational experiences.” The evidence is visible in our communities, in our schools, in our churches and on our streets. We put our young men’s lives at risk and others when we as men do not take the time or the opportunity to teach how to conduct them in public, to pull up their pants, to talk respectfully to women, to respect authority and act with intelligence and pride. Intelligence is not just in people with degrees, but those that strive to improve themselves, who are willing and eager to learn lessons of life to sur- vive, thrive and grow; those doing positive things in our communities, schools and churches, if many of our young men act like thugs and gansta’s then many will be treated as such and subjected to actions that prove deadly. Mr. Fullwood makes a valid point in his words, “I admit that being a black man in America or anywhere is hard, but again, that’s no excuse for not being apart of your child’s life.” Teach the Word Another important part of Ephesians 6:4 says, \"Bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord\" (NIV). Fathers teach your sons words that empower them with positive spiritual energies. Model and define a spirit and Word guided life. When they have the Word in them they will follow the Word. Teachers can’t teach it, the government can’t teach it, the media can’t teach it, but fathers can and must teach. Conclusion Pastor David Reagan (The Role of a Father), validates a man’s role in the home and in their children’s life with these comments, “It is due to the neglect, irresponsibility and selfishness of a father that the home does not feel his presence”. This lack of fatherly presence infests beyond our homes, but also our communities and our churches. It is past time for more fathers to stand up and make a commitment to their children.\n\n18. Micheal Vick Not Pursued, Even By the Sorriest Teams In The Legue Written by: Joey Za Za T here are no teams breaking their necks to pick up this NFL phenom. This is a suprise to me because most of the teams that are so agressively turning down Vick suck really bad. I am sorry for using the word \"suck\", but it is true: Redskins? U Suck! Dolphins? U Suck! Bengals? You know you U Suck! Buffalo Bills? U Suck very badly! Detroit? U are so sorry you don't even suck anymore and last but not lest San Fransisco? You suck so bad we even forget you guys are in the league. Yet and still this sorry ass teams have the nerve to \"toot\" up their noses at this \"STUD\"(a word recruiters use). The fact is Vick sells tickets, Vick can run, Vick can throw, the ladies love him, Las Vegas bookies adore him, the NFL fans deserve to have someone they can talk about on Monday morning at work and last but not least my son loves him. According to RACHEL COHEN, AP Sports Writer. Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday that Vick can immediately take part in preseason practices, workouts and meetings and can play in the final two preseason games—if he can find a team. Once the season begins, Vick may participate in all team activities except games, and Goodell said he would consider Vick for full reinstatement by Week 6 (Oct. 18-19) at the latest. Two clubs that might have seemed like a logical destination—the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals—said they wouldn’t pursue Vick. Bengals owner Mike Brown(notes) refers to himself as “a redeemer” and is known for giving troubled players a second chance, or more. But Cincinnati has a full complement of quarterbacks, and starter Carson Palmer(notes) has fully recovered from an elbow injury that sidelined him for 12 games last season. “When you have a situation like ours, he’s a very difficult fit,” Brown said. “Quarterbacks are like queen bees—you can only have one of them before they start stepping on each other. And we have ours. Carson’s the guy. That’s why it just doesn’t fit for here in a football sense.” The Dolphins rejuvenated their offense last season by mixing in the Wildcat, a variation of the single wing. The package featured direct long snaps to running back Ronnie Brown(notes), who usually ran with the ball. The Wildcat would take advantage of Vick’s running ability, but the Dolphins drafted another running quarterback in April: West Virginia’s Pat White(notes). They also have 2008 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Chad Pennington(notes) returning and promising Chad Henne(notes) as the No. 2 quarterback. “We don’t have an interest,” general manager Jeff Ireland said in a statement. “We like the players we have on our current roster.” Denver Broncos coach Josh McDaniels said “we’re not bringing him in right now,” but acknowledged the team is always weighing its options. The Broncos have uncertainty at quarterback after trading the disgruntled Jay Cutler(notes). Kyle Orton(notes) is penciled in as the starter. “We’re always going to try to do what’s best for the organization—that could mean it’s a player or a situation that we’re going to evaluate,” McDaniels said. “We’re always going to try to make sure that we leave no stone unturned. If it means adding a player, we have looked at every player that we feel out there could help us at this time.” One organization that wants Vick is the upstart UFL. The four-team league plans to kick off a six-game season in October. “I still think we are the best option for him,” UFL commissioner Michael Huyghue said. Huyghue suggested Vick could prove to NFL teams that he’s ready to return— on and off the field—during the UFL season. Buffalo Bills quarterback Trent Edwards(notes) figured Vick’s conditional status would leave general managers in a bind. “It’s got to be hard to sign him, because where are you going to put him?” he said. “You don’t know if he’ll be able to play Week 1, and you want him to be your starting quarterback or at least compete for a starting job, (but) you can’t essentially do that as a general manager.” (Resources: AP Sports Writers Pat Graham in Denver, Joe Kay in Cincinnati, Hank Kurz Jr. in Richmond, Va., John Wawrow in Pittsford, N.Y., and Steven Wine in Miami contributed to this report.) “We don’t have an interest,” general manager Jeff Ireland said in a statement. “We like the players we have on our current roster.”\n\n19.

I believe it was called Bad Boyz back then and to me there was something always different about you than the other barbers. What do you think it was? Ron: My Hunger and determination to be the best DS: After you left there you did something I could not believe. You actually opened up a barbershop inside Gold's Gym. Man that was a big deal to me. That was a bold move. Tell me what that was like.. Ron: I have always been a risk taker and gold's gym gave me the opportunity to start my own business, it allowed me to deal with people on higher levels and with more responsibility, it prepared me for the Next Level. DS: Did you always know that you would own your own barbershop? Ron: Yes, I always wanted to be my own boss and in control. DS: Was there ever a time that you thought to yourself, \"Man, I don't want to do this anymore.\" Ron: Yes, sometimes dealing with people, you don't always see eye to eye and you can get burned out. DS: After you moved from the gym did you go straight for your own shop or did you go back to cutting for someone else? Ron: After I outgrew the gym I moved the shop to a larger building and stayed there for three years, then, we outgrew that spot and now we have more space where we added a salon with some of the best stylists in the city. DS: When I was growing up. Most barbers were old men that wore Stacy Adams with jeans and they all smelled like Brut cologne. Could you tell me what is it like with this new generation of barbers? Ron: First of all, much respect to the old school barbers. The new generation of barbers are more likely to have a certain swag, they're fast pace, they're more into designs and different styles of cutting and they can put on a white Tee and a pairs J's and call it a day. DS: Now that you are the owner of a successful barbershop, is it hard to find and keep good talent in your shop? Ron: Yes, I had a good barber, he stepped out to open his own shop (Korey's Cuts), But I still have a talented group including one that I would put up against anybody in the city. DS: If you could remember, could you tell the readers one of your craziest moments as a barber or barbershop owner? Ron: I can't single out one because there are so many crazy moments, you might get anything at Next Level DS: Do you think people come to a barbershop for the great haircut they receive or the great atmosphere while they are waiting to get their hair cut? Ron: They are coming for both the atmosphere and a great hair cut, they can get a card game in, play chess, they can get on the pool table and go up against the best in the city, or they can sit back and relax and watch TV on the 72 in screen. They can get a cut on Tuesday and be back on Friday to join in on the topic of the day which can sometimes get heated. DS: You now have a partner in your business venture and you are one of the few people that actually have a clothing store connected to the barbershop. How did that come about? Ron: I started out only dealing in shoes, then I met BV through a mutual friend and he showed me how to take it to the Next Level by selling more than just shoes. DS: Do you have some shot outs on the way out the door buddy? Ron: First I want to thank God, the customers, my family, Everybody at Next Level Barbershop, the old Who'z Next crew (Jamal, Chuck, Huff and Ernest), Heaven on Earth Lawn Care, Dr. Mcgowan and family, Ray DS: When I first met you 3 years ago playa I thought to myself, \"O God, this n--ga here is to cool to be real.\" Hell, you was so cool I thought you was a New York pimp vacationing in Jacksonville. (Just kiddin) Wasup witcha? BV: Lol just chillin my dude,trying to get it in that's all. DS: Most New Yorker's are unbearable to be around because of the way y'all aggressively carry y'all self and talk among each other. You on the other hand, have been embraced in the urban community and have found success here in the south. Was your transition hard when you got into the fashion game in the south? BV: No not really because I didn't want to change what people where rockin down south I just wanted to add that up north favor down here and have it embraced. For the most part I've done that,to me the most important thing is to stay ahead of the game and keep some exclusive shit. Nobody likes to be in the club and have 5 n--gas with the same sh-t on. DS: Everyone remembers you from being in the flea market when you first started. You began to create a reputation of having the \"exclusive\" gear. Was having that type of reputation your main objective? BV: No doubt, I love to tell customers nobody else has this or that. Plus as you know I make alot of custom tee's and SWAGG shirts which I've been doing for like 5 years. Right now I working on my own line of tee's so be looking out for that. DS: How long have you been in the fashion business? BV: I've been into fashion my whole life but in the business for like the last 9 years. DS: When I was inside you & Ronnie's \"one stop shop\" I saw many people on your wall that were wearing your “SWAGGA” and promo shirts. It is rumored that you have done many of important people's promo shirts. Who all have you done stuff for? BV: I've done stuff for Bigga Rankin,who's been alot of help to me. Young Cash,Loyalty Entertainment,Hacksaw,Pit,D-Cap (Duk Won) I did custom Air Force 1's for Laveranues Coles. I am workin on some stuff for Co-Op Entertainment which is a company my son L is about to start so I am excited about that. DS: Everybody went crazy when Obama was elected. Wall Street even said that the elect of Obama sparked financial gain for the small business vendors that sale shirts and so on. What would you say to that? BV: That's a true statement,Obama being elected was historic and anytime you can be connected or make something that represents that moment,money can be made. Ronnie was on me hard about doing some Obama shirts lol DS: What kind of changes have you seen in fashion industry today that was not there when you first started? BV: To be honest my dude its the high end stuff that people want. N--gas want real sh-t! Before you could rock some fake sh-t and get away with it now ni-gas ain't tryin to hear it. DS: What is the hottest item for the summer in the retail business right now? BV: Its alot of hot stuff out right now,custom gear is always hot,anything Gucci,Louis Vuitton, or Prada. Rare and exclusive Air Force 1's just to name a few things. New Era hats are hot but you gotta step your game up and get them from their new web site which is www. I can't give it up like that come to the shop and get it! lol DS: I knew you were a good retail business man, but I really didn't know that you also were a barber too. Everybody knows that your son can cut hair real good. How long have you been cutting? BV: Not that long but I am trying to get it in my dude. Ronnie told me one time, to use every avenue you can and that's what I doin DS: How did you and Ronnie meet up to do a business venture? BV: We met doin some business with someone else and we clicked right off the bat. I rented some space from him when he was a few doors down from where we are now. Once this spot opened up we agreed to get it in together and here we are. The only place you can get a fresh cut and a hot fit for the club. DS: They say that partnerships are good to have, because two heads are better than one. Is that true? BV: Yes its true but were a team so we get input from everybody, the barbers and beauticians. DS: I realize this is a sensitive subject, but it is summer time and thing are about to heat up in the streets. You are a father. What do you have to say to the readers about the violence that is so commonly happening in our streets and how can we prevent it? BV: Its crazy in these streets but you can't let nothing stop you from doin what you want to do. You gotta stay positive. We always try and give back. We have had cookouts in Spring Park,given free haircuts,and clothes. DS: Well I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with Duval Streetz Newz.

A Survey For The Ladies, Answers Men Should Read W e decided to do a survey on what or how women think. Since the mind of a women is a total mystery to us all. I asked 10 women the same question and which ever answer that was received the most was the general answer that we reported. How long should a women wait to have sex with a man? Our survey says: Until she feels comfortable with the person. How long should a women wait to introduce their new boy-friend to their children? Our survey says: 6 months of steady dating Does size matter during intimacy? Our survey says: Hell yes it does! Absolutely. When a man cheats on you, if he says he is really sorry, do you think he will do it again? Our survey says: 9 times out of 10 he will do it again. Do men ever really know when his women is cheating? Our survey says: No they don't, because women never mix their story up. What is the number one hint that your man gives off that lets you know he wants to be intimate? Our survey says: He takes a shower, starts to talking and acting nice. When do you know your man is lying? Our survey says? When he gets mad at me asking a simple question I have to say that this was a very fun survey and we should do more like this in the future. It you would like to see a survey that you are interested in, please email us at duvalstreetznewz@yahoo.com. A Walk in the Life. Words of Damn Fool. D uval!! When will it stop man? I’m so tired of women screaming that good guy bull?&%$. I’ve been in 1001 relationships and that sh-- is like having a second job. It can be stressful unless you find the right person. Now, that don’t mean if you meet a chic and she gives it up on the first day you lock her down cuz you don’t know what the hell you’re getting. If she’s talking about whipping somebody’s ass and fu----g up their car then it might happen to you. I had a situation with a ghetto ass chic that came to my house, gave me some a--, then stole my camcorder and tried to sell it back to me. (JACKIE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE) Seems like a crack head move to me. “LOL”( Naw, just some petty sh--) But it’s just not women, it’s men too. It’s some stalking ass guys out there too. They call your phone at all times in the night, but can’t pay your phone bill and love to do drive by’s and pop ups. Just remember that these crazy ass relationships lead to other sh--. Like baby mommas and baby daddies. When you get married or have a baby by someone you take on their family also. So take a closer look and don’t let bull&*^! blind your outlook on life.

Many of my clients ask this question on a daily basis, “Does stress really thin your hair out?” Well, ladies and gentlemen the answer to this question is a firm “yes.” It’s no myth. Here’s why... Telogen Effluvium: Sudden stress related hair loss which appears as thinning throughout the whole scalp Telogen Effluvium occurs when sudden, severe, or prolonged stress causes an increase in the shedding of hair. In Telogen Effluvium a sudden or stressful event can cause the hair follicles to prematurely stop growing and enter into a resting phase. The hair will then stay in the resting phase for 3 months after which time a large amount of hair will shed. Often the person involved will have recovered from the event before the hair loss occurs. In most cases the hair loss is temporary and the hair soon recovers. However, in some cases the hair loss continues until the underlying cause is fixed or the stress source is resolved. Telogen Effluvium appears to affect more women than men due to hormonal fluctuations. Temporary hair loss can be caused by: Child Birth Pregnancy Terminantion’s Starting or Stopping Birth Control Pills Dieting Drugs Lack of Sleep Severe Emotional Stress Blood Pressure Medications Thyroid Imbalance Anemia Special Note: Hair loss after Child Birth: It is quite common for some women to experience some hair some hair loss approximately 3 months after childbirth. This hair loss is triggered by the sudden changes in hormone levels. Some statistics suggests a 30% of mothers lose hair during childbirth and others suggest a figure closer to 60%. Fortunately in most cases the hair will return to normal 9-12 months after the childs birth. Many women will notice that their hair is thicker and healthier during pregnancy; this is due to the increased levels of hormones estrogen and progesterone which cause more hair than normal to remain in the growth phase. When the child is born, however, many of the hair follicles that had delayed entering the resting phase will suddenly enter the resting phase due to the rapid drop in hormone levels. This resting phase causes massive hair shedding. So, get to know your body and create balance in your life because beautiful hair grows from the INSIDE OUT. PEKELA “PK” RILEY www.salonpk.com\n\n24. REGIONAL MUSIC NEWZ Hustle House Entertainment Staring In A Movie? Hustle House has done it again. It seems like they were chillin out from all the hype that they created a year ago. But I am here to tell you that these crazy mutha!@#$ have been working hard on the big screen. It has been reported that Hustle House Entertainment has several leading roles in the newly made film called, \"Queen Pin\". Ms. Dynasty plays the a lead role as well. What makes this movie so interesting is that Nephew, Hustle House's top gun on the mic, is playing Ms. Dynasty's boyfriend. This is all hear say, but as usual, Big L is always not far from the truth. Y'all make sure you keep a eye out for the movie. The Beef & The Beat Goes On!! Reggie, CEO of High Life Music and T-Roy have been nothing close to \"DULL\" in these recent days. Both of them seem to be firing back and forth at each other. Why? I am glad you asked. It is because they both CAN!! That's right they both have their own plate form, because they both have hot club nights in the city. Not to mention T-Roy has the #1 afternoon radio show in the city. This all came out of no where if you ask me. It was like one day they were cool and the next week they were going at it. So far this is what I have gathered: Reggie verbally attacked T-Roy on You-Tube about some personal stuff between them and then T-Roy responded back during one of the biggest parties in the city on a Friday Night @ Club Christopher's. This news was spreading faster than VD on a military base. Now before any of you start thinking stupid. T-Roy did not say anything about High Life Music on the air. This little thing is starting to fly around the city like a high-school rumor. People keep adding and taking away from the story. I have personally talked to both of them about the situation and they both feel strongly about their opinions of each other. I know alot more, but this is not the time to go into full detail of the story. I think we all need to get back to business. Can't we all just get along?.....I don't think so. So Y'all can stop calling the newspaper asking questions. This is all I have to say about it.......FOR NOW!! DJ GIT, DJ GIT. He Just Won't Stop Shooting Bullets!! He is like a Denis Rodman, Rush Lombar, 50 Cent, Keyshawn Johnson and any other type of controversial entity that is in our mist. All these people are rolled up into a 220lbs young man by the name of DJ Git. Git has verbally attacked damn near every highly regarded DJ in the city. He has voiced his opinion about Cool Running DJ's, DJ Chilly, T-Roy and many many more. When I asked him why? He gave me a surprising answer. He said, \"Although I say things towards these individuals I do on the other hand have the up most respect for what they have accomplished over the years. There is just a hungry new kid on the block.\" If anyone knows Gitt, you will know that he always is gonna say something that will shock your ears. He is a DJ at Lavilla three days a week, Shucker's and there is a small rumor that he may be trying to get a night at the Big Apple. We don't know why he is the way he is, but I think it's time to interview this fella and find out why he is so angry. So, his interview will be in the next issues to come.\n\n25.
