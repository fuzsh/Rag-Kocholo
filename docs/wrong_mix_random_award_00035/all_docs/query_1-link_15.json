        "text": "Grab your red and black learther jacket, and dance this fall!\n\nIf you're a fan of zombies and Michael Jackson, the semi-annual “ThrIller” flash mob has always been a really fun time. For several years, dozens of people have dressed up and made the road trip to boogie down to the iconic MJ smash hit.\n\nWe may be several months away from Halloween, but the word is out that the 11th \"Thriller Throwdown' will return after a break of a few years, at Portland's Moneument Square, on Friday, October 25th, at 5:30pm, so you can start making your plans early.\n\nGet your friends together in the square and watch the mob of ghouls and zombies recreate Michael Jackson’s iconic music video. And since it takes place on a Friday night, there will be plenty of partying to do afterwards.\n\nWanna be a zombie dancer that day? You can register to participate in a Thriller class series.\n\nThe choreography is taught in an easy way, so even if you aren't much of a dancer, you can do the moves with confidence.\n\nEach class is supplemented with video tutorials, and are limited to dancers ages 12 and up. They will be held at the South Portland Community Center, 21 Nelson Road in South Portland.\n\nYou can find more info on the Thriller classes here\n\nAs a young kid, I have very vivid memories of MTV playing the video at the top of EVERY HOUR when it came out. That’s how popular it was. It was the 7th single from the album, which is unprecedented!\n\nIn the video, Jackson becomes a zombie and performs a dance routine with a horde of the undead. Many elements of the video have had a lasting impact on popular culture, such as the zombie dance and Jackson's red jacket. It’s generally considered the greatest video of all-time, That’s why 40 years later, people still celebrate it."
