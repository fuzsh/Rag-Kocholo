Blige\n\nOne sentence synopsis:\nSkye lives her life freely and without anything holding her back, that is until one day a young girl finds her and tell her she‚Äôs ‚Äúher egg‚Äù from an egg donation she made many years ago. \n\nBook Review:\nThis was pretty good. It took me a little while to get into but once I got the flow it was great. This is one of those books that has a lot of things and themes going on. And normally I would say it should pick one and go with it but somehow they all work together in this book. \n\nWe have a black lgbtq character, some romance, some self reflection and growth, found family, and complex family dynamics. And it was funny! I really appreciated the humor the author brought to the story while reading about the main character‚Äôs own trauma. \n\nAt times the writing did feel flat but that was ok. The story carried the book. \n\nThis was a unique book and would be great for group discussion. It‚Äôs a really good ‚Äúput yourself in someone else‚Äôs shoes‚Äù book.\".",
