        "text": "But when he first proposed the subject of his latest book, the hip-hop producer J Dilla, some were skeptical.\n\n“If you were my client, I would have told you not to do it,” a friend who happens to be a high-powered agent recently told Charnas. How many ordinary people who aren’t hip-hop fanatics know who J Dilla was?\n\nBut Charnas is having the last laugh. Published in February, “Dilla Time: The Life and Afterlife of J Dilla, the Hip-Hop Producer Who Reinvented Rhythm” has risen as high as No. 4 on the New York Times Best Sellers list. It’s already in its fourth printing.\n\nCharnas returns to Boston Monday for an event at WBUR CitySpace. For him, Commonwealth Ave. will feel like Memory Lane.\n\n“I know I’m gonna cry when I get there,” he says.\n\n“Dilla Time” traces the influence of James Yancey from his early work with A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Erykah Badu to his premature death in 2006 of complications from lupus, and beyond.\n\nDuring his short life, Dilla knew he was changing the game, Charnas says. But he didn’t quite have the words for it.\n\n“He didn’t articulate a grand theory or an M.O. I don’t think he grasped how big an innovation it was. I just think he knew he had a sound, it was unique, and he had influence.”\n\nCharnas’s book charts the curious history of Detroit (his wife’s family is from the area) and how Dilla was a product of the city as surely as Motown.\n\nEven some of Dilla’s biggest fans called his style of beatmaking “sloppy,” Charnas says.\n\n“That always drove me nuts. What he did on the drum machine, he actually did very scientifically. I’ve seen his notebooks. He was a list maker, and he was an Aquarius. I thought Virgos are supposed to make the lists!”\n\nAs Charnas describes in the book, Dilla’s sound has been everywhere in pop music over the past quarter-century, from the Roots and Michael Jackson’s last album to Robert Glasper and Kendrick Lamar. Boston, Charnas notes, was the first city to celebrate Dilla’s work in a conservatory setting, when Berklee professor Brian “Raydar” Ellis established the J Dilla Ensemble.\n\n“He’s your favorite artist’s favorite artist,” Charnas says. “Or as Questlove would say, ‘He’s the musician’s musician’s musician.’ ”\n\n“Dilla Time” author Dan Charnas appears at WBUR CitySpace, 890 Commonwealth Ave., June 6 at 6:30 p.m. Tickets $5-$25. www.wbur.org/events"
