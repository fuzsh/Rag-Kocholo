And he knows it.\" Throughout a prolific array of novels, short stories, and screen work in which elements of horror, fantasy, science fiction, and humor meld, King deftly arouses fear from dormancy. The breadth and durability of his popularity alone evince his mastery as a compelling storyteller. \"Nothing is as unstoppable as one of King's furies, except perhaps King's word processor,\" remarked Gil Schwartz in People, which selected King as one of twenty individuals who had defined the decade of the Eighties. And although the critical reception of his work has not necessarily matched its sweeping success with readers, colleagues and several critics alike discern within it a substantial and enduring literary legitimacy. In American Film, for instance, Darrell Ewing and Dennis Meyers called him \"the chronicler of contemporary America's dreams, desires, and fears.\"\n\nWhile striking a deep and responsive chord within its readers, the genre of horror is frequently trivialized by critics who tend to regard it, when at all, less seriously than mainstream fiction. In an interview with Charles Platt in Dream Makers: The Uncommon Men and Women Who Write Science Fiction, King suspected that \"most of the critics who review popular fiction have no understanding of it as a whole.\" Regarding the \"propensity of a small but influential element of the literary establishment to ghettoize horror and fantasy and instantly relegate them beyond the pale of so-called serious literature,\" King told Eric Norden in a Playboy interview, \"I'm sure those critics' nineteenth-century precursors would have contemptuously dismissed [Edgar Allan] Poe as the great American hack.\" But as King contends in \"The Horror Writer and the Ten Bears,\" his foreword to Kingdom of Fear: \"Horror isn't a hack market now, and never was. The genre is one of the most delicate known to man, and it must be handled with great care and more than a little love.\" Furthermore, in a panel discussion at the 1984 World Fantasy Convention in Ottawa, reprinted in Bare Bones: Conversations on Terror with Stephen King, he predicted that horror writers \"might actually have a serious place in American literature in a hundred years or so.\"\n\nKing's ability to comprehend \"the attraction of fantastic horror to the denizen of the late twentieth century,\" according to Deborah L. Notkin in Fear Itself, partially accounts for his unrivaled popularity in the genre. But what distinguishes him is the way in which he transforms the ordinary into the horrific. Pointing out in the Atlantic Monthly that horror frequently represents \"the symbolic depiction of our common experience,\" Lloyd Rose observed that \"King takes ordinary emotional situations—marital stress, infidelity, peer-group-acceptance worries—and translates them into violent tales of vampires and ghosts. He writes supernatural soap operas.\" But to Gary Williams Crawford in Discovering Stephen King, King is \"a uniquely sensitive author\" within the Gothic literary tradition, which he described as \"essentially a literature of nightmare, a conflict between waking life and the darkness within the human mind.\" Perpetuating the legacy of Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Henry James, and H. P. Lovecraft, \"King is heir to the American Gothic tradition in that he has placed his horrors in contemporary settings and has depicted the struggle of an American culture to face the horrors within it,\" explained Crawford, and because \"he has shown the nightmare of our idealistic civilization.\" Observing that children suspend their disbelief easily, King argued in his Danse Macabre that, ironically, they are actually \"better able to deal with fantasy and terror on its own terms than their elders are.\" In an interview for High Times, for instance, he marveled at the resilience of a child's mind and the inexplicable, yet seemingly harmless, attraction of children to nightmare-inducing stories: \"We start kids off on things like 'Hansel and Gretel,' which features child abandonment, kidnapping, attempted murder, forcible detention, cannibalism, and finally murder by cremation. And the kids love it.\" Adults are capable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality, but in the process of growing up, laments King in Danse Macabre, they develop \"a good case of mental tunnel vision and a gradual ossification of the imaginative faculty\"; thus, he perceives the task of the fantasy or horror writer as enabling one to become \"for a little while, a child again.\" In Time King discussed the prolonged obsession with childhood that his generation has had. \"We went on playing for a long time, almost feverishly,\" he recalled. \"I write for that buried child in us, but I'm writing for the grown-up too. I want grown-ups to look at the child long enough to be able to give him up.\"\n\nThe empowerment of estranged young people is a theme that recurs throughout King's fiction. \"If Stephen King's kids have one thing in common,\" declared young-adult novelist Robert Cormier in the Washington Post Book World, \"it's the fact that they all are losers. In a way, all children are losers, of course—how can they be winners with that terrifying adult world stacked against them?\" His first novel, Carrie, is about a persecuted teenaged girl. \"The novel examines female power,\" stated Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor Carol Senf, \"for Carrie gains her telekinetic abilities with her first menstruation.\" \"It is,\" Senf concluded, \"a compelling character study of a persecuted teenager who finally uses her powers to turn the table on her persecutors. The result is a violent explosion that destroys the mother who had taught her self-hatred and the high-school peers who had made her a scapegoat.\" An alienated teenaged boy is the main character in King's Christine, and Rage features Charlie Decker, a young man who tells the story of his descent into madness and murder. In The Shining and Firestarter, Danny Torrance and Charlie McGee are alienated not from their families—they have loving, if sometimes weak, parents—but through the powers they possess and by those who want to manipulate them: evil supernatural forces in The Shining, the U.S. Government in Firestarter. Children also figure prominently, although not always as victims, in Salem's Lot, The Tommyknockers, Pet Sematary, The Eyes of the Dragon, and The Talisman.\n\nKing's most explicit examination of alienation in childhood, however, comes in the novel It. The eponymous IT is a creature that feeds on children—on their bodies and on their emotions, especially fear. IT lives in the sewers of Derry, Maine, having arrived there ages ago from outer space, and emerges about every twenty-seven years in search of victims. \"It begins, demonically enough, in 1957,\" explained New York Review of Books contributor Thomas R. Edwards, \"when a six-year-old boy has his arm torn off by what appears to be a circus clown lurking down a storm drain…. King organizes the tale as two parallel stories, one tracing the activities of seven unprepossessing fifth-graders—'The Losers' Club'—who discovered and fought the horror in 1958, the other describing their return to Derry in 1985 when the cycle resumes.\" The surviving members of the Losers' Club return to Derry to confront IT and defeat IT once and for all. The only things that appears to hurt IT are faith, humor, and childlike courage. \"Only brave and imaginative children, or adults who learn to remember and honor their childish selves,\" Edwards concluded, \"can hope to foil It, as the Losers finally do in 1985.\"\n\n\"It involves the guilts and innocences of childhood and the difficulty for adults of recapturing them,\" Christopher Lehmann-Haupt stated in the New York Times. \"It questions the difference between necessity and free will. It also concerns the evil that has haunted America from time to time in the forms of crime, racial and religious bigotry, economic hardship, labor strife and industrial pollution.\" The evil takes shape among Derry's adults and older children, especially the bullies who terrorize the members of the Losers' Club.\n\nNot surprisingly, throughout most of King's adolescence, the written word afforded a powerful diversion. \"Writing has always been it for me,\" King indicated in a panel discussion at the 1984 World Fantasy Convention in Ottawa, reprinted in Bare Bones. Science fiction and adventure stories comprised his first literary efforts. Having written his first story at the age of seven, King began submitting short fiction to magazines at twelve, and published his first story at eighteen. In high school, he authored a small, satiric newspaper titled \"The Village Vomit\"; and in college he penned a popular and eclectic series of columns called \"King's Garbage Truck.\" He also started writing the novels he eventually published under the pseudonymous ruse of Richard Bachman—novels that focus more on elements of human alienation and brutality than supernatural horror. After graduation, King supplemented his teaching salary through various odd jobs and by submitting stories to men's magazines. Searching for a form of his own, and responding to a friend's challenge to break out of the machismo mold of his short fiction, King wrote what he described to Abe Peck in Rolling Stone College Papers as \"a parable of women's consciousness.\" Re-trieving the discarded manuscript from the trash, though, King's wife, Tabitha, who is a writer herself, suggested that he ought to expand it. And because King completed the first draft of Carrie at the time William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist and Thomas Tryon's The Other were being published, the novel was marketed as horror fiction, and the genre had found its juggernaut. Or, as Don Herron put it in Fear Itself, \"Like a mountain, King is there.\"\n\n\"Stephen King has made a dent in the national consciousness in a way no other horror writer has, at least during his own lifetime,\" stated Alan Warren in Discovering Stephen King. \"He is a genuine phenomenon.\" A newsletter—\"Castle Rock\"—has been published since 1985 to keep his ever-increasing number of fans well informed; and Book-of-the-Month Club has been reissuing all of his best-sellers as the Stephen King Library collection. In his preface to Fear Itself, \"On Becoming a Brand Name,\" King described the process as a fissional one in that a \"writer produces a series of books which ricochet back and forth between hardcover and softcover at an ever increasing speed.\" Resorting to a pseudonym to get even more work into print accelerated the process for King; but according to Stephen P. Brown in Kingdom of Fear, although the ploy was not entirely \"a vehicle for King to move his earliest work out of the trunk,\" it certainly triggered myriad speculations about, as well as hunts for, other possible pseudonyms he may also have used. In his essay \"Why I Was Bachman\" in The Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by Stephen King, King recalled that he simply considered it a good idea at the time, especially since he wanted to try to publish something without the attendant commotion that a Stephen King title would have unavoidably generated. Also, his publisher believed that he had already saturated the market. King's prodigious literary output and multimillion-dollar contracts, though, have generated critical challenges to the inherent worth of his fiction. Deducing that he has been somehow compromised by commercial success, some critics imply that he writes simply to fulfill contractual obligations. But as King told Norden, \"Money really has nothing to do with it one way or the other. I love writing the things I write, and I wouldn't and 'couldn't' do anything else.\"\n\nKing writes daily, exempting only Christmas, the Fourth of July, and his birthday. He likes to work on two things simultaneously, beginning his day early with a two-or three-mile walk: \"What I'm working on in the morning is what I'm working on,\" he said in a panel discussion at the 1980 World Fantasy Convention in Baltimore, reprinted in Bare Bones. He devotes his afternoon hours to rewriting. And according to his Playboy interview, while he is not particular about working conditions, he is about his output. Despite chronic headaches, occasional insomnia, and even a fear of writer's block, he produces six pages daily; \"And that's like engraved in stone,\" he told Joyce Lynch Dewes Moore in Mystery.\n\nAware that \"people want to be scared,\" as he related to Abe Peck in a Rolling Stone College Papers interview, and truly delighted to be able to accommodate them, King rejects the criticism that he preys on the fears of others. As he explained to Jack Matthews in a Detroit Free Press interview, some people simply avoid his books just as those who are afraid of speed and heights, especially in tandem, shun roller coasters. And that, he declared to Paul Janeczko in English Journal, is precisely what he believes he owes his readers—\"a good ride on the roller coaster.\" Regarding what he finds to be an essential reassurance that underlies and impels the genre itself, King remarked in Danse Macabre that \"beneath its fangs and fright wig\" horror fiction is really quite conservative. Comparing horror fiction with the morality plays of the late middle ages, for instance, he believes that its primary function is \"to reaffirm the virtues of the norm by showing us what awful things happen to people who venture into taboo lands.\" Also, there is the solace in knowing \"when the lights go down in the theatre or when we open the book that the evildoers will almost certainly be punished, and measure will be returned for measure.\" But King admitted to Norden that despite all the discussion by writers generally about \"horror's providing a socially and psychologically useful catharsis for people's fears and aggressions, the brutal fact of the matter is that we're still in the business of public executions.\"\n\n\"Death is a significant element in nearly all horror fiction,\" wrote Michael A. Morrison in Fantasy Review, \"and it permeates King's novels and short stories.\" Noting in Danse Macabre that a universal fear with which each of us must personally struggle is \"the fear of dying,\" King explained to Bob Spitz in a Penthouse magazine interview that \"everybody goes out to horror movies, reads horror novels—and it's almost as though we're trying to preview the end.\" But he submitted that \"if the horror story is our rehearsal for death, then its strict moralities make it also a reaffirmation of life and good will and simple imagination—just one more pipeline to the infinite.\" While he believes that horror is \"one of the ways we walk our imagination,\" as he told Matthews, he does worry about the prospect of a mentally unstable reader patterning behavior after some fictional brutality. Remarking that \"evil is basically stupid and unimaginative and doesn't need creative inspiration from me or anybody else,\" King told Norden, for in-stance, that \"despite knowing all that rationally, I have to admit that it is unsettling to feel that I could be linked in any way, however tenuous, to somebody else's murder.\"\n\nAn example of King's ability to \"pour new wine from old bottles\" is his experimentation with narrative structure. In It, Carrie, and The Stand, declared Tony Magistrale in the study Landscape of Fear: Stephen King's American Gothic, King explores story forms—\"stream of consciousness, interior monologues, multiple narrators, and a juggling of time sequences—in order to draw the reader into a direct and thorough involvement with the characters and events of the tale.\" Both The Dark Half and Misery, according to George Stade in the New York Times Book Review, are \"parable[s] in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience.\" In Gerald's Game's Jessie Burlingame has lost her husband to heart failure. He \"has died after handcuffing her to the bed at their summer home,\" Senf explained in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \"and Jessie must face her life, including the memory that her father had sexually abused her, and her fears alone.\" Dolores Claiborne is the story of a woman suspected of murdering her employer, a crusty old miser named Vera Donovan. Dolores maintains her innocence, but she freely confesses that she murdered her husband thirty years previously when she caught him molesting their daughter.\n\n\"There are a series of dovetailing, but unobtrusive, connections,\" stated Locus contributor Edward Bryant, \"linking the two novels and both Jessie and Dolores.\" Like It, both Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne are set in the town of Derry, Maine. They are also both psychological portraits of older women who have been subjected to sexual abuse. Dolores Claiborne differs from Gerald's Game, however, because it uses fewer of the traditional trappings of horror fiction, and it is related entirely from the viewpoint of the title character. Dolores Claiborne \"is, essentially, a dramatic monologue,\" stated Kit Reed in the Washington Post Book World, \"in which the speaker addresses other people in the room, answers questions and completes a narrative in actual time.\" \"All but the last page is one long quote from Dolores Claiborne,\" asserted a Rapport reviewer. \"King has taken horror literature out of the closet and has injected new life into familiar genres,\" Senf concluded. \"He is not afraid to mix those genres in fresh ways to produce novels that examine contemporary American culture.\"\n\nInsomnia, King's 1994 novel, continues the example set by Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne. It is also set in Derry, and its protagonist is an elderly man named Ralph Roberts, a retired salesman, newly widowed and suffering severely from insomnia. Ralph begins to see people in a new way: their auras become visible to him. \"Ralph finds himself a man in a classic situation, a mortal in conflict with the fates—literally,\" declared Locus reviewer Bryant. \"How much self-determination does he really possess? And how much is he acted upon?\" Ralph also finds himself in conflict with his neighbor Ed Deepeneau, a conservative Christian and antiabortion activist who beats his wife and has taken up a crusade against a visiting feminist speaker. \"There are some truly haunting scenes in the book about wife abuse and fanaticism, as well as touching observations about growing old, but they're quickly consumed by more predictable sensationalism,\" remarked Chris Bohjalian in the New York Times Book Review. \"In a world teeming with timeless, omnipotent entities,\" declared novelist Kinky Friedman in the Washington Post Book World, \"King has provided Ralph Roberts, that ancient vulnerable, white-haired widower, with the ultimate weapon, the power of the human spirit.\"\n\nKing delighted his readers and astounded his critics by issuing three new major novels in 1996: Desperation, The Regulators—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman—and The Green Mile, the last a Depression-era prison novel serialized in six installments. A Publishers Weekly reviewer said that \"if the publishing industry named a Person of the Year, this year's winner would be Stephen King.\" The critic noted that, with Desperation, \"King again proves himself the premier literary barometer of our cultural clime.\" Released on the same day from two different publishers, Desperation and The Regulators have interlocking characters and plots; each works as a kind of distorted mirror image of the other. In Desperation, which many critics agree is the better book, a group of strangers drive into Desperation, Nevada, where they encounter a malign spirit (Tak) in the body of police officer Collie Entragian. The survivors of this apocalyptic novel are few, but include David Carver, an eleven-year-old boy who talks to God, and John Edward Marinville, an alcoholic novelist. Robert Polito, writing for the New York Times, noted that \"King's peculiar knack as a novelist is to strip away much of the complexity and nearly all of the art from a terrifying vision of an unknowable universe ruled by a limited, perhaps evil God and insinuate that Gnosticism into the rituals and commodities of everyday America.\" Polito admired King's capacity to tap into the collective unconscious of America at the end of the millennium but regretted that \"the recurrent silliness shrugs off the horror and the social anger.\" Mark Harris, writing for Entertainment Weekly, however, remarked that King \"hasn't been this intent on scaring readers—or been this successful at it—since The Stand,\" noting that \"King has always been pop fiction's most compassionate sadist.\" In Desperation, King grapples with the nature of God, but Polito claimed that the \"bromide\" that \"God is Love\" can't dispel the novel's dark and cruel vision of the universe. King recorded the audio version of Desperation himself.\n\nWhile The Regulators received little critical praise, King's experiment in serialization with The Green Mile captured the imagination of both readers and critics. An Entertainment Weekly reviewer called it a novel \"that's as hauntingly touching as it is just plain haunted,\" and a New York Times contributor claimed that in spite of \"the striking circumstances of its serial publication,\" the novel \"manages to sustain the notes of visceral wonder and indelible horror that keep eluding the Tak books.\" Set in the Deep South in 1932, The Green Mile—a prison expression for death row—begins with the death of twin girls and the conviction of John Coffey for their murder. Block superintendent Paul Edgecombe, who narrates the story years later from his nursing home in Georgia, slowly unfolds the story of the mysterious Coffey, a man with no past and with a gift for healing.\n\nKing's next major novel, Bag of Bones, appeared in 1998. This tale of a writer struggling with both grief for his dead wife and writer's block while living in a haunted cabin met with a great deal of acclaim from critics. Also acclaimed was the following year's Hearts in Atlantis, which Tom De Haven described in Entertainment Weekly as \"a novel in five stories, with players sometimes migrating from one story to the next.\" De Haven went on to note that \"there's more heartbreak than horror in these pages, and a doomy aura that's more generational than occult.\" He also reported that the \"last two stories are drenched in sadness, mortality, regret, and finally absolution,\" concluding that Hearts in Atlantis \"is wonderful fiction.\" Similarly, Ray Olson praised the volume in Booklist as \"a rich, engaging, deeply moving generational epic.\" The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon also saw print in 1999. This novel, short by King's standards, centers on a nine-year-old girl from a broken home who gets lost in a forest for two weeks. She has her radio with her, and survives her ordeal by listening to Boston Red Sox games and imagining conversations with her hero, Red Sox relief pitcher Tom Gordon.\n\nWhile these books were making their way to readers, however, King suffered a serious health challenge. On June 19, 1999, he was struck by a van while walking alongside a road near his home, sustaining injuries to his spine, hip, ribs, and right leg. One of his broken ribs punctured a lung, and he nearly died. He began a slow progress towards recovery, cheered by countless cards and letters from his fans. During his recovery, he began experimenting with publishing his fiction electronically. In August, 2000, King self-published the first two installments of his e-book The Plant on his Web site. Pricing the installments at one dollar each, King promised to publish additional chapters if at least 75 percent of those who download the first two installments paid for them. King also published a short story, \"Riding the Bullet,\" in March, only distributed as an e-book publication in a number of formats. This tale was eventually reprinted in the 2002 collection Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales.\n\nKing had also begun work on a writer's manual before his accident, and the result, 2000's On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, sold more copies in its first printing than any previous book about writing. In addition to King's advice on crafting fiction, however, the book includes a great deal of autobiographical material. The author chronicles his childhood, his rise to fame, his struggles with addiction, and the horrific accident that almost ended his life. \"King's writing about his own alcoholism and cocaine abuse,\" noted John Mark Eberhart in the Kansas City Star, \"is among the best and most honest prose of his career.\" Similarly, Jack Harville reported in the Charlotte Observer that \"the closing piece describes King's accident and rehabilitation. The description is harrowing, and the rehab involves both physical and emotional recovery. It is beautifully told in a narrative style that would have gained Strunk and White's approval.\" Some of the novels King has published since the beginning of the twenty-first century, including Dreamcatcher and From a Buick 8, have brought strong comparisons from critics with his earlier novels; in these specific cases, It and Christine, respectively. These books, however, were followed by an announcement King made in 2002 that he is planning to retire from publishing. In an interview with Chris Nashawaty in Entertainment Weekly, King clarified, \"First of all, I'd never stop writing because I don't know what I'd do between nine and one every day. But I'd stop publishing. I don't need the money.\" Yet Dream-catcher and From a Buick 8 have garnered praise from reviewers as well. Rene Rodriguez in the Miami Herald maintained that \"Dreamcatcher marks [King's] bracing return to all-out horror, complete with trademark grisly gross-outs, a panoramic cast of deftly drawn characters and a climactic race against time, with the fate of the planet hanging in the balance.\" Salem Macknee in the Charlotte Observer, noting surface similarities between From a Buick 8 and Christine, assured readers that \"this strange counterfeit of a Buick Roadmaster is no rerun. Stephen King has once again created an original, a monster never seen before, with its own frightful fingerprint.\"\n\nKing also received a great deal of praise for Everything's Eventual. Among other stories, the collection includes a few that he previously published in the New Yorker. Notable among these is \"The Man in the Black Suit,\" which won the 1996 O. Henry Award for best short story and brought King comparisons with great nineteenth-century American fiction writer Nathaniel Hawthorne. \"As a whole,\" concluded Rodriguez in another Miami Herald review, \"Everything's Eventual makes a perfect showcase for all of King's strengths: His uncanny talent for creating vivid, fully realized characters in a few strokes, his ability to mine horror out of the mundane,… and his knack for leavening even the most preposterous contraptions with genuine, universal emotions.\"\n\nAlthough he does not necessarily feel that he has been treated unfairly by the critics, King has described what it is like to witness the written word turned into filmed images that are less than generously received by reviewers. \"Whenever I publish a book, I feel like a trapper caught by the Iroquois,\" he told Peck in Rolling Stone College Papers. \"They're all lined up with tomahawks, and the idea is to run through with your head down, and everybody gets to take a swing…. Finally, you get out the other side and you're bleeding and bruised, and then it gets turned into a movie, and you're there in front of the same line and everybody's got their tomahawks out again.\" Nevertheless, in his essay \"Why I Was Bachman,\" he readily admitted that he really has little to complain about: \"I'm still married to the same woman, my kids are healthy and bright, and I'm being well paid for doing something I love.\" And despite the financial security and recognition, or perhaps because of its intrinsic responsibility, King strives to improve at his craft. \"It's getting later and I want to get better, because you only get so many chances to do good work,\" he stated in a panel discussion at the 1984 World Fantasy Convention in Ottawa. \"There's no justification not to at least try to do good work when you make the money.\"\n\nAccording to Warren in Discovering Stephen King, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that success has been detrimental to King: \"As a novelist, King has been remarkably consistent.\" Noting, for instance, that \"for generations it was given that brevity was the soul of horror, that the ideal format for the tale of terror was the short story,\" Warren pointed out that \"King was among the first to challenge that concept, writing not just successful novels of horror, but long novels.\" Moreover, said Warren, \"his novels have gotten longer.\" King once quipped in the Chicago Tribune Magazine that his \"philosophy has always been take a good thing and beat it 'til it don't move no more.\" Although some critics fault him for overwriting, Warren suggested that \"the sheer scope and ambitious nature of his storytelling demands a broad canvas.\" Referring to this as \"the very pushiness of his technique,\" the New York Times' Lehmann-Haupt similarly contended that \"the more he exasperates us by overpreparing, the more effectively his preparations eventually pay off.\"\n\nInfluenced by the naturalistic novels of writers such as Theodore Dreiser and Frank Norris, King confessed to Janeczko that his personal outlook for the world's future is somewhat bleak. On the other hand, one of the things he finds most comforting in his own work is an element of optimism. \"In almost all cases, I've begun with a premise that was really black,\" he said in a panel discussion at the 1980 World Fantasy Convention in Baltimore, reprinted in Bare Bones. \"And a more pleasant resolution has forced itself upon that structure.\" But as Andrew M. Greeley maintained in Kingdom of Fear: \"Unlike some other horror writers who lack his talents and sensitivity, Stephen King never ends his stories with any cheap or easy hope. People are badly hurt, they suffer and some of them die, but others survive the struggle and manage to grow. The powers of evil have not yet done them in.\" According to Notkin, though, the reassurance King brings to his own readers derives from a basic esteem for humanity itself: \"For whether he is writing about vampires, about the death of 99 percent of the population, or about innocent little girls with the power to break the earth in half, King never stops emphasizing his essential liking for people.\"\n\n\"There's unmistakable genius in Stephen King,\" admitted Walter Kendrick in the Village Voice, adding that he writes \"with such fierce conviction, such blind and brutal power, that no matter how hard you fight—and needless to say, I fought—he's irresistible.\" The less reserved critical affirmations of King's work extend from expressions of pragmatism to those of metaphor. Lehmann-Haupt, for example, a self-professed King addict, offered his evaluation of King's potential versus his accomplishments as a writer of horror fiction: \"Once again, as I edged myself nervously toward the climax of one of his thrillers, I found myself considering what Stephen King could accomplish if he would only put his storytelling talents to serious use. And then I had to ask myself: if Mr. King's aim in writing … was not entirely serious by some standard that I was vaguely invoking, then why, somebody please tell me, was I holding on to his book so hard that my knuckles had begun to turn white?\" Douglas E. Winter assessed King's contribution to the genre in his study Stephen King: The Art of Darkness this way: \"Death, destruction, and destiny await us all at the end of the journey—in life as in horror fiction. And the writer of horror stories serves as the boatman who ferries people across that Reach known as the River Styx…. In the horror fiction of Stephen King, we can embark upon the night journey, make the descent down the dark hole, cross that narrowing Reach, and return again in safety to the surface—to the near shore of the river of death. For our boatman has a master's hand.\"\n\nWhile King has played with the idea of giving up publishing his writings, his legion of fans continues to be delighted that the idea has not yet become a reality. In 2004, under the pseudonym of Eleanor Druse, King published The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident. He has also continued with his \"Dark Tower\" series (the illustrated novels featuring Roland the gunslinger) with the publication of The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla in 2003. The book was published more than five years after the publication of the previous installment in the series, The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass. King also completed the final two installments of the series in 2004, including The Dark Tower VI: The Songs of Susannah and The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower. In a surprise for fans, King introduced himself as a character in the sixth installment, which a Publishers Weekly reviewer called a \"gutsy move\" and commented, \"that way there's no denying the ingenuity with which King paints a candid picture of himself.\"\n\nIn 2004, King varied a bit from his usual formula to write, in conjunction with Stewart O'Nan, a nonfiction book about one of his great loves, the Boston Red Sox. When the two authors began keeping diaries of every team-related moment in the year, Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season was originally expected to be the story of yet another disappointing season for fans of the seemingly cursed team. Instead the Red Sox won the World Series that season for the first time in eighty-six years.\n\nWith Cell, a 2006 novel that Booklist contributor Ray Olson considered \"the most suspenseful, fastest-paced book King has ever written,\" the author uses cell phone signals as a source for inducing zombie-like violence in the majority of the population. A Publishers Weekly reviewer found \"King's imagining … rich,\" and the dialogue \"jaunty and witty\" in this novel that borrows technique from Richard Matheson and George A.

And he knows it.\" Throughout a prolific array of novels, short stories, and screen work in which elements of horror, fantasy, science fiction, and humor meld, King deftly arouses fear from dormancy. The breadth and durability of his popularity alone evince his mastery as a compelling storyteller. Although the critical reception of his work has not necessarily matched its sweeping success with readers, colleagues and several critics alike discern within it a substantial and enduring literary legitimacy.\n\nWhile striking a deep and responsive chord within its readers, the genre of horror is frequently trivialized by critics who tend to regard it, when at all, less seriously than mainstream fiction. In an interview with Charles Platt in Dream Makers: The Uncommon Men andWomen Who Write Science Fiction, King suspected that \"most of the critics who review popular fiction have no understanding of it as a whole.\" Regarding the \"propensity of a small but influential element of the literary establishment to ghettoize horror and fantasy and instantly relegate them beyond the pale of so-called serious literature,\" King told Eric Norden in a Playboy interview: \"I'm sure those critics' nineteenth-century precursors would have contemptuously dismissed [Edgar Allan] Poe as the great American hack.\" In a panel discussion at the 1984 World Fantasy Convention in Ottawa, reprinted in Bare Bones: Conversations on Terror with Stephen King, he predicted that horror writers \"might actually have a serious place in American literature in a hundred years or so.\"\n\nKing's ability to comprehend \"the attraction of fantastic horror to the denizen of the late twentieth century,\" according to a contributor to Fear Itself, partially accounts for his unrivaled popularity in the genre. However, what distinguishes him is the way in which he transforms the ordinary into the horrific. A contributor to Discovering Stephen King wrote that King is \"a uniquely sensitive author\" within the Gothic literary tradition, which he described as \"essentially a literature of nightmare, a conflict between waking life and the darkness within the human mind.\" Perpetuating the legacy of Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Henry James, and H.P. Lovecraft, \"King is heir to the American Gothic tradition in that he has placed his horrors in contemporary settings and has depicted the struggle of an American culture to face the horrors within it,\" explained Crawford, and because \"he has shown the nightmare of our idealistic civilization.\" Observing that children suspend their disbelief easily, King argued in his Danse Macabre that, ironically, they are actually \"better able to deal with fantasy and terror on its own terms than their elders are.\" Adults are capable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality, but in the process of growing up, laments King in Danse Macabre, they develop \"a good case of mental tunnel vision and a gradual ossification of the imaginative faculty\"; thus, he perceives the task of the fantasy or horror writer as enabling one to become \"for a little while, a child again.\"\n\nThe empowerment of estranged young people is a theme that recurs throughout King's fiction. His first novel, Carrie: A Novel of a Girl with a Frightening Power, is about a persecuted teenaged girl. \"The novel examines female power,\" stated a Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor, \"for Carrie gains her telekinetic abilities with her first menstruation.\" \"It is,\" the contributor noted, \"a compelling character study of a persecuted teenager who finally uses her powers to turn the table on her persecutors. The result is a violent explosion that destroys the mother who had taught her self-hatred and the high-school peers who had made her a scapegoat.\" An alienated teenaged boy is the main character in King's Christine, and Rage features Charlie Decker, a young man who tells the story of his descent into madness and murder. In The Shining and Firestarter, Danny Torrance and Charlie McGee are alienated not from their families—they have loving, if sometimes weak, parents—but through the powers they possess and by those who want to manipulate them: evil supernatural forces in The Shining, the U.S. Government in Firestarter. Children also figure prominently, although not always as victims, in Salem's Lot, The Tommyknockers, Pet Sematary, The Eyes of the Dragon, and The Talisman.\n\nKing's most explicit examination of alienation in childhood, however, comes in the novel It. The eponymous IT is a creature that feeds on children—on their bodies and on their emotions, especially fear. IT lives in the sewers of Derry, Maine, having arrived there ages ago from outer space, and emerges about every twenty-seven years in search of victims. King organizes the tale as two parallel stories, one tracing the activities of seven unprepossessing fifth-graders—‘The Losers’ Club'—who discovered and fought the horror in 1958, the other describing their return to Derry in 1985 when the cycle resumes.\" The surviving members of the Losers' Club return to Derry to confront IT and defeat IT once and for all. The only things that appears to hurt IT are faith, humor, and childlike courage. \"It involves the guilts and innocences of childhood and the difficulty for adults of recapturing them,\" Christopher Lehmann-Haupt stated in the New York Times. \"It questions the difference between necessity and free will. It also concerns the evil that has haunted America from time to time in the forms of crime, racial and religious bigotry, economic hardship, labor strife and industrial pollution.\" The evil takes shape among Derry's adults and older children, especially the bullies who terrorize the members of the Losers' Club.\n\nNot surprisingly, throughout most of King's adolescence, the written word afforded a powerful diversion. \"Writing has always been it for me,\" King indicated in a panel discussion at the 1984 World Fantasy Convention in Ottawa, reprinted in Bare Bones. Science fiction and adventure stories comprised his first literary efforts. Having written his first story at the age of seven, King began submitting short fiction to magazines at twelve, and published his first story at eighteen. In high school, he authored a small, satiric newspaper titled \"The Village Vomit\"; and in college he penned a popular and eclectic series of columns called \"King's Garbage Truck.\" He also started writing the novels he eventually published under the pseudonymous ruse of Richard Bachman—novels that focus more on elements of human alienation and brutality than supernatural horror. After graduation, King supplemented his teaching salary through various odd jobs and by submitting stories to men's magazines. Searching for a form of his own, King responded to a friend's challenge to break out of the machismo mold of his short fiction. Because King completed the first draft of Carrie a"
