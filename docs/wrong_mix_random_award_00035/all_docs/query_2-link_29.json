        "text": "Read\n\nJanuary 28, 2020\n\nRead this sometime in December but it didn't become a book until after that. Anyway it was cool to see how he got to where he was and him as a kid.\n\nFebruary 15, 2019\n\nWho was Michael Jackson by Megan Stine was a great book. It has a lot of facts about him. like when his birthday was, where he lived. They have a big collection of many people. I chose this book because i wanted t0 know about him. Michael Jackson was one of my favorite singers.\n\nNovember 16, 2018\n\nThis book was very interesting and informational. From the title, you can probably guess that it is about Michael Jackson and his life story! If you don't already know much about him, I suggest reading this biography! I gave it four stars because I personally am not a fan of Non Fiction.\n\nMay 8, 2018\n\nI think it is sad that he brought happiness to so many people yet had a hard time finding it for himself.\n\nMay 9, 2019\n\nWow, it sure seems like the cards were stacked against Michael from the start; this book does a great job of portraying his perfectionist nature and how he never seemed to be happy unless he was performing onstage. I found it surprising how both his late-life odd behaviors and legal issues are included, and respect that Stine wanted the material to paint a complete picture about the complicated person that Michael was by including both his good and bad aspects. The illustrations here are truly impressive and give the book a little something extra.\n\nOctober 31, 2022\n\nI really like these Who Was books for my kids. They're quick and easy to read or listen to.\n\nMarch 23, 2019\n\nFirst off I LOVE Michael Jackson from the first time listened to Thriller till I performed We Are The World. It has so many interesting facts I never even knew about him. I definitely recommend this book for you guys who don't know a lot about Micheal Jackson.\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n\nMakes me question the news.\n\nHow much is the truth vs. what his heirs want remembered?\n\nMay 26, 2016\n\nit was so good i loved it.\n\ni do respect with his generous to his children. i think they'll might miss him when he died at age of 50. and save the donation money to sick children or had cancer.\n\nso, yeah um...i do miss him. but i still love his music.\n\nand i guess no one won\"t ever forget the moonwalk.\n\nand of course his chimp named bubbles.\n\nhe do sometimes get misunderstood but he was a true humanitarian and a gentlemen.\n\ni don't care because he never did something wrong to children because of the trial but was found not guilty.\n\nthe problem is,he wasn't that the most happiest person the world. but that his emotions.\n\nhe had sensitivity. it's only because he never had a childhood because of as a kid never gets to play outside with his brothers and sisters because of his strict father who was very tough and mean a lot.\n\nevery-time he thinks about his father and his past that was very horrible, he usually get very sensitive and cry a lot.\n\nall of his fans on stage would might be saying ok? why's he crying?\n\np.s, no really it is true actually. he always does whatever he sang \"i'll be there\" or \"she\"s out of my life\" during the live since 1992 or something like that.\n\nhe might be probably be miserable because of the way he feels about his bad teenage life of not looking the way he looked or about his father.\n\nfor example which is true, his father called him\" a fat nose\" it wasn't nice and it does hurt his feelings and so does\"wacko jacko\"\n\nbut his mother was a religious person and loves his son.\n\ni'm not trying to be too dramatic. i still love his dancing.\n\nR.I.P king of pop.\n\nso, rest in peace Michael Jackson.\n\nSeptember 12, 2021\n\nThis book talks about the backstory of Michael Jackson. Not only does it talk about Michael Jackson but it talks about the Jackson 5 and their rise to fame. I recommend people of all ages but mainly children an teens to read this because the level of influence that this man had on the world will inspire them to be the best a i what ever filed they're in and have and have an effect so that people like us can see and want to make a change. I want to have an influence on people in a field that I want t be in on kids teens and adults no matter what field they're in. I'll give this book a 9/10 rating.\n\nApril 19, 2021\n\nThis is not my favorite book in this series. Michael was not my favorite pop star and this biography highlighted some of my concerns. This is a better book for adults wanting a quick look at this music legend than for young fans hoping to moon walk in his shoes.\n\nFebruary 7, 2017\n\nDetailed Read for Kids. They even wrote about the child molestations charges and his medication use.\n\nMarch 29, 2022\n\nThis was an interesting book about Michael Jackson.\n\nJune 29, 2022\n\nI personally felt like some of the things were untrue. I don't know for sure but I feel like some of the things aren't proven and they state it like a fact. I might be wrong though.\n\nJanuary 19, 2021\n\nI’ve finished reading the book “Who Was Michael Jackson?” by Megan Stine, and I can say with certainty that it disappointed me deeply.\n\nThe author shows cleverness at describing the early stages of Michael’s life, but when it comes to the late ‘80s till his passing, she was being too abbreviated and even took some of the rumors for granted.\n\nWe all know that Michael Jackson didn’t request to be called The King of Pop, it was Elizabeth Taylor who first had called him by this nickname in MTV music awards 1988, Michael talked about that in Winfrey’s interview with him in 1993, but in the book the author said that Michael Jackson told everyone to call him on the awards’ ceremony by this nickname, the book also admitted that Michael had so many plastic surgeries, which in the very same interview Michael declares that he only had two plastic surgeries on his nose, also, the author of the book claimed that Michael was the one who was messing with the press to get bad publicity by taking a picture of himself in an oxygen chamber, telling the world that he is buying the Elephant Man bones (Joseph Merrick), and having the chimpanzee bubbles as a pet, again, Michael had told Oprah that he was not sleeping in an oxygen chamber nor buying any bones at all, and clearly Michael had so many other animals too.\n\nSo, what I conclude is that there are two possibilities:\n\n1. The author didn’t know about what Michael said on the ‘93 interview, thus she spoke of what she knew.\n\n2. The author assumed that Michael was lying and she didn’t believe what he said.\n\nAnd in both cases, one should say that this book was supposed to hold facts and the writer of a book should have all the proper information about the matter that they’re writing about.\n\nThe book mentioned the Child Accusations against Michael only in one page, the author mentioned the 1993 case settlement, the 2005 court vindication and Michael insisting on his innocence, all written in abstract in only one page, and that is fair to me because she didn’t say anything but informing the reader about what had happened without going into much unnecessary details, she was objective.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that the book was bad at all, there were times when the author seemed to be in Michael’s side being amazed by his work as an entertainer and his message about healing the world and his humanitarian work, she also spoke about Michael’s activism against racism.\n\nIn conclusion, the book is great in terms of showing Michael’s early life and splendor talent, but it didn’t do good on the personal level.\n\nAnd, I sincerely believe that we should separate the art from the artist, loving the work of an artist doesn’t mean that one shall know every personal detail available about them, the artist is a person who is sharing his capacities and talent with others, of course we must value them and for that reason we must understand that we have to be reasonable.\n\nIt hurts me a lot when I learn about Michael’s suffering because of people invading his personal space and privacy, I think it shall be a lesson for everyone to stop.\n\nI recommend reading the book but with caution and checking every piece of information.\n\nHave you read it already? Let me know your thoughts.\n\nOctober 5, 2017\n\nMichael Jackson is such a huge name, but my guess is many people don't know anything about his life. I certainly didn't. I had to hurry and read this book so I could help one of my students with their Wax Museum report.\n\nMichael Jackson's life was all about becoming a star.\n\nWhen he was just a young child, his dad pushed his kids to become the famous \"Jackson 5.\" He worked them and worked them. Luckily, they did have a lot of natural talent. MJ had perfect pitch. His dad was abusive, though, and would often hit the children if they weren't doing what they were supposed to.\n\nThey first sang for Motown, but MJ broke away so he could have more control. He wanted to write his own songs and even star in movies. He starred in a movie called The Wiz with Diana Ross.\n\nAfter the movie, MJ fired his dad as his manager and started working with Paul Quincy more on his own. It was at this time that he performed Thriller and the other songs he's famous for. He one the R&B Grammy award, but it made him mad because he thought of it as the \"black\" award and he felt he deserved the pop award. He started working harder.\n\nHe told MTV that he would only appear on their award shows if they called him \"the king of pop.\" They did and it stuck.\n\nHe donated a lot of his money to charities, like a burn unit and helping kids with cancer.\n\nHe really loved his children and lived all over the world with them. He overspent and wasn't making any new songs so he got into serious debt. It was when he was trying to make a comeback that he died of an accidental drug overdose.\n\nHe also bought the rights to the Beatles songs and was kind of a dick to Paul McCartney and refused to give them more of the profits. Not cool.\n\nIt was interesting learning a little about this American legend.\n\nJanuary 28, 2023\n\nwas surprised to find this book had good info on michael jackson considering how false many of his unauthorized biographies are, but was once again disappointed that it focused on the unimportant things. while the book does mention that michael gave to charities and assisted many children, it seemed to emphasize his plastic surgery and painkiller reliance more.\n\n“but he had tried to get attention in the wrong way” suggests that michael deserved the inhumane treatment by the media, and the malicious press attacks were of his own doing—no one wants that for themselves and michael never provoked any of it.\n\ni did appreciate the fun quotes like “quincy jones’s recording engineer said michael jackson was one of the few people whose singing never had to be fixed in the studio. it was always perfect, just the way he sang it,” which underscore his insane talent.\n\nthe book doesn���t seem to take a stance on michael jackson’s innocence, which is weird because it should be crystal clear after performing enough research to write a book on him. i only wished the author made it more clear that he was a legendary humanitarian. after looking at the bibliography, which is only a mere 4 sources, i realized why this book was still lacking. to delve into one of the most misunderstood yet iconic figures in history but only rely on 4 sources is wild. especially when only 1 of them are from michael jackson himself and the rest are extremely biased and unreliable pieces—no one should read “michael jackson: the magic, the madness, the whole story.”\n\nthis was a quick and easy read but not fully accurate. still better than most books i’ve read on MJ\n\nJanuary 30, 2020\n\nThis book really told me the Michael Jackson had a really great but awful life at the same time. His life starts as a little kid in Indiana with 8 other siblings and a mom and dad to live with. And their house was really small. His career started when his brother Tito got caught playing his father's guitar. But instead of getting beat since his father was really strict, his father figured out that his father had talent. So he formed all the brothers into a band all the “Jackson 5”. Which later broke after the father's mental and physical abuse. Turns out, Michael had a great voice by himself. So he became a solo artist and had made lots of money and popularity with his songs Thriller, Billie Jean, Man in the Mirror, and etc. He later started getting a lot of plastic surgery on his nose after his dad made fun of his “Big Fat Nose” all the time. He also said he had a skin disease that turned him white after time. But people think that he bleached his skin all the time. He also later got accused of rape accusations to little kids. To which he ended up winning all the cases. In 2009, he announced his final worldwide tour of all his hit songs fans loved. But the day after practice performing, He was sent to the hospital after having a cardiac arrest. He died when he got to the hospital. One of his assistants was accused of killing him by giving him too many sleeping pills. After reading this, I now know that Michael was one of the most iconic artists in the music industry. I would recommend this to Michael Jackson lovers even though I don't really listen to his music.\n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n\nMichael Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana. Him and his brothers started music band when Michael was about 9 years. In 1978 he stars in Wizard Of Oz with Diana Ross. In 1984 he wins 8 Grammy’s. And he burned during filming of Pepsi commercial, Buys the Beatles’ song. In 1994, he marries Lisa Marie Presley. In 1996, he divorces Lisa Marie Presley and Marries Debbie Rowe. In 1997 his first son was born Prince Michael Jackson. In 198 his first daughter was born, Paris Katherine Michael Jackson. And in 2002 his second son was born, Prince Michael II. In 2009 he got sick and decided to go to the hospital an the doctor gave him a shot that killed him at the age of 50. And that is the story of Michael Jackson.\n\nNovember 8, 2017\n\nThis was a great book. I love how the authors in this whole series do a great job explaining the person's life. I learned a ton about Michael Jackson that I had never known before. This is a great educational series, and I have read a lot of them. If you are looking for a quick, easy read, and want to learn more about famous musicians or singers, this is the book for you. If I had to say one thing I didn't like about the book, it would be that I wish that they said more about the songs he made, and how they were made, and what the process was of writing them, because it really only talked about three songs and I wanted to learn more. However, this is a great book and I really learned a lot.\n\nJuly 28, 2018\n\nThe best thing about this book was reading it with my ten-year-old son.\n\nThis series does a great job of introducing a variety of different people (both contemporary and those in the past) to children. In addition, they've extended their offerings to include \"What Is/Was\" books as well as \"Where Is/Are\" books.\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nI read this to my students when we had extra time at the end of music class - it's an age-appropriate biography of Michael Jackson for older elementary kids. My students really seemed to enjoy it and I learned a bit I didn't know about one of my favorite musicians. Definitely recommend this for kids maybe 8-12 who are interested in Michael Jackson.\n\nAugust 3, 2017\n\nA quick, engaging, and surprisingly impartial biography about a superstar talent who lived a weird life. Enormous kid appeal here, even for those who have never heard of him. I was surprised by some of the details, myself.\n\nRead in preparation for a \"Who Was...\" book club series at the library.\n\nJuly 22, 2018\n\nThis is a book for tweens. It gives a broad view of Michael's life. It discusses the dynamics with his mother and father, and a little with the siblings. It discusses some of his insecurities and how he made his money. It discusses how he learned music and his inspirations.\n\nFebruary 8, 2019\n\nthese books over all are really pretty easy, but a whole lot of fun to read. Their quick. their informational. The graphics are fun and pretty cool. These books are basic , simple time lines. I would say over all these books are worth your time. About fifteen minutes."
