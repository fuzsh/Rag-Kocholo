        "text": "The Michael Jackson 1987 music video “Smooth Criminal” is a classic. In one scene, Michael Jackson was able to lean forward to about 45 degrees while maintaining a straight spine, appearing to defy gravity. Many other people have tried to replicate it, but this move would seem to be impossible from a biomechanics point of view.\n\nStudy of Smooth Criminal\n\nNishant Yagnick and colleagues from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India analyzed Michael’s biomechanics in an article published in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine.\n\nHow He Did It\n\nMost trained dancers with strong core strength can only reach a maximum of 25° to 30° of forward bending while performing this action.\n\nComment by Joseph Muscolino\n\nPushing our bodies further and further in the interest of art with all the challenges and stresses to the body that accompany this pursuit, is a noble endeavour. However, nobility is one thing and creating an injury that may cause pain and affect our ability to function for the rest of our lives is another matter. Certainly, the best way to prevent myofascio-skeletal injury is to be as strong and as flexible as possible. But even when we optimize these aspects of our body, we still need to be mindful that there are limits to the physical stresses that our tissues can endure. So, let’s all be healthy and work hard toward our goals for our art or for our sport, but be attentive and listen to our body’s responses to the demands we place upon it, and prevent injury.\n\nThis blog post article was created in collaboration with www.terrarosa.com.au.\n\nAuthors’ Conclusion\n\nThe authors stated that Michael Jackson challenged our understanding of the modes and mechanisms of movement, the limits of movement, and therefore mechanisms of spinal injury. Dancers often try to perform increasingly challenging moves by jumping higher, stretching farther, and turning faster than before. These new moves create stresses on the spine that can cause injury."
