        "text": "Michael Jackson’s charity work has always inspired me.\n\nMichael often expressed his dedication to helping those in need. He visited hospitals, made generous donations, and also implemented programs to help the sick, the poor, and the less fortunate. Not only did Michael master the art of performing- song and dance, he also mastered the art of philanthropy. On the official Michael Jackson website, it reads “In 2000, Guinness World Records honored Michael for supporting 39 charities, a record for the most supported by a pop star, with hundreds of millions of dollars estimated to have been raised by his efforts”.\n\nAlthough Michael had an outstanding dedication to being charitable and giving both money and time to help those in need, his humanitarianism is seldom discussed.\n\nWhen I came across this book, HUMANITARIAN- The Real Michael Jackson, I knew it was something I’d be interested in. Written by Paul Dwyer, this book is a chronological timeline that goes into detail on much of Michael’s charitable work throughout the years. Starting out in his days with the Jackson 5 at Motown and all the way up to the last year of his life, in 2009.\n\nBefore I go over some of my favorite parts of the book, I also think its pertinent to mention how the book was created in the spirit of Michael’s charity work. The author funded the set-up, publishing, and website himself and also all of the profits of book sales go to a local children’s hospital that Michael visited. Something about the background behind the book really inspires me because it really shows how influential Michael Jackson the humanitarian has been.\n\nThe author Paul Dwyer starts the book and shares how he became a fan, hailing from Austrailia, he saw Michael in concert many times, met him, and has been very impacted by Michael. I think it was very honorable of him to write a book honoring this part of Michael’s life and he does a great job of documenting as many events and instances of charity work as possible.\n\nAll of the stories are well researched, many with photos as well.\n\nThere are so many stores where Michael has personally visited the besides of sick children, starting with his time in the Jackson 5, as early as March 1973. As a Michael Jackson fan, there are a number of stories that I am familiar with already. I know that when Michael Jackson was burned in that Pepsi commercial taping, that he visited with many hospitalized even at that time. And then shortly thereafter he began the Michael Jackson Burn Center at the hospital where he was treated. with a generous donation of $1.5 million dollars.\n\nSome other highlights include:\n\nWe are the world, which raised over $150 million USD after inflation for humanitarian causes, mostly Africa relief including agriculture, reforestation, and water management.\n\nMichael visited many people who felt that he gave them an extra shot at recovery or even an extended lease on life.\n\nHe visited elementary schools and donated tens of thousands to better their programs, in addition to the Michael Jackson scholarship fund which still exists today.\n\nHe worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and even established his own Heal The World foundation in the 90s.\n\nA lot of people don’t know this but, it’s also outlined in Michael’s will that 10% of all income from his estate be donated to charity so, his humanitarianism lives on.\n\nI recommend this book to anyone who is new to Michael Jackson and his humanitarian side but also to fans who just never knew in detail, what he actually did. There are many personal stories from people he actually visited in hospitals and even some speeches and quotes from Michael that are really special.\n\nBuy this book on Amazon.com here: https://amzn.to/33ZPZIw or visit HumanitarianBook.com"
