The Kuntsevo Dacha was Joseph Stalin's personal residence near the former town of Kuntsevo (now part of Moscow's Fili district), where he lived for the last two decades of his life and died on 5 March 1953, although he also spent much time inside the Kremlin, where he possessed living quarters next to his offices. The dacha is located inside a forest not far from the modern-day Victory Park.
