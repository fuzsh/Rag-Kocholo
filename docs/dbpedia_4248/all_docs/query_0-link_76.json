        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nxix Introduction to the English-Language Edition Seth Bernstein In 1937–38 an unprecedented wave of repression washed over Stalin’s Soviet Union. Among former elites, a series of show trials and highprofile arrests targeted the ranks of the party and intelligentsia. Beyond these well-known proceedings, more than a million people disappeared in secret “mass operations” run by the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD), the ministry that oversaw the criminal and secret police. Over two years, the NKVD arrested a minimum of 1.5 million people and saw roughly 700,000 sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit or for activities that could hardly be classified as crimes at all.1 But aggregated statistics belie the way that repression occurred on the ground, where officers conducted arrests and extracted confessions victim by victim. In each of the USSR’s several thousand districts, the equivalent of a county, an NKVD office with a handful of investigators operated the machine of terror. The years 1937–38 have been a topic of horror and fascination for nearly eight decades. Known alternately as the Great Terror, the Great Purge, and the ezhovshchina (the reign of Nikolai Ezhov, NKVD commissar ), it was a subject where politics and lack of sources obscured what scholars could know about one of the largest incidents of state violence in history.2 Depending on who wrote the history and when, interpretations of the Great Terror changed drastically. Once conceived on both sides of the Iron Curtain as an elite purge above all, new evidence from the partial opening of Soviet archives has transformed this understanding of repression under Stalin. Above all, scholars learned about the xx Introduction to the English-Language Edition mass operations, overlapping campaigns where NKVD officers conducted preemptive arrests by quota of nonelites among “anti-Soviet elements” and “hostile nationalities.” Much of the writing on Stalin-era repression has focused on the culpability of the leading figures in the terror, above all on Soviet dictator Iosif Stalin, and historians have continued to generate new findings about the terror as planned in Moscow. However, as ruthless as Stalin was, he did not beat the prisoners being interrogated himself. Even NKVD commissar Nikolai Ezhov, who did interrogate high-ranking victims, did not take to the countryside or the factories to find ordinary “enemies of the people.”3 Lack of evidence about the interactions of arrestees and NKVD officers has meant that few works have examined Stalinist repression at the local level. Although there are a wealth of studies about the production of mass violence in other contexts—above all by the Nazi German regime—the story of the executors of repression has been a blank spot in the history of Stalinism.4 Alexander Vatlin’s Agents of Terror fills this gap with a detailed history of the NKVD in Kuntsevo district of Moscow province during 1937–38. Although Kuntsevo was near the capital, its story represents how the terror unfolded among nonelites throughout the USSR. Using the investigations of the district’s victims and of its NKVD officers, Vatlin is able to reconstruct the events of the mass operations at the local level. The majority of arrestees were not politicians but instead were peasants, workers, and national minorities. The executors of terror were not revolutionary ideologues but fearful and ambitious officers desperate to fulfill the plans of their bosses in the clan-like system of the NKVD. In exploring their world, Vatlin challenges readers to go beyond the central figures in the terror, assessing notions of historical agency and moral responsibility in Stalin-era crimes. This introduction places Vatlin’s work in the broader context of the mass operations and evolving interpretations of the terror. During the partial opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s, the greatest secret the declassified documents held about the Great Terror or perhaps any other aspect of Soviet history was the mass operations. What was shocking about them was their scope, targets, and directed nature. Only when the Russian press published orders from the mass operations in 1992 did it become clear that nonelites made up the vast majority of victims of repression in the Great Terror.5 Historians learned that the terror was not a singular, massive campaign but a series of operations the NKVD undertook in 1937–38 targeting specific groups of “anti-Soviet elements.” [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-14 07:08 GMT) Introduction to the English-Language Edition xxi The discovery..."
