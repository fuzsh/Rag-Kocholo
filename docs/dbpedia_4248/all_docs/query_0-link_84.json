I am especially grateful to Heather McCallum, my editor at Yale University Press in London, who proposed the project to me. She proved to be a reliable friend and resource, firm, helpful, and clear-headed as I made my way through a thicket of historical events and challenges with the manuscript. My agents, Robin Straus and Andrew Nurnberg, were also particularly encouraging at moments when I wondered if I could sort out what needed to be said and how to get there.\n\nSeveral colleagues at the Kathryn W. and Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, which has been my intellectual home for over three decades, provided much needed guidance and assistance. I relied on Mark Kramer for his remarkable knowledge of documents and historical writing on the period; he also proved to be a patient and insightful reader of the manuscript. Hugh Truslow, the librarian for the Davis Center Collection, was always ready to help me track down an obscure volume or find my way through online archival materials. He and other staff members at Harvard’s Widener Library provided much needed bibliographic support.\n\nKimberly St. Julian worked as my research assistant when I first began this project, while Sydney Soderberg located material for me at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas. I want to thank both of them for their help.\n\nDavid Brandenberger at Richmond College was among the colleagues I first approached when I was considering how to fashion a book about the events surrounding Stalin’s death; his feedback and encouragement were always welcome. Maxim Shrayer of Boston College was also a source of ideas and inspiration. My longtime friend, Boris Katz, was kind enough to read parts of the manuscript and, as always, was forthright and thorough in his criticism.\n\nIn addition, I would like to thank Sergei Nikitich Khrushchev who welcomed me to his home in Cranston, Rhode Island, near the outset of my research. I very much benefited from our conversation about his father and his own experiences during those fateful days in March 1953. And Tatiana Yankelevich shared a vivid story with me from the life of her mother, Elena Bonner, who came close to being a victim of the Doctors’ Plot. Jonathan Brent also shared a good deal of material with me from his extensive collection of documents about the Doctors’ Plot.\n\nFinally, my wife, Jill Janows and our son, Ben, had to endure yet another deep dive into Soviet history which required me to be in libraries and behind a study door at all hours of the day and night. Their patient love continues to be a crucial source of emotional support.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nJoseph Stalin collapsed and died in an atmosphere of medieval recrimination. It was March 1953. The Kremlin seethed with fears of a broad, new purge against members of his Presidium. A public campaign against treasonous Jewish doctors threatened to engulf all of Soviet Jewry. Tensions with the West were more and more alarming: after three years of fighting, the war in Korea continued unabated while American and Soviet armies faced each other in a divided Germany. At the same time a new American administration led by President Dwight David Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had come into office that January with the intention of rolling back communism only to find themselves confronting Stalin’s heirs and a host of unexpected reforms.\n\nAt home and abroad Stalin’s longtime comrades-in-arms faced a host of difficult dilemmas. They understood the need to release prisoners from the Gulag, disavow the Doctors’ Plot, and provide higher living standards for the population. They also offered concessions to the West, a dramatic peace offensive that included renewed and serious negotiations to end the fighting in Korea and reduce tensions in Europe, including in the satellite countries in Eastern Europe where Stalin’s extreme policies were leading to popular unrest against communist rule.\n\nBut their overriding concern was preserving their hold on power. Stalin had so dominated life in the country that his death provoked an enormous outpouring of disoriented grief. Stalin was inside everyone, like the hammer alongside the sickle in every mind, as the writer Andrei Sinyavsky wrote.¹ The regime feared that his death would lead to panic and disorder, which in turn could undermine their legitimacy and the authority of one-party rule. They had to devise a way to distance themselves from Stalin’s crimes while insisting that the Communist Party not be held responsible for the tyrant’s brutality, that the party was more to be pitied for what it had endured than condemned for what it had applauded. This dilemma arose immediately after his collapse, then continued for decades, with occasional flashes of candor and truth followed by renewed, official respect for Stalin and his leadership. It affected his medical treatment, the conduct of his funeral, relations with the West, and everyday life in the country.\n\nThis book opens with Stalin’s death, moves backward in time to the Nineteenth Party Congress in October 1952, when Stalin made his last public speech, then proceeds through the winter of 1952–53 when the Doctors’ Plot and a broad campaign against the country’s Jews unfolded. It explores how the Soviet and American press covered Stalin’s death and how the new Eisenhower administration reacted to the dramatic changes in Moscow that followed. It concludes with the arrest of Stalin’s longtime security chief, Lavrenti Beria, in June.\n\nStalin’s death introduced an unprecedented opportunity. It gave his heirs the chance to reverse many of his policies and move the country forward in a hopeful, more relaxed direction. It presented the United States with an urgent need to review assumptions about how it could work with a brutal and menacing dictatorship that had suddenly lost its leader and seemed ready to negotiate a new beginning to its relations with the outside world. For complex reasons both Soviet and Western governments could not overcome the decades of mistrust that divided them. The arms race persisted. The division of Germany and Europe continued. The Cold War reached into far corners of the world where tensions between East and West spilled over into proxy conflicts of untold misery and destruction. And in the Soviet Union the promise of change that highlighted the initial months that followed Stalin’s death collapsed into a pattern of exhilarating reform and disheartening repression that lasted until Mikhail Gorbachev pushed the limits of reform so far that the Soviet regime could no longer survive. Stalin’s death gave the Kremlin and the West the chance to escape the grim reality of his nightmarish imagination, a challenge they failed to accomplish. That failure haunted the world for decades to follow.\n\nLast Days\n\n1 Stalin and his comrades-in-arms in January 1947.

Eisenhower delivering his Chance for Peace speech in Washington, April 16, 1953.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nTHE DEATH OF STALIN\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, March 4, 1953, well before dawn, the Soviet government issued a startling announcement over Radio Moscow, alerting its people and the world at large that Joseph Stalin had suffered a devastating stroke on Sunday night, March 1. According to official statements, Stalin had been stricken in his Kremlin apartment by a cerebral hemorrhage causing loss of speech and consciousness. He was paralyzed on his right side and both his heart and lungs were no longer functioning properly. The regime assured the Soviet people that Stalin was receiving suitable medical treatment under the constant supervision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government. Nonetheless, everyone must realize the full significance of the fact that the grave illness of Comrade Stalin will involve his more or less prolonged non-participation in leading activity. This would mean the temporary withdrawal of Comrade Stalin from affairs of state.\n\nA medical bulletin provided more specific diagnostic detail, including measurements of his labored breathing, an elevated pulse and clinically worrisome high blood pressure together with arrhythmia of the heart. Despite Stalin’s grave state of health, the doctors were applying a series of therapeutic measures . . . toward restoration of the vitally important functions of the organism.¹ The bulletin was issued over the names of eleven prestigious doctors, including the minister of public health and the chief doctor of the Kremlin. The regime was making clear that it was providing the most effective care possible in response to a devastating medical event; that party leaders were monitoring the work of the minister of public health, while the minister was supervising ten other doctors; and that, as their names indicated, none of them were Jewish. This was crucially important because only seven weeks earlier, on January 13, the regime had announced the exposure of a sinister conspiracy involving a group of physicians, most of whom were Jews, who were said to be in league with imperialist and Zionist organizations to carry out the murder of leading Soviet officials by maliciously applying their medical skills. This was the notorious Doctors’ Plot. Now Stalin had fallen ill. His successors and members of his inner circle—Georgy Malenkov, Lavrenti Beria, Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev—waited at least forty-eight hours to announce the news, wanting to be sure they agreed on how to divide party and government authority, both to calm the population and, not least, to protect themselves. They had been living in fear for their own lives, wondering if and when Stalin would target one, two, or all of them as he had dispatched so many other once-powerful men. Their shared interest in survival ensured their cooperation at this delicate moment. They also needed to be absolutely confident that Stalin was about to die. Suddenly, his ruthless, personal dictatorship was over. Their fear of him was evaporating.\n\nStalin’s health had long been a question of deep speculation. Who did not dream about his dying? Or perhaps people were simply looking for hints of mortality knowing that except for death itself, nothing demonstrates a common humanity more vividly than aging and illness. But for some even that was too much of a prohibited instinct. Listening to the medical communiqués, the writer Konstantin Simonov thought it was senseless to consider what the pulse, the blood pressure, the temperature and all the other details in the bulletins could mean, what they signified about the medical condition of a seventy-three-year-old man. I did not want to think about it and did not want to talk about it with others because it did not seem right to talk about Stalin simply as an old man who suddenly took sick.² As the writer Ilya Ehrenburg wrote in his memoirs, We had long lost sight of the fact that Stalin was mortal. He had become an all-powerful and remote deity.³ But Stalin did not share this illusion. There were countless rumors that he was supporting scientific research into extending human life, even that he spared the famous doctor Lina Shtern after her conviction for treason and espionage in 1952 because he thought her work could extend his own life span.⁴\n\nBased on the reports of doctors who had treated Stalin and on other sources of information, it is possible to piece together at least a partial medical history. Stalin suffered from several disfiguring features. The toes of his left foot were webbed. His face was pockmarked from a bout of smallpox as a child. His left arm appeared to be withered, with an elbow that could not properly bend; there are different explanations for this injury, either that an accident as a young boy was not properly treated or that his left arm was injured during a difficult birth, leaving him with a condition called Erb’s palsy. As he approached the age of fifty, he began to seek treatment for dull pains in the muscles and nerve endings of his arms and legs, a condition that doctors urged him to treat with cures at medicinal baths in southern Russia and the Caucasus. He also suffered from headaches and painful conditions in his throat. By 1936, his doctors noted problems with his ability to walk and stand, and they began treating him for the initial symptoms of arteriosclerosis.\n\nFollowing the war, it is believed that Stalin suffered either a heart attack or small strokes in 1945 and again in 1947. Based on little hard information, there were a number of articles in the Western press which speculated about his faltering condition. In October 1945, the Chicago Tribune, the Paris Press, and Newsweek all claimed that Stalin had suffered two heart attacks at the Potsdam Conference the previous summer where he met President Truman for the first and only time. On November 11, the French journal Bref reported that Stalin had suffered a heart attack on September 13 and that he had retired to the Black Sea in order to write his political testimony.⁵ It remains difficult to clarify exactly what was going on. Stalin welcomed US Ambassador Averell Harriman to Sochi on October 24 and 25, and it was Harriman who reassured the press that Generalissimus Stalin is in good health and rumors of his ill health have no foundation whatsoever.⁶\n\nHis medical condition, nonetheless, continued to deteriorate in the post-war years. A foreign diplomat who saw him in June 1947 was struck by how much he had aged since the conclusion of the war; Stalin was now an old, very tired old man.⁷ According to the Russian historian Dmitri Volkogonov, Stalin fainted at least three times in his office, twice in the presence of Poskrebyshev and once in front of members of the Politburo. Volkogonov described these attacks as sudden spasms in his blood vessels.⁸ At Stalin’s last appointment with his personal physician, the cardiologist Vladimir Vinogradov on January 19, 1952, his doctor urged him to consider retirement. Such advice angered Stalin and he dismissed it as a sign of disrespect. It was out of the question. (Vinogradov was later arrested in the fall of 1952 as part of the Doctors’ Plot.)\n\nBut Stalin was not entirely oblivious to the need to take care of his health. Beginning in 1945 (following the war), he would leave Moscow for an increasing number of months—initially three months a year, then almost five months in 1950, and finally a full seven months from August 1951 to February 1952—finding it more restful to live and work at one of his southern dachas where the warm weather and familiar climate of the Caucasus revived him.⁹ From there he could read reports and telegrams, all along never letting the country know that he was not working in the Kremlin. Rarely though did he take Vinogradov’s advice. As a chain smoker who kept his pipe filled with tobacco, Stalin exacerbated his hypertension and did not stop smoking until early in 1952. By then, he had also stopped taking steam baths; sitting in a banya only increased his blood pressure. To treat his hypertension, he liked to drink boiled water with a few drops of iodine before dinner, a useless exercise in self-medication.\n\nBy 1950, interest in Stalin’s health was widespread in the West, generating convoluted rumors of serious illness, even his death. In March, after Stalin failed to deliver an election speech, the US embassy in Moscow reported to Washington that he might be suffering from throat cancer. Two years later, in January 1952, the US embassy in Warsaw reported that Stalin was ill, leaving Beria, Malenkov, and Molotov or Shvernik to act in his place.¹⁰ Three weeks later, the US embassy in Ankara reported that the Turkish prime minister, Adnan Menderes, had advised the American ambassador about an intercepted message out of the Polish embassy that Stalin was seriously ill.¹¹ Two days after that, the US embassy in Moscow cited newspaper reports out of Amsterdam that Stalin’s health was failing after a heart operation on December 19, 1951. There was also the claim that Soviet embassy officers in Amsterdam had been alerted by the foreign office in Moscow that Stalin was no longer [a] young man and that they should not be alarmed to hear he had undergone [a] successful heart operation and might expect similar news in future in view his age.¹² Nonetheless, American diplomats added in the very same cable that Stalin had attended the annual Lenin anniversary ceremony at the Bolshoi Theater on January 21 where, the New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury later noted, Stalin appeared in obvious good health and spirits.¹³ The outgoing US ambassador to Moscow, Admiral Alan Kirk, visited President Truman on February 4. When they discussed Stalin, the ambassador confirmed that he could not offer concrete evidence of [Stalin’s] failing health.¹⁴ The Americans were grasping at straws.\n\nSalisbury was following all of these rumors. On February 27, 1952, he sent a letter to his editors in New York—presumably the letter was taken out of the country in a secure manner to evade Soviet controls—about how he would alert them with a coded message should he learn of Stalin’s death before an official statement came out. Frankly, he added, I think it is a thousand to one shot that anything will be known in advance of the official announcement, which almost certainly will be released for publication abroad as soon as it is made here. He also urged his colleagues to query [him] before putting into print any rumors about [Stalin’s health] such as the very silly item from Amsterdam which AP [Associated Press] carried.¹⁵\n\nWestern diplomats remained alert to any possible changes in Stalin’s health. That June, US Ambassador George Kennan passed along rumors to Washington that Vyacheslav Molotov and Andrei Vyshinsky were about to replace Stalin, and that instructions were being quietly circulated to remove Stalin’s ubiquitous pictures from public display. Such talk prompted Kennan to speculate that Stalin was withdrawing from at least some of his duties, that his participation in public affairs is sporadic and relatively superficial as compared with [the] period before and during the war. Kennan, who was always among the most philosophical of American diplomats, could not help but comment on the unexpected longevity of Stalin’s comrades-in-arms. Whims and vicissitudes of nature seem to me to have spared this body of men for abnormally long time. It is time nature began to play her usual tricks, and their effects may well be quite different from anything any of us have anticipated.¹⁶ Nature did intervene, but not for another seven months.\n\nThat summer, American military attachés who attended a parade in Red Square reported to Kennan that the Stalin who stood atop the Mausoleum was probably a dummy; the other members of the Politburo . . . seemed to pay no attention to him and talked unceremoniously past his face.¹⁷ Kennan knew enough to dismiss such a report, although it was widely assumed that Stalin sometimes employed a double. Kennan remained eager to hear from the new French ambassador, Louis Joxe, who had just seen Stalin in the Kremlin that August. Joxe and his colleagues found Stalin showing his age very markedly. They said his hair was noticeably thin compared to his pictures, his face shrunken, his stature much smaller than they had expected. They had the impression that he moved his left arm only with considerable difficulty and that his bodily movements were in general labored and jerky. They left the meeting with the distinct feeling that they had been confronted with an old man.¹⁸\n\nNonetheless, there are conflicting reports about Stalin’s appearance and his level of energy in the final weeks of his life. Svetlana Alliluyeva visited her father for the final time on his birthday, December 21, 1952. She came away worried over how badly he looked.¹⁹ The last foreigners to visit with him were the newly appointed ambassador from Argentina, Louis Bravo, and the Indian ambassador K. P. S. Menon, who accompanied the Indian peace activist Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew to the Kremlin. Bravo saw Stalin for nearly an hour on the evening of February 7, 1953, and reported him to be in excellent physical and mental condition, belying his advanced age.²⁰ Stalin then welcomed Menon and Kitchlew on February 17, spending a half hour with Menon and then more than an hour with Kitchlew, who had just been awarded a Stalin Peace Prize.²¹ Here again both men came away impressed by Stalin’s excellent health, mind, and spirits.²² It is hard to know what to believe. Perhaps these men, progressives with a degree of sympathy toward the regime, were indulging in wishful thinking and were not going to reveal how Stalin’s health was faltering. The reality would soon come to the attention of the world.²³\n\nOn Saturday evening, February 28, 1953, Stalin entertained his inner circle at the Kremlin and then at the Nearby Dacha in the Moscow suburb of Kuntsevo. By the final years of his life, Stalin was spending virtually all of his free time there. The grounds of the Nearby Dacha included a rose garden, lemon and apple trees around a small pond, even a watermelon patch which Stalin liked to cultivate. Once inside, a vestibule welcomed visitors, with two cloakrooms on either side. To the left, a door led to Stalin’s study equipped with a large desk that once accommodated military maps during the war; Stalin often liked to sleep on a sofa in the study. To the right, another door led to a long, rather narrow corridor with two bedrooms on the right-hand side. The same corridor led to a long, open veranda where Stalin would sometimes sit in the winter, enveloped in a fur hat and a sheepskin coat with traditional, Russian felt boots on his feet. The middle door off the front hall led to a large, rectangular banquet hall where a long, polished table dominated the space. It was here that Stalin"
