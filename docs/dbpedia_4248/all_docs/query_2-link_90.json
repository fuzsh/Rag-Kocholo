As the uncontested dictator of the Soviet Union for nearly twenty-five years, Stalin made no attempt to gain popular support among his nation but enforced his interpretation of communist-socialist rule by means of unremitting oppression and terror. Why did he utilize such vindictive measures? Was it his absolute aversion to any authority and ruthless insistence on total control at all times? This paper explores Stalin’s mental state through his personal documents, political actions, and psychological indicators throughout his life. The Purges concluded when Stalin died, demonstrating that he was the key to the violence, not an inherent product of the circumstances or historical repetition, and that his clinically-unwell mind may have instead been the culprit.",
