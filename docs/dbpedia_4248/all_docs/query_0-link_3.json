        "text": "Harrison E. Salisbury was The Times's correspondent in Moscow from 1949 to 1954. This article is adapted from his memoirs, ''A Journey for Our Times,'' to be published by Harper & Row in May.\n\nFebruary in Moscow seems like the longest month of the year - day after day of cold wind, gray skies, falling snow; the women in gray quilted jackets and gray shawls sweeping the streets with witches' brooms; the Hotel Metropol's corridors dimmer and dimmer, ghosts in the corners, a time when life congeals and hope vanishes.\n\nFebruary 1953. For weeks I had been growing more and more edgy and even frightened. I had been living in Moscow as The New York Times's correspondent for four years. I knew the city, and I knew something was going on behind the scenes.\n\nAll signs pointed to it. There were the rumors of arrests, with Jews in the Ukraine, men in the Foreign Ministry, even the wife of Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov said to be among the victims. There was the officially announced ''doctors' plot,'' in which nine Kremlin physicians, most of them Jewish, were charged with the deaths of high military and political figures. And there were the mysterious political shake-ups in Georgia and in the secret police.\n\nI had no doubt that Stalin was concocting something worse than anything he had done in the past. My friend Thomas P. Whitney of The Associated Press and I were now sharing night duty at the Central Telegraph Office, watching for late breaks and communiques.\n\nThe week of March 1 was my duty week, and I spent the early evening of Tuesday, March 3, in my hotel room monitoring the Soviet news agency, Tass. Those were the days before transistor radios, and my technological wonder was one of those big Hallicrafters shortwave radio receivers that were then the pride of Central Intelligence Agency station chiefs. Mine was battleship gray - I had got it from a departing American naval officer - and the size and shape of a steel filing drawer.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
