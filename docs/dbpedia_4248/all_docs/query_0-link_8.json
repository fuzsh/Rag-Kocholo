        "text": "A Russian fashion label is rolling out a collection of jackets inspired by late Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin — and they cost $1,600 each.\n\nA Moscow-based fashion designer decided to commemorate the March 5 anniversary of the passing of the man responsible for the deaths of millions by unveiling a line of Stalinesque jackets.\n\nAccording to the UK-based news site Metro, people lined up outside the brand’s retail shop in the Russian capital for a chance to get their hands on the new apparel.\n\nBut some Russians were aghast at the designer’s rollout, which featured a promotional video showing a man modeling the Stalin jacket while walking in a bombed-out Ukrainian town while holding a smoking pipe — just as the Soviet dictator did during his heyday.\n\n“You urgently need to change something, starting with a psychologist,” one Russian Instagram user wrote in response to the video.\n\nThe button-down jackets resemble the military tunics that the Bolshevik leader wore during his time in power.\n\nThe military style jacket comes with a Chairman Mao-like collar and a style that accentuates broad shoulders — projecting an image of authoritarianism.\n\nNewRuBrand24, the fashion label, launched the jacket this week — 71 years to the day that the second leader of the Soviet Union died at Kuntsevo Dacha in Moscow at the age of 74.\n\n“The jacket has become one of our business cards,” the brand said in announcing the new line.\n\n“It is called ‘Stalinist,’ since the ‘father of nations’ always wore a strict suit in military fashion.”\n\nDuring Stalin’s reign, around 6 million Ukrainians and others in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan died of famine as a result of his decision to collectivize agriculture in grain-rich regions.\n\nStalin also had nearly a million of his own citizens that he perceived as a threat to his rule executed, including alleged spies, traitors and class enemies.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from NewRuBrand24."
