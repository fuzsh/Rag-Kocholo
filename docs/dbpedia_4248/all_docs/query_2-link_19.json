        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1879–1953). One of the most ruthless dictators of modern times was Joseph Stalin, the despot who transformed the Soviet Union into a major world power. The victims of his campaigns of political terror included some of his followers. His original Georgian name was Ioseb Dzhugashvili. In 1912 he took the alias of “Stalin,” from the Russian word stal, meaning “steel.”\n\nJoseph Stalin was born in Gori, a village in Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire, on December 18 (December 6 according to the Old Style calendar), 1878. (Stalin’s birth was traditionally held to be December 21 [December 9, Old Style], 1879. Evidence uncovered after the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, points to December 18, 1878, as his actual birth date.) Stalin’s father was Vissarion Dzhugashvili, a poor shoemaker who drank heavily and beat the boy savagely. His mother, a peasant’s daughter, took in sewing and washing to help support the family. When Stalin was an infant, he caught smallpox, which left him pockmarked for life.\n\nStalin attended a church school in Gori from 1888 to 1894. He then moved to the Tiflis Theological Seminary to be educated for the priesthood. He was more interested in communism, however, than in theology, and the seminary expelled him in 1899 for revolutionary activity. He remained in the city of Tiflis (now Tbilisi), working briefly at one job after another. He soon joined the Tiflis branch of the Russian Social Democratic party.\n\nStalin then became a paid agitator, trying to incite revolt against the tsar. He edited illegal pamphlets and helped distribute them secretly. He organized strikes among the factory workers in Tiflis. Stalin’s ability won the attention of party leaders, and they sent him to form a communist organization in Batumi, a large port on the Black Sea.\n\nStalin’s revolutionist activities brought his first arrest in 1902. He was exiled to Siberia in 1903 but soon escaped. From 1902 to 1913 Stalin was arrested seven times for revolutionary activity, undergoing repeated imprisonment and exile. Like his fellow revolutionaries, he adopted one alias after another in order to evade arrest. He first called himself Koba, after a legendary Georgian hero. Later he changed his name to David, Soso, Chiijikov, Nijeradze, and, finally, Stalin.\n\nStalin Joins the Bolsheviks\n\nIn 1903 the Social Democratic party split into two factions. The more militant faction, headed by Vladimir Lenin, called itself the Bolsheviks. The other faction, opposed to Lenin’s creed of violence, was the Mensheviks. Stalin believed in Lenin’s policy, and so he joined the Bolsheviks. He became a party leader in his native Transcaucasia. He attended secret Bolshevik meetings in Tammerfors (now Tampere, Finland) in 1905; in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1906; and in London, England, in 1907.\n\nAt these meetings Stalin’s iron zeal and organizing ability won Lenin’s high regard, and the two men worked together closely. In 1912 Lenin made Stalin a member of the Bolshevik Party’s Central Committee. Meanwhile, Stalin briefly edited the newly founded Bolshevik newspaper Pravda (Russian: “Truth”). Going to St. Petersburg, Stalin organized a Bolshevik group in the Duma, the parliament of tsarist Russia.\n\nIn 1913 Stalin was arrested once again and was exiled to the grim Turukhansk region of Siberia, above the Arctic Circle. For the first time he failed to escape. In March 1917, however, the beginning of the Russian Revolution led by Aleksandr Kerensky freed all political prisoners, and Stalin returned to St. Petersburg, where he helped Lenin prepare the final plans for the history-making Bolshevik revolution. Stalin’s name seldom appears in records of the revolution, for he remained in the background as an administrator. His work was largely responsible for the success of the bloody October Revolution in 1917.\n\nDuring the civil war in 1918–20 following the revolution, Stalin served as political commissar with Bolshevik armies on several fronts. At that time political commissars were entrusted with military duties, and Stalin showed exceptional ability as a strategist and tactician. In 1918 he directed the successful defense of the vital city of Tsaritsyn against the White Army. Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad in his honor in 1925, though the name was later changed to Volgograd as part of an effort in the 1950s and ’60s to downgrade Stalin’s importance. In 1921 Stalin led the invasion that won his homeland, Georgia, for the communists, as the Bolsheviks now called themselves. The next year Stalin became Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and he methodically assumed increasing power.\n\nSome of Stalin’s unscrupulous methods worried even Lenin, who wrote, “Stalin is too rough.” Stalin, however, was undisturbed by criticism. Grimly he undermined his rival Leon Trotsky, the Soviet Union’s war minister and Lenin’s former close associate. In 1925, a year after Lenin’s death, Stalin forced Trotsky to resign as war minister and in 1927 expelled him from the party. Determined to eliminate the minority Trotskyite influence, Stalin exiled Trotsky from the Soviet Union in 1929 and had him assassinated in Mexico in 1940.\n\nHaving dealt with the opposition, Stalin was then supreme ruler. In a drive to industrialize and modernize the Soviet Union, he launched the first in a series of five-year plans in 1928. Stalin ordered the collectivization of farms. When peasants resisted, he ordered the state to seize their land and possessions. Well-to-do farmers, called kulaks, especially resented collectivization. Determined to root out all opposition, Stalin showed no mercy to the rebellious kulaks, and thousands were shot, exiled, or placed in concentration camps and worked to death under atrocious conditions. In 1932–33 the collectivization of farms created a famine in Ukraine that eliminated some 10 million peasants through death by starvation.\n\nBeginning in 1934, Stalin’s ruthless methods again drew world attention. To consolidate his place as supreme dictator, he conducted a series of purges. Claiming that a number of Red Army officers and scores of old Bolsheviks were “plotting against the state,” Stalin had them executed. Many of them were men who had helped Stalin in his drive to power. Members of the arts, the academic world, and the legal and diplomatic professions also lost a high proportion of victims to Stalin’s policies, as did the Soviet population at large. Stalin’s political victims were numbered in the tens of millions.\n\nPact with Germany\n\nIn August 1939 Stalin startled the world again when he brought the Soviet Union into a nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany. One month later Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II. The nonaggression pact permitted the Soviets to annex eastern Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania as well as attack Finland—all without German opposition. Stalin extended Soviet borders into outlying buffer areas.\n\nIn May 1941 Stalin made himself premier of the Soviet Union, replacing Vyacheslav Molotov. In June the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany. Stalin took command of the army and reorganized industry.\n\nIn high-level meetings in 1943 at Tehran, Iran, and early in 1945 at Yalta, Ukraine, Stalin issued inflexible terms to his allies, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain and President Franklin Roosevelt of the United States. Later in 1945, at Potsdam, Germany, Stalin made a pact with U.S. President Harry Truman on the reconstruction of defeated Germany. He then defiantly broke the terms of the accord.\n\nAfter the war’s end, Stalin seemed to be determined to make the Soviet Union dominant in Europe and to impose communism on the world. Through purges and other relentless measures, he forced communist governments on eastern Europe and sought to gain control of Italy and France. In the United Nations and in Allied councils, his obstructionist policy blocked efforts to establish a lasting peace. The Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948–49 that stopped all rail, road, and water communications with the West threatened a third global war.\n\nThe End of the Stalin Myth\n\nMany of the dates and facts of Stalin’s personal life remain uncertain. He was married in about 1904 to Ekaterina Svanidze, a native of Georgia. She died in 1907 of tuberculosis. Their son, Jacob, whom Stalin treated with contempt, died in a Nazi prison camp during World War II. In 1919 Stalin married Nadezhda Alliluyeva, who committed suicide in 1932. They had a daughter, Svetlana, and a son, Vasily, a Soviet air force officer. Vasily died in 1962. In 1967 Svetlana, who used her mother’s maiden name, defected to the United States. (She returned to the Soviet Union for two years, 1984–86.)\n\nJoseph Stalin died suddenly on March 5, 1953, in Moscow. So unexpected was his death that suspicions of foul play were voiced. However, four days after his death, his embalmed body was entombed alongside that of Lenin in Moscow’s Red Square.\n\nIn February 1956 Nikita Khrushchev, then first secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, addressed the 20th Soviet Communist Party Congress in secret session. He devoted three hours to the systematic destruction of Stalin’s image as a public hero. Among other charges, Stalin was now accused of wanton slaughter during the prewar purge trials; of being abnormally suspicious of associates; of causing thousands of unnecessary casualties during World War II by incompetently interfering with Red Army campaigns; and of failing to keep in personal touch with provincial areas. Above all, he was denounced for having paraded himself as a savior.\n\nEfforts to destroy the Stalin image (called de-Stalinization) were suspended for a time in late 1956 while Stalin’s own strong-arm methods were ruthlessly used to suppress a revolt in Hungary. At the 22nd Soviet Communist Party Congress in 1961, the denunciation of Stalin was resumed. Before that session was adjourned, Stalin’s body had been removed from Red Square and was reburied within the Kremlin walls among the graves of lesser Soviet heroes. Stalin’s name was removed from public buildings, streets, and factories, and the city of Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd."
