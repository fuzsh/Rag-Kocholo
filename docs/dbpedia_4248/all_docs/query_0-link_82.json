        "text": "MOSCOW, Aug. 10—Dmitri Shostakovich, the Soviet Union's most celebrated composer, died yesterday evening following hospitalization for a heart ailment at the beginning of this month. He was 68 years old.\n\nShostakovich's death was confirmed this morning by an official at the Kremlin‐run hospital at Kuntsevo on Moscow's western outskirts. The hospital cares for top‐level Soviet party and Government figures and celebrities. The composer, who was admitted 10 days ago to the special hospital's heart disease section, was reported to have died of heart failure at 6:30 P.M.\n\nThe official press agency, Tass, acknowledged this afternoon that Shostakovich had died “after a grave illness” buts offered no medical details. He was known to have suffered from heart ailments that dated to his hospitalization for a heart attack in 1964. However, Shostakovich had continued to compose up to his most recent illness and, according to Tass, had just written a new Sonata for Viola and Piano.\n\nThe diffident, near‐sighted composer Was perhaps best known among ordinary Russians for his “Leningrad” Symphony, which was written during World War II to honor that city's spirited resistance to the Nazi siege.\n\nBut he was also a committed Communist who accepted the sometimes harsh ideological criticism to which his modernistic works were periodically subjected. His state honors included two Orders of Lenin, the Soviet Union's highest civilian award.\n\nThough no family details have been given here, ShostaKovich is understood to be survived by his widow, Irina; a son, Maxim, who is a concert pianist and conductor, and daughter, Galina, a biologist. The younger Mr. Shostakovich was reported to be canceling conducting tour in Australia to return home.\n\nNo plans have been announced for the funeral.\n\nWrote Symphony at 19\n\nAs a composer, Dmitri Shostakovich literally exploded into fame with his First Symphony, composed in 1925 at the age of 19, when he was still a student at the Leningrad Conservatory. The score was first played on May 12, 1926, as his diploma piece, and from that time on the young Russian composer was steadily in the news.\n\nShostakovich, who was born in St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) on Sept. 25, 1906, was by far the most publicized and famous of contemporary Soviet composers. Part of this was due to the striking nature of his music, part of which was conditioned by the ideological phenomena of the nineteen‐twenties, thirties and early forties.\n\nShostakovich was a child of the Russian Revolution. He had been brought up and conditioned by the Soviet ideology, and considered his music an explession of the Russian people, in line with the doctrines espoused by the Central Committee of the U.S.S.R.\n\nThus his music became a rallying point for left‐wing intellectuals in Europe and America. During the Depression his influence was strongest.\n\nEven so, the composer could not always keep in the good graces of the Communist party. His first breach came with the opera, “Lady Macbeth of Mzensk.”\n\nMade Public Apologies\n\nThis opera, which had aroused great curiosity and, in some quarters, antagonism when it had been performed at the Metropolitan Opera House on Feb. 5. 1935, by Artur Rodzinski, the Cleveland Orchestra and a group of singers, was the subject of an article in Pravda, in Febraury, 1936. Pravda called the work “un‐Soviet, eccentric and leftist.”\n\nThe composer made public apologies, and redeemed him self in Soviet eyes with the Fifth Symphony, composed the next year. This symphony, with the possible exception of the First, is the most popular work that Shostakovich ever composed.\n\nIn 1946, however, Shostakovich was called down by Culture and Life for his Ninth Symphony, described by that organ as too “playful and fanciful a trifle.” The argument ran that the symphony did not express the serious aims of the Soviet people.\n\nMore serious was the rebuke that Shostakovich, Aram Khatchaturian and Serge Prokofiev, together with four lesser composers, received on Feb. 11, 1948, from the Central Committee of the Communist party. Again Shostakovich's work was declared “leftist” and an expression of “bourgeois decadence.” Shostakovich promised to “correct his mistakes.”\n\nHe did so by composing a series of work that adhered closely to the party line and was rewarded with a Stalin Prize in 1950.\n\nRebukes Withdrawn in 1957\n\nIn 1957, the Central Committee's rebuke of 1948 was officially reversed in a speech by Dimitri T. Shepilov, then Communist party secretary, to a congress of Soviet composers in Moscow, and Shostakovich and Khatchaturian were elected secretaries of the Union of Soviet Composers.\n\nShostakovich visited the United States three times. The first time was in 1949, when he was sent here to make a speech at the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace sponsored by the National Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions.\n\nHe and a 17‐member delegation arrived on March 23 and on March 29 were asked to go home by the State Department. The reason given was that the delegation had been admitted only for the three‐day session of the conference. Many citizens and publications had attacked the conference as a “Red front.”\n\nIn October, 1959, Shostakovich arrived for a much more meaningful visit of a month, which had been worked out under the cultural exchange agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. He came with four other composers — Tikhon Khrennikov, Dimitri Kabalevsky, Konstantin Dankevich and Fikret Amirov —and a critic and musicologist, Boris Yarustovsky. The delegation visited symphony orchestras in a number of cities and heard performances of their own works as well as those of American composers.\n\nMr. Khrennikov, who was General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers, did most of the talking for the group and seemed to discourage them from circulating independently and even from answering direct questions when they appeared together. If Shostakovich chafed under this restriction, he gave no public sign of it.\n\nThe composer, looking scarred from years of illnesses but full of pent‐up energy, sailed into New York aboard the Soviet liner Mikhail Lermontov in June, 1973, for his third American visit. His destination was Evanston, Ill., where Northwestern University awarded him an honorary doctorate of fine arts.\n\nWhile in New York, he attended one of the rug concerts of the New York Philharmonic, opting for a regular seat, though. Upon his return home he said he found the experience interesting, but was left with mixed feelings since the casual demeanor of an audience lounging on the floor must, he thought, instill a “neglectful attitude” toward serious music.\n\nShostakovich did not join the Communist party until 1960, and his ups‐and‐downs with it did not end when he did. His Symphony No. 13 was suppressed by former Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1963 because it included poems by Yevgeny Yevtushenko that dealt harshly with anti‐Semitism. That same year, however, a revised version of the oncescandalous “Lady Macbeth of Mzensk” was produced in Moscow with official and popular approval. Retitled “Katerina Ismailova,” the new version of the opera was introduced here by the New York City Opera on March 4, 1965.\n\nOn Sept. 24, 1966, the eve of his 60th birthday, Shostakovich was given two of the Soviet Union's highest awards. One was the Hero of Socialist Labor title, the other the Order of Lenin.\n\nThe following day, at a festive birthday concert given in Moscow, composer Dmitri Kabalevsky referred to Shostakovich as “the greatest musician of our time.” It was reported that Shostakovich responded by making “shy and clumsy bows as usual.” In that concert, his First Symphony was conducted by his son, Maxim, and the premiere of his Concerto No. 2 for Cello and Orchestra was given with Mstislav Rostropovich as soloist.\n\nWrangle Over a Score\n\nPerhaps the most publicized episode in relation to Shostakovich's music came with the American premiere of his Seventh, or “Leningrad,” Symphony, a work that lasts about 80 minutes. The symphony was composed in 1942 as a musical commemoration of the heroic defenders of that beleaguered city. The score was copied on microfilm and flown to the United States.\n\nLeopold Stokowski, Mr. Rodziaski and Serge Koussevitzky all contended for the right to perform the music first, but the honor went to Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the score on July 19, 1942, with the N.B.C. Symphony on a radio broadcast.\n\nThe Columbia Broadcasting System paid the composer $10,000 in 1944 for first‐broadcast rights to his Eighth Symphony.\n\nShostakovich's musical style changed but little from that shown in his astonishing First Symphony, and there were those who maintained that he never composed a better work. All of the elements of his style were already apparent—the wide melodic skips, the purposeful dissonances, the scherzolike dance tunes and unexpected harmonic ljuxtapositions, and the frequent marchlike sections.\n\nHis music also was characterized by long, slow movements, usually in largo tempo, which his admirers called the most significant since Beethoven, and which his detractors called so much pompous nonsense.\n\nHis most popular works were symphonic in nature, with the First, Fifth and Sixth Symphonies receiving most performances in this country. His “Leningrad” Symphony was seldom played after the war, and his earlier “October” (the Second) and “May Day” (the Third) Symphonies almost never.\n\nIn addition, Shostakovich composed a popular Piano Concerto and much chamber music, the latter including a String Quintet. Much theater and ballet music came from his pen, and he was one of the most prominent of contemporary composers for the films. His Preludes and Fugues and other works for piano solo still appear on many present‐day concert programs.\n\nAn article published in the September, 1968, Issue of Neva, a Leningrad literary journal, noted that Shostakovich's “personality and life are not well known to us—it is not a question of his life, which was uneventful, but the inner biography of the man. Shostakovich does not belong to those who willingly share their thoughts, reminisce, or who open widely the doors of their creative workshops.\n\n“Most examples of art usually derive from autobiographical events: with Shostakovich, we cart only suppose this. His internal world is closed to the gaze of outsiders. About his work he says very little, and that dryly and laconically, limiting himself to bland information.”\n\nShostakovich did speak occasionally of his early years. In 1959 he said. “In my early childhood, I liked very much to listen to music. My neighbor studied music, and I used to hang around outside his apartment listening through the door.” This, he said, was the most powerful memory of his childhood.\n\nHis grandfather had been exiled to Siberia for participation in a Polish liberation movement, but his father returned to St. Petersburg and became a chemist in a Government bureau of weights and measures.\n\nShostakovich studied piano as a small boy and showed an interest in composing by the time he was 11 years old. He was 13 when he entered the conservatory of his native city. Aleksandr Glazunoff was conservatory director at the time, and a writer has recalled that a familiar sight in the school corridors was that of the fat, expansive composer deep in conversation with a small, bony student with thin lips, the boy Shostakovich.\n\nHis father died before Shostakovich graduated from the conservatory, and the youth earned the money for his studies by playing the piano for silent movies. He received his degree as pianist in 1923 and was graduated as a composer in 1925.\n\nIn appearance, Shostakovich retained a boyish quality most of his life. Thin, bespectacled, studious‐looking, with a heavy lock of hair generally dangling over his forehead, he had nothing esoteric about his appearance. He liked sports—volleyball, tennis and soccer football —and played a good game of chess.\n\nShowed Little Temperament\n\nHe had a spacious apartment in Moscow and a pleasant country home about 30 miles from Moscow that he rented from the Soviet Government. Although he was a chainsmoker and rather nervous in his movements, he was not temperamental and could compose as easily in the city as in the country. He worked quickly, usually composing without a piano and notating his ideas directly on the score. He was a brilliant pianist and frequently played solo parts in premieres of his own works.\n\nWhether in or out of favor with the Communist party, he lived a comfortable, even affluent, life, receiving composing fees, royalties and prizes that amounted to handsome sums by anybody's reckoning.\n\nIn an interview some years ago, he indicated that criticism, whether political or artistic, never bothered him unduly.\n\n“My work has been criticized ever since I began to write music,” he said. “Some of it, I admit, was bad. But who can say that my career has suffered from this criticism? My works are played all over Russia. Just because one work is criticized does not mean that orchestras stop playing the others. And I go on writing and the Government goes on supporting me, and generously, too.”\n\nLink With Yevtushenko\n\nWhile the composer's Symphony No. 13 was a setting of Yevgeny Yevtushenko poems that brought on Premier Khrushchev's displeasure, and No. 14 was in effect a song cycle rather than a symphony, his 15th saw a return to his old style, It was given its New York premiere in October 1972, by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nHarold C. Schonberg, music critic of The New York Times, railed the work a pastiche, in, a way, of familiar themes and unconvincing. “The materials are weak,” Mr. Schonberg wrote, “practiced as the hand may be.”\n\nMr. Shostakovich suffered a heart attack in 1966, when he was 59 years old. He broke a leg in a fall the next year and in 1968 was replaced as head of the Composers Union of the Russian Federation. Two years after that, he was reported to be recovering from a crippling ailment that for a time had rendered him unable to play the piano and made walking difficult.\n\nPrograms of Shostakovich's music were played this weekend at the Tanglewood festival. A review appears on Page 33.\n\nHARRY SAND\n\nHarry Sand, a lawyer since, 1927, died yesterday in Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 72 years: old and lived at 55 East 9th Street."
