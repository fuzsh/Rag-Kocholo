They, too, come courtesy of Matt From College station. Matt's copy is on the Czechoslovakian Supraphon label. Since all of the information on the label is in English, my strong guess is the record was manufactured for export to either the USA or, more likely, the UK. My understanding, however, is that the recording was originally issued on the German Telefunken label. I think the fidelity on this is quite outstanding for a 1935 recording.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to do as much research on Aulikkia Rautawaara and Peter Anders before the update as I would like. My dsl service has gone down and the telephone company repair office says it might be out for as long as 48 hours before a technician gets around to fixing it. The only Internet access I have as I put this update together is a neighbor's unsecured wireless hotspot that fades in and out if I move my laptop into my kitchen. That is not an especially convenient circumstance or location to do much online research in. I guess I ought to be happy that I at least have that - and that someone in the neighborhood is trusting enough leave their hotspot set for public access.\n\nI do know that both Rautawaara and Anders were quite popular in 1930s Germany. Rautawaara was from Finland. Because Peter Anders was a favorite singer of Adolf Hitler, he was allowed to avoid military service during World War II and instead participated in wartime propaganda performances. I have not been able to find out whether he was, in fact, an actual supporter of the Nazi regime or simply collaborated for non-idelolgical reasons. Regardless, after the war. he fell out of favor with the public as a result of his association with it.\n\n- Dismuke\n\nIf you have questions or comments about the music or would simply enjoy interacting with friendly people who share your interest in it, join in the conversation on Dismuke's Message Board.\n\nEXTRA\n\nThis section will present 78 rpm recordings that do not fall within the range of the vintage pop and jazz fare that I usually present.

I bid on it primarily because of its connection with the local history in my area. Here in Fort Worth, WBAP has been the dominant AM radio station since it was founded by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspaper in the early 1920s.\n\nThe Sunflower Girl of WBAP was Bessie Coldiron who performed on the station on and off from late 1925 through at least 1929.\n\nAccording to an October 31, 1926 Dallas Morning News article, Coldiron made a visit to Fort Worth in late 1925 where:\n\n\"...the Hired Hand, announcer at WBAP, heard her and prevailed upon her to play a trial daylight program for that station. The fans were instantly pleased and what was intended to be just a few concerts during her visit to Texas turned into a five month's engagement....During her radio engagement last winter the applause mail received was often over 4,000 letters a week and before each night program scores of wires, some filed two or three days ahead, were asking for numbers. It was a slack day that did not bring at least one dozen boxes of candy, among other gifts of all description from all parts of the world. And she didn't eat candy because of a feminine whim that it was fattening - she didn't want to weigh over 104.\"\n\nBecause there were fewer radio stations in the 1920s compared with today, it was not uncommon for even relatively weak stations to be picked up at night in distant cities. It was standard practice, therefore, for radio sections in local newspapers to also feature program listings for and reviews of stations in far-away cities. Positive reviews of Coldiron's performances on WBAP were mentioned in newspapers as far away as Ohio and Indiana. A January 1928 issue of the Decatur Evening Herald in Decatur, Illinois wrote:\n\n\"Fifty-five songs in a trifle over nine minutes was the record of the Sunflower Girl of WBAP. The Hired Hand called the selections as he wished and she sang snatches from the choruses. 100 per cent, entertaining\"\n\nColdiron derived her broadcast name from the fact that she was from Kansas - the \"Sunflower State.\" My basis for this is a mention in a 1927 magazine distributed to employees of the Frisco Railroad which did a profile on an elderly Civil War veteran who was retired from the railroad who stated that his hobbies included \"listening in on the radio to programs broadcast by the Kansas Sunflower girl at the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram broadcasting station.\" The fact that she was from Kansas was also mentioned in 1926 Dallas Morning News stories.\n\nAfter her initial five month engagement at WBAP, Coldiron she spent the spring and summer of 1926 as a headliner on a successful vaudeville circuit tour at various Majestic-Orpheum theaters throughout the South.\n\nWhen the vaudeville tour came to an end, Coldiron returned to WBAP after stopping in New York City in September 1926 where she cut a handful of sides for Brunswick Records. The sides were issued on Brunswick's subsidiary label, Vocalion. She also recorded four sides for Columbia in Chicago in June, 1927 which is where the two featured here come from.\n\nBeyond the above, I have no further biographical information about Coldiron or what became of her. A few Dallas Morning News radio listings in 1938 and a great many in 1940 list \"The Sunflower Girl\" as performing on station KGKO in Fort Worth. Like WBAP, KGKO was owned by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Under a very unusual arrangement, WBAP shared its 50,000 clear channel frequency with Dallas based WFAA, owned by the Dallas Morning News. This arrangement meant that each station was off the air half the time. Star-Telegram owner Amon Carter purchased KGKO as an outlet for programing during the times that WBAP had to sign off to make way for WFAA. Eventually, The Dallas Morning News purchased half ownership in KGKO and the call letters were abolished with its 570 regional frequency becoming WFAA when WBAP occupied the 820 clear channel frequency and vise versa. The two stations would sign off every three hours and swap places on the dial. This highly unique arrangement lasted all the way up to 1970 when WBAP assumed sole control over the 820 frequency. I have not been able to determine whether the 1938/1940 \"Sunflower Girl\" was a return to Fort Worth airwaves by Coldiron or whether station management merely assigned that stage name to some other performer.\n\nA search through the Social Security death records turns up two results for \"Bessie Coldiron.\" Bessie E. Coldiron was born June 4. 1902 and passed away February 28, 1990. Her last known zip code is listed as Hayward, California. Another Bessie Coldiron was born July 25, 1909 and died in August 1993. Her last known address was near Detroit, Michigan. Another online source suggests that this second Coldiron might have had a middle initial of \"A.\"\n\nI would think 1902 would be a more likely birth date for The Sunflower Girl as that would have made her 23 when she began performing on WBAP. A 1909 birth date would have made her 16 - young, but certainly not unheard of in show business. Of course, it is entirely possible that neither of the two Bessie Coldirons listed in the database was the one who performed as The Sunflower Girl.\n\nIf anyone has any additional information about Bessie Coldiron, I would be very interested in knowing about it.\n\nAs you listen to these recordings, see if you agree with me that Coldiron's voice sounds very similar to Ruth Etting's.\n\n- - - - -\n\nUpdate: I located the following mention in the June 10, 1938 El Paso Herald-Post:\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Ray Coldiron have returned to their home in Kansas City, after a visit with Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Platt Mrs. Coldiron, radio singer, sang over Station WBAP as the Sunflower Girl for many years.\"\n\n- Dismuke"
