        "text": "CD Review – John Ireland\n\nSinfonia Of London John Wilson\n\nChandos CHSA 5293 [67:16]\n\nThese days John Wilson and his superlative Sinfonia of London orchestra seem they can play no wrong, with critical plaudits and awards being gathered by each new release. They have all been reviewed on these pages, but I realise that the heavier fare on some albums may not always appeal to those readers who admire John for his earlier work as a conductor of light music. This latest should not be among them.\n\nRead the review here...\n\nCD Review – Found in Dreams …Helen Habershon (clarinet)/John Linehan (piano) divine art dda 25225 [57:12]\n\nWhen I read a record company referring to a performer/composer and using the words \"easy listening\" and \"in the light music tradition\", I soon have their latest CD plopping through my letterbox. So it was with clarinettist Helen Habershon, who I must admit I had not heard of before. Evidently, this is her fourth album, with one receiving 'Album of the Month' and two 'Album of the Week' accolades on Classic FM.\n\nRead the review here...\n\nA near five-hundred page, fully-illustrated (often with rarely seen images), chronological exploration of key landmarks underpinning John Barry’s illustrious career. Written in the form of extensively researched essays concentrating on one specific score, over forty are represented, from the first, Beat Girl, to the last, Enigma. Whether highly acclaimed or lower key films, each chapter sets out, clearly and accurately, the circumstances surrounding the inception and completion of the score under scrutiny and in doing so, provides fresh insights into John Barry’s remarkable legacy.\n\nPlease note that inclusive of packaging this book weighs around 2 kg and the cost of posting it varies enormously depending upon location. So, when placing your order, please provide us with your full address. You will then receive an email detailing costs inclusive of postage to your country, and how to pay. Thank you!\n\nOrder now via this email link\n\nSomm Recordings SOMM D0638 [70:59]\n\n'Here is another slightly left-field release of the kind that makes this label so fascinating. It will definitely be of interest to lovers of brass bands and, indeed, anyone who favours instruments being blown rather than bowed. So, we have the principals from four of the UK's top bands, including Black Dyke, Foden's, and Brighouse & Rastrick … don’t know why the fourth gets no mention.\n\nRead the review here...\n\nComing soon from Windmill Records, The Stringbeat Years: Songs accompanied by John Barry, a 4-CD box-set comprising of 144 tracks, a 24-page booklet (replete with period photographs and comprehensive notes) and including ten bonus tracks (among them the CD debut of the first ever cover version of a John Barry instrumental composition).\n\nAdam Faith fans will experience every song he recorded with John Barry, thereby featuring – for the first time – the film versions of ‘Mix me a Person’, ‘The Time has Come’, and ‘What a Whopper’ (slightly shortened). There’s also an unique opportunity to hear the original version of ‘Ah, Poor Little Baby’, making its premiere appearance on CD.\n\nThe box-set is limited to 500 copies and is only £16.99 post-free in the UK (postage costs for elsewhere in the world to be determined when stock arrives), so don’t miss out! It will only be available direct from Windmill!\n\nPlease indicate your interest without commitment by emailing us and you’ll be contacted as soon as it becomes available.\n\nIt is with regret that we record the death of the conductor, composer and arranger Johnny Gregory, who died at his home in Gerrards Cross, Berkshire on April 23rd 2020, about six months short of his 96th birthday.\n\nDuring his long career, he wrote the scores for fourteen films, (the last in 2000) and TV shows, and was principal conductor of the BBC Radio Orchestra between 1973 to 1974.\n\nHe made numerous recordings, both under his own name and (possibly more famously) as Chaquito.\n\nGregory used a number of other pseudonyms and his orchestra often appeared under the name of The Cascading Strings.\n\nA comprehensive article about his life and work is in preparation and will be published on the LLMMG website in due course.\n\nTony Clayden\n\nMay 2020\n\nBalsom Ensemble\n\nWarner Classics 0190295370060 (57’02)\n\nIf I can’t always have my favourite French horns I’ll settle for the trumpet, especially when it’s played by Alison Balsom who, although still in her early 40s, has been making CDs for 17 years and this, her first since 2016, is No.13. She has said that the making of it has been by far the most enjoyable recording experience she has had.\n\nRead the review here..."
