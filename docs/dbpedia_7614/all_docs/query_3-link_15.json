        "text": "After scaring some skateboarders away from a dead girl's resting place, Ichigo, apologizing to her, promises to bring her some new flowers to replace those damaged by the skaters, telling her to go to heaven quickly.[69] That evening, Ichigo, seeing Rukia Kuchiki in his bedroom, initially mistakes her for a burglar, but when Ichigo realizes only he can see the intruder, he accepts Rukia is a ghost. When he refuses to believe her explanation about Shinigami, Rukia binds him with Kidō. As a Hollow attacks the house, Ichigo, upon hearing his sister's pleas for help, breaks free and rushes to stop the Hollow.[70] Surprised at its monstrous appearance, Ichigo charges at it with a baseball bat in an attempt to release the captive Yuzu. Rukia frees Yuzu, but Ichigo's reckless actions force Rukia to shield him with her body, severely injuring her. Seeing Ichigo's determination to protect his family, Rukia offers to temporarily turn him into a Shinigami by piercing his chest with her Zanpakutō and transferring half of her power to him. Absorbing almost all of Rukia's power, Ichigo, making short work of the Hollow, collapses afterwards.[71][72]\n\nThe following morning, Ichigo is horrified when he discovers Rukia is now a part of his class, and she has altered his family's memories of the attack. She insists he must help her do her job while she awaits the return of her powers. When Ichigo refuses, Rukia, forcing his soul out of his body, takes him to a park where a Hollow is about to attack. She persuades Ichigo to perform her duties.[73] After undergoing some training with Rukia to improve his combat tactics, a Hollow bursts into his room.[74] Rukia, who has taken to staying in his closet, forces Ichigo's soul out of his body. He cuts off part of the Hollow's mask, revealing it to be Sora Inoue.[75] Explaining the origins of Hollows, Rukia states Orihime Inoue is in danger, as Hollows often attack their relatives. They rush to Orihime's apartment, where Ichigo manages to stop the Hollow before it eats Orihime's and Tatsuki's souls.[76]\n\nAt Orihime's apartment, Ichigo initially panics when he sees her soul separated from her body, but Rukia explains there is still time to save her. Still intent on eating Orihime, the Hollow attacks. During Ichigo's subsequent fight with Acidwire, Orihime, stepping in between them, gets bitten. Her influence temporarily restores Sora's conscience, prompting him to purify himself with Ichigo's Zanpakutō. Rukia explains to Ichigo Hollows defeated by a Zanpakutō are purified and sent to Soul Society. As Ichigo and Orihime talk, Rukia, healing her, erases her memory of the event.[77]\n\nAt school, Ichigo fends off Mizuiro Kojima's suggestions of a relationship with Rukia and Reiichi Ōshima's threats about his hair color. Ichigo notices Sado has a parakeet with him, and there is a spirit inside it. When Rukia confirms it is just a lonely Plus, which they should send to the Soul Society that night, Ichigo complains about missing another night of sleep.[78] Upon returning home, Ichigo helps with the injured from a car accident, among them Sado. Ichigo notes the wound on his back was inflicted by a Hollow.[79] The next morning, Ichigo tracks the spirit inside the parakeet using Reiraku in order to find Sado.[80] When they find Sado, he runs away from them. Telling him it is dangerous to be by himself, Ichigo is distracted by an ill Karin. At Rukia's behest, he brings her home. Karin tells him she saw the Plus' memories, and he saw his mother being murdered.[81] After placing her in her bed, Ichigo, rushing to help Sado, reflects on how long it had been since he last saw Karin cry.[82]\n\nIchigo arrives to take over fighting Shrieker.[83] When Rukia releases him from his body, he, injuring Shrieker, notices small creatures nearby, and is told they spit out explosive leeches. After asking Shrieker if he was the one who killed the child's parents, which he confirms, Ichigo, catching one of the leeches, slams it into Shrieker's mouth. When the Hollow refuses to trigger them, Ichigo, ripping out its tongue, stabs his sword into Shrieker's leg.[84] Asking him how it feels to be unable to move or fight and if he can savor what it is like to be murdered, Ichigo cuts through his head, and Shrieker is pulled into Hell. After Rukia explains about Hell, she tells the Plus they will send him to Soul Society, and Ichigo says he might see his mother there.[85]\n\nThe following day, Ichigo, noting Sado's memory has been erased, receives a Gikongan from Rukia, who, after explaining its purpose, forces him to try one. Unconvinced by the artificial soul's personality, Ichigo is forced to leave it in his body when they receive an order from Soul Society.[86] After defeating the Hollow, a concerned Ichigo, rushing back, sees his body jump out of an upstairs window and run away extremely fast. As they chase after him, Rukia tells him it must be a Mod soul.[87] As Rukia explains what she means to an angry Ichigo, he, asking if Rukia is alright with the idea of the Mod Souls being created and killed all for Soul Society's convenience, wonders how the Mod Soul must feel about being persecuted and gaining his body.[88] Receiving a warning about a Hollow, they, hurrying to its location, find the Mod Soul is fighting it. Rushing to his aid, Ichigo reminds him he is using his body. As the two continue arguing, they defeat the Hollow together. When Kisuke Urahara removes the Mod Soul from Ichigo's body, Ichigo, asking him what he is going to do with it, asks who he is. When Rukia gives the Mod Soul to Ichigo, he thanks her for not throwing him away.[89]\n\nAfter failing to find a body to place the Mod Soul in, Ichigo, placing him in a plushie, decides to call him Kon. On the 16th of June, Ichigo, woken by Kon, scrambles to hide him and Rukia as Yuzu comes into the room to say Mizuiro is waiting for him. Apologizing to Mizuiro, he, noting his memory has been erased, remembers Rukia had told him Urahara must have worked hard. As Rukia leaves, Ichigo, complaining about Isshin not waking him up as usual, notices the date.[90] That night, the Kurosakis hold a family meeting to discuss their trip to Masaki's grave the following day. Ichigo asks Rukia if he can take the day off from the Shinigami work, as it is the day Masaki was killed.[91]\n\nOn the 17th of July, the Kurosaki family visits Masaki's grave. Annoyed that Rukia followed them, Ichigo, becoming angry when she asks if Masaki was killed by a Hollow, notices the same girl he saw the night Masaki died, and, running after her, tells Rukia he killed Masaki.[92] At Masaki's grave, Ichigo, watching his family's antics, reflects on his mother's death and its impact on his family.[93] Sensing the Reiatsu of a Hollow, Ichigo realizes the twins are easy targets.[94] As the Hollow attempts to eat Yuzu, Ichigo, arriving, cuts the twins free. Demanding to know why the girl he saw when Masaki died is there, he asks if she is controlled by the Hollow.[95] When Rukia tells him the Hollow is called Grand Fisher and it uses the girl as a lure to trick and devour Humans who have high levels of spiritual power, Ichigo, realizing Grand Fisher killed his mother, lunges at it. Stopping Rukia from interfering, he, insisting on fighting alone, instructs her to mind his sisters.[96]\n\nStruggling against Grand Fisher, Ichigo is subjected to the Hollow's Transcribe ability. Transforming his lure into an image of Masaki, Grand Fisher explains about his ability.[97][98] As he pierces Ichigo's chest, Ichigo, stabbing the Hollow's chest. grabs his arm, saying he has finally caught him, and slashes open his chest.[99] Transferring its form into the lure, Grand Fisher escapes. As Rukia tries to convince Ichigo he cannot fight him any more, he, insisting he can and the Hollow is still not dead yet, soon collapses.[100] Using most of her strength to heal his stomach wound, Rukia leaves his other injuries. When Ichigo awakens, in his Human body, in great pain, Rukia reminds him the wounds his soul receives will show up when he returns to his body. When Ichigo asks her if he lost, she tells him he won, since the Hollow fled and nobody died. Saying Grand Fisher is not dead, Ichigo walks off.[101]\n\nWhen Ichigo, at Masaki's grave, apologizes for not being able to avenge her, Isshin notes the time has gone by quickly, and it has already been ten years since Masaki died. When Ichigo corrects his error, Isshin states he was \"so close\". When Ichigo loudly complains about this, Isshin says Masaki can rest easily if she sees him being so lively. When he starts smoking a cigarette, Ichigo says he thought he quit smoking when Karin and Yuzu were born. Isshin explains he smokes on this one occasion, as the only time Masaki complimented his looks while they were dating is when she saw him smoking.[102] When Ichigo asks why nobody blames him for her death, Isshin, dismissing the suggestion, says Masaki would be mad at him, and she would gladly die to protect her child. Reminding Ichigo he is the one the woman he loved gave her life to protect, he, telling him to live his life well, leaves. Asking Rukia if her powers are returning, Ichigo asks her to allow him to remain a Shinigami for a while longer regardless. He says he wants to become stronger so he can defeat Hollows, protect those who are targeted, and defeat Grand Fisher; otherwise, he will not be able to face Masaki.[103]\n\nWhile Yuzu and Isshin are watching Don Kanonji's Ghost Bust TV program one Wednesday evening, Ichigo asks Karin why she is not watching it with them. She tells Ichigo she can see spirits about as clearly as he can, and is not interested in the ghost show. Remembering she saw the Hollow who attacked the house when he first met Rukia, Ichigo realizes she might be able to see Shinigami too. The next morning at school, Orihime, performing Don Kanonji's pose as Ichigo arrives in class, asks him to do the pose with her. As Ichigo's friends all do the pose, Ichigo tells Keigo he is not going to the live recording of Ghost Bust at the abandoned hospital in Karakura, despite his attempts to convince him to go.[104] The following Wednesday, Ichigo accompanies his family to watch Ghost Bust being filmed. When Orihime apologizes to him for trying to get him to do Don Kanonji's pose, he, telling her it is okay, reveals Keigo and Mizuiro know he despises it, but yet still do it anyway. When asked why he came, he, stating Isshin and Yuzu are huge fans of the show, says they would look pitiful if just the two of them went. When Orihime tells him he is so kind, Ichigo dismisses it as normal.[105]\n\nTelling him he must be tired from his dual life, Rukia instructs him to use this chance to relax. Surprised she is concerned about his health, Ichigo, asking if there really is a spirit in the hospital, says the Shinigami would have dealt with it already. Rukia says it is likely to be a Jibakurai, a soul on its way to becoming a Hollow.[106] When Ichigo asks Rukia if they should perform Konsō on it to prevent it from becoming a Hollow, she says it takes months to turn into a Hollow. She says to do it after the show to avoid trouble in case of a struggle, but Ichigo is unconvinced. Meanwhile, Don Kanonji jams his staff into the partially open hole in the Jibakurai's chest.[107] As Ichigo tries to stop him, he is caught by security. Urahara frees Ichigo's Shinigami form from his body, allowing him to knock Kanonji away from the Jibakurai. As Ichigo realizes the medium can see him, the Jibakurai vanishes in an explosion.[108] As Kanonji promises to send Ichigo to heaven too, Rukia shouts at him to look up, where they see the spirit reforming into a Hollow on top of the hospital. As Ichigo and Kanonji bicker, the Hollow charges at them. Ichigo fends off its attack, and when the Hollow gets its head stuck in a wall, Ichigo drags Kanonji inside.[109][110]\n\nIchigo insists they stay inside to avoid the audience being caught up in the fighting. When the Hollow attacks again, Ichigo's Zanpakutō becomes stuck in the ceiling. Ichigo realizes he never thought about the corridors being too confined to use his sword in. When the Hollow glues Ichigo's hands together, Kanonji, jamming its mouth open with his staff, frees Ichigo's blade.[111] When Ichigo's sword becomes embedded in the Hollow's shoulder, it drags him up to the roof. Freeing himself, Ichigo takes advantage of the open space to defeat the Hollow. When Kanonji praises him, Ichigo, telling him to stop his antics, explains it is the same spirit Kanonji thought he had sent to heaven. Stating regretting it is pointless, as he did not know, Ichigo directs Kanonji to the crowd. Kanonji thanks him, complimenting his courage, quick wits, and strength, and asks that they work together in the future. When Ichigo agrees to help him once in a while, Kanonji forces him to take a Don Kanonji fan club card, signed \"to my #1 pupil\".[112][113]\n\nThe following day, Rukia helps Ichigo and his friends get out of trouble for their actions at the abandoned hospital when they are brought before the principal and Kagine, who states their escapades were broadcast live nationwide.[114] That afternoon, Ichigo, answering the door, meets Don Kanonji. Closing and locking the door, he demands to know how he found out about his house. When Kanonji reveals he invited Rukia along, Ichigo realizes it was her who told him where he lived. Seeing Kanonji, Yuzu knocks Ichigo over while opening the door. When Rukia's Denreishinki alerts her to a Hollow, they rush off to fight it.[115]\n\nAfter numerous incidents of arriving at the supposed site of a Hollow attack, only to find there is no Hollow, Ichigo and Rukia bicker. When Ichigo asks if there is another Shinigami defeating the Hollows before him, Rukia tells him Shinigami are strictly sorted, and it should not be the case.[116] Ichigo tries to keep away from Rukia at school to avoid the rumors since their appearance on Ghost Bust. While discussing his high grades with Keigo and Mizuiro, Ichigo notes his orange hair causes him a lot of trouble, as older students pick on him and teachers watch him closely, so he studies so the school does not complain about him. Rukia drags Ichigo off, prompting him to complain about the rumors regarding them. When she tells him to complain later, as there is a Hollow, Ichigo tells her he will not forgive her if it is not there this time, but they find nothing.[117] After another incident following school, Ichigo tells Rukia to do something about the problem as she drags his body from its hiding place. The pair are approached by Uryū Ishida, who asks Ichigo if it is correct he can see spirits, which Ichigo denies is even possible. When a new Hollow appears, Uryū, killing it, introduces himself, saying he hates Shinigami and Ichigo.[118][119]\n\nAt school, Ichigo, reflecting upon his encounter with Uryū, wonders why he would say such things to a complete stranger and why Uryū was angry. Realizing he cannot remember his full name, Ichigo lists off possible names out loud. Overhearing him, Orihime, stating Uryū is in their class, takes him to the handicrafts club to show him Uryū. When Orihime asks what happened between Ichigo and Uryū, Ichigo dismisses it as no big deal.[120] After school, Ichigo follows Uryū as he leaves. Asking him if he intends to follow him home, Uryū notes he had noticed him spying on him from the classroom doorway. When Ichigo applauds him, Uryū states it is due to Ichigo's inability to restrain his spiritual power, and he lacks the ability to sense Reiatsu, as evidenced by him not noticing Uryū until that day. Revealing he noticed Ichigo's unusually high spiritual power and his acquisition of Shinigami powers, Uryū, inviting Ichigo to fight him, says Shinigami are unnecessary in the Human World.[121]\n\nThough Ichigo ridicules the idea, Uryū succeeds in convincing him to fight him, and he uses Kon to free his Shinigami form. Using some Hollow bait to cause Hollows to gather in Karakura Town, Uryū states the one who defeats the most Hollows within twenty-four hours wins. When Ichigo, angered by this, demands to know why he is exposing the town's residents to such danger, Uryū tells him not to worry, as they will kill all the Hollows.[122] As Ichigo tries to make him undo it, Uryū tells him Hollows will soon flood the town, and he should try to protect as many people as possible. When Uryū tells him Hollows tend to prefer people with high spiritual power, Ichigo runs off to find Karin.[123] After slaying his third Hollow and saving a pair of Pluses, Ichigo, struggling to remember where Karin is, sends Kon to get Rukia's Denreishinki to aid in reacting to the Hollows.[124] Defeating the Hollows between the Kurosaki Clinic and the last place where he saw Karin, Ichigo thinks it should be safe for her now.[125]\n\nHaving found Uryū, Ichigo bickers with Kon when he arrives. Unable to attract their attention by shouting, Uryū fires an arrow at Ichigo, who, blocking it, insists it is a battle between him and Uryū, and the amount of Hollows they beat is irrelevant. As Kon points out there is a large crack forming in the sky, and Uryū begins firing arrows into the group of Hollows, Ichigo tells him there are too many, and they need to come up with a strategy. Asking him if he is afraid, Uryū charges towards the Hollows. When Rukia explains the fall of the Quincy at the hands of the Shinigami, Ichigo, running after Uryū, attacks several Hollows around him.[126][127] When Ichigo, telling Uryū he does not know or care about whether the Shinigami or Quincy were right, expresses frustration at his methods, Uryū tells him he thought the Shinigami were correct until his sensei was killed in front of him. Telling Ichigo of his sensei's attempts to convince the Shinigami to work together with the remaining Quincy and how he died fighting a group of huge Hollows without achieving that goal, Uryū says he must prove the strength of the Quincy to the Shinigami. Pointing out his sensei's wish was to work together, Ichigo, asking if he will do that now, says fighting back to back is the best way to deal with the situation.[128]\n\nAs the two begrudgingly work together, Ichigo, telling him his approach to their fight is endangering the people he wants to protect, says he will not forgive him for that. They agree to beat each other up after the Hollows have been dealt with, but as they prepare to attack a horde of Hollows, a Menos Grande appears. As Ururu Tsumugiya, Tessai Tsukabishi, Jinta Hanakari, and Urahara arrive to fight the Hollows, Urahara tells Ichigo to concentrate on fighting the Menos.[129] Seeing its size, Ichigo, questioning if it is in fact a Hollow, is shocked to see it eating the nearby Hollows. Saying there is no way they can figure out how to fight such a monster and they will have to simply cut it repeatedly until it succumbs to its injuries, Ichigo, charging towards the Menos, attacks its leg, but is knocked back by the unfazed Menos.[130]\n\nNoticing Ichigo's power flows into his bow when he touches it, Uryū, planning to fire an enlarged arrow at the Menos, tells Ichigo to increase his power to maximum. Stating he never controls his energy output, Ichigo says it must be at maximum all the time. When the Menos starts to charge a Cero, Ichigo, rushing towards it, blocks the Cero with his Zanpakutō. His power increasing as he resists the Cero, Ichigo repels the attack, injuring the Menos in the process.[131] As the Menos retreats, Ichigo, claiming victory, collapses as his Zanpakutō begins to destabilize. Noting it will explode, Uryū begins to dissipate the energy by absorbing it and releasing it by firing arrows into the sky, injuring himself. Uryū tells him to make sure he lives so he can beat him later.[132] The following day, when Rukia tells Ichigo not to pay attention to Uryū's injuries, Ichigo denies being worried. Later, when he overhears Keigo telling Mizuiro he saw Uryū talking to himself the previous day, believing it to be related to a theater, Ichigo is thankful Keigo is an idiot. Asking Uryū to join them for lunch, Ichigo later regrets it, due to the atmosphere which prevails over their meal.[133]\n\nThat night, Ichigo, taking the leftovers from dinner to give to Rukia, finds she is gone.[134] At 2:00 a.m., Ichigo, wondering whether she is going to return that night, notes it would be nice not to have Shinigami duties to carry out for once. Hearing a muffled noise, Ichigo finds Kon gagged and tied to the back of the toilet bowl. When Ichigo asks why he was tied up, Kon, saying Rukia is in big trouble, shows Ichigo a note she left on his desk. Confused by the message, which tells them she has to leave and they should go into hiding instead of looking for her, Ichigo decides to change into his Shinigami form and find her. Realizing he cannot change form without Rukia, Ichigo demands a reluctant Kon change him into a Shinigami. Appearing at the window, Urahara changes him into his Shinigami form.[135]\n\nAs Lieutenant Renji Abarai attacks Rukia, Ichigo, arriving, attacks him.[136] When Renji notes the size of Ichigo's Zanpakutō, Ichigo replies he thought it was large compared to Rukia's, but there had not been anyone else to compare it to. Realizing he is the Human who took Rukia's Shinigami powers, Renji, attacking him, asks Ichigo what the name of his Zanpakutō is. When Ichigo, stating he has not named his sword, asks if they actually give them names, Renji activates his Shikai, surprising Ichigo with the change of form of his Zanpakutō. Leaping into the air, he slashes Ichigo's shoulder.[137]\n\nAs Renji, explaining about the Shikai form of Zanpakutō, moves to attack him, Rukia attempts to stop him so Ichigo can flee, but Ichigo's Reiatsu increases, and he, injuring the surprised Renji, quickly overwhelms him. As Ichigo attempts to end the fight, Byakuya severs his sword's tip, leaving Ichigo stunned. As he prepares for Byakuya's subsequent attack, Byakuya, appearing behind him, stabs him.[138] Falling to the ground, Ichigo, wondering whether he was attacked from the front or from behind, is stabbed again by Byakuya.[139] As Byakuya and Rukia talk about Ichigo, he, grabbing Byakuya's leg, tells him not to talk about him as if he is dead. As Byakuya tells him to let go, Ichigo instructs the captain to look at him when he is talking so he can hear him. Kicking Ichigo's hand away from her brother, Rukia, telling him he should know his place, tells Byakuya she is ready to leave. As Ichigo protests, Renji tells him to stop making things worse. When Rukia tells Byakuya there is no point in deliberately killing Ichigo, as he will soon stop breathing on his own, Ichigo asks if this is a joke, prompting Rukia to state if he tries to follow her, she will never forgive him. As she tells him to conserve what energy he has left so he may live a moment longer, Byakuya, acquiescing to Rukia's request, states Ichigo should die shortly due to his injuries, but if he does survive, he will no longer possess any Shinigami powers. As they leave, Ichigo, noting he cannot move or speak, reflects upon how he came to protect Rukia, but instead she protected him again.[140] As Ichigo contemplates his injuries in the rain, Urahara approaches him.[141]\n\nWhen Ichigo awakens in Urahara's shop, Urahara tells him his wounds are not yet fully healed, and if he moves too much, he may die. When Ichigo asks him about Uryū's condition, Urahara states Uryū's injuries were treated on the spot, and when he left, he was worried about Ichigo, stating Ichigo was the only one who could beat the Shinigami and save Rukia. When Ichigo says he cannot do anything, as Rukia has been taken to Soul Society and he cannot follow, Urahara reveals he can send Ichigo there if he trains with Urahara for the next ten days, revealing Soul Society typically allows a grace period of one month before executions. Saying Ichigo will die if he goes there in his current condition, he reveals he purposely allowed Ichigo to fight Renji and Byakuya so he would realize this after having fought them himself. He states it will take seven days to open the gate to Soul Society, leaving Ichigo with thirteen days in Soul Society to rescue Rukia. Though unsure if he can become strong enough in ten days, Ichigo agrees to Urahara's deal.[142]\n\nGiving Ichigo some pills to take every hour, Urahara, saying he will recover from his injuries by dinnertime, sends him to school for the final day of the term. At school, Ichigo notes how nobody appears to remember Rukia. As Misato dismisses the class for summer, Ichigo, noting Uryū's absence, thinks he would remember Rukia. As he walks home after dismissing Keigo's invitation to spend the holiday with him, he meets Orihime, who, asking him where Rukia is, notes everyone has forgotten about her, but she believed Ichigo would know. Explaining the situation to her, Ichigo is surprised she can see his Shinigami form. Noting Ichigo has already made up his mind to rescue Rukia, Orihime, telling him to go save her, insists she does not want her friend to die either. Thanking her, Ichigo, going to the Urahara Shop, shows Urahara his healed wounds. Telling Urahara he told Isshin he would be sleeping over at a friend's house, he asks Urahara to teach him well.[143]\n\nIn Urahara's training area, Ichigo's soul form is freed from his body, and he finds it difficult to move. Urahara reveals Byakuya destroyed the source of his power, leaving him without any Shinigami powers, and he must restore these in order to fight the Shinigami. Explaining about Reiryoku, stating the more one's Reiryoku rises, the sharper the movements of their spiritual body become, he says if Ichigo can manage to move even better with his spiritual body than he can with his mortal body, they will have completely recovered his Reiryoku. Urahara has Ururu Tsumugiya attack Ichigo, and she lunges at him, creating a large cloud of dust and debris.[144] Emerging from the dust, Ichigo runs away from Ururu after another near miss. Realizing he is able to run away from her, Ichigo attempts to dodge her attacks directly. Successfully dodging, Ichigo attacks Ururu by trying to hit her headgear lightly, believing the weight difference will do the rest. When he hits and cuts her face, Ururu kicks him into a rocky outcropping. Catching Ichigo before he hits it, Tessai cushions him from the impact.[145]\n\nCongratulating him on clearing the lesson, Urahara asks if Ichigo is still having trouble breathing or moving, which he is not. As Urahara says he has successfully recovered his spirit energy, and the soul tends to gain the Reiryoku faster when it is in danger of being destroyed, Tessai, cutting Ichigo's Chain of Fate, pins him to the ground.[146] Telling him the chain has already begun to corrode from the severed end, Urahara states if it reaches his chest, Ichigo will become a Hollow, but he can avoid this by becoming a Shinigami instead. The point of this lesson, which Urahara calls \"Shattered Shaft,\" is to restore Ichigo's Shinigami powers. Dropped to the bottom of a shaft, he is bound with a Kin spell, and Urahara tells him to scale the vertical sides of the deep shaft.[147] Revealing there is a gas at the bottom of the shaft which speeds up the corrosion process to at most 72 hours, he tells Ichigo to become a Shinigami and climb out of the hole before that, or else he will become a Hollow, and they will destroy him.[148]\n\nAfter the corrosion of the chain's fifth link, Ichigo notes the process alternates between a few minutes of painful corrosion and a few hours of dormancy. Only able to attempt to escape during the dormant phases, Ichigo unsuccessfully tries to run up the wall. Asking him if he is hungry, Jinta Hanakari explains a soul feeling hungry is a sign they will soon become a Hollow. Later, as Ichigo wonders how long he has been in the hole for and how he can get out of it, Jinta runs down the shaft's wall with a platter of fruit for him. When Ichigo, denying he is hungry, says the chain is still long, Jinta reveals it has been seventy hours since he entered the shaft, and the final corrosion phase is stronger than the earlier ones. As the remaining length of the chain begins to corrode, a hole opens in Ichigo's chest, and a mask begins to form over his face.[149] Urahara explains the mask forming before his body reforms shows Ichigo is resisting the transformation.[150]\n\nAwakening inside his consciousness, Ichigo sees a man standing on a building. Surprised that Ichigo does not recognize him, the man says his name, but Ichigo cannot hear it. Stating it is sad, the man asks how many times he has to tell him his name before he is able to hear it, as he thought nobody in this world knew him better than Ichigo. When Ichigo falls from the building, the man, following him, states he should not worry, as Shinigami control death. As Ichigo tells him he is not currently a Shinigami, the man, telling him to focus the Reishi around him underneath his feet to stand on, urges Ichigo to remember a time when he stopped in mid-air as a Shinigami. He tells Ichigo Byakuya destroyed the powers given to him by Rukia, but Ichigo has his own Shinigami powers, which were hidden deep in his soul and awakened by Rukia's power. As the world crumbles around him, he instructs Ichigo to find it.[151]\n\nWith the buildings of his inner world dissolving into countless boxes, Ichigo, falling through a fissure into water, wonders how he can find his own powers. Remembering Uryū stating Shinigami have red Reiraku, he uses this to find a box containing a Zanpakutō's hilt. Telling him this time he ought to hear his name, the man urges him to take the hilt.[152] As Ichigo struggles to pull out the Zanpakutō, back in the shaft, the Kidō restraining Ichigo breaks apart. When Tessai activates the next stage of the Kidō, Bankin, an explosion erupts from the shaft. As the smoke clears, Ichigo, wearing a Hollow mask and Shinigami clothes, uses his still broken Zanpakutō to smash the Hollow mask. Congratulating him on his success, Urahara says he is now a complete Shinigami. Having sworn to kill Urahara when he got out of the shaft, Ichigo hits him in the eye with the sword's hilt. Urahara starts the third lesson, which is simply to knock the hat off of Urahara's head. As Ichigo proposes a five minute time limit, Urahara draws a blade from within his cane.[153]\n\nOverwhelming Ichigo, Urahara, revealing his sword is a Zanpakutō, activates Benihime's Shikai.[154] As Ichigo remembers Renji using his Shikai during their fight, Urahara, telling him every Zanpakutō has a name, cuts through the remains of Ichigo's blade until just the hilt remains, saying if he continues to fight with just the hilt, he will kill him. As Ichigo, thinking he is going to die, runs away, Urahara continues to attack him. Ichigo sees the man from his inner world again, who, asking why Ichigo ran when he has not yet called him, reveals his name is Zangetsu.[155] Stopping in his tracks, Ichigo, turning towards Urahara, calls out Zangetsu, activating his Shikai. Looking at the new form of his Zanpakutō, Ichigo, telling Urahara he might not be able to hold back, swings Zangetsu at him, who uses Chikasumi no Tate. As the dust settles, a hat-less Urahara, stating he would have lost an arm if it were not for Chikasumi no Tate, says he did not expect so much from one swing.[156]\n\nAfter completing Urahara's training, Ichigo has a relatively normal summer holiday while waiting for the gate to Soul Society to be opened. On the first of August, Ichigo and his friends gather for a fireworks festival, where they catch up. Isshin and the twins, running up to Ichigo, knock him down a bank. When Ichigo asks if they are drunk, Isshin reveals a juice seller used wine to dilute their juice instead of water. Telling the group they saved a seat on the opposite bank of the river that morning, Isshin heads off with the girls and several of Ichigo's friends.[157] Later that night, after complaining to a drunken Isshin about having to carry his sisters, Ichigo tells him he will be leaving soon, and he might not be back until the summer vacation ends.[158]\n\nSeven days after completing his training, Ichigo is summoned to the Urahara Shop. As he leaves, Ichigo says goodbye to his sisters. Isshin lends him an amulet, which he claims Masaki gave to him, stating it will bring him good fortune. On his way to Urahara's, Ichigo meets up with Orihime. Revealing he did not know she was going until Urahara mentioned it, Ichigo asks her if she is sure about it. When they arrive at the shop, they find Sado waiting for them, and Ichigo, asking where Uryū is, says he had heard he was coming too. When Uryū, arriving in a Quincy outfit, promises to show Ichigo how powerful he has become, Ichigo criticizes him for walking the entire way there wearing that outfit. Interrupting them, Urahara invites the group inside.[159]\n\nIn the underground training area, Urahara, revealing the Senkaimon they will be using to enter Soul Society, removes Ichigo's Shinigami form from his body. As the others examine his body, Ichigo complains about them touching it freely. Explaining how the Senkaimon works, Urahara says it will only stay open for four minutes. If they do not reach Soul Society in that time, they will become trapped in the Dangai. When Yoruichi tells them only those who are truly ready for the task can go, Ichigo says everyone gathered there has already made their decision and will go to Soul Society. When Yoruichi tells him they will never return if they lose, Ichigo states they simply have to win. When the Senkaimon opens, Ichigo tells Kon to take care of his family. Entering the gate, Ichigo, Uryū, Orihime, Sado, and Yoruichi appear in the Dangai.[160] As they run, Uryū's cape is caught by the Kōryū. Ichigo is warned not to use his Zanpakutō, as the Kōryū will trap it and he will not escape. After Sado frees Uryū, the group are chased by the Kōtotsu, and Orihime uses her shield to protect them from it, propelling them through the exit and into Soul Society.[161]\n\nSeventeen months after defeating Aizen, Ichigo, starting his third year in high school, notes ever since his powers disappeared, Karin's have been getting stronger. Since she has not asked him about it, Ichigo figures she is dealing with it well. At school, Ichigo, finding his Substitute Shinigami Badge in his bag, notes it has lost its abilities. Noticing Uryū running out of the classroom, aware he took over the Hollow extermination he used to cover, he notes to himself it is probably better for Uryū to handle it than Zennosuke Kurumadani.[300] At lunch, Keigo and Ichigo discuss future careers. When Keigo mentions Ichigo's grades were good when he began high school, but started slipping during the second half of his first year, Ichigo states he still did well despite the interference of his Shinigami duties. When Keigo asks about Rukia, Ichigo, asking why he brought her up, states she is not assigned to Karakura Town any more. Ichigo insists he is fine with his now peaceful life.[301]\n\nAs he walks home, Ichigo, stopping an armed thief, reflects on how he still has the body and reflexes of someone trained to fight and win. Returning the stolen property to its owner, Kūgo Ginjō, Ichigo asks for him to keep his actions a secret.[302] The next day, Ichigo has a dream in which he sees silhouettes of Renji, Byakuya and Rukia telling him to wake up. When he awakens to the sound of Isshin, who pounces on him, Ichigo dodges, sending Isshin through an open window. Dismissing Isshin's complaints, Ichigo says he would go to Soul Society if he died. Annoyed, Ichigo, blaming the weird dreams he has had recently on his father, demands he apologize to him.[303]\n\nAt school, Ichigo rents his services to Satoda, a member of the soccer club. As Ichigo prepares for practice, he bickers with Tatsuki, who reminds him to call his boss, Ikumi Unagiya, or he will be scolded by her again. Rushing out to call Ikumi, Ichigo has a short exchange with her about being fired. As he hangs up his phone, a gang arrives at the school looking for him. Ichigo sees the thief he had previously beaten up with them. When the gang leader demands Ichigo come forth, Uryū confronts the group, prompting Ichigo to rush to him to prevent the incident from worsening.[304] The two bicker at one another as they beat up the gang members. Before they finish, another gangster, Yokochini, appearing, asks Ichigo if he still remembers him. When he fails to remember him, Ichigo states he neither wants to nor cares about his past. Yokochini and his men are beaten by Ikumi, who, taking Ichigo away in a van, takes him to her office.[305]\n\nInside the Unagiya shop, Ikumi, showing Ichigo a pile of work documents, says he seldom does them, yelling at him to get to work. When Kūgo enters the store, Ichigo recognizes him as the man whose bag he recovered.[306] When Ichigo asks what he wants from him, Kūgo, showing him a picture of Isshin, asks for background information on him. Ichigo says Isshin is his father, and he can tell him anything he wants to know. Questioning whether Ichigo even knows enough to answer, Kūgo says he should not even know about his family yet.[307] When Ichigo tries to ask him what he means, Ikumi, interrupting, says she is closing shop for the day and will consider the job. As he leaves, Kūgo tells Ichigo to go to the Urahara Shop.[308]\n\nThere, Ichigo, witnessing Karin leaving, wonders why she was there. Kūgo approaches, calling Urahara a shady character. As Ichigo tries to defend Urahara, Kūgo, questioning how much he knows about Urahara, warns him to act quickly to defend his family.[309] Telling Kūgo he does not trust him, Ichigo is given a business card. Ichigo goes home, where Yuzu greets him with the results of her first exam, which she excelled at. Congratulating her, Ichigo, telling her to show it to Isshin, asks where he is. When she tells him he is not there, Ichigo, going up to his room, states he could find Isshin if he still had his Shinigami powers. Visiting with some leftover bread from her job, Orihime asks him if something happened recently or if he is being followed, which Ichigo denies.[310]\n\nAt dinnertime, Ichigo, rushing to Karakura Hospital, looking for the injured Uryū, finds Orihime is already there. When he asks where Sado is, Orihime tells him he did not answer when he was called. After Ryūken Ishida reveals the cause of Uryū's wounds, Ichigo asks what happened. After Uryū states it had nothing to do with him, Ichigo offers to walk Orihime home, but Ryūken, deciding to drive her home instead, tells Ichigo he should get home as well. After thanking him, Ichigo runs off, frustrated there is something going on which he can do nothing about. When he dials the number on the card Kūgo gave him, a voice welcomes him to \"Xcution.\"[311] Ichigo is given a complex dialing sequence to follow, which puts him through to Kūgo. After Ichigo complains about the complicated nature of the phone call, Kūgo arranges a meeting on the following evening at an address in Naruki City. The following day, when Orihime asks Ichigo if he knew what happened to Sado, who is absent from school, Ichigo, stating he does not know, declines an offer to go to Sado's house with her.[312]\n\nThat evening, when Ichigo arrives at the meeting place, he is greeted by Kūgo. Ichigo tells him his friend was attacked, and he wants his help. When Kūgo asks if Ichigo trusts him, Ichigo says he is probably not a normal Human. Giving a vague answer, Kūgo notes Ichigo has nobody else to count on. Inside the building, Kūgo, jinges about his request to investigate Isshin, insists it was a ruse to gain Ichigo's interest. As they enter Xcution's hideout, where Ichigo sees some of the other members of the group, Kūgo reveals they aim to restore his Shinigami powers.[313] When Ichigo demands to know how and why they intend to do this, Kūgo, insisting on taking their time, reveals the members of Xcution are Fullbringers, demonstrating their abilities. When a complaining Riruka Dokugamine enters the room, Ichigo asks Kūgo who she is. When he, introducing her, tells her to come in, she is followed inside by Yasutora Sado, surprising Ichigo.[314]\n\nWhen Ichigo angrily asks Sado why he is there and why he has not been going to school, Kūgo tells him to calm down so he can explain everything. As Ichigo glares at him, Kūgo reveals a Fullbringer is a person who had a parent who was attacked by a Hollow before their birth. Traces of the Hollow's powers remain in their mother's bodies and are passed on to them at birth. These powers are more like Hollow than Shinigami powers. He further explains Fullbringers do not enjoy their powers, similar to the way Ichigo hated his Hollow powers. Kūgo says he wants to erase his powers, and they have learned they can pass their powers on to someone who possesses both Human and Shinigami powers. Ichigo realizes he was not the first person born from a Shinigami and a Human.[315]\n\nKūgo says they have old allies who have reverted to being Human, and they will help Ichigo get his Shinigami powers back so he can help them become normal Humans. He explains Sado offered to help them because it meant Ichigo getting his powers back. Asking Sado to confirm this, Ichigo listens as he explains he sees the pain Ichigo feels at not being able to protect the people he cares about. He tells Ichigo he does not have to hide it, and his feeling this pain means this is who he is. When Kūgo says they will restore his Shinigami powers and add their own powers on top of that, Ichigo accepts this deal.[316]\n\nAfter arriving home late for the last two nights, Ichigo returns to the Kurosaki Clinic late once again, to the delight of Karin and Yuzu, whom he urges to go to bed, as it is late. Later, Ichigo is called back to Xcution's hideout, where Riruka uses her Fullbring to miniaturize and place him inside a doll house. Ichigo is confronted by Mr. Pork, a stuffed animal, which he is instructed to defeat by using Fullbring.[317] Mr. Pork, which has a yakuza man trapped inside it, attacks, forcing Ichigo to take evasive action. Shrugging off Riruka's complaints, Ichigo, saying he does not even understand the situation yet, asks how this will help him regain his Shinigami powers, and how he can suddenly use a power he has never used before. The yakuza says if he does not kill Ichigo within fifteen minutes, he will be trapped there permanently. After giving a brief explanation of Fullbring, Riruka leaves Ichigo, who, reflecting on what she said, thinks about how Kūgo transformed his pendant into a sword, concluding he should focus on something he regularly has with him. Arriving, Sado tells Ichigo to use his Substitute Shinigami Badge. Telling him he had just thought of it too, Ichigo holds his badge as the fifteen minutes expire and Mr. Pork, entering \"Mad Beast Mode,\" grows in size.[318]\n\nSado tells Ichigo it was pride which allowed him to use his Fullbring. When Ichigo thinks of times he was proud to be a Shinigami, his badge begins to take the form of Tensa Zangetsu's tsuba.[319] When Kūgo explains the badge recorded every battle Ichigo ever fought, a shocked Ichigo, testing out a variety of ways to use this new power, successfully launches a large amount of energy shaped like a manji at Mr. Pork, which defeats him. Ichigo wonders if the power will help him get his Shinigami powers back.[320] At Ichigo's behest, Riruka restores him to his normal size. Briefly hearing a voice coming from the badge which he recognizes as Rukia's, Ichigo wonders what is happening.[321]\n\nListening as the yakuza tries to extort money from Riruka, Ichigo notes he looks exactly like the doll he was inside. When Ichigo asks if he is to stay for further training, he is told Fullbring puts more strain on the body than can be felt. Kūgo advises him not to push himself, as his body will fall to pieces if he wears himself out. Saying a few more days without his powers should be bearable after all this time, he promises to call him when he has recuperated. As Sado and Ichigo walk to Sado's home, the latter tells Ichigo Orihime has been bringing him leftover bread everyday lately. Ichigo tells him she is worried about him, and he should call her. As Sado goes to give half of it to Ichigo, he, noticing something wrong with her Reiatsu, states something has happened to her.[322]\n\nWhen Ichigo tries to call Orihime, Sado tells him not to, as it could distract her and lead her to her death. He says he cannot quite locate Orihime's exact location, but Ichigo can tell by the direction they are going she is at her apartment.[323] Arriving to find Orihime kneeling in front of her door, they ask her if she is alright. Grabbing her shoulder, seeming distracted, Orihime, noticing Sado and Ichigo, asks why they are there. Hearing their explanation, Orihime tells them nothing happened, and she was with a friend before going into her apartment. As they leave, Ichigo asks Sado about Orihime. Stating he was probably sensing things wrong, Sado tells Ichigo not to worry.[324]\n\nRealizing Sado and Orihime will not tell him anything, Ichigo, going to the Xcution hideout, explains the situation, telling them he believes Orihime was attacked by the same person who attacked Uryū. When Kūgo and Jackie Tristan both suspect it is Shūkurō Tsukishima, Ichigo asks who this is, and Kūgo reveals Tsukishima is a Fullbringer and the former leader of Xcution, who came up with the idea to give their powers to a Substitute Shinigami.[325] When they did so, he, killing the Shinigami and those who gave him their power, disappeared. Showing Ichigo a Substitute Shinigami Badge, he tells him he believes Tsukishima wants to keep Ichigo away from them, and is using his attacks on Uryū and Orihime to get his attention. He tells him to go home until they are ready for the next stage of training. While walking the streets, Ichigo, spotting Isshin meeting with Urahara in an alley, hides. When they leave, Ichigo, contemplating Kūgo's warning about Urahara, wonders if he should follow them, but decides not to. Later, Ichigo returns to Xcution's hideout, where Riruka places him inside a fish tank to fight Jackie.[326]\n\nAfter an exchange of words between the pair, Jackie activates her Fullbring, Dirty Boots, and they begin to fight.[327] Telling Ichigo he is too lax, and he cannot take his time getting into a battle, Jackie warns Ichigo because he is in a living body, he will die if he keeps taking her attacks with his body. Ichigo fires an energy blast at her, only for Jackie to easily shatter it. Revealing he knows his attack's weakness, Ichigo uses Fullbring to increase his speed and attacks her. After being asked who taught him to fight, Ichigo explains he first learned from Urahara, but he learned from his battles as time went on, saying even though he was only a Shinigami for a brief time, he probably has more experience in battle than Xcution.[328]\n\nAs Reiatsu from Ichigo's badge begins to engulf his right arm, Ichigo begins to tire. When Jackie says they will abort the training, as Ichigo's Fullbring is going berserk in a way she has never seen before, Ichigo is adamant in continuing. As Jackie calls for Kūgo to retrieve Riruka to end the training, Ichigo, pinning her to the ground, says his Fullbring is not going berserk and has always been like this. He believes this is his badge's way of telling him to hurry and get his Shinigami powers back soon. Believing it is too dangerous to continue, Jackie decides to stop him by force.[329]\n\nWhen Tsukishima arrives at the Xcution headquarters, he cuts through the fish tank, and Ichigo emerges, engulfed in Reiatsu shaped similarly to his Shinigami shihakushō.[330] Asking who he is, Ichigo clashes with him. When Sado attacks Tsukishima to protect Ichigo's new powers, Ichigo, learning he was being protected from the truth, realizes Tsukishima attacked both Uryū and Orihime. Managing to surprise Tsukishima in the subsequent clash, Ichigo is swiftly overwhelmed. Protecting him, Kūgo states he cannot let them fight yet.[331]\n\nWhen Ichigo refuses to cooperate, Kūgo, knocking him to the ground, tells him he is not fine if he can be dropped in his real body. As Ichigo tries to resume fighting, he is stopped by Sado, who tells him Tsukishima is too far ahead of him, and he cannot win in his current state. Disregarding this, Ichigo attacks Tsukishima, who, commenting on his rate of evolution, states he is becoming closer to the heights of his previous powers. Using his Fullbring, Yukio Hans Vorarlberna seals Ichigo, preventing him from interacting with Tsukishima.[332][333][334] Later, in Xcution's back-up hideout, Yukio frees Ichigo, who asks what happened with Tsukishima. When Kūgo states he has fled for now, Ichigo asks what Kūgo is worried about. Stating if Tsukishima wanted to harm Xcution, he could have kept going, but it seems his objective is Ichigo, Kūgo tells Yukio to help with Ichigo's training. When Ichigo asks if it will be a live battle, Kūgo, saying that is what seems to work best with him, states he will fight Ichigo himself.[335]\n\nYukio loads Ichigo and Kūgo into his console. Seeing this, Ichigo realizes this is what happened to him before on the rooftops, and Kūgo explains Yukio's Fullbring. Activating his own Fullbring, Kūgo, saying it would be great if they had rules like a video game, requests Yukio give them six HP each, prompting six crosses to appear above their heads. When Kūgo asks if Ichigo needs a tutorial, he, saying he understands, activates his Fullbring, and they charge at each other.[336] Arriving inside Yukio's game world to find a badly injured Ichigo lying on the ground, Orihime begins to heal him. When Ichigo guesses Sado called her, Sado, arriving, confirms this, saying he knows Ichigo did not want to get Orihime wrapped up in this, but they will need her.[337] When Kūgo, growing impatient, asks Ichigo if he is ready to fight, Ichigo says yes, ignoring Orihime's protest. After Orihime blocks Kūgo's attempted attack, they resume their fight.[338]\n\nFollowing Orihime's arrival, Ichigo's movements become sharper. As he attacks Kūgo up close to counter the range of his sword, Kūgo, fending him off, injures Ichigo's leg.[339] As they fight, Ichigo notes he cannot feel anything from Kūgo's sword, comparing it with his battle with Gin Ichimaru. He notes while Tsukishima did not look at him, he felt his killing intent. He wonders if he cannot feel anything because they are not using Zanpakutō, or if it is because he does not fully trust Kūgo. Slashing Ichigo's eyes, Kūgo notes when Ichigo lost his powers, he also lost his resolve.[340]\n\nBlind and confused, Ichigo, demanding to know what Kūgo is doing, states he does not trust him, as he is not helping him as he had promised he would. Kūgo states their deal was to get his Shinigami powers back, and if he did not trust him, he should not have agreed to his training. When Yukio prevents Orihime from interfering, an enraged Ichigo, attacking, tries to dodge Kūgo's attacks by sensing the presence and sound of his opponent, but Kūgo, further injuring him, leaves Ichigo lying on the ground, impaled with his sword. Walking away, Kūgo, telling Ichigo he is going to kill Sado and Orihime, further taunts him. Struggling for a moment, Ichigo, reflecting on his inability to see, move, or speak, sees a white shape in the darkness, realizing he is beginning to see Kūgo's Reiatsu. As Ichigo begins to manifest a new form, power explodes from him. Putting his life on the line to control the explosion, Kūgo expresses his pride in Ichigo's accomplishment, stating his villain act is not the best, and welcomes Ichigo to Xcution.[341]\n\nAfter completing his Fullbring, Ichigo is put through a new training regiment to increase his stamina to meet the demands of using Fullbring. When Kūgo asks if Ichigo saw something when he completed his Fullbring, Ichigo is shocked he knows this. Kūgo says Ichigo saw him bathed in Reiatsu, which is why he cut Ichigo's eyes, as that is proof Ichigo is beginning to regain his Shinigami powers. Kūgo explains when Ichigo lost his Reiatsu, a tiny portion accumulated in a single location inside of him over time, which is why they used the Reiatsu flowing from his badge to jolt that awake. He says all that is left to do is to beef up his new body and powers, and his Fullbring and Shinigami powers will fuse, giving Ichigo a power transcending that of a Shinigami. Taking his badge, Ichigo, trying out his new Fullbring, leaves Yukio's Fullbring, thanking him. Yukio states only 90 minutes have passed, thanks to his Fullbring's abilities. Going home, Ichigo is met at the door by Yuzu, who says they have a surprise guest. He finds Tsukishima, whom Yuzu calls cousin Shū, sitting on the couch. Tsukishima greets Ichigo.[342]\n\nWatching in disbelief, Ichigo, grabbing Tsukishima, demands an explanation for why he is there. As Karin and Yuzu try to pry him off Tsukishima, the doorbell rings. Asking Yuzu to get it, Tsukishima says it must be Keigo and the others. As Tatsuki begins to lecture Ichigo on staying out so late, Tsukishima, telling Ichigo he called everyone, starts to call Sado and Orihime as well. As he is on the phone, Ichigo attacks him, prompting Tatsuki to berate Ichigo for attacking his relative. As Ichigo states she is wrong, everyone asks why he is acting the way he is. Fleeing his house, Ichigo, wondering whether what is going on is Tsukishima's ability, runs into Ikumi, who takes him to her store to let him calm down and talk about it. As Ichigo decides against telling her about Shinigami and Hollows, as it would make her uncomfortable, Tsukishima arrives at the store, and Ichigo, fleeing once again, says he needs someone in their right mind. Finding him, Kūgo says everyone in Xcution has fallen for Tsukishima's trap.[343]\n\nKūgo takes Ichigo to a location, which he says no members of Xcution know about, to discuss what has transpired. When Ichigo wonders why everyone is acting the way they are, Kūgo tells Ichigo that, thanks to information Sado provided about Tsukishima's attack on Orihime and with what has transpired, his ability may be inserting himself into people's pasts. When Ichigo asks if it would stop if Tsukishima were to die, Kūgo, telling Ichigo he does not know, asks if Ichigo could kill him despite this. Finding them, Yukio takes them to Tsukishima's mansion.[344]\n\nAs Ichigo, angrily rushing towards Tsukishima when he spots him, reaches for his badge, Kūgo, stopping him, warns Ichigo if he is correct about Tsukishima's ability, they will be in trouble if he is cut even once. Inviting them inside, Tsukishima says he only wants to talk. As a reluctant Ichigo enters the mansion, his family and friends, greeting him, tell a shocked Ichigo he should be happy Tsukishima is not angry, urging him to apologize. Kūgo tells him not to worry, because even though they view Tsukishima as a friend, they still view Ichigo as their friend. It is too much for Ichigo to handle, and he flees the room. He wants to kill Tsukishima, but he cannot fight him where his friends and family can be dragged into it. Going upstairs, he comes across the other members of Xcution. As Tsukishima appears behind Ichigo, Kūgo appears, having destroyed the stairs so Ichigo's family and friends cannot follow, and tells Ichigo he can now fight without holding back. Ichigo activates his Fullbring, and while Tsukishima is activating his, Ichigo cuts off his left arm. As Tsukishima expresses his surprise at Ichigo mastering his Fullbring in such a short time, Ichigo tells him he arrived to kill him. As Sado bursts through the window, he and Orihime shield Tsukishima.[345]\n\nAs Orihime heals Tsukishima's arm, Ichigo is left unable to believe Sado and Orihime have become the same as the others. As Both Orihime and Sado say Ichigo was able to save Rukia and defeat Aizen because Tsukishima helped him do so, Tsukishima, appearing behind Ichigo, asks him if he understands, but Ichigo tries to attack him.[346] As Tsukishima reveals the ability of his Fullbring, Book of the End, is to modify the past of those affected by it, Ichigo tries to attack him, but Orihime stops him with her Santen Kesshun. As Sado, trying to attack Ichigo, says he did not become strong to fight with Ichigo, he attacks again, and Ichigo is pushed outside from the force of the attack. As he, wondering why things turned out this way, says he only wanted to protect his friends, he asks what he got his powers back for. When Tsukishima appears above Ichigo, he charges at him.[347]\n\nAs they fight, Tsukishima gets behind Ichigo to attack him, but Kūgo takes the attack instead.[348] When Ichigo rushes to see if Kūgo is alright, Kūgo insists he is a comrade. When Uryū arrives, Ichigo questions his allegiance. Not wanting to fall for a trap, Ichigo is hesitant to listen to Uryū. As Uryū tells Ichigo it was Kūgo who attacked him, Kūgo attacks Ichigo, who asks if Kūgo was turned by Tsukishima's powers. Revealing their allegiance was a ruse, and Tsukishima had just returned him back to normal by cutting him a second time, Kūgo, merging the Substitute Shinigami Badge he had with his sword, tells Ichigo it is time to relieve him of his Fullbring, stabbing Ichigo through his chest.[349]\n\nKūgo reveals he was the one who actually attacked Uryū, and ordered Tsukishima to cut him, making them \"enemies\" who betrayed each other. Kūgo further states Tsukishima's ability prevented Ichigo from suspecting him. As Kūgo withdraws his blade from Ichigo's chest and Ichigo's Fullbring disappears, Ichigo thinks about how hard it was for him to go seventeen months without any power, and when he thought he found a way, he was so happy he could protect his friends again. When a distraught Ichigo asks Kūgo to give his power back, Kūgo states it was the power he gave to Ichigo, and it belongs to him. Kūgo says he will spare his life, and he should thank him.[350]\n\nAfter Tsukishima and Kūgo leave, Ichigo is stabbed in the back by Rukia with a special sword containing the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami. Ichigo emerges from the resulting explosion with a new Shinigami outfit and a slightly altered Zangetsu, ready to fight. Greeting Ichigo, Rukia, momentarily berating him, reveals Urahara told her about Tsukishima's ability. Reassuring him about this, she explains about the sword Urahara made to restore Shinigami powers to Ichigo. Returning, Kūgo, disputing this, is cut off by the arrival of more Shinigami. Rukia tells Kūgo he only stole a small portion of Ichigo's power, which had Ichigo's Fullbring, and Ichigo's Shinigami powers well up from deep inside; he could never take that from him. Ichigo fires a Getsuga Tenshō at Kūgo.[351][352]\n\nAs Ichigo's Getsuga Tenshō misses Kūgo and Kūgo tries to retreat, Ichigo, stopping him, attacks Kūgo with another Getsuga Tenshō before asking if it was a crime to transfer Shinigami powers to a Human. As Renji reveals Captain-Commander Yamamoto ordered all captains and lieutenants to put their Reiatsu into Urahara's sword to help bring back Ichigo's Shinigami powers, Hitsugaya tells him he did this because Ichigo was able to change Soul Society through his actions, and he should accept it proudly. As Ichigo notices Kūgo emerging from the dust below, Hitsugaya tells Ichigo Yamamoto also gave the order to stop the original Substitute Shinigami, Kūgo Ginjō.[353] When Ichigo is confused about this, Hitsugaya, reminding him of when Ukitake gave him his badge, tells Ichigo the Substitute Shinigami law was created solely because of Kūgo before stating they need to focus on Kūgo right now. Thanking Ichigo, Kūgo says if he had not taken his powers, he would have been dead by now.[354]\n\nAfter Kūgo grants the other members of Xcution part of Ichigo's Fullbring, Ichigo attacks them all. Using his Fullbring, Yukio, deceiving Ichigo, protects the Fullbringers from harm. Reminding Ichigo they received his Fullbring powers, which allows for them to wear their powers as a mantle, he says with Ichigo's help, his Invaders Must Die is now able to influence the world outside his console.[355] After Yukio uses his Fullbring to split everyone up into individual rooms, Ichigo and Uryū find themselves facing Kūgo in a replica of Karakura Town, an environment which Kūgo says he picked so Ichigo could fight easier. When Ichigo asks if Uryū is hurt, the Quincy, saying Rukia healed him, apologizes to Ichigo, saying when he first saw the Substitute Badge, he had thought there were other Substitutes before him. He thought if the previous one was alive, they would have told Ichigo, and if he was dead, they would have said why, leading Uryū to believe Soul Society did not know. Kicking Uryū, Ichigo tells him it does not matter, as they could not have done anything anyhow, and he would have forgotten in a few days. The two momentarily bicker before returning their attention to Kūgo.[356]\n\nWhile Ichigo and Uryū fight Kūgo, they begin hiding from him. When Ichigo asks Uryū if he has a plan, Uryū tells him he was not trying to come up with one, but rather he was observing Kūgo's Reiatsu. Abruptly leaving to confront Kūgo, Ichigo attacks him with a Getsuga Tenshō, but Kūgo, cutting through it with his sword, attacks him with a Getsuga Tenshō as well, surprising Ichigo. Uryū explains Kūgo, in addition to taking his Fullbring and Reiatsu, must have taken Ichigo's full abilities as well.[357] As Kūgo and Ichigo continue to fight, Kūgo asks him what he is fighting for, which confuses Ichigo. Kūgo confirms Tsukishima is dying, and if a Fullbringer dies, all traces of their ability disappear. He asks Ichigo what he is fighting for, but when Ichigo does not answer him, Kūgo informs him of an enemy he should be fighting.[358]\n\nWhen Ichigo dismisses this as an attempt to shake his resolve. Kūgo, stating the Substitute Shinigami Badge is given out whether the Substitute in question is beneficial to Soul Society or not, explains it has no authority, and its true purpose is to observe and restrict Ichigo's Shinigami powers while he has it with him. When Kūgo says this scheme was designed by Ukitake to control Substitute Shinigami, an enraged Ichigo releases his Bankai, which shatters the pocket dimension.[359] Dismissing Kūgo's words, Ichigo says he knew Ukitake was not trying to mislead him. After Kūgo activates his Bankai, the two clash.[360][361] Eventually, Kūgo's sword breaks, and he, badly injured, slumps to the ground, unable to continue. As Tsukishima tries to attack Ichigo, Riruka blocks the attack with her body instead.[362] Sometime after the fighting ends, he is at Urahara's shop, waiting for Riruka to wake up so he can make sure she is okay. He tells Riruka none of the other Fullbringers have been found.[363]\n\nIchigo goes to Soul Society to acquire Kūgo's body so he may bury it in the Human World. Upon arriving at the First Division, he finds the captains waiting for him. He is told to go inside the building by Kensei, whom he is surprised to see in a captain's uniform. After informing Yamamoto of his request, he dismisses Captain Hirako's words about forgiving Kūgo, stating his friends and family are back to normal, and calls Kūgo a \"mere Substitute Shinigami.\" Yamamoto notes he must have thought carefully about using that phrase. Afterwards, Ichigo is asked about his Badge, but he, stating he trusts them, keeps it.[364]\n\nWhen Ryūnosuke Yuki is attacked by Hollows, Ichigo saves him and, along with Orihime, Uryū, and Sado, defeats the Hollows.[365] Later, after Ichigo fights Asguiaro Ebern, who speaks of stealing Ichigo's Bankai,[366][367][368][369][370] After Yuki returns to Soul Society for Chōjirō's funeral. Later, Nel Tu and Pesche arrive in the Human World in order to request Ichigo's aid.[371] After Uryū declines to come with them, Ichigo, Orihime, Sado and Urahara travel to Hueco Mundo in order to investigate.[372] Upon arriving, they witness the slaughter and destruction left in the wake of the Wandenreich.[373] Coming across a Wandenreich camp, Ichigo and the others watch as the Tres Bestias intervene in the Wandenreich's selection of Arrancar soldiers. After the Tres Bestias are defeated,[374][375] Ichigo fights Quilge Opie as Orihime tends to the wounded. Later, after Quilge activates Quincy: Vollständig, the Tres Bestias regain consciousness and unleash Ayon against him.[376][377] When Quilge absorbs Ayon with Sklaverei and begins to absorb Orihime and the others, Ichigo activates his Bankai and attacks him.[378]\n\nAs the fight progresses, Quilge is overwhelmed by Ichigo and desperately attempts to steal his Bankai, only to discover he is unable to do so. Eventually, Urahara is contacted by Akon and informs Ichigo the Wandenreich is currently attacking Soul Society.[379] As Ichigo travels through a Garganta opened by Urahara, Akon informs him of the situation in Soul Society. When Quilge traps him in a Reishi prison, Ichigo loses contact with Akon and is unable to free himself.[380][381][382][383] Eventually, Akon frees Ichigo, who enters Soul Society and travels to a heavily wounded Byakuya's location. After Byakuya begs him to save Soul Society, Ichigo confronts Yhwach.[384] Upon learning Yhwach is the one who ordered the destruction of the Seireitei, an enraged Ichigo attacks him, only to be taken down with ease. Yhwach tries to stab Ichigo, but the later is saved by Blut Vene and Ichigo engulfs him in a blast of Reiatsu.[385]\n\nEmerging from this, Yhwach informs Ichigo that Quilge's cage was not meant to hold a Quincy. Hinting at a secret regarding Masaki, Yhwach attempts to subdue Ichigo once more, only to be stopped by \"shadows\". When Ichigo attempts to stop Yhwach from leaving, Jugram Haschwalth cuts the blade of Tensa Zangetsu in two.[386] Afterwards, Ichigo visits a wounded Rukia and Renji in the hospital before being summoned to the 12th Division.[387] After Mayuri reveals a broken Bankai can never be fixed, Ichigo witnesses the arrival of the Royal Guard,[388] who take him to the Soul King Palace in order to reforge his Bankai.[389][390] After being healed by Tenjirō Kirinji's hot springs[391][392] and having his power restored and increased by Kirio Hikifune's food,[393] Ichigo travels to Ōetsu Nimaiya's palace, where he and Renji are forced to fight the Asauchi in order to have their Zanpakutō reforged.[394] Three days later, Ichigo has failed to defeat the Asauchi and is sent back to the Human World by Nimaiya.[395] After Ikumi takes him in, Ichigo is found by Isshin, who tells him how he met Masaki, that she was a Quincy and reveals the circumstances surrounding her death.[396][397][398]\n\nAfterwards, Ichigo returns to Nimaiya's palace, where he chooses an Asauchi who resembles Ichigo's inner Hollow.[399] Traveling to Nimaiya's forge,[400] Ichigo watches as Nimaiya's bodyguards help him forge Ichigo's new Zanpakutō. When he questions Nimaiya about the nature of his forging, Ichigo learns the being who claimed to be Zangetsu is actually his Quincy powers and heavily resembles Yhwach from 1000 years ago.[401] Entering his inner world, Ichigo demands answers from the being he knows as Zangetsu, who reveals Hollow Ichigo is Ichigo's true Zanpakutō, whom he has been mostly suppressing. Afterwards, he allows Ichigo to access the full power of his true Zanpakutō.[402] In the real world, Ichigo grabs his new Zanpakutō while it is being forged, which Nimaiya allows. After a burst of heat, Ichigo stands with his new Zanpakutō, which is now comprised of two distinct blades, and acknowledges both his Quincy powers and the real Zangetsu as being his Zanpakutō.[403]\n\nAfterwards, Ichigo joins Ichibē Hyōsube at the latter's temple. There, Ichibē brings up the extensive damage that Soul Society has suffered, and calls this pathetic because a thousand years of peace have clearly made the Shinigami weak, though Ichigo points out that the Royal Guard merely watched as this happened. In response, Ichibē asserts that part of their duty is to watch in addition to training Ichigo, whom he informs that the Wandenreich are sure to come again in the near future. Affirming this, Ichigo bows, thanks Ichibē for his help, and begins to walk out of the temple. However, when Ichigo tells an inquisitive Ichibē that he is returning to Soul Society to help the Gotei 13 before the next attack, Ichibē merely questions if he is that eager to die and declares that Ichigo has no chance of winning against Yhwach right now, to Ichigo's shock. As Ichigo prepares for the training by taking off his Shihakushō and setting down the blades of Zangetsu, Ichibē reiterates that Ichigo cannot defeat Yhwach in his current state and declares that he must surpass the existence of a Shinigami, claiming that Ichigo will only ever be a Shinigami if he merely hones his Zanpakutō skills. Ichibē takes Ichigo to the Irazu Sandō, a dimension that Ichibē claims is a sacred place which not even the Royal Guard can enter without the permission of the Soul King and that he will test Ichigo to see if he is worthy of surpassing the existence of Shinigami.[404]\n\nAs Ichigo walks through the corridor of the Irazu Sandō he begins to struggle and wonders how it can be so heavy in here and forces himself to keep going.[405] Ichigo continues walking toward the gate at the end of the path despite the immense pressure building with every step. However, upon taking a step, Ichigo experiences rapid and inexplicable visions of a man in a pool of Reishi, which he is left bewildered by. Attempting to ignore this and continue progressing, Ichigo receives the same visions again at a slower rate, letting him see a man stabilizing Reishi in four separate pools with arrows, having his arms and legs cut off, and ultimately being sealed in a crystal to become the Soul King, leaving Ichigo speechless while the pupils of his eyes are surrounded by four additional, mirage-like pupils in the corners.[406]\n\nAs Ichigo wonders what is happening while, he experiences the same visions as before alongside glimpses of the original captains of the Gotei 13. Ichigo stops walking as he is surrounded by surging golden, green, blue, and red Reiatsu that begins suffusing his body. Suddenly, Ichigo envisions his body swelling up from the power entering him and screams in pain as four additional pupils appear in his eyes again, only for it to subside once he raises his wooden sword above his head. In the aftermath, an exhausted Ichigo slowly walks forward and passes through the gate at the end of the path, taking him to the interior of Senjumaru Shutara's palace.[407]\n\nIchigo later contacts Urahara[408] and he prepares to return to Seireitei. As Senjumaru manifests a flight of spiral stairs below the platform they are standing on, Ichibei reveals the Wandenreich has already begun attacking the Seireitei. With some more of Hikifune's infused food, heads off to join the battle.[409] Telling Urahara it will take some time for him to get there, Ichigo asks him to resist until he arrives even if the fight gets tough. As Urahara confirms this, Ichigo notes Urahara did not say anything about the Seireitei's current condition and rockets forward.[410]\n\nWhile Giselle Gewelle, Liltotto Lamperd, Candice Catnipp, and Meninas McAllon are trying to finish off the defeated Kenpachi Zaraki, Ichigo arrives in Seireitei and goes to Kenpachi's side, commenting on Zaraki's condition and that he came there to help him.[411] Candice attacks him, but Ichigo grabs her arm and throws her into a building before repeating the process with Liltotto, Meninas, and Giselle. As Liltotto notes she expected this kind of power from a Special War Potential, an enraged Candice summons her bow before using Galvano Blast, which fires a 5 gigajoule blast of electricity at Ichigo. However, Ichigo emerges unharmed and prepares to take the quartet on.[412]\n\nAfter effortlessly repelling the Heilig Pfeil of all four Sternritter, Ichigo is attacked by Candice, who has activated her Quincy: Vollständig. She pushes Ichigo back before throwing her Galvano Javelin at him. In response, Ichigo unleashes a Getsuga Tenshō, which cancels out the attack. Candice summons a massive amount of electricity and unleashes Electrocution upon him. However, Ichigo merely crosses the path of his sword swings and fires Getsuga Jūjishō at the oncoming blast.[413] When Candice attempts to counter his attack, Ichigo yells at her to get out of the way.[414] Surprised when Bazz-B attacks the four Sternritter, Ichigo prepares to fight both the quartet, Bazz-B and three other newly arrive Sternritter at once before being startled by a column of light piercing the heavens behind him.[415]\n\nAs Ichigo turns to face it, Yhwach begins speaking to him and notes that Ichigo broke through all the 72 barriers between Soul Society and the Soul King Palace on his way back down to Seireitei. He states that it will take 6,000 seconds for them to fully close again, causing Ichigo to realize what he is planning. When Ichigo leaps forward, the various Sternritter try to stop him. However, Renji intervenes and tells Ichigo to go to Yhwach, prompting Ichigo to leave as the Sternritter are intercepted by several other Shinigami.[416] As Ichigo rushes toward Yhwach, Uryū fires a Heilig Pfeil at him and tells him to go home. Ichigo expresses shock and wonders why Uryū is there. When Uryū states he cannot defeat Yhwach, before unleashing Licht Regen on him. However, Santen Kesshun blocks the barrage as Orihime and Sado emerge from a Garganta. As Uryū, Yhwach and Haschwalth vanish, Ichigo continues to call out to his friend.[417] Afterwards, upon seeing Ichigo's distraught expression, Sado throws him into a building and demands to know what he is doing. He points out how Uryū must have thought deeply about his decision, which calms Ichigo down and they discuss how they can take Uryū back. They are interrupted by Urahara, who offers to take Ichigo to the Soul King Palace.[418]\n\nUrahara takes Ichigo and his friends to the basement of the 12th Division, where a single use replica of Kūkaku's cannon has been built by Mayuri. After a moment of collecting their thoughts, Ichigo, Orihime, Sado, Ganju and Yoruichi are launched towards the Soul King Palace.[419] When Orihime reminisces about the time they entered Soul Society to rescue Rukia with Uryū alongside them, Ichigo assures her that they will defeat Yhwach and take Uryū back.[420] Upon arriving at the palace, Ichigo spots Ichibē's head lying on the ground in front of him. He hears Ichibē's voice telling him to call his name and does so, causing Ichibē to reappear unharmed. After explaining how this happened, Ichibē asks Ichigo to stop Yhwach from killing the Soul King as Ichigo and his friends rush toward the main palace.[421]\n\nIchigo and the others arrive at the main palace, where they confront Yhwach.[422] When Ichigo tells Yhwach that they have come to stop him, Yhwach reveals that he saw it already, prompting Ichigo to ask him what he means and why his eyes have changed. After Yhwach explains his ability to see the future and reveals he has already attacked the Soul King, Ichigo attempts to help the king, but is surprised when his right side is enveloped in Blut Vene veins upon touching Yhwach's sword. Yhwach explains how the Quincy blood within Ichigo's body will never tolerate the Soul King's existence and invites him to watch the destruction of Soul Society as Ichigo slashes the Soul King diagonally across the chest.[423]\n\nIchigo wonders why he cannot let go of the sword and why he was forced to attack the king, prompting Yhwach to explain how he transferred the Reiatsu still present in his sword to him, which Ichigo's blood reacted to. Upon hearing this, Ichigo manages to dispel the veins covering his arm and grabs Zangetsu before attacking Yhwach, who effortlessly blocks him while proclaiming that there is no point in fighting him anymore because Soul Society will collapse regardless of what happens to him.[424]\n\nWhen Mimihagi appears and stabilizes the Soul King, Ichigo looks at it in shock.[425] Yhwach attempts to destroy both of them, but Ichigo stops him, allowing Yoruichi to move in and begin the process of replacing the Soul King. Ichigo states he is here to protect Soul Society, Hueco Mundo, and the Human World, prompting Yhwach to demand to know if Ichigo thinks only he can do this. Proclaiming that he cannot simply sit by even if he is replaceable, Ichigo blasts Yhwach with a Getsuga Tenshō and tells Yhwach it does not matter if Yhwach's blood runs in his veins because he will not do Yhwach's bidding.[426]\n\nYhwach claims that he has never tried to make Ichigo do his bidding, prompting Ichigo to ask him what he means. Yhwach claims that all of Ichigo's fighting and growth up until now have been preparing him for killing the Soul King and that this has all benefited him because they share the same blood. Ichigo angrily attacks Yhwach and proclaims he still intends to stop him, only for Yhwach to ask him if his resentment toward him is truly justified. When Uryū arrives and shoots Yoruichi in the shoulder, causing her barrier to shatter, a shocked Ichigo demands to know what he just did before being blasted away by Yhwach. After throwing Yoruichi out of the palace, Yhwach places his hand on the Soul King, but Ichigo attempts to attack him, only to be distracted by another attack from Uryū. As Yhwach rips Mimihagi off of the Soul King, Uryū tells Ichigo not to interfere, prompting Ichigo to demand to know what he is doing.[427]\n\nWhen Uryū tells them to not move if they do not want to be shot, Ichigo attempts to move, prompting Uryū to shoot his sword. Ichigo asks Uryū if he does not know what will happen if Yhwach succeeds in killing the Soul King, but Uryū reveals he already knows, causing Ichigo to again question his motives. After claiming that being a Quincy is his reason, Uryū destroys the ground beneath Ichigo, causing Ichigo to fall off the palace as Lille Barro fires another Heilig Pfeil after him.[428] Ichigo manages to catch and destroy the Heilig Pfeil as Orihime catches him, herself, Sado, and Ganju with Santen Kesshun, which is grappled by Yoruichi, who reels them up to one of the floating cities. However, Kon suddenly bursts out of Ichigo's pocket in his muscular form, causing Ichigo to fall back and hit his head on Orihime, knocking him out.[429]\n\nLater, Yoruichi wakes Ichigo up. After remembering what happened, Ichigo finds and grabs Kon, whom he begins tormenting, before being interrupted by Yoruichi, who asks him and the others if it is time to take their revenge. Ichigo wonders how they are going to get back up to the palace, before having a Garganta open behind her to reveal Grimmjow, whose arrival shocks Ichigo.[430] Grimmjow greets Ichigo and before noting the scars he gave Ichigo have already healed. Drawing his sword, Grimmjow claims he has been waiting for all this time to get some payback as Ichigo picks up Zangetsu, but they are interrupted when Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck leaps over Grimmjow and tackles Ichigo. Nelliel explains to a shocked Ichigo that Urahara made her an armband that allows her to maintain her adult form. Riruka Dokugamine summons them in to a nearby black box created by Yukio Hans Vorarlberna. After everyone enters, Yukio locks the box as Ichigo demands that Yoruichi explain everything to him. Yoruichi reveals how they are going to use a Garganta to infiltrate the palace.[431]\n\nAfter Yoruichi explains how they are getting to the palace by using a device she put near the Soul King as a destination point, Ichigo confirms that he understands. Soon after, he asks Grimmjow why he is helping them, and is amused when Grimmjow claims he is only doing so because there will be no chance to fight him if Yhwach destroys everything.[432] As Ichigo and the others prepare themselves, they are interrupted by Yukio informing them that he will not be leaving the box to fight. When Ganju confronts him over this, Ichigo stops him and agrees with Yukio's decision before telling Riruka to stay behind as well in order to protect Yukio. Ganju notes that he has grown a lot, only for Ichigo to wonder what he means. Upon reaching the palace, Ichigo watches as the Garganta opens to reveal that the palace has been reshaped into the Wahrwelt by Yhwach.[433]\n\nIchigo and his allies begin moving toward it while discussing their inability to create Reishi footholds. While Ichigo expresses confusion at Yoruichi's comparison of him to her brother, Grimmjow decides to move ahead without the group, prompting Ichigo to attempt to stop him. Grimmjow finds and attacks Askin Nakk Le Vaar up ahead, prompting Ichigo to express irritation at him attacking without a second thought.[434] They lose track of Grimmjow, which annoys him greatly. Ichigo then tells his allies to split up and look for Grimmjow.[435]\n\nSoon afterwards, he encounters Askin and demands to know what happened to Grimmjow. After hearing that the former Espada has been dealt with, Ichigo prepares to attack Askin, but is interrupted when darkness suddenly surrounds them. Ichigo then begins to wonder nervously if the Reiatsu he is sensing really belongs to Shunsui Kyōraku.[436] Ichigo loses his battle with Askin and is found lying face down on the ground by Orihime and Sado. Ichigo warns them to stay back as Sado attacks Askin.[437] Yoruichi intercepts Askin, and Ichigo eventually manages to stand up. Yoruichi tells him to go along with the others until she catches up with them, and Ichigo complies, but tells her to watch herself. Ichigo, Sado, and Orihime then run away from the battlefield.[438]\n\nThey reach the palace and confront Uryū.[439] Ichigo wonders what is going on with Haschwalth's eyes as the Grandmaster walks up to him and Uryū. Ichigo watches in shock as Haschwalth orders Uryū to prove his loyalty by attacking him, and clashes with his friend. Ichigo asks Uryū what he is trying to do and why he joined the Quincy so he would at least know Uryū's motivation and bring him back to their side. After forcing them away from Haschwalth, Uryū tosses Ichigo his Sun Key, which could teleport them to the Human World, and tells him to take his friends and leave as he would stay behind and take down Wahrwelt himself using a plan he had already begun. Ichigo argues against this plan, saying that they just needed to take down Yhwach, but Uryū says it is impossible and it is up to him to destroy Wahrwelt as his own Reiatsu is essential to the plan. Uryū tells Ichigo to go, but they are confronted by Haschwalth, who knew Uryū's plan.[440]\n\nAs Haschwalth approaches them, he reveals that he destroyed the Sun Gate leading to the Human World. Uryū realizes that as long as Haschwalth possesses The Almighty, Yhwach is vulnerable and tells Ichigo to go to the highest point of Silbern to confront Yhwach while he deals with Haschwalth. Ichigo initially protests but duly heads off with Orihime and Sado. They climb up the stairs, they are suddenly ambushed by large Quincy statues. Ichigo pulls Orihime away from an attack, and Sado blocks another attack aimed at them. The clash causes part of the walkway to fall away, separating Ichigo and Orihime from Sado. Sado says that he will stay and take care of the statues. Ichigo understands his friend's resolve and continues heading upward with Orihime.[441]\n\nThey reach the entrance to the throne room and Ichigo tells Orihime that he is counting on her to act as his defense.[442] Ichigo approaches Yhwach, who can see his monstrous Reiatsu emanating from his body, and Yhwach wonders what Ichigo will do. Ichigo gets annoyed, knowing that Yhwach can see his next move, only for Yhwach to reveal that he does not have The Almighty activated as he wants to savor his reunion with his \"son\". Ichigo says that Yhwach is not his real father lambasts the Quincy for killing his mother.[443]\n\nAs Ichigo attempts to attack Yhwach, Orihime shields her friend from the Quincy's attacks. Yhwach states that Masaki's death was necessary in order for him to gain power.[444] Ichigo races at Yhwach again despite Orihime's protests, and Yhwach blocks him with dark energy, chiding him for his recklessness and saying that his death is inevitable. As Ichigo makes yet another charge, Yhwach surrounds him in dark energy and states that Ichigo's powers are not rightfully his and it is time they return to their progenitor.[445] With Ichigo continuing to rush into his torrent of dark energy, Yhwach wonders why Ichigo is not revealing his true power and notes that he will destroy both Soul Society and the Human World if not stopped. However, upon seeing the tip of his blade turning white, Ichigo has Orihime shield him and reveals to her that he needed to awaken something with Yhwach's Quincy Reiatsu, hence his repeated and seemingly reckless headlong charges. An explosion of energy engulfs Ichigo, and he enters a new form with Hollow characteristics.[446]\n\nIchigo confirms Yhwach's assessment that this is the form he takes on when melding with his Hollow powers before explaining how he reforged his Zanpakutō after his Hollow and Quincy powers came into balance with one another. Noting that they should logically come forth if that balance is disrupted, Ichigo states that his Hollow powers have always come forth when he exerted his Shinigami powers before revealing that he had to draw them out with the help of Yhwach's power. As Yhwach grins at this, Ichigo moves in front of Santen Kesshun while telling Orihime to keep up her guard before engaging in close range combat with Yhwach. Ichigo is pushed back by the Quincy and then forms a Getsuga Tenshō and fuses it with a Gran Rey Cero before firing it at Yhwach.[447]\n\nNoting that a combined attack like this is fitting for a racial hybrid like Ichigo, Yhwach repels the attack and clashes with the young Shinigami. He activates The Almighty, noting that Ichigo's opportunity is now over. When Ichigo is impaled by a number of traps, Yhwach states that Ichigo should know that The Almighty allows him to see the future, but Ichigo reasons that there must be some limit to his precognitive ability. As Ichigo lands on top of a pillar, he is stabbed by long shadowy blades from the wall behind him, causing him to grunt in pain as he falls to the ground below while wondering what is happening. Yhwach reveals that Ichigo made a miscalculation by believing that the future is linear and explains that it diverges in countless directions from a given point in time like grains of sand in the wind. As Yhwach tells him to keep fighting and not give in to despair, Ichigo decries the idea of falling into despair after he has broken through it so many times in order to reach this moment before activating his Bankai.[448]\n\nHowever, Yhwach immediately breaks off part of Tensa Zangetsu's blade and his horn, seemingly without moving. Yhwach continues to injure Ichigo despite Orihime shielding him, before eventually revealing that The Almighty lets him transform the future as well as foresee it.[449] Ichigo listens as Yhwach states that The Almighty is no different from his and Orihime's powers because he can also influence only what he can see, which is the entirety of fate. Yhwach claims that Ichigo has only been able to overcome his despair and change his fate up until now because he was not present and declares that he will cut down any future Ichigo tries to create for himself. He tells Ichigo that he can begin despairing now, prompting Ichigo to begin screaming in anger.[450]\n\nSoon afterward, Ichigo coughs up blood after being attacked by Yhwach, who grabs him by the head while noting that he expected more of a fight from Ichigo. Noting that neither his sword nor Orihime's powers have any effect, Ichigo loses all hope of winning, prompting Yhwach to drop him while claiming that all Ichigo accomplished was providing him with some entertainment before preparing to take back the power Ichigo had inherited from him.[451] Black veins encompass Ichigo and the surrounding area as he realizes his Quincy powers along with the Hollow powers mixed with it are fading away. As his merged Hollow form dissipates, Ichigo falls to the ground.[452]\n\nAs Yhwach leaves through a portal, Rukia and Renji show up, with Renji trying and failing to attack Yhwach from behind despite Ichigo's silent protests. Soon afterward, despite Orihime's inability to restore Tensa Zangetsu, Renji hoists Ichigo up and declares that they will be confronting Yhwach, prompting Rukia to point out that simply charging in will accomplish nothing. However, they are all interrupted when Ichigo is stabbed through the shoulder by Shūkurō Tsukishima, who reveals that he has altered the past so that Tensa Zangetsu can be fixed at Kūgo's behest. When Tsukishima asks him if they are even now, Ichigo confidently stands up with his restored Bankai and confirms this.[453]\n\nShortly after his Bankai is fixed, Ichigo and Renji begin running through the portal with Reishi footholds. Ichigo then questions if Renji tagging along was a good idea. After getting a sobering lesson from Renji, the two eventually reach Soul Society, and immediately attack Yhwach. However, Yhwach uses The Almighty to avoid the attack and breaks Tensa Zangetsu once more.[454] After being pushed back by an energy attack from Yhwach, Ichigo glares at him as Yhwach questions why he did not have Orihime heal him before he came here. Ichigo proceeds to watch as Aizen takes on Yhwach while disguising himself as both Renji and Ichigo. When Aizen successfully tricks Yhwach into believing he has killed him, Ichigo impales Yhwach from behind before unleashing a powerful Getsuga Tenshō.[455]\n\nAs Ichigo cuts him in half, Yhwach dissolves into a mass of darkness, prompting Aizen to commend Ichigo for responding to his usage of Kyōka Suigetsu as quickly as he did. When Ichigo notes that he experienced a strange feeling similar to when Aizen used Kyōka Suigetsu on his allies, prompting Aizen to explain how he released it before Ichigo arrived and confirmed that it would work on Yhwach before revealing that Ichigo was the final component in his plan because he was unaffected by it. Suddenly, Yhwach's darkness engulfs Aizen as Yhwach himself notes that the power of Kyōka Suigetsu appears to have run out before reforming as he asks Ichigo if he really thought an attack of that caliber would be enough to kill him. Proclaiming that he can even rewrite futures where he dies using The Almighty, Yhwach bashes Tensa Zangetsu out of Ichigo's hand and engulfs him and the rest of the Seireitei in his darkness before declaring that everything will lose its form and become one before his power. However, Yhwach is interrupted when Uryū fires the silver arrowhead through his chest, to the surprise of both him and Ichigo. Yhwach's darkness suddenly clears from his body as he briefly loses his powers, prompting Uryū to tell Ichigo to move now. With his cracked Bankai in hand, Ichigo leaps toward Yhwach, who is beginning to regain his powers and seemingly shatters the blade in his hand. However, the blade instead crumbles to reveal the original Zangetsu in Ichigo's hands, prompting a stunned Yhwach to realize that this is what Haschwalth was trying to warn him about with his dream as Ichigo cuts him in two.[456] Yhwach grabs hold of Zangetsu and laments to Ichigo how the path is being closed to a world without fear and how thanks to Ichigo existence will continue as it always has in a cycle of life and death.[457]\n\nLess than ten years later, Ichigo marries Orihime and they have a son named Kazui Kurosaki. Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Ichigo has a get-together with his Karakura friends at the Kurosaki Clinic to see Sado's upcoming boxing match on TV. Rukia and Renji come to the Kurosaki Clinic and Ichigo greets them at the door, inviting them inside. As Sado's match begins, Ichigo calls Orihime to the living room and asks her where Kazui is. She replies that he is probably upstairs, and Ichigo wonders if Yuzu is fine with him being in her room, which she affirms. Ichigo then asks Rukia and Renji about their child coming, and after realizing she has disappeared, Rukia flippantly guesses that she is getting into fights. Ichigo is shocked by Rukia's attitude and the two begin arguing.[458]"
