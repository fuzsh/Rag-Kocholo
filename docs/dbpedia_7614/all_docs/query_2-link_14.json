        "text": "Directed by Ernst Lubitsch\n\nLubitsch’s first talkie was this innovative musical starring Maurice Chevalier in his first American success and Jeanette MacDonald in her film debut. A whimsical love story between a queen and an amorous diplomat, The Love Parade was not merely a commercial hit but a sound film milestone for the pioneering way Lubitsch incorporated songs naturally within scenes. The result is a brilliantly flowing, musical satire.\n\nParamount Famous Lasky Corp. Screenwriter: Guy Bolton. Based on a novel by Leon Xanrof and Jules Chancel. Cinematographer: Victor Milner. Editor: Merrill White. Cast: Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, Lupino Lane, Lillian Roth, Edgar Norton.\n\n35mm, b/w, 107 min.\n\nDirected by Ernst Lubitsch\n\nIn Lubitsch’s third sound feature, Maurice Chevalier plays a cheerful but bemused hero Austrian officer who has the mixed good fortune to win the affections of two equally beautiful women: a warm-hearted violinist (Colbert) and a haughty princess (Hopkins). As in Lubitsch’s other musicals, the camera might also be one of the performers, swooping and darting through the farcical plot.\n\nParamount Publix Corp. Screenwriter: Ernest Vadja, Samson Raphaelson. Based on an operetta by Felix Dörmann and Leopold Jacobson. Cinematographer: George Folsey. Editor: Merrill White. Cast: Maurice Chevalier, Claudette Colbert, Miriam Hopkins, Charlie Ruggles, George Barbier.\n\n35mm, b/w, 102 min."
