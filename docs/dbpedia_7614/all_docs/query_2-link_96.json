        "text": "The Seminole District held its first-ever Media Day on Thursday, as coaches and player representatives from across the eight-team league gathered to discuss their programs ahead of August 30, when the Virginia High School League officially kicks off the 2024 season.\n\nThe gathering was a chance for members of the media to get an early glimpse at some of the plans and personnel each team will showcase this season. Below is a breakdown of each team based off Thursday's press conferences.\n\nLiberty Christian\n\nThe reigning Class 3 state champs bring back five starters on each side of the ball, including four-star running back Gideon Davidson, back for his senior season.\n\nTo fill holes left by players who graduated in the spring, LCA will rely on numerous players up from the JV squad.\n\nOf note for the Bulldogs: quarterback Jeb Moon has moved to Atlanta in order to pursue a career in track and field. His position likely will be filled either by James Deyo, who played some quarterback last year but predominantly filled in at wide receiver and linebacker, or a QB up from JV.\n\n\"It's gonna be a challenge, just like we all are gonna have,\" LCA coach Frank Rocco said. \"It's a very tough district, as we know. We're just looking forward to may the best man win.\"\n\nExpect LCA to be a blend of very experienced players and newbies trying to fit into the varsity scheme. Also of note is another Clemson commit, 6-foot-5, 280-pound Easton Ware, an offensive tackle who provided dynamic play down the stretch in 2023.\n\nAnd Davidson has bulked up, Rocco said, from 190 pounds to 210.\n\n\"For a high school kid that has to come up and tackle him play after play after play, usually the running back is taking a little bit of the brunt. But he'll be dishing it out,\" Rocco said.\n\nLCA opens the season with a must-see game at home against Salem. It's a rematch of opening night 2023, when LCA went to Salem and came away with the win.\n\n\"I'm glad that's our first test,\" receiver and cornerback Justis Belford said, \"because it's a good team to compete against as our first real game, so I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nHeritage\n\nHeritage is out to improve on a 6-5 season. The Pioneers displayed a lot of youth last year, with a bevy of sophomores and a few freshmen starting by the season's end.\n\nBradley, beginning his 13th year at HHS, was flanked Thursday by senior outside linebacker and running back Brayden Morgan, an E.C. Glass transfer, and senior defensive end Colton Webster. Each is a captain and expected to play major roles on the team.\n\nHeritage returns five starters on both sides of the ball. \"I like the makeup of our team right now, I like the character of our team and I like our work ethic,\" Bradley said.\n\nBaker said he's out to turn things around after last season. Heritage was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, one year after advancing to the Class 3 state championship game.\n\n\"You never want to have that happen again,\" he said, \"so we're doing everything in our power to be the best we can be.\"\n\nBradley also highlighted his offensive line, and junior linebacker Zaid Holloway (back after starting all 11 games last year) and junior quarterback Ayden Slash.\n\n\"I like his tenacity, I like his moxie, I like his durability,\" the coach said of Slash.\n\nThe Pioneers also have a new defensive coordinator in Dayn Washburn, over from Brookville.\n\nJefferson Forest\n\nCoach J.T. Crews and his players returned football pride back to Jefferson Forest last year, after several down seasons. After seven practices, returning players are trying to get that excitement to carry over into 2024.\n\n\"We had that success last year. How are we gonna handle it this year,\" Crews said. \"Are we gonna continue to attack things in the same way? Are we gonna continue to fight and scratch and claw and do whatever it takes to win, with the same level of hunger we had last year? And I think to this point, I've been really, really impressed.\"\n\nForest is beginning its fourth year under Crews. In addition to a strong senior class, he's welcoming players up from last year's 9-1 JV team. Watch for senior Logan Candis, an offensive guard who will be starting for the third straight year, and Cam McClendon, predominantly used as a kicker in the past but who is taking on additional roles at wide receiver and defensive back as a senior.\n\nJF has to replace quarterback Josiah Bell, a three-year starter who put together a strong senior season in 2023. Right now, there's a preseason battle between senior Dylan Marks, who has some experience at the position, and sophomore Peyton Jackson, who commanded the position on JV.\n\n\"I could not be more impressed with both of them at this point, and the fact that they're pushing each other to be better than I thought either of them would be at this point,\" Crews said.\n\nRustburg\n\nLongtime assistant Dustin Russell steps into the head coaching position, replacing Burt Torrence, who now is an assistant principal. Russell knows Rustburg inside and out, and his coaching staff also features former Altavista head coach Mike Scharnus and Scharnus' longtime assistant, Mike Reavis.\n\nThe Red Devils went 8-4 last year. Russell said improved weight room work has gotten his team stronger as a whole than its been in the 11 years he's been at the school.\n\nExpect the Red Devils to be tough again in 2024, even though they had to replace running back Qua Rosser and QB Mike Knight. They always are a physical bunch, and Russell expects that to continue.\n\n\"These guys have been in the trenches,\" Russell said. \"Like I said, we did lose some key pieces, but the nucleus of the team has had game reps. They know what the Seminole District is like.\"\n\nOn the non-district part of the schedule, Rustburg welcomes Appomattox on Sept. 6 for the annual Battle of the Lantern, which has been taking place continuously since 2015.\n\nBrookville\n\nIn his first season as head coach, Mike Lineburg has assembled an all-star staff that includes former Brookville head coach Jeff Woody, a former head coach in John Poindexter, and Bob Christmas — the former head coach at Jefferson Forest and Amherst who retired from full-time duties in 2021 after a 48-year career.\n\n\"The story that all of us share on that coaching staff is that we all love coaching and we all love student-athletes,\" said Lineburg, who returns to the sidelines for the first time in 27 years after guiding Brookville to an overall 49-19 record from 1992 through 1997.\n\nWith him at the press conference sat senior lineman Nick Massie and wide receiver/corner TaiShaun Cooks. Lineburg also is excited about several skill players, including quarterback Lincoln McDaniel and running back Elijah Hughes. He's also impressed with the offensive line, and said BHS will run a new odd front defensively.\n\nThe Bees are trying to improve on a 3-7 year in 2023. After the season, Jon Meeks announced he was stepping aside, ending a 10-year run at the school.\n\n\"We'll get after people all year. That's what we want to do is get after people,\" Lineburg said, \"and get better each week.\"\n\nOne thing that stood out about Lineburg in what amounted to his first organized press conference since accepting the job was his love for high school football. He spoke of it at length.\n\n\"The tradition starts here with these guys,\" he added.\n\nAmherst\n\nTres Liggon has obviously learned from disappointment. His sophomore campaign was cut short by a season-ending injury, so when the rising junior showed up Thursday, he spoke like someone grateful for another chance to serve as Amherst's quarterback.\n\n\"It was rough sitting on the sidelines watching my brothers play, not being able to help. Cheering them on, of course, but I'm just ready to be back out there with them.\"\n\nLiggon and receiver/safety Devonte Wade will highlight an athletic Amherst bunch in 2024, as coach Chris Moore begins his second year at the school.\n\nAmherst returns basically its entire offensive line. Moore held what he called Offensive Line University through winter and spring months, \"and we had 25 guys in there working. ... So I think that's gonna be a big advantage for us.\"\n\nMoore expects the Lancers to be \"bigger, we're gonna be stronger and we're smarter.\" His players, he said, are gaining confidence within his system.\n\nE.C. Glass\n\nGlass went 9-4 under first year coach Jamar Lovelace last year, and the Hilltoppers look to remain competitive in the district and in Region 4D again this season.\n\n\"It's a lot easier with the guys knowing the expectations of how we want to do things and establishing our culture,\" Lovelace said. \"And I think we've done a good job of that. That's on top of hitting the weights and becoming a bigger, stronger, faster football team. And what we've been focused on is just cutting down on our mistakes. We want to win every Friday night, and we don't want to help other teams.\"\n\nExpect Max Calloway to step into the quarterback role full-time after sharing it last season with Marty Kittrell, who graduated in the spring. The Hilltoppers have to replace several dynamic players, such as running back Taveon Carter and all-state linebacker and running back Michael Thomas, who helped his team steal the Little Brown Jug from rival Heritage last season.\n\nBut Glass returns six starters on each side of the ball and brings back guys who had experience off the bench. The deepest group is wide receivers, Lovelace said. \"Pretty much everybody from that group is back,\" the coach added. \"It's an old group; lots of seniors in that group, as well.\"\n\nWatch out for Rustburg transfer Ace Thornton, who was dynamic last year at wide receiver and safety.\n\nLiberty\n\nThe Minutemen have lost 27 straight games and endured back-to-back 0-10 seasons. They didn't score in 2023 until their final game, and that score occurred late in a 49-6 loss to Amherst.\n\nCoach Daryl Robertson is beginning his third year with the school. Last year, he said, was filled with adversity, and he said his players learned how to overcome it.\n\nDuring 7 on 7s during the offseason, his players wore shirts that read \"It's personal.\"\n\n\"We've had a lot of turnover within our program and everything that happens, we take it in stride. Everything that happens, it's personal. ... That's a chip on our shoulder, it's a growing chip every day.\"\n\nSenior middle linebacker Michael Bradley echoed those sentiments. \"Feel like there's a lot to prove this year. A lot of people have counted us out,\" he said.\n\nRobertson said LHS has added five new coaches this season.\n\n\"We're older. So just being older, being more mature, we're able to look more crisp in our movements now,\" he said, \"and guys are buying into new schemes, new systems.\"\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThe gathering was a rarity for high school football programs, at least in Virginia. Bradley organized the day's press conferences, and Rocco said the Seminole had plans for other events later in the year.\n\n\"I think it's just an awesome idea to give these kids in this district, what we think is the best district in the state of Virginia, a chance to get more publicity,\" Bradley said. \"I think it's a chance to get our district out there a little more. I think it's a competitive district. ... I think it's something we can build on in the future.\"\n\nBen Cates, (434) 385-5527\n\nbcates@newsadvance.com\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nBen Cates\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
