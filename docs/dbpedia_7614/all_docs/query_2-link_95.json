        "text": "The Beasts Pirates[2] are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew led by their governor-general, Kaidou, formerly one of the Four Emperors. They were based in Wano Country, specifically headquartered on Onigashima.[3][4]\n\nFor the past 26 years, the Beast Pirates consolidated their power in Wano, which they occupied through an alliance with the country's shogun, Kurozumi Orochi.[3][5] Within the past four years, the crew partnered with Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown to create artificial Zoan Devil Fruits called SMILE Fruits, leading to the crew having over 500 users with Devil Fruit powers. After the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance captured Caesar, destroyed the SMILE Factory and defeated Doflamingo, Kaidou turned to a new alliance with the Big Mom Pirates. The two Emperors' alliance planned to conquer the world by obtaining the Ancient Weapons and the One Piece.[6] Part of this plan is Kaidou's \"New Onigashima Project\", which sought to replace Orochi as shogun with Yamato during the latest Fire Festival.[7] This scheme ultimately failed, as during the Raid on Onigashima, all their top officers, alongside his fellow Emperor Big Mom, were defeated one after another by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance and Kaidou himself was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates.[8] After the battle, Kaidou was sent flying down into an underground magma chamber and was caught in a massive volcanic explosion,[9] while the fates of the remaining members are unclear.\n\nAs a result, Kaidou was no longer considered as one of the Four Emperors following the announcement of his defeat, leaving the overall status of the Beasts Pirates unknown.\n\nDue to their actions and role, they are the main antagonists of the Zou Arc and Wano Country Arc, and one of the central antagonist groups of the Whole Cake Island Saga and Wano Country Saga.\n\nJolly Roger[]\n\nThe crew's Jolly Roger consists of a skull placed centrally above four intersected crossbones (one vertical, one horizontal, and a diagonal pair, similar to the Blackbeard Pirates' flag). The skull is leaner than the traditional shape, mildly frowning based on its narrowed eye sockets, has upward-curving horns like Kaidou's, and is further flanked left and right by two long rectangles that are slightly bent into outward-facing arcs, set behind the horns and crossbones. Initially seen depicted as white,[10] the rectangles are colored lavender on the sails of Queen's ship.[11]\n\nCrew Members[]\n\nSee also the associated category: Beasts Pirates.\n\nGovernor-General\n\nKaidou (Unknown status)?\n\nAll-Stars\n\nKing Queen Jack\n\nTobiroppo\n\nPage One Ulti Who's-Who Black Maria Sasaki X Drake (Undercover)* (Former)‡\n\nShinuchi\n\nSheepshead (Unknown status)?

Kaidou as the Governor-General (総督, Sōtoku?, English version: \"Supreme Commander\")[13] is at the top holding complete dominance over everyone. Directly below him rank his three executive officers (the All-Stars or \"Calamities\") to whom a large number of second-ranking officers (the Shinuchi) answer. The latter are spearheaded by a select few: the Tobiroppo, who are the strongest among them. The bottom ranks, comprised of legions of rank and file, are further grouped into three divisions: the roughly 500 \"elite\" Gifters (all granted Artificial Zoan powers in Kaidou's efforts to create the world's strongest crew made up entirely of Devil Fruit users),[14][15][16][17] roughly nine times as many Pleasures (those who have failed to gain abilities from eating Artificial Zoan fruits), and finally the lowest-level foot soldiers (and presumably the most numerous) called Waiters (those who await their chance to get Artificial Zoan powers).[16] The Numbers (artificial imitations of the ancient giant race) are yet another special group, although where precisely, if at all, they fit into the hierarchy is unknown;[18] however, at least one, worked under Black Maria, one of the Tobiroppo.[19]\n\nTo bolster his forces, Kaidou is ever on the lookout for strong new fighters to forcibly recruit, most notably seeming to target distinguished New World pirate captains, whose crews will see themselves fully subsumed into the Beasts Pirates over time. Of desired recruits, those that willingly submit to Kaidou are gladly welcomed, whereas those that resist and stand against him are crushed, captured, and then continuously tortured and forced into penal labor until their spirit breaks and they submit as well.[20][21]\n\nThree crews led by members of the Worst Generation—the Drake Pirates,[22] On Air Pirates,[23] and Hawkins Pirates[24]—have at one point been subordinate to the Beasts Pirates, with X Drake[25] and Basil Hawkins[24] serving as Shinuchi (Drake formerly so, and having also been one of the Tobiroppo, who count at least two other ex-pirate captains among them),[26][27] and Apoo acting as an \"informant\".[28]\n\nThe Beasts Pirates follow a strength-based system of meritocracy wherein crew members will rank higher the greater their fighting ability. It is possible, even encouraged, among them to challenge those holding a higher post than theirs in order to take it from them; this is shown with the Tobiroppo, who, with Kaidou's assent, may fight an acting All-Star and, in case of victory, take their spot. The reverse holds true as well, where especially the upper ranks may seek to eliminate those ranked below them if they feel like it, as shown with Queen expressing his intent to kill one of the Tobiroppo and create an open seat (though this turned out to be due to Drake's treachery). As a result of this system, an air of very outright hostility is generated in the crew, especially among higher-ups, where those of the same rank may see themselves as rivals or those differing in rank may seek to kill (and replace) one another. Some may show no interest in answering to their superiors due to viewing them as mere obstacles to their aims of moving up the ranks.[29][30][31][27]\n\nMost of the crew, befitting its \"beastly\" theme, tend to be wild, savage, and bloodthirsty in demeanor, with Kaidou himself feared by most of his men, especially due to his mood-swinging, violent tendencies while drunk. Most of the Beasts Pirates dress scantily with a darkish color motif, resembling a blend of barbarian and biker/gangster fashion: donning the likes of metal helmets, leather caps, leather belts and straps tied especially around their torsos (the former usually seen with skull buckles), furred and shoulder-padded cloaks/capes, fur-lined pauldrons, open leather jackets, gloves, bracelets, pants often knee-padded and made of leather as well, i.e., with spikes and studs oft seen; most male members go bare-chested, and most female ones wear brassieres and panties of the aforesaid style.[32][15][33][16][34] Like their horned general, many crew members bear artificial horns of some kind on their bare heads or ornamental headpieces (e.g., helmets) that are horned,[35] while others are even seen with fangs, among other animal traits (often courtesy of their SMILE powers), and a large portion of the crew is shown sporting hair that is some combination of long, wild, or flowing.\n\nOtherwise noteworthy, compared to other large pirate crews (e.g. the Donquixote Pirates or Whitebeard Pirates), is that there is a fairly more evenly balanced ratio of male-to-female members in the lower ranks of the Beasts Pirates, whereas most other large pirate groups typically see women only in the upper echelons, if at all.[36] The gender ratio remains somewhat close to even in the higher ranks as well, with many Shinuchi and two of the Tobiroppo being women.\n\nThe Beasts Pirates formerly occupied Wano at large to use as their base of operations, and specifically were headquartered on Onigashima where Kaidou himself in his castle and the crew's higher-ups tended to reside, and where the whole crew and its allies, especially Orochi and his followers, assembled during the annual Fire Festival.[4][37][38]\n\nAlliances[]\n\nFor over two decades, the Beasts Pirates worked intimately with Kurozumi Orochi and his government in Wano, helping enforce his oppressive rule; Orochi boasted that he feared no one, not even the World Government, with Kaidou backing him up.[39] Some of Kaidou's forces, from Waiters to Gifters, were found stationed and working throughout Wano alongside Orochi's samurai, e.g. guarding, monitoring, and generally administering towns, and took aggressive action against anyone who publicly opposed or merely spoke ill of the shogun.[40][41][42][43][44][45] Additionally, it was the Beasts Pirates who ran Udon's labor camps wherein thousands of those guilty of rebellion against Orochi were held, until their liberation.[46][47] It was shown that Beasts Pirates could be directly ordered by Orochi[48] or asked for assistance by the shogun's allies, shown when \"Kyoshiro\" requested that Queen send assassins after someone who had defied the Kyoshiro Family.[49] Some Beasts Pirates were permanently posted in the Flower Capital to aid Orochi however he saw fit.[50]\n\nThrough their alliance with the Kurozumi shogunate, the Beasts Pirates have come to enjoy full access to Wano's immense natural resources (i.e., its ore deposits) with which they have high-quality weapons, including Seastone-based ones, mass-produced in factories set up across the country. Said arms the Beasts Pirates originally exported in exchange for mass-import of the SMILE fruits manufactured by Doflamingo (in addition to the World Government using the ex-Warlord's brokering to get access to said weaponry), and it was this backdoor trade that has allowed Kaidou to maintain his martial power and dominion in the New World; thus, Doflamingo was Kaidou's most essential trading partner and vice-versa.[51][52][53][54][16]\n\nHalfway through the Wano Country Arc, the Beasts Pirates entered into an alliance with the Big Mom Pirates following Big Mom's coming to Wano,[6] which was formally announced during the latest Fire Festival. Said announcement was followed by Kaidou himself bringing his alliance with Orochi's shogunate to an abrupt end, by executing Orochi and declaring his \"New Onigashima Project\". This project would see the Beasts Pirates seizing total control over Wano as to render it a lawless \"pirate empire\" (a paradise for pirates of which Kaidou's child Yamato would be the new shogun), this to prepare for a coming world war wherein the Beasts Pirates would fight alongside the Big Mom Pirates, seek to acquire the Ancient Weapons to use in said war, and ultimately try to claim the One Piece itself. In the process, Kaidou gave Orochi's followers the ultimatum to either take the pirates' side or be killed off,[7] leading to them immediately pledging their loyalty to Kaidou.[55]\n\nOverall, the forces originally under Orochi number around 10,000—the 5,000 samurai led by Hotei and the 5,000 ninja led by Fukurokuju—making for a total of 30,000 people when they and the Beasts Pirates are fully assembled together (and all of whom are presently at Kaidou's beck and call, following Orochi's killing and said ten thousand swearing loyalty to Kaidou).[12][55]\n\nCrew Structure[]\n\nAll-Stars[]\n\n“ Drought, Plague, Conflagration!! We're the three calamities that protect Kaidou-san!!! And because we can't be beat, we're the All-Stars!!! ”\n\n— Queen[56]\n\nThe All-Stars (大看板, Ōkanban?, English version: Lead Performers) are the crew's top executives, second only to Kaidou himself in rank, authority, and battle prowess, and serve as Kaidou's handpicked, close confidants and protectors. The three men holding this rank—King, Queen, and Jack—are informally referred to as the Calamities (災害, Saigai\"?, English version: Disasters) for their respective epithets, each corresponding to a type of disaster.[2][57][58][59][56] Jack is called \"the Drought\" for his general destructiveness that renders any land he rampages on ruined, as if a drought has occurred.[2] Queen is called \"the Plague\" for his expertise in creating and weaponizing various artificial diseases.[60] King is called \"the Conflagration\" because of his natural ability to ignite and manipulate fire from his body.[61]\n\nIn terms of combat ability, the All-Stars have proven themselves very fearsome: Jack, for example, was able to fight one-on-one for five full days straight against the two rulers (and strongest warriors) of the Mink Tribe, who took turns against him every twelve hours, and he was never at risk of being defeated.[62] In keeping with their status and strength, the three have incredibly high, ten-figure bounties, with Jack's at 1,000,000,000,[63] Queen's at 1,320,000,000,[36] and King's at 1,390,000,000.[64] Each All-Star possesses an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit ability, greatly bolstering their physical prowess and granting them advantageous physical attributes: Jack can become a woolly mammoth,[65] Queen a brachiosaurus,[66] and King a pteranodon.[67] All three are also seen carrying and/or fighting with bladed weaponry,[68][58][36] with Queen additionally using firearms to shoot his virus-loaded bullets,[69][70] on top of his various cybernetic body enhancements.[71][72]\n\nWhile Queen is a human cyborg,[71] Jack is a fish-man[73] and King is a part of the fire-creating lunarian race, which is widely thought to be extinct.[74][61][72] Like Kaidou himself, the All-Stars are noted for their size, dwarfing the average human; Luffy's first run-in with Kaidou led some of the Beasts Pirates at the Udon Prisoner Mine to assume he would be of similar size to an All-Star prior to laying eyes on him.[75]\n\nThus far, Jack and Queen have been shown to captain their own personal vessels, bearing figureheads based on their respective Zoan ability.[76][77] Said two are also introduced as de-facto rulers of Wano provinces, Jack sitting in control of Kuri[78] while Queen runs Udon (specifically the prisoner mine there),[79] and they tend to come and personally involve themselves in notable goings-on there.[78][57] An All-Star may be send out to lead pivotal missions abroad, such as Jack being sent with many subordinates to find and retrieve Raizo on Zou[65][80] and trying to rescue Doflamingo from the Marine convoy carrying him to Impel Down.[76][81] Generally, while the All-Stars seem to share a sibling-like sense of rivalry,[58] they are fiercely loyal to their Governor-General and carry out his orders to their best ability. Like most of the crew, they all also reside on Onigashima.[74]\n\nTobiroppo[]\n\nThe Tobiroppo (飛び六胞, Tobi Roppō?, literally meaning \"Flying Six Fellows\"; English version: Tobi Roppo) are a special group of the six strongest Shinuchi. Currently, the group consists of only five people: Page One, Ulti, Who's-Who, Black Maria, and Sasaki,[82] with the former sixth member, X Drake, having gone renegade from the crew.[27]\n\nThe Tobiroppo are well-reputed for their strength and stand out significantly in the crew. They are closest to Kaidou besides the All-Stars; Kaidou himself holds them in high regard.[83][84][85] During the raid on Onigashima, it was noted that the Tobiroppo might eliminate a hundred enemies at a time and that the enemy alliance's elite samurai may only manage to slow them down.[83][29][86][87][88] The Tobiroppo's bounties are quite high as well: ranging from 222 million (X Drake)[89] to 546 million (Who's-Who).[90] The defeat of two of them—said to have never happened before—came as a shock to the rest of the crew and was enough to weaken their spirits, even with the defeaters being unknown.[91]\n\nUnlike most Shinuchi, the Tobiroppo have eaten real Zoan Devil Fruits, Ancient types like the All-Stars: Page One can become a spinosaurus, Ulti a pachycephalosaurus, Who's-Who a saber-toothed tiger, Black Maria a Rosamygale grauvogeli spider, Sasaki a triceratops, and the ex-Tobiroppo Drake an allosaurus.[92] All of the Tobiroppo with the exception of Page One, have been seen with weapons: ex-member Drake uses an axe and rapier in battle, Sasaki carries a mechanized drill-sword,[93] Who's-Who a dagger disguised as a sword,[94] Ulti wields a morning star,[95] and Black Maria uses brass knuckles and a flaming, wanyudo-headed polearm.[96]\n\nBeing directly below the All-Stars in the hierarchy, the Tobiroppo are specified as next in line to become an All-Star should a current one die, with some of them (expressly Who's-Who and Sasaki) wishing to personally kill an All-Star and usurp his post.[82][29] Drake, Who's-Who, and Sasaki were all formerly active as captains of their own respective crews,[26] with Drake, rather than loyal to Kaidou, having been an undercover Marine spy, something eventually discovered and leading to Drake being declared an enemy.[97][27]\n\nThe Tobiroppo's duties include the assassination of assailants of either the Beasts Pirates' or (formerly) shogun Orochi's associates (e.g., the Kyoshiro Family), with an All-Star dispatching them in the process,[49][83][98] though some of the Tobiroppo are known to ignore calls from All-Stars.[26] During the latest Fire Festival, the Tobiroppo were the ones with whom Kaidou entrusted the task of finding and retrieving his son, Yamato.[82][99]\n\nSome of the members of the Tobiroppo command a designated group of Gifters whose powers stick to a common theme. Sasaki commands the Armored Division, a group of Gifters who have the attributes of animals that are known for their defensive characteristics, such as tough skin or a hard shell. Who's-Who commands a group of Gifters who possess feline attributes. Black Maria commands a group of Gifters who have reptilian attributes.\n\nShinuchi[]\n\nThe Shinuchi (真打ち, Shin'uchi?, English version: Headliners)[100] are the crew's second-grade officers—most of whom are elite Gifters—who are responsible for leading the Waiters, Pleasures, and lower Gifters.[101]\n\nPowerful people who join the crew may attain this rank over a short time span, as Hawkins did,[24] and X Drake was even able to become one of the Tobiroppo.[25] This also shows that holding the powers of a SMILE fruit is not a prerequisite for the position.\n\nApart from the Tobiroppo, the Shinuchi's strength seems to vary from individual to individual and depend on whom they are fighting. For example, Sheepshead was easily fended off by Brook and taken out by a single strike from Sanji,[102] Holed'em was defeated in one blow from Luffy,[103] and Dobon was easily beaten by Eustass Kid and Luffy when both were Seastone-shackled.[104] Hawkins, on the other hand, held his own against others from the Worst Generation, easily threatening Roronoa Zoro and Luffy simultaneously[105] and clashing with Trafalgar Law.[106]\n\nShinuchi are typically the highest crew authorities in Wano's towns and villages (outside the Flower Capital) that high-class officials reside in, and so are usually the ones to address smaller-scale issues happening nearby. Bakura Town, for example, has three Shinuchi stationed there.[42] There are Shinuchi who hold other positions in a region, such as Babanuki being the warden in the Udon region's prisoner mines, and fellow Shinuchi Daifugo, Solitaire, and Dobon working under Babanuki as vice wardens.[107] Shinuchi may even be granted personal vessels to captain.[108]\n\nGifters[]\n\nThe Gifters (与えられた者達（ギフターズ）, Gifutāzu?) are the crew's elite soldiers, comprised of nearly 500[14][17] Artificial Zoan users. Having eaten SMILEs, they have Zoan-like abilities, equipped with the strength and bodily attributes of animals. Only 10% of the people who have eaten SMILEs gain powers and are thus considered \"gifted\" (hence their name).[109] Overall, Kaidou seems to highly value the Gifters due to his dream of creating an all-Zoan pirate crew.[15]\n\nThe SMILE powers made the Gifters part-animal, having transformed parts of their body, e.g., their heads or limbs, into non-corresponding parts of an animal. Some Gifters have permanent animal attributes, in some cases taking the form of extra appendages (even sentient animal heads), and may gain certain bodily faculties associated with the animal in question, like flight, enhanced senses, etc. How powerful a given transformation turns out to be is considered a gamble, and only those with advanced mastery of their ability are able to deactivate their transformation at will (though this seems rare).[110][15][109][111][112][113] In the crew, many Gifters go by names corresponding to their animal power (the name of the animal plus either \"-man\" or \"-lady\" depending on their sex), and have pairs of black horns on their heads.\n\nAs ability users, the Gifters are formidable especially in cumulative numbers, and some, possibly many, of them used to be independent pirates who once dreamt of becoming Pirate King, before being beaten and broken into submission by Kaidou and introduced into his ranks;[17] especially in terms of physical strength, the Gifters tend to be far above normal rank and file.[114]\n\nWith the defeat of Doflamingo and Caesar Clown's capture, Kaidou's building up his army of Gifters was brought to an abrupt end, leaving them permanently curtailed to their current numbers.[15] Several Gifters (including some Shinuchi) defected from the crew amid the Wano rebellion on Onigashima, because Tama fed them dangos created by her Devil Fruit ability to brainwash and \"tame\" them.[115]\n\nArmored Division[]\n\nThe Armored Division (装甲部隊, Sōkō Butai?) is a group of Gifters led by Sasaki of the Tobiroppo. True to their name, they wield powerful defenses thanks to their armored-type SMILE abilities (based on hard-shelled/skinned animals such as rhinos, scorpions, and urchins),[116] on top of bazookas for offense and seemingly steel-made ballistic shields for additional protection.[117] Sasaki tends to let himself be carried on a throne, similar to Queen's, atop a large rhinoceros SMILE user, from there letting the Armored Division deal with enemies until his own involvement is required.[116] The group is currently tamed by Tama, now fighting for the rebel alliance.[118]\n\nPleasures[]\n\nThe Pleasures (笑う者達（プレジャーズ）, Purejāzu?)[119] are the crew's mid-level foot soldiers, only above the Waiters. While having been found worthy of eating SMILE fruits at some point, they are the unfortunate many who failed to gain any animal traits after eating one, being in the 90% who ate dud fruits (and since for every Gifter there are nine Pleasures, one could infer the number of Pleasures to stand at around 4,500, though any specific number has not been mentioned yet).[120]\n\nThe Pleasures did not only fail to gain abilities from partaking of the faulty fruits. Due to their side effects, they always express emotions of pleasure (hence their name), smiling and laughing all the time regardless of their true feelings, even when taking harm. In addition to being unable to express other emotions, they share the standard Devil Fruit weakness of being unable to swim. They all have single white horns on their heads[119][120] and have been seen serving as patrolling scouts in Wano.[citation needed]\n\nMany of the Pleasures defected from the crew during the Wano rebellion, on Onigashima's Live Floor, after Queen attempted to sacrifice them to his Ice Oni virus and called them expendable.[121][122]\n\nWaiters[]\n\nThe Waiters (待つ者達（ウェイターズ）, Weitāzu?) are the crew's low-level foot soldiers who have yet to eat the SMILEs, still waiting for their chance to gain animal powers (hence their name).[123] Following Doflamingo's defeat, since SMILE fruits are no longer produced, the Waiters have permanently lost the chance to become Gifters.[15][124]\n\nThe first confirmed Waiters were shown in Udon's Prisoner Mine, there to fight Luffy and Hyougoro in a sumo match and wielded various swords. However, none of those particular Waiters were of notable strength, as they were all knocked out by Luffy's Haoshoku Haki.[125] Unlike the Pleasures and Gifters, none of the Waiters have horns, signifying their lack of having eaten SMILEs.\n\nFollowing Queen's sacrificing of his non-Gifter subordinates to the Ice Oni, many Waiters on the Skull Dome's Live Floor defected to the rebellion's side; the collective number of renegated Waiters and Pleasures being 4,000.[122]\n\nNumbers[]\n\nFurther information: Numbers\n\nThe Numbers (ナンバーズ, Nanbāzu?) are a group of ten former science subjects who underwent Gigantification experiments on Punk Hazard in order to recreate the ancient giant race but were deemed failures for some reason. They were also mentioned to have been bought by Kaidou instead of joining him, making them akin to living weapons.[18] Twenty years ago, they were already present among Kaidou's forces.[126]\n\nIf they have a role among the Beasts Pirates aside from being a brute fighting force is unknown, but they are infamous enough to be known and feared by Hakumai children. At least some of them wield spiked clubs similar to Kaidou's, and they possess immense strength befitting their size. Appearance-wise, they are not only more massive than normal giants but also horned, like natural ancient giants are, and some are more inhumanly proportioned than others. Moreover, the Numbers are noted for their drinking problems.[127][128][100][129][18]\n\nMarys[]\n\nThe Marys (メアリーズ, Mearīzu?) are the Beasts Pirates' surveillance force. They consist of both humans and cyborg animals, all of which have a special paper mask with an eye shape on it covering their face, with whatever is beneath letting them transmit everything they see and hear to other Marys. This enables them to know of everything going on within the bounds of Onigashima, with many of the cyborg animals stealthily perched on the rafters of the side rooms in Kaidou's castle, to spy on the goings-on in those places. Marys can broadcast the sounds they hear out of the other Marys' masks, enabling people's voices to reach the entire castle.[130][131][132] In particular, human Marys can activate the \"Diffusion Mode\" (拡散モード, Kakusan Mōdo?) to connect themselves with cyborg Marys.[133] Moreover, human Marys may use an electronic scope from under the mask (similar to that of Pacifistas) to identify individuals, even ones who are hidden.[134]\n\nCurrently, the Gifters Bao Huang (a Shinuchi) and Caimanlady are the only named human members of the Marys. The name \"Mary\" is likely a pun on me ari (目あり?), literally meaning \"having eyes\".\n\nTerritories[]\n\nThe Beasts Pirates are known to have the following territories under their control:\n\nAn unnamed Winter Island protected by Scotch and where the revolutionary Gaburu and his army operated.[135]\n\nWano Country, allied with the Kurozumi Family after usurping the previous shogunate twenty years ago.\n\nOnigashima, the official base of operations for the Beasts Pirates.\n\nAfter the crew defeat during the Raid on Onigashima, Wano Country is now under the Straw Hat Pirates protection, and the unnamed Winter Island's protection status is unknown.\n\nCrew Strength[]\n\nCaptained by an Emperor, the Beasts Pirates were recognized as one of the four most powerful pirate crews in the world. Donquixote Doflamingo, a former Warlord of the Sea and the former leader of an incredibly powerful pirate crew of his own who usually maintains a fearless attitude, was deeply scared of Kaidou.[136] Kaidou also defeated another Warlord of the Sea, Gecko Moria, and massacred his crew.[137] They attempted to attack the Whitebeard Pirates in the hope of killing Whitebeard, something few would dare, and took on the Red Hair Pirates.[138] They were stated by Shepherd Ju Peter of the Five Elders to be one of the few entities capable of stopping Blackbeard and his crew.[139] During the timeskip, they formed an alliance with the Drake Pirates, a crew from the Worst Generation.[22] However, after Drake was exposed to have freed Law from his imprisonment, he and his crew became enemies of the Beasts Pirates.[27] They also formed alliances with the On Air Pirates and Hawkins Pirates, two other Worst Generation crews,[23] possibly after Kaidou himself defeated Eustass Kid, another member of the Worst Generation with apparent ease.[15][24] According to Yasuie, the samurai who supported the Kouzuki Family failed in their first rebellion against Orochi due to Kaidou's protection.[140]\n\nAfter conquering Wano Country, the Beasts Pirates had many of the country's samurai working for them as subordinates. These samurai are renowned across the world, as they keep Wano safe from threats and even the Marines fear their power.[141] However, some samurai secretly oppose the Beasts Pirates and Wano's shogun, Kurozumi Orochi.[142]\n\nLike the other Emperor-led crews, the Beasts Pirates possess territory in the New World, where they rule with an iron fist and brutally stifle any insurrections.[135] Kaidou currently possesses a \"Road Poneglyph\".[143]\n\nLike with the other crews captained by an Emperor the range higher-ranked members of the Beast Pirates, the All-Stars and the Tobi Roppo, are extremely powerful pirates with Six of them being confirmed to have Ancient Zoan devil fruits that make them tremendously endurant and strong close combat fighters. The crew has also absorbed numerous strong Pirates such as X-Drake, Scratchmen Apoo, Basil Hawkins of the Worst Generation or Who's-Who and Sasaki into their ranks after they joined willingly the crew or were beaten and broken into servitude in Udon.\n\nThe true strength of this crew lies in their Underworld connections. Due to Kaidou's alliance with Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown, they had access to SMILEs to help form an army of over 500 artificial Zoan Devil Fruit users.[144] Indeed, the sheer amount of members with SMILE Devil Fruit powers is enough to overwhelm and force both the likes of Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro to retreat after attempting a frontal assault on Kaidou's castle, with the latter noting that many of the Gifters were highly skilled warriors that could wear them down quickly.[30] They also have access to Caesar's poison gas weapons, which they used to destroy a city of minks.[145] The Beasts Pirates also have at their disposal weapons made of Seastone, long-range cannons, and biological weapons created by Queen.\n\nWith the destruction of Caesar and Doflamingo's operations, Kaidou can no longer gain more Gifters for his army. Jack's failure to retrieve Doflamingo also cost them a great ally.[15]\n\nDuring the Wano Country Arc, Kaidou formed an alliance with fellow Emperor Charlotte Linlin, captain of the Big Mom Pirates, increasing their power.[146] After Kaidou decapitated Orochi, the ninja and samurai who once served the shogun also swore allegiance to Kaidou and joined his forces.[7][55] However, thanks to Tama's dangos she was able to use her power to make a huge chunk of the Gifters loyal to her and switch sides and attack their former comrades, thus their numbers began to dwindle.[147] Furtermore, their alliance with Big Mom was put in jeopardy when she learned they burned a certain village down.[148]\n\nAfter Kaidou and Big Mom were defeated, the crew lost most of its power as well as their influence in Wano and their status as an Emperor's crew.\n\nShips[]\n\nAs one of the most powerful pirate crews in the world, the Beasts Pirates possess a fleet of pirate ships. Among them are a series of ships with scorpion figureheads, which were used during the war against the Mink Tribe in order to bring reinforcements.[149] These ships were also utilized in a rescue attempt on Doflamingo's prison convoy, and though unsuccessful, they managed to survive.[150] The fleet later returned to Zou in preparation for resuming its attack on the Mink Tribe.[151] Though the fleet launched an attack on Zunesha attempting to kill it, the giant elephant was ordered to fight back, who then destroyed the entire fleet with one swing of its gargantuan trunk.[152]\n\nIn addition to this, the Beasts Pirates possess a fleet of ships that are seemingly used for internal affairs within their home territory of Wano. These ships, which are large enough to dwarf even the Thousand Sunny, feature a figurehead of the crew's Jolly Roger and sails marked with a \"百\". Notably, three of these ships were sent to sink the Nine Red Scabbards on their way to Onigashima. Those ships are armed with high-quality, long-ranged cannons manufactured in Wano's factories, allowing them to easily hit enemy ships from afar.[153]\n\nPersonal Ships[]\n\nNotable members of the crew have their own personal vessels, from the All-Stars[76][77] to even Shinuchi.[108]\n\nMammoth[]\n\nFurther information: Mammoth\n\nThe Mammoth (マンモス号, Manmosu-gō?)[2] was the ship captained by Jack. It was a fairly large pirate ship, with its most noticeable trait being its mammoth head figurehead.[76] Jack sailed it into battle against Doflamingo's Marine escort, and he was defeated and reported as deceased.[81] Both the ship and the captain survived, albeit heavily battered.[150] However, it was fully destroyed by Zunesha during Jack's second attack on Zou.[152]\n\nQueen's Ship[]\n\nQueen's primary mode of transportation is a currently unnamed ship. This vessel appears to be far more intricate than the Mammoth, containing elements of both a traditional galleon and a more modernized battleship. The ship contains a large tower along with multiple sets of turrets. The central sail is inscribed with Queen's name, while a pair of smaller sails on either side contain the crew's jolly roger. Notably, the sail on the right takes on a standard appearance while the design on the left sail closely resembles the variant of the Jolly Roger present in Queen's tattoo. The figurehead resembles a brachiosaurus, which is Queen's Devil Fruit transformation. There is also a \"Q 03\" written on the port side of the ship.[77]\n\nScratchmen Apoo and Numbers' Ship[]\n\nApoo and the Numbers were shown returning to Wano on a vessel resembling Queen's personal ship, including a large tower in its center, with multiple side and central sails in black. However, the ship's figurehead has yet to be (canonically) shown, and it is currently unknown who captains it.[154]\n\nSpeed's Ship[]\n\nThe Shinuchi Speed is shown to have a personal vessel with a horse-shaped figurehead and a dark-colored central sail (It is shown to be white in the anime) bearing her name in block capitals, with the kanji for \"horse\" (馬, uma?) in-between the \"SP\" and \"EED\", with smaller side sails in the back showing the crew's Jolly Roger.[108]\n\nHistory[]\n\nPast[]\n\nAt least 33 years ago, Kaidou formed the Beasts Pirates[155] in hopes of fulfilling his dream of forming a crew consisting solely of Devil Fruit users.[15] The first person he recruited into his to-be crew was a young Lunarian, Alber, who was held as a test subject in Punk Hazard alongside Kaidou until they escaped, whom he renamed to \"King\" as a sign of strength.[156]\n\nAfter Orochi took the position of shogun during Kouzuki Oden's absence, Kaidou and his crew allied with Orochi and began occupying Wano Country in order to monopolize its resources. Twenty-three years ago, Kaidou fought Moria and killed his crew on Wano.[157] By the time Oden returned to Wano four years after he left to leave his wife and children in the care of his retainers, weapon factories were already built. During the years Oden was away, the Beasts Pirates aided Orochi with his oppression. Around half a year before Oden finished his voyage, the Beasts Pirates tried to threaten Oden's family, but they were driven back by Kawamatsu and Inuarashi.[158] The Beasts Pirates continued to occupy Wano for the next five years after Oden's return from his voyage.\n\nTwenty years ago, the Beasts Pirates captured Hyougoro and killed his wife and many of his followers.[159] While Oden and the Nine Red Scabbards were on their way to Onigashima, Kaidou and his crew confronted them in Udon. Oden managed to wound Kaidou, but in the end, Oden and his allies were defeated and imprisoned.[160]\n\nAfter Oden's execution, Kaidou and his All-Stars proceeded to burn down Oden Castle in order to kill the last two Kouzuki descendants, Momonosuke and Hiyori. However, Oden's wife sent Momonosuke, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, and Kikunojo 20 years into the future,[161] while Kawamatsu helped Hiyori escape Oden Castle.\n\nWhen the daimyos including Yasuie and Ushimaru tried to avenge Oden by staging a massive rebellion with the countless supporters of the Kouzuki Family, Kaidou personally intervened and the rebellion failed with a majority of them killed along with their families and the surviving dissidents were condemned to life imprisonment in Udon.\n\nSometime within the last four years, they formed an alliance with Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown in order to gain an army of artificial Zoan Devil Fruit users.[144]\n\nSummit War Saga[]\n\nMarineford Arc[]\n\nUpon hearing that the Whitebeard Pirates were headed to Marineford, Kaidou alongside King tried to intercept them so Kaidou could kill Whitebeard. However, they were stopped by the Red Hair Pirates.[138][162]\n\nPost-War Arc[]\n\nAfter the Summit War of Marineford, X Drake docked at one of Kaidou's islands. When Scotch confronted him, Drake asked him if Kaidou would be angry if he were to be attacked, which Scotch confirmed, prompting Drake to transform into a dinosaur and attack him.[163] Sometime after this, Drake began serving under Kaidou.[22]\n\nTimeskip[]\n\nWhen Momonosuke and his retainers returned, the Beasts Pirates discovered them when they left Wano Country and pursued them.[164]\n\nSeventeen days before Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law's arrival, Jack and his men entered Zou to search for Raizo the ninja. They came into conflict with the Mink Tribe, who easily beat back the Pleasures, leading Jack to send in the Gifters.[80] Soon afterward, Jack and the Gifters came into conflict with the Musketeers led by Inuarashi. However, when the sunset, the Musketeers were forced to retreat and the Guardians took over. Their leader, Nekomamushi, dealt a powerful blow to Jack, and the battle between the Beasts Pirates and the Guardians commenced.[165]\n\nThe battle lasted for five days, with the Musketeers and Guardians switching out every 12 hours. The minks eventually managed to gain the upper hand, though they were never able to suppress Jack himself. Finally, Jack lost his patience and used Koro, a gas weapon invented by Caesar, covering the Mokomo Dukedom in poisonous gas. With the minks now easily subdued, the Beasts Pirates began slaughtering the warriors. Jack crucified Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, and the strongest warriors and tortured them to find Raizo's location. However, they received no answers as the minks passed out.[166]\n\nDressrosa Saga[]\n\nCaribou's Kehihihihi in the New World[]\n\nOn one of the islands Kaidou ruled in the New World, a revolution had been going on. The rebelling soldiers picked up their attack when the pirate Caribou entered the island, who they thought to be their deceased leader Gaburu.[167] Scotch easily put a stop to the rebellion[135] and later captured Gaburu's grandmother, planning to use her as an example for the revolutionaries.[168]\n\nHowever, Caribou staged a counterattack and succeeded in defeating Scotch.[169] Suddenly, Drake arrived and defeated Caribou,[170] carrying the pirate onto his ship.[171]\n\nPunk Hazard Arc[]\n\nUpon seeing Caesar Clown being defeated by Monkey D. Luffy, a man with two horns told another that he was going to inform Jack about what just transpired. The other man was scared, however, fearing what would happen if Jack got involved.[172]\n\nDressrosa Arc[]\n\nWhile this happened, other members of the Beasts Pirates received word that Donquixote Doflamingo had fallen.[22]\n\nThe next day, Jack received word of Doflamingo's downfall and left Zou to go rescue him, leaving behind some subordinates.[173] Led by Gifters Shinuchi Sheepshead, the remaining pirates continued terrorizing the survivors and searching for Raizo. The Straw Hat Pirates led by Sanji entered the island and came into conflict with the Beasts Pirates by preventing Sheepshead from chasing after a mink.[174] The Straw Hats managed to defeat Sheepshead, and the pirates following him retreated. Tired of Raizo not showing himself after all their effort, the Beasts Pirates decided to report that Raizo was not there, and it was reported that they left the island.[175]\n\nMeanwhile, Kaidou attempted suicide by jumping off a Sky Island and landed on the Kid Pirates' base. However, he survived the fall and prepared to have Doflamingo help him start the greatest war in the world.[176]\n\nA few days later, Jack attacked the Marine convoy that was escorting Doflamingo. Though he succeeded in sinking two of the ships, Jack was eventually brought down and reported as dead, though his body was not found.[81]\n\nWhole Cake Island Saga[]\n\nZou Arc[]\n\nJack survived the battle and recovered from his wounds on the Mammoth, which was surrounded by other Beasts Pirates ships.[150] Soon after, the fleet returned to Zou as Jack punished Sheepshead for having failed his search for Raizo. A subordinate suggested that they attack the minks while they were still weakened, but Jack declared that he would simply kill Zunesha instead.[151]\n\nThe attack commenced, with the fleet shooting at Zunesha's front left leg in order to bring it down, with Jack intending to make it kneel so he could attack its face. They succeeded in bringing the elephant to a knee, but Zunesha immediately stood back up after conversing with Kouzuki Momonosuke. Under Momonosuke's command, it annihilated the entire fleet with a swing of its trunk.\n\nImmediately afterwards, Scratchmen Apoo reported to Kaidou that they had lost contact with Jack's fleet.[177]\n\nAfter hearing about Jack's failure to rescue Doflamingo, Kaidou lamented on the loss of SMILE, growing emotional that he could no longer have a crew of entirely Devil Fruit users. Some of his subordinates wondered if they should start taking the Straw Hat and Heart Alliance seriously, but Kaidou hit them out of the building with his mace, saying that they were nowhere near his level and pointing to the defeated Eustass Kid as an example. As for Jack, he remained underwater, impatiently waiting for rescue.[178]\n\nLevely Arc[]\n\nKaidou was contacted by Big Mom and the two Emperors argued over the right to kill Luffy.[179]\n\nWano Country Saga[]\n\nWano Country Arc[]\n\nWhile at the market in Kuri, a group of scouts harassed a girl named Tama with their baboon Hihimaru. Tama rashly mentioned the Kouzuki Family, leading them to capture her. They then went on to attack Luffy, who had come to Wano illegally, at Kuri Beach. Luffy defeated the scouts and rescued Tama, and she tamed Hihimaru with her Devil Fruit power. Hawkins heard about this and decided to go after Luffy himself,[180] and he confronted Luffy, Tama, and Roronoa Zoro at a wasteland near the ruins of Amigasa Village.[181] Luffy, Zoro, and Tama managed to escape to Okobore Town,[182] but Holed'em had heard about Tama taming Hihimaru and so had the Gifters Gazelleman and Batman kidnap her and bring her to Bakura Town.[183]\n\nAfter discovering that Zoro, who was a nationally wanted criminal, was in Bakura Town, the Gifters and samurai there attacked him, Luffy, and a female samurai named Kiku but were overpowered. Holed'em then confronted Luffy with Tama as a hostage as Hawkins and his men headed into Bakura Town to provide backup,[184] but were intercepted by Trafalgar Law. As the Shinuchi Speed arrived at the scene, Luffy managed to overwhelm Holed'em and free Tama,[185] and Tama tamed Speed with her abilities. The Beasts Pirates were left powerless to stop Luffy's group, and Jack was notified about Holed'em's defeat.[186]\n\nJack went to Okobore Town to search for Luffy but got into a fight with Shutenmaru. The battle was interrupted when a drunk Kaidou arrived, looking for Luffy and Law.[187] When Hawkins informed Kaidou that Luffy and Law were hiding in Oden Castle, Kaidou proceeded to destroy the castle ruins. Luffy then came out and attacked Kaidou,[188] but was swiftly defeated by the Emperor.[189] Law attempted to rescue Luffy but was attacked by Hawkins and forced to flee. Luffy was then brought to a prison in Udon.[190]\n\nSome members of the Kyoshiro Family were attacked by Sanji when they tried extorting him, and they contacted Queen,[49] who sent X Drake and Page One to kill him.[83] Page One went on a rampage looking for Sanji, and Sanji confronted him.[191] The two fought, with Sanji utilizing the powers of his Raid Suit,[192] and Sanji eventually escaped unscathed.[193]\n\nOn Onigashima, Kaidou received reports that the Big Mom Pirates were approaching Wano. However, the issue was quickly solved when King flew in and attacked their ship, preventing it from scaling the waterfall.[194]\n\nIn the Prisoner Mine, the vice warden and Shinuchi Dobon attacked Luffy and Eustass Kid for depleting the food storage with the meal tickets they earned through working, but they knocked him out without anyone seeing.[195] Luffy then gave some of his meal tickets to the old prisoner Hyo,[196] but this caused Hyo to be attacked by Vice Warden Daifugo.[197] Luffy attacked Daifugo and was eventually brought before Queen and the warden Babanuki to be punished along with Hyougoro.[198]\n\nQueen decided to punish them by having them fight against numerous members of the Beasts Pirates and put special collars on them that would behead them if they got pushed out of the wrestling ring.[199]\n\nSometime later, the Beasts Pirates found out about Kin'emon's secret message and arrested several of his supporters in the capital.[200]\n\nBack in Udon, Queen was confronted by Big Mom,[201][202] and after a brief fight, he managed to capture her.[203] When taking Big Mom to Onigashima, he unknowingly allowed Luffy to roam free[204][205] and regroup with his allies to take over Udon and recruit the prisoners to fight against the Beasts Pirates.[47] After the warden, Babanuki, was defeated, the Beasts Pirates lost control of Udon. However, in order to hide their movements, Babanuki was fed one of Tama's dango's, instantly making him friendly to the alliance, and happily feeding the Beasts Pirates the wrong information.[206]\n\nAfter Big Mom was brought to Onigashima, Kaidou had them unlock her chains and fought with her.[207] However, the two Emperors eventually decided to form an alliance to take over the world.[208]\n\nIn Ringo, some Beast Pirate Waiters attacked Gyukimaru, due to a personal grudge after having their weapons stolen by the thief. They also planned to take all the weapons Gyukimaru stole but were defeated by Zoro and Kawamatsu, who were also present.[209]\n\nTwo days prior to the Fire Festival, the Beasts Pirates, having received a tip from Orochi, acted on the shoguns orders and destroyed all of Wano's interconnecting bridges, as well as attacking the ships in Itachi Port and the Thousand Sunny.[210]\n\nOn the day of the Festival, three ships were assigned to destroy the Nine Red Scabbards as well as pick up Orochi's spy, Kurozumi Kanjuro. However, having been (unintentionally) fed false information, the Beasts Pirates' actions were shown to be fruitless, when all the alliance members assembled, with the Kid Pirates accompanying them. They held brief hope when Kyoshiro arrived with the Kyoshiro Family; however, it was quickly dashed when he revealed himself to be none other than Denjiro of the Scabbards, who had also freed the prisoners in Rasetsu Town, and brought them as reinforcements for the enemy.[211][212] After the three pirate captains quickly finished of two ships the third one created enough distance to barrage the enemy using super long distance cannons. However, this ship was also sunk thanks to Jinbe, who came to join the Straw Hats.[213] Later, at the fortified Torii, the partying Beasts Pirates stationed there soon found themselves under attack and thoroughly defeated by the Straw Hats.[214]\n\nOn Onigashima, the Beasts Pirates were holding a grand party, celebrating the Fire Festival together with Orochi and his samurai, unaware that they were being infiltrated by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance in Beasts Pirates disguise. Kaidou had the Tobiroppo assemble in order to introduce them to Big Mom, but King had them summoned, using them to find Kaidou's missing son, Yamato, with the reward being the right to challenge the All-Stars for their position.[215][216][217]\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the castle, Luffy and Zoro had revealed themselves (after beating up an enemy for wasting food), followed by Kid and Killer, who attacked Apoo (who was DJing) in rage due to his betrayal. This prompts Queen to order his men to take them down, offering a position in the Tobiroppo if they do, though only the Gifters and Shinuchi were motivated by this. The Beasts Pirates vast numbers ended up separating the four.[30][218]\n\nWhen Kanjuro appeared before Orochi and Kaidou with Kouzuki Momonosuke, revealing news about the alliance, the Beasts Pirates remained relaxed, since besides Luffy, Zoro, Kid and Killer, no other invaders, or their ships, were seen. However, Orochi organized an execution for Momonosuke, both to draw out the enemy, as well as end the Kouzuki line for good, though when he introduced the crucified Momonosuke to the audience and started talking about time travel, most of the pirates did not believe him.[219][220]\n\nBy the Sacred Tree, Sasaki of the Tobiroppo was tricked by Denjiro, and ended up being tied and gagged.[221] Elsewhere, Ulti and Page One, also of the Tobiroppo, stumbled into Luffy, and after a brief scuffle, Ulti managed to grab hold of the Straw Hat captain, but ended up getting briefly knocked out by the person she was searching for, Yamato, who then carried Luffy away.[222][223] The Beasts Pirates then soon lost sight of the two after they had a brief fight.[224]\n\nAt the rear entrance of Kaidou's castle, Kanjuro confronted the Scabbards and Law, who had just reunited with Nekomamushi and Izou. The spy attempted to block their path with several Gifters as back up, but he and the Beasts Pirates ended up losing.[225][226]\n\nBack on the Live Floor, Kaidou intervened with Orochi's execution, where he publicly announced the alliance with the Big Mom Pirates, as well as the New Onigashima Project. When Orochi raised his voice in protest, Kaidou chopped the shoguns head off on the spot, before giving his samurais an ultimatum: join his crew or die.[7] The samurais quickly agreed, and Kaidou decided to continue Momonosuke's execution. However, just as he was about to kill the boy, the Nine Red Scabbards and Izou appeared and attempted to assassinate him, pushing the Governor-General off the balcony,[227] and even successfully drawing blood. It was at this point the disguised Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance members finally revealed themselves, with Luffy publicly announcing that their alliance was here for an all-out war against the Beasts-Big Mom Pirates alliance.[228] During the confusion, Momonosuke is freed and manages to escape with Shinobu and Yamato acting as his escort.[229] This causes King to direct the Beasts Pirates into specifically targeting Momonosuke, knowing that the majority of the enemy is united by the boy's presence, and eliminating him could very well break the enemy.[230]\n\nKaidou then transformed and took the Scabbards and Izou to the top of the Skull Dome to battle, though knowing that Kaidou would need a large open space to fight as a dragon, the enemy had already stationed the Mink Tribe's Guardians and the Musketeer Squad,[231] who all turned into Sulong. However, Kaidou also gained backup, with Jack, Nangi of the Numbers and a large group of Beasts Pirates.[232] In the end, all but Jack were defeated, and it took the transformed Inuarashi and Nekomamushi to take him down.[233][234] It finally came down to the Scabbards and Kaidou, with the Scabbards managing to inflict several wounds on the dragon.[235]\n\nMeanwhile, within the castle, the Beasts Pirates targeted the Straw Hats who have gathered on the Live Performance stage. The Beasts Pirates attempt to surround them, even using three of the Numbers, Jaki, Goki and Juki, to do so, though Jaki was quickly defeated by Franky.[236] Close by, X Drake was exposed as a traitor and was beaten by Who's-Who of the Tobiroppo, Queen and Hawkins. However, thanks to an explosion from the neighboring room, Drake managed to escape, and used this opportunity to defeat Juki, just as Luffy uses Gear 4 to defeat Goki, while at the same time offering to join the Straw Hat's side.[237]\n\nQueen then adds to the chaos by indiscriminately firing Excite Bullets of Ice Oni into the battlefield, before giving Apoo the antidote, causing everyone, including fellow Beasts Pirate members, to target him.[69][238] Apoo was eventually defeated, and the antidote was entrusted to Chopper, who promised to give some to everyone including the Beasts Pirates, once he produced enough of it.[239] Yet Queen ordered his lackeys to attack Chopper, as well as the one suppressing their disease with his ability, Marco, which left many of the Beasts Pirates conflicted, though some still acted on his order.[240][241]\n\nMeanwhile, Ulti and Page One were lured away by Nami and Usopp,[242] and later Tama;[243] Sasaki, who was inadvertently freed earlier thanks to an attack from Big Mom, faced Franky after failing to eliminate Momonosuke due to Hatcha and Yamato;[244][245][246] Sanji was captured and surrounded by Black Maria and her subordinates;[247][248] while Jinbe confronted Who's-Who.[249]\n\nBack outside, Kaidou transformed back into his human form and defeated the Red Scabbards and Izou. He then used his Flame Clouds to levitate the entire island of Onigashima, with the intent of dropping it onto the Kouzuki's castle in the Flower Capital. He is joined by Big Mom, and they discussed capturing Nico Robin in order to find the One Piece.[250][251]\n\nThe two Emperors were soon confronted by Luffy, Zoro, Law, Kid and Killer. With the battle starting just as soon as the Scabbards and Izou were teleported downstairs by Law.[252] The younger pirates all showed some ability to damage the Emperors, whether it be the internal damage caused by Law's Ope Ope no Mi or Killer's Punishers; the crushing ability of Kid's Jiki Jiki no Mi ability; the latent Haki of Oden in Zoro's Enma, or Luffy's newfound proficiency in advanced Busoshoku Haki.[253]\n\nMeanwhile, amidst the battle, the situation was gradually, yet unknowingly changing. Tama's new subordinates, Speed, Gazelleman and Daifugo, who escorted her to the island, were spreading her kibi dangos amongst the Gifters. Nami and Usopp were also using the dangos on the Gifters and using them to impede the Tobiroppo pursuing them, as well as support Franky, who was being cornered by Sasaki and his subordinates.[254]\n\nIn the Banquet Hall, Sanji, having defeated Black Maria's male subordinates, was finally captured thanks spider-woman's abilities and female subordinates, whom Sanji refused to hurt. He was then threatened to call for Robin via the Mary, Caimanlady, in order to capture her. At this point though, a cyborg Mary discovered the injured Red Scabbards and informed King that someone was trying to help them. King requested someone else to go as his hands were full dealing with Marco, with Black Maria volunteering.[255] Black Maria started beating up Sanji in order to force him to call for Robin, but it was unnecessary as Sanji willingly did so, much to the shock of the ladies, who thought that Sanji would be defiant to the end. Just as Black Maria was about to recommence beating up Sanji, Robin appeared and knocked her away, while Brook, who accompanied her, froze all of Maria's webbing. With Sanji freed, he headed towards the Scabbards, at the same time as a recovering Jack, who insisted on ending the samurais himself, leaving Black Maria to deal with Robin and Brook.[256]\n\nElsewhere, Bao Huang and her Marys managed to find Yamato and Momonosuke, and broadcasted their location throughout the castle. Meanwhile,Big Mom's eldest son Perospero having just arrived on the island and defeating the two Mink women, headed indoors, as he witnessed Marco holding back King and Queen all by himself, and decided to support his new allies.\n\nOn the Live Floor, the Beasts Pirates, and their new samurai recruits persistently attempted to reach Chopper, but were forced back by the alliance, predominantly X Drake and Hyougoro, who, by a side effect of the Ice Oni virus, had regained his form and strength of his prime. However, due to the phoenix flames burning up their physical stamina in order to keep them from turning, the situation for the alliance side started to degrade, with Hyougoro even preparing to commit suicide before he turned into an Oni.[257] Everyone started to fall into despair, including the Beasts Pirates Waiters and Pleasures, when Queen revealed that the Ice Oni virus was intended to be used on them as they have lost their value with the loss of SMILEs. Queen attempted to further decrease the enemies' morale whilst further motivating his own troops motivation by insisting that the 'Tanuki' was going to abandon them. Unfortunately for him, Chopper came through, firing the Chopperphage Nebulizer into the battlefield, which cured every one of the virus. Queen then fired at Chopper when the Cotton Candy Lover lectured him on how weaponizing viruses would inevitably lead to them losing control over it. At this point, having felt betrayed at the fact that they were to be treated as expendables, the Pleasures put their bodies on the line to protect Chopper. Marco then restrained Queen, allowing Chopper, who used Monster Point, to hit the Brachiosaurus.[258] Due to Queen's actions, 4,000 Beasts Pirates, consisting of Waiters and Pleasures, revolted and joined the Alliance's side.[122]\n\nJack soon came across the Scabbards, who had somewhat recovered from their battle against Kaidou and were racing to Momonosuke's aid. Inuarashi volunteered to stay behind in order to fight the injured All-Star.[259]\n\nOn the rooftop, it soon became apparent that as long as they fought both Emperors together, it would be impossible to beat either. The Worst Generation managed to pull off a strategy to split them, luring Big Mom indoors. Luffy, having been enlightened on the advanced application of Haoshoku Haki during the battle, volunteered to stay behind and fight Kaidou, whilst the others dealt with the enemies within the Skull Dome. However, due to his inexperience in handling Haoshoku, he soon lost. This news is broadcasted across Onigashima by Bao Huang, which greatly affected the Alliance's morale. Kaidou then pursued Momonosuke, easily defeating Kin'emon who attempted to stall him. As Momonosuke fled with Shinobu, he used the Marys to broadcast a message that Luffy transmitted to him, which restored the Alliance's morale. Kaidou eventually cornered the Kouzuki heir, but they escaped to the mainland thanks to Shinobu. He is then challenged by Yamato atop the Skull Dome, which he accepted.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawkins dealt with Killer as Kid and Law looked for Linlin. Big Mom herself had come across Tama, and having learnt from her that Okobore Town, the place that fed her when she was an amnesiac, was destroyed by the Beasts Pirates, she angrily struck down the still pursuing Page One with a single Haoshoku-Infused fist. She also temporarily knocked out Ulti when she harmed Tama, before soon being confronted by Kid, and later Law.\n\nBack at the Live Floor, the battle is going poorly, with Queen basically playing with the Monster Point Chopper, while receiving back up from Perospero, who fired rains of candy arrows upon the enemies. Fortunately for the Alliance, Sanji arrived in the nick of time and took over the fight from Chopper.\n\nUlti soon recovered, and continued her pursuit of Nami, Usopp and more specifically, Tama, having identified her as the reason for the betrayal of the Gifters and Big Mom attacking them. She managed to catch Tama at the stage and attempted to strangle her to death, but due to already having severe internal injuries from Big Mom, was quickly taken down by Usopp and Nami, and her new sentient weapon Zeus. This battle occurred before Bao Huang, who was so surprised, that instead of announcing the original message of how Momonosuke fell off the island, instead blurted out about how Page One and Ulti were both taken out, inadvertently affecting her own sides morale. Usopp then captured her using Midori Boshi: Devil, before having Tama use the Marys to transmit her own voice.\n\nAfter Tama activated her ability, the situation of the war dramatically changed. With around 300 Headliners having consumed her dangos, they had their around 2,000 subordinates join the alliance's side, with their initial betrayal inflicting the Beasts Pirates with 500 additional casualties. With the addition of the Waiters and Pleasures who revolted due to Queen's treatment, the Beasts Pirates numbers dropped to 16,000 from their original 30,000, whilst their enemies have risen from 5,400 to 9,000.\n\nThis advantage grew as Kaidou's strongest executives under the All-Stars, the Tobiroppo, were defeated one-by-one by the Straw Hat Pirates. Thanks to the tamed Gifters stopping interference in their respective duels, Jinbe managed to overwhelm Who's-Who, whilst Franky won against Sasaki. Robin also bested Black Maria whilst Brook subdued the spider-woman's direct subordinates, which included some Numbers. Aside from Drake who defected, this left the All-Stars, with Inuarashi facing Jack, and Sanji opposing Queen while Marco held back King until Zoro stepped in and took over the fight. Both Jack and Perospero are both eventually brought down by Inuarashi and Nekomamushi,[260] leaving only King and Queen for the alliance to fight. Killer also prevails over Basil Hawkins, freeing Kid from his Devil Fruit's power to make his fight with Big Mom easier.[261] Queen is eventually defeated by Sanji after he uses his newly created Ifrit Jambe, acquired after his dormant genetic modifications woke during his fight with him, to launch him off Onigashima, and King is defeated after being struck by a powerful blow from Zoro, who had mastered the legendary sword Enma and learned to utilize his Haoshoku Haki, also falling off the island.[262]\n\nEventually, Luffy returned to Onigashima after being rescued and resuscitated by the Heart Pirates and riding a physically aged Momonosuke and briefly attacked Kaidou in Gear 4 alongside Yamato before sending him and Momonosuke to stop Onigashima. Once their rematch began, Luffy demonstrated that his control over Haoshoku Haki had improved to the point that he and Kaidou's clash could split the heavens like the other Emperors could. After a while of going all out, Kaidou came to admit to Luffy that he was having a lot of fun, a sentiment he shared. Acknowledging Luffy's strength, Kaidou consumes some alcohol and goes into Shuron Hakke mode, making his attacks dangerously unpredictable, but Luffy is still able to get a good hit on him.\n\nAfter Big Mom is defeated by Kid and Law, Luffy goes into what he called his last Gear 4 to defeat Kaidou, and though he manages to hurt Kaidou, the interference from CP0 causes Kaidou to once again defeat Luffy, which he despairs over as it reminded him of how he won in a manner similar to his fight with Oden, causing him to take down the agent. Still, he returned to the castle below in his dragon form declaring that Luffy was dead, but he was still willing to fight anyone left standing. This didn't last long as Luffy recovers after he awakens his Devil Fruit and drags Kaidou back up to the roof, where the two have their final match.\n\nWith his awakened powers, Luffy is able to bypass Kaidou's hard skin by turning it into rubber, allowing him to hurt him on a deeper (and more comical) level. As a result, Kaidou starts to reach his limit, but he is still able to hurt Luffy as according to him, Haki is the one true instrument needed to conquer the seas. After he knocks Luffy up into the air, Luffy grabs Kaidou and enlarges his fist to a humongous degree, intent to finish Kaidou off. In return, Kaidou changes into his dragon form and envelopes himself in fire hot enough to melt Onigashima's other horn and creates a large dragon resembling himself and large enough to match Luffy's fist. Both of their final attacks clash with each other but despite the struggle, Luffy's fist pierces through Kaidou's dragon and hits him in the face hard enough to send him hurling down to the surface and down into Wano's magma chamber, which caused an underwater eruption to occur where Onigashima previously sat, finally defeating the King of Beasts.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nKaidou's defeat marked the end of the New Onigashima Project, as the island was forced to be dropped near the Flower Capital instead of on top. His defeat was announced across the island, though several Beasts Pirates refused to believe Kaidou could be defeated and tried to continue fighting, only to be stopped by Yamato, ending the Beasts Pirates' reign over Wano for good. The surviving remnants were later defeated in Udon by Admiral Ryokugyu, who requests a warship most likely to arrest everyone. Also, Kaidou's defeat was revealed all over the outside world, resulting in his status as an Emperor being stripped, which also seems to destroy the authority and reputation of the Beasts Pirates as a formidable crew.\n\nTranslation and Dub Issues[]\n\nThe crew's name, Hyakujū Kaizokudan (百獣海賊団?), literally translates to something along the lines of \"Many Beasts Pirates\", \"All Beasts Pirates\", or \"Hundreds of Beasts Pirates\".\n\nThe term \"Hyakuju\", meaning many or all kinds of beasts, is a compound word that combines the characters for Hundred (百, Hyaku?) and Beast (獣, Jū?). It is seldom used and most often found within the Japanese idiom Hyakujū no Ō (百獣の王?), or \"King of Beasts\" in English, consequently causing confusion amongst One Piece translators on how to render the term.\n\nAdditionally, VIZ decided to take the translation into a whole new direction by opting to use the title \"Animal Kingdom Pirates\". According to Stephen Paul, the translator of One Piece for VIZ, \"Animal Kingdom came from 'Hyaku-juu' which literally is the kanji for \"hundred\" and \"animal\" but it actually means 'all manner of beast/animal.' A common use of that is 'hyaku-juu no ou' which is 'king of the beasts' aka Lion. Kaidou's title is 'Hyaku-juu no Kaidou' so, given the implication, and the reference to him as the strongest creature alive, I called him 'Kaido, King of the Beasts.' As an analogue I decided to go with Animal Kingdom for his crew, since it's implied that he rules over them, and they obviously have a wide variety of animal-powers in the Gifters.\"[263]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe crew seems to have a playing card theme, with the All-Stars being named after playing card ranks, the Numbers being the pip cards, and the Shinuchi (save those from the Worst Generation) being named after card games, as well as Scotch. They share this theme with one of their former allies, the Donquixote Pirates.\n\nThe crew's card motif bears resemblance to (and was possibly inspired by) KING, a gang from Fist of the North Star.\n\nIn addition, Queen bears a resemblance to Heart, a minor antagonist and member of KING.\n\nIn keeping with the crew’s association with Wano Country, a country inspired by Feudal Japan, many senior positions within the crew take their names from traditional Japanese performing arts or types of theatre.\n\nAll-Stars take their name from the word Ōkanban (大看板?, lit. \"large signboard\"), which has come to denote a first-rate influential performer or leading star of theatre/film, due to the custom of writing such a person’s name larger than those of other performers on billboards and other signage.\n\nThe All-Star's Road To Laugh Tale entry revealed design concepts for them, including that they were originally supposed to be called \"The Face Cards\", due to their names.\n\nShinuchi is derived from Shin'uchi (真打?, lit. “true hit”), a term used to describe a person of the highest ability or popularity in Rakugo, a traditional Japanese solo performing art.\n\nThe strongest of the Shinuchi, the Tobiroppo, are named after a form of dramatic exit in Kabuki called Roppō (六方?, lit. \"six directions\") that involves exaggerated movements of the performer's hands and feet towards north, west, south and east, as well as up and down. Tobi roppō (飛び六方?, lit. \"flying six directions\") is a particularly famous variation from the play \"Kanjinchō\" performed by one of the lead characters, the warrior Benkei.\n\nThe Beasts Pirates currently have the highest number of known Devil Fruit users of any pirate crew currently due to many of their members having eaten SMILEs.\n\nThey have the largest number of Zoan fruit users in a single organization, with 9 natural Devil Fruit users (11 if the traitorous X Drake and rebellious Yamato are included), plus over 500 Gifters.\n\nThey have all the Zoan sub-classes (Ancient, Mythical, and Artificial) in their organization, but appear to lack the standard Zoan type.\n\nGiven the total number of Beasts Pirates members, the current number of Gifters and the success rate of the SMILE, it can be surmised that the number of Pleasures in their crew is around 4,500 while the Waiters is 15,000.\n\nSo far, there has not been any named member of the Pleasures.\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nBeasts Pirates\n\nGovernor-General:\n\nKaidou (Unknown status)?\n\nAll-Stars:Tobiroppo:Shinuchi:\n\nSheepshead (Unknown status)?\n\nGinrummy (Unknown status)?\n\nBasil Hawkins (Unknown status)?\n\nHoled'em\n\nSpeed (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nDobon\n\nBabanuki (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nDaifugo (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nSolitaire\n\nBao Huang\n\nBriscola (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nFourtricks (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nHamlet (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nMizerka (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nPoker (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nGifters:Waiters:Numbers:Ninja & Samurai:Other Members:\n\nYamato (Former)‡\n\nScotch (Unknown status)?\n\nScratchmen Apoo\n\nHihimaru (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nKamijiro\n\nGorishiro (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nSubordinate Crews:Allies and Affiliates:Ships:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Weapons Based:Support Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Cover Stories:Locations:Songs:Others:\n\nCurrent Members:Former Members:\n\nEdward Newgate (Deceased)†\n\nCharlotte Linlin (Unknown status)?\n\nKaidou (Unknown status)?\n\nGroups:Primary Ships:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Weapon Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesLocations:Events:Story Arcs:Cover Stories:Others:\n\nCitizensFlower Capital:Kuri:Ringo:Onigashima:Others:Beasts Pirates:Yo (Non-Canon)≠:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Weapons:\n\nGroupsFamilies:Administration:Other:\n\nLocationsRegions:Others:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Cover Stories:Events:Others:\n\nStaff:Prisoners (Former: All Escaped)‡:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Support:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Others:\n\nEmperors:Brokers:\n\nJoker (Former)‡\n\nTamago\n\nPekoms (Unknown status)?\n\nPurchasers:Mercenaries:Intermediate Providers:Mafia:Yakuza:Organ Traders:\n\nJigra (Deceased)†\n\nGum (Non-Canon)≠\n\n150 (Non-Canon)≠\n\nOpera (Non-Canon)≠\n\nWolf (Non-Canon)≠\n\nOther Associates:\n\nSmugglingGoods:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Weapon Based:Fighting Style Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Locations:Associated Groups/Crews:Other:\n\nMaster:\n\nCaesar Clown (Former)‡\n\nAffiliates:Subordinates:Gigantification Research:Vehicles:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arc:Substances:Others:\n\nFour BluesEast Blue:West Blue:North Blue:South Blue:\n\nGrand LineParadise:New World:Calm Belt:\n\nFormerDisbanded:Arrested:Absorbed:Destroyed:\n\nOthersOrigin Unknown:Pretend Groups:\n\nNon-CanonAnime:Movies, Specials\n\n& OVAs:Video Games:Premier Shows:Other:\n\nCrew:\n\nX Drake (Unknown status)?\n\nShip:Allies and Affiliates:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit:Weapon Based:Fighting Style Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Cover Stories:Movies:Locations:Others:\n\nCrew:Ship:Affiliates:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Movies:Locations:Others:\n\nSMILE Users\n\nSuccessful:Failures:\n\nRelated ArticlesOrganizations:\n\nBeasts Pirates\n\nKid Pirates\n\nNinja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance\n\nLocations:Related:"
