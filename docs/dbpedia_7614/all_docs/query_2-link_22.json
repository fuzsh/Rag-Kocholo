        "text": "You don't know Maurice Chevalier\n\nuntil you have seen Paramount’s “The\n\nSmiling Lieutenant,\" with Maurice's\n\ngay love-making, Ills delicious comedy\n\nsinging raising a riot of laughs and\n\ntender emotion in the eves and hearts\n\nof his audience.\n\n\"The Smiling Lieutenant\" hns the\n\nwhole of Maurice Chevalier hound up\n\nin a single joyous role. His capti\n\nvating personality, his sly and wicked\n\nlove-making, his meaningful singing of\n\nthe meaningful lyrics, all these tilings,\n\nwhich each of his pictures to now have\n\npresented in part, are projected at full\n\nforce from the screen in “The Smiling\n\nLieutenant.\"\n\nThe picture is another of those de\n\nlicious Lubitsch productions, but. un\n\nlike “The Love Parade,\" it is a real,\n\ndown-to-earth comedy romance deal\n\nin;; with a smart and carefree sol\n\ndier whose smile wins him the heart\n\nof two women, it has delightful com\n\nedy moments. Claudette Colbert and\n\nMiriam Hopkins are the sweethearts\n\nwho turn Chevalier's head and heart.\n\nCharlie Haggles' characterisation is\n\nan asset to the picture which, in less\n\nbrilliant circumstances, would make\n\na shew all its own.\n\nHut. perhaps the outstanding feature\n\nof the show are Chevalier’s songs, |\n\nwhich, put across in Chevalier's i\n\nown inimitable style, send the audi-j\n\nonce out lilting and humming! \"One\n\nMore Hour to Love.\" \"Jazz Up Your\n\nLingerie” and \"While Hearts are\n\nHinging\" are tuneful lyrics which are\n\nrecalled and recalled with a smile.\n\nAnd yet \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" is\n\nnot a musical show in any sense. The\n\nsongs are Chevalier’s; they fit natur\n\nally into the story and pep up the\n\naction.\n\nThe production comes to the Prince\n\nRegent Theatre neM Saturday night."
