        "text": "MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (WXIX) - Hundreds of people came out to a Middletown cemetery to honor a World War II soldier whose remains were recently identified.\n\nIn a sea of red, white, and blue, around 200 people attended the service for Middletown native U.S. Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Dan W. Corson at Woodside Cemetery on Wednesday.\n\nThe remains of Corson, who was 27 when he died, were accounted for on Sept. 22, 2023, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA).\n\nCorson was assigned to the 401st Bombardment Squadron, 91st Bombardment Group (Heavy), Eighth Air Force in December 1942, the DPAA explained.\n\nThe 27-year-old from Middletown was co-piloting a B-17F “Flying Fortress,” nicknamed Danellen, on Dec. 20, 1942, when the DPAA says the aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire following a bombing raid on German aircraft factory at Romilly-sur-Seine, France.\n\nNine airmen were in the Danellen, but only one managed to parachute out before the aircraft crashed near the village of Bernières-sur-Seine, France, according to the DPAA.\n\nA year after the crash, on Dec. 20, 1943, the DPAA says the War Department issued a finding of death for 1st Lt. Corson.\n\nIn 1946, the American Graves Registration Command (AGRC) was given the task of recovering missing American personnel in the European Theater, the DPAA explains.\n\nFour sets of remains were unable to be identified following the end of WWII, and they were interred at the Normandy American Cemetery.\n\nA family member of one of the Danellen crewmembers contacted the Department of Defense in 2011 after they visited the crash site in France. There, the DPAA says the family member talked with a witness who had artifacts belonging to the Danellen.\n\nAfter seeing the evidence, the DPAA Investigation team went to Bernières-sur-Seine themselves.\n\nInvestigators talked with the same witness, learning the crash site was now destroyed.\n\nEight years later, in March 2019, the unidentified remains were exhumed from Normandy American Cemetery.\n\nScientists were finally able to identify Corson’s remains, the DPAA said.\n\nCorson’s name is recorded on the memorialized on the Wall of the Missing at Cambridge American Cemetery, an American Battle Monuments Commission site in Cambridge, England, along with others still missing from WWII. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nMore than 73,000 American soldiers remain unaccounted for from WWII, according to the Soldiers Walk.\n\nFive service members associated with Corson are among the unaccounted-for, DPAA data shows.\n\nThe unaccounted-for include:\n\nStaff Sergeant Jackson M. Barbour\n\nFirst Lieutenant Bruce H. Brown\n\nTechnical Sergeant Edwin D. Byrdic\n\nFirst Lieutenant Reeves S. Carper\n\nFirst Lieutenant Mark B. Connor\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Please click here to report it.\n\nDo you have a photo or video of a breaking news story? Send it to us herewith a brief description."
