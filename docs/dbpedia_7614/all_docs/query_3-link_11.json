        "text": "Before you read this A+ essay by one of LSG's tutors, Risini, make sure you've read our Extinction blog post covering themes, characters, and more!\n\nIn a play that tackles issues ranging from conservation to human indulgence and morality it can be difficult to write a well-structured and detailed response to what usually seems like an existential topic (just like the one below). And not to mention the challenge of including all four characters in your essay without the stale character-based approach. So, below is an example of a high scoring essay with tips on how you can elevate the quality of your response to get those extra points!\n\nIn this essay, you'll see Risini has offered annotations throughout her essay to show you her thinking. If you find this helpful, then you might want to check out our Extinction: A Killer Text Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays (written by a 50 study scorer!) with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals! Let's get started.\n\nRaysonâs play is about our propensity as humans to make questionable decisions despite our moral convictions.Â\n\nIntroduction\n\nMankindâs ambition to improve and develop as human beings distinguishes themselves from their bestial, primal instincts (1). However, Hannie Raysonâs play Extinction, explores the complexities threaded throughout the human condition that propel individuals towards the ethically ambiguous (2). Rayson examines the the insecurities peppering the contemporary lifestyle, that threaten the integrity of our outward ideologies (3). Similarly, Rayson explores our indelible connection with nature that leads individuals to pursue baser impulses. Ultimately however, Rayson captures the strength of the human capacity to align our moral convictions with our judgements (4).Â\n\n*Annotations\n\n(1) This play tackles humanity and its flaws, so beginning with a broad, conceptual sentence is a good way to ease into discussion.\n\n(2) Addressing topic.\n\n(3) Agreeing with the topic.\n\n(4) Challenging the topic. Indicating Raysonâs play isnât only about questionable decision making, it is also about peopleâs ability to make the morally right decisions.\n\nParagraph 1\n\nIn spite of peopleâs outward conformity to their moral values, Rayson captures the power of human insecurities to compromise their values (5). It is the birth of moral dilemmas from such insecurities, that prompts questionable decision-making (6). Dixon-Brown, who exercises a pragmatic ideology as fortified by her Dixon-Brown Index and classifies the tiger quolls as âfunctionally extinctâ, leaves her insecure and longing for meaningful connection and companionship (7). Indisputably, Harry Jewellâs charming exterior and sensitivity offers to fill Dixon-Brownâs emotional chasm, but also offers a moral dilemma for Dixon-Brown: to fill this chasm, or uphold her professional integrity. Dixon-Brownâs pursuit of âillicit professional compromiseâ with Harry, as a result of her moral dilemma, distorts her moral stance, now considering tiger quolls as simply âhard to findâ and âshyâ. Rayson (8) challenges the integrity of peopleâs moral values, demonstrating how oneâs emotional hunger can outweigh even their own moral expectations. Like Dixon-Brown, Piper (9) values her relationships, yet is neither immune to hypocrisy. Championing the untiring philosophy that âall species are worth savingâ, Piper recognises humanityâs moral responsibility to offer compassion to life beyond our own species. However, she is devastated by Beastâs (10) prognosis, lamenting âI am not readyâ, despite having previously baulked at âTwinkieâs pacerâ (11). Rayson undermines Piperâs outward altruism, challenging whether it merely cloaks a selfish desire to appease her own insecurities of losing her loved ones. Regardless of our moral convictions, Rayson explores the insecurities formed from our fears of loneliness that compel individuals to compromise their moral ideals.Â\n\n*Annotations\n\n(5) Notice how I discuss many themes in Extinction, beyond morality and decision-making. From understanding and reasoning with characters, I also explore companionship, belonging, isolation and hypocrisy. I avoid introducing character names in the topic sentence, as this can scream âcharacter-based paragraphâ to the examiner.\n\n(6) Immediately addressing views and values of writer. This is more interesting than the conventional approach of presenting evidence, exploring it then diving into values of the writer.\n\n(7) Here, I try to bring Dixon-Brown to life by empathising with her. Compare this with: Dixon-Brownâs pragmatic exterior is undermined when she pursues a romantic affair with Harry Jewell. This sounds more like summary and comes off robotic and unemotional, neither does it add any dimension to her character.\n\n(8) Using the authorâs name when exploring views and values.\n\n(9) Itâs always nice to have a transition sentence between a new piece of evidence, especially in Extinction when a lot of the evidence is character-based.\n\n(10) Use of minor characters.\n\n(11) Minor characters again.\n\nParagraph 2â\n\nRayson explores peopleâs inextricable connection with nature that undermines the purity of our ideology (12). In spite of Harryâs sentimental connection with nature that motivates him to pursue the Quoll Project, reminiscing of his childhood pet âErrol Flynnâ and being a part of a family that made a âliving off the landâ, Rayson explores our darker ties to nature that leads individuals to make questionable decisions (13). Through the symbol of the birds of prey (14) in Harry and Piperâs camp, including the beautiful âbarking owlâ, Rayson alludes to how humans can too manipulate and prey to indulge their baser impulses, leaving aside morals (15). Beyond this, Rayson investigates the universal concept of mortality (16) that is shared by all life forms in nature. Confronting the shadow of mortality, Andyâs stoic faÃ§ade and impenetrable ideology is undermined. He shares his stamp of impermanence with the injured tiger quoll with a âsnapped spinal columnâ, and is likely able to empathise with it (17). Thus, his decision to euthanise the quoll may have been the inadvertent projection of his desire to end his own suffering. Through Piper, who challenges Andy for choosing the âmost convenient optionâ, Rayson illuminates how our ties to nature can compromise our ethics and decisions, reaffirming our propensity towards moral contradictions.Â\n\n*Annotations\n\n(12) In a play concerned with the environment, I try to include peopleâs connection to nature and the environment when I can.\n\n(13) Good to mention topic.\n\n(14) Include the symbols of nature that Rayson weaves into the play and its meaning.\n\n(15) Good to mention topic.\n\n(16) Again, I try to discuss more themes apart from morality and decision-making by including mortality. In a play concerning endangered species and measuring the worth of life, try to discuss mortality whenever possible.\n\n(17) Again, I think finding similarities between the lives of animals and humans is crucial in this play, rather than considering them as two separate entities.\n\nParagraph 3\n\nUltimately, Rayson captures how humanityâs moral convictions can in fact align with their decisions when decisions are founded through virtuous ideals. Despite oscillating moral values that threaten the balance of Andy and Piperâs relationship (18), their shared morality of compassion and sacrifice reunite them at the playâs denouement. Andyâs willingness to sacrifice their relationship in order to not âwaste her lifeâ and Piperâs refusal to leave Andy side despite a future that âjust leads to sadnessâ illustrates the human capacity to reconcile their differences when their moral values align with their future ambition. Rayson echoes this capacity for reconciliation through the setting (19) of the animal shelter in the play; a setting representing preservation and hope. Although the play begins with a âwet and windy nightâ in the animal shelter, intensifying the arguing and frustration (20), Rayson closes with the âgleamâ and âtwitchâ of the tiger quoll in the same setting. This realises humanityâs capability making moral decisions through their virtuous ideals; striving to preserve and protect oneâs relationships and natural habitat. As well as the possibility of a live tiger quoll who offers hope for their natural environment, Andy and Piper, who believe in loyalty and resilience, offer hope in a world permeated by moral contradiction.Â\n\n*Annotations\n\n(18) I challenge the topic but still acknowledge my previous agreement with the topic.\n\n(19) Use of metalanguage. Here Iâve explored a more natural setting, however Rayson often transitions between the city scape at Dixon-Brownâs apartment where the ânoise of the city and peak-hour traffic rumbles belowâ and the natural landscape, âa wildlife rescue centre tucked away in the Cape Otway rainforestâ. It can be effective to notice the contrast between the two and the events that occur in each setting.\n\n(20) If analysing setting: Explore the effect of the setting on the mood of scene or characters. Then explore its significance to the views and values of the author.\n\nConclusion\n\nRaysonâs (21) Extinction explores humankindâs moral frailty and gravitation towards the ethical when we focus too closely on ourselves. Rayson examines the insecurities woven throughout the human condition and our inextricable ties to nature that threaten our moral foundations, both prompting individuals to consider themselves over their relationships and duties to the environment. However, Rayson ultimately captures the resilience of mankind to unite despite their flaws, offering hope for the future of our environment and species.Â\n\n*Annotations\n\n(21) Finish with a reflection of the bigger picture and overarching values the author promotes or condemns.\n\nAt first glance, Extinction may just seem like a short story of a chaotic quartet, but there are so many hearty themes to unpack and discuss. After a few re-reads, you will discover some unique finds, and after a few essays, you will find overlaps and patterns in seemingly philosophical topics.\n\nFor more sample essay topics, head over here so you can start practising some of the tips you've learnt in this blog!

Happy writing!\n\nExtra Resources\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Responseâ\n\nExtinction by Hannie Raysonâ\n\nExtinction Text Guide Study Guide\n\nThe Erratics is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSetting is a literary element that refers to the context of where a story takes place, usually alluding to the time and location. Your expectations of a story that takes place in Victorian England would differ greatly from a story set in late 2000s Australia, showing us that the historical, social and geographical aspects of the setting shape the meaning of the text.\n\nIn the memoir The Erratics, the setting plays a vital role in Vicki Laveau-Harvie's storytelling. From the beginning of the novel, Laveau-Harvie uses both the title and prologue to foreground the importance of the Okotoks Erratic (a geographical phenomenon in Alberta, Canada) to establish the role that place and belonging have played in her life. Further reinforcing the importance of the setting, the memoirâs narrative follows Laveau-Harvieâs experience flying back to Alberta, Canada (her hometown), after having moved to and started a new life in Australia.Â\n\nWhy Focus on Setting When Writing a Text Response?\n\nThe setting can be useful evidence to have in your repertoire as it helps you show that you not only have an understanding of the ideas of the text but also how those ideas are constructed. When looking at the criteria you will be marked against in the end-of-year exam you will see that to score a 7 and above in Section A you need to consider the âconstructionâ of the text (read more here). Construction refers to your ability to discuss the parts that make up a text through the use of metalanguage as evidence to support your views. The setting is just one of the ways you can address construction in The Erratics, but, as a text so focused on physical environments, itâs a good type of metalanguage to start with.\n\nCanada\n\nFamous for producing Justin Bieber and maple syrup, Canada has a similar history to Australia. Canada has an Indigenous population who inhabited the land for thousands of years before British and French expeditions came and colonised the land. In the 1700s, due to various conflicts, France ceded most of its North American colonies while the United Kingdom stayed. Over time the country gained greater autonomy and, like Australia, it is now a constitutional monarchy with a prime minister but recognises the British royal family as its sovereign. Further mirroring Australia, Canada also has a colonial past that it is still reckoning with as recent headlines about the human remains of hundreds of Indigenous people at a residential school reminds us.Â\n\nVicki is specifically from Alberta, and the majority of the novel is about her experiences returning there after having moved to Australia (at the start of the memoir she had been estranged from her parents for 18 years). Known for its natural beauty and its nature reserves, Alberta is a part of Western Canada. Alberta is one of only two landlocked provinces in Canada which is interesting considering that Vicki leaves it for a country famous for its beaches and coastal cities.Â\n\nWhen annotating the text, highlight the descriptions of the setting. Youâll notice that whenÂ Laveau-Harvie describes Alberta or Canada as a whole she presents the country as being dangerous and hostile. An example of this is the blunt statement that the âcold will kill you. Nothing personalâ. However, Laveau-Harvie does find some solace in the landscape, observing the beauty of the âopalescentâ peaks and the comfort in predictable seasons.Â\n\nVickiâs Parentâs Home\n\nThe first description Laveau-Harvie gives us of her family home is to call it âParadise, [with] twenty acres with a ranch house on a rise, nothing between you and the sky and the distant mountains.â The idyllic image foregrounds the natural landscape but is then immediately juxtaposed with the description of the home as a âtime-capsule house sealed against the outside world for a decadeâ. This description heightens Vickiâs mother and fatherâs isolation from the outside world and alludes to the hostility of the home that is reaffirmed with the doors that âopen to no oneâ. The family home becomes an extended metaphor for Vickiâs parents themselves, with the description of it as a âno-go zoneâ, hinting at the sistersâ estrangement from their parents who have shut them out.Â\n\nMoreover, the land the house sits on does not produce any crops despite it being such a large expanse of land, heightening the homeâs disconnect from the natural world. This detachment from the natural world is furthered by her labelling her parents as âtransplants from the cityâ and contrasting them to locals who âstill make preserves in the summerâ. Vickiâs mother in particular is at odds with nature due to materialism, such as her wardrobes being full of fur coats.\n\nThe Erratics + Napi\n\nIn the prologue we are introduced to the Okotoks Erratic as being situated in âa landscape of uncommon beautyâ with the Erratic itself being something that âdominates the landscape, roped off and isolated, the danger it presents to anyone trespassing palpableâ. The memoir then immediately shifts to Vickiâs experience in the hospital trying to convince the staff that she is her motherâs daughter, drawing a parallel between the dominating and dangerous landscape to the dominating and dangerous mother. In the memoir, the Erratic is an extended metaphor for the mother with both the land and the mother being described as âunsafeâ, âdominat[ing]â and a âdangerâ. Moreover, the structural choice of opening the novel with the Erratic makes its presence felt throughout the novel even though it is not mentioned again until the end of the text.Â\n\nIn contrast to the prologue, the epilogue has a feeling of peace and reconciliation as the mother and what she has represented to her family is reconciled with the landscape. This is particularly pertinent as the geographical and spiritual origins of the rock revealed in the epilogue is a story of stability after a rupture. This alludes to the ability of Vickiâs family to heal after the trauma inflicted on them by the mother. The epilogue could also be understood as a reminder of humanity's insignificance in the face of nature and larger forces, as represented by Napi.\n\nWhile Laveau-Harvie does not directly address Canada's colonial past in her memoir outside of the inclusion of Napi, the colonial presence is felt throughout the memoir through the setting of both Australia and Canada. These settings allude to how living on stolen land means that while individuals - particularly middle-class, white individuals - may not always recognise and address the colonial history of the land they live on, the fact that land was never ceded is still felt.Â\n\nAustralia\n\nAs discussed before, Canada and Australia are similar as they are both former British colonies that are now constitutional monarchies, so why would Vicki want to move to a place that is similar to where she already lived and experienced trauma?Â\n\nThere are a few potential answers, the first being the geographical distance. There are over 1300kms between Sydney and Alberta and, considering the trauma Vicki and her sister have experienced, it stands to reason that she would want to put distance between her childhood home and her adult life. This leads to the second reason, travelling to âFar flung placesâ as a method to deal with trauma. While in Canada, Vicki reminisces about the âboozed-up Brits on Bondiâ that embodies her life in Australia. The evocative, alliterative image creates a stark contrast between warm and carefree Australia and cold and emotionally taxing Canada, reinforcing how travelling provides individuals with a means to survive their traumatic childhoods and create new lives for themselves.Â\n\nWhen writing about setting you do not need to be an expert in geography. As this blog post has shown, to understand Laveau-Harvieâs use of setting in The Erratics you only need to know about two countries, so next time you write a text response, consider using your understanding of setting to show your teacher or examiners that youâve thought about the textâs construction.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into this text, Zac breaks down key themes and quotes in The Erratics over on this blog.\n\nWeâve explored historical context, themes, essay planning and essay topics over on our Like a House on Fire by Cate Kennedy blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys, welcome back to Lisa's Study Guides. So this week I have another essay topic breakdown for you. So eventually I'm going to get through all of the VCAA texts that are on the study design, but we're slowly going to get there and are just want to say yet again, even though this one is like a house on fire, I am really glad if you've clicked on this video and you're not necessarily studying it because as always with all my videos, I try to give you an overall message for you to take away that can be applied to any single text. So that is the same for this particular text today. And so even though the takeaway message for this video is quite specific to short stories, it's still an important consideration for any text that you're studying. Ideally, you want to use a diverse range of evidence for any text, but in particular, for short stories, you don't just want to rely on a small handful, but to try and make links between the different short stories.\n\nSo let's see what that means on the other side of this quick overview of the text. Like a House on Fire is a collection of short stories by the author, Cate Kennedy, and unlike a lot of other texts on the study design, this book portrays a lot of very domestic situations, which seems fairly boring compared to some of the other texts that other students might be doing. However, I'm really excited about this text because the short stories are great. Not because they have groundbreaking premises, which they don't, but because of how effortlessly and deeply emotive they are. So the domestic scenarios actually help us relate to the characters in the stories and empathize with the complexity of their experiences. The essay topic we'll be looking at today is in Like a House on Fire, Kennedy finds strength in ordinary people. Discuss.\n\nHere, the term which you really have to think about is strength. We already know that she depicts the story of ordinary people, of people like you or me, or even just people we may know, but does she find strength in them? It could be physical strength, but more often than not, it might be other types of strength. For instance, the mental strength it takes to cope with intense pressure or the emotional strength it takes to make a difficult choice or action. It's important to think about how they might actually apply throughout the book. In this sense, our essay will have essentially two halves.\n\nThe first two body paragraphs we'll look at scenarios of intense pressure, be it through the loss of control in one's life or a domestic situation which has become emotionally tense. The last two body paragraphs will then consider the types of strength that Kennedy evinces in these stories. And we'll contend that she does find strength in the characters who face a difficult decision, but that she also finds a lot more strength in the characters who managed to cope with their situation and grapple with the tensions in their lives.\n\nParagraph one\n\nIn many of her stories, Kennedy portrays characters who experience powerlessness. This loss of power can come a number of ways. For instance, both Flexion and Like a House on Fire tell the story of men who have injured their previously reliable bodies and have thus been rendered immobile. But they also tell the story of their respective wives who have lost some control over their lives now that they have to care for their husbands. On the other hand, there are the kids in Whirlpool whose mother insists that they dress a certain way for a Christmas photo. Her hand on your shoulders, exerting pressure that pushes you down. Kennedy's use of second person really makes you feel this pressure that keeps you from going out to the pool you so desperately desire to be in. Evidently powerlessness is an experience that comes in many shapes and forms in several stories.\n\nParagraph two\n\nIn addition to this, Kennedy explores other emotional tensions across the collection, subverting the idea that the home is necessarily a safe sanctuary. This is where she really goes beyond just the idea of powerlessness, but actually jumps into scenarios that are much more emotionally complex. In Ashes for instance, we see the homosexual protagonist struggle with feeling useless and tongue tied, embarrassed by the floundering pause between his mother and himself. There is a significant emotional hurdle there, which is particularly poignant given that mothers are usually considered a source of safety and comfort for their children. Kennedy's story of domesticity actually subvert or question what we might think of the domestic space shared by family members. If you have the Scribe edition of the book, the artwork on the cover would depict a vase of wilting flowers, an empty picture frame, and a spilt cup of coffee.\n\nThese are all visual symbols of an imperfect domestic life. A similar rift exists between husband and wife in both Five Dollar Family and Waiting, the women find themselves unable to emotionally depend on their partners. While Michelle in Five Dollar Family despises her husbands startled, faintly incredulous expression, an inability to care for their child, the protagonist in Waiting struggles to talk about her miscarriages with her husband who is already worn down as it is. Kennedy takes these household roles of mother, son, husband, wife, and really dives into the complex shades of emotion that lies within these relationships. We realize through her stories that a mother can't always provide comfort to a child and that a husband isn't always the dependable partner that he's supposed to be.\n\nParagraph three\n\nHowever, Kennedy does find strength in some characters who do take a bold or courageous leap in some way. These are really important moments in which she is able to show us the strength that it takes to make these decisions. And she triumphs however small or insignificant that can be achieved.\n\nA moment that really stands out to me is the ending of Laminex and Mirrors, where the protagonist rebelliously smuggles a hospital patient out for a smoke only to have to take him back into his ward through the main entrance and therefore get them both caught. She recounts this experience as the one I remember most clearly from the year I turned 18. The two of us content, just for this perfect moment. And their success resonates with the audience, even though the protagonist would have lost her job and therefore the income she needed for her trip to London, Kennedy demonstrates her strength in choosing compassion for an elderly patient. Even the sister in Whirlpool, who wasn't exactly kind to the protagonist in the beginning, forms an unlikely alliance with her against their mother, sharing a reckless moment and cutting their photo shoot short. Bold leaps such as these are ones that take strength and therefore deserve admiration.\n\nParagraph four\n\nHowever, more often than not, Kennedy's stories are more about the strength needed to simply cope with life, one day at a time. She explores the minutiae of her characters lives in a way that conveys the day to day struggles, but also hints at the underlying fortitude needed to deal with these things on a daily basis. In Tender, the wife feels as if everything at home is on the verge of coming apart since her husband is only able to cook tuna and pasta casserole for their kids. However, when she must get a possibly malignant tumor removed, her concern of whether there'll be tuna and pasta in the pantry just in case, demonstrates her selfless nature. Kennedy thus creates a character who is strong for others, even when her own life at home is disorderly and her health may be in jeopardy. The strength of gritting one's teeth and getting on with things in spite of emotional tension is a central idea across this collection, and many other examples are there for you to consider as well.\n\nAnd so we come to the end of our essay. Hopefully going through this gives you an idea of how to cover more bases with your evidence. Remember that you don't have to recount lots and lots of events, but it's more important to engage with what the events are actually telling us about people. This is particularly important for prompts like this one, where it heavily focuses on the people involved. That is it for me this week, please give this video a thumbs up.

Summary\n\nFlames is a bit of an out-there story right from the beginning: Levi is attempting to build a coffin for his sister Charlotte because the women in their family come back to life after dying. Neither of them is that close to dying - both are young adults. Charlotte doesnât really want a coffin so she runs away from home, as far as she can while still remaining in Tasmania at least, and Robbie Arnott takes us on this adventure through interweaving perspectives and rich imagery of his home island.\n\nSome of these perspectives are surprising and unexpected, ranging from a hardcore private investigator to a river god in the form of a water rat, but each of them earns their place in the story. Our job when studying this text is to follow these shifts in perspectives and make sense of how they contribute to the overall text. If youâre writing creatively, you may want to play around with this sort of structure as well in your piece.\n\n2. What Is Magical Realism?\n\nBefore we get stuck into the text itself, it might be useful to first discuss its genre. Magical realism books tend to be extremely confusing if youâre not familiar with the genre (and sometimes even when you are!). This is because authors in this genre will typically set their stories in the real world (in this case, in Tasmania), but theyâll add supernatural elements, which vary wildly from story to story.\n\nLetâs unpack the genre a bit more, in particular, what it involves and why itâs used.\n\nElements of Magical Realism\n\nThe most important element of magical realism is that it blends the real world with fantastical elements. In Flames, the most obvious example is gods: gods donât exist as far as we know, but they walk among humans and play key roles in this text. Less obvious examples of fantastical elements include the wombat farm at Melaleuca (fortunately nobody actually skins wombats) as well as the Oneblood tuna and (unfortunately!) the pet seals.\n\nThe fact that these examples are narrated as perfectly normal is another element of magical realism: the author usually operates as if the fantastical elements are perfectly real. We, as readers, enter a world where the existence of these magical things is taken for granted by the characters.\n\nPurpose of Magical Realism\n\nThis blurring of the lines between real and magical is primarily supposed to suspend our disbelief: we canât really be sure whatâs real about the novelâs world and what isnât. All we know is that in many respects, it looks like our own. Within this familiar setting, Arnott lets his own imagination run wild and leaves the reader to figure out the rest. This helps to create a sense of wonder, as if these elements could be real and as magical as described.\n\nThese elements also contribute to the story in other ways: in particular, they open up new possibilities for commentary. For example, the voice of the South Esk god is used to highlight the impacts of colonialism and the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that was brought with it.\n\nOther Magical Realism Books\n\nIf youâre liking the sound of this genre and/or if you enjoyed Flames, thereâs plenty more to discover in the way of magical realism. Itâs a hallmark of Latin American literature (Isabel Allende, Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez), and itâs also been picked up in Japan by the likes of Haruki Murakami. A prominent Australian example is Carpentaria by Alexis Wright.\n\n3. Themes\n\nDeath and Grief\n\nLetâs move more closely into Flames, starting with its central theme of death and grief. Itâs what defines this central point of tension between Levi and Charlotte throughout the novel, since it starts with their divergent responses to their motherâs death (and reincarnation etc.). Their divergent responses suggest that thereâs no one way to cope with death, and their fatherâs reaction on top of that introduces further complexity: he disappears from their lives altogether, ânot want[ing] to be close to them when they [died]â. Between the three of them, there are three very different expressions of grief.\n\nBut Edith McAllister is not the only death of significance in the novel. Another standout is the passing of Karlâs seal, after which he becomes haunted by âclicksâ; he subsequently leaves tuna-hunting behind. The death of the South Esk god is also explored as causing grief, this time in the form of divine emotional outpouring, âa cloudâs sorrowâ. Arnott is thus exploring many processes of grieving, from solitude and callousness to physical and emotional labour.\n\nFamily Relationships\n\nOutside of these moments of grieving, Arnott explores the background relationships between family members as well. Again, Levi and Charlotte are central to this. As siblings, they donât always see eye to eye: âLevi and I have never understood each otherâ. However, that does not diminish their love for each other, particularly as they were left alone after their motherâs death. Their father Jack again makes this dynamic more complicated: he sees an âunbridgeable gapâ between himself and Levi for example, but the omniscient third-person narrator in that chapter knows otherwise. Consider what difference it makes when Arnott writes in first person from within these relationships (as he does with Charlotte) versus when he writes in third person, observing from outside.\n\nWe also see interesting relationships between Karl and his daughter Nicola. Unlike the McAllisters, the two of them are remarkably close despite his ongoing grief for his seal: ânothing could match the blaze of love in her fatherâs smileâ.\n\nRomantic Relationships\n\nNicola crops up again under this theme, as she begins to navigate a relationship with Charlotte. In a book review for The Guardian, Sam Jordison argues that this is a bit trite, but we can think of it as one perspective on how relationships begin: organically and sincerely, and out of a desire to protect someone else. By contrast, the start of Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on something more artificial and manipulative, a âtiny sparkâ which he ignited in her mind.\n\nThis is bookended with romantic relationships that have come to an end, as explored through the eyes of the private investigator: her and her ex-husband, Graham Malik, have settled into something of an âecosystemâ. With these various beginnings and endings, Arnott shows how it can be natural - or supernatural - to fall in and out of love.\n\nColonisation\n\nFinally, this novel touches on the impacts of colonisation. Itâs a few quiet allusions here and there, but they are important: Arnott acknowledges the impact of colonisation on the natural landscape of his birthplace. He does this firstly through the eyes of the South Esk god, who observes the âfoul industriesâ of the âloud, pale apesâ when they first arrived on palawa and pakana land, the land we now know as Tasmania.\n\nArnott also explores colonisation through the eyes of Jack, who experiences racism when taking on the human form of an Aboriginal person. He wanted to learn more about how European colonisers were using fire, but he found âthey reacted poorly to his dark appearanceâ. Meanwhile, First Nations people in Tasmania were being âhunted in their own homelandâ, and he chooses not to intervene.\n\nAs immortal outside observers, their perspectives are the only ones in the novel that can really trace this history. Arnott might be including them so readers take his descriptions of nature with a grain of salt: even as we appreciate Australiaâs beautiful landscape, itâs worth acknowledging its custodians who have kept it that way for tens of thousands of years.\n\n4. Symbols & Analysis\n\nSupernatural Creatures\n\nWeâve traced the major purposes of these deities already, but to reiterate them here these âgodsâ symbolise different parts of nature and the wonder Arnott derives from them. Although nature is already alive, these figures help it feel even more so. They also serve the important purpose of highlighting and acknowledging Tasmaniaâs colonial history, as well as the disconnect between humankind and nature.\n\nWater\n\nThe one natural element worth discussing as its own symbol is water. There are many bodies of water identified in the novel, from rivers and lakes to the ocean, and they each have their own significance. For example, rivers connect parts of the natural landscape while lakes (particularly Crater Lake) represent a getaway, solace, solitude and peace.\n\nThe ocean is the most complex of these symbols though: itâs all around the island of Tasmania, and it appears to be a vicious and unforgiving place filled with orcas and tunas the size of âmountainsâ. But itâs also a place that brings calm to Edith and Charlotte, and even Levi as a child. Arnott canvasses all of these different relationships to nature through the different manifestations of water. Water even exists as rain, which in the novelâs denouement represents a new beginning, a washing away of past tensions and conflicts.\n\n5. Quotes\n\nLevi\n\nâMy sister is struggling to cope with the lossâ¦I cannot allow her pain to continue.â\n\nâThey (Levi and Jack) were so alikeâÂ\n\nCharlotte\n\nâThe tears were flames, and they were coming from within Charlotte.â\n\nâLevi and I have never understood each otherâÂ\n\nGods\n\nâSome wore fur and feathers and watched over the creatures they resembledâ¦ Some, like a blood-hungry bird spirit he encountered deep in the southwest, were cruel. Most were calm, seeking only to care for the creatures and land that they felt drawn closest to.â\n\nâHe (the South Esk god) continued on, soothing his rage in a simple, humble way - by nipping screws out of the hull of an idle jetskiâ\n\nâLiving with humans did not workâ\n\n6. Sample Essay Topics\n\nMore than anything else, Flames illustrates the importance of family. Discuss.\n\nLevi McAllister is the hero of Flames. Do you agree?\n\nHow does genre contribute to the storytelling effect of Flames?\n\nWhat is the effect of shifting narrative perspectives as used in Flames?\n\nâI could have spoken to him but he would not have listened.â What does Arnott say around family?Â\n\n7. Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nHow does genre contribute to the storytelling effect of Flames?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWhen talking about the genre of this text, weâll definitely need to discuss magical realism. The question here is about how magical realism enriches or contributes to the story, so it might be worth breaking down the elements of magical realism and thinking through each of them one-by-one. The fact that this prompt is framed as a âhowâ question (one of the 5 types of essay questions) also means weâll have to bring in Arnott and how he chooses to tell the story.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nOne magical realism element Arnott adopts is the gods, who play a few roles symbolically in the novel, but there are other elements too: the seals, the flames, the cormorants and so on. Do these elements add as much as the gods, and if so, what are they adding?\n\nConsider also not just the elements as they appear, but also how Arnott is treating them. The fact that a lot of them are taken for granted as perfectly normal is in itself another genre element.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nInstead of talking about the elements too disparately or separately, I think a lot of them revolve around this central question of how humans relate to the earth and to one another. This will help connect my ideas to one another.\n\nParagraph 1: Elements of magical realism show how humans adversely impact nature\n\nNature is a huge part of the story: around the island, we see everything from beaches and rivers to âundulating moorlands of peat and buttongrassâ. Sometimes, these elements are personified as deities (e.g. South Esk god) â this is where genre comes in, since these deities are supernatural or âmagicalâ, though they are written to exist in our world.\n\nThese voices, made possible by magical realism, highlight the impact of human industry on the environment: for example the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that seeps into Tasmaniaâs waterways.\n\nEven Jack and Edithâs relationship could be seen as a metaphorical take on our incompatibility with nature: âliving with humans did not workâ.\n\nParagraph 2: At the same time, not all humans contribute equally to this pollution, and magical elements also facilitate commentary on this perspective\n\nBefore European colonisers arrived in Australia, the land had been tended to by the First Nations peoples for over 60,000 years - and pollution had been minimal. We cannot blame the entire human race equally for the deteriorating natural environment (see this Instagram post for an explanation!).\n\nThis is pointed out by the South Esk god: it is the âpale apesâ who are trying to âswamp[] over everythingâ.\n\nJack, the deity of flame, also recognises this, although he is far more complicit: âhe liked learning from the pale people more than he wanted to helpâ Aboriginal people.\n\nMagical realism adds this historical and political dimension to the narrative.\n\nParagraph 3: However, Arnottâs use of magical realism also shows possibilities for âidealâ relationships between humans, and between humans and nature\n\nThis paragraph gets to draw on some examples that arenât just the deities: the seals for example coexist really poetically with humans, âthe half of themselves they had been born withoutâ (these were inspired by dogs, by the way).\n\nPlus, even though Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on a lie, Arnott is able to use that as a point of contrast for the relationship between Charlotte and Nicola, born from Nicolaâs âdesire to helpâ, plus her âfast and firmâ attraction to Charlotte. This relationship is highly organic, and the âmagicalâ relationship between Charlotteâs parents proves a useful foil.\n\nEven though some textual elements are exaggerated because of genre, Arnott still manages to use magical realism to highlight what might be possible, inviting the reader to imagine possibilities for harmony between people and nature within their own worlds.\n\nFlames is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Can you believe it is November already? Holy cow. Time flies so quickly. All my Year 12s have finished now, so if you're still here with me ... you must be in Year 11 or below, or you could be a Year 12 that's already finished, but you still enjoy my videos. I'm on to you.\n\nIf you didn't know already, I do have a personal YouTube channel. So head on over there if you guys have finished the year for English because I'd still really love to stay in contact with you.\n\nI've previously done this segment before and when I started it, everyone fell in love with it. So I created the segment a while ago now, and I have done one article... Actually it was two articles so far. If you haven't looked at those ones, I'd recommend you go ahead and check it out.\n\nBut this one, I'm going to do a 2001 analyzing argument article. The reason why I choose really old articles is because I feel like the more recent ones you probably end up doing at school, or you will probably do it in your own time. If not, you've probably already done it. That's why I want to leave those ones to you guys, maybe eventually I'll get up to it. But I want to be able to show you guys a little bit more, so that's why I choose really old ones, but it's still relevant to the course. Don't think that just because it's done in 2001, which is forever ago, what, were you born there? Oh, my gosh. I just realized that some of you could have, yeah.\n\nAnyways, the aim of today is just to go through the article, try to identify what the language techniques are and understand how they are persuasive or at least how the author intends them to persuade the audience. Actually, down the track we will talk more about structure, more at looking at arguments, that type of thing. But the goal here is more just about identification and understanding language techniques. So let's just get started.\n\nWith this particular one, you'll see that it is on a website, so you could analyze that in itself. But since I don't have it in front of me, I'm not going to, and I'm just going to look at the actual article itself.\n\n\"Keep healthy the informed way. Get in early. Get your Medi-Info card today.\" Automatically this might appeal to readers because it's saying \"Keep healthy the informed way,\" as though if they don't take onboard whatever this person is recommending them, then they won't be informed and so they're missing out on something. There's also this sense of urgency, \"Get in early.\"\n\n\"All of the world health professionals and their patients are waking up to the possibilities of the Medi-Info, MI Card.\" So \"All over the world\" is indicative of a global profile so this indicates that if it's good enough for the rest of the world, then surely it must be good enough for Australians like you and me. So that may invite readers to jump on-board with whatever this Medi-Info Card is about.\n\n\"Health professionals and their patients.\" \"Health professionals and their patients\" goes to show that if these people are recommending it and they are embracing the card, such as doctors or dentists or physiotherapists, then it's a really fantastic endorsement about that card and the product and what it's worth. Therefore, we should also support the product, too, either that could fall under the fact that they have credentials and so we trust them.\n\n\"Waking up to the possibility.\" So \"possibilities\" definitely has positive connotations. It's this idea of endless potential and so there is a lot to be gained from the card.\n\n\"Driven by breakthrough technology, the microchip-powered and credit-sized Medi-Info Card contains the info that carers and patients need to have now, on the spot, on time, on the screen.\" So \"breakthrough technology\" itself, \"microchip-powered,\" they both indicate that this idea is cutting-edge. For us, this may persuade readers because there's this idea that the latest tech often means the most effective or it's most likely to enhance your living.\n\nThe fact that it's credit-sized means that it is also portable. It's lightweight. What do you think this could mean for readers? It's user-friendly. How does this persuade them? It could persuade a person to adopt this card and take it on-board because it seems like it's convenient, it's easy to use. And it's not going to be a burden on them because all they need to do is really just throw it into their wallet.\n\nNow \"on the spot, on time, on screen\" really seems to push the idea of what do you think? Sorry, if it's out of focus. It's because I'm not looking at the camera. It could appeal to our desire to have things instantaneously. We're in the generation where things pop up in our face all the time, like notifications, shipping happens overnight. We just want things straightaway. So it could be that, but also this idea that this card is available any time and the information is accessible for you 24/7 so it's convenient. So I'll put that in below as well.\n\n\"This is the ultimate cool techno accessory.\" Okay. \"Cool techno\" itself is a bit of slang, or you could say that it's colloquial language to try to appeal to readers who may be interested in the latest tech, or people who want to keep up with the trend or the latest fashion accessories, for example. But there's this added benefit, it will actually save your life.\n\nThen this person moves on to say, \"Imagine you have an accident and are taken to hospital. Without the MI card in your wallet, can you be sure that vital information won't be missed? Think what the card might reveal.\" \"Imagine itself\" is a hypothetical situation. It's trying to get readers to see that the MI is a valuable tool. It has benefits that readers just cannot ignore and just between you and me, it could also appeal to our sense of FOMO. FOMO is not something that you would write into your essay itself, but there's this fear that if you don't have it, well, then what could potentially happen? It could be really bad.\n\nSo then there's all these dot points about what the card reveals, so it's those features, that for you, it comes back to the idea that all of these are the benefits that you can have. You can have also reassurance as a result because you know that all your information is there. People can access it when they need to, or when you're in times of need so then that in itself could relate to this idea of safety or comfort.\n\n\"All this and more can be downloaded fast from your MI Card. No forms to fill in. No stressful interviews about your medical history. No gaps because you're too stressed to remember your health details or insurance information.\" Okay. This idea that it can be downloaded fast is, again, convenient. It's not going to take up too much of your time. It's going to be really quick as well.\n\n\"No forms, no stressful interviews,\" so these two together will eliminate any of your negative experiences that you've previously had working with health professionals or the health sector. There's this idea of this simple, straightforward approach and this idea that there are no gaps, either. You might be fearful that because you're not providing all the information that you have because you just don't know it, then maybe you won't get the right type of treatment or people won't be able to look after you properly. But in this case, there's this sense of security that you'll be looked after.\n\n\"And there's more. It can even show you that in the event of your death, you want to live on as an organ donor.\" Organ donor itself has positive connotations. Everybody knows that if you're an organ donor, wow, you're very selfless and you're very giving, so this is like an added bonus that can make you feel better as a person. \"You could give someone else the chance of a new life.\" If you're able to do this, it puts you in power, so you could say that you feel empowered as a result.\n\n\"What about security?\" All of this section here maybe you could say specifically appeal to an audience who might be more concerned about security and about the information being put online or into this tool.\n\nThen the rest of it, it's pretty straightforward as well. It'll work pretty much anywhere, so this idea that you're always going to be covered. \"You can trust our technology. Get the Medi-Card Info today. Keep healthy the informed way,\" and then the rest of it, \"Send in your stories of medical emergencies.\"\n\nBecause I just want to keep this short, I think I'll leave it there. You could say that with this part, there's this very enthusiastic tone that's carried through the entire thing. Okay, cool. So I am just going to leave it there. I hope that was helpful to some extent, just to get you started and to get you thinking about some of the language techniques that might be there.\n\nHow did you guys go? I would actually really love to hear what kind of language techniques you found in the comment section below. But if you've got any questions for me, then please leave them as well because I know I haven't gone into this in immense detail, but yeah, hopefully you're able to walk away and learn something from it.\n\nSo if you like this type of thing, don't forget, I have an online course that's called How To Achieve A Plus In A Language Analysis? There's lots and lots of information there and videos that are around five hours long for you. Around 300 students have taken the course and it's rated something like 4.5 and above, so hopefully that's a good indication that it is actually really helpful.\n\nSo next week when I see you guys, we're going to go into part two, the article where it's about the family doctor. So I'd encourage you guys to go and analyze that yourself, and then let's reconvene next Friday and work through it. Hopefully this will prepare you guys in Year 11 for your end-of-year exam. Bye guys!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription 2]\n\nHey guys, so welcome back to part two. If you were here last week, then you know that I have already analyzed part one article for you and now we're moving into part two. You can just download the PDF for this language analysis article just down below in the description box, but let's just get started. Okay, so, \"I am a doctor with over 35 years experience.\" So automatically this doctor is establishing his credentials. So with credentials, it usually means that as an audience, we are impressed and we are respectful of this person and trust their opinion, especially if it's 35 years. \"I know what it is to be called to a local school in an emergency and find a child suffering from asthma, unable to tell me what medication has previously been prescribed. I know what it is to see older patients, day after day who experienced wariness and confusion in trying to remember all the medication they are taking.\"\n\nSo when he says, \"I know what it is,\" these are first hand experiences. It shows, again, and compounds on the idea that this guy is indeed experienced in the field and we should trust anyone, I guess, we should kind of trust the doctor, right, because he's exposed to this type of stuff every single day. It also shows that he is empathetic, which is a great quality to see in a doctor, because he seems to suffer as well when his patients are suffering. So with that in mind, as an audience, we are more inclined to like him and to value his opinion because he has directly been impacted as a result. When he talks about a child with asthma, it's a very interesting scenario to choose, he could have talked about anyone, he decides to talk about a child.\n\nSo potentially what this could do is appeal to a particular audience, for example, it could be parents, it could be other people suffering asthma, for example. But let's say if we're parents, generally we're... I say, we like I'm a parent, I'm not a parent. But we're protective towards young people, and you want to remove them from needless suffering as a result. Again, \"Those who experienced weariness and confusion,\" potentially that could appeal to the elderly. So, if you're somebody who's older and you're starting to experience the fact that you're getting a little bit confused or you're forgetting things, then this might really appeal to you and speak to you because it could be the answer that you're looking for.\n\n\"I recently heard about the pain and distress of a patient who suffered an epileptic fit while far from home. Unfortunately, everyone around him, unaware that he had mild fits, assumed he was drunk and ignored him.\" So this part here, like recalling a story, it shows the unfairness of the situation. That this person who was having epileptic fit, would have a much more positive outcome should he have had an MI card. And we feel sorry for him because nobody should have to experience their illness and be alienated or judged on by the community or by the public. So as a result, we may be encouraged to go out there and get our own and MI card or recommend our friends or family who we know are, who may be suffering from illnesses to get an MI card. \"We can all sympathize with this lad\", so that itself is quite easy. What is it, guys? Inclusive language.\n\nSo if you don't know already, inclusive language engages the audience because it encourages them to feel included and responsible in whatever the author is talking about, so we feel like there's something that we can do in this case. \"This lad,\" that's quite colloquial, why do you think he does that? So maybe it shows that this doctor isn't just a doctor who's distant and unfeeling, but he sees us, patients, as people and as friends, people that he cares about. And so, again, we're more inclined to listen to this doctor because we see him in a positive light. \"He can no longer feel confident when he goes out.\" So this is, again, like so unfair, nobody should go out and feel like they can't be confident. If this is something that's taken away from the person, but a Medi-Info Card could help relieve them of that, then maybe they should do it, maybe we should stop advocating for MI cards.\n\n\"We can all sympathize,\" do you guys know what that is? Generalization. Generalization is when it's indicated that everyone agrees, like we can all sympathize because if you don't seem like you sympathize, well then you're kind of that a-hole in the corner that's like being rude and not caring while everyone else is. So of course you're kind of more inclined to want to agree and sympathize and therefore support MI card. \"As a doctor,\" so yet again, that kind of goes back to like the credentials.\n\n\"I know that in emergency, he would have been given vital help he required immediately.\" So this sense of instantaneous, there's no waiting involved, everything happens straight away. So we can trust Medi-Info, it's going to do its job at making sure that people are well looked after. \"All Australians,\" same thing, generalization. \"Young or old, sick or well, bush or city, close,\" so this starts to appeal that to lots of different people. \"Lives that are free from anxiety,\" so appeals to their sense of freedom or this idea that this person couldn't feel confident anymore. We don't want them to go out there and feel anxious either, right?\n\nYou can see from all the different lines and where they're going, that I try to make connections to other parts of the article as I go through the piece, because I think it's really important to be able to look at things on more holistic scale than rather just one thing on a micro level. This means that you're able to better understand the contention, as well as the arguments that the author uses to build up that contention.\n\nSo let's finish this one off, \"The Medi Card doesn't waste people's time,\" for people who are very conscious of their time and want to be productive, it could appeal to them. \"Safe and secure,\" excellent, so we know that. We spoke about this last time with the MI, giving you security and comfort. And also you can also say that there's alliteration here, it's just as a side note though, I would much rather you guys talk about security and safety and how that appeals to people.\n\nAnd \"My work as a doctor would improve,\" I mean, if you really wanted to, you could even like put that together with as a doctor, and then it goes back to credentials. \"If I had more time to talk to my patients, they would be improved.\" Duh, duh, duh. Cool. \"To me, your Medi-Info Card means peace of mind for everyone.\" Okay, so what do you guys think of that? I'm not going to analyze it, I'm going to ask you guys to analyze it and put it down in the comment section below for me. So with this one, I analyzed a lot, but I'm sure there's still heaps more that I haven't quite looked at. And so I want you guys to put down in the comments below, what are the different types of analyses that you've pulled from this article, let's share around and help each other out.\n\nThe more we can collaborate and work together, the more we can lift each other up.

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nBreaking Down an All the Light We Cannot See Essay Prompt\n\nWe've explored themes and symbols and provided a summary of the text over on our All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down an All the Light We Cannot See essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nTaking a look at this prompt, the first thing to note is that it is theme-based. Specifically asking about the line that separates civilised and uncivilised behaviour within the novel, this prompt focuses directly on the theme of human behaviours and how you ultimately interpret the fine line (i.e. seamless, difficult, changing, manipulative) between such ideas. Fundamentally, you have to discuss how this theoretical line drawn between the contrasting behaviours is explored within the novel in various ways throughout Doerrâs examination of humanity.Â\n\nThe question tag of Discuss is the most flexible type of prompt/topic you will receive, providing you with a broad and open-ended route to pretty much discuss any ideas that you believe fit within the promptâs theme of uncivilised and civilised behaviour. Although this may seem hard to know where to start, this is where Step 2: Brainstorm, comes into play. You can read through LSGâs Question Tags You Need To Know section (in How To Write A Killer Text Response) to further familiarise yourself with various ways to tackle different prompt tags.\n\nIf youâre not sure what it is meant by âtheme-based prompt,â take a look atThe 5 Types of Essay Prompts.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nA fundamental aspect of writing a solid Text Response essay is being able to use a diverse range of synonyms for the keywords outlined in the prompt. Our keywords are in bold. When you are brainstorming, if any words pop into your head, definitely list them so you can use them later. You may want to have a highlighter handy when unpacking prompts so you can do just this!!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nHow people have grown up determines the civil and uncivilised behaviours shown by individuals of different backgrounds and childhoods\n\n- Bastian is symbolised as the eagle that circles the youth camp, which is an uncivilised/unwanted form of hawk-like behaviour. This compares to Fredrick's love of birds as a young boy which makes him a softer character.\n\n- Bernd had âno friendsâ as a child - showing his isolated past - which could be described as the reason he leaves his father and goes off to join the Hilter Youth âjust like the other boys.â (find this analysis in the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ)\n\nThere is a fine line that Doerr draws between the stereotypes of women and their ability to remain civilised despite being suppressed by uncivil livelihoods and experiences.\n\n- Jutta is characterised as a strong and independent woman instead of the traditional âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ. Society expects most women to stand on that side of human behaviour and representation however she defies this.\n\nThe strength of women to cross/overcome the line of uncivilised behaviour is significant within the sexual abuse and misconduct driven by soldiers. Can remain true to oneself despite the horrific behaviours a woman faces.\n\n- The role of women on the homefront (i.e. Fredrickâs Mother) highlights the stark contrast between men fighting and thinking about the âmen they killedâ and mothers who put on a âfake smile to appear braveâ (the line between barbaric behaviours of many soldiers and caring/loving behaviours of those on the homefront) - women and their sacrifices is an important topic here\n\nIt is oneâs ability to adapt to change that draws the line between civil and uncivilised behaviours.\n\n- Marie Laureâs ability to look past being a âblind girlâ, and move on from this hardship. She adapts to the âchanging timesâ around her despite others who are suppressed in such an environment (e.g. Etienne and his âdreadâ).\n\nThe game of flying couch is a symbol of escaping the uncivilised world around them (metaphorical line of the human imagination).\n\n- Werner is predominantly overwhelmed by the world around him, which reflects his inability to no longer ask questions as he did as a young boy. Instead, he succumbs to the uncivilised world of death and destruction as he is unable to change.Â\n\nSymbolic use of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in epilogue - symbolises his loss of perspective and wonder of the world,\n\nUltimately it is this line that makes the human existence so unique\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nAfter having brainstormed all the ideas that came to mind, Iâll be approaching the essay prompt with the following contention.Â\n\nIn a world where society is grounded by behaviours both civil and uncivil, there is a clear distinction between humanity's response and representation of these behaviours.\n\nComing up with a clear contention allows you to put together a cohesive and strong essay that answers all aspects of the prompt question.Â\n\nNow, onto developing our topic sentences for each paragraph!\n\nP1: Embedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative*, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life.\n\n*A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling technique Doerr uses to portray events out of chronological order.Â\n\nP2: Encompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them.\n\nP3: In essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nThe art of recognising the ephemera of the human existence is painted by Anthony Doerrâs All the Light We Cannot See as a fine line between behaviours of civilisation and extreme brutality (1). In the inordinate scheme of history, Doerr fosters the dichotomy between those who remain socially aware and others who are marred by desolation as a reflection on one's past. Further subverting the traditional depiction of women in a âwar storyâ, the strength of women is established as a key turning point for individuals to escape barbaric behaviours and cross the line to civilisation. Fundamentally, however, it is the overall response to change that crafts human behaviours that Doerr underpins within society (2).\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(1) it is important to include synonym variation in your opening sentence to ensure that it does not look like you have just copied the prompt and placed it on your page. This idea should be carried out throughout your essay - vary your words and try not to repeat anything, this will ensure you are clear and concise!\n\n(2) In order to improve the flow of your writing, the final topic sentence of your introduction can be a concluding statement on why/how the topic is OVERALL expressed within the novel. When you formulate your contention, it is not enough just to state it, you must also provide reasoning as to why you are writing from this point of view or how you came to this conclusion. For example, my final topic sentence here is a concluding sentence about how I believe a fine line between uncivilised and civil behaviour has an influence throughout the entire novel and Doerrâs intention, oneâs response to change. As you read on, youâll also see that this sentence relates to my final paragraph, thus linking together ideas throughout my essay.\n\nEmbedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life. The initial illustration of the âsmokestacks humeâ and the âblack and dangerousâ imagery (3) of the war paints a clear picture of the destruction and trauma that individuals have lived amongst, thus why people were âdesperate to leaveâ. Empathising with an âold woman who cuddles her toddlerâ on the streets, Doerr laments how young individuals who end up âsurg[ing] towards one cause,â which this toddler may similarly grow up to do in the Hitler Youth, directly reflects the âintense maliceâ of their childhood. This idea that oneâs past affects the future behaviours of a generation is further captured within the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ (4), which outlines how Berndâs upbringing with âno friendsâ promotes him to âjust leaveâ, in order to experience something new, despite knowing this something new would bring unjust decisions into his life. Becoming âjust like the other boysâ, Doerr suggests that the line between civil and uncivil behaviours is so thin (5) that a mere need to escape oneâs past is enough to create feelings of negativity and at worst death. Encapsulating the darkness that prevails over such individuals, the symbolism of Bastianâs âsharp eyesâ (6) poetically describes the eagle that circles the youth camp where Doerr seeks to paint a metaphorical cruel depiction of Bastian as a harmful hawk. Underpinning the fine line between human behaviour, Fredrickâs âlove of birdsâ is âso beautiful[ly]â representative of his respectful nature and approach to life while Bastianâs immersion in âthe self interest of the worldâ ultimately explains how his fallacious behaviour towards others is embodied by his environment within the war. Overall, the behaviours displayed by humanity are a reflection of past experiences and how they shape the individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) Imagery is a key aspect of All the Light We Cannot See and goes hand in hand with the vast symbolism Doerr uses within his novel. When including imagery, it is great to include a few related quotes; however, you must then ensure you analyse and delve into how this technique (imagery) demonstrates the idea you are writing about. In this case, the imagery of the chimneys and foggy/dirty air illustrates the desolate environment individuals lived in during the war.\n\n(4) This chapter is something not many students analyse or touch on so if youâre looking to add some spice to your writing I would definitely take a look and see what you can extract from some of those more unique and nuanced chapters!\n\n(5) Referencing the âfine lineâ continually throughout your essay ensures that you are staying on track and not talking about topics away from the prompt.Â\n\n(6) Symbolism is very important in All the Light We Cannot See. The use of the quote âsharp eyesâ, really shows that you have considered not only how Doerr simply explores the behaviour of each character but also the physical interpretations of how individuals may demonstrate a certain persona within the novel. This focus on character description on top of dialogue adds extra layers to your writing.Â\n\nEncompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them. Instead of characterising Jutta as a âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ, whom the soldier will âfight and die forâ, Doerr proffers the unconventional humanisation of women on the home front to pay tribute to the power of staying true to oneself (7). Despite facing the barbaric reality of âsex crazed torturersâ, Doerr illuminates Juttaâs capacity to âlook them in the eyeâ rather than shy away from them as a meditation on her own morals of (8) âwhat is rightâ. The tragic nature (9) of such abuse is specifically chronicled by Doerr to concatenate (10) the continual brave behaviours Jutta portrays even when succumbing to the line that attempts to draw women away from strength and independence. Further referencing her desire to âlock away memoriesâ of the past in her life after the war, the novel posits the importance of women during a period of inordinate history as a powerful force that remained civil even in times of âabsolute blacknessâ. From the perspective of Fredrickâs mother, Doerr seeks to display how her âfake smile to appear braveâ outlines how many mothers and women had to remain strong for their children, such as Fredrick with brain damage, even though they were so close to falling into a world of sorrow and isolation. A clear segregation between soldiers who thought about âthe men they killedâ and women who were made to âfeel complicit in an unspeakable crimeâ (11) they did not commit overall affirms the sacrifices women made during the war and without such sacrifices and strength the thin line between behavioural acts would be broken.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(7) Here I have included an analysis of Doerrâs message - what he is trying to say or show within his novel. Ultimately an author has a message they seek to share with the world. Providing your own interpretation of certain messages the author may be attempting to send to his readers adds real depth to your writing, showing that you are not only considering the novel itself but the purpose of the author and how this novel came to explore the fundamental ideas of the essay prompt.\n\n(8) This quote directly relates to the keyword: civilised behaviour. Finding quotes that are also specific to your prompt is crucial to producing an essay that flows and has meaning.Â\n\n(9) The use of adjectives within the essay paints the picture of whether an act is civil or uncivil which is ultimately what we are attempting to discuss from the prompt. Here the phrase âtragic natureâ, underpins the essence of unjust behaviours shown by the soldiers.\n\n(10) Concatenate - link/connect ideas together\n\n(11) Comparing aspects within the novel is a great way to show your understanding and how the same theme or idea can be shown in many different ways.Â\n\nIn essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world. Established by Marie Laureâs characterisation as a âblind girlâ who can âproject anything onto the black screen of her imaginationâ, Doerr illuminates her ability to adapt to the âchanging timesâ around her. She is seen to be âcarried away by reveriesâ rather than a plethora of voices who âforgo all comfortsâ and âeat and breathe nationâ. Through the chapter and make-believe game âflying couchâ (12), Marieâs nature to âsurrender firearmsâ with Etienne in their imagination is a symbolic adoption to escape the world around them, hence the uncivilised society they are learning to live in. Doerrâs congruent imagery of Etienneâs changing voice of âdreadâ to âvelvetyâ as he becomes intertwined within âMarieâs braveryâ underpins the ability for individuals to seamlessly cross the line from a lack of cultured behaviour to a world of hope and prosperity. Contrasting this, however, Werner, an individual who was initially curious about âhow the world worksâ, is so âoverwhelmed by how quickly things are changing around [him]â that his âinterest in peaceâ is stripped away and no longer exists due to his inability to change with a changing world. Doerr, therefore, laments the transmogrification of his character as a reflection of his uncivil thoughts and ideals as a soldier, ultimately resulting in his loss of ability to ask questions. This idea places emphasis on Volkheimer receiving Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in the epilogue (13) where the translation of the bookâs title âFragenâ - to âaskâ in English - is symbolic of the moment Werner decided to âwork, join, confess, dieâ he immediately lost the open mind and curiosity he once had. Ultimately, the dichotomy between these two lives and their opposing character transformations resembles the line between remaining calm or acting out of haste when subject to change.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(12) Analysing not only the game but the whole meaning behind chapters and why Doerr has given them certain names is an interesting avenue to take. Here âflying couchâ not only underpins the imagination of Marie Laure but also symbolises freedom and bravery within just the name itself.\n\n(13) The analysis and evidence used from the epilogue is a crucial part of this paragraph and is significant to Doerrâs novel. Unpacking All the Light We Cannot See, there is a lot of evidence and juicy ideas you can draw from the beginning and end of the novel. Here I have almost analysed the meaning of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ to the bone; however, this adds a lot of depth to your writing as Iâm sure your ultimate goal is to make your essays as unique as possible?!\n\nAs a project of humanism, Doerr seeks to portray a fine segregation in people's behaviours as the microcosm (14) of what makes the human existence so unique. Following the journeys of individuals who even âsee a century turnââ the novel displays how oneâs past has an immense influence on how their future values, actions and behaviours grow and develop. Further subverting the stereotypical representation of women living in a war, Doerr establishes an acknowledgment of their roles and strength in the face of cruel situations. Ostensibly, it is the human capacity to adapt to change that marks the difference between what is just and unjust in a society that weighs both on a very unstable scale.Â\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(14)Â Microcosm - a community, place or situation regarded as encapsulating in miniature the characteristics of something much larger.\n\n---\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our All the Light We Cannot See Prompts blog post.

A+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâ\n\nSummary\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing is one of Shakespeareâs classic comedies, and is in fact the most performed of his plays â even more than Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet. While it was also popular in Shakespeareâs time, its themes are still very contemporary. Much Ado About Nothing is a story of mixed-up love, lies and deceit, themes that are still prevalent in current hit movies like To All the Boys Iâve Loved Before, or 10 Things I Hate About You. The banter between Beatrice and Benedick is amusing and ridiculous, and the ensuing drama between Hero and Claudio is probably not far off the modern drama in the relationships of your friends.\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing explores themes of love, the ways that we can be opposed to love and relationships, the position of women and necessity of marriage, and the ways we can deceive each other and ourselves. If youâve ever felt attracted to someone who really pushed your buttons, felt a spark with someone the first time you saw them, experienced your friendsâ relationship drama, said youâd never have a relationship because study is too important, or even maybe tried to play matchmaker for two people, this play is for you! Love is a beautiful and yet frustratingly unavoidable part of life, and Shakespeare shows us the many ways in which people can react to this and manipulate this for their own desires. This play uses comedy to reassure us that mistakes and misunderstandings in love are an innate part of humanity, as we struggle to communicate how we feel towards another person. Further, it is a play about how we stage these relationships to one another and questions whether true love needs an audience at all. As youâll see, itâs very much a play about appearance and reality, and deception and truth â these are the kinds of questions that humanity will always face when dealing with love.\n\nThemes / Motifs\n\nMarriage and its effects on Freedom\n\nMarriage acts as the primary source of the drama that unfolds in the play, and the main factor that drives its romantic plot forward. Much Ado About Nothing explores the paramount importance the Elizabethan society placed upon the notion of marriage, and the threat this often placed upon the free will of many individuals. This is primarily perceivable in the characters of Benedick, who compares the married man to a tame and lifeless animal, and Beatrice, who disparages the idea of saccharin romance and thus âmocks all her wooers out of suitâ.\n\nChastity and Family Honour\n\nâMuch Ado About Nothing also examines the social concept that a woman should act gracefully and stay âchaste' until marriage in order to bring honour to her family. Claudioâs public rejection and public humiliation of Hero during their wedding ceremony acts as the climax of the plot and a direct representation of the societal values in the Elizabethan era. Shakespeare assumes an arguably feminist stance in his implied denouncement of this despotic treatment of women, who were expected to lose all social standing if they happened to lose their virginity before marriage. The extent of this cruelty is emphasised by the harsh, obliterative words of Leonato, as in his belief that Hero is unchaste, he proclaims his own daughter as âstainedâ and âfallen into a pit of inkâ, having brought dishonour upon his entire family.\n\nDeception\n\nMuch of the playâs plot is driven by both accidental and deliberate deception, of which almost every character is a victim. False language in Much Ado About Nothing is so prevalent that it obliterates the truth and forms an alternate kind of society, in which characters assume the very roles chosen for them by the lies spread about them by others. For example, the rumours that Benedick and Beatrice are in love lead to their marriage, and Hero is treated as a whore by her own father due to Claudioâs denunciation of her as âevery manâs Heroâ. Despite this, Shakespeare examines both the positive and detrimental effects of such deceit; just as the duping of Claudio and Don Pedro culminates in Heroâs social demise, her faked death also allows her to reconcile with Claudio and attain her public redemption.Â\n\nPerception and Reality\n\nThe defining characteristic of Much Ado About Nothing is that nothing of material actually happens in the plot, other than marriage. There are no real fights, deaths, trials, illnesses or sexual encounters - the only perceivable change in the play is the perception of various events and characters, such as whether Hero is a virgin, or whether Claudio and Benedick will fight - hence its name, âMuch Ado About Nothingâ.\n\nSymbols\n\nEyes\n\nUsed to represent the idea of perception in the play, eyes are often utilised by Shakespeare when charactersâ perceptions are distorted by the deceptive actions of others. Much like Claudioâs rhetorical question, âAre our eyes our own?â, the play questions the extent to which others affect an individualâs way of thought.Â\n\nBeards\n\nBeards act as a complex emblem of masculinity in Much Ado About Nothing. Benedickâs autonomous bachelorhood is symbolised by his full, rugged beard, whereas Claudioâs clean, shaven face is a token of his âsoftnessâ and emotional vulnerability. In tandem with this, Beatriceâs aversion to beards represents her scorn for men in general. It is important to note that the action of shaving oneâs beard is a symbol that accompanies the act of getting married - Benedickâs first action as a married man is to shave his beard, and by doing such, allowing himself to be as vulnerable with Beatrice as âLord Lack-beardâ Claudio is with Hero.\n\nThe Savage Bull\n\nDon Pedroâs taunting of Benedick that âIn time the savage bull doth bear the yoke,â symbolises the act of a free-willed man succumbing to the attractive comfort of marriage. The notion that marriage can be a kind of prison to men is repeatedly alluded to in the play through the symbol of the âsavage bullâ; just as the bull is tamed by humansâ training, the free bachelor is tamed by responsibility when he is married. However, the image of marriage shifts in the play along with a transformed imagery of the bull, as Claudio assures Benedick that his horns will be âtipped with goldâ and love through his marriage. This suggests that while it may seem like an intimidating and suffocating prospect, marriage can also provide infinite warmth and comfort to those who embrace it.Â\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nBeatrice\n\nNiece of Leonato and cousin of Hero.\n\nAlthough kind to her loved ones and described as âpleasant-spiritedâ, she is extremely witty and cynical, particularly towards Benedick, whom she once loved but now engages in constant bickering with.\n\nShakespeareâs symbol of early feminism, as she is a character of justice and female autonomy, vowing at the beginning of the play that she will never marry a man in order to keep her freedom.\n\nBenedick\n\nA lord, recently returned from fighting in the wars.\n\nJust like Beatrice, he also vows that he will never marry and stay a liberal bachelor.\n\nAlthough he often retorts Beatriceâs snide remarks and sarcastic wit with insulting retort, his observant friends perceive an underlying affection for her beneath his facade of apathy.Â\n\nThe main character through which Shakespeare explores the theme of deception and performance; as a natural entertainer, it is difficult for the audience to comprehend whether he is merely pretending to be in love with Beatrice, or genuinely in love with her.Â\n\nHero\n\nThe beautiful, gentle and graceful daughter of Leonato.\n\nThe quintessential and ideal woman of the Elizabethan era, as she is obedient to her father and cherished for her perceived pureness and chastity.Â\n\nClaudio\n\nA young, handsome and widely appraised soldier who has attained great public acclaim through his noble fighting under Don Pedroâs command.Â\n\nFalls in love with Hero immediately upon his return to Messina.\n\nAlthough depicted as the ideal male Elizabethan hero, his suspicious and doubtful nature results in his downfall, as he is quick to fall for deliberate lies and wicked rumours, even about those closest to him.\n\nDon Pedro\n\nSometimes referred to as âthe Princeâ, Don Pedro is an established nobleman from Aragon and longtime friend of Leonato.\n\nA character with two faces; although socially adept and courteous in his public actions, he is, like Claudio, quick to fall for rumours and takes hasty revenge on those who fail his expectations. Through this characteristic of Don Pedro, Shakespeare condemns the hypocrisy of societal expectations, presenting the idea that propriety can often cover devious intent.Â\n\nDon John\n\nAlso referred to as âthe Bastardâ, Don John is the illegitimate brother of Don Pedro.Â\n\nPerpetually melancholy and dispirited due to his social standing as an outcast, he devises a treacherous plan to ruin the happy courtship between Hero and Claudio.Â\n\nDespite Shakespeareâs depiction of Don John as the villain of the play, many of his characteristics suggestÂ rather that he is merely an individual driven to commit evil deeds due to his inherent inferiority to his brother, and constant rejection by a prejudiced society.Â\n\nQuote analysis\n\nâHe that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him.â\n\nThis quote by Beatrice represents her aversion to the idea of marriage and her belief that no man will ever be able to satisfy her.Â\n\nAs it was widely believed that the beard of a man symbolised his manliness and maturity, this conundrum suggests that Beatrice believes that no man, whether a man without a beard or a boy with one, will be able to win her love or admiration.Â\n\nâThe savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bullâs horns and set them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write âHere is good horse to hireâ let them signify under my sign âHere you may see Benedick, the married man.â\n\nThis quote is Benedickâs mocking, sarcastic reply to Don Pedroâs adage about how all men, even the wildest of them,Â eventually settle down to become married.Â\n\nThe âsensible Benedickâ here refers to a Benedick who is too clever and pragmatic to yield to the fleeting attractions of true love, as he knows that he will be disappointed by it soon enough. His imaginative scene of himself with âbullâs hornsâ on his head symbolise the Renaissance belief that cuckolds, or men whose wives committed adultery, grew horns on their heads due to their futility. Thus, Benedick here is implying that part of his disinclination towards marriage stems from his fear that his wife will be unfaithful to him.Â\n\nâBut now I am returned and that war thoughts have left their places vacant, in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires, all prompting me how fair young Hero is, saying I liked her ere I went to wars.â\n\nClaudio here describes his swift transformation from a war hero to a passionate lover of Hero. The change that occurred in Claudio is so rapid that it is more of a passive event that occurred to him, rather than something that he chose of his own volition.Â\n\nAs such, Shakespeare uses this quote to emphasise his volatile character and foreshadow the swiftness with which Claudio later disowns his feelings for Hero and humiliates her.\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\nQuote-Based Essay Prompt\n\n1. \"I am a plain dealing villain.\" Don John is the only honest character.

Shakespeare in Much Ado About Nothing utilises the character of Beatrice as the quintessential strong female hero, and thus encourages female autonomy.Â\n\nBeatriceâ strong, independent spirit and fierce wit defines her as the most powerful female character in the play. Her desire to remain a âmaidâ, uncommon in the times as every woman was expected to aspire to marriage, is a striking emblem of feminism, as her self-governance and liberated spirit is depicted.\n\nBeatrice is also perceivably masculine - she even expresses her desire to have been born a man in her patriarchal society, stating, âI cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.â As such, Shakespeare advocates that society should accept a more diverse range of women, including those with more masculine characteristics.Â\n\n2. In tandem with this, the character of Hero is employed as an instrument through which Shakespeare condemns the harsh societal expectations of women.Â\n\nThe public humiliation of Hero as âunchasteâ, or sexually loose, results in her rejection both from society and her own family, including her previously doting father, Leonato.Â\n\nAs such, Heroâs devastating plight reminds the audience that being a woman in the Renaissance meant that one was constantly vulnerable to inferior treatment compared to men, and their harsh judgments - even from male relatives or close ones.\n\n3. Ultimately, the repeatedly negative connotations of marriage expressed by female characters highlights the lack of autonomy women possessed in the Shakespearean era.\n\nBeatriceâs extreme aversion to marriage, as she âcannot endure to hear tell of a husbandâ, suggests that it was not all womenâs choice to marry but rather a heavy societal burden placed over their heads.\n\nHero is perceived to have almost no agency or self-determination when choosing a life partner, perceivable by Leonatoâs reminder to her, 'Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.â As Hero expresses that her heart is âexceedingly heavyâ on her wedding day, the audience is positioned to question the extent of power that fathers held over their daughterâs fates in the Elizabethan era.\n\nTheme-based essay prompt\n\nIn Much Ado About Nothing, Shakespeare argues that deception always results in negative consequences.Â\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Deception is portrayed as a negative tool in Much Ado About Nothing, as trickery leads to tragic events, as Don Johnâs lies directly results in Heroâs social demise and the destruction of her relationship with Claudio.Â\n\nDon Johnâs deceitful words to Claudio before their wedding, âI came hither to tell you, and, circumstances shortenedâfor[Hero] has been too long a-talking ofâthe lady is disloyal,â lead to Claudioâs public humiliation of Hero as every manâs Heroâ - an unfaithful woman.\n\nThe catastrophic outcome of this highlights the negative power of deception and the danger of being swayed by mere hearsay, as Hero is not only scorned by all of society, but also disowned by her own father, who wishes death upon himself and his âstainedâ daughter.\n\n2. Despite this, deception is not always detrimental in Much Ado About Nothing, in which deliberate trickery leads to the resolution of the main romantic conflict between Beatrice and Benedick.Â\n\nThe act of deceiving Benedick and Beatrice that the other is in love with them eventually leads to their marriage - the resolution of the main conflict of the play.Â\n\nAlthough Benedick is firmly against the idea of being contained by marriage in the beginning of the play, he becomes a passionate lover as soon as he hears the false words, âDid you know Beatrice is madly in love with Benedick?â, declaring that he âwill be horribly in love with herâ thenceforth.Â\n\nSimilarly, Beatrice is also positively influenced by deceptive words, as the audience can discern her transformation from a âflighty maidâ to a woman full of genuine affection of Benedick - perceivable by the end of the play, in which she delivers the lines, âBenedick, love on, I will requite thee, taming my wild heart to thy loving hand,â as if releasing the very last fragment of her stubborn heart to him.Â\n\n3.Â In a similar vein, Heroâs staged and thus deceptive death results in her social and familial redemption, as well as the saving of her marriage with Claudio.Â\n\nIn order to punish Claudio for his mistakes, Leonatoâs household publicly âpublishesâ that Hero has died.Â\n\nThe idea of Heroâs death brings so much guilt to Claudio that he begins to remember all of her benevolent qualities in a fit of misery, delivering the lines, âSweet Hero, now thy image doth appear / In the rare semblance that I loved it first.âÂ\n\nLeonato asks Claudio to marry his niece (Hero in disguise) instead of the âdeadâ Hero, and as Claudio tearfully agrees, the redemptive masquerade through which Hero and Claudio reconcile symbolises the positive factors of deception.Â\n\nNow it's your turn!
