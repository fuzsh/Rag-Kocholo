        "text": "In this chapter, I investigate how the notions of abstraction and sexuality in musical numbers of Austrian silent films can be read as destabilising agents of the films’ narratives and ideologies. The first case study, Seine Hoheit, der Eintänzer (His Highness, the Gigolo, 1927), serves to demonstrate how the editing, montage, and camera movements of a dance performance can lead to an abstract visual style that articulates the social anxiety of the post-war period in an otherwise conventionally shot film. My second analysis of the musical moments in the film Ein Walzertraum (A Waltz Dream, 1925) shows equally how the waltz in its use as a proxy for sexuality and erotic encounters, destabilises the form and narrative of the film by transposing musical features onto the filmic language. Two ostensibly opposing images of the city of Vienna form the background for these two case studies: Vienna as the nostalgic screen incarnation of the schmaltzy waltz dream and Vienna as the centre of social and moral decay during the hyperinflation of the 1920s. Both films contain musical numbers and dance numbers, whose sexual subtexts––especially regarding the waltz––become amplified through the ways in which the musical moments are visually stylised. Connected with this topic, but ultimately a separate issue, is the display of the performativity of gender roles in many of these numbers. Witnessing these phenomena at work in (Austrian) silent cinema emphasises the importance of studying these films as models for the bombastic musical spectacles of the early sound film, while reminding us that musical moments were essential elements of silent cinema.\n\nTwo closely connected aesthetic tendencies can be detected within the musical numbers in the two discussed films: (1) a dissolve into abstraction in general and ornament specifically and (2) the implied sexual connotations of music visualised as song and dance scenes. These tendencies can be found in many musical numbers in (Western) cinema in the late 1920s and early 30s, but this chapter outlines a specific tendency that emerged in Austrian cinema, owing to a particular cultural environment in Vienna during the 1920s.\n\nTo clarify some of the terminology used in this chapter, I consider ‘musical numbers’ as an umbrella term for song and dance scenes in a fictional film in contrast to ‘musical moments’, a term theorised by Amy Herzog to represent scenes in which the image-sound hierarchy of classical cinema is subverted, and the filmic style usually changes. Drawing on the work of Herzog and her post-structuralist, Deleuzian approach, we can see specific characteristics and differences in the visual mode of representation during musical moments in these films. Such moments in which ‘the music takes over’ are free from the tasks of narration and realistic representation and can be used to create independent and subversive structures, especially within song and dance scenes, but also in shorter instances (see Herzog 2010). Applying the theoretical notion of the ‘musical moment’ allows us to detect musical scenes in silent films even without knowledge about their live accompaniment. Not all instances of music in silent films are fully developed musical numbers as we have come to know them from sound films. However, as this chapter aims to show, silent films do include, often to great effect, musical moments despite the lack of a technically synchronised soundtrack and thus without the guarantee of a standardised musical accompaniment. In fact, in many cases it is difficult to ascertain which music was played in cinemas to accompany these numbers. This variety of possible musical accompaniments in the films’ exhibition meant that some musical moments only emerged in specific screenings (of the same film).\n\nIf we take the ‘visual variations’ and significant changes in film style during a musical moment as a starting point, we could argue that such scenes do indeed offer the possibility to be read differently than the rest of the film. In this sense, the notion of the musical moment as discussed by Herzog can help identify and analyse early examples of musical numbers in silent cinema, even for short moments that nevertheless feature basic characteristics of musical numbers.\n\nThe musical moment, Herzog writes, is ‘at once one of the most conservative and the most irreverent filmic phenomena’ (Herzog 2010: 8). It is a convention in itself, it repeats the structure and the ideological order of the film and is able to perpetuate hierarchies regarding race, class, and gender. But at the same time, musical moments are ‘open to the interventions of difference’ (Herzog 2010: 8). Free from the task of narration and representational repetition, they create their own musical patterns and refrains, and can thus be subversive and destabilise the established form and ideology of a film. The term ‘refrain’ is taken from Deleuze and Guattari (see Deleuze and Guattari 2004: 361ff), and not used in the traditional, musical sense, but metaphorically. Herzog describes the term as follows: ‘The refrain is an act of expression, any act of expression, that creates rhythm and difference between milieus’ (Herzog 2010: 82). Milieu, another term by Deleuze/Guattari, is not used in its common meaning but defined as ‘coded blocks of space-time’ (Bogue 2003 quoted by Herzog 2010: 81). The relation between refrain, milieu, and what Deleuze/Guattari call ‘territory’ are complex as Herzog explains: ‘A refrain in film is an expressive element […] that serves to mark out a territory, or may even dismantle and take flight from those territories and boundaries’ (Herzog 2010: 82).\n\nThe notion of deterritorialisation is crucial for Deleuze/Guattari’s view of music and their terminology as Herzog explains:\n\nTerritories are formed when the codes that have certain functional qualities within one milieu are transcoded—decontextualized, or deterritorialized, in effect—such that they take on new qualitative or expressive qualities, qualities that allow them to mark out new ground. (Herzog 2010: 81)\n\nRonald Bogue further discusses the concept deterritorialisation:\n\nThe process through which a refrain is deterritorialized is essentially one of becoming, a becoming-woman, a becoming-child, a becoming-animal or a becoming-molecular, a passage between milieus and territories that articulates the nonpulsed rhythms of an unmeasured time. (Bogue 2003: 23f)\n\nApplied to my case studies, we could infer that musical moments in film are the start of the process of film—moving images—becoming music, not visualised music, not transferring or translating music into visuals, but morphing and deterritorialising. The musical moment creates a foreign body within the film it inhabits—with the potential to undermine and destabilise it. In short, musical moments disturb, subvert, and destabilise the form, structure, and sometimes the ideology of the film in which they appear. They can create new ground or territory by appearing in spaces and times where they are not ‘supposed to be’. An avant-garde film style can pop up in the middle of a classical Hollywood film, for example. These moments are not always easy to grasp and to describe. Their fascination lies in their subversive effect as well as in their tendency to ‘take flight’.\n\nOne of the most interesting musical numbers in Austrian silent cinema can be found in Seine Hoheit, der Eintänzer a.k.a. Das entfesselte Wien (Vienna Unleashed). The film was written by Walter Reisch, who is known for the invention of the Viennese Film as a genre, together with actor-director Willi Forst. Reisch famously integrated a lot of music in his screenplays, both in silent and sound films (see Tieber and Wintersteller 2020). The film’s female lead is played by Czech actress Anny Ondra, who later worked with Alfred Hitchcock (i.a. Blackmail, 1929). The film takes place after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The aristocratic class is impoverished and some of its members are forced to work in degrading jobs to make a living.\n\nThe location of the sequences I shall analyse is the fictional nightclub Grand Café Parisien, clearly modelled on the famous Parisian clubs Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère. The whole film is more or less shot and edited in a classical, traditional manner and without characteristic features or signs of auteurism in terms of style. This changes abruptly, however, with the musical numbers in question. The nightclub sequences, which occur in the middle of the film, consist of three short parts, including a short introduction, in which we see (1) a jazz band in radically fast editing, (2) a dance number by a half-naked woman whose entrance onto the stage is significantly mirrored by the male protagonist later on, and finally (3) a song-and-dance number by a female performer accompanied by chorus girls. The beginning of this sequence is marked by an intertitle that introduces the audience to the Grand Café. A very hectic and quick montage of close-ups and medium shots then shows the members of a jazz band; the camera is deliberately moving and shaking. A shot of the entire band––a delayed establishing shot––appears only after the rapid montage. The scene bears all the relevant characteristics of a musical moment à la Herzog: even if we do not know which music was played for the various screenings of this film, it is obvious that the camera position and movement, the editing and the whole filmic style are now determined by the implied music and not the other way around. The film manages successfully to represent a still relatively novel type of music at the time, namely jazz, as fast, hectic, and rhythmic. The visuals communicate clearly how jazz was viewed, and the sudden change in film style articulates the radical break with hearing traditions this music must have entailed in mid-1920s Vienna.\n\nThe band portrayed in the film––consisting of saxophone, tuba, banjo, drums, and piano––was a typical depiction of a jazz band, but not necessarily something that could be heard in a Viennese cinema.\n\nAfter the brief montage that opens the sequence, the camera reveals the interior of the nightclub. The place is depicted as the dark side of modern life, the underbelly of bourgeois society. Everything that is novel and that might trigger anxieties in the (male) bourgeois––and in this case also aristocratic––class, converges in this nightclub: changing gender roles, erotic display of (female) bodies, drugs, and modern music.\n\nAfter this short exposition, a half-naked woman enters the room and starts to dance. An intertitle informs us that the name of the dancer is Diana Manetta. Diana is presented as a real person and after her dance performance, she does not appear in the rest of the film. The dance number is filmed in wide shots from relatively far away; the camera seems to shy away from the half-naked dancer. The dance is intercut with reaction shots of men gazing lustfully and grotesquely at the dancer. This unambiguity of the sexes and their social division into empowered, heterosexual, male spectator, and objectified, passive woman sets up the context for the third and last part of the sequence, the musical number in which the gender binary is subverted. But before the nightclub guests get to witness the much-anticipated musical number, the male protagonist, Prince Otto, enters the stage of the nightclub. The female audience members gaze at him in a similar fashion to the way the men stared at the half-naked woman in the previous scene. After the fall of the monarchy, even a Prince is exposed to the female gaze just like a female dancer is exposed to the male gaze. The whole sequence is structured in a dualistic and almost symmetrical manner, akin to how Altman (1987: 28ff) describes the overall structure of film musicals. The entrance of the Prince is the only part of the sequence in which music is not visually foregrounded. This changes once Otto starts to dance with one of the female guests. During the last, short part of this dance, the camera shows only the moving feet of the dancers, which imply the rhythm of the music.\n\nThe third part of the nightclub sequence follows a little later after the storyline continues outside the nightclub. Back in the Café Parisien, the evening’s main number starts with a wide shot of the band. A dozen women dressed in lingerie and with flowers in their hands prance onto the stage. The camera switches to a bird’s eye perspective (never seen before in this film), creating ornamental forms à la Busby Berkeley (see Fig. 5.1). The dance rhythm slows down and Steffie (Anny Ondra) enters. She is wearing a top hat, a monocle, and a tuxedo jacket; she is cross-dressing except for very short pants and high heels, mixing male and female signs in her costume as well as in her behaviour. Before the dancers and Steffie leave the stage, she kisses one of the girls, cementing the depiction of the space as amoral and sinful.\n\nThis musical moment, in which again all visual elements follow the (rhythm of the) music, is rather short for a song number (only 90 seconds). Present-day audiences might even overlook that this is a song and not just a dance number. Yet this triptych of small musical moments (jazz band, naked dancer, and song number) is put into a clear dualist and symmetrical structure that constantly highlights the binaries in the construction of gender, class, and space. The highlight of the whole sequence is the song, which includes everything that characterises a musical moment. The elements relevant to this musical number may be brief and underdeveloped, but nevertheless, some tendencies can be clearly detected: the overall theme of the sequence highlights sexuality combined with changed gender roles and indecency after World War I. The nightclub functions as a space representing the absence of the old order, and the new reality is unstable and precarious. A naked female dancer signifies moral decay, while a former aristocrat dancing for money points to the elimination of class boundaries and social hierarchies. A shocking new music serves as the soundtrack for this new space. The filmic representation emphasises the erotic and sexual contents of the scene with brief moments where the realistic images shift into abstraction during the rapidly edited band montage, the top shots of the chorus dancers, and an ‘unchained’ camera.2\n\nComparable scenes can be found in a number of European and American films (e.g. Das Spielzeug von Paris (Red Heels, 1925) and So this is Paris, 1926). When the filmic representation of music tends to abstraction, the resulting ‘visual music’ is often connoted with sexuality. The reason lies in the nature of music itself: it is at once abstract and sexual. As Elizabeth Grosz writes in her book Chaos, Territory, Art: Deleuze and the Framing of the Earth: ‘There is an obvious but indirect link between the enjoyment of music (whether performing, participating, or simply listening) and sexual or erotic pleasure’ (Grosz 2012: 27). One way of visualising music during a musical number is to create rhythmically moving, changing, and dancing bodies and forms. The link between music and sexual or erotic pleasure, as Grosz argues, allows us to read organised bodies along these lines. It is also a way to represent sexual energy in the context of socially conservative conventions and strict legal frameworks like censorship.\n\nStarting from an analysis of Esther Williams’ films, Herzog reflects on the relation between the female body and the ornament in these (and other films): ‘Femininity is exposed as conflicted and performative, a masquerade that can be adopted at will’ (Herzog 2010: 176) The female singer in Seine Hoheit, der Eintänzer performs a male identity, although she can clearly be identified as a woman. The film thus undermines and subverts binary gender norms and emphasises the performativity of gender.\n\nHerzog continues to sum up the ornaments in the musical water spectacles of Esther Williams:\n\nThe Berkeleyesque spectacle obscures the distinction between motion and stillness, surface and depth, object and living being. Space, time, and scale are unhinged from an axis of linear causality and become a playground for free associations. The female form in the musical spectacle is a sheer surface, an abstraction and an empty mask. The gestures it offers are decidedly contradictory, appearing to be obsessed with the female body as a sexual object yet eradicating any sensuality or eroticism through abstraction. (Herzog 2010: 176)\n\nThe abstraction of the female body may eliminate their eroticism, according to Kracauer, but the process of ‘becoming music’, the transformation of narrative film into visual music, is itself sexual according to Pustay's argument as discussed above. Comparable phenomena can be found in another silent film: Ludwig Berger’s Ein Walzertraum.\n\nThe 1925 film version of the operetta Ein Walzertraum offers a different example of how music inspired the creation of abstract filmic forms despite its absence in a silent film. Officially a German production, Ein Walzertraum features music, a setting and an overall topic that are unmistakeably Viennese; more precisely, the film adapts the Viennese operetta of the same name by Austrian composer Oscar Strauss. The international ensemble consists of German, Austrian, and Eastern European actors and actresses.\n\nThe operetta Ein Walzertraum premiered in 1907 at the Carltheater in Vienna and had a very successful first run. Not long after the premiere, some arias and duets from the operetta were turned into ‘Tonbilder’, short films that were synchronised with music using gramophone records. The sheer number of these Tonbilder––around 20––reveals the success and popularity of the operetta in Austria and Germany.3 After the work’s first feature film adaptation in 1925, Ernst Lubitsch’s based his Smiling Lieutenant (1931) on the operetta, which even included additional music by Oscar Strauss himself.\n\nThe film plays with the dualism of German and Austrian/Viennese clichés, which allows it to construct Vienna as an imaginary city, living in its own mythical past. The city is strongly connected to the themes of music and love. Since the heydays of the Viennese operetta and up until the Schlager and Heimatfilme of the 1950s, Vienna––much like Paris––was represented as a frivolous city. Ein Walzertraum is an early example for portraying the former capital of the Habsburg Monarchy in a specific fairy tale-like way that became highly popular with the genre of the Viennese film, cemented by Walter Reisch and Willi Forst with their first collaboration Leise flehen meine Lieder, a film about the love affairs of Franz Schubert. One of the most typical spaces shown in many Viennese films is a Heurigen, a wine tavern where people come together to drink, eat their (own) food, and sing to the music—all under the open skies of Vienna. The space of the Heurigen is significant in depictions of turn-of-the-century Vienna as a hedonistic city, and it is also the location relevant to my analysis of the musical moments in this film, albeit that the second musical moment takes place in a beer garden, the German version of a Heurigen.\n\nThe story takes place in the fictional, but unmistakably German monarchy of Flausenthurn (Flausen means ‘silly ideas’). Count Eberhardt XXIII wants his daughter, Princess Alix, to marry the elderly Prince Peter Ferdinand. Alix, however, is attracted to his adjutant, Nikolaus Count Preyn, nicknamed ‘Nux’. Nux is a happy-go-lucky man, who flirts with Franzi, the violinist and conductor of a Viennese female salon orchestra. After seeing this, the German Princess Alix wants to become more ‘Viennese’, so that Nux might fall in love with her. Nux shows the German princess the Viennese way of life. They stroll through the city, past the statue of Johann Strauß Jr., the Waltz King, and take a Fiaker––a horse-drawn carriage––to a Heurigen. ‘To the Heurigen? What’s that?’ reads an intertitle. Alix then takes lessons in ‘Vienneseness’ with Franzi and after some misunderstandings and conflicts the couple find their happy ending.\n\nAt the Heurigen couples flirt and dance; old and young folk, Viennese people and foreigners become integrated into a singing, dancing, and drinking community. The tavern is presented as a utopian place in which differences and opposites are exposed and suspended with the help of music and alcohol. After the filmic introduction of this important cinematic space, which bears elements of a musical moment in its first shots of a Schrammel band,4 the couple arrives. An unknown woman approaches their table, praises Nux and his charm (‘Nux has got it!’) and starts drinking with them. The two musicians that introduced the sequence are now seen singing again and the intertitle reads: ‘See, that’s Viennese, holladeroh!’.\n\nThe combination of alcohol, music, and promiscuous women is here presented as typically Viennese. The scene closes with Nux sitting between two women, singing, a frivolous ménage à trois, the visitors of the Heurigen clapping their hands to the beat of the music. Nux asks the princess for a dance, explaining: ‘A Waltz, your Highness, the most beautiful thing in Vienna’. Alix is obviously not very good at waltzing, disturbs the other dancers, is also a little drunk and finally rests her head on Nux’s shoulder upon which he kisses her. Alcohol, music, and dance have worked their magic. ‘What was that?’ she asks him deliriously. ‘See, that was Viennese!’ he answers sheepishly.\n\nThis scene introduces the connotation of waltz and sexuality. The waltz leads to a kiss, the kiss then leads to marriage. The waltz is presented as ‘an expression of erotic desire’ Alexandra Seibel writes (2017: 273). Altman states that the cliché ‘to dance is to love’ was born with Franz Lehar's operetta The Merry Widow (1905) and it is clearly implied in this scene. The film uses the waltz as a surrogate for sex, or, as Seibel again puts it: ‘Once the woman is willing to waltz, she indicates her consent for the sexual encounter’ (2017: 280). What Nancy Schwartz notes about Lubitsch’s adaptation of The Merry Widow (1934) also applies to Ein Walzertraum:\n\nAll of this erotic tension is beautifully translated into the metaphor of the waltz, which becomes the ultimate, perfect vision of surrogate sex, coupling without consummation: the couples in an embrace, whirling around in circles within circles, generating a dizzying energy that mounts and mounts in exhilaration. If the film wasn’t censored more than it seems to have been, it is because the Hays Office didn’t understand the meaning of the waltz. (Schwartz 1975: 13)\n\nThis Heurigen scene represents Nux’s Vienna, his cultural and social environment. Only the beginning of the scene and the waltz itself can be considered types of musical moments, yet the whole sequence works as the utopian ideal, which will be contrasted with another musical number later in the film. Having danced with and even kissed the Princess, Nux is now ‘forced’ to marry her, which means he has to leave his beloved Vienna to follow her to Flausenthurn. As the husband of a princess, he also has to submit to her and become her subordinate. The constitution of Flausenthurn says that ‘the prince consort is in every aspect under the commanding authority of her Highness!’ Alix and Nux’s wedding is not the happy ending of the film. In fact, Nux loses interest in Alix and sneaks out during their wedding night. After roaming the streets of Flausenthurn, he finally enters a Biergarten (beer garden), in which a Viennese ladies’ orchestra called ‘Die Donaunixen’ (The Danube’s Mermaids) led by Franzi as a Stehgeiger (standing violinist) is performing waltzes. The film then cuts to the lonely princess in the castle; ‘Viennese love music! You have to play something for him!’ she is told by Franzi. The double sense of the German word vorspielen is stronger than in English; it means both to perform something and to deceive someone. Cut back to Nux in the beer garden who scribbles his musical request for the orchestra on a beer mat: ‘Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald’ (‘Tales from the Vienna Woods’), the famous waltz by Johann Strauß, Jr. Franzi, the orchestra’s violinist, first reads the wrong side of the beer mat: ‘Only beer can give German love and German strength’. The Viennese violinist and her female musicians laugh about the unsophisticated slogan. Nux’s request is on the other side of the mat. The film once more plays with the oppositions between German and Austrian/Viennese culture. The sexual subtext of the phrase is hardly to be ignored—its praise of male sexual potency is salient.\n\nThe orchestra starts to play the requested waltz upon which the film's style changes. The location of the Vienna Woods is connected with a nostalgic utopia, a male version of free sexuality. The musical number that follows is a visualisation of Nux’s longing dreams of the Vienna Woods. Cross-fades and double exposures dominate the visual style of the scene. Franzi is depicted as ‘larger than life’, alternating with scantily dressed girls dancing through the Vienna Woods, reminiscent of nymphs from fairy tales. In a parallel montage, the film cuts back and forth between the princesses inside the castle now practising the piano and Nux dreaming of Viennese girls in the woods. The camera then pans away from Nux and changes to a bird’s eye perspective. Flowers are raining down on him, the whole picture climaxes into abstract forms that rhythmically form kaleidoscopic shapes. The number ends with Nux fondly gazing at Franzi, the Viennese violinist.\n\nThe visual refrain of this number, to use Pustay’s terminology, is dominated by abstract forms, dissolves, cross-fades and double exposures. This tendency towards abstraction significantly differs from the rest of the film. The famous waltz––in this case we know which music was played at least at the film’s premiere and likely in many subsequent showings––sets the rhythm to the musical refrain of the number.\n\nThe difference between this number and the realistic part of the film is of course motivated by the circumstance that the number represents a dream. One might argue, drawing on Deleuze, that every number in a film musical is a dream number (see Deleuze 2013: 63ff). On the other hand, as Pustay writes, most musical numbers are ‘not structured like a dream, they are structured like music’ (2015: 178). Musical structure and form, Pustay continues, resemble sexuality. Drawing on Grosz’s work (2012), he argues that Berkeley’s choreographies ‘actively reveal […] how music, just as the natural sound from which it springs, is fundamentally “sexual in nature”. […] Music connects the human animal to the sexuality of the natural world, in turn providing assemblages between the body and the vibrations of the cosmos’ (2015: 182) He further notes that this connection of musical structure, rhythm and vibrations to sexuality is made visible in the musical numbers of Berkeley.\n\nIn the case of Ein Walzertraum, produced at a time when Berkeley was still working as a choreographer on Broadway, sexuality is not only connected to the structure of musical moments, but also to the settings and traditions of Viennese music. Everything in this film points towards sexuality (dancing, intoxication, the ironic reference to impotence), based upon Viennese stereotypes that connect music, waltz, and sexuality. In this type of ‘sexualised environment’, abstract film images are merely a different way to represent music and its connoted meanings.\n\nMusical numbers are, as Herzog writes, ‘freed, at least to a certain degree, from the burden of signification, motivation, and logical development’ (2010: 51). Using such abstract images is only possible within a musical number––sometimes marked as a dream––according to the conventions of the fictional feature film. But again, musical moments in which the mode of representation shifts towards the abstract, are ‘becoming music’. If we follow Pustay, this visual music is already sexual in its form. In its Viennese variation, these musical moments are already embedded in an implicit erotic context.5"
