You don't know Maurice Chevalier

until you have seen Paramount’s “The

Smiling Lieutenant," with Maurice's

gay love-making, Ills delicious comedy

singing raising a riot of laughs and

tender emotion in the eves and hearts

of his audience.

"The Smiling Lieutenant" hns the

whole of Maurice Chevalier hound up

in a single joyous role. His capti

vating personality, his sly and wicked

love-making, his meaningful singing of

the meaningful lyrics, all these tilings,

which each of his pictures to now have

presented in part, are projected at full

force from the screen in “The Smiling

Lieutenant."

The picture is another of those de

licious Lubitsch productions, but. un

like “The Love Parade," it is a real,

down-to-earth comedy romance deal

in;; with a smart and carefree sol

dier whose smile wins him the heart

of two women, it has delightful com

edy moments. Claudette Colbert and

Miriam Hopkins are the sweethearts

who turn Chevalier's head and heart.

Charlie Haggles' characterisation is

an asset to the picture which, in less

brilliant circumstances, would make

a shew all its own.

Hut. perhaps the outstanding feature

of the show are Chevalier’s songs, |

which, put across in Chevalier's i

own inimitable style, send the audi-j

once out lilting and humming! "One

More Hour to Love." "Jazz Up Your

Lingerie” and "While Hearts are

Hinging" are tuneful lyrics which are

recalled and recalled with a smile.

And yet "The Smiling Lieutenant" is

not a musical show in any sense. The

songs are Chevalier’s; they fit natur

ally into the story and pep up the

action.

The production comes to the Prince

Regent Theatre neM Saturday night.
