About the Work

Cabaret was initially created as a costume design for a 1940 production entitled Ein Walzertraum (A Waltz Dream), an operetta by Oscar Straus. The operetta is based on the novella Nur der Prinzgemahl (Only the Prince Consort) by Hans Milller-Einingen from his 1905 book Buch der Abenteuer (Book of Adventures). The Smiling Lieutenant, a 1931 American film produced by Paramount Pictures, is based on the novella. Actors Maurice Chevalier, Claudette Colbert, Miriam Hopkins, Charles Ruggles, and George Barbier starred in the romantic comedy about the love of a Princess for a soldier, and the love of the soldier for another woman.

"Cabaret" is a 7 x 15 1/4 x 22 3/8 - inch sculpture cast in bronze using the lost wax process.
