It’s no secret that the Hollywood Comet loves musicals.

In 2010, I revealed I had seen 400 movie musicals over the course of eight years. Now that number is over 500. To celebrate and share this musical love, here is my weekly feature about musicals.

This week’s musical:

The Smiling Lieutenant (1931) – Musical #358

Paramount Pictures

Ernst Lubitsch

Maurice Chevalier, Claudette Colbert, Miriam Hopkins, Charles Ruggles, George Barbier, Hugh O’Connell, Elizabeth Patterson (uncredited)

My review:

The Criterion essay calls this film “infectiously giddy,” which is the perfect description.

The Smiling Lieutenant (1931) is a treasure trove of a film for a classic movie lover. It has the “Lubitsch touch,” as it was directed by the revered director Ernst Lubitsch; is quite Pre-Code in its content and is a musical, though it is not chockful with songs. Each song provides storytelling and helps advance the plot and share the character’s feelings.

With all of that, it is so fun! Some examples of pre-code include Maurice Chevalier’s womanizing and inviting women to breakfast, implying they will stay the night. Claudette Colbert even sings a song to Miriam Hopkins about how to “Jazz Up Your Lingerie” to attract men.

This is the only musical that Claudette Colbert ever made and while her song wasn’t terribly strong, she still gets by and sounds adequate. I do feel sorry for Claudette Colbert in this movie because I want her to be with Chevalier.

The only real disappointment of The Smiling Lieutenant is Charles Ruggles’s incredibly small role. You see him at the beginning and then he doesn’t return.

The Smiling Lieutenant is so much fun and one I would readily suggest to anyone looking for a good pre-code. Even if you aren’t a huge fan of musicals, there aren’t any tunes that are show-stopping. All of the songs are light, humorous and fun.
