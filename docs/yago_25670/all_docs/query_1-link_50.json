        "text": "Thailand marked “Dynasty Day” on 6 April 2015 under the auspices of The Princess Royal’s 60th birthday celebration which is to be fêted all year long.\n\nDynasty Day commemorates the beginning of regal rule by the Chakri Dynasty and the shift of Siam’s capital from Thonburi to Bangkok, founded by King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (or Rama I) on 6 April 1782. The day is a holiday in the Kingdom of Thailand.\n\nIn founding the dynasty, King Rama I himself chose “Chakri” as both the name and emblem for the dynasty. The Chakri is composed of the discus (Chakra) and the trident (Trisula)), the celestial weapon of the god Narayana (an avatar of Vishnu) of whom the Thai sovereign is deemed to be an incarnation. Hence the name Chakri denotes the transcending force of divine strength and stability upon the physical realm.\n\nCurrent head of the house is His Majesty King Rama IX (Bhumibol Adulyadej) since 1946 (the world’s oldest reigning monarch). The heir apparent is His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Seat for the Chakri Dynasty is The Grand Palace in Bangkok Thailand.\n\nSuccession to the Thai throne is laid down in the Palace Law of Succession, Buddhist Era 2467 (1924).\n\nThai sovereigns from the Chakri Dynasty (all crowned under the divine name of Rama, and distinguished by their regnal number).\n\nRama I (Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke) [1782-1809]\n\nRama II (Buddha Loetla Nabhalai) [ 1809 – 1824 ]\n\nRama III (Nangklao) [1824-1851]\n\nRama IV (Mongkut) [1851-1868]\n\nRama V (Chulalongkom) [1868-1910]\n\nRama VI (Vajiravudh) [1910-1925 ]\n\nRama VII (Prajahipok) [1925 – 1935]\n\nRama VIII (Ananda Mahidol) [1935-1946]\n\nRama IX (Bhumibol Adulyadei) [1946-today]\n\nThis year’s Dynasty Day was particularly meaningful because it was marked only a few days after the celebration on Thursday, 2 April 2015, for the 60th birthday of HRH The Princess Royal of Thailand, Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.\n\nOrdinary Thais wore purple; the colour representing Saturday, the day the princess was born back in 1955, flocked to Sala Sahathai Samakhom at The Grand Palace in Bangkok as well as other selected places in provinces around the kingdom to write birthday messages for the princess. Crowds also queued up at banks to exchange regular bills for special commemorative banknotes designed with the princess’ likeness by the Bank of Thailand. Leaders from all over the globe including US State Secretary of State, John Kerry, dispatched congratulatory messages to Her Royal Highness on the occasion of her 60th birthday.\n\nIn Brussels, HE Ambassador Nopadol Gunavibool, Head of Mission at the Royal Thai Embassy to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg hosted a concert on Tuesday, 17 March 2015 to mark the Princess Royal’s joyous birthday, and fifth life circle in Thai Buddhist tradition.\n\nHRH Princess Sirindhorn partook at the investiture festivities for King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands in Amsterdam, 2013. She last visited the Benelux to attend the funeral of Dowager Queen Fabiola of Belgium on 12 December 2014, in Brussels. At the time she was accompanied by Ambassador Gunavibool and Military Attaché Colonel Perapol Songnuy.\n\nFor more information:\n\nCongratulatory message from US American Secretary of State John Kerry to HRH The Princess Royal: www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/04/240035.htm\n\nCelebration of HRH The Princess Royal, Maha Chakri Sirindhorn:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=jGe-CAH7bnk"
