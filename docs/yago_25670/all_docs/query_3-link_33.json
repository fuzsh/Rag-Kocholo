Without pralung, they will always be hungry. Many months had passed since our arrival at Khao-I-Dang, a camp on the Thai-Cambodian border that burgeoned with refugees, like us, fleeing in the wake of the Khmer Rouge regime. My mother had recently been promoted to director at an orphanage within the camp. While most of the children there had indeed lost their parents, there were those too whose parents had purposefully left them, hoping they would at least have the security of shelter and food. They now had both, but my mother realized that they needed something more. She made an appeal to the larger camp community for anyone with a shred of skill in the arts, music, dance, or poetry to join together in mounting a modest production to lift the spirits of the children. There were no experts, but what little knowledge people had protected and hidden by necessity to stay alive under Khmer Rouge rule, they now offered up. The adults quickly assessed and assigned children to the various roles of singers, dancers, narrators, and musicians. Some fashioned musical instruments from bamboo and coconut shells and nylon cord. Others pooled together to recollect fragments of song. Watching the buzz of activity around me, I realized it wasn’t just the children who were hungry. The Khmer concept of pralung—most often rendered as spirit, soul, or lifeforce—describes a quality that is at once individual and collective. All of us who survived were reduced by the violence and loss from which we emerged, starved in a multiplicity of ways. We longed for the nourishment of the arts that had been denied us, arts so centrally and viscerally connected to our identity as Cambodians. It wasn’t only at Khao-I-Dang, of course. Despite the massive and disproportionate loss of life among artists of all types, I would later learn, countless Cambodians in the country and in the diaspora had begun committing themselves to quiet and often unheralded acts of cultural and artistic revival. One of these quiet heroes was Pich Tum Kravel, who compiled stage versions of lakhaon, the classic theatrical dramas that he had performed in his youth, working from surviving scripts and from memory. Published in the early 1980s, only a few short years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, when so much still lay in ruins, these texts—and eventually a full shelf of books he authored and\n\nxi\n\nedited on various traditional art forms—helped ensure that these masterworks would endure. As a student later at Cornell University, I found in these texts a vital connection to my own cultural heritage. I pored over Tum Teav, learning how a young girl not only disobeyed her mother but also challenged a whole tradition in the name of love. I lost myself in Mak Thoeung, in awe of the courage of a humble perfume seller who stood up to a prince and then the King himself. While I had a childhood familiarity with bits and pieces of these tales, studying the written lakhaon I felt the weight of Khmer literature in a way I had never felt before. The beauty and subtlety of the language, the complexity of the moral dilemmas and questions that resonate across time … Here, I realized, we have not only records of our history but also touchstones to guide us in navigating the troubled present and uncertain future. I may be a long way now from Khao-I-Dang, but I have never forgotten the wisdom in my mother’s simple words. Art nourishes. And who among us, in a world marked by such division and displacement, would not stand to benefit from such nourishment and connection? This anthology is so vital because it provides a glimpse into that rich tradition of Cambodian literature and writing that, particularly for English-language readers, too often remains obscured from view, unrecognized alongside the more visible marvels of architecture and sculpture of Angkor, or the splendors of classical dance. Here you will find not only fragments of lakhaon but also the thirteenth-century Sanskrit poems of Queen Indradevi and passages from the Reamker, the ancient tale adapted from the Hindu Ramayana. There are works from the pre-war period known as the Cambodian Renaissance, including Khun Srun’s writing on political repression, and groundbreaking fiction by Nou Hach and Soth Polin. And there are samplings from a generation of emerging writers, poets, musicians, and performers, pushing boundaries with increasingly diverse reflections on contemporary Cambodia and the diaspora. In these writings I hope that you find, as I have done, echoes of that pralung that animates and sustains us. And because it is only a taste, may it leave you—just so slightly—hungry for more.\n\nxii\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nS O K U N T H A R Y\n\nS V A Y\n\nOn Cambodian American Writers As a member of the 1.5 generation of Cambodian immigrants in the U.S., I could sense the fear of language loss within our community. When my generation was growing up, we were admonished at get-togethers for not being able to reply to our elders when they spoke Khmer to us. After so much had already been lost, the deep anxiety of losing this linguistic link was palpable. If we as the children of the first generation couldn’t speak, read, or write Khmer, we couldn’t communicate directly with the older generation or read the literature of our ancestors. And even those of us who could speak the language with fluency or at a practical level often missed out, during those early years of survival, on the exchange between parent and child in which we could learn about our history. My parents were typical; they didn’t have time to sit and tell us myths, folktales, or family stories. Working several jobs at a time, they were frequently exhausted from cleaning other people’s dirt. They were glad just to sit down at the end of the day with familiar food, knowing their children were safe. Aware of what was missing to make us whole, I searched for language programs, but at that time, twenty years ago, there were only a handful, many of them expensive and out-of-state. The few that were accessible were taught by monks at temples and were likely to be unwaveringly strict and to rely on traditional rote instruction. It’s under these conditions that books became vital to my survival. They kept me company when my parents, believing the neighborhood to be unsafe, had me stay indoors most of the time. Books entertained me and took me to far-off, imaginary places. At other times, books taught me about the world and how things worked. But most exciting of all, I learned that words could be written down to teach: they could reveal to me things that my parents could not show me. I was able to soak up the information on my own. I could overcome the silence in my own family. But, dear reader, at a certain moment, we—I mean you and me—realize that in all these books, we don’t see anything about our community, what our families went through and that they are not written by anyone who looks like us. That’s when the search for a Khmer diasporic identity began. Like scavengers, we searched libraries, the Internet, and college courses. In the late 1990s and\n\nxiii\n\nearly 2000s, there was not much. We ended up becoming unintended experts in Cambodian American literature. In certain works, we found writers with whom we had something in common. More important, we began to discover what we were looking for and what we needed, as well as the larger subject of legacy in a people’s literature. In the absence of stories passed down through your family, you understand that you need to become your own family historian, ethnographer, biographer, and narrator. In the absence of heirlooms, family photos, recordings, literature, and an archive to draw from, you are left with a profound emptiness. You need to (re)create a narrative of what happened to your elders during the Khmer Rouge, their losses and journey to the U.S. And you need to understand what the world was like for them before the Khmer Rouge regime. Escaping from the trauma of Cambodia’s crisis, our community arrived in the U.S. less than fifty years ago. We came without knowing the whereabouts of our relatives. In my parents’ refugee application, both sides of my family were listed as either missing or dead. With finality, in capital letters, was the phrase no others. This is how we and many other Cambodians entered the country: with no documents or belongings, no remnants or evidence of our lives before being pulled from the refugee camps. Our former history no longer applied here. Those of you readers who are members of the Cambodian diaspora: I invite you to bring to your reading of Out of the Shadows of Angkor your discontents, hunger, and curiosity about what you’ve been missing all these years. This collection gives you a view, with a wide angle, of the majesty of homeland literature, as well as of the diaspora. There is a range of genres here that stretches from newly translated classical works to performance artists and spoken-word poets. For educators who might consider teaching from this collection, it is likely you have students who are from Cambodia or Southeast Asia and/or its diasporas, or students who are looking for more variety in a global literature course. These students are why you have good reasons to be holding this anthology. The works in Out of the Shadows of Angkor stand alone, but would go well alongside the literature of other Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam and Laos, and the many ethnic communities that reside in the region. I would also urge educators to include in their curricula—in tandem with this literature—the diasporic works of immigrant groups in the U.S. and to juxtapose them with African American literature. As members of a relatively new diaspora who came to the U.S. as a result of war, we would do well to discuss those connections and to learn how others have coped, survived, and thrived. We are not the first to go through these trials. It’s exciting to see in one volume works from several centuries ago and more, from anonymous scribes and ancient royalty, from wedding songs to the songs of Lok Ta Sin Sisamouth and Lok Ta Kong Nay (masters in their genres\n\nxiv\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nof pop and folk). And to see spoken-word poetry, a play, and a graphic novel. Here are words from the homeland, classic and contemporary, revealing the earliest thoughts and concerns of Cambodians. I would suggest that, whenever possible, the works be read aloud in a variety of venues, the songs be sung, and the play staged. I hope that they will be discussed and recorded. Keeping them alive—on and off the page—will ensure their longevity, along with that of the Cambodian community. When I saw the first Mānoa anthology on Cambodian writing—In the Shadow of Angkor, published in 2004—I was surprised there was enough material to fill a book. Almost twenty years later, I see that an attempt to contain what makes “us” in one volume will always be an incomplete effort. There are many writers who might have been added here if we had had more space to include them and enough time to translate further from Khmer, French, and other languages. So we gather what we can for now and look to the future for the next generation of voices and beyond.\n\nSvay\n\nn\n\nCambodian American Writers\n\nxv\n\nS H A R O N\n\nM A Y\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor: A Personal and Literary Journey through Cambodian Literature It has been twenty years since I was asked to guest edit In the Shadow of Angkor, a special issue of Mānoa focusing on Cambodian literature. The moment I arrived in Phnom Penh, an American journalist wished me luck, telling me that Cambodians can’t write and there wouldn’t be enough material to fill a book. As it turned out, the volume demonstrated just how wrong he was. Nevertheless, many Western readers are likely to hold the same mistaken belief; compared to the literature of other Asian countries, Cambodian writing remains largely unknown to the English-speaking world. We hope that this companion volume, Out of the Shadows of Angkor, will help to change that. The search for the literature presented in this book began in the 1990s. At the time, guest editor Christophe Macquet was teaching translation at the Royal University of Phnom Penh and hunting for Khmer books out of a love of literature and the Khmer language. On his way to and from teaching, he would often stop his motorbike by the open-air street stalls on Pasteur Street (Street 51), near the Independence Monument. In plastic envelopes hanging from portable wooden stalls were books from the 1960s and 1970s—books that had miraculously survived the destructive wrath of the Khmer Rouge regime. Christophe bought many of them, including works of poetry and fiction. Among them he discovered a remarkable volume he had never heard of by Khun Srun, a brilliant writer in the 1970s. Srun was murdered in 1978 by the Khmer Rouge at age thirty-three, along with most of his family. Eventually, Christophe was able to reach Khun Srun’s only surviving child, his daughter, Khun Khem, in a remote border village. He translated five Khmer writers, including Khun Srun, for the French journal Europe, which inspired Un tombeau pour Khun Srun (A Tomb for Khun Srun), a documentary film directed by Eric Galmard. In 2018, with Khun Khem’s permission, he translated the entire book into French, which was published in Paris as L’Accusé (The Accused). The street stalls in Phnom Penh have since disappeared along with the books. Like The Accused, many have never been republished in the Khmer language. Some, however, reemerged in badly retyped and cheaply printed\n\nxvi\n\nversions in the early 2000s—with numerous mistakes, omissions, and missing pages. In order to reconstruct the original texts and translate the works, Christophe turned for help from Cornell University, which in 1989 had started a modest program to preserve Cambodian materials onto microfilm, saving many Khmer books and papers from oblivion. The microfilm was later given to the Center for Khmer Studies Library at Wat Damnak, in Siem Reap. Despite these efforts and others, many texts could not be rescued. For example, one of Soth Polin’s best novellas, We Die Only Once (1967), is lost forever. An enormously gifted writer, Soth Polin began publishing in the 1960s. After a friend’s assassination in 1974, he escaped from Cambodia to France and later moved to the U.S.; he is one of the few to write and publish in all three countries. Many people over the past thirty years have helped create Out of the Shadows of Angkor. They have sought out old booksellers; visited dusty and somewhat derelict libraries; tracked down authors or their relatives, in the city, countryside, and overseas; and contacted anyone who might have a photocopy, or microfilm, or posted work on the Internet. The permissions alone were a monumental task. Finding and translating the ancient texts preserved in stone or in fragile manuscripts and in ancient languages such as Sanskrit and Old Khmer also posed challenges. For example, much of the poetry of Brah Rajasambhar (a seventeenth-century contemporary of John Donne) has been lost to time. The only complete copy of some of his poetry is a black-paper manuscript hidden in the vaults of the British Library. Fortunately, guest editor Trent Walker identified this Cambodian treasure on a research trip and translated it for the first time for this book. The story of finding this text is no less dramatic than its content. It’s a love poem by a king who abdicated his throne for his lover, written while they were separated; the two ran away together but were eventually tracked down and killed. Finally, there are challenges documenting the songs of bards such as Prach Chhuon and Kong Nay, and the dramatic works of troupes that perform lakhaon bassac, yike, and ayai—whose ephemeral art is often improvised and rarely recorded, much less translated. Many Cambodian writers were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979. Others became refugees or went into hiding; to survive, they took on menial jobs, such as driving taxis, selling toothpaste, or even transporting chickens, as Soth Polin describes in his novella The Aroma of Desire in Fresno. When I first contacted him twenty years ago, he was reluctant to talk to me, thinking I was a political agent sent to track him down—a reminder of the many difficulties in building trust in a community that has suffered one of the greatest collective traumas of the twentieth century. Cambodia’s great lyricist Ma Laupi ran a donut shop and convenience store in Northern California; not knowing who he was, I once worked several nights for him, redoing his floors. For me, the creation of this book has had many unexpected echoes of the last volume. Once again, Christophe and I met at cafés in Phnom Penh, most notably the Bright Lotus, near the Mekong River. We spent so many hours\n\nMay\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows\n\nxvii xvii\n\nthere working on this book—drinking coffee and tamarind juice, ordering the occasional bowl of Vietnamese sour soup (despite its name, a Cambodian dish), and taking up valuable space from better-paying customers—that eventually we were both banned from the Bright Lotus. Temporarily at a loss, we found the café of Cambodia’s National Museum, in the vicinity of some of the greatest works of Cambodian sculpture, and right next to the museum’s stage. Each day we worked to the sounds of a traditional Khmer orchestra and the keening of singers accompanying dance practice. It reminded me of my days working in Site II, a camp for displaced persons on the Thai–Cambodian border. The instructor of the dancers on that National Museum stage turned out to be none other than neak kru Voan Savay—former principal dancer of the Cambodian Royal Ballet, and the same teacher of the child dancers who, thirty years before, I had photographed and watched perform the Reamker, the Cambodian Ramayana. She and her husband, Meas Vonroeun, a folk-dance specialist and musician, had turned down an offer to leave for France and instead chose to stay in Site II, where they created a performance center, school, and refuge for dancers and musicians, recreating a lost classical and folk repertoire from memory. Each day after working with Christophe at the National Museum, I watched the end of dance practice and met with Savay and Roeun Sarum—one of the young dancers in Site II, now also a teacher—to identify the dancers and musicians in the photographs I had taken in the camps for a book and museum exhibit. We talked about who had lived, who died, who left Cambodia, who stayed, who became a dance teacher or a soldier, who became the leader of the Royal Phnom Penh Orchestra. The book recounts stories of those young performers and old masters who worked together to revive and preserve their art in war’s shadow. One late morning, I arrived at the museum in a daze. “You look terrible,” Christophe said. That morning, in the span of a few minutes, I had learned that my home and the entire town of Paradise, California, where I live, had been destroyed by a wildfire—and that my father was dying. Christophe was the first person I told. We had planned to work on “Bound to His Father,” a poem by Pen Samitthy about a calf tethered in a field. An old frog emerges from her burrow to tell him that he’s an orphan and that the shinbone used to stake him to the ground is all that is left of his father. It is a poem I love. But I couldn’t concentrate. I was thinking of my own father, who was not yet gone, but would be soon. As usual, I met later with Savay. She was the second person to whom I told my sad news. The third would be Trent Walker, who was also in Phnom Penh. That evening, Savay responded with the compassion of one who has suffered such losses and many more. She told me about the day she returned to Site II (after going to a hospital outside the camp) to find that in her absence, fire had destroyed all of their homes. Her own hut and everything in it had burned,\n\nxviii\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nleaving nothing but a charred patch of red earth. Lost were all the photographs, notes on music and dance before the Khmer Rouge regime, dancers’ costumes, and musical instruments—along with her just-completed book on Khmer dance, which she had illustrated by hand after ten years of work. As it turned out, my photographs (whose negatives were also now burned) were the only record she and the dancers had of their years in the camp. The irony of having my own home and work destroyed while I worked to resurrect the careers of Cambodian authors—some of whom perished in war, and others who lost nearly everything to it—has been etched into my mind. The night before I left, Savay took my hands in hers and said fervently, “If your house is burned, rebuild it. This is how it is. If our house is burned, we remake it.” That is exactly what Cambodian artists, dancers and musicians, poets, playwrights, bards, and writers have been doing for generations. And so this book seeks to bring Cambodian literature out of the shadows of the great temples of Angkor and out of the ashes of a war that killed most of the country’s authors and destroyed countless irreplaceable books, whether by fire, neglect, or being turned into cigarette wrappers or toilet paper. The works collected here illuminate fourteen hundred years of a tradition in which the oldest surviving poetry is inscribed in stone—a classical literature of complex, clever, and nuanced beauty, written in ancient, rarely translated languages. At the same time, it presents contemporary Cambodian writers who have risen to the challenges faced by refugees of war, rebuilding a literary community out of devastation. And it presents the children of the diaspora living in countries from Australia to the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The earliest recorded writings in Cambodia are carved in stone in Sanskrit and Old Khmer. The great temples of Angkor have many beautiful poetic inscriptions, invisible and unknown to the tourists who pass by. These include Queen Indradevi’s moving elegy to her sister, composed around 1200 AD at the height of the Angkor era, and “Hymn to the Tree of Awakening,” both inscribed into the temple of Phimeanakas and included here. Around the fifteenth century, the Khmer language was transformed into what is now called Middle Khmer. By the eighteenth century, it lost most of its original voiced consonants and doubled its number of vowels (making it one of the most vowel-rich languages in the world). The multisyllabic vocabulary from Pali and Sanskrit, combined with the largely monosyllabic, highly alliterative and onomatopoeic native vocabulary, created a diverse orchestra of sounds and a wonderful rhythmic and melodic palette embraced by poets. Among these early compositions are long, varied lists and beautiful descriptions of species of birds, fish, animals, plants, and even place names invoking the spirits of the land in every corner of Cambodia. The beauty of language and sound—in Khmer, piruoh (melodious, melliflluous)—is greatly valued. There is a Khmer expression, chhnganh trachiek—which literally means delicious (like food)\n\nMay\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows\n\nxix xix\n\nfor the ears. Wit, word play, poetic speech, musicality, and the ability to tell a good story are all highly appreciated in Cambodia, whether one is literate or not—and this has been reflected in its literature over the centuries. Classical Khmer poetry has over sixty forms, using complex meters and intricate rhyme schemes. The epics, or verse novels, were composed in thousands of stanzas and could take days to chant. Perhaps the most famous epic poem in Cambodia is the Reamker, which has been recited, sung, and danced in various forms for centuries. These verse novels continue to influence writers today. Kong Nay learned to improvise by memorizing verse novels; Ma Laupi studied all the classical poetic epics. The majority of the translated material here appears for the first time in English, including the large section of classical texts from the ad 600s to the ad 1900s, thanks to guest editor Trent Walker. Among these translations into English is Mai’s Code for Girls, now controversial for its rules of proper conduct for women, but a text that can also be read as a subtle critique of men behaving poorly. Thunder and the Crabs, a classic teaching text, consists of a humorous and lively dialog between Thunder and the vulnerable crabs he is about to leave to the various dangers posed by men. Many of the surviving versions of wedding songs, Buddhist chants, and folktales presented here were recorded only in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries—after being been passed down orally for untold generations. Modern Cambodian literature began to emerge in the early twentieth century. Khmer poet and scholar Ukna Suttantaprija Ind (1859–1924) was a pivotal figure in its creation. His poem Journey to Angkor Wat describes his travels to attend King Sisowath’s visit to the Angkor temples in 1909. The manuscript, discovered among his possessions after his death, represents a transition between classical tradition and modernity. In the excerpts translated here, the poet recounts his river journey as a meditation on life, desire, and impermanence, and also describes his first seeing the great stone lions of Angkor—one of the most famous passages in Cambodian literature. In the early 1900s, the Buddhist Institute, which initially printed Journey to Angkor Wat and other literature, became the nation’s first major publisher. Khmer-language newspapers and journals appeared in the 1920s, although the first Khmer-owned and operated newspaper, Nagaravatta (Angkor Wat), did not appear until 1937. The first Khmer modern novels appeared soon afterward. A new Khmer term was invented for the novel, pralaom lok—which means a story written to seduce the hearts of human beings—a term coined by Soth Polin’s maternal great-grandfather, the poet Nou Kan. Many of these early works featured ill-fated lovers and contained moral and social critiques. As with some of the nineteenth-century work of Dickens and Tolstoy in Europe, many Cambodian novels of the 1900s were serialized in newspapers or journals, first in Buddhist publications and later in secular periodicals. Among these was the literary supplement of Reatrey Thngai Sau (Saturday Night), which inspired a\n\nxx\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nwhole generation of writers, including Soth Polin, who secretly read its pages while hiding in his mother’s closet. In 1915, the Buddhist monk Brah Padumatther Som composed his version of the famous Tum Teav, based on an earlier tragic love story, considered Cambodia’s Romeo and Juliet. The classic story of separated lovers would become the subject of many modern novels—from Nou Hach’s Wilted Flower, in 1947, to Ty Chi Huot’s Sky of the Lost Moon, in 1985—often interwoven with issues of social or class divisions. All three of these classics are excerpted in Out of the Shadows of Angkor. Som’s Tum Teav is translated by Trent Walker, whose love of Cambodia’s classic literature began when he learned to sing its Buddhist poetry. Wilted Flower is beautifully translated by Vaddey Ratner, and Sky of the Lost Moon is translated by guest editor Rinith Taing, who first discovered the novel when he was a teenager searching for literary gems in a dusty library. Rinith’s essay, “The Bookrenter of Battambang and the Master of Uselessness,” is an homage to his passion for books. The love of books, the arts, and the country—often in the face of great loss and adversity—is among the prominent themes of this volume. It is present in the foreword by Vaddey Ratner and the preface by Sokunthary Svay, both living in the U.S., and in the work of guest editors Phina So and Rinith Taing, both living in Cambodia. Indeed, during Cambodia’s struggle for independence, literature became inextricably linked with national identity. Cambodians in France began writing decades before independence, among them Makhali Phal, daughter of a Cambodian woman of royal lineage and a minor French official, and Prince Areno Yukanthor, son of the rebel Prince Yukanthor. Both wrestled in different ways with aspects of colonialism and the divide between East and West. Following Cambodia’s independence from France in 1953, literacy, education, and publication expanded. In 1961, Suon Sorin published A New Sun Rises Over the Old Land, an ideological novel that describes the hardships of a cyclo driver’s life and remains popular today. This was the heyday of Cambodian rock ’n’ roll, the “golden” voice of Sinn Sisamouth, and a vibrant sophisticated community of writers and intellectuals, among them Khun Srun and Soth Polin. Fluent in both Khmer and French, they were creating new Cambodian literature, despite being threatened by censorship, disappearance, assassination, the closing down of presses, and the war spilling over from neighboring Vietnam. After the 1970 coup that deposed Prince Sihanouk, a war ensued between the Khmer Republic and the Khmer Rouge, but this turbulent period of political upheaval and unrest nevertheless saw a flourishing of music, poetry, fiction, and memoir, largely unknown to English-speaking readers today. Among the works represented here are Bunchan Mol’s memoir of his imprisonment in the 1940s in the French colonial prison on Poulo Condor (Koh Tralach, in Khmer), a penal island off what is now the coast of southern Vietnam. Khun Srun’s The Accused, published in 1973, is about his first imprisonment by the\n\nMay\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows\n\nxxi xxi\n\nLon Nol regime; after his second imprisonment, he joined the Khmer Rouge but was executed by them in Tuol Sleng prison just days before the fall of the regime—murdered in the very same high school where he had taught as a young man. In his introduction, Christophe Macquet writes, “The Accused is moving, finally, because of its resistance to life’s oblivions. To be able to read The Accused by Khun Srun seems miraculous. The original Khmer-language book is nearly impossible to find in Cambodia today.” In “A Small Request,” Khun Srun asks to be buried under a small mango tree. This haunting poem was written when he was just twenty-four years old in 1969, before the Khmer Republic and the Khmer Rouge regime. On April 17, 1975, less than four decades after the publication of Cambodia’s first novel, the flowering of Cambodian literature and scholarship abruptly ended with the Khmer Rouge takeover. Reading and writing were virtually abolished, as was music, except for purposes of propaganda. Kong Nay describes being forced to sing Khmer Rouge propaganda until that too was silenced. Revealing one’s education, wearing glasses, or being an artist could get one killed—as many people were. Buddhist monasteries, the traditional repositories of literature, were ransacked and used as prisons. The National Library of Cambodia was used to raise pigs; in fact, it has never fully recovered and only twenty percent of its pre-war collection was preserved. Of more than six hundred librarians, only three survived. On January 7, 1979, Vietnamese-backed troops ousted the Khmer Rouge. Artists, writers, and citizens found themselves in a shattered country. The nation’s infrastructure had been destroyed and the land seeded with mines and unexploded ordnance. Poverty and illiteracy were widespread. Considering the devastation in the country, it is surprising that anyone wrote at all. But they did. Almost as soon as the Khmer Rouge regime ended, a new literature appeared: novels were handwritten, often in pencil, on the cheap graph-lined paper of student notebooks, then photocopied or recopied by hand and rented out by the day at market stalls. Guest editor Phina So in her essay, “Contemporary Writing and Publishing in Cambodia,” recalls her mother renting out these hand-copied novels, including those by Tonsai (Rabbit), the pen name of Mao Somnang, and describes what it’s like to be a writer, editor, and publisher in Cambodia today. With the advent of video culture and capitalism, many of the older texts— even those written as recently as the 1980s and 1990s—ceased to be printed or copied and became difficult to find. Even Sky of the Lost Moon, the most popular novel of its generation, fell into obscurity. However, new writers have emerged in Cambodia, such as fiction writer and lyricist Sok Chanphal, two of whose stories are included here, one of them a ghost story in the tradition of Chuth Khay. Kong Bunchhoeun, born in Battambang province, resumed his writing career, which had begun in the 1950s. He escaped execution during the Khmer Rouge era thanks to a cadre who had read his novels and testified to his “profound sense of social justice.”\n\nxxii\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nModern poetry—which began in Cambodia with the publication of Keng Vannsak’s Virgin Heart in 1954, and continued with such volumes as Koy Sarun’s Black Flowers in 1970—resumed in the 1980s with work by poet and scholar Chey Chap, poet and journalist Pen Samitthy, poet and actor Pich Tum Kravel, and Yin Luoth, now a Khmer-language lecturer in the U.S. Meanwhile, another era of Cambodian writing began overseas: a literature of exile, to be transformed into other forms by younger artists, who often live and work between different countries. In France in the 1980s and 1990s, Cambodians were writing poems in Khmer, such as Khau Ny Kim’s “A Hundred Scents, A Hundred Seasons,” first published by Pech Sangwawann’s Association of Khmer Writers Abroad. Others writing in French include Prince Amrindo Sisowath, whose poem “A Cry” was written and published while he was in the Sainte-Anne mental asylum. Soth Polin wrote The Anarchist in French, an excerpt of which was translated by Penny Edwards for this volume. In addition, literary scholars such as Khing Hok Dy were gathering, preserving, and translating Khmer literature into French. Rithy Panh, whose work is presented in our previous volume, began his groundbreaking film career. Tian Veasna’s three-volume graphic novel about the Khmer Rouge period was first published in France, then in Cambodia, and finally in English as Year of the Rabbit. Fiction, essays, and memoirs have begun to be published in recent decades by talented Cambodian writers in the U.S. Recent fiction ranges from the novels of Vaddey Ratner to the short stories of Anthony Veasna So. Other modern prose writers include Danny Thanh Nguyen (of Khmer Krom heritage) and several essayists included in this book writing about the arts: Sokunthary Svay on music; Elizabeth Chey on painter Vann Nath; Prumsodun Ok on sacred dance; and Boreth Ly on photography. International journalist Putsata Reang has contributed “At Sea, and Seeking a Safe Harbor,” which is a prelude to her memoir, Ma and Me. Living in Australia, Alice Pung is represented here by an excerpt from her second memoir, Her Father’s Daughter, about her return to Cambodia. Poet U Sam Oeur, who survived the Khmer Rouge years by feigning illiteracy, received an MFA from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop in 1968. His bilingual book of poems, Sacred Vows, was translated and published in the U.S. in 1998; his work appears in our previous volume. Other Cambodian poets who are publishing in English in the U.S. include Chath pierSath, Bunkong Tuon, Sokunthary Svay, Mylo Lam, and Monica Sok. Poet Greg Santos, a transracial adoptee of Cambodian descent, publishes in Canada. Cambodia’s rich oral tradition of poetry and storytelling is carried on today by traditional artists such as the bluesy, improvisational chapei master Kong Nay, who recently collaborated with rap artist Vann Da. Younger generations of spoken-word poets in the U.S. and Cambodia include praCh, Kosal Khiev, and Princess Moon. While writing is the most solitary of pursuits, the creation of literature and the communities from which it comes are often made from literary friendships,\n\nMay\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows\n\nxxiii xxiii\n\nwherever in the world they reside. In the “golden age” of Cambodian literature in the 1960s and 1970s, a community of writers thrived through such friendships and literary partnerships. Khun Srun helped publish his mentor Koy Sarun; Soth Polin started his own newspaper and published many of the most brilliant voices of his day, including those on the opposite end of the political spectrum. This book has likewise grown out of literary friendships and mentorships over the years. It would not have been possible without our dedicated team of guest editors and the expertise of Frank Stewart and the editors of Mānoa: A Pacific Journal of International Writing, who published In the Shadow of Angkor in 2004 (and years earlier, my first short story). I met Christophe Macquet, my literary cohort, in Phnom Penh twenty years ago through my friendship with Soth Polin; we communicated in our common language, Khmer, to the amusement of the café workers at the places we met; Christophe has spent a large part of his life translating and documenting Cambodian literature, as well as translating foreign literature into Khmer. I first encountered Trent Walker fifteen years ago on a sunny afternoon at Stanford University, when he was an undergraduate and had just spent a year learning smot singing in Cambodia; he has since become a brilliant translator of ancient Cambodian languages and an endlessly patient and generous literary colleague through the years of working on this book. I met Phina So in Cambodia years ago when the only literary festivals were not in Khmer; she has worked tirelessly to remedy that by becoming a writer, editor, publisher, and passionate community advocate for Cambodian literature and arts. The Khmer Literature Festival she founded in 2017 is now an annual event. I remember standing on the steps of the CKS library at that first inaugural festival, in October 2017, at Wat Damnak, in Siem Reap, in the same spot where, fifteen years earlier, a young poet had told me, “I am a Khmer writer. I don’t have much experience. But in my heart, I feel addicted to writing.” Rinith Taing has been writing perceptively about Cambodian authors and artists for many years as a journalist based in Phnom Penh; he worked intensely on translations for this volume. Others who contributed to this book are too numerous to mention in this overview, but have our heartfelt and enduring thanks. Their names can be found in the Acknowledgments. The work included in Out of the Shadows of Angkor is just a part of the vast, diverse repertoire of Cambodian literature created by those born in Cambodia, in the camps, and in new lands. Soth Polin once told me, “What we have lost is indescribable . . . What we have lost is not reconstructable. An epoch is finished. So when we have literature again, it will be a new literature.” We hope this book brings out of the shadows some of the lost, hidden, and emerging gems of Cambodian literature—past, present, and moving into the future.\n\nxxiv\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nT R E N T\n\nW A L K E R\n\nCambodian Literature: An Introduction When Cambodians speak of literature, they speak of aksar-sel (Sanskrit aksharashilpa), “the art of letters” and aksar-sah (aksharashastra), “the science of letters.” Khmer writers who succeed are celebrated not only for the creative genius of their art but also for their technical mastery over the bewildering variety of forms and genres Cambodian authors have developed. In Khmer, authors are known as neak nipun, literally “those who bind together,” from Sanskrit nibandha, “tying down.” The work of composition demands virtuosity in fastening words to one another. In many Cambodian genres, this work of binding involves controlling impressive arrays of linking rhymes and layers of hidden meanings. Even prose authors are tasked with holding together long strings of serial verbs and adjectives, evoking the sonic qualities of assonance and balance so valued in Cambodian poetry. I entered Cambodian literature through the door of sound. My first intensive encounters with its literary forms were as a student of Buddhist chant and poetry recitation in rural Kampong Speu province, Cambodia, for thirteen months from 2005 to 2006. My teachers, lok kru Prum Ut and neak kru Koet Ran, had exacting standards for diction, melody, and moral conduct, and knew that their role as masters of an exceptionally musical form of chant called smot meant instilling such standards in their students. I was only eighteen at the time, fresh out of high school in San Francisco, and was at first a failure in their eyes. I mispronounced the words, put trills and glissandi in the wrong places, and once ran away to a nearby mountain temple when I couldn’t stand the pressure of complete immersion in Khmer village life. Despite my transgressions, they took me under their care. Under their tutelage, I repeated short phrases until I got it right or until my throat, irritated by the silty tea we drank out of dimpled beer mugs, simply gave out. In studying with Prum Ut and Koet Ran, I had unwittingly been steeped in the way Cambodian literature had been transmitted for the past fifteen hundred years. Koet Ran, who became blind after the Khmer Rouge period, stressed the oral method alone: she would sing, I would repeat, then she would critique me and sing again. She had memorized well over a hundred chants and had high hopes I would have such a fine memory. But here again I failed,\n\nxxv\n\nfumbling for the words whenever I set down my notebook. Prum Ut offered a dual method, both oral and written. At night, he would sit me down on the creaky floors of his one-room home, light a slender candle, and take a thick krang off the altar. This paper manuscript, folded in the leporello or accordion style, guided my studies of smot and sparked a lifelong passion for traditional Southeast Asian books and manuscripts. Prum Ut chanted Khmer and Pali texts from the krang in ornate, flowing melodies as I did my best to keep up. By day, I returned to the manuscript, transcribing and translating the texts we had studied the night before. My failures notwithstanding, these are the core methods that Cambodians have used in teaching literature and the performance of literature to new generations since at least the seventh century of the Common Era. For many Cambodian authors throughout history, their rigorous approach to language built the foundation for the expressive art of literature. Since this issue of Mānoa looks at literature as art rather than science, I offer my essay here as a kind of counterweight, carving out a peephole into the precise, intricate workings that make traditional Cambodian literature tick. The borders of the modern nation-state of Cambodia are home to a plethora of languages. In addition to the ninety percent who primarily speak the national language of Khmer, there are also large communities of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Cham speakers, the latter being an Austronesian language closely related to Malay (and very distantly to Hawaiian). On Cambodia’s hilly borders with Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos, there is also an extremely diverse range of indigenous communities living in the forest, beyond the margins of wet-rice cultivation. Most of these groups speak related languages from the Austroasiatic family and have lived in Cambodia for several thousand years or more. This volume—like so many representations of Cambodia—focuses on voices from the numerically and politically dominant community of Khmer speakers. But language and ethnicity are never airtight categories. Many of the writers featured in this collection are of mixed heritage, including several with both Khmer and Chinese traditions in their families and one who was born in Vietnam. Sinn Sisamouth, far and away the most celebrated Khmer singer and songwriter of the twentieth century—a performer included here—had both Lao and Chinese grandparents. To complicate the picture further, Khmer speakers are not limited to Cambodia. They have lived in the southern provinces of modern-day Vietnam since at least the middle of the first millennium, if not considerably longer. Vietnamese toponyms such as Saigon have older Khmer names; sài gòn is probably derived from Khmer prey kor “Kapok Forest” or prey nokor, “City in the Forest.” The whole Mekong Delta region is sometimes known as Kampuchea Krom, or Lower Cambodia, and the Khmer dialect spoken there is mutually intelligible with that in Cambodia proper. The political reach of past Khmer\n\nxxvi\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nkingdoms once extended far into what is now Laos and Thailand, particularly before Lao and Thai speakers arrived in mainland Southeast Asia in the early centuries of the second millennium. Even today, in the southern provinces of northeastern Thailand, especially Surin, Buriram, and Sisaket, there is a robust community speaking a dialect known as Northern Khmer, which in recent centuries has diverged significantly from Modern Khmer as spoken in Cambodia. One song in Northern Khmer appears in this volume, Songsaeng Rungrueangchai’s “The Big Tusker.” The Cambodian diaspora has brought Khmer speakers to many corners of the globe. Large refugee communities formed in France, the U.S., Australia, Canada, and elsewhere after the collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. Many Cambodian authors abroad continue to read and write in Khmer, while others have made their literary mark in English, French, and other languages. Khmer literacy is still taught in diaspora communities, particularly in Buddhist temples. It is also fostered at university academic programs. Maintaining the Khmer language in aggressively monolingual environments such as the U.S., with its long history of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia, is an enduring challenge for members of the Cambodian diaspora. Limited resources are available for language programs, especially in comparison to programs in other Asian diaspora communities. My personal hope is that this volume may remind the Anglophone world of the depth, range, and beauty of Cambodian literature, and so foster support for more language programs, especially those serving diaspora communities. Where does the national language of Cambodia come from? Khmer, along with Mon and Vietnamese, is one of the most prominent representatives of the Austroasiatic language family, as basic to human history as Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, or Dravidian. Austroasiatic languages are the primary indigenous languages of mainland Southeast Asia, and their distinct grammar, phonology, and vocabulary have shaped all subsequent languages that have entered the region. It is hard to pinpoint exactly when the Khmer language arose; it probably diverged from its closest Austroasiatic cousins between two and three thousand years ago. Like other languages in the same family, Khmer has several fascinating properties that have guided its development as a literary vehicle. First, Khmer is distinguished by its mix of monosyllables and sesquisyllables. The latter refers to words composed of a weak syllable followed by a strong syllable. The rhythmic structure of Khmer verse thus tends to be iambic, with an alternating stress pattern. Second, these sesquisyllables are generally derived through prefixes and infixes that can easily change verbs into nouns, actions into agents, and ordinary verbs into causatives. In simple terms, this means that every verbal root in Khmer can be grammatically transformed by adding a weak syllable to either its front or middle. An old verbal root, ser/sir, meaning “to make a line” (now obsolete in Khmer), can be transformed into sar-ser (“to write”), smer (“a scribe, a writer”), and samner (“a piece of writing”). Third,\n\nWalker\n\nn\n\nCambodian Literature\n\nxxvii\n\nthese verbs and their derived forms may be combined with other verbs to form complex strings of serial verbs. In poetry, key nouns such as the subject and object may be dropped or only implied, leaving behind a sequence of verbs for the reader or listener to weave together into a grammatical sentence. These features give Khmer authors great flexibility but pose particular challenges when translating into a radically different language such as English. In addition to its distinctly Austroasiatic features, Khmer literature has been shaped by words borrowed from other languages. The vocabulary of Khmer received a massive influx of words from Pali and Sanskrit, a transformation already visible in the earliest dated Khmer-language inscription from 612 ce. Later cultural contacts brought a smaller number of words from Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, and French. By the mid-twentieth century, Khmer writers, concerned about the increasing share of foreign borrowings, either coined new words from Indic roots or adopted Khmer-derived terms for describing the new protocols and technologies of the modern world. The result of these centuries of borrowings and new coinages is an Austroasiatic language with a rich set of Indic-derived words, similar to the preponderance of Romance-language vocabulary in English. Cambodia is home to one of the longest continuous literary traditions in Southeast Asia. The oldest writings in Sanskrit by Cambodian authors date to the fifth century, and hundreds of Khmer-language inscriptions survive from as early as the seventh and eighth centuries. To speak of the Sanskrit inscriptions first, these are almost entirely in verse and reflect the linguistic genius of their Cambodian authors. The dominant form of Sanskrit verse in Cambodia is known as prashasti (“praise”), the genre of ornate, eulogistic inscriptions that spread throughout South and Southeast Asia during the first millennium and early into the second. Surviving examples of this genre by Khmer authors number in the hundreds. A short except from one of them appears in this volume, under the title “In Praise of Sister Queens.” This celebrated inscription, among the oldest known works by a female author in Southeast Asia, was etched in stone at the temple of Phimeanakas in the heart of the ancient royal palace. Sanskrit prashasti by Khmer authors are just as magnificent as those produced in India. Indeed, the Sanskrit inscriptions of Cambodia are only matched by the magnificence of the stone monuments on which they are carved. Dense with royal and religious imagery, many such inscriptions overflow with an ingenious literary technique called shlesha (“embrace”), in which whole stanzas are intended to be read in two completely divergent ways based on small ambiguities in the Sanskrit. By breaking up Sanskrit words in different ways, Khmer poets embraced two possible meanings for their verses, with the hidden reading often revealing a sophisticated interpretation of Hindu or Buddhist philosophy. In many ways, Cambodia’s Sanskrit literature is better known outside Cambodia than its Khmer literature, having been assiduously studied and translated by generations of Cambodian, Thai, Indian, and European scholars from the late nineteenth century onward.\n\nxxviii\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nVery little classical literature written in Khmer has been available to Anglophone readers. Khmer falls into three linguistic stages: Old (seventh to fourteenth centuries), Middle (fourteenth to mid-eighteenth centuries), and Modern (mid-eighteenth century to the present). The distinctive metrical structures of Cambodian poetry have their roots in Old Khmer, but many of the key forms and meters were only developed during the Middle and early Modern phases of the language. Khmer poets refer to this versified poetry as kaby (pronounced “kap”), derived from Sanskrit kavya, meaning the style of complex literary verse used in prashasti. Though Khmer poets borrowed aesthetic concepts from Sanskrit genres, the meters they created are completely Southeast Asian in character, and best suited to the linguistic structures of Austroasiatic languages. Khmer meters are distinguished by the following features: fixed patterns of syllable counts per line, usually between four and nine; stanzas of three to seven lines each, with four being the most common; complex rhyme patterns that link together lines both within and between stanzas; and an emphasis on alliteration and other forms of assonance. These features, coupled with diverse traditions of melodic recitation, have favored the aural dimensions of Khmer poetry throughout its history. Meters (known as pad, pronounced “bot”) featured in this collection include the Narration (bamnol, “pumnol”), Brahma’s Song (brahmagiti, “prumakit”), Crow’s Gait (kakagati, “kakkate”), Serpent’s Lilt (bhujang lila, “phuchung lilea”), Four-Syllable (baky puon, “peak buon”), Seven-Syllable (baky prambir, “peak prampir”), and Eight-Syllable (baky prampi, “peak prambei”) varieties. Each meter is associated with up to a dozen or more styles of a cappella recitation. Cambodian folk and popular songs are based on the same set of meters, particularly the Four- and Seven-Syllable meters, allowing for an ever-expanding horizon of melodies to be applied to Khmer poetry. The metrical forms and musical dimensions of Khmer poetry pose a range of conundrums to the translator. How can we hope to capture in English the beauty generated through subtle arrangements of Khmer sounds and musical tones? Several approaches for literary translation are possible, each with their own merits and limitations. One, we can focus on the meaning alone and ignore the rhyme patterns and syllable counts of the Khmer. If the goal is a fluid, readable text in English, this is the most direct method, and most of the translations in this book adopt such an approach. In all but a few cases, the original stanza divisions have been respected, and in my own translations I try to maintain a regular line length and syllable count to more faithfully convey the rhythmic qualities of the original. Another approach is to ignore rhyme but still preserve the exact syllabic structure of the Khmer poem. For poems in the Crow’s Gait meter, for instance, this entails creating an unrhymed English translation of four syllables per line and seven lines per stanza. I frequently follow this method in my translations, as it makes the structural qualities of the Khmer visible to the reader without compromising too much on meaning. A third approach, represented only by\n\nWalker\n\nn\n\nCambodian Literature\n\nxxix xxix\n\n“This Life Is Short” in this collection, is to reproduce both the syllable counts and rhyme scheme in the English. The risks of this mode of translation usually outweigh the gains. But such examples do allow readers unfamiliar with Khmer to appreciate the kinds of intricate rhyme patterns that structure most of the poems composed in Cambodia up to the present. In addition to their metrical form and musical performance, the materiality of Khmer poems has also shaped their transmission and reception, particularly in the Middle and early Modern phases of the language. As I learned from Prum Ut, the key material object for the transmission of Cambodian literature has long been the manuscript, including handwritten documents in a variety of formats. We know that manuscripts were used extensively between the seventh and fifteenth centuries, but none of that age have survived Cambodia’s hot and humid climate. From the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, however, we have direct knowledge of Middle and early Modern Khmer literature from manuscript copies made in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Most of the translations of pre-twentieth-century literature in this book were made either directly from manuscripts or from academic editions based on such manuscripts. Carved on the long, pliant leaves of the talipot palm or inked on the folded pages of bark-paper manuscripts, these texts hail from a period when handwriting was king and print not yet born. Buddhist monasteries were traditionally the primary places for the creation, curation, reading, and safeguarding of both secular and religious manuscripts. These documents are thus imbued with a sacred aura. In the weeks leading up to my temporary ordination as a novice monk, Prum Ut guided me through the specific bows and gestures involved. Careless and clumsy in my practice robes, after completing one bow I lost balance and fell back on his leporello manuscript. He rebuked me, stating it was a grave misdeed to disrespect a book in this way. This reverence for manuscripts was a key factor in the preservation of old literary works well into the twentieth century. Print technology arrived late in Cambodia. The first European-style printed books appeared at the end of the nineteenth century, but print technology only fully supplanted the use of traditional manuscripts in the 1960s. Verse novels from the early twentieth century were still composed and transmitted on palm leaves or recited by itinerant bards from memory. When the modern prose novel emerged in the 1940s, it coincided with a wider availability of printed material and a burgeoning book culture in Cambodia. The Buddhist Institute in Phnom Penh played a key role in this process, publishing early-twentieth-century works by Suttantaprija Ind (Journey to Angkor Wat), Padumatther Som (Tum Teav), and Krom Ngoy (“A Garland of New Advice”). These authors, all featured in this volume, had previously only been accessible in handwritten or oral form. In contemporary Cambodia, though traditional manuscript materials have fallen out of use except in rare circumstances, the practice of hand-copying\n\nxxx\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\ncontinues. Koet Ran’s sighted husband copies down all the texts she has memorized in paper notebooks. On the rare occasions when her memory falters, he is there by her side to cue the next verse. In the 1980s, a vibrant literary world emerged from the circulation of novellas hand-copied on notebook paper, which were rented out to an eager circle of readers. As Rinith Taing’s essay in this volume describes, the practice of renting printed books continues to the present. The material basis may have shifted, but little has changed about Cambodians’ reverence and passion for literature. As documented in Phina So’s essay in this collection, spaces for the literary arts continue to flourish in Cambodia, despite the plethora of challenges. That such a thriving culture of writing exists today can hardly be taken for granted. It took a tremendous amount of effort on the part of Cambodian writers in their homeland and beyond. The tumult and tragedy of the twentieth century visited unimaginable horrors on Cambodians everywhere. Throughout these trials, writers have been punished, banished, and executed. But they have persisted in bringing pen to page and letters into song. Each year, more and more Cambodians study Old Khmer inscriptions at the Royal University of Fine Arts and other institutions. Classes and research on Khmer literature from the Middle and Modern periods are burgeoning at the Royal University of Phnom Penh, and manuscript digitization initiatives are promising unprecedented access for Cambodians hoping to read traditional forms of Khmer literature. Senior bards such as Kong Nay, master of the chapei dang veng, represented in this volume, are celebrated anew as younger songwriters find ways to incorporate traditional forms. Contemporary poets continue to push the boundaries of their craft, even as they compose in meters now hundreds of years old. Collaborations between writers in Cambodia and those in diaspora are beginning to emerge, paving new paths. Cambodian literature rests on a much deeper history than the Khmer Rouge dared to imagine, and the future looks bright. This collection is an invitation to explore, celebrate, and be moved by what Khmer writers have offered the world through the ages. note on sources, transliteration, and names We have presented the essays, contributions, and notes in the main portion of this collection entirely in Roman script and without diacritics. For students and researchers looking for more precise information, we have included two additional resources in the back matter. For complete citations of all of the pieces gathered in this volume, with Khmer and Roman script as appropriate, including diacritics, please consult the Sources in the back. For more on the authors and translators, including Khmer-script names of the relevant authors, consult About the Contributors. In presenting Khmer words in Roman script, we have followed three basic conventions: (1) respecting precedent and the choices of individual authors, (2) transcribing terms in contemporary contexts phonetically, and (3) trans-\n\nWalker\n\nn\n\nCambodian Literature\n\nxxxi\n\nliterating older terms based on the graphic system favored by scholars. Our goal is not consistency but rather making the process as straightforward as possible for both general readers and those who would like to learn more about Cambodian literature. In detail, these three conventions are as follows. First, for proper names for which a commonly accepted Roman-script version exists, such as smot, Angkor Wat, the Reamker, Krom Ngoy, or Sinn Sisamouth, we have followed conventional practice. Many contemporary Cambodian authors who write and publish primarily in Khmer have their own preferred romanization of their names, which we have followed. Second, for names and terms discussed in relation to the past one hundred years, we have used a simplified, diacritic-free version of Frank Huffman’s Franco-Khmer phonetic transcription system, itself based on common Cambodian practice during the mid-twentieth century. Most writing on contemporary Cambodian history and literature uses a variation of this system. Third, for names and terms relevant to contexts from more than one hundred years ago, we have used a diacritic-free version of the graphic transliteration system widely used by scholars of Ancient, Middle, and early Modern Cambodia. This system is not phonetic, but we use it for older words, works, and authors to make it easier for readers to follow up on such items in existing publications. When appropriate, we have also added phonetic transcriptions in quotation marks, based on the Franco-Khmer system. For terms in other languages, we have followed simplified, diacritic-free versions of a widely accepted standard, such as rtgs for Thai and iats for Pali and Sanskrit. In Cambodia, names are usually presented with the family name followed by the given name, as in “Kong Bunchhoeun.” Cambodians who publish in other languages or who live abroad in Anglophone or Francophone contexts often present their name in the Western sequence of the given name followed by the family name, as in “Kalean Ung.” We have endeavored to respect contributors’ preferences for the sequence of their names. The About the Contributors section is alphabetized by family name, marked in bold; therefore, kong bunchhoeun appears before kalean ung. To facilitate ease of reference, we have also used family names—or single personal names, in the case of many pre-twentieth-century writers—in the abbreviated footers that appear in the book. However, when discussing individual authors who write primarily in Khmer, we defer to Cambodian practice and use either full names or given names only, as in Kong Bunchhoeun or simply Bunchhoeun.\n\nxxxii\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nT H E A N L Y\n\nC H O V\n\nOil paintings from the series Surviving, by Cambodian artist Theanly Chov.

Translated from Old Khmer by Trent Walker\n\n3\n\nQ U E E N\n\nI N D R A D E V I\n\nIn Praise of Sister Queens Queen Indradevi is the earliest known female poet in Cambodia. “In Praise of Sister Queens,” inscribed in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, reveals a nearly flawless command of the Sanskrit language and its complex poetic forms; the passage here includes verses in the indravajra, vamsastha, vasantatilaka, and sloka meters. This excerpt from the great stele of Phimeanakas includes just the final twelve stanzas of a 102-stanza poem, which was discovered in the rubble of the ancient royal palace near Angkor Thom in 1916. In 1297, the Chinese emissary Zhou Daguan described a gold tower within the royal palace, presumably a reference to Phimeanakas. The inscription eulogizes Indradevi and her younger sister Jayarajadevi, both queens to Jayavarman VII, the most powerful monarch in Cambodian history and a patron of Mahayana Buddhism. tw What the last Lord of the Land built in stone— this temple, called Ornament of the Earth— Queen Jayarajadevi piously swathed in gold, making it ornament of both earth and sky. On a mountain known as Shiva’s City, she reverently raised golden icons of her three venerable masters, bedecked with gems, blazing like suns. Ever wise, she built statues across the land, images of her parents, siblings, and friends, along with her relatives and more distant kin, both those she knew and those she knew of. Even on her deathbed, bound for perfect peace, she remained devoted to her husband, the king, waiting until he’d finished his midday rites before slipping away into supreme repose.\n\n4\n\nJayarajadevi brought more joy to her people than even their own mothers, and once she passed, her elder sister Indradevi was crowned as queen, guiding the people from burning grief to peace. In every city, Indradevi erected numerous icons of her sister, herself, and her king, Jayavarman. Yet within her own palace, she cherished only the splendor of the Victorious Buddhas. Her Grace surpassed the grace of mere beauties, her Learning bested the eloquence of sophists, her Fortune’s splendor outshone all adversaries, steadily making true her own name. At the Buddhist abodes of Mountain-Chief Summit and Highest Ornament, peaks of erudition on Earth, she was named preeminent professor by the king and ceaselessly taught an array of royal women. In her lovely residence at Hermitage of the Kings, she reigned in brilliance, beloved by the Earth-Holder for her supreme learning. Adored by her students, she aided them like Saraswati made flesh. First in the city called Elephants’ Rest, then in the city named Saraswati, and at last in the capital, Yashodharapura, this half-Brahmin, half-royal girl rose to chief consort. Indradevi, who raised the king’s soles to her bowed head in respect, surpassed Ganga, who poured her river’s feet on Shiva’s crown in wrath. The queen scattered her lord’s favors, the pleasures of knowledge, among the lovely ladies of the court, who longed for learning. Wise by nature, a true savant, perfectly pure, she was true to the king, glorious Jayavarman. Having composed this perfect poem of praise, eclipsing the skills of all others, she gleamed.\n\nTranslated from Sanskrit by Trent Walker\n\nIndradevi\n\nn\n\nIn Praise\n\n5\n\nI N S C R I P T I O N\n\nHymn to the Tree of Awakening “Hymn to the Tree of Awakening” praises the bodhi tree, the sacred fig under which the Buddha awakened, and is a rare example of a Sanskrit inscription followed by a precise translation into Old Khmer. It is located in Phimeanakas, the same temple that bears the long Sanskrit poem of Queen Indradevi. tw sanskrit Your base is Brahma, your body is Shiva, your branches are Vishnu, everlasting tree! King of the forest, endowed with blessings, you give refuge to all, O giver of fruits! Neither lightning bolts nor axe blades, neither gusts of wind nor pious flames, neither rogue kings nor angry elephants: may none drag you down to destruction. Blinking eyes, twitching brows, nightmares, unsettling thoughts: O sacred fig, appease them all, be they human or divine.\n\n6\n\nkhmer O sacred tree of awakening, O you whose trunk is Lord Brahma, O you whose body is Lord Shiva, O you whose branches are Lord Vishnu, O you who will last forever, O you who are king of all trees, O you whose fortune is massive, O you who are the refuge of all worlds, O you who bear fruit in all seasons! May lightning never strike you, my Lord, may axes never fell you, may winds never snap you, may fires never burn you, may Lords of the Lower Realm never destroy you, may angry elephants never trample you. As for the ominous twitching of eyes, the ominous twitching of brows, ominous dreams, ominous thoughts—anything ominous at all, be they of heaven or humans—may you make them disappear.\n\nTranslated from Sanskrit and Old Khmer by Trent Walker\n\nInscription\n\nn\n\nHymn to the Tree\n\n7\n\nK H U N\n\nT H E P K R A W I\n\nHymn for the Elephants’ Feast “Hymn for the Elephants’ Feast” may be the oldest surviving rhymed poem in Khmer. The archaic language, transitional between Old and Middle Khmer, suggests it was based on now-lost ritual texts of the Angkorian kings. Across the region, “Hymn for the Elephants’ Feast” and similar poems would have once been recited in conjunction with royal rituals to capture wild elephants from the forest. Such elephants were essential to Southeast Asian monarchs, not only for labor and for battle but also as palladia that symbolized the potency of a king’s reign. The process of rounding up elephants in the jungle was orchestrated as an elaborate Brahmanical rite, accompanied by chants and offerings to various Hindu deities. This chant was intended to be recited at the beginning of such rituals. The first deity invoked, Ganesha, is celebrated as a remover of obstacles, and so is afforded the first spot. Son of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha is distinguished by his human body and elephant head. According to one Indian narrative, referenced obliquely in the Khmer poem, Ganesha’s ordinary human head was destroyed by Saturn, a planet and deity known for his destructive gaze. Most of the stanzas of “Hymn for the Elephants’ Feast” are devoted to Vanaspati, literally “Lord of Trees,” or brah brai in Khmer. Vanaspati is the Hindu god of the whole plant kingdom, a personification of Nature Himself. The text briefly invokes another deity, Devakarman, a powerful elephant god who serves as the symbolic leader of the flesh-and-blood elephants rounded up during the ritual. The feast of offerings to Devakarman and his pachyderm troops is regarded as a gift to Vanaspati, the ultimate ruler of the jungles where the elephants live. Very little is known about Khun Thepkrawi (a court title meaning “divine poet”), the author or editor to whom most manuscripts ascribe this text. He was said to come from the northern Siamese city of Sukhothai, which flourished as an independent kingdom in the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries before its absorption into Ayutthaya. The structure of Khun Thepkravi’s version of “Hymn for the Elephants’ Feast” alternates between portions in Brahma’s Song meter and others in the Narration meter. The English translation uses these changes in meter as a basis for dividing the poem into discrete sections. Given the difficulties and uncertainties in the text and its transmission, the trans­lation is necessarily speculative in some passages. The deep Brahmanical erudition and keen poetic sense of the author are readily apparent, however. tw 8\n\nHomage to you, Ganesha, made of space and heaven, victor over Lalita and her lunar goddesses. Please, O Lord, destroy all obstacles and binds; cut our karmic knots to keep us well and free. May you, Ganesha, mighty Lord of Elements, practice your harsh penance to conquer all the spheres. Long ago, Lord Shiva transformed you, his dear son, from a magic boy into the Lord of All His Hosts. O Saturn, fiercest planet, don’t come out at dusk. Take your path across the sky, but don’t intersect too much; your deadly stare might fell Ganesha’s head once again. Wet with creeks and rivers, streaming, splashing, and surging beneath the wide-mouthed heavens and the dazzling solar orb, soaring high in lofty beauty, alive since ancient time— Nature Himself, Vanaspati, shines with striking splendor. The charm of the Lord of Trees, Vanaspati, exceeds all other gods. I praise him with these words and foods both fine and coarse. Vanaspati sprouts high and low, in ponds, in lakes, and rushing streams, their sparkling flows now hushed, for soon a king shall come. Devakarman, King of the Elephants, lead your troops across the woods, where sounds echo all around! We offer this fish, this flesh, this rice and wine for you to consume, in worship of Vanaspati. Candles, incense, puffed rice, and flowers are gifts for Nature Himself, above all lesser gods. In glades and mountain crags, swift winds burst forth; trees sough in lovely tunes. High on the towering peaks, you shine, Vanaspati, your figure white as snow. Hear the hymns of birds, who praise you day by day. Fierce rains pour down; gales blow in concert with reed flutes. Barbet calls and cicada cries pierce through the wild din. Rain roars ten thousand sounds, more sonorous than horns; oboes play old plaintive tunes to please Vanaspati. An orchestra of gongs resounds with martial beats, with bugles and pounding drums to rouse the Lord from sleep. Quiet grow the trees, some great, some small, in clusters and long rows. The thick air swells with birds in songful choirs, as roosters crow, forlorn.\n\nThepkrawi\n\nn\n\nHymn for the Elephants\n\n9\n\nOwls hoot and eagles screech as they swoop down to take their verdant perches. The woods erupt in cries, the trees alive with sound; cacophony breaks out. At midday, peacocks scream and small beasts flee, leaping from cliff and cleft. By evening, partridges warble and wail—how shrill and sorrowful! Your grace and glory, Vanaspati, outshines all other gods. We praise you with this hymn—please take our gifts, O Lord of Trees! Protect His Majesty, our earthly king; may he reign for years to come. Help him secure success on the throne and thrive throughout a long life.\n\nTranslated from Old Khmer by Trent Walker\n\n10\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nE P I C\n\nfrom Reamker The Reamker (Ramakerti, “The Glory of Rama”) is the title given to the Khmer versions of the Ramayana. The most famous version, Reamker I: Early Episodes, is also the oldest extant recension, having been composed in Middle Khmer during the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. Of its twenty-one episodes, the first two are translated here. Much of the remaining narrative is found only in the eighteenth-century text Reamker II: Later Episodes. Both were likely composed for shadow-puppet theater. A number of other versions of the Reamker have survived in oral traditions, typically in prose. Whether performed on the stage or recited in village festivals, the Reamker remains one of the most beloved pieces of classical literature in contemporary Cambodia. The first episode introduces us to the might of Prince Rama (pronounced “Ream” in modern Khmer), known to Cambodians as both an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu and a previous incarnation of the Buddha. The episode narrates Rama’s slaying of a demon who disrupts a ritual at his teacher Vishvamitra’s forest hermitage. The second episode begins with the birth of Sita, discovered in a furrow in a plowed field by her father, King Janaka of Mithila. Janaka holds a contest, offering Sita in marriage to anyone who can lift a magic bow. After all the other gods fail, Vishvamitra calls for Rama to try his hand; he wins easily. The poetic sensibility of the Reamker, particularly Reamker I, is among the finest in all of Khmer literature. The diction is by turns graceful and arresting. The emotions of humans and gods are more restrained than in Reamker II, but compelling nonetheless. tw episode i: rama slays the demon kakana I tell of when the prince of seers, Vishvamitra, was most pleased. Great as the greatest kings, he sat sealed within the walls and carved columns of his high-vaulted hall, a place of pure penance. Beyond these sacrificial grounds, where blazing pennants waved, fire-red leaves filled the woods, spreading refreshing shade. Fresh streams cascaded down to cleanse the poisoned stones\n\n11\n\nwith sparkling-clear waters that splashed over tiny falls. Amidst the hermits’ cells grew areca and coconut, their trunks arrayed in rows, their yields fit to be plucked. All kind of trees—kruc, kray, pangau, phniev, plus sragam, guy, and krasamn— grew thick and lush, laden with fruits that grant undying life. Atop their limbs, timid squirrels hid from civets and apes, as throngs of gibbons swung in joy from branch to branch. Now at that time there was a demon named Kakana. When conches blew for Vishvamitra to start his rite, she used her powers to change into a crafty crow. Swooping in to peck at the burnt oblations, she made much noise, her piercing squawks filling the air. Flowers, palm fronds, and flags fell down as she scampered away. Rama’s holy teacher, Vishvamitra, mighty hermit, ablaze with powers, virtues, and sacred writ, had made offerings to seal his potent vows. He saw the vile demon disturb his ritual and said, “I’ll call for my godsons, the two princes, Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana. This snag shall be resolved once I speak with the sons of the great king Dasharatha. I’ll then perfect my powers on the Lord Buddha’s path, with incantations drawn from deep within the old scriptures, to make Rama and Lakshmana endowed with strength, filled with ascetic fire such that victory burns bright.” “O Rama!” he cried out, “O Lakshmana! Come quick, for the auspicious hour now draws near!” The royal seer led Prince Rama and his brother to the ashram’s platform for sacred rites to craft a mighty bow infused with spells. “Rama and Lakshmana, you whose power beats all! Shoot off this arrow toward that demon Kakana. Make known the massive might of Dasharatha’s sons!” Lord Rama nocked a lone arrow and loosed it toward the demoness. Kakana fell at once, collapsing lifelessly. Yet Rama’s magic bolt kept on, as she fell down and down to the nagas’ nether abyss, as she fell down and down, through every realm, till the arrow pursued her to the death.\n\n12\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nepisode ii: rama wins sita ’ s hand in marriage I tell of an auspicious day in May when Janaka, dutiful king of Mithila, summoned his men to turn the earth to please the people with a rite of old. He grasped the golden plow, his oxen proud as lions. When he reached the Yamuna, a golden girl emerged upon a jeweled lotus, her purity beyond compare. The king was filled with joy for his divine issue. The overlord of Mithila corralled his troops to make a swift return to the palace. He brought along the gorgeous nymph, as if she had emerged from his own core. Arriving home to keep his people’s peace, the king announced a rite to name this child. She was to be Sita—“furrow” or “white”— since her body shone brighter than the moon. The king gazed out on his daughter’s fine form, her elegance unmatched in the heavens. With his wisdom, the king intoned a spell, enchanting a bow with this solemn vow: “I shall give my precious Sita to the most mighty god.” With that, the ten directions shook. The heavens quaked, waking the hosts of gods. All of the deities who lived in realms above then hurried to descend from their abodes: Indra, shining with brilliant rays, atop the elephant king; Lord Fire, blazing with fervent force, atop his fierce rhinoceros; Lord Wind, the sky filled with his gusts, atop his rake of colts; Lord Rain, titan of all the sparkling seas, atop his serpent ride; Candrakumara, awash with gold, atop his fine peacock; Brahma, bound by his vows, atop the king of swans; Nerirati, powered by pure penance, atop a fierce ogre;\n\nEpic\n\nn\n\nReamker\n\n13\n\nVaishravana, most mighty lord, atop his palace in the sky; Shiva, beyond all the three realms, his body packed with violent force, atop his fearsome bull. These gods and kings soon saw the magic bow and one by one measured their proper strength. But none could lift the bow, and so sat down in sad defeat. The sage Vishvamitra thought of Vishnu, Rama himself— by his colossal strength might that bow be lifted yet. As Shiva and the other gods prepared to return home, Vishvamitra brought Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila. Rama went at once to tell the king he wished to try the bow. Janaka replied, “Please demonstrate the mark of your prowess.” Lord Rama beamed, seeing that gods and kings had failed. He, too, would test his might, with sages as witness. Immensely strong, he showed his power, second to none— he lifted the great bow! All gods and men within the spheres rejoiced, offering unending praise of Rama’s might. He nocked a bolt out of sheer strength, and drew the bow till it curved round, fringed by his shapely hands. King Janaka, having witnessed Rama’s rare feat, was overjoyed and blessed the great victor. He gave precious Sita, the perfect girl, in homage to the Lord.\n\nTranslated from Middle Khmer by Trent Walker\n\n14\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nB R A H\n\nS U G A N D H\n\nCode of Old Sayings Didactic poetry is the foundation of Middle Khmer literature. Prior to the twentieth century, the first texts young students learned to read were cpap (pronounced today as “chbap” ): short, aphoristic poems aimed at moral edification. This influential example of the genre, attributed to a sixteenth- or seventeenth-century monk styled Brah Sugandh, strings concrete images and pithy instructions into a garland of memorable verse. tw Here go the old sayings: you’re blind to your own faults yet make mountains out of the minor flaws of others. In the forest of wild beasts, you call friends to join the hunt, but once the honey’s found, you sneak back home and eat it all alone. You get some yet want more. You search but don’t reflect. You look at others, yet see only your own face.\n\nƒ You’re served the finest food, but fail to chew it well. You mistake all you see: Cham for Pnong, Chong for Kuoy, grandpa for grandma, your son for your nephew, two things when one will do, and sorrow for pure bliss. Unshaven with a monk’s robe, eyes closed before a mirror, a horse becomes an ass, an elephant a mouse.\n\nƒ These are the words of old. Reflect on them to see clearly. Don’t mix up ponds and roads; you’ll get mired in the mud. The wise uphold these ageless words: follow precedent. Don’t choose a violent path—the ancients warn against it.\n\n15\n\nThese words come from the past; you ought to ponder them. Don’t go around showing off, thinking you’re all that. Sleep at night, don’t sleep in, lest scandal come your way. Don’t stuff yourself with food; save enough for others.\n\nƒ Only lift what you can carry, or you’ll throw out your back. Employ others with kindness; avoid endless complaints. Take your time, don’t rush; think things through before you act. That’s the best way to avoid infamy and disgrace. Don’t mistake raw for cooked; civilization has its rules. Don’t think you’re so smart you can disregard the past. Prepare your words with care; don’t take the easy path. Be still, scan wide, peer deep; look out for blind spots.\n\nƒ The ancient ones advised: don’t try to raise tigers. They spoke in metaphor: if you act, do it right— grasp a snake’s neck tight, lest it whip back to bite. Drag your boat, but not the mud; leave waters unclouded. Leaves don’t move on their own; they’re shaken by the wind. Clear waters, if made cloudy, must have been churned by waves.\n\nƒ Don’t subjugate the weak; bring them into the fold. If rich, don’t trample the poor; learn to step carefully. For the rich protect the poor, like cloth covers skin; the wise shield the unschooled, like a junk a little sampan. The high protect the low, per ancient law. The full feed the hungry, the strong defend the meek. Take care of one another, without any sense of obligation, for all ages to come, since even hedges need their thorns.\n\n16\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nƒ Don’t seek your fill alone, forgetting that so many mouths wail in hunger; feed them till they’re full. Don’t be so vain as to cross a stream on a crocodile’s back. Don’t chop down your own fence just to cook a pot of rice. To set sail, you’ll need lines, push poles, anchors, paddles, thole pins, and mooring bollards—you’ll need every last part. To guard against a storm and fend off mighty waves, take note of every detail—this is called true care.\n\nƒ You ought to bear in mind these old words of advice; what the sages said is worth some deep thought. These are your instructions to keep as your sure code. Hold to them fast and firm, secure them without fail. Here ends my recital of these timeless words. Keep them in mind, take them to heart, memorize them well. Keep these sayings on your lips, oh good people, don’t forget! May their meanings long endure; this poem is now complete.\n\nTranslated from Middle Khmer by Trent Walker\n\n15\n\nSugandh\n\nn\n\nCode\n\n17\n\nB R A H\n\nR A J A S A M B H A R\n\nMy Soul of Gold According to Cambodian chronicles, the Khmer king Brah Rajasambhar (pronounced today as “Preah Reachsamphear,” also known as Dhammaraja II) died in 1631. “My Soul of Gold,” like most of his surviving poems, was written for Princess Pupphavati, his great love. When he abdicated the throne, his uncle took her as a consort. The lovers were long separated, and when they secretly reunited, the new king sent soldiers after them; they were shot dead in remote Kratie province. Most of Brah Rajasambhar’s works were thought to be lost. In 2016, while recataloging Khmer manuscripts in the British Library, I came across a magnificent set of bark-paper manuscripts; all were dated to the 1830s. Purchased in Southeast Asia by a British official, they sat in the British Museum for decades before being transferred to the British Library. One of these manuscripts contains a robust collection of Brah Rajasambhar’s romantic poetry, including “My Soul of Gold.” What follows here is not only the first translation of the poem, but also the first complete publication of this text. The four-syllable, seven-line Crow’s Gait meter of the Khmer is largely retained, though without the original rhymes. tw My soul of gold! Midday has passed, the sun descends across the sky, swept clear of clouds by a fresh breeze, calm ripples of wind. My soul of gold! When drafts would blow, I’d hold you close, my dear princess, on your soft bed, your face a mirror, as bright as faith.\n\n18\n\nMy soul of gold! Afternoon fades. Birds fly in flocks, circling in rings. Calls fill the air, echos resound across the sky. My soul of gold! I hear the birds, their coos and caws just like the sweet and honeyed tones of your words, love, when we’re alone. My soul of gold! Evening arrives. The trees grow lush in verdant rows, their branches wide. Their fine bouquets pervade the air. My soul of gold! A soft breeze blows, infused with flowers, just like your scent: exquisitely yours, expanding outward, extending over all. My soul of gold! The sun is setting behind the woods. How sad and strange: birds circle above, then drop to the trees to preen and cry. My soul of gold! I listen as birds erupt in song. Some swoop and dive, some weep and wail,\n\nRajasambhar\n\nn\n\nMy Soul\n\n19\n\nsome pause and perch near their partners. My soul of gold! The sun has set and slipped away. I wait for you, for your beauty brings to blossom flowers in your hair. My soul of gold! I’ve searched across the worldly plane, yet none can match your radiance, a light that blazes brighter than fire. My soul of gold! Now twilight falls, the sun is gone, but feelings remain. Wind sweeps the skies and all shines clear. White clouds retreat. My soul of gold! Twilight has come, the sun’s rays hide. How bright the moon: its disc soars high. Soft light scatters and darkness glows. My soul of gold! The moon glimmers, chief of the stars. When all is hushed, birdsong carries. A rustling wind douses the dusk. My soul of gold! Evening arrives.\n\n20\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nThe moon orbits around the pole of Mount Meru, its slopes gleaming with lunar light. My soul of gold! Moonbeams shimmer. I see your face, perfect and round, bejeweled by gems of twinkling stars far from the earth. My soul of gold! Nighttime has come. The moon grows full, its orb enwrapped by constellations, as the lone lord of starry skies. My soul of gold! Here in this world, there’s only you, my golden friend. Your skin exudes the finest bliss in realms of lust. My soul of gold! Midnight is near. A tender breeze caresses me, a rush of cool as floral scents perfume the air. My soul of gold! At such moments my love would swell. We’d sing as one, in search of bliss, our bodies joined to the same tune.\n\nRajasambhar\n\nn\n\nMy Soul\n\n21\n\nMy soul of gold! Peals of thunder rock me in waves, as if you were here, our limbs entwined, murmuring nothings to draw out the time. My soul of gold! I long to share your silk pillow. Why have you gone so far away? Doesn’t your love move you like mine? My soul of gold! Midnight is here. I hear the birds call out and cry. Their sounds echo throughout the cold and sunless dark. My soul of gold! At times like these birds find their mates. Why must I stay, loveless, alone, broken from you, shattered inside? My soul of gold! Your body fills my memories, my mind scattered by winds and wings, their fresh refrains a shower of tones. My soul of gold! Midnight gives way to the wee hours. Your face haunts me. I long, my pith,\n\n22\n\nMānoa\n\nn\n\nOut of the Shadows of Angkor\n\nfor inner bliss in your embrace. My soul of gold! In the small hours, I yearn for you. Absent your care, my heart stops dead. Why break the ring that rounds our love? My soul of gold! The late hours fade and first light looms. The birds fall quiet. How many more turns of night and day must I still wait?\n\nTranslated from Middle Khmer by Trent Walker\n\nRajasambhar\n\nn\n\nMy Soul\n\n23\n\nC H A N T\n\nVictory in the Eight Directions This is one of the oldest vernacular chants still performed in Cambodia. Part of a group of Pali and vernacular blessing texts that surfaced in the sixteenth or seventeenth century across mainland Southeast Asia, the chant is frequently sung today at weddings and other auspicious occasions. The martial tone suggests that its original purpose was different: to bless Cambodian troops preparing for battle. Today it is recited by monks in a spare, haunting melody that gradually increases in intensity. The composition itself uses an extended form of the Narration meter, in which the usual six-four-six syllable arrangement is jettisoned in favor of longer lines. To capture the martial rhythm of the original, this English translation is rendered into blank verse. Although the first line of the text is in Pali and explicitly Buddhist, the otherwise Khmer text of “Victory in the Eight Directions” presents a rare reflection of Cambodia’s diverse religious heritage, with Hindu deities such as Shiva and Vishnu receiving special emphasis. tw Our Lord Buddha is the Fount of All Boons. We bow down low to the holy Three Jewels. We seek to win, we long for magic might, we pray, O Shiva, to trounce, to best, to beat. Bless us, O gods, O gods of the East! Fly here in flocks, our heads beneath your feet. Bless us, O gods, O gods of the Southeast! Summon your troops, soldiers by the thousands. Bless us, O gods, O gods of the South! Gather here as one and guard our good fortune. Bless us, O gods, O gods of the Southwest! Grant us the force of your trials and your tests. Bless us, O gods, O gods of the West! Guard us and keep us and seal our success. Bless us, O gods, O gods of the Northwest! Rally, rank and file; cheer us with joy and mirth.\n\n24\n\nBless us, O gods, O gods of the North! Come, join as one; increase our wealth and ease. Bless us, O gods, O gods of the Northeast! Descend from on high to hand us happiness. Bless us, O Vishnu, refuge of mankind! Bless us, O Shiva, lord of all creatures! Bless us, O Indra, from your high heaven! Bless us, O Brahma, from formless realms! Bless us, O gods, who gather all around: gods of the earth, who raise our very feet, gods of the sea, and gods of Himavant, the jungle maze of fruit, brute, and beast. Bless us, O gods, from every source and point: you who dwell in soils, in homes, and in haunts, perched high on tree crowns, crags, and crests. Lead us, O gods, lead us onward to victory! Give us the power to crush their whole army. Vanquish our foes! Make them shrink in fright. Ward off bane and bale; keep death out of sight.\n\nTranslated from Pali and Middle Khmer by Trent Walker\n\nChant\n\nn\n\nVictory\n\n25\n\nT R A D I T I O N A L\n\nO A T H\n\nGoddesses of the Land This legal document, simply titled pranidhan (truthful vow), has been dated to 1693 ce.
