The king intended to build a capital for his new Chakri dynasty. He moved the seat of power from the city of Thonburi, on the west side of the Chao Phraya River, to the east side of Bangkok. The new capital was transformed into an artificial island when canals were dug along the east side.\n\nThe complex is situated on a rectangular plot covering an area of 218,000 m² and is surrounded by 4 walls measuring 1900 meters in length. There are 12 gates on the outer walls. Inside the palace, there were more than 22 gates and a maze of inner walls; however, some of them have already been demolished. Around the outer walls are also 17 small forts.\n\nA LITTLE OF HISTORY…\n\nThe palace was initially built entirely of wood, with several structures surrounded by a simple log palisade. In the following years, the king began to replace wooden structures with masonry, rebuilding walls, forts, gates, throne rooms and royal residences. This reconstruction included the royal chapel, which would later house the Emerald Buddha. Over successive reigns, many new buildings and structures were added, including numerous buildings, halls, pavilions around lawns, gardens, and open courtyards. Its asymmetry and eclectic styles are due to its growth over time, with additions and reconstructions being made by successive reigning kings throughout 200 years of history.\n\nThe Grand Palace is divided into several areas: the Temple of the Emerald Buddha; O Outer Court, with many public buildings; O middle court, including the buildings of Phra Monthien, Phra Maha Prasad and Chakri Manha Prasad; O inner court and the Siwalai Gardens. The Grand Palace Bangkok functioned as the official residence of the King of Thailand until 1925. Even today, the palace is used for official events, royal ceremonies and other state functions.\n\nTHE TEMPLE OF THE EMERALD BUDDHA\n\ncommonly known as Wat Phra Sri Rattana Satsadaram or Wat Phra Kaew, The Temple of the Emerald Buddha was built by King Rama I in 1782. It is considered the holiest buddhist temple in thailand. This temple is located in the Outer Palace area and houses the Emerald Buddha. The tradition of building a Buddhist temple on the outskirts of the royal palace has existed in Thailand since the Sukhothai period, around 800 years ago. The unique aspect of the royal temple in the palace, like this temple, is that it has no quarters for Buddhist monks. The temple is located within the walls of the Grand Palace and is made up of a series of buildings and monuments. The main building of the temple is a chapel that houses the statue of the Emerald Buddha.\n\nTHE EMERALD BUDDHA\n\nThe Emerald Buddha is the most important Buddha image in Thailand. The image was carved from a single block of jade, not emerald as the name suggests. The image is dark green, carved in a meditation position, measures 66 cm high and includes a 48 cm wide base. Historical records date back to its discovery in the 15th century in Chiang Rai, where, after being relocated several times, it was finally taken to Thailand in the 18th century. The image was enshrined in Bangkok at Wat Phra Kaew Temple in 1782. No one other than the Thai King and Crown Prince can touch the statue.\n\nThey exist three different Emerald Buddha costumes: one for the summer, one for the rainy season and one for the winter. The first two costumes were made from nothing during the reign of King Rama I and the winter costume was made during the reign of Rama III. All costumes were produced with another and jewelry. The ceremony to change the Emerald Buddha attire therefore takes place at the beginning of each of the three seasons and aims to bring good luck to the country during each season. The mural painting on the wall behind the Emerald Buddha represents the scene of Buddhist cosmology, while the front shows the scene of the Buddha's enlightenment.\n\nPHRA ASADHA MAHA CHEDI\n\nOn the side of the temple are 8 prang (tall tower resembling an antenna) that were built during the reign of King Rama I. Prang serves as a monument of veneration. Each of them has different colors and is dedicated to a certain Buddhist concept.\n\nRAMAKIEN GALLERY AND STORY\n\nThere is a gallery that surrounds all the temple buildings that feature wall paintings depicting the story of Ramakien, the Thai version of the Indian epic Ramayana. This story tells the battle between Tosakanth, who is the king of demons, and King Rama. Tosakanth kidnaps Queen Sida, wife of King Rama, and takes her to the city of Longka, where he hopes she will fall in love with him. In the ensuing battle, Tosakanth is defeated and King Rama takes Sida back to Ayodhaya, his capital. The painting consists of 178 sections. The first figure is located exactly in front of Spired Hall and they go clockwise.\n\nHOW TO BUY TICKETS FOR THE GRAND PALACE\n\nUntil recently, the only way to buy tickets to the Grand Palace was to face long lines.

It is prohibited to use: sleeveless blouses, blouses that show the belly, see-through or low-cut blouses, bermudas, shorts, ripped pants, tights, leggings, gym clothes and mini skirts. It is necessary that the blouse covers the shoulders and that you are wearing long pants or a skirt that covers the knees in the case of women. Bring a scarf to cover yourself if you are unsure about your outfit. Men can borrow pants on site. Paulo wore those pants that turn into shorts that open with a zipper.\n\nIMPORTANT: It's needed take off your shoes to enter the Emerald Buddha Chapel. Wear shoes that are easy to put on and, if barefoot, a wet wipe to wipe your feet before putting them back on (your feet will be black with dirt!). You can leave your shoes right at the entrance of the temple, on one of the available shelves or keep your shoes in a plastic bag inside your backpack or purse.\n\nHOW TO GET TO THE GRAND PALACE BANGKOK\n\nCheck below the main ways to get to the Grand Palace Bangkok by public transport. If you don't want to use any of them, you can still take a taxi or call a Grab (Thailand Uber) to get there.\n\n>> SUBWAY + BOAT\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get to the Grand Palace is via the subway system in Bangkok, known as BTS. Take the Silom Line (green line) to the station Saphan Taksin, also known as station S6. Take exit number 2 and look for the dock Chao Phraya Express Boat. Pay close attention to look for the Express Boat because at the pier there are also boats that do private tours and will try to convince you to hire a more expensive transport.\n\nO Chao Phraya Express Boat it's not just a way to get to the Grand Palace, but also an interesting experience, with plenty of stops along the way to see other places in the city. The boat has several routes; the routes \"orange flag” (15 Baht), “green flag” (from 13 Baht) and “no flag” (from 9 Baht) lead to the Grand Palace. see rates here. Whatever the route, get off at stop #9, which is the Tha Chang Pier. From there, it will take you between 5 and 10 minutes to walk to the entrance to the Grand Palace Bangkok.\n\n>> TRAIN + BUS\n\nAnother way to get there is via the surface train (known as MRT). There is no station very close, so you will have to take the Blue line get down on Hua Lamphong Station and go out through exit 4 towards Bangkok Center Hotel. From there you will need to take the bus number 25 or 53. If you want, you can walk, but the walk takes about 50 minutes.\n\n>> BOAT\n\nPick it express boat for Tha Thien (stop number 8) at some pier along the Chao Phraya River. Once you disembark, go past the food stalls until you reach a large T-junction. Opposite (slightly to the right) is the Grand Palace.\n\n>> BUS\n\nthe lines that pass directly opposite the Grand Palace or very close are as follows: 1, 3, 9, 15, 25, 30, 32, 33, 43, 44, 47, 53, 59, 64, 80, 82, 91, 203, 503, 508, 512.\n\nENTRY TO THE GRAND PALACE\n\nRegardless of how you arrive at the Grand Palace, all visitors will need to go through the metal detector installed in a square next to the building.\n\nThen everyone walks to an entrance (which is next to the Queen Sirikit Museum of Textiles) in which inspectors are checking people's clothes that are coming in. I saw a girl being refused entry because she was wearing a strapless blouse with a sheer scarf on top. So if you don't want to get in trouble, dress appropriately.\n\nOnly after that do you have access to the Grand Palace ticket office. As I already had a ticket, I was guided by a very polite and helpful employee to direct me to a ticket window to collect the tickets before starting to visit the place.\n\nTIPS FOR VISIT THE GRAND PALACE\n\nBefore starting the attractions of the Grand Palace complex, I would like to give you some tips so that you have a pleasant visit to the place. I had already read a lot about some setbacks that could arise and I was trying to eliminate most of them. I bought tickets over the internet to avoid standing in line (I had already seen reports of people who stayed more than 1 hour to buy at the physical box office). I knew about the intense heat (even in the Thai “winter”) and the surreal number of tourists who visit the place daily. I thought about the clothes (comfortable and appropriate), the bag/backpack, the equipment, the water to hydrate ourselves during the tour, etc. But Paulo was not psychologically prepared for all this and was very uncomfortable with the excessive heat combined with a crowd of people.\n\nReally, it's hard to keep a good mood with the discomfort of walking through a scorching sun combined with a cramped environment, full of tourists almost jostling each other. A tip that may help but is not guaranteed is arrive at Grand Palace Bangkok at 8am, at opening time (or in the late afternoon, just before closing). Perhaps at these times the temperatures are milder and the volume of people is better. We left the hotel at 9 am and arrived around 10 am at the Grand Palace and by this time the place was already chaotic. So prepare yourself psychologically to face adversity and marvel at the incredible buildings you will find there.\n\nWHAT TO VISIT IN THE GRAND PALACE COMPLEX\n\nThe map below gives an idea of what you will find during your visit to the Grand Palace Bangkok. You can already tell that there is a lot in the complex, right? Next, we will highlight some of the main attractions of the palace, which you should prioritize during your visit. Generally, people spend up to 2 hours seeing the attractions of the Grand Palace.\n\nIMPORTANT: O Temple of the Emerald Buddha consists of the buildings numbered from 1 to 12 on the map above, which are inside a walled area. To access them it is necessary to show the ticket and a part of it will be highlighted at the time of entry. Re-entering this area is not permitted if you leave to explore other areas of the Grand Palace. The tip is to start there (prepare to meet a lot of people along the way) and then visit the other areas before leaving.\n\nRead more: Thailand: What to do in Bangkok – 3, 4 or 5 day itinerary\n\n1 & 2.

HOR PHRA NAGA\n\nThe original building, built by King Rama I to enshrine the image of Phra Naga, was made of copper alloy with an image of Buddha. However, in the reign of King Rama III, the need arose for a very large building to house the ashes of the deceased members of the present dynasty. King Rama III had the original building torn down and built the new Hor Phra Naga with the aim of preserve the ashes of deceased princes and princesses. The image of Phra Naga was transferred to Phra Wiharn Yod, but the king still retains the old name of Hor Phra Naga to this day.\n\n5.

King Mongkut or King Rama IV had it built for their subjects to see what the Khmer ruins looked like. The original Angor Wat in Cambodia was built by King Suryavarman II. The real one is very large, about 1,000 meters long and 800 meters wide.\n\n7. PHRA MONDOP\n\nBuilt during the reign of King Rama I in 1789 with the aim of being a library Buddhist.

It was built by King Rama IV in 1856. Initially, the king wanted to move the Emerald Buddha from the main chapel to this building. But after the building was finished, it was too small to hold any ceremony. For this reason, it was left empty. Later, King Rama V moved a small golden stupa from the Sivalai Garden inside the Grand Palace into this building. However, in 1903, a fire broke out on the roof of The Royal Pantheon, and after the restoration by King Rama VI was completed, the king turned this building into the Royal Pantheon of all the ancient kings of Bangkok. Currently, eight statues of previous kings are enshrined within this building.\n\n10.

These demon statues were erected during the reign of King Rama III. Each is an important character in the Rammakian story, the most important story in the reign of King Rama I.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, you must take off your shoes before entering the Chapel of the Emerald Buddha. Also, it is forbidden to take pictures inside the temple, but we did take a picture of the Emerald Buddha (with a lot of zoom on the camera) from the outside area.\n\n11.
