        "text": "In July of the year 1824, the Siamese King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, Rama II, suddenly became very ill and died not long after.\n\nAccording to the royal law of succession, the throne should pass to Queen Suriyandra's son, Prince mongkut. Queen Suriyandra was the consort of King Rama II and according to Siamese royal traditions, only the sons of a royal consort are eligible to succeed a king.\n\nRama III\n\nHowever, Prince Mongkut had been ordained as a monk in a monastery earlier that year. The young prince was inexperienced in politics and had little influence among the nobles of the time. Prince Jessadabodindra, though the son of a concubine, was much more powerful and had the support of the courtiers. He was older than Prince Mongkut and had served as Minister of Trade and Foreign Relations during his father's reign. When King Rama II died, a council of nobles immediately declared that Prince Jessadabodindra would be the new king of Siam (Rama III).\n\nVajirayan\n\nPrince Mongkut chose to remain in monastic life after his half-brother's coronation to avoid political confrontation. As a monk, Prince Mongkut became known by his Buddhist name Vajirayan. He traveled all over the country studying Buddhism and speaking with prominent monks\n\nIn 1833, Vajirayan became abbot of Bowonniwet Temple, located in what is now central Bangkok. During this time he studied Western sciences, Latin, English and astronomy. He often had very long conversations with Western missionaries and travelers and became very proficient in the English language.\n\nPrince Chatumani\n\nPrince Mongkut had a younger brother, Prince Chutamani. Like him, Prince Chutamani was also passed over as a candidate for the throne when King Rama II died. Unlike Prince Mongkut, who remained in the temple throughout King Jessadabodindra's reign, Prince Chutamani chose to serve the government. He was awarded the title of Kromma Khun Isaret rankant.\n\nLike his brother, the young prince loved all things western. He was deeply interested in Western mechanics, technology and science, and his proficiency in English was reportedly even better than that of his brother, Prince Mongkut.\n\nRama III dies\n\nOn April 2, 1851, King Rama III died without appointing a successor. Although Rama III had at least 50 children, none of the king's wives were elevated to the status of queen.\n\nDis Bunnak, the minister of defense and one of the most powerful nobles at the time, suggested that the council of nobles invite Prince Mongkut to take the throne. After all, he was the son of King Rama II with a royal consort and was first in line of succession. There was a problem, however, as Prince Chutamani had as legitimate a claim to the throne as Prince Mongkut. At the time of King Rama III's death, some nobles claimed that Prince Chutamani was the heir presumptive, but Prince Mongkut was the elder brother, so his claim was stronger.\n\nBranch IV\n\nWhen Prince Mongkut was 47 years old, he left monastic life to rule as king. Prince Mongkut was crowned King of Siam on April 2, 1851, taking the title of Phrabat Somdet Phra Chomklao Chaoyuhua, Rama IV.\n\nTo avoid a conflict with his younger brother, Prince Chutamani, King Rama IV did something quite unprecedented in Siamese history. He allowed his brother to ascend the throne as \"second king\" of Siam. He was given the title of Phrabat Somdet Phra Pinklao Chaoyuhua, equivalent to his own.\n\nUparaj\n\nIn the past, the position of Viceroy, Uparaj van Siam, usually given to the king's brother. In the line of succession, the Uparaj was therefore the presumptive successor. But it was always recognized that the Uparaj is the second man after the king.\n\nHowever, Prince Chutamani was not given the title of Uparaj. He was asked by his brother to accept a title equivalent to Rama IV, the crowned king of Siam. For the first time in Siamese history, there were two crowned kings of Siam.\n\nAstrology\n\nSome historians speculate that King Mongkut was a strong believer in astrology. Astrological predictions and signals would have shown that Prince Chutamani would become the king. It was therefore this belief of Rama IV that led to Chatumani's promotion to Siam's second king. Others speculate that it was merely a clever move to appease and discourage Prince Chutamani from taking a defiant position against his brother.\n\nStrengthened relationship\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that the coronation of King Pinklao strengthened the relationship between the two brothers, which was peaceful throughout his reign. In practice, King Mongkut was the kingdom's highest authority, but King Pinklao was influential in foreign affairs due to his close ties to Western diplomats.\n\nKing Pinklao maintained his own army, as well as a navy of some modern ships. His palace became known as the 'Front Palace' and his power was constantly expanded during that period.\n\nKing Pinklao died on January 7, 1866, two years before King Mongkul passed away.\n\nSource: Anand Singh article in the Phuket Gazette"
