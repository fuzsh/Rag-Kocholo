        "text": "While Thailand operates under a constitutional monarchy, the monarchy holds significant influence. Any legal changes in Thailand must have the endorsement of Thai Chakri monarchs. Moreover, citizens are prohibited from criticizing or speaking ill of the monarchy and members of the royal family. How does the monarchy influence the spiritual, economic, and cultural aspects of Thai life? Let's delve into the article together with Mytour.\n\n1. Overview of the Thai Chakri dynasty\n\nFollowing the coronation of King Rama X, the Thai Chakri dynasty has garnered significant attention from the country's populace. How many Thai Chakri monarchs have there been? How was the Chakri dynasty established? How many years has it endured? All these questions will be thoroughly answered in the following article.\n\nThai Chakri monarchs throughout history (Image Source: Compiled)\n\nThe Chakri dynasty was established from 1782 until now, spanning 242 years of history. Before King Rama X ascended the throne in 2019, the Thai Chakri dynasty had seen 9 reigns.\n\nAfter the complete downfall of the Ayutthaya kingdom, a Siamese general named Taksin rose to the throne. Taksin the Great was the sole king of the Thonburi Kingdom. Following a coup in 1782, King Taksin was deposed. General Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok seized power and founded the Chakri dynasty. He took the title Rama I (King of Kings).\n\nSince then, the entire land of Thailand has been under the rule of the Chakri dynasty to this day. Upon ascending the throne, King Rama I decided to relocate the capital to the east bank of the Chao Phraya River. Later, this area developed into the bustling metropolis of Bangkok.\n\nIf King Rama I laid the foundation for a prosperous nation, then Rama II was the one who promoted and developed culture. By the time of King Rama III, he endeavored to establish peaceful relations with Western powers to avoid the fate of invasion faced by neighboring countries.\n\n2. Thai Chakri monarchs governing the nation\n\n2.1 Rama I: King Phra Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (1737-1809)\n\nYodfa Chulaloke was the first king to establish the Chakri dynasty in 1782. Before his coronation, King Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I) held the title of Chao Phraya Chakri for over 10 years.\n\nKing Rama I is credited with establishing the Thai Chakri dynasty (Image Source: Compiled)\n\nKing Rama I decided to relocate the capital to Bangkok and construct the city in the architectural style of ancient Ayutthaya. He ruled the nation for 27 years, leaving many significant historical marks. Most notably, he successfully repelled the invasion of Burmese forces into Siam from 1785 to 1786. Additionally, King Rama I is revered as one of the greatest Thai Chakri monarchs.\n\n2.2 Rama II: King Phra Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (1767-1824)\n\nAfter the demise of King Rama I, King Loet La Naphalai succeeded his father in 1089. During his nearly 15-year reign, the Chakri dynasty under his rule enjoyed much more tranquility than during his father's reign. King Rama II mainly focused on advancing arts and literature. By the end of Rama II's reign, Siam bolstered its military strength, elevating its international status among neighboring nations.\n\n2.3 Rama III: King Phra Nangklao (1788-1851)\n\nDuring King Phra Nangklao's reign, he primarily focused on reforming the taxation and national treasury systems. Additionally, King Rama III opened up trade with China throughout his 27-year rule.\n\nKing Rama III pursued a flexible governance policy and established friendly relations with the West (Image Source: Compiled)\n\nFurthermore, King Rama III reestablished diplomatic relations with Western powers, dating back to the Ayutthaya era. Unlike his predecessors, King Rama III did not designate a successor from his children but passed the throne to his half-brother.\n\n2.4 Rama IV: King Mongkut (1804-1868)\n\nRegarded as one of the most renowned Thai Chakri monarchs in the West, King Mongkut even appeared in the legendary Broadway musical - The King and I (1956). Additionally, his character was depicted in a Hollywood film in 1956.\n\nKing Rama IV ruled the nation for 17 years. During his reign, the Chakri dynasty faced significant pressure from the West. Consequently, King IV had to sign treaties relinquishing royal monopoly over foreign trade. He passed away from malaria during an expedition.\n\n2.5 Rama V: King Chulalongkorn (1853-1910)\n\nKing Chulalongkorn is praised as one of the greatest Thai Chakri monarchs. King Rama V was the pioneer king of the Chakri dynasty to study abroad in Europe. During his studies in Europe, he promoted Siamese culture, people, and progressiveness to European authorities.\n\nKing Rama V was the first Chakri king to study abroad in the West (Image Source: Compiled)\n\nDuring his 42-year reign, King Rama V endeavored to modernize the nation by abolishing slavery entirely. Additionally, he ceded some territories to the West to avoid invasion like neighboring countries.\n\n2.6 Rama VI: King Vajiravudh (1881-1925)\n\nDuring his reign, King Rama VI continuously encouraged creativity among the people, fostering patriotism and national pride. Additionally, King Vajiravudh implemented numerous reform policies, modernizing the military. In 1912, he quelled a coup initiated by discontented palace officials. The reason stemmed from accusations and suspicions that King Rama VI was squandering funds and plotting to overthrow the Chakri dynasty.\n\n2.7 Rama VII: King Prajadhipok (1893-1941)\n\nAmong the Thai Chakri monarchs, King Rama VII was the constitutional monarch of the Land of the Golden Temple. He also became the first constitutional monarch following the Siamese revolution. In 1935, King Prajadhipok abdicated after a coup led by a group of military officers. Towards the end of his life, he spent his remaining time happily with his wife in England. King Rama VII had no children.\n\n2.8 Rama VIII: King Ananda Mahidol (1925-1946)\n\nAs King Rama VII had no children, his nephew, King Ananda Mahidol, succeeded him to the throne. Ananda Mahidol's biological father was Prince Mahidol, the son of King Rama V. When King Ananda Mahidol was 9 years old, studying in Switzerland, he was chosen to ascend the throne. During that time, the government also changed the country's name to Thailand in 1939.\n\nKing Rama VIII was shot and died in his bedroom at the palace in Bangkok. This incident occurred before he could return to Switzerland for his studies.\n\n2.9 Rama IX: King Bhumibol Adulyadej (1927-2016)\n\nAfter the passing of King Ananda, Bhumibol Adulyadej succeeded his elder brother in 1946. He is one of the longest-reigning Thai Chakri monarchs. King Rama IX is considered a symbol of the nobility of the Thai monarchy, embodying a blend of tradition and modernity. Additionally, the touching love story between him and Queen Sirikit has moved many hearts.\n\nKing Rama IX, a wise and beloved monarch, won the hearts of the Thai people throughout his reign (Image Source: Compiled)\n\nDespite numerous challenges during his reign, Thailand experienced many upheavals, yet King Rama IX pursued reconciliatory policies, thwarting coup attempts. Consequently, he became the first recipient of the United Nations' Lifetime Achievement Award for Human Development.\n\nThrough the implementation of 1,000 projects, King Rama IX helped uplift impoverished farmers. To the Thai people, King Rama IX is a revered leader. His contributions will always be remembered. In 2016, King Bhumibol Adulyadej passed away, leaving a deep sorrow among the Thai populace.\n\n2.10 Rama X: King Vajiralongkorn (1952 - present)\n\nFollowing King Rama IX is his biological son - King Vajiralongkorn. He currently serves as the reigning monarch of Thailand, officially ascending to the throne on May 4, 2019. After the inauguration ceremony, King Vajiralongkorn officially became the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty.\n\nKing Rama X is the reigning monarch of the Land of the Golden Temple (Image Source: Compiled)\n\nHe is the only son of King Rama IX and Queen Sirikit. He ascended to the throne at the age of 64, becoming the oldest monarch at the time of his coronation.\n\n3. Who is the longest-reigning monarch of the Thai Chakri dynasty?\n\nAmong the Thai Chakri monarchs, Rama IX reigns as the longest-serving ruler of the dynasty. Over his 70-year reign, he garnered the love and respect of the Thai people for his numerous social welfare projects.\n\nAdditionally, King Rama IX was a multi-talented monarch, excelling in both artistic endeavors and wielding political power for the betterment of his people. This is why the Thai people revere King Bhumibol Adulyadej as 'a living saint'."
