From my well-situated home base on Worachak Road I first explored, always on foot, my neighbourhood from Wat Saket to Wang Burapha and then gradually stretched my reconnoiterings across an ever-expanding urban terrain, reaching from the Grand Palace and Sanam Luang to Sampheng’s raucous waterfront. Wandering the city’s dusty byways I sought to find the order behind the clutter but was stymied at every turn. In the process of negotiating the baffling metropolis I found that many locals faced as much difficulty as I in directing me to my destination. Few street signs — and those few only in indecipherable Thai — were available to guide my way, and house numbers were aligned in no apparent sequence; even a reasonable city map was unavailable. Only many years later was I able to acquire my first reliable Bangkok street-guide (Tanya 1984), which still occupies its cherished place on my bookshelf as a memorial to those bygone days. That unforgettable experience inspired me, in my abiding conviction in the innate rationality of mankind, to continue to the present day my search for the logical underpinnings of Bangkok’s apparent spatial chaos. Similar dissonance met my efforts to identify the guiding principles of Thai culture and society. A clear sense of easy acquaintance, happy camaraderie, and calm self-effacement overrode less affable undertones of nationalist sensitivity, class prejudice, and an elemental dialectic of seniority and servility. Bangkok’s social cacophony was a pervasive presence. From dancing the ramwong (a formerly popular Thai dance form) at a sumptuous charity ball where the capital’s elite flaunted their wealth, to sharing bamboo-joints of khao lam (steamed sweetened sticky rice) and tin cups of nam tan sot (watered palm sugar) at a roadside stall with a gang of sam-lo (three-wheeler) taxi drivers was tantamount to crossing civilizations. Yet all were Bangkok natives, and proud of it. Searching the city’s few Englishlanguage bookshops for clarification of that jumbled scenario, all I could find was an assortment of esoteric monographs on the “loosely structured” Thai social order (Evers 1969), elaborating on a curiously chaotic theory of the amiable incongruities of Thai life so evident all around me.

Some years later, having made some progress in my grasp of Bangkok’s spatial and social contours, I was fortuitously posted to temporary office quarters in the midst of the inner city’s Bang Lamphu district (long before the backpacker invasion of that neighbourhood’s Khao San Road). Two dramatically contrasting royal temples bracketed that market locale. The sparkling grandeur of one, Wat Bowon Niwet, put to shame the sadly squalid state of the other, Wat Chana Songkhram, where mangy dogs, scrabbling chickens, and the occasional scrawny bullock strayed the unkempt grounds. Yet both temples, I learned, were closely associated with Bangkok’s former division between king (maharat) and viceroy (uparat). The baffling contrast between those two royal landmarks whetted my appetite for uncovering their untold backstory. Some of my findings on the far-reaching implications of that political anomaly of Old Bangkok are contained in the following chapters. Roaming Bang Lamphu’s maze of lanes and alleys (many of them long since eradicated in the district’s ongoing modernization), I discovered the remnants of its past human geography, including residual elements of a number of old palaces, lingering signs of an old Mon community, whispers of a past Khmer presence, and vestiges of a nearby Lao settlement, not to mention the neighbourhood’s still-vigorous Malay village and bustling SinoThai marketplace. That remarkable diversity of what I had initially thought to be nothing more than a simple Thai urban precinct raised further enticing mysteries. It soon became evident that the ethnic mélange so evident in Bang Lamphu’s history permeated the entire city. Only many years later, having mastered Thai (to some degree) and having gained the freedom to pursue these interests full-time and across the entire cityscape, have I been able to construct a logical solution to what originally posed such a riddle. *** And so this book, the result of a half-century’s participant-observer immersion in the urban melting pot that has become my hometown, a city hiding a fascinating human past. The book presents an ethnohistory — a socio-cultural biography — of Old Bangkok (1782–1910), otherwise known as Ratanakosin, the capital of Siam. It traces the synergy between the city’s evolving spatial design, social organization, and political plot from its eighteenth-century origins to its early-twentieth-century modernization.\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities the Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Among those themes are the following: First, the function of the city, from its beginnings in the wake of the fall of Ayutthaya, as a haven for refugees, detention centre for war captives, and magnet for entrepreneurs and wage workers of diverse ethnicity; the contributions made by the respective ethnic communities to the city’s growth and development; and the social and spatial autonomy long maintained by those ethnic groups despite their close proximity with one another and intimate relations with their elite Thai patrons. Second, the feudal structure of Old Bangkok, with the respective ethnic communities linking hierarchically to the Thai elite through a variety of functional reciprocities; the forces that in the closing decades of the nineteenth century led to the city’s meteoric transformation from feudalism to nationalism, from a policy regime of “benign neglect” to one of “active intervention,” and from ethnic pluralism to ideological factionalism. Third, the factors, such as economic opportunity, social proximity, intermarriage, and mass education, that facilitated cultural assimilation, in opposition to those such as religious partisanship, communal endogamy, and social isolation which supported or reinforced the retention of ethnic identity in the face of integrative pressures. And fourth, the manner in which Old Bangkok’s physical design, conforming to the metaphysical, aesthetic, and utilitarian principles of the mandala, complemented the city’s ethnically plural social organization; and the process whereby that symbolic schema disintegrated, just as its social corollary withered away under conditions of growing royal absolutism, intensifying bureaucratic centralization, and rising nationalism. The ethnic constituencies of Old Bangkok covered in this book range from the Thai (elite and commons), Portuguese-Thai, Mon, Lao, Muslims (Cham, Persians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Indonesians), and Chinese (Taechiu, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, Cantonese) to a congeries of lesser groups (Khmer, Vietnamese, Thai Yuan, Sikh, farang). The following chapters treat those various groups seriatim. They can be read together to gain an appreciation of the city’s unfolding human history, or individually as the reader’s interests in specific ethnicities may dictate. In either case, they provide a bottom-up perspective on Bangkok’s evolving human tapestry to complement the top-down vision conveyed by the conventional historical literature. ***\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities the Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

All rights reserved.\n\nB\n\nangkok, the capital of Siam since 1782, served from the outset as the kingdom’s ceremonial, administrative, commercial, and demographic centre — a primate city in every sense of the term. In speaking of its “premodern” phase, 1782–1910, covering the first five reigns of the Chakri dynasty, the city is conventionally referred to as Old Bangkok, or more formally, Ratanakosin. Thus, the 129-year time span from 1782 to 1910 may be termed the Ratanakosin period. As Ratanakosin, the city is often visualized as the walled and moated artificial island that still carries its name, but the physical contours of Old Bangkok reached well beyond those confines to incorporate the densely populated urban periphery. From the very outset, the Bangkok conurbation expanded progressively in area and population, attracting a diverse citizenry representing a multiplicity of ethnic communities while expediting Siam’s growing prosperity and accelerating modernization. Yet, until the rise of the absolute monarchy and nationalism in the decades crossing into the twentieth century, Old Bangkok retained much of the feudal political and social alignment that had in former centuries characterized the ancestral capital of Ayutthaya. This introductory chapter briefly surveys Old Bangkok’s spatial design, political structure, social organization, and ethnic diversity in their historical context as background to the five historical studies of the city’s principal ethnic minorities that follow in Chapters 2 to 6, plus the five summary ethnohistories of lesser communities contained in Chapter 7. In fact, the present chapter can be considered to add yet a further ethnohistory in its discussion of the role played by Old Bangkok’s Thai ruling elite and Thai commons in the city’s nineteenth–twentieth century modernization.\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 1 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

In conformance with the traditional Thai interpretation of the Brahman cosmos (Lithai 1985; Ivarsson 1995), that majestic Sanskrit-based appellation envisaged the Siamese capital as an earthly replica of the supernal city of Sudarsana (“Suthat” in Thai), abode of the thirty-three deities ruled by Indra, lord of the Tavatimsa Heaven (“Dawadoeng Sawan” in Thai), at the summit of the cosmic Mount Meru. Not merely in name but far more substantively in its physical layout, political structure, and social organization, Ratanakosin was designed to evoke Indra’s celestial city. Sparse surviving evidence suggests that Bangkok’s precursor, Ayutthaya, had early on been laid out along similar lines, only to deviate progressively from its cosmic design as the city evolved over the course of its four centuries’ lifetime (1351–1767). Reviving the ancient mystique, the new capital as well as the kingdom over which it presided came to be known as Ratanakosin — “the Jewel of Indra”. Even today, with Ratanakosin a quaint reference to bygone days, Bangkok continues to be popularly known as Krung Thep — “the City of Angels”. Quite unintentionally but strangely prescient, that subtle shift in emphasis from Indra’s magisterial pre-eminence to the ascendancy of a contentious gaggle of lesser deities expresses much of Bangkok’s storied history. Following the tradition firmly established at the ancestral capital of Ayutthaya, the founders of Ratanakosin sought to associate themselves metaphorically with the Brahman deities by exploiting numerous allusions to Mount Meru’s supreme habitants: Indra, Vishnu, Rama, and Buddha. As self-professed avatars of those heavenly beings, they retained the customary title of “celestial prince” (chao fa). They found it fitting to meld Brahman and Buddhist iconography in their selection of the Emerald Buddha image, set upon its soaring dais suggestive of Mount Meru, as the kingdom’s palladium, in large part for its emerald green hue, the color of Indra, bespeaking the\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 2 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

The image of Indra’s mount, the celestial elephant Airavata (“Erawan” in Thai), with Indra mounted upon its shoulders, was installed as a featured symbol on many of Bangkok’s royal edifices and was in due course adopted as the official emblem of the Bangkok Municipality. Indra’s weapon, the lightning bolt (vajra, or wachira in Thai, iconographically represented as a trident), became a popular motif of Thai royalty and was eventually incorporated in the title and royal regalia of Rama VI (King Wachirawut). In parallel fashion, Vishnu’s weapon, the bladed discus (chakra, or chak in Thai, also associated with the dynasty’s founder in his former capacity as minister of civil affairs) was adopted as the Chakri dynasty’s crest and continues to be proudly displayed as the privileged emblem of the kingdom’s armed forces. And Rama was eventually selected as the personal avatar of the Chakri kings, with episodes from the Ramakien (the Thai version of the Ramayana epic) adorning the mural-clad inner wall of the Chapel Royal (Wat Phra Si Sasadaram, popularly known as Wat Phra Kaew), and his heroic statue today gracing the forecourt of the former Front Palace (the viceroy’s stronghold, sited some 200 metres due north of the Grand Palace). Such examples of the ruling elite’s affinity for the celestial symbolism embodied in the gods and accouterments of Indra’s heaven could be extended endlessly (Wales 1931; Smith 1978). The interminable associations between Thai sovereignty, Brahman cosmology, and Buddhist ethics served as an essential validation of the Thai elite’s rule over the loosely structured, ethnically diverse feudal Siamese kingdom. As the defining mystique surrounding a new and insecure dynasty reigning over a kingdom only recently shattered by war, the celestial imagery penetrated deep into the Ratanakosin psyche. Most elaborate of all those allusions was the physical design of Bangkok itself in the form of a mandala (monthon in Thai), simulating the layout of Indra’s celestial city (see “The Mandala as Urban Template” in the concluding chapter). As depicted in tapestries, murals, and illustrated manuscripts, the mandala image simplifies the three-dimensionality of Mount Meru onto a two-dimensional topography — in effect an aerial projection of Indra’s heaven atop Mount Meru, dividing the celestial city into an octagonal ring of precincts surrounding the pre-eminent ninth precinct, the citadel, at the pinnacle — each precinct identified with a Brahman deity possessing specific auspicious attributes, contributing to the integrity of the whole. That propitiously symmetrical arrangement was applied purposefully in Old Bangkok, a city radiating from the centrally positioned City Pillar (lak moeang), surrounded by the royal palaces and temples, encircled in turn by\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 3 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Overlooking all was the great celebratory monument (phra prang) of Wat Arun, erected in the Second Reign as a visionary rendering of Mount Meru in glorification of Ratanakosin and its reigning dynasty (Wat Arun Rachaworaram 1983; Chatri 2013). Earthly Design The 1767 relocation of Siam’s capital from devastated Ayutthaya to Thonburi, some sixty kilometres downriver, marked a turning point in Thai history. The new stronghold, founded in haste to defend a fledgling regime under threat of imminent attack, soon showed its deficiencies in its constricted confines, inadequate fortifications, and crumbling shoreline, as well as its inauspicious asymmetry. The city’s cross-river expansion a decade later to incorporate “East Thonburi” — more than doubling the dimensions of the whole from 0.9 to 2.2 square kilometres — sought to remedy those shortcomings, though the cross-river bifurcation contributed to the city’s defensive vulnerability (Map 1.1). Efforts to formalize Thonburi’s riparian unity by adding a moat and wall to the east-side precinct (Amphan 1994) did little to ease the disquiet. It appears that toward the end of the Thonburi reign a plan was thus mooted to move the royal redoubt to the east bank. But realization of that plan had to await the coup of 1782, which brought to power the Chakri dynasty. Within the two weeks immediately following the 1782 coup, the decision to recentre the city from the west bank of the river to the east was confirmed. The new, enlarged riverine capital — more than redoubling its former area to 4.6 square kilometres — was laid out as a cosmically demarcated stronghold for the ruling elite, the inner citadel for the aristocracy and the outer precincts for the nobility, with the commons relegated to the “wilderness” beyond the walled and moated bounds. The expanded city’s basic parameters were quickly marked out (Map 1.2): the City Pillar was ritually planted at the riparian site’s precise centre; a sizeable Chinese immigrant community was evicted from the delimited area; the precise positions of the new royal palaces were determined (Thipakorawong 2009a, p. 6). The new city was laid out to accommodate the southern and northern zones of royal occupation and authority, demarcated by its latitudinal axis. Under the dual supervision of the king and viceroy (uparat, or heir presumptive), a workforce was mobilized and construction materials were acquired; the new city’s waterlogged terrain was drained, cleared, levelled, and raised; a new\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 4 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

The thousands of Khmer, Lao, and other war captives conscripted to implement that massive task were assigned settlement sites along the new city’s sparsely populated outskirts. Whereas Bangkok was founded with great fanfare, its subsequent evolution proceeded at a gradual, largely unpublicized pace. Imperceptibly, the political significance of Thonburi as the city’s west-bank precinct slipped steadily toward obscurity. After the construction of Thonburi’s Rear Palace (residence of the short-lived adjunct viceroy) in 1785, no further palace was built on the west bank over the remainder of the new dynasty’s First Reign. In the following years the deaths of several senior royal family members residing along the Thonburi riverfront opened opportunities for the downgrading of their palaces. Particularly telling was the dissolution of the Rear Palace in 1806. That incremental downgrading of the west bank as a royal quarter truncated the original Bangkok design to the 3.7 square kilometres east-bank walled and moated city, eliminating Ratanakosin’s cross-river vulnerability and leaving the capital a distinct island — but unaesthetically asymmetrical in its elemental design (Map 1.3). The citadel’s south-north division between the king’s and viceroy’s zones became increasingly apparent over the course of the First Reign as the sons of the king and viceroy were awarded their own palaces upon their coming of age. (To be sure, there was little outward evidence to distinguish the princes’ “palaces” from the nobility’s “mansions”. The rank and status of their occupants were their essential differentiating characteristic.) Fourteen princely palaces were built between 1785 and the close of the First Reign, ten within the southern zone (for nine of the king’s sons and one grandson) and the other four in the northern zone (for the viceroy’s four senior sons) (Table 1.3). Accentuating that division was the recentring of the city from the City Pillar (Map 1.2, site A) to the newly instated Royal Cremation Ground (thung phra men [= meru], that Thai term referring to the towering crematory monuments erected there for the funerals of ranking royals) (Map 1.3, site E). That crystallization of the citadel’s south-north divide was further confirmed by the pairing of two great royal monasteries, the former — Wat Photaram (later renamed Wat Phra Chetuphon) — standing directly behind the Grand Palace as the king’s signature temple and the latter — Wat Mahathat — adjoining the Front Palace under the viceroy’s patronage. The parallel association of those royal temples with the Grand Palace and Front Palace was corroborated not only by their position as\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 6 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Under the Thai elite’s conspicuously polygynous marital norms, the proliferation of princes, each of whom required his own palace upon attaining maturity, intensified space constraints within the citadel over the successive reigns, ultimately leading it to burst its aristocratic bounds. Thus, nineteen out of thirty-two new princely palaces were built outside the citadel in the Third Reign, nine out of twelve in the Fourth Reign, and forty-seven out of forty-eight in the Fifth Reign (Table 1.1). Even with the growing dispersion of palaces and also the establishment of discrete ministry headquarters, however, the city’s north-south divide was retained (Maps 1.4 and 1.5). Beyond the declining relevance of the citadel as the aristocratic enclave, the spread of royal residence and ministry headquarters into the noble quarter contributed to the gradual easing of status consciousness that accompanied the opening up of the walled city during the later decades of the nineteenth century. With growing dynastic self-assurance and an increasingly outward-oriented worldview, entry and exit through the city gates was eased for commoners, with the traditional 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. city gate curfew being abolished early in the Fourth Reign. The urban expansion of “metropolitan Bangkok” accelerated in the Fourth and Fifth Reigns with the addition of an outer moat, the Phadung Krung Kasem Canal — again more than doubling the cityscape, to 8.6 square kilometres — and a network of new roadways bounded by rental shophouses and tenements that facilitated the intrusion of commerce and commoners into the walled city. By the 1880s, the emerging Bangkok metropolis including both the west bank and the city’s southern riverine extension covered an inexact oval with latitudinal and longitudinal dimensions of some five and ten kilometres, respectively (Thailand, Post and Telegraph Department 1883; Wilson 1989). By the turn of the century, that ovoid urban expanse had come to consist of “a vast agglomeration of villages” some thirty kilometres in circumference (Jottrand 1995, pp. 28, 438; Antonio 1997, pp. 13–30). Over the course of the Fifth Reign, Old Bangkok’s utilitarian, earthly design diverged ever further from its symbolic, celestial template with the substitution of Western imperial grandeur for Eastern cosmic metaphor as the cityscape’s defining mystique. The citadel was profoundly reshaped with the decommissioning of the Front Palace, creation of the Great Esplanade (sanam luang, a major expansion of the old Cremation Ground), and cut-through of Rachadamnoen Avenue (the King’s Promenade) to the new Dusit Palace and its surrounding cluster of princely villas several\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 8 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Adding to the proliferation of royal residences, various ministries and other government offices were stationed at convenient locations within the walled city, and later without as well, as Western-style public administration replaced the old personalized feudal arrangements. At the same time, Chinese, Western, and Indian business enterprises along with Lao, Malay, Khmer, Vietnamese, and other artisans’ and wage workers’ neighbourhoods penetrated the Old City in ever-greater numbers. The very idea of Ratanakosin as an elitist stronghold paled with its merger into the greater metropolitan area through the improvement of transport routes, bridging of the City Moat, demolition of the city wall, gates, and bastions, and construction of commoners’ housing and marketplaces. The cosmic metaphor of Ratanakosin was thus increasingly attenuated as the greater presence of metropolitan Bangkok gained prominence, until finally, after more than a century of escalating deviation from the celestial archetype, it was laid to rest as obsolete myth. Today, after decades of mounting urban modernization, a newly conceived “Ratanakosin Island conservation movement” seeks quixotically to revive prominent physical features of the nineteenth-century city’s royal heritage, introduce new elements to enhance the Old City’s imagined historical image, and eliminate non-royal traces considered to be inappropriate intrusions (Chatri 2012, pp. 129–45). After a century-long interval of relentless urban modernization, that anachronistic, misconceived campaign to resurrect as a monarchist monument a selectively refashioned image of the former Ratanakosin cityscape comes as much too little, far too late. Political Space and Social Place Simply and cogently stated, “the landscape of Old Bangkok was a visible representation of the structure of society” (Tomosugi 1991, p. 127). As an aerial projection of the Jewel of Indra atop the cosmic cone of Mount Meru, Old Bangkok’s political space was a bounded topography of its privileged precincts; correspondingly, its social place was a vertical projection of its people’s status hierarchy along the cosmic slopes. Particularly important in the nobility’s social positioning for political advantage was their spatial location relative to the king and viceroy, and correspondingly, the commons’ location near their noble patrons. The confluence of social status and political rank within the city’s physical confines formed “a single architecturalcosmological scheme … in which territorial and functional aspects … [were] incidental and derivative” (Tambiah 1976, pp. 141ff). The vision of political space as a symmetrical plane, expressed primarily through centricity and radiation, meshed with the notion of the feudal lord and his retinue of vassals\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 10 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

The first aspect of Bangkok’s spatial symmetry concerned the siting of the city’s precincts, wards, quarters, and districts in concentric rings of successively lesser status spreading from the city’s sacred centre to its profane outskirts. The second aspect was axiality, direction, and orientation, which referred to the positioning of settlements, villages, and neighbourhoods north and south of the city’s ritual core, reaching to its most peripheral upstream and downstream extensions. It has been said, in reference to the graded radiation of premodern Siam’s feudal polity from the sacral centre to the secular periphery, that “Siam has always been a hierarchical domain, differentiated not only by class and status, but by ethno-geography as well” (Thongchai 2000a, p. 41). The Bangkok microcosm from the outset conformed to that broad social design. As a miniature likeness of the kingdom, the capital was laid out in a series of concentric zones of habitation radiating from the royal citadel in successively diminishing degrees of eminence: Within, the aristocracy and nobility gathered in the citadel and surrounding walled city. Without, along the urban periphery, the settlements of the lower social strata — freemen, debt bondsmen, war captives, and hereditary slaves of diverse ethnicities. In principle, and to a diminishing degree in practice as time and circumstance eroded the original vision, those valorized inner and outer zones of habitation were reserved for the elite and the commons, respectively. With rare exceptions — those exceptions becoming increasingly less rare as time went by (as later discussion will amplify) — no member of the elite would deign to live without; without special sanction, no commoner household or village would dare settle within. Complementing the hierarchical radiation of settlements from the sacral centre was their placement above and below the city’s lateral axis, running between the king’s and viceroy’s respective strongholds and thus separating the city’s upstream and downstream precincts. Under Siam’s feudal institutions, the viceroy maintained a political presence considerably more influential than simply the king’s factotum, which was why he was considered virtually the “second sovereign”; he headed an administration which, though of lesser authority than the king’s, boasted its own nobility militia, revenue base, and subject population (Englehart 2001, p. 80). Though ranking beneath the king in the formal status hierarchy, he habitually emphasized his equivalent royal spiritual power (saksit) and charisma (barami) (see the “Thai Yuan” discussion in Chapter 7). He contested often quite blatantly for power (Nidhi 2002), and in so doing, he often exercised virtually independent authority over what he considered his share of the kingdom’s peoples and territories. Within Bangkok, his zone of occupation\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 11 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Not only the palaces of his princely sons and the mansions of his noble subordinates but the many commoner settlements occupying the city’s northern outskirts lay within his ambit of authority. The second half of the nineteenth century saw Bangkok’s demographic fulcrum slip downstream with the growing presence of the international market economy. The commercially minded, maritime-oriented districts stretching downriver flourished with the establishment of scores of foreigninvested enterprises — rice mills, sawmills, workshops, shipping firms, agency houses — and the accelerated immigration of wage workers to staff those ventures. That buoyant expansion stood in contrast to the economic stagnation of the city’s northern, inland-oriented precincts as the viceroy’s power, status, and wealth faded. The viceroy’s feudal command over his hinterland client communities withered as the traditional redistributive economy gave way to capitalism, as refugee and captive arrivals declined, as Chinese merchants and tax farmers gained control of the inland markets, as state revenues were centralized increasingly in the hands of the king. With the political eclipse of Siam’s last viceroy in 1875, followed by his death a decade later, the city’s north-south dualism came to an end, and the remaining vestiges of the former viceroy’s political authority were appropriated by the now absolute monarch. More than any other single development, that event signalled the formal end of Siam’s feudal order and ultimately marked the onset of Old Bangkok’s demise.\n\nCopyright © 2017.

It is difficult to measure the distance, but the extent of the gap was sufficient to enable the élite to “look back” or “look down” … on their subjects and the marginal minorities, not as They, yet not as We, but perhaps as Theirs (Thongchai 2000b, p. 55).\n\nMuch like Old Bangkok’s physical design, its political structure and social organization, viewed as an aerial projection of the cosmic social order (Lithai 1985, pp. 494–501), comprised a series of concentric rings of descending power and status spreading from centre (peak) to periphery (base). Beyond Bangkok, the rural hinterlands were inhabited by peasant villages, Thai and non-Thai. Many districts and even entire regions of lesser fertility were settled by ethnic minorities: war captives forcibly carried off to domesticate formerly uninhabitable tracts, refugees from oppression in\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 12 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Minority communities with special qualifications — warriors, artisans, scholars, merchants, administrators — were invited to establish their settlements close to the capital; a few, exceptionally, even within the walled city itself. Within the city wall, the exclusive residential zones of aristocracy and nobility complemented and confirmed the strictly segregated social strata of feudal Siam. The easing of those spatial constraints as the nineteenth century wore on corresponded, in turn, with the gradual liberalization of the kingdom’s social hierarchy. The Ruling Elite In their self-justified rule over the lower social strata, Old Bangkok’s ruling class saw itself as an organic society of unique merit in the cosmic order, a select upper crust imbued with a sense of immutable political authority, social superiority, and moral righteousness. The gap between the Thai ruling elite and the Thai commons was sufficiently wide that the elite verged on a distinct sub-culture. As of the close of the nineteenth century, it has been observed, the Thai ruling elite, “Regarding themselves subjectively as almost a supra-ethnic or supranational cosmopolitan ruling caste, … lorded it over the Siamese nation-people as colonial masters with a royal Thai face” (Kasian 2001, p. 6, quoted in Harrison and Jackson 2010, p. 14). As in other premodern civilizations both East and West, “the idea that the aristocracy belonged to the same culture as the peasants must have seemed abominable to the former and incomprehensible to the latter” (Eriksen 2010, p. 123). The two social worlds distinguished themselves discernibly in terms of such disparate culture traits as dialect (though collectively Thai), religious conviction and practice (though jointly Theravada Buddhist), gender relations and marriage, sources of income and wealth, diet, dress, and locus and style of habitation. Despite their common ethnicity as “Thai,” the social bounds separating elite from commons were strictly observed, and infringements were punished through both judicial sanction and social censure. In sum, the Thai commons (visualized as an ethnic entity in its own right) was dealt with by its masters no differently than the other ethnic constituencies. The ruling elite comprised the aristocracy (chaonai) and nobility (khunnang), their heads of household invariably holding titled rank (yot, bandasak). Irrespective of personal qualifications, virtually all occupied executive government positions, albeit often no more than pro forma. In theory, the king (abetted by his viceroy) held unfettered power to tax, to\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 13 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

As a second-best option under those circumstances, it was considered advantageous for him to allow his surrogates broad autonomy (Englehart 2001, pp. 13–14, 33). Was the king therefore “an absolute monarch whose every whim was law” or was he “comparatively helpless” in the clutches of his vassals (Englehart 2001, p. 12)? Both views carry an aura of validity: the king may have exercised “absolute control” within the restricted ambit of court and capital, but he was relatively “helpless” in his reliance on his self-interested minions beyond that. That spatial diffusion of authority speaks directly to the kingdom’s feudal political structure. Beyond the king (the maharat), the highest office in the land was held by the viceroy (the uparat), conventionally the king’s younger brother or eldest son. The intimate association between king and viceroy was symbolically validated in the court’s preoccupation with the Ramakien (the Thai Ramayana). That intricately plotted, multi-layered tale of ancient statecraft, valour, and chivalry has as one of its essential themes the bond between Rama (“Phra Ram”), prince of Ayodhya (patronymic of Ayutthaya), and his younger brother, Lakshman (“Phra Lak”). Lakshman’s loyalty, devotion, obedience, respect, and deference to Rama were virtues historically associated with the Thai viceroy’s fealty to his king (Goss 2008), despite the fact that those ideals were repeatedly sacrificed to the ambitions of Siam’s colorful series of viceroys. That fraternal, elder-younger royal pairing animated the Thai cultural (spatial, political, social) theme of dualism — higher-lower, inner-outer, right-left, south-north. It has been conservatively reckoned that the ruling elite at the Thai capital during the decades before the move from Ayutthaya to Thonburi/ Bangkok constituted no more than 2,000 persons out of Siam’s total population of perhaps two million (and Ayutthaya’s possible 200,000) (Turton 1980, p. 253). Of Bangkok’s initial population, it may thus be inferred that about 1,000 (less than 1.5 per cent) constituted the ruling elite as of 1782. That number probably doubled by 1851, and it more than doubled again to reach about 6,000 persons by 1910, reflecting a decline to well below 1 per cent of Bangkok’s total inhabitants. (By comparison, no more than 1.7 per cent of China’s total population in the late 1800s is said to have belonged to the gentry (Wakeman 1975, p. 22).) The growth of Old Bangkok’s ruling elite was slower than that of the capital’s overall population growth partly due to the accelerated urban in-migration of commoners (a large share of whom were Chinese) with the easing of feudal constraints on mobility and the city’s rising economic opportunities\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 14 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

The ruling elite was ethnically Thai by default; entrants of non-Thai ethnicity automatically became “Thai” by virtue of their enhanced status affiliation and were expected to assimilate fully into elite Thai culture, though that expectation was not always wholly fulfilled. Two principal routes of entry into, as well as rise within, the ruling elite presented themselves: for men, advancement through the ranks of the military or civil service to positions of command; for women, marriage (or concubinage). “In essence, [inter-ethnic relations between the elite and commons] centred upon the … elite’s exchange of administrative protection and facility for an income of rents, interest and bribes; it was reinforced by inter-marriage and, ultimately, by … cultural assimilation” (Brown 1988, p. 172). An old Thai saying had it that “women strive upward, men reach down”, referring to the use of women as a medium of exchange in the kindred’s struggle for upward social mobility (Loos 2005). Attesting to that social convention are multiple documented cases of Mon, Lao, Khmer, Vietnamese, Cham, Thai Yuan, and Chinese female contributors to the Chakri royal lineage. Even the Chakri dynasty’s founders were of mixed Mon-Chinese-Thai ancestry; many of their close collaborators, awarded senior positions in the new regime, were non-Thai; and many of their royal descendants could boast ethnic minority maternal descent. As a result, the ruling elite, traced to its ancestral roots, was actually the kingdom’s most ethnically diverse social group (with the possible exception of the Buddhist clergy). The Commons The overwhelming preponderance of Siam’s population were commoners. Nearly all of those lesser subjects of the crown were subsistence-oriented farmers, whose surplus output was regularly siphoned off to fill the state coffers, support the ruling elite, and sustain the monkhood. However, the commoner presence in Old Bangkok, as at the kingdom’s lesser urban centres, constituted a special case, consisting primarily of traders, artisans, military personnel, minor functionaries, and others with specialized skills, as well as staff and servants in the retinues of the ruling elite — all of whom were subjected to relatively lenient rates of taxation and were exempted from corvée service. In particular, the Chinese, Persians, Portuguese, and certain other immigrant-descent groups were technically considered temporary sojourners even after generations of residency and were thus treated as a separate case from the commoner class at large.\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 15 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

(Resident “sojourners” — mainly Chinese, Indian, and Westerners — formed a separate category.) Freemen were divided into two categories: phrai luang, serving the king; and phrai som, awarded to individual princes or nobles. That division was not as straightforward as it appears: “The varieties [of freemen] were often mutually overlapping and sometimes contradictory…. The categories were ad hoc, locally defined, and coined for administrative convenience” (Englehart 2001, p. 111). Though nominally free, the king’s men were bound in periodic service (rachakan, commonly translated as corvée) to government departments (krom) under the direction of the senior nobility and their provincial subalterns (nai) (Akin 1975, p. 105). Those bound to princes or nobles were generally subjected to relatively lenient treatment, making for much slippage between categories. To cope with that issue, a comprehensive procedure of manpower registration, tattooing, and direct oversight was exerted over the king’s men, and the individual princes’ and nobles’ men may in many cases have been similarly controlled. The agrarian commons was thus not far removed from serfdom, leaving reference to phrai as “freemen” something of a misnomer (Khachon 1976; Chatchai 1988). Even more serf-like were the various forms of slavery, which ranged from debt bondsmen and war captives, both technically redeemable (though rarely possessing the resources to purchase their freedom), to nonredeemable slaves (Cruikshank 1975; Turton 1980; Chatchai 1982). Obtained through capture in war or through abduction, purchase, indebtedness, birth, or other means, slaves — Thai as well as other ethnicities — formed a far greater portion of the kingdom’s population, and particularly its urban population, than is ordinarily recognized. While the permanent, irredeemable enslavement of war captives (many of them Khmer, Lao, Mon, and Malay) and abducted outlanders (primarily tribals from the frontier uplands) had been a principal source of manpower acquisition in earlier centuries, the preponderance of slaves during the Ratanakosin period appear to have been debt slaves (a status akin to indenture), most of them destitute Thai peasants. “Figures for the proportion of the population with the status of [slaves] are either non-existent or disputed for every period of Thai history. Even approximate orders of magnitude … are difficult to assess, let alone the proportions of different types [or ethnicities] of slave” (Turton 1980, p. 274). Yet, it has been conservatively conjectured that in\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 16 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

The position of slaves was generally inferior to that of freemen. By and large, calls on their labour services were more frequent and onerous; rates of in-kind revenue extraction were higher; security of productive land tenure was lower; freedom of movement was more tightly restricted; access to patronage was less readily available and less benevolent. In short, they were generally condemned to a lower standard of living. In addition to their toil as agricultural workers on the royal lands and the private estates of the ruling elite, as conscript labour in the construction and maintenance of pubic works and in military service, and as craftsmen in personal service to their patrons, a privileged minority of slaves were household servants and personal attendants to the ruling elite, forming the major part of many titled officials’ retinues at public events. War captives as well as frontier villagers “swept up” (kwat) in the course of slave-raiding forays fell under the direct control of the king and viceroy; many groups of those captives were in turn deployed to senior royals and favoured nobles for use on their own estates. And so, a number of captive ethnic minority settlements came to be scattered along the Bangkok periphery. An 1805 decree incorporated war captives into the total mass of redeemable slaves, but there is no evidence that any of those unfortunates ever resorted to (or were able to avail themselves of) that means of regaining their freedom over the subsequent generations. Throughout Siam, ethnic minorities formed a major part of the commons. They comprised five social categories: refugees from oppression in neighbouring states, war captives from armed conflicts with nearby kingdoms, tribals abducted from the frontier uplands by raiding parties, destitute immigrant labourers from foreign ports, and economic adventurers from near and far. Tribal captives were relegated to the bottom rung of the social pyramid as hereditary slaves; war prisoners were accorded a higher standing within the slave category with the prospect of eventual release to freeman status; and refugees were provided a standing equivalent to, but not within, the Thai freeman population. Both economic adventurers and wage workers from overseas, finally, were held at arms-length, even if resident over several generations. At Bangkok, as throughout the kingdom, that status hierarchy was associated with residential location, with the general pattern of settlement radiating from the city in accordance with declining social standing.\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 17 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Those superior-inferior, master-minion ties were embedded in a formal administrative apparatus joining designated officials and their charges in a “relationship [that superficially] resembled that between a medieval lord and his serfs” (Englehart 2001, p. 36). The hierarchy of formal links for each ministry or department (krom) ran sequentially from the many villages under its authority up the administrative ladder through village headmen, district chiefs, and provincial functionaries to the central authorities. At each succeeding level, each official had under his supervision a cohort of subordinates who were bound to do his bidding. Whether that mechanism was essentially benevolent or coercive probably differed greatly from case to case and in any event cannot be determined from the scattered anecdotal evidence. Certainly, it was often oppressive, tension-filled, and fragile. However, a persistent impulse runs through Thai historical writings stressing the benevolence of superiors to their inferiors. That is nowhere better expressed than in the standard euphemistic translation of “nai-phrai” (superior-inferior, or master-minion) as “patronclient”. The dynastic apologists and many later historians defended the system by spinning a fantasy of the happy peasant, the grateful servant, the satisfied slave. Alternative appraisals (e.g., Somsamai 1987; Chaiyan 1994; Chatthip 1999) have been slow in emerging and have generally not been well received. As formally instituted, hierarchical relations under the nai-phrai system were prescribed from the top down, leaving few options open to the phrai to negotiate their obligations, change their place in the system, or escape it entirely. Under that arrangement the minority communities, dealing with their masters (nai) across ethnic boundaries, stood at a particular disadvantage. Supplementary to the formal nai-phrai system, however, was a parallel network of informal, socially embedded patron-client relations, a system featuring interpersonal bonds built on close association and mutual consent (Akin 1975, pp. 114–16). “Unlike feudal relations of lord to vassal [the link] between patron and client is voluntary and may be terminated unilaterally by either party” (Hanks 1975, p. 199). The informal patronclient system, based on universal social principles of reciprocity, mutuality, and trust, mitigated the authoritarian, coercive, oppressive inclination of\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 18 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017. ProQuest Ebook\n\n12/6/17 9:02 AM\n\nold bangkok: an ethnohistorical overview\n\n19\n\nthe formal nai-phrai system. It is only after the unravelling of the feudal “social contract” between rulers and ruled in the closing decades of the Ratanakosin period that informal patron-client relations rose to dominance as a social institution. In hindsight, students of Thai social history have sown much confusion through their unwarranted conflation of the two systems, one formal, the other informal; one centrist, the other localized; one administrative, the other communal; one authoritarian, the other consensual. The informal patron-client system was, and continues to be, built on “connections” (sen). It was initially nurtured by the inadequacies of the formal nai-phrai system in meeting the commons’ basic needs. Its chains of informal social links, coalescing into entourages, alliances, factions, and “circles of affiliation” within which benevolence and self-interest merge seamlessly, remain a pervasive presence in Thai social and political life (Hanks 1975, pp. 200–207). Major patrons in local patron-client networks today continue to include such community leaders as village headmen, landowners, employers, moneylenders, temple abbots, and village toughs and political bosses (nakleng, chao pho, tua hia, etc.) (Akin 1978). Not well attuned or sympathetic to the impersonal efficiencies of the market system, Thai society continues to rely on such socially embedded relations in daily life as a conventional means of smoothing business transactions, gaining political favour, ensuring preferential treatment, claiming protection, and the like, a lingering vestige of an earlier era.\n\nCopyright © 2017.

The ethnic diversity infusing the capital’s everyday existence enlivened the evolving synergy between indigenous Siam and the encroaching cosmopolitan world well into the era of the nation-state, but the Thai effort to accommodate the West was not its essential driving force. It has been suggested that “alongside the colonial enterprise, the\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 19 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

It was a project on the ‘Others Within’ ” (Thongchai 2000a, p. 41). In fact, Siam’s policy toward ethnic pluralism, on open display in Bangkok, differed from the coercive Western colonial model in its benign impact on the ethnic minorities (see “The Port-City’s Plural Society” in the concluding chapter). Unlike the Western colonial establishment, the Thai ruling elite over the course of the first five Chakri reigns pursued a strategy of indirect rule over Bangkok’s ethnic minorities, a feudal practice that did not systematically intrude upon or discriminate among the respective ethnic communities and thus had far fewer and far less disruptive implications for the capital’s minorities than was the case in the neighbouring Western-ruled colonies. Some of the vital aspects of that policy frame and its urban implications are examined below. Some Demographics Who were Siam’s and Bangkok’s ethnic minorities, and how prominent a place did they occupy in the kingdom and its capital? The norm of population estimates from late eighteenth to mid-nineteenth century Siam — at that time a loosely defined amalgam of central state, provincial hinterlands, and peripheral dependencies — rose from about three million to some six million inhabitants (Sternstein 1984, p. 45, fig. 1; Grabowsky 1996, p. 75). Within that rising total, the many non-Thai ethnic groups settled in central Siam may well have collectively equalled, or possibly even exceeded, the number of self-styled Thai (Lieberman 2003, vol. 1, p. 319). Broadly speaking, the ethnically Thai peasantry was concentrated in the highly productive wet-rice floodplain of the lower Chaophraya River basin, while Chinese merchant communities were concentrated in the market centres. Large elements of the other major ethnic minorities were settled along the lower-yielding periphery of the kingdom’s agrarian heartland. In the kingdom’s outer regions — the north, northeast, south, and southeast, as well as the western highlands — non-Thai ethnic groups significantly exceeded the Thai. Thus, within the kingdom as a whole, only a plurality of the population consisted of ethnic Thai. To gain an impression of the kingdom’s changing ethnic composition over the course of the Ratanakosin period it is useful to review the sequence of contemporary population estimates (Table 1.2). Those estimates are highly variable, but the overall trend shows a fairly steady rate of increase from less than three million as of 1782 to a benchmark figure of eight million\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 20 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

As a microcosm of the Siamese kingdom, Old Bangkok could well be described as a city dominated by non-Thai ethnic minorities, ruled by a tiny Thai ruling class. The city’s colourful reputation rested heavily on its diverse assortment of Chinese, Mon, Lao, Khmer, Malay, Cham, South and West Asian, Vietnamese, Burmese, and indigenized Portuguese communities, plus a sprinkling of Western expatriate newcomers. (Chapters 2 through 7 provide individual ethnohistories of a number of those Old Bangkok ethnic minorities.) The Chinese, by far the largest of those minorities, were themselves composed of five cultural sub-species: Taechiu, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, and Cantonese. The small Western community could similarly be divided among its oft-contentious ethno-national constituencies, led by the British, French, Germans, and Americans. Less well defined was a category termed “khaek”, consisting mainly of South, West, and Southeast Asian Muslims (though the term khaek was extended “racially” to include, indiscriminately, South Asian Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians). Despite their shared religion, Bangkok’s nineteenth-century Muslims were of diverse language, sect, custom, and origin, ranging from Arab, Persian, and Indian traders to Malay and Cham war captives and more recently arrived bonded labour from the troubled colonial empires of British India and the Netherlands Indies. Similar complexities governed the classification of other ethnic constituencies. What is clear is that Bangkok’s various ethnic minorities did not interact easily; they coexisted in the port-city severally as discrete client communities under the patronage of the Thai ruling elite, each being allowed internal administrative autonomy in return for guarantees of political tranquility and economic cooperation. Old Bangkok was thus very much a plural society. Within Bangkok, as for Siam as a whole, the ethnic minorities collectively far outnumbered the ethnic Thai. Contemporary estimates of the capital’s population vary widely, due in large part to observers’ widely differing conceptions of the territorial extent of the Bangkok conurbation (as distinct from Ratanakosin, the walled and moated inner city); a comprehensive review of fifty-nine contemporary estimates of “built-up” Bangkok’s 1780– 1900 population rises from 75,000 to 800,000 (Sternstein 1984, pp. 43–45, ft. 4). Those figures suggest a remarkable more-than-doubling in Bangkok’s share of the kingdom’s population over the course of the Ratanakosin period. As late as 1908, however, it could still be reliably reported that “no satisfactory official census has yet been taken in Bangkok, and it is difficult to estimate,\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 22 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Despite those cautionary words, it is possible to hazard some broad estimates of Old Bangkok’s evolving population and ethnic composition. (The estimates provided here refer to the built-up, relatively densely populated urban-village area of Bangkok-Thonburi, covering both sides of the river.) Tables 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 present such estimates for the start, midpoint, and close of the Ratanakosin period. However, be warned! In the absence of firm census or survey data, those figures are no more than best-fit approximations. Their rounding to thousands or higher orders of magnitude is meant to suggest as much; such rounding also avoids the spurious accuracy intimated by the common practice of presenting patently inexact figures down to the single digit. Development Phases Irrespective of the uncertainties clouding the evolving magnitude and composition of Old Bangkok’s multi-ethnic population, it is evident that the city’s many minority communities constituted a lively panoply of individual villages (ban, bang), settlements (nikhom), communes (tambon), neighbourhoods (chumchon), and districts (yan). Together, in the shadow of the city’s many palaces, mansions, temples, and marketplaces, and later its proliferating numbers of shophouses, government offices, and entertainment locales, they set the tone and character of Bangkok’s social and economic life. Bangkok’s urban agglomeration grew throughout the Ratanakosin period as a dispersion of ethnic clusters radiating outward from the royal citadel, strung north-south along the river and east-west along its major side-channels and feeder canals, and later along its growing grid of carriageways. Maps 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 identify the evolving distribution of those minority settlements over three successive phases: (a) the recovery from Ayutthaya’s destruction during the brief Thonburi period (1767–1782); (b) Bangkok’s establishment and expansion over the first three Chakri reigns (1782–1851); and (c) the capital’s accelerated growth and incipient modernization through the fourth and fifth Chakri reigns (1851–1910). Though an oversimplification, it may be said for heuristic purposes that in their ethnic make-up the first phase was marked by Ayutthaya refugees, the second was identified with war captives, and the third was characterized by economic adventurers and wage workers. The first phase (1767–1782), spurred initially by an inflow of Ayutthaya refugees of diverse ethnicity (Map 1.6), saw the start of a sustained revival of the Siamese kingdom. A scattering of Mon, South Asian, indigenized Portuguese, and Hokkien Chinese settlements had since the late Ayutthaya\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 23 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

In the months and years immediately following the 1767 fall of Ayutthaya, a straggle of new communities arrived at Thonburi in response to King Taksin’s efforts to populate his stronghold with the surviving remnants of Ayutthaya’s population. The Thonburi citadel was quickly filled with the residential compounds of the old Thai elite who had managed to survive the slaughter, avoid Burmese captivity, and return from their hinterlands dispersal. The early years of Taksin’s reign also witnessed the establishment of a ring of Mon, Malay, Persian, Arab, Cham, Lao, Portuguese, and Chinese refugee\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 25 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Over the ensuing years, Taksin’s continuing policy of strengthening Thonburi’s military and mercantile position turned to the gathering of immigrants from further afield. A substantial number of Chinese settlers were recruited from Siam’s eastern seaboard provinces and from Taksin’s ancestral Taechiu homeland; they were provided a privileged residential tract directly across the river from the Thonburi citadel. Additional convoys of fugitives from civil war in southern Vietnam were afforded sanctuary at a site directly downstream.

By the close of the Thonburi reign, the capital boasted perhaps 75,000 inhabitants, containing elements of over twelve ethnic minorities. Over the course of the second phase (1782–1851), after the capital’s cross-river relocation and territorial extension, the number of minority settlements scattered about the Bangkok periphery grew rapidly (Map 1.7). Immediately after the 1782 decision to move the citadel to the east bank, the Chinese settlement occupying that precinct was evicted, to be re-established\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 27 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

That new downriver Chinese presence quickly coalesced into Bangkok’s main commercial anchorage and bazaar. In addition, soon after the new capital’s founding, the residential compounds of several ranking Mon and Malay leaders and the associated dwellings of their entourages were established within the city’s noble precincts. On the other hand, with the departure of the Cambodian refugee elite settlement formerly situated within the city wall back to their homeland, the associated Khmer commoner village was relocated to a less eminent site without. Growth of the established Mon, Indian, Persian, Cham, Portuguese, and Chinese communities prompted the hiving off of a number of settlements toward the urban fringe. In addition, a cordon of new settlements of freshly arrived Lao, Malay, and Cham war captives materialized along the urban outskirts during the first and second Chakri reigns. The process of relocating war captives to Siam’s agrarian hinterlands, and their leaderships to the Bangkok outskirts, culminated during the Third Reign. First, the Lao war (the so-called Chao Anu Rebellion) of 1827–1828; second, the extended Vietnamese/Cambodian conflict of 1831–1845; and third, the Patani campaigns of 1832 and 1838 gained Siam a multitude of Lao, Khmer, Cham, Vietnamese, and Malay war captives, with contingents of their elites and leading artisans being diverted to the Bangkok periphery. Throughout the third phase (1851–1910), the city’s ethnic diversity evolved along liberalized lines and at an accelerated pace (Map 1.8). Siam’s negotiation in 1855 of a Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with Great Britain (the Bowring Treaty), followed by a series of virtually identical treaties with other Western powers, opened Bangkok to free trade and extraterritorial privileges for resident Western nationals and their Asian subjects. Although the privileged position of the Chinese merchants who had formerly handled the royal monopoly trade was thereby destroyed, the anticipated decline in the China trade did not occur. Instead, Chinese participation in Bangkok’s export economy continued to expand, in tandem with the Western commercial incursion. With the trade boom, the city’s cosmopolitan population increased rapidly, along with the formation of new Chinese, South Asian, and Western “sojourner” neighbourhoods, inhabited predominantly by hardworking, savings-focused, self-employed, ethnically differentiated entrepreneurs. At the same time, the hardening of Siam’s land borders in the face of encroaching Western imperialism ended the influx of refugees, war captives, and abducted slaves from adjacent states and the peripheral uplands, strangling the cultural vigour of Bangkok’s Lao, Khmer, and other inland-oriented settlements. The changing demographic balance\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 28 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Furthermore, with the relaxation of residential constraints and upgrading of the urban infrastructure, the walled city’s noble precincts — now generally referred to by the Western community as the “City” — were invaded by bourgeois neighbourhoods of Chinese, South Asian, and Western shopkeepers, artisans, and professionals. Through all that, however, the Bangkok citadel remained a Thai royal ceremonial centre and residential enclave until the closing decades of the Fifth Reign and continued even thereafter to resist non-aristocratic intrusion. The Politics of Diversity “Not only was [the] profusion of ethnicities not a problem in the old system, kings positively gloried in it” (Englehart 2001, p. 50). Bangkok’s ethnic diversity advertised the kingdom’s vitality. It spoke to the ruling elite’s success in resolving the traditional manpower problem. Locating the leadership of Siam’s various ethnic minorities at the centre of power, furthermore, facilitated the rulers’ control and patronage of the minorities while providing for their self-representation and the effective negotiation of their concerns. For purposes of administrative expediency, the Siamese feudal state customarily allowed its respective ethnic minorities a high degree of internal autonomy, or self-governance (though — with some exceptions, particularly the “sojourner” communities — they were not thereby absolved of their contributions to the state’s periodic tax or corvée levies). That political strategy, strikingly evident in Old Bangkok, links with the broader proposition that “Bangkok’s political structure was ‘segmentary’ rather than functionally differentiated and organically unified” (Chaiyan 1994, pp. 4–5). It bespoke the rulers’ purposeful “benign neglect” of their minority communities, a policy that persisted until the major government reforms of the 1890s. Under premodern Siam’s feudal policy of indirect rule, the minority communities were allowed to govern their internal affairs under the administration of their own leaders, who were in affirmation thereof awarded senior positions in the nobility — typically at the rank of phraya, roughly equivalent to army colonel, departmental director-general, or provincial governor. Those officials represented their constituencies at court, dealing directly with the state ministers on behalf of their ethnic communities both within the capital and far beyond, extending to the kingdom’s very frontiers. For instance, Chaophraya Mahayotha, head of Siam’s Mon community, served as intermediary for the many Mon settlements of the\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 29 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Under that arrangement, the respective ethnic group leaders were responsible for maintaining their communities’ internal law and order as well as ensuring their compliance with tax impositions in addition to periodic manpower levies for military campaigns, public works projects, state ceremonies, and the like. Many of their daughters were married off into the highest echelons of the ruling elite, ensuring the political integration of their kindreds, and more broadly their ethnic constituencies, into the Siamese state. Bangkok’s minority communities were assigned settlement sites near to or distant from the city centre not so much in keeping with ethnic considerations per se as in correspondence with their political ranking, social status, and occupational skills. First, a ring of leading refugee settlements (Mon, Portuguese, Cham, Persian, Vietnamese, and Hokkien) occupied preferred sites directly adjacent to the Thonburi and Bangkok citadels. Second, ranking settlements of war captives (Lao, Khmer, Malay, and Cham) were situated along the outer periphery of the Thonburi and Bangkok city precincts. Third, a string of “sojourner” settlements (Chinese, South Asian, and Western) stretched along the river well downstream from the walled city. And lastly, small settlements of hereditary slaves (Karen, Khmu, and other nondescript “tribals”) were relegated to the more distant hinterlands, though small groups were assigned to menial service in individual elite households and some of the city’s royal temples. That concentric pattern of ethnic dispersion along the Bangkok periphery was closely paralleled by the dispersal of occupational specializations. In its original conception, Thonburi had been intended specifically to function as a military strongpoint, and early Bangkok continued that emphasis. The river, moats, walls, bastions, and surrounding armed camps all combined to serve as defensive works for the royal redoubt (Naengnoi 1991, pp. 18–25). Surrounding the growing citadel, ethnic minority militias were assigned to serve as the backbone of Bangkok’s defences: Mon gunners and marines were assigned to the fortifications downstream from the capital, and Mon\n\nSiamese Melting Pot : Ethnic Minorities 17-J01416 01 Siamese Melting Pot.inddin the 30 Making of Bangkok, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, 2017.

Thai infantry cohorts, supported by foot soldiers drawn from other ethnic constituencies comprising the bulk of the army, were conscripted from peasant villages scattered far and wide about the Siamese countryside (Battye 1974, pp. 1–63; Snit and Breazeale 1988, pp. 125–26). The loyalty of that military assemblage in warfare was ensured by the dependants left behind in their villages. As artisans, Bangkok’s ethnic minority communities ensured their economic viability by differentiating their occupational skills and products. The Mon were known for brick- and pottery-making; the Khmer were adept at producing ritual paraphernalia such as monks’ alms bowls and funerary fireworks, as well as dance masks, costumes, and musical instruments for pubic entertainments in which they performed; the Lao were master boat-builders and woodworkers; the Cham were expert silk weavers; the Portuguese served the crown as gunsmiths, ships’ chandlers, compradors, and interpreters; the Vietnamese were talented in the decorative arts of stained-glass, niello, mother-of-pearl, and lacquerware; some of the Malays were skilled as boatmen and pilots, and others as gold and silver jewellers. Many of those craftsmen had been brought to Bangkok in the first place specifically to serve in the Royal Artisans Department (krom chang sip mu) (Phromphong 2004). Trade and maritime transport, supported by a broad range of mercantile services, were the traditional specialties of the Chinese and South Asian communities. Over the course of the early Chakri reigns and culminating in the Fourth Reign their mercantile influence spread inexorably beyond the city wall to the riparian districts of Sampheng, Khlong San, and Bang Rak. Later they were joined by an assortment of Western firms reaching downstream to the Yan Nawa and Bang Ko Laem districts. The shoreline downstream from the city came to be pockmarked initially with their lime kilns and then with their rice mills, sawmills, dockyards, and warehouses. Lastly, along the outermost urban periphery, the ethnic minorities cleared tracts for market gardens, fruit orchards, piggeries and poultry runs, livestock pastureland"
