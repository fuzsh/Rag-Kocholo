        "text": "Married princesses\n\nThe son of a holder of the following titles generally inherits a title one step below; a female Mom Rajawongse married to a commoner would produce a child with no title. According to the Royal Marriages Act, B. E. 2475, a princess wishing to marry to a commoner must request royal permission and abandon her royal title. For example, if princess Chao Fa, HRH Princess of Thailand, wished to marry a Mom Rajawongse commoner she would lose her royal title (Chao Fa, HRH Princess of Thailand) but retain royal style as follows:\n\nChao Fa, HRH Princess of Thailand: Tunkramom Ying (daughter of the sovereign with the queen)\n\nTunkramom Ying Ubolratana Rajakanya, formerly Somdet Phra Chao Luk Thoe Chao Fa Ubolratana Rajakanya\n\nChao Fa, HRH Princess of Thailand: Somdet Ying (daughter of the sovereign with the royal consort)\n\nPhra Ong Chao, HRH Princess of Thailand: Sadet Phra Ong Ying (daughter of the sovereign with the concubine)\n\nPhra Ong Chao, HRH Princess of Thailand: Phra Ong Ying (daughter of the son of the sovereign with the queen and his royal consort)\n\nPhra Ong Chao, HH Princess of Thailand: Than Phra Ong Ying (daughter of the son of the sovereign who was elevated from Mom Chao to Phra Ong Chao)\n\nMom Chao, HSH Princess of Thailand: Than Ying (daughter of the son of the sovereign and his consort, or great-granddaughter of the sovereign)\n\nHowever, Chao Fa Chulabhorn Walailak received permission from the king to keep her title when she married commoner Virayudh Tishyasarin.\n\nRoyal peerage\n\nEnacted by King Narayana the Great, the peerage had Krom for managing their household and staffs. Feudal titles were granted until just after the 1932 Revolution brought an end to absolute monarchy, and for that matter, feudalism in Thailand. The titles are now obsolete, although on very rare occasions the king may still grant an honorary feudal title to a royal. The full title granted consists of a prefix, which signifies the rank (à¸à¸£à¸£à¸à¸²à¸¨à¸±à¸à¸à¸´à¹ â Bandasak), and an honorific name (à¸£à¸²à¸à¸à¸´à¸à¸à¸²à¸¡ â Rachatinnanam), which can well be recycled. Taking the above example, the rank was \"Luang\" and the honorific name was \"Narathiwat Rajanakarin\". The appointee would use the full title in place of his names. However, as the honorific name can be repeated, when referring to a previous title holder, his former name may be written in a bracket to avoid confusion, for example: Phraya Kosathibodi (Lek) and Phraya Kosathibodi (Pan).[10]\n\nIt is again a bit more complicated with the Chao Fa and Phra Ong Chao. If given a feudal title, they are said to \"Song Krom\" (à¸à¸£à¸à¸à¸£à¸¡ â lit.: \"take department\", but probably more semantically related to \"take office\"). The title is prefixed with the word \"Krom\" (which will be pronounced \"Kromma\" when forming part of the name), appended to (not replacing) the former princely title. For example, the full title of the King's sister is \"Somdej Phra Chao Pheenang Ther Chao Fa Galyani Vadhana Kromma Luang Narathivat Rajanakarin. Nevertheless, it is the princely title which will be more frequently omitted when contracting the title e.g. Somdej Phra Chao Boromawong Ther Kromma Phraya Damrong Rajanubhab (born Phra Ong Chao Disuankumaan). Feudal titles are not inheritable.[11] There are 5 feudal titles for prince/princess:\n\nThe ranks of royal peerage are:\n\nSomdej Krom Phraya or Somdet Phra (à¸ªà¸¡à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸£à¸°): Highest rank of royal peerage, usually granted to the Queen Mother, Princess Mother and Maha Uparaj. Somdet Phra was created by Rama VI, replacing Krom Somdet (à¸ªà¸¡à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸à¸£à¸°à¸¢à¸² à¸«à¸£à¸·à¸­ à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸ªà¸¡à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸£à¸°).\n\nQueen Mothers:\n\nSomdet Phra Amarindra Borommarachini: HM Queen Amarindra, Queen Mother of Rama II\n\nSomdet Phra Suriyendra Borommarachini: HM Queen Sri Suriyendra, Queen Mother of Rama IV\n\nSomdet Phra Debsirindra Borommarachini: HM Queen Debsirindra, Queen Mother of Rama V\n\nSomdet Phra Sri Bajarindra Borommarachininat: HM Queen Sri Bajarindra, Queen Mother of Rama VI and Rama VII\n\nPrincess Mothers:\n\nSomdet Phra Sri Sulalai: HRH Princess Sri Sulalai, Princess Mother of Rama III\n\nSomdet Phra Srinagarindra Borommaratchachonnani: HRH Princess Srinagarindra, Princess Mother of Rama VIII and Rama IX\n\nViceroys:\n\nSomdet Phra Bowararat Chao Maha Sura Singhanat: HRH Prince Maha Sura Singhanat, Viceroy of Rama I\n\nSomdet Phra Bowararat Chao Maha Senanurak: HRH Prince Maha Senanurak, Viceroy of Rama II\n\nSomdet Phra Bowararat Chao Maha Sakdi Balasebya: HRH Prince Maha Sakdi Balasebya, Viceroy of Rama III\n\nKrom Phra (à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸à¸£à¸°)\n\nKrom Phra Srisavangvadhana: Her Royal Highness Princess Chulabhorn, The Princess Srisavangvadhana, Daughter of Rama IX and Sister of Rama X\n\nKromma Luang (à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸«à¸¥à¸§à¸)\n\nKromma Khun (à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸à¸¸à¸) Chao Fa starts from this title\n\nKromma Muen (à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸«à¸¡à¸·à¹à¸) Phra Ong Chao starts from this title\n\nKromma Muen Suddhanarinatha: Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali, The Princess Suddhanarinatha, Mother of the First Child of Rama X\n\nSince the time of King Chulalongkorn, the honorific titles given to the royalties normally incorporate a city name or its modified form, and the holders are known in English as the Prince or Princess of that city.\n\nThe sovereign may grant titles to other royal-family members:\n\nSomdet Phra Prathom Borom Ratchachonok: HRH Prince Father of Rama I\n\nSomdet Phra Rupsirisobakya Mahanaknari: HRH Princess Rupsirisobakya Mahanaknari, Mother of Queen Amarindra\n\nSomdet Phra Piyamavadi Sri Bajarindra Mata: HRH Princess Piyamavadi Sri Bajarindra Mata, Mother of Queen Saovabha Bongsri\n\nSomdet Phra Sri Savarindira Barom Raja Devi: HM Queen Sri Savarindira, Queen Grandmother of Rama VIII and Rama IX\n\nSomdet Phra Mahitaladhibes Adulyadejvikrom Phra Borom Ratchachonok: HRH Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, Prince Father of Rama VIII and Rama IX\n\nSomdet Phra Debaratanarajasuda Chao Fa Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Rathasimagunakornpiyajat Sayamboromrajakumari: HRH Princess Sirindhorn, the Princess Royal (Daughter of Rama IX and Younger Sister of Rama X)"
