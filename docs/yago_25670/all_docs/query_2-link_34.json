        "text": "Wat Suthat Thepwararam sits serenely beside Bangkok's Giant Swing. Its majestic ubosoth in typical Siamese architectural style is known around the world and draws hordes of tourists and locals each day.\n\nHaving undergone a major renovation almost two decades ago, it is now time for the temple to be given an overhaul again.\n\nYet despite its importance to both Buddhists and the tourism trade, this internationally important temple has not drawn the necessary funds to carry out the task.\n\nWat Suthat Thepwararam is recognised as a symbol of Bangkok, like the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the Grand Palace and Wat Benchamabophit.\n\nHis Majesty King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, or King Rama I the Great, started the construction of Wat Suthat Thepwararam in 1807. He had its edifice built first to house the Phra Srisakayamuni Buddha image, also known as Luang Por To (Big Buddha image) from Wat Maha That temple in Sukhothai province. At that time Wat Suthat Thepwararam was called Wat Phra To (the temple of the Big Buddha image) or Wat Sao Chingcha (the temple of the Giant Swing).\n\nHis Majesty King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, or King Rama II, proceeded with the construction and carved the doors of the edifice himself.\n\nWat Suthat Thepwararam was completed in 1847 during the reign of His Majesty King Nangklao, or King Rama III, who named it Wat Suthat Thepwararam.\n\nWat Suthat Thepwararam is one of six Grade A royal Buddhist temples. The other five are Wat Phra Chetuphon Wimon Mangkhalaram, Wat Maha That Yuwarat Rangsarit, Wat Arun Ratchawararam (the Temple of Dawn), Wat Phra Pathommachedi in Nakhon Phathom province, and Wat Phra Phutthabat in Saraburi province.\n\nWat Suthat Thepwararam is assigned to be the temple of His Majesty King Ananda Mahidol, or King Rama VIII. The king's relics have been kept under Phra Srisakayamuni Buddha image since 1950 and there is a religious ceremony to remember the king on June 9, the day of his death.\n\nPhrarajvijitphatiphan, the assistant abbot of Wat Suthat Thepwararam, said that due to financial constraints, the latest renovation is being done in stages. It began with the pavilions around the preaching pavilion.\n\nLater renovations will be expanded to the monks' quarters, the residence of the abbot, the chapel, the roofs of the galleries around the edifice housing the large Buddha image, the roof of the edifice and the murals in the temple.\n\nRepairs to the murals must be done under the supervision of experts from the Fine Arts Department. It requires fine skill and a knowledge of history. The entire renovation of Wat Suthat Thepwararam is expected to take five to six years.\n\n\"The temple has only about 30 million baht, comprising funds from the National Office of Buddhism and its own savings, but the whole renovation will cost as much as 250 million baht. Therefore, it must be done in stages,\" Phrarajvijitphatiphan said.\n\nAccording to the assistant abbot, the management of Wat Suthat Thepwararam will request sponsorship from the Crown Property Bureau which always funds the renovation of royal temples nationwide.\n\n\"The temple is also waiting for donations from the general public who want to help in the conservation of this important Thai archaeological site,\" Phrarajvijitphatiphan said.\n\nThe assistant abbot noted that people in general tend to donate to other temples and monasteries because they assume that royal temples are financially healthy.\n\nPhrarajvijitphatiphan is supervising the latest renovation, just as he did with the previous one (its first restoration) between 1985 and 1994 when the cost came to 150 million baht.\n\n\"It is difficult to renovate a temple to its original beauty ... Its construction is very exquisite and it took as long as 40 years to complete,\" he said.\n\nThe two-century-old temple was made of concrete and wood.\n\nWithout a piling technique at that time, it stands on a giant basket of buried logs that is filled with layers of soil and bricks and encompasses the 25-rai (40,000-square-metre) compound of the temple.\n\nPhrarajvijitphatiphan pointed out that apart from money, the renovation also requires love and knowledge.\n\n\"With love but without knowledge, the renovation will be the destruction of the historical place and its old treasures.With knowledge but without love, it will be ignored,\" the assistant abbot said."
