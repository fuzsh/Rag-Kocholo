        "text": "Learn James Blunt Songs on Guitar\n\nJames Blunt is a British singer-songwriter and record producer who plays multiple instruments too. Heâ€™s also a former soldier who was posted in Kosovo under NATO.\n\nJames got into music after leaving the military and immediately achieved a cult following with his debut album called back to Bedlam in 2004.\n\nBlunt plays the guitar well, having been introduced to it at quite a young age. He took it with him to Kosovo, strapped it to the outside of his tank, and played for locals and troops. He plays guitar live at all of his concerts as well."
