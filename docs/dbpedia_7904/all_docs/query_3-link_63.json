        "text": "Internationally renowned pop rock artist James Blunt has announced an accompanying tour for his upcoming seventh album, titled ‘Who We Used To Be’, which was announced on August 2nd. His first full-length release since 2019’s ‘Once Upon A Mind’, which hit #3 on the UK Albums chart, the album has been one of the most highly anticipated releases of the still-young decade – and the leap year tour is equally anticipated, with the rare opportunity to see one of the best selling artists of the 2000s/10s in person.\n\nJames Blunt (originally spelled Blount) is easily described as a jack of all trades – besides his multi-platinum music career, he has been a pilot, a philanthropist, and strangely enough, a military vet that could’ve started World War 3. He was a key figure in the Incident at Pristina, a confrontation between Russian and NATO forces in the aftermath of the Kosovo War, where he refused orders to attack the Russian forces, perhaps saving thousands of lives. Since leaving the military in 2002, Blunt settled down into a more peaceful life, giving up the guns for the guitars, and started recording music. Blunt’s 2004 debut, ‘Back to Bedlam’, was at one point the best selling album of the 21st century in the UK, and continues to be the best-selling debut by a British artist ever – he hasn’t slowed down a bit since 2004, either, and he continues to rock the world with albums like ‘Who We Used To Be’.\n\nBlunt’s seventh album continues the same emotional, deeply rooted musical style that his first album employed. The album’s first single, ‘Beside You’, has already captured the hearts of national and international audiences alike for Blunt’s powerful vocal delivery, the emotions behind the song and the brilliant music video released alongside it, which came with the album’s announcement earlier this month. ‘Beside You’ will undoubtedly be one of the tracks that Blunt performs when he goes on tour during the next year of the dragon, which you can find out more about later this month, when more information becomes available.\n\nWatch the video for ‘Beside You’ here, and stay tuned for more info on Blunt’s latest tour/album."
