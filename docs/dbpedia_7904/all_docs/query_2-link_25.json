        "text": "I have the 'Back to Bedlam' CD and I like his music. I think he is a talented singer-songwriter and some of his songs have obviously been influenced by his army experience, especially 'No Bravery', which has words worthy of any war poet:\n\nThere are children standing here,\n\nArms outstretched into the sky,\n\nTears drying on their face.\n\nHe has been here.\n\nBrothers lie in shallow graves.\n\nFathers lost without a trace.\n\nA nation blind to their disgrace,\n\nSince he's been here.\n\nAnd I see no bravery,\n\nNo bravery in your eyes anymore.\n\nOnly sadness.\n\nHouses burnt beyond repair.\n\nThe smell of death is in the air.\n\nA woman weeping in despair says,\n\nHe has been here.\n\nTracer lighting up the sky.\n\nIt's another family's turn to die.\n\nA child afraid to even cry out says,\n\nHe has been here.\n\nAnd I see no bravery,\n\nNo bravery in your eyes anymore.\n\nOnly sadness.\n\nThere are children standing here,\n\nArms outstretched into the sky,\n\nBut no one asks the question why,\n\nHe has been here.\n\nOld men kneel and accept their fate.\n\nWives and daughters cut and raped.\n\nA generation drenched in hate.\n\nYes, he has been here.\n\nAnd I see no bravery,\n\nNo bravery in your eyes anymore.\n\nOnly sadness."
