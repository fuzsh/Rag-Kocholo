        "text": "Crowd for James Blunt who returned to play in Italy for a single date at the Forum in Assago, this evening, Saturday 2 March 2024.\n\nHonestly, I’ve never been a big fan of Blunt, I’ll admit it straight away.\n\nEven though I knew almost all the songs played this evening, he is one of those artists that I always listen to distractedly without ever really hearing him.\n\nThe concert was therefore a wonderful opportunity to consolidate my opinion of disinterest or change my mind and start listening to his music better.\n\nA well-balanced set that lasted just over an hour and a half with a clean stage with a large horizontal wall and a lighting set without major special effects, made with chandeliers that rose and fell as necessary, making it intimate and almost club the scenario.\n\nI was afraid of falling into the honey of his pop made of romance and melancholy, but instead Blunt managed to propose the right alternation of slow, acoustic, piano and super sugary songs with dynamic ballads that made the Forum dance and sing.\n\nJames on stage, together with his four-piece band, did not hold back, he sang, played the guitar, played the piano, danced, talked and even did a tribute round of hugs in the Forum parterre for the occasion , set up with all the seats.\n\nThe setlist includes all his main hits which led him to win two BRIT Music Awards and two MTV Video Music Awards, including the global hits “You’re Beautiful”, “Bonfire Heart” and “1973”.\n\nAmong the songs there are also some songs from his latest album “WhoWe Used To Be” released last year.\n\nA comment also on the public. I didn’t expect to find such a full forum. Crowding the stands and audience were a varied population of thirty and forty year olds. Few very young people.\n\nPerhaps the same audience that crowds stadiums and arenas for characters like Ed Sheeran, Coldplay or on the Italian front the Nuclear Tactical Penguins.\n\nA composed audience that wants to stimulate good feelings and be filled with love and romance.\n\nIn the end it was a beautiful evening. I won’t become a fan of Blunt, but at least this time I listened carefully to his music and in the end I liked it!\n\nSCORE: 7.00\n\nTHE LADDER\n\nBeside You\n\nSaving a Life\n\nWisemen\n\nCarry You Home\n\nAll the Love That I Ever Needed\n\nDark Thought\n\nGoodbye My Lover\n\nGlow\n\nHigh\n\nThe Girl That Never Was\n\nPostcards\n\nI Won’t Die With You\n\nCoz I Luv You\n\nYou’re Beautiful\n\nSame Mistake\n\nStay the Night\n\nOK\n\n(Robin Schulz cover)\n\nEncore:\n\nMonsters\n\nBonfire Heart\n\n1973\n\nWEB & SOCIAL"
