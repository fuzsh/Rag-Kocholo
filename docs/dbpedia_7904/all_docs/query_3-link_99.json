        "text": "The year is 2004 and it’s impossible to spend a day without hearing James Blunt sing You’re Beautiful or Goodbye My Lover. We are depressed, and we blame him for it. The world was simpler at that time.\n\nJames Blunt’s first album Back to Bedlam was a success and was the best-selling album of the 2000s decade in the United Kingdom. He went on to have a great career, releasing five other albums since.\n\nYet, most people still believe all he ever did was sing a few sad songs almost 20 years ago.\n\nSo, I think it’s time to give James Blunt another chance. He might surprise you.\n\nSad songs?\n\nDoes he only write sad songs? Far from it, though he is really good at it. If you think Goodbye My Lover is sad, give If Times Is All I Have and Same Mistake a listen. Or Carry You Home. Or Cry. Or No Bravery.\n\nOkay, maybe he does make a lot of sad songs. But we need them, right? We all need to hear someone else sing the pain we keep inside. It’s therapeutic."
