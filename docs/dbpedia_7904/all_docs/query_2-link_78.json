        "text": "Meaning that the word love has no meaning if someone contiues to treat there partner badly. As for the intruments that are used in the song, the whole song uses a synth for all the instruments and it has a very slow melody to go with it. When it comes to how this song connects to my life, I think that most people can relate to how the word \"love\" is really thrown around. specifically in the lyrics \" What`s love got to do, got to do with it, Who needs a heart, When a heart can be broken\". I know for a fact that I have thrown around that word carlessly before in past relationships. What I like most about this song is really the lyrics, I actually had to sit down and read the lyrics over a few times to get a real understanding of what she was trying to say in this song. What I dislike the most abou this song is also the lyrics. Throughout the song It seemed to me like some of the lines of what she was saying werent really connecting together. This song gives me a very relaxed feeling and makes me feel like im on a beach somewhere in the 80s drinking crystal\n\nI believe that Katy Perry’s “firework” is a song that uses a lot of personification, imagery, and it also shows similes. The song is about a mentally weak person who is going through a tough time and feels useless. The song is meant for people going through the same thing and it is telling them that they are themselves and that they are amazing. The song also suggests that the listener is a beautiful person in their own ways and they should not worry about what other people say about them.\n\nI relate the song Set Fire to the Third Bar to the rising action of the book I Will Always Write Back. The rising action is a series of events leading towards the most exciting part in the story the climax. In the rising action of the book, it is a very truthful and sad part talking about what Martin has to go through, but also how his relationship with Caitlin grows to be stronger and stronger. In the song, it is also sad because it is talking about two people and how hard their long distance relationship can be when all they really want to do is to be with each other.\n\nMusic dates back to when cavemen roamed the land. Many scientist believe the first musical instrument was a hollow stick which one would blow in and a sound would come out. Music is many words spoken at a rhythm to show emotion. Music is in many cultures throughout history. In 2500 BCE an early trumpet was made. The guitar was made in the 1500 BCE by the Hittites. Nowadays there are hundreds if not even thousands of types of music. Music will continue to change throughout history.\n\n“Do you know that there's still a chance for you, cause there's a spark in you? You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine… Cause baby you're firework. Come on, show them what you're worth” This is another lyric from the song, “firework,” by Katy Perry. This is the punch line, the person changes from feeling like a “plastic bag” to know that every person has his/her own value. In the poem, the “young man” had a life changing lesson by being near and observing the Sea. The sea calms him and makes him realize that he is a part of the “pure movement” of the universe. The poem dose, inspires me, I came up with a thought after I read the poem. The society is like a puzzle and people are the piece of it. The puzzle is not complete even if only one single piece is missing. So everyone belongs to the big picture. We are all part of the society, and we all have our own role. My connection with the sea is different from the Neruda. Living in a city with a busy life, I seldom go to the sea. But the sea still means a lot to me. I came from Hong Kong. I came half way across the Ocean to America, and my life changed completely. Whenever I see a Sea, I think about my\n\nThe common theme throughout the book is about loving this girl with all you have. It goes through the feelings of love and heartbreaks, along with the feeling of exhilaration. The poem's overall setting is in a person's mind, or a viewpoint of how this person feels and is going through. There are many conflicts that happen throughout this poem and just some of those happen to be that the view of this person is going through a heartbreak which is later told through the journey of the book how it feels and why they are so hurt."
