        "text": "2012\n\nFor '21', Adele won all six of the categories she was nominated for at the Grammys, including Album of the Year - this made her the second female artist in history to win that many awards in one single night after Beyonc√©. She also won the British Album of the Year at the BRIT Awards. Adele also co-wrote and performed the title track to the 2012 James Bond film, Skyfall.\n\nAdele announced in April 2012 that she would be taking a couple of years off, saying: \"I have to take time and live a little bit. There were a good two years between my first and second albums, so it'll be the same this time.\" In June 2012, Adele announced that she was expecting her first baby with Simon, and their son Angelo was born in October that year.\n\n2015\n\nAdele released her single 'Hello' in October 2015, and released her third album, '25', in November 2015. She said of the album: \"My last record was a break-up record, and if I had to label this one, I would call it a make-up record. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. 25 is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened.\"\n\nIt debuted at Number 1 in the UK and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. It was the best-selling album worldwide of 2015, and stayed at the top of the UK charts for seven weeks.\n\n2017\n\nAdele continued her world tour in 2017, and ended it with two dates in Wembley. She'd added a further two, but was forced to cancel them after damaging her voice. Adele won all five of her nominations at the Grammy Awards 2017: '25' won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, and 'Hello' won Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance. She dedicated her Album of the Year win to Beyonc√©, and said that she should have won instead for 'Lemonade', saying in her acceptance speech: \"I can't possibly accept this award. And I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful and gracious. But my artist of my life is Beyonc√©. And this album to me, the 'Lemonade' album, is just so monumental. Beyonc√©, it's so monumental. And so well thought out, and so beautiful and soul-baring and we all got to see another side to you that you don't always let us see. And we appreciate that. And all us artists here adore you. You are our light.\"\n\nShe also performed a tribute to George Michael, who passed away on Christmas Day 2016. She sang 'Fastlove', and had to restart due to technical difficulties, telling the audience: \"I can't mess this up for him.\" Adele also confirmed she'd gotten married to Simon Konecki in her Grammys Album acceptance speech.\n\n2020\n\nAdele appeared as a host on Saturday Night Live in October 2020, writing on Instagram: 'Had the best time on SNL! Thank you to the most wonderful cast, crew, writers and producers. What a sublime bunch of people you are. Lorne thank you for believing in me! Lindsay my sister for life, Maya my comedy and Mama hero! Plus the so up for it audiences at both the dress rehearsal and live show! I did it for the joy of it and I hope you got some from it too! Good luck with the election America I love you so much. Look after each other and go easy on yourselves. Happy Halloween! I'm going back to my cave now to be the (single) cat lady that I am! Peace out til next year ‚ô•Ô∏è.'\n\nShe also wrote before her performance: 'Bloooooody hellllll I'm so excited about this!! And also absolutely terrified! My first ever hosting gig and for SNL of all things!!!! I've always wanted to do it as a stand alone moment, so that I could roll up my sleeves and fully throw myself into it, but the time has never been right. But if there was ever a time for any of us to jump head first into the deep end with our eyes closed and hope for the best it's 2020 right? It'll be almost 12 years to the day that I first appeared on the show, during an election... which went on to break my career in America, so it feels full circle and I just couldn't possibly say no! I am besides myself that H.E.R will be the musical guest!! I love her SO much I can't wait to melt into a flaming hot mess when she performs, then confuse myself while I laugh my arse off in between it all. See you next week ‚ô•Ô∏èü§ûüèª.'\n\n2021\n\nOn Friday 15th October 2021, Adele delighted fans around the world when she released her first single in nearly six years 'Easy On Me'. The video even features scenes from the same house where the video for 'Hello' was filmed. The single was the first off of Adele's new album '30', which was released in November 2021. Adele revealed the album was for her son Angelo: \"The whole album is sort of dedicated to my son more than anything, but yeah it's about my relationship with his dad and with him, but also you know the relationship I have with myself and stuff like that.\""
