        "text": "James Blunt (born James Blount in Tidworth, Wiltshire, England on February 22, 1977) is an English musician whose debut album, Back To Bedlam, and single releases - especially number one hit \"You're Beautiful\" - brought him to fame in 2005. His style has been described as a mix of jazz, rock and soul, and comparisons have been made between him and early Elton John. Along with the vocals of the album, Blunt plays a variety of instruments including the piano, guitar and organ.\n\nBlount (the name was changed for his music career) was born at a British Army hospital, the son and grandson of senior army officers. He was sent to board at Elstree School aged seven, and at thirteen was accepted into Harrow School. While there, and aged only sixteen, he became one of the youngest holders of a UK Private Pilot Licence. He read aeronautical engineering at Bristol University on an army bursary which required him to enlist on graduation. He joined the Life Guards the senior regiment in the British Army. During his four years service he was promoted to Captain with the British Army and served as a NATO peacekeeper in Kosovo, one of the first to enter those areas where war crimes had been committed. It was this experience that led to his writing of the song \"No Bravery\". After his tour of duty in Kosovo he was sent to Switzerland where he became the captain of the Household Cavalry downhill ski team. One of his final duties in the army before retirement was the funeral of the Queen Mother on April 9, 2002, where he carried her coffin. He has said that he had been shot at more times than 50 Cent. (Nyhetsmorgon interview on TV4)\n\n****\n\nEarly Success\n\nJames Blunt's debut single in the UK, \"High,\" peaked below the Top 100 of the UK Singles Chart. However, the song was chosen to appear in a Vodafone commercial in Italy, and as a result ended up becoming a Top 10 hit in that country. His second single \"Wisemen\" improved upon that position with a #44 peak in the UK.\n\nHowever, it was the third single \"You're Beautiful\" that became Blunt's breakthrough hit. The song debuted at #12 in the UK, and demonstrated a rare trend of upward mobility on the UK charts, rising all the way to the #1 position, six weeks after its debut. The song also received massive airplay in the UK which was able to propel Back To Bedlam to #1 on the albums chart, with the special feat of unseating the record-breaking album X & Y by Coldplay from the pole position.\n\nAfter the success of \"You're Beautiful\" in the UK, the song crossed over to mainland Europe, becoming one the biggest hits of summer 2005 across the continent. In the USA, \"You're Beautiful\" was only later released to radio, after receiving airplay on WPLJ, a prominent radio station in New York City. Since then, the single has reached #22 on the Adult Top 40 chart and #19 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nThe videos for all three of James Blunt's singles to date feature symbolism and dark imagery. In the video for \"High\", James is buried in a desert. In the video for \"Wisemen,\" James is kidnapped and held hostage. In the video for \"You're Beautiful,\" James alludes to suicide.\n\nBlunt has recorded a new, less 'controversial' video for the re-release of the single 'High', which was released on 3rd Oct 2005. The new video contains several lingering close ups with light trickery and scenes of him running at full speed through a forest.\n\nHis next single is expected to be \"Goodbye My Lover,\" due for release in December. The video features English-born stateside actress Mischa Barton (The O.C, Notting Hill, The Sixth Sense), who also assisted James in giving his acceptance speech at the 2005 MTV EMAs.
