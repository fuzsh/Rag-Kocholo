        "text": "In this acoustic guitar lesson, I will show you how to play all the chords to James Blunt's massive hit \"You're Beautiful\".\n\nFirst things first, we are in standard tuning with this one, but you will need to place a capo at the 8th fret in order to play all of those higher voiced chords like James Blunt does on the original recording.\n\nWhen you finally get your guitar all set up, you will find that the chords used throughout this You're Beautiful guitar lesson are very easy to play even though they are so far up the fretboard. You may need to get acclimated to those higher frets though.\n\nThe are a few different sections you will be learning even though most of the use the same chords as other parts of the song.\n\nThe main thing you will want to focus on is how many beats each chord is played before moving to the next since the timing of the chords in each section can vary.\n\nAlso, the ending can be a little bit confusing so I decided to go through the entire ending by giving you the exact minutes and seconds that the section starts in the song. In that way, there will be a lot less confusion I hope.\n\nHope you guys enjoy learning this great acoustic guitar song!\n\nCarl...\n\nIf these free lessons help you, please donate to keep new ones coming daily. Thanks!! ðŸ™‚\n\nYou're Beautiful Guitar Lesson - James Blunt"
