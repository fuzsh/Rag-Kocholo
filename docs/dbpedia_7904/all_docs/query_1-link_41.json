        "text": "Lesson 1 : Bonfire Heart - James Blunt - Guitar Lesson\n\nJames Blunt is a British singer-songwriter and widely known for his major hits such as âYouâre Beautifulâ and âGoodbye My Loverâ. âBonfire Heartâ is the first single from his fourth studio album âMoon Landingâ, released in 2013, and was co-written with OneRepublicâs lead singer Ryan Tedder.\n\nThe song features an easy progression in standard tuning and contains the I, III, IV, V, and VI chords in the key of C. It involves a somewhat tricky, but straight forward fingerpicking pattern and fast upbeat strumming. Also the barre chords that James uses might be challenging for beginner.\n\nLesson 2 : Goodbye My Lover - James Blunt - Guitar Lesson\n\nThe heartbreaking âGoodbye My Loverâ is a song written by singer-songwriter James Blunt and Sacha Skarbek, for Bluntâs debut album âBack To Bedlamâ, which also features his biggest hit âYouâre Beautifulâ.\n\nThe original is recorded on a piano in the absolute key of E. The lesson is presented in the key of C, using chords I, III, IV, V and VI, capoed on the IV fret, to make it doable for all guitar players.\n\nThe arrangement is based on the original, as well as Jamesâ playing on stage and a tiny bit on how he plays it on the guitar, which he rarely does.\n\nSince James plays this very randomly and different from the album version, the student is encouraged to do the same and make the song their own.\n\nTheir is also a segment how to play this song in the key of D, using Dropped D-tuning.\n\nLesson 3 : You're Beautiful - James Blunt - Guitar Lesson\n\nYouâre Beautiful is a song co-written by British singer-songwriter James Blunt for his 2004 debut album, âBack To Bedlamâ. It was released as the third single and became his biggest hit in the US.\n\nThe song features a very common I, V, VI, IV progression in the key of G, capoed at the 8th fret, and a moderately fast strumming pattern. It is fun to play and a great start for beginners.\n\nLesson 5 : Postcards - James Blunt - Guitar Lesson\n\nThe âjauntyâ Postcards is the 10th track of singer-songwriter James Bluntâs recent album âMoon Landingâ.\n\nThe lesson covers Jamesâ ukelele part in the key of Bb, a guitar part in the key of G and a second guitar part, copying the keyboard, in the absolute key of B.\n\nThe song features five chords, I, II, IV, V and VI, an easy progression, upbeat fast strumming and happy lyrics, which makes it a very fun song to play."
