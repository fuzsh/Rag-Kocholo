        "text": "The Campion School aims to be an outstanding Roman Catholic school with a strong and united community in which everyone contributes to the school’s religious and educational objectives. The school was established by the Society of Jesus in 1962 and it bears the name of one of the most famous English Jesuits who was martyred for the Faith in 1581, Edmund Campion, S.J. The school has developed its own distinctive Catholic ethos and traditions, building on those first endowed upon it by the Jesuits. It seeks to draw on the long-established Jesuit educational ideals of a Catholic community in which endeavour and opportunity lead students to the highest levels of achievement. The most recent Diocesan and Ofsted inspections described the school as an ‘outstanding Catholic school’ and a ‘good school with many outstanding features’. We are proud of our successes and have ambitious plans to develop and improve the school further. “Success and personal endeavour are encouraged, rewarded and celebrated. There is a strong ethos of not only wanting to do well but about being proud of doing so.” We have a long-standing tradition of providing a rich and varied curriculum to stimulate and interest students. Each individual is given the appropriate support to achieve their full potential. For example, students who are particularly gifted or talented may be offered courses operated by the London Borough of Havering and during lessons they are often given extension work to stretch and challenge. In 2019, our Year 11 students achieved excellent GCSE results, with 89% achieving grade 4 and above in English and mathematics. Furthermore, 43% of students achieved the EBacc. The numbers achieving two good grades in science and at least one good grade in a modern foreign language are also very high by local and national comparisons."
