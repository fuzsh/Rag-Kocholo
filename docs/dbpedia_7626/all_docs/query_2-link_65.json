        "text": "Sport at Canford is about providing opportunities for our pupils to be physically active, to be challenged and to develop core life skills which they can take with them beyond school.\n\nOur programme looks to give all our pupils the chance to explore the benefits that sport offers, allow them to express themselves through their physical wellbeing activities and facilitate those who wish to excel in their chosen path.\n\nThere is plenty of choice for sport within the school's 250 acres of grounds. Impressive facilities include squash courts, two Astroturf pitches and an historic Real Tennis court - Canford is one of only two schools in the country to possess an original one. The Sports Centre boasts a double court sports hall, 25 station fitness suite, dance / spinning studio, 25m 6 lane indoor heated swimming pool and recently updated strength & conditioning room with bespoke lifting platforms and racks. Few schools can boast their own golf course in the grounds and the sport is widely enjoyed. The proximity of the river is exploited by our rowers and the ample, flat playing fields encourage high standards.\n\nThe Canford coaching team works closely with the school's Head of Wellbeing to ensure that every pupil feels confident, supported and appropriately challenged to gain the most they can from sporting activity."
