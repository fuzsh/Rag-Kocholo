        "text": "In the latest of outstanding young sports prospects from the Shotley peninsula, Nub News gets Up Close with rugby star Sam Gibson ahead of the National Schools Rugby Festival this weekend.\n\nSam Gibson is a teenager with a plan, and is one of those rare 17-year-olds with back up too,\n\nBursting with passion for his chosen sport, pride at playing with his mates at St Joseph's College in a huge tournament and excited with what his own future may hold, Sam tackles our interview they way he plays his rugby - fully committed.\n\nAfter starting out playing with a round ball at Holbrook Hornets, Sam was persuaded to give rugby a go, and has never looked back, except to hand off a despairing tackler.\n\n\"A mate back then suggested I took up rugby as I was bigger than everyone else in my age group,\" said Sam who lives in Shotley with his parents and brothers. \"I just found I loved it from very early on and just carried on playing.\"\n\nIt was not just his size, that caught the eye, but his undoubted talent in the pack that earned him the offer of a couple of scholarships after impressing at a tournament while playing for Holbrook Academy at a tournament, while in Year Nine.\n\nSt Joseph's has been ideal fit for the young forward who has played for Eastern Counties and is part of the Under 18s squad for the upcoming season.\n\nThe East of England squad is a breeding ground for both Premiership giants Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers and competition for places is fierce, so coming through the pre-season selection process, despite a hamstring tear, was quite an achievement.\n\nSam said: \"This is a big season for me with Eastern Counties and playing for St Jo's too.\n\n\"We know the Saints and Tigers, which is a high level, will be watching us closely and if they like the look of us then we could be taken on as a professional.\"\n\nThe first step though is a big competition coming up this weekend when St Joseph's hosts\n\n\"I played up a year last season and found it was one of the best experiences I have had in rugby so far,\" said Sam. \"It is the biggest schools tournament in the UK, the crowds are huge, the games are live-streamed, it is an amazing experience.\n\n\"It will be last one so it is really important.\"\n\nHowever, it is clear that not only does Sam have a good rugby brain but he has a wise head on young shouts as we talk about the possibility of becoming a pro and pursing a lucrative career in the game.\n\nSam said: \"I would like to look at it as an option. But my back up is still full time education.\"\n\nSam is exploring opportunities to go abroad and board at schools, earning money coaching children, while playing and continuing his own education in Australia or New Zealand.\n\nHe has looked at France or a scholarship in America but has reservation as rugby is not big in the USA..\n\nHis interest in going abroad has been piqued by friends he has made at St Jo's, particular with two lads from South Africa and France, who will be playing this weekend.\n\n\"Pierre is a different level, I have learned lots of things from him from him He has come from Racing 92 and the French play differently to the any we do and as he is an international\n\n\" I have seen the intensity he has and how he never stops.\"\n\nSam admits he would never go back to football, or entertain other sports as his love of rugby is all-consuming.\n\nHe said: \"There is lots more passion and discipline in rugby\n\n\"It is so easy to play as part of team and making decisions together quickly because it is always moving, unlike football which is stop start.\n\n\"There is no better feeling than that adrenalin before every match and I just look forward to playing.\n\n\"I love being in the pack. I love the aggression.\"\n\nYou can see Sam in action this weekend at the 36th St Joseph's College National Schools Rugby Festival, with his side playing their first game on Pitch One at 11am on Saturday morning\n\nThis event, established in 1986, is recognised as the most prestigious schoolboy rugby tournament in the country and is an established date in the calendars and fixture lists of some of the country's top rugby-playing schools.\n\nIn recent years some of rugby's biggest stars have graced the St Joseph's College pitches.\n\nChris Robshaw, Mako Vinupola, Jonathan Joseph, Christian Wade, Jamie Roberts, Matt Dawson, Mike Tindall, Andy Goode, James Haskell, Tony Diprose and Tom Rees are just some of the players who have stamped their mark on the Festival before going on to international fame.\n\nMore festival details here...\n\nOther young Shotley sports people featured:\n\nChampionship winner Harrison Bacon\n\nSweet revenger for Josh Stokes"
