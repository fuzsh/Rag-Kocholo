        "text": "ABOUT THE SCHOOL\n\nThe Campion School has three main aims:\n\nto develop in its pupils inquiring minds through the study of a broad range of subjects and through the encouragement of self-discipline and hard work in the pursuit of excellence;\n\nto encourage young people to fully develop themselves intellectually, socially, emotionally, physically and spiritually through academic study and through participation in extra curricular activities;\n\nto lead young people to faith in Christ and to mature understanding of the Catholic Faith.\n\nAN EXTRACT FROM CAMPION'S BRAG\n\nThe School motto is \"Auctore Deo\", which means \"the Enterprise is of God\", and is taken from an extract of the booklet written by Campion called \"The Brag\". It reminds us that all that we do is with God and for God:\n\n\"The expense is reckoned, the enterprise is begun; it is of God, it cannot be withstood. So the faith was planted: so it must be restored.\""
