        "text": "Book now for the Building Connections: Developing Schools as Community Hubs webinar. Learning Environments New Zealand, in association with TƒÅrai Kura, offers the opportunity to explore latest research and propositions to create successful school-community hubs. Invariably, schools foster valuable social connections and networks. Yet only some intentionally pursue ‚Äòmore than a school‚Äô operations to achieve positive education, health and wellbeing impacts for students, staff, families and members of the broader community. NZIA Registered Architects can apply for 10 CPD points for attending this event. üì∑John Citizen of ABC Photographers http://ow.ly/qIkE50L5nff #NZArchitecture #SchoolDesign #Education #LearningSpaces #Education #LENZ\n\nIt has been a privilege to facilitate community engagement in ≈åmokoroa for the new primary and secondary schools planned for the region, designed to ensure the voices, aspirations, and cultural values of the ≈åmokoroa community are heard. Appointed by the Ministry of Education of New Zealand, Warren and Mahoney will prepare the masterplans for the new schools, providing capacity for 1950 students. W+M Principal and Education Specialist Sarah Hewlett Diprose says the team is thrilled with the level of engagement to date. \"To achieve spaces that support kotahitanga, are welcoming, connected and centre around quality learning outcomes, it is so important that we hear from the wider community. We recognise that it is no longer enough to consider educational buildings as just spaces for learning - they need to be diverse, interactive environments which inspire, educate and cultivate a strong sense of community and inclusivity. The community engagement principle emphasises that the curriculum and learning environment should have meaning for students, connect with their wider lives, and engage the support of their families, whanau and communities.\" Read more: https://lnkd.in/gZMhSMAP\n\nMEET SARAH HEWLETT-DIPROSE, NZ CHAIR Sarah is an Architect and Associate Principal of Warren and Mahoney, an international practice of designers and architects.
