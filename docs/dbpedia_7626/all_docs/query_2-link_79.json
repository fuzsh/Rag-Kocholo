        "text": "\"All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.\" Lawrence of Arabia\n\nWay back a couple of years ago in the age of pre-pandemic optimism, Steve Munday, the C.E.O. of the South-West Essex Community Education Trust resurrected a vision of building a new school at the heart of Thurrock's \"Hub of Sport\". Having been a P.E. teacher and former Head at William Edwards School, he was cognisant of the impact of sport on young people and how it is an integral part of a fully rounded education. He began working feverishly with the Authority and management and Trustees of Thurrock R.F.C. to make this dream a reality and, when the Club appointed Dave Pavitt as its Liaison Officer, the project gained momentum.\n\nThis week Orsett Heath Academy was opened to great public acclaim. The outcome is spectacular and this magnificent new building and facility forms a suite comprising Thurrock Rugby Club, the highly popular \"Beyond Limits\" Gym and a Physiotherapy centre.\n\nExecutive Headteacher, Simon Bell and Head of Orsett Heath, Sian Rawson have been overwhelmed by the wonderful responses from the new students and parents since the school opened.\n\nSitting at the heart of Thurrock, this is a major landmark for the Authority and its impact on the area. As far back as 1858 a Royal Commission reported that:\n\n\"A set of good schools civilises a whole community.\" and there is no doubt that this new school will become a centre of educational and sporting excellence. The word \"education\" derives from the Latin \"educere\" and its literal meaning is \"To draw out of the darkness into the light.\" The enlightenment of building this school in this environment is to be applauded and great credit should also go to the Architect and builders who have completed the project on time despite the ravages of Covid and last year's storm season.\n\nRugby and education are inexorably linked. The game is named after a school, Rugby School in Warwickshire where legend has it that schoolboy, William Webb Ellis, whilst bored with kicking a ball around and never scoring a goal, picked it up and started running with it, rugby style! However, it is true to say that his role as the game's originator has been queried by a succession of eminent historians who believe the game had started some years before Webb Ellis introduced a more tactile element! These academics claim that the story first appeared some fifty years after the alleged event took place and by someone not even at Rugby School when young William set off on his famous run for glory! As further to confuse matters, Webb Ellis had passed away by the time the legend gained momentum and hence wasn't available to comment on its authenticity. Critics have even suggested that the legend was part of a deliberate deception by the school's alumni to ensure that the rules of Rugby School became the uncontested official laws of rugby.\n\nThere are those who would argue that football describes any game that involves kicking a ball. Purists use the term Rugby Football to differentiate it from Association Football (soccer) which is limited to kicking and heading the ball. Whether a myth or reality the picking up of the ball at this famous Public School, in1823, broke the old rules and set the precedent for an entirely distinct and unique game. Regardless of the time frame, the game emanates from Rugby School and began its continuing proximity to the Public School system. Of course The Webb Ellis Cup is presented to the winners of the World Cup and cements the school in history. Incidentally, on close inspection, carefully perched at the apex is a miniature round football surrounded by wreaths and very much like the ball Webb Ellis is renowned for picking up!\n\nRugby Football began to proliferate when teams from the school took the sport to other Public Schools and thereafter adopted by undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge. Arguably the World's first Rugby Club was formed at Cambridge University in 1839. Blackheath founded in 1858, claims to be the oldest club in the World and certainly one of the first England Home Internationals was played there at Rectory Fields. The first England captain, Frederick Stokes was a former student at Rugby School before playing for Blackheath. Richmond R.F.C. was formed at the same time and now it became the norm for post graduates to set up clubs near their homes or places of work. On the 26th of January 1871, representatives from 21 rugby clubs met founding The Rugby Union and forming a Governing Body which would administer the game thereafter.\n\nThurrock's proximity to the Dartford Crossing has meant that there has frequently been a playing connection with Blackheath. Although the two teams have only met at Sevens level, several eminent players have played for both clubs. One of Thurrock's greatest players, John Mahoney transferred from the Kent team in the early seventies whilst Stefan North, Joe Hardy and Marcus Burcham went in the other direction. Marcus went on to captain Blackheath and play for England Counties, while Stef has recently signed for a second spell. Another outstanding prop, Chris Shorter moved from south of the river while Jake Bedding, furthered his career at Blackheath before returning to fulfil his enormous potential at his parent club.\n\nTalking of the Sevens connection, we frequently met Blackheath at the latter stages of tournaments. In the late seventies their captain was the much lauded \"hard man\"of England fame, Micky Skinner. At the Askeans' Tournament a fine Thurrock Seven progressed to the final to meet the illustrious \"Originals\". With players like Steve Bowen and Dennis Stone in their prime, Thurrock seemed to be heading for glory until Skinner put his \"mark \" on the game by stopping \"Alice Cooper\" in his tracks! The referee said \"I can't send him off, it's a Sunday!\" and the England Flanker led his team to a hotly disputed title.\n\nFrom the outset, it appeared that Rugby was a preserve of the Middle classes with its origins in the great Public Schools and the World's most famous Universities. Fixtures were played between these elites. With the formation of the Rugby Union in 1871, it was only a matter of time before a set of laws came into existence and the first International took place. England met Scotland at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh on 27th March in the first of the World's oldest series. It wasn't long before Ireland entered the fray, closely followed by Wales and the first Championship was contested in 1883. By 1895 the R.F.U. outlawed professionalism and saw Rugby League go it's own way. Other key dates were the first World Cup won by New Zealand in 1987 and, finally in 1995 after the Mandela inspired South African metamorphosis, the game went \"Open\"!\n\nUnsurprisingly, rugby and cricket became games of Empire as the ruling classes invariably came from military backgrounds and for many years struggled to break away from this image. Furthermore, its laws became increasingly complicated, possibly driven by an intellectual superciliousness! It's close relationship to football meant it had begun as a kicking game with tries having no points value other than giving the attacking team \"a try\" at kicking a goal. It took over a hundred years until 1993 for a try to evolve from being valueless to the five points it is today. Some of us were lucky enough to play in an era when the try morphed from 3 to 5 points!(1948-1970 - 3 points, 1971-1991 - 4points & 1992-? - 5points )\n\nIt was inevitable that Rugby Union, now divorced from the Rugby League working class North, would be portrayed as a middle class and upper class sport of the educated elite of the country. When scholarships started to be awarded to working class boys they returned from the Universities to develop the game in their own communities and it was only a matter of time before the game was embraced in South Wales, Cornwall, Gloucestershire and working class areas in Ireland and Scotland. Internationally, though the elitism continued. Even though Germany had defeated France in 1934 and the U.S.A. had become Olympic champions, non Empire countries were excluded from this \"closed shop\", even France being excluded from the I.R.B. until 1978.\n\nThe all important \"Pathways\"into Senior Rugby continued to be dominated by attendance at Public Schools. After the 1944 Education Act, however, we saw the advent of modern Grammar Schools under the Tripartite system. ( Elite Grammar Schools were in existence in the 16th Century). When these were introduced in Wales they became a breeding ground for outstanding players and Wales entered a period when they would start to emerge from England's shadow. A two tier system emerged where young men in Secondary Modern schools matured through the Youth System (Colts in England) whilst the Grammar School students represented their countries at \"Secondary School\" level. There were International competitions at Under 15 level until the school leaving age was raised to 16 in 1972. Until 1995 most young players would graduate, often at Easter, into their local town teams. The Grammar School and Youth teams usually sporting the same kit as the Senior Team, thus displaying unity and loyalty from an early age.\n\nSadly one disadvantage of comprehensivisation in the sixties and seventies, led to the demise of the Grammar Schools, especially in Wales and a resurgence of the dominance of the Public Schools. This is evidenced by glancing at the Winners of the Schools' National Cup in England since its inception at Under 18 level in 1990. The competition was won on numerous occasions by schools such as Whitgift or Reigate Grammar School until a John Davies inspired Campion broke the mould by defeating Cranbrook 15-11 in 2002. Thankfully Campion, Cooper's and U.S.P. have continued to make progress over recent times with USP narrowly losing to Coleg y Cymoedd in the Quarter-Final of the British Colleges Cup at Thurrock just before the lockdown.\n\nPlayers of the highest quality have always been developed locally. Jim Evans from William Edwards went on to be Harlequins' longest serving player and an England Saxon. Tony Diprose played for England and the British Lions, Matt Garvey of Gable Hall still plays in the Premiership; Sam Stanley played for Saracens and represented England at Sevens, whilst brother Michael Stanley was outstanding as an England schoolboy International before starting for Samoa in the 2015 World Cup in England. Prior to this, Chris Fuller and Peter Worsfold were regulars for Saracens. The local schools were the breeding grounds with teachers like Dave Cheshire, Thurrock's tough centre discovering future Thurrock prodigies like Mick Leckenby, Peter Worsfold and Phil Cook at Leonard's. At Aveley, Jeff Selway, Bernie Thomas and Brian Cobb were producing quality players. Grays School, with Allan Jones, Gordon Eckley, Jeff Selway, Alex McWhinnie and Tim Rider to the fore became genuine contenders in the Thurrock Championship, with Torells developing John & Barry Magnurson, Craig White and Paul McCarthy. Clive Beynon's work at St.Chads was inestimable as the Tilbury school identified some great talent including Stefan North and Rob Batho.\n\nDown in the east of the Borough, Dave Cheshire, Keith Davies and John Power promoted the rugby at St. Cleres who produced Jake Barrand, Lewis Cross, Eddie Stevens & the Yeoman brothers, Liam & Keiran whilst Gable Hall with Phil James, John Mahoney and Karl Napieralla promoting the game at Hassenbrook with future Thurrock captain, Richard Gaches and Middlesex Sevens star, Ivan Whittall.\n\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, owing to its proximity to Thurrock's \"hub of sport\", Orsett Heath's sister school in S.W.E. C.E.T., William Edwards, has always played a major part in Thurrock's sporting fortunes having twice been English Boys'Athletics champions, All England Badminton Champions, regular Essex Cup winners and England Sevens quarter finalists; not bad for a State school. Its mantra is \"Inspirational learning with a strong sporting ethos!\" The school's relationship with Thurrock rugby is long established. The first Headteacher, Reg Saxton, had two sons who were excellent players and his successor, Wilfred Larwood was the cousin of legendary cricketer Harold Larwood of the \"Bodyline Series\". Jim McQuibban had played for Southend and Eastern Counties and Roy Van Tromp for Cooperians. Byron Davies, who sadly passed away as a victim of Covid 19 continued the trend as a centre for Brentwood. It wasn't just P.E. teachers like Mr.Zavaronni, Martin Eyles, Mercedes Foy, Georgia Cook, Emily Scott and Matt Bowden who built the legacy, but other subject specialists like Kevin Wakeford, Ian Owens, Howie Evans , Lew Hughes and a host of others who gave willingly of their time in extra-curricular activities This great work was continued by the most recent Heads, John King O.B.E., Steve Munday and Simon Bell. Thurrock's current President, Brian Howells was one of the first teachers at the school.\n\nConsequently, the number of First Team players from William Edwards as either a student or teacher is enormous. Trevor Burge, Ray Page, Steve Putz (who later went on to be an outstanding coach and D.O.R.), Graham Holbrook, Dave Stevens, Aaron Woodward, Darryl Worster and Charlie Russo (currently) have gone on to Captain the First Team, whilst Debbie Gay became the first Ladies'captain. Mercedes Foy did an amazing job resurrecting rugby during a fallow period before captaining Thurrock to promotion to the English Premiership and representing England. Current England star, Emily Scott (who just this season scored a fabulous hat-trick of tries against Scotland) is a teacher at the school. Colleague, Georgia Cook is another former captain as was Kevin Wakeford and yours truly. Many, many more have gone on to successful Thurrock careers (and please forgive me if my memory has omitted you and I will mention it in future articles) :Ian Corderoy, Clive Ballard, Austin Fitzmaurice, Andy Dickson, Sonny Gay, John Steven, Paul Stephens, Mark Goodridge, Luke and Shane Cotter, Wayne Tredwell & Glen Treadwell, Dave Stevens, John Camp, Sam Porter, Damian Burns & Blake Burns, Aaron Burns, Ian & Ceri Jones, Lee Herrington, Brad Retigan, Grant & Luke Greatrex, David Martindale, Ben Timson, Andrew Nimmo, Reece Miller, Rees Collins, Reece Cunningham, James Flavin, Alex Hardy, Ben Northfield, Bob Prewer, Freddie Russo, Charlie Currie, Ryan Wilkins, Matt Lincoln, Matt Bowden, Bill Ramsey, Martin Eyles, Joe Bezuidenhout, Nat Farrell, Damian Roff, Rob and Grant Scott as well as the Stanley brothers - Ben, Mike & Sam and the Kidd brothers - Reece, Fraser & Blaine. Not forgetting the inimitable Kevin Hymas who went on to become Thurrock's longest serving Team Manager!\n\nOf course, that patron of all Thurrock rugby, Paul Smith was a former pupil. He learned his rugby at the school and twenty years later constructed the biggest set of Rugby posts outside Twickenham on his school pitch. More latterly, he has been instrumental in setting the new posts up at Palmer's and providing lights for Thames and a variety of Thurrock clubs.\n\nThe role of the Secondary teacher was made infinitely easier by the brilliant work of the Primary schools, presided over by Bob Williams. Known as Arthur after his hero, Wales centre, Arthur Lewis, an army of Primary teachers paved the way in upskilling generations of young players. Nearly all the Primary Heads and Deputies had played for Thurrock at some stage. There was Sam David and Norman Brown at Quarry Hill, Graham Morris and Ray Davies who taught Jim Evans, Chris Cohen and Joss Nunn at Woodside and Brian Moore who developed a young Tony Diprose at St.Thomas's. Keith Richards was a Head at two Primary Schools with assistant groundsman, Roger White, being another who played the odd game of rugby before seeing his son, Neil play for the Firsts! The Primary Schools Cup was the highlight of the season and was keenly contested by an array of excellent schools which benefited from the culture of rugby. John Brown, Colin Gaut, Brian Davies, Dai Davies, Gareth Evans, Paul Saunders, Bob Saunders, Lyn James, Phil Newell, John Poskett and many more inspirational teachers made Thurrock the envy of the country during a \"golden era\" for Thurrock.\n\nWith every school having staff who played for Thurrock, there was an ever flowing pipeline of gifted players who were learning their trade not just through the schools but also through the Mini and Junior sections of the Club and, naturally through to the Colts and Senior Teams. Having their teachers as role models and mentors provided the perfect foundation for success and all seemed set fair for the future. Unfortunately, a series of strikes, retirements, promotions and changing economic circumstances combined to erode much of the momentum which had been built so painstakingly over the years. This was apparent throughout the country and allowed, in my opinion, the Public Schools to return to their previous exalted position in England. All the Senior Clubs in England have connections with Public Schools and Universities. You have only to travel to Felsted to watch a B.U.C.S. match and you will find a couple of television gantries and coaches from Northampton, Saracens and Harlequins in attendance. The best players will be snapped up by their academies. Max Malins was identified early on and signed by Saracens, now on loan to Bristol.\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to break into the English system! Ten years or so ago I read on England's web site that \"Sons of England greats Andy Farrell and Mike Ford would play for England!\" It was necessary to bring it to the attention of the selectors that Sam Stanley was the nephew of legendary All Black, Joe Stanley!\n\nRugby, like all great sports, is far more than the sum of its parts. Out of the game we have seen the emergence of structures, laws, loyalties, core values and heroes who have become role models. These values such as respect, unity, honesty and integrity have enabled players, officials and supporters to develop a culture. In a way, not incongruous with its Public School origins rugby became almost the antithesis of Association Football. Although it had spread to Wales via the Oxbridge connection, in the Principality it soon became a game for all shapes, sizes and every sector of society. As a young student I can recall turning up for a midweek game against Llanelli and as the players arrived it was plain to see that we represented all \"walks of life\"! There were the coal-miners, still black from their shift; the dustman arrived in his\"cor blimey\" trousers and his dustman's hat, whereas the lawyers and teachers were \"suited and booted\"! Rugby's complexity, its ever changing laws and widespread appeal began to define the sport. Its popularity became endemic as it capitalised on its reputation of Corinthian ethics, unselfish teamwork, ultimate respect for the referee and a post match camaraderie unique in sport.\n\n\"Fellowship is life\" wrote William Morris and nowhere was this more evident than on the rugby pitch. That fellowship and sublimation of individual stardom in favour of the team ethic has always been cherished throughout sport and indeed the corporate sector. In Wales and the North of England, captains of industry like the Crawshay Baileys saw the benefits of adapting this template to their own modus operandi.\n\nIn general there is much to be gained from being associated with the rugby \"brand\" and little wonder that companies such as Aviva, R.B.S. or Allianz have queued up to be involved. The game has always provided a network providing job opportunities or, simply, a life-long friendship with team-mates or opponents such as Bill Adams or Charlie Dunsford! Rugby has much to commend it. It has rapidly become fully inclusive, has taken a leading role in embracing LGBT communities and has massively supported the Women's game. Wheelchair rugby is an Olympic sport. Little wonder that it is so popular amongst educators!\n\nRugby Union has reached a watershed and the culture has evolved. Even in Wales, parents from Llanelli, Pontyberem or Abertillery are as likely as most to buy replica soccer shirts for their children, in the same way that they are ready to subscribe to B.T., Sky, or now, Amazon in order to watch the best of their own sport being played in England or the southern hemisphere. Buying Manchester United or Aston Villa shirts, especially the away kit as well, testifies to an age of commercial exploitation through which manufacturers, teams and the media control sporting loyalties. This is nothing new. But the Pandemic has taught us that something is missing. What has gone is the immediacy of a culture where genius was associated not only with the Stoop or all the great international arenas such as Cardiff Arms Park (The Principality), Twickenham, Eden Park or Ellis Park, but also at Oakfield, on the field at the back of the house or even under the street lights, where Wales played England every night before homework! For all the promptings from commentators and artificial crowd noises, there is no substitute for the sheer pleasure of being part of an audience of friends and former team-mates sharing an inflated memory of bygone games! As has been demonstrated in New Zealand, we must seize the opportunity post Covid! On several trips to New Zealand over the last decade, I had been alarmed by the fact that Rugby Clubs were suffering from low attendances as the younger generation watched their sport on \"Big Screens\" at Barbecues! But, \"Out of the darkness came forth light \" as the crowds have returned tenfold to watch the thrilling encounters of the past few months. We must attempt to emulate this \"match day experience\" play high-octane entertaining rugby and we can return to a bright future. We all have our heroes and superstars and they remind us of those idols we spotted making tackles or side-stepping on unenclosed fields of makeshift pitches or even on more formal pitches which would not have been unfamiliar to Webb Ellis, Tom Brown or even Flashman! We all love the fact that we watched Mike Stanley dismantle Old Elthamians at Oakfield and knew that he had the potential to play in a World Cup, which he did just 2 years after wearing the Black & White. Similarly we were filled with pride as Emily Scott lacerated defences with her magical running before becoming an Olympian and enjoying a stellar England career. We take pleasure in our national teams because we have appreciated flair and ability at a more humble level. We must not underestimate the importance of our schools.\"Teachers affect eternity\" and, for most our Alma mater, like the family was a bedrock of our lives. Were there ever faster, more creative backs than those cheeky, effervescent heroes of ours who would share a word with us even though they were prefects? And as they graduated from the First Team and Seniors to Internationals we still expected the same qualities of immediacy and familiarity. Our first visit to the Arms Park or Twickenham often came about because one of our schoolmates had been selected for their country. (I was even luckier, travelling to Bourgoin in France when Sam Stanley was first selected for England!)\n\n\"Education is the passport for the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.\" - Malcolm X\n\nWhen Eddie Jones took the England job, he said that it was the best job in Rugby because England had the most players, were the richest Union and had the best infrastructure. A massive part of that infrastructure providing player pathways are the Public Schools and Academies. England has 2,408 Independent schools, Wales has 28! Although St.David's, Lampeter was the first to play rugby, it has probably been superseded by Llandovery College and Monmouth. The Llandovery alumni include Ian Lewis and some of Wales's greatest players via George North and Alun Wyn Jones. Monmouth School's coach is legendary Wales, Lions and Cardiff College winger, John Bevan. Former students include former Wales captain and television commentator, Eddie Butler as well as the brilliant schoolboy hero, Keith Jarrett.\n\nIn recent years (although Gareth Edwards went to Millfield and was English 400metres hurdles champion) several outstanding schoolboy players have been lured across the Severn on scholarships to places like Hartpury. The classic examples were Billy and Mako Vunipola, who like their cousin, Taulupe Faletau, were taught rugby by Dawson Jones in Pontypool! Billy was given a scholarship to Harrow and Mako went to Millfield before choosing to play for England. This is not intended to be controversial as many players have dual qualifications or even more (Wales, England or Tonga?) Wales have benefited from selecting former Hartpury students such as Ross Moriarty and Nick Tompkins. Incidentally, Thurrock's longest serving captain, Reece Durrance was at Hartpury. This merely serves to demonstrate how the English game is so well served by the Independent schools. While Karl Napieralla was developing Ivan Whittall at Hassenbrook and trying to further his career, Sedbergh were promoting future England captain, Will Carling and Rory Underwood! Although it must be said that Martin Eyles did remarkably well to secure William Edwards' David Martindale as understudy to Charlie Hodgson in the England Under 16s team. Eyles was a very talented player and coach who took William Edwards to the highest levels in Rugby and Athletics.\n\n\"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too can become great.\"\n\nAt Thurrock, we are ambitious once again. The new Rugby Academy at U.S.P. 's Palmer's Campus looks like Rugby School and, with its long and illustrious history, is ready to once again, play a major role in Thurrock's future as it provides continuity for our 16-18 year olds. With many of those students having been fostered through Thurrock's Primary and Secondary Schools and tutored through Ken Laybourn's coaches at Mini and Junior level, Martin Jones the Thurrock D.O.R. will have a set-up second to none. At the epicentre is the new school, Orsett Heath Academy. All major clubs have strong affiliations with its local schools and some are in close proximity like Bishops Stortford College which is about 100 metres or so from the National One team, but I can't think of any club which has had a school built alongside the pitch! And what a delight to look out of the window on a Wednesday afternoon and watch youngsters picking up the ball and \"running with it\", echoes of 1823 !\n\nThere is no doubt that this has been one of the most memorable events at Oakfield since its opening in 1979 and is sure to leave a lasting legacy for many years to come. I will leave you with the words of the man who was bold enough to \"dream during the day\" Mr.Steve Munday :\n\n\"We are delighted that Orsett Heath Academy opened on time with a full complement of Year7 pupils. This wouldn't have been foreseeable without the support of the whole community. The pupils and the staff have had a great first week.\n\nA special thank you to everyone at Thurrock Rugby Club who helped make this ambitious partnership project a reality.\n\nThere are truly exciting times ahead! \"\n\nN.B. Please note that these are my own personal thoughts and merely intended to keep Rugby in profile during such difficult times."
