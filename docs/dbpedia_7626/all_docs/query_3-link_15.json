        "text": "It was a job that was too big to turn down and it is a shame that things didn’t work out. Throughout my 30 years in the senior game, I have always loved the intricacies and the strategies required to succeed. Against the odds suited me fine, I was never the most athletically gifted and I had to deal with significant health issues to play but I loved that adversity. To become a lineout expert as a player, or as Keith Wood used to call me, a ‘lineout naws’, was my Everest. It was where I knew I could excel. After playing , this work translated into coaching and my obsession became a trade that I truly loved. After finishing as head coach of Newcastle Falcons, I am ready to go back to that first love, lineouts and to help a new team benefit from this obsession.\n\nIt was a privilege to be in Paris last night for the ‘Nuit de Rugby’ awards. It was an amazing evening and I am honoured to be part of the team that won Coaching Staff of the year’ for ProD2 with Joe, Fabien and Vincent. It was great to see those guys again and brought back wonderful memories of my time there, that I will treasure forever#Oyoman"
