        "text": "Dana was first introduced to Holistic Management in the 1990s while working in the Texas Hill Country. She strongly believes that Holistic Management can positively impact families that are on the land, the communities they are a part of, and larger landscape resource regeneration efforts.\n\nWith 7+ generations of farmers and ranchers on both sides of her family, Dana appreciates the joys of living with the land, while understanding those complexities can be challenging.\n\nHaving spent time in Texas, Colorado, and Wyoming, Dana currently lives in Tishomingo, Oklahoma where she and her family run a small cow/calf operation with horses and pecans. Her husband, Marc, comes from a Colorado/Wyoming ranching background. In fact, they met and married when he was managing one of the last large ranches in Jackson Hole. Their son, Rio, has carried on the tradition with a strong career in FFA and ranching. He now conducts agriculture and natural resource research as part of his studies in Biosystems and Agriculture Engineering at Oklahoma State University.\n\nDana feels blessed that her time growing up on the family outfit connected her with deep roots to the land. Her father, Joe, led the family in seasonal harvests based on his traditional ecological knowledge and native ways of knowing all aspects of nature.\n\n“Anyone who spent time with my Dad experienced his stories and the passion he had for hard work and being outdoors,” Dana said. “Whether it was working cattle, harvesting pecans, or fishing, he made it an adventure that you never forgot. We all owe so much to him and the legacy he created.”\n\nTaking his lessons to heart, Dana has worked for conservation organizations on the local and national level and with the Teton Conservation District in Jackson, Wyoming where she provided education and collaboration activities for landowners and nature-lovers. She has over 35 years of experience developing programs and writing grants.\n\n“From bees, to quail, to fish, to people, my Dad taught me that good stewardship is key to a healthy, happy life for all,” Dana states. “I look forward to working with others who are striving to realize that holistic balance ~ with health and revitalization for the land, water, nature, families, and community.”\n\n“HMI’s Certified Educator Training Program has had a huge impact on many aspects of my life including helping me survive some major family and business crises. It has helped me learn Holistic Management at a far deeper level than I had known before, but it also brought me contact with and support from a whole community of like-minded people who continue to shape and support my learning path—an outcome that is priceless. Being a Certified Educator has also enabled me to help the many good farmers and ranchers I worked with to realize that they have the power and the means to heal degraded land and to work together more effectively as families and make their businesses thrive.”\n\nWayne Knight, Interim Executive Director HMI, Consultant, and Rancher\n\nTexas, USA\n\n“The Certified Educator Training Program was a great educational step for me. At the time I was considering some major changes in my career, but didn’t know what it would look like. The program not only gave me the tools I needed to make that decision, but also gave me the training I needed to go in a number of different directions, teaching, consulting, ranching, facilitating, etc. Another key benefit of the program was the mentorship from existing Certified Educators and networking with new/potential Certified Educators as well as the experience to travel and teach in a variety of environments. The program also helped me build confidence, and provided a platform to help people, gain a much deeper understanding of the land and its function, and gain additional friends and mentors that have helped immensely with our own ranch management and consulting/teaching/facilitation business. It gave me opportunities to be thrown into the fire, but with a safety net. I felt more prepared to do the things a Certified Educator needs to be able to do (communicate, facilitate, teach, speak, etc.) because the program actually had me do those things firsthand.“\n\nJoshua Dukart, Seek First Ranch and Consultant\n\nNorth Dakota, USA\n\n“I have discovered hidden talents and abilities I never knew before. The Savory Center’s [HMI’s] Certified Educator Training Program covered its costs for me in the first year I was certified. It’s the best investment I have ever made in my life!”\n\nDick Richardson, Consultant at Grazing Naturally and Nature’s Equity\n\nMount Pleasant, Australia\n\n“Everyone I talk to who practices Holistic Management sees it as a life-changing experience. I feel that this is true on their farms, but also in their lives and families. It has been a life-changing experience for me. HMI’s Whole Farm/Ranch Trainer training has been wonderful, and I’ve met so many great people, being a part of this.”\n\nAshley Pierce, Cornell Cooperative Extension Albany County\n\nNew York, USA\n\n“HMI’s Certified Educator Training Program totally changed the way I interacted with farmers. The first question I ask now is ‘What are your goals?’ And then I listen. In the past, I would have given information. Now I ask good questions. Holistic Management has given me so much and I’m so grateful. That’s why I train others. Others have given me encouragement and it feels good to be an instructor and leader in the Holistic Management community, particularly as a woman.”\n\nElizabeth Marks, USDA-NRCS Biologist\n\nNew York, USA\n\n“I liked the way the program is structured. The learning plan puts the Certified Educator trainee in the driver’s seat. I had to work through all the modules while facilitating and teaching each one of them. This structure guaranteed the high quality of the program. The monthly webinar and mentor meetings gave the minimum support needed to get through challenges and stay motivated while providing me with a great social network to stay in touch with. Especially I liked how on point the Education Director answered any question that was ask from her. Was it in the webinars, via mail or ZOOM call, she was always ready to offer a helping hand. Thanks to HMI for the opportunity to be part of such a great organization!”\n\nPhilipp Mayer, Farmer and Consultant\n\nPirkanmaa, Finland\n\n“Twenty years ago I enrolled in HMI’s Certified Educator Training Program two-year program. I was fully aware of the cost and commitment from the outset and made the decision to enroll only when I knew I had the time and financial resources to complete the program. With almost every activity in life– you take as much benefit or gain commensurate with the amount of effort put in. I consider that the first holistic financial plan I prepared was responsible for recouping the financial ‘cost’ of the Certified Educator Training Program. In terms of added value, the lessons from the program have had far more than simply financial ‘value’ on all aspects of my personal and professional career.”\n\nJudi Earl, Consultant\n\nCoolatai, Australia\n\n“The Holistic Management training ended up having a profound effect on my job and how I approached it. I better understood what motivates people to do conservation. Since then I’ve always tried to be a service provider leading with Holistic Management. The training improved my ability to communicate with landowners in determining how best to help them. It also helped me become more valuable to my own and other organizations in planning and implementing programs. I learned how to take off my so- called “expert” hat and instead was better able to facilitate discussions with farmers on how they wanted their lives to be and how they could more effectively move toward that. One impact I didn’t anticipate was how the training changed my personal life, and how it improved our family’s decision making, including finances. The network of other trainees and Certified Educators had a huge benefit. They helped me process a lot of information, much of it new and some of it forcing paradigm shifts to be able to see a more effective way of assisting farms and organizations.”\n\nPhil Metzger, Retired USDA – NRCS Conservationist\n\nNew York, USA\n\n“My husband and I searched for land that would allow for a return to our roots in agriculture and for us to retire to the country. We wanted to restore the land and bring back the native grasses using holistic practices. In searching for answers on how to begin we stumbled on Holistic Management. The holistic approach resonated deeply with me as I had spent the past 20 years as a Montessori teacher. I applied to the HMI Texas Beginning Women Farmers and Ranchers Program and began implementing Holistic Management. We saw success not only on our land where we saw the building of soil and increase in ground cover and diversity, but we also learned to balance the working of the land with relaxation in our personal lives. I decided to apply to the Certified Educator Training Program in 2013 because it would increase my knowledge of Holistic Management, allow me to share my experiences with others who were seeking ways to restore their land, and help facilitate their journey into sustainable land management. Upon completion of the Certified Educator Training Program I have had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of Holistic Management through practicing, working with other ranchers on different landscapes, mentoring others as they work towards certification and it’s given opportunities for sharing and brainstorming with other educators regarding challenges seen in environments and training. The continuing education that the Certified Educator Training Program offers allowed for me to gain skills that increased my effectiveness as an educator, learning techniques in effective listening and consensus building, not only in my personal life but also assisting others in conflict resolution. I am both honored and grateful to be a part of this program. “\n\nTracy Litle, Owner Faith Hollow Farm\n\nTexas, USA\n\nJonathan Cobb\n\nTexas\n\nJonathan is a fourth-generation farmer in the Blackland Prairie near Rogers, TX. He went off to “a better future away from the farm” as the prevailing culture had taught him, where he earned a degree in business. The best part of college to Jonathan was meeting his wife, Kaylyn, with whom he moved to Fort Worth to begin their respective careers in business. However, several years later, the instinct to farm was stronger in his blood than he realized. The two decided in 2007 to move back to the family farm where Jonathan would work with his father until a future transition of ownership could occur.\n\nThe family farm had taken the shape of most in the industrial era. It had become an efficient machine, void of diversity, and at-risk to many forces beyond the reach of the family. In addition to growing unrest and disconnect between their farming methods and their belief that God created the earth for them to steward well, the combination of increasing input costs, low product prices, and increasingly extreme weather-related crop failures had taken the shine off the dreams to continue the family farm. Despite the difficultly of the realization that the family farm would end with his father, Jonathan made the decision to leave the farm in mid-2011.\n\nIt was a last-minute decision to attend a meeting about soil health that changed the trajectory of Jonathan’s life and would lead to an introduction to many of the leading practitioners of regenerative farming. The common thread among the leaders Jonathan met was Holistic Management.\n\nThe decision to stay on the farm and learn to manage it holistically was made in late 2011. Since then, Jonathan and his family have been on an amazing journey of learning and discovery. The farm is now home to Jonathan’s parents, his sister’s family, Kaylyn’s parents along with Kaylyn and Jonathan. The family manages multiple enterprises of grass-finished beef, a cow/calf herd, grass-finished lamb, breeding ewes, pastured pork, and pastured eggs.\n\nJonathan also works as a soil health consultant and works with Green Cover Seed as a cover crop consultant for Texas and the southeastern U.S. He currently serves on the board of directors for The Grassfed Exchange.\n\n“HMI played a very important role in the direction of my life personally and also our family farm. Because of the gratitude I have for the organization’s role in our lives and the global impact HMI has and has the potential to have in the future, I felt a deep sense of honor and duty to accept the invitation to serve HMI as a member of the Board of Directors,” says Jonathan."
