        "text": "TOP BLOKE: Anthony 'Dipper' Diprose was a great businessman and a passionate community and family man. He sadly passed away on September 10, 2017, aged 47.\n\nAnthony James Diprose, otherwise known as ‘Dipper’, of “Araluen”, Pallamallawa sadly passed away on September 10, aged 47.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nAnthony was born in Tasmania on February 1, 1970 to Keith and Meryl Diprose, as the eldest of three boys.\n\nHe grew up on a 20,000 acre mixed sheep and cattle property in Avoca, Tasmania before winning a scholarship to attend Launceston Church Grammar School, where he thrived, eventually becoming school prefect.\n\nHe was then awarded a bursary to study a Bachelor of Business – Property at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. He worked part-time with a valuation firm during the course, spending most of his free time with his beloved maternal grandparents George and Elva. Over this time he developed a close bond with George.\n\nAfter finishing university, Dipper realised valuation wasn’t what he wanted to do, and instead he landed his first full-time job in a real estate and stock and station agent role with Alex Scott and Co in Dandenong before transferring to Yea in 1992 to take over his grandfather’s position with the company.\n\nIn 1993, he moved on to become a livestock auctioneer with Wesfarmers Dalgety in Geelong – the beginning of what was to become a 13-year stint with Wesfarmers Dalgety, which later became Landmark.\n\nDipper transferred with Wesfarmers to Wagga Wagga in 1997 before becoming livestock manager in 1999.\n\nHe then got a transfer to Dubbo as the NSW State Livestock Manager for the central region.\n\nIt was here that Dipper met his match and the love of his life, Rebecca Moore, in 2001.\n\nAfter six months of chasing, Bec finally came to her senses and the pair got together, only about four or five months before Dipper told her he’d decided to take a transfer to Moree.\n\nDespite Bec’s best efforts to convince Dipper that Dubbo was a far better option than Moree, Dipper moved in May 2002 as branch manager for Landmark.\n\nFor the next two years, Dipper and Bec continued their relationship long-distance, spending only two weekends apart in that time.\n\nIn early 2004, Bec got a transfer with Monsanto and moved to Moree, in the same year that Dipper took on the role of branch manager for Mungindi, as well as Moree.\n\nIn October that year, the pair were engaged in Hawaii before marrying in Brisbane in April 2005.\n\nDuring their six-month engagement, Dipper and Bec were in the middle of major renovations on their house in Edward Street which they bought just after Bec moved to Moree.\n\nIn April 2006, Dipper and Bec bought “Araluen”, a small dryland broadacre property just outside of Pallamallawa, and have since expanded with the purchase of a neighbouring property.\n\nAgriculture was Dipper’s true love, and with the purchase of “Araluen”, he was able to pursue farming in the background for the past 11 years. In about 2012 he engaged in a header contracting business – his way of connecting to the land for a two to three-month “sabbatical” when he wasn’t in a position to farm wholely and solely.\n\nDuring his time with Landmark, and despite coming to a huge cotton and cropping area from a livestock background, Dipper doubled Landmark’s sales figures and turned around the business.\n\nWith a smart mind for business, dubbed “the human calculator”, and his hunger for a sale and strong customer service approach, Dipper excelled at each new challenge which came his way.\n\nIn July 2006, a new challenge came knocking and Dipper took on the role of branch manager at Chesterfield Moree, despite not knowing a thing about machinery.\n\nHis keenness to learn saw Dipper spend as much time as he could on tractors and machinery, taking on board all he could in an effort to succeed at Chesterfield.\n\nHe also became known as “the shed-builder”. Dipper played a significant role in designing the new building at Landmark before he left and then he tried his hand at shed-building again as project manager for Chesterfield’s new build.\n\nAfter growing the Chesterfield business, Dipper then moved on to farm management with CFM in June 2010, where he would spend the next two years learning about budgeting.\n\nIn January 2010, Dipper and Bec were blessed with their first child, George, who arrived four days before Dipper’s 40th birthday.\n\nFollowing a ski trip to Falls Creek a few months after George’s birth, Bec fell pregnant again and Amelia (Millie) was born in April 2011.\n\nIn November 2012, Dipper and Bec jumped at the opportunity to purchase their own business – Dipper’s Home Timber and Hardware.\n\nDipper provided the commentary during the Moree on a Plate Blokes on the BBQ challenge this year.\n\nWhile hardware wasn’t exactly Dipper’s passion, he and Bec could see huge potential within the business.\n\nThis potential has since been realised, with Dipper and Bec exponentially growing the earnings of the store in the first two years. In 2014 it was named Home Timber and Hardware National Store of the Year – a pivotal moment in Dipper’s successful career.\n\nOn the day of the official opening of Dipper’s Home Timber and Hardware on November 1, 2012, Bec underwent emergency surgery after a case of missed appendicis was discovered. Following a second surgery to remove the infection, Bec was told it was unlikely she’d be able to have another baby. However, Isabelle Grace had other ideas, arriving in December 2013.\n\nSince arriving in Moree, both Dipper and Bec became heavily involved in the community, joining the Moree Picnic Race Club in 2004 before joining Moree Race Club in 2007, of which Dipper was president for a number of years.\n\nIt was during his first years in Moree that Dipper’s love of golf developed and on the golf course that he made many lifelong friends of all ages. Every Thursday afternoon he and a group of friends, known as the Desperates Golfers, would get together for a game.\n\nHis friendship with Lee Estens led to Dipper’s involvement with the Variety the Children’s Charity Golf Day. As the auctioneer, Dipper became the face of the annual Golf Day and significantly contributed to helping raise more than $1 million for the charity over the years.\n\nDipper had been in Lee Esten's Variety Golf Day since the beginning.\n\nAs well as the Variety Golf Day, Dipper would often lend his time as MC or auctioneer to various other charity and community events, and was known for always getting that last little bit out of buyers.\n\nHaving auctioneered throughout his life, Dipper’s sharp mind and quick-wit could bring life to any auction, whether it was a serious stock or clearing sale auction or a light-hearted charity auction.\n\nDipper was a sharp-minded business man, a quick-witted, funny community man, the face of Dipper’s Home Timber and Hardware, and a dreamer but most of all, he was a committed family man who loved his wife and children.\n\nIn 2017, the Diproses bought the Pally Pub with a group of friends and fellow farmers, and it was here that Dipper was fittingly farewelled by 450 of his close friends and family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest Moree news in your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\n\nEmail address\n\nWe care about the protection of your data.
