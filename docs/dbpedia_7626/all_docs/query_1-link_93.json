        "text": "At Campion School there is an agreed dress code. This was drawn up by students, staff, parents and governors. The code covers not only uniform, but also the wearing of jewellery, make-up and outdoor clothing. The purpose of the dress code is to allow students to arrive at school dressed safely and to feel secure in their appearance and therefore able to concentrate on achieving their maximum potential in all their lessons. We believe that the dress code is sensible and relatively inexpensive and, therefore, we consider that all students from Year 7 to Year 11 must arrive at school suitably dressed; we are sure that parents will support us on this. Any unreasonable excesses of appearance may lead to a student being temporarily removed from a lesson or possibly being sent home until the situation is resolved. Tutors are asked to check standards of dress regularly.\n\nSchool Uniform\n\nThe school’s uniform supplier is:\n\nStitch-Tech Ltd: 7c Jenton Road, Sydenham, Leamington Spa CV31 1XS, Tel: 01926 883366\n\nAny pupil wearing a turban or hijab will need to ensure that it is black and not any other colour.\n\nStandard Uniform (Boys and Girls)\n\nRoyal blue blazer\n\nHouse tie\n\nLong or short-sleeved white shirt (tucked in)\n\nBlack trousers with a plain black belt (no jeans or trousers of a very slim fit or other unusual fit) or black skirt with a plain black belt (if necessary) or black short trousers (in summer)\n\nPlain black, V-neck jumper, or a hip-length, V-neck cardigan (cardigan should sit on the hips – long cardigans will be NOT be allowed) to wear in cold weather, to be worn with the blazer\n\nSensible outdoor coat in a sombre colour (not denim) that does not carry any unacceptable logos.\n\nBlack shoes (not trainers or boots) with low heels, suitable for all weathers and for walking around school, including up and down flights of stairs\n\nHoodies are not acceptable as school coats\n\nPE Uniform\n\nAll students are expected to wear the correct PE kit – pupils are expected to take responsibility by arriving for PE lessons with the correct equipment. As some pupils have more than one PE lesson in a week it is suggested that students have more than one Campion polo shirt, so that their kit is not in the wash when they have a lesson.\n\nThe compulsory uniform is\n\nblue & orange sports top\n\nmatching blue & orange shorts or skort\n\nroyal blue sports socks\n\nshin pads\n\ntrainers\n\nfootball boots\n\nblack top with the school logo\n\nplain black tracksuit bottom worn over the shorts or skort\n\nrugby top\n\nblack PE leggings (can be worn under the skort)\n\nPlain black means that there is no large logo printed on it.\n\nFleece can be any suitable material for a tracksuit.\n\nPupils can have their surnames printed in white on the back of the sports top, and/or rugby top and/or back top. Only their official surname will be allowed. No nicknames or first names.\n\nEquipment\n\nAll students should have a pencil case containing the following:\n\nTwo black/blue biros\n\nTwo pencils\n\nOne pencil eraser\n\nOne, 6” ruler\n\n2 pencil sharpeners\n\nAll pupils should have an appropriate backpack to store equipment – handbags are not acceptable.\n\nUniform Marking and Lost Property\n\nPlease make sure that each item of school uniform and equipment is marked clearly with your child’s name so that it can be returned if lost. All lost property is kept at Reception and, each term, pupils are invited to claim any unwanted items – at the end of term remaining items are disposed of.\n\nMake-Up, Jewellery and Hair Styling\n\nOnly minimal appropriate make-up and clear nail varnish is acceptable. Students will be asked to remove anything considered unsuitable.\n\nThe school also has guidelines about the wearing of jewellery. Students are only allowed to wear earrings, one small stud per ear. Bracelets, necklaces, rings, nose studs and other piercings are not permitted. Religious exceptions should be discussed with the Headteacher. Any inappropriate jewellery worn will be confiscated and put in the school safe.\n\nAll students are expected to remove outdoor clothes such as coats and scarves when entering classrooms and the refectory. Hats, including baseball caps, should not be worn inside the school building. Hoods are never to be worn when on the school site.\n\nExtreme haircuts and styles are not allowed. No pupil is allowed to have very short hair, tram lines cut into their hair or unnatural hair colouring(s). All pupils with long hair are strongly advised to have it contained neatly for safety reasons when necessary.\n\nWe encourage all of our students to take pride in their dress and appearance. We also encourage you to take responsibility for your own appearance and uphold the policy as detailed below.\n\nPost 16 Dress Code\n\nWithin the sixth form you are required to dress modestly in clothing of your choice. If your dress or footwear is seen as inappropriate you will be told and expected not to be seen in it again at sixth form. Furthermore, you may be sent home to change and come back in more appropriate and sensible dress or footwear.\n\nIf you have any queries, please contact the school to arrange an appointment to talk to one of the Senior Leadership Team."
