        "text": "In a tight game Campion's pace and power plus their balance between backs and forwards finally overcame a resilient Durham side in the second half, most of which was played in the northern side's half.\n\nIt's the first time the Essex school have won the title or featured in the final having reached the semi-finals on no less than five occasions.\n\n\"You couldn't wish for a better bunch of lads to win it,\" said coach Chris Jones immediately afterwards. \"They've had it as a target, the schools had it as a target probably before these guys came on the stage, they've worked tremendously hard and I'm so proud of them.\"\n\nMuch of the game was played at break neck speed with Campion making a super start and going 5-0 in front after five minutes when No 8 John-Paul Filler and flanker and captain James Griffiths set up hooker Dan Vincent from the back of a scrum to score in the corner.\n\nThat was how it stayed until the opening minute of the second half when centre Andrew McDarby, right-wing David Hiles and flanker John Ruxton all had a hand in a move that ended with centre John Hobden sending wing Adrian Lunan in for a try that fly-half Michael Whitehead converted.\n\nDurham hit back with a breakaway superbly defended by the Campion rear-guard and in particular full-back Mark Vincent's try saving tackle and from then on it was all Campion until the final whistle.\n\nThey eventually stretched their lead on 50 minutes with a Whitehead drop-goal and it was Whitehead who wrapped up the scoring with a 63rd minute penalty in front of the posts.\n\nThe Campion School squad was: Mark Vincent, David Hiles, Andrew McDarby, John Hobden, Adrian Lunan, Michael Whitehead, Chris Brickell, David Jackson, Dan Vincent, Kaz Tatham, Barry Fitzgerald, Phil Crawley, John Ruxton, James Griffiths, John-Paul Filler. Replacements; John Baker, Rees Issland, Angus McNabb, James Roberts, Pat Creeley, Ian Rudgeley, and Barry Watkins.\n\nFinal Winners: The Campion School, Hornchurch under 18s rugby squad who beat Durham School in the final of the Daily Mail Schools Cup competition at Twickenham on Saturday.\n\nConverted for the new archive on 19 November 2001.
