        "text": "Of the 132 A-level pupils at The Campion School, in Wingletye Lane, an impressive 84 per cent achieved A* to C grades, the third best results ever for the science academy.\n\nMaths, English and economics appeared to be the standout subjects for the “fantastic” group of teenagers.\n\nAssistant headteacher, Peter Luck, said: “This year group did exceptionally poorly in their AS levels, but they have managed to turn it around this year to help us achieve our third best results ever. They really exceeded their targets and have done brilliantly.\n\n“Roughly 105 of our students are going straight onto university and luckily we didn’t have too many going through the clearing process.”\n\nHeadteacher, Keith Williams, added: “I am really pleased to find that most students have got into their first choice universities, after working very hard. The year group has developed well and have been fantastic to teach.”"
