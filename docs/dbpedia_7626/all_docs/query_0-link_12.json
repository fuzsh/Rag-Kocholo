        "text": "History\n\nThe Campion School was founded in September 1962 by the Society of Jesus as a grammar school for Roman Catholic boys from the ages of 11 to 18. In 1965, the school was handed on to the Diocese of Brentwood. On opening, some of the original second and third year intake were transferred from St Ignatius' College, then located at Stamford Hill. For the first couple of years, Jesuit teachers were in the majority. The Jesuit community lived on the school site in rooms with full facilities in The Community House, which later became the first of three Sixth Form Blocks. Later, only a single, non-residential, Jesuit chaplain was retained as a link to the order. Pupils who attend the school are mainly Catholic and the school has a Catholic ethos. The first girls to attend Campion came from Ilford Ursuline School for specific sixth form classes such as Russian and Greek at the school around 1970. However, they were a rarity. The school has an attached Sixth Form which admits a number of girls. The pupils that attend the Sixth Form do not have to be Catholic but have to respect the Catholic ethos that the school represents.\n\nThe school received an Ofsted report in May 2012. The inspection judgements were rated as 2 (good) in all five categories. The school was awarded Specialist Science College status before converting to an academy in August 2011. however the school continues to offer science as a specialism.\n\nForms\n\nOriginally around 660 all boys, the school had three forms named after Father Fox and Saints John Fisher and Thomas More.\n\nEach boy also belonged to a \"House\" named Gerard (after Father John Gerard, S.J.), Southwell and Garnet, denoted by a green, blue or red ribbon strip sewn the length of the top of the blazer pocket edge. The Houses met regularly, had a \"House Master\" and competed especially in sports. For a year or two school blazers even had a different crests for Fourth, Fifth and Sixth forms too.\n\nThe school currently has five forms:\n\nFisher\n\nMore\n\nFox\n\nGarnet\n\nSouthwell\n\nAll of these forms, except Fox, are named after Catholic saints who were martyred. Fox is named after the school's first headmaster Fr. Michael Fox SJ.\n\nSport\n\nThe school has an outstanding sporting reputation both locally in Havering and nationally with the pinnacle being its strong rugby tradition. The 1st XV won the Daily Mail Cup, the premier school rugby competition in the country in 2001. In doing so they became the first comprehensive school to win the competition.\n\nHeadmasters\n\nFr Michael Fox, S.J. (1 March-27 October 1962)\n\nFr William Webb, S.J.
