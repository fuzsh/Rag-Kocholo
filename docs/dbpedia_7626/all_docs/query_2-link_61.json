        "text": "Canford School company description\n\nCanford is among the top co-educational UK boarding schools for pupils aged 13-18. It is nationally recognised for its high quality education, and is also regarded as among the best independent schools in Dorset and in the south of England. It ranks No.1 for A Level results in Sunday Times Parent Power, and was Tatler School of the Year and Boarding School of the Year (ISP) in past 5 years. Set on a 250 acre campus just outside Wimborne, it offers an inspirational educational setting with a vision for all to Explore, Express and Excel. Academic achievement is excellent with impressive outcomes. Over 95% of Upper Sixth leavers move on to top universities and higher education courses each year, including over 80 places at Oxbridge and 100 to Medical Schools in the past decade. In addition, places are regularly offered to prestigious art colleges and music conservatoires; for further education in the USA (Canford is an official SAT testing centre) and on degree apprenticeships, most recently with Goldman Sachs. Careers advice starts in Year 9 and pupils have access to contact with OCs and current parents working in a wide range of industries. There are also regular networking events held for OCs at home and abroad – Once a Canfordian, Always a Canfordian. There is a diverse range of intellectual, artistic, cultural and sporting activities on offer for all abilities and pupils are encouraged to make connections between all aspects of their learning. Whether your passion is debating global issues with Model UN, racing an electric F24 car, playing national level netball or with Bath Rugby Academy, music making with the National Youth Orchestra, rowing at Henley or winning a national Maths challenge – these are just some of many opportunities grasped by our pupils as they develop their interests and aim high. Facilities include a sports complex, theatre, music school, art gallery, 9 hole golf course, Real Tennis court and boathouse."
