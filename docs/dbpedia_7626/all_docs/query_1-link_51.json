If you are already a pupil at the school you will begin this process during year 11\n\nIf you are at another school, you might like to ask to visit, or attend an open day/evening. Look on the school website for details or give the school a call to make arrangements.\n\nDo I need any extra help or advice?\n\nIf you are still at school, your school must provide you with access to independent advice and guidance on all your post 16 options.\n\nIf you are not in education, employment or training, The Shaw Trust can help.\n\nFor further help and support, you can talk to an impartial adviser at the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900.\n\nFollow @NationalCareers on Twitter or like them on Facebook.\n\nWhat support could I get if I choose this option?"
