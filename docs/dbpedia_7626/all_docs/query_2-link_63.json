        "text": "A lot of people said I should be in the team, but now I am determined to force my way back in by playing well in Saracens' run-in.\n\nI was told I would be on the bench before Clive Woodward had a brief chat with me about it.\n\nWe had our team meeting on Wednesday morning when the team was announced and then he spoke to us individually.\n\nI feel I have given a good account of myself in an England shirt. In my first game, in Argentina, I played well and I have been fairly happy with my performances since then.\n\nBut my England appearances have come in ones and twos, whereas it would be nice to have a run of four or five games together. Maybe the summer tour to the southern hemisphere will be the opportunity to do that. I feel I have got more to offer England.\n\nThe squad got together on Tuesday and we had two fairly difficult sessions. They were really physical, a lot of full contact stuff and some defensive work.\n\nBall retention has been an important part of it, trying to keep the ball alive for five or six phases. Against Scotland the key will be keeping the ball alive until the gaps appear. Later this week we will work on the set pieces.\n\nScotland are always dangerous when they are the underdogs and they are a ferocious force at Murrayfield. They have got absolutely nothing to lose because we are such firm favourites.\n\nBut, look at France v Ireland, Richmond v Newcastle and Gloucester v Saracens - favourites soon get turned over if they are not on top of their game.\n\nTalking of the Gloucester defeat, I thought in the first half we played quite well. Our defence was not at the level it should have been but we went in at half time on level terms.\n\nAnd for the first 20 minutes of the second half we were even with them, but in the last 20 minutes Gloucester just ran away with it and I am not sure how.\n\nWe have been leaking a few too many points in the last few games, but our defence has been our strength this season. It is a key to our success that we stop the other side scoring. It's not as if they have been penalties, we have been conceding too many tries.\n\nIn the second half, when I went close to scoring and it looked inevitable we would get a try, only for Gloucester to score one instead, that really galvanised their effort. I was still confident we could win but we could not get the ball back in the last 10 minutes.\n\nConverted for the new archive on 30 June 2000.
