Where schools have changed type recently, data for previous years covering their previous incarnation is included below as well.\n\nWhat type of school is The Campion School and what are the admission criteria?\n\nInformation School Details Type Academy - Converter mainstream Age Range 11 to 18 Gender Boys Religion Roman Catholic Admission Policy Non-selective\n\nHow many children have been on the school roll in recent years?\n\nPupil characteristics - what percentage of pupils are in different groups and how does this compare to the national average?\n\nPupil characteristics\n\nPupils Pupils - School Pupils - National % English not as first language 10.2 16.5 % Free School Meals 2.1 14 % SEN Statement / EHC 0.7 4.4 % SEN 2.9 10.4\n\nHow do we rate this school?\n\nRating 2019 Rating 2018 Rating 2017 Rating Overall Stars 5 5 4 Overall Score 67.9 61.8 55.2 England Rank 218 (out of 3,166) 363 (out of 3,031) 1,046 (out of 3,088) Local Rank 2 3 3 Missing Data? Yes - - Data missing 5 (out of 46) - -\n\nOur unique rating system takes into account a range of different indicators to evaluate a school's performance. The system tracks achievement, attendance, teaching, how well the school is preparing pupils for the future and whether it is improving.\n\nData may be missing for some indicators because it has not been published. This may be because the school is new or because it is very small so data has been suppressed to avoid identifying individual pupils. Schools do not lose points for missing data, so will still fare better in the ranking than schools that underperform on that indicator, but they cannot score as highly as schools that perform well on the indicator.\n\nSchools that have opened in recent years and are yet to have pupils sit GCSEs are flagged as NEW, and are not scored on any of the indicators.\n\nHow The Campion School scores in terms of stars for each indicator.\n\nStar Ratings Stars - 2019 Stars - 2018 Stars - 2017 Attainment 5 5 5 Progress 5 4 3 Attendance 5 5 5 Outcomes 5 5 2\n\nWhat Ofsted says about this school\n\nIn its most recent inspection, Ofsted has given The Campion School an overall rating of Good.\n\nIf the table is blank, it means there are no recent inspections for this school. The inspection details are correct as of March 31, 2019.\n\nPrior to September 2012, a score of 3 indicated Satisfactory, it now indicates Requires Improvement.\n\nOverview School Overview Overall Effectiveness Good Inspection Date 24/05/12 Web Link Read Report Category of Concern\n\nHow does The Campion School perform on each of the areas inspected by Ofsted? A blank table indicates no recent inspections and as of September 2012, a score of 3 changed from indicating Satisfactory to Requires Improvement.\n\nCategory Ofsted Outcomes for pupils Good Quality of teaching, learning and assessment Good Effectiveness of leadership and management Good Personal development, behaviour and welfare\n\nAttainment\n\nHow have pupils at The Campion School done in their GCSEs and how does it compare to Local Authority and national averages?\n\nThe government introduced the Attainment 8 measure in 2016 (although some schools chose to opt in a year earlier). It measures pupil performance across maths, which is double weighted in the score, English, also double weighted, three qualifications included in the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and three other approved qualifications (GCSE or equivalent).\n\nThe higher the average score the better pupils at the school are doing.\n\nThe majority of GCSEs are now graded on a system of 9-1 grades, where 5 is a strong pass, equivalent to a high C and 4 is a standard pass, where the bottom of the boundary aligns with the bottom of a previous grade C.\n\nThe change was introduced in 2017 for English and maths with other subjects changing in 2018 or 2019.\n\nIn 2018 the average Attainment 8 score per pupil at The Campion School was 57.9.\n\nGroup School LA National All pupils 57.9 46.9 46.4 Girls NA 48.9 49.3 Boys 57.9 45 43.8 Disadvantaged 53.3 36.8 36.7 Low attainment SUPP 21.2 22.6 Middle attainment 47.9 40.6 40.8 High attainment 66.4 59.9 61.1 English as an additional language 60.8 49.3 47.2\n\nThe EBacc was introduced in 2010 and the government announced in 2015 its intention that all pupils should take it from 2020 onwards. The Ebacc is made up of English, Maths, History or Geography, Sciences, and a language. To achieve it, pupils must get a 9 to 4 grade in English and Maths and a C grade or above in the other subjects.\n\nIn 2018, 64% of pupils at The Campion School had entries in all EBacc subject areas and 46% achieved the EBacc, with a standard pass in English and Maths, while 30% achieved it with a strong pass in those subjects.\n\nWhat proportion of different groups at the school also passed the EBacc with standard passes.\n\nIn 2017, the most recent results available, 85% of pupils at The Campion School gained at least 5 A* to C or 9-4 grade GCSES including English and Maths at 9 to 4. Nationally 60.1% of pupils achieved this.\n\nHow does The Campion School do when it comes to GCSE results in just English and Maths and what percentage of pupils pass those at A* to C or 9 to 4 grades?\n\nAnd what proportion of pupils achieved strong (grades 9 to 5) passes in both English and maths?\n\nYear for outcome % strong 9-5 passes LA - % strong 9-5 passes National - % strong 9-5 passes 2018 69 44 43 2017 63 47 43\n\nProgress\n\nThe Progress 8 measure was also introduced by the Government in 2016. It is calculated for each pupil by comparing their Attainment 8 score to the scores of all pupils nationally with similar prior achievement at the end of primary school. The school's Progress 8 score is the average of all those scores.\n\nA score of 0 means pupils have made similar progress during secondary school to similar pupils across England. Above 0 means more progress and below 0 means less progress.
