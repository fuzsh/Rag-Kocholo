        "text": "The Campion School, located in Hornchurch, London, England, is a distinguished Roman Catholic institution that caters to boys for secondary education and transitions into a coeducational sixth form. Established in September 1962, the school carries a rich heritage originating from the Society of Jesus and now operating as an academy. Its motto \"Auctore Deo\" reflects the deeply rooted Catholic values emphasizing its academic, spiritual, and moral growth, cultivating virtuous behaviors such as charity, courage, forgiveness, gratitude, honesty, humility, and resilience.\n\nCampion School is recognized for its specialism in science, which continues from when it was a designated Specialist Science College, and it has now converted into an academy as of August 2011. The school's history includes a legacy of Jesuit teachers, and students benefit from its attached Sixth Form that admits girls who respect its Catholic ethos. With a mission to promote an outstanding sporting reputation locally and nationally, particularly in rugby, the school has a passionate and competitive sporting culture. Headmaster Paul Larner oversees this thriving institution. Famous alumni include the band Queen's drummer, Roger Taylor, and notable classical conductor Paul McCreesh."
