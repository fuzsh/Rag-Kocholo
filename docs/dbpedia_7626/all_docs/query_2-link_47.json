We acknowledge Elders past and present and the importance of Indigenous Knowledges to this University’s and this Faculty’s past, present and future.\n\nWe are Australia’s pre-eminent Arts Faculty, at the heart of the country’s second oldest and highest rated University. Our flagship Bachelor of Arts degree has been offered for over 160 years. It is the number one choice in Arts for generations of students engaging with humanities, social sciences and languages. We are committed to equity and to civic responsibility, to courage and creativity, to rigour and integrity, and to critical independence.\n\nThe Arts are needed now more than ever to take carriage of the significant challenges of our time – climate change, pandemics, displacement of populations, justice, conflict, governance and trust. In this context strong critical thinkers with a diversity of knowledge and expertise are essential. Our work in partnership and our deep conversations with the communities in which we live and with our national and global community, enable this.\n\nThe humanities and social sciences are core to building the world we want to live in. Our students are at the heart of what we do. Arts is a fantastic career choice, that equips our graduates with what our world needs for our shared and complex futures. I welcome you to our Faculty, and look forward to working together.”"
