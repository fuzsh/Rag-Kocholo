        "text": "Graham Rowntree has described England’s untimely ejection from their own World Cup as a “terrible experience” but he is back, re-energised and excited about his latest challenge. Harlequins have confirmed that Rowntree will begin as their forwards coach this summer under a new panel headed by John Kingston, who moves from head coach to director of rugby following the departure of Conor O’Shea to Italy.\n\nRowntree is the third and final member of Stuart Lancaster’s team of assistant coaches to settle on a new role since the disappointment of the autumn. By the adage that what does not break you makes you stronger, he is looking forward to his new adventure with confidence and a spring in his step.\n\n“I am able to put it in a box and move on, yeah,” he says of his World Cup experience. “It will always be a regret, to say the least. It was a terrible experience but I learned a lot from it. You have to or it counts for nothing. It should stand me in good stead going forward. I come here now after an enforced exile from the game with a whole heap of energy to give back. Club rugby, week in week out, that belonging, I’ve missed it, to be honest. I’m ready for it.”\n\nAfter the slow torture of the World Cup fallout Rowntree has spent the past few months with his family watching rugby for the love of it. He was there as a fan for both England’s wins at Twickenham in the Six Nations when, under Eddie Jones and a new panel of coaches, they bounced back to win the grand slam. But he has seen little of his fellow coaches since Jones decided to bring in a new team.\n\n“We spent a lot of time sat in a room during the post-World Cup review but since Christmas we’ve not spent much time together. One of the worst things in life is uncertainty. There was a degree of uncertainty around Stuart’s position and then Stuart left. Eddie came in and chose to go down a different route. They’ve done exceptionally well and I was genuinely delighted when I watched them lift that trophy. I was chuffed to bits. We’d been that close and it helps everyone move on.”\n\nAnother man for whom Harlequins’ announcement represents a catharsis of sorts is Kingston. Those who were there remember well the dark, soaking night at the Madejski Stadium in 1999 when he oversaw his last home match in charge of Richmond. Ashley Levett had announced that he was withdrawing his funding and the ruined club was expelled from the top flight. A shaken Kingston mused that night on whether he could remain in a sport that countenanced the sort of machinations he had been witness to.\n\n“When the whole thing ended at Richmond,” he said, “I wasn’t sure if I was going to spend that much more time in England. It was a difficult time but the 15 years that I’ve had at Harlequins [after two years’ coaching in Ireland] have been fantastic.”\n\nNow he has his head again. He stood in as a temporary director of rugby in 2009, between the reigns of O’Shea and his predecessor, Dean Richards, who left in disgrace following the Bloodgate scandal, another low that Kingston has had to endure. In the seven years since, as head coach, he has guided the team through their most successful period, winning a Premiership title, among other trophies, in 2012.\n\n“This just seems the perfect opportunity for me to take this further step. It is not something I considered lightly, putting my name forward, but I felt that it was the right thing for the club. It was a natural progression.”\n\nBar the introduction of Rowntree, Harlequins have kept the new appointments internal. Mark Mapletoft, the backs coach, replaces Kingston as head coach, while Nick Easter becomes defence coach. Easter will retain his playing contract but Kingston was at pains to point out that he will be a coach first and foremost, not a player-coach. Tony Diprose, the current defence coach, assumes the grand – and new – title of academy and global development director."
