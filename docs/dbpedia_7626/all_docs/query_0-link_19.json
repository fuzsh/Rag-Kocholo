        "text": "The first big domestic league weekend saw cross-country runners in action with Belgrave excelling in a top class event at Richmond Park\n\nTRACKSMITH SURREY LEAGUE Div 1, Richmond Park, October 14\n\nBelgrave Harriers had a great day winning both senior team events and also taking the individual honours too through Ian Crowe-Wright and Kate Axford.\n\nThe senior women were off first at the early start time of 11am over a fast but testing parkland course.\n\nIt soon became a two-way race between Belgrave’s former hockey international Axford and Herne Hill’s Georgie Grgec.\n\nIn her first Surrey League, Axford’s power told on the second lap and she eventually won by 20 seconds from Grgec, who had won the previous league fixture at Croydon in February.\n\nAlmost a minute further back was Eliza Hawthorn of Stragglers in third.\n\nBelgrave had five of the first 10 and won easily from Thames Hare and Hounds with Belgrave B beating Herne Hill for third spot.\n\nLisa Bailey was first W40 in 13th and Clare Grima the best of the W45s with leading W50 Sophie Biggs just heading top W55 Clare Elms.\n\nBelgrave were not as dominant in the men’s race winning by just two points from Hercules Wimbledon even though they had a 23 point lead over the first three scorers but Hercules, with just one in the top 13 packing superbly in the 10 to score contest.\n\nHerne Hill were narrowly third just ahead of local rivals Dulwich Runners who had their best ever league result in fourth.\n\nThe individual honours went to Crowe-Wright who this year has improved his 5000m PB to 13:28.08. He had been second in his two league outings last year.\n\nHe won by 12 seconds from Scot Max Milarvie, who was running his first cross-country race for Dulwich.\n\nJack Millar, twice fifth in the English National, and top M40 Andy Coley-Maud, the 2018 English National silver medallist, completed a quality top four.\n\nSimon Coombes was first M50.\n\nUnder-15 Isabella Harrison dominated the combined U17/15 race while Hercules Wimbledon also provided the under-13 winner through Alex Bramwell.\n\nSutton’s English Schools’ runner-up Alex Lennon won the under-17 men’s race with Caspian Holmes the first under-15 in eighth overall while Hercules Theo Creed easily won the under-13 race.\n\nMen:\n\n1 I Crowe-Wright (Bel) 25:50;

Here, Slade repeated his win from the final match of last season, which was his first ever in the league.\n\nJust a few seconds down were St Albans’ 3:38.35 performer James McMurray and Bedford junior Noel Campions.\n\nChiltern also took the under-17 men’s race as Alex Hughes also got the better of a division two runner in the form of Luton’s Josh Hampson-Wallace, to repeat his February win in the league.\n\nLast year, Milton Keynes’ Southern champion Jacque Smith had a clean sweep in the under-13 races but here had to concede to St Albans’ Oscar Nagalingam as he moved up an age group.\n\nThe senior women’s race saw Rebecca Murray, the English National fifth placer, post a comfortable victory over Milton Keynes’ W40 Lara Bromilow.\n\nAlmost immediately after finishing her 6.1km race, Bromilow then ran in the men’s 10km where she recorded 37:37.\n\nKatie Webb, the English Schools sixth placed runner, repeated her under-15 girls’ race victory from the final match at Keysoe last winter and did so ahead of Milton Keynes team mate Sophia Chapman.\n\nEnglish National bronze medallist Kara Gorman has a two-year unbroken stretch of league wins and here it continued with another easy looking victory over fellow Chiltern Harrier Juliette MacDowell, in the under-13 race.\n\nOverall, Chiltern again came out on top in the multi-age-group totals despite being headed by Bedford Harriers in the overall men’s event.\n\nMen (10km): 1 R Slade (Chilt) 29:59;

Heaton Park\n\nEd Shepherd enjoyed a close duel with Vale Royal teammate Aaron Doyle before prevailing by 24 seconds on a sunny yet breezy Autumnal afternoon, Steve Green reports.\n\nShepherd was at the fore of a phalanx of around a dozen men coming up the first long climb on the first of three large laps.\n\nBy lap two the duo had drawn clear with Shepherd utilising his 14:10 5km strength on the woodland areas to pull clear of Doyle. Stockport’s Ed Corden ran splendidly to finish third another 100m in arrears. Karl Darcy, first M40 in 11th led Salford Harriers to a team win. Joshua Wragg was the first under-20 to break the tape.\n\nEmily Kearney left no room for debate in a top-quality women’s race and was quickly at the head of affairs on the first of three small laps fighting against a brief heavy rainstorm. The Warriors Pentathlon & AC athlete, who has run 15:39 for 5km, was around 70m clear of Mollie Williams by halfway and made light work of the sweeping downhills and sharp climbs to extend her advantage to 23 seconds by the tape.\n\nSophie Wood held down third place 20 seconds down and led Sale Harriers to a resounding team win. First under-20 in 14th place was Lucy Fairclough of St Helen’s Sutton, whilst League ever-present Diane McVey of Wilmslow, was the first W40 home.\n\nNia Griffin of Start2Jog had a comfortable victory with a 59 second margin in the under-17 girls’ section, ahead of Rosie Philbin of Stockport Harriers, with Sarah Smith of Warriors Pentathlon & AC third. In the under-17 boys’ race Finlay Day and namesake Goddard both of Sale Harriers, resisted the efforts of Oberon Kearney with Day eventually pulling clear by five seconds by the tape.\n\nIsla Pastor continued the winning ways for Warriors Pentathlon & AC in the under-15 girls’ race, 20 seconds ahead of Oonagh McManus with fellow ‘Warrior’ Holly Coates in third. Trafford’s Pio Aron showed great strength in the latter stages to emerge the victor by six seconds to the good ahead of Alex Fraser, with Jake Ireland in third.\n\nMore success followed in the under-13 girls’ event for Warriors as sisters Eve and Isobel Beddow pulled clear of Sale Harrier Isobel Soper, with Eve taking the spoils by seven seconds. Bobby Birkett shone for St Helen’s Sutton, with a 13 second win over Nathaniel Glascott- Tull of the Warriors outfit, with Liverpool’s Bobby McEvoy third in the boys’ section.\n\nDaisy McVicar of Warriors took the inaugural under-11 girls’ race, well clear of Emilia Gandy, while Ethan Statham of Bury edged Tommy Collard in the boys’ version.\n\nMen:\n\n1 E Shepherd Vale Royal 32:56; 2 A Doyle Vale Royal 33:20; 3 E Corden Stockport H 33:38; 4 Matthew Leahy Liverpool H 33:46; 5 J Buckley St Helens Sutton Ac 33:46; 6 A Lawton Sale Harriers Manchester 33:49; 7 J Kevan Horwich R M I 33:52; 8 P Taylor-Bray Chorlton Runners 34:03; 9 L Hudson University Of Manchester 34:04; 10 C Broadbent University Of Manchester 34:19; 11 K Darcy M40 Salford H 34:22; 12 L Foley Horwich R M I 34:25; 13 D Fox Warrington A C 34:29; 14 M Barnes M45 Sale Harriers Manchester 34:43; 15 R Sharkey n/s 34:48; 16 R Worland Salford H 34:51; 17 J Hudak East Cheshire Harriers & Tames 34:55; 18 S DelCampo Manchester Met Unive 35:00; 19 D Wood Stockport Harriers & Ac 35:04; 20 R Smyk Salford Harriers & AC 35:08\n\nTEAM: 1 Salford H 158; 2 Sale Harriers Manchester 195; 3 Horwich R M I Harriers 219\n\nWomen: 1 E Kearney Warriors 31:56; 2 M Williams Stockport Harriers & Ac 33:19; 3 S Wood Sale Harriers Manchester 33:39; 4 R Jones Salford Harriers & AC 34:04; 5 H Warburton Sale Harriers Manchester 34:08; 6 K Moulds Vale Royal Ac 34:20; 7 L Whittingham Wilmslow Running Club 35:07; 8 K Fitzpatrick W35 Chorlton Runners 35:18; 9 A Wright Sale Harriers Manchester 35:32; 10 B Reid Manchester Metropolitan Univer 35:35; 11 J Nugent W35 Sale Harriers Manchester 35:36; 12 L Quine W35 Liverpool Harriers & Ac 35:49; 13 R McQuillan Warrington A C 36:20; 14 L Fairclough U20 St Helens Sutton Ac 36:25; 15 L Lombard W40 Salford Harriers & AC 36:30; 16 I Trinder Glossopdale Harriers 37:14; 17 V Cronin Trafford Athletic Club 37:18; 18 D McVey W45 1 Wilmslow Running Club 37:28; 19 S Hudak Trafford Athletic Club 37:46; 20 K Reynolds Salford Harriers & AC 37:48\n\nTEAM: 1 Sale Harriers Manchester 28; 2 Trafford 85; 3 Wilmslow Running Club 85\n\nMETROPOLITAN LEAGUE, Claybury, October 14\n\nRoger Poolman, a physics teacher who last won a Met League race at Wormwood Scrubs in 2019, led Highgate Harriers to victory. They finished their 12 scorers in 41 of 390 finishers, showing their intent to win the league for the 11th year, Alastair Aitken reports.\n\nIn the cool but often sunny weather on the undulating Claybury course, Poolman said: “I was hoping to stay in group for the first mile but put an effort in on the second lap.”\n\nIn second place was Terry Fawden, who was just strong enough to get ahead of his clubmate Alex Lepretre on the last hill as Highgate completed a top three ahead of Thames Valley’s Chris Thomas.\n\nLiz Janes went well clear of the women’s field early on and, never looked like giving any ground away. She had her whole family (runner Matt Janes and her three children) supporting her.\n\nIn second place was Rebecca Piggott, who led favourites London Heathside to top the table, while in third was Yasmin Goater, who achieved her best Met League position.\n\nIn the under-17s Luke Dunham, wearing a white cap like his hero Dave Wottle, went clear in the last 200m. Surprisingly 113 ran in that race or 15/17 combined. Dunham is an 8:49 3000 runner and coached by Andy Hobdale.\n\nJorjia March, the National cross-country champion in February in the under-13s, won the under-15/17 women’s race. She also has an impressive record on the track as an 800m runner and is in year nine at The Latymer School.\n\nAbigail Reid was second.\n\nEllina Ponkratieva, whose parents came from Siberia, led a St Mary’s top three in the under-13 girls race.\n\nAidan Wolpert, who pushed it on the second lap, won the under-13 boys race.\n\nMen:\n\n1 R Poolman (High) 25:00;

The younger male events are six to run and the others four per team and the remaining places were selected by committee.\n\nThe International cross-country is not yet offering equal opportunity for gender and age!\n\nThe event here was compromised slightly when the organisers of the league event refused to allow athletes to compete in the league and the Masters event which led to some confusion in the results (they were not available until four days after the event) and team selection with some athletes told of their selection which was then later changed though all athletes offered selection were at least included in the reserves.\n\nThe original team manager Matt Long has now resigned and been replaced by former managers Harry and Kim Matthews.\n\nMidlands sixth-placer and Lee Gratton was a clear overall winner of the men’s main race.\n\nGratton, 16th in the Inter Counties at Loughborough, won from fellow M35 Paul Wright as unusually the M35s dominated with nine of the first 14 finishers.\n\nFirst M45 Jan Bailey who was fifth and first Englishman in the Masters International in Dublin, was third across the line ahead of Stephen Jackson who led home the M40s by two seconds from Rob Warner.\n\nBen Paviour led home the M50s from World Masters Indoor 3000m champion Anthony O’Brien.\n\nPhil Leybourne, who competed for England in the International five years ago, narrowly led home the M55s in the Vets but it’s worth noting that multi masters international winner Tim Hartley was a couple of minutes quicker in the league and will lead England in Glasgow.\n\nJohn Convery, who was second M60 in Dublin, led home his age group narrowly from Peter Knight.\n\nThe women’s race plus M65 and over men, was comfortably won by BMAF cross-country and 1500m champion Juliet Potter. Potter was second W40 in Dublin.\n\nBecky Penty was first W35 home 25 seconds back but was the only W35 to make the top six.\n\nW40 Rebecca Luxton just beat her fellow age groupers Nicola Curtis and Jane Hodgson to take third overall.\n\nSarah Murphy was sixth and the leading W45 while in tenth in-form European Masters 800m champion Nikki Sturzaker was clearly first W50.\n\nNicki Nealon, a multi European and World masters track medallist in the W40 age group, but has not competed in the International since being a W45 in 2014, led home the W55s though was just behind Monica Williamson, third in Dublin, who was first W60 by over a minute from Sue Cordingly.\n\nThe W65 was much closer with Lorraine Daglish finishing just two seconds clear of Jenny Morgan.\n\nDot Kesterton was first W70 and she was just over a minute ahead of leading W75 Angela Copson, just a few weeks after winning European W75 gold at 800m, 1500m, 5000m and 10,000m as well as relay gold.\n\nCopson led home her age group by ten minutes from Elaine Statham\n\nThe men were led home by Jonathan Haynes, who third in Dublin and finished 24th within the women’s and M65 plus race.\n\nKevin Newman was just 13 seconds back.\n\nClose behind the leading 65s was first M70 David Butler who finished almost a minute ahead of Stan Owen. The 1972 Olympic 1500m semi finalist and European Indoor 3000m medallist Ray Smedley was sixth in his age group.\n\nThe M75 was unusually one of the most competitive age groups and last year’s Dublin winner Peter Giles, who is now aged 79, could only finish fourth here in a race won by BMAF 400m, 800m and 1500m champion Malcolm Weir from John Exley.\n\nEngland’s team are expected to do better than in Dublin but it is clear that so far a separate trial race has not attracted as many leading English vets as anticipated and some suggest awarding it an England Championships event with medals might give it a greater purpose and stronger field and possibly not holding it on a league weekend might make the younger age groups stronger.\n\nM35:\n\n1 L Gratton 36:18; 2 P Wright 37:34; 3 G Jayasuriya 37:41; 4 R Connor 39:16; 5 D Awde 39:16; 6 J Read 39:28; 7 J Carter 39:36\n\nM40:\n\n1 S Jackson 38:01; 2 B Gamble 38:03; 3 R Warner 38:43; 4 M Eccles 39:15; 5 N Phillips 39:48; 6 D Wheat 40:31; 7 L Athersmith 40:58\n\nM45:\n\n1 J Bayley 37:36; 2 M Burrett 39:13; 3 O Beale 39:42; 4 J Hunter 40:08; 5 A Gibbins 40:41; 6 G Raven 40:50; 7 A Russell 41:28\n\nM50:\n\n1 B Paviour 39:42; 2 A O’Brien 40:03; 3 S Doyle 40:21; 4 J Prest 40:36; 5 A Bond 40:57; 6 A Beevers 41:21; 7 C Nicoll 42:09\n\nM55:\n\n1 P Leybourne 41:26; 2 F Rafferty 41:34; 3 J Richardson 43:50; 4 A Brown 45:02; 5 T Hyland 48:28; 6 D Hands 48:34\n\nM60:\n\n1 J Convery 42:57; 2 P Knight 43:06; 3 S Watmough 43:22; 4 A Marshall 44:06; 5 M Tennyson 44:09; 6 E Southam 44:22; 7 M Cursons 44:44; 8 D Ogden 45:22\n\nM65 (6km approx.):\n\n1 J Haynes 26:05; 2 K Newman 26:18; 3 D Bedwell 27:10; 4 M Whitmore 27:35; 5 G Davis 28:49; 6 D Gibbons 29:06; 7 M Eustace 29:30; 8 C Morrison 29:31\n\nM70:\n\n1 D Butler 26:23; 2 S Owen 27:14; 3 T Hutchison 28:06; 4 J Skelton 28:30; 5 S Thorp 28:53; 6 R Smedley 29:03; 7 M Page 29:49\n\nM75:\n\n1 M Weir 30:10; 2 J Exley 30:32; 3 P Young 30:53; 4 P Giles 32:18; 5 M McNally 32:22; 6 R Bloom 32:33; 7 G Newton 32:52; 8 M Mann 32:53\n\nW35 (6km approx.):\n\n1 B Penty 24:08; 2 T Rogers 24:33; 3 L Niemz 24:38; 4 R Gallop 25:03; 5 N Sutton 25:14; 6 F Sharpley 25:55; 7 K Sheedy 26:09\n\nW40:\n\n1 Juliet Potter 23:43; 2 R Luxton 24:18; 3 N Curtis 24:21; 4 J Hodgson 24:23; 5 E Renondeau 24:48; 6 J Franklin 25:13; 7 C Wills 25:35; 8 L Gawthorne 25:36; 9 L Da Silva 25;44; 10 A Baird 26:04\n\nW45:\n\n1 S Murphy 24:31; 2 J Sanzo 25:26; 3 Z Oldfield 25:37; 4 M Cook 25:52; 5 S Lewis 25:56; 6 C Lathwell 26:10; 7 K Haniver 26:43\n\nW50:\n\n1 N Sturzaker 25:03; 2 K Rennie 25:18; 3 A Davies 26:50; 4 C Betmead 26:52; 5 R Coupe 27:44; 6 R Thackray 27:47; 7 H Smith 28:07\n\nW55:\n\n1 N Nealon 26:59; 2 N Skilton 27:15; 3 C Jolliffe 27:34; 4 K Ramsey 27:57; 5 F Jeffries 29:07; 6 J Hanmer 29:27; 7 R Loutit 29:39\n\nW60:\n\n1 M Williamson 26:55; 2 S Cordingly 28:01; 3 C Wood 28:08; 4 C Page 28:09; 5 H Robinson 29:53; 6 S Gill 29:59; 7 G Richardson 30:16\n\nW65:\n\n1 L Daglish 31:21; 2 J Morgan 31:23; 3 J Fabes 32:01; 4 L New 32:02. 5 M Derrick 32:20; 6 M Thompson 34:24\n\nW70:\n\n1 D Kesterton 32:26; 2 M Statham-Berry 34:29 3 J Georghiou 37:18\n\nW75:\n\n1 A Copson 33:23; 2 E Statham 43:25\n\nSUSSEX LEAGUE, Goodwood, October 14\n\nThe downs adjacent to the famous Goodwood racecourse were again pressed into service just two weeks after the venue hosted the county cross-country relay championship, Martin Duff reports.\n\nFormer Hastings AC runner Ross Skelton came out on top of the senior men’s race in the colours of relatively new outfit Hy Runners. It was the 30-year-old’s first outing over the country since winning this fixture a year earlier.\n\nUnder-20 Alexander Riley took second and comfortably led Brighton & Hove to another senior men’s team win.\n\nThere was no 1094 race victory for James Baker on his home course, but the M45 was top veteran home.\n\nThere were repeat wins for under-15 and under-13 winners Daisy Connor and Inter-Counties silver medallist Isabella Buchanan from the final race of last winter in the well supported younger races.\n\nUnder-17 women dominated the all of the other women’s race with six of the top dozen home and nine of the top 20. They were led by the Lewes AC pairing of Ava James and Esme Stephenson and the team race was comfortably theirs.\n\nMen:\n\n1 R Skelton (Hy R) 21:58; 2 A Riley (B&H, U20) 24;18; 3 R Fitzgibbon (Phoe) 24:42; 4 M Grindrod (B&H) 24;48; 5 K Barnes (B&H) 24:53; 6 H Yelling (B&H, U20) 25:13\n\nM40: 1 J Baker (Chich R, M45) 25:16\n\nM50: 1 J Skinner (Hay H) 26:47\n\nM60: 1 M Dooley (B&H) 32:26\n\nM70: 1 D Beattie (Craw) 45:26\n\nU20: 3 T Hutton (Phoe) 25:23\n\nTEAM\n\nDiv 1 (6 to score): 1 Brighton & H 44; 2 Phoenix 105; 3 Lewes 176; 4 B&H B 199; 5 Haywards H 208; 6 Hy R 333\n\nDiv 2: 1 Eastbourne 126; 2 Worthing 151; 3 Phoenix B 154\n\nM40 TEAM: 1 B&H 11; 2 Haywards H 20; 3 Phoenix 28\n\nU17:\n\n1 F Goodman (B&H) 15:55; 2 T Matthews (B&H) 16:15; 3 F Pearce (E’brne) 16:28\n\nTEAM: 1 B&H 8; 2 B&H B 36; 3 Crawley 37\n\nU15:\n\n1 J Trotman (Lewes) 14:01; 2 B Stewart (Chich R) 14:03; 3 F Lumber (E’brne) 14:15\n\nTEAM: 1 Eastbourne 19; 2 Lewes 20; 3 Chichester R 29\n\nU13:\n\n1 T Thorn-Watts (B&H) 10:59; 2 J Webster (E’brne) 12:12; 3 L De Giovani (Ports, gst) 11;12\n\nTEAM: 1 Eastbourne 14; 2 B&H 18; 3 Lewes 46\n\nWomen:\n\n1 A James (Lewes, U17) 17:53; 2 E Stephenson (Lewes, U17) 17:58; 3 E Strevens (E’brne) 18:28; 4 D Knotkova (Lewes) 18:43; 5 R Gasson (B&H, U17) 18:46; 6 N Lesova (Craw, U17) 18:49; 7 G Tuesday (Lewes, U17) 18:59; 8 E Carman (Worth, U17) 19:05; 9 G Wilkinson (Lewes) 19:09; 10 C Powderhill (Phoe) 19:15\n\nW45: 1 F Cripps (Chich R) 20:56; 2 S Fenmore (Chich R) 20:57\n\nW50: 1 S Fry (E’brne) 21:00\n\nW55: 1 N Anderson (Chich R) 23;31\n\nW60: 1 J Hughes (Arena) 23;47\n\nW65: 1 J Carder (B&H)) 25:17\n\nTEAM\n\nDiv 1 (4 to score): 1 Lewes 14; 2 Crawley 50; 3 Worthing 53; 4 Lewes B 81; 5 Eastbourne 101; 6 Phoenix 107\n\nDiv 2 (3 to score): 1 Chichester R 55; 2 Chich R B 88; 3 Worthing B 91\n\nW35 TEAM (3 to score): 1 Chichester R 20; 2 Eastbourne 28; 3 Worthing 41\n\nU17 TEAM: 1 Lewes 8; 2 Worthing 26; 3 Chichester R 29\n\nU15:\n\n1 D Connor (E’brne) 15:06; 2 F Pearce (E’brne) 15:15; 3 M Smithers (Chich R) 15:48\n\nTEAM: 1 Eastbourne 15; 2 B&H 30; 3 Crawley 35\n\nU13:\n\n1 I Buchanan (Hy R) 11:41; 2 A Whitehouse (Craw) 12:01; 3 G Fox (B&H) 12:05\n\nTEAM: 1 Hy R 10; 2 Crawley 21; 3 B&H 22\n\nAYRSHIRE RELAY CHAMPIONSHIPS, Irvine.
