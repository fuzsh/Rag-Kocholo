        "text": "Wanderers just missed promotion from Midlands Four West (South) last season but Hughes, who played for Worcester, Saracens and London Welsh at fly-half, will be there to aid their next bid.\n\nA teacher at Worcester Royal Grammar School since 1996, he was recently appointed as head of lower school, having been master in charge of rugby and director of sport at RGS since 2001.\n\nApart from playing at Saracens from 1992 to 1996 with England players Richard Hill and Tony Diprose, Hughes has also turned out for Welsh Students and Welsh Exiles.\n\nHe also set the club record for being the top points scorer in a league game with 24. Hughes boasts an adult level three coaching standard and has also led Worcestershire and North Midlands Under 18s since 1997.\n\nIn addition, the Welshman took RGS Worcester to the National Schools Under 18s Daily Mail Cup quarter-finals this year.\n\nNiall Crawford, Wanderers' backs and fitness coach, said: \"We are fortunate that Gareth is joining us.\n\n\"He has played for the Wanderers in the past and his inspirational play raises the standard of game of the players around him.\n\n\"Steve Lloyd and I have had good success with the Wanderers and feel with Gareth's tactical skills he will add a new dimension to our play.\"\n\nChairman Michael Clarke said: \"I am delighted that Gareth has chosen to join us. This appointment is superb. I have seen him play and he was always pivotal and creative in style.\n\n\"We are very fortunate to have the commitment that Steve and Niall have given to the club for the past few years. With Gareth's strategic input, we are preparing for future promotion.\"\n\nClarke also praised a good season for the seconds and the Colts coaching by Ashley Jones, Stuart James and Pete Johnson.\n\nAnd fixtures secretary Roy Saunders is pleased with the increase in games for next season."
