        "text": "They enjoy dramatic finishes at Harlequins. And there was none more thrilling than the 2004 Parker Pen Cup final at Reading, where for all the world the old city slickers had looked a well beaten side until a moment of last gasp magic from their impish Irish winger Simon Keogh ensured that talismanic England prop Jason Leonard would end his career in fitting fashion.\n\nAgainst a highly skilled and well motivated Montferrand outfit containing a host of French stars such as Olivier Azam, Olivier Magne and Thibaut Privat, not to mention up and coming young tyros like Aurelien Rougerie, David Attoub and Anthony Floch, Quins had been up against it from the start and with just 64 seconds of the game remaining, found themselves 26-20 down.\n\nIt is at times like these that you seek divine intervention and Quins' salvation arrived in the form of a hot-headed French centre by the name of Raphael Chanal, who, with Montferrand camped five-metres from their opponents' try-line and looking for the kill, took exception to Leonard lying all over the ball and responded with a flurry of punches to the prone prop's head.\n\nHaving been sin-binned once, Chanal saw red and Quins were presented with a final opportunity to save the day. “We'd looked dead and buried, to be honest,” says the Quins No.8 that day, Tony Diprose. “It wasn't dissimilar to our Challenge Cup final against Stade Francais in Cardiff last year, where they got on top physically and looked as if they were going to win.\n\n“But we just managed to stay within range of them, which gave us a chance, and when Jason came on and got in the wrong position, it provoked Chanal into dishing out what he thought was a bit of justice. But instead it just gave us one last chance to launch an attack.”\n\nWhat followed was fairytale stuff. With 13,000 Harlequins fans on tenterhooks and Leonard's chances of ending his outstanding career with silverware in grave jeopardy, the ball was launched into Montferrand territory. With the clock on zero Quins went through the phases, before Keogh located an angle and burst on to a suspiciously angled pass from Ugo Monye to jink away and score joyously under the posts. Andy Dunne converted. Cue mayhem.\n\n“Was the final pass forward? Yes, probably by half a yard,” Diprose admits. “But he took it at pace and almost out of nowhere we'd won, because we hadn't had a sniff for 30 minutes. They had no chance to come back at us and I actually felt quite sorry for Montferrand, having literally had it snatched away from them with the last kick of the game. But it was a great way for Jason to go out.\n\n“We had some experienced guys in the side with Billy Davison and Andre Vos, who'd led the team fabulously all season, and it was a great group of players. The Irish boys had all been a key part of our campaign and Simon Keogh had that ability to sniff out a try, a bit like Paul Diggin does now at Northampton.”\n\nThe day, however, belonged to Leonard, who was sent up to collect the trophy. Diprose recalls: “I've known Jason for a long, long time and it meant a lot to him. He'd been a huge figure at Quins but perhaps it hadn't been as successful as he'd have liked in terms of winning trophies, so it was a very big game and him coming off the bench for that last few minutes made a difference.\n\n“His body was a bit jaded but he made an impact, as he always did. He was a guy you always wanted alongside you and if anyone deserved success it was him. We'd worked hard that season and had been looking for a trophy, so to get it on that day was absolutely immense.”\n\nWHERE ARE THEY NOW:\n\nTHE CLASS OF 2004\n\n1.
