        "text": "The Campion School is a Catholic boys' comprehensive school located in Hornchurch, in the London Borough of Havering. It was founded in September 1962 as a grammar school for Catholic boys from the ages of 11-16. Pupils who attend the school have to be Catholic and the school has a strong Catholic ethos. The school currently has five forms: Fisher, More, Fox, Garnet and Southwell.\n\nAll of these forms except Fox, which is named after the school's first headmaster Fr. Michael James Fox SJ, are named after Catholic saints who were martyred.\n\nThe school became a comprehensive in 1978.\n\nThe school also has an attached Sixth Form which admits a number of girls. The pupils that attend the Sixth Form do not have to be Catholic but have to respect the Catholic ethos that the school represents.\n\nThe school has an outstanding reputation in the local community of Havering and beyond with its pinnacle being its strong Rugby tradition. The school won the Daily Mail Cup, the premier rugby competition in the country in 2001 and reached the final in 2002, in the process becoming the first comprehensive to do so.\n\nThe school got a great Ofsted report early in 2007 which said the school was good. Out of the 26 areas Ofsted look at 15 were outstanding and 10 were good the rest needed improvement. They also said that the school's Sixth Form was outstanding. Out of the 12 areas Ofsted looked at, all of them were outstanding.\n\nThe Campion School has three main aims:\n\n# to develop in its pupils' inquiring minds through the study of a broad range of subjects and through the encouragement of self-discipline and hard work in the pursuit of excellence;\n\n# to encourage young people to fully develop themselves intellectually, socially, emotionally, physically and spiritually through academic study and through participation in extra curricular activities;\n\n# to lead young people to faith in Christ and to mature understanding of the Roman Catholic Faith\n\nHeadmasters\n\n*Fr Michael Fox, S.J.
