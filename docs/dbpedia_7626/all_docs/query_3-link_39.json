The high profile of the Hospice in the Albany Community together with the firsthand experience of the purpose of Hospice during her Mother’s 6 week stay in the Hospice, before her death in 2019, helped Helen make the decision to offer her services when the position of Treasurer of the Board of Management became vacant.\n\nTrish Ryans-Taylor – Secretary\n\nTrish moved to Albany in 2006 with her partner Eva to enjoy the Great Southern lifestyle after living in Perth for most of her life.

With a dedicated team of volunteers, the Sub-Branch was brought back from the brink of collapse to being a financially viable and a more community minded organisation.\n\nHelen is currently part of a development team working towards creating a not-for-profit organisation working in the field of veterans’ welfare and is looking forward to supporting Hospice staff and volunteers as a member of a proactive and conscientious Board."
