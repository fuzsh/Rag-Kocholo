        "text": "The 38-year-old called an end to his illustrious career at the end of last season after racking up more than 200 Premiership appearances before taking up a role with Bath’s youngsters shortly after.\n\nBut he has some way to go to emulate the work of Diprose at the Stoop, the likes of Joe Marler, George Lowe, Jordan Turner-Hall and captain Chris Robshaw all benefitting from his tutelage.\n\nThe class of 2011-12 looks to be just as potent with flanker Luke Wallace having started the season like a man possessed, and backs Ross Chisholm and Charlie Walker also tipped for big things.\n\nGrewcock saw firsthand the new troop in action as his Bath boys went up against Quins youngsters at the JP Morgan Sevens Series finals and the former England lock believes Diprose and co are the blueprints to follow.\n\n“Quins have made a really good start and I’d already seen bits of them during the Sevens and they looked pretty good during that,” said Grewcock, a member of England’s 2003 World Cup winning team.\n\n“They are doing incredibly well at the moment and not just in the league but also through their academy and they have had some great talents come through.\n\n“Part of my role with the academy at Bath is to develop young players and Quins are doing a great job in that respect.\n\n“I have to try to get the guys playing as well as they can as quickly as they can and that is something the guys at Quins seem to have no problem with.\n\n“Tony Diprose is doing a fantastic job down at Quins, bringing the young guys through and that’s paying dividends in the league so far and that is something I am looking to emulate.”\n\nThe good feeling around the Stoop extends far beyond the academy ranks with Conor O’Shea leading the senior side to four straight victories to open the new season, all without key duo Nick Easter and Danny Care.\n\nBut Grewcock has warned against any complacency creeping into the Stoop, insisting the league has never looked so tough.\n\n“You look through the whole Premiership and it’s getting tougher and tougher every year and this year is no different,” he added. “Every squad is getting stronger and stronger and it does mean it’s going to be exciting.”\n\nThe Heroes Rugby Challenge, is on December 3 at Twickenham Stadium. Ticket prices start at £30 for adults and are available through ticketmaster.co.uk or by calling 0844 847 2492."
