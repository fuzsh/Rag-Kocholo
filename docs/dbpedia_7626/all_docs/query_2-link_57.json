        "text": "English Premiership side Harlequins have confirmed that former Washington Huskies linebacker, Psalm Wooching will be in their 16-man squad to participate in the Beachcomber World Club 10s tournament this June.\n\n23 year-old Wooching recently turned down the opportunity to play professionally in the NFL to pursue his first love of playing rugby. The versatile back developed his rugby skills in his native Hawaii and represented Kealakeha High School and Washington University before his talents caught the eyes of the American Football coaches.\n\nHaving converted back to rugby union, he recently had a trial with French Top 14 side Pau. Confirming the news, Harlequins Academy and Global Development Director, Tony Diprose, said:\n\n“This will be a great opportunity and experience for Psalm to continue his pathway into rugby from American Football; we are very excited to have him within our ranks for the World Club 10s.\n\n“It also provides Harlequins with the opportunity to have a good look at him in a high-quality international tournament such as this one. This will also give him the chance to see how an elite professional rugby team operates.\n\n“The opportunity to welcome Psalm on board has come with the help of Atavus and as part of Harlequins’ commitment to develop rugby in the USA. Following the World Club 10s tournament, Gary Street and I will return to America to expand our ever growing roots in San Francisco and California.”"
