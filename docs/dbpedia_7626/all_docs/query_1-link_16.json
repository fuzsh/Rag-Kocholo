        "text": "This score shows how much progress pupils at this school made between the end of key stage 2 and the end of key stage 4, compared to pupils across England who got similar results at the end of key stage 2. This is based on results in up to 8 qualifications, which include English, maths, 3 English Baccalaureate qualifications including sciences, computer science, history, geography and languages, and 3 other additional approved qualifications.\n\nA score above zero means pupils made more progress, on average, than pupils across England who got similar results at the end of key stage 2.\n\nA score below zero means pupils made less progress, on average, than pupils across England who got similar results at the end of key stage 2.\n\nA negative progress score does not mean pupils made no progress, or the school has failed, rather it means pupils in the school made less progress than other pupils across England with similar results at the end of key stage 2.\n\nClose\n\nContains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\n\nThis is the percentage of pupils who achieved the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) at a grade 5 or above in English and maths, and at a grade C or above in the following subject areas: sciences, a language, and either history or geography.\n\nThe English Baccalaureate is not a test or qualification; it is a measure used to provide information about a particular range of qualifications. The grading of English and maths GCSEs changed in the 2017 GCSEs reforms.\n\nReformed GCSEs are graded 1 (low) to 9 (high). Grade 5 in the new grading is a similar level of achievement to a high grade C or low grade B in the old grading.\n\nClose\n\nContains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\n\nPerformance cookies\n\nPerformance cookies let us collect information about how the website is used.
