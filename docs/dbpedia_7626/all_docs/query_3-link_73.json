        "text": "My mate's mate used to live in this house, number 45 ! Assuming 1945 - 70 era ? His name is Colin Servante.\n\nHe still lives locally and appears to have a wealth of knowledge of the area.\n\nMy mate, (Colin Phillips), and Colin Servante both attended South Harringay Junior. Colin S remained in touch with a teacher, Amy Diprose, into her 90's. He has a pic of SHJ school and can name most.\n\nI will attempt to get a copy. A mentioned name was Colin Biford/Buford.\n\nHope this info instigates further conversation.\n\nAn aunty of Colin S lived top end of Fairfax (where prefabs were/are). She was killed when a V1hit her house.\n\nHe has a SHJ school pic and can name practically all. I will attempt to get a copy."
