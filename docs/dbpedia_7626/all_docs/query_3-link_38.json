        "text": "MARK EVANS could become Wales' answer to Sir Clive Woodward, according to one of the men who knows him best.\n\nFormer England skipper Tony Diprose has spent more than a decade playing under Evans for both Saracens and Harlequins.\n\nAnd he feels the 44-year-old contender to become Wales coach has much in common with English World Cup-winner Woodward.\n\n\"It is a step up to international level, but I can't see why Mark couldn't take that step,\" said Diprose.\n\n\"I think I could see the potential of him having a similar role to Clive Woodward at that level.\n\n\"I think he has some of the qualities that Clive has. He's very keen and clever on the business side, which is the background that Clive has as well.\n\n\"I could see Mark playing a similar role to the one Clive has with England in terms of getting a good coaching team around him. He could put that sort of structure in place.\"\n\nDiprose first came into contact with Evans - who is in a two-horse race for the Wales job along with Gareth Jenkins - when he joined Saracens from school in the early '90s.\n\nThe Essex-born, but Cardiff-raised, Evans was then assistant coach to Welshman John Davies and went on to become director of rugby at Vicarage Road.\n\nBut, following the arrival of Francois Pienaar as coach, Evans moved on to Harlequins in 2000 - and set about recruiting Lions back rower Diprose.\n\n\"I have got a huge amount of respect for Mark,\" said the 31-year-old Diprose.\n\n\"He has been one of the coaches that I have spent more time with over my career than anyone else.\n\n\"He is a good man manager, who does his best to look after players as much as he can.\n\n\"He is also very analytical and very knowledgeable about the game. He understands the game very well.\n\n\"They are the skills that put you forward as a coach.\n\n\"He's quite authoritative. You certainly know he is in charge.\n\n\"I've always responded to his urgings well.\n\n\"I am sure there are players that haven't found his ways to their liking, but I have always been inspired to work hard for him.\"\n\nAt Harlequins, Evans acts as both director of rugby and chief executive.\n\nHe has two coaches working under him in John Kingston and former Wales fly-half Paul Turner.\n\n\"Mark has a huge role at Quins at the moment,\" said Diprose.\n\n\"He runs the commercial side and he also overseas the coaching as well.\n\n\"He does rely on our assistant coaches, but does quite a bit on the coaching side himself.\"\n\nEvans grew up in Cardiff and attended Christ College, Brecon, before going on to Cambridge University.\n\n\"I know him as Welsh,\" said Diprose.\n\n\"He is quite proud of his Welsh roots.\"\n\nDuring his time with Harlequins, Evans has overseen a dramatic transformation in the fortunes of the London club.\n\nHe took the bold decision as chief executive to sack All Black legend Zinzan Brooke from his role as coach.\n\nSince then, the team's playing record has improved markedly.\n\nThey are through to the semi-finals of this season's Parker Pen Cup, lie fifth in the Zurich Premiership and are pushing for qualification for the Heineken Cup.\n\nQuins regularly play to sell-outs these days and there are plans for an £8m redevelopment of the Stoop.\n\nManaging director Tony Copsey - the former Welsh international second row - says Evans must take much of the credit for the club's healthy state.\n\n\"He has done a tremendous job as chief executive and coach,\" he said.\n\n\"Mark has overseen a tremendous change here. He has built a new team and it has been a wonderful journey.\n\n\"He is a very good coach and a bright and intelligent guy who sees the game from a business and rugby point of view.\""
