        "text": "A champion for paediatric cancer in Victoria\n\nAfter twenty years successfully championing the progress of paediatric oncology in Victoria, Tony McGinn OAM is retiring from his position as Director and Deputy Chairman of the Foundation.\n\nIn honour of his outstanding legacy of work, this special tribute from a collective of friends and family past and present, remembers Tony’s significant achievements.\n\nTony was a driving force behind KOALA Foundation, which was established by parents of children treated in the Children’s Cancer Centre at Monash Medical Centre.\n\nIn 2005, Tony and a committee inspired by him founded The Million Dollar Lunch and raised in excess of $1 million for the cause in a single afternoon. In the period from 2005 to 2014, Tony led The Million Dollar Lunch committee with boundless energy and creativity, raising in excess of $10 million in the process.\n\nIn 2012, Tony was instrumental in the merger of KOALA Foundation with the Children’s Cancer Centre Foundation, and became a director and deputy chairman of the merged entity, the Children’s Cancer Foundation.\n\nIn June this year, Tony retired as a director and deputy chairman of the Foundation.\n\nDuring Tony’s two decades of service, the Foundation and its predecessors have funded over $56m in programs for the benefit of children with cancer in clinical research, clinical care, clinical trials and family support. Many of those achievements were only possible because of Tony’s efforts, particularly through The Million Dollar Lunch, which is the most vivid expression of Tony’s legacy. However, Tony has not only been a formidable fundraiser. He has been an outstanding director and a fearless advocate for patients and their families.\n\nPlease join the Foundation in thanking Tony, Amanda, Ben and Nick for their remarkable legacy.”\n\nI was grateful to have someone on the team with a bold vision of what could be achieved while helping me achieve an inclusive group culture where everybody’s contribution was valuable. Tony was the driving force of a Monash Medical Centre sub-committee. Through persistence and appealing to the Victorian Government, a new Paediatric Day Oncology Centre was built and resourced. This improved the journey for patients and their families thereafter by providing more efficient service and minimising overnight stays in the hospital ward.\n\nTony and Amanda were incredibly supportive of my family when our son relapsed. Tony was, meanwhile, inaugurating the KOALA Foundation, which would ultimately set the bar very high for advocacy in the Paediatric Oncology sphere, with the trademarked Million Dollar Lunch.\n\nI have long admired Tony’s helicopter view of any situation and his ability to find solutions rather than problems or hindrances. It has been an absolute pleasure seeing Ben and Nick as adults with a great social conscience. Congratulations, Tony, on 20 years of dedication and inspiration.”\n\nWe hit lots of brick walls in our initial ideas before identifying an untapped niche in providing small but necessary things to help children on cancer wards – and Koala Kids was born.\n\nTony was our guiding light in the early days and we have every reason to thank him for helping us establish Koala Kids to become the force that it is today.\n\nTony is a gentle giant with a big personality, a huge heart and endless ideas that have helped us grow. Although our businesses parted ways in 2015 we still speak regularly and have grown a very special bond over the years.\n\nTony is a great conversationalist and listener. His passion for everything he does is commendable as is the way he used his family’s experience – Ben’s cancer – to inspire, create and grow something that has changed the face of paediatric cancer in Victoria.\n\nOn behalf of Koala Kids volunteers, Stephen, Nick, Daniella and myself, I warmly congratulate Tony on everything he and Children’s Cancer Foundation have achieved over the past nearly 20 years and know that many of the seeds he has sewn will impact families and cancer treatment for many years to come.”"
