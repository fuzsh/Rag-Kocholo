        "text": "Deborah Jones\n\nHeadteacher\n\nLucky for me I started my teaching career at Polegate school as an NQT and ten years later I am still here and love every day. When I am not at school I am with my ever growing family which includes 4 daughters, 3 grandchildren and a very stressed, bald husband! As if life wasn’t busy enough we decided to add two mischievous puppy pugs called Betty and Ralph, who never fail to make me smile, just like the children every day at Polegate school.\n\nHayley Giggs\n\nAssistant Head Teacher\n\nI started at Polegate as an NQT and nearly 13 years later here I am still! I have dropped to 3 days a week however so I can spend more time in the sandpit with my children. I love teaching but I also have a passion for travelling, trashy American TV and chocolate!\n\nJenny Rawlinson\n\nReception Teacher\n\nHello, I have been teaching for 6 years and I absolutely love what I do because every day is different. When I’m not at school I love going to the theatre. I like travelling and have visited lots of places around the world. My favourite places are ones with sunshine. When I’m not travelling I like spending time with my family and going for long walks with my dog.\n\nRachel Coleman\n\nYear 1 Teacher\n\nI am so thrilled that I have been able to begin my teaching career at Polegate School! I have such a huge passion for teaching and I believe that all learning should be active, fun and engaging.\n\nWhen I’m not at school you’ll often find me with my head in a good book, playing a variety of sports or enjoying time with my family and friends.\n\nAshleigh Liddell\n\nYear 1 Teacher\n\nHaving wanted to be a teacher for as long as I can remember, I was lucky enough to start my career at Polegate school as an ECT 2 years ago and I am still loving it! Polegate has such a rare, warm and supportive community from all teachers, parents and students, allowing everyone to thrive.\n\nWhen I'm not at school, you'll often find me binge watching gripping tv shows (like Eastenders... don't tell anyone!), painting my nails or eating out with friends.\n\nAmy Durbidge\n\nYear 2 Teacher, Year 1 & 2 Leader of Learning\n\nI was lucky enough to spend my final teaching placement as a student teacher at this wonderful school, so I am thrilled to be here! I I cannot wait to bring my excitement and love for literacy into the classroom! When I’m not in school I enjoy getting stuck into a good book or spending time with my family and our lovely golden retriever Dexter! I also love dancing, singing and performing in local shows.\n\nBethany Budd\n\nYear 2 Teacher\n\nMy name is Miss Budd and I have been a teacher since 2019. I have taught children in Early Years and Key Stage 1. I am passionate about ensuring that children have a positive start to their school life and feel so grateful to be a part of their learning journey.\n\nI love creating an inclusive, creative and engaging environment for children to learn in.\n\nSarah Barden\n\nYear 3 Teacher, Year 3 & 4 Leader of Learning\n\nI have had a fantastic first year at Polegate and I am still loving every minute of teaching! Working with such a great team of teachers and children makes it such a great place to work. Outside school, I don't give myself much time to rest as I am performing in shows as a dancer. When I do relax, I love spending time with my friends, travelling to new places and going to the theatre.\n\nErin Keith\n\nYear 5 Teacher\n\nHi everyone, my name is Miss Keith, and I'm thrilled to be joining you all this September! Fresh out of University of Brighton, I'm eager to put my studies into practice. I have spent a lot of time at Polegate covering different classes, so I already know what a fantastic school community this is! Outside of school, I am often curled up with a good book—I am on a mission to read more books than there are days this year—or running up and down a netball court. I am very passionate about learning in all areas of the curriculum and can’t wait to get started!\n\nPhoebe Kenny\n\nYear 5 Teacher\n\nSince a very early age, I knew that I wanted to be a teacher and the passion I felt at the start of my career is still very much alive even after over 15 years of teaching! The school's motto, \"Learning without Limits,\" perfectly captures my attitude towards teaching. It is all about assisting every child in realising their full potential while appreciating their unique abilities.\n\nWhen I am not busy teaching, I enjoy the benefits of living by the coast and taking walks along the beach or just unwinding with a good thriller! I like to keep busy and always have an art project on the go, painting, sewing, up cycling, I love it all!\n\nEmily Davies\n\nYear 5 Teacher\n\nHaving only recently began my teaching journey, I feel excited and proud to become a part of a fantastic school and team where the children are at the heart of everything we do. I love how every new day is different - the children never fail to put a smile on my face! I thoroughly enjoy spreading my love of learning with the children and I always seem to be WOWED by facts and stories they have to share with me! I simply couldn’t imagine myself being in any other career!\n\nWhen I’m not at school, I love to spend time with my family and friends, sing my heart out to a musical or watch Harry Potter and Disney films on repeat!\n\nRuby Murphy\n\nYear 6 Teacher\n\nI have worked at Polegate since 2010 and love teaching here! I find it incredibly rewarding and genuinely enjoy spending each day with our fantastic pupils.\n\nOutside of school, I can often be found upside down (literally!) doing trapeze and aerial hoop. I also enjoy photography, spending time with my nose in a good book, filling my home with too many houseplants, and exploring the great outdoors.\n\nEmma Murphy\n\nYear 6 Teacher\n\nI have been teaching at Polegate School since I started my teaching career, over 20 years ago and can honestly say there is nowhere I’d rather teach. I have always wanted to teach and am still enjoying it as much as when I first started. Every year is different, with new challenges and new children to champion.\n\nOutside of school I enjoy spending time with my family. We have many hobbies that we enjoy together including building Lego and going to watch the women's football: we have season tickets for Brighton and love to go along and support them when they play. When I get a rare moment quiet time to myself, I love to read a book, watch a film or complete a craft project.\n\nBecky Chadwick\n\nMaths Magic Intervention Teacher\n\nI have been a teacher at Polegate School since I first qualified, it is such a special place to work that I have never wanted to go anywhere else! My current role involves supporting children with their mathematics learning on a 1 to 1 basis. I get to see the children I work with make huge improvements in both their confidence and understanding which is incredibly rewarding.\n\nWhen not at work I can often be found walking on the downs with my husband, three children and my dog.\n\nGrace Kavanagh\n\nIntervention Teacher\n\nI love being a teacher and working with a classroom of lively and happy children. Every day is different, with its unique mix of laughs and challenges and this is something that makes me love the career I'm in. When I'm not working, I love spending time with my family and friends, going for long walks or getting stuck into an arty, creative project. I also love to go to the theatre and travel to new places. My all time favourite has to be Italy there is so much still to explore and I can't wait!\n\nSharon Trent\n\nNursery Teacher & EYFS Leader of Learning\n\nI feel very privileged to have worked in early years for over twelve years. I love having a boogie, exploring outside, duvet days with my scrummy family and celebrating the small things. I also like getting creative in the kitchen albeit with playdough!\n\nHannah Gudgeon\n\nForest School Leader\n\nIt was through the COVID-19 lockdowns that I realised how much I enjoyed being a part of my children’s education. Once my children returned to school, I felt it was time for a career change and have been fortunate to train as a teaching assistant.\n\nFor fun I enjoy paddle water sports, watching air shows and taking my dog out on long walks in the county.\n\nAnna Russell\n\nSENCO Assistant\n\nEver since I graduated university, I have worked in schools in so many different capacities. I think I have taught almost every age range from 6 weeks old up to 18 years old! Working at Polegate as a SENCO Assistant is fantastic, every day feels exciting and I find I am always learning something new. I always look forward to the unusual and interesting conversations that children are so good at, for example: \"why doesn't a rainbow cover the entire sky?\" or \"Different oils have different densities which cause them to float or sink in water, but will they still float or sink the same way in different liquids?\" or \"would you rather have chicken feet as hands or chicken feet as legs?\"... and so on!\n\nIn my free time I love playing board games with my friends, going on nature walks and foraging, reading a cozy crime novel, or having a fun party with my many family members.\n\nAmy Regan\n\nTeacher\n\nI have been at Polegate School since 2012 and have thoroughly enjoyed working here. I am the maths subject leader across the school and am currently working really hard to work with other schools to improve their maths teaching. It's such a joy to work at a school who are so passionate about maths!\n\nWhen I'm not at work you will find me exhausted on the sofa watching a good series! During the weekends you will find me at the cinema, shopping, going for long walks or a weekend away exploring new cities in our motorhome.\n\nMia Hopkinson\n\nReception Teacher\n\nI have been working with young children since 2015. I have taught KS1 in a couple of local schools as well as across the pond in sunny California. Being a child’s first teacher is a real privilege. There is never a dull day in a Polegate reception classroom - it is a great and exciting place to work.\n\nWhen I am not at school, I am likely spending time with my family, enjoying long country walks, and being outdoors, especially in the summer months. My family is due to expand this Spring, as I'm expecting a new baby in April. Life will certainly be busy!"
