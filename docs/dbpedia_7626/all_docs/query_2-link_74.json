        "text": "The Language of the Day today is Japanese. At assembly this morning Lucas Haas da Silva read the Lordâ€™s Prayer in Japanese and Junhee Cho and John Garrovillo presented about Japanese culture. This was followed by a Japanese Karaoke performance from Junhee, John, Saem Millward and Gray Lourie, before international student from Japan Yuma Shimizu spoke about his experiences and Japanese culture.\n\nYear 11 student Jonty Williamson has recently returned from three weeks in Canada where he was accepted to race in the Canadian Open and the Canada Cup Mountain Bike events. After coming down with illness Jonty was not 100% when he raced the first event but managed a very good seventh place in the Crankworx DH event, then a second in the Crankworx Dual Slalom (was in line for first until the last turn where he fell) and fifth place in the Air DH. The highlight was the final Downhill race where Jonty won the Canada Cup event in the UCI U17 Expert Men. Well done to Jonty for these fantastic results against very strong competition.\n\nThank you to World Vision Youth Ambassador Nora who joined us today to present a certificate recognising 30 years of support for the 40 Hour Famine. Thank you to Prefect Leo Mwape who accepted the award on behalf of the school."
