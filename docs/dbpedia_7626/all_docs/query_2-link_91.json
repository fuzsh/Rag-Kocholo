        "text": "Harlequins winger Ugo Monye has put pen to paper on a new three-year deal with the Aviva Premiership club.\n\nThe 28-year-old England international, who has slipped out of the Test reckoning since winning his last cap during the 2010 Six Nations, has racked up 169 appearances and 73 tries for Quins over the last ten years having joined them from school. The former England 7s star, who also toured with the British & Irish Lions in 2009, has notched three tries this term during Quins' 14-game unbeaten run since the start of the campaign.\n\n\"I have so many wonderful memories here at Quins, but what I think I am most proud about is the way the club has bounced back from adversity - bloodgate and relegation; both of these negatives have seen us become stronger,\" said Monye. \"Of course, reaching the semi-finals of the Premiership in 2009 and, more recently, the win against Munster and Stade Francais in the Amlin Challenge Cup, are moments I will treasure, along with making my debut for England and the Lions. I am so proud to be a part of this club, and I am looking forward to extending my time here by at least another three years.\"\n\nQuins boss Conor O'Shea was delighted to re-sign the winger and has backed him for further international honours. \"Ugo is a one club man and that is a rarity in modern day rugby, but he is also an example of what we want to have here at the club,\" he said. \"He was frustrated to miss out on the RWC and then to pick up the injury that has kept him out for a number of weeks after starting the season so strongly. We know in Ugo we have a player who has got an X factor, with and without the ball, that any team would want.\n\n\"By signing this contract he is not only committing to us and what he believes we can achieve in the coming years, he is also setting his stall out to be part of the RWC squad in 2015. We are delighted, as I am sure every single supporter of Harlequins will be with this news.\"\n\nMonye is also excited about the foundation that have been put in place at Quins both on and off the field. \"It has been fantastic to have been a witness to all the changes that have taken place at the club over the last 10 years,\" he said. \"Colin Osborne and Tony Diprose have created an academy that has produced a number of the current first team squad and, I am sure, many more English Internationals in the future. The stadium and fan base has grown, and the success of the Big Game has shown Quins to be at the forefront of the development of rugby in this country. We are a forward thinking club and that is another reason why I want to be here.\n\n\"Being at Harlequins is not all about the playing; it becomes a part of your life. We are a tight-knit bunch of lads, who all love playing for each other. With so many English qualified players within the squad, we all have a common goal - playing for Quins and our country.\""
