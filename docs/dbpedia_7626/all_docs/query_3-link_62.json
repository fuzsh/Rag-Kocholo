        "text": "LIFE and sport are rarely fair – that's why we cheer the underdog – and in schools rugby terms the underdog with the sharpest bite and loudest bark has often been Campion School, Hornchurch.\n\nTo this day Campion are the only genuinely state school to win the Daily Mail Cup U18 and for many years they overcame overwhelming odds to become a powerhouse team in that tournament. Quite remarkable considering the school wasn't even founded until 1962.\n\nWithout question the godfather of Campion Rugby was John Davies, an ebullient bundle of Welsh energy who learned his rugby at UWIC and honed his craft with the London Welsh team of the late 60s and 70s where ‘total rugby' was the name of the game.\n\nDavies joined the school as a biology and PE master in 1969 and although the first headmaster– Father Michael Fox – had immediately decreed that rugby not football would be the chosen sport, the school had yet to make a significant impact.\n\nDavies began to change that and then came a seminal moment that has gone down in school folklore. Campion were leading against a highly rated public school when a visiting parent/fan shouted “C'mon xxxxx, they are only a bloody comprehensive school.”\n\nOn the touchline the Campion head master Philip ‘Killer' Moloney went blue with rage and after the final whistle pulled Davies aside. Whatever it took to become a major force in schools rugby, Davies would have his full backing. Moloney was not going to have Campion's name insulted like that again. Ever.\n\n“Looking back I would like to thank that loud-mouthed parent on the touchline,” recalls Davies nearly 50 years on. “I won't mention the school because it's a long time ago and neither their players nor coaches were to blame but that provided the spur and determination.\n\n“Everybody bought in, not just the pupils and PE staff but all the staff who supported us, helped with our many fundraising efforts, covered for us if we were away, hosted visiting schools and, of course, the parents who were fantastic. That touchline comment lit the touchpaper.\n\n“Campion is a lovely mix – east London but with a large dash of Irish Catholic from the many Irish families who came over to work at the huge Ford works in Dagenham. I would summarise the rugby teams I worked with as ‘lads on the edge' – ambitious and nobody's fools. On the edge of achieving great things.”\n\nCampion's stock rose steadily throughout the 70s and 80s – they were invited to play the touring Australian Schools side in 1985 and lost only 13-0 – and that first tranche of excellence reached a peak in the late 80s with the emergence of Tony Diprose, Daren O'Leary, John Green and Dan Dooley. Earlier there had been future Scotland lock Damian Cronin, while to come were the likes of Danny Zaltzman, Kevin Sorrell, John Rudd, Jon Skurr and Matt Garvey. Their crowning achievement was their Daily Mail trophy in 2001 – more of which anon.\n\nDavies also instituted a notable touring tradition. They started with modest trips to Wales and Pau in the 70s, but by the 80s Davies had instituted a major tour every three years which in modern times has been updated to every two years.\n\n“The tours were wonderful and over the years well over 600 pupils and staff have participated in a major tour to some far-flung corner of the globe. That is a mighty legacy the school can look back on with great pride. The friends and contacts you make around the world is incredible.\n\n“My favourite memory comes from one year when we reciprocated the hospitality against one of the Maori teams. We were hosting, they beat us in a pretty ferocious game but afterwards, after the meal, we gathered around the big Christmas tree at the school and they sang for an hour. We had some pretty good singers and musicians ourselves, we were a singing team, and they replied in kind. Magical, one of the best rugby experiences of mylife.\n\n“I coached the First XV for twenty or so years and then became a senior master which had a lot of extra responsibilities and I was getting very involved coaching Saracens so I stepped back. I still helped out down the school but we were blessed with a fantastic array of young coaches – Keith Williams, Chris Jones, Michael Marmion, Michael McDarby, Philip Friel, Bob Mansell and others who didn't just maintain standards but drove them forward. They totally ‘got' the Campion ethos – some were former pupils – and added massively to it.”\n\nFor ten years or so from 1995 Campion went toe to toe with the biggest and most exclusive rugby schools in the country, a remarkable achievement for a state school, who couldn't bolster weaker years by offering scholarships to rugby-playing students.\n\nIn 1995 they lost 15-12 to QEGS Wakefield in the semi-finals while in 1997 they lost 25-15 to an outstanding Kirkham GS side that featured the two Sanderson brothers in the back row. The following year Campion reached the quarterfinals where they lost to RGS High Wycombe.\n\nOnwards and upwards. In 2000 they mounted another strong campaign before losing to St Peter's Gloucester in the semi-finals but then, in 2001, came Campion's crowning glory when they became the first state school to win the main U18 event.\n\nAfter a testing summer tour to Australia and New Zealand, Campion rolled into the domestic season full of confidence and fitness and in the early stages of the Daily Mail they marched past St Olave's, Colfe's and Bishop Stortford HS before really announcing their credentials with an impressive 27-5 win over Whitgift.\n\nNext came back-to-back thrillers as a Twickenham final hoved into view. They beat St Peter's Gloucester 23-22 in the quarter-finals and then overcame a 13-0 half time deficit against RGS Newcastle to win 17-16 and book a place against Durham in the final at Twickenham.\n\nAfter the drama of those two nail-biters it was relatively straight forward if hard fought against Durham with tries from hooker Dan Vincent and wing Adrian Lunan with flyhalf Michael Whitehead adding a conversion, dropped goal and penalty. Campion were home and hosed 18-0.\n\nIn 2002 they reached the final again, this time to lose out to a very fine Oakham side 28-23 in one of the great final showdowns and 12 months later they again fell to the Rutland School, this time 19-13 in the semi-final. Along the way that year they scored a satisfying quarter-final triumph over RGS High Wycombe with whom another keen rivalry had developed.\n\nIn 2004 Campion again reached the last four, this time losing 17-12 to Barnard Castle and the following year it was St Peter's who got the better of them in the quarter-finals. Still Campion kept pressing, but in the following two seasons their campaigns ended in round six, losing to St Benedict's Ealing in 2006 and KCS Wimbledon in 2007.\n\nAt the time their presence at the sharp end of this national competition seemed inevitable – almost routine – and it was easy to take Campion's flourishing at the top table for granted, but with the passing of time and the increased dominance of private schools we need to revisit that. Their sustained excellence, given the constraints they worked under, was in fact quite astonishing."
