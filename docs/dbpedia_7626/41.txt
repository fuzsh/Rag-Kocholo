Our unique rating system takes into account a range of different indicators to evaluate a school's performance. The system tracks achievement, attendance, teaching, how well the school is preparing pupils for the future and whether it is improving.

Data may be missing for some indicators because it has not been published. This may be because the school is new or because it is very small so data has been suppressed to avoid identifying individual pupils. Schools do not lose points for missing data, so will still fare better in the ranking than schools that underperform on that indicator, but they cannot score as highly as schools that perform well on the indicator.

Schools that have opened in recent years and are yet to have pupils sit GCSEs are flagged as NEW, and are not scored on any of the indicators.

Attainment

How have pupils at The Campion School done in their GCSEs and how does it compare to Local Authority and national averages?

The government introduced the Attainment 8 measure in 2016 (although some schools chose to opt in a year earlier). It measures pupil performance across maths, which is double weighted in the score, English, also double weighted, three qualifications included in the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and three other approved qualifications (GCSE or equivalent).

The higher the average score the better pupils at the school are doing.

The majority of GCSEs are now graded on a system of 9-1 grades, where 5 is a strong pass, equivalent to a high C and 4 is a standard pass, where the bottom of the boundary aligns with the bottom of a previous grade C.

The change was introduced in 2017 for English and maths with other subjects changing in 2018 or 2019.

In 2018 the average Attainment 8 score per pupil at The Campion School was 57.9.

Group School LA National All pupils 57.9 46.9 46.4 Girls NA 48.9 49.3 Boys 57.9 45 43.8 Disadvantaged 53.3 36.8 36.7 Low attainment SUPP 21.2 22.6 Middle attainment 47.9 40.6 40.8 High attainment 66.4 59.9 61.1 English as an additional language 60.8 49.3 47.2

The EBacc was introduced in 2010 and the government announced in 2015 its intention that all pupils should take it from 2020 onwards. The Ebacc is made up of English, Maths, History or Geography, Sciences, and a language. To achieve it, pupils must get a 9 to 4 grade in English and Maths and a C grade or above in the other subjects.

In 2018, 64% of pupils at The Campion School had entries in all EBacc subject areas and 46% achieved the EBacc, with a standard pass in English and Maths, while 30% achieved it with a strong pass in those subjects.

What proportion of different groups at the school also passed the EBacc with standard passes.

In 2017, the most recent results available, 85% of pupils at The Campion School gained at least 5 A* to C or 9-4 grade GCSES including English and Maths at 9 to 4. Nationally 60.1% of pupils achieved this.

How does The Campion School do when it comes to GCSE results in just English and Maths and what percentage of pupils pass those at A* to C or 9 to 4 grades?

And what proportion of pupils achieved strong (grades 9 to 5) passes in both English and maths?

Progress

The Progress 8 measure was also introduced by the Government in 2016. It is calculated for each pupil by comparing their Attainment 8 score to the scores of all pupils nationally with similar prior achievement at the end of primary school. The school's Progress 8 score is the average of all those scores.

A score of 0 means pupils have made similar progress during secondary school to similar pupils across England. Above 0 means more progress and below 0 means less progress. Below 0 doesn't mean pupils have made no progress or negative progress, just less progress than comparable pupils.
