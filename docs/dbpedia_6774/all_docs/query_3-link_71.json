        "meta_description": "The introduction explores the emergence of modern understandings of time in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As historians such as Reinhart Koselleck and François Hartog have established, past and future were seen, respectively, as increasingly distant and ceaselessly new. This had particular resonance in France, where the Revolution of 1789 had created a colossal sense of rupture, forcing the country abruptly into the future. The period of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—the focus of this book—saw a further reconfiguration of time. In philosophy, physics, travel, and art, time seemed to accelerate as well as being in flux. These changes all provided important inspiration for the characters of this study, as questions about time shaped the pressing political questions of the day, from the nature of the French nation to the possibilities of revolution and social change. Some thinkers sought to accentuate the rupture of 1789, while others wanted to retie the broken thread of time. The introduction goes on to discuss the burgeoning literature surrounding temporality, foregrounding the importance of social science literature in time studies and its role in shaping the historiographical boom we are witnessing in the field. This study contributes to this literature by pursing a critique of modernity as a monolithic category, as well as by offering a model for how to study the importance of time in politics. The introduction ends with a discussion of the structure of the book and the source material at its heart.",
