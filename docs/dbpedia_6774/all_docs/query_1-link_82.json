        "text": "This is not a not a political manifesto, it's written in black and white. Indeed, the most \"political\" pages of President Emmanuel Macron's former prime minister, Edouard Philippe's new book, Des Lieux Qui Disent, (\"Places That Speak\"), published on September 13, remain at a level of generality designed to encourage long-term reflection rather than immediate action. The work appears as a springboard laid down by a man seeking to consolidate his foundations. After Des Hommes Qui Lisent (\"Men Who Read,\" 2017), in which he evoked the books that shaped him, Philippe now focuses on some of the places that shaped his character and ideas, weaving together personal memories, literary references and political reflections.\n\nThe public school he attended in Rouen, Normandy, gave him the opportunity to retrace the career of his parents, both teachers, to invoke Charles Péguy and Albert Camus, and to condemn the \"idiotic attacks\" of those who describe teachers as \"privileged.\" The Palais-Royal gave him the opportunity to look back on his early days as a lawyer at the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court, quoting Molière and Badinter – a lawyer and left-wing politician who led the fight against the death penalty in France – while dismissing the \"clichés of judicial populism.\" The Monastère de la Verne, nestled in the heart of the Massif des Maures, South of France, prompted him to share his fascination for the sacred and to condemn \"Zemmourian delusions about the purity of the nation.\" The port of Le Havre, a northern industrial city of which he is the mayor, inspired heartfelt pages devoted to the working-class and trade union culture in which part of his family is rooted. It all adds up to an intimate portrait of a right-winger from the left, who intends to reinvent a kind of \"rooted modernism.\"\n\nIn your book, you quote many writers, but also quite a few essayists. We remember a time, not so long ago, when politicians were careful not to appear as intellectuals, for fear of being accused of being out of touch with 'the people' or 'reality...' Aren't you afraid of that?\n\nI don't care. We are what we are. I read books, which perhaps puts me on the intellectual side. I also love sports, and I swear like a sailor when I watch a football match. And there's nothing I love more than going out for beers with friends... So, I can't really answer the general part of your question. As far as I'm concerned, I've always loved books, I was brought up in the cult of books, you are what you are."
