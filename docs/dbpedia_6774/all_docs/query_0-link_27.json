        "text": "Here is one of the books that provoked the criticisms of Jean Norton Cru. Little known author before 1914, it is with his memories collected as a Doctor in the french Army during the Great War that the literary career of Jean Duhamel began. Author thereafter of very famous books, and still widely studied in the colleges (Le Notaire du Havre  (\"The Notary of Le Havre\"), part of the multi-volume novel \"Les Pasquier\"). Its 3 books La Vie des martyrs (\"Life of the Martyrs \") - (1917), Civilisation (\"Civilization\") - (1918), and Les 7 Dernières Plaies (\"7 Last Wounds\") - (1928), are gathering very stylised portraits of wounded soldiers or members of the medical profession in the army. The great mastery of the french language makes it possible to easily achieve the goal of these works that are made to inspire pity. Read those phrases for yourself, and listen to you, all alone, distress guaranteed ...\n\nIf Mac Orlan was to be famous after the war, being among other titles the author of the classical Quai des Brumes (\"Fogs Quay\"), who inspired one of traditional French cinema the 1930s years, his war memories Propos dInfanterie (\"Matter of Infantry \") - (1917), Les Poissons Morts (\" Dead Fishes\") - (1917), Dans les Tranchées (\"In the Trenches\") - (1939) interest our theme. Only but excusable shadow on that screen, he declares to suffer from an amnesia for the scenes of combat, that are then missing in the stories. HIs feelings when returning to Verdun after the war, noted in \"Verdun\" (1934) are among the most moving on the pilgrimage, and most known..... Here is both an original and bold idea, making a parallel, a 'Parabole' (\"Parabola\") (with the literary direction of the term) between the last hours of Jesus Christ surrounded by her apostles then his resurrection, and a escouade of 12 French soldiers isolated by the last German offensive from 1918 in top from a hill, around a corporal. Successful stylistic exercise by William Faulkner ! Young doctor, Louis-Ferdinand Céline enrolled as a volunteer in the infantry. Noticed for his heroism in 1915, he then was wounded and disabled. It is its deep disgust for the war that he expresses in his novel Voyage au Bout de la Nuit (\"Journey at the End of the Night\") whose first chapters are a slightly disguised writing of his own war memories. From revolt to despair, this book is a violent shout. Celine also wrote the splendid the Mort à Crédit (\"Dead with Credit\"), before sympathizing with the Vichy regime during 40/45 war, which will bring him to a collaboration trial in 1950, A 'special item', this Blaise Cendrars ! Swiss citizen, enrolled for the duration of the war in the Foreign Legion, his book La Main Coupée (\"the Cut Hand\") - (1946) abounds in strange characters and colored memories. Only little problem, the veracity of some of his memories was doubted, its unit not having taken part in some of the reported battles. But his amputated arm, following a serious wound received in Champagne, near the Navarin farm on September 25, 1915, is quite real, and his style is so modern... Cendrars the adventurer will also tell a little of his war in LHomme Foudroyé (\"The Blasted Man\") - (1945), and in a poem Jai Tué (\"I Killed\"), before being successful with his other more exotic books... Thanks to his mastery of the English language, André Maurois obtained a role of french liaison officer near the British Army. His two works, often joined together in only one volume, Les Silences du Colonel Bramble (\"The Silences of the Colonel Bramble\") - (1918), and Les Discours du Colonel OGrady (\"The Speeches of Colonel O' Grady\") - (1922) are interesting for the humorous picture that they draw of the shock of the French and English cultures during the conflict. Of course, these are only headquarters witnesses, but the derision spirit is finally rather British ! Very famous french philosopher for his very many Propos (\"Remarks\"), Alain was initially a telephone operator in a heavy artillery unit. He drew from this experience matter to develop the nonsense of the war, in his philosophical work Mars, ou la Guerre Jugée (\"Mars, or the War on Trial) - (1921) mainly written during the conflict. His war memories are consigned in a much more accessible way in his Mémoires de Guerre (\"Memories of the war\") - (1933). In those lines, his experience of Verdun seen by heavy artillery troops has a rather original value of witness. I wish plenty of courage to anyone who would like to read of this monumental work entitled La Roue Rouge (\"The Red Wheel\") reporting in tiny details the Russian revolution in 1917. Soljenitsyne did not know the WWI, but he knows how much this conflict has been at the base of the major transformations of his country, Russia. Despite all that, the first volume of this monument, \"August 14\", delivers a faithful and seizing version of the combats of the beginning of the war in Eastern Prussia, where the weapons fate hesitated a long time before offering the German victory at Tannenberg. \"A Farewell to Arms\", by Ernest Hemingway, is a highgly autobiographical novel of this future best-seller author (who never heard of the famous \"The Old Man and the Sea\"?), American volunteer as stretcher-bearer on the front of Italy. The scenes of panic of the italian retreat in 1915 are memorable, and help to forgive the melodramatic end which seemed to me so unnecessarily sad when, as a kid, I saw the Hollywood film which was derived from this book and cried... Romain Rolland inaugurated before the war the fashion of the saga novel with his 10 volumes of \"Jean-Christophe\". Too old to be mobilised in 1914, he wrote from Switzerland a series of articles under the generic title Au-Dessus de la Mèlée (\"Above the Fray\") deploring that the two people of the same civilisation could sink this latter in the catastrophe. These beautiful pages were granted by the Nobel Prize of Literature 1916... and the offended incomprehension of the two belligerent sides ! Unforgettable french author of the Trilogy \"Marius\", \"Fanny\" and \"César\", of Manon des Sources (\"Manon from the Springs\"), La Gloire de mon Père (\"My Fathers Glory\")..., Marcel Pagnol began his literary career by less known oeuvres, among which this part 'Marchands de Gloire' (\"Merchants of Glory\") where he denounces those people exploiting after war the memory of dead soldiers on the fields of glory. Roger Martin du Gard is another of the great names of the novel sagas. In his monumental work of 8 volumes, \"Thibault\", he develops the destinies of the members of a family, telling with much talent the family upheavals brought by the conflict, and in particular the martyrdom of the soldiers wounded by the gas."
