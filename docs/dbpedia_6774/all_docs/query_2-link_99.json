        "meta_description": "Originally known as Bibliothèque royale (Royal Library), then as Bibliothèque de la Nation (Library of the Nation) and Bibliothèque nationale (National Library), the Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France) (BnF), thus named since 1994, is today the national library of the French Republic.\nIts history began with King Charles V (1338-1380) when, in 1368, he installed his collection of books in a properly equipped room in the Louvre, which, a year later, housed over 900 volumes.\nKing François I (1494–1547) introduced new instructions for organising the Library on December 28, 1537. He supported the idea that printers and booksellers should deposit all printed books put on sale in the kingdom at the Castle of Blois. This obligation, now called legal deposit, was a fundamental step for the royal library.\nIn 1666, new developments took place. Colbert (1619-1683) had the ambition of making the library an instrument for the glory of King Louis XIV (1638-1715). It was then installed in the Vivienne district, and a new policy for expanding the collections was implemented. In a short time, the number of manuscripts doubled, and the number of printed books quadrupled.\nAbbé Bignon (1662-1743), appointed librarian in 1719, gave the library an unprecedented splendour, organising it into departments: Printing Books, Manuscripts, Medals and Engraved Stones, Engraved Plates and Collections of Prints, Titles and Genealogies. Bignon also continued the work of his predecessors in the acquisition of documents.\nThe French Revolution had a profound impact on the library. The legal deposit was abolished in July 1790, but three years later, it was re-established on a voluntary basis by the law of July 19, 1793, and fully restored in 1810. During this period, the library considerably increased its holdings with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of confiscated or seized documents.\nIn 1858, a commission led by Prosper Mérimée (1803-1870) wrote a report on specific changes to be introduced in terms of the organisation of the library. Napoléon III (1808-1873) then entrusted the architect Henri Labrouste (1801-1875) with reconstructing part of the buildings. In 1874, Léopold Delisle (1826-1910) was appointed general administrator and launched the creation of the &quot;Catalogue général des livres imprimés&quot; (General catalogue of printed books), the first volume of which was published in 1897 and the last one in 1981.\nIn the 20th century, the library continued to evolve. Reading rooms increased from six to eleven between 1930 and 1964. At the same time, three annexes were built in Versailles in 1934, 1954, and 1971, one in Sablé in 1980 and another in Provins in 1981. However, these extensions did not solve the storage problems caused by increased printed production.\nThe arrival of more and more massive collections and new media posed new conservation problems, and the number of places offered to readers needed to be increased. Despite the efforts to modernise and computerise the library during the 1980s, it faced hurdles in adapting to the new conditions of printed production and reading demand. \nGiven these challenges, the construction of a new library was announced in 1988 by President François Mitterrand (1916-1996). The site chosen for the building was located on the banks of the Seine in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. In August 1989, architect Dominique Perrault&#039;s project was selected. On December 20, 1996, the study library opened, and on October 8, 1998, the opening of the research library sealed the completion of this prominent project.",
