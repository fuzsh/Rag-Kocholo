        "text": "In the argument proposed in this dissertation, I undertake to explain Foucault's new historiography as it is developed in contrast to continuous history and its entire panoply of concepts, and to the founding role of consciousness therein. After elucidating the indispensable entanglement of the new history and the traditional one, I propose that Foucault's new history cannot sever itself entirely from the traditional one, standing on its own feet. As a preliminary stage and the underlying philosophical stance for Foucault's history, I articulate his distinctive theory of truth as inherited from Nietzsche and developed to construct a theory of discourse emancipated from the reign of reason or the logic of sense. Foucault's history can be best illuminated in comparison to the hermeneutical approach to discourse and interpretation and in relation to the founding role of consciousness, which is entailed as a constituent part of the clarification of Foucault's new history, its nature and its entanglement with the traditional history. Dissertation Overview What aims does history serve and how it is to achieve them? Traditional History, as Foucault incisively explains, attains its aims through continuous accounts. It is meant thereby to retrieve the past dimension of consciousness. As he puts it:\n\nAs the immediate precursor to poststructuralism, the movement or paradigm of structuralism was naturally responsible for determining many of poststructuralism’s salient features. But what was structuralism, and how are we to understand its transformation into poststructuralism? In this chapter I will address these issues by first outlining the contours of what might be called the image of structuralism. An appreciation of this image is necessary for a full understanding of the shift from structuralism to poststructuralism. Nevertheless, an acknowledgement of its limitations, of the inconsistencies it suppresses and the inaccuracies it perpetrates, is equally necessary. As I will therefore demonstrate, alongside the formation and propagation of the classical structuralist image runs a history of its transformation – a history of those aspects and individuals who subverted the image of structuralism in one way or other, as it was in the process of emerging."
