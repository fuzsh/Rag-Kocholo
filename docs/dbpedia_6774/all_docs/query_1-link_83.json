Here, with the almost startling original vision of a Christian thinker, he views the modern world, approaching such problems as the Spanish War, Money, the Stupid, Fascism, and the Church, stiictly in terms of his belief. His conclusions may well astonish the more orthodox, but to those who can see, they will seem the expression of as yet unformulated truth, profoundly inspired. K ‘This book is the testimony of a flee man,’ the author writes— and it will be difficult foi most readeis not to feSl that they have been shown the world as never before. His voice has notes of the deepest wrath, because his anger is the effervescence of his compassion. Bernanos happened to be in Spain in the early days of the Civil War, and viewed as flesh and blood the ideals and passions which had provoked it. It inspired him to thoughts on the nature of Christian civilization which spring from the very deepest human emotion, unlike anything else we have as yet seen expressed on this and all the subjects to which it gives rise. The many themes of this remark- able book are correlated by deep and wide Inspiration, re-stating the social order in terms of its natural limitations, and finding the ideal to be— Christianity. A DIARY OF MY TIMES BY THE SAME WRITER The Diary of a Country Priest GEORGES BERNANOS A DIARY OF MY TIMES Translated from the French by PAMELA MORRIS BORTSWOOD: LONDON Printed in Guernsey, C.I., British Isles by the Star and Gazette Ltd., for boriswood limited, 59 Frith Street, Soho Square, London, W.i. First published September 1938 Dtti’Ufi !'fth Municipal Library, N-ini Tal, srirVrrra - f.v .,•« w#, LES GRANDS CIMETIERES SOUS LA LUNE [PARIS 1938] A DIARY OF MY TIMES [LONDON I938] PREFACE by the Author Being a reply to an article by the Rev. Father du Passage, S. J., headed ‘A Nightmare in Majorca’. Father du Passage has been kind enough to criticize my book, as I think unjustly. May I add that when. I say ‘unjustly 1 , the word does not mean ‘inoppor- tunely 1 , as so often seems to be the case. ‘A nightmare in Majorca ! 1 Why nightmare? I didn’t dream anything. I said what I knew. I do not say everything that I know. Therefore I had better not be challenged, for some witnesses are irrefutable. I am in no way out to create a scandal. But when so many Catholics try to excuse, or even justify, one of the most atrocious civil wars that has ever been known, in the name of a ‘Lesser-Evil 1 policy, it is not much to ask that a denunciation of cowards and rogues should be treated with the same indulgence. My reaction may have sounded violent, but at least it may have some chance of being effective against the kind of dishonourable re-shuffling of which we have now seen an example in Austria. Obviously it can always be said that mystic zeal for an anti-Russian crusade, daily being more cyni- cally exploited by nationalist egotism everywhere, will end by summoning back to Christianity the nations of Europe. Recent experience in Berlin and Vienna hardly confirms this point of view. So far, the totali- tarian state seems to have been fairly indifferent to 7 the blessings of a Coronation service, and is unlikely to be so easily dethronable as the ancient kings in their own right. Once more I repeat that the population of Majorca contained scarcely any Communists. During the months before the Pronunciamento, not a single attempt had been made either against persons or property in the whole island, so that the massacres which I de- nounce cannot have had the character of reprisals. Though I did not actually see what happened in districts invaded by the Moors, the Rercio, or the Fascist Legions — and so did not write about it, in spite of all the bad examples given me by the incense-swing- ing partisans of Right and Left — I am not quite simple enough to believe that those repressions were any milder. It would be either foolish or rather im- pudent at present to be in the least surprised at the reserve with which such facts are being treated, by numbers of orthodox witnesses. The traditional moral theology of the Society of Jesus is too indulgent and too humane to wish to insist that any publicist on either side should bear open witness which would automatically exclude him from the columns of all his party’s newspapers. What do you take me for? It was not so much the actual killings in Majorca which disgusted me, as the fact that they were publicly approved by the great majority of secular priests, monks and nuns on that unhappy island. It is, of course, admirable that a priest should assist those condemned to death. I merely suggest that, even with common criminals a prison chaplain is usually bound by a certain reserve. He would, for instance, consider it improper to display himself before the victim, or that victim’s family and friends, arm-in- arm with the prosecuting counsel, or the executioner. R A question of tact. And since in any case in Palma the proportion of 'Reds’ put to death with all due ceremony was as one against twenty or thirty mown down along the road-side by official killers, it seems to me His Lordship the Archbishop of Majorca might logically have extended his solicitude to these as well. Do not suspect me of believing in angelic inter- vention. It is for theologians to decide whether or not there is such a thing as a Holy war, a war for Holi- ness. But if circumstances ever impose it upon us, it will not have to be fought by theologians. It will be fought by us, or by our children. We have there- fore the right at least to hope that it will be fought according to the rules of human decency and honour. The Basque Catholics have not been forgiven for offering, in 1936, their adherence to a government which had in its ranks a number of assassins. People remain blind to the fact that revolt suddenly deprived the Republican authorities of the help of the army and police, of the necessary forces of repression. Therefore they could do nothing against the mob. And anyhow, the problem for the conscience of the crusading soldier was made even simpler. He could not — without hypocrisy — disapprove of that bloody and official repression which is one of the aspects of Holy war. The military government of Majorca always re- mained in close relationship with General Franco. I can even affirm that in February 1937, at the time when the rhythm of preventative executions was slowing down, this Chief Crusader wrote to a subord- inate: ‘Have you all gone to sleep in Palma, or what?’ 9 General Franco’s method of purgation is by now a subject of common gossip. I think that certainly I am in entire agreement with Father du Passage in matters of principle, but it is better to leave nothing in the shadow. If the Basque Catholics had ever thought in 1932 that one day their Republican loyalty would be stigmatized as a crime so foul that a crowd of Spanish Bishops and Jesuits publicly approved their executioners, perhaps they would have kept clear of the civil war. Why should we be forbidden to point out this fact not only to those Communist comrades whom the Jocist boys insist on taking to hear sermons, but even to the Jocist boys themselves? There are certainly far too many Catholics in France who applaud or glorify terrorist methods, of which the abject efficacy is apparent both in Austria and Spain. After all, the flesh is weak, and I cannot think I am doing wrong in warning a number of over-hasty good people against the temptations of civil war. Though we may pardon the excesses of individuals, surely we cannot tolerate mass executions without sentence, or the shooting of prisoners and of the wounded. Is it so hard to reach agreement on these points? In plain words: I think that whoever comes to us with the open suggestion that young French or English workmen, even Communists, whose fathers fought with us in the trenches on the Somme or at Verdun, should be purged out — ought to be discouraged here and now. That goes without saying? Yes, but it goes even better by being said. . . . Toulon , July 1938 georges bernanos 10 NOTE Georges Bernanos is fifty. His career as a writer has been brief. It only began in 1926, and was continued in a series of novels; then came The Diary of a Country Priest which has earned him an established and international reputation. Bernanos is profoundly French. His family, which came originally from Spain, stuck roots long ago in the soil of more than one French province. He himself is ardently attached to all that is ancient and great in France. He is a Catholic and royalist. He married a girl whose family claims kindred with Joan of Arc, a grand-niece of Davout. He has six children, three sons and three daughters. Bernanos enjoys laughing and gossiping with his friends. Flashes of sudden wrath and tenderness, irony and merriment, come and go in him, lighting his remarkable blue eyes. To express his character one must insist on empha- sizing the two great sources from which it springs: the Catholic Church, and a sense of Honour. The riches of this dual inspiration have given to his writing its significant unity. That point of view is the measure of all his judgements, and it is because to him Chris- tian truth and loyalty to friends are absolute values, that betrayal finds in him no mercy. He is conscious of the duty to keep intact and to en- rich that tradition of ancient France which his fathers and teachers have handed down. Those who by their ignorance, cowardice or stupidity, impair this in- heritance, are warned that he will always oppose them. 1 1 His voice has notes of the deepest wrath, but only when his tenderness for the thing he loves is outraged; his anger is the effervescence of his compassion. That is the meaning of this book which plumbs such depths that its meaning is universal. Nevertheless, in order to heighten this universal appeal, the publishers have considered it advisable to delete certain passages in the book solely concerned with French politics and personalities which could be of no interest to the great majority of readers in this country, and would give a ‘local’ impression which is quite unjustified. For Bcrnanos has a message for all, in the same way as the protagonist of The Diary of a Country Priest , who, though seemingly addressing merely Madame la Comtesse or Seraphita Dumouchel, was in reality addressing the whole world. For the same reason, the translation is in parts very ‘free’. Adaptations, rather than equivalents, have had occasionally to be found. Never to twist the words from their meaning, but in order to give them this universal expression, the translating of Bernanos is of necessity a very arduous task and a great satisfaction. When the Spanish war broke out, Bernanos had been living for more than a year in Palma, Majorca, in very difficult material circumstances, and suffering from the after-effects of a motor-cycle accident. He was writing two books at the same time, A Crime, and The Diary of a Country Priest. It was in Majorca that Bernanos watched civil war, or rather — since the island fell almost at once into the hands of the Fascists --watched terrorism eating its slow way into this little middle-class and peasant community, slyly aided and abetted by those who might have been protecting it. With the keen penetration of a novelist, he realized that a state of terror is more easily reached than people think. Terrorism, he says, really began to appal him when he perceived that he was getting used to it; since this kind of terrorism can cloak itself skilfully in the guise of surface law and order. Later, Bernanos returned to France. And there, at home, especially among Conservatives, he encountered this same atmosphere of panic which explains and almost appears to authorize, in the name of a threatened public order, any kind of preventative measure, any hatred or any lie. So Bernanos wrote this book. He settled at Toulon where again he was taken seriously ill. But one thing alone caused him anxiety — his fear of not being able to say what he had to say. He wrote to liberate his soul, and at the same time has also succeeded in freeing the souls of others op- pressed by these same impostures. Any reader who likes to take the trouble to read the beginning a second time, will perceive the importance of that psychological analysis which probes so wide and deep into the sub-soil of instinct, laying bare the causes of massive and terrible reactions, freely spon- taneous in appearance, closely determined in reality by obscure forgotten deviations from the normal trend of social life, ancient, half-conscious betrayals which still burden the souls of men. Little by little, with stubborn application, the book was finished, to the formidable accompaniment of great European events — the war continuing in Spain, the ruin of Austria. With almost childish, sometimes heroic obstinacy, Bernanos set himself to the task of safeguarding his independence as a writer. He omitted everything which might have cast the least shadow of doubt on the integrity of his evidence. IS He asserted nothing of which he was in any way uncertain, incessantly scrupulous only to implicate himself. And nobody has yet dared to cast any doubt upon the veracity of a single detail in this book, and much less has anyone dared try to refute it. On the other hand the note of tragic reality, audible in this long cry of alarm, instantly formed a fervent group of enthusiastic readers. However, the book has been attacked in the original French. Bernanos resented only Catholic criticism. He even felt it necessary to make an answer, in order to clear up any doubt as to his loyalty to the Catholic Church, which he will never allow to be questioned. He has now left France again, this time for South America. And this second departure serves to mark his complete disinterestedness; an independence akin to the spirit of adventure. 14. A DIARY OF MY TIMES I jf» j* Had I any inclination for the task which now I undertake, I should doubtless lose heart before I had finished it, because I should not believe in it any longer. I believe only where I pay dearly. I have done no passably decent job in this world which did not at first seem to me useless — absurdly useless, useless to the point of nausea. My secret demon is called: ‘What’s the use?’ At one time I believed in contempt. A very scholarly state of mind, which soon turns to eloquence, as in dropsy blood turns to water. Reading Barres 1 at too early an age had given me some illusions on the matter. Unfortunately the contempt of Barr&s — or shall wc say the organ which secretes it? — seems to suffer from perpetual retention. A scornful man must needs probe very deeply to gauge his true rancour. Peace to Barres, author of Lews Figures'. The man we loved entered into death with the eyes of a proud child, and the tight, pathetic smile of an impecunious young gentlewoman who will never find a husband. jr. * Jf* Why the name of Barres, on the threshold of this book? Why that of the gentle Toulet 3 , on the first page of the Soleil de Satan 3 ? Because to-night, as on 1 Short explanatory Notes to all numbered references will be found on pages 267 to 268. 17 B that other September evening, ‘full of still light’, 1 shrink from the first step towards you, oh shrouded faces! For once that first step is taken, I know nothing will impede me; whatever happens I shall go on to the end of my task, through days and days all so alike that I don’t count them, that they seem as though cut off from the rest of my life. Which in truth they are. I am no author. The sight alone of a blank sheet wearies my spirit, and the sheer physical isolation imposed by such work is so distasteful to me that I avoid it as much as I can. I sit scribbling in cafes, at the risk of being taken for a drunkard — and that no doubt is what I should really be, if our mighty Governments did not burden so ruthlessly with taxa- tion the cup that cheers. Failing this, I swallow white sweetish coffees, the whole year round, together with an occasional drowned fly. I write at cafe tables because I cannot long be deprived of the human face and voice, which I have tried to render with dignity. Let clever folk suppose that I sit ‘observing’ my fellow-men. I observe nothing. Observation never leads to much. All his life M. Bourget 4 ‘observed’ society people, yet still he clung to his first impression of them, as an indus- trious little school-teacher athirst for Mayfair and English gentility. His sententious dukes remain soli- citors, and when he strives to make them ‘come alive’, they appear as witless as greyhounds. Jffx Jr* I scribble in cafiSs, just as I used to scribble in railway carriages, in order not to be taken in by tB figments of my own imagination, in order at a glance to re-discover, in the unknown person opposite, my own fair measure of joy or sorrow. No — I’m not an ‘author 5 . Had I been a real one, I never should have waited till I was forty before I published my first book. For you’ll grant, no doubt, that at twenty I had as good a chance as the next man of turning out novels. Not that I decline to be called an author out of some kind of inverted snobbery. I respect the job which — next to God — has enabled me to keep my wife and children. And I humbly endure the s ham e of having so far only spattered with ink the face of injustice, whose incessant outrages are my zest for life. A vocation is always a call to action — vocatus — and every call must be passed on. Those to whom I call are obviously few. They will alter in nothing the ways of the world. Yet it is for them — for them that I was born. j>» Unknown brothers, tired companions, one day we shall all stand together at the gates of the Kingdom of God. A battered, scarecrow company, white from dusty roads; dear rugged faces from which I was never able to wipe the sweat, eyes that have seen good and evil, finished their task, taken upon themselves both life and death — eyes which never have surrendered! Old friends that is how I shall find you, just as I dreamed of you, when I was a boy. For in setting out, I ran to find you. At the first turn of the highroad, I would have caught sight of your eternal camp-fires. My childhood was yours and nobody else’s. Perhaps on one day — a day I remember — I may have been iq worthy of walking at the head of your stern company. May God never let me see again the byways where I lost your tracks, at that hour when boyhood’s shadows lengthen, and the essence of death, creeping through our veins, mingles at last with the heart’s blood. Leaves of Artois at the very end of autumn, lawny and fragranL as wild beasts, paths rotting in November rain, huge prancing clouds, clamour in the skies, still waters. . . . Home I came and swung open the gate, thrust my feet, with boots rusted in slush, up to the fire. It would be morning long before the shadows of dreams, still scarcely shaped, mcmbcrlcss embryos, had slipped back into the silences of my spirit — its most secrcl haunts. Mouchette and Domisan, Cenabrc, Chantal 8 , and you, you alone of all my creatures of whose face I sometimes caught a glimpse, yet to whom I dared not give a name— dear Cure 9 of an imaginary Ambri- court. . . . Did you guide me in those days, you people? Are you still guiding me? Believe me, I know all the vanity of such yearning for the past. I know my life is already heavy with the dead. But none are so dead as the little boy that once was me. And yet, when the hour strikes, it is he who shall walk again at the head of my life, gather around him all my mistaken years, to the very last of them, and like a young leader of veterans, rallying his scattered company, he shall enter first the House of my Father. After all, I’ll have the right to speak in his name. But there! — we cannot speak in the name of childhood, for then we should have to speak as children. That is the forgotten tongue which I, oo fool, keep seeking from book to book. As though such words could ever be written, or ever had been! And yet . . . sometimes a lost echo returns to me. And it is that makes you listen, my brothers all over the world, who by chance or boredom have happened to open one of my books. A strange notion to write for those who disdain all writing! A bitter irony to strive to convince and persuade, when my deepest belief is that the only world which may yet be re- deemed, is the world of children, of heroes and of martyrs. jfa ‘I have sworn to move you cither to anger or love, and I don’t care which.’ I said this in the days of f The Great Fear’, seven long years back. Now I no longer care much about moving anyone, least of all to wrath. For the wrath of the Stupid has always saddened me; but to-day I might almost say it terri- fies. The whole world is full of the din of it. What else was to be expected? The Stupid asked nothing better than nol to have to understand anything, and they even used to get together and try not to under- stand, because the last thing of which man is capable is to be malicious and stupid all by himself— a mys- terious state reserved presumably for the damned. Without understanding, they formed spontaneously into herds, not according to any particular affinities — these were too weak — but in obedience to the petty function, which swallowed up the whole of their small lives, allotted them by birth or chance. The middle classes have almost a monopoly in the fabrication of true stupidity; since the upper classes °i specialize in a brand of entirely useless foolishness, a luxury foolishness; whereas the lower only achieve rough, and sometimes admirable, attempts at the purely bestial. jo* It was madly rash, as M. Maurice Barits predicted , 7 to uproot the Stupid. A stupid colony firmly attached to its native soil like a shoal of bar- nacles to a rock, can appear inoffensive, and even provide the Slate and Industry with valuable raw material. For the Stupid are soaked in habits of mind and ready-made notions. When parted from their environment, they retain, between two tightly closed valves, the stagnant waters in which they grow. But modern life not only whirls the Stupid from place to place, but harries them into a kind of frenzy. The huge machine, working at top speed, sucks them up in their thousands, scatters them all over the earth at the mercy of its colossal winds. No society but ours has ever consumed these unfortunates in such vast quantities, devouring them while their shell was still soft, not even allowing them to mature, knowing of course that with age and that degree of experience to which the Stupid may hope to attain, they grow a stupid wisdom, which makes them tough. I feel I must apologize for so naturally resorting to metaphors. I would wish to set down these reflections in words as simple as they. Of course they would not be understood. To begin to perceive a truth which daily is becoming more evident, needs an effort to which not many of us, nowadays, feel equal. Admit that simplicity repels you, makes you OO uncomfortable. What you call ‘simple’ is the very opposite. You’re easy-going, you’re not simple. An easy-going conscience is also the most involved. Why should it not be the same of the mind? In the course of centuries our Masters, the Masters of the human race, have cleared for us the great high-roads of thought leading from one truth to another, the roads royal. But of what use are royal roads, when the gait of your mind is devious? Sometimes by chance you may happen to find yourself on one of them, but you cannot recognize it. Even as anguish would pinch our hearts on a night, when emerging from our labyrinth of trenches, we suddenly felt the firm soil underfoot of one of the old roads of the past, now almost hidden by moss: a dead road, a road full of silence which had once been alive with the steps of men. Yes, the wrath of the Stupid fills the earth. You may laugh, but it will spare nothing and nobody; it is incapable of mercy. Of course Right or Left wing dogmatists, whose profession it is, will go on classifying the Stupid, will enumerate the different kinds, define each group according to the specific craze and interests of the individuals which compose it, their own par- ticular ideology. For such clever folk it’s child’s play. But those classifications have so little in com- mon with reality, that with use their number is ruth- lessly curtailed. Clearly a multiplicity of ‘parties’ is most flattering to the vanity of the Stupid. It gives them the illusion of having chosen for themselves. Any shop assistant 23 will tell you that crowds at a sale, lured by a display of latest novelties, having haggled their fill, and driven the assistants half crazy, end by going back to the first counter. Wc have seen the birth and death of many parties, because for certain newspapers it is the only method by which to retain their readers. Unfortunately the natural mistrustfulness of the Stupid makes this sub- dividing somewhat precarious. The troubled herd keeps on re-forming itself. The moment that circum- stances, and especially the tactics of an election, seem to impose strategical alliances, they instantly forget the distinctions which in any case they only achieved with the greatest difficulty. Of their own volition, they divide into two large groups, and so the mental effort required is reduced to a minimum: all they need do is weigh heavily against the adversary, and make a little cross in the corner of a card. Com- plicated designations, such as ‘Royalist’ or ‘Republi- can 3 have always been accepted with some misgiving. Clerical or anti-clerical is more attractive: the two words have no deeper meaning than ‘for’ or ‘against’ priests, and anyway the prefix ‘anti’ is not the sole prerogative of either side; if the Left is anti-clerical, the Right is anti-masonic and anti-semitic. No doubt those who run the Press, and who by now have worn these slogans nearly threadbare, would have me admit that X merely consider both sets of ideas equally repulsive. Alas! I know only too well how much a lad of twenty can give of himself, of his soul’s substance, to these vulgar contraptions of party spirit. The lavish soul of youth! Sometimes it’s poured out into brothels. Like those iridescent flies decked in 24 sky-blue and gold, painted with greater art than stained glass, first loves come swooping round the charnel-housc. . . . You see, I don’t even believe in the relative ad- vantage of conspiracies of ignorance, and foregone conclusions. The indispensable condition which must be fulfilled before entering into action, is to know oneself, to have truly gauged oneself. And all these folk merely get together to pile up in common the few reasons they possess for supposing themselves better than everyone else. Of what use, therefore, can be the cause they insist on serving? Take for instance our meagre herd of bigots, maintained at such enor- mous expense by a special literature printed in its thousands all over the world, and which is simply made to repel all well-meaning agnostics. God knows the price the rest of us have to pay for it! I have no feeling against the narrow-minded, all I want is not to be deafened with stories of their supposed simplicity. Any priest will tell you — if he is honest — that no species is further removed than theirs from the spirit of child- hood, its supernatural vision, its generosity. The narrow-minded arc the tricksters of faith. And those plump, literary canons, who suckle these larvae with honey plundered from the flowers of the soul — they are not so innocent, either! jz * The wrath of the Stupid fills the world. Easy enough to see that when Providence made the Stupid naturally sedentary, she had good reasons for so doing. But now your cars, your express trains, your aeroplanes, transport them here and there like 25 lightning. Once each little town had its two or three ‘stupid sets’ of which the famous ‘Rice and Prunes’ described in Daudet’s Tatiarin in the Alps was the perfect example. Your profound mistake is to fancy that stupidity is harmless, or even that there are harm- less forms of stupidity. Stupidity has no more vital force than a canonade of *36, yet once you get it going, it smashes everything. We all know what can result from the patient, vigilant hatred of mediocrities. And yet we fling the seed of it to the winds! For now whilst modern machinery permits the interchanging of the Stupid, not merely from town to town, and province to province, but from count ty to country, or even from continent to continent — the democracies are still borrowing from these creatures the stuff of which their public opinions are made. Thus, thanks to the care of a huge Publicity, working day and night on a few arbitrarily chosen themes, the ‘Prunes and Rice’ rivalry assumes universal proportions of which M. Alphonse Daudct certainly never dreamed. But who reads Tartarin to-dayi* Let us therefore recall how this gentle poet of Provence, who was so often exalted beyond himself by the consummation of pain and his gift of pity, gathers together at a mountain inn a dozen or so stupid people. The glacier is at hand, suspended in vast skies. Nobody bothers with it. After a few days feigned heartiness, mistrust and boredom, the poor devils find a way of satisfying both their gregarious instincts and the muffled spite which frets them. The ConsLipated party insist on prunes, for dessert. The Relaxed naturally favour rice. From that instant personal disagreements die down, harmony reigns between the members of each hostile group. Easy enough to imagine in the wings, some smart guy either in the rice or prune trade, suggesting to these miserable beings a Belief in keeping with the condition of tjieir bowels. But such a character is not needed. Stupidity invents nothing, and makes perfect use of everything which chance bestows to achieve its purpose, the purpose of stupidity. And by some phenomenon of even greater mystery, you will see it, alas, adjust itself to the men, circumstances, doctrines, that have provoked its monstrous besotting faculty. At St. Helena, Napoleon boasted that he had known how to make use of the Stupid. But in the long run it was the Stupid that made use of Napoleon. Not only, as you might imagine, by becoming ‘bonapartists’. Little by little they adjusted his vision to the taste of modern demo- cracies, creating that silly kind of ‘patriotism’ which still can stir their glands to violence: a patriotism our ancestors never knew, whose blatant insolence, with bases of hate, mistrust and envy, is expressed — though not always equally well — in certain songs and war poetry. Are you tired of all this about the Stupid? Well — I’m tired, loo. But of one thing I must first convince you: that you’ll never defeat the Stupid by shot nor steel nor poison-gas. For they invented neither shot, nor steel, nor gas, but they know how to use everything which preserves them from the only effort of which they are quite incapable, that of thinking for them- selves. They would far rather kill than have to think, unfortunately. And you go supplying the machinery! Machinery has been created for their benefit. Until you produce the thinking-machine they await and ay must have — which is on its way — they’ll manage all right with a killing-machine: it fits them, like a glove. Wc have industrialized war, to bring it within the reach of all. It certainly is now. If not, I defy you to explain how — by what miracle — it has become so easy to make a soldier out of the first shop-keeper, insurancc-clcrk, lawyer or parson that comes along? The same here as in Germany, as in England, as in Japan. It’s so easy: you spread out your apron and a hero flops into it. I say nothing against the dead. But once upon a time the vocation of a soldier was the most honoured after that of a priest, and barely yielded to the latter in dignity. So surely it is a little odd that our capitalistic civilization, which doesn’t cxacLly encourage the spirit of sacrifice, should dispose of as many army-men as uniforms produced by its factories. . . . Such army-men as surely were never seen before! You pick ’em out of their offices or work-shops, where they’re sitting ever so quiet. You give ’em a ticket to Hell, stamped by their recruiting-station, and a new pair of usually non- waterproof trench-boots. The final send-off, the country’s last good-bye to its brave lads, comes in the form of a pop-eyed glare from the re-enlisted N.C.O. put in charge of the Stores, who calls them b , then off they hurry to the station, slightly soused, but really worried in case they might miss the train to Hell, just as though they were going out to a family picnic, on Sunday. They’re getting out at Hell this time. One year, two years, four years, until the circular ticket, issued by the Govern- ment has expired, they will tear all over Hell in a drizzle of lead and steel, careful not to break into their oR iron ration without permission, or on the alert to scrounge the next man’s first-aid outfit, which they never received. On the day of the ‘attack’, with a bullet in their bellies, they amble like young part- ridges to the dressing-station, collapse perspiring on a stretcher and wake up in hospital, from whence they are shoved out a little later as meekly as ever they went in, with a fatherly thump between the shoulders from the old Major — such a good sort. . . . Then back to Hell, in a carriage with no window- panes, munching cheese from station to station, imbibing sour wine, conning the cabalistic way-bill in the dirty lamp-light, full of misgivings about being on the right track. . . . On the day of Victory? Why, on the day of Victory, a chap hopes to be able to get out of uniform. . . . Actually, he doesn’t, for the well-known reason that ‘Armistice isn’t Peace’, and you must give them time to realize this. About a year was considered necessary. But a week would have sufficed. A week would have sufficed to prove to the soldiers of the Great War that ‘Victory’ is a thing to be viewed respectfully from afar, like the Colonel’s daughter, or Napoleon’s Tomb; that if the ‘men who won the War’ want to be allowed to go on living, they’d better forget about it. So back they went to their work-shops and offices, still as good as gold. And some even had the luck to find in the pockets of a pre-war pair of pants a dozen meal-tickets of their old kip — sixpence a meal, it used to be. But the new management wouldn’t take them. Those folk were Saints, you say. No, I assure you they weren’t saints. They were merely resigned. 29 There is in every man a huge capacity of resignation. Mankind is naturally resigned. Which is why we last. Because you sec, if it wasn’t for that, the thinking creatures we are couldn’t have borne to be the play- things of life. The last of us, thousands of years ago, would have smashed his skull against the walls of his cave, denying his soul. Yet Saints are not resigned, at least in the accepted sense. If they suffer in silence the forms of injustice which arouse inferior men, it is the better to fling against the brazen face of true in- j ustice the full vigour of their great spirits. Our rages, daughters of despair, creep and squirm like worms. Prayer is the only form of revolt which remains upright. Man is resigned by nature. Especially modern man, because of the extreme loneliness of a society that recognizes between its members no longer any links but those of money. Yet we should be wrong in thinking such resignation turns him into a harmless creature. Rather it concentrates in him poison enough to make him ready — when the time comes — for any cruelty. The peoples of our democracies are but a rabble held in perpetual check by the invisible Speaker, by voices calling from all sides of the world, voices churning your guts, twisting your nerves be- cause they endeavour to speak the very language of your longing, of your hate, and of your fear. Parlia- mentary democracies, though the most excitable, are lacking in temperament. Those under dictator- ships have a fire in their bellies. wfefc The wrath of the Stupid fills the world. And 30 in their anger they are fretted by the thought of redemption, for that is the basis of all human hope. It was this same instinct which drove Europe against Asia at the time of the Crusades. But in those days Europe was Christian, and the Stupid themselves belonged to Christianity. And though a Christian may be many things, a brute, a fool or a madman, he can never be entirely stupid. I am speaking of Christians born Christians, Christians by right, Christians of Christianity. Because such Christians, growing up in the freedom and fullness of Christian soil, consummate one by one, in sun and rain, each season of their lives. God preserve me from comparing them to those sapless bulbs which priests grow in little flower-pots, sheltered from the wind! For a Christian of Christianity the New Testament is not just an anthology of which one reads a bit every Sunday in a prayer-book. The New Testament is law, habit of life, pain and even pleasure; for the simple hope of man, as well as the fruits of his loins, are blessed therein. Make fun of it as much as you choose. I know very little that’s worth while, but I know what it means to hope for the Kingdom of Heaven, and that’s something, I promise you! You don’t believe me? What of it? That hope may yet return to its people. We may breathe it all together on one morning of our days, in the honey-sweetness of dawn. You’re not interested? Who cares? You who will refuse then to receive it in your hearts, will yet know of the Advent, thus: those who look away from you to-day, or snigger when your back is turned, will come straight up to you, with the eyes of Si manhood. Thus you will know, I say, that your time is up! Ja The Stupid are fretted by the idea of redemp- tion. Of course if you went and asked the first one you met, he’d say he’d never thought of such a thing, and wasn’t even quite clear what you were talking about. For the Stupid possess no mental gadget with which to probe into themselves. They can only explore their surface. Yes, but though the blunt hoe of a nigger merely scrapes the soil sufficiently to plant a little canary-seed, the earth may be rich and capable of greater harvests. Besides, what do we know of any mediocre person until wc have observed him amongst other mediocrities of his race, communing in pleasure and horror and hate? True, each mediocrity appears well armoured against any mediocrity of another kind. But the gigantic efforts of our democracies have finally broken down this obstacle. The prodigious, the unique feat has been achieved: the security of the mediocre has been destroyed. Security which seemed part of mediocrity — its very substance. Mediocrities are not necessarily stultified. The first step was to stultify them. Vaguely aware of what they lacked, and of the relentless current bearing them to fates unfathomable, they shut themselves up in habits, hereditary or acquired, like the famous American who crossed Niagara Falls in a barrel. Now the barrel is smashed, and the river-banks flash by, like lightning. Ja Ja A village notary, two centuries ago, no doubt 32 hardly considered his birth-place as durable as Car- thage or Memphis, but at the rate things are moving, by to-morrow he will feel about as safe as in a bed on a windy night in the market-place. The myth of Progress has indeed served our democracies well. But a century or so was required before the Stupid, reared in fixedness for so many generations, saw in this myth beyond the thrill of a new game. The Stupid are sedentary, but they have always loved travel-books. Just imagine such a travel-maniac in the quiet of his bedroom, suddenly seeing the floor move! He rushes to the window, flings it open, gets a blast of steam in his face, and finds he’s ‘off’, though the word ‘off’ hardly applies here. For since the eyes of modern man can rest on no fixed point — the notorious reason for sea-sickness — the poor devil doesn’t really feel as though he were going anywhere. His worries are just the same, I mean, though they seem more numerous owing to this particular per- spective. But there’s no real new way of making love, and no new way of going West. This is all simple, very simple. To-morrow it will be simpler still. So simple that it will be no longer possible to write intelligently of the misfortune of mankind, for the immediate cause will hardly be worth analysis. The early symptoms of a deadly disease provide brilliant lectures for professors of medicine, but every mortal illness finally achieves the same symptom: the heart stops. Not much to be said about that. Society will die no other way. You may still be discussing whys and wherefores, when the blood has already ceased to circulate. The parable is exact enough, for the reform of institutions will come too 33 a late, when the deception of the people is irreparable, when the heart of the people is broken. j* jr* Don’t touch the Stupid! The Angel of the Modern World might have inscribed this in letters of gold on the Frontal Arch — if the Modern World had an angel. To let loose the Wrath of the Stupid, one need but set them against each other, and imperial democracies at the height of their wealth and power couldn’t resist the temptation. They have run it. The myth of Progress was no doubt the only one in which millions of men could commune, the only one to satisfy their lust for gain, their shallow ‘morality’ and the ancient inherited instinct of ‘fairness’. After all, the head of a glass-blowing works, last century, who according to undeniable statistics, systematically thinned out whole districts for the requirements of his trade, must have had, like each one of us, his moments of depression. Though you half strangle yourself in a silk cravat, flaunt a button- hole as large as a saucer, and dine at the Tuileries — still there must be days when the ‘inner voice’ can be heard. . . . And mind you, the great-grandsons of those gentlemen are some of our nicest young men to-day, smart, clever, sporting, and generally well- connected. Many of them call themselves ‘royalists’, and talk of the family arms with the triumphant thrust of the chin of a descendant of Godefroy de Bouillon 8 asserting his rights over the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Nasty little frauds! They have one excuse: their social sense is lacking. There was none to inherit. Money-crimes have an abstract quality. History is 34 laden with the victims of gold, but their remains are odourless. j* Herewith another example of the magic metal that wards off the effects of putrefaction. If a half- witted cow-herd kills a couple of shepherdesses after violating them, chronicles record his name, make of his name an insult, a name that stinks. Whilst those ‘Gentlemen of the Trade of Nantes’, the great slave traffickers, as the Senator of Guadelope respectfully names them, were able to pile up the bodies, and yet all that black flesh exhales throughout the centuries but a faint aroma of verbena and Spanish tobacco. ‘These captains of slave-ships seem to have been men of noble bearing’, pursues the honourable Sena- tor. ‘They wore a wig, as though at court, a sword at their side, shoes with silver buckles, an embroidered doublet with lace jabot and cuffs.’ ‘Such a trade’ — concludes this journalist — ‘in no way dishonoured either those who practised nor those who subsidized it. Indeed there were few financiers or well-to-do families who were not slave-owners, in one way or another. The shipping magnates who financed these remote and expensive expeditions, divided the capital in- volved, into a number of shares, and these shares, which as a rule paid huge dividends, constituted for all heads of families a much sought after investment.’ The captains of the slave-ships were anxious to be deserving of the shareholders’ trust, and performed their duties most conscientiously, as the following extract — chosen among many others of the same kind, from an interesting record on the matter — goes to prove: 35 ‘Yesterday at eight o’clock wc lashed down the most mutinous of our negroes by the arms and feet, flat on their bellies on the captain’s bridge, and had them flogged. And in addition (that they might the better know their faults) we pulled strips of skin from off their buttocks. Having drawn the blood from their backsides with whippings and scarifications, wc rubbed in the wounds a concoction of gunpowder, lemon-juice, brine and pimento, all pounded together with another drug which the ship’s surgeon added, to prevent gangrene and moreover that tlicir backsides might burn continuously, as they lay to starboard, exposed to the wind.’ Here is a good example of the tact and discretion displayed in the old days, when it was needful to explain anything to the Stupid. Whereas to-day the Italian Press is taking great pains to justify the wholesale destruction of Abyssinia. This understanding of the Spirit of Power is too much altogether for the Stupid, because it obliged them to concentrate exhaustingly in order to see things from Mussolini’s point of view. II Duce stands before those villages, in which the defenders have managed to destroy all life, even animal and insect life, and then turns to the descendants of the ‘Gentlemen of the Trade of Nantes’, who have come with their good ladies and daughters, and sons preparing for college. He’s a little flushed and uneasy at first, but soon he becomes eloquent, speaks of the Burden of Greatness, from time immemorial, of Power and of the Empire. The kind ladies and gentlemen eye each other un- comfortably. What an idea to bring us here! So depressing! Worse than a cemetery, and my wife gets 36 so easily upset, with her high blood-pressure. All this fuss about a few niggers! Why my people did very well out of niggers at one time— just like this gentleman — without talking like a history-book. Is the concern going to pay? That’s what matters. The conception of greatness has never been a sop to the Stupid conscience. Greatness is a per- petual striving, and the mediocre possess no wisdom enabling them to realize, that irresistible thrust. (They can only conceive of it dead, and as though petrified into History.) But the notion of 'Progress’ supplies just what they want. Greatness entails great sacrifice. Progress drifts unaided down the current of massed experience. Oppose no resistance beyond that of your own weight and all will be well: some- thing like the collaboration of a drowned dog with the stream that bears it away. When the old-time master-glass-blower, after a final stocktaking, worked out the exact figure of his profits, he must sometimes have given a thought to the humble assistant now coughing up the last of his lungs in the ashes of his grate, with the mangy cat dozing at his elbow, and the wretched babe with a face like an old woman, wailing in its cot. Which recalls to one’s mind the celebrated remark of an American boss to the reporter who is being shown round the factory, and is having a drink with his host before catching the train. The reporter suddenly exclaims: ‘What the hell do you do with your old workmen? I haven’t caught sight of one that looked to be more than fifty. . . Pause on the part of 37 the Boss, who slowly drains his glass. ‘Have a cigar/ he says, ‘and we’ll take a walk round the cemetery.’ The master-glass-blower must have taken a walk round the cemetery too, now and again. And though he may have said no prayers — for the better-classes in those days were all free-thinkers — he no doubt behaved with respect and even paused for meditation. Why not? I’m quite serious. People who don’t know me well often regard me as a fanatic and pamphletist. A polemist — I insist once again — is amusing until the age of twenty, tolerable up to thirty, impossible round fifty, and obscene beyond. The propagandist itch in an old man seems to me a kind of eroticism. That cold excitement of senile fanatics. . . . Far from ‘working myself up’, I spend my time trying to understand, which is the only remedy against the kind of delirious hysteria into which finally descend the unhappy folk who can barely take a step without catching their foot in some injustice, carefully hidden in the grass, like a trap. I try to understand. I think I do my best to love. True, I am not what is termed an optimist. Optimism has always seemed to me the cunning alibi of egoists, anxious to cover up their state of chronic self-satisfaction. They are optimists in order to avoid pitying other men and their misfortune. j* Yet pity is a vexed question. Those of delicate sensibilities are too prone to estimate the depth of this sentiment by its convulsive manifestations in certain pitiful people. Whilst such convulsions express a revolt against pain somewhat dangerous for the 38 patient, as they are liable to combine in the same re- vulsion both suffering and sufferer. We have all met those hyper-sensitive ladies who cannot bear to see a wounded beetle without instantly crushing it under- foot, with shudders of disgust most unflattering to the poor beetle who would doubtless have preferred to be allowed to creep quietly into its hole and get better. Certain paradoxes in modern history have become clear to me, now that I allow for one very obvious factor: modern man has a heart of flint and flaccid guts. Maybe after the Deluge the world will belong to monster jellyfish. Possibly, therefore, certain types are instinctively on their guard against pity, because they very wisely mistrust themselves and the brutality of their reactions. j*. For centuries the Stupid have meekly accepted traditional teachings of the Church on matters which to them really seemed insoluble. That Pain should or should not be of expiatory value, that Pain might even be held dear — who cares for the far-fetched notions of a very few on the matter, when Common Sense (and the Church) admits that sensible people should avoid it by all manner of means? Not even one of the Stupid has ever thought of denying the universal character of Pain; but universal pain used to be discreet. Now it can make itself heard with the same powerful mechanism as pleasure or hate. The very same folk who systematically restricted social relations down to mere printed forms announcing births, marriages and deaths, in order to economize their tiny stock of fellow-feeling, can no longer open 39 the paper or turn on the wireless without hearing of some catastrophe. And to shake off the effects of such an obsession, it is no longer sufficient to go to mass once a week, and inattentively listen to a few well-chosen words on pain delivered by some worthy, wcll-nourislicd canon who is going to share the Sunday joint. So the Stupid have resolutely set about the pain-question as well as the pauper-question. It’s up to Science to deal with pain, reason the Stupid, with their inflexible logic, and the Government must deal with the Poor. In the meantime we’ll rouse Public Opinion against both scourges, since everyone knows Public Opinion is irresistible. Res- pect poor men? You might as well respect the lice on their bodies! Those fantasies of the East were all very well in the days of Jesus, who in any case was hardly a man of action. If Jcsus-Christ were alive to-day, He would have to ‘get on or get out’ like every- body else, and were He no more than a small factory- owner, He would have to realize that modern society, in exalting the dignity of money and branding lack of money with degradation, is really ‘doing its best’ for the poor! Man is born proud, before everything, and his hungry pride is hungrier even than his belly. A brass medal is sufficient reward to a private for risking his life. Whenever you strike at the prestige of money, you raise the poor man by so much in his own esteem. His poverty shames him less, he sufFcrs it, and such is his folly that he might grow to love it in the end. But in order to function, Society has need of the self- respecting poor. Humiliation puts far more of these at its mercy than ever hunger, and people of a better 40 type: though they strain at their shafts, they will pull till the end. They pull as others like them die at the front, not from any particular inclination, but so as not to feel small in front of the other fellows, or perhaps merely to get one up on the sergeant. Unless you keep them up to scratch, spurred on by the land- lord, the grocer, the rent- collector, continually threa- tened with the shame attached to tramps and paupers, they may not actually stop working, but they won’t work so hard, or may want to do a job their own way, and cease to feel a proper respect for the factory. In the days when our methods of liberal economy possessed their entire educational value — their full effect — before the deplorable invention of trade- unions, the true workman, the workman we shaped for ourselves, was so deeply convinced of having to atone each day with his labour for the disgrace of being poor, that even when he was old or ill he shrank with equal horror from both workhouse and hospital, less through a clinging to freedom, than shame — shame of being no longer able to ‘do for himself’, as they so admirably express it. j*. The wrath of the Stupid fills the world. It is perhaps less to be feared than their pity. The most inoffensive attitude of the Stupid Man towards pain and distress, is that of stupid indifference. Woe unto us if with tool-box and clumsy fingers, cruel fingers, he meddle with the hinges of the world! But already he lingers no longer, and has produced from the tool- box a huge pair of shears. He prides himself on being ‘practical’ and fancies that pain, like poverty, is merely 41 something lacking, something wrong — rather less than nothing. He cannot understand their resistance. So a ‘poor man’ is not merely a person who would be like everybody else if only he had a banking account? Of course there are ‘poor men’ of that type, though not as many as one might suppose, because economic life lias been warped by so many ‘poor’ becoming rich — sham rich, retaining in the midst of their riches the vices of poverty. Doubtless such a kind were no more truly poor than truly rich — a bastard race. But how can you expect these subtleties to be appreciated by the same Stupid, whose most cherished illusion is that ‘we’re all the same underneath’? How will you make them realize that the Poor arc a people, with traditions oldest of all the traditions in the world? A people as unchangeable as the Jews. We can come to terms with such a people, but never absorb them into the mass. Gome what may, we must leave them to their own law and habits, and that primitive knowledge of life which is of no use to the rest of us. A knowledge like that of childhood, both innocent and intricate, an unskilled wisdom, as pure as the art of ancient engravings. There is no question of enriching the poor, for all the gold in your mines would probably not suffice. You would merely swell the ranks of the sham rich. No power in the world can check the eternal river of gold, can divert into one lake the myriad streams of magic metal, as elusive as mercury. jo* The poor do not want riches but respect: the respect returned to them which once was theirs. 42 Neither the strong nor the weak can live without respect, but the weak require it most. This theory is in no way unusual. It is unwise to let the weak become degraded — the rot of the weak is a poison for the strong. What would have become of women — your women — if by common consent throughout the centuries, (though you had the means to enslave them body and soul) you had not prudently resolved to respect them? You respect women, you respect children, and it would never occur to anyone among you to regard their helplessness as a shameful illness, almost unmentionable. Since principles have in this matter overswayed violence, why should we not hope to see the vile prestige of money likewise overthrown? For the glory of money would be shoddy enough, were it not for its sly accomplices. ^ ‘But hasn’t it always been the same?’ Yes, but though moneyed men have often held the power, that power never appeared legitimate to any- body, there has never been, there will never be a legitimate rule of Money. It hides the minute you question it, burrows underground, disappears. Even to-day its relationship with regard to the society under its thumb, is rather like that of the farm-hand who goes to bed with the lady of the house, a rich, ripe widow. He rakes in the profits, but he says ‘Yes, Mum’ when there’s anyone around, with his cap in his hand. We glorify beauty-queens and cinema stars. But could you imagine one of the Rockefellers being mobbed at the station by the same enthusiastic young 43 ladies that flock round Mr. Tino Rossi 0 ? They don’t mind showing with these indiscreet raptures, their pash for the little golden- voiced Corsican. Yet they would blush to display such eagerness over Mr. Ford, were he as good-looking as Mr. Robert Taylor. Money is all-powerful. Yet it has no official represen- tative, like any third-rate power: it is to be found in no full regimental procession. There’s the Judge in scarlet and rabbit-skin, the Field-Marshal braided like the Beadle of a cathedral, the Beadle himself, making way for the purple garbed Prelate, the head of the police, the Academician, who is rather like him, the M.P.’s all in black. But there is no Rich Man, though he’s paying for the lot, and could afford many fine feathers to his cap. It is indeed surprising that in this world which belongs to it, money always seems ashamed of itself. Mr. Roosevelt lately recalled how one quarter of American wealth was held by sixty families, which allowing for intermarrying amounted to no more than twenty. Some of those men with not so much as a letter after their names, control about eight millions. I know our young bloods of the Right Wing will think that’s rather a joke: ‘like the two hundred families here! Hi! Hi! Hi!’ Quite so, my lad! I don’t know if you’ve such a thing as a Real Country, as your leaders in their haranguing would have you believe. But there is real wealth in France. And that wealth should make safe our credit. But as you know, it docs not. Fifty millions, divided into five-franc pieces tucked away in stockings, are quite unable to balance the influence of one million ready to be used any minute, which juggles with the exchange according 44 to the principles of Napoleonic Warfare; ‘It doesn’t matter how many enemy regiments you have against you, so long as you strike the strongest where he is weakest.’ And if hidden gold pieces are hard to mobilize, what about fields and forests? J&. It is therefore quite feasible that the true riches of a country, however extensive they appear as compared to the capital retained by a few individuals, are in no way protected from the enterprises of such persons. Young patriots, I know these considerations in no way disturb the innocence of your dreams. What do you care for fields and vineyards? ‘Down goes the franc! What luck! That’s done for this government!’ Unfortunately the problem is not exactly what you imagine. I’m not concerned about the franc, my poor lads, I’m concerned for you. The franc will eventually recuperate, and its value will sooner or later correspond to the place of France in the world, to the need of the world for my country. The enemy is merely waiting for the hour to strike when financial advisers shall silently wink across at military advisers. Then . . . Then the franc will slowly climb up again, my boys, but not by the same means that now are sucking it down. You shall redeem it with your blood, you fools! If Money has not yet demanded public recog- nition of its supremacy, it is not so much through craft and prudence, as through an insurmountable timidity. Those that escape its sway can estimate its 45 power — to a farthing. Money knows nothing of their power. Saints and Heroes can sec into its mind but money cannot possibly conceive of what exactly Heroes and Saints think about it. Love of money alone has only resulted in demented obsessed creatures, which socicLy barely recognizes: they mumble and rot in dark regions, like the mush- rooms of Paris. Avarice is not a passion, but a vice. And the world docs not belong to Vice, as those tor- mented in their chastity believe: it belongs to Risk. The prudent, whose law is thiift, will burst out laughing, I know. But if they risk nothing themselves, they live on the risk of others. And sometimes, thank God, they die of it. Some obscure engineer may sud- denly decide, to the bewilderment of his nearest and dearest, that he will construct a mechanical bird, and a young racing-cyclist, after a drink or two, may swear to go up in such a contrivance: twenty years later your safety-first gents get forty-pound bombs crashing from the sky on to their heads. The world belongs to Risk. The world will soon be a matching of risks, a scramble for the most daring. . . . ■fc* jk * Had I time, I would like to warn you against an illusion much cherished by regular church-goers. They like to believe that e a Godless World’, as they call it, ‘will be destroyed by its own excess’. They arc expecting another disintegration of Rome. I’m afraid they will be disappointed. The putrid thing in the Roman Empire was its hoard of high officials, plun- derers, cynical beasts, so gullible at bottom, lapping 46 up the scum of Africa and Asia, mouths clamped to the main drain of both continents. The refinement of these brutes is like certain college traditions. For centuries, schoolmasters have been holding up as examples to the young, legendary Petronius’ or Lucullus* continually in and out of their steam baths, with ephebi to rub them down. But when you come to think of it, if those folk were always washing, it’s because they stank. Nard and balms were poured in vain over the shameful sores described by Juvenal and Lucian. And even when they were healthy, guzzlers that had to lie down the better to stuff themselves, and when full emptied themselves like demi-johns, with fat, gold-ringed fingers stuck down their throats, not even taking the trouble to sit up, must have needed a good sponge-down after dinner. . . . Though, of course, they lived in most sumptuous villas. The Roman citizen never attracted me. Never- theless, it was many years before I began to realize not only the manifest coarseness of his nature, but a certain very deep stupidity. I am not referring to the huge, half-witted extravagances: slave-fattened lampreys, nightingale tongues, pearls dissolved in Falernian, and various absurdities whose vulgarity would disgust even the slums of Marseilles. I am thinking of other pastimes regarded as diabolic (and maybe they were) which make professors turn pale and talk in whispers, but they sound to me more like the pranks of idle schoolboys. All those pot-bellied emperors tried very hard to be wicked. But to be truly perverse, they lacked a certain human quality. You cannot choose to be damned. You cannot choose to share the bread and wine of perdition. Why? Because not one of us 47 can cruelly oflcnd God except He withhold in Himself the means of loving and serving Him. And what have such scum to do with God? js* I can never get over the ‘cultured’ type of idiot, swollen with culture, crawling with literature, as though with lice, who declares with a crooking of his little finger that there is ‘nothing new in the world’. What does he know about that? The advent of Christ was a new thing. The dc-Clnistianizing of the world would be another. And obviously no person who has not observed the latter phenomenon could have any idea of its consequences. 1 am even more amazed at those catholics in whom even a cursory glance at the New Testament docs not seem to awaken any realization of a conflict more urgent each day, predicted then by a startling sugges- tion that had never been heard before, and which has remained, by the way, quite incomprehensible: ‘You cannot serve God and Mammon.’ But X know them! If by miracle this reminder dis- turbs anyone of their kind, he will hurry off to his con- fessor who will gently inform him, in the name of innumerable casuists, that this advice is only intended for the perfect, and consequently need not disturb shareholders. I quite agree. And in future, there- fore, I will write the word ‘Money’ with a capital M. You cannot serve God and Money. The Power of Money is opposed to the Power of God. The Rich were known to Antiquity. Many 48 people suffered through unfair distribution, through the selfishness, greed and pride of the Rich, though maybe we give insufficient thought to the thousands of ploughmen, herdsmen, shepherds and hunters who, thanks to limited means of communication, were able to live inaccessibly alone, in poverty and freedom. And here is a factor of terrific importance: the pro- fiteers of those days were mere officials, humbly taking their stance behind the victorious general, gleaning their profit from the spoils the army left behind — and God knows what the Roman army was before the old civilizations of the East had provided that herd of road- making, law-constructing billy-goats with real leaders and soldiers. At all events in those remote times, moneyed men exploited the world according to the luck of fruitful expeditions, they did not control it. What is there in common, I ask you, between those more or less official pirates, bent on filling their coffers while the going was good, returning to revel in their ill-gotten gains, perhaps perishing of their incontin- ence, and a respectable millionaire of to-day, gloomy and dyspeptic, able to re-distribute with the stir of an eyelid, with the sweep of a gold fountain-pen, the vast burden of universal want? How can they be com- pared? A slave-trafficker of the eighteenth century would have been quite unable to picture such a per- son, who would have appeared quite ridiculous io him: and indeed he is an absurd mongrel-breed — which has now become fixed — of a number of very different species. You gabble parrot-wise that he is the 'product of Capitalism’. He is not. He is the creator of it. Obviously not through any concerted plan. It is a matter of instinctive adaptation and 4-9 d defence. The bad rich man of old, the outrageous profligate, with his swaggering, extravagance and sloth, was almost alone in receiving the full impact of Christianity, its overpowering impetus. Had he man- aged to subsist in the Chtistian world, he could not have prospered. jto, In the Middle Ages men were not sufficiently virtuous to despise money, but they despised moneyed men. For a while they spared the Jew, because the Jew was a drain for gold, as an abscess is a drain for pus. When the time was ripe, they emptied the Jew, exactly as a surgeon emptied an abscess. I do not approve this method, I merely submit that it was not in contradiction with Church doctrine regarding interest-bearing loans and usury. Short of being abolished, the system was at least stigmatized. It is one thing to tolerate prostitution, but another to deify prostitutes, like the Mediterranean scum, on many occasions in the past, for whom the sale of scented cattle has always been a national industry. Clearly in the days when, with impunity, children could beat back to the ghetto with cabbage-stalks the most opulent capitalist in gabardine, money lacked the moral prestige necessary to its objective. j* Christianity has not eliminated the Rich, nor has it enriched the Poor, for its object has never been the abolition of original sin. Yet Christianity might have indefinitely delayed the subjection of the world to Money, and maintained the hierarchy of human 50 greatness, maintained honour. But thanks to the same mysterious law which provides animals transplanted from temperate to polar regions with an extra coat of fur, the Rich Man, in a climate so unfavourable to his kind, finally acquired a prodigious resistance, a prodi- gious vitality. He had patiently to adjust himself from within to economic conditions, laws, customs, even morality. It would be an exaggeration to sug- gest that he brought about the intellectual revolution which gave birth to experimental science, but from the first he backed it up, and later directed it. Though he may not have created, for instance, the crushing conquest of time and space by machinery, he ex- ploited that conquest whose only use was to gain him power, and which turned the old-time money-lender, glued to his counting-house, into the anonymous master of human savings and labour. Under such onslaughts Christianity perished, and the Church is rocking. What can be done against a power which controls Modern Progress, of which it created the myth, and keeps humanity under the perpetual menace of war, which alone it can influence, war become a normal facet of economic activity, whether one be ‘preparing’ or actually ‘declaring’ it? These views are generally disliked by Conservatives. I wonder why. The shoddiest little shop-keeper will regard as a dangerous ‘public enemy’ an innocent soaker ready to spit in your eye after swilling his week’s pay, to show ‘he’s as good as you are’. For the shop- keeper identifies himself with Mr. Rothschild or Mr. Rockefeller, and his stupid vanity is flattered at the thought. There are many psychological explanations of this peculiarity. In the first place, with the majority of our contemporaries the distinction between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ has finally taken the place of all others. The ‘haves’ think of themselves as lambs for which wolves lie in wait. But in the eyes of poor devils, the lambs become sharks down whose throats they swim. The yawning chasm of blood gaping over the world will devour the lot, and so reconcile them. This morbid obsession, born of fear, profoundly affects social life. PoliLcucss, even, no longer ex- presses a state of mind, a conception of living. It tends to become a succession of rites, that have lost their original meaning: nods and simpers, duckings, standard smiles — reset ved for a numbci of people who have all been taught the same tricks. Dogs behave thus between themselves-— only between themselves, though, for you will rarely catch one sniffing at a cat. In the same way my contemporaries only show off in this particular way to persons of their own class. When I was young I lived in an old and very dear house among trees, a tiny cottage in the country of Artois, full of the murmur of leaves and waters. The old place is no longer mine — never mind that! So long as the new owners treat it well! So long as they don’t hurt it, regard it as a friend and not merely as a convenience. . . . Never mind! Never mind! Every Monday the old folk came to ‘beg their bread’, as wc say over there. Sometimes Ihcy came a long way, from other villages, but I knew them nearly all by name. They were reliable customers. They even helped each other out. ‘I’ve come on account o’ 52 So-an’-So, who’s abed with the rheumatics . 9 When over a hundred appeared, my father used to say: ‘By Jove, things are looking up . 9 I know such memories are of no interest to you: for- give me. But I want you to understand that I was brought up to respect old people, with or without pos- sessions — especially old ladies, and even the hideous minxes of seventy we see to-day have not cured me of that prejudice. Well, at that time I had to address those old beggars with my cap in my hand, and they considered it as natural as I did, and were quite un- moved. Those were the people of ancient France, they knew how to live, and though they may have reeked of tobacco and snuff, they didn’t stink of shops, they hadn’t faces like shop-keepers, sacristans, beadles — faces with that look of having sprouted in basements. They were more like the Valois or the Bourbons, than any respectable member of the middle classes. . . . There are 'Socialist 9 and ‘Conservative 9 capi- talists. But the people as a whole does not really belong to either. The people belongs to itself. It is — the People. All efforts to split it up into classes invented by poli- tical doctrinaires, only serve to set up currents and cross-currents in the great mass, for the benefit of adventurers. My idea of the People is certainly not inspired by democracy. 'Democracy 9 is a high-brow invention, much the same kind of figment as was 'Monarchy 9 in the mind of M. Joseph le Maistre 10 . Real kingship 53 does nol live on political theories, for it has no time to define ‘the people’, and must simply take them as they are, not by taste nor choice, but by reason of some deep vocation, or if you prefer it, by necessity. A king can do nothing without his people. 1 believe — indeed I almost fear — they can do nothing without him. Monarchy has to bargain with the other classes, which because of the complex interests they represent, interests overlapping the national frame- work, must up to a point be considered as separate states within the State. But kings govern by means of their people. You will say: ‘They do not always remember that!’ In which case they perish. They may lose the support of all the other classes, for these can always be set one against the other by skilful manoeuvring. But the people’s needs are too simple, too concrete, of Loo pressing a kind to be dismissed. The people need work, need bread, and need self- respect, a form of honour which best suits them, an honour as simple as work or bread, with as few frills about it. Yet the notaries, attorneys, men of law, who made the French Revolution, thought they could indefinitely postpone attending to such simple matters. They fancied that a people, a people shaped by a thousand years of history, could be clamped into cold storage until convenient. ‘Let’s deal with the “best” people first, we’ll see later on.’ Later on it was too late. In the new mansion built to the designs of the law-givers of Ancient Rome, no room had been provided for ihe people of Ancient France: they would have had to pull it down and start afresh. Nothing surprising in that. The liberal 54 architect was no more preoccupied with the housing of his ‘proletariat’ than the Roman architect bothered about his slaves. But the slaves were merely a pack of helots of all countries and tongues, of all classes, a de- graded, sacrificial portion of humanity, a miserable herd created by man. Whilst modern society is allowing slowly to decompose in the darkness of its cellars, a magnificent creation of nature and history. You may not agree, but I cannot believe monarchy would have permitted the fair countenance of my country to become so grievously deformed. We have had selfish, ambitious, frivolous kings, and some were wicked, but I doubt a line of French princes would ever have lacked the sense of nationhood to the point of letting a handful of bourgeois or petit bourgeois, busi- ness-men or intellectuals, jabbering and gesticulating in the front row, to stand for France, whilst our people, so proud, so sensible, so intuitive, gradually became that anonymous mass called a proletariat. I do not intend to betray the class to which I belong, for I belong to no class; I care nothing for classes, and anyhow there are no more classes. By what can one tell an upper-class gentleman? By his banking- account? By his degree? By his occupation? By his medals? I’m no anarchist. It seems to me perfectly right that the State should look for its civil servants among the more brainy lads of our schools and colleges. Where else could they be found? In any case they are not so very much to be envied. Believe me, had I a magic wand, I would not feel I were bestowing a particular favour on a village blacksmith, singing to the flames of his forge, by changing him into a school- 55 teacher. Though I readily admit that such people ought to be treated with more consideration than the blacksmith or myself, because discipline is an aid to work and saves time both for those who order and those who obey. When you’re wailing at the counter in a post-office I hope you never argue with the man in charge, but un- obtrusively wait to be noticed, or at most draw his attention with a discreet little cough. If lie considers your behaviour a tribute to his intelligence and per- sonality — why, he’s ever so mistaken. The middle classes arc mistaken in somewhat the same way. Be- cause they provide the largest number of overseers and persons in control, they arc liable to regard themselves as a national aristocracy, with the greatest number of leaders in their ranks. But they arc not leaders — they arc merely technicians, which is not the same thing. When I say there arc no more classes, I am ex- pressing ihe general feeling. There arc no more classes because the people is not a class, in the exact sense of the word, and the upper classes have slowly mingled into one most aptly named ‘middle’. A middle class is not a class at all, and still less an aristocracy. It could not even provide the first essentials of the latter. Nothing is further removed from its spirit than the spirit of aiislocracy. One might define it thus: ‘All decently educated citizens, able to do anything, and interchangeable.’ The same definition applies equally well to what is called demo- cracy. Democracy is the natural state of persons who can be used for anything. When there are a sufficient number they assemble and form a democracy. The 56 mechanism of universal suffrage suits them perfectly, because it is logical, and these interchangeable people finally rely on the vote to find out what each of them is. They could just as easily draw lots. There is no people’s democracy: a true democracy of the people is inconceivable. A man of the people is not able to do anything, and can only talk about what he knows. He realizes that elections favour the gift of the gab. A chap always talking at his work is a lazybones. Left to himself, a man of the people would have the same conception of power as the aristocrat — whom he recalls, for that matter, in so many ways: power is for whoever goes and gets it, who feels strong enough to take it. That is why the word ‘dictator 9 does not mean the same thing to him as it does to us. The dictatorship of which the people dream — is their own. Politicians will turn that dream into a very different reality. I agree. But the shade of difference is a revelation, all the same. I am not writing this for the ‘working classes’, who would never read it, anyhow. I want to state clearly that no national life is possible or even conceivable once the people have lost their true character, their racial and cultural originality, and have become no more than a vast cistern of besotted hacks, with a tiny sprinkling of future bourgeois to complete them. It doesn’t matter as much as you imagine for the elite to possess no national distinction. The dlite of the twelfth century were not particularly ‘national’, nor were those of the sixteenth, in Prance. It is the people who give to each country its inimitable shape. . . . Whatever faults one may find with Monarchy, such 57 a regime was at least able to guard intact this most precious heritage, for even in the middle of the eight- eenth century, when clergy, nobility, law and intel- lectuals were all showing signs of putrefaction, the man of the people was hardly any different from his medieval ancestor. It is a despairing thought, indeed, that out of the most stable of human compounds, we have managed to create au ungovernable rabble kept in check by machine-guns. Jt* Little by little a bourgeois proletariat has grown up opposite the ‘working-class’ proletariat. It has neither the stability of the older middle classes nor its family traditions, still less its commercial honesty. It is constantly renewed by the tricks of economic anarchy, and led by the nose, in the same way as the other. How can one describe this mass of little shop- keepers, multiplied beyond all measure by post-War inflation, and in vain decimated each day by bank- ruptcy? Why call them shop-keepers? A shop- keeper used to be productive. Difficulties of storage, rarity of goods, their diversity, in the days when mass- production did not exist, the exacting demands of customers in the habit of passing down from genera- tion to generation the simplest domestic articles, the strict control of provincial criticism, the natural inter- mingling of friendship and marriage, obligation to follow, at least in appearance, the precepts of the Decalogue regarding the property of others — all this made of trade a real art. To-day almost any raga- muffin can boast of belonging to such a corporation, so 58 long as he can rent premises and write himself down as tenth or twentieth intermediary between the manu- facturers, desperately under-cutting the others, and the stupid customer whose destiny it is to be robbed. Don’t be misguided by the appearance of some filthy den, a dilapidated shop-window with broken glass, the feeble tinkle of a broken bell and the incongruous stink of onions and cats each time the door is opened. Certain cobwebs paradoxically woven across corners, apparently inaccessible even to flies, denote how the patient waiting of the spider always wins in the end. There is no doubt that over-brilliant displays put off some poor kind folk bred in the illusion — so pathetic, come to think of it! — that the small shop-keeper makes the smallest profits. The proof that these snares nourish the insect lurking within, is the remarkable spreading of these shop-keepers since the War, a factor of which it is easy to convince yourself by a glance at the directory. No doubt bankruptcy lies in wait for this kind of spider, and he doesn’t always get his four square meals. But he will hang on till the end, though he search the dustbins for his goods when credit is denied him. This is no exaggeration. Supposing, for instance, all official control of butchers’ meat were suddenly to cease, whatever your sympathy for the retailer, you are bound to admit that he would soon fish out of the darkest corners of his ice-house, the full flowerings of putrefaction. But that you should agree or not makes no differ- ence. We saw. We saw him emerge. We saw him with our own eyes. We saw him emerge from the wreckage of villages, dodging the shells, the small shop- keeper, released for a few mouths from the indifferent eyes of the law, from the competition of his fellows, and even from the complaints of customers; for be- tween ourselves you couldn’t expect much in the way of ‘complaint’ from the ragged fighters in the trenches. We were young, and many of those fellows had grey hair. They had daughters too. We saw them. They had hold of the right end of the stick, as we say. Our only revenge was that when things were at their worst and all supplies of both food and water were suspended, hunger drove them to eat their own stufF, and thirst to drink their own wine, poor in alcohol but rich in mushroom growth and mould. Then they would swell up with unhealthy fat which trickled in grey sweat down their heavy cheeks as they ‘talked their shop’ with an ugly smile of dirty tcctli. For they showed their contempt of us almost openly, deplored our bad behaviour, and every spring made a point of displaying in their front windows, in readiness for the coming attack, a hideous selection of funeral wreaths, probably manufactured in prisons. It is no good saying that the cesspool of war always hatches such larvae. The fact is you haven’t known them. You never sat with them, after closing time, between the wife tormented by varicose veins, and the young lady with body-odour, and drained the meagre dregs of ‘goodwill’. Those folk were unfortunately lacking in imagination, and therefore hardly acces- sible to compassion, but they in no way resembled the plunderers of dead bodies that used to follow the armies. God! They wouldn’t have risked a shoot- ing, or even six months’ imprisonment! They yearned fio for the esteem of their ‘betters’, had no pity for the crowd, were hard on young people who wasted their money, and never forgave wives and daughters who misbehaved, or bad debts. Don’t ask me what became of them. It is hardly feasible they should all have perished on Armistice Day! Inflation spews them up, deflation swallows them down again. Quite so. And you can recognize them no more, for they don’t stand out from the rest of us. They were not monsters. The circumstances were monstrous, and they submitted to them; or rather, adapted to them their tiny store of ideas. They conformed their soul. They were not adven- turers or rebels, for as soon as they had made their pile, they settled down and married off their daughters to solicitors. Then they would dream of the past, as a mature man dreams of his youth and his loves. ‘Remember that stock of smoked salmon the Com- missariat turned down, and wc bought it back on the sly, six sous a tin on an average. We cleared fifteen thousand francs out of that little deal.’ It would be interesting to know how many of those merchants slipped back into the proletariat from whence they came. For my part I think they are firmly welded to the middle classes. And for them the dictatorship of the proletariat is not so much to be feared as the advent of the People to liberty, inde- pendence and honour. France cannot be rebuilt from the top; she must be rebuilt from her foundations. It will be more 6t expensive, but we can’t help that. Let it cost what it will. It won’t be so expensive as civil war. Our upright middle classes think it quite natural that Signor Mussolini’s imperial itch should induce France and England to huge armament expenditure. They’re not at all annoyed with Signor Mussolini. They don’t consider him in any way responsible for our increasing misfortune. ‘It’s all these social re- forms. The people are in the hands of most danger- ous leaders.’ And what are you doing to get them away?* ‘We’ll attend to that later. We haven’t time, and since the Left make the most of the scare of Fascism, we exploit our people’s fear of Communism, it’s only fair. Anyhow, the working classes don’t really trust us. If we went over to their side, we’d lose far more bourgeois support than we’d gain in proletarian sup- port. You can’t go in for social reform with no money.’ Why didn’t you start when you had some? ‘We’re not standing idle, by any means. We do all we can — with propaganda.’ No doubt. When the people think just as you do, the social problem will be almost solved, and how cheaply! jf* Saint Dominic once dreamt of a like reform of Christian society, a vast restoration of doctrine. In the same way as the Communists to-day, the Heretics of the time threatened the faith and the possessions of the upper classes. The latter soon made it quite clear to their governments that the Faith question 60 could remain in abeyance, but the salving of Property required more powerful measures. Thus was born a vast purging, rather like the one I have just seen in Spain, known to history as the Inquisition. If the Right Wing to-day are going to use the same formula, they will be signing their own abdication. ‘But supposing there is no other way?’ Then give it up. We are beginning to realize that peace between nations has to be purchased every twenty years by the sacrifice of a few million young men. If Social Peace is going to be as expensive, the system cannot be worth much. Get out, all of you! 63 II j&. jg* I stxive to express myself without irony. For irony never touches the heart. Too often it is the cry of a heart that is wounded. Now is unveiled to the world the tragedy without beginning or end, because it has neither object nor meaning. At least none that can be confessed. It is a war of despair, a blood- stained alibi of adversaries reduced to impotence, powerless to create, some opposed to all retreat, the others to all advance, yet both unable to define, or even to conceive, either advance or retreat. They all cry, hand over heart: ‘My intentions! My intentions ! 5 Who cares if your intentions were good? What matters is who shall exploit them. And what has become of your ‘intentions 5 , between ourselves, you wise men? They run riot all over the world. Your good intentions have gone crazy. You may whisde for them — they will not return. Nationalism, for instance, bred in the old gentle Lorraine homesteads of Maurice Barres, nourished with so much precious ink — what a long way it has drifted since, all the way to Japan and China! For the powerful masters of gold and universal opinion soon tore it from the hands of philosophers and poets. My Lorraine! My Pro- vence! My Country! The place where my dead are laid! But they cry: ‘My phosphates! My petrol! My iron ! 5 64. When I was fifteen we were fighting against indi- vidualism, and individualism, alas, was already dead. Each European country carried a perfectly-formed embryo totalitarian state in her belly. Had you laid your ear at the height of the navel, you would surely have heard the first heart-beats. . . . And Liberalism! God, how we flogged that horse. Unluckily he cared no longer for our blows. He lay in a coma, and died at the first shot of the Great War. Yes, our intentions were pure, too innocent. We shouldn’t have allowed them out by themselves. What is left of them now? I don’t say this to disturb the Theorists. What would be the object? It is absurd to believe with Jean-Jacques Rousseau that man is born good. He is born capable of good and evil far beyond the imag- ination of Moralists, for he was not created in their image, but in the image of God. And his corruptor is not merely the disturbing influence within — instinct, desire, whatever you like to call it — his corrupter is the greatest among the angels, fallen from Heavens’ highest peak. The teachings of history are certainly of some profit to law-makers and politicians, but man always exceeds in some direction the definitions with which they hope to encircle him. At least the ‘man’ of whom I speak. He isn’t seeking ‘happiness’, as you like to imagine, he wants joy, and the joy of man is not of this world, or at least not entirely of this world. Of course you are free to believe in the homo sapiens of the humanists, but you would be mistaken in giving to the word the same meaning as I do, for your order is not mine and your disorder is not mine — and what you call evil is merely a void: an empty space within, 65 e like the imprint of a seal in wax. I am not suggesting that your definitions are absurd, but we shall never share the same ones. For I can use yours, whilst you will never be able to use mine. They enabled you to attain to greatness for a while — a while only — for your civilizations are crumbling at the very time when you fancied them immortal, like those glorious chil- dren who have a fatal weakness concealed in them, and never live to see their youth. And so you relinquish your place to the ink-consumers who spend centuries arguing over the disaster, and suggesting whys and wherefores. But you can achieve nothing lasting for the happi- ness of men, because you have no idea of their unhap- piness. Have I made myself clear? Our share of happiness, our paltry happiness, arises from all parts of the earth, and returns therein with us on the last day, but the essence of our unhappiness is supernatural. Those who have a clear distinctive vision of it, in the manner of Descartes 1 1 , are not alone to bear its weight. Quite the contrary. For the greatest misfortune is submission to injustice, not the suffering of it. Sub- mission without understanding! I believe that to be the only form of damnation in this life. -fc* J&, Over there, in Majorca, I saw lorry-loads of men pass over the Rambla. They rumbled like thunder on a level with the many-coloured terraces, freshly washed and running with water, gay with the murmur of country fairs. The lorries were grey with road-dust, the men too were grey, sitting four by four, grey caps slung on crosswise, hands spread over their 66 tent-cloth trousers, patiently. They were kidnapping them every day from lost villages, at the time when they came in from the fields. They set off for their last journey, shirts still clinging to their shoulders with perspiration, arms still full of the day’s toil, leaving the soup untouched on the table, and a woman, breath- less, a minute too late, at the garden wall, with the little bundle of belongings hastily twisted into a bright new napkin: A Dios! Recuerdos! The sentimental appeal? God preserve me from it! I merely wish to say, and I shall never tire of saying, that those people had neither killed nor hurt anybody. They were country-folk like those you know, or rather like those your fathers knew, those your fathers shook hands with, for they made me think of the hard- chiselled faces in our French villages. Remember, they had just been given their republic — Viva la republica ! — and in the evening of July 18, 1936, it was still the government recognized by every- body, acclaimed by the army, approved by chemists, doctors, professors, by all the intellectuals. ‘There is no doubt they were quite decent fellows,’ the Spanish bishops will probably answer, ‘for the majority were converted in extremis. According to the report of our Venerable Brother of Majorca, only ten per cent of those dear children refused the last sacraments before being dispatched by our good officers.’ A remarkable percentage, I agree, and one which does great honour to your lordships. May God reward you! I am not judging, at least for the moment, this form of apostolate. But presuming it were shortly to be adopted over here, I have every right to 67 wonder what results we French catholics are likely to achieve. I am writing these last pages at T oulon. Supposing, for instance, on his return from Salamanca, where M. Charles Maurras I * * * * * * * * * * 12 is bound one of these days to go and pay his respects to the great General Franco, the author of Anlinea were to undertake a purging of his native town, on the same lines. I doubt the cure of Martigues would achieve such comforting results. Greater stringency would therefore be required. (Not that I consider M. Maurras in the least capable of exterminating the population of Martigues. He will continue to spend his hard-working days between the rue de Verneuil, the Croissant printing-works and — I hope — the Acadimie Frangaise , whose echoing vaults have just been thrown open to him.) I shall not always attempt to justify the follow- ing pages by reasoned logic, still less by the feeling which drives me to write them. Once again — but on this occasion more than ever before — I shall speak my own tongue, knowing that it will only be heard of those who speak it with me, who spoke it long before they read my books, and will still speak it when I am no more, when the frail memory of myself and my works will have slipped into oblivion. They alone matter to me. I do not disdain the others. Far from dis- daining, I would wish to understand them better, for to understand is already to love. That which parts human beings and makes enemies of them has perhaps no profound reality. The differ- ences on which ineffectually labour our judgment and 68 experience, would disperse like dreams if we could look upon them with eyes that were sufficiently free, for the greatest of our misfortunes is only to be able to give others such a restricted idea of ourselves, inter- spersed by gaps of horrible silence. I write these new chapters of the ‘Great Fear’ neither for the pleasure nor even the taste of it, but because the time is ripe for them, and I have no pretensions of controlling my life. None, apart from saints, have ever controlled their lives. All life is under the sign of desire or fear, unless it be under the sign of love. And is not love both desire and fear? My life doesn’t matter. I merely wish it to be faithful until the end, to the child I was. For what I possess of honour, and my paltry share of courage, I inherit from the small being, so mysterious now, who ran through the September rain across flooded fields, his heart heavy at the thought of approaching school, of dismal courtyards where dark winter would bid him welcome, of stinking classrooms, of refectories with greasy breath, of interminable, ostentatious high masses, where the goaded young soul knew of nothing to share with God but weariness — from the child I was, who is now for me like a grandfather. Why should I have changed? Why should I change? My hours are numbered, the holidays will surely come to an end, and the dark porch awaiting me is darker even than the other. Why should I waste my time with grave men, whom here in Spain we call: Hombres dignos , hour ados? Now, as always, their frivolity re- volts me. Only then I was revolted without knowing why. Besides, X feared some day X would become one of them. ‘When you’re my age,’ they said. . . . Well, 69 I am. I can look them in the eyes, knowing I have escaped them for ever. I cai e nothing for their wisdom which, like their faces, bears the stamp of austere cunning, ever disappointed, ever vain. I am not hoping for my judgment to be infallible, were I to attempt any judgment. (I could, of course, like many another, show up in the manner of an ex- pert recorder, tastes and depravities, misunderstand- ings and spites, and then, all quivering with indigna- tion, pronounce irrevocable sentences in the name of Reason.) I shall not try to attract sympathy. Nor shall I attempt to shock. I have nothing new to tell. The sorrows of which I shall speak arc doubtless hardly any different from many that have already over- taken us. I am not preventing you from turning your back on them. When I was thirteen my teacher — so wise and young, of eternal youth, the youth of religion, the only kind able to capture a child’s heart — gave me France of the Jews to read. It unveiled for me injustice, in the pre- cise sense of the word; not the abstract injustice of moralists and philosophers, but Injustice itself, a living thing, with eyes of steel. Had I faced those eyes alone, no doubt my fate would have been the same as many who throughout the centuries have broken themselves, one after another, against those inflexible ramparts. Later I realized how solitary thinkers are the particular prey of this female Satan, of which the male is Deceit. What does she care for the others? To this Creature, as old as time, of what importance are the weaklings which she devours as easily as a whale a shoal of young salmon? Either injustice is but another name for Stupidity 70 — but I dare not believe it, for she is eternally laying her traps, timing her attack, now rearing, now creeping, wearing all disguises, even that of charity — or she is what I believe, and has a will, a conscience, a monstrous memory somewhere concealed in Creation. If you come to think of it, you will agree that this must be so, that I am expressing in my own words a fact of experience. Who dare deny that evil is an organized thing, a universe of greater reality than that which greets the senses, with its sinister landscapes, pale slues, cold sun, and cruel stars? A kingdom both of the spirit and the flesh, of prodigious density, of infinite weight, beside which the kingdoms of the earth are mere figments and symbols. To this kingdom nothing is really opposed save the"
