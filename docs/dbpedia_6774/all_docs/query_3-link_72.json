        "text": "This article considers the recent work of Algerian exile Alek Baylee Toumi, who has rewritten and continued Camus’s short story ‘l’Hôte’ (“The Guest”) as a play entitled Albert Camus: entre la mère et l’injustice (“Albert Camus: between the mother and injustice”). Published soon after the ‘décennie noire’, the period of resurgent Algerian violence in the 1990s, it is argued that Toumi’s work elucidates ‘l’Hôte’ as a story that continues to tackle taxing moral and political questions in the context of resurgent conflict, reframing Camus as a prophetic ‘Algerian’ figure of the late 1950s. We conclude on a note of caution, however: while, on the surface, claiming to ‘clarify’ Camus’s position on Algeria, Toumi’s work seems a more likely example of the broader phenomenon of ‘figuring’ and blurring a version of an idealised Algeria alongside the real Algeria of the recent civil war, where Camus himself becomes an ambivalent ‘hôte’ (guest/host) of Algerian writing. The article summarises this new phenomenon and questions the effectiveness of the approach taken for the realisation of the stated aims of bringing a posthumous ‘Camus’ back to the land of his birth as a means of restoring peace in a war-torn contemporary Algeria.\n\nEver since the publication of his allegedly racist, anti-semitic passages in La Campagne de France and the intense media storm to which it gave rise in 2000, 1 Renaud Camus has been on the defensive: he has tried in earnest to explain his passion for France and her culture; he has attempted to rationalize his reverence for the “French” experience,“telle qu'elle fut vécue pendant une quinzaine de siècles par le peuple français sur le sol de France”(Du sens 487).\n\nDavid Oelhoffen’s 2014 film Far From Men (Loin des Hommes) departs from the letter of Camus’ 1957 story, “The Guest/Host”. Yet it does remarkable cinematic justice to its spirit, and to the last, often maligned 'Algerian' Camus. Oelhoffen’s Daru and the Arab character Mohamed, it is suggested, represent embodiments of Camus’ idealised Algerian 'first men', in the vision Camus was developing in Le Premier Homme. Part 1 frames the film in light of Camus’ “The Guest/Host”. Part 2 frames Camus’ story in light of Camus’ agonised struggle to come to terms with the Algerian situation. Part 3 makes the case that Oelhoffen’s departures from Camus’ original story present in cinematic form Camus’ ideal of a post-colonial solidarity between peoples, predicated on the overcoming of all arche-ideological fantasies of untainted prelapsarian community.\n\nThe Pieds-Noirs, or former French citizens of Algeria, are a diverse community brought together not as much by their common experience in Algeria as by their common exile from their homeland during and after the Algerian War for Independence (1954-1962). Multiple intellectual voices emerged in the years during and after the war, and the new community of “Pieds-Noirs” became defined by their separation from and nostalgia for the homeland. Resulting from the traumas of colonization, decolonization, and discrimination, separation plays a major role in the philosophical vantage points of Algerian-born authors Albert Camus, Jacques Derrida, and Hélène Cixous, among others. This article demonstrates that both separation and return inevitably influence exile writing, but for those who suffered multiple separations both in and outside the colony, there is no singular location to which they may return. As such the perpetual motion of return, without hope of arrival, destabilizes the sense of nostalgia in their writing."
