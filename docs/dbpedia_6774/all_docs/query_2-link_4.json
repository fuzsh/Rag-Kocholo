        "text": "THE 1980-81 literary season in France has been framed in thunderbolts. In September ''Les Nouvelles Litteraires'' ran the stark headline ''La Theorie Est Foutue'' (''Theory Is All Washed Up'') to summarize a long interview with Christian Bourgois, a publisher who had invested heavily in literary theory. A few weeks later the influential Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser strangled his wife in their apartment in the Ecole Normale Superieure and was promptly locked up in St. Anne's mental hospital. Every newspaper in Paris editorialized about the relations between intellectuals, insanity, Marxism and educational institutions. The shock this spring has been the stinging verdict by a Paris court against Francoise Sagan for ''illicit reproduction'' (plagiarism) in her last novel, ''Le Chien Couchant.'' All remaining copies and the printer's plates must be destroyed. Sagan is already enmeshed in a nasty contractual suit with her publisher, Flammarion, and has announced that a different house will publish her new book, an 800-page novel.\n\nEvery season includes news items. But anyone coming back to Paris after three or four years will immediately notice the presence of two new forces on the literary scene: television and the FNAC discount stores. Every Friday night at 10 o'clock for 80 minutes, two to five million people watch Bernard Pivot's lively program, ''Apostrophes.'' (A rival program on Wednesday evening has a smaller audience.) Pivot usually chooses three or four known and unknown authors of recent books linked by a common theme or genre and, with a wide-eyed innocent expression, asks barbed questions that are both literary and personal. Only crusty hermits like Samuel Beckett refuse to participate in these discussions, which are watched by a majority of French intellectuals. An author's appearance on ''Apostrophes'' usually turns his book into a best seller, at least for a few days, sometimes for much longer. Examples include the philosopher Vladimir Jankelevitch and a young woman who broke down on camera when she began describing the book she had written about her mongoloid sister. Even the American Public Broadcasting Service has no literary program remotely comparable to ''Apostrophes'' for selling power and for gauging and setting literary fashion.\n\nThe FNAC discount phenomenon has resulted directly from President Giscard d'Estaing's 1979 decision to treat books ''like any other product'' and to free their prices. The FNAC corporation now has three book-record-audiovisual supermarkets in Paris with wall-to-wall carpeting and impressive stock in most fields. Only tourists use the bookstalls on the quais. Last Saturday afternoon, when everyone should have been out in the warm April sun, I estimated 850 people of all ages browsing, sitting on the floor reading, and buying books in the labyrinthine FNAC store in Le Forum des Halles.\n\nWith television and FNAC to help, overall book sales are not faltering. But several alert publishers' and authors' groups, as well as most of the recent presidential candidates (though not Giscard d'Estaing), have insisted that the freezing of prices is driving small bookstores out of business and forcing publishers to be less venturesome. The book trade has a large stake in the elections.\n\nAll in all, the present literary season has produced enough jousting, posturing and scandal to hold its own against political news. Yet the liveliness does not spring from any swarming around a major literary movement or theory, like surrealism or existentialism, structuralism or the New Novel. This unfamiliar situation probably explains why a good number of resident pundits say that French literature is in the doldrums. On the other hand, many authors and editors welcome this openness and variety as healthy. In the interval, something seems to have happened. An unsatisfactory but significant survey of 500 prominent figures in the world of books in this month's ''Lire,'' a literary magazine edited by the same Bernard Pivot, reveals that the four most influential living writers in France are university professors in the human sciences. Only four out of the first ten are literary figures. The ranking in descending order: 1) Claude Levi-Strauss, anthropologist; 2) Raymond Aron, political scientist; 3) Michel Foucault, historian; 4) Jacques Lacan, psychoanalyst; 5) Simone de Beauvoir, novelist and essayist; 6) Marguerite Yourcenar, novelist; 7) Fernand Braudel, historian; 8) Michel Tournier, novelist; 9, a tie) Henri Michaux, poet, and Bernard-Henri Levy, philosopher.\n\nFrench writers have not, as in the United States, repaired in great numbers to teach in universities. On the other hand the universities now provide the foremost ''maitres a penser,'' or intellectual leaders, for the first time in French history. Since Abelard and Rabelais the academy has been the enemy. Henri Bergson, whose lectures at the College de France attracted attentive crowds, was an exception. By tradition, intellectual freedom in France belongs to the freelance writer, not the tenured professor. Does this recent shift mean that we shall hear no more French writers speak with the individual authority of Zola and Gide and Sartre in their day?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
