        "meta_description": "The rediscovery of El Greco was very important to the development of painting in the last third of the nineteenth century and throughout much of the twentieth. Following the fascination Velázquez held for the realist painters, El Greco – who was then little known – attracted the most innovative artists, such as Manet and Cézanne.…",

        "text": "During the Romantic period, the opening of King Louis Philippe’s Spanish Gallery at the Louvre (1838) displaying nine works by El Greco (including the reduced version of the Adoration of the Name of Jesus, now in London) or attributed to him (such as Lady in a Fur Wrap) led writers like Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire and painters like Eugène Delacroix to develop an interest in the artist. He later made a highly visible impact on Édouard Manet, who saw his works in Madrid and Toledo in 1865, and on Paul Cézanne, who copied Lady in a Fur Wrap in 1882. El Greco also drew the attention of certain Spanish artists, such as Mariano Fortuny and his circle (especially Ricardo de Madrazo), who appreciated his rich, fresh colouring, as did other artists who visited Spain, among them the American William Merritt Chase, who came several times from 1881 onwards.\n\nFollowing Cézanne’s death, the perceived links between his work and El Greco’s were crucial for the emergence of modern painting, as both artists also decisively influenced Cubism and Expressionism.\n\nPicasso and Cubism\n\nPablo Picasso, the most important artist of the twentieth century, was also the one most greatly influenced by El Greco throughout his career. His contact with El Greco’s painting during his formative years in Madrid made him aware of the excellence of the artist’s works, which were still little appreciated. Picasso’s drawings and his paintings of 1898 and 1899 show his early obsession with El Greco, which became very intense during his Blue Period, between 1901 and 1904. His original approach can be seen in Evocation. Later on in 1906, during the Gósol period, he developed an interest in the plasticity of his figures. El Greco’s oeuvre played a prominent role in the emergence and shaping of Cubism and also in its dissemination, as some of the artists influenced by Picasso, such as Derain, Modigliani, Rivera and the Czech Cubists, also drew inspiration from the Cretan artist. After Cubism, Picasso used El Greco’s portraits as a basis for introducing references to Spanishness in his art. In his late period, when addressing the musketeer theme, he returned to El Greco’s A Gentleman with his Hand on his Chest interpreting it very freely and employing a note of humour that is both sarcastic and melancholic."
