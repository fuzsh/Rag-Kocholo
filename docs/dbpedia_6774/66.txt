1 undated business card (89 x 52 mm) :

Dear Mr Vanier, I am very grateful for the lovely volume you have sent me. Yes, I would be very pleased to receive "Hommes d'aujourd'hui", especially the friends whose portraits I have more or less missed. I'd like to talk to you about Hepp. Why don't you come to my place one morning when you're passing through the neighbourhood? I'd be happy to have you for lunch. I won't set a date because your time must be taken up. But write to me the day before to be sure - and as soon as possible. Until midday, almost without exception, I am 14 rue Chaptal.

to you

Letters to Vanier and Barrès:

Adrien Remacle (1855-1916) - founder and director of the La Revue contemporaine, letter signed "The Director" to Maurice Barres

Paris, 1885

M

As we ask you to accept this tribute to the first issue of the Revue Contemporaine, we have come to ask you whether it would not be appropriate for you to follow the Revue and co-operate in a purely literary undertaking, that of bringing together in a publication that is rigorously supervised in terms of content and form all the writers of genuine merit from the younger generations and all the survivors of previous generations.

We know from one of our senior editors how much you care about literary matters, and we hope you will take an interest in our work.

I look forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance.

Our compliments to you, Sir

The Director

Mr Maurice Barrès, Director of Tâches d'Encre, 76 rue N. D. des Champs, Paris.

To settle your account definitively, Mr d'Orfer would need to know what you had to pay for No. 4 of Taches d'Encre.

At the same time, he would like to know if you would like the copies of the newsstands (1st No.) to be collected. There are 200 or 250 copies and the cost of collection would be 6 or 7 fr. gross. We will comply with your decision. Yours sincerely

M. A Pouget and H. Vidal.

Paris, 22 May 1885

Mr Maurice Barrès, Director of the Revue Les Tâches d'Encre. 76 rue N. D. des Champs.

M. Barrès asks me in his letter to let you know when you can collect the last copies of No. 1 of the Inkblots, which I shall hasten to do: they will be delivered to you from tomorrow, any day; but the sooner the better.

Mr Barrès

Paris

I would ask you to have the ink stains removed from No. 2 by the 15th for the agreed price of 60f, but as I cannot keep them indefinitely I will put them in the waste paper.

I have the honour of greeting you.
