        "text": "His southern accent is fake. He also isn't 1/10th as dumb as he makes himself to be. The reason why I don't like Larry the Cable Guy, is because he's a gimmick.\n\nrummy said:\n\nYeah, this whole \"blue collar\" thing's gotta stop.\n\nespecially because they're not blue collar.\n\nTheir crowd, is blue collar... but they themselves... aren't. It's like they're poking fun at their audience 24/7 and they don't even realize it.\n\nUncle Joey.\n\nDan Whitney wasn't all that funny in that stand-up, not as funny as he is in the movie Larry the Cable Guy.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the Blue Collar shit, but I do like Ron White\n\nI can go for some Doritos right now...\n\nmmmmm tacos rule\n\nMykie said:\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the Blue Collar shit, but I do like Ron White\n\nThat's because Ron White just gets drunk and says stupid shit.\n\n\"If life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Then find someone whose life is giving them vodka, and throw a party.\"\n\nI won't hate. I think LtCG is funny as shit. Yes, of course he's a gimmick. So what? He's a gimmick artfully made to be amusing. If anyone thinks that's how he really is, well, ya might be a redneck.\n\nThat up there, though? Not so much amusing.\n\nIf you think about it, the Larry character is pretty cool. It's hard to pull off a show like that. Not using your voice/accent, clothing, probably exaggerating life experiences to fit into the character, etc."
