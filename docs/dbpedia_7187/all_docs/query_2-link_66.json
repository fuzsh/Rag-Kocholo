        "text": "Daniel Lawrence Whitney, better known as Larry the Cable Guy and the voice of Mater from Disney Pixar’s smash hit movie franchise “Cars,” will perform at the Des Moines Civic Center on Monday night.\n\nAs one-fourth of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour troupe (sometimes dubbed as the “Redneck Rat Pack”) — which also included Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Ron White — Larry has become one of the most popular stand-up comedians in the nation.\n\nDuring a recent phone interview with the Register, Larry talked about his stand-up act, his golf game, his success as the voice of Mater and more.\n\nNo place like home\n\nAlthough Larry still enjoys performing stand-up, he’s more selective these days with his touring and performs only about 30 dates per year. This way, the self-professed homebody can spend more time with his wife and two children, ages 12 and 13.\n\n“I still like doing stand-up, if I didn't like doing it I'd probably just retire and go do something else,” Larry said. “Plus, that’s all I know. I've been doing (stand-up) since 1985, but 30 days is perfect. I don't want to miss my kids growing up. I (also) do about five celebrity golf tournaments a year and then the rest of the time I just hang with my family here at the house. I don't leave the house a lot, let’s put it that way. When I’m home, I’m home.”\n\nLaying low\n\nLarry has kept a low profile since 2017 when it comes to doing movies or television. However, he does have a few ideas brewing that he’s been pitching to executives recently.\n\n“I told them I didn't really want to do any more movies because those take six weeks and you have to live on a bus for six weeks somewhere and I didn't want to do that,” Larry said. “I did pitch a couple of shows only because they said that we would be able to film them in Nebraska and so I wouldn't have to go anywhere. I pitched another show that we are going to shoot some pilot episodes. It was the one show that I didn't really want to do, but I've got my father-in-law involved in it. I can't announce it yet, but I'm doing something and I’m not going to be gone for a long time. I can sporadically do it. That'll be coming up next year.”\n\nOn the air\n\nLarry occupies his spare time with his radio show with his former Blue Collar Comedy buddy Jeff Foxworthy called \"Jeff and Larry's Comedy Roundup\" on SiriusXM Channel 97. It’s just one more endeavor that serves as a different creative outlet for the comedian.\n\n“We just signed a new deal with them,” Larry said. “It's a pretty popular channel on Sirius, the fans have been really cool with that show. It’s something completely different. It's not really stand-up. I was part of a morning show years ago. I used to go in the station in Orlando, Florida, and I was the sidekick. When I wasn't on the road doing stand-up, I would go in and do that for some extra money. It kind of takes me back to my early days and I enjoy doing that kind of stuff. My character started on radio stations. I like going in there and messing around for a couple of hours.”\n\nDoing the blue-collar thing\n\nThe Blue Collar Comedy Tour was so successful, it made tremendous stars out of the four comedians, especially in the Midwest and southern parts of the United States. The troupe hasn’t done anything together since its 2012 “Them Idiots World Tour,\" and Bill Engvall recently told the Register that perhaps a one-off show with the four of them would be a possibility in the near future.\n\n“It’s something that we have discussed, but it's just that we're all doing so many different things,” Larry said. “It's always hard to get our schedules together. But I'm with Bill, I wouldn't rule it out. There's a lot of factors that would have to go into getting back. That was fun, and we had a great time and we're all friends and we've always remained friends. Sometimes you kind of think, ‘Well, we don't want to do it just because people would say, ‘They were funny before.’ You want to end it on a good note and just have the memories. But I wouldn't be surprised if at some point while none of us are in wheelchairs yet, I wouldn't be surprised that you might see us do a one-off.”\n\nHitting the links\n\nThere are many celebrities who are great golfers, some of them with a good shot at actually turning pro if they wanted to. Larry loves to get out on the course, and he can hang with the best of them, too. Rocker Alice Cooper and actor Ray Romano are two such avid golfers whom Larry has played with before during numerous charity golf tournaments. One of Larry’s favorite charity tournaments is the annual PGA Tour Champions golf tournament, The Principal Charity Classic, held here in Des Moines.\n\n“Alice is awesome, I hosted his Christmas Pudding show last year and I’ve golfed in his golf tournament a couple of times,” Larry said. “There's a lot of guys that you wouldn’t think golf that golf. At my charity event I get such an eclectic cast of characters that enjoy golf. A lot of the old rock and rollers, a lot of the classic rock guys, a lot of them golf. REO Speedwagon plays my golf tournament every year. Pat Benatar and her husband, they're golfers. Don Felder from the Eagles. I used to hate golf, and then I got into it in 2010, I started learning how to play golf and I’m deep in it now. One minute I hate it so much, but the next minute I love it.”\n\nMater in the house\n\nLarry admitted that his role as Mater in “Cars” is one of the best things he’s done in his career. Larry’s voice is so ubiquitous with the movie that he even has his own ride at Cars Land at the Disneyland Resort in Southern California.\n\n“Now that I got kids, it's really cool to be able to have done some project that my kids and other kids know,” he said. “Because I like kids, and it just drew in a whole different audience. It was probably one of the funnest things and coolest things I got to do. Just for the sheer fact, there's a lot of huge celebrities out there that are dying to do Pixar movies and they've never been able to do them. Not only did I get to do the one, I got to do three of them and oh my God, to voice the whole theme park. It's pretty cool, man. I'm very blessed and thankful.”\n\nWhat to expect at the Civic Center\n\nIf you’re already a fan of Larry the Cable Guy, then you can’t go wrong seeing this show. All his hilarious one-liners and quirky life observations will be present.\n\n“I don't stray too far from what I always do,” Larry said. “I talk a lot about family. I'm doing a whole bunch of stuff now about doctors, visiting waiting rooms. I got a huge bit about going to the fair. Most of everything I'm talking about is the fair, Walmart, my family and growing older. Everything I’m doing has never been on an album. I'm working on a brand-new act. I'm just trying to get it all shaped together for my special that I'm going to tape in December. But (Des Moines fans) will love it. If they like me, they'll love it. I can promise you'll laugh at it.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Larry the Cable Guy\n\nWhen: Monday, Dec. 2 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Des Moines Civic Center, 221 Walnut St., Des Moines"
