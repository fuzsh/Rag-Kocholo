        "text": "Dan Whitney is the comdedian who created Larry the Cable Guy. Check out the last statement of his bio. I guess if you can create a redneck character that earns millions, you have to be brilliant! LOL\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm1249256/bio\n\nBirth Name\n\nDaniel Lawrence Whitney\n\nNickname\n\nLarry\n\nThe Freight Train of Comedy\n\nHeight\n\n5' 10\" (1.78 m)\n\nSpouse\n\nCara Whitney (2005 - present) 2 children\n\nTrade Mark\n\nHis catchphrase, \"Git -R- Done!\"\n\nThick Southern accent\n\nSleeveless shirts\n\nBaseball cap with a fish hook on it\n\nTrivia\n\nHis signature catchphrase is \"Git-R-Done.\".\n\nHe is a member of the Blue Collar Comedy group, a group of \"rednecks\" who do stand up and sketch comedy together.\n\nIs expecting first child with wife Cara, due August 2006. They plan on naming the baby Reagan (he says because Ronald Reagan was the greatest president ever) if its a girl or Colton (because he says its a good cowboy name and he likes cowboys) if its a boy.\n\nHis favorite comedians are Steve Martin, Don Rickles, Milton Berle, and Henny Youngman. He has met Henny Youngman. Larry says that he's in the comedy business because of those guys, and a friend named Nick DiPaolo, who used to do stuff on Comedy Central.\n\nLarry is a huge University of Nebraska fan (mostly football). Although he's lived in Florida for 27 years, he still calls Nebraska home. His accent is a combination of Pawnee City, NE and his current home near Orlando, FL. He's lived there since he was 16. He's bought a second home south of Lincoln, watches as many games as he can and recently bought one of the new (2006) sky boxes in the North end-zone. He tries to wear some article of clothing (usually a hat) that says \"Nebraska\" or \"Huskers\" during every performance.\n\nOne of his closest friends is fellow comic Lewis Black, who is pretty much his opposite when it comes to political views, background and performance material.\n\nWhile Larry's stand-up act contains a great deal of raunchy material he does not use four-letter words.\n\nWell before hitting it big with the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, he contributed short, daily commentaries for the rock station 101.1 WJRR, which broadcasts out of Maitland, Florida. He also had put in a short stint with another Orlando-area rock station (100.3 WDIZ) before they abruptly changed formats, prior to his work with WJRR.\n\nDaughter, Reagan, born 29 October 2007.\n\nSon, Wyatt, born August 2006.\n\nFather, with Cara, of a boy named Wyatt (b.August 2006) and a girl named Reagan (b. October 29th 2007).\n\nIn 2007, Forbes Magazine estimated his earnings for the year at $20 million.\n\nIs a member of Mensa."
