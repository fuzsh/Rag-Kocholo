        "text": "The most surprising thing about an interview with Larry the Cable Guy is that you never really talk to Larry the Cable Guy.\n\nOnstage, he’s best known for corn pone catch phrases such as “git ’r done” and “Lord, I apologize.” But offstage, the most countrified of the “blue collar comedians” is a mild-mannered guy named Dan Whitney.\n\nIn a recent telephone interview, Whitney, who performs in Springfield today, talked about how much of himself goes into his character, why he doesn’t read his own reviews and why a new TV project might make people see him in a new light.\n\nInstead of the Deep South drawl of his camo-hat-wearing character, Whitney talks with a moderately rural accent that wouldn’t be out of place in central Illinois.\n\n“People know that I do a character,” Whitney said. “Once I got on stage, basically I just put an accent on. It’s all goofy one-liners. Then I got married, so I had to talk about my wife, and then I had kids and had to inject the kids into it.”\n\nWhitney said the Larry character has grown a lot, mostly in the form of incorporating family experiences into his act, which he called “a little reality.” It’s not too far from his real life — it just has an accent he picked up over three decades of living in Florida.\n\n“That’s always been the frustrating thing with my character,” Whitney said. “Haters — people that don’t know me — always say, ‘Oh, he just saw there’s a lot of money in being a redneck and he just decided to be a redneck. He grew up in an apartment in New York somewhere or he grew up in L.A. on the beach,’ which isn’t true.\n\n“I grew up on a pig farm in southeast Nebraska. That’s my roots; that’s where I grew up,” he said. “It’s easy to write for that character. It’s fun to write for that character. I’ve been doing it for so long, I’m entrenched in the lifestyle. I love it.”\n\nAnd to those who say he’s making fun of people who talk like his character, Whitney says they have him all wrong.\n\n“I’m doing a homage to people I frickin’ love to death,” he said. “It’s kind of like everybody I grew up with, rolled up in one, with an accent.”\n\n‘I like to be liked’\n\nWhitney said that when’s he out in public before a show, he goes by Larry the Cable Guy.\n\n“People are comfortable calling me Larry, and I don’t mind at all. ... If you meet me on the street, I’m very approachable. I’m not any different than them.”\n\nHis on- and offstage personalities are not all that different, though Larry is more of a party guy than Whitney is in real life (he used Larry’s accent to talk about “drinkin’ beers and gettin’ drunk”).\n\nWhitney said those are things he doesn’t do: “I’m not a big drinker and I’m married with two kids, and I would never screw around. My wife will frickin’ kill me.”\n\nPolitically, Whitney described himself as a conservative and “a Ronald Reagan guy,” but not a Republican. It’s something that’s bound to come through in his act because it’s a part of who he is, but he sees his job primarily as making people laugh.\n\n“We’re all Americans; we all like to laugh,” he said. “For instance, Bill Maher: I think Bill Maher is a jerk. I’ve met him a couple of times. He’s an idiot. Will that stop me from watching his show? No, because I find the guy funny.”\n\nAsked whether he would ever consider running for office himself, Whitney said never.\n\n“I like to be liked. I like people to like what I do,” he said. “Even if I ran for president and I got 78 million votes, and the other guy got 16 million, I would still go, ‘What the (bleep) is their problem?’ And it would ruin my day.”\n\nThat’s what used to happen when Whitney would look himself up on the Internet after he released an album or some other new project.\n\n“There’ll be 85 comments: 80 people will flat-out love my album. Five of them thought it sucked. Those five piss you off,” Whitney said. “So I quit doing that. Literally, I haven’t read anything about anything I’ve done in five years. I never do that anymore, and I’m a happier guy for it.”\n\n‘I was just the idiot’\n\nFor much of this year, Whitney said, he’s been working on a new TV show: “Smarter than a Cheese Grater.” (It’s apparently a spinoff of fellow blue collar-comic Jeff Foxworthy’s popular “Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?”)\n\n“It’s a lot easier to win money,” he said. “Questions are like: What’s your name? What’s your mom’s name? Where you from?”\n\nBut seriously, folks. Actually, the show is called “Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy,” and it’s scheduled to premiere on the History Channel early next year. In it, Whitney travels across the country learning about history and meeting interesting people.\n\nOriginally scheduled for 13 episodes, Whitney said it would be expanded to 19 or 20 weeks. His travels took him from the U.S.S. Nimitz aircraft carrier to the Barnum & Bailey Circus to ice fishing in Minnesota. Whitney let the producers of the show pick the topics — he had to know where he was going, but otherwise wanted to know as little as possible going in.\n\n“I wanted all that to be spontaneous,” he said.\n\nIt’s the first time he’s done a largely unscripted show. The only thing similar in his past, he said, were a handful of segments on “Blue Collar TV,” the sketch comedy show in which he starred with Foxworthy and Bill Engvall.\n\nHe recalled an episode in which the trio took salsa-dancing lessons. Nothing was planned in advance, no comedic bits were plotted out — they just showed up and saw what happened, each man playing his role.\n\n“Jeff was goofy but he was more of the dad type. Bill was Bill, but he was a little goofier, a little naughtier than Jeff. And then me, I was just the idiot. ‘Huh? What’s going on here?’ That kind of thing,” Whitney said, briefly going into Cable Guy mode.\n\nTaping “Only in America” might have been fun, but for a stand-up comedian accustomed to writing and refining his act over months on the road, unscripted TV can be a challenge.\n\n“The thing you learn when you do something like that is: every word out of your mouth isn’t going to be funny, nor does it have to be funny,” Whitney said. “You want to get out the history of what’s happening, you want to interview these people, you want to be a good interviewer. But yeah, you also want to get jokes out there.”\n\nSo he would often tape 10 to 12 hours for what would become a 15-minute segment.\n\n“If I can’t be funny for 15 minutes of 10 hours, then I shouldn’t be doing the show,” Whitney said.\n\n‘Have you ever seen one good review?’\n\nWhitney said he’s shown some of the completed segments to friends and family “that normally don’t like what I do, like my mom. She loved it.”\n\nWait — his mom doesn’t like what he normally does?\n\n“No, I’m kidding. Are you kidding me? She’s got a mural of me in her front lobby,” Whitney said, possibly kidding.\n\nBut there’s still plenty of room for honest feedback. Whitney said his wife, Cara, usually likes what he does. But “if something kind of sucks, she’ll tell me.”\n\n“She completely loves it. She thinks it’s great; she thinks it’s going to get an Emmy Award,” Whitney said.\n\n“I told her, ‘Honey, have you ever seen one good review on anything I’ve ever done? I think this won’t be any exception.’”\n\nThat said, he still thinks his fans will love the show.\n\n“I think they’re going to see me in a completely different light.”\n\nBrian Mackey can be reached at 747-9587."
