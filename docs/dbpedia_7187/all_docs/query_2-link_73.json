        "text": "Dear Sugars,\n\nI’m a woman who works as a cable installer-repairperson. I love the days when I’m a force for gender normalization in tech. By simply walking into a stranger’s house, my presence opens the mind of a young girl to new possibilities, or causes an elderly woman to rejoice at the representation she never got to have. On a great day, every action I take in my job screams: “Women are capable! We can do it!”\n\nBut for every positive encounter, there are three terrible ones. The man who won’t let me in the door because he doesn’t believe I can fix the problems. The man who touches me from behind without my permission. The woman who eyes me suspiciously from behind her screen door because despite the van, the badge, the hat and the tools, she thinks I’m trying to trick her. People show me every day, consciously or subconsciously, that I’m not what they wanted or expected. I have to work twice as hard to prove myself to customers as my male counterparts do, while fielding ludicrous questions and comments about my appearance and my personal life.\n\nAfter three years on the job, I’m growing weary of these interactions. Each negative experience breaks me down further, and the positive ones don’t lift me up like they used to. I’m also the only woman in my shop and I feel isolated. It’s difficult to share my experiences with male co-workers who don’t understand my experience because they don’t have it. Is it time to hang up my boots? Should I leave this job?\n\nThe Cable Girl\n\nCheryl Strayed: I’m the first one to say that you should do what makes you happy, Cable Girl, and maybe right now, for you, that means finding a job that’s less isolating and less deflating. The feminist revolution doesn’t depend on your ability to endure the sexist things people say to you while you work. There are plenty of other jobs that will give you a sense of satisfaction and pride without constantly reminding you that when it comes to gender equality we have a long way to go.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
