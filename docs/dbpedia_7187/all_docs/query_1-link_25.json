        "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - On Monday morning, visitors at Firethorn Golf Club could spot plenty of golf balls on the green, and even a few stars. Locally and nationally-known celebrities gathered to raise money for the Git-R-Done Foundation with Dan Whitney, known as “Larry the Cable Guy.”\n\n“Finding celebrities in Nebraska that didn’t play Nebraska sports is like finding an extra small shirt at Walmart,” joked Whitney. “We’ve got some real good Husker people here, and I like to mix it up. We’ve got World Series pitchers, we’ve got MVPS - we’ve got some of the best in the field in my tournament, which is really cool to see.”\n\nAside the star-studded guest lists, the main purpose of Whitney’s nonprofit is to help children and veterans. These charity efforts were sparked back in 2008 when his son was diagnosed with hip dysplasia.\n\n“We knew more about hip dysplasia in animals than we knew about people,” Whitney said. “So that’s how it started, once we did that - and my kid’s completely cured of it. He was cured of it at a young age, much to the point where he’s bull riding.”\n\nThe Whitneys donated money toward research, and they helped establish the International Hip Dysplasia Institute.\n\n“It was a really fun thing to do, and we were really helping people, so we decided to keep it going,” Whitney said. “So we kept it going, and we fund everything from veterans with PTSD, and we focus on anything that has to do with children and veterans.”\n\nSince 2009, Dan and his wife Cara Whitney have raised more than $10 million with the Git-R-Done Gala and Golf Classic.\n\n“You know, it’s kind of hard sometimes to get people to come to Lincoln, Nebraska in June,” chuckled Whitney. “But they show up. All the money goes to where it’s supposed to go. I’ve got one employee - that’s it - that organizes my golf tournaments and takes care of everything.”\n\nThe gala takes place the night before the golf tournament at the Still Water Equestrian Academy in Hickman. The assisted riding and horse therapy facility is also a product of the Git-R-Done Foundation’s support.\n\nA majority of this year’s funds are going to the Bryan Medical Center’s Newborn Intensive Care Unit in Lincoln.\n\n“These basinets are going to help us kind of just stay up with the times, have a safe sleeping environment for our babies and help our parents transition to life and bond with their newborns,” said Alexa Lewis, director of Women’s and Children’s Services at Bryan Medical Center.”\n\nThe rest of the funds are distributed to 10-20 charities across the United States. The comedian grew up in Pawnee City, so he donates to charities in his home state of Nebraska. But he also gives to causes in Florida, where he lived later in life.\n\nAt the gala, an auction takes place during which Larry the Cable Guy jokes with donors and roasts celebrities.\n\n“He’s always calling me, ‘Alright, Dave, I’ve got a brand new joke for you,’” grinned David Wells, former MLB pitcher for 21 seasons and nine teams. “He always takes them out on me. That’s the fun part. That’s why everybody comes out here.”\n\nWhitney said he was pleased to have Governor Jim Pillen and Husker coaches John Cook, Fred Hoiberg and Matt Rhule. But some celebrities traveled from across the country for this event.\n\n“I feel blessed, first of all, that I was on Home Improvement,” said Debbe Dunning, who played Heidi in the popular TV show. “Here we are almost 30 years later and I’m still able to use my little part on Home Improvement to do good. I’m able to come out here, and people pay money to play with us celebrities. We love it because we know it’s for a good cause.”\n\nMany are personal friends of the Whitneys.\n\n“Years ago, Dan Whitney, was a part of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, so I’m one of those comics,” said Ron White, comedian. “So I’ve known Dan for a long, long time, and I just happened to be on the phone with him about something else, and he asked me if I’d come out and support.”\n\nOther guests were “The Sandlot” star Patrick Renna, model and actress Kim Alexis, Super Bowl champion Mike Alstott, Ben Higgins from the Bachelor and many more celebrities who came for the Git-R-Done Golf Classic.\n\n“First and foremost, it’s hard to say no to Dan,” Wells said. “When you got a heart like his, and obviously he’s a comedian, all your troubles go away with Dan Whitney.”\n\nThe Git-R-Done Foundation raised over $800,000 at the auction, and they’re still counting. Whitney shared this exciting news with the group before the golf tournament, as well as a couple of final thoughts.\n\n“Go Big Red, and Git-R-Done,” Whitney grinned.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox."
