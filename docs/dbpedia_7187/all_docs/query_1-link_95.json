        "text": "When it comes to history, Larry the Cable Guy is ready to git-r-done.\n\n\"Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy\" will debut Feb. 8 on the cable network History, and the Nebraska-born host who spent time as a youth visiting relatives in northeast Kansas and will return March 19 to perform his sixth show at the Topeka Performing Arts Center, says the show brings his own perspective on the United States.\n\nThe show, said Larry, whose boyhood friends in Pawnee City, Neb., know as Dan Whitney, is less about historical events and more about the lives of everyday Americans.\n\nHe called the hourlong show in which he crisscrosses the nation \"a great opportunity for me to go out and do stuff with just regular Americans and just show that this is still a great country and we have the greatest culture in the greatest county in the world.\"\n\nSo what does Larry do with these regular Americans?\n\nIn the debut episode, he spends time in the backwoods of Georgia getting a lesson on how moonshine is made and how the history of its transportation from still to city without getting arrested became the origins of NASCAR racing.\n\nIn Calavares County, Calif., where Mark Twain based one of his early tales about jumping frogs, Larry learns the techniques of contemporary amphibian competition and enters the famous Frog Jumping Jubilee at the Calvares County Fair.\n\nThen at the historical home of Emily Post, he gets lessons in etiquette from the grandchildren and great-granddaughter of the matriarch of manners.\n\nSometimes, the comedian is in full Larry mode, but other times his true Dan Whitney persona shows through.\n\n\"I go in and out of character all the time,\" he said. \"I go into character to be funny and say funny things, and then, you know, when some serious conversation arises, then I talk like me, and that's what this show allowed me to do,\" said Larry, who picked up his on-stage accent at college in Alabama when both of his roommates were from the South.\n\nWhether there will be a second 13-episode season of \"Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy\" will depend on audience response to Season 1, but Larry said he is open to it. Fans also will hear him this summer once again voice the character of the tow truck Mater in \"Cars 2,\" the sequel to the 2006 Oscar-nominated, Disney/Pixar animated feature film \"Cars.\" \"Cars 2\" is due June 24.\n\nHowever, don't look for Larry to devote all his time to television or movies.\n\n\"There is nothing better than doing live stand-up,\" he said. \"I like doing other projects because it challenges me, especially this one. But, no, stand-up is the funnest part of what I do. That's what I do. I'm a comedian, and I enjoy the freedom of doing stand-up. So it's definitely by far the best thing.\"\n\nFuture Larry the Cable Guy comedy tours might have a closer-to-Topeka starting point than his current home in Sanford, Fla. The Omaha World-Herald reports it's on the market for $1.55 million as the comedian, who with his wife has two preschool children, wants to return to the Cornhusker State to raise the kids.\n\nThat would put him closer to relatives in Topeka, Horton, Holton, Hiawatha, Sabetha and Seneca, as well as to the home stadium of his No. 1 football team, the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers, although he admitted watching their future games won't quite the same given Nebraska's defection to the Big Ten.\n\n\"I was a Big Eight guy. I really enjoyed the Big 12, but I was a Big Eight guy,\" he said. \"The fact that we won't ever play Kansas, Missouri and Kansas State again, it's sad. I really hate to see it go.\"\n\n\"But you know what? Life goes on, you know, we go on to the Big Ten, and we just play the games. What do you do?\" he said, and before the topic changed added a hearty \"Go Huskers!\"\n\nBill Blankenship can be reached at (785) 295-1284 or bill.blankenship@cjonline.com."
