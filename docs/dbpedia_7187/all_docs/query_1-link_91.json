        "text": "Ten things you probably didn't know about Larry the Cable Guy, who plays Thursday night at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena ...\n\n1. He's a Nebraska native but moved to Florida when he was 16. He still lives in Sanford (although he's typically on the road for 250 days each year).\n\n2. He may dress like a dumb hick but don't you believe it: Forbes Magazine estimated his earnings for 2007 at $20 million.\n\n3. His first TV appearance was on \"Caroline's Comedy Hour\" in 1993 but don't look for Larry the Cable Guy in the credits; he was just Dan Whitney back then.\n\n4. His \"Right to Bare Arms\" CD went No. 1 on the comedy and country charts in 2005.\n\n5. He's one of the few stand-up comics who plays arenas rather than theaters. He's booked July 4 at the University of Nebraska's Memorial Stadium, where the Cornhuskers play.\n\n6. When he played at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena in 2007, he took a moment onstage to thank Fred Pozin who used to book him into The Comedy Zone in Mandarin.\n\n7. On the Rotten Tomatoes Web site, the average score given to 2006's \"Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector\" was 2.4 out of 10.\n\n8. Comedy Central's \"Roast of Larry the Cable Guy\" last month drew 4.1 million viewers, making it the third most popular roast in Comedy Central history (behind Jeff Foxworthy and Pamela Anderson).\n\n9. When he lost 50 pounds using the NutriSystem diet (for which he was a spokesman), he claimed he'd \"lost an Olsen.\"\n\n10. He was born in the back of an El Camino during a Foghat concert. At least that what his bio says."
