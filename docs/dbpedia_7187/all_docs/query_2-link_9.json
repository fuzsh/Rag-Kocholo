        "text": "Small examples of why telecom installers should not have \"baby\" exams. Their test questions ask things like What color is the green screw that you connect the ground to? They are taught you need to know chapter 7 and ignore 1-6.\n\nLook at the mess of coax everywhere in the photo. Everyone else would get a fail from the inspector on neatness alone. If we just took anger bits and arbitrarily drilled holes through exterior walls we'd get a big fail on whichever Code applies. And half of them don't even put a box on the other end. Fail, fail, fail.\n\nPerhaps that's the problem.

They get paid by the piece, meaning that they get a fixed amount per install no matter how long it takes them or how difficult it might be or how long it takes to get there. And as you can guess, the pay per install isn't great. The only way to make any money is to do as many installs as possible per day. So there is no incentive for them to do anything but the quickest and easiest way possible so they can move on to the next job.\n\nIf you think that this should change and the cable companies should hire and have their own highly trained installers and pay them a decent wage- did you look at your cable bill lately? I don't know about you, but I pay more for pretty much basic cable than I pay for electric. And at least I find electric useful.\n\n-Hal\n\nSo you are saying they are not required to follow the NEC.\n\n800.100,810.21,820.100,830.100 uses the words \"shall be\" Then 90.5 must apply.\n\nExcept the telecom utilities are not under the scope of the NEC. NEC does not apply until the customer side of the demark.\n\nSame as for service drops, NEC does not apply ahead of the service point.\n\nSee 90.4 and the IN at the end.\n\nWe install the Intersystem Bond to make it more likely the installer will use it.\n\nOf course its the electrician who pulls a permit and would get the violation if the intersystem bond is not installed.\n\nExcept the telecom utilities are not under the scope of the NEC. NEC does not apply until the customer side of the demark.\n\nSame as for service drops, NEC does not apply ahead of the service point.\n\nSee 90.2 and the IN at the end.\n\n...\n\nThat isn't what 90.2 says.\n\nIt says that 'not covered' includes 'installations of communications equipment under the exclusive control of of communications utilities located outdoors or in building spaces used exclusively for such installations'.\n\nNote that it says 'equipment' and not cables or conductors. (The section that applies to electrical utilities contains no such specificity.) 800 contains requirements for cables and conductors.\n\nAlso in my experience the grounding conductor usually comes from the point of demarcation.\n\nAlso the point where they land their grounding conductor isn't typically under their exclusive control.\n\nThey are utilities and not subject to the rules in the NEC. 90.2(B)(4)\n\nThat's not what NEC says.\n\nIn 30 CFR 1910.269 Annex A OSHA has clearly laid it out that for electric utilities where the equipment is part of the distribution system, distribution rules (NESC for utilities) applies. When it is a utilization system such as a receptacle in a substation, .subchapter S (NEC) applies. When it's both, both sets of rules apply. The same is true at a residence which is 100% utilization. NEC is quite clear on this. At least in North Carolina telecommunication contractor licensing uses a test on the NEC. So NEC applies not only because Article 90 says it does but because state law says it does.\n\nI don't care how the utility pays their subs. They are subject to the same rules as the utility. If I'm a sub that does not give me permission to do crappy work either. I have made a cable contractor (Comcast) come back out and redo it. One call to the local Code official would fix these issues.\n\nSent from my SM-T350 using Tapatalk\n\nHey, I'm not saying I don't agree with you 100% but if an AHJ had to inspect every cable, telephone or sat install there wouldn't be enough inspectors in the state or time in a year to do it. So I really don't think they even care. They have bigger fish to fry.\n\n-Hal\n\nOh, you just made it seem important. It thought we were only debating how much we electricians are entitled to roll our eyes at the cable guy. :lol:\n\nHey, I'm not saying I don't agree with you 100% but if an AHJ had to inspect every cable, telephone or sat install there wouldn't be enough inspectors in the state or time in a year to do it.
