        "text": "Well, Here Go's...\n\nI am a 30 veteran of the cable industry. I landed my first job as an installer in January 1990 in Newport, Oregon with TCI Cable. I got nearly a full week of on the job training before being handed an install route and the keys to a truck. I've (nearly) never looked back!\n\nI have long been pondering the odd, internal pressure to write about some of the observations, problems, failures, successes, gains, losses, ugliness, and beauty I have witnessed and experienced in my 30 years as a Cable Guy. For reasons unknown and motivations unexplored, today is the day that I finally put digit to keyboard and begin to type. I have a great deal to share, and I envision a serious of (I hope not too rambling) posts about a variety of different topics. I have no real goal with these musings, other that to relieve that odd internal pressure that has built up to the point where I must share. It's OK if you take offense and it's OK if you think I'm brilliant and insightful (although I obviously prefer the latter) - I write this for me, not for anyone else. Although I do hope that someone, somewhere, will get some enjoyment or other benefit from what I have to share.\n\nMy attempt at pre-disclosure is this: I am going to be Completely Honest. Transparent. Direct. I will name names, share secrets, offend, praise, and more. Again, I do this for me, to be sure I am expressing myself as I must, not to specifically cause any feeling or response in anyone else. If by naming a name I offend someone or otherwise catalyze negativity, please know that I do not do so on purpose. In truth anything and everything I have to say about anyone in specific is much water under the bridge to me. I have moved on, other than this need to get it out. I expect once out I will never revisit these thoughts again. I hope this exercise acts to purge my memory banks, if you will. But in truth, however it comes across to anyone who reads this, my goal is NOT to blame, anger, point fingers, or cause harm. I am NOT complaining because I was fired, or overlooked, or underappreciated, or anything at all. I am mostly bemused at how things have worked out after 30 years mostly spent in the building of Outside Plant Fiber networks for Cable MSO's. Believe or don't, this is my story, and I'm sticking to it.\n\nBefore we finish this Prelude and begin with the next chapter (Chapter 1 - The Failure of Recruiting) let me share my Bona Fides. My entire profile is open the public here on LinkedIn. It is a direct copy over from my resume which, yes, is 5 pages long...In spite of that not being the accepted standard, in my frustration and amazement at some of the more specific failings of modern recruiting for Telecom Construction Professionals, I finally just put the entire the history of my professional life down. It's not all in there but enough that anyone who might choose to consider working with me can see exactly how I got to where I am today, and at least some of the highlights along the journey. For the contents of this article I will summarize: I joined the navy out of high school and graduated the Naval Nuclear Power Program in 1987.\n\n(Tangent. I want to express this openly, and this is the place, but it doesn't directly apply to my cable career and can be ignored by the reader. This was, then, widely considered to be the most difficult course of academic instruction in the WORLD. It had an attrition rate of 75% and those that made it not only had practical vocational training as either a mechanic, an electrician or an electronics technician, but also managed to grind through at least 160 credit hours of college level course work in 18 months. For those of you trying to calculate without a reference: a modern engineering degree is issued at around 120 credit hours, with about 1/3 of those hours being non-technical/elective topics. So another way to look at NNPS is the technical credit hour equivalent of 2 separate BS - Engineering degrees in an 18 month period. Top that with the fact that the material was all classified as TOP SECRET by the DOD so all homework, much of it mandatory, had to be done inside the secure classroom environment. We didn't get much sleep, but we sure did learn a lot. Then we went to see and things go really difficult...but that is an entirely different story!)\n\nAfter the Navy and some odd jobs, I landed that first job as an installer for TCI in Newport Oregon in January of 1990. I became a GREAT installer and I still have the deep seated belief that we need to GET THE CUSTOMER CONNECTED which was all the rage back then. Who would have thought? Making sure the customer had service at all costs? It was a crazy time to be alive: drops across driveways, along fence lines, going back and doing our digging when we had a slow day. If a tap wasn't handy, we just climbed the pole and cut one in! Asked the maintenance guy to check it out the next day. Analog Channels! Anybody remember those? Good times...good times.\n\nAfter a few years I moved to Eugene, OR on a transfer to TCI Eugene. There I met some of the guys that I still consider my closest friends and colleagues and where I became a cable professional for real. By the time I rolled out of Eugene several years later, headed for Seattle, I was a Cable TV Professional! And for a long time, I was proud of it. I miss that. I hope to feel it again some day. It was...nice. Eugene was also where I managed my first construction project in cable: a little plant extension in \"downtown\" Eugene to get service to the new bar and pool hall. The owners couldn't get cable (although they did have a Primestar I put on their roof) and told them I could get them cable for $500. They said OK. So I did it: called the city, who told me not worry about a permit for just one sidewalk panel, hired a guy to cut the concrete and lift the panel, and then come back two hours later and repour it after I laid a little 1 1/4 conduit thru it from the vault in the sidewalk to the brick wall of the building. My apartment was a block away and ran over there with a broom every hour all day to sweep out the foot prints people kept leaving. By the time the cement was hard I kept all but 1 out of it. Then the next day I asked the construction crew to stop by and add a tap to LE for me...and Rory Hayes - Now somewhere in the Bay Area did it for me. A day later I went by- on the clock - and with the help of Travis Coleman I ran the drop and activated the account. The owner paid me $500 and I was a project manager! And don't worry, most anecdotes won't be quite so long...\n\nI thought this was a summary? Yeah, me too... OK, enough then. Suffice it to say that more stories will come up, as they create the context for my thoughts and musings. I will say for now only this: I just kept going: Eugene to Seattle, to Portland, to Seattle, to travelling all over the country, to Seattle, to travelling all up and down the west coast, to Seattle, to Renton, to all over the west division, to Renton, to Denver...and that is where I dropped out for a while. 27 years in, The Seattle rebuild, King County I-Net, Direct Connect, Cell Backhaul, MDU Takeover, SMATV, Digital to Analog Bulk racks, Commercial Addressing, Fiber Audit, WWU headend and distribution system, the first Mini-Node distribution in downtown Seattle, MDU upgrade, and many others...many, many projects completed, all done well, some high-profile, most done with largely the same group of people in the same cities for over 20 years. But at some point it stopped working. At some point my contacts, my associations turned sour. My work, though provably valuable, was deemed too expensive...in spite of proof it made Comcast 250% ROI...That director clearly used different math than I use, but that's what they said. I almost got a divorce...didn't like that at all! And ultimately, I stopped working in cable. I quit. I lost. Others, for many reasons, kept going. Some thrived. Others maintained. Some passed and I miss them. But a break was needed and I break I took. After a couple years, it was time to come back. That time...is now.\n\nToday is Late April 2019, and I am in Port Charlotte, Florida. The plant here is terrible: little fiber, the coax is struggling. They charge $70 to hook up your service after you pay a $100 deposit and agree to $200/month for service that is pretty spotty. It might be this that finally catalyzed this writing... The crazy of those prices from a company that has historically terrible customer service in contrast to the days when we were driven by the need to GET THE CUSTOMER CONNECTED! We called in a service call the 5 or 6th time our service went out for an hour. We watched the Comcast van pull up as we got 7-8 texts tracking the tech to our door. Assuming our two loud little dogs will make us aware of when he came to the door, we kept about our morning preparations and went back to the bedroom to get dressed in work clothes for the day. 5 minutes later he was gone, dogs never barked, and we got absolutely no more texts telling us we had missed our service call, no door tag, no call, or anything else. If the tech knocked on my door he did it using a Q-tip... And Comcast still wonders why their customer service ratings are so poor... If nothing else, I can clear that up for them. And I will as I go thru this exercise of story telling my history of our industry.\n\nSo to wrap up the prelude to our continuing saga, I am a Cable Guy. It is how I identity myself, it makes up the vast majority of my adult working life, and it is a technology and a business and an industry that I think I know as well as anyone and frankly quite a bit better than most. I'm not suggesting that things used to be great and now are not, or that anything is particularly good or bad; right or wrong. Except that I keep seeing and experiencing some things that ARE particularly wrong. And bad. And good. And right. And it has just become the time for me to share some them, from my own perspective, for my own edification, and if by sharing these thoughts with the world, I can offer a tiny bit of insight or some idea or concept I have long mused on can help some other cable guy somewhere, even just to have a laugh, or to reminisce fondly, then I feel I will have done a good thing and I will feel good about that.\n\nFor now, keep it real. Try not to lie or to hurt others. Take care of your family and yourself. And for goodness sakes, turn off the TV and close your browser and go outside! It's only cable, after all! And for those of you with service issues: it was working fine when I left...\n\nEd Wolfe - Port Charlotte, FL - ed@wolfegrade.com - https://www.linkedin.com/in/ewolfe1"
