        "text": "Highest Rated: 92% Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie (2003)\n\nLowest Rated: 4% Witless Protection (2008)\n\nBirthday: Feb 17, 1963\n\nBirthplace: Pawnee City, Nebraska, USA\n\nArguably among the most popular and controversial stand-up comedians of the new millennium, Larry the Cable Guy - the alter ego of Daniel Lawrence Whitney - generated a legion of fans thanks to his crude, opinionated and proudly rural Southern humor. After starting as a call-in guest on various Florida-based radio shows in the early 1990s, Larry quickly gained an audience on the comedy circuit before launching into stardom in 2000 as part of the popular Blue Collar Comedy Tour, which featured Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Ron White. The tour spawned a live CD, three best-selling DVDs, and a short-lived series called \"Blue Collar TV\" (The WB, 2004-06). Meanwhile, Larry was on top of the charts with comedy albums like A Very Larry Christmas (2004) and The Right to Bare Arms (2005), while also landing on the bestseller lists with his book, Git-R-Done (2005), the title of which came from his famed catchphrase. From there, it was only a short jump to movies with starring turns in \"Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector\" (2006) and \"Witless Protection\" (2008), both of which were savaged by critics, while voicing Mater in \"Cars\" (2006) and \"Cars 2\" (2011). Whether people loved him or hated him, there was no doubt that Larry the Cable Guy was determined to remain a giant force on the comedy scene.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n21% Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas 5% Delta Farce\n\n5% Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector\n\n4% Witless Protection\n\nPhotos\n\nDaniel Whitney, aka Larry the Cable Guy at arrivals for The Walt Disney Family Museum 2nd Annual Fundraising Gala, Disneyís Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, Anaheim, CA November 1, 2016.
