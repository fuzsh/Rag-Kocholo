        "text": "By Dan Clarendon\n\nUpdated July 25 2023, 11:50 a.m. ET\n\nWhat happened to Larry the Cable Guy, the blue-collar comedian who made a name for himself in the 2000s with his comedy routines and his role in the Cars franchise?\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWell, comedy buffs will be glad to know that the star — born Daniel Lawrence Whitney — is still delighting audiences.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIs Larry the Cable Guy still alive? He was the subject of a death hoax.\n\nLarry has been keeping busy in recent years, though in July 2023, rumors circulated online that the beloved comic had died. Not only was this false information, but Larry also assured fans that this hoax seems to make the rounds every year or so.\n\nHe tweeted on July 24, 2023: \"As much as some haters would love for me to have died, which I don’t know why other than being jealous of my 1980’s Dolph Lundgren (circa 1980s) looking body, I’m still alive and currently putting icy hot on 65 percent of my body after trying to put on my socks. Apparently once a year someone spreads this rumor. It’s fake. I’m fully mobile.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHe continued: \"The last time I laid motionless was on my honeymoon according to my wife. I’m not dead, I don’t have sleep apnea or diabetes. I do however have major farts from honey roasted pistachios. I love all y’all!\"\n\nAs Larry implied, he's certainly been keeping busy.\n\nHe released a standup special on Netflix in November 2020 called Larry the Cable Guy: Remain Seated, in which he \"muses on swampy weather, late-night shopping at Walmart, and other raunchy tales of life in rural America,” per the streaming platform.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe following year, he appeared on The Masked Singer as the Baby.\n\nAnd in 2022, he returned to the Cars franchise to voice the character Mater in the Disney Plus series Cars on the Road.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLarry the Cable Guy has found success both professionally and personally.\n\nLarry kickstarted his career in the early '90s with frequent appearances on popular radio shows like The Ron and Ron Show. He began his standup career while using his real name, but found more success after developing his trademark stereotypical-redneck persona, Larry the Cable Guy, complete with the now-popular catchphrase \"Git-R-Done.\"\n\nA member of the wildly popular Blue Collar Comedy troupe, he has released seven comedy albums and hosted his own History Channel show called Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLarry has been married to his wife Cara since 2005. The two welcomed a son named Wyatt and a daughter named Reagan. The couple also created the Git-R-Done Foundation as a \"focal point for the family's philanthropy,\" per the nonprofit's website."
