A power outage in your vehicle is similar to one in your house and needs to be repaired to get things back to normal.\n\nBattery cables connect your vehicle's battery to the vehicle itself. There is a positive cable when provides the power and a negative cable that connects to the vehicle chassis and provides a ground for electrical components.\n\nA failing battery cable may cause your vehicle not to start. Your starter may turn over very slowly. Or you may just hear a series of clicks. One other clue is on your dashâ€”the battery warning light.\n\nThere are many things that can cause power issues in a vehicle, but it's important to keep battery cables clean and maintained. Salt and corrosion are enemies to any power system. A technician can keep things in top shape, disconnecting the cables, inspecting them and cleaning their ends and the battery terminals. Cables, by the way, are often made up of smaller strands of wire. If they are frayed, some of those smaller wires can touch metal parts of the vehicles that they shouldn't. The result? Electrical system malfunctions.\n\nSo if you see any of these signs that something is not quite right with the power in your vehicle, consult your service advisor and get it checked out.

It may be making an odd noise or behaving oddly when you're driving. You may hit a pothole or curb and one suddenly goes flat.
