        "text": "Synopsis\n\nLarry the Cable Guy is an immensely popular American stand-up comedian known for his appearances in various films and TV shows.\n\nIn July 2023, there was a cruel hoax circulating online falsely claiming that Larry the Cable Guy had passed away, but this information was not true.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy: Who is he?\n\nDaniel Lawrence Whitney, born on February 17, 1963, is famously recognized as Larry the Cable Guy. He hails from Nebraska, growing up on an 80-acre farm with his parents Tom and Shirley Whitney. When he was 16, the family relocated to West Palm Beach, Florida. Larry pursued his education in drama and speech, attending the Baptist University of America and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nAfter attempting comedy, Whitney decided to drop out of college. In the 1990s, he began his career on radio, appearing on shows like The Ron and Ron Show and various local stations. Initially, he performed stand-up under his real name, but he didn't achieve much success. However, everything changed when he created his famous character, the Cable Guy. This persona propelled his career to new heights.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy is also famous for his catchphrase \"Git-R-Done.\" He has released several comedy albums, including \"Lord, I Apologize\" (2001) and \"The Right to Bare Arms\" (2005), both certified gold by the RIAA. In 2007, he released \"Morning Constitutions\" alongside a TV special. Larry also starred in the travelogue series \"Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy\" on the History Channel in 2011.\n\nMoreover, Larry has appeared in various films, often portraying his comedy alter ego. He is also recognized for voicing Mater in the beloved Cars film franchise. In his personal life, Larry is married to Cara, and they have two children, Wyatt and Reagan. Together, they founded the Git-R-Done Foundation in 2009 to support charitable causes.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy has displayed his passion for music and showed up on stage with the band REO Speedwagon during a benefit concert in 2013 for tornado disaster relief in Bloomington, Illinois. Additionally, in October 2021, he was unmasked as the Baby on The Masked Singer.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy: Why is it trending?\n\nIn July 2023, upsetting rumours falsely claimed that Larry the Cable Guy had passed away. These baseless rumours spread mainly on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, but they are nothing more than a hoax. Larry is very much alive and well.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time such unfounded rumours have circulated about the comedian's apparent demise. Over the years, various false reports have emerged, claiming Larry was involved in a fatal accident or had succumbed to a severe illness. However, Larry has used these instances to emphasize the importance of fact-checking and the dangers of spreading false information.\n\nRest assured, Larry the Cable Guy is alive and in good health. The rumours are entirely untrue, and he continues to entertain audiences with his humour and wit.\n\nFAQs\n\nWho is Larry the Cable Guy?\n\nDaniel Lawrence Whitney, born on February 17, 1963, is famously recognized as Larry the Cable Guy.
