        "text": "CHARLES TOWN, W.Va. — There’s Dan Whitney — the guy who grew up in Nebraska on a pig farm, later in Florida, made his way in comedy and enjoys his life with his wife and two kids on his own Nebraska farm.\n\nThen there’s his alter ego, Larry the Cable Guy — the guy whose southern drawl is a lot more pronounced, loves trucker caps and sleeveless flannel shirts, has a penchant for telling jokes that can be slightly more than ornery and a catchphrase, “Git-R-Done!”\n\nThe morning he was answering questions about his two shows at 7 and 10 p.m. Saturday, March 18, at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races in Charles Town, W.Va., it was a lot more Daniel than Larry. The first thing to notice is that southern drawl is not as pronounced, but he has that same goofy laugh.\n\nGrowing up, Whitney said he always was kind of a funny kid.\n\n“My brother was funny. My sister was funny. My mom’s pretty funny. My dad was a preacher, but he was funny when he was yelling at us,” he said laughingly during a telephone interview from his Nebraska home. “Everyone was pretty funny. My brother is way funnier than I am, but they’re all smarter than me. I didn’t have much else than funny. They had other things. I had funny, I had looks and I had charisma.”\n\nWhitney was playing baseball in college “and I loved it.” He sat out his third year of college so he didn’t have to work when he played baseball in the spring because he was paying his own tuition.\n\n“Back in the day, we used to have to pay our own way through college. Our parents really couldn’t help us because they couldn’t, so we would have to work,” he said.\n\nHe started doing standup, “got addicted to it, and thought, ‘hey, man, this is what I want to do. I’m built for this thing.’”\n\n“You know, I was always funny. I enjoyed the attention. All comedians seem they like the attention. They like to be the center of attention,” he said. “They feel they need to have someone constantly patting them on the back. We’re really insecure. And so it was something about that that I really liked. ... I didn’t have a lot of confidence, but it finally gave me some confidence. People looking at me. I was in control of the situation.”\n\nIt also helped that Whitney was funny and enjoyed being funny.\n\n“There is no better feeling in the world than being in front of a bunch of people, everybody’s looking at you, and you telling a joke you wrote and everyone laughing hysterically at it,” he said. “So I just got hooked on it, didn’t go back to school and worked really hard at it. And there you go.”\n\nA cable guy is born\n\nLarry the Cable guy was a character that Whitney developed during the late ’80s, early ’90s.\n\n“I never meant to do it onstage,” he said.\n\nIn 1979, Whitney and his family had relocated to West Palm Beach, Fla. It was in West Palm Beach’s Comedy Corner where Whitney first developed Larry the Cable Guy.\n\nWhitney said “it was all theater of the mind, it was a radio character,” he said of Larry the Cable Guy.\n\n“I first stated doing it on my buddy’s radio station in 1991,” he said. “And by 1993 it was syndicated into three or four different states. I just started perfecting it. I started getting on more and more radio stations.”\n\nBack in the 1990s, he said he was able to get away with a lot more things on the radio without people getting upset.\n\n“People had thicker skin then,” he said.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy didn’t make an actual live stage appearance until 1996-97, at his friend Wes McCurdy business, McCurdy’s Comedy Theatre in Sarasota, Fla.\n\n“It took a long time to develop it, felt comfortable with it,” he said.\n\nMcCurdy had billed Whitney as “Daniel Whitney also known as Larry the Cable Guy.”\n\n“I was a little irritated at first because I didn’t want anyone to know it was me,” he said. “It was packed. He sold both sold shows out. When I first got there, ‘What’s going on here today.’ I went onstage the first time and I was doing my act and people were yelling ‘Git-R-Done’ and yelling stuff out that I did on my radio show.”\n\nHe said during the first show, “I did part me, part the character. But I couldn’t follow the character so I ended up flipping the show doing a Larry the Cable Guy poem I wrote.”\n\nWhitney said he adapted his own show for his character. He had always been a one-liner, goofy comedian, but with Larry the Cable he slowed down the pace when delivering the jokes.\n\nAfter the first show, McCurdy asked for the second show if Whitney could do the entire show as Larry the Cable Guy. Whitney said sure. So McCurdy dropped Whitney’s name and just had Larry the Cable Guy performing.\n\n“And I said, ‘I’ll go change into something more comfortable,’” Whitney said. “And that was pretty much it.”\n\nBecoming a Blue Collar comedian\n\nThe Larry the Cable Guy character launched Whitney into a successful comedian.\n\n“At the time I was probably the highest-paid comedian for about five years,” he said. “I worked about the same ones because I was syndicated in radio in about 20 states. I would work wherever they could hear me on the radio. And I would sell out weeks before I ever showed up.”\n\nWhitney had been friends with fellow comedian Jeff Foxworthy for 30 years, calling his relationship with Foxworthy, “like a brother.” Whitney auditioned for the Blue Collar Comedy Tour to replace comedian Craig Hawksley. The troupe along with Foxworthy also starred Bill Engvall and Ron White. From 2000 to 2006, the foursome toured all over the country to sold-out shows.\n\nThe tour grossed $15 million in sales, and sold another million in DVDs. In 2001, Whitney released his full-length comedy album, “Lord, I Apologize,” which sold a half-million copies.\n\n“It definitely took me up to another level because instead of doing 300 people a night, four days a week, five days a week, with Blue Collar we were doing 8 to 12,000 people a night, sometimes 15,000,” he said. “We still hold a record in Nashville (Tenn.) ... no one has ever sold more tickets than the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.”\n\nHe said he really enjoyed it “and our fans were really great.”\n\n“We’re just a bunch of regular guys. We’re not Hollywood. We don’t pretend we’re the funniest guys in the world, we’re just up there having fun doing our jokes,” he said.\n\nFamily first\n\nAlthough both Foxworthy and Engvall decided to make the transition into TV with their own sitcoms, Whitney said he wouldn’t do a sitcom.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Whitney hosted as Larry the Cable Guy History Channel’s “Only in America.” Because of his work on that show, Whitney said that’s why he doesn’t want to take on a sitcom.\n\n“It was a great show. It had great ratings,” he said. “... I just up and quit that show because I never got a lot of time to spend it with my kids. My kids now are 9 and 10, but back then they were probably 4 and 5. And I did that show for three years, but I was also touring, I was also doing movies. I just never got to see then. I told my wife when I hit 50 I was going to hit my schedule way down and I kept my promise.”\n\nThe 54-year-old has been married to his wife, Cara, since 2005. They have a son and daughter, Wyatt and Reagan.\n\nWhitney said they thought about bringing back “Only in America,” but he said he wants to focus on what’s important.\n\n“I have a really good family and I don’t want to be gone from home for three weeks a month,” he said. “If there was a project that said they needed me and I only need to be gone eight days, five days, I’d might do that. But no more of this six weeks, three weeks, five weeks. No more of that anymore.”\n\nGiving back\n\nOne project close to Whitney’s heart is the Git-R-Done Foundation. He and his wife, Cara, established the nonprofit organization in 2009. According to the foundation’s website, GitRDoneFoundation.org, the mission is “highly dedicated to helping children and veterans, one cause at a time, through organizations supporting our focus areas.”\n\nThe foundation has donated to a variety of organizations including Arnold Palmer Foundation for the treatment and cure of hip dysplasia, Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital and Operation Homefront. The Git-R-Done Foundation is also an advocate for The International Hip Dysplasia Institute and its work to bring an awareness, prevention and cure to the condition.\n\n“It’s always an awesome thing if you have the ability to do things like that. It’s just a great feeling,” he said. “They say it’s better to give than receive. To be honest with you, I like receiving but there’s no better feeling than giving and watching people’s responses that they receive something.”\n\nFor Whitney it’s about giving back.\n\n“I’m just so glad to be blessed in a way and be able to help people that need help,” he said.\n\nHe said that’s why someone else is in charge of making the hard decisions, he said, and there is only one employee at the foundation.\n\n“None of that goes on with me. If we raise $260,000, they get $260,000. It’s a pretty cool deal,” he said.\n\nBut he made sure that he didn’t have access to who gets what.\n\n“I can’t say no,” he said. “I would give money to every single person who asks. When you have a charity, you can’t do that.”\n\nHe said “it’s really cool” to give back.\n\nMaking people laugh\n\nWhitney promises to bring Larry the Cable Guy for his appearance at Hollywood Casino. And when mentioned that Foxworthy had just performed at that same venue a couple of months prior, he had a one-liner.\n\n“Well I guess they’re going to be ready for some entertainment,” he said with a laugh.\n\nAs for his show, it will be a regular Larry the Cable Guy show.\n\n“My show is my show. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it,” he said. “I’m a one-liner comedian. Set up. Punch. Set up. Punch. That’s the one thing I’m proud of, I have more punchlines in a 1 hour act. ... I would say I have more punchlines than any comedian in the country. That’s what I try to pride myself in.”\n\nIf you go ...\n\nWHAT: Larry the Cable Guy\n\nWHEN: 7 and 10 p.m. Saturday, March 18\n\nWHERE: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, 750 Hollywood Drive, Charles Town, W.Va.\n\nCOST: $75 to $125\n\nCONTACT: Call 800-795-7001 or go to www.hollywoodcasinocharlestown.com."
