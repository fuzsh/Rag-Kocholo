        "text": "Now we all know the secret to staying young: read at a third-grade level.\n\nAt least that's according to Larry the Cable Guy, who shared his insights on the human condition at L.C. Walker Arena Friday night.\n\nThe faux-redneck comedian is known for Comedy Central's Blue Collar Comedy tour, films like “Witless Protection” and voicing a rusty tow truck in Pixar's “Cars” films.\n\nFellow Blue Collar Comedy veteran Reno Collins opened the show, poking fun at his attempts to lose weight by taking up bicycling. The racing bike he bought came with a close-fitting shirt, which only went about halfway over his gut, he said.\n\n“I guess the salesman thought he's funny because my team's sponsored by Pillsbury,” he said. “From the rear it looked like someone half-opened a can of biscuits.”\n\nThe Cable Guy took on some weighty topics, like the state of education and the healthcare system.\n\n“I got put back in fifth grade so many times I drove the other kids to school,” he said. “... I thought I had chronic fatigue syndrome, went to the doctor, spent $3,500. Turned out I'm just lazy.”\n\nAnother source of concern for Larry was runaway political correctness, which he said caused his grandfather to get fired as a Wal-Mart greeter.\n\n“My grandpa got fired for saying 'Merry Christmas' to a couple women on the way into the store,” he said. “Of course, it was August and he wasn't wearing any pants.”\n\nWal-Mart took a few more hits throughout the show, as did environmentalists, animal rights activists, young children (he suggested Chuck E. Cheese could make money by installing vasectomy machines) and the McDonalds McRib sandwich.\n\n“My friend's face is all disfigured from an accident and he thinks he's the ugliest man in the world. So to cheer him up I took him to Wal-Mart,” Larry said. “Now he's the 14th ugliest man in the world.”\n\nNor was the host city herself spared a few jabs, despite opening announcer Andy O'Riley's attempts to highlight the Lake Michigan beaches and the upcoming festival season.\n\n“You all either really like me or there isn't (expletive) to do here,” Larry mused. “It's good to be in Muskegon. I bet it's the first time you ever heard that.”\n\nSharon Wood, of Muskegon, said she hadn't gone to a show at Walker arena since Alice Cooper played there in 1971.\n\n“I wish they would have more like this,” she said.\n\nManagement at the Walker arena said they hoped a successful show with Larry the Cable Guy would help make Muskegon an entertainment destination, and at least some of spectators put in some miles to get there. About 3,600 people attended the show, according Lumberjacks President Tim Taylor.\n\nPat and Lisa Anderson drove more than four hours from Hubbard Lake in eastern Michigan to see the show. Pat Anderson said he had been to Muskegon when he played hockey in the 1970s, but hadn't been back since. The two planned to spend the night in town.\n\n“That's why we got the big beers instead of the little ones,” he said.\n\nDenny Chandonnet and Pat Goresch, both of Muskegon, reminisced about the days when acts like the Beach Boys and Willie Nelson played in Muskegon before the show.\n\n“It's just really nice having a recognized entertainer in Muskegon and seeing the arena fill up,” Chandonnet said. “Bring in the big names and people will pay.”"
