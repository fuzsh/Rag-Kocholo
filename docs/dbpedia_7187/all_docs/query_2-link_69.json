        "text": "Comics are famous for cultivating a persona that is poles apart from the one seen offstage by friends and family.\n\nBut rarely is the disconnect between performer and persona as pronounced as it is with Larry the Cable Guy.\n\nOnstage and on the screen, Larry the Cable Guy affects a deeply Southern accent and a demeanor that would have been right at home on “Hee Haw” a couple of decades ago.\n\nBut in a phone interview, the voice on the other end of the line has a distinctly Midwestern accent, one that tends to include the final “g” in words with an “ing” ending.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy, a native of Nebraska whose real name is Dan Whitney, will be in Greenville Sunday for a show with fellow comic and old friend Jeff Foxworthy. One of the biggest differences between character and creator, Whitney said, is birthplace.\n\n“I tell everybody, Larry the Cable Guy was born in Florida. I was born in Nebraska,” Whitney said. “It’s two different things.”\n\nWhitney, who moved to Florida as a teen, grew up on a pig farm, and his original career aspiration was to be a cattle auctioneer, he said. In Florida, he found more common ground than expected with his new classmates.\n\n“I grew up on a pig farm in Nebraska, so I’m a country kid,” he said. “So when I moved to Florida, I pretty much gravitated to the country kids, to the redneck kids. We were all in the same clique. … I picked my accent up in college. I went to a Baptist college in Georgia, so that’s where I picked up my accent.”\n\nWhitney changed career tracks in college. People kept telling him he was funny, so one night Whitney made his way to an open mic comedy night at a bar.\n\n“I got hooked. And then a comedy club opened up in Florida, and I went on opening night, met the doorman, who wanted to be a comedian. And I spent the next six years of my life at that place, learning, developing, figuring out what I wanted to do. I never went back to college. That’s what I wanted to do,” Whitney said.\n\nHe’s known Foxworthy since the 1980s; they hit the road together as part of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour in the early 2000s. There’s a nice friendship, Whitney said, and a welcome absence of drama on the road.\n\nThe current tour is called “We’ve Been Thinking,” and Whitney said the main thing he and Foxworthy have been thinking about is how to make their fans laugh.\n\n“It’s called ‘We’ve Been Thinking’ because we had to go out and write brand-new material for this show,” Whitney said with a chuckle. “And I said, ‘Crap, that means we’ve got to start thinking about stuff.’”\n\nThe tour will be turned into a Netflix special later this year, and fans can look forward to another installment of Larry the Cable Guy as the voice of Mater in Pixar’s “Cars’ films; the third installment comes out next year.\n\nThe Larry the Cable Guy persona has some clearly defined boundaries, but Whitney said he’s happy with his career and doesn’t feel pigeonholed by the character.\n\n“I don’t care; I mean, I love what I do, and I like making people laugh. If Larry the Cable Guy makes people happy and makes people laugh, I’m all for it. I’m not a rocket scientist. I’m not out to change the world. I’m just a stand-up comedian; that’s my role.”\n\nYOU CAN GO\n\nWhat: “We’ve Been Thinking” tour with Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Sunday\n\nWhere: Bon Secours Wellness Arena\n\nHow much: $47.50-$57.50"
