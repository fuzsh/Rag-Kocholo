        "text": "Nate Bargatze\n\nBargatze has always projected a middle-of-the-road appeal that’s made him a favorite of everyone from Jimmy Fallon to overseas American troops, and his latest Netflix special, “The Tennessee Kid,” leans into that mainstream mindset with familiar set-ups about parenting, gender and marriage. But Bargatze is smarter and funnier than his most recent material implies, and his subtle, self-deprecating stage presence flourishes on stage in a way that no TV special could communicate. Despite his turn toward domestic tropes, Bargatze is a powerful headliner with a delightfully absurd, slow-burn thought process.\n\n7 and 9:30 p.m. Sept. 7 at the Paramount Theatre, 1621 Glenarm Place. Tickets: Sold out, but $55-$140 aftermarket tickets are available at altitudetickets.com.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy\n\nFor all his pandering, lowest-common-denominator jokes, Larry the Cable Guy remains a savvy brand. And we say “brand” because many fans don’t realize he’s a character created by Nebraska native Daniel Whitney, now better known for hawking toys in Disney’s “Cars” franchise (as Mater the Tow Truck) and any number of movie, TV show and talk-radio appearances than his stand-up. The blue-collar comic is back in town Sept. 7 with a show benefiting the Zarlengo Foundation, which will likely avoid anything resembling controversy. (To wit: His publicist offered an interview prior to the show, but when confronted with the idea of discussing politics, she backed out, citing his schedule.)\n\n8 p.m. Sept. 7 at Bellco Theatre at the Colorado Convention Center, 700 14th St. Tickets: $40-$60. axs.com\n\nJackie Kashian\n\nBefore she helps Maria Bamford headline the High Plains Comedy Festival later this month, frequent Bamford opener and headliner-in-her-own-right Kashian will bring her matter-of-fact hilarity to Comedy Works. You may recognize her from any number of late-night TV appearances, but Kashian’s podcast, “The Dork Forest,” is still going strong after 13 years and 8 million-plus downloads, and she’s even got a new one with Laurie Kilmartin on the Nerdist network (“The Jackie and Laurie Show”). Embraced equally by Midwestern soccer moms and alt-comedy hipsters, Kashian has a surprising blue streak that she wields judiciously, like a more wholesome Joan Rivers, or a nerdier, vastly less obnoxious Roseanne Barr.\n\nVarious shows Sept. 19-22 at Comedy Works South, 5345 Landmark Place in Greenwood Village. Tickets: 18-$26. comedyworks.com\n\nHigh Plains Comedy Festival\n\nThis year’s seventh annual event boasts its strongest lineup yet, with Denver favorites such as Natasha Leggero, Kyle Kinane, Rhea Butcher, Baron Vaughn, Ian Karmel and Kate Willett. But in the history of High Plains’ worthy headliners — including Reggie Watts, Anthony Jeselnik, Garfunkel & Oates, the “My Favorite Murder” podcast and David Cross — a solo woman has never held the top spot. That changes this year as Maria Bamford leads the main show at the Paramount Theatre on Sept. 27, with openers Aparna Nancherla and Jackie Kashian. Add to that dozens more local and national comics performing at venues on South Broadway (including the Hi-Dive, Three Kings Tavern and Mutiny Information Cafe) and you’ve got an irresistible magnet for stand-up lovers.\n\nVarious shows Sept. 26-28 on South Broadway and at the Paramount Theatre, 1621 Glenarm Place. Tickets: $45 for headlining show; festival passes sold out; individual tickets on sale soon. highplainscomedyfestival.com\n\nJil Chrissie\n\nDenver’s Voodoo Comedy Playhouse will offer an intimate venue for Los Angeles comic and Denver native Jil Chrissie’s latest creation, “Comedy Hoe,” which combines spoken word, storytelling and stand-up in “a bold commentary on the hyper-sexualization of women,” according to a press statement. We haven’t seen it yet, but Chrissie comes highly recommended from trusted sources, and her experience and acclaim at comedy festivals across the country (including the Hollywood Fringe and Black Women in Comedy fests) hints at a growing reputation. With Angelica Mackey.\n\n8:30 p.m. Sept. 28 at Voodoo Comedy Playhouse, 1260 22nd St. Tickets: $13-$15. voodoocomedy.com\n\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get entertainment news sent straight to your inbox."
