        "text": "DIAMONDHEAD, MS (WLOX) - Larry the Cable Guy is saying \"Git it down\" to a gas station in Diamondhead. The comedian's production company filed suit last week against the Giterdone convenience store, claiming trademark infringement.\n\nDaniel Lawrence Whitney, known to most of America as Larry the Cable Guy, is famous for the tag line \"Git-R-Done.\" It's such a part of his persona, his production company is called Git-R-Done Productions, Inc.\n\nIn a 32 page federal lawsuit, the company details how its lawyers sent two letters to the Mississippi gas station insisting the owners stop using the name \"Giterdone\" and stop selling merchandise with the name. They said both letters were ignored, so the company filed suit.\n\nWhitney's company owns 23 U.S. federal trademark registrations all related to Git-R-Done. They've licensed the name to third parties for all kinds of services and products - everything from beer and hand lotions to knives and packaged meats.\n\nThe lawsuit lists 11 different items sold in the store that they claim infringe on the plaintiff's trademark registration. It even claims a rusty old truck parked in front of the store is reminiscent of the cartoon tow truck, Mater, in the Disney movie Cars. That character is voiced by Whitney.\n\nThe Giterdone gas station and convenience store opened on Diamondhead's south side in 2013. Owner Tom Wood filed an answer to the lawsuit late Tuesday. In the filing, Wood denied all of the allegations and asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the defendant did file an application for trademark registration in October 2008 to use \"Giterdone\" for \"retail convenience stores.\" In that application, they claimed to have first used the name in interstate commerce in June 2009. But the plaintiff claims the application wasn't complete, and it wasn't until July 2015 that the defendant submitted acceptable evidence to support the trademark registration application.\n\nGit-R-Done Productions is asking for the store to stop using the name \"Giterdone\" immediately, turn over or destroy all merchandise with the name, and pay for the attorney's fees and court costs associated with the lawsuit.\n\nRead the full lawsuit here: http://shout.lt/bkg12"
