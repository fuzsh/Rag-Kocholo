        "text": "When it comes to a partnership in comedy built over the course of three decades, Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy are true blue.\n\nThe Blue Collar Comedy Tour veterans have reunited for a live show in which each comedian does an hour-long set of new material. The tour stop in Cincinnati includes two shows on Saturday at 5 and 8 p.m.\n\nIn separate interviews, we asked each comedian about the other, testing their memory about how and when they met and exploring some comedy-related topics.\n\nQuestion: Where did you meet each other?\n\nLarry: At the Comedy Corner in West Palm Beach. Him and a guy named Vic Henley were flip-flopping. Jeff headlined one week. Vic headlined the other week. They were huge Atlanta Braves fans. I was a huge Atlanta Braves fan. They did spring training in West Palm Beach, and that’s where I lived at the time. I moved there from Nebraska, and I had season tickets to all the spring-training games. I met Jeff at the comedy club that night. I think I was wearing my Braves cap, as a matter of fact. That’s all we did for two weeks. We’d go to Atlanta Braves baseball games for spring training.\n\nJeff: At the Comedy Corner in West Palm Beach, Florida, and I think he was like the house emcee at the club. That was before he was Larry the Cable Guy. He was Dan Whitney, the Freight Train of Comedy. And it was still one-liners. But we just kind of hit it off. We just became buddies right off the bat. We both loved the Atlanta Braves, and that’s where they did spring training. I would make it a point to work there every spring training. We’d get up early and go sit at the ballpark. We didn’t have any money, so we’d have to sneak in and watch the ballgames.\n\nQ: What year was that?\n\nLarry: It was either 1987 or 1988.\n\nJeff: Probably 1986.\n\nQ: Why do you like working with each other?\n\nLarry: Jeff and I have kind of the same sense of humor. He makes me laugh like crazy offstage. We laugh at the same stuff. His first two albums are two of my favorite albums of all time. It’s just such funny comedy. Regardless of where he grew up in the South, and I grew up in a small town in the Midwest on a big farm, it’s like his joke: rednecks aren’t just in the South, and that’s a fact. Everything he says in his albums, I laugh at, because it’s exactly what my family did. So we kind of grew up the same way.\n\nJeff: Because he’s a big teddy bear. He’s just a sweet, sweet guy. And he genuinely makes me laugh. I would have people that would say to me, “How come on the Blue Collar tour when you guys were on the stools, whenever Larry’s talking, you stare at the floor and shake your head?” And I said, “Well, I stare at the floor cause if I look at him, I’m gonna start laughing, which is what he wants me to do.” And so I would stare at the floor, and Ron (White) would always lean over and go, “Just look at him. Just look at him.” And I would shake my head, and say, “No, I’m not looking at him.” Even though we’re totally different styles, I think that’s why the Blue Collar tour worked, because people could tell we just liked each other.\n\nQ: What’s Jeff’s best skill, other than comedy?\n\nLarry: Jeff’s a good businessman. It takes a good businessman to be a good comedian. Jeff taught me that early in my career. He said, “It’s called show business for a reason. Everybody wants to do the show, and have a good time, but nobody wants to get up early and do the business.” And he’s right. There’s a lot of comedians that are a lot funnier than me and Jeff out there, but you’re never going to hear from them, because they don’t work at it.\n\nQ: What’s Larry best skill, other than comedy?\n\nJeff: He wants me to say golf, but if you’re playing with him, be very careful, because balls mysteriously fall out of his pocket into the middle of the fairway. But he works very hard at being a big golfer. That’s his passion these days. But he’s a great dad. He’s a terrific dad, which was always the important thing for me. He’s always been kind of like my little brother, like he would come to me and he’d go, “I love doing this ‘Only in America’ show, but I’m never home.” I said, “Then quit doing it. Your kids are going to be grown. Don’t miss them growing up. They’re more important.” He kind of listened to that. He’s a great husband and father.\n\nQ: What’s your favorite Jeff joke?\n\nLarry: When he takes his family to Maui. They’re on the plane, and there showing “101 Dalmatians,” and he hears his brother lean over to somebody and go, “Hey, you know those dogs’ voices ain’t real.” He asks his mom – he says, “Mom, you want a window seat?” She says, “I better not, Jeff. I just had my hair done.”\n\nQ: What’s your favorite Larry joke?\n\nJeff: I like the stupid ones, like the guy at the flea market with no legs selling boots. Just the premise of it is so silly that it makes me laugh.\n\nQ: Who is your all-time favorite comedian?\n\nLarry: The one that got me into stand-up was Steve Martin. He was the first comedian that I would imitate.\n\nJeff: The guy that probably helped me the most was (Jay) Leno. Leno was the guy that got me in front of Johnny Carson. And it’s sad that he’s had all these troubles late in life, but (Bill) Cosby was the guy that I used to save my allowance and buy his records and go to school and do him. And for all his other stuff, Cosby was a fabulous stand-up comedian.\n\nQ: Who is your favorite contemporary comedian?\n\nLarry: I like two. I like a guy named Nick DiPaolo, and I like Colin Quinn.\n\nJeff: (Jim) Gaffigan makes me laugh a lot. He’s got such a unique style. Kathleen Madigan makes me laugh a lot, too. Ron White’s probably the most naturally funny human being I’ve ever been around. Ron could recap his day and you’d be beating the table.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Jeff Foxworthy & Larry the Cable Guy\n\nWhen: 5 and 8 p.m. Saturday, March 12\n\nWhere: Taft Theatre, 317 E. Fifth St., Downtown; 513-232-6220"
