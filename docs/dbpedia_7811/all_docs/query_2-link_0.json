Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command, being stationed at Custer Air Force Station, Michigan. It was inactivated on 31 December 1969.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAssigned to Air Defense Command (ADC) for most of its existence, from January 1951 – until 1960 the 34th administered, trained, operated and supported assigned units, and placed all available combat capable elements in a maximum state of readiness. Initially, its area of responsibility included Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Texas. Redesignated Albuquerque Air Defense Sector on 1 January 1960.\n\nReactivated on 1 April 1966, to perform Air Defense including all or part of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia assuming responsibility for the missions of the Detroit and parts of the Syracuse Air Defense Sectors. Assumed additional designation of 34th NORAD Region after activation of the NORAD Combat Operations Center at Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado and reporting was transferred to NORAD from ADC at Ent AFB in April 1966. The division participated in numerous live and simulated exercises such as Fainting Echo, Apache Arrow, and Fainting Knife.\n\nInactivated in December 1969 as ADC phased down its interceptor mission as the chances of a Soviet bomber attack on the United States seemed remote, its mission being consolidated into North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).\n\nLineage[]\n\nEstablished as 34 Air Division (Defense) on 1 January 1951\n\nActivated on 5 January 1951\n\nInactivated on 1 February 1952\n\nOrganized on 1 February 1952\n\nInactivated on 1 January 1960\n\nRedesignated 34 Air Division, and activated, on 20 January 1966\n\nOrganized on 1 April 1966 as redesignation of Detroit Air Defense Sector\n\nInactivated on 31 December 1969\n\nAssignments[]\n\nWestern Air Defense Force, 5 January 1951 – 1 February 1952\n\nCentral Air Defense Force, 16 February 1953 – 1 January 1960\n\nAir Defense Command, 20 January 1966\n\nFirst Air Force, 1 April 1966 – 31 December 1969.\n\nStations[]\n\nKirtland AFB, New Mexico, 5 January 1951 – 1 January 1960\n\nCuster AFS, Michigan, 1 April 1966 – 31 December 1969\n\nComponents[]\n\nWing[]\n\n1st Fighter Wing (Air Defense)\n\nSelfridge AFB, Michigan, 1 April 1966-1 December 1969\n\nGroup[]\n\n343d Fighter Group (Air Defense)\n\nDuluth MAP, Minnesota, 15 September-14 November 1969\n\nInterceptor squadrons[]\n\n15th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: 20 April 1953 – 1 January 1960\n\nDavis-Monthan AFB, Arizona\n\n58th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: 1 August 1959 – 1 January 1960\n\nWalker AFB, New Mexico\n\n62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: 15 September – 14 November 1969\n\nK.I.
