The aftermath would likely trigger the worst economic shocks experienced in more than a century, unleashing a cycle of repression and diminishing the quality of life for populations across Asia and beyond, with devastating impacts on American interests and Americans’ well-being. Moreover, China’s annexation of Taiwan could exacerbate regional tensions and extend into a broader, global conflict. At stake are crucial interests such as the semiconductors that power today’s big data world and the national security of U.S. allies and partners. Neighboring states’ responses to PRC expansion could also result in the erosion of American military advantages as well as the destabilization of democracy and the international order.\n\nWith Xi Jinping, the paramount leader of the PRC, consolidating power and approaching the zenith of his ambitions and ability to execute them, this increasingly worrisome scenario and its profound implications demand immediate attention. With so\n\nmuch at stake, it is critical to take proactive measures to avert such a crisis. U.S. policymakers must urgently double down on efforts to deter Xi throughout this “decade of maximum danger.”[1]\n\nKey findings presented in this paper include:[2]\n\nXi has strong motivations to annex Taiwan through the threat or use of force. The key objective would be to assert political control over the island and capture much of its industrial and technological infrastructure intact while attempting to limit escalation and thwart intervention. Such a move would mark a critical step toward achieving Xi’s so-called “China Dream” and fulfilling the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) promise to reclaim all major territories historically associated with China in some form, of which Taiwan is the crown jewel.\n\nDue to Taiwan’s global dominance in the semiconductor industry, it is important to emphasize that America could not fully retreat from such a defeat. A coercive unification of Taiwan with China would likely disrupt global techno-industrial supply chains for years to come.\n\nUnder some scenarios, the disruption would emanate from Beijing achieving control over an operational Taiwanese semiconductor industry. Under other scenarios involving kinetic action or an embargo by a U.S.-led tech alliance, semiconductor supply disruptions would likely be substantially worse than\n\nthe challenges created by the most intense phase of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nin 2020–21.\n\nA major semiconductor supply disruption triggered by PRC coercive annexation of Taiwan could result in global economic loss on a par with, or worse than, that caused by World War II — the largest decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in the past 120 years.\n\nA disruption in the supply of advanced Taiwanese semiconductors would stall progress in critical fields such as medicine and materials science. Inferior substitutes would, in a best case, require massively increased electricity use — with major energy costs and climate security impact — merely to deliver vital societal functions at reduced performance and potential.\n\nIn a scenario where Indo-Pacific alliances are compromised and the majority of global advanced semiconductor production is either destroyed or falls under Beijing’s sway, the United States risks becoming an embattled “Fortress America” in a world increasingly under Beijing’s influence and control. This would set the stage for insecurity, economic deprivation, and — quite possibly — future warfare between China and the United States.\n\nThe PRC’s successful annexation of Taiwan would cripple U.S. regional credibility and seriously damage its alliance relationships. China would likely be perceived as Asia’s clear dominant power if it subsumed Taiwan while managing to deter (or defeat) a U.S.-led military intervention.\n\nTo Beijing, conquering Taiwan is a necessary, albeit insufficient, milestone in China’s quest for regional dominance and global preeminence. Accordingly, PRC success in coercively annexing Taiwan would not end or stabilize the current competition of systems between the United States and China and the associated risk of armed conflict. Instead, it would likely accelerate and intensify it.\n\nEconomic exclusion from East/Southeast Asia or access conditioned on acquiescence to a PRC-dominated system would threaten American security and prosperity. Moreover, unlike Washington, a regionally-dominant Beijing would likely reject strategic hedging by members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nBeijing’s core political and informational motivations for extinguishing Taiwan’s autonomy underscore the island’s unique importance. As a beacon of capitalist democracy, it demonstrates the ability of a society with diverse Chinese (and other) heritage to address repressive history, value individual life and liberty, engage cooperatively abroad, and chart its own course.\n\nChina’s gaining control of Taiwan would compromise sensitive technologies and information, degrade monitoring of PRC military operations, and enable PRC dominance over the primary approaches to South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. This could significantly affect the ability of Seoul, Tokyo, and Manila to act autonomously, thereby calling into question U.S. commitments to its allies. It could also drive Seoul and Tokyo to seriously contemplate developing nuclear weapons as a means to backstop their autonomy.\n\nIf American allies in Asia were to lose confidence in U.S. security guarantees, a cascade of multi-regional nuclear proliferation pressures would be unleashed. Competition among the three global nuclear superpowers — China, Russia, and the United States — would intensify, and India, Pakistan, and potentially Japan, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Israel could be prompted to develop or increase nuclear capabilities. This process could add dozens of nuclear warheads to global stockpiles each year.\n\nPRC attainment of hegemony in East/Southeast Asia could also destabilize China-Russia relations and other pivotal international dynamics.\n\nIn sum, Taiwan is in many ways akin to the “West Berlin” and “West Germany” of a Cold War 2.0.[3] In this decade of maximum danger, American president(s) will likely face Taiwan-related scenarios at least as severe as those Dwight D. Eisenhower confronted during the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crises of 1954–55 and 1958 — but without the overwhelming military advantages that helped Bill Clinton diffuse the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995–96, or the inherently limited nature of the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis during the Biden-Harris administration in 2022.[4] At stake are critical American and allied interests, the post-war international order, and the peace, prosperity, and freedom it undergirds. American policymakers must act urgently to deter PRC aggression and maximize capabilities to prevent China from coercively annexing Taiwan.\n\nThe risk window is here and now. The PRC’s publicly documented military modernization continues as Beijing works to shape the battlespace through an all-domain pressure campaign including political warfare, cyber and space activities, and physical deployment of military platforms and weapons. These actions are essential preconditions for coercive annexation and reflect the increasingly tight alignment between PRC capabilities and intentions concerning Taiwan. Therefore, absent a substantial U.S. investment in and reinforcement of effective deterrence, Beijing will likely attempt annexation of Taiwan before this decade is out. Safeguarding Taiwan should thus be urgently and relentlessly prioritized in American defense and foreign policy efforts. Some of America’s most vital interests hang in the balance.\n\nMethodology and Scope\n\nThis paper is a work of anticipatory scholarly research based solely on unclassified open sources.[5] It focuses on specific outcomes that would likely result from the PRC’s coercive annexation of Taiwan in the form of a prioritized survey rather than exhaustive explication. If the PRC were to extinguish Taiwan’s current existence as a free, democratic polity, it would likely trigger a multitude of direct consequences including disruptions to semiconductor supply chains, the economic displacement of the United States in Asia, the erosion of U.S. alliances, and nuclear proliferation on a global scale. Other territorial conquest/conflict scenarios — for instance, dispute(s) over features in the South or East China Seas — also carry potentially severe consequences but are beyond the scope of this paper and thus excluded.[6]\n\nIntroduction: Taiwan at Risk — The Growing Danger of PRC Control\n\n“Some indeed still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we … can safely permit the United States to become … a lone island in a world dominated by the philosophy of force. … Such an island represents to me and to the overwhelming majority of Americans today a helpless nightmare of a people without freedom … lodged in prison, handcuffed, hungry, and fed through the bars from day to day by the contemptuous, unpitying masters of other continents.”\n\n— President Franklin D. Roosevelt, June 10, 1940[7]\n\nAs PRC options to credibly use force in the region increase, a pressing strategic question arises: What are the consequences for the United States if China were to succeed in coercively annexing Taiwan? This paper examines the potential for “coercive annexation” and how Beijing could attempt to bring Taiwan to heel politically while capturing much of the island’s industrial and technological infrastructure intact through (ideally) limited use of force.[8]“Coercive annexation” grows from two lexical roots — coerce, “to achieve by force or threat,” and annex, “to incorporate (an additional geographic area) within the domain of a country, state, etc.”[9] Put simply, one political entity employs force or the threat thereof to induce another to cede its autonomy and capacity for self-determination.\n\nCoercive annexation of Taiwan by China is among the most consequential potential security contingencies the United States faces, against a formidable adversary.[10] This paper describes four significant repercussions that could follow. First, given Taiwan’s global leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors, the United States could face a severe semiconductor shortage. Second, with Taiwan under its control, China could potentially compromise American trade access and leverage economic coercion to assert its dominance. Third, the credibility of U.S. alliances would likely diminish, leading to their eventual disintegration. Lastly, as U.S. alliances erode, other nations may be prompted to develop nuclear capabilities, resulting in nuclear proliferation on a global scale.\n\nIn summarizing similar consequences to those explicated here, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command concludes, “China’s assimilation of Taiwan — with or without a fight — would mark a significant shift of (the) balance of power in the 21st century with global repercussions.”[11] Figure 1 depicts these consequences, including key victories for China and losses for America, should Taiwan fall.\n\nFigure 1 — US Indo-Pacific Command: ‘Why Taiwan Matters’\n\nSource: U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.[12]\n\nTesting Eisenhower, Biden, and Beyond: PRC Military Buildup and Displays of Force\n\nPowered by what for years was the world’s largest population and fastest-growing, multitrillion-dollar economy (distinctions achieved by India in 2023), China has achieved the most dramatic military buildup since World War II.[13] Leveraging its extensive human-organizational technology acquisition and application infrastructure, Beijing has built the largest air, land, sea, and rocket forces in the Indo-Pacific, and a substantial portion of this combat power is purposefully deployed against Taiwan.[14]\n\nBeijing already commands the world’s largest active-duty military force, ground forces, navy, other maritime forces, and overall conventional ballistic and cruise missile forces.[15] It also controls the region’s largest military aviation forces and what is “soon to be the world’s largest Air Force.”[16] According to the Pentagon, “China has the world’s leading hypersonic arsenal, and has dramatically advanced its development of both conventional and nuclear-armed hypersonic missile technologies during the past 20 years.”[17] As Appendix 5 details, under Xi, China has abandoned its previous relative numerical restraint in developing and deploying nuclear weapons and is now engaged in a historic buildup to firmly become a top-three nuclear power together with Russia and the United States.\n\nNuclear weapons policy is the sole preserve of China’s paramount leader. Here Xi is making his mark with a nuclear breakout that departs greatly from his predecessors’ relative quantitative restraint regarding the production and deployment of nuclear weapons. An extensively researched New York Times investigation reveals his prioritization and rationale: “Nineteen days after taking power as China’s leader, Xi Jinping convened the generals overseeing the country’s nuclear missiles and issued a blunt demand. China had to be ready for possible confrontation with a formidable adversary, he said, signaling that he wanted a more potent nuclear capability to counter the threat.”[18]\n\nNearly a dozen years later, China still refuses to explain its nuclear ramp-up publicly, or even to discuss it behind closed doors with the United States. However, the overall purpose is clear. Xi’s nuclear ramp-up is part of his goal to “build a strong strategic deterrent system” that he articulated in his report to the 20th Party Congress in 2022, drawing on previous doctrine and planning.[19] As the Pentagon explains, PRC deterrent system strengthening consists of both “the development of traditional nuclear deterrent force building and the construction of conventional strategic deterrent forces in emerging fields and technologies.” The chief motivation is likely “threat perceptions of the United States and … specific concerns over Taiwan.” Accordingly, Beijing views such efforts as a “‘trump card’ for safeguarding the PRC’s core interest of achieving unification with Taiwan.”[20] For the PRC under Xi, any considerations regarding arms racing, strategic instability, or escalation appear to be trumped by an overriding goal: to have demonstrated capabilities available in every domain and at every rung of the potential escalation ladder and thereby attempt to dissuade potential adversaries by convincing them that Beijing can meet and overcome them in any scenario — particularly regarding Taiwan.\n\nUnder the auspices of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), as part of an integrated air defense system extending robustly and redundantly out to 300 nautical miles (556 kilometers/km) from its coast, China also has one of the world’s largest, most sophisticated, and longest-range surface-to-air missile forces.[21] And with one of the world’s most extensive sets of surveillance and reconnaissance architecture, including a number of operational satellites second only to those of the United States, PRC forces are equipped with increasing accuracy and reliability. The Pentagon documents that “As of March 2022, China’s ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) satellite fleet contained more than 290 systems — a quantity second only to the United States, and nearly doubling China’s in-orbit systems since 2018.” Furthermore, “The PLA owns and operates about half of the world’s ISR systems, most of which could support monitoring, tracking, and targeting of U.S. and allied forces worldwide, especially throughout the Indo-Pacific region.”[22] Most recently, on June 17, 2024, General Stephen Whiting, Commander, U.S. Space Command, encapsulated China’s military space development and its terrestrial battlespace significance: “In the last six years, [China has] tripled the number of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellites they have on orbit. Hundreds and hundreds of satellites…purpose-built and designed to find, fix, track, target, and yes, potentially engage U.S. and allied forces across the Indo-Pacific AOR [area of responsibility].”[23]\n\nMeanwhile, in the maritime domain, the PLA Navy (PLAN) already operates considerably more battle force ships than the U.S. Navy, making it the world’s largest naval fleet numerically at over 370 ships and counting.[24] This margin is likely to increase throughout this decade of maximum danger as the world’s largest shipyard infrastructure continues to pursue the most extensive and fastest production-capacity expansion since World War II and a buildout of naval power unparalleled in the modern era.[25] Even with the PLAN having transferred 22 Jiangdao-class corvettes to China’s Coast Guard in 2021, the Pentagon anticipates 395 PLAN ships by 2025 and 435 by 2030.[26] All told, a substantial portion of China’s armed forces is effectively dedicated to addressing various aspects of a potential Taiwan contingency. “China’s official defense budget continues to grow to around $230 billion in 2022, about 12 times larger than Taiwan’s defense budget,” the Pentagon explains, “with much of China’s defense budget focused on developing the capability to unify Taiwan with the PRC by force.”[27] Regardless of how analysts measure and quantify China’s defense budget, it is clear that Beijing controls an enormous and powerful arsenal that targets Taiwan tremendously.\n\nSince its establishment in 1949, the PRC has been threatening Taiwan with an increasing array of military forces and activities. Figure 2 depicts the nearly 75 years of CCP-directed efforts from the perspective of Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense.\n\nUnder Xi today, China’s armed forces offer an increasing menu of coercive options. PRC “responses” to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other U.S. officials in April 2023 in California illustrate the evolving trend. Both involved premeditated, punitive PLA pouncing. Known as the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis of 2022, the PLA’s military exercises during this time were even more aggressive than those during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995–96.[28] They occurred simultaneously and in close proximity to Taiwan’s main island and were unprecedented in the number of affected zones. PLA activities through the end of August 2022 and beyond seemed designed to impose “confusion and uncertainty,” assert a “new status quo” or a “new normal,” and exploit a “battle lab” for practicing operations relevant to the conduct of future military campaigns.[29]\n\nPelosi traveled to Taipei on Aug. 2–3, 2022. As early as July 28, Beijing commenced military activities and coordinated messaging in an attempt to deter her from visiting Taiwan. After that failed, China announced live-fire exercises and live-fire drills in the South China Sea (Aug. 2–6), flew PLA aircraft close to the strait centerline on Aug. 2, and ominously cancelled civilian flights at multiple Fujian Province airports.[30] The day after Pelosi’s departure, PLA forces rapidly launched unprecedented activities including simulated joint blockade and joint firepower strike training operations in six zones surrounding Taiwan that would have required significant advance preparation.[31] Furthermore, the PLA Rocket Force (PLARF) fired ballistic missiles into impact zones in waters surrounding Taiwan and conducted unprecedented overflights of Taiwan’s main island itself with at least four ballistic missiles.[32] Five ballistic missiles even landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone, with one ballistic missile reportedly landing near Japan’s Yonaguni Island, only 68 miles from the coast of northeastern Taiwan’s Yilan county.[33] “I saw a big splash of water when the missile fell into the sea,” recalls Yonaguni local Shotaro Maja. “We were very worried.”[34] Residents of Matsu, with whom one of the authors met and spoke with extensively there in March 2024, suggested that it was possible to see and hear missiles flying overhead from the small archipelago near PRC shores in Fujian province. Matsu’s 36 islands and islets are among Taiwan’s 168 outlying islands and features, many of which are both strategically situated and acutely vulnerable to PRC predations.\n\nMilitary drills conducted by the Eastern Theater Command included flying more than 250 fighter aircraft into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and operating 13 PLAN vessels around Taiwan.[35] On Aug. 5 alone, the PLA deployed 68 aircraft and 13 vessels around Taiwan. It dispatched 49 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ and across the median line, the second-highest on a single day. From Aug. 2–8, the number of PLA aircraft entering Taiwan’s ADIZ each day rose nearly tenfold from prior baselines to 26 per day on average.[36] These acts caused merchant ships to delay sailing to Taiwan’s largest port, Kaohsiung.[37]\n\nFigure 2 — Growing PRC Threats Since 1949 as Depicted by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense\n\nSource: ROC National Defense Report 2023.[38]\n\nFigure 3 — PRC Military Exercises Surrounding Taiwan, 1995–96 Versus 2022\n\nSource: Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).[39]\n\nFigure 4 — PLARF Ballistic Missile Flights Over and Proximate to Taiwan, Aug. 4, 2022\n\nSource: CSIS.[40]\n\nOnly a few months passed before Beijing’s next set of cross-strait drills and signaling. Having increased military operations during President Tsai Ing-wen’s seventh transit of the United States in late March and early April 2023, China launched its strongest-yet military response to any of the 27 transits to date by a Taiwanese leader. En route to Guatemala and Belize, Tsai stopped in New York City on March 29–31, where she was received by then-Taiwan Representative to the United States Hsiao Bi-khim (now Taiwan’s vice president) and newly appointed American Institute in Taiwan Chairperson Laura Rosenberger. On the way back through the United States, Tsai stopped in Los Angeles. At the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, she met with then-House Speaker McCarthy and other congressional leaders.[41] Figure 5 shows major military activities conducted by the PRC that coincided with the final portion of Tsai’s transit.\n\nOn April 8, the day after Tsai’s return to Taipei, the PLA announced and launched large-scale “joint sword” military exercises around the island. It engaged in a panoply of drills and apparent signaling operations through April 30, in close coordination with PRC diplomatic, informational, and other activities.[42] PRC state media explicitly described simulated strikes on Taiwan through the exercises.[43] China also flew at least 283 air sorties near the island and deployed nearly 50 PLAN vessels, including a strike group led by the aircraft carrier Shandong in the Philippine Sea.[44] Additionally, in what may well prove a harbinger of ambiguous but challenging efforts to come, on April 5, China announced (but did not implement) Coast Guard inspections of ships in the Taiwan Strait:\n\n“China announced a three-day ‘special joint patrol and inspection operation’ in the central and northern areas of the Taiwan Strait. As part of this operation, Chinese maritime law enforcement officials were tasked with conducting on-site inspections (现场检查) aboard vessels in the Taiwan Strait, but there were no reports of such on-site inspections taking place. The operation was led by China’s first large-scale patrol vessel in the Taiwan Strait, the Haixun 06. Vessels from the Fujian Maritime Safety Administration, East China Sea Rescue Bureau and the East China Sea Maritime Security Center joined. Notably, the first law enforcement patrol the Haixun 06 embarked on occurred during then-Speaker of the House Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022. In response to Haixun 06’s April 2023 operations, Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau issued a statement that relevant shipping companies have been told to refuse these inspections.”[45]\n\nSubsequently, China’s armed forces continue to develop and drill with a broad range of increasingly formidable capabilities relevant to various Taiwan contingencies, some exquisitely attuned thereto. In October 2022, for example, amphibious landing exercises on PRC Taiwan Strait beaches included seven retrofitted roll-on, roll-off (RO-RO) car ferries, operated by Maritime Militia personnel.[46]\n\nFigure 5 — Major PRC Military Activities Through Last Part of Tsai’s April 2023 US Transit\n\nSource: CSIS.[47]\n\nThe nature of the threat is constantly evolving, but its essential dynamics reflect historical patterns seen during the Cold War, a period during which American leaders maintained peace through great strength and statesmanship. Over six decades ago, during both of his terms in office, America’s 34th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, faced Taiwan-related challenges that starkly underscored the stakes if Taiwan’s offshore islands, and by extension its main island, fell to Communist aggression. Unlike General Douglas MacArthur — who, on the brink of the Korean War, foretold Taiwan’s future potential for economic prosperity and political openness — President Eisenhower does not express such foresight in available historical records.[48] Nevertheless, both five-star generals — two of only nine servicemen to attain such rank in American history — with access to the greatest government analyses of their time, independently came to the same realization: Taiwan’s status was pivotal, both geopolitically worldwide, and for regional and American security.\n\nFigure 6 — PLA ‘Joint Sword’ Exercises, April 2023\n\nSource: CSIS.[49]\n\nMacArthur was surely familiar with the 1948 Joint Chiefs of Staff study that demarcated an American defensive perimeter running from the Aleutian Islands south through Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines.[50] He explicitly linked the Pacific Island Chains to American constraint of Communist hostility, with Taiwan (then called Formosa by U.S. officials) serving as an irreplaceable linchpin.[51] MacArthur did so most memorably in his farewell address to Congress in 1951:\n\n“Of … direct and immediate bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of the Pacific Ocean in the course of the past war. Prior thereto, the Western strategic frontier of the United States lay on the littoral lines of the Americas with an exposed island salient extending out through Hawaii, Midway, and Guam to the Philippines. That salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue of weakness along which the enemy could and did attack. The Pacific was a potential area of advance for any predatory force intent upon striking at the bordering land areas.\n\nAll this was changed by our Pacific victory. Our strategic frontier then shifted to embrace the entire Pacific Ocean which became a vast moat to protect us as long as we hold it. Indeed, it acts as a protective shield for all of the Americas and all free lands of the Pacific Ocean area. We control it to the shores of Asia by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the Aleutians to the Marianas held by us and our free allies.\n\nFrom this island chain we can dominate with sea and air power every Asiatic port from Vladivostok to Singapore and prevent any hostile movement into the Pacific. Any predatory attack from Asia must be an amphibious effort. No amphibious force can be successful without control of the sea lanes and air over those lands in its avenue of advance. With naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases, any major attack from continental Asia toward us or our friends of the Pacific would be doomed to failure. Under such conditions the Pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of encroach for a prospective invader — it assumes instead the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake. Our line of defense is a natural one. … It envisions no attack against anyone nor does it provide the bastions essential for offensive operations, but properly maintained would be an invincible defense against aggression.\n\nThe holding of this littoral defense line in the Western Pacific is entirely dependent on holding all segments thereof, for any major breach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other segment. This is a military estimate as to which I have yet to find a military leader who will take exception. For that reason I have strongly recommended in the past as a matter of military urgency that under no circumstances must Formosa fall under Communist control. Such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the Philippines and the loss of Japan, and might well force our Western frontier back to the coasts of California, Oregon\n\nand Washington.”[52]\n\nEisenhower was alerted to the First Taiwan Strait Crisis (Sept. 3, 1954–May 1, 1955) when handed a message at around 7 pm on Sept. 3 at his Summer White House in Denver. Just over three hours earlier, “the Chinese Communists had begun a heavy shelling of Quemoy Island. … Two Americans in uniform had been killed; fourteen were being evacuated.”[53] Eisenhower sent a top-secret teletype to his trusted advisor Walter Bedell Smith, then under secretary of state, asking, “What are the Chiefs of Staff suggestions about Quemoy?”[54]\n\nIn Chapter 19 of his memoirs, “Formosa Doctrine,” Eisenhower offers a captivating account of the 1954 crisis and his decision-making therein. What stands out, after some of the particulars have receded into history, is his consistent vision of larger American stakes and his insistence on upholding them prudently but firmly.\n\nThe gravity of the crisis spurred wide-ranging debate in Congress and among American allies about what parts of Taiwan to support and defend, and at what cost. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, a staunch defender of European security a decade earlier, questioned the value of Taiwan’s offshore islands. During the crisis, the two World War II heroes engaged in friendly but forceful correspondence on the subject. On Sept. 7, through Under Secretary of State Smith, Eisenhower conveyed a top-secret message to Churchill. He stressed that “all along the Eastern edge of Asia, from the Bering Sea to Indonesia, there is a constantly boiling kettle of possible trouble.” His primary concern was “an aggression out of continental China against Formosa.” Eisenhower underscored his belief “that America is morally bound to take such action under these circumstances and that it would be definitely in the interests of the whole free world to do so.”[55]\n\nEisenhower emphatically linked Taiwan’s offshore islands to the critical importance of the island chains, which MacArthur had likewise stressed were vital to containing Communist aggression. Eisenhower emphasized the paramount need to “assure the integrity of the island barrier in the Pacific” and Taiwan’s importance therein: “We rounded out the far Pacific security chain by a Treaty with the Nationalists.”[56] This was, in fact, one of the five supporting points of the Formosa Resolution: “the secure possession by friendly governments of the Western Pacific Island Chain, of which Formosa is a part, is essential to the vital interests of the United States and all friendly nations in or bordering upon the Pacific Ocean.”[57] “Ever since World War II,” Eisenhower recapitulated, “the United States had recognized the strategic necessity of maintaining the integrity of the Western Pacific island chain, including Formosa as one of its principal links. Our readiness to go to the defense of that island, if it were attacked, had been announced as governmental policy before I was inaugurated, and I had personally emphasized the importance of this island’s safety to our nation’s security.”[58] It was with this framing that Eisenhower appealed to Churchill through geostrategic reasoning. “It is probably difficult for you, in your geographical position, to understand how concerned this country is with the solidarity of the Island Barrier in the Western Pacific,” he wrote in response to Churchill’s concerns expressed in a letter and accompanying memorandum. “Moreover, we are concerned that the psychological effect of deserting our friends on Formosa would risk a collapse of Asiatic resistance to the Communists. Such possibilities cannot be lightly dismissed; in our view they are almost as important, in the long term, to you as they are to us.”[59]\n\nEisenhower was adamant that ceding offshore islands to the CCP was not a solution. “What they are really interested in is Formosa — and later on Japan,” he reasoned. “Therefore, I think, that if the Chinese Nationalists got out of Quemoy and the Matsus, they would not be solving the real problem, which is far more basic.”[60] Eisenhower acknowledged that “responsible and intelligent citizens questioned the United States policy.” Nevertheless, he insisted that overall considerations of national interest trumped legalistic technicalities: “our strategic situation would be seriously — possibly even fatally — damaged in the western Pacific if we should lose Formosa to the Communists.”[61] In the end, Eisenhower believed he had used Mao’s own protracted war strategy against him: “In the Formosa Strait in 1955 we refused to retreat, and the enemy, true to his formula, for a while tried harassment but refused to attack. The crisis had cooled; it would not heat up again for three years.”[62]\n\nEisenhower addresses the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis (Aug. 23–Dec. 2, 1958) in Chapter 12 of the second volume of his memoirs, appropriately titled “The Troubled Islands Again—Quemoy and Matsu, 1958.” Soviet military buildup and aggression had been a defining feature of the previous three years. Meanwhile, the CCP “had built a complex of military airfields in the Fukien area near the coast that would enable them to launch air attacks not only against the tiny offshore islands but against the main Chinese Nationalist base on Formosa as well. Extensive artillery emplacements now almost ringed Quemoy.”[63] As CCP belligerence intensified, Eisenhower and his administration faced scenarios that reverberate to this day. “We had to consider that the Chinese Communists might attempt to starve out the offshore islands by blockade,” Eisenhower related. “There was also the possibility of an amphibious assault against the offshore islands, against Formosa, or both. There was the likelihood that they might employ air forces to strike the Nationalists’ airfields on Formosa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff thought they would.”[64]\n\nThen, as before, Eisenhower saw tremendous stakes. “This modern possibility that ‘for want of a nail, a shoe was lost’ had led to reaffirmation of the conclusion that Quemoy and Matsu were essential to America’s security,” he recalled in his memoirs. “Moreover, the Communist threats and propaganda were never directed primarily to those two small island groups; rather, the announced objective was Formosa.”[65] Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, in whom Eisenhower placed special trust, “pointed out that the ties between the offshore islands and Formosa have become closer, that their interdependence has increased, and that he believed that it would be ‘highly hazardous’ for anyone to assume that if the Chinese Communists were to attempt to change the situation by force and now attack or seek to conquer these islands, that it could be a limited operation.”[66]\n\nEisenhower expressed these positions firmly to domestic political stakeholders and foreign allies alike.[67] In response to a fearful letter from 91-year-old Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator T.F. Green, Eisenhower stated, “The Chinese and Soviet Communist leaders assert, and have reason to believe, that if they can take Quemoy and Matsu by armed assault that will open the way for them to take Formosa and the Pescadores and, as they put it, ‘expel’ the United States from the West Pacific and cause its Fleet to leave international waters and ‘go home’.”[68]\n\nAcross the array of plausible scenarios, Eisenhower and his advisors judged America’s role to be determinative. “We concluded that if the Reds became convinced that the United States would avoid intervention, they would in all likelihood launch an amphibious assault against Quemoy and possibly Matsu,” he recalled.[69] “On the other hand, if the Communists were convinced that we would come to the aid of Quemoy, they would probably refrain from outright attack, confining their actions, at least initially, to blockade and interdiction tactics.” As for the Eisenhower administration, “once we had intervened with major military force to save Quemoy, we would accept nothing less than victory; only in this way could we maintain the confidence of the Free World.”[70]\n\nThis Second Taiwan Crisis subsided as CCP forces settled for shelling Nationalist convoys on odd-numbered days of the month, while allowing unhindered resupply of the offshore island garrisons on even-numbered days. Eisenhower experienced a subsequent echo of what would become a two-decade limited barrage when he met with Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei on June 19–20, 1960.[71] “Free China lived under the threat of the Chinese Communists to take Formosa by force,” he reflected in his memoirs. “Indeed, to emphasize this, the Reds welcomed my arrival on Formosa with an intensive bombardment of Matsu and Quemoy.”[72] To this day, Eisenhower remains the only sitting American president to have visited Taiwan. While there are some differences with the present era, Eisenhower’s vision, challenges, and decisions regarding the threatened strategic island merit revisiting and offer insights relevant in this critical decade, as Taiwan’s future once again hangs in the balance.\n\nAnnexation Short of Outright Invasion Could be Potent for China, Devastating for US Interests\n\nWhy does Beijing choose to overtly operate its armed forces when it has many other means to pressure Taiwan? One plausible explanation is that demonstrated (and implicit) capacity to use force is the “anvil” against which China can threaten to pound Taiwan. A credible, solid anvil amplifies the impact of the many nonmilitary tools Beijing wields as part of its all-domain pressure campaign, spanning the gamut of comprehensive national power in the economic, diplomatic, cultural, informational, law enforcement, criminal (triad links), gray zone warfare, and technological arenas.[73] Moreover, China’s governance system can tightly coordinate the economic, diplomatic, informational, and military actions necessary to attempt to incrementally erode Taiwan’s autonomy in ways short of provoking U.S. intervention.\n\nA PRC endeavor to coercively assume control of Taiwan with the least possible escalation is a substantially higher probability than a large D-Day-style invasion, at least as an initial attempt. Such an approach aligns well with Beijing’s practice of exerting political influence through all-domain pressure campaigns while attempting to minimize the risk of wars that, in the best case, could undermine the PRC’s longer-term growth and development objectives and, in the worst case, could threaten the CCP’s hold on power.[74] Accordingly, Beijing is trying first to employ a “united front” approach, including the use of what it calls the “three warfares” — public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare — to undermine Taiwan’s democracy and the public will to resist in pursuit of “peaceful reunification” and “winning without fighting.”[75] In its latest annual report, the Defense Intelligence Agency forecasts that “Beijing will continue to apply military and economic pressure as well as public messaging and influence activities while promoting long-term cross-Strait economic and social integration to induce Taiwan to move toward unification. … Beijing will use even stronger measures to push back against perceived increases in U.S. support to Taiwan.”[76]\n\nA PRC takeover of Taiwan accomplished somehow through “winning without fighting” (or “winning with relatively little fighting”) could potentially allow Beijing to capture its industrial and technological infrastructure intact. En route to victory, Beijing could tactically retreat from ineffective actions and, over time, erode Taipei’s will to resist. Such an approach could pose serious strategic dilemmas for the United States, Japan, and other countries by forcing them to 1) confront PRC actions and thereby be accused of “destabilizing” behavior or 2) stand by as Beijing consolidates a status quo that can then serve as a launchpad for further coercive actions that would narrow the scope of available options for Taiwan and its allies to maneuver. Absent substantial remedial actions, the erosion of Taiwan’s will to resist could compound over time, setting the stage for Beijing to gradually paint Taiwan’s leadership into a corner where it believes there remains only a stark binary choice between military conflict or a political and economic merger with China. Figure 7 situates coercive annexation within Beijing’s larger ecosystem of options for attempting to impose its will on Taiwan.\n\nCoercive annexation is in many ways China’s strongest strategy for attempting a takeover of Taiwan. Not only would this approach allow China to try to leverage ambiguity, it would also allow for temporary face-saving retreats from ineffective actions under almost any circumstance, short of the extremely unlikely event of Taiwan declaring formal independence. It could also steadily pressure Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and others to either publicly escalate the situation or else run the risk that inaction solidifies into a new status quo favoring PRC demands. As options for third party intervention narrow, Beijing’s latitude to “persuade” Taiwan that annexation offers the best resolution widens.\n\nChina is already coercing Taiwan using all instruments of national power. While the military angles are relatively easy to identify, tracing the targeted economic restrictions that the PRC is currently imposing, the ongoing PRC information campaign, and Beijing’s progressive diplomatic isolation of Taipei further illustrate the coercive trend line. It is not just that Beijing will apply these tools in the future; it is applying them now. However, as we subsequently discuss, there are additional tools that the PRC might bring to bear in an attempt to coercively annex Taiwan. All told, the PRC would likely employ a combination of its many instruments of national power to achieve coercive annexation.\n\nHistorically speaking, coercive annexation with limited escalation is less common than direct land grabs or outright conquest, but it aligns better with Beijing’s objective of bringing Taiwan under PRC political control while minimizing the risk of a war that would almost certainly undermine China’s longer-term growth and development objectives.\n\nFigure 7 — Where Coercive Annexation Fits into China’s Spectrum of Options\n\nVis-à-Vis Taiwan\n\nSource: Gabriel Collins and Andrew S. Erickson, authors.\n\nCoercive annexation aims to place the onus of escalation on Taipei and Washington, as well as other key stakeholders.[77] Ambiguity, a core feature in Beijing’s doctrinal operating system, enhances PRC dominance in this area. PLA writings suggest a substantial acceptance of a “quasi-war” or a blurred state that is not quite war and not quite peace.[78] Some of these writings explicitly note that the objective of quasi-war activities is to deter and intimidate the adversary in order to “create the conditions for a political solution.”[79] While not explicitly stated, PRC operational ambiguity may also be designed to amplify the impact of the longstanding U.S. policy of “strategic ambiguity” as to whether or not Washington would militarily defend Taiwan. In particular, the PRC aims to use military force to maximally pressure Taipei to submit while refraining from a D-Day-style assault — thus leaving space for decision-makers in Washington and allied nations to generate rationales for avoiding intervention.\n\nA porous blockade, for example, might offer Beijing the prospect of substantial coercive leverage, the exercise of which might possibly fall below the threshold at which the United States, as well as key allies and partners, would intervene with kinetic force. By emphasizing “coercion” (blocking weapons but allowing key items through, such as baseline food and energy supplies, semiconductor inputs, and finished microchips) over “domination” (a much tighter blockade familiar to Western militaries), Beijing could attempt to enlist Taiwan’s foreign commercial counterparties to pressure their home governments to accept the PRC’s actions, lest they suffer disruption in access to semiconductors and other Taiwanese exports that collectively underpin tens of trillions of dollars’ worth of global commerce annually.[80] Lack of a decisive foreign intervention would solidify PRC de facto control as the new status quo and, over time, erode Taiwanese confidence in the United States. Beijing would hope to dominate the cross-strait cognitive space, which it would attempt to parlay into preeminence in the economic, political, and physical domains. Beijing’s end goal: a “political solution” of “peaceful reunification” through Taiwan effectively becoming subsumed under Beijing’s authority and control.\n\nCoercive annexation generally intensifies over time as the aggressor paints the victim into a corner and then culminates in what can be a more precipitous move to complete the fait accompli. For a relevant historical example, consider that Imperial Japan annexed the disputed Takeshima/Dokdo Islands in January 1905 and placed Korea’s ability to conduct foreign affairs under Japanese control in November 1905, but waited until August 1910 to formally annex Korea despite having exerted de facto control for years.[81] Fortunately, Taiwan in 2024 has much stronger links to the international community than Korea in 1905. But the slow roll toward the de facto dominance approach is one Beijing understands well. Indeed, it has demonstrated this with its creeping militarization of the South China Sea over the past decade.\n\nEven more importantly, PRC actions over the past two to three years reflect an intensifying focus on setting the stage for coercive annexation. Consider, for instance, the April 2023 deployment of China Coast Guard vessels into the Taiwan Strait and public statements that ships traversing the strait could be boarded as part of a safety operation following President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with then-U.S. House Speaker McCarthy.[82] While not actively operationalized at the time, China’s actions laid the conceptual groundwork for more extensive assertions of maritime sovereignty surrounding Taiwan, with the potential to escalate to a “customs quarantine” or various sorts of blockades enforced by the China Coast Guard and/or Maritime Militia on the low end, and PLA Navy and other military forces under higher-end scenarios.\n\nThe Decade of Maximum Danger\n\nPresident Biden and his successors face a far more formidable PRC and paramount leader, compared to the one Eisenhower successfully deterred twice over six decades ago. Between now and roughly 2030, General Secretary Xi, the CCP, and the PRC will likely reach the apogee of their respective powers.[83]\n\nThe situation could scarcely be more urgent. Admiral John Aquilino’s final testimony as commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command is bracing. “All indications point to the PLA meeting President Xi Jinping’s directive to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Furthermore, the PLA’s actions indicate their ability to meet Xi’s preferred timeline to unify Taiwan with mainland China by force if directed,” Aquilino stated on March 24, 2024. “Modernization has remained aggressive, and China remains committed to delivering the capabilities needed to achieve its objective by 2027.”[84]The 2027 date is not an arbitrary or abstract U.S. government extrapolation but rather Xi’s completion deadline for his Centennial Military Building Goal. By this date, Xi has ordered China’s armed forces to provide him with a potent toolbox of capabilities — clearly intended to enable a full range of military options against Taiwan.[85]\n\nThe precise moment when China’s power has “peaked” will only become apparent in hindsight. However, its leadership will likely discern gathering factors beforehand that heighten their sense of time pressure, potentially leading to precipitous actions that a country more confident in its continued ascent would not undertake. There is no political-historical prize more tempting to Xi than Taiwan, and no greater target of concerted preparations to generate actionable options for coercion. As a result, U.S. and allied policymakers have now fully entered a decade of maximum danger, and the strategic stakes are commensurately high.\n\nTaiwan influences U.S. national security in ways far more profound than the island’s Florida-sized population of nearly 24 million or its small physical dimensions (slightly smaller than the Netherlands or roughly the size Maryland and Delaware combined) superficially suggest. Coercive annexation of Taiwan would substantially bolster China in the ongoing competition between two global paradigms. The first is an international order led by the United States that prioritizes universal principles beneficial to all, such as freedom of the global commons and the preservation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of smaller states. The second falls under China’s Leninist leadership, which operates without restraint on the premise of “might makes right.” As the Pentagon emphasizes, “The 2022 National Security Strategy states that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the only competitor to the United States with the intent and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order.”[86] Annexation of Taiwan would strengthen Beijing’s quest to establish a PRC-centric international order dominated by autocratic governance. Under this framework, smaller states would constantly be subjected to the territorial depredations of those larger and more powerful, creating a dynamic often referred to as the “clash of systems.”[87] Moreover, annexation would likely trigger a technological supply chain crisis of unprecedented scale, reverse an 80-year period of rapid global improvement in human well-being, and sow the seeds of future conflicts.\n\nThe aftermath of a coercive annexation of Taiwan would adversely impact Americans’ security and well-being to a far greater degree than what would have happened if Operation Desert Storm failed in 1991 and Saddam Hussein retained control of Kuwait, exerting influence over vital Persian Gulf energy resources (which at that point in time supported about 27% of total global oil production).[88] The cutting-edge chips that only Taiwan can make at maximum sophistication and scale are the key currency of our big data and tech-driven world. If its fabrication facilities (fabs) are damaged, destroyed, or fall under PRC operational control, the consequences would be severe, as the following sections will illustrate in depth.\n\nNearly 40 years ago, Deng Xiaoping noted that, with respect to the PRC goal of unification with Taiwan, “If it cannot be accomplished in 100 years, it will be in 1,000 years.”[89] While made in the context of a broader discussion that explicitly named use of force as an option, Deng’s statement (and a similar one from Mao 12 years prior) suggests that the CCP’s most foundational paramount leaders saw wisdom in strategic patience. Pragmatism might have arisen in part from lack of capability — a constraint increasingly inapplicable to Xi, who commands a rapidly modernizing PLA and a level of economic, diplomatic, and informational advantage that none of his predecessors enjoyed.[90] Xi marked his impatience early in his rule, noting in an October 2013 speech ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit that “the issue of political disagreements that exist between the two sides must reach a final resolution, step by step, and these issues cannot be passed on from generation to generation.”[91] As capability more strongly supports intent, it is plausible to conclude that Xi would attempt to coercively annex Taiwan if he calculates his probability of success to be sufficiently high and the costs sufficiently predictable, but he will likely be deterred so long as his probability of success remains too low to justify the tremendous risks involved and the costs too unpredictable.[92]\n\nThe deterrence burden for Taiwan, the United States, and our allies is thus heavy but vital. China became the world’s second largest economy and an influential global power without Taiwan under its political control, meaning parties on all sides will lose if Beijing attempts to force the issue violently. Unfortunately, warnings of economic damage or threats to progress alone may prove insufficient to successfully deter Xi. Revisionists are often willing to trade blood and economic prospects for territory, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine graphically demonstrates. In an Indo-Pacific context, actions Washington might see as “irrational” may instead appear “irreplaceable” to Xi as he pursues the so-called “China Dream” of national rejuvenation to ensure control at home and deference abroad. This ideological campaign aims to ensure that the Party and Xi himself remain in absolute control of China’s economic, political, and military power structure. Expressed differently, the CCP’s apparent entanglement of Taiwan’s subjugation with Party legitimacy means that Xi is unlikely to spontaneously self-deter. The United States and its allies must therefore strive to make Xi conclude that today, tomorrow, next year, and several years hence are too risky to attempt the coercive annexation of Taiwan. To underscore that urgency, the following sections examine some of the foremost adverse strategic consequences were such deterrence efforts to fail.\n\nConsequence 1: Semiconductor Starvation (or Coercion)\n\nAs a global commodity, microchips are as important as oil — if not more so. Indeed, they are less easy to acquire from alternative sources, and their relative value is growing quickly while that of oil is diminishing. If China could capture Taiwan with minimal direct use of military force, it could potentially obtain a near-monopoly over one of the 21st century’s most critical economic inputs. That could help to catapult Beijing into a position of global preeminence and, in turn, might allow China to dominate the world economy even in the face of sanctions (which may be temporally limited, especially when allied governments realize how difficult it is to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency).\n\nSemiconductors are indispensable linchpins of the modern economy, with approximately $600 billion worth now produced globally each year.[93] These are incorporated into physical items collectively worth multiple trillions of dollars, and the services delivered by these devices amount to tens of trillions of dollars annually.[94] Microchips power smartphones, data centers, and high-performance computing applications like artificial intelligence (AI), as well as the electronic brains controlling systems in aircraft, cars, tools, machinery, and many other items. Unlike oil, however, the very latest generation silicon chips (node size 5 nanometers/nm or less) are presently produced in only two places — Taiwan (by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited/TSMC) and, to a lesser extent, South Korea (by Samsung) (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 — Map of Key Global Chip Fabrication Plants\n\nSource: Company reports; industry media; authors’ analysis.[95]\n\nNote: Red denotes <=28 nm, a.k.a. “advanced” chips; numbered clusters indicate number of semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) within a close vicinity.\n\nThis geography, and its perilous proximity to China, is no accident. It has been critically shaped by decades of American government and corporate alliances, investment, and supply chain development as well as advanced Asian counterparts that pursued microchip production for prosperity, security, and the binding power of American interests.[96] From a growth and production standpoint, the results have proven stupendously successful. Taiwan now accounts for about 90% of global production of the most advanced chips and about half of semiconductor “foundry” capacity worldwide. It also serves top global tech firms that no longer operate their own chip fabs, including Apple, Google, and NVIDIA.[97]\n\nEven in scenarios short of a full invasion, PRC coercive actions — and the reactions of commercial firms supplying energy and other resources to Taiwan — could very plausibly interrupt the production of semiconductors and other key industrial goods.[98]\n\nTaiwan Chip Disruption Would Be Far Worse Than Shortfall During Pandemic\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, microchip output never fell absolutely but instead lagged behind demand (Figure 9).[99] Deloitte estimates that this chip shortage cost the world economy more than $500 billion in lost revenue in 2021.[100] One of the hardest hit sectors, automobile production, saw global output fall by nearly 8 million vehicles in 2021, roughly 10% of output in a typical year.[101]Yet the shortages primarily affected older chip technologies, such as automobile applications’ legacy 40-nm node.\n\nWhen the pandemic first hit and demand for cars declined precipitously, carmakers’ reduced microchip orders forced semiconductor manufacturers to pursue other markets that required more advanced chips, ultimately resulting in the closure of facilities making the older, but still important, chips.[102] The resulting gap in the market seriously affected makers of multiple devices and machines, including cars, forklifts, and other mechanical implements.[103]In contrast, a Google Pixel 4a smartphone with its 8-nm Qualcomm central processing unit fabricated in Korea by Samsung could\n\nbe procured directly from Google for delivery in two to three days with no\n\nprice inflation.[104]\n\nA disruption of microchip supplies from Taiwan would go far beyond the recent semiconductor shortage and massively affect high-end applications while also impacting legacy chip nodes. Semiconductor fabs on the island produce a disproportionate volume of the world’s most sophisticated transistor packages, with the state-of-the-art mass production node size now down to 3 nm — 1/40th the diameter of a SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and small enough for more than 30,000 transistors to fit atop the diameter of a human hair.[105] The most powerful chips in the world, whether in iPhones, NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI applications, or bespoke data center servers at Microsoft or Google, overwhelmingly come from Taiwanese plants — specifically, those run by TSMC.\n\nFigure 9 — Global Semiconductor Units Sold, Monthly, 3-Month Moving Average\n\nSources: Semiconductor Industry Association; authors’ analysis.[106]\n\nHow Would a Sustained Taiwan Chip Outage Affect the Global Economy?\n\nHumanity’s appetite for computing power has grown relentlessly.[107] Much as cheap energy from Russia was until recently a core driver of German economic power, the abundant supply of Taiwanese semiconductors has been a key driver of global technological progress.[108] Thanks to Taiwanese manufacturers’ efficient scaling, transistors now only cost billionths of a cent apiece, or tens to hundreds of dollars for extremely powerful semiconductor chips.\n\nA major disruption of Taiwan-origin semiconductor supplies would likely temporarily halt human technological progress and could retard global economic growth for years thereafter. This is because microchip production lines constructed elsewhere to replace damaged or PRC-controlled facilities in Taiwan could take a minimum of two to three years to bring into service even under accelerated replacement programs.[109] Five years might be a more realistic estimate given the depth and complexity of multinational supply chains producing silicon wafers, chemicals like photoresists and exotic gases, and other critical inputs, and the need to effectively replicate the highly skilled workforce that builds and maintains fabs on the island. [110] The length of time likely needed to reconstitute supply chains matters, because chips are ubiquitous in everything from automobiles to high-performance computing facilities that power cutting-edge drug discovery and genomics research.[111] Each year of delay in resuming chip supplies at pretakeover levels would introduce cascading losses in the global economy.\n\nAs computing power is deployed, its innovation and productivity effects tend to compound upon each other and are multiplicative (i.e., exponential) rather than additive (linear), as most other basic commodities such as oil, copper, corn, etc., tend to be. As former Google CEO and Chairman Eric Schmidt explains, “Faster airplanes did not help build faster airplanes, but faster computers will help build faster computers.”[112] However, the corollary of generative progress is that when the system is starved of the crucial inputs driving the progress (cheap computing power), direct and opportunity costs will also likely feed off each other and grow exponentially.\n\nLosing Taiwanese chip supplies would shatter that virtuous cycle. Unlike oil and gas, which can be more easily sourced from different suppliers, high-end semiconductors lack such fungibility. It would take years to build and activate high-end chip production facilities to replace Taiwanese foundries. Each month of delay in resuming chip supplies at precrisis levels would cause compounding global economic losses and stall progress in critical fields, including next-generation energy technologies and hypersonics. Inferior substitutes would in a best case require massively increased electricity use — with tremendous energy costs and climate security dangers — merely to deliver critical societal functions at reduced performance and potential. In the more probable case, global computing power would effectively be capped for a prolonged period, with profound economic, political, and human impacts.\n\nLoss of Taiwanese semiconductor supplies from war damage or a global sanctions effort against China for coercively annexing Taiwan would thus likely trigger a global economic cataclysm at the very least on a par with the global financial crisis of 2007–09. That event’s cumulative losses ran as high as $22 trillion in the United States alone, according to estimates from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).[113] Financial market participants see a semiconductor disruption as causing still worse economic impacts. For instance, Citadel CEO Kenneth Griffin stated at a November 2022 conference that he believed “If we lose access to Taiwanese semiconductors, the hit to U.S. GDP is probably in the order of magnitude of 5% to 10%. It’s an immediate Great Depression.”[114] The longer-term effects on the global and U.S. economies could be unprecedented in scale and scope.\n\nHistorical examples bolster Griffin’s estimate. World War II offers a concerning historical benchmark. It was the largest economic disruption for at least the past 120 years — featuring a peak global GDP loss of 6% year on year between 1944 and 1945 and even larger cumulative impacts.[115] Yet this net number understates the impact outside the United States itself. The American economy increased in size nearly 2.5 times between 1939 and 1945 as the United States rallied for war, mobilized industrial capacity idled by the Great Depression, and became the “arsenal of democracy.”[116] This significantly decreased the economic downturn’s severity on a net global basis. None of the positive prerequisites that existed during World War II, such as spare U.S. industrial capacity, remain. A loss of semiconductor access would play out differently — and likely, worse. The world’s most productive economies are also the most semiconductor-hungry and thus could face disproportionate impacts that would magnify the effects of a global slowdown rather than ameliorating them as the United States did during World War II. A loss of Taiwanese semiconductors could thus realistically trigger an economic disruption even worse than that of World War II — with impacts potentially resounding for years.\n\nIt is instructive to consider the impacts of World War II on industrialized countries in Europe (as well as Japan), which were far more exposed to the losses imposed by cessation of trade, loss of raw material supplies, physical damage, and other privations of conflict compared to the relatively self-sufficient U.S. economy. Robert Barro’s seminal academic paper on the topic, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, reveals that the decline in real per capita GDP in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Norway during World War II ranged from 24% to nearly 60%, with impacts accruing over periods of one to six years, depending on the country.[117]Even countries that were not directly impacted by kinetic activity still experienced deep recessions, with Peru’s real per capita GDP declining 18% between 1941 and 1943, and Venezuela’s falling by 22% between 1939 and 1942.[118]While not perfectly analogous to a substantial disruption of semiconductor supplies from Taiwan, the World War II historical examples show how events that curtail trade and raw material supplies have tremendous impacts and leave little sanctuary anywhere in the world.\n\nSecondary impacts would amplify economic losses over time, including the compounding consequences of delayed technological improvements, foregone commercial and scientific breakthroughs, and the slowing/cessation of the myriad benefits brought by access to inexpensive and powerful computer processing capacity (Appendix 2). Slower economic growth and a decoupling of the semiconductor world into a “PRC bloc” and an “American bloc” would also reduce the size of markets accessible to chipmakers in either camp and risk creating long-term overcapacity in the system that could depress investment and hinder innovation.[119]\n\nControl of chip supplies would also become an enduring leverage point for the PRC, if it were it to successfully annex Taiwan. If Taiwan’s fabs remained intact and operational, the PRC would control virtually the entire world’s supply of the most advanced semiconductors. In this scenario, Beijing, whose explicit strategy is to acquire leverage over other nations through dominating high-tech supply chains, would impose adverse economic and trade realignments that would diminish American power and the industrial might of other industrialized democracies.[120] If, on the other hand, Taiwan’s fabs struggled to resume operations, the world would have to settle for significantly inferior older-generation chips — of which the PRC is on course to become the largest producer.\n\nWhile nearly any scenario would impact China’s economy, the PRC’s Marxist-Leninist rulers might well conclude that their nation’s economy could weather a chip supply disruption better than its techno-industrial competitors and ultimately emerge\n\nwith qualitative and quantitative dominance through cross-strait chip capabilities\n\nand capacity.\n\nAlternative Scenario: PRC Coercive Takeover of TSMC (Silicon Škoda Works)\n\nThere is an alternative scenario in which Beijing uses Taiwan’s microchip industry as its entry point for attempting a coercive annexation with the least escalation conceivable.[121] Consider, for instance, a PRC maritime and air quarantine of Taiwan, if Beijing could first achieve a period of ascendant pressure designed to cause Taipei and Washington to shrink from the challenge. If, somehow, PRC threat of massive kinetic force cowed Taiwan and undermined what would normally be presidential-congressional discussions and a serious response, under the auspices of the Taiwan Relations Act, Beijing might attempt to pursue a settlement that left the island nominally sovereign but ceded control of TSMC to PRC state-controlled entities. If this happened, the physical and human infrastructure of Taiwan’s chip industry would be unscathed. The strategic impacts would be far more severe than the historical analogue presented by Nazi Germany’s takeover of the Škoda Works arms factory complex in Czechoslovakia on the eve of World War II.[122]\n\nSuch a gambit could tempt Beijing with the prospect of a favorable risk/reward balance. For the United States, it would be one thing to respond militarily to fight off an attempted invasion of Taiwan by China, but quite another to initiate kinetic action against a blockade or related contingency imposed by Beijing. China’s proximity to Taiwan would also allow it to dial the intensity of a quarantine up or down and use various kinds of interference, ranging from Maritime Militia vessels up to PLA Navy warships. Commercial shippers (and especially, their insurers) detest uncertainty and generally avoid an area as soon as the first missile is fired — which is what happened during Beijing’s surrounding of Taiwan with military exercises in August 2022, after then-U.S. House Speaker Pelosi visited Taipei.[123] A protracted version of this dynamic has also been seen throughout Russia’s war on Ukraine.[124] Finally, the ambiguous character of intermittent or informal interruptions would complicate U.S. risk assessment, impose difficulties on decision-making, and thereby make direct intervention more challenging.\n\nSuch a gambit would be audacious and brazen, as revisionist campaigns sometimes are. Given the stakes and the risk, it is worth exploring both pathways to determine the consequences of success or failure. Appendix 3 offers details regarding how such a masterstroke attempt aimed at establishing silicon hegemony might fail, and — critically — how to deter or thwart such a disastrous PRC gambit in the first place.\n\nWhat if Beijing Succeeded?\n\nWhat would happen if Beijing somehow succeeded in conquest without triggering a U.S. military response? A “peaceful” acquisition of a controlling stake in TSMC in exchange for lifting a quarantine would potentially give China access to intact fabs and the critical know-how of the personnel that run them. Operation Paperclip, under which the United States brought more than 1,600 leading German rocket program personnel to America after World War II, offers an illustrative analogy for the value of leading-edge human capital infusions in apex technology competitions.\n\nWhile history typically rhymes rather than repeats, the results from combining cutting-edge German scientific expertise with substantial indigenous U.S. scientific capacity and massive financial support were phenomenal. Wernher von Braun and his team were instrumental in designing the Saturn 5 rocket that facilitated the manned moon landings in 1969–72, a feat that remains unsurpassed. The U.S. Army estimated that leveraging the experience and skills of the German scientists advanced U.S. rocket programs by 10 years and saved billions of dollars for investment elsewhere.[125]\n\nTechnological shifts of this magnitude are the type of once-in-every-few-decades events that in hindsight reveal themselves as tipping points in existential competitions between systems.[126] If Beijing succeeded in a TSMC takeover and then exercised its silicon power adroitly, the United States would likely find it hard to push back successfully. TSMC and its suppliers are currently responsive to significant U.S. techno-economic restrictions aimed at China.[127] After all, TSMC itself, as well as key suppliers including ARM (UK), ASML (the Netherlands), and Shin-Etsu (Japan), would almost certainly rather lose access to a large PRC market than appear in Washington’s crosshairs.[128] But if a U.S. administration were ever to lack the resolve to ensure free air and maritime passage to Taiwan (using force, if necessary), U.S. economic statecraft would prove far less credible, and these manufacturers’ attitudes might well change.\n\nUnder such “slippery slope” conditions, U.S. allies (as well as powerful constituencies within the United States) might prove unwilling to sever supplies and services to a now majority-PRC-owned TSMC and thereby launch what would, in practical terms, be an economic murder-suicide pact. And it would not just be a Washington-driven decision cycle — Beijing would almost certainly actively employ chip supplies as a carrot and stick to sow division within the “silicon allies” (chiefly the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands). Washington’s painstakingly crafted export controls would collapse. To paraphrase former National Security Council China Director Matt Turpin, China would not only be back in the technological “car” with the United States, but it would also arguably sit in the “driver’s seat.”[129]\n\nEven if the United States and its allies, such as the Netherlands and Japan, still maintained jurisdiction over the firms that provided microchip designs, lithography equipment, and the chemicals and components necessary for chipmaking, PRC control over production would be a strategic trump card. A standoff based on mutually assured economic destruction would ensue.\n\nXi and his advisors might plausibly conclude that the PRC could weather and leverage any Taiwanese production limitations better than China’s techno-industrial competitors, meaning Beijing would be positioned to use chip supplies as a manipulation tool. For instance, Beijing might continue chip sales to foreign firms but condition them on acceptance of PRC control of Taiwan. China might also impose export controls and reserve the most powerful chips for PRC firms, locking in structural competitive advantage. It could also predicate chip supplies on foreign firms’ willingness to share intellectual property (IP). Whether through these pathways or other permutations, the ultimate impact would be to empower accommodationist voices abroad and diminish American and allied industrial might.\n\nTSMC’s global economic importance and ability to affect business and consumer interests in the United States is at least several times greater than that of Russia’s oil sector — with TSMC’s 55% share of the global contract chip fabrication market handily exceeding Russia’s roughly 10% of global crude oil supply.[130] Losing the primary source of one of the world’s most core technologies would make the political blow of $5 or more per gallon of gasoline seem light. Gasoline consumption in the United States averaged just shy of 500 gallons per year per passenger car and truck in 2021.[131] Accordingly, a 50% price increase relative to the 2022 national average price of $4 per gallon would take $1,000 out of the average driver’s pocket over the course of a year.[132] While difficult to quantify precisely, a deep semiconductor shortage-induced recession would likely impact consumers far worse. China could also further manipulate the market environment by maintaining most chip sales even to U.S. entities. Such a “snowballing” effect could well stimulate accommodationist advocacy among key chip consumers and constituencies fearing economic fallout. It might even, over time, deter Washington from interdicting operations now controlled from, or at least substantially influenced by, Beijing.\n\nIf semiconductor buyers accepted the arrangement and locked in dependency on it (a pattern seen in many other commodity markets with exploitative suppliers, inelastic demand, and few or no substitutes), the technological competitive order would shift to the detriment of the United States and its allies, adversely affecting both their prosperity and security. TSMC would likely be prohibited from investing in advanced overseas facilities such as the plants it is currently building in Arizona, and “off island” facilities (even those serving export markets) would increasingly be located in the PRC. Beijing would have strong incentives to replicate its pattern of exploitation from the 1990s through the present, whereby foreign suppliers are strong-armed to set up shop in China and either “share” core IP or else have it pilfered.[133]\n\nChina already hosts the world’s premier electronics hardware manufacturing cluster, and using microchip production dominance to force design IP and supplier migration into a PRC-controlled (and likely, physically domiciled) ecosystem would make strategic sense as well as align with Beijing’s historical geoeconomic policy actions. Innovation often follows production activity, and just as PRC industrial policy warped value chains in metals, materials, and many manufactured goods over the past three decades, a similar process would likely unfold for semiconductors.[134] The end result would enhance China’s global techno-industrial position at America’s expense.\n\nIf PRC interests effectively controlled high-end chip output, China would be positioned to ensure that its cloud giants — Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent — could access the cutting-edge silicon that allied export controls now seek to deny. Preferential PRC access to Taiwanese semiconductors would also reinforce the competitive position of Beijing’s technological ecosystem, which in many ways is an IT parallel infrastructure with massive scale (mostly physically located in the PRC). If this ecosystem gained “right of first refusal” access to the world’s most modern semiconductors, PRC officials could potentially induce foreign technology firms to employ PRC-based data storage and AI processing services because the demands of commercial competitiveness they face would preclude them from being able to wait years for large-scale alternative leading-edge chip fabrication capacity to be constructed outside Taiwan. China’s commercial potential and espionage capacity through storing and handling data (“consensually,” in this case) would both be massively amplified.\n\nElbridge Colby underscores a related consequence if China were to seize Taiwan and thereby dominate the semiconductor industry: “To make it concrete: Many if not most Americans agree that there are huge problems with our social media companies and the way they are regulated today. But we are all assuming that Americans have the power to remedy the problem. … if Beijing is dominant over the world economy, that will not be the case. The social media companies will ultimately be answerable to Beijing, and the situation will be even worse.”[135] Far worse.\n\nPRC chip coercion would be especially destructive to the U.S. tech titans that are most directly exposed to a Taiwan-centric chip supply disruption. In 2019, OpenAI estimated global computing hardware spending to be at around $1 trillion annually, with U.S. firms accounting for an outsized portion of this figure (which is likely materially larger now) (Figure 10).[136] After decades of outsourcing chip production, TSMC is effectively “America’s fab” (Figure 11). In oil market terms, Taiwan is the “OPEC++” of semiconductor fabrication, accounting for more than 60% of global output, and the United States is the “OPEC++” of semiconductor intellectual property, design, and sales. Indeed, U.S. firms account for nearly 50% of global semiconductor sales. At this point, U.S. tech firms could perhaps reconstitute production capacity after many years of construction and workforce development and hundreds of billions of dollars in capital investments. By then, however, critical technologies and market dynamics would have moved along dramatically, further imperiling any such catch-up efforts.\n\nCompanies like AMD, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA have become instruments of American strategic economic power on a par with the large international oil companies that dominated the global market during their oil heyday between the late 1920s and late 1960s (Shell, Exxon, etc. — collectively called the “Seven Sisters”).[137] And just like the Seven Sisters, these companies depend on physical assets that could be harmed or seized by an adversary country. But microchips differ from oil in key respects that make semiconductor vulnerabilities worse than oil-driven ones.\n\nThe oil analogy is important on another level as well: understanding how efforts to diversify chip production may or may not alter the strategic picture. Recent legislation in the United States — the primary location for leading-edge or near-leading-edge chip production outside of Taiwan and South Korea — has helped unleash close to $200 billion in announced investments for expansion of existing plants and newbuild fabrication projects.[138] The plants cover a range of semiconductor classes, including analog chips (for Texas Instruments) and the advanced logic chips of which Taiwan is such a critical supplier (for TSMC, Intel, Samsung, etc.).\n\nExisting projects and actual construction activity suggest the bulk of the projects’ diversification impact will not occur until 2025 or later, well into the decade of maximum danger. Chipmakers are also likely chasing a moving target. Demand for advanced logic chips is expanding rapidly. ASML, the world’s leading manufacturer of advanced lithography machines, which are used to produce the world’s most advanced semiconductors, estimates an increase from 12 million wafer/starts annually in 2020 to more than 25 million in 2025 and over 38 million by 2030.[139] While such forecasts by nature require informed speculation and could be derailed by macro events of the very type this report addresses, industry views strongly suggest Taiwan’s semiconductor predominance, within the context of the island facing coercive annexation, will pose grave security liabilities for longer than presently expected.\n\nFigure 10 — US Firms Dominate Among Leading-Edge Semiconductor Purchasers\n\nand Users\n\nSource: ASML.[140]\n\nNote: Earnings before interest and taxation, billion U.S. dollars (USD) (2021).\n\nOil can be purchased from alternative producers, new fields can be brought online, and the heat energy derived from oil is often substitutable with other sources. Oil supply competitiveness is fundamentally based on cost of supply, with the lowest firms on the curve being the most competitive. Semiconductors differ markedly. They are not fungible, production is even more continuously capital-intensive than most oil and gas operations, and technological performance trumps cost of supply and differentiates products. The performance loss from lower-performance semiconductors creates significant and compounding consequences over time.[141]\n\nIndeed, even as TSMC begins to invest in more advanced facilities off-island, its industrial center of gravity is still clearly in Taiwan, where it has commenced commercial production of 3 nm logic chips and is preparing a six-phase plan for making 2 nm chips at its Hsinchu and Central Taiwan Science Park campuses.[142] TSMC’s capital investment plans provide additional empirical support for this view, with annual capital expenditure now exceeding $35 billion and only a fraction of those funds being deployed abroad.[143]\n\nFigure 11 — North American (Mostly US) Firms Are TSMC’s Core Customers\n\nSource: TSMC.[144]\n\nFigure 12 — TSMC Annual Capital Investment, Billion USD\n\nSource: Company reports.[145]\n\nTSMC demonstrates sensitivity to external concerns, as evidenced by its pending new Arizona fabs. But it also combines first-mover advantage and startup hunger in an extremely competitive global semiconductor marketplace. It has invested more than $160 billion in its operations and infrastructure over the past decade and, even with a weakening microchip market, is still poised to invest as much as $36 billion in 2023, much of it in Taiwan (Figure 12).[146]\n\nIf the global semiconductor market grows as projected, which would imply a 40% expansion in dollar terms by 2030, TSMC will almost certainly seek to capture incremental demand for the most leading-edge chips, which are both the highest margin and most capital intensive — and the hardest to make. Other firms are increasing their investments, but only TSMC can consistently invest nearly $40 billion annually in its current and future productive prospects while also being a true pure play foundry that does not compete with its customers because it builds semiconductors rather than designing them.\n\nThe coming five-to-eight-year period — in which TSMC will likely invest in the United States and other jurisdictions for primarily geopolitical reasons — is likely to see each unit of capacity abroad matched by continuing major developments back on-island.[147] The end result will be that absolute volumes of advanced chips produced outside Taiwan will increase, but as a proportion of global supply, the most sophisticated “bleeding-edge” production will substantially remain in Taiwan’s existing domestic chip clusters. Taiwan’s relative importance in the global semiconductor supply chain is thus likely to persist and could remain steadier than expected for the most advanced chips.\n\nThe closest analogy for U.S. policymakers may be Persian Gulf oil and the Carter Doctrine. In his 1980 State of the Union Address, President Jimmy Carter declared that the United States would defend its “vital interests” in the region, using military force if necessary.[148] A decade of turmoil, punctuated by the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo and 1979 Iranian Revolution, severely affected global energy security, and higher oil prices prompted a wave of investment aimed at diversifying global oil supplies. Production increased in Europe, Africa, and elsewhere. Nevertheless, the Gulf region’s bountiful oil reserves and low production costs allowed it to weather the volatility of a cyclical oil market and steadily regain market share beginning in the late 1980s. The trend continued until, by the late 2010s, the Persian Gulf region’s global share of oil production exceeded its pre-1970s level (Figure 13).\n\nEqually important, even though the United States managed to reduce its imports of Gulf oil over time as a proportion of total oil and energy use, the region remained a key strategic focus both because the United States remained tied into a global marketplace and also because its allies depended heavily on the region’s oil and would have been vulnerable to coercion had it fallen under Soviet control. These concerns drove the promulgation of the Carter Doctrine and also motivated the American-led coalition effort to eject Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait in 1991, lest he consolidate control over still greater reserves and production in the world’s most important oil supply region.[149] Thirty years later, U.S. strategic interest (backed by significant combat power) remains meaningfully oriented toward the region, with the 2022 National Security Strategy noting that American policies will prioritize actions to “bolster energy stability” there.[150]\n\nFigure 13 — Persian Gulf Oil’s Proportion of Global Supply\n\nSources: BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022; authors’ analysis.[151]\n\nGeology is much more deterministic than technology, as Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger pointed out in a 2021 speech, noting that “God decided where the oil reserves are, we get to decide where the fabs are.”[152] Nevertheless, an economy that has built the world’s premier semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem is unlikely to rapidly relinquish its central place in the global supply network. The same critical importance that registers as a “vulnerability” in external eyes transmutes into a “silicon shield” from the Taiwanese perspective — including at the highest levels of leadership.[153]\n\nKey dynamics and factors discussed in this section all point to a future in which Taiwanese-made semiconductors, like Gulf oil, will continue to occupy a central role in U.S. economic and national security policymaking, even if the United States itself incrementally increases its silicon self-reliance through some revitalization of domestic manufacturing. Further to the Gulf oil analogy, U.S. unconventional oil and gas producers have deployed more than $1 trillion in exploration and production capital (i.e., 20 times what the CHIPS Act commits) during the past decade alone.[154]\n\nYet while the United States is now the single-largest global hydrocarbons producer, the potential for events overseas to spike oil prices remains nearly as acute as when the Carter Doctrine was announced over 40 years ago. This raises a relevant, if sobering, historical comparison: Given that the United States has been motivated to take military action multiple times in the Middle East over oil-related concerns — including two major wars in the past 35 years — would it not also be willing to engage in intense deterrence and, as a last resort, warfare over semiconductor supplies on which its economy is even more proportionally dependent?\n\nMicrochips thus will be a key concern for U.S. policymakers, but far from the only one given the irreplaceable importance of a free and democratic Taiwan to the regional trade architecture and global geostrategic, geopolitical, and alliance structures — not to mention its role in containing nuclear proliferation risks. This paper will address each in turn.\n\nConsequence 2: Trade Exclusion and Economic Coercion\n\nOpen market access is an essential element of American power. Historian Nicholas Lambert notes that “The efficient functioning of the global trading system (and a high level of trade) was critical to the British Empire’s prosperity and strength” more than a century ago.[155] While crucially different in its domestic and international politics, in the present post-imperial era, the United States occupies an economic position that is analogous to the British Empire in its heyday. This helps explain why, despite periodic spasms of isolationism, U.S. strategy overall has recognized for decades that America’s prosperity is tied to free and open access to the world and robust flows of trade.[156]Accordingly, constrained access and exclusion of U.S. exports would be disproportionately harmful to America’s power and position over time. Exclusion from Asia would also cripple the United States’ future economic prospects. Curtailment of U.S. access to economic opportunities in Asia would be a very real possibility in the wake of the PRC’s coercive annexation of Taiwan.\n\nReduced U.S. trade flows with Asia in a post-Taiwan-invasion world order would be especially impactful, given the region’s current and future status as the largest, most dynamic global economic activity zone. Asia is uniquely positioned for such a contingency to occur, primarily due to China’s status as a near-peer competitor and an aggressive authoritarian power. Additionally, repercussions of this displacement would be most significant in the region. East Asia and the Pacific account for one-third of global GDP in purchasing power parity terms, a share that is by far the world’s largest and about twice that of the United States (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 14 — Global GDP by Macro-Region, Purchasing Power Parity, Trillions of Current International Dollars\n\nSources: World Bank; authors’ analysis.[157]\n\nSuccessful PRC coercive annexation of Taiwan would position Beijing to economically and militarily subjugate its regional neighbors, including some of the world’s most important economic and industrial powers and key U.S. treaty allies. PRC policymakers clearly view the world through a harsh hierarchical lens defined by counterparts’ size and power. Japan would have a hard time defending itself after the fall of Taiwan, but the situation facing the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations would be still worse. As MacArthur and Eisenhower warned, PRC control of even part of the First Island Chain (i.e., the islands and archipelagos extending from the Kuril Islands in the north, through Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and terminating in the South China Sea) would put Beijing in a position to complicate U.S. access to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean — regions constituting the coastline of the most populous and economically active part of the world. If the First Island Chain is like a belt constraining China’s increasing heft and pressure, then Taiwan is its buckle (or linchpin). If that already-strained “buckle” were to break, it would be devastating to the current rules-based order.\n\nThe United States’ own history shows how achieving regional preeminence facilitates global power projection. As Sean Mirski points out in his recent book “We May Dominate the World,” securing regional hegemony in the Western Hemisphere “freed the United States to leave the hemisphere behind and to become a global superpower.” But the United States was, in Mirski’s assessment, a superpower “invested in the security and stability of the world at large.”[158] We cannot know in advance precisely how the PRC might act as a global power freed from the constraints imposed by a robust American economic and military presence in Asia, but a multidecade pattern of action suggests it would take a far less benign approach.\n\nHegemony encompasses not only military dominance, but also economic prowess. Curtailment of U.S. access to economic opportunities in Asia would be an all-too-real prospect in the wake of a PRC annexation of Taiwan. The threat would require serious attention because free access to global trading opportunities is a foundational dimension of American prosperity and comprehensive national power.\n\nHistory shows a strong correlation between cementing hegemony and restricting rivals’ economic prospects. In a 2018 Foreign Affairs article considering what “Life in China’s Asia” might look like, Dartmouth scholar Jennifer Lind points out that “Great powers typically dominate their regions in their quest for security” and that as part of the venture, “They develop and wield tremendous economic power.”[159] East and Southeast Asia’s critical importance to global supply chains would reinforce Beijing’s incentives to do this. Even under a scenario of greater direct “decoupling” between the PRC and U.S. economies, regional countries would likely still host PRC-invested and influenced firms that would remain critical supply chain nodes for companies domiciled in the United States and allied countries.\n\nThe challenge would endure for at least three fundamental reasons. First, East Asia and the Indo-Pacific account for one-third of global GDP in purchasing power parity terms, a share roughly twice that of the United States. Second, the greater Indo-Pacific region represents the most significant global economic activity zone, including the high-growth potential subregion of ASEAN. Third, a hegemonic PRC’s intolerance of external rivals (among which the United States would be first) would probably drive economic and other coercion against Asian states that sought to continue robust trading and investment relationships with American entities.\n\nTo that point, recent PRC behavior in the region is already consistent with an apparent effort to economically displace the United States. While ASEAN states have for decades demonstrated they prefer making free economic choices, the actions described above suggest that under PRC hegemony, their economic sovereignty would be seriously compromised.\n\nAmerican policymakers have previously confronted the prospect of an adverse power controlling the world’s economic, industrial, and technological center of gravity. In 1939, as World War II overtook Europe, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt warned, “So soon as one nation dominates Europe, that nation will be able to turn to the world sphere.”[160]The threat that PRC hegemony over East Asia would pose today is arguably greater than that which our forebears faced regarding Europe nine decades ago and deserves commensurately proactive policy responses.\n\nThen-PRC Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi’s remark at the 2010 ASEAN Summit that “China is a big country and you are small countries and that is a fact” exemplifies Beijing’s very different, highly concerning approach.[161] Yang’s remarks set a tone that Beijing backed up with de facto annexation of territory in the South China Sea and a military buildup that has made the PLA far more formidable. Accordingly, without American power to offset it in Asia, China’s strategic position would risk leaving many regional states as quasi-vassals.[162]\n\nBeijing’s raw hierarchical view of the world and its regional actions in practice point to a stark reality: Punishment awaits those who attempt to defy it.
