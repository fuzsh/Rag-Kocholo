        "text": "Insect pressure has been extraordinarily heavy for Texas crops, according to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service pest management expert David Kerns, Ph.D., professor and associate department head for the Department of Entomology.\n\nHe said part of the increased pressure comes from unusual pests such as corn leafhoppers that Texas doesnt typically have in great numbers.\n\nKerns, who oversees the Texas Integrated Pest Management Program, IPM, has heard from IPM agents, AgriLife Extension specialists and agriculture and natural resources agents with similar pest pressure concerns. Collectively, they say this has been a bad year for pest pressure in grains across the state.\n\nKerns said with the warmer weather patterns weve been having, the increase in pests doesnt come as a surprise.\n\nCorn leafhopper concerns\n\nCorn leafhoppers, a pest originating in South America, arent normally a concern in Texas. Warmer temperatures, however, have helped expand the corn leafhoppers habitat range and this season they have moved much deeper into the state than before.\n\nIt was 2016 that we last saw these pests in large numbers in the lower Rio Grande Valley, but now they are back again and spreading, Kerns said. He said disease symptoms have been documented all the way up to San Angelo and into the Comanche area, where some good-sized populations have been seen.\n\nMost of the states corn was already at a point where the corn leafhoppers, which suck the nutrients from the plants and excrete honeydew, werent as much of a concern as the vectors they carry  diseases that can stunt growth, reduce yield and even kill the plant.\n\nAs far as disease goes, most of the corn that was affected was far enough along that you wouldnt think it would have a huge impact, he said. But theres a lot of anecdotal evidence out there that it very well could be having an impact. Not a devastating impact, but a definite impact.\n\nPlant pathologists are currently working to get a positive identification on samples taken from the states affected areas.\n\nIt could be a number of different diseases that this thing vectors and even the actual impact on the corn itself is debatable, Kerns said. If you look at some of these pathogens we know the insect can transmit, you know that the earlier the plant gets infected, the worse it is. In the long run, if it becomes a pest that sticks around or that we see earlier in the season, then the greater impact possibility.\n\nWhile the U.S. hasnt seen large losses to the pest, that cant be said for other places. In Argentina, once corn leafhoppers spread to what were previously cooler regions of the country, corn losses totaled over $1 billion. Brazil has also been in a fight against the pest as numbers grow across that country as well.\n\nKerns doesnt think Texans need to worry since conditions are very different between North America and South America, but the pest is one that needs to be closely watched and will continue to be monitored.\n\nGrazing grasshoppers\n\nGrasshoppers in greater numbers across a larger swath of the state than typical are causing issues for producers as well.\n\nThis year the western parts of the state seem to be getting it much worse than usual, Kerns said. Even up in the Texas Panhandle theyve been having issues with them.\n\nHe said weather plays the biggest role in grasshopper outbreaks since temperatures and moisture influence how many eggs are laid, when they hatch and how many survive.\n\nA free, downloadable guide available on AgriLife Learn identifies the main grasshoppers responsible for crop damage as well as suggested treatments.\n\nFalse chinch bugs and corn leaf aphids\n\nThere have been a lot of issues with false chinch bugs this year, Kerns said. And while this has mainly been seen in grains, it has also impacted some cotton.\n\nFalse chinch bugs are typically more of an issue for the eastern half of the state, and it isnt unusual to have problems with the pest even in the South Plains, but this year is different.\n\nIt started down in South Texas, but then followed all the way up, he said. I have heard of people having issues as far north as Oklahoma. So, it just seems to be a pretty widespread problem.\n\nAnd, he said, producers are still having a lot of issues with corn leaf aphids, which in and of itself isnt uncommon, but the numbers earlier in the season were really high, which is kind of unusual.\n\nFall armyworms, fleahoppers and cotton bollworms\n\nSome reports of fall armyworms have already come in and theres been incidences of pasture-to-pasture spread, Kerns said.\n\nWith the weather weve been having, you would expect that to continue and probably to amplify, he said. I wouldnt be surprised at all if we see a pretty good fall armyworm outbreak across the eastern half of Texas.\n\nCotton is also seeing more than its fair share of pest pressure.\n\nWe see cotton fleahoppers every year just about, but populations have been extraordinarily high this year, Kerns said."
