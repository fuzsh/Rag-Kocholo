Initially, its area of responsibility included Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Texas.\"[1] It was inactivated and its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the Albuquerque Air Defense Sector on 1 January 1960.\n\nReactivated on 1 April 1966, to perform Air Defense \"including all or part of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia\"[1] assuming responsibility for the missions of the Detroit and parts of the Syracuse Air Defense Sectors.\n\nAssumed additional designation of 34th NORAD Region after activation of the NORAD Combat Operations Center at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado and reporting was transferred to NORAD from ADC at Ent Air Force Base in April 1966. The division participated in numerous live and simulated exercises such as Fainting Echo, Apache Arrow, and Fainting Knife.[1]\n\nInactivated in December 1969[1] as ADC phased down its interceptor mission as the chances of a Soviet bomber attack on the United States seemed remote, its mission being consolidated into North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).\n\nLineage\n\nEstablished as the 34 Air Division (Defense) on 1 January 1951\n\nActivated on 5 January 1951\n\nInactivated on 1 February 1952\n\nOrganized on 1 February 1952\n\nInactivated on 1 January 1960\n\nRedesignated 34 Air Division and activated on 20 January 1966\n\nOrganized on 1 April 1966\n\nInactivated on 31 December 1969[1]\n\nAssignments\n\nWestern Air Defense Force, 5 January 1951 – 1 February 1952\n\nCentral Air Defense Force, 16 February 1953 – 1 January 1960\n\nAir Defense Command, 20 January 1966\n\nFirst Air Force, 1 April 1966 – 31 December 1969.\n\nStations\n\nKirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, 5 January 1951 – 1 January 1960\n\nCuster Air Force Station, Michigan, 1 April 1966 – 31 December 1969[1]\n\nComponents\n\nWing\n\n1st Fighter Wing (Air Defense)[1]\n\nSelfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, 1 April 1966 – 1 December 1969\n\nGroup\n\n343d Fighter Group (Air Defense)[1]\n\nDuluth MAP, Minnesota, 15 September-14 November 1969\n\nInterceptor squadrons\n\nMissile squadron\n\n35th Air Defense Missile Squadron (BOMARC)[1]\n\nNiagara Falls Air Force Missile Site, 15 September-19 November 1969\n\nRadar squadrons\n\nSee also\n\nList of United States Air Force Aerospace Defense Command Interceptor Squadrons\n\nList of United States Air Force air divisions\n\nUnited States general surveillance radar stations\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency"
