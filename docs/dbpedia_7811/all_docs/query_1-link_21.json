        "text": "The CNA Military Advisory Board has been instrumental in opening a public dialogue on climate change, energy security and their connections to national security. It introduced the idea of climate as a “threat multiplier,” impacting stability in the world’s fragile regions, and laid the foundation for the climate security field. Founded in 2006, CNA brought together retired admirals and generals from the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. Since then, the CNA Military Advisory Board has worked collaboratively with CNA research staff on projects that examine linkages between national security and changes in the environment, energy, water and food.\n\nThe CNA Military Advisory Board has had substantial influence on U.S. energy and national security policy. Its recommendations and findings have helped shape the U.S. National Security Strategy, National Intelligence Estimates, Quadrennial Defense Review and National Defense Authorization Act. The admirals and generals of the advisory board have briefed White House staff, including the National Security Council. They have testified before Senate committees and briefed scores of officials from the Departments of Defense, State, Transportation, Homeland Security and Energy. They frequently speak at conferences and provide TV and radio interviews on climate and energy security.\n\nGeneral Charles Wald, USAF, (Ret.)
