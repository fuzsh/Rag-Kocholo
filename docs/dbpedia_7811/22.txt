The 34th Air Division (34th AD) is an inactive United States Air Force organization. Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command, being stationed at Custer Air Force Station, Michigan. It was inactivated on 31 December 1969.

History[]

Assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC) for most of its existence, from January 1951 – until 1960 the 34th administered, trained, operated and supported assigned units, and placed all available combat capable elements in a maximum state of readiness. Initially, its area of responsibility included Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Texas. Redesignated Albuquerque Air Defense Sector on 1 January 1960.

Reactivated on 1 April 1966, to perform Air Defense including all or part of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia assuming responsibility for the missions of the Detroit and parts of the Syracuse Air Defense Sectors. Assumed additional designation of 34th NORAD Region after activation of the NORAD Combat Operations Center at Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado and reporting was transferred to NORAD from ADC at Ent AFB in April 1966. The division participated in numerous live and simulated exercises such as Fainting Echo, Apache Arrow, and Fainting Knife.

Inactivated in December 1969 as ADC phased down its interceptor mission as the chances of a Soviet bomber attack on the United States seemed remote, its mission being consolidated into North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).
