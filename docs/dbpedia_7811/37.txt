In late 2013, the Russian Frontal Aviation reverted to its pre-2009 regimental/divisional/Air Army set-up inherited from the Cold War-era. The Russian Air and Air Defence Commands (A&ADCs) will revert back to the four separate Air and Air Defence Armies that had existed until 2009. The 1st Air and Air Defence Command being transformed into the 6th Air Army, the 2nd as the 14th Air Army, the 3rd as the 11th Air Army and the 4th as the 4th Air Army

Another major change will see the merging of the Russian Air Force with the Space Forces, under one command, to be known as the Russian Air Force and Space Forces.

The 4th Air and Air Defence Army originally had one component division in 2009, established in 2013, but a second was established in mid-2014 as a direct consequence of Russias prompt annexation of Crimea Peninsula in March-April 2014.

The two-squadron 38th Fighter Aviation Regiment, stationed at Belbek in Crimea, and established in November 2014, is the latest Frontal Aviation fighter regiment. The 37th Composite Aviation regiment is the latest bomber-attack regiment in the Frontal Aviation structure, established at Gvardeyskoye airfield in mid-2014, also in Crimea.

The 999th Air Base was established in 2004 at Kant airfield at in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan. It expanded its fleet with five newly upgraded Su-25SMs in December 2014 complementing the existing fleet of the bases attack flight or squadron comprising four upgraded single-seat Frogfoots taken on strength in April 2014, together with one two-seater.
