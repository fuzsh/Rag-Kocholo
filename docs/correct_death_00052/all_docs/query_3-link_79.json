        "text": "He did stop loving her today.\n\nGeorge Jones, probably the best male voice in the history of country music, died Friday at the age of 81, and my heart is broken.\n\nHe'd suffered from a myriad of ailments, but his death in Nashville came after being hospitalized a little more than a week ago, suffering from fever and irregular blood pressure, according to his publicist.\n\nThat's two, now. Though Richie Havens and George Jones could not be more different, they were each the soul of a generation.\n\nI've spent part of today tearing up my basement, looking for a picture. You see, I moved from Parma to Garfield Heights a few years ago, and as happens in all moves, some things get misplaced. This particular thing is a personal treasure.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's a black-and-white picture of two babies, one slightly older than the other, but neither walking. The inscription on the back, written in the flowing turn-of-the-century penmanship of my grandparents, has only a year – 1932 – and two names. One is \"Charles Arnett\" – my dad, Charles A. Yarborough. The other, as you've probably guessed, is \"George Jones.\"\n\nNow I don't know for SURE that it's THE George Jones. But both were born in Texas, both lived in the Beaumont area about that time. There's no upturned nose on Jones that gave rise to his \"Possum\" nickname, and no red beer nose on my dad. Instead, there are the button noses of two cute little boys, dressed in the frilly finery of the day.\n\nAppropriately enough, given the histories of both men, I kept that picture on the wall in my basement bar, and would toast them with some frequency. The apple – or mason jar, whichever – doesn't fall to far from the tree in Texas.\n\nMy first influences in music were country. My mom used to sing with Jimmy Dean, after all, a long time before he made his first sausage. But I went through the usual rebellious period where, when asked to detail my favorite kind of music, the list began, \"Anything but country.\"\n\nGeorge Jones changed that.\n\nI did an email interview with Jones a couple of years ago and in it, asked if he had any regrets about his tumultuous life, which included divorce, arrests, drug addiction, alcoholism and a reputation for being so blotto that he wouldn't get to gigs – hence his other nickname, \"No-Show Jones.\"\n\n\"With age comes wisdom, and there are too many I would like to take back to mention,\" he wrote.\n\nSongs like \"White Lightning,\" \"The Race Is On,\" \"The Grand Tour,\" \"Tender Years,\" \"I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool,\" \"The Door,\" \"Golden Ring\" and especially \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" showcased a voice could either kiss or punch a note, whichever was more appropriate.\n\nA few years ago, I went through a stage where I'd spend every weekend camping. I had a boat that I kept on Berlin Reservoir, and I'd pack up my truck Thursday nights, then leave for the campground straight from work on Friday evenings.\n\nAs soon as the tent was up and the fire going, the first thing that came out was the CD player. Jones in his long career put out 60 studio albums, two live albums and six compilation albums. Clearly, there was a lot from which to choose.\n\nInevitably, the last one to go along with the last \"Pepsi\" – it's supposed to be a booze-free campground, so my beverages of choice ironically enough were always drunk from red Solo cups – was \"I Lived to Tell It All.\"\n\nThe 1996 album has some of my favorite Jones tracks – \"Billy B. Bad,\" \"It Ain't Gonna Worry My Mind,\" \"Tied to a Stone,\" \"I Must Have Done Something Bad\" and especially \"I'll Give You Something to Drink About.\"\n\nGeorge, you just did.\n\nOh, and one more thing: In that interview, I asked him if he ever experienced a Eureka moment, where he knew that making music was the right thing for him. His answer then touched me, and re-reading it today is helping ease a little of the pain of his passing:\n\n\"No, not really,\" Jones wrote. \"I just did what I love to do and hoped people would like it and, lucky for me, some did.\"\n\nAnd now, while it's time to put a wreath upon your door, rest assured, George, that we won't stop loving YOU today."
