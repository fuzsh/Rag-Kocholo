        "text": "GEORGE_JONES_BIRTHDAY_3547118.JPG\n\nCountry music legend George Jones waves to the crowd during his 75th birthday celebration at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tenn., on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2006. From left are Joe Diffie; Jones' wife, Nancy; Craig Morgan; Jones; Tanya Tucker; and Joe Nichols. George Jones died April 26 in Nashville. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)\n\nGeorge Jones was born in Texas and died in Nashville, but his career and life included tremendous ties to North Alabama.\n\nDuring the late-70s, Jones lived in the Muscle Shoals neighborhood Jackson Heights. He cut tracks at many of the recording studios in the Shoals area, including FAME, Music Mill, East Avalon, Broadway Sound and Widget. Nashville producer Billy Sherrill - producer of some of Jones' biggest hits including \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\"â€“ got his start as one of FAME's co-founders. Jones' one-time wife, country star Tammy Wynette had grown up on a Mississippi farm that was near (and by some accounts overlapped) the Alabama border near Red Bay.\n\nTerry Pace is a Muscle Shoals music historian, co-author of producer Rick Hall's autobiography \"Hellbent for Fame\" and University of North Alabama English professor.\n\n\"And another deep connection George Jones has here is a songwriter who lives here named Earl 'Peanutt' Montgomery,\" Pace says. \"And that's Peanutt with two Ts. He wrote over 70 songs that were recorded by George Jones. They had a real up-and-down relationship over the years. In fact, after Peanutt became a minister, he wrote a song called 'Living for Jesus and Praying for Jones,' which was a 'I hope George gets his act together and is able to make it.'\"\n\nUp-and-down, indeed. Montgomery, who penned Jones-sung tunes including \"We're Gonna Hold On,\" reportedly once narrowly missed being popped with a bullet from Jones' .38 revolver.\n\nJones died on April 26 after being hospitalized April 18 for fever and irregular blood pressure. His bouts with alcohol and cocaine abuse are well-documented. As is his use of a riding lawnmower as a method of transportation, and Pace actually was a first-hand witness to the latter bit of popular music lore.\n\n\"My best friend lived in Jackson Heights, and George lived maybe three or four blocks away, and it was not an uncommon sight to see George out on the riding lawnmower and stopping to talk to people, and just out riding around,\" Pace says. \"I never saw him out on the main streets.\"\n\nHe did however see Jones play local gigs at venues including the supper club Mr. C's.\n\n\"He was kind of an outcast from Nashville establishment at that time,\" Pace says. \"Much like Johnny Cash, he was kind of an insider-outsider.\"\n\nPace spent about 25 years as a reporter at the Times-Daily. Mobile Press-Register dining/social event reporter David Holloway also worked at that Florence paper, in the mid-80s, when Jones was notorious for not showing up to his own concerts, thus earning the moniker \"No Show Jones.\"\n\n\"So when he scheduled a concert in Florence,\" Holloway says via e-mail, \"I jumped at the chance to cover the program. Part of me wanted him to show because I was a huge fan of his catalog; my favorite song of his was (and still is) 'Bartender's Blues.' But another larger part of me was hoping that he would stiff the crowd and not show up. That was the reporter in me coming out since it would make for a better story.\n\n\"I was prepared to write a story about how throngs of angry fans stormed the stage to demand their money back, but that simply didn't happen. Most of them filed out of the auditorium with little fanfare, happy to be a small part of the growing George Jones legacy. They, and I, could tell people they were in the audience when George Jones didn't show up.\"\n\nIf Jones would have died in the '80s or '90s, it's likely the no show aspect would receive much more weight in the singer's legacy and media coverage of his passing. But George Jones outlived No Show Jones.\n\n\"He just outgrew it,\" Pace says."
