        "text": "Salem Poor was born probably circa 1742. All known accounts agree that he was purchased as an infant at the slave market in Salem (MA) by Lydia Abbot, a young woman, and brought home to Andover by horseback on the bow of her saddle.I He was baptized in what is now North Andover (MA) in 1747.II\n\nOn 10 July 1769, upon the payment of £27 in purchase of his own freedom, he was issued an official manumission by his master John Poor 3rd.III Five years later, in the warrant for the Andover town meeting of 17 March 1774, an article ‘for the provision of support for [his] wife and children … returned a negative vote.’IV\n\nThere is no known record of his enlistment in the eight months’ service, yet he was clearly present at the Battle of Bunker Hill as is proven by a petition citing his bravery.V In 1880, respected historian Sarah Loring Bailey of Andover described the local tradition associated with Salem Poor’s heroic service [see cautionary footnote]:\n\nThe story goes that “Salem Poor,” a slave, owned by Mr. John Poor, shot Lieutenant-colonel [James] Abercrombie. As that officer sprang on the redoubt, while our men were in retreat, and exclaimed, “The day is ours,” Salem turned and took aim and fired. He saw the officer fall.VI\n\nHis name is listed on a 6 October 1775 company return and on a 13 December 1775 ‘order for bounty coat or its equivalent in money dated Boston.’VII\n\nAs the American attack on Canada crumbled, the call went out for reinforcements for the Northern Department. He responded by enlisting on 14 May 1776 in Capt. Abram Tyler’s company, in Col. Edmund Phinney’s regiment of Maine militia. This unit served at Fort George, at the southern terminus of Lake George, during the time of the defeat of the American fleet on Lake Champlain under Gen. Benedict Arnold. His name appears on an 8 December 1776 muster roll ‘dated Garrison at Fort George.’VIII On 25 October 1777 he was allowed payment for 1776 incidentals to service, which consisted of thirty miles travel to headquarters at Cambridge and six days billeting.IX\n\nUpon his return home in early 1777, he rejoined the local militia in Capt. Samuel Johnson’s 1st Andover company. With Gen. Burgoyne preparing to advance on northern New York, the call once again went out for soldiers to meet this serious threat. He joined the Continental Army on 11 May 1777 for a three-year term in the company of Capt. Nathaniel Alexander, in Col. Edward Wigglesworth’s Massachusetts regiment. This unit served at Saratoga. Upon the surrender of Burgoyne, the regiment marched to winter quarters at Valley Forge. His name appears on a May 1778 muster roll ‘dated ‘Camp Valley Forge.’ During June 1778 he was stationed at ‘Camp near White Plains.’ By October 1778 command of the regiment had been taken over by Maj. John Porter and in March and April 1779 the regiment was stationed at Providence. He was discharged 20 March 1780.X\n\nHis name does not appear in the 1790 U.S. Census and, despite the efforts of numbers of serious researchers, neither the date nor the place of his death have ever been found.\n\nIn commemoration of the Bicentennial in 1975, the U.S. Post Office issued a 10 cent stamp in his honor.XI In January 2001, the National Park Service issued a site bulletin celebrating his life and his services to his country.XII\n\nSalem Poor married Nancy Parker, a ‘mulatto free woman’ and former servant of Capt. James Parker, in Andover on 4 November 1771.XIII They had at least one child:\n\nJonas: bpt. 29 September 1776 in [North] AndoverXIV\n\nFootnotes:\n\nLovejoy, Clarence Earle. The Lovejoy Genealogy … (1930), 74 gives the most detailed account: “There is a tradition that Lydia Abbot [b. 1723], when a girl, went to Salem, Mass with her father one day and when passing the slave market bought a negro infant and brought it home on her saddle. She gave it to her dau., Chloe [b. 1753], and the child was called Salem Pony.”\n\nLovejoy, Clarence Earle. The Lovejoy Genealogy … (1930), 75 states that Chloe Lovejoy, who owned Salem, married John Poor in 1776.\n\nAbbott, Charlotte Helen. Early records and Notes of Andover [MA] Families, Lovejoy, 21 confirms this but states that the child was brought home “in [Lydia’s] saddle bag.”\n\nAbbott, Charlotte Helen. Andover [MA] Families Notes. Manuscript at Andover (MA) Historical Society, 424 repeats the story.\n\nAbbott, Charlotte Helen. Andover [MA] Families Notes. Manuscript at Andover (MA) Historical Society, 90-105 states that Salem was part of Chloe’s dowry. This does not reconcile with Chloe’s 1776 marriage date to John Poor, at which time Salem would have been free for seven years. It is more probable that Salem was part of Lydia Abbot’s dowry. This source also states that “One of the grandmothers brought the infant up from Salem on her saddle as she returned from a visit ‘to see the ships come in’ as a lass. The choice of 1742 as a birth year for Salem would correspond with an age of 19 for Lydia Abbot.\n\nVital Records to 1850. Births, Marriages and Deaths.

Historical Sketches of Andover, … Massachusetts (1880), 323-4. This version must be accepted with great caution. Very similar actions are attributed to Peter Salem (see his sketch for more details), with the British officer in his case being Major John Pitcairn. Salem Poor’s bravery in the redoubt is unquestioned; however, whether he indeed shot Lt. Col. Abercrombie could not be proven or disproven in the course of this study.\n\nSecretary of Commonwealth.
