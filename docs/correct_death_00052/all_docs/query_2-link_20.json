        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nGeorge Jones was a force to be reckoned with in country music during his lifetime and is still an inspiration to so many today. His country style influenced some of the biggest stars in country music, including Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, and Trisha Yearwood. When he died in 2013, fans were understandably devastatedâ€”he was even still tour up until he was hospitalized a week before his death.\n\nJones had rocky relationships with the women in his life and struggled with substances like drugs and alcohol. He even earned the nickname \"no show Jones\" due to missing so many of his own shows because of his drinking. He married his last wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and she was determined to save him from himself.\n\nNancy stayed with Jones from that time until his death, though she didn't succeed in convincing him to give up drinking until 1999. As Jones lied in his hospital bed at Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville, TN, Nancy felt proud of the way Jones had finally turned his life around, living a sober life and finally keeping all of his commitments. \"God put me with him to help him get the devil out of him,\" Nancy told The Tennessean, \"God put me there to do a job and I did it.\"\n\nJones's last words before dying served as confirmation for Nancy that she had succeeded and George would go to heaven. \"We were standing at the foot of the bed and George just hasn't said nothing, and all of a sudden, he opened his eyes, and I was fixin' to go toward him, and the doctor kind of held me back,\" Nancy said.\n\nShe recounts his final words as: \"Well hello there. I've been looking for you. My name's George Jones.\"\n\n\"He was talking to God. I know in my heart he was talking to God and he has gone to heaven,\" Nancy continued. Immediately after saying these words George Jones passed away on April 26, 2013.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
