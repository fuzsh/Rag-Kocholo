        "text": "Birth Records\n\nBack to Top | Ordering Info | Birth Records | Death Records | Marriage Records | Divorce Records\n\nTennessee began keeping birth records statewide in 1908. The larger cities in Tennessee did keep earlier birth records: Nashville (beginning in 1881); Knoxville (beginning in 1881); Chattanooga (beginning in 1879); and Memphis (beginning in 1874). Only the early Nashville birth records are indexed.\n\nTennessee delayed birth records 1869-1909 are available online thru a partnership with Ancestry.com on at Ancestry.com's Tennessee State Library and Archives web page. Tennesseans: learn more about how to access these records for free.\n\nBirth Certificates 1924 - present\n\nContact the Tennessee Department of Health, Office of Vital Records\n\n1908 - 1912 and 1914 to 1923\n\nThe Tennessee State Library and Archives has statewide birth records for the years 1908-1912 and 1914-1923. To find a birth record, we need the following information: name of child, date of birth or approximate date of birth, county of birth (if known) and names of parents (if known).\n\nDelayed Birth Certificates 1869 - 1923\n\nThese delayed certificates were filed at the request of the individual or that person's representative for legal reasons. To locate a delayed birth certificate, we need the following information: name of child, date of birth or approximate date of birth, county of birth (if known) and names of parents (if known). Visit the Ask Us a Question! web page to contact the Library and Archives and we can check our index to the \"delayed\" birth records for a specified name. Please specify that you are requesting a \"delayed\" birth certificate. The Library and Archives will respond to e-mail requests promptly; response time may vary, depending on the amount of research required to answer your question and the unique nature of your request. If you need immediate assistance you may call the reference desk at (615) 741-2764 or visit us in person.\n\nMemphis Birth Records\n\nThe Library and Archives has copies of the city birth records for Memphis for 1874-1883; early Memphis birth records for 1884-1917 are held by the Shelby County Archives.\n\nAn online index to Shelby County birth records for the years 1874-1916 is available on the web site of the Shelby County Register of Deeds.\n\nNashville Birth Records\n\nThe Metro Archives of Nashville and Davidson County has posted an online index to Nashville city birth records for 1881 - 1913.\n\nDeath Records\n\nBack to Top | Ordering Info | Birth Records | Death Records | Marriage Records | Divorce Records\n\nThe state of Tennessee did not require the keeping of death records until 1908. This law expired at the end of 1912. In 1913, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a new law that called for the keeping of more detailed death certificates. This law went into effect in 1914.\n\nWhen the first law expired at the end of 1912, however, no individuals or agencies were charged with the responsibility of keeping death records. For this reason, 1913 is frequently referred to as a \"dead year\" for death certificates in Tennessee.\n\nThe larger cities in Tennessee did keep earlier death records: Nashville (beginning in 1874); Knoxville (beginning in 1881); Chattanooga (beginning in 1872); and Memphis (beginning in 1848). Only the early Nashville and Memphis death records are indexed. The Library and Archives can search the unindexed records for one year only; you must provide us with the name of individual, date of death, the city, and the name of the spouse (if known).\n\nTennessee death records 1908-1965 are available online thru a partnership with Ancestry.com on at Ancestry.com's Tennessee State Library and Archives web page. Tennesseans: learn more about how to access these records for free.\n\nDeath Records 1974 - present\n\nContact the Tennessee Department of Health, Office of Vital Records\n\nDeath Records 1908-1912 and 1914-1973\n\nTo find a death record, we need the following information: name of individual, date of death (or three year range to search), county of death (if known) and name of spouse (if known). Please keep in mind that some deaths were not recorded, due to poor record-keeping by local officials. TSLA has searchable indexes for these records that includes the name of the deceased, county, year of death and certificate number. The following indexes can be used to order a copy of the death certificate from the Tennessee State Library and Archives. A sample death certificate is available for viewing on our web site.\n\nIndex to Tennessee Death Records 1908 - 1912 - This index covers nearly 98,000 deaths occurring in Tennessee and recorded between 1908 and 1912. Although deaths were not registered as carefully and regularly as they were beginning in 1914, the index includes all extant records. If no year of death was given on the certificate, it is noted in this index as \"1908-12\". Children with no given name are listed under \"infant\".\n\nDeath records in this time period do not give parents' names. They do include the individual's age, occupation, place of birth and cause of death. Names have been transcribed as found on the original record, and may include spelling errors. There may also have been typographical errors made in preparing this index. If you see an error of this type, please notify us by email.\n\nIndex to Tennessee Death Records (1914-1933) - This index lists name of deceased, county of death, and volume and page number of the certificate; beginning with death certificates issued in 1926, the certificate number is listed instead of the volume and page. (The index replaced the Partial Index to Tennessee Death Records 1914-1925, which covered only 38 counties in Tennessee and did not include children under two years of age.)\n\nWhen using this index, please keep the following in mind:\n\nCheck for alternate spellings of the surname. Handwriting is not always legible and could be misread. Spelling variations are common. A surname such as Hale might be spelled Hale, Hayle or Hail; a surname such as Dickson might be spelled Dickson, Dixon, or Dixson.\n\nCheck for alternate spellings of the first name. The name William A. Smith may be listed as Smith, William or Smith, Will or Smith, Wm. or Smith, Bill or Smith, W. or Smith, W.A. The first name may have an abbreviation that is not in current usage, such as Jas. for the name James.\n\nSome records did not include the given name of the deceased. These records are listed at the beginning of each surname, such as Williams, (blank) or King, (unknown) .\n\nMany death records for young children did not list a first name for the child. These listings appear in the index as Smith, Infant of or Jones, Infant of John. There are also listings for older children, such as White, Son of John or Case, Child of Henry.\n\nDeath certificates for some married women are listed under the name of the husband, such as Adams, James (Mrs) .\n\nTitles relating to occupation will be listed after the first name of the individual: Johnson, Martin (Rev.) or Hibbert, John (Dr.) or Blake, Charles (Maj.).\n\nIf the individual died out of state, there will not be a death certificate issued in Tennessee, even if the body was returned here for burial.\n\nDeath certificates during this time period were filled out by funeral directors. If the deceased was buried in a family cemetery and no funeral home was involved, there will not be a death certificate on file in Tennessee.\n\nThere are some death records for individuals who could not be identified (\"unknown white male, in late 40s\"). These are not included in this index.\n\nDavidson County Death Records 1900 - 1913\n\nA searchable index to the Davidson County Death Records 1900 - 1913 is available on the Genealogy Index Search Site. Davidson County (as distinct from Nashville) began keeping their own death records in 1900 and continued to do so through 1913. The death records in this index include the following information: last name, first name, race, date of death, age, place of burial, and the volume & record number.\n\nPlease note that many of the recorded names in this index do not appear in the Index to Tennessee Death Records 1908-1912.\n\nShelby County Death Records\n\nAn online index to Shelby County death records for the years 1848-1966 and a state-wide index to Tennessee death records for the years 1949-2014 is available on the web site of the Shelby County Register of Deeds.\n\nMarriage Records\n\nBack to Top | Ordering Info | Birth Records | Death Records | Marriage Records | Divorce Records\n\nTennessee counties were not required to record marriages in bound record books until 1838. While not required to do so, many counties in Tennessee did record their early marriages. The early marriages were recorded in ledgers by the County Court Clerk. The clerk usually recorded only the names of the bride and groom, the minister or justice of the peace and (sometimes) the bondsman.\n\nPLEASE NOTE : Marriage records in Tennessee have changed during its statehood. In many cases, the marriage license itself was given to the bride and groom. The official marriage record on file in the state will be an entry made into a marriage ledger book by the County Court Clerk. Generally, the clerk recorded only the names of the bride & groom, the minister or justice of the peace, and (sometimes) the bondsman. A limited number of counties began issuing duplicate marriage licenses in the 1880s. The information on marriage records can vary county by county. Some counties began listing the names of the parents of the bride & groom in the 1880s; some counties did not include this information until the mid 1920s. When you request a search for a marriage record from the Library and Archives, we will check to see if there is a marriage license on file. If there is no license on file, then we will send the entry from the county's marriage ledger book.\n\nTennessee Marriage Records 1974 - Present\n\nFor marriage records from 1973 to the present, contact the Tennessee Department of Health, Office of Vital Records.\n\nTennessee Marriage Records July 1, 1945 - December 31, 1973\n\nFor the dates July 1, 1945 - December 31, 1973, there is a year-by-year statewide microfilm index to Tennessee marriage records.

The search request requires the name of the groom and the date of the marriage (or we will search the five year range 1945-1973); the name of the bride & the county of marriage are not required, but should be included if known.\n\nTennessee Marriage Records 1861 - June 30, 1945\n\nMarriages 1861 - June 30, 1945 can be found in the records of each county. There is no state-wide index to marriages during this time period. We can search the microfilmed county records for a marriage record if given the names of the groom and bride, county of marriage, and the date of the marriage or a 5-year date span. If the marriage occurred in one of the four metropolitan counties (Davidson County, Hamilton County, Knox County and Shelby County), then a 3-year date span must be specified. PLEASE NOTE that the Tennessee State Library and Archives does NOT have Davidson County marriage records for May 1941 - June 1945. These records are available through the Metropolitan Archives of Nashville and Davidson County.\n\nTennessee Marriage Records 1780-1861\n\nA list of extant (in existence) marriage records in Tennessee for the years 1780-1861 has been published.
