        "text": "Texas-bred country musician George Jones—known for his tender voice and catchy songwriting—died today at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, after he was hospitalized with a high fever and irregular blood pressure, the New York Times reports. He was 81.\n\nA legendary musician in his genre, Jones set himself apart from figures like Johnny Cash and Hank Williams with his widely imitated emotional singing style, a skill that aided both his cheerful honky-tonk tunes like “White Lightning” and his heartbreaking soliloquies like “Tennessee Whiskey.”\n\nJones’s first hit, “Why Baby Why,” launched him to country superstardom in 1955, but like many of his peers, Jones struggled with an addiction to alcohol and drugs. He was married four times and nicknamed No-Show Jones for the performances he missed. He sobered up in 1983, with the help of his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulveda. George Jones was photographed by Annie Liebovitz for *Vanity Fair'*s Music issue in November 2002, while working on a gospel album, Kickin’ Out the Footlights … Again, with Merle Haggard. Four years later he posed for Mark Seliger alongside country singer Lee Ann Womack.\n\nHis experiences were inspiration for his music. His 1980 single “He Stopped Loving Her Today” was named the song of the year by the Country Music Association, and went on to win a Grammy for best male country performance. “Choices,” a song he released in 1999, won him a Grammy for best male country vocals. And in 2012, he was awarded a lifetime-achievement Grammy award.\n\nBelow, a video of Jones in 1965, performing “White Lightning” live in New York. (Note his fearlessly gaudy attire!)\n\nPolitics\n\nWhat Biden Can Learn From LBJ’s Decision to Drop Out in 1968\n\nA struggling president with a strong policy record, deep legislative experience, and fresh memories of being underestimated by the younger man he served as VP, LBJ faced, with his fiercely loyal first lady, the question of whether to drop out of contention ahead of the Democratic convention in Chicago. A presidential historian explains how the events of 1968 can, and can’t, help us make sense of our chaotic present.\n\nAward Season\n\nIn Conclave, the Pope Dies—Then the Twisty Search for His Successor Begins\n\nRalph Fiennes top lines the new film from the director of All Quiet on the Western Front, a thriller about both a personal and a collective crisis of faith—backed by a brilliant ensemble including Isabella Rossellini, Stanley Tucci, and more.\n\nCelebrity\n\nTravis Kelce Was Stressed About Whether to “Curtsy” When Taylor Swift Introduced Him to Prince William\n\nBut William isn’t the royal he came away calling “a superstar.”\n\nHollywood\n\nHere: Robert Zemeckis’s New Movie Spans a Century, but the Camera Never Moves\n\nTom Hanks and Robin Wright reunite the Forrest Gump team for a drama set entirely in one household’s living room."
