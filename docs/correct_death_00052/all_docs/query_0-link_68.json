        "text": "I just finished doing my son-in-law's tree (By \"finished\" I mean \"going as far back as I could, then forward for all the descendants I could, until I decided finding BMD dates and places for a 4C2R wasn't really worth the effort\") and thought I'd share some of my findings. Amplifications and corrections warmly welcomed.\n\nNote 1, my genealogy program's report writer has a bug, so the source citations don't format properly. \"John Smith1-8\" should be \"John Smith (1-8)\" or \"John Smith 1-8\" with the \"1-8\" in superscript.\n\nNote 2, I marked everyone born after 1913 \"Living\" even though some are not.\n\nNote 3, the prose style is VERY mechanical.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1.Wiley Roberts1,2 was born in 1804/5 in North Carolina.He appeared in the census in 1850 in Robertson County, Tennessee.He appeared in the census in 1860 in Robertson County, Tennessee.He died between 1861 and 1870 in Robertson County, Tennessee (prob).\n\nThis is the only clue that I have that Wiley and Elizabeth were Mary Ann's parents; the fact she and EW were living with them in 1850. Wiley and Elizabeth could be aunt and uncle, or some other relative; or, given how common a surname \"Roberts\" is, not related..\n\n1850, District 3, Robertson, Tennessee\n\nRoberts, Wiley, 45, NC\n\nRoberts, Elizabeth, 45, Va\n\nRoberts, John A, 24, Tenn\n\nRoberts, Jacksa, 16, Tenn\n\nRoberts, Sophronia, 12, Tenn\n\nRoberts, Luellan, 8, Tenn\n\nRoberts, Nancy, 5, Tenn\n\nWillis, E W, 23, Tenn\n\nWillis, Rebecker, 21, Tenn\n\n1860, Western Division, Robertson, Tennessee\n\nRoberts, Willim [Willie], 55, NC\n\nRoberts, E, 56, Va\n\nRoberts, J, 24, Tenn, male [Jacksa in 1850 ??]\n\nRoberts, M E, 18, Tenn, fem [Luellan in 1850 ??]\n\nRoberts, W, 14, Tenn, fem [Nancy in 1850 ??]\n\nElizabeth is the head of household in 1870. I'm assuming Wiley died.\n\nWiley Roberts and Elizabeth Williams were married between 1820 and 1824.Elizabeth Williams1-4 was born in 1804/5 in Virginia.She appeared in the census in 1850 in Robertson County, Tennessee.She appeared in the census in 1860 in Robertson County, Tennessee.She appeared in the census in 1870 in Robertson County, Tennessee.\n\nMaiden name from daughter Lucy Ellen's death certificate.\n\n1870, District 3, Robertson, Tennessee\n\nRoberts, Elizabeth, 66, Va\n\nRoberts, Sam R, 34, Tenn\n\nCampbell, N W, 24, Tenn\n\nCampbell, M J, 3, Tenn\n\nRoberts, Bettie, 28, Black, Tenn, dom. Serv\n\nRoberts, Washingon, 8, Black, Tenn\n\nRoberts, Robert, 4/12, Black, Tenn\n\nI threw in the blacks because in the 1860 slave schecules, \"Willie\" Roberts of Western Division, Robertson, Tennessee, has a 22-year old male slave and a 17-year old female one. I'd bet even monry that Bettie there is a freed slave who took her former owner's surname, and was the 17-year old in 1860.Wiley Roberts and Elizabeth Williams had the following children:\n\n+2 i. John A Roberts, born in 1825/26, Tennessee; married Sarah M Ivey, on 1 Dec 1852, Logan County, Kentucky; died on 14 Mar 1881, Robertson County, Tennessee.\n\n+3 ii.

Jackson Roberts1 was born between 1833 and 1836 in Tennessee.He appeared in the census in 1850 in Robertson County, Tennessee.He appeared in the census in 1860 in Robertson County, Tennessee.\n\nJackson was probably born in Robertson County. He is 16 in 1850, for a birth year of 1833/34. He is 24 in 1860, for a birth year of 1835/36.\n\nI can't find him after 1860.\n\n5 iv. Samuel R Roberts4 was born in 1835/36 in Robertson County, Tennessee.He appeared in the census in 1870 in Robertson County, Tennessee.\n\nSamuel isn't there in 1850 or 1860, unless he is Jackson. He's marked \"insane\", which may just mean retarded. I can't find him after 1870.\n\n+6 v. Sophronia Roberts, born in 1837/38, Tennessee; married Clayborne Jamison, on 1 Jan 1856, Robertson County, Tennessee; died after 1909, Tennessee (prob).\n\n+7 vi.
