-The best description I could tell you of George is he was real.\n\nHe was honest.\n\nHe owned his negative stuff.\n\nHe owned his bad behavior.\n\nHe never made no bones about it.\n\nHe was who he was.\n\n-The way I've lived my life is probably not that different from the way that George lived his life, and I'm pretty lucky to be here.\n\nI think the important thing to remember is that he set an example of how to come through it, how to beat those things.\n\nAnd, you know, he's my inspiration.\n\n-I think George is a tale of two guys, right?\n\nWhich I think we all are.\n\nAnd I think there was an era of George that was this kind of wild behind-the-scenes character that you just heard the legends of, and then you hear the stories of the redeemed man later.\n\nSo I always connected with that story deep in my soul.\n\n-Can I just tell you that there is not a soul on that stage tonight that hasn't had those peaks and valleys.\n\nYou know, we've all been down in the dumps.\n\nWe've all been broke.\n\nWe've all been messed up.\n\nIt's part of what makes the music come out of us.\n\n-Country music is real people, real stories about the real situation, and that is about as real as it gets.\n\nThe man had highs and lows in a way that, you know, we can all relate to.\n\nBut what we do best is, we sing through it.\n\nWe sing through the storm.\n\n-George and I -- we were bad boys, yes, but, boy, were we good.\n\n[ Laughs ] Were we good.\n\nWe were great.\n\nHi to everybody out there.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ Shh.\n\nListen to me, now.\n\n-♪ I'm just a singer ♪ ♪ A

mean, I just remember thinking, \"How does he do that?\n\nHow does he do what he does with his voice?\"\n\nHe's just a damn good singer.\n\n-George -- George was not just a honky-tonk singer.\n\nGeorge was a stylist.\n\nGeorge had an amazing range that superseded just about everybody else in the business.\n\nYou go back and listen to some of those things when he was in his prime, whoo, Lord, have mercy.\n\n-All those licks and all those movements that George did that came just so effortlessly to him.\n\nTo the rest of us, it's hard.\n\n-I'll tell you what George Jones was born and blessed with is a God-given talent.\n\nThat was his assignment in life.\n\nGod gave him that talent, and all he had to do was open his mouth and do his style of any song handed to him.\n\n-He's in the same class as the Ray Charleses and the Billy Eckstines and the Sinatras.\n\nHe's all of that.\n\nHe was a rare commodity.\n\nHe really was.\n\nHe's real spec-- He was real special.\n\n-From the '60s -- '50s and '60s, right up until the end, and he was always great.\n\nI listen to those old records from back in the day, and I -- Whew!\n\nThe guy -- He was just -- He didn't -- He hit the mark every time.\n\nEvery time.\n\nI don't think there's a greater singer anywhere.\n\n-♪ Step right up, come on in ♪ ♪ If you'd like to take the grand tour ♪ ♪ Of a lonely house that once was home sweet

ever be.\n\n-These guys like George Jones, these pioneers, and, you know, they're just kind of woven into the fabric of America and Americana.\n\nAnd it's kind of bigger than country music.\n\nAnd their voices are the kind of soundtrack of America in some ways.\n\nAnd I just feel so lucky to have had a chance to record some music with George in the studio and spend a little bit of time with him early in my career.\n\nI actually found those pictures not too long ago, and I was like, \"Man, how lucky am I to get a chance to spend time with George Jones in a studio, cutting a song, you know, with the greatest of all time?\"\n\n-I got to open shows for George when I had -- I was on my second single, you know?\n\nAnd I got to go out at the end of his show and do \"Rockin' Chair\" with him, you know?\n\nAnd he didn't have to do that.\n\nAnd it was -- You know, and for a young guy that was just -- you know, just starting out, that was huge.\n\n-I saw George open up and embrace all of us and have another full-blown career on the back side of it, and he was really the only one that did that.\n\nIt made me realize that that's the way that I need to be treating this next generation coming along behind me, too, because George got it.\n\nAnd maybe it was some guilt and remorse of things that had happened along the way that he just felt like he needed to be more gracious to all of us, but he genuinely was.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ ♪♪ -♪ Miracles appear in the strangest of places ♪ ♪ Fancy me finding you here ♪ -♪ The last time I saw you ♪ ♪ Was just out of Houston ♪ ♪ Let

all of the things that George went through, I don't think he thought anybody ever loved him.\n\nAnd when he found love, I don't think he knew what to do with it.\n\nSo I was teaching George how to
