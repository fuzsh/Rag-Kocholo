Learn about our location and programs, find answers to common questions and connect with your counselor.\n\nInternational Student Resources\n\nMy most valuable experience [at WVU] would be the relationships I’ve been able to make within the Davis College. I certainly don’t know everyone, but at the same time, I feel as if there aren’t any strangers here. It was the kindred spirit of Davis that convinced me to go on a study abroad trip to Belize with 13 other Davis students, not knowing a single one of them. I came out of it with the most incredible memories and friendships.\n\nJillian Blair\n\n2024 Environmental and Energy Resources Management graduate from Wheeling, WV"
