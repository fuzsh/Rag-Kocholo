        "text": "George Jones, a plaintive country singer who won praise outside his genre and was dubbed \"The Possum,\" died at the age of 81 in Nashville following a hospitalization for fever and irregular blood pressure, the Associated Press reported.\n\nTributes have begun pouring in for the man that Frank Sinatra once famously said was the \"the second greatest singer in America,\" but who also had his share of personal troubles. He missed shows and battled with drug addiction. Jon Pareles of the New York Times wrote:\n\nAt the Houston Chronicle Andrew Dansby wrote:\n\nYou can watch a 1980 live performance of that song here:\n\nJones, who long struggled with alcohol, had a tumultuous relationship with wife and duet partner Tammy Wynette. They divorced in 1975, but still sang together."
