        "text": "NASHVILLE — Outside Woodlawn-Roesch-Patton Funeral Home Wednesday evening, people talked of George Jones as country music's most emotionally eloquent ballad singer. They spoke of Jones' legend, of his soulfulness and of music that will endure beyond the grave.\n\nInside, away from camera crews and satellite trucks, they spoke more softly.\n\nOutside, they celebrated George Jones' life's work.\n\nInside, they mourned George Glenn Jones' life, which ended at age 81, on April 26.\n\nInside, they missed a friend. And a father, and a husband.\n\nThursday morning will bring a public, televised memorial service for George Jones, with music and testimonials befitting an icon. Wednesday was a private visitation, with friends and family — some famed, some anonymous — who laughed gently, or mumbled comfort or choked tears.\n\nI attended the visitation as a journalist, but also as a friendly acquaintance and as a member of the Nashville music community that is lessened by the loss of George Jones.\n\nI won't disrespect a few private hours in a very public death by penning a blow-by-blow of who was there, what they wore and how they acted. And yet over the next few days, people will ask what it was like in there. And I will tell them, and I'll tell you:\n\nIt was just like the visitation held for country music hero Johnny Cash, just like the one for Kitty Wells, and just like the one for Earl Scruggs.\n\nJust like the one for my granddad, who was famous only to his friends.\n\nYou've been to these things before. This one was more crowded — with many guests waiting in a two-plus hour line before greeting the family — but otherwise no different. Visitations are gatherings of people who feel sad and powerless in the wake of death. They are for people who sometimes hug each other without smiling.\n\nThey are for coping, not for cheering. And no amount of media hubbub outside the building makes the inside of the building any more or less agonizing than the similar scenes that take place every day, all over our world, in buildings similar and dissimilar. Celebrity has zero to do with tragedy, other than to give it a megaphone.\n\nAnd I'm not suggesting that the death of an 81-year-old man qualifies as tragedy. Certainly, if you'd told Jones at age 50 that he'd live to see 81, he'd have assumed you to be in comic error.\n\nJones' longevity had a lot to do with the woman at the end of the two-hour line, Nancy Jones, his wife of 30 years who saw past her husband's sins and substances and determined that there was something worth saving in there beyond his honeyed, whiskeyed voice.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a job that paid less by the hour than the job of keeping George Jones straight in, say, 1983, but she worked that job tirelessly and, ultimately, effectively. Her work paid off for us, too: We all got three more decades with George Jones the singing star, and with a kinder, more community-minded version of a man who was once a holy terror.\n\nI never knew the howling, outlandish Jones of the 1970s and '80s. I knew a nice old man who was playful around children. I knew a man who worried about the present and future of the country music industry he'd helped to build, who watched NFL football every autumn Sunday and who delighted in the Christmas lights displayed at the entrance to his and Nancy's Franklin, Tenn., estate. Folks who came to see the lights often made donations to help the less fortunate, and Jones had been less fortunate himself, long ago. He never saw Christmas lights like that, growing up in Vidor, Texas.\n\nI knew a man who clung to his wife like she was his lifeline, mostly because she was his lifeline.\n\nThe legendary George Jones, the \"King of Broken Hearts,\" abides. We can listen to him every day, for the rest of our own lives.\n\nBut George Glenn Jones, the buddy and daddy, the guy with the great laugh and the ability to talk just like Donald Duck ... he's gone now. And hundreds of his friends stood in line on Wednesday evening for a long time, to tell his wife they were sad about that."
