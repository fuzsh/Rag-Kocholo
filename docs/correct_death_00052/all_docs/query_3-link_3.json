        "text": "Johnny Cash\n\nCountry Singer, Musician, Actor, Entertainer. Legendary Country Music Singer and songwriter who was known as “The Man in Black” for his trademark wearing of all black clothing. Contrary to his songs and image, he never spent time in prison (except to visit). Most remembered for the songs “Ring of Fire,” “Folsom Prison Blues,” “A Boy Named Sue,” and “I walk the Line.” Born in Kingsland, Arkansas, one of seven children, in 1951, he enlisted into the United States Air Force, was stationed in Germany, and was honorably discharged in 1954. He began his singing career in 1955, with the hit single “Hey, Porter” for Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee while working for radio station KWEM. In 1958, he changed to Columbia Records. In the mid-1960s, he became addicted to drugs, but with the help of singer June Carter of the legendary Carter Country Music Family, he was able to break the addiction, although he had relapses several times, including going through rehab at the Betty Ford Center in 1984. He was married twice, first to Vivian Liberto (1954 to 1966, divorced), with whom he had four daughters, then to June Carter (1968 to her death in May 2003), with whom he had a son, John. In 1961, he began to appear in movies, starting with “Door to Door Maniac” and also appeared in television, beginning in 1958, and made numerous guest appearances on various television shows. He was inducted into the Songwriters, the Country Music and the Rock and Roll Halls of Fame, the first to be inducted into all three Halls of Fame. He died about four months after the death of his wife, June.\n\nBio by: Kit and Morgan Benson\n\nGrave Location\n\nJune Carter Cash\n\nCountry Singer, producer, author, actress. Born in Maces Springs, Virginia, on June 23, 1929, as Valerie June Carter, she was a member of the famous singing Carter Family. The Carter Family began recording country music in 1927 and continued until Maybelle’s death in 1978. The Carter Family Singers included members like ‘Mother’ Maybelle Carter, Anita Carter, and Alvin Pleasant ‘A.P.’ Carter, and of course June who would go onto a successful singing career herself. In the 1950s she moved to New York to study acting at the request of Elia Kazan who discovered her while scouting movie locations in Tennessee. Also about this time she attended the premiere of “A Streetcar Named Desire” in the company of Elvis Presley, and sat with Elia Kazan and Tennessee Williams. In 1961 she turned down an offer to work on a variety show that had Woody Allen as one of the writers, but instead agreed to tour with the Man In Black, Johnny Cash, for $500 a week. On March 1, 1968, she married Johnny Cash, after he proposed on stage during a concert in London, Ontario, and remained married to him for 35 years until her death. She was previously married to country singer Carl Smith, who gave her a daughter, country singer Carlene Carter. In 1963 with Merle Kilgore, she co-wrote Johnny Cash’s hit song “Ring Of Fire.” A talented singer, songwriter, and musician, she recorded hits with her husband like “Jackson” and “If I Were A Carpenter” which both won Grammy Awards in 1967 and 1970. In 1972 they recorded duets like “It Ain’t Me Babe” in 1964, and “If I Had A Hammer” in 1972. In 1979 she wrote her autobiography, “Among My Klediments” and released her memoir, “From The Heart” in 1987. In his 1997 autobiography, Johnny Cash described how his wife stuck with him through his years and abuse. In 1999 she released the album, “Press On” which followed in her musical autobiography, which told of her 31 year marriage and collaboration with Cash, which later won a Grammy, and was her first release in over a quarter-century. Also an actress she appeared in the films and television specials, “All My Friends Are Cowboys” (1998), “The Apostle” (1997), “Stagecoach” (1986), “The Last Days Of Frank And Jesse James” (1986), “The Baron And The Kid” (1984), “Murder In Coweta County” (1983), “Johnny Cash: Cowboy Heroes” (1982), “Johnny Cash: Christmas In Scotland” (1981), “The Unbroken Circle: A Tribute To ‘Mother’ Maybelle Carter” (1979), “Thaddeus Rose And Eddie” (1978), “The Gospel Road” (1973), and “The Country Music Holiday” (1958).

Her husband and family were at her side.\n\nBio by: Peterborough K\n\nGrave Location\n\nGeorge Jones\n\nCountry Music Singer and Songwriter. He is probably best remembered for his hit single “He Stopped Loving Her Today” and for his tumultuous marriage to famed country singer Tammy Wynette. Additionally, his musical career would be marked by frequent bouts of alcoholism and cocaine use and his wild lifestyle led to him missing many of his performances and earning the dubious nickname “No Show Jones.” Also nicknamed “The Possum,” supposedly for his facial resemblance to the animal, he was raised in poverty in Vidor, Texas with his brother and five sisters by an alcoholic and sometimes violent father. At the age of seven his parents bought a radio and he heard country music for the first time. When he was nine years old, he received his first guitar and soon started playing for money on the streets and clubs of Beaumont, Texas. He left home at the age of 16 and went to Jasper, Texas where he performed on a local radio station. He married Dorothy Bonvillion in 1950 at the age of 19 but they divorced within a year and he enlisted in the US Marine Corps, spending his entire military time in California. After his military service he returned to Texas and was discovered by Starday Records co-owner Pappy Daily, who guided his early career. He remarried in 1954 to Shirley Ann Corely and recorded his first single, “No Money’s in This Deal,” but it failed to chart. The following year his single “Why, Baby, Why” became a hit and he moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1959 and recorded his first number 1 hit “White Lightning.” For the next two years he continued to record number 1 singles, with “Tender Years” (1961) and “She Thinks I Still Care” (1962). His next number 1 hit would not come for another five years, with “Walk Through This World With Me’ (1967). In 1968 he divorced his second wife and married country singer Tammy Wynette the following year, with whom he had a daughter, creating a “country couple” that would record a sequence of albums and singles topping the charts throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Their marriage was stormy at best due largely to his alcoholism and they divorced in March 1975 but continued to work together professionally through 1980. From 1973 to 1983 he racked up number 1 singles with “We’re Gonna Hold On” (1973, with Tammy Wynette), “The Grand Tour” (1974), “The Door” (1975), “Golden Ring” (1976, with Tammy Wynette), “Near You” (1977, with Tammy Wynette), “He Stopped Loving Her Today” (1980), “I Was Country When Country Wasn’t Cool” (1981, with Barbara Mandrell), “Still Doin’ Time” (1981), “Yesterday’s Wine” (1982, with Merle Haggard), and “I Always Get Lucky with You” (1983). In March 1983 he married his fourth and final wife, Nancy Sepulvado, who became his manager and is credited with rescuing him from alcohol and drug abuse. He continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s despite no longer being a significant presence on modern country radio. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992 and in June 1997 he released his autobiography “I Lived to Tell It All.” He was named a Kennedy Center Honoree in 2008 and in 2012 he was presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was a member of Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry from 1956 until his death. He died at the age of 81 after being admitted to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center for a fever and irregular blood pressure.\n\nBio by: William Bjornstad\n\nGrave Locations\n\nTammy Wynette\n\nCountry Music Singer. She was often referred to as the “First Lady of Country Music” and is best remembered for her song “Stand by Your Man,” one of the best-selling singles by a woman in the country music industry. She, along with Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton, set the standards for the role of women in country music during the 1970s. Her marriage in 1969 to famed country singer George Jones created a “country couple” and they would record a sequence of albums and singles that topped the charts throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s. She was born Virginia Wynette Pugh near Tremont, in Itawambia County, Mississippi, the only child of parents who were farmers and her father was also a local musician. When she was only nine months old her father died from a brain tumor and she was left in the care of her parents when her mother moved to Memphis, Tennessee to work in a defense plant during World War II. She grew up with her aunt, who was only five years older, and taught herself to play a variety of musical instruments that were left by her deceased father. She attended Tremont High School where she was an all-star basketball player. A month before her graduation she married her first husband, Euple Byrd, who was a construction worker and had difficulty keeping a job, which caused them to move frequently. She worked a variety of jobs and in 1963 she attended beauty school in Tupelo, Mississippi and obtained a cosmetology license, that she would continue to renew every year for the remainder of her life. She left her first husband, who did not support her dream of becoming a country singer, prior to the birth of their third daughter. To help support her family, she tried to earn extra money by performing at night and in 1965 she appeared on the “Country Boy Eddie Show” on WBRC-TV in Birmingham, Alabama which led to performances with famed country singer Porter Wagoner. A year later she moved with her daughters to Nashville, Tennessee to seek a recording contract. After being rejected by several record companies she auditioned for record producer Billy Sherrill, who was originally reluctant to sign her but was in need of a singer for “Apartment No. 9” and upon hearing her sing it, he signed her up to Epic Records in 1966. At Sherrill’s suggestion she changed her first name to Tammy and used her middle name as her last, and became Tammy Wynette. “Apartment No. 9” became her first single released in December 1966 and it peaked at number 44 on the Country charts. Her next single, “Your Good Girl’s Gonna Go Bad,” became a big hit, peaking at number 3. It would launch a string of Top Ten hits that would go into the 1970s, that included “My Elusive Dreams” (1967, her first number one hit, a duet with David Houston), “I Don’t Wanna Play House’ (which won a Grammy award in 1967 for Beat Female Country Vocal Performer), “Take Me to Your World” (1968), “D-I V-O-R-C-E” (1968), “Stand by Your Man” (1968, for which she won the 1969 Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance), “Singing My Song” (1969), and “The Ways to Love a Man” (1969). She would earn a Gold record in 1970 for her album “Tammy’s Greatest Hits” which would later be awarded Platinum record status. During the early 1970s she and country singer Loretta Lynn dominated the country charts and became one of the most successful female vocalists in country music. Her number one singles continued with “Loves Me All the Way” (1970), “Run Woman, Run” (1970), “”The Wonders You Perform” (1970), “Good Lovin’ (Makes it Right)” (1971). “Bedtime Story” (1971), “My Man (Understands)” (1972), “‘Till I Get it Right” (1972), and “Kids Say the Darndest Things” (1973). In 1969 she married country singer George Jones, with whom she had a daughter, and recorded duets with him that became Top Ten hits, including “The Ceremony” (1972), “We’re Gonna Hold On” (1973), and “Golden Ring” (1975). Their marriage was stormy at best due largely to his alcoholism and they divorced in 1975 but continued to work together professionally through 1980. She would win the Country Music Association Awards’ Female Vocalist of the Year” in 1968 through 1970 and held the record for the most consecutive wins for this category until 1987, when famed singer Reba McEntire won it for the fourth consecutive time. In 1976 she recorded the single “”Til I Can Make It on My Own,” which reached number 1 on the Country charts and number 84 on the Pop charts, becoming her first single in eight years to enter the Pop charts. That same year she had another single, You and Me,” to reach number 1 and it became her last number 1 hit as a solo artist. Her last number 1 hit came as a duet with George Jones in 1977 titled “Near You.” Following 1976 her popularity waned slightly but she continued to record Top 10 hits with “Let’s Get Together (One Last Time)” (1977), “One of a Kind” (1977), “Womanhood” (1978), “No One Else in this World” (1979) and “They Call It Makin’ Love” (1979). In 1980 her chart success began to falter although her hits reached in the Top 20s like “Starting Over” (1980), “He Was There (When I Needed You)” (1980), the Everly Brothers’ hit “Crying in the Rain” (1981), “Another Chance” (1982), “You Still Get to Me in My Dreams” (1982), and “A Good Night’s Love” (1983). Her duet with Mark Grey of Dan Hill’s “Sometimes When We Touch” reached number 6 on the country charts in 1985. In 1981 a television movie was her life aired called “Stand By Your Man,” based on her memoir of the same title. During this time she encountered medical problems, including inflammation of her bile duct. In 1986 she had a part on the CBS television soap opera “Capitol” as beautician/singer Darlene Stankowski and in 1987 she recorded an album “Higher Ground” that featured contributions from notable country artists Ricky Van Shelton, Vince Gill, Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Rickey Skaggs, and The O’Kanes which received some commercial success. Two singles, “Your Love,” and “Talkin’ to Myself Again” released from the album reached the Top 20 on the Country charts and a third single “Beneath a Painter Sky,” a duet with Emmylou Harris, reached number 25 in early 1988, which would be her final Top 40 country single. In 1988 she was forced to file for bankruptcy due to her bad investments in two Florida shopping centers. She would record four additional albums, “Heart Over Mind” (1990), “Honky Tonk Angels” (1993) “Within Walls” (1994), and “Girl Thang” (1994) but neither would result in any singles being released. During this time she also designed and sold her own line of jewelry. In 1995 she and George Jones recorded a duet album “One” which produced a single by the same name. Afterwards, she collaborated with the Beach Boys for their 1996 comeback album “Stars and Stripes Vol. 1” in which she sang a duet of the tune “In My Room” with Brian Wilson. She became the voice for the character Tilly Hill in the animated television series “King of the Hill” until her death. As a result of her numerous health ailments and surgeries she was dependent on painkillers as early as 1973 and became critically ill with a liver infection at the end of 1993. In 1994 she nearly died as a result of an abdominal infection and was constantly in and out of hospitals for treatment of various ailments. She would undergo 26 major surgeries during her lifetime, some of which were serious. In spite of her health issues, she still managed to pursue her singing career and regularly tour to promote her work. She died at her home in Nashville, Tennessee from a blood clot in her lung at the age of 55. In 1998, following her death, she was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame. During her lifetime she was married five times, the last being to her manager, singer/songwriter George Richey for 20 years until her death. A year after her death her daughters filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her doctor and husband, claiming they were responsible for her death, and body was exhumed in an attempt to determine how she really died. After a new autopsy was conducted, the coroner ruled that she died of a cardiac arrhythmia. In 2002 she was ranked number 2 on CMT’s 40 Greatest Women of Country Music (Patsy Cline was ranked number 1), and in 2003 a survey of country music writers, producers, and stars listed “Stand By Your Man” as the top country song of all time. In 2011 her original recording of “Stand By Your Man” was selected by the US Library of Congress to be preserved as one of that year’s 25 recordings chosen for their cultural significance.\n\nBio by: William Bjornstad\n\nGrave Location Cross Mausoleum 3rd floor, left hall\n\nBob Montgomery\n\nMUSIC ICON, SONG WRITER AND PRODUCER DIES\n\nHe was a native Texan, born in the Lampasas area of Texas. He started his music career in Lubbock, Texas, with Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame member Buddy Holly as a duet. They became the “Buddy & Bob” act on a local radio station from 1949 to 1955. Stardom was born for both of them. They were privileged to be the opening act for Elvis Presley when he performed in Lubbock early in his career. Bob eventually became one of the icons of country music production. He subsequently wrote or co-wrote such 1950s Holly hits as “Heartbeat,” “Love’s Made a Fool of You” and “Wishing.” Over 60 years in the business, he made major contributions as a songwriter, record producer, music publisher and label executive. Famous songs that he can be credited with includes such standards as “Misty Blue” and “Love’s Made a Fool of You.” Vern Gosdin, Janie Fricke, Bobby Goldsboro and Joe Diffie were stars for whom he produced records. He published such iconic songs as “Behind Closed Doors” and “The Wind Beneath My Wings.” He created hit-making rosters for the record labels United Artists, Epic and Columbia. He got work as a recording engineer in the Clovis, NM studio of producer Norman Petty, working with such artists as Holly, The Crickets, Waylon Jennings, Jimmy Gilmer and The Fireballs, Buddy Knox and Roy Orbison. He enjoyed playing rhythm guitar for many of the recordings which were made at the Petty Studios. In 1959, he moved to Nashville, TN, and became a staff songwriter at Acuff-Rose Publishing. As in every place he had worked before, he was very successful with Acuff-Rose and those who reaped from those successes included Sue Thompson’s 1962 pop hit “Two of a Kind,” as well as songs for The Everly Brothers, Jim Reeves and Bob Luman. He formed Talmont Music as his own publishing company in 1963. Patsy Cline sang the original recording of another of his big hits, “Back in Baby’s Arms.” The song was a huge success, so much so, that others who subsequently made the song big on the country hit parade included Connie Smith, Sissy Spacek, Emmylou Harris and many others. “Misty Blue” was another gold song in his repertoire. This Montgomery song has been a hit for Wilma Burgess (1966), Eddy Arnold (1967), Joe Simon (1972), Dorothy Moore (1976) and Billie Jo Spears (1976) and has been recorded by hundreds more. In 1967, he sold Talmont then became the head of the United Artists Records country division. As in all his previous endeavors, he set country music on fire as a record producer by producing hits for the label’s Del Reeves (1969’s “Good Time Charlie’s”), Johnny Darrell (1968’s “With Pen in Hand”) and Buddy Knox (1968’s “Gypsy Man”), among others. He had one United Artists star who stood tall above all others, Bobby Goldsboro, for whom he produced the massive 1968 pop and country gold mine hit “Honey,” as well as “Watching Scotty Grow,” “The Straight Life,” “Summer (The First Time)” and Goldsboro’s other hits of that era. In late 1969, he had another hugely successful business when he and Bobby Goldsboro formed the publishing company House of Gold. In only five years, it was one of the top song firms on Music Row. They employed staff writers who would become future Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame members: Kenny O’Dell and Larry Henley, plus Steve Pippin, Danny Morrison, Sam Lorber, Bobby Springfield and Van Stephenson. Other big time hit records he produced were “Behind Closed Doors” (Charlie Rich) and “The Wind Beneath My Wings” (Gary Morris, Bette Midler), and the company’s hits included John Conlee’s “Rose Colored Glasses,” Tammy Wynette’s “Til I Get it Right,” Alabama’s “Love in the First Degree,” The Oak Ridge Boys’ “Bobbie Sue” and Tanya Tucker’s “Lizzie and the Rainman.” Others who enjoyed super hits with House of Gold songs included Bobby Bare, Brenda Lee, Cristy Lane, Crystal Gayle, Dave & Sugar, Eddy Arnold, and Jack Greene. He was not yet finished with the smash hits that he produced at the House of Gold. Singer-songwriter Razzy Bailey had a long string of hit singles that the House of Gold produced. Montgomery crossed over into the field of pop with songs recorded by Exile, Dr. Hook, Gladys Knight, Lobo, Millie Jackson, Player, Sister Sledge, Sheena Easton, The Pointer Sisters,and many others. The 1970s was a decade of great success as the House of Gold was ranked second to Tree International as the most successful independent publisher in Nashville. In 1982, Warner Brothers Music bought the company for several million dollars. Montgomery moved to Tree as its Director of Creative Services. Continuing on with his golden ways, Sony bought Tree in 1988, and he became a vice president at CBS Records. As with all his previous companies, he signed more stars who included Joe Diffie, Doug Stone and Collin Raye to the company’s imprints, Columbia and Epic. He was the quintessential record producer with the golden touch. His name is on 1980s hits by B.J. Thomas, Waylon Jennings, Shelby Lynne and Merle Haggard, among others. “Rocky” by Austin Roberts (1975), “It Ain’t Easy Bein’ Easy” by Janie Fricke (1982), “Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox” by Joe Diffie (1993) and “Some Memories Just Won’t Die” by Marty Robbins (1982). His name is also on such hit performances as Vern Gosdin’s 1988 and 1989 “Chiseled in Stone,” “Set ‘Em Up Joe” and “Who You Gonna Blame it on This Time.” In 1992, he and his wife established yet another publishing company, Noosa Heads Music. This company was the successful producer of songs including the Tim McGraw hits “Down on the Farm” (1994) and “Maybe We Should Just Sleep on It” (1996). 2005 found the Montgomery’s moving to Australia where they lived for seven years. They returned to Nashville in 2013. He had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease and died quietly at home around 1:30 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, December 4th. He is survived by his wife and business partner two daughter, and one son. Woodlawn Funeral Home on Thompson Lane in Nashville handled arrangement for the final rites which were held at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, December 9, 2014.\n\nSource of information: LifeNotes\n\nGrave Location\n\nVan Stephenson\n\nCountry Singer, Songwriter. He was a member of the popular Country musical group, ‘Blackhawk’ from 1992 to 2000. A native of Hamilton, Ohio, Stephenson moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of ten, where he got involved playing in local garage bands. A graduate of a seminary school, he pursued his musical interests more seriously, and he began to write songs, while working as a staff writer. In 1979, country singer Crystal Gayle recorded one of his songs, ‘Your Kisses Will.’ The song landed on the Top Ten on the Country Charts. Following the success of ‘Your Kisses Will’, Stephenson began writing songs for other musicians including Janie Fricke, Dan Seals, John Anderson, and Kenny Rogers. He also collaborated with Dave Robbins (a future Blackhawk member), on several recordings for Country band ‘Restless Heart’ including, ‘Big Dreams In A Small Town,’ ‘Bluest Eyes In Texas,’ and ‘Til I Loved You.’ By 1984, Stephenson had signed an artist deal with music producer Richard Landis, and was recording on the MCA Record Label. That same year his album, “Righteous Anger” (with Restless Heart), was released. The album was a success in sales, and partly to the singles, ‘Modern Day Delilah,’ and ‘What The Big Girls Do.’ In 1986, Stephenson released his second album, “Suspicious Heart”, but the album was not a great success, although the single, ‘Were Doing Alright,’ did get some air play. Over the next few years Stephenson continued to write songs and record. In 1992, he formed the group ‘Blackhawk’ with keyboard player and vocalist Dave Robbins, and lead vocalist and mandolin player Henry Paul. The band signed a contract with the Arista Record Label, and by 1993, the group had there first single with, ‘Goodbye Says It All.’ The single went to #1 on the music charts. The band’s success continued over the next couple of years with more successes including, ‘Every Once In Awhile,”I Can Sure Smell The Rain,’ and ‘Wherever You Go.’ All three songs were on the music charts in the #2, #9, and #10 spots. The band’s debut album, “Strong Enough” also went platinum. In late 1995, the band released it’s second album, and again several hit recordings, ‘King Of The World,’ ‘I’m Not Strong Enough To Say No,’ ‘Like There Ain’t No Yesterday,’ and ‘Almost A Memory Now.’ In 1997, the band released there third album, “Love & Gravity”, and in 1998, there fourth album, “The Sky’s The Limit.” In 2000, they also released there greatest hits album, “Blackhawk: Greatest Hits.” In 2000, Stephenson unfortunately had to leave the band, due to skin cancer that he was suffering from. He was replaced in the group by Anthony Crawford. On April 8, Van Stephenson sadly passed away in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 47. He was buried in the same mausoleum as country singer Tammy Wynette at the Woodlawn Memorial Park in Nashville, Tennessee. Other recordings by ‘Blackhawk’ include, ‘Let ‘Em Whirl,’ ‘Down In Flames,’ ‘Stone By Stone,’ ‘Bad Love Gone Good,’ ‘Cast Iron Heart,’ and ‘Ships Of Heaven.’\n\nBio by: Peterborough K\n\nGrave Location Cross Mausoleum 3rd floor, left hall, 8th left\n\nBilly Byrd\n\nCountry Musician. He was one of the first country musicians to make a name for himself with the electric guitar. Born William Lewis Byrd in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of ten he displayed an impressive level of skill and technique on the guitar, and his parents hoped he would pursue a career in classical music. He began performing with his older brother James, and made his radio debut on WLAC in Nashville in 1935. When he was 18, he was hired as a backup musician on the Grand Ole Opry, and began working that same year with the Tennessee Valley Boys, and later with various dance bands in the Nashville area. During World War II he enlisted in the US Navy and served as a cook on a destroyer escort. After the war, he resumed his music career in Nashville, initially as a member of Wally Fowler & His Georgia Clodhoppers, where he remained until 1948. That year he went to Louisiana, joining the Louisiana Hayride and playing with Curly Williams & the Georgia Peach Pickers. In 1949 he joined Ernest Tubb’s Texas Troubadours, succeeding Tommy “Butterball” Page as lead guitarist on the single “Tennessee Border No. 2.” As a member of the Texas Troubadours he became a star, with Tubb mentioning him by name ahead of each solo, and his solos were among the prettiest, most fluid, and memorable in country music. He appeared on hundreds of songs, among them “Two Glasses Joe,” “Jealous Loving Heart,” “Answer the Phone,” and “Letters Have No Arms,” from 1949 until 1959, and was also prominently featured as part of Tubb’s appearances on the Grand Ole Opry and other television shows. His playing made the electric guitar a popular instrument among country audiences, and in 1950 he collaborated with Hank Garland in the design of the ‘Byrdland’ guitar for Gibson Guitar. He was also a well-known sessions musician with other well-known artists, including Tex Ritter, Webb Pierce, Burl Ives, Cowboy Copas, Ferlin Husky, Marty Robbins, Little Jimmy Dickens, George Morgan, Eddy Arnold, Johnny Horton, Leon Russell, and the Oak Ridge Quartet, and shuttled between Tubb’s and Red Foley’s bands. In addition to the electric guitar, he was also renowned for his skill on the mandolin, the banjo, and the bass. In 1959 he left the Texas Troubadours to pursue a solo recording career with the newly formed Warner Brothers label and recording three albums, “I Love a Guitar” (1960), “Lonesome Country Songs” (1962), and “The Golden Guitar of Billy Byrd” (1964). In 1964 he moved to California to join fiddle player Gordon Terry. He later moved back to Nashville to continue as a sessions musician, and was also featured throughout the early and mid-’60s as a guitarist on the local morning television program “The Eddie Hill Show.” At the end of the 1960s he briefly rejoined the Texas Troubadours but was never fond of touring, and he left once again in 1970 only to return briefly a few years later before leaving for good in 1973. Later, he participated on Pete Drake’s Ernest Tubb tribute album, “The Legend and the Legacy” (1979). He died of natural causes in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 81. He was portrayed by actor Scott Michael Campbell in the film “Crazy” (2008).\n\nBio by: William Bjornstad\n\nGrave Location\n\nSpring Hill Cemetery\n\nFamous Memorials – Find A Grave at Spring Hill Cemetery\n\n(5110 Gallatin Pike S, Nashville, TN 37216)\n\nThe history of Spring Hill dates back to the 1780s when the first settlers moved in from the Cumberland settlement into an area six miles east of Nashville called Haysboro. The land offered fertile soil for their crops and a plentiful steady water source from several springs. Needing a church and school, James Robertson persuaded the Princeton educated Reverend Thomas B. Craighead of Mecklenburg, North Carolina, to move to Haysboro as a preacher and teacher. With a promise of 640 acres of land he arrived in 1785. The settlers had built a log house on the property for him and his family.\n\nBy 1800, Nashville had grown from a string of forts located along various waterways to a thriving little town. It boasted a post office, newspaper, several stores and taverns, and Davidson Academy. In 1806, Davidson Academy was named Davidson College and had moved across the river to College Hill. Several years later when Thomas B. Craighead was replaced by James Preistly , the name was changed again to Cumberland College. The church yard was used as a community burying ground. In 1813, it was designated Craighead Spring Hill Cemetery. As with the case of church or privately held burial grounds, Spring Hill Cemetery had fallen into decay during the civil war.\n\nIn 1888, a company of gentlemen chartered Spring Hill Cemetery for the sale of lots and marketed it as a modern final resting place. These directors drew up the rules of governing, maintaining and protecting the lots, monuments, and procedures of interment. Spring Hill Cemetery continued to grow over the years as additional property was acquired and a system for record keeping was introduced as facilities expanded. J. Taylor Stratton, a prominent stockholder, businessman and civic leader, spearheaded the management and growth of Spring Hill for 30 years. He was an enthusiastic and dedicated member of the school board and he was responsible for developing the county high school system. J. Taylor Stratton School was named in his honor.\n\nIn 1934, Mary Stratton, Stratton’s daughter became president of the cemetery. Known as Miss Mary, she established new roads, statuary, plantings, and other improvements to the property. After her death her husband Dr. James Hayes, a beloved Nashville physician, managed the operations of Spring Hill Cemetery. In 1991 he stepped down to President Emeritus and turned operations over to his son Rev. Jim Hayes. Rev. Hayes, a well known member of the clergy, worked hard to fulfill his mother’s legacy and serve the community.\n\nAfter Rev. Hayes’ sudden death in 1994 and Dr. Hayes’ death in 1996, the Rev. Hayes’ widow Marylyn Poteete Hayes and her daughters operated Spring Hill for many years. In the late 1990s they began working with funeral directors to design and construct a state of the art funeral home to better service their community.\n\nGround breaking occurred in June of 1997 and in 1998 the doors of Spring Hill Funeral Home were opened. The funeral home now stands on Spring Hill Cemetery’s north eastern border overlooking Gallatin Pike. As one of the largest funeral and cemetery providers in Nashville, and with its historic association with the community, Spring Hill continues to occupy a special place in the hearts and minds of Nashville’s citizens.\n\nToday Spring Hill Funeral Home & Cemetery is one of the largest funeral and cemetery providers in Nashville, it’s wide open spaces dotted with majestic trees and beautiful flower gardens offer tranquility and beauty not only to the families it serves but to the community as a whole.\n\nIn addition to two British Royal Air Force veterans of World War II and circus performer Ella Harper,the cemetery is the final resting place for numerous notable music performers including the following:\n\nBobby Hebb: soul singer, songwriter, musician, recording artist, performer\n\nEarl Scruggs: bluegrass musician\n\nFloyd Cramer: piano legend\n\nGeorge Morgan: singer\n\nHank Snow: singer\n\nJimmy Martin: bluegrass singer\n\nJohn Hartford: singer, fiddler\n\nKeith Whitley: singer\n\nRoy Acuff: singer, songwriter, music publisher\n\nKitty Wells: singer\n\nRoy Acuff, Hank Snow, George Morgan, Keith Whitley, Gilbert “Speck” Rhodes, Floyd Cramer, Jimmy Martin, John Hartford, Dean Manuel, Clifton Beverly Briley, Bunny Biggs, Billy Walker, Pete Drake, Louise Scruggs, Johnny Wright, and more.\n\nRoy Claxton Acuff\n\nCountry Music Singer. He is best remembered as the “King of Country Music” and is often credited with moving the genre from its early string band and “hoedown” format to the star singer-based format that helped make it internationally renowned. He was born Roy Claxton Acuff, the third of five children, into a musical family. His father was a Baptist preacher and accomplished fiddle player and his mother played the piano. During his early years, the Acuff house was a popular place for local gatherings and at these events, he would often amuse people by balancing farm tools on his chin. He also learned to play harmonica and jaw harp at a young age. In 1919 his family relocated to Fountain City (now a suburb of Knoxville), Tennessee, where he attended Central High School and sang in the school chapel’s choir as well as performing in school plays. His primary passion was athletics and he was a three-sport standout at Central, and after graduating in 1925, he was offered a scholarship to Carson-Newman University in Jefferson City, Tennessee, but turned it down. He played with several small baseball clubs around Knoxville, worked at odd jobs, and occasionally boxed. In 1929 he tried out for the Knoxville Smokies, a minor-league baseball team then affiliated with the New York (now San Francisco) Giants. After a series of collapses in spring training following a sunstroke, ended his baseball career prematurely and the effects left him ill for several years to the point where he suffered a nervous breakdown in 1930. While recovering, he took up the fiddle, often playing on the family’s front porch in late afternoons after the sun went down. His father gave him several records of regionally-renowned fiddlers, such as Fiddlin’ John Carson and Gid Tanner, which were important influences on his early style. In 1932 he hired on with Dr. Hauer’s Medicine Show as one of its entertainers where he met legendary Appalachian banjoist Clarence Ashley, from whom he learned “The House of the Rising Sun” and “Greenback Dollar,” both of which he later recorded. In 1934 he left the medicine show circuit and began playing at local shows with various musicians in the Knoxville area. That year, guitarist Jess Easterday and Hawaiian guitarist Clell Summey joined Acuff to form the Tennessee Crackerjacks, which performed regularly on Knoxville radio stations WROL and WNOX. Within a year, the group had added bassist Red Jones and changed its name to the Crazy Tennesseans. The popularity of hiss rendering of the song “The Great Speckled Bird” helped the group land a contract with the American Record Company, for whom they recorded several dozen tracks (including the band’s best-known track, “Wabash Cannonball”) in 1936 and 1937 before leaving over a contract dispute. In 1938 the Crazy Tennesseans relocated to Nashville, Tennessee to audition for the Grand Ole Opry and they were offered a contract. He changed the group’s name to the “Smoky Mountain Boys,” referring to the mountains near where he and his bandmates were raised. Shortly after the band joined the Opry, Clell Summey left the group, and was replaced by dobro player Beecher (Pete) Kirby, or “Bashful Brother Oswald.” His powerful lead vocals and Kirby’s dobro playing and high-pitched backing vocals gave the band its distinctive sound. By 1939, Jess Easterday had switched to bass to replace Red Jones, and Acuff had added guitarist Lonnie “Pap” Wilson and banjoist Rachel Veach to fill out the band’s line-up. Within a year, Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys rivaled long-time Opry banjoist Uncle Dave Macon as the troupe’s most popular act. In 1940 he and his band traveled to Hollywood, California, where they appeared in the motion picture “Grand Ole Opry.” He also appeared in several subsequent B-movies, including “O, My Darling Clementine” (1943), in which he played a singing sheriff, and “Night Train to Memphis” (1946), the title of which comes from a song he recorded in 1940. In 1942 he and songwriter Fred Rose formed Acuff-Rose Publishing Company. He originally sought the company in order to publish his own music, but soon realized there was a high demand from other country artists, many of whom had been exploited by larger publishing firms. Due in large part to Rose’s ASCAP connections and gifted ability as a talent scout, Acuff-Rose quickly became the most important publishing company in country music. In 1946, the company signed country singer Hank Williams, and in 1950 published their first major hit, Patti Page’s rendition of “Tennessee Waltz”. Later that year, he left the Grand Ole Opry after a management dispute. In 1948 he made an unsuccessful run for the governor of Tennessee on the Republican ballot. He then spent several years touring the Western United States, although demand for his appearances dwindled with the lack of national exposure and the rise of musicians such as Ernest Tubb and Eddy Arnold, who were more popular with younger audiences. He eventually returned to the Opry however, by the 1960s, his record sales had dropped off considerably. After nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of Sparta, Tennessee in 1965, he contemplated retiring, making only token appearances on the Opry stage and similar shows, and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate Bashful Brother Oswald. In 1972 his career received a brief resurgence in the folk revival movement after he appeared on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album, “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” paving the way for one of the defining moments of his career, which came on the night of March 16, 1974, when the Opry officially moved from the Ryman Auditorium to the Grand Ole Opry House at Opryland, Tennessee. The first show at the new venue opened with a huge projection of a late-1930s image of Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys onto a large screen above the stage. A recording from one of the band’s 1939 appearances was played over the sound system, with the iconic voice of Opry founder George Hay introducing the band, followed by the band’s performance of “Wabash Cannonball”. In the 1980s, after the death of his wife, Mildred, he moved into a house on the Opryland grounds and continued performing. He arrived early most days at the Opry, performing odd jobs, such as stocking soda in backstage refrigerators. In 1991, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts and given a lifetime achievement award by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the first Country music artist to receive the esteemed honor. Additionally, in 1962 he became the first living inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Two museums have been named in his honor, the Roy Acuff Museum at Opryland and the Roy Acuff Union Museum and Library in his hometown of Maynardville. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1541 Vine Street. He died of congestive heart failure in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 89. During his musical career, he recorded a total of 43 albums (from 1949 to 1987) and 20 singles (from 1936 to 1989).\n\nBio by: William Bjornstad\n\nGrave Location\n\nDouglas Granville Odom\n\nShe met him in a drugstore and said to her girlfriends, “That’s the man I’m gonna marry.” And she was right, even though her friends laughed. Doug Odom had caught Louise’s eye.\n\nLittle did she know she was about to begin a journey that would lead her family to kitchens across the country. She and Doug and the children would run a one-pig-a-day meat grinding and mixing business from a converted chicken coop. While she sewed cloth bags stamped “Tennessee Pride,” Doug and the boys would grind and season the meat. And finally, into the back of the Chevy the sausage would go, to be sold by Doug to the grocers of downtown Nashville.\n\nThat was 1943.\n\n“We worked hard, turning our aprons over for the second shift,” recalled Doug Odom Jr. in a 1993 interview. By that point, the chicken coop had become a large-scale sausage production facility outside Nashville, employing more than 500 people. And the company has continued to grow from there.\n\n“Long before Doug started the business, he knew he was going to call it ‘Tennessee Pride,’” Doug said. “That’s because he took pride in what he did and he thought other people should be able to take pride in it, too.”\n\nMore than 70 years after Doug and Louise first built the Odom’s Tennessee Pride brand, the company still takes pride in producing real country sausage featuring Doug’s original secret recipe. This rich heritage and the brand’s commitment to family tradition and quality fresh food are still central to all that we do.\n\nTHE TENNESSEE PRIDE FARMBOY\n\nThe Tennessee Pride farmboy is a cultural icon in rural Tennessee—he has made appearances at the Grand Ol’ Opry in Nashville, and on countless television programs over the years. Though his public appearances are less frequent these days, the farmboy still holds a special place in the heart of folks who grew up with Odom’s Tennessee Pride on their families’ kitchen tables.\n\n“I remember I was sitting at the kitchen table with a friend from school when Daddy came in and asked me to draw a picture for his new brand of sausage,” says Judy Wilkerson, daughter of Doug and Louise Odom, founders of Odom’s Tennessee Pride Sausage, Inc. “Daddy picked the pole-toting farmboy because he wanted something simple. He liked plain country ways, and it never occurred to him to think differently.”\n\nFor more than 70 years since that sunny Tennessee afternoon in the Odoms’ kitchen, the farmboy has continued to represent down-home simplicity that our families, friends, and consumers love.\n\nGrave Location\n\nHank Snow\n\nCountry Music Singer, Composer. Hank Snow was a Canadian who achieved country music notoriety far from the American area that developed and shaped this musical form. At the time of his death in Madison (Nashville suburb) at age 85, he was given major credit for transforming country music from a largely rural musical style to an internationally popular mode. Hank Snow had a huge following in Britain, Germany, Australia and the Far East. Born Clarence Eugene Snow in Brooklyn, Nova Scotia, he would at age fourteen buy his first guitar for under ten dollars from a mail order catalog, self learn to play, then go on to a 45-year show business career while recording and selling over 70 million records. His songs “I’m Moving On” was number one for almost two years followed by “Don’t Hurt Anymore” for almost the same lengthy period. Other number one hits…”Golden Rocket” “The Rhumba Boogie” ” “I’ve Been Everywhere” and “Hello Love.” Other major hits included “Fool Such as I ” “Beggar into a King” and “Ninety Miles An Hour (Down a Dead End Street).” In all, he had more than 40 songs place in the country music Top Ten. He was already famous in the small country and western song market of Canada before venturing to the U.S. and a national tour in 1940. Hank appeared at two major events, the Wheeling Jamboree in West Virginia and the Big D Jamboree in Dallas. An Attempted Hollywood movie career was unsuccessful. The acquirement of a trained horse named Shawnee with appearances at arenas doing tricks, daredevil riding and singing did not help. Settling in Nashville, “The Capital of Country Music” in 1949, the city would not only become a springboard to fame and fortune, his naturalization in 1958 but his hometown until his death. He would initially struggle here even to the point of almost returning to Canada. An invitation to the Grand Ole Opry was the key. Snow would become a member and remain for fifty two years. However, in the latter part of the 60’s, aging would diminish his career and he would disappear from the charts and be basically gone as RCA dropped him from their list of performers after some 45 years and making over 140 albums. His health began to decline some three years before his death after developing respiratory problems. He was released from a Nashville hospital just two weeks before passing away at his Rainbow Ranch in Madison from heart failure. Funeral services were held at The Grand Ole Opry. His closed casket sat at the foot of the Opry stage, as performers took turns lauding the famous country singer including Marty Stuart. The audience mirrored the who’s who of country music including Garth Brooks and country veterans Little Jimmy Dickens and Kitty Wells. Some interesting facts about Hank Snow…His formal education was a sixth grade level but he became a gifted songwriter. His songs have been sung by hundreds of performers, including Ray Charles and the Rolling Stones. He was inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The 1975 film “Nashville” about a self-obsessed country star portrayed by Henry Gibson was based on his life. His autobiography “The Hank Snow Story” was published in 1994. The establishment of The Hank Snow Country Music Centre in Liverpool, Nova Scotia in 1997 has made it Canada’s country music capital. Their goal is to maintain and preserve the history of Canadian country music and each year induct a deserving performer into its hall of fame. The Center is housed in Liverpool’s abandoned Railway Station where Hank sought shelter during his abusive childhood.
