        "text": "We are now closing the live blog, but please follow our live coverage on this new page where we will continue reporting on the latest developments since the assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a campaign rally.\n\nStay with the Al Jazeera Live team as we bring you all the latest developments, analysis and reactions throughout the day.\n\nThank you.\n\nTens of thousands are getting ready for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the issue of security likely to dominate conversations.\n\n“I feel pretty safe. I know security measures have been amped up quite a bit. I feel pretty confident, especially after yesterday’s night event that everybody will have their eyes wide open as far as security goes,” Milwaukee resident Corin Jones said. “I like to have confidence in us as a society that we won’t let things get out of control beyond what they already are,” he added.\n\n“As far as security concerns, I trust that all is being taken care of considering what happened yesterday. This is gonna be even tighter than usual,” Phillip Reitz, another resident, said.\n\nAt the event, one of the most important in US elections, Trump is expected to be officially confirmed as the party’s candidate for the presidential election and to announce who is going to be his running mate.\n\nThe former president has told the New York Post newspaper that his assassination attempt was a “very surreal experience”.\n\n“I’m not supposed to be here, I’m supposed to be dead,” Trump told the Post in an interview while on board his plane en route to Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe 78-year-old praised Secret Service agents for killing the attacker, saying “they took him out with one shot right between the eyes”.\n\nThe image of Trump raising a defiant fist as Secret Service agents bundled him away made front pages around the world and spread virally on social media.\n\n“A lot of people say it’s the most iconic photo they’ve ever seen,” the former president told the Post, adding “They’re right and I didn’t die. Usually you have to die to have an iconic picture.”\n\nDmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic strategist and a major donor to mostly Democratic candidates, has apologised for suggesting that Trump’s shooting had been staged.\n\n“Last night, I sent an email I now regret. I drafted and sent it without consulting my team. I have apologized to them directly. I also want to apologize publicly, without reservation, for allowing my words to distract from last night’s central fact: political violence took yet another innocent American life,” said Mehlhorn, who is also an adviser to billionaire Reid Hoffman.\n\nThe statement comes after news website Semafor reported that he sent an email saying “this ‘shooting’ was encouraged and maybe even staged so Trump could get the photos and benefit from the backlash”.\n\nBitcoin has surged to a two-week high after the attempted assassination of the former president, who has presented himself as a champion of cryptocurrency.\n\nSome investors said the attack bolstered his chances of winning back the White House and trades betting on his victory are expected to increase this week.\n\nBitcoin rose 8.6 percent to $62,508, touching a two-week high of $62,698 earlier in the session, taking its year-to-date gains to 47 percent. Ether was also up 6.8 percent at $3,322.\n\n“He’s certainly positioned himself as pro-crypto and as the odds of his re-election were galvanised by the shooting on the weekend, it’s certainly put a big boost underneath the bid in crypto markets and Bitcoin obviously, just an absolute standout,” said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG.\n\nTrump is due to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, on July 27, the organisers said last week.\n\nThe Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company has paid tribute to Comperatore, the retired firefighter who was killed while attending Trump’s rally.\n\nBlack bunting was draped over the firehouse where Comperatore’s equipment was hung with flowers below, to pay tribute to his life and dedication to his Western Pennsylvania community.\n\nCraig Cirrincione, 27, who worked alongside Comperatore for several years, reflected on the loss of his former colleague and his passion for helping others, saying: “He’s just one of the guys, he don’t do it for the thanks or the pat on the back. Nothing like that.”\n\nMore from Clemons, the host of Al Jazeera’s The Bottom Line.\n\nThe veteran journalist said Biden’s team faces challenges in balancing the need to show statesmanship against violence but also maintain criticism over Trump’s style and methods.\n\n“It’s a tough line to walk. On the one hand, the Democrats have gone through an interesting convulsion over whether Joe Biden is the right person at his age to lead this ticket … there’s still tension over Biden’s leadership, even though people are trying to say that’s been reconciled,” Clemons said.\n\n“And at the same time, there is a real fear over Donald Trump, who said he wants to pardon all of those that have been indicted and convicted for crimes during the January 6th assault on the US Capitol … Those kinds of things are going to draw incredible condemnation from Democrats who are running for office no matter what Biden does. So I don’t sense that the heat is going to be turned down for long on either side.”\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden spoke with former first lady Melania Trump by phone on Sunday, a day after the assassination attempt on her husband, NBC News reported, citing a White House official.\n\nWe reported earlier that Melania Trump issued a statement expressing gratitude for the “brave” officers “who risked their own lives to protect” the Republican presidential candidate. She went on to describe the gunman as “a monster” who saw Trump “as an inhuman political machine”.\n\nThe US president is set to fly on Monday to Las Vegas, where he will deliver remarks on Tuesday at a gathering of the NAACP, an influential civil rights group, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBiden is also scheduled to speak to Latino leaders in the city and participate in other community events on Wednesday.\n\nThe Biden campaign had paused all political communication, including advertisements attacking Trump, in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on him.\n\nThe Associated Press news agency is reporting that Trump spent much of Sunday on the phone with friends, news hosts and local and foreign officials.\n\nOhio Pastor Darrell Scott, a longtime ally, said Trump “was in great spirits” when they spoke on Sunday morning, the AP reported. “He was great, like he always is. He didn’t even make a big deal of it,” Scott said. “He was actually trying to downplay it somewhat, asking how I was doing.”\n\nReince Priebus, who also served as Trump’s White House chief of staff, told ABC’s This Week that Trump was “grateful for the miracle of what happened”. He added, “One quarter inch turned the other direction and we’re obviously talking about something very different this morning.”\n\nThe former Brazilian president said Trump had narrowly escaped death during the attempted shooting, much as he had when stabbed in the stomach at an election rally during his 2018 campaign.\n\n“He was saved, in my opinion, as I was,” Bolsonaro said in a video posted on X.\n\n“The doctors say it was a miracle that I survived in 2018, considering the severity of the injuries, and he [Trump] was saved by a matter of a few centimetres. This, in my opinion, comes from above,” he said, looking to the sky.\n\nBennie Thompson, a member of the US House, said one of his staff members was no longer employed after he learned of a post the staffer made on social media.\n\nScreenshots of her apparent Facebook post, which was related to the attempted assassination of Trump, circulated on social media after the shooting. In the post, the staffer said: “I don’t condone violence but please get you some shooting lessons so you don’t miss next time ooops that wasn’t me talking.”\n\nThompson chaired the special House committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.\n\nSteve Clemons, the host of the Al Jazeera show The Bottom Line, described Biden’s speech and his appeal for unity as “ritualistic” but said it was an “inadequate Band-Aid over a growing volcanic tension” between the two main candidates and their supporters.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump have used incendiary language, Clemons pointed out, although the Trump team has been “more graphic, and even embracing the prospect of political violence”.\n\n“The US political scene is one that is brewing political violence, you can feel it in the air … and going into this season of conventions, there’s going to be a lot of mudslinging and invective that I don’t think this speech tonight by President Biden comes anywhere near solving.”\n\nThe daughter of Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the assassination attempt on Trump, has issued a statement on what happened at the rally.\n\nThe 50-year-old firefighter “died a real-life super hero,” Allyson Comperatore said in a Facebook post. “He threw my mom and I to the ground… [and] shielded my body from the bullet that came at us.”\n\nAllyson described her father as “the best dad a girl could ever ask for,” someone always ready to help and quick to “make friends with anyone”.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who was the target of a kidnapping plot in 2020, has denounced the assassination attempt on Trump and urged Americans to “chart a better path for our politics”.\n\nThe shooting “caps off an alarming, years-long trend in our politics”, she said in a statement issued by her office\n\n“Behind all these incidents is rhetoric. We have seen calls to hate, harm or jail political opponents. Violent conspiracies from the seediest corners of the internet have become incorporated into stump speeches.”\n\nShe added, “If you see unproductive words designed to tear us apart, call them out, no matter who they come from. Hold each other accountable, even in our own party.”\n\nThe former president told The Washington Examiner that he has completely rewritten the speech he was set to deliver at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to focus on unity and not on Biden.\n\n“The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,” Trump told the news outlet. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee said he will now call for a new effort at national unity, noting that people from different political views have called him.\n\n“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” he said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the assassination attempt on Trump, the Republican Party has rallied around the former president, pushing the image of him with his fist raised, blood streaking down his cheek.\n\nEven traditional detractors in the party, such as former President George W Bush, have condemned the assassination attempt.\n\nThe apparent takeover of the party by Trump is likely to be visible throughout the Republican National Convention this week.\n\nFor the Republican Party has indeed become the party of Trump, say experts.\n\nRecent changes within the party and its leadership offer a glimpse of Trump’s plans for the White House, should he succeed in being re-elected this November. These include the appointment of his daughter-in-law Lara Trump as chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the cutting of staff from that committee, aiming to leave only Trump loyalists in place.\n\nRead more here."
