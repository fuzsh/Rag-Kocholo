        "text": "I could probably write for days about Blackberry Smoke. They’ve been a band for a dozen or so years, but I only heard of them last year. I was instantly hooked. It’s one of those things that just happens. The only way I have found to explain why I instantly fell for Blackberry Smoke is that there music is familiar. It feels like I’ve been listening to it for years, like it’s always been there.\n\nThere is nothing forced about Blackberry Smoke, they are who they are and that really comes through in the music they write and play. They know the music they like and that’s what they make…it’s as simple as that really. They don’t try to be what will sell a million records, they are themselves and they play music from their heart and soul – the way music is supposed to be played.\n\nAs musicians they are in fact products of those that influenced them, something they talk about in their Live at Georgia Theatre DVD. Also available digitally through iTunes, the DVD is a live show with interview scenes spread out throughout. You are introduced to the band members, get a little history and hear there thoughts and opinions on their influences, their fans and their music philosophies.\n\nThere is one quote in the DVD that I often post and repost when I watch the DVD. It speaks volumes of why some many people have fallen in love with Blackberry Smoke’s music.\n\n“We’re not fucking around when it comes to music… That’s what we eat, sleep and breathe for… And it’s not about a cute haircut or a catchy tune. It’s about music, you know, making music that makes you get goosebumps. You ever listen to just a part of a song that gives you goosebumps? Like a pedal steel solo or a sax solo or, you know… Wonder if a drum lick has ever given a goosebump? I’m sure it has Brit. Somebody being real, being honest with the music. It’s, you know, not about how many billion copies of this we can sell because somebody’s cute. It’s about making something that sticks to your ribs musically. That’s what Blackberry Smoke does.” – Charlie Starr\n\nThat quote alone is reason enough to love Blackberry Smoke. They’re real people, music lovers, who’ve dedicated a substantial part of their life to their music. It comes across in every song, every live performance, every interview. They have a passion for music. Their fanbase has grown substantially over the years because of it. Those fans are dedicated to “spreading the smoke” to all corners of the earth. I joined those ranks last year and this is one of the ways I am sharing my love of Blackberry Smoke with the world.\n\nTheir music is real, you can relate to it. It touches your heart and soul, makes you wanna dance, reminds you that life isn’t perfect, and takes away your cares for a while.\n\nIt’s time to recommend a few songs that I think you, the reader, should listen to from the Blackberry Smoke catalog. This is really hard to do. There are so many I think you should listen to…like, all of them, really. That’s most what I tell people who ask me about them when they ask what album to pick up – all of them. But I do have to pick a few for this feature, so as with my recommendations, if you have to start with one album, it should be their most recent The Whippoorwill.\n\nHere are three songs from The Whippoorwill I think you should check:\n\n“Sleeping Dogs” – Rhapsody Link: http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackberry-smoke/album/the-whippoorwill/track/sleeping-dogs\n\n“The Whippoorwill” – Rhapsody Link: http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackberry-smoke/album/the-whippoorwill/track/the-whippoorwill\n\n“One Horse Town” – Rhapsody Link: http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackberry-smoke/album/the-whippoorwill/track/one-horse-town\n\nHere the video for “Pretty Little Lie” from The Whippoorwill:\n\nHere are three tracks from A Little Piece of Dixie, released in 2011:\n\n“Who Invented the Wheel” – Rhapsody Link: http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackberry-smoke/album/a-little-piece-of-dixie/track/who-invented-the-wheel\n\n“Bottom of This” – Rhapsody Link: http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackberry-smoke/album/a-little-piece-of-dixie/track/bottom-of-this\n\n“Prayer for the Little Man” – Rhapsody Link: http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackberry-smoke/album/a-little-piece-of-dixie/track/prayer-for-the-little-man\n\nHere’s the video for “Good One Comin’ On” from A Little Piece of Dixie:\n\nCheck out their entire catalog on Rhapsody or the music service of your choice. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed – especially if you’re a Southern Rock fan. Their music is reminiscent of the 70’s music scene, yet has some hard rock and country elements to it that make it unique.\n\nFor more information about Blackberry Smoke, visit their official site at www.blackberrysmoke.com.\n\nFinally, here are couple of acoustic songs from YouTube.com – this is amazing stuff, really captures what Blackberry Smoke is all about.\n\nGet to know Blackberry Smoke:\n\nWith the recent passing of George Jones, musicians and music fans from all walks of life have expressed the importance of his music to everyone.\n\nAs the singer of some of country music’s most enduring classics and the one who made “He Stopped Loving Her Today” the greatest country song ever recorded, Jones blurred boundaries by being accepted by all kinds of music fans. His contributions to country music are undeniable, but his contributions to all of music have come to light after his death.\n\nI am one of those people who likes what I like and don’t pay attention to genre. It’s not about looks or how big your show is, it’s about the music. Above all else, the music has to speak to me, no matter if it is serious, happy, silly or sad. George Jones has done that for me. Fun songs, happy songs or sad songs, his music spoke to me.\n\nWhen he released “Who’s Gonna Fill Their Shoes?”, he wondered what country music would be like after the legends have passed. He lived long enough to see country music change dramatically from even when that song was released in the mid-80’s. As time progressed, more than just Jones wondered who the next legend would be and if they would carry on the traditions of the past.\n\nAs the legends we’re pushed off country radio by the new class of artists coming in, Jones reminded everyone that he “Don’t Need Your Rockin’ Chair” – a feisty tune reminding the younger generations that there is still a lot of life left in him and his contemporaries. Those new kids from the late 80s and 90s now find themselves in that very position of being pushed out of radio playlists for the simple fact of being too old.\n\nMusic is cyclic and everything old becomes new again. Some artists are timeless and carry on forever even after their passing. Traditional country may in fact make a comeback some day, but timeless legends like George Jones don’t come around very often. His legacy, his music, his style will all live on forever.\n\nIt should be the goal of every country fan, every music fan, out there to remind younger generations to appreciate what came before them, learn from them and carry on their life’s work knowing that tomorrow isn’t promised to anyone. A George Jones only comes along once in a lifetime. His legend will live forever, and no, no one can fill his shoes.\n\nHere’s a link to a Rhapsody playlist of George Jones songs: http://www.rhapsody.com/playlist/pp.107478487\n\nHere are some YouTube links as well:\n\nArtist of the Week: Mavis Staples\n\nBorn: July 10, 1939\n\nWhat makes Mavis Staples so special for me is the passion that she has for music and performing. The 2013 Grammy’s just proved that without a doubt. She was so into what she was doing that she continued even after the rest of the band had stopped playing. Her style of performing transports her into the music – she feels it, she lives it.\n\nMy first introduction to Mavis Staples was in 1994 with the release of Rhythm, Country and Blues. Marty Stuart and The Staples Singers performed “The Weight” on that album. That is the song I will always associate with Ms. Staples. It is what she performed at the Grammys and my first time hearing her sing 19 years ago.\n\nMs. Staples career has spanned decades, with her performing as part of the The Staple Singers and as a solo artist. The Staple Singers released nine albums between 1971 and 1984. As a solo artist she has released thirteen albums, the most recent in 2010. As a member of the Staples Singers she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nFor more information about Ms. Staples and what her schedule is, please check out her web site at MavisStaples.com.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite Mavis Staples/The Staples Singers tracks (Rhapsody links included):\n\n“The Weight” (Marty Stuart & The Staples Singers) from Rhythm, Country and Blues – http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/various-artists/album/rhythm-country-and-blues/track/the-weight\n\n“I’ll Take You There” (The Staples Singers) from The Best of The Staples Singers – http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-staple-singers/album/the-best-of-the-staple-singers-stax/track/ill-take-you-there\n\n“Respect Yourself” (The Staples Singers) from Greatest Hits – http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-staple-singers/album/greatest-hits/track/respect-yourself\n\n“Let’s Do It Again” (The Staples Singers) from Let’s Do It Again – Greatest Hits – http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-staple-singers/album/lets-do-it-again—greatest-hits/track/lets-do-it-again\n\n“This Little Light” (Mavis Staples) from Live: Hope At The Hideout – http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/mavis-staples/album/live-hope-at-the-hideout/track/this-little-light\n\nHere are some video clips from YouTube:\n\n“I’ll Take You There” – http://youtu.be/l64Bte5ygvM\n\n“Touch A Hand, Make A Friend” (The Staples Singers) – http://youtu.be/MwAZ-xmuc74\n\n“Respect Yourself” (The Staples Singers) – http://youtu.be/oab4ZCfTbOI\n\nHere’s a link to see the 2013 Grammy’s tribute to Levon Helm – http://deadspin.com/5983262/heres-the-balls+out-levon-helm-grammy-awards-memorial-tribute-performance-of-the-weight?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&utm_source=deadspin_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow\n\nSource: MavisStaples.com, Wikipedia, Rhapsody and YouTube.\n\nArtist: Billie Holiday\n\nBirth Date: April 7, 1915 Died: July 17, 1959\n\nBillie Holiday was born in Philadelphia, PA and raised most of her young life in Baltimore, MD.

It’ll be where I share some of the artists I like and have an interest in. These articles will include a few facts and some personal thoughts about each artist, plus some of my favorite songs as well. I won’t promise you’ll hear the most famous recordings they’ve done, as I have come to love deep album cuts more than radio singles.

While most famous for fronting Blackfoot and playing guitar in Lynyrd Skynyrd, he has been playing and performing since he was a child.\n\nHe got his start playing with his grandfather, Shorty Medlocke, learning such instruments as the banjo, guitar and drums. He also learned to play the mandolin and dobro, as well as the keyboards as he got older.\n\nRickey played with Blackfoot from its inception until rejoining Lynyrd Skynyrd. He was a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd in the early seventies, playing drums on the Muscle Shoals sessions. He also wrote and sang a few songs on those sessions.\n\nMusic is a passion for Rickey; he practices or plays every day and has an energy on stage that performers a third his age can’t match. For me, personally, that energy is what has captivated me and just made me a fan from the first time I watched him live.\n\nI will rarely say I am the biggest fan because a lot of the time I’m late to the party. I had known a Blackfoot song or two and a Lynyrd Skynyrd song or two. But in 2010, the first time I got to see Lynyrd Skynyrd live I was hooked. I had to have everything I could get my hands on. Now I had seen Lynyrd Skynyrd and Montgomery Gentry on CMT Crossroads, I remember taping it. I am a Montgomery Gentry fan. I knew of Blackfoot from Warrant covering “Train, Train.” That was about it until 2010.\n\nIn 2010, my boss opened for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The rest as they say is history. I was hooked on everything Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blackfoot. I bought the “Lyve” DVD before I went to New Jersey to see Lynyrd Skynyrd live and I just fell in love with Rickey and the way he played. It is one of those things you can’t explain. He’ll often say that the pre-crash version of Lynyrd Skynyrd had this “magic” about them, well he does, too.\n\nThrough interviews, articles and stories I have learned a lot about Rickey, Blackfoot, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the whole scene that they emanated from. I still have much more to learn, but as time goes by I learn a lot about what drives people with longevity in this business. Rickey was once asked how to describe himself in three words. Those three words were “a real musician.” That is the definition of someone who would play no matter what, they live and breathe music and it is a big part of their soul.\n\nI appreciate that, it is what has endeared me to the musicians that I admire. Many of those are guitar players – Marty Stuart, Keith Urban, Vince Gill – and they all have a passion for music that shows in everything they do. Rickey’s passion is evident, always front and center, he enjoys himself and that makes him fun to watch.\n\nRickey, of Native American heritage, is also working with First American Productions on a series of documentaries about reservations and Native heritage in America. The first episode of “Homeland Nation” was about the Mescalero Apache. Rickey narrated, interviewed guests and wrote and performed songs for the soundtrack. Additional episodes are in the works as well.\n\nThe music selections for Rickey’s Artist of the Week feature are selections from throughout his career with Blackfoot, Lynyrd Skynyrd and solo pieces as well. All of the following selections, except for “Guitar Slinger’s Song And Dance” can be found on Rhapsody and links are below (and iTunes).\n\n1. “White Dove” – Lynyrd Skynyrd’s First -The Complete Muscle Shoals Album – Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/lynyrd-skynyrd/album/skynyrds-first-the-complete-muscle-shoals/track/white-dove\n\n2. “Gimme Gimme Gimme” – Tomcattin’ – Blackfoot\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackfoot/album/tomcattin/track/gimme-gimme-gimme\n\n3. “Every Man Should Know (Queenie)” – Tomcattin’ – Blackfoot\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackfoot/album/tomcattin/track/every-man-should-know-queenie\n\n4. “Rattlesnake Rock ‘n’ Roller” – Marauder – Blackfoot\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackfoot/album/marauder/track/rattlesnake-rock-n-roller\n\n5. “Fly Away” – Marauder­ – Blackfoot\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackfoot/album/marauder/track/fly-away\n\n6. “Skynyrd Nation” – God and Guns – Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/lynyrd-skynyrd/album/god-and-guns/track/skynyrd-nation\n\n7. “Guitar Slinger’s Song And Dance” – Medicine Man­ – Blackfoot\n\n8. “Train, Train” – Strikes – Blackfoot\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/blackfoot/album/strikes-rhinoelektra/track/train-train\n\n9. “Bandalero” – Homeland Nation Soundtrack – Rickey Medlocke and Mark Woerpel\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/various-artists/album/homeland-nation-soundtrack/track/bandalero\n\n10. “Native Colors” – Homeland Nation Soundtrack – Rickey Medlocke and Mark Woerpel\n\nhttp://www.rhapsody.com/artist/various-artists/album/homeland-nation-soundtrack/track/native-colors\n\nYou can also check out the following YouTube videos:\n\n1.
