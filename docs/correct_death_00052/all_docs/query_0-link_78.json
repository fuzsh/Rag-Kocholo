        "text": "Sarah Gibson's Book Sarah Gibson was born in 1844. She included some information on the Parks family who married into her Gibson family in the middle chapters of her Gibson genealogy Introduction here Book: here Begin in Chapter 5: SECTION V Andrew Gibson (son of the first Robert) was born about 1724, settled in Antrim Township, Franklin Co., PA, on the Maryland boundary line about five miles north from Hagarstown, MD., where he died March 1783. The executor of his Will was his wife Elizabeth. Her name before marriage was Elizabeth Carnes or Karns. Andrew Gibson served a tour of duty on the frontiers of Cumberland Co., during the Revolution (from manuscript archives of PA.) Their children were as follows: Margaret Gibson, born about 1750, married Parks. Thomas Gibson, born 1752, Capt of a Company of Cumberland Co., Militia, Jan. 1778, and was Col. of a battalion July 1778. John Gibson, born 1754, served as a private in Capt. James Poe's Com. July 1777, and in Capt McCoy's Com. Jan. 1778. Jean Gibson, born abt 1756, married Daniel Long. Elizabeth Gibson, born abt 1758, married James Sterling of Baltimore. There are records of land titles in Franklin Co., PA. George Gibson, 520 acres of land, Andrew Gibson, 203 acres of land, October 28, 1746. There were several other Gibson families at this time in Cumberland Co., but their records are very incomplete. John Carnes enters land in 1748, also Robert Armstrong and William Maxwell, Robert Richey, Hugh Martin, and John Martin and James Parks was Commission Clerk 1796 to 1799. -------- CHAPTER V I will now continue the account concerning our branch of the Gibsons, which was Andrew Gibson, second son of Robert Gibson, who came from Stewartstown, Ireland. Andrew was born in Ireland, but perhaps married in America. He and his wife were both Scotch-Irish, and there is a tradition that these Gibsons were from London, and went to Ireland in Queen Ann's reign. Andrew Gibson and his wife were members of the Associate, or Seceder Church. And there were churches of this belief at Greencastle, Mercersburg, and Chambersburg, in Franklin Co., PA. Of Andrew's daughters, Margaret Parks, and Jean Long, I have no farther record. Elizabeth, his youngest daughter, married James Sterling of Baltimore. He was a merchant from Scotland. He was a member of the Associate Church. He was an energetic business man. He built the first quay for ships landing in Baltimore. Before this, all ships had landed at Annapolis. James Sterling bought some marshy land, and drained it, and filled the marsh and made the finest landing in Baltimore. People at first laughed at him for his investment, \"but they laugh who win\", is the old proverb. Col. Thomas Gibson, Andrew's oldest son, lived in Baltimore and was in partnership with his brother-in-law James Sterling. Thomas never married, and was a very rich man at his death, and his brother John ought to have inherited some of his property, but John lived so far away in Tenn., so it was all kept by the Sterlings. John Gibson, second son of Andrew Gibson, and my great grandfather, married Martha Parks of Hagarstown, MD., in the year 1772. The genealogy of Martha Parks family is as follows: Elizabeth Knox, born before 1700, said to have been related to John Knox, married _____ Alexander. Their daughter, Jean Alexander, married 1st, _____ Morrow. Their children as follows: Thomas Morrow. Elizabeth Morrow. Mrs. Jean (Alexander) Morrow, married 2nd, James Parks. Their children as follows: James Parks. Margaret Parks. Martha Parks, born 1753, in County Down, Ulster Province, in the north of Ireland.\n\nJames Parks, and his family, came to America about 1760, and lived in or near Baltimore. Thomas Morrow married and had children, and one daughter married Andrews. The Andrews lived near Nashville, Tenn. They had a large family of children. Their daughter, Nancy, married Rev. Robert Armstrong. Of them, we will have a more extended account in the future. Her brother, Hugh Andrews, was one of the earliest settlers of Green Co., Ohio. About the time the Parks came to Baltimore, there were about 25 houses, only four of which were of brick. The others perhaps were of logs, of every primitive structure. James Parks had a store in Baltimore, and about 1770, he sent his son, James Parks, Jr., to open a store in Hagarstown, MD, and his sister, Martha Parks, went with him to keep house for him. She had a colored woman to help with the work. James Parks was a royalist.Already trouble had commenced in the Colonies. The Colonists refused to be taxed so unjustly by England, and the Colonists were not allowed to have any representation in the English Parliament. The Colonists were not allowed to manufacture anything in America. But they were obliged to buy everything from England. Beaver skins were caught in America, and sent to England to be made into hats, and then the Colonists had to by the hats. There was a sever punishment for any man who dared to manufacture a beaver hat for himself, and there were many other articles in this same class. Window glass was another article that was taxed. The Colonists said they would not buy, but that they would do without these articles, and the Colonists formed companies of mounted militia to scour the country to enforce this rule, that the Colonists should not buy these things, and stores were entered, and if any of the condemned articles were found, they were destroyed by the soldiers militia. John Gibson, son of Andrew, belonged to one of these Continental militia. One day they rode into Hagarstown. They entered James Parks store, there they found some beaver hats that had been manufactured in England. The militia took the hats out into the street and made a bonfire of them. Naturally, James Parks would hate all of the Continental militia after the destruction of his fine English beaver hats. James Parks invited some of his Baltimore friends to visit him at Hagarstown. In those days, they traveled on horse-back, and carried their clothes in saddle bags. Saddle bags were made of leather, about 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 yards long and about half a yard wide. They were sewed down one side, and around both ends, and the other side one third, in the middle was left open, to put in what the owner wished to carry. Then it was strapped together, with a leather strap passed back and forth through slits cut in the edges of the saddle bags. It was thrown across the horse and fastened with straps to the saddle. In these they carried their money and their clothes, and often some corn for their horse. I have a pair in my possession now. James Parks had bought for his sister, a fine English chintz dress, and the skirt was cut with gores and a train. In her hurry in waiting on her brother's guests, she switched her train, over a pile of delft china plates, that stood on a stone bench in the kitchen, and the plates were all broken in pieces. She was dreadfully frightened for she was afraid her brother would be very angry with her for her accident. So she went into the cellar, where her brother had his dishes stored, and got another set of plates exactly like the broken set, and she carried the broken dishes out and buried them under the currant bushes, and her brother never found out about the broken plates. John Gibson soon became acquainted with Martha Parks, for his home in Antrim Township, Franklin Co., PA., was about ten miles from Hagarstown. But James Parks did not approve of Continental militia and he forbade Martha having anything to do with such rascals. But Martha was for the cause of the Colonists, and she had her own riding horse, and she and John Gibson often met without her brother knowing of it. They were married in Maryland in 1773. They lived in Chambersburg, and also on Andrew Gibson's farm in Antrim Township, I have heard. Their children are as follows: Thomas Gibson, born July 31, 1774, in Chambersburg. Margaret Gibson, born March 26, 1776, in Chambersburg. Andrew Jackson Gibson, born Feb. 16, 1778, in Chambersburg. William Gibson, born July 31, 1781, in Chambersburg. John Gibson, born March 18, 1785, in Chambersburg. James Parks Gibson, born Nov. 18, 1793, in Blount Co., Tenn. George Gibson, born Sept. 19, 1798. This record I copied from great grandfather John Gibson's Bible bought in Blount Co., Tenn., in the year Feb. 23, 1804. This Bible, he gave to his son, John Gibson, and John Gibson gave it to his oldest son, Cyrus Gibson, or it became his after his mother's death. There is a tradition in the family that Martha and John Gibson had two or three children, that met with an accidental death. One was lost in the woods of Tenn, and one fell on a pair of scissors. But their names were not written in this old Bible of John Gibson's. I have heard that their names were, Samuel, Othniel, and Robert. In Chapter 6 we get MORE daughters married: I believe the family changed the spelling of their name in Tenn., for my grandmother Gibson always said her name had been Hogg, and she would never own the name of Hogue, and in my reading of the American Archived, I often found the name Hogg, but never saw the name Hogue. The Hogg's came from the north of Ireland, but in what year I do not know. They settled in Virginia near to Alexandria, and the creek of Bulls Run ran through their farm. James Hogg married Margaret Parks of Baltimore, Md. She was a sister of James Parks, Jr., of Hagarstown, and sister of Martha Parks, who married John Gibson of Antrim Township, Franklin Co., PA. James Hogg was a farmer and a raiser of fine stock, and he and his wife were members of the Associate or Seceder Church. The following is from the American Archives. \"Before the Revolution, George Washington and Peter Hogg, both took up land in Augusta Co., VA. Washington had 5,000 acres, and Peter Hougg had 2,100 acres of land, and one of the Hogg brothers and some other white men were killed on the head waters of the Kanawha River. A James Hogg took up land in Greenbrier Co., VA.\" My grandmother, Martha Hogue was born in Greenbrier Co., VA, Oct. 31, 1774. In what year her father moved there I have not been able to find out. During the Revolution, the Indians encouraged by the British and helped with arms, committed cruel depredations on the distant frontiers, and many had to give up their farms and return to the settlement. And nothing remained in a few years to show that the white man had been there. The cabins were burned to the ground, and the clearings made by the settlers were grown up with brush. The children of James Hogg and Margaret Parks, his wife, are as follows: John Hogg, married in Va. Samuel Hogg, married in Blount Co., Tenn. Martha Hogg, born Oct 31, 1774, in Greenbrier Co., West VA., and married Thomas Gibson, son of John Gibson, of Lexington, VA Esther Hogg, married _____ Maxwell in Blount Co., Tenn. George Hogg, married Margaret McCartney, Tenn. Jean Hogg, married 1st, William Neally in Tenn., and 2nd, George Sloan in Tenn. Sarah Hogg, married _____ Ritchey, related to Thomas Gibson. Seceders Church from Sarah's Book: CHAPTER VII Before the war of the Revolution, several families, and individuals, who had belonged to the Associate or Seceder Church, both in Scotland, and Ireland, emigrated to what afterwards became the State of Tennessee. They settled at Nashville, and about twenty miles south of Knoxville in east Tennessee, Knoxville was the first capital of Tennessee. It is in Knox County, north of Blount County, and near the Holstein River, which is the boundary line between the two counties. About the year 1782, The Presbytery of the Associate Church of Pennsylvania, received a petition from these two places, Nashville and Knoxville, praying for preachers to be sent to them. But it was impossible for the Presbytery to grant this petition, for the ministers had to be sent from Scotland, for there was not at that time any place in America for the theological education of the ministers of the Associate Church. And it was difficult to obtain ministers for the Associate Church of the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina, where there were the greatest numbers of the Associate Churches. And there were a few churches in some of the New England States. But these people continued steadfast in their faith, and often renewed their petitions for a preacher of the Gospel. It was 16 years before they received their first ministerial visit. Between 1790 and 1792, John Gibson, and all of his children, and James Hogg, and all of his children moved to Blount County, Tennessee. I do not know if other families went with them, but it was always desirable to have a large colony in those early days, to form new settlements in new States. Their journeys were long and weary, some through the wilderness infested with wild animals, and the more terrible Indians. Our ancestors were always interested in having churches and schools, where ever they lived. And were educated, well informed people, as the times and their surroundings would afford. They journeyed down the Shenandoah Valley, between the mountains, following the streams and rivers, for then they were the main highways of the Colonies. And along the rivers were the most settlements. And the rivers afforded a supply of water for their stock, and for themselves. And the soil of the bottom land is the richest and the most productive. --------------end of Sarah Gibson's book------------------------------------------- Missing Link - John Parks of York County, PA - LK=OQ by Jean Churchill PS#934 Librarian The following report was compiled in September, 2003. The Lineage Key is OQ. This manuscript was put together from materials submitted by Richard Martens, PS#1242. Strong documentation links this John Parks lineage to the Andrew Gibson lineage.

When the topic of their marriage arose in 1796, GW, acting in place of Harriot's deceased father, assured Parks that if he were \"a gentleman of respectable connexions; and of good dispositions,\" and able to support her decently, he would assent to the marriage, declaring: \"my wish is to see my niece happy\" (GW to Parks, 7 April 1796, DLC:GW; Betty Washington Lewis to GW, 27 Mar. 1796, ViMtV). GW sent his niece \"a great deal of good advice which,\" Harriot replied, \"I am extremely obliged to you for.\" The wedding took place in July 1796 (Harriot Washington Parks to GW, 17 July 1796, DLC:GW). There are letters between Andrew Parks and George Washington 17906-1798 see: this and Enter \"Andrew Parks\" see:this for an excellent discussion of George Washington's correspondence with Andrew Parks. Nineteen year old Harriet Washington is sent to Fredericksburg and falls in love with Andrew Parks. Andrew writes to President Washington asking for the hand of his niece Harriet:\n\nSir Fredericksburg 1st April 1796 Although entirely unknown to you, circumstances relative to your Niece Miss Harriot Washington and myself, makes it necessary for me to trouble you with a Letter, and to give you intimation of what has occur'd between us; I have made my addresses to her and she has refered me to you, whose consent I am to acquire, or her objections to a Union with me are I am assur'd insuperable, having therefore no hope of possessing her, unless I should be so fortunate as to obtain your assent, and as my happiness measurably depends upon your determination, I shall endeavour by stating to you my situation and prospects in Life, to merit and induce your approbation, yet they are such as I fear will not much conduce to your favourable decission; I have lived in Fredericksburg for more than three years. My connexions generally reside in Baltimore, and are mostly rich. I am engaged here in the Mercantile Business and concerned therein with my Brother-in-Law, Mr. McElderry of Baltimore.(see McElderry data below) My fortune at present does not much exceed three thousand pounds, but with industry and economy, I have every expectation of rapidly improving my condition in that respect. To enter into a detail of my family, I suppose would be unnecessary, however I shall be in Baltimore a few weeks hence, and if in the interim, you should propose no objection of me, I will take the liberty of writing to you again and give you a more particular account of myself and friends, when it is probable my pecuniary situation may be meliorated The inclosed Letter from Mrs Lewis, who I solicited to write and say something to you concerning me. I am Sir with infinite respect Yr most Obt Humle Serv. Andrew Parks From George Washington to Andrew Parks, 7 April 1796 Philadelphia 7th April 1796 Sir your letter of the first instt has been duly received. The subject on which it is written is a serious one, and it shall meet, as it deserves, a serious consideration. My neice Harriot Washington having very little fortune of her own, neither she, nor her friends, have a right to make that (however desirable it might be) a primary consideration in a matrimonial connexion. But there are other requisites which are equally desirable, and which ought to be attended to in a union of so much importance; without therefore expressing at this moment, either assent, or dissent, to the proposal you have made, it is necessary for me to pause. My wish is to see my niece happy; one step towards which is, for her to be united with a gentleman of respectable connexions, and of good dispositions; with one who is more in the habit (by fair and honorable pursuits) of making, than in spending moneyâand who can support her in the way she has always lived. As you propose being in Baltimore in the course of a few weeksâI shall not object to the receipt of any further details on this subject, which you may be disposed to give from that place: which, when received, may enable me to write more decisively frome hence, or from virginia when I get thereâwhich will happen, I expect, as soon as Congress shall have closed its session. I am sir your very Hble servt From George Washington to Betty Washington Lewis, 7 April 1796 My dear Sister, Philadelphia 7th April 1796. Your letter of the 27th Ulto was enclosed to me by Mr Parks, in one from himself, dated the 1st insttt on the same subject. Harriot having very little fortune herself, has no right to expect a great one in the man she marry's; but if he has not a competency to support her in the way she has lived, in the circle of her friends, she will not find the matrimonial state so comfortable as she may have expected when a family is looking up to her & but scanty means to support it. Altho' she has no right to expect a man of fortune, she certainly has just pretensions to expect one whose connexions are respectable, & whose relations she could have no objection to associate with. How far this is, or is not the case with Mr Parks, I know not for neither his own letter, or yours give any acct of his family nor whether he is a native or a foreignerâ& we have his own word only for his possessing any property at all altho' he estimates his fortune at Â£3000. A precarious dependance this when applied to a man in Trade. I do not wish to thwart Harriots inclination if her affectns are placed on Mr Park and if upon the enquiries I shall mak[e] or cause to be made into his family & connexions, there shall be found nothing exceptionable in them; that he is, as you say \"very much respected by all his acquaintance, sober, sedate, & attentive to business;\" and is moreover in good business; I shall throw no impedimts in the way of their Marriage, altho' I should have preferred, if a good match had not offer'd in the meanwhile that she sh'd have remained single until I was once more settled at Mt Vernon & she a resident there which, if life is spared to us, will certainly happen to me in ten or eleven monthsâbecause then she would have been in the way of seeing much company, and would have had a much fairer prospect of matching respectably than with one who is little knownâand of whose circumstances few or none can know much about. Having had no business to write to you uponâand being very much occupied by my public duties, are the only reasons why I have been silent. I am persuaded you will enjoy more ease & quiet, & meet with fewer vexations where you now are, than where you did liveâIt is my sincere wish that you should do so and that your days may be happyâin these Mrs Washington joins with Your most Affecte Brother G. Washington From George Washington to George Washington Lewis, 7 April 1796 Philadelphia 7th April 1796 Dear Sir Tuesday's Post brought me a letter from a Mr Andrew Parks of Fredericksburgh, covering one from your mother; both on the subject of overtures of marriage made by the former to your cousin Harriot Washington: which, it seems, depend upon my consent for consummatn. My sister speaks of Mr Parks as a sober, discreet man; and one who is attentive to business. Mr Parks says of himself, that his \"fortune at present, does not much exceed Â£3000, but with industry & Åconomy, he has every expectation of rapidly improving his condition\" being concerned with his brother in law Mr McElderry of Baltimore, in Mercantil[e] business. As I am an entire stranger to Mr Parks; to his family connexions, or his connexions in trade; to his mode of living; his habitsâand to his prospects in trade; I should be glad if you wd ascertain them with as much precision as you can, and write me with as little delay as you can well avoid. Harriot having little or no fortune of her own, has no right to expect a great one in the man she marrys: but it is desirable that she should marry a gentleman; one who is well connected, and can support her decently, in the line she has always moved, otherwise she would not find matrimony with a large family & little means, so eligable as she may have conceived it to be. I am your sincere friend and Affectionate Uncle Go: Washington This letter will be accompanied by one to my Sister which I pray you to receive from the Post Office and send to her. Sir Baltimore 30th April 1796 I have had the honour to receive your Letter of the 7th Instt, and pursuant thereto, I have communicated within a few days, that I have been here; the Subject, to my friend Mr Mc Elderry, on which I am so materially interested, for your approbation; he has written to the Secretary at War, and given him an oppinion of me, of which, I presume you have, or will, be advertisd. Mr Mc Elderry, has relinquished his part of the concern, in the business, I have been pursuing, which I shall conduct hereafter on my own Acct, and with industry; and his friendship, I suspect will be attended with considerable advantages; this is the only amendment in my prospects, I have it in my power to acquaint You with. I hope I possess most of the requisites, necessary to make your Niece, happy I have been for several Years, accustom'ed to Business, which has,, I am persuaded, kept me clear of a temper, for vicious dispositions; my connexions, are respectable generally, inasmuch as they are people of Business, and mostly in good circumstances. I have described to your Niece, as nearly as I could, what my Situation would afford, in the style of living; which wd not be more than genteel, and comfortable, this she sais, will perfectly satisfy her, and render her happy, provided you can think it sufficient. I am Sir with infinite respect Yr very Hbe Sert Andrew Parks To George Washington from Betty Washington Lewis, 26 June 1796 June 26th 1796 My Dear Brother Your letter of the 27th of April I receiv'd and should have answerd it sooner but expecting you in dayly postpon'd writing untill you arriv'd at Mount Vernon, not hearing from you again on Harriots subject, I have been makeing all the enquirey I Could concerning Mr Parks that was in my power I have heard nothing to his disadvantage on the contrary he is respected by all his acquaintance he is A Constant Visitor here and I believe Harriots Affections are plac'd intirely on him, and engag'd so far as this if your consent can be obtaind. Harriot begs you will pardon her not writing her self but hopes your being fully acquainted with her Sentiments Concerning Mr Parks will be some apology she is not well I believe her anxiety for fear of offending and not gaining your consent has Produc'd this, your long Silence has given her much uneasiness. My Dear Brother if you have any Mules for Sale and Can let me have One I will with pleasure pay you the Price of it I am under the necessity of purchaiseing A Work Nag and prefer A Mule. Harriot Joines me in love and good Wishes for You and my Sister Washington and beleive me to be Your Affectte Sister Betty Lewis On the same day, Washington wrote his sister saying he would throw no impediment in the way of their Marriage but he wished Harriot would wait. He had hoped she would make a better connexion. To accomplish this, he felt she would have plenty of opportunities when he came back home to retire. She could come up to Mount Vernon and meet a host of eligible young men for example, the son of the Marquis de Lafayette, who was then staying there. Since there was no F.B.I, or Price Waterhouse in those days to check the credentials of Andrew Parks, Washington asked some friends in Fredericksburg to look into the young man's background. He particularly wanted to know whether Parks was a native or a foreigner, and how substantial his business was. Nothing derogatory was turned up. Andrew came from a respectable middle-class family in Baltimore, and his inventory, though not enormous, was not shoddy. So the couple announced their plans, and Washington sent Harriot a present of money for her trousseau. The couple were married in July, and Harriot quickly reported to Washington: To George Washington from Betty Washington Lewis, 5 July 1796 My Dear Brother July 5th, 1796. I receiv'd your Letters of 26th and 29th of June, the day after I wrote to you I was attack with the ague and fever which has lasted ever since I had never been clear of a fever since, I Expected your comeing threw Baltemore that you would ascertain Mr. Parkes fortune thoe I believe he would not tell anything fals on the Occation, Harriot's Brother Wrote her a letter from Baltemore and likewise one to Mr. Parks congratulateing them on there Intended Union which he sayes he makes no dout will be a very happy one, Lawrence was here at the time that Mr. Parks firs spoke to Harriot on the subject and I beg'd of him to make all the inquire he could but never hard from him untill the letter I have mention'd here and concluded from that he had Inquired and was well Pleas'd, when Mr. Parks ask'd my consent I told him I had nothing to say to it that you ware the Person to be appli'd to, I have never concern'd myself with it I think Harriot is Old Enougf now to make choice for her self, and if they are not happy I believe it will be her one falt, he bars the Best caracter of any young Person that I know. I now my Dear Brother have to thank you for your good intention of sending me a mule if you had any to spear, but had no write to Expect you to Disfirnish your self. I am mutch obliged to you for your invitasion to Mount Vernon but it is utterly out of my Power to get up, I believe I wrote to you last fall that I had but two old Horses and in Tenn word left out from that my stable was broken open and the best of them carri'd of and from that day to this I have not har'd a word of him that was the forth charriot Hors that I lost in Fredericks you may Believe I had no great Parsiallity for the Place, Harriot is Better and is gone to the forth of July in Town but I think she looks badly. My Love to you and my Sister Washington concludes me your Affectionate sister Betty Lewis. P.S.âI fear you will hardly make out this as I have a violent Headake and a horrid caughâI believe Harriot is distressed to know how she is to be Provided with things for a Weding Dress. To George Washington from Harriot Washington, 17 July 1796 Mill Brook July 17-96 Aunt Lewis received a letter from my dear & Honored Uncle a few days ago wherein he was pleased to send me thirty pound also a great deal of good advice which I am extremely obliged to you for and intend adhering most strictly to it. Believe me, my dear Uncle, my heart will ever with the liveliest gratitude most gratefully acknowledge and remember yours and Aunt Washington's great goodness and attention to me and if my Uncle will only answer my letter and say he is not offended at my Union (which took place yesterday, Aunt Lewis's going immediately to Berkley to stay untill the fall &: finding it not convenient to carry me with her wished us married before she went), I shall be happy for after my dear Uncle's protection & kindness towards me I should be a most miserable being to reflect that I had displeas'd my greatest friend. I shall take the liberty of troubleing my Uncle to return my thanks to Aunt Washington for the earings she sent me from Philadelphia which I received but a week ago from Berkley. Aunt Lewis is much mended 8c intends answering your letter by the next post. Aunt Lewis joins me in love to you and Aunt Washington. I am my dear and Honor'd Uncle Your affectionate neice Harriot Parks After their marriage Andrew and Harriet visited George Washington. On September 4 and 8 1798 George Washington made the following entries in his diary: 4. Morng. Cloudy--Mer. at 69. Clear afterwards. Mer. 80 in the Aftern. & 74 at Night.

Jany. 1824 Dear Sir, While John Payne Todd Esqr. was at the French Seminary at Baltimore, he contracted an account with me in the Store I Kept there at the time. Soon after the articles were had, I left Balte., and moved to the Western CountryâSince which time, I have not had the pleasure to hear from Mr. Todd. I have herewith taken the liberty to inclose you the account, with a request, if it should not materially interfere with your convenience, to have it adjusted for me with Mr. Todd; who I am persuaded will recognize the items of the account, and pay me though it has been of so long standing. Permit me to ask the favour of you to write me on the subject of the a/c, and direct to me at the Kanawha Saline Post office. With sincere regards to Mrs. Madison I am Dear Sir very respectfully Yr. Obt. Servt. Andw Parks Andrew Parks to James Madison, 1 November 1826 Burning Spring 1st. Novr. 1826 Dear Sir, I have been for some time expecting to get a letter from Mr. J. P. Todd, on the subject of my little a/c against him, a copy of which I sent you. Since your letter to me; I met with Mr. Jno. Payne in Clarksburg, he stated that until you recd. my letter, you supposed Mr. Todd had been furnished with what clothes he wanted from the French Seminary. As it respects Mr. Todd, I think this was not the case; Mrs. Madison wrote to my wife, and requested her to pay attentions to her son, and see that he was supplied with such things as he stood in need of. For some time Mr. Todd was in the habit of buying such articles as he wanted out of my Store, and when he recd. money from Washington, he always Paid me. I am therefore under the persuasion, that he got scarcely any clothes from the Priests, except the Uniform of the Seminary. I left Balte. very soon after Mr. Todd got the articles in the a/c I sent you, which leads me to conclude is the reason the a/c was not paid by him as it was usual with him to do, upon his getting money from Washington. If Mr. Todd would do me the favor to send me the amt. of the a/c, it would be a very great accomodation to me, in my present circumstances. I regret to be, the occasion of giving you so much trouble about this matterâBe pleased to excuse it, for I assure you, were it not that I am in a straight for money, I should not think of plagueing you with the subject of an old a/c. With respects to Mrs. Madison I am Dr Sir very respectfully yr obt. Servt.

Huntington, New York, 1896-97 Samuel Putnam Avery (1822-1904) was an artist and art dealer. He was an original trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Donation by Collis P. Huntington: \"...In 1897 he gave to the Metropolitan Museum of Art a portrait of George Washington, painted by Charles Wilson Peale...\"\" See this this: Andrew Parks gets \"Fort Necessity\" in 1805 \"The site of this renowned fort is well known. Its ruins are yet, (1858), visible. It stands on Great Meadow run, which empties into the Youghiogheny. The \"Great Meadows,\" with which its name associates in history, was a large natural meadow or glade, now highly cultivated and improved. The place is now better known by the name of \"Mount Washington,\"on the National Road, ten miles east of Uniontown, Fayette county, the old fort being about three hundred years southward of the brick mansion or tavern house. In by-gone days thousands of travelers have stopped here, or rushed by, without a thought of its being or history; while a few have thrown a reverential glance upon the classic spot. Washington in all his after life, seems to have loved the place. As early as 1769 he acquired from Virginia a pre-emption right to the tract of land (234) acres, which includes the fort; the title to which was afterwards confirmed to him by Pennsylvania. It is referred to in his last will, and he owned it at his death. His executors sold it to Andrew Parks of Baltimore, whose wife, Harriet, was a relative and legatee \"of the General. She sold it to the late General Thomas Mason, who sold it to Joseph Huston, as whose property it was bought at sheriff's sale by Judge Ewing, who sold it to the late James Sampey, Esq., whose heirs have recently sold it to a Mr. Facenbaker. An ineffectual effort was made some years ago to erect a monument upon the site. The first battle ground of Washington surely deserves a worthier mark of commemoration than mouldering embankments surmounted by a few decaying bushes.\"\n\nAndrew Parks Born: 10 AUG 1773 at: Married: 4 JUL 1796 at: Richmond, Virginia Died: 1837 at: Kanawha Virgina (now West Virginia) Father: John (James) Parks Mother: Margaret Gibson from this: APPRAISEMENT OF THE ESTATE OF ANDREW PARKS In obedience to an Order of the Court of Kanawha County on the 11th day of July 1836 being first duly sworn we have proceeded to appraise the personal estate and slaves of Andrew Parks as shown to us by Samuel Shrewsbury and William Thompkins administrators this 6th day of August 1837 as follows Negro man Peter aged 20 years Negro woman Melty aged 48 given to Mrs. S Shrewsbury Negro child Benjamin 1 year given to Mrs. S Shewsbury Wife: Harriett Washington Born: 2 AUG 1776 at: Harewood, Stratford VA Died: ABT 1822 at: Kanawha, Salines County W VA Father:Samuel Washington Mother:Anne Steptoe CHILDREN OF ANDREW PARHS AND HARRIET WASHINGTON:\n\nName: Anne Eliza Parks -- 1st child of Andrew Parks and Harriet Washington Born: ABT 1797 at: Baltimore Married: at: Died: 1852 at: Malden WV Spouses:\n\nName: Laurence Augustine Parks -- 2nd child of Andrew Parks and Harriet Washington Born: ABT 1801 at: Baltimore MD Married: at: Died: 1822 at: Salines, Kanawha County, West Virginia Spouses:\n\nName: Bushrod Parks -- 3rd child of Andrew Parks and Harriet Washington Born: 1806 at: Married: at: Died: 1832 at: Louisiana Spouses:\n\nName: Laura Parks -- 4th child of Andrew Parks and Harriet Washington Born: 15 NOV 1809 at: Baltimore, Maryland Married: ABT 1828 at: Salines, Kanawha Co., Virginia Died: ABT 1885 at: Spouses: Samuel Shrewsbury son of John and Martha Dickinson Shrewsbury d Mar 24 1865 Children:\n\nAlbert Shrewsbury (1833 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha, VA-1877)\n\nHarriet Washington Shrewsbury (1840 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1876)\n\nMartha Dickinson Shrewsbury (1829 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1875) Married George Fitzhugh\n\nLaurence Washington Shrewsbury (1831 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1850 Klamath CA)\n\nAndrew Parks Shrewsbury (1836 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1920 NV)\n\nCornelia Shrewsbury (1840 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1918 San Francisco CA) Married Enoch Gans\n\nLaura Angela Shrewsbury (1842 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1877 Married Nicholas Fitxhugh\n\nSamuel Shrewsbury (1847 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1877 Independence MO)\n\nHenry Clay Shrewsbury (1853 in Shrewsbury, Kanawha VA-1882 WVA)\n\nName: Andrew Parks (Major) -- 5th child of Andrew Parks and Harriet Washington Born: 1811 at: Baltimore MD Married: ABT 1842 at: Charleston, Jefferson Co., West Virginia by Dr. James Brown Died: 27 JUN 1863 at: Charleston, Jefferson Co., West Virginia The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 8, pg 413 is \"List if Delegates to the Virginia Assembly from Kanawha County 1790-1863 1842 Andrew Parks 1847 Andrew Parks 1851 Major Andrew Parks\" \"During the War, Major Parks was arrested as a hostage, he having been a member of the seceding convention of his state whereupon a letter from him to Jefferson Davis was the means of his immediate release, because the other party was at once discharged on parole.\" This says Andrew Parks' roommate at Miami University was Joseph Davis (nephew of Jefferson Davis see this) He married in 1842 Margaret Davis Creed (b. 1823 in OH - died Charlestown WV June 9 1866) daughter of John Creed (1779 RI-1843 Faifield OH) and Margret Smith of Lancaster Ohio (see this).

Margaret Smith was the daughter of Benjamin Smith (1761-1812 Lancaster OH) and ELizabeth Cravens (bc 1762 Rockingham VA-1837 Lancaster). Benjamin's father was Captain Daniel Smith of Rockingham VA This says: \"Daniel Smith, husband of Jane Harrison, was indeed a Captain in the Augusta County Militia as of 1776....By 1776 Daniel Smith had obtained the rank of Captain in the Augusta County Militia and, in 1778, was a presiding justice for the newly formed Rockingham County court. The first sessions of the new Rockingham County Court were held in Daniel's home. By 1781 Daniel Smith had been promoted to the rank of Colonel of the militia, but he did not hold the post long. When the local troops returned from Yorktown in the fall of 1781, Colonel Daniel Smith was thrown from his horse and injured during the \"Grand Review\" held in Rockingham County to celebrate the victory. He died shortly thereafter from his injuries. He had lived in \"Smithland\", which was located just two miles below Harrisonburg in Rockingham County.\" Also see this See this Smith family history This).

Davis Parks to Abraham Lincoln, August 22, 1864 Charleston, Aug 22nd, 1864.\n\nRespected Sir\n\nUnder any circumstances but the existing one, I should feel that it was an unpardonable importunity, again to trouble you, after the very great kindness, so generously extended when I was in Washington.\n\nAfter receiving permission from your hands to see my children, I immediately proceeded to Camp Lookout,1 found them very comfortable, and received from them, a declaration, that they would reject an offer of exchange,\n\nBeing Northern myself by birth, and my children's family having bestowed the government of the United States upon the people, I could not feel it would detract in the least from thier position, to acknowledge thier allegiance,\n\nI returned returned home to Virginia happy under the illusion, that my Northern friends would make every effort to have them released,\n\nBut my happy home, and heart, was soon doomed to be darkened with sorrow; God in his wisdom saw fit, to remove my eldest son whilst being removed from Camp Lookout to Elmira Prison2, he lived but a few hours after the collision, the younger child had his arm broken and contusion of the breast.\n\nIt is for my younger, I now make my appeal; As Hagar was directed to the hidden spring in prayer; so am I directed to you.\n\nI ask for the release and restoration of my child, in the name of the Great-God who reigns o'er us all, and as you hope, and ask for mercy and happiness in your own household, so dispense it unto mine\n\nIf you reject me, God may see fit to soften your heart, by opening upon you, an unknown sorrow, within your own home.\n\nYou say he has erred, do you cease to remember, that both publickly and privately your prayers are rising as incense before the throne of God, asking and receiving pardon for your manifold sins.\n\nShould you see fit to reject me and my orphan, I shall still have the consolation that my heavenly Father directs all things aright; and he has promised to protect the Widow, and be a Father to the Orphan.\n\nNot only in my own name, but in that of Washington I make my request, as the Grand-son of Harriet Washington the much loved niece and adopted daughter of the great Patriot therefore the same blood flowing in his vains. I feel he should have the consideration of the representative of the people of this union.\n\nHis extreme youth and surroundings, are sufficient apolagy for his derelictions.\n\nShould you grant my request, my prayer morning, noon, and night, shall be, that the gentle blessings of heaven, may descend upon your wife and children, and to yourself:\n\nMay those favors so graciously bestowed upon others, be returned unto you ten fold.\n\nWith very great regard.\n\nM. Davis. Parks.\n\nP. S In case you regard with compassion my request, I enclose my son's address.\n\nBushrod, Washington, Parks. Ward 14. Barracks 3. Prisoner's Camp. Elmira. N.

They were in the 22nd Virginia Infantry Regiment, \"1st Kanawha Regiment\" commanded by Col. George S. PAtton (grandfather of World War II general George S Patton). At Cold Harbor, the 22nd VA was part of Echol's brigade of Breckenridge's Division. (22nd VA Regiment, 23rd VA Battalion, 26th VA Battalion). See this map. You will notice \"Patton\" on the map next to the 22nd VA. The Union lines broke the confederate line at the space between the 26th and 22nd VA units (the blue arrow crosses the red confederate line). This was done by Brooke's 4th Brigade of Barlow's First Division of Winfield' Scott's II Corps (7 NY Heavy Artillery, 148 PA, 53 PA, 2 DE, 64 NY, 66 NY). This occurred east of the McGhee House. See this photo; this photo; and this photo of Elimira Prison where Bushrod Washington Parks spent a year in prison (June 1864 - June 1865). This says Bushrod b 1846 died 1940 married Mary Davis. There is an ancestry.com marriage record in Newton County Missouri: \"Miss Mary Davis 30 Jan 1871 Newton County Missouri Spouse Mr. B W Parks\" [www.ancestry.com Missouri Marriage Records 1805-2002 orginal from Missouri State Archives] The entire text reads: \"Certificate of Marriage State of Missouri County of Newton This is to certify that on the 30th day of January AD 1871 Mr B W Parks and wife Mary Davis were by me United in marriage according to Laws of God and the State of Missouri at Hickory Creek Furnace Newton County Missouri Wm.

The connection between this family is the marriage of Margret Creed Parks (1893-1973) to Robert William Lowe. Margaret Creed Parks was the daughter of Andrew J Parks (1852-1928) brother of Bushrod Washington Parks.] Bushrod's data is VERY limited. It is common to find his death date as 1940 -- but it is often recorded as in Neshoho, Missouri (Newton County). We will refute this data below. I found a death record for \"Washington B. Parks\" in Rock Island County, Illinois March 21 1940 in the Illinois Death Index -- likely the source for this death date often seen on web records for Bushrod and then this at LDS: Washington B.

The father (William W Turner) died in Fayette IL in 1898. His wife Elizabeth then remarries John H. B. Smith in 1901: \"John H. B.

Dial and wife Mary E and \"mother-in-law\" Elizabeth Turner. Mary E. (Turner) Dial dies in 1907 and her children (Iva Jane and Eva Mae move in with their grandmother -- the widowed Elizabeth Turner. There is a death certificate for Elizabeth Smith in Altamont Effingham IL dated 7/7/1923? At the LDS there is an Ohio Birth for Mary \"Tarner\" of William W. \"Tarner\" and \"Elizabeth Tarner\" in Killbuck, Holmes County OH 13 July 1869). Holmes County is adjacent to both Coshocton and Muskingum where William appears on censuses. It appears that based on this birthplace for Elizabeth,and the censuses below that Elizabeth's father is Isaac Carpenter (1827-1899 Holmes OH). This rootsweb.com entry says: Isaac Carpenter b May 5 1827 in Ohio This says he was married three times: 1. Mary McDowell on Dec 20 1849 2. Elizabeth Fischer on March 24 1855 3. Celestia Neal on Nov 5 1870 The 1850 census (below) shows wife Isaac's wife as Mary and the 1860 census (below) shows wife as Elizabeth. So these multiple marriages seem correct. Thus Elizabeth Carpenter who married William W. Turner mother is Mary McDowell and her father is Isaac Carpenter. This says Mary McDowell's father is: James McDowell m. Elizabeth Patterson in Washington County PA (Mary's 1850 birthplace is listed as \"Penn\".

IRE (ANTRIM) Mother: Margaret Marriage 1 Elizabeth Parks b: 1770 in Hagarstown, MD From The Architecture of Baltimore: an Illustrated History by Mary Ellen Hayward and Frank R. Shivers, page 56:\n\n\"In Baltimore the first grand rows were built by enterprising merchants who sought people like themselves as tenants. In 1796 two prominent flour merchants Cumberland Duggan and Thomas McElderry erected expensive and impressive three and a half story rows facing each other on their respective, neighboring wharves which extended some sixteen hundred feet into the harbor. With London's Adelphi Terrace as a model the leased commercial space at the wharf level and rented commodius living quarters above. The group of houses merited enough attention to be included as one of the two architectural details found on Warner and Hannah's contemporary (1801) map of the city\"\n\nThese two projects are named in The Baltimore Rowhouse by Mary Ellen Hayward and Charles Belfoure as: \"...wharves extending south from Market Place (the site of Centre Market and the commercial hub of the town)...Dugan and McElderyy also built fancy mixed use rows just north of the wharves on either side of Market Place. \"St.Patrick's Row\" McElderry's project, was occupied initially by a ships chandler, merchants, a cabinet maker, and a gentelwoman In the \"Papers of the War Department 1784-1800\" Date April 11, 1796 Author Name: Thomas McElderry (primary) Location: Baltimore Recipient Name: James McHenry (primary) Location: Philadelphia Summary: Appears to be vouching for the character of a young man [Mr. Parks?] McElderry took under his instruction and protection after the man's father fell on hard times; believes the young man to now be a good businessman and a good potential husband, compared to many [other?] young Virginia gentlemen who have large estates and many slaves. The man has been practicing business [perhaps opening a store] in Fredericksburg, VA, since 1792; admits that a precise assessment of the man's net worth cannot be made at present. The vouching for character seems to be in regard to a proposed matchmaking. Mentions acquaintances, including one who is discriminated against for being Irish. [What any of this has to do with McHenry, or his office as Secretary of War, is unclear].
