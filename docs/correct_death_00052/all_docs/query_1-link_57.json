        "text": "When visiting Nashville, Tennessee, one of the more popular tourist attractions are guided tours of the stars’ homes. In the good old days, you used to be able to find a free map at a gas station, and drive the tour yourself. These days, they’ve figured out a way to make several bucks off it. You get a comfy bus ride, a knowledgeable guide, and even digital images of each house. That’s just not my style. For one thing, I’m not even a country music fan, so I really don’t care what kind of mansion Garth Brooks has, or where Alan Jackson chooses to rest his giant cowboy hat.\n\nI’m not a complete monster, however. I do recognize the years of entertainment many of these folks have provided. So I choose to honor them by visiting their final resting places. There are a lot of cemeteries around the Nashville area. Far more than I could cover. So I left out a lot of graves I wanted to visit. There are a couple of non-musicians mixed in here for flavor.\n\nI’ve posted a lot of videos of the artists performing. Even if you’re not a big country fan, I hope you listen to a few of them, and find some songs you like.\n\nHarpeth Hills Memory Gardens\n\nWe are going to start our tour at the cemetery furthest away from Nashville. Harpeth Hills is a nice 20-minute drive outside of town. You really feel away from everything here. It’s quite a nice location, just down the road from the famous Loveless Cafe.\n\nChet Atkins\n\nChet is known as “Mr. Guitar” and is considered the most recorded solo instrumentalist of all time. He built RCA Studio B where many of Elvis’ greatest hits were recorded, often with Atkins on guitar. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1973, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nRalph Emery\n\nThis one was actually a request, and it’s a good thing it was requested, as Mr. Emery is not listed on Find A Grave as a famous name.\n\nRalph Emery was a long time DJ and made the transition to television quite successfully. He was compared favorably to Dick Clark with his ability to highlight and promote fresh talent. I remember him most from Nashville Now! on The Nashville Network from 1983-1993. Emery passed away in January of 2022 at the age of 88.\n\nCharlie and Ira Louvin\n\nThe Louvin Brothers were a bluegrass/country/gospel duo that gained success in the 1950’s and early 60’s. For those of us today in the internet age, the Louvin Brothers are probably best known for the cover of their 1959 album Satan Is Real which is a mainstay on “Weird/Bad Album Cover” lists.\n\nDespite writing songs based in their strict Baptist religious beliefs, it turns out Ira was a raging alcoholic, and abusive to his wives. His third wife shot him in the chest four times. He survived that, but could not survive a car crash in 1965 with his 4th wife. In a cruel bit of irony, they were hit head-on by a drunk driver and killed instantly. At the time of the accident, Ira had a warrant for his arrest on DUI charges. Charlie continued on as a solo artist. He passed away in 2011 from pancreatic cancer.\n\nDonna Summer\n\nOne of these names is not like the others…\n\nDonna Summer is known as the “Queen of Disco”. She had three #1 albums and sixteen #1 songs on the dance charts. She sold in excess of 140 million copies of her albums over the years. She married songwriter and producer Bruce Sudano in 1980. Her headstone is behind the gate pictured above, and the bushes were very prickly, so I could not get any closer.\n\nSummer died from lung cancer. She attributed it to inhaling smoke from the 9/11 attacks, as she lived near the twin towers. Most people suggest it was the fact she smoked when she was younger and performed in smoky clubs her entire career.\n\nReggie Roby\n\nOne of the few non-musicians I came across in my travels. Reggie Roby was a longtime punter for the Miami Dolphins and later in his career he bounced around to several other teams. One thing I always remember is that he punted while wearing a watch (said to be a Rolex) because he wanted to keep track of the hangtime on his punts. He was named to the All-Decade team in the 1980’s as a punter. Sadly, Roby passed away suddenly of what was believed to be a heart attack at the age of 43 in 2005.\n\nMt. Hope Cemetery – Franklin\n\nMinnie Pearl\n\nAny chance I get to use this picture…\n\nMinnie Pearl was born Sarah Ophelia Colley in 1912. She was the youngest of five girls. Unlike her comedy persona, she grew up fairly well off. Her father was a well-off sawmill owner. She graduated from (now) Belmont University with a degree in theater, and taught dance for a few years after school.\n\nHer act was a satirical look at hillbilly culture and the residents of her hometown of Centerville, Tennessee. She appeared at the Grand Old Opry for over 50 years, was a star of the country themed sketch comedy tv show Hee-Haw, and had a recurring skit on Nashville Now! She married Henry Cannon in 1947. They eventually lived in a mansion next door to the Tennessee Governor.\n\nIn later life, Pearl battled breast cancer. The Sarah Cannon Cancer Centers and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute were named in her honor. In 1991, she suffered a massive stroke that ended her performing career. In 1996, a complications of another stroke led to her death at the age of 86.\n\nWoodlawn-Roesch-Patton Funeral Home & Woodlawn Memorial Park\n\nGeorge Jones\n\nOne of the comments I always get when I make these types of posts is “I always thought their headstone would be bigger.” That’s not an issue when it comes to The Possum, George Jones. Jones’ life and career could fill many books and be the subject of twice as many movies. He was famously married to Tammy Wynette for a number of years. They performed together and had a string of hits. His alcoholism and drug use led to their divorce, but not to their string of hits.\n\nJones died in 2013 at the age of 81. I’m still trying to figure out if using “He Stopped Loving Her Today”, the title of one of his best known songs, is just a reference point, or one of the best headstone jokes of all time.\n\nJohnny Paycheck\n\nJust 20-30 feet away from George is a real bad boy of country music. Johnny Paycheck had a successful career that started as a backing member of George Jones’ backing band. A name change, and a stylistic shift into the “Outlaw Country” genre led to his greatest success with the 1977 song “Take This Job and Shove It”.\n\nPaycheck probably lived the outlaw life a little too closely. In 1985, he was arrested for shooting a man in a bar in little Hillsboro, Ohio. He only ended up spending 22 months in jail for that. Health issues brought his public appearances to an end in 2000. He died in Vanderbilt Hospital in 2003. George Jones donated the plot Paycheck is buried in.\n\nRob Bironas\n\nThis plaque may have the best inspirational quote of all time.\n\nRob Bironas played his entire 9 year NFL career with the Tennessee Titans. He was an accomplished place kicker and punter. He led the Titans in scoring two times. In June of 2014 he married Terry Bradshaw’s daughter. In September of the same year, Bironas was driving he GMC Denali recklessly and flipped his car several times and hit several trees. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital with a blood-alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit.\n\nBironas is also buried in the Jones family section.\n\nDan Seals\n\nDan Seals’ music career started in the 1970’s as one half of the duo England Dan & John Ford Coley. As a side note, England Dan was not from England. As a child he was just really into The Beatles, and even affected a British accent for a while. England Dan & John Ford Coley had a #2 hit with the AM Radio classic “I’d Really Love To See You Tonight.”\n\nTo answer a question that’s come up more than once… Dan’s brother Jim was the Seals in Seals & Croft.\n\nBonus: Wolfman Jack sighting!!\n\nAfter the duo broke up in 1980, Seals reimagined himself as a solo country artist. Between 1983 and 1990 he had a run of 16 song that at least made the top ten country charts, many of them made #1. In 1986, he won Single of the Year at the Country Music Association awards, and had his first solo #1 song with a song that had heavy rotation in our car’s cassette player – “Bop”.\n\nSadly, Seals passed away after a bout with a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma . He was 61 years old.\n\nDobie Gray\n\nDobie’s claim to fame is right there on his headstone. He sang the 1973 song “Drift Away” which made the top 10 twice. Once upon it’s release in 1973 (#5), and again in 2003 when Uncle Kracker and Grey collaborated on a version of the song (#9).\n\nMy favorite random fact about Gray is that in 1970, after years of struggling to make it as an artist, he joined a band called Pollution. Pollution’s manager was Max Baer Jr. aka Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\n(for those curious, the link burned in the lower corner of this video leads to a guy’s blog where he mostly posts old r&b performances)\n\nGray passed away in 2011 from complications after cancer surgery.\n\nPorter Wagoner\n\nFor someone that says he’s not a country music fan, I have spent a lot of time watching country music television shows. One that I found myself watching quite often growing up was the Porter Wagoner Show. It was a classic variety show with comedy sketches and a lot of performances from country legends early in their careers. Wagoner famously introduced the world to Dolly Parton in 1967. The pair recorded a number of albums together and had a long string of hits.\n\nWagoner was well known for wearing suits designed by Nudie Cohn. The suits were often covered in sparkly wagon wheels.\n\nLarrie London\n\nI will freely admit that I have never heard the name Larrie London before I got lost in the cemetery and literally stumbled across his headstone. Judging by the names on this list, I’ve definitely heard his drum playing.\n\nMarty Robbins\n\nWho I was actually looking for when I discovered Mr. London. As a young kid, I mainly remembered Robbins’ name from a commercial hawking 30 top country hits by K-Tel. I was only 7 years old when Robbins died, but I actually remember where I was when I heard about his death. On the local tv on Saturday mornings, right after cartoons, they used to show local Putt-Putt tournaments. I would always watch them. One time during a tournament, they went to show the same K-Tel commercial, but there was a new screen before the commercial dedicating it to the memory of Marty Robbins.\n\nRobbins music is considered more Western than tradition Country. His song “El Paso” made it to #1 on the pop charts. Later on, Robbins recorded both prequel AND sequel songs to “El Paso”. He recorded over 500 songs, and even finished in the top 10 of six NASCAR races in the 1970’s. He ran his last race about a month before his death in 1982. He had heart disease from a young age, and died after his third heart attack and quadruple-bypass surgery.\n\nWebb Pierce\n\nPierce was a honky-tonk singer who had his biggest success in the 1950’s. His first hit “Wondering”, memorialized here on his headstone, spent 27 weeks on the charts – 4 of those at #1. His biggest hit was “In the Jailhouse Now” spending a staggering 21 consecutive weeks at #1.\n\nPierce was a flamboyant person. He was another fan of the Nudie Cohn suits, and had silver-dollar lined convertibles. At one time he built a guitar-shaped swimming pool at his Nashville home, and charged admission for the public to use it. He was eventually sued by his neighbor (country music comedian Ray “The Streak” Stevens) to stop the public usage of the pool.\n\nPierce died of pancreatic cancer in 1991 at the age of 69.\n\nWe are now going to head into the very modern looking Cross Mausoleum to visit more celebrities. I honestly felt a bit weird walking in as there were people there in the entryway for a scheduled meeting about their grandmother’s funeral (I had a similar situation happen at the Funeral Museum in Dover, Ohio)…and here I am just for the tourism factor. I will say the woman that gave me directions was super nice, and prepared for people like me. They had a printed out map ready to go. So I headed up to the 3rd floor (where literally all the celebrities were interred) and set out to searching.\n\nLittle Jimmie Dickens\n\nIt didn’t take very long to find the first spot, as there was a small statue of Dickens standing out in the hallway.\n\nAgain, I’m going to plead ignorance here. I knew NOTHING in Dickens’ music. The only thing I remember was as a kid, we took a family trip to Nashville, and were doing one of these celebrity house tours when my mom exclaimed “There’s Little Jimmy Dickens’ house!” and I remember just seeing a big gate with music notes on it.\n\nLittle Jimmy Dickens lived up to his name, standing only 4’11”. He was known for adding a bit of comedy into his songs. His biggest hit was “May The Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose”. Dickens passed away at 94 years of age due to complications after a stroke and a heart attack.\n\nNote the cameo on guitar by Porter Wagoner.\n\nDottie Rambo\n\nIn the same hall as Dickens is this Grammy Award winning gospel artist. In her career, she wrote and recorded over 2,500 songs. Everyone from Whitney Houston to Carol Channing has recorded her songs. On her way to a Mother’s Day concert in Texas, her tour bus ran off the road and crashed into a guardrail. Rambo was the only one killed in the crash.\n\nJim Ed Brown\n\nJim Ed Brown performed in the 1950’s in a trio with his sisters not so creatively named “The Browns”. They had a #1 hit with their song “The Three Bells”.\n\nJim Ed had a string of hits as a solo artist, and then a string of duets with Helen Cornelius in the 1970’s. In the 1980’s he had two shows in The Nashville Network. One was a Star Search-type show and the other had him and his wife traveling the country by RV.\n\nBrown announced in 2014 that he had lung cancer. He temporarily left hosting his weekly radio show. In early 2015 he announced he was in remission and started doing the radio show again. However, on June 3, 2015, he said the cancer was back and he passed away a week later. He was 81.\n\nGuy and Lillie Mae Tomlin\n\nThese two aren’t famous themselves, but their daughter Lily is.\n\nH. Gordon Stoker\n\nAgain, this was not a name I was actively searching for, but two things made me take notice of this niche.\n\nFirst thing were the music notes. The second was the picture with a very young Elvis Presley. It turns out Stoker was a member of The Jordanaires. They started off as a gospel group in the late 1940’s. In the 50’s they became Elvis Presley’s backing singers. While the group had a number of members over the years, once Stoker died, they officially dissolved the group.\n\nFelice and Boudleaux Bryant\n\nFelice and Boudleaux were a successful songwriting team. They wrote many of the Everly Brothers big hits; “Bye Bye Love” and “Wake Up Little Suzie” being the two most notable. They wrote “Love Hurts” which, while originally a hit for Gram Parsons with Emmylou Harris, got far wider acclaim in 1974 from the band “Nazareth”.\n\nTo be honest though, nothing compares to what is undoubtedly their most famous song… “Rocky Top”. Performed here by the first (but nowhere near the last) band to record it, The Osborne Brothers.\n\nOtis Blackwell\n\nConsidered one of the great R&B songwriters in the 1950’s and 60’s, Blackwell write such classics as “Great Balls of Fire”, “Don’t Be Cruel”, “All Shook Up”, and “Return to Sender”. Blackwell wrote over 1,000 songs in his career. In an interview he said he never met Elvis, despite writing several of his biggest hits.\n\nIn the 1980’s Blackwell became a member of The Smithereens’ backing band. This partnership led to him making two more albums.\n\nVan Stephenson\n\nVan Stephenson was 1/3 of the bank Blackhawk, which had a number of hits in the 1990’s. Their debut album went double platinum. Stephenson was with the band until their fourth album, when a diagnosis of skin cancer caused him to retire from the band. Stephenson died of cancer in 2001 at the age of 47.\n\nLynn and Liz Anderson\n\nLiz Anderson was a very successful songwriter in the 1950’s and 60’s. She wrote many of Merle Haggard’s early hits. He even named his backing band “The Fugitives” as a tribute to the song she wrote that became a #1 hit in 1966. She had a fairly successful singing career as well. She received a Grammy Nomination for her top 5 single “Mamma Spank” in 1967\n\n… which was the same year Liz’s daughter Lynn had a top 5 hit with “If I Kiss You”…a song written by Liz.\n\nLynn Anderson gained notoriety as a performer on the Lawrence Welk show in the late 1960’s. Her breakout performance was with the classic “(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden”.\n\nTammy Wynette\n\nYou could say her final resting place is one of the more popular ones here, if the number of cards and drawings left here are any indictation.\n\nOf course, her signature song was “Stand By Your Man”, a song that has made Rolling Stone’s Top 500 songs of all-time list. It was rated as the best country song of all-time by CMT. The Jordanaires (who we met earlier) sang backup on the song. It spent 3 weeks at #1 on the country chart and made it to #19 on the pop chart. As was mentioned earlier, Wynette had a tumultuous marriage to George Jones. While not being healthy emotionally, it was a successful pairing artistically.\n\nBonus: Johnny Cash sighting!\n\nWynette died at the age of 55 in 1998. Her manner of death came under scrutiny after her will “vanished” in the days after her death, and her 4th husband and his son got large payouts while her children didn’t get anything that had been promised to them in the will. Her body was exhumed and an autopsy was done that showed she died of an irregular heartbeat. While there were lawsuits filed, all of the issues were quietly resolved in private.\n\nAnother strange post-death note about Wynette; some time after her 5th and final husband, George Richey died in 2010, her name was removed from her niche and replaced with “Virginia W. Richardson” which was her married name (as Richardson was Richey birth name). A court order in 2014 was required to return the markings to her more famous moniker.\n\nOriginally Richey was buried in the unmarked spot directly above her, however, it is suggested that he has been removed from the mausoleum altogether and reinterred elsewhere on the grounds.\n\nIn the early 1990’s she made a wild genre change and did a wonderful remix song called “Justified and Ancient (Stand By The JAMs)” with The KLF. It is said she had trouble keeping up with the tempo of the music, so her vocals were pieced together from the on beat takes.\n\nK.T. Oslin\n\nDirectly below Wynette is the resting place for K.T. Oslin.\n\nK.T. Oslin is the story of a 20-year overnight success. She started on Broadway is “Hello, Dolly” in the mid-1960’s. It took until the mid 1980’s for her to get her first recording contract at the age of 45. He big breakout hit was called “80’s Ladies”. It won the Grammy in 1987. She followed up the next year with a Grammy win for “Hold Me”.\n\nOslin suffered from frequent bouts of depression, and often took long hiatuses between performing and recording. She had quadruple-bypass surgery in 1995. In 2015, she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. She passed away in December, 2020, a week after contracting COVID-19.\n\nJerry Reed\n\nLast, but not least, in this spacious mausoleum, you’d be forgiven for overlooking Reed’s spot of you didn’t know that Reed was his middle name.\n\nReed’s career intersects many on this list. Most notably his first songwriting hit was a song for Porter Wagoner, and he won two Grammy Awards doing albums with Chet Atkins. Many of Reed’s songs were humorous in nature. Elvis was a big fan and recorded several of Reed’s songs. Sometimes having more success with them than Reed himself had.\n\nWe all know why we’re here though… SING IT, SNOWMAN!!\n\nReed passed away from emphysema at the age of 71.\n\nHendersonville Memory Gardens\n\nOur final stop on our trip. The only disappointing this about this trip was that there were several other graves I wanted to visit, but they were just too far out of the way, or it was getting dark early (stupid axial tilt). Anyway, I could not excuse myself if I didn’t get to this one before we left the area altogether.\n\nFerlin Husky\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the D-Day badge on his headstone. According to his Wikipedia page, Husky was a part of the Merchant Marines and the ship he was on was part of the invasion of Cherbourg.\n\nHusky’s musical career boasted a dozen top 10 Country hits including his signature song “On the Wings of a Dove”.\n\nI know Husky best for his role in a cheesy little horror/comedy/musical movie called “Hillbillies in a Haunted House”. Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney Jr., and John Carradine star in the movie. It’s a 80-minute movie where the story wraps up in 60 minutes (there are 2-3 full-length songs in that time as well), the last 20 minutes is just an awkwardly staged country music concert. The concert footage is notable for being one of Merle Haggard’s first recorded performances.\n\nThe whole movie is available for free on Youtube…so enjoy!\n\nMerle Kilgore\n\nMerle Kilgore was a songwriter. His most notable work was writing “Ring of Fire” for Anita Carter. It was later recorded by her sister June’s future husband, Johnny Cash.\n\nKilgore was the best man at Cash and Carter’s wedding. Which makes sense why he’s buried so close to them.\n\nMaybelle Carter\n\n“The First Lady of Country Music”, Maybelle Carter, her husband Ezra (stupid me didn’t get a picture of his headstone…and it’s literally touching hers), and their three daughters performed as The Carter Family. Eventrually, Ezra stepped away and Mother Maybelle and The Carter Sisters continued to make music. Their group picked up Chet Atkins and joined the Grand Old Opry in 1950.\n\nJohnny and June Carter Cash\n\nJune Carter was already a member of the Grand Old Opry when Johnny began his musical career. In the early 1960’s, the Carter Sisters would often find themselves on the same lineups as Johnny. In 1967 June Carter and Johnny Cash recorded a duet called “Jackson” that reached #2 on the country charts, and won the pair a Grammy Award. The next year the couple got married.\n\nIt’s pretty much impossible to boil Cash’s career and influence down into just a few lines in a blog post. So let’s just watch a couple videos from different points of his career.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn’t add in a performance of one of the greatest songs to ever be recorded. The Highwaymen was a country supergroup of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson.\n\nWe end with the final video Cash recorded. Released just 5 months before June passed away at the age of 73, and 11 months before Cash died at 71 years of age. His cover of Nine Inch Nails’ “Hurt”.\n\nAn amazing video that just scratches the surface of a pair of amazing entertainers.\n\nWith that, we end our whirlwind tour of Nashville. This year didn’t quite go as planned, but that’s ok. The winter is probably going to be kind of quiet, but I assure you, I’m always looking for my next destination. If you actually read this far. Thank you."
