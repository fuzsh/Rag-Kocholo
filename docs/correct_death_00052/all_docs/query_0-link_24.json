Gen. Andrew Jackson (see the attached letter from Jackson to George Brandon). George married his first cousin, Sidney McGuire, in North Carolina in 1797 and moved to Rutherford county, Tennessee, where they raised a large family. George lived in or near Readyville, and he helped Charles Ready build a mill there.\n\nFrom Find A Grave\n\nGeorge was the son of the Christopher Brandon who died in present-day Davie County, NC in 1806 (Rowan County, at that time). Christopher was married twice, the first time likely in PA where his first children were born, namely this son,George, and a daughter, Sibella.\n\nLater, Christopher and his children migrated to Rowan County, NC to join his brothers and sisters who had settled there in the late 1760's with their father, also named George. Christopher remarried in Rowan County, signaling the death of his first wife, this George's mother. It is unknown if she died in PA, triggering the family's move to NC, or if she died on route to NC or after arriving there.\n\n[This] George married his first cousin, Sidney McGuire, on 24 Jan 1797 in Rowan County, NC. Sidney was the daughter of Mary Brandon McGuire and John McGuire who married in Rowan County, NC on 16 Mar 1767. George's father, Christopher, and Mary Brandon McGuire, were brother and sister. Christopher and Mary also had a sister, Sidney Brandon Withrow, wife of Capt. James Withrow who served as a Patriot in the American Revolutionary War. George's wife, Sidney McGuire Brandon, was a namesake of her mother's sister.\n\nDescendants of George and Sidney McGuire Brandon attribute the following information to the family:\n\nGeorge Brandon: b. 02 Aug 1770, PA; d. 12 May 1844, Rutherford County, TN\n\nSidney McGuire Brandon: b. 30 Nov 1774, Rowan County, NC; d. 22 Feb 1819, Rutherford Co., TN\n\nChildren:\n\n1.
