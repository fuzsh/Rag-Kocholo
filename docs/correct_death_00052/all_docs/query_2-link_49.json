Plans for the revitalized building span vertically across five levels and will feature a different concept on each floor including:\n\nDraftKings Sports & Social: The space will be highlighted by several LED media walls and signature bars that will allow guests to watch multiple games and sporting events at once. Guests can expect a full menu of elevated food items as well as a carefully crafted beverage menu featuring specialty cocktails and Sports & Social’s signature Crush drink. Game days will feature an electric environment with elements such as live fan-cams and industry-leading music and light effects. Eligible guests will enjoy DraftKings’ guest-friendly mobile platforms to place bets using the DraftKings Sportsbook app, along with playing daily fantasy sports from their mobile devices across various sports, including football, basketball, baseball, golf, MMA, soccer, tennis and more, all while watching multiple games live.\n\nPBR Cowboy Bar: This will be a flagship location for PBR with the Nashville Stampede, one of eight teams in a new bull riding league, as one of their signature team cities. PBR Cowboy Bar will feature a professionally endorsed mechanical riding bull, multiple signature bars, private VIP booths, DJ entertainment, and live music.\n\nAVA Rooftop Bar: An elevated rooftop venue, with unobstructed views of The Cumberland River, Nissan Stadium, and Downtown Nashville. Lined with lush greenery, expansive lounge-style seating, and dazzling lights, the Mediterranean-inspired oasis will offer a lively atmosphere with DJs and live music.\n\nThe Gallery: A 10,000-square-foot private event space with room to host up to 450 people\n\nA Speakeasy Bar"
