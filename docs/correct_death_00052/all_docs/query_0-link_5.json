        "text": "Fairfax, VA (February 26, 2013) — “Don’t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,” the second single from Jeffrey Osborne’s new hit album A Time For Love, will be released to radio stations nationwide on March 11th. Producer George Duke reinterprets the James Taylor classic into a sophisticated jazz and R&B tinged love song, inspiring Osborne to transform it into an entirely new sound. A Time For Lovewas released on January 29th, held the #1 spot on Billboard magazine’s Current Contemporary Jazz Chart for two weeks in a row, and remains at #2 this week.\n\nAlthough A Time For Love was conceptualized to be Osborne’s first-ever jazz album, he and Duke both loved the idea of reinventing the pop song “Don’t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight” into a standard, with a bit of an homage to Osborne’s R&B past. “We made sure it fits within what’s going on with this project,” he explains. “It just has a little groove to it that puts it in both worlds. This is the only song on the album that George played an old Wurlitzer on and it just has a great feel to it.” Jazz artists Christian McBride, John Roberts, Paul Jackson, Jr and Lenny Castro also appear on the track.\n\nA Time For Love reunites the Grammy-nominated vocalist with one of the greatest jazz and R&B producers of all time to create a collection of beloved songs updated with innovative arrangements and Osborne’s signature baritone. It is the first album the duo has recorded together since they ruled the charts in the ‘80s with Jeffrey’s first three solo albums. “When I finally got the opportunity to make this album, I knew there was no one else I would want to do this with other than George,” explains Osborne.\n\nThe album features a trio of top jazz musicians Christian McBride on bass, John Roberts on drums and Duke himself on keyboards. Saxophonists Everette Harp, Kamasi Washington, guitarist Paul Jackson, and Rick Braun on trumpet make special guest appearances. And the incomparable Chaka Khan lends her vocals to the album’s sassy rendition of “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.”\n\nNashville, TN (February 26, 2013) – The mega-stars continue to lineup for George Jones’ final concert, which is set for Friday, November 22, 2013 at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena.

In this rare, personal, and intimate interview Dolly Parton covered topics ranging from growing up poor in the Smoky Mountains as the 4th of 12 children, reminiscing about her family’s use of “mountain medicine” and the death of her baby brother. Personal stories and anecdotes include the chicken that stole the nipple and “borrowing” her grandmother’s false teeth to her philanthropy and involvement in literacy programs (which have provided over 40 million books to date). Dolly also discusses the death of Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson, and the perils of fame.\n\n“It is always great to be nominated for anything. I remember doing The Dr. Steve Show and I was thinking at the time ‘I have enjoyed doing this as much, if not more than any show I have done in years and years.’ So, I was excited to be nominated for this particular show. So thanks, and wish me luck!”\n\nExecutive Producer David Brown said, “Dolly is an American treasure and her life story, her “coat of many colors” is part of the American fabric. As both a fan and a producer I wanted to bring to our audience a side of Dolly they may not have known and also pay homage to the people of the great Smoky Mountains and their fortitude. Researching, writing, and producing this particular show was a pleasure as I wanted to give back to Dolly a part of the joy she had given me and my family as a performer over the years. To know that she herself was so pleased with the outcome is truly a high point of my career.”\n\nNashville, TN (February 19, 2013) – Montgomery Gentry, Kenny Rogers, Josh Turner, and Dierks Bentley are the latest additions to the ever-growing list of talent set to take stage for the final Nashville concert of George Jones’ career.

It’s been a wonderful journey from my childhood in Hazel and I’ve always kept a piece of Kentucky in my songs as well as in my heart,” said DeShannon.\n\nSinger-songwriter Jackie DeShannon is the soulful voice behind two enduring 1960s anthems — Burt Bacharach & Hal David’s “What The World Needs Now Is Love” and DeShannon’s own “Put A Little Love In Your Heart.” Beyond those standards is an artist who has created a body of work covering a diverse range of genres including rock, folk, R&B, country, gospel, reggae and jazz. Her songs have been performed by Brenda Lee, The Byrds, Marianne Faithfull, Al Green, Annie Lennox, The Searchers, Pam Tillis, The Carpenters, Kim Carnes, The Temptations, Rick Nelson, Cher, Van Morrison, Ella Fitzgerald, Dolly Parton, Irma Thomas, Bruce Springsteen and dozens more.\n\nBorn in Kentucky, Jackie started her career on live radio while in her teens. Her earliest recordings were rooted in rockabilly, such as her Buddy Holly tribute composition, “Buddy.” Jackie wrote dozens of songs with Sharon Sheeley (“Dum Dum,” “The Great Imposter,” “Breakaway”). Collaborations followed with Randy Newman, Jack Nitzsche and Jimmy Page. In 1964, Jackie toured as an opening act for The Beatles across the United States. Writing solo, she composed the hits “When You Walk In The Room” (covered by The Searchers) and “Come And Stay With Me” (given to Marianne Faithfull).\n\nIn the 1960s, Jackie also travelled to London to write and record with Jimmy Page at Abbey Road Studios. She also appeared on the famed “Ready, Steady, Go!” pop music show and subsequently returned to England to record additional songs with Burt Bacharach and Hal David producing, following the success of “What The World Needs Now Is Love.” (Jackie’s recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.)\n\nHer rising popularity brought Jackie to television, where she regularly performed on the legendary “Shindig!” and “Hollywood A-Go-Go” programs in addition to guest appearances on music-variety series with Glen Campbell, Andy Williams, The Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash, Burt Bacharach and many others. During this time, Jackie also enjoyed a mini-acting career, starring in the motion pictures “C’mon Let’s Live A Little” (with fellow rocker Bobby Vee), “Surf Party” (with balladeer Bobby Vinton) and “Intimacy,” while also appearing on television series such as “The Wild, Wild West” and “My Three Sons.”\n\nJackie earned a million-seller in 1969 with “Put A Little Love In Your Heart,” (which was also a UK hit for The Dave Clark Five) written with her brother Randy Myers and Jimmy Holiday. Subsequent writing partners include Van Morrison, John Bettis and Donna Weiss, with whom Jackie earned a 1982 Grammy for Song of the Year with “Bette Davis Eyes.” In 2010, she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame. Most recently, she was the honoree of a retrospective tribute at the Grammy Museum in January, 2012.\n\nJackie has just released her latest album, WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM (Rock Beat Records), which features highly-personal, acoustic renderings of ten of her greatest signature songs as well as offering the new composition “Will You Stay In My Life.” In addition, on November 10, 2012, Ace Records issues “Keep Me In Mind,” the third and final CD of Jackie’s original 1960s-1970s Liberty & Imperial Records singles.\n\nAbout the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and Museum:\n\nThe Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and Museum exists both to honor native Kentucky music professionals who have made significant contributions to the music industry in Kentucky and around the world and to be an educational source for anyone desiring to increase their knowledge of Kentucky’s music."
