        "text": "I was sitting at the Greyhound bus stop in Philadelphia when word came through from Tennessee that George Jones – the finest country singer of all time – had died. The tears fell faster than I ever imagined they would. I was en-route from Nashville to New York and about 23 or so hours into my journey. I was sleep deprived and alone and far from Music City. Conditions were ripe for meltdown. I fired up all the Possum I could on my laptop and wept all the way to Manhattan.\n\nI’ve been thinking for a few days about why I was so sad to hear of Jones’ passing. He was 81 years old. Hardly a young man. And it’s not as though I’d ever met the guy. A friend suggested, perhaps rightly so, that I must have been crying about something else. But I have loved his voice so long. It had the most perfect ache. The greatest sorrow. It was so damn haunted. In honour of his memory I spent the evening of April 26 drinking with a reckless determination I usually only reserve for special occasions. Kidding. See: The Overthinking Person’s Drinking Game for a more accurate summation of my lesser habits.\n\nWhen I moved to the United States last year, I carried too many records and an abundance of dresses that I’m now struggling to squeeze into (thanks American food). I also carried a framed picture of George Jones and Tammy Wynette, which I, really and truly, keep beside my bed.\n\nI’m almost certain that doomed country music superstar lovers aren’t good feng shui but I also know that they both grew up dirt poor and loved to sing and relocated to Nashville to fulfill their dreams, so I forsake spatial good vibes for the sake of reminding myself that Tennessee is the heartland of my kind of music and my kind of people.\n\n“Be real about what you do. Stay true to the voice inside you. Don’t let the “business” change what it is you love because the people, the fans, respond to what is heartfelt. They can always tell when a singer is faking it.” – George Jones, 1931 – 2013."
