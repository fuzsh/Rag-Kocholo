The George Jones — a museum, restaurant and venue dedicated to the late country music legend — permanently closed its doors this week, according to a social media post from the business.

A post to Instagram indicated that COVID-19 hurdles, workforce shortages and the aftermath of last year's Christmas morning bombing contributed to the closure of the museum on Second Avenue in the bustling Lower Broadway entertainment district.

"It has been a difficult [two] years for so many — our company has been no different, the post said, adding: "As many business owners know, between the workforce shortages and difficulty with consistency of products, it is a challenge day to day (to say the least) to make a business viable."

With artifacts and interactive displays, the museum celebrated Jones — a rich-voiced Country Music Hall of Fame singer known for "He Stopped Loving Her Today," "The Race Is On," and countless others. The attraction featured outfits, instruments, awards, platinum albums and Jones' famous John Deere riding lawnmower.

Museum items will be handled with care," according to the closure announcement; a new location for the exhibit is yet to be announced.

The George Jones opened in 2015, two years after the singer's death.

"The George Jones ... started with the intention to have a place where George Jones fans could come and share in the journey of Possum’s life and music — enjoy great food, drinks and live country performances — all with the amazing backdrop of southern hospitality and warmth," the post said. "During the last several years, we have met many of you, shared stories and bonded not only over George Jones, but over country music, Nashville and the spirit of all that encompasses. We are so grateful to all of you for that."
