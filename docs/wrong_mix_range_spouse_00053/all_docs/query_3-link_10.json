        "text": "Dawson Leery\n\nAs the eponymous Dawson from the title, Dawson Leery was every teen girl's ideal guy while the show was running. From his time in high school to his affection for Joey, he's keen on getting things done.\n\nHe's sensitive and emphatic but can be blunt and harsh if the situation calls for it. He was kind, caring, and protective of his friends and feared becoming romantically involved with Joey, as he didn't want to ruin their strong friendship. Despite flaws and problems that might pop up, he was generally a nice guy, and in the end, he somehow doesn't get the girl. Don't worry, Dawson; there are plenty of girls out there!\n\nJames van der Beek Playing Dawson\n\nThere would be no Dawson without James. The actor is in his forties, married to Kimberly, and is the father of four children. He never got back up to the level of fame he had while on “Dawson's Creek.” He has made a few appearances, such as on “Dancing With The Stars” in 2019, as well as “How I Met Your Mother” and “Criminal Minds.”\n\nHe once talked about being in fear of girls his age during his time on the show. Apparently, more than once, someone would approach him for an autograph — which he would gladly sign because he's such a dude — and before he knew what was happening, there would be a mob.\n\nDawson's Mom Gail\n\nNot only did Gail was a good mother for her children, including Dawson, but she was the parental substitute for Joey, whose father was incarcerated, and her mother died of cancer.\n\nIt took plenty of energy and smarts to keep up with the four main kids of the series, but Gail never faltered, even after her husband (Dawson's father) Mitch died in season five. While she did cheat on him (while he was alive, obviously), she realized what she had done was wrong, and the couple stayed together. There was hardly anyone who watched the show and didn't wish, at least a little bit, that Gail was their mother.\n\nMary-Margaret Humes Playing Gail\n\nAfter being the mother bee of the series with Dawson and the other kids, she became queen of Hallmark movies — she's starred in an astounding number, though she's only really had to learn one script.\n\nOther than “Dawson's Creek,” she hasn't been in many huge productions, though she did have a part in “Mel Brook's History of the World Part I” as Miriam. She guest-starred in plenty of shows over the years. If you watch television, you've probably seen her. She's been married to her husband Raul Bruce since 1992. Fun fact: she got third place runner-up in the Miss USA title in 1975.\n\nDawson's Dad Mitch\n\nA caring father. A loving husband. A good man. Mitch Leery was all of these and more, which made his death from a car accident in season five all the more heart-breaking. Not only for viewers, too — Dawson's big storyline in the season was dealing with the loss of his father.\n\nIn the very first episode, he gave Dawson some unforgettable advice: “Sex is a big part of who we are as human beings.” He encouraged Dawson to treat sexuality as a good thing but not to misuse or abuse it. He worked numerous jobs in Capeside, including as a camp counselor and owner of Leery's Fresh Fish.\n\nJohn Wesley Shipp Playing Mitch\n\nYounger audiences may know Mitch's actor John Wesley Shipp as Dr. Henry Allen on The CW's “The Flash.” You may have also seen him on “Teen Wolf” or “One Life to Live.” He still often acknowledges getting his start on “Dawson's Creek.” He's been in numerous movies, including “The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter,” as well as plenty of other TV shows and movies.\n\nThe CW show isn't even the first time he played Barry Allen – he played the character, the original Flash, in “The Flash” television show from 1990 to 1991. He's made plenty of other appearances in other DC projects.\n\nEvelyn “Grams” Ryan\n\nNobody could deny Grams's coolness. Even Jen, a character that many saw as her polar opposite, ends up respecting her. Though strictly religious, it turns out she's very tolerant of others, and her stern demeanor is just an old-fashioned attitude.\n\nShe acts as a parental substitute to Jen and eventually Jack, keeping them on the straight and narrow despite their best efforts. Besides the four main kids, Grams was the only person who had a leading role in all six seasons since Bess and Gail were demoted to “recurring” in the final two seasons. She continually softens as the seasons roll on, becoming less strict.\n\nMary Beth Peil Playing Grams\n\nIf you're an old fan of “Dawson's Creek” and want a taste of that classic Grams charm, head to New York City and stop in at the Broadway production of “Anastasia.” Mary Beth Peil played the Dowager Empress and was so good in the role that she earned a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actress.\n\nPeil has been in plenty more. You can find on the screen, including “Mirrors” in 2008, “The Stepford Wives” in 2004, and “Flags of Our Fathers” in 2006. She was also in almost fifty episodes of “The Good Wife” as Jackie Florrick.\n\nBessie Potter\n\nAt only twenty-five years old, Bessie Potter was raising her younger sister Joey and pregnant with her own first child. The father of her child was Bodie, who was constantly traveling to make enough money for all of them.\n\nBess and Joey butted heads often, with Bess's pregnancy making it harder and harder for her to stomach Joey's antics. Having to raise both her sister and her own child forged Bess into a strong, independent woman that is able to create a somewhat stable, if odd, life with her entire family, allowing her younger sister to grow up a little more carefree than others could.\n\nNina Repeta Playing Bessie\n\nNina's connection to the show began with creator Kevin Williamson. The two were in college together —East Carolina University. After acting on the show, Nina now describes herself as a “Bohemian art mom.” She's married to Mike Repeta, whom she refers to as Aquaman, and has been since 1990.\n\nNina also appeared in “Bloodmoon” in 1997, “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood” in 2002, and “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water” in 2015. She hasn't had many roles since “Dawson's Creek,” but still appears from time to time. Her husband has worked as a camera and electrical operator since 1990.\n\nBodie Wells\n\nA smart, quick-witted, and talented man, Bodie Wells is Bess's boyfriend. The character only appears in eleven total episodes of the show, which many fans consider a shame. He heavily feels the effects of living in a small town and dating (and having a child with) a woman from a different ethnic background.\n\nHe works hard to provide for his family — including Joey, whom he treats like a daughter — and often has to travel to provide for them. Eventually, he partnered with Gail Leery to become a chef at Leery's Fresh Fish, finally settling down for good.\n\nObi Ndefo Playing Bodie\n\nIf you were always struggling to figure out why Bodie was out of town, you might want to check out the rest of Obi Ndefo's work. Three years before he appeared on “Dawson's Creek,” Ndefo had a bit part in the science-fiction great “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” and then jumped from there to a recurring role in “Stargate SG-1.”\n\nHe was a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, and his career was growing and growing until August of 2019, when tragedy struck. While exiting the Erewhon Natural Foods Market in Los Angeles, a drunk driver hit him. The doctors had to amputate his legs above the knee.\n\nJoey Potter\n\nAloof, pretty Joey had every guy drooling after her just like all the girls drooled after Dawson. She was smart, got perfect grades, and was so opinionated it sometimes hurt friendships or relationships. While being depicted as unpopular early on, the show let her grow into being a more popular character in later seasons.\n\nShe tended to be unemotional but short-tempered when it came to personal things. She began the show as a tomboy without many girly affectations, but as the show progressed and her actress blossomed, she wore more fashionable clothes and started putting on makeup. She was the girl-next-door type, and one of the show's big questions was who she would end up with.\n\nKatie Holmes Playing Joey\n\nAnybody who watched the show recognized that Joey would grow up to be a shining star, and it certainly happened. Katie Holmes appeared in movies even before “Dawson's Creek” ended, and her first big film after the wrap was as Rachel Dawes in “Batman Begins.” She played Jackie O in “The Kennedys.”\n\nShe's had numerous other roles in TV and movies, big and small, including also appearing in “How I met Your Mother,” as the “Slutty Pumpkin” that main character Ted is infatuated with. Unfortunately, her character never interacts with James van der Beek's character on the show. You're probably aware of her past relationship with actor Tom Cruise — their daughter Suri is now a teenager.\n\nPacey's Teacher Tamara Jacobs\n\nBorn and raised in Manhattan, Tamara relocates to Capeside and flirts with a video store clerk while checking out “The Graduate.” That video store clerk turns out to be Pacey and follows is one of the most controversial plotlines on the show.\n\nShe kisses him at the marina after he tries to flirt with her at the movie theater, and later on at school, despite trying to brush him off, she kisses him again. The two end up in a physical relationship and must keep looking over their shoulders to keep the relationship under wraps. Once caught, Pacey says he made up rumors about the relationship to appear cool, saving Tamara from not only firing but jail time.\n\nLeann Hunley Playing Tamara\n\nIf you're a fan of the soaps, then Leann Hunley is probably a familiar face. She has been playing Anna DiMera on “Days of Our Lives” for over six hundred episodes, starting in 1982. She was also Dana Waring Carrington in the TV show “Dynasty” and also had a recurring part in “The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo” from 1979 to 1980.\n\nHer very first role was in the classic “Hawaii Five-O” series as Lucy Sutherland, Longworth's secretary. She was also in “Gilmore Girls,” “NCIS,” “7th Heaven,” “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,” and many, many more.\n\nJack McPhee\n\nClumsy, sensitive, and socially awkward, Jack just wants to be one of the guys. Joey falls for him in season two, but to the surprise of both members of this short-lived romantic relationship, Jack discovers he is gay shortly thereafter. The show handled the character with surprising deftness and didn't heap stereotypes on him. He was just another guy.\n\nHe becomes one of Jen's closest friends, and try as he might not to, he attracts plenty of girls both in-universe and out, thanks to both his looks and his personal, attentive nature. He and his sister Andie joined the main characters starting in the second season.\n\nKerr Smith Playing Jack\n\nKerr Smith was a standout actor as Jack, who helped the show focus not on his sexuality but on his winning character and friendships. He even made the friendship with old-fashioned Grams seem natural and fun to watch.\n\nSmith appears as Principal Holden Honey on “Riverdale” and also has a recurring part on the show “The Resident” as Jacob Yorn. He had a part in “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” and “Life Unexpected” and has plenty of other TV credits under his belt. His first role was from 1996 to 1997 as Ryder Hughes and Teddy Ellison Hughes on “As the World Turns.”\n\nJen Lindley\n\nComing from a dysfunctional family, Jen is the broken bird of the main cast. She was always sarcastic and ready with a witty comment no matter the situation. Though Joey was the main female character, Jen worked the hardest to bring all the different characters together.\n\nShe had the biggest social influence among the group, not only becoming the head cheerleader but being voted as Homecoming Queen. However, she was often quiet, kind, and introverted. Unfortunately, the character didn't make it through the end of the show – she collapsed in the final episode of the series, eventually succumbing to a fatal heart condition.\n\nMichelle Williams Playing Jen\n\nAfter showing her acting skills as the rebellious Jen, Michelle Williams was on to bigger and better things. She's practically a Hollywood legend, thanks to appearing in famous films such as “Brokeback Mountain,” “Blue Valentine,” and “The Greatest Showman.”\n\nShe kills it on the red carpet year after year; she's been nominated for Oscars and is even a mom. She was in a years-long relationship with actor Heath Ledger until his untimely death. She's now been married twice: First to Phil Elverum for only a year, and then in 2020, she wedded Thomas Kail.\n\nAndie McPhee\n\nAndie, Jack's sister, was a nice, nerdy, and energetic girl who suffered from clear mental illness during her time on the show. She was the love interest to Pacey in season two and remained part of the core cast for almost three seasons. At the end of season four, she graduated from Capeside High.\n\nHer academic ambitions saw her volunteering and always striving for a better grade, and she eventually went to Harvard. Her mental issues, which the show handled realistically, stemmed from her older brother's death. She wasn't the only one in the family with mental health issues — her mother suffered from them as well.\n\nMeredith Monroe Playing Andie\n\nThe way she portrayed a character suffering from mental illness got Monroe plenty of acclaim, and she used it to move on to big roles in TV and movies. Just recently, she's been on “13 Reasons Why,” “Criminal Minds” (as Hotch's wife), and “Hart of Dixie.”\n\nShe's had dozens of parts in movies big and small, such as “Minority Report,” “Transformers: Dark of the Moon,” and “The Edge of Seventeen.” While she's only been in a handful of titles since about 2015, her role in “13 Reasons Why” has helped to put her back in the spotlight.\n\nDoug Witter\n\nPacey's older brother is a by-the-book cop who struggles to keep Pacey in line. Much of the tension between the two brothers is how willing Pacey is to bend the rules, while Doug doesn't enjoy having to put up with his teenage misbehavior. While Doug does care about Pacey in a stern way, Pacey's tendencies create plenty of tension between the two.\n\nDespite never exhibiting any of the stereotypes, many people are quick to comment on Doug's sexuality. This continues up until the series finale when Doug finally comes out rather than lose his relationship with Jack.\n\nDylan Neal Playing Doug\n\nAfter finally hanging up his pressed, tight police uniforms when the show ended, Dylan Neal went on to appear in plenty of TV movies, had a role in “Blood Ties” during 2007, and even appeared in “Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief” as the deity Hermes.\n\nThis journeyman actor is one of those guys who seem to have been in one episode of everything, including “Arrow” as Dr. Anthony Ivo, “Cedar Grove” as Jack Griffith, and “The Gourmet Detective” as Henry Ross. His biggest role in recent years was as Bob, Anastasia's stepfather, in “Fifty Shades of Grey” and “Fifty Shades Freed.”\n\nAudrey Liddell\n\nDespite the two girls having wildly different personalities and temperaments, Audrey and Joey end up developing a strong friendship that lasts from Audrey's time as an extra to the end of the series. She's outgoing, talkative, and promiscuous, but in the end, she's a good friend who always had Joey's back.\n\nDuring just the span of season five, she went from a background character to being added to the main credits, and she becomes a regular member of the kids. She starts a relationship with Pacey (doesn't everybody?), but it doesn't last very long. Pacey's heart was never in the relationship and is relieved when it ends.\n\nBusy Philipps Playing Audrey\n\nTrue to her name, Philipps is keeping herself busy. She held a talk show, “Busy Tonight,” with herself as the host and has had numerous projects in the works. She was in plenty of big movies, including “Made of Honor,” “He's Just Not That Into You,” and “White Chicks” as Karen, one of the titular chicks.\n\nBefore jumping over to “Dawson's Creek,” she was a big part of the show “Freaks and Geeks,” appearing as Kim Kelly. Her other biggest role was “Cougar Town,” from 2009 to 2015 when she played Laurie Keller for more than a hundred episodes. She and Michelle Williams are still friends.\n\nPacey Witter\n\nPacey didn't fit in with his family at all — they saw him as an embarrassment and a failure. It's why he was so close to his friends and why insulting or attacking one of them, especially a love interest, was such a bad idea. Still, the show treated him as the punching bag, having one mishap after another happen to him, despite him being charming, attractive, funny, and witty.\n\nHe wasn't very smart, at least compared to his sister Gretchen, and was often foolish, contrasting his older brother Doug, who was a police officer. Despite all of this, he wins Joey's affection by the end of the season.\n\nJoshua Jackson Playing Pacey\n\nIt's been said there are two kinds of “Dawson's Creek” fans: those who love Pacey and those who are lying. Twenty years after Pacey made the bowl-cut cool again (almost), Joshua Jackson is still looking fresh, with a more grown-up demeanor.\n\nHe was one of the main characters on “Fringe,” “The Affair,” the TV miniseries “Little Fires Everywhere,” and “Dr. Death.” He was married to actress Jodie Turner-Smith, with whom he has a daughter, Janie. Fun fact: Jackson screen-tested for the lead role in “Batman Begins,” which would have again made him Katie Holmes's romantic partner on the screen.\n\nAbby Morgan\n\nAs one of the biggest snarkers on the show, Abby never missed a chance to make fun of someone, and she wasn't ever able to be subtle about it. Her brutal honesty made it difficult for people to be friends with her, and despite the fact that she acted like she was all that and a bag of chips, only Jen could stand her – and not even all the time.\n\nShe manipulated the people around her, made fun of things like Joey's dead mother, and was hinted to be incredibly insecure and vulnerable behind her nasty behavior, but she got drunk and drowned before anybody could learn more. Not even Jen was saddened to learn about her death.\n\nMonica Keena Playing Abby\n\nAbby only appeared in the first two seasons of “Dawson's Creek,” giving her actress Monica Keena plenty of time to work on other projects. She was a character on “Undeclared” from 2001 to 2003, and then appeared as Lori Campbell on “Freddy vs. Jason.”\n\nThere have been plenty of other titles she's appeared in since then, including — of all things — providing voices for the “Beavis and Butt-Head” revival. She has numerous other roles in the works for a few titles: “Karma,” “Manson Girls,” and “Zombie Bride.”\n\nChris Wolfe\n\nAppearing only in season two, Chris Wolfe is the rich “study benefactor” that invites the group (minus Jack) to his house in order to get closer to Jen. He ends up teaming up with Abby Morgan on her various schemes to manipulate people and get what she wants, and eventually becomes the lead on Dawson's film “Creek Daze.”\n\nHe always had too much gel in his hair, never let his crush on Jen go, even though he still hit on Abby. He seems to have been the only one to combat Abby's constant snarking, even if he did do it with a unique brand of hard-headed humor.\n\nJason Behr Playing Chris\n\nAfter his time at the creek, Jason would go on to star in his own WB show, “Roswell,” along with Katherine Heigl and Shiri Appleby. While Jason hasn't been the most active actor that used “Dawson's Creek” as a jumping-off point, he's still had numerous roles. He appeared in 2004's Japanese horror remake “The Grudge,” as Varek/Caleb Talbot in “Skinwalkers,” and as Ethan Kendrick in “Dragon Wars: D-War,” which we're sure was an outstanding movie.\n\nHe had a recurring role as Damien Fauntleroy in “Breakout Kings” in 2012 and then was quiet until just recently in 2020 when he helped out the revival of “Roswell” as Tripp Manes in “Roswell, New Mexico.”\n\nHenry Parker\n\nAs the first freshman quarterback in Capeside High's history, kind, sweet, and gentle Henry Parker had his pick of gals, but he picked Jen. While Jen finds his emotions intense and impressive, she never gives him much more than the time of day, despite how many attempts he makes to get her to go on a date with him.\n\nShe eventually comes around, realizing that he's a good guy, but he's given up and tells her off for all the missed opportunities she had. He's good friends with Jack, and while he's well-liked, his character doesn't appear after the end of season three.\n\nMichael Pitt Playing Henry\n\nActor Michael Pitt and his kissable lips have enjoyed a steady film and TV career once his time on “Dawson's Creek” ended. He had a few seasons on the show “Boardwalk Empire” as James “Jimmy” Darmody from 2010 to 2011 and is still getting regular work today.\n\nYou may have also seen him in a three-episode role as Mason Verger in “Hannibal.” He's also had some big movie roles, such as in “Funny Games,” “Seven Psychopaths,” “The Dreamers,” and “I Origins.”\n\nEve Whitman\n\nWho is Eve? It was a big mystery for a little while during season two. At first, she was a fantasy, with no attachment or affiliation to anyone, but eventually reveals that she has an emotional nature and was not really deceptive, just unwilling to talk about herself.\n\nIt's eventually revealed that she is Jen's half-sister and is looking for her mother, Helen Lindley. It's unknown whether or not she was ever successful, seeing as she left the show before season two ended, but Jen's mother Helen did eventually join the cast. Eve isn't mentioned again.\n\nBrittany Daniel Playing Eve\n\nDaniel appeared on “Dawson's Creek” following the success of the “Sweet Valley High” series, and her TV career continued long after her short stint with Dawson, Joey, and the rest ended.\n\nShe was on a few episodes of “That '70s Show,” has made appearances on “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” and has recently been in “Black-ish.” She was on the show “The Game” for more than eighty episodes between 2006 and 2015 and acted with Busy Philipps on “White Chicks,” though their characters weren't on Dawson's at the same time. She's also had a good number of other movie roles, including “Skyline” from 2010.\n\nEthan Brody\n\nA recurring character in season three, Ethan is a sweet, relaxed, and bright guy. He gets to know Jack after arriving in Capeside, and the two start a tenuous relationship, though Ethan is hesitant to start since he'd recently experienced heartbreak, and Jack's inexperience in romantic matters is clear.\n\nEthan becomes pivotal in helping Jack rebuild his relationship with his father. While Jack is interested in more than just friendship, Ethan tells Jack that he needs to see that Jack is ready for a real relationship. Ethan's parents live in Capeside, and though Ethan goes to college elsewhere, he makes several appearances during season three.\n\nAdam Kaufman Playing Ethan\n\nBefore Kaufman joined the cast of Dawson's, he was in five episodes of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” as Parker Abrams. He has been doing great on television even so long after his appearance on “Dawson's Creek.”\n\nHe was on thirteen episodes of “Without a Trace” as Brian Donovan, had the same number as Lucas Newsome on “State of Affairs,” appeared on “NCIS” and “Law & Order” (though who hasn't, really), and has also had appearances on “Mad Men” and “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.” So yes, a few episodes on a well-known show can make your career for years.\n\nBianca Lawson Playing Nikki Green\n\nBefore becoming step-sister to Beyoncé – yes, really – Bianca Lawson was playing a teen on plenty of shows, including “Dawson's Creek” and “Pretty Little Liars.” She had a short arc during season three of Dawson's that had her playing the high school principal's daughter and fellow film buff.\n\nWhile she bonded with Dawson over their love of films, filmmaking, and their mutual roles as children of divorce, she only appeared in a total of four episodes. She's smart, driven, bold, and kind, and there are plenty of fans who would have liked to see her appear more frequently. Lawson has been acting in “Queen Sugar” since 2016.\n\nSasha Alexander Playing Gretchen Witter\n\nAs the older sister of Pacey and the younger sister of Doug, Gretchen Witter is a force to be reckoned with. She helped console Dawson after his breakup with Joey, dated Dawson for a short time, and was always ready to tell her brother off. She came home after dropping out of college in season four.\n\nSasha Alexander, who played Gretchen, has had plenty of success in other markets. She was in fifty episodes of “NCIS,” over a hundred episodes of “Rizzoli & Isles,” and thirteen episodes on “Wasteland” before she was even on “Dawson's Creek.” She's also popped up in several movies, including “Mission: Impossible III.”\n\nMark Matkevich Playing Drue Valentine\n\nThe early nineties were all about hair gel, and Drue Valentine was part of that trend as one of Jen's old friends from New York. He was a vicious, mean-spirited person who was out to wreak havoc on Capeside, even going so far as to be dubbed the male Abby Morgan.\n\nHe appears only during season four as the product of divorced parents who clearly valued status and money over the well-being of their son. This is shown when he is trapped in a storage locker with Joey and every once in a while with Jen. Matkevich hasn't acted much recently, but he manages an art gallery and has thankfully been using less hair gel.\n\nDavid Monahan Playing Tobey Barrett\n\nTobey Barrett spearheads the crusade for LGBT+ activism in Capeside. He can be acerbic and short-fused due to the discrimination he has received by being gay, but at his core, he is a sweet and caring guy. He also volunteers at a reading program for kids. He was Jack's first official boyfriend, though Jack ultimately went with someone else.\n\nDavid has appeared on “Dexter,” “Revenge,” and “Big Little Lies” when he portrayed one of the parents seen in the interrogation room. Tobey appears in seven episodes total, split between season four and five. The relationship ended when Jack chose a fraternity over Tobey.\n\nChad Michael Murray Playing Charlie Todd\n\nCharlie was a serial womanizer who ended up dating both Jen and Joey. He always knew what to say, but to most people, it came up as false, fake, and easy to see through. He ends up being rather insecure and ultimately kind of boring. He only appeared in season five but was in almost half of the episodes from that season. He was a terrible boyfriend, not good at guitar, and had bad taste in jewelry.\n\nYou know Chad Michael Murray from his time as the heartthrob lead role on “One Tree Hill.” He's been married to actress Sarah Roemer since 2014, and the couple has two children together.\n\nKen Marino Playing Professor David Wilder\n\nAppearing in season five, Ken Marino plays Joey's English professor David Wilder. He was attractive, calm, and sarcastic, and many of the female students in his class held a candle for him. He got out of these situations by saying he was married though he wasn't. Joey had problems in the class, and David helped her get through the issues, and they even saw each other for a short amount of time.\n\nKen Marino has been in plenty, everything from “Veronica Mars” to “The Babysitter.” The professor was originally going to appear for the entirety of season five, but Marino booked another job that forced him to cut his time on the show short.\n\nHal Ozsan Playing Todd Carr\n\nThis arrogant, hot-tempered, and renegade British director seen in seasons five and six fired Dawson from a film project before re-hiring him on for another project rather quickly. Todd (who also had plenty of hair gel) lasted for twelve episodes. While he's a boss from hell, he reveals that he's a far kinder and nicer person when he isn't working, and Dawson works with him as an assistant director on a B-movie horror flick.\n\nHal Oszan later reunited with James van der Beek when the two wrote several episodes of “What Would Diplo Do?” He was also in “Jessica Jones” and “NCIS: New Orleans.”\n\nBianca Kajlich Playing Natasha Kelly\n\nNatasha is a scheming, superficial, and bold girl who works as an actor in Los Angeles and starred in director Todd Carr's B-movie “Wicked Dead.” During season six, she has a fling with Dawson. She didn't treat him very well, even after all the work he did to get them tickets to a No Doubt concert.\n\nBianca Kajlich became well-known for playing Jennifer on all seven seasons of “Rules of Engagement.” She's also been in “Undateable,” “Rock Me, Baby,” “Bosch,” and is currently in the show “Legacies” as Sheriff Machado. She's also been in movies such as “Bring It On” and “Halloween: Resurrection.”\n\nDana Ashbrook Playing Rich Rinaldi\n\nBoth before and after playing Pacey's unlikable stockbroker boss on season six for nine episodes, he played a classic Gordon Gecko type who wanted success and nothing else.\n\nDana Ashbrook was one of the main characters on the famous mind-bending TV show “Twin Peaks.” The original series ran for thirty episodes from 1989 to 1991, and the revival ran in 2017. He's had a long career in movies and television, and you might have seen him in “Chicago P.D.,” “Blue Bloods,” and “White Collar.” Hey, he was even in “Girlfriend from Hell” all the way back in 1989.\n\nRoger Howarth Playing Professor Greg Hetson\n\nDuring her time at Boston Bay college in season six, Joey had two different English professors. David Wilder was one, and the other was Professor Hetson. However, this professor wasn't the lovable hunk that Wilder was. He was always yelling, had a weird earring, and was only in nine episodes, though his character was mostly to introduce his daughter, Harley.\n\nSince 2012, Roger Howarth has been on the popular soap opera “General Hospital,” and before “Dawson's Creek,” he played a character on the long-running soap “One Life to Live.”\n\nOliver Hudson Playing Eddie Doling\n\nAs Joey's on-again-off-again boyfriend during season six, Eddie constantly dumps Joey only to get back together with her. Their relationship was special — it was intellectual and emotional, and they influenced each other and helped each other grow as people. In their final split near the end of the final season, he breaks up with her via a note on her phone.\n\nThe show is now twenty years old, and Oliver Hudon's hairline still looks pretty good. Hudson was on forty episodes of “Nashville,” a hundred episodes of “Rules of Engagement,” and was recently in “Splitting Up Together.”"
