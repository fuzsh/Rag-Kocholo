He died March 19, 1929 in Milford, Kansas. When Levi was 19, he moved from Pennsylvania to Illinois. There he met Margaret (Maggie) Brenneman. They were married on December 17, 1878, in Princeton, Illinois. Margaret Catherine Brenneman was born Oct 6, 1857 in Malden, Illinois, and died July 12, 1925 in Harvard, Clay Co, Nebraska. In 1883, they moved to Nebraska to a farm 6 ½ miles NE of Harvard, where they homesteaded. In 1914, they moved to a house in the town of Harvard. They were farmers and members of the Christian Church. Margaret, who went by Maggie, was diabetic and died of heart failure. Maggie was the daughter of Martin Brenneman and Mary Eva Garmon and was the eighth child of ten. Levi and Maggie had eight children.\n\nThe following courtesy of Matt and Monica Thompson:\n\nLevi was stern and austere, a hard man for hard times. He did not believe in games, dancing, or card playing, and although he seemed gruff, he gave pennies to the children. He was a large heavy man with a moustache and a deacon in the First Christian Church.\n\nAs a homemaker and mother, Maggie was a great family lady, patient and wise, who loved her 24 grandchildren. She belonged to the First Christian Church. She was “quite a gal” and known as a real down-to-earth character with the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon, but not much religion. A granddaughter compiled some 800 of her old proverbs and pithy saying (some unprintable) into a book.\n\nOn the 29th of January 1927, Levi married Mrs. Mary Mell of St Joseph, Missouri at Liberty, Missouri. In May of 1928, they moved to Cambridge, Nebraska where they were living at the time of his death. Levi suffered a stroke in 1927, and his health continued to fail after that. Levi died March 19, in the hospital in Milford, Kansas.\n\nBoth Maggie and Levi are buried in the Harvard, Nebraska cemetery.\n\nMargaret (Maggie) Catherine Brenneman Kaufman Levi Henry Kaufman\n\nLevi Henry and Maggie Catherine Brenneman Kaufman\n\nMaggie and Levi Kaufman\n\nMARGARET KAUFMAN OBITUARY\n\nHarvard newspaper, July 16, 1925\n\nMrs. Margaret C. Kaufman\n\nMargaret C. Brenneman was born at Malden, Illinois, October 1857 and departed this life in Harvard, July 12, 1925 aged 67 years, 9 months, and six days. She was the daughter of Martin and Mary Brenneman.\n\nOn December 17, 1878, at Princeton, Illinois, she was married to Mr. Levi Kaufman, and to this union eight children were born. Three of the children have preceded the mother: Mrs. Lizzie Carlson in 1904; Benjamin Kaufman in 1920; and one child in infancy. The living children are: Mrs. Annie Hiatt, Mrs. Minnie Skinner, Mr. Winfield Kaufman of Harvard, Mrs. Grace Lentz of Holbrook, NE, and Mrs. Blanche Nowka of Harvard. In addition, two of her grandchildren, Mrs. Ruth Wright of Trinidad, CO and Miss Vesta Carlson of Harvard were reared in the home.\n\nHer parents, two brothers, and one sister have preceded her. Three brothers and two sisters are living. They are: John Brenneman of near Harvard, Martin Brenneman of Hastings, NE, Daniel Brenneman of Princeton, IL, Mrs. Mary Lewis of Horton, KS and Mrs. Hattie B. Stockham of Aurora, NE.\n\nIn 1883, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman moved from Illinois to Nebraska and settled on a farm six and one-half miles northeast of Harvard. Here they lived until 1914 when they moved to Harvard where they have since resided.\n\nAbout thirty years ago, Mrs. Kaufman and her husband united with the Christian church in Harvard. During all the years that this most important step of becoming a Christian, she had continued in the faith in Christ. She loved the church and was especially interested in its benevolent work in which she was a sympathetic contributor. She loved the hymns of the church and during her last illness had them played often that she might enjoy them.\n\nHer health had been failing for about one year. Her last illness continued five weeks during which time she suffered but bore it all with Christian fortitude and patience. She desired to live but said if she could not, she was ready to go.\n\nShe leaves her husband, one son, four daughters, three brothers, two sisters, twenty-four grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, and a large circle of friends to mourn their loss.\n\nMrs. Kaufman was a devoted wife. As a mother, she was ever kind and loving. Anything she could do for her family and friends were not counted as a sacrifice, but a love service.

As you know, from information previously mentioned, Margaret Catherine Brenneman (My Great Grandmother) married Levi Henry Kaufman, my Grandma Grace’s parents. Once again, you will notice the numerous uses of the same first names from generation to generation.\n\nTHE BRENNEMANS\n\nI followed the Brenneman family back to my 7th Great Grandparents:\n\nMelchior Brenneman “The Exile” Born about 1631 in Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland and died about 1678 in Griesheim, Hessen, Germany. The Brenneman name is sometimes spelled Bronniman in Switzerland, but by about 1700, it became Brenneman. Melchior was dubbed the “Exile” because he was imprisoned in the Castle of Thun in 1659 for his Mennonite views. He was a weaver by trade. He fled Switzerland to Germany in 1671. He married Christina Reussen and had four children that I could find: Johann 1661, Adam, 1663. Melchior II 1665-1737, and Christian 1667-1759.\n\nMelchior “The Exile” Brenneman 7th Great Grandfather\n\nCastle of Thun, Switzerland\n\n6th Great Grandparents:\n\nMelchior “The Pioneer” II Brenneman, born 1665 in Oberdiessbach, Lucerne, Switzerland. He was a weaver and Mennonite preacher. He married Elizabeth Jane Steham in Bern, Switzerland. To avoid further persecution of their Mennonite faith, they fled Germany and came to Pennsylvania in 1709 and settled near Germantown. They immigrated to Philadelphia on Aug 24, 1707. He is buried in new Danville cemetery, Lancaster County, PA. They had six children: Christopher 1693-1758; Christian 1695-1757; John 1697-1757; Catherine 1705-About 1756; Melchior Stehman (III) 1718-1794; Adam (My 5th Great Grandfather) 1730-1804.\n\n5th Great Grandparents:\n\nAdam Brenneman was born 1730 in PA and died 1759 in Conestoga, Landcaster, PA. Adam married Mary (last name unknown). They had ten children, all born in Pennsylvania. Isaac (My 4th Great grandfather) born 1730-1804; Magdalena 1732; Henry 1735-1815; Eve 1737-1808; Adam 1740-Between 1778-79; Anna 1742; John 1744-1818 (John was a Doctor); Barbara 1747 (Husband was a Mennonite Minister); Maria 1750-1831; Elizabeth 1754-Before 1786.\n\n4th Great Grandparents:\n\nIsaac Brenneman was born in 1730 in New Danville, PA and died 1804 in the same town. He married Veronica Forrer 1734-1805. They had five children: Christian 1765; Ann 1767; Fannie 1769-1826; Mary 1771-1841 (never married); Martin (My 3rd Great Grandfather) 1776-1862.\n\n3rd Great Grandparents:\n\nMartin Brenneman was born July 23, 1776 in New Danville, PA and died May 30, 1862 in Malden, ILL. Martin married Veronica Kendig on Jan. 20, 1808 in Lancaster, PA. Veronica was born in 1780 and died in 1845. They had ten children: Anna 1812-1910; Fanany 1814; Mary 1817-1886 (married Michael Kaufman who disappeared from home and was never heard from again); Martin (My 2nd Great Grandfather) 1819-1914; George 1825; Christian 1826-between 1905-06; two male children, and two female children, names unknown died as infants.\n\n2nd Great Grandparents:\n\nMartin Brenneman II was born March 17, 1819 near New Danville, PA and died March 25, 1914 in Princeton, IL. Martin married three times. His first wife was Lydia Young in 1843 with three children: Mary Ann 1846-1914; Henry C. 1844-1869; Melchior “Michael” 1846-Infancy death. Then Martin married Mary Eva Garman February 8, 1847 (My 2nd Great Grandmother). Mary was born, Eva Maria Germann, on Dec 25, 1822, per Find a Grave, in Hessen, Darmstadt, Germany and died Oct 15, 1900, in Princeton, Bureau, IL. Her parents were Johann Phillip Germann and Catherina Margaretha Ross. She came to Franklin county, PA in 1830 and then to Wayne, Stark and Cuyahoga Counties, IL. After Martin and Mary married, they moved to Bureau County in 1855 where they farmed. After Mary died in 1900, the family moved to Princeton, IL.\n\nNOTE: I will talk briefly about the Garman Family. I was able to follow them on my family tree back to my 4th Great Grandparents:\n\n4th Great Grandparents: Johann Peter Germann and Rebekka Lautenschlager (no information)\n\n3rd Great Grandparents: Johann Phillip Germann and Catherina Margaretha Ross\n\nPhillip was born Sept 15, 1783 in Messbach, Hessen, Germany and died Aug 23, 1861 in Independence, Cuyahoga, OH. He married Catharina Margaretha Ross on July 30, 1816 in Hessen, Darmstadt, Germany and had thirteen children. Catharina was born May 31, 1796 in Hessen, Germany and died 1885 Stark, OH. One of the thirteen children was my 2nd Great Grandmother, Mary Garman 1821-1900.\n\nJOHN PHILLIP GARMAN OBITUARY (3rd Great Grandfather)\n\nBirth: Sep 16, 1783, Hessen, Germany\n\nDeath: Aug 23, 1861, Independence, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, USA\n\nJohn Philip Garman was born as Johann Philipp Germann in Messbach, Hessen Sept 16, 1783. He married Catharina Margaretha Ross on July 30, 1816, Neunkirchen, Hessen. He was a son of Johann Peter Germann and Elizabeth Rebecca Lautenschlager. He served as a soldier in the Hessen-Darmstadt troops under Napoleon in the Peninsular Wars and was in prison in Lisbon. Later, he was on the march to Moscow in 1812 and survived the perilous march back to Europe. He married and started a family in Brandau, Hessen, and they immigrated in 1830 to the U.S. landing in Baltimore and later went to PA and settled in Wayne, later Stark, and then Independence, Cuyahoga Co, OH by 1850 where he died Aug 23, 1861. His widow died in Stark Co, OH on Jan 25, 1885.\n\nI was able to follow the Ross family back to my 8th Grandparents.\n\nMary Eva Garman 1822 – 1900 and Martin Brenneman 1819-1914 (2nd Great Grandparents)\n\nMary Eva Garman Brenneman was Martin’s second wife. They had seven children: George W. 1850-1922; Sarah Amanda 1853-1920; Martin Van Buren 1855-1920; Margaret* (My Great Grandmother) 1857-1925; Harriet Elizabeth 1860-1936; Daniel Webster 1863-1929; and John 1848-1936\n\nMartin married his third wife, Ruth Vickery.\n\nExcerpt from the Akron Beacon Journal from Aug 29, 1903:\n\nThe Family History that was read at the Garman Family Reunion came from Germany: The Horrors of a Soldiers Life in that Country Caused Emigration to the Land of the Free– An Interesting Story.\n\nAt the annual reunion of the Garman family this week some interesting features were developed in a paper read by Mrs. Charles Garman of Richfield. It follows:\n\nSome 80 years ago, John Philip Garman with his wife, Katherine Margaret Ross, with two or three little children, was living in a quiet little village in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany. Their home was close by the village fountain, where every night after their work on the outlying farms, the people gathered to smoke and spend an hour in kindly chat about little daily happenings. It was a quiet, happy life. But in Germany, every young man must serve seven years in the army. This little family had increased to seven, and four of them were boys. The father had spent seven years in the army, part of the time under Napoleon, whom he greatly admired. Four of the seven years, he was a prisoner of war in Lisbon, so he knew the privations and horrors of a soldier’s life. The mother felt she could never allow her boys to become targets for bullets, so they decided to come to America, where few soldiers were needed, and where there would be opportunities for the children to make a good living. It was a hard matter to leave friends and relatives and the happy village home. But for the sake of the children, all ties were severed, and in May of 1829, they started on a long and tedious voyage of three months, landing in Baltimore 74 years ago this month. They had been obliged to sell their property in Germany at a sacrifice, and the expenses of the long voyage had consumed their little hoard, so when they arrived in this country they were well-nigh penniless. From Baltimore, they traveled in a wagon to Franklin County, PA.\n\nIt was very hard for the mother to adapt herself to the ways of living in the new and lonely country. Their first home was a log cabin in a lonely spot, far from neighbors, in the edge of the forest. In after years, the mother often told her children of her bitter homesickness and the feeling of desolation it gave her when the dry leaves rustled in the cabin door. From here, they moved to Stark County, OH. Later, they went to Wayne County, and in 1849 to Independence, in Cuyahoga County, where the father died in 1862. The mother died in Stark County in 1888.\n\nMary married Martin Brenneman, and her descendants are in the west, mostly in Illinois and Nebraska.\n\nMary Eva Garman Brenneman 1821 – 1900 Martin Brenneman 1819 – 1914\n\n2ND GREAT GRANDMOTHER Mary Eva Garman’s parents: I was able to follow the Ross family to my Eighth Great Grandparents. My 3rd Great Grandparents Ross, were born in Germany and were the first Ross generation to come to America, however, most of their children were born in Germany before they came here.\n\n3RD GREAT GRANDPARENTS:\n\nJOHANN PHILLIP GERMANN (GARMAN) 1783-1861 CATHARINA M.

I don’t have an obituary for Grandma Grace, but her pallbearers were grandsons Don Bathrick, Frank Bathrick, Jack Gibson, Gary Gibson, John Shriver, and Douglas Shriver. Honorary pallbearers were: David Gibson, Greg Shriver, Mark Shriver, and Louis Haussler. She is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Denver, Colorado.

John had lived with his Grandfather when he was a small child, but when he was 18, he went to work on farms in the region. One such farm was the Ben Kaufman farm. The 1910 census shows he was living with Ben and Eva Kaufman as a hired hand. It is unclear if John and Grace knew each other before this time, but Ben Kaufman was Grace’s Uncle, so if Grace didn’t know John before that time, she met him when he was working at their farm. A romance must have blossomed as they were married in August that year.\n\nThey farmed, and later, John ran the gas station in Holbrook, NE. John and Grace moved to Denver in about May 1936, and he owned another gas station located at 5501 N. Federal Blvd, in Denver, Colorado. They lived in the back quarters of the establishment. Their daughter, Betty Jayne was still living at home.\n\nGrandma Grace wrote a lot of poetry which she often included with cards for Christmas or birthdays. Her sister Minnie Bell also wrote poems.\n\nHOME\n\nSometimes when skies are dark and dreary\n\nAnd your thoughts are want to roam\n\nThere is nothing quite so restful\n\nAs the quietness of home.\n\nSome folks try to search for happiness\n\nOver distant lands and foam\n\nBut after all the sights and pleasures\n\nThere is just no place like home.\n\n~ By Grace Kaufman Lentz Smith – 1952\n\nJOHN LENTZ OBITUARY\n\nJohn Lentz Dies in Denver From Illness\n\nFollowing an illness of several months, John Lentz died Sunday at Denver, Colorado, the body being brought here for funeral services at the St. Matthew’s Lutheran church, Wednesday, with burial in Holbrook Cemetery. Mr. Lentz operated the filling station for several years leaving Holbrook, about two years ago, and had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, here, which are sorry to hear of his passing.\n\nObituary\n\nJohn Lentz, son of Anton Lentz and Emma Schnell, was born July 4th, 1891, in Clay County, Nebraska. His mother died when he was still at a tender age. Sometimes with his father and sometimes in the home of other relatives, he lived in Clay County at Plainview, at Arlington in Hoke County at Holbrook, and in Denver where he died June 19th, 1938, after a lingering illness, which confined him for the last 5 months to his home and to hospital care. He is survived by two brothers, George Lentz, Lincoln, NE; William Lentz, Centerville, MT; Four Sisters: Emma Borberg, Billings, MT; Mrs. J.H. Hilgenkamp, Arlington, NE; Minnie Pederson, New York City. In 1910, he was married to Grace Kaufman of Harvard, who, besides four daughters, mourn his early death. The daughters are Opal Haussler of Holbrook; Violet Gibson of Longmont, CO; Elaine Bathrick, also of Longmont, and Betty, still at home and also several grandchildren.\n\nHe died at his home in Denver, June 19. In his infancy, he was baptized in the Lutheran Church and later also confirmed in this faith. He attained the age of 46 years, 11 months, and 15 days. He was given a Christian burial from St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church and committed to the earth in Holbrook cemetery on June 22nd. Rev. M. Schalbacker conducted the funeral service. During his last illness in Denver, Rev. E. Peters, Lutheran City Missionary of Denver, attended to his spiritual needs and prepared him to meet death in Christian faith and fortitude.\n\nOut-of-town relatives attending the funeral of John Lentz, Wednesday, were Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Hildgenkamp of Arlington, Catherine Langemeyer of Plainview, Mrs. George Lentz of Fremont, Mrs. Harry Giesselman and daughter of Arlington.

He went by the name of Jim and Val and answered to both. I never knew my Grandpa John Lentz, since he died in 1938 before I was born, so I always referred to him as Grandpa Smith. James Smith was born Nov 16, 1894 in NE and died April 17, 1976, in Arvada, CO. Jim is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Denver, CO.\n\nJim was previously married to Lillian and had two children: Cecil E. and Laven G. He had six siblings. The census in 1920 showed Jim as a famer, but in 1940 census, his occupation was self-employed painter. I am not sure when Jim moved to Colorado to make it his home. I believe that Grace and Jim met when he was hired to paint the building where Grace was working. They struck up a conversation and realized that they were both from the same area of Nebraska and found they had many things in common. I have a picture of them dated 1940, so they had dated quite a while before they married.\n\nIn the Denver area, Jim Smith was a painter, by trade, and painted many houses inside and out. Mom and Dad had hired him several times to paint the inside of our big two-story home over the years when we lived there. He loved to fish. He and I used to go down to our ponds located in the pasture near Boulder Creek. We would fish for Crappie, Blue Gills, and Sun fish. Most weren’t worth the effort to clean and cook so we tossed them back and did it just for fun. Occasionally, we would catch some nice bass in those ponds. He loved to go to the mountains and fish the lakes and rivers near Grand Lake, Granby, and Hot Sulphur Springs. He was always a pleasant sort of a fellow. They bought the little house on 75th in Arvada. Later, he added a garage and then eventually added on a porch and then another bedroom. They lived fairly quiet lives, I think. They made many trips to Granby to visit Aunt Elaine and often came to our house for Sunday dinner and sometimes for Holiday dinners. Grandma Grace was quite religious. I remember Grandpa Jim smoking a pipe, and I think he smoked cigarettes, too, but I can’t remember for sure.\n\nGrandma Grace always said she was Pennsylvania Dutch. For years, I didn’t know why she said that until I started researching our family history. I knew they had originated in Germany and Switzerland. When the Kaufman and Brenneman families came to Pennsylvania, they spoke German. People mistakenly took the German word Deutsch to be Dutch, but it simply referred to the German language they spoke. But, even knowing this, the term “Pennsylvania Dutch” continued to be used. Mostly, it refers to the Amish, Mennonites, Swiss Germans, and people of the Lower Palatinate, which is in Southeast Germany between Luxemburg and the Rhine River. Most were Lutherans or Reformed Church, and many were Anabaptists. This is another history lesson entirely that I will not expand on at this time.\n\nFor a couple of years, when my brother David and I were growing up, Grandma Grace would give us a little box of chocolate covered peanuts or chocolate covered raisins for Christmas. We were so happy to get them but always knew what they were before they were un-wrapped because of the shape of the box and the rattle they made when we shook them. This was a rare occasion because Grandma Grace had little to live on and had many grandchildren. This was also true of my paternal grandmother, Emma. It was impossible for grandparents, in those days, to give gifts at Christmas or birthdays. Quite different than today.\n\nJim (Val) Smith and Grace Lentz – 1940 Jim and Grace Smith at Arvada home\n\nGrace and Jim Smith at backdoor of Arvada home\n\nGrandma Grace grew amazing flowers at her home. I always loved going there, but we were forbidden to walk in the flower beds or pick any of the flowers unless she picked them for us. Beds and beds of colorful blooms such as pansies, iris, chrysanthemums, zinnias, tulips, crocus, daffodils, and daisies, plus many that I can’t remember, but most especially her roses. She had all types of roses including the climbing rose featured in the previous picture. She even had one bed of wild flowers that she grew every year. What a beautiful sight! She most definitely had the green thumb when it came to her flowers outside and her indoor plants. I have a lot of pictures of Grandma Grace in her flower gardens, but they are all black and white so the beauty is kind of lost.\n\nGrandma Grace and Grandpa Jim Smith – 1961\n\nThis Picture Says, “Nurse Grace, National Jewish Home” – 1942\n\nJames Valentine Smith – WW I Registration Card – 1917\n\nGrace Lentz – 1920 – O’Neill, NE\n\nGrace Lentz and Elaine Bathrick\n\nGrace Kaufman Lentz Smith 1891 – 1971 Grace and Jim Smith – 1971\n\nOpal, Elaine, and Violet Lentz – About 1917\n\nBathing Beauties at Sunset Park Pool – Longmont, CO\n\nViolet, Elaine, and Betty\n\nJohn Lentz and Grace Kaufman Lentz (Smith) had four daughters:\n\nOpal Margaret Lentz March 1, 1912 – Oct 21, 1938\n\nViolet Marion Lentz Jan 16, 1914 – March 9, 1999 (*My Mother)\n\nElaine Victoria Lentz April 12, 1915 – Dec 3, 2004\n\nBetty Jayne Lentz Dec 29, 1921 – Feb 15, 1995\n\n*******************\n\nOPAL MARGARET LENTZ 1912 – 1938 WILLIAM CARL HAUSSLER 1902- 1972\n\nOpal Margaret was born March 1, 1912 in Gregory, SD and died of complications of childbirth with their fourth child on Oct 21, 1938 in Cambridge, NE. I believe after Opal’s death, since the children were small, that Bill’s mother, Grandma Haussler, helped take care of the children. She sewed the girls’ dresses and taught them things that their mother would have, had she lived. Often, as Jeanne grew older, the responsibility of the younger two fell on her shoulders. She would miss out on the usual teenage things and had to grow to adulthood early in life. Bill was a farmer, and in addition to that, had to raise his children as a widower, but he still found time to write some poetry. I will be including some later on in this section. Bill was very diligent about keeping in contact with my mom, Violet, his late wife’s sister. He sent pictures which helped my mom walk through the stages of the children’s lives to adulthood. The kids continued corresponding with my mom and kept her informed of their families. Bill came to Colorado several times and visited. He was always so enjoyable to be around and talk to. Speaking of corresponding, things were very different back them. Folks would wait for weeks for a card or letter to come, and postcards were the thing then! They didn’t have all the social media we have now to keep up on what someone is doing or to download pictures of their grandchildren or a niece or nephew. They would not have been able to have imagined the technology and the advantages that we have today.\n\nOpal Margaret Lentz\n\nIN MEMORY OF Opal\n\nIt will be a year now\n\nDeath came and knocked on your door\n\nAnd took away a loved one so dear\n\nThat left your hearts broken and sore.\n\nAnd though you are sad and lonely\n\nShe is happy there on that beautiful shore,\n\nPerhaps you’ve packed and put away\n\nAll her pictures and other things\n\nThat belonged to her those few short years.\n\nAnd as you look upon them your\n\nEyes are filled with tears\n\nAnd you think your heart will surely break.\n\nShe is now a beautiful angel\n\nAnd walks by a crystal lake.\n\nOn her feet are sandals of silver\n\nHer garments are pure and white\n\nOn her head rests a golden crown\n\nSet with gems that sparkle so bright\n\nIn her hand she holds a magic wand\n\nGiven her by an angel called Love.\n\nAnd with it she will beckon you\n\nTo come, live with her in that city above.\n\nIt’s there she will meet you and greet you\n\nOn that bright and happy day\n\nWhen all your cares and sorrows\n\nHave completely passed away.\n\nThere she will take you by the hand\n\nAnd lead you into the promise land\n\nAnd show you a beautiful mansion on that evergreen shore\n\nWhere you’ll dwell with her forever\n\nAnd part from her no more.\n\n~ By Minnie Belle Kaufman Skinner, 1939\n\nMRS.

It was the first time I had been out of state. We had gone there to attend my cousin Janice’s wedding. I was in awe of Jeanne, Janice, and Louis. I remember, since they milked cows as we did, that the cows needed to be brought in for the milking, so Louis asked me if I would like to go along. Of course, I jumped at the chance and went along with him. While we were gathering the cows, he told me to watch out for that old black and white bull and if the bull decided to chase us, I was to go under the nearby fence. Thank goodness that didn’t happen, but I was kind of scared. I had not been allowed to go out among the milk cows yet, on our own farm, so I thought I was doing something big. We spent the night there since the wedding was the next day. The next morning, I asked Louis where he had slept, and he told me the bathtub. I mentioned that to my cousin Jeanne some years later, and she said that they didn’t even have a bathtub yet at that time. Guess Louis pulled one over on me. They had a nice, typical, two-story farm house on their farm. While we were in Nebraska, we visited many relatives, though I cannot remember who they were. At one place, I was astonished to see these little lights floating through the air, and I asked about it and was told that they were fireflies. Someone caught a couple in a jar so that I could see them. I had never seen anything like that before as it would be unusual to see them in Colorado. One home we visited, the nice lady there gave me this little rectangular pillow and the top cover of it was done with sewn yo-yos. Very neat, and I still have it today. I am still wondering who that lady was. I think her name was Rebecca. Perhaps my Great Grandpa Vincent’s second wife.

Ralph had only one sister, Clara.\n\nHe attended school in Nebraska. In his early years, he rode his horse (Pet) to school. He finished his education in Holbrook, Nebraska. Ralph married Elaine Lentz on August 15th, 1933. They were married 71 years and had three children: daughter Bonnie Measham and sons Don and Frank.\n\nRalph had many different jobs in his lifetime. He did chores at home and for his neighbors. He drove mules to haul for a new bridge. He delivered ice, shucked corn, hauled grain and logs from Colorado, fed sheep and cattle, worked in a flour mill, farmed, ran a dairy, and worked on the Big Thompson Project in Grand Lake, Colorado. He also worked on the Green Mountain Dam in Heeney, Colorado. Worked at a Coal Mine, a Monument company and built houses. He owned and operated Bathrick Plumbing Company for 13 years and did maintenance on batteries and forklifts for A G Groceries. At the age of 62, he worked on a drilling rig for Bathrick & Company for 12 years.\n\nDuring the time he lived in Granby, Ralph served on the School Board, helped the Boy Scouts, and taught Sunday school.

Since other relatives were also visiting for the graduation, I stayed at Ralph’s parents’ home, which was only a block away from Uncle Ralph and Aunt Elaine’s. They had a neat couch that was a hideaway bed. It was a fun weekend. Frank and Bessie Bathrick were wonderful hosts. I didn’t know Frank Sr. well but got to know Bessie in later years, and she was always very good to me as if I was a granddaughter. She was a wonderful person, and I enjoyed her company very much. When she got ill and was confined to a nursing home in Boulder, Colorado, I went to visit her often.\n\nI always thought of Uncle Ralph and Aunt Elaine as modern people. I don’t know why I thought that. Maybe it was because they were always traveling and doing things. My folks were pretty much tied down to the farm and ranch, so we didn’t get away much. They were always taking a trip here or there for their “Second Honeymoon.” That amused me, but they enjoyed their travels very much.\n\nRalph and Elaine loved to square dance and Ralph called for a lot of square dances all over the country and was very good at it.\n\nWhen Ralph and Elaine lived in Longmont, Ralph, his father Frank, and my dad got jobs working on the Green Mountain Dam at Heeney, Colorado just South of Kremling. Ralph also worked in a coal mine while they lived in Longmont. They lived in Hot Sulphur Springs, Co where he managed a dairy farm. They also lived in Grand Lake, where Ralph worked as a plumber. After the Bathrick family moved to Granby, CO, Ralph bought a plumbing company, which he named the Ralph Bathrick Plumbing and Heating Co. After retirement, they moved back to the Denver area and then on to sunny Arizona where they lived in Mesa until their deaths. I visited their home a couple of time when they lived in the Denver area. I remember Ralph had tiled a unique entry way into the home by imbedding silver dollars in the tiles. Very neat!\n\nRalph was a big teaser and sometimes embarrassed me, but when they visited, it was good times, and I enjoyed playing with my cousin Frankie because he was nearest to my age. Oftentimes, we would enjoy Thanksgiving feasts together or sometimes just a Sunday dinner. We played around the farm and if my Dad had a stack of straw bales, we managed to make some neat forts. Sometimes, we would ride the ponies and play cowboys and Indians. We also played in the silos if they were empty at the time. We thrived on doing just typical kid stuff.\n\nThe Bathrick Family\n\nBessie and Frank Bathrick\n\n(Ralph’s Parents)\n\nBessie and Frank Bathrick were Ralph Bathrick’s parents. The Bathricks’, Lentz’s and Gibsons’ all knew each other and/or were neighbors in Nebraska.\n\nBessie and Frank Bathrick’s 50th Wedding Anniversary\n\nI am not sure of the date of this newspaper article is, but this article tells some information about Ralph’s life.\n\nI have no date when this was in the newspaper.\n\nChristmas – 1946 – Longmont, CO\n\nBack Row: Bessie and Frank Bathrick, Ralph, Grandma Grace, Jim Smith and Hugh\n\nFront Row: Don, Frankie, Bonnie, Gary, Violet, with Karen and Jackie\n\nLongmont Picnic – 1948\n\nBack Row: Hugh, Grace, Jim Smith, Ralph with Frank, Betty\n\nFront Row: Elaine, Vie with Karen, Jack, Don, Carolyn, Johnnie, and Gary\n\nElaine, Betty, Grandma Grace, and Bessie Bathrick\n\nBETTY JAYNE LENTZ 1921 – 1995 HAROLD LAVERNE SHRIVER 1916 – 1983\n\nBetty Jayne Lentz was born on Dec 29, 1921 in Holbrook, NE, and passed away Feb 15, 1995 in Pueblo, CO. Betty married Harold LaVerne Shriver on June 6, 1940, in Longmont, Colorado at the Evangelical Messiah Lutheran Church on Francis Street. It was our family church for many years. Harold was born Sept 7, 1916 in green City, MO, and died Nov 9, 1983 in Pueblo, CO.\n\nBetty Jayne Lentz\n\nBetty Jayne – 4 years old\n\nUncle Harold was a soft spoken and mild-mannered man. He always thought a bit before he answered a question and spoke slowly. I don’t think I ever saw him angry in all the years I knew him. Back in about 1961, I had gone to the State Fair in Pueblo, CO on a 4-H trip. On the day I got ready to leave on the train, Uncle Harold took off work to come down and see me off.\n\nBetty Jayne Lentz – Age 16 Betty Jayne Lentz\n\nBetty with Two of the Lambs Betty – Age "
