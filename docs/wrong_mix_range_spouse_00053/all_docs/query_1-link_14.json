        "text": "Hey LinkedIn network! I am looking for two things... can you help? üëÄ 1. Advice / support as I seek more regular employment after 10 years of freelancing. I‚Äôm looking for a part-time role that uses my skills well, ideally in something that creates positive change in the world. My strengths lie in relationship-building, workshop / event design and facilitation, creative problem solving / idea generation, writing / language‚Ä¶ and as a self-employed person I‚Äôm an excellent generalist / good at the admin. I could do with support in figuring out what sort of companies / jobs I‚Äôm suited to, and how to best present myself / my CV. I‚Äôm excited and enthusiastic about bringing my energy and talents to an organisation! ü§© I imagine this might be something a recruitment specialist could help with. Is this you, or someone you know? 2. More opportunities to facilitate groups in contexts I am inexperienced in, particularly in business / corporate settings. I am particularly open to shadowing / assisting / learning from facilitators working in these spaces - need someone to bring you coffee and help with hand-outs? My facilitation experience is largely around creativity (especially writing / performing) and communication skills (often based on Authentic Relating principles), though I have recently started working more with wellbeing / reflective practices. Much of this has been in Universities, science, heritage, schools. I‚Äôm ready to step into learning and developing as a professional! üí™ I imagine this might speak to a fellow facilitator, workshop leader, team builder, trainer, if you work with HR departments‚Ä¶ Is this you, or someone you know? Please do reply / drop me a DM if anything sparks from this - and sharing would be appreciated so I can reach a wider network! Pic: it‚Äôs this guy you‚Äôd be helping out ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nThe more I work with AI, the clearer it is that the phrase \"artificial intelligence\" is a misnomer. \"AIs\" lack key attributes of human intelligence. They have no sentience, autonomy, theory of mind, or mental models. No AI is \"reading\" this. AIs can't *read*. What \"AIs\" *can* do is mimic all of those things very convincingly through unprecedented text processing capabilities. They're powerful per se ‚Äî and can lead you to bad conclusions. If you find yourself anthropomorphizing \"AI,\" you've bought into a line of patter that will sink you. Because these are neither scary omnipotent entities nor the answer to all our problems. They are tools. It behooves you to understand them so you can put them to good use. #AI #GenAI #ArtificialIntelligence #LLM"
