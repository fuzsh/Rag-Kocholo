There are many options for business insurance, and I’m happy to help you understand your options.\n\nIs your garden hose long enough to reach any area of your property? Simple considerations like this can help you get prepared for wildfire season.\n\n18. Before you shave your long-haired pup’s fur, consider this: all that fur can insulate against heat. Cutting it close to the skin can also lead to sunburns or skin cancer. Consider a trim (and maybe an inflatable doggie pool), instead. farme.rs/aspca_hotweather\n\nI’m ready to dig into Spring, and April is Lawn and Garden Month. What are you planting this year?\n\nKeep your business fresh as a daisy. If a power outage or busted refrigeration system (or other mechanical breakdown) could spoil your inventory, we offer coverage that can help you get up and running again. Call me to learn more.\n\nNo place outside is safe during a thunderstorm. When thunder roars go indoors and stay inside for at least 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder. farme.rs/LightingTips\n\nRenters insurance might be more affordable than you think. If your belongings are damaged in a covered incident, the landlord’s insurance most likely won’t cover the cost to replace them. I’m here to help if you have questions."
