        "text": "Cornell Mathematics Professors and their graduate students before 1940\n\nThe Mathematics graduate program at Cornell owes much to the vision and leadership of James Edward Oliver. His teacher, Benjamin Peirce, always said that \"Jimmy Oliver was the best mathematician who had ever come under his notice.\"\n\nThis page provides, for each mathematics faculty who did advised graduate students, the complete list of the Cornell mathematics Ph.D.s they supervised. Only those faculty all of whose Cornell students obtained their Ph.D. before 1940 are included here. Except for James Oliver who come first, the faculty are listed in decreasing order of the number of Ph.D.s earned under their supervision. Two faculty, Ralph Agnew and Burton Wadsworth Jones, advised graduate students at Cornell both before and after 1940 and are not listed here. The years given for each faculty are the years of appointment at Cornell (not including emeritus appointment).\n\nJames Edward Oliver, 1871-1895\n\n1886 Hiram John Messenger, Modern Methods in Geometric Conics.\n\n1888 Cadwallader Edwards Linthicum, On the Rectification of Certain Curves, and Certain Series Involved.\n\n1893 Ida Metcalf, Geometric Duality in Space.\n\n1894 Annie Louise McKinnon, Concomitant Binary Forms in Terms of the Roots.\n\n1895 Agnes Sime Baxter, On Abelian Integrals, a Resume of Neumann’s ‘Abelsche Integrele’ with Comments and Applications.\n\nVirgil Snyder, 1895-1938 (43 Ph.D.s)\n\n1902 Peter Field, On the Forms of Unicursal Quintic Curves.\n\n1904 Clarence Lemuel Elisha Moore, On the Classification of the Surfaces of Singularities of the Quadratic Spherical Complex.\n\n1906 Oscar Perry Akers, On the Congruence of Axes in a Bundle of Linear Line Complexes.\n\n1906 Elmer Clifford Colpitts, On Twisted Quintic Curves.\n\n1906 Charles Herschel Sisam, On the Classification of Scrolls of Order Seven Having a Rectilinear Directrix.\n\n1908 Anna Lavinia Van Benschoten, The Birational Transformation of Algebraic Curves of Genus Four.\n\n1909 Joseph Vance McKelvey, The Groups of Birational Transformations of Algebraic Curves of Genus 5.\n\n1910 Helen Brewster Owens, Conjugate Line Congruences of the Third Order Defined by a Family of Quadrics.\n\n1911 Paul Prentice Boyd, On the Perspective Jonquieres Involutions Associated with the (2, 1) Ternary Correspondence.\n\n1912 Frank Millett Morgan, Involutorial Transformations.\n\n1914 Anna Helen Tappan, Plane Sextic Curves Invariant Under Birational Transformations.\n\n1915 Lewis Clark Cox, The Finite Groups of Birational Transformations of a Net of Cubics.\n\n1916 Joseph Vital DePorte, Irrational Involutions on Algebraic Curves.\n\n1917 Temple Rice Hollcroft, A Classification of General (2,3) Point Correspondences Between Two Planes.\n\n1917 Anna Mayme Howe, The Classification of Plane Involutions of Order 3.\n\n1923 Jesse Otto Osborn, A Study of the Rational Involutorial Transformations in Space Which Leave a Web of Sextic Surfaces Invariant.\n\n1924 Marian Marsh Torrey, Classifications of Monoidal Involutions Having a Fixed Tangent Cone.\n\n1926 Fay Farnum, On Triadic Cremona Nets of Plane Curves.\n\n1927 Hazel Edith Schoonmaker, (later, Wilson), Non-Monoidal Involutions Having a Congruence of Invariant Conics.\n\n1927 Howard Conway Shaub, Rational Involutorial Transformations in S(4) Which Leave Invariant Four-Fold-Infinity Quadric Varieties.\n\n1928 Hannibal Albert Davis, Involutorial Transformations Belonging to a Linear Complex.\n\n1930 Leaman Andrew Dye, Involutorial Transformations in S(3) of Order n with an n-1 Fold Line.\n\n1930 Ethel Isabel Moody, A Cremona Group of Order Thirty-two of Cubic Transformations in Three-Dimensional Space.\n\n1931 Evelyn Teresa Carroll (later, Rusk), Systems of Involutorial Birational Transformations Contained Multiply in Special Linear Line Complexes.\n\n1931 Horace Newton Hubbs, Analytic Study of Rational Quintic Surfaces Having No Multiple Curves.\n\n1931 William Robert Hutcherson, Maps of Certain Cyclic Involutions on Two Dimensional Carriers.\n\n1931 Charles Chapman Torrance, On plane Cremona Triadic Characteristics.\n\n1932 Amos Hale Black, Types of Involutorial Space Transformations Associated with Certain Rational Curves.\n\n1932 John Montgomery Clarkson, Some Involutorial Line Transformations Interpreted as Points of V(2) of S(5).\n\n1932 Ira Owen Horsfall, Transformations Associated with the Lines of a Cubic, Quadratic or Linear Complex.\n\n1932 Edwin Joseph Purcell, Involutorial Space Cremona Transformations Determined by Non-Linear Null Reciprocities.\n\n1932 August Sisk, The Plane Symmetric Quintic Cremona Involutions.\n\n1933 Helen Schlauch Adams (later., Infeld), On the Normal Rational n-ic.\n\n1933 Roberta Frances Johnson, Involutions of Order 2 Associated with Surfaces of Genera P_A=P_G=0,P_2=P_3=0.\n\n1934 John Albert Hayden, The Weddle and Kummer Surfaces for Restricted Positions of Six Base Points.\n\n1934 Gertrude K.
