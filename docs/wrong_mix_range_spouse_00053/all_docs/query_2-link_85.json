        "text": "In honor of the three-year anniversary of our first online event, we are proud to release the recording of The Oedipus Project! Watch the full recording through the link in our bio. The premiere took place on Zoom at 7pm EDT on May 7, 2020 and featured Oscar Isaac, Frances McDormand, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Frankie Faison, David Strathairn, Marjolaine Goldsmith, Glenn Davis, and NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams performing Sophocles' Oedipus the King from their homes as a catalyst for a powerful, facilitated conversation about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon diverse communities throughout the United States and the world. Sophocles’ play is a timeless story of arrogant leadership, ignored prophecy, and a pestilence that ravages the city of Thebes. At the time it was first performed, in 429 BC, the Athenian audience would have been reeling in the wake of a plague and its economic, political, and social aftermath. Seen through this lens, Oedipus the King seems as relevant now as it was in its own time.\n\nThe premiere of The Oedipus Project was attended by more than 15,000 people from more than 40 countries, who—at the height of the global lockdown—were hungry for community and connection. In the three years that have followed, Theater of War Productions has presented more than 100 virtual events, reaching more than 300,000 people from more than 100 countries, spanning all seven continents. This paradigm-shifting use of technology, strategized by Marjolaine Goldsmith, in service of direct, unmediated dialogue—across borders and boundaries—has been nothing short of revolutionary for the company and its ability to touch people all over the world, lift them out of isolation, and bring them into healing dialogue.\n\nWatch the Oedipus Project: Climate Crisis trailer.\n\nThe Oedipus Project presents acclaimed actors reading scenes from Sophocles’ Oedipus the King on Zoom as a catalyst for powerful, constructive, global conversations about climate change, ecological disaster, and environmental justice. Sophocles’ ancient play, first performed in 429 BC, just after a plague that killed nearly one-third of the Athenian population, is a story of arrogant leadership, ignored prophecy, intergenerational curses, willful blindness, and a pestilence and ecological collapse that ravages the archaic city of Thebes. Seen through this lens, Oedipus the King appears to have been a powerful tool for helping Athenians communalize trauma and loss, while interrogating their own complicit role in the suffering, not just of those around them but of generations to come.\n\nThis event was presented as part of the Nobel Prize Summit: Our Planet, Our Future, hosted by the Nobel Foundation and organized by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in partnership with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research/Stockholm Resilience Centre/Beijer Institute. Thousands of audience members tuned in from 82 countries to participate in a global discussion.\n\nThis event featured performances by Bill Murray (Lost in Translation), Corey Hawkins (Straigt Outta Compton), Frances McDormand (Nomadland), Jeffrey Wright (Westworld), Frankie Faison (The Wire), David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck), Marjolaine Goldsmith (Company Manager of Theater of War Productions), and Jumaane Williams (New York City Public Advocate), and a Chorus of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, including Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn and Dr. Harold Varmus.\n\nBryan Doerries facilitates the discussions with panelists:\n\nPaulette Soltani, Political Director, VOCAL-NY is recognized for her work across New York City in affordable housing and homelessness. She has been an outspoken critic of the way homeless individuals are treated - or not - and most recently how vulnerable they are during this pandemic. VOCAL-NY is a statewide membership organization that focuses on low-income people affected by various social ills.\n\nJo-Ann Yoo, Executive Director of the Asian-American Federation. The organization was established in 1989 and represents a network of community service agencies including health and human services, education and economic development. Jo-Ann has been outspoken about discrimination faced by the Asian American community in the face of COVID 19. As you know the Asian American community (here in NY) have some of the lowest infection and death rates from the disease. Jo-Ann has been appointed to the State task force on re-opening New York.\n\nDr. Robert Gore, has been treating COVID-19 patients as an emergency room attending physician at NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County and SUNY Downstate Medical Center (where he is also a faculty member). He is the founder of the Kings Against Violence Initiative (KAVI) which earned him recognition as a CNN Hero, entry into the Presidential Leadership Scholars Program, and other awards. He founded the SUNY Downstate Medical Center Minority Medical Student Emergency Medicine (MMSEM) Summer Fellowship - a mentoring program for underrepresented minorities in medicine. He has also worked in disaster zones in Haiti. Dr Gore was raised in Brooklyn, he and his wife reside in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of the borough.\n\nAnthony Almojera, Vice President of the EMS Officers Union. 42 years old and Born and raised in Brooklyn New York. Have lived Montana and California in early 20s and traveled to 90 countries. Majored in theatre and political science in Brooklyn college. A NYC paramedic working with FDNY EMS since 2004 and currently a lieutenant with EMS and work out of EMS station 40 in sunset park Brooklyn.\n\nAudience members Frernanda, Hui Li.\n\nThis special collaboration between Theater of War Productions and the PBS series Poetry in America presented readings by the actors Bill Murray (Lost in Translation) and Moses Ingram (The Queen’s Gambit) of Robert Hayden's 1960s sonnet “Those Winter Sundays,” as a catalyst for a powerful, guided discussion about the everyday struggle of surviving, thriving, and connecting during this incredibly difficult winter. The event also featured a recorded reading of Hayden's poem by President Joe Biden, helping frame crucial dialogue between diverse communities about economic hardship, family dynamics, parenting, domestic violence, racism, and American identity during this divided and fractured time. Using the poem to build bridges and create a vocabulary for talking about the challenges before us and within our homes, Those Winter Sundays aims to foster compassion, understanding, healing, and resilience.\n\nFacilitated by Bryan Doerries and Elisa New.\n\nFeaturing the following panelists:\n\nKaren Bailey, Teacher, Flint, MI\n\nAnthony Almojera, EMS Officer FDNY\n\nManasi Garg, National Student Poet, Saratoga, CA\n\nAl-Tabar Hudgins, RISE Project Uptown Coordinator, NYC\n\nNathalie Arzu, RISE Project Uptown Program Manger\n\nThe cast of the premiere of An Enemy of The People: A Public Health Project featured performances by David Strathairn (Nomadland), Frankie Faison (The Wire), Kathryn Erbe (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), Peter Francis James (Oz), Jay O.

The singers and musicians featured in this video include educators, students, activists, social workers, members of the faith community, and police officers from St. Louis and New York City who have made the commitment to sing together in order to start powerful, uncomfortable, transformative discussions about race and gender-based violence.\n\nThe song, “I’m Covered,” written by Phil Woodmore for the project Antigone in Ferguson, is a healing hymn that comes at the end of the play as a collective response to the violence, outrage, division, and grief that precedes it. \"Every night that we sing 'I’m Covered' at the end of the play,” said Ms. Blaylock, “it’s my way of covering my student Michael Brown.” We hope that in watching this video, you feel covered, if not by a higher power, then by the humanity, spirit, and hope at the center of the song.\n\nWe offer “I’m Covered” for interpretation and discussion, with the hope that it will comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nTheater of War Productions\n\nSpecial thanks to our partners the Brooklyn Public Library @bplpresentsand the Stavros Niarchos Foundation @snforg.\n\nTheater of War Productions is honored to share this virtual offering, performed by the Antigone in Ferguson Choir, directed by composer Dr. Philip Woodmore, and led by John Leggette. The singers and musicians featured in this video include educators, students, activists, social workers, members of the faith community, and police officers from St. Louis, Missouri; Richmond, Virginia; and New York City who have made the commitment to sing together in order to start powerful, uncomfortable, transformative discussions about systemic oppression.\n\nThe song, “Be Steadfast,” written by Dr. Philip Woodmore for the project The Drum Major Instinct, is a powerful call to action at the end of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s sermon that serves as a collective response to King’s interrogation of racism, capitalism, militarism, white supremacy, and injustice. Dr. Edwina Moss, personal secretary and friend to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., responded to our project at a performance in Baltimore, Maryland in 2018, saying, \"Be uncomfortable. It's all right to be uncomfortable. But if we're on this planet, and if we don't open the conversation, we will perish on this planet.”\n\nWe offer “Be Steadfast” for interpretation and discussion, with the hope that it will comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable"
