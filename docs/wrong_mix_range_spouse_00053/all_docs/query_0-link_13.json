        "text": "American actor (born 1988)\n\nJesse Plemons ( ; born April 2, 1988)[1][2][3] is an American actor. He began his career as a child actor and achieved a breakthrough with his role as Landry Clarke in the NBC drama series Friday Night Lights (2006–2011). He subsequently portrayed Todd Alquist in season 5 of the AMC crime drama series Breaking Bad (2012–2013) and its sequel film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019). For his role as Ed Blumquist in season 2 of the FX anthology series Fargo (2015), he received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination and won a Critics' Choice Television Award.[3] He received a second Emmy nomination for his performance in \"USS Callister\", an episode of the Netflix anthology series Black Mirror (2017).\n\nPlemons has acted in supporting roles in film such as The Master (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015), Game Night (2018), The Irishman (2019), Judas and the Black Messiah (2021) and Killers of the Flower Moon (2023). He starred in Other People (2016) and I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020). For playing a rancher in The Power of the Dog (2021), he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and for playing three roles in the anthology film Kinds of Kindness (2024), he won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPlemons was born in Dallas, Texas,[4] and raised in Mart, Texas, near Waco.[3] He has an older sister, Jill.[5][time needed]\n\nIn 2007, Plemons graduated from the Texas Tech University Independent School District, a distance learning program, which allowed him to earn his high school diploma.[6] He attended schools in Mart, playing football in middle school, junior high, and at Mart High School, until he received more acting jobs and shifted to the online program.[7]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1991–2006: Early career\n\n[edit]\n\nPlemons got his start in a Coca-Cola commercial at age 3. When he was 8, he started doing extra work, and, with the support of his family, spent time auditioning in Los Angeles and landing small jobs.[8] After appearing in the films Varsity Blues (1999) and All the Pretty Horses (2000), and guest-starring on Walker, Texas Ranger and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Plemons' first prominent role was in the film Children on their Birthdays (2002).[9] He later appeared in Like Mike (2002) and When Zachary Beaver Came to Town (2003), with guest roles on the television series Judging Amy, The Lyon's Den, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and Grey's Anatomy between 2003 and 2006.[9]\n\n2006–2011: Breakthrough with Friday Night Lights\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2006, when he was 18, Plemons joined the ensemble cast of NBC's television series Friday Night Lights, filmed in Austin, Texas, detailing the fictional events surrounding a high school football team in fictional Dillon, Texas. In the show's first season, his character Landry Clarke provided comic relief as the best friend of football quarterback Matt Saracen, though Landry himself was not on the team.[10] Among the cast and crew, the joke was that Plemons played football better than most of the other actors, even though his character was one of the few who did not play.[10]\n\nLandry joined the Panthers football team in the second season, and Plemons, having played high school football, told director Jeffrey Reiner that he would do his own stunts.[11] In his first football scene, Landry had to \"get the crap beat out of [him] over and over and over again\".[11] When hit by co-star Taylor Kitsch (playing Tim Riggins) Plemons' chin split open, requiring eleven stitches.[11] The show, a fan and critic favorite, ended after five seasons after shifting to DirecTV in 2011.[12]\n\nIn 2012, Plemons reunited with Kitsch and Friday Night Lights creator Peter Berg in the film Battleship.[5] Berg, who directed the film, explained that he knew how comfortable Kitsch was with Plemons: \"I know that he's really good for Taylor and he makes Taylor better. So, I wrote that whole part for Jesse. I never thought of it as a Friday Night Lights reunion. I thought of it as protection, bringing a trusted family member in.\"[13]\n\n2011–2019: Character work\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, Plemons portrayed Todd Alquist[14] during the final season of the AMC drama series Breaking Bad.[15][16] He was a recurring cast member in Season 5A and was promoted to series regular for Season 5B.[17][18] Fans of Breaking Bad nicknamed him \"Meth Damon\", due to Plemons' resemblance to actor Matt Damon.[19][7][8][20] One of his first film roles, at age 12, was playing the younger version of Damon's character in the film All the Pretty Horses (2000).\n\nIn 2012, Plemons also had a supporting role in the Paul Thomas Anderson drama The Master as the son of Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, an actor to whom his physical appearance has been compared. In January 2014, Plemons was in consideration to be one of the new stars of Star Wars Episode VII (Star Wars: The Force Awakens).[21][22] In March 2014, Plemons, along with four other actors, were being considered for the lead role of Finn in Episode VII.[23] The role, however, went to British actor John Boyega. Plemons played mobster Kevin Weeks in the Boston-set mob film Black Mass, starring Johnny Depp, which opened in theaters in September 2015. Also that year, he appeared in the Stephen Frears film about Lance Armstrong, The Program, and the Steven Spielberg film Bridge of Spies.\n\nIn late-2015, Plemons co-starred in the second season of the TV show Fargo.[3] He portrayed Ed Blumquist, a butcher and the husband of Peggy Blumquist (Kirsten Dunst).[24] For his performance, he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.[25] In 2016, Plemons starred in the film Other People. In 2017, he appeared in the Doug Liman thriller film American Made, the Scott Cooper western Hostiles, and Steven Spielberg's historical drama The Post.\n\nIn December 2017, Plemons appeared in \"USS Callister\", an episode in the fourth series of the anthology show Black Mirror. Plemons played Robert Daly, the episode's main character and a sadistic introvert, and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. In 2018, Plemons had supporting roles in two films, the comedy Game Night and Adam McKay's Dick Cheney biopic Vice, which he narrated. In 2019 he had a supporting role in the Martin Scorsese crime drama The Irishman, which premiered at the New York Film Festival on September 27, 2019. He also reprised his role as Todd Alquist in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.\n\n2020–present: Career expansion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, Plemons received critical praise and a Gotham Independent Film Award nomination for Best Actor for his lead performance in Charlie Kaufman's psychological drama I'm Thinking of Ending Things.[26] In 2021, Plemons gave supporting performances in Judas and the Black Messiah, a film about civil rights activist Fred Hampton[27][28] and the Disney adventure film Jungle Cruise.[29] In the same year, Plemons starred in the supernatural horror film Antlers, again collaborating with director Scott Cooper,[30] and starred once again alongside his real life partner and Fargo co-star Kirsten Dunst in Jane Campion's western drama The Power of the Dog,[31] for which he has received praise and a number of accolades, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2022, Plemons starred in Charlie McDowell's noir thriller Windfall, which also marked his first credit as a producer.[32] It was about this time Plemons noted that the number of people referring to him by his nickname \"Meth Damon\" had started to decline.[33]\n\nIn 2023, Plemons starred alongside Elizabeth Olsen in the HBO Max true crime series Love & Death[34] and reunited with Martin Scorsese for a supporting role in his western-thriller Killers of the Flower Moon, which he starred in alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro.[35] The film premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. In September 2022, Plemons was announced to be starring alongside Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley in Yorgos Lanthimos's film Kinds of Kindness,[36] which premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, where Plemons won the Best Actor award.[37]\n\nPlemons will next play a supporting role in the Robert De Niro led Netflix political thriller series Zero Day, which will reunite him with Love and Death director Lesli Linka Glatter.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPlemons is married to fellow actor Kirsten Dunst since 2022. He began a relationship with his Fargo co-star in March 2016,[38] and the two got engaged a year later.[39] The couple welcomed their first son born in 2018[40] and their second son born in 2021.[41] In February 2022, Plemons and Dunst were both nominated for Academy Awards for their roles in The Power of the Dog.[42] They were officially married in July of that year.[43]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1998 Finding North Hobo 1999 Varsity Blues Tommy Harbor 2000 All the Pretty Horses Young John Grady Cole 2002 Children on Their Birthdays Preacher Star Like Mike Ox 2003 When Zachary Beaver Came to Town Jay The Failures Boe 2008 The Flyboys Bully No. 1 2009 Observe and Report Charles Shrink Jesus 2010 Happiness Runs Chad Meeting Spencer Spencer West 2011 Paul Jake 2012 The Master Val Dodd Battleship Jimmy \"Ordy\" Ord 2014 The Homesman Garn Sours Flutter David 2015 Black Mass Kevin Weeks The Program Floyd Landis Bridge of Spies Joe Murphy 2016 Other People David Mulcahey 2017 The Discovery Toby Harbor American Made Sheriff Joe Downing Hostiles Lieutenant Rudy Kidder The Post Roger Clark 2018 Game Night Gary Kingsbury Vice Kurt 2019 The Irishman Chuckie O'Brien El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie Todd Alquist 2020 Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short Short film I'm Thinking of Ending Things Jake 2021 Judas and the Black Messiah Roy Mitchell Jungle Cruise Prince Joachim The Power of the Dog George Burbank Antlers Sheriff Paul Meadows 2022 Windfall CEO Also producer 2023 Killers of the Flower Moon Tom White 2024 Civil War Militiaman Uncredited cameo[44] Kinds of Kindness Robert, Daniel, Andrew 2025 Bugonia † TBA Filming\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2000 Walker, Texas Ranger Russell, Jr. Episode: \"The General's Return\" 2001 The Guardian Lawrence Neal Episode: \"Paternity\" Sabrina, the Teenage Witch Bigger Kid Episode: \"Really Big Season Opener\" 2003 The Lyon's Den Ray Ferris Episode: \"The Other Side of Caution\" Judging Amy James Franklin Episode: \"Marry, Marry Quite Contrary\" 2004 Huff Dawson James Episode: \"Cold Day in Shanghai\" CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Owen Durbin Episode: \"Down the Drain\" 2006 Grey's Anatomy Jake Burton Episode: \"Yesterday\" NCIS Jason Geckler Episode: \"Deception\" 2006–2011 Friday Night Lights Landry Clarke 59 episodes 2008 Fear Itself Lemmon Episode: \"The Sacrifice\" 2009 Cold Case Ryan Stewart Episode: \"Into the Blue/The Long Blue Line\" 2011 Childrens Hospital Jesse Episode: \"Father's Day\" 2012 Bent Gary 6 episodes 2012–2013 Breaking Bad Todd Alquist 13 episodes 2014, 2016,\n\n2018 Drunk History Various roles 3 episodes 2014 Olive Kitteridge Jerry McCarthy Miniseries; 2 episodes 2015 Fargo Ed Blumquist 10 episodes 2017 No Activity Angus 8 episodes Black Mirror Captain Robert Daly Episode: \"USS Callister\" 2023 Love & Death Allan Gore Miniseries; 7 episodes TBA Zero Day Roger Carlson Upcoming miniseries\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Year Category Title Result Ref.
