THE LEVI KAUFMAN FAMILY

JOHN KAUFMAN 1799 – 1877 CATHARINE BAUGHMAN 1815 – 1896

John Kaufman was born in 1799 and died April 11, 1877, per Find a Grave and his headstone. He is buried in Bethlehem Cemetery, Fulton Co, Pennsylvania. Catharine was born about 1815 and died July 25, 1896 at 81 years of age.

John Kaufman was in the 166th Regular Pennsylvania infantry, CO. B during the Civil War as a Second Lieutenant. Three of his sons were also in the Civil War on the Union side.

LEVI HENRY KAUFMAN 1857 – 1929 MARGARET CATHERINE BRENNEMAN KAUFMAN 1857 – 1925

(Great Grandparents)

Levi Henry Kaufman was born Jan 3, 1857 in Harrisburg, Fulton Co, Pennsylvania. He died March 19, 1929 in Milford, Kansas. When Levi was 19, he moved from Pennsylvania to Illinois. There he met Margaret (Maggie) Brenneman. They were married on December 17, 1878, in Princeton, Illinois. Margaret Catherine Brenneman was born Oct 6, 1857 in Malden, Illinois, and died July 12, 1925 in Harvard, Clay Co, Nebraska. In 1883, they moved to Nebraska to a farm 6 ½ miles NE of Harvard, where they homesteaded. In 1914, they moved to a house in the town of Harvard. They were farmers and members of the Christian Church. Margaret, who went by Maggie, was diabetic and died of heart failure. Maggie was the daughter of Martin Brenneman and Mary Eva Garmon and was the eighth child of ten. Levi and Maggie had eight children.

The following courtesy of Matt and Monica Thompson:

Levi was stern and austere, a hard man for hard times. He did not believe in games, dancing, or card playing, and although he seemed gruff, he gave pennies to the children. He was a large heavy man with a moustache and a deacon in the First Christian Church.

As a homemaker and mother, Maggie was a great family lady, patient and wise, who loved her 24 grandchildren. She belonged to the First Christian Church. She was “quite a gal” and known as a real down-to-earth character with the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon, but not much religion. A granddaughter compiled some 800 of her old proverbs and pithy saying (some unprintable) into a book.

On the 29th of January 1927, Levi married Mrs. Mary Mell of St Joseph, Missouri at Liberty, Missouri. In May of 1928, they moved to Cambridge, Nebraska where they were living at the time of his death. Levi suffered a stroke in 1927, and his health continued to fail after that. Levi died March 19, in the hospital in Milford, Kansas.

Both Maggie and Levi are buried in the Harvard, Nebraska cemetery.

MARGARET KAUFMAN OBITUARY

Harvard newspaper, July 16, 1925

Mrs. Margaret C. Kaufman

Margaret C. Brenneman was born at Malden, Illinois, October 1857 and departed this life in Harvard, July 12, 1925 aged 67 years, 9 months, and six days. She was the daughter of Martin and Mary Brenneman.

On December 17, 1878, at Princeton, Illinois, she was married to Mr. Levi Kaufman, and to this union eight children were born. Three of the children have preceded the mother: Mrs. Lizzie Carlson in 1904; Benjamin Kaufman in 1920; and one child in infancy. The living children are: Mrs. Annie Hiatt, Mrs. Minnie Skinner, Mr. Winfield Kaufman of Harvard, Mrs. Grace Lentz of Holbrook, NE, and Mrs. Blanche Nowka of Harvard. In addition, two of her grandchildren, Mrs. Ruth Wright of Trinidad, CO and Miss Vesta Carlson of Harvard were reared in the home.

Her parents, two brothers, and one sister have preceded her. Three brothers and two sisters are living. They are: John Brenneman of near Harvard, Martin Brenneman of Hastings, NE, Daniel Brenneman of Princeton, IL, Mrs. Mary Lewis of Horton, KS and Mrs. Hattie B. Stockham of Aurora, NE.

In 1883, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman moved from Illinois to Nebraska and settled on a farm six and one-half miles northeast of Harvard. Here they lived until 1914 when they moved to Harvard where they have since resided.

About thirty years ago, Mrs. Kaufman and her husband united with the Christian church in Harvard. During all the years that this most important step of becoming a Christian, she had continued in the faith in Christ. She loved the church and was especially interested in its benevolent work in which she was a sympathetic contributor. She loved the hymns of the church and during her last illness had them played often that she might enjoy them.

Her health had been failing for about one year. Her last illness continued five weeks during which time she suffered but bore it all with Christian fortitude and patience. She desired to live but said if she could not, she was ready to go.

She leaves her husband, one son, four daughters, three brothers, two sisters, twenty-four grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, and a large circle of friends to mourn their loss.

Mrs. Kaufman was a devoted wife. As a mother, she was ever kind and loving. Anything she could do for her family and friends were not counted as a sacrifice, but a love service. The church has lost a faithful member and the community, a worthy friend.

After a brief service at the home, the funeral service was held at the First Christian Church in Harvard, being conducted by H.A. Wingard. The interment was made in the Harvard cemetery.

A TRIBUTE TO OUR MOTHER

I know there will never be another,

That can take the place of your dear Mother

And it brought such grief and pain

When from her, you had to part,

But her dear face will always be imprinted

On your memory and in your heart

Tho’ she has gone to meet her Maker

And sleeps in sweet repose,

Her love, kind deeds, in fondest memories

Will always linger near you

Like the perfume of the fragrant rose.

She lived a good and useful life

As we all most assuredly know,

She earned a place with the angels

In their garments as white as snow.

We should not take Death as such a tragic thing,

For when our loved ones cross over

The Heavenly Choirs rejoice and sing.

For those, they know all earthly

Temptations and trials are o’re,

They are safe and secure

On that Beautiful Shore.

~ Written in Memory of her Mother by Minnie Bell Skinner

Death

Death is only the closed door

Thru which we all must pass

To reach that Holy city to dwell forevermore,

With all our loved ones who have travelled on before.

Built on that evergreen shore

It is there she will meet and greet you

On that bright and happy day,

When all your cares and sorrows

Have completely passed away.

She will take you by the hand and lead you into that Promised Land

Let’s not spend the time left us here on earth below

In regret and sad repining,

But look above this dark cloud now upon us

For it has a silver lining.

Let’s prepare ourselves to meet her

In that Fair City with lights a glowed

When our summons come to go.

Just now your hopes and plans are blighted

But think of her as your bright guiding star,

By which your path will be lighted

When your time comes to cross the bar.

Minerva (Minnie) Belle Kaufman Dec 25, 1886 Harvard, NE – Aug 7, 1953 Arvada, NE (Twin)

Minnie married Elwin Jackson Palmer in 1904 and had three children. Elwin Jackson Palmer was born July 26, 1879 and died May 7, 1942. Elwin was the depot agent in Eldorado and all three children were born at the depot. Minnie and Elwin divorced. She married Harvey Skinner in 1911.

Elwin Jackson Palmer (1879 – 1942)

Elwin was a descendant of Phineas Taylor Barnum, of the P.T. Barnum Circus fame. P.T. is a 4th cousin, 7 times removed to Berneitta May Palmer Bruning’s five children.

Minnie Belle wrote poems. I found a lot of poems she had written in my Mom’s papers. I put several of her poems in this book for all to read, and the rest will be in a section in the back of the book. Several are directed and/or dedicated to others in our family. Behind the memory section of this book, you will find all of the poems that Minnie and her sister Grace wrote, except for the ones I have used throughout this book.

It was said that Minnie also possessed a sort of “sight” over the years, but I am not sure if they were premonitions or something else.

Matthew Joseph Thompson and daughter Mya

SONNY BOY

When you came to our house to live

You were such a little boy

You brought a lot of happiness

And a heap of joy.

I would wash your little hands and face

And when your prayers were said,

I would wrap you up so warmly

And tuck you into bed.

Angels watched beside you

All through the long dark night

Until you opened those big brown eyes

At the morning’s early light.

Then at the rising of the sun

You would tumble out of bed,

For a busy day had just begun

And you’ve lambs to be fed.

Your toys were scattered here and there

Most anywhere we’d look,

And over there your little shoes

And your little picture book.

And then when you were very sick

And suffered lots of pain,

We’d just stand there beside your bed

And pray you’d soon be well again.

So that’s the way the years sped by

One by one on silent wings,

But I’m telling you they left behind,

A lot of precious things.

Now you have to the city, your fortune for to make,

And we hope and pray that you’ll make good

Just for your own dear sake.

The wire lonesome and blue, when we think of you

You seem so far away.

And we hope that you are happy

And will return to us someday.

I believe the worsted quilt above was made by Emma Vincent Gibson.

THE OLD WORSTED QUILT

If you could have seen

All the garments of which I’m made

You would laugh and you’d cry

If they all could pass by

You’d call them the rag man’s parade.

Here’s a piece of Dad’s old vest

And his swallow tailed coat

That he wore for his very best

When he went every Sunday

Unless he was ill

To the old fashioned preachin’

In the church on the hill.

There’s a piece of Mother’s old fashioned gown

She wore each Saturday she went to town

Where she did her shopping for some this or that

And I do declare! Here’s a piece of her velvet hat

This brown was a coat, worn by old Uncle Joe,

The green was a dress he bought for Aunt Flo,

The both have gone, where the good darkies go

That’s why we cherish them, I know

This was Sister’s best bid and tucker

How she ironed and pressed

Every wrinkle and pucker

Each fold must stay just so

For she was going to a party

With her handsome young beau.

Here’s a piece of Brother’s nice gray pants

He always wore to the jitterbug dance

Where he danced with Sally and Sarah and Sue

Oh yes his shirt was this bright blue

And also his tie a mixture of red

For he was a gay cavalier, so ‘tis said

Here’s baby’s wee romper so cute and small

T’was in these he first learned to crawl,

The khaki nickers he wore to school

And these striped overalls when he rode the mule

Oh yes, I nearly forgot, that would have been sad,

These old woolen sox belonged to Grandad.

And few other pieces were Grandma’s too

So I’ve sewed them together

And I give them to you.

~ By Minnie Belle Kaufman Skinner

Before I move on to my Grandmother, Grace Hattie Kaufman, I would like to give you a little background on the Brenneman family. As you know, from information previously mentioned, Margaret Catherine Brenneman (My Great Grandmother) married Levi Henry Kaufman, my Grandma Grace’s parents. Once again, you will notice the numerous uses of the same first names from generation to generation.

THE BRENNEMANS

I followed the Brenneman family back to my 7th Great Grandparents:

Melchior Brenneman “The Exile” Born about 1631 in Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland and died about 1678 in Griesheim, Hessen, Germany. The Brenneman name is sometimes spelled Bronniman in Switzerland, but by about 1700, it became Brenneman. Melchior was dubbed the “Exile” because he was imprisoned in the Castle of Thun in 1659 for his Mennonite views. He was a weaver by trade. He fled Switzerland to Germany in 1671. He married Christina Reussen and had four children that I could find: Johann 1661, Adam, 1663. Melchior II 1665-1737, and Christian 1667-1759.

Melchior “The Exile” Brenneman 7th Great Grandfather

Castle of Thun, Switzerland

6th Great Grandparents:

Melchior “The Pioneer” II Brenneman, born 1665 in Oberdiessbach, Lucerne, Switzerland. He was a weaver and Mennonite preacher. He married Elizabeth Jane Steham in Bern, Switzerland. To avoid further persecution of their Mennonite faith, they fled Germany and came to Pennsylvania in 1709 and settled near Germantown. They immigrated to Philadelphia on Aug 24, 1707. He is buried in new Danville cemetery, Lancaster County, PA. They had six children: Christopher 1693-1758; Christian 1695-1757; John 1697-1757; Catherine 1705-About 1756; Melchior Stehman (III) 1718-1794; Adam (My 5th Great Grandfather) 1730-1804.

5th Great Grandparents:

3rd Great Grandparents:

Martin Brenneman was born July 23, 1776 in New Danville, PA and died May 30, 1862 in Malden, ILL. Martin married Veronica Kendig on Jan. 20, 1808 in Lancaster, PA. Veronica was born in 1780 and died in 1845. They had ten children: Anna 1812-1910; Fanany 1814; Mary 1817-1886 (married Michael Kaufman who disappeared from home and was never heard from again); Martin (My 2nd Great Grandfather) 1819-1914; George 1825; Christian 1826-between 1905-06; two male children, and two female children, names unknown died as infants.

2nd Great Grandparents:

Martin Brenneman II was born March 17, 1819 near New Danville, PA and died March 25, 1914 in Princeton, IL. Martin married three times. His first wife was Lydia Young in 1843 with three children: Mary Ann 1846-1914; Henry C. 1844-1869; Melchior “Michael” 1846-Infancy death. Then Martin married Mary Eva Garman February 8, 1847 (My 2nd Great Grandmother). Mary was born, Eva Maria Germann, on Dec 25, 1822, per Find a Grave, in Hessen, Darmstadt, Germany and died Oct 15, 1900, in Princeton, Bureau, IL. Her parents were Johann Phillip Germann and Catherina Margaretha Ross. She came to Franklin county, PA in 1830 and then to Wayne, Stark and Cuyahoga Counties, IL. After Martin and Mary married, they moved to Bureau County in 1855 where they farmed. After Mary died in 1900, the family moved to Princeton, IL.

NOTE: I will talk briefly about the Garman Family. I was able to follow them on my family tree back to my 4th Great Grandparents:

4th Great Grandparents: Johann Peter Germann and Rebekka Lautenschlager (no information)

3rd Great Grandparents: Johann Phillip Germann and Catherina Margaretha Ross

Phillip was born Sept 15, 1783 in Messbach, Hessen, Germany and died Aug 23, 1861 in Independence, Cuyahoga, OH. He married Catharina Margaretha Ross on July 30, 1816 in Hessen, Darmstadt, Germany and had thirteen children. Catharina was born May 31, 1796 in Hessen, Germany and died 1885 Stark, OH. One of the thirteen children was my 2nd Great Grandmother, Mary Garman 1821-1900.

JOHN PHILLIP GARMAN OBITUARY (3rd Great Grandfather)

Birth: Sep 16, 1783, Hessen, Germany

Death: Aug 23, 1861, Independence, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, USA

John Philip Garman was born as Johann Philipp Germann in Messbach, Hessen Sept 16, 1783. He married Catharina Margaretha Ross on July 30, 1816, Neunkirchen, Hessen. He was a son of Johann Peter Germann and Elizabeth Rebecca Lautenschlager. He served as a soldier in the Hessen-Darmstadt troops under Napoleon in the Peninsular Wars and was in prison in Lisbon. Later, he was on the march to Moscow in 1812 and survived the perilous march back to Europe. He married and started a family in Brandau, Hessen, and they immigrated in 1830 to the U.S. landing in Baltimore and later went to PA and settled in Wayne, later Stark, and then Independence, Cuyahoga Co, OH by 1850 where he died Aug 23, 1861. His widow died in Stark Co, OH on Jan 25, 1885.

I was able to follow the Ross family back to my 8th Grandparents.

Mary Eva Garman 1822 – 1900 and Martin Brenneman 1819-1914 (2nd Great Grandparents)

Mary Eva Garman Brenneman was Martin’s second wife. They had seven children: George W. 1850-1922; Sarah Amanda 1853-1920; Martin Van Buren 1855-1920; Margaret* (My Great Grandmother) 1857-1925; Harriet Elizabeth 1860-1936; Daniel Webster 1863-1929; and John 1848-1936

Martin married his third wife, Ruth Vickery.

Excerpt from the Akron Beacon Journal from Aug 29, 1903:

The Family History that was read at the Garman Family Reunion came from Germany: The Horrors of a Soldiers Life in that Country Caused Emigration to the Land of the Free– An Interesting Story.

At the annual reunion of the Garman family this week some interesting features were developed in a paper read by Mrs. Charles Garman of Richfield. It follows:

Some 80 years ago, John Philip Garman with his wife, Katherine Margaret Ross, with two or three little children, was living in a quiet little village in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany. Their home was close by the village fountain, where every night after their work on the outlying farms, the people gathered to smoke and spend an hour in kindly chat about little daily happenings. It was a quiet, happy life. But in Germany, every young man must serve seven years in the army. This little family had increased to seven, and four of them were boys. The father had spent seven years in the army, part of the time under Napoleon, whom he greatly admired. Four of the seven years, he was a prisoner of war in Lisbon, so he knew the privations and horrors of a soldier’s life. The mother felt she could never allow her boys to become targets for bullets, so they decided to come to America, where few soldiers were needed, and where there would be opportunities for the children to make a good living. It was a hard matter to leave friends and relatives and the happy village home. But for the sake of the children, all ties were severed, and in May of 1829, they started on a long and tedious voyage of three months, landing in Baltimore 74 years ago this month. They had been obliged to sell their property in Germany at a sacrifice, and the expenses of the long voyage had consumed their little hoard, so when they arrived in this country they were well-nigh penniless. From Baltimore, they traveled in a wagon to Franklin County, PA.

It was very hard for the mother to adapt herself to the ways of living in the new and lonely country. Their first home was a log cabin in a lonely spot, far from neighbors, in the edge of the forest. In after years, the mother often told her children of her bitter homesickness and the feeling of desolation it gave her when the dry leaves rustled in the cabin door. From here, they moved to Stark County, OH. Later, they went to Wayne County, and in 1849 to Independence, in Cuyahoga County, where the father died in 1862. The mother died in Stark County in 1888.

Mary married Martin Brenneman, and her descendants are in the west, mostly in Illinois and Nebraska.

2ND GREAT GRANDMOTHER Mary Eva Garman’s parents: I was able to follow the Ross family to my Eighth Great Grandparents. My 3rd Great Grandparents Ross, were born in Germany and were the first Ross generation to come to America, however, most of their children were born in Germany before they came here.

The 1910 census shows he was living with Ben and Eva Kaufman as a hired hand. It is unclear if John and Grace knew each other before this time, but Ben Kaufman was Grace’s Uncle, so if Grace didn’t know John before that time, she met him when he was working at their farm. A romance must have blossomed as they were married in August that year.

They farmed, and later, John ran the gas station in Holbrook, NE. John and Grace moved to Denver in about May 1936, and he owned another gas station located at 5501 N. Federal Blvd, in Denver, Colorado. They lived in the back quarters of the establishment. Their daughter, Betty Jayne was still living at home.

Grandma Grace wrote a lot of poetry which she often included with cards for Christmas or birthdays. Her sister Minnie Bell also wrote poems.

HOME

Sometimes when skies are dark and dreary

And your thoughts are want to roam

There is nothing quite so restful

As the quietness of home.

Some folks try to search for happiness

Over distant lands and foam

But after all the sights and pleasures

There is just no place like home.

~ By Grace Kaufman Lentz Smith – 1952

JOHN LENTZ OBITUARY

John Lentz Dies in Denver From Illness

Following an illness of several months, John Lentz died Sunday at Denver, Colorado, the body being brought here for funeral services at the St. Matthew’s Lutheran church, Wednesday, with burial in Holbrook Cemetery. Mr. Lentz operated the filling station for several years leaving Holbrook, about two years ago, and had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, here, which are sorry to hear of his passing.

Obituary

John Lentz, son of Anton Lentz and Emma Schnell, was born July 4th, 1891, in Clay County, Nebraska. His mother died when he was still at a tender age. Sometimes with his father and sometimes in the home of other relatives, he lived in Clay County at Plainview, at Arlington in Hoke County at Holbrook, and in Denver where he died June 19th, 1938, after a lingering illness, which confined him for the last 5 months to his home and to hospital care. He is survived by two brothers, George Lentz, Lincoln, NE; William Lentz, Centerville, MT; Four Sisters: Emma Borberg, Billings, MT; Mrs. J.H. Hilgenkamp, Arlington, NE; Minnie Pederson, New York City. In 1910, he was married to Grace Kaufman of Harvard, who, besides four daughters, mourn his early death.

He died at his home in Denver, June 19. In his infancy, he was baptized in the Lutheran Church and later also confirmed in this faith. He attained the age of 46 years, 11 months, and 15 days. He was given a Christian burial from St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church and committed to the earth in Holbrook cemetery on June 22nd. Rev. M. Schalbacker conducted the funeral service.

THE STAR

WRITTEN CHRISTMAS 1940 BY GRANDMA GRACE LENTZ

Long, long ago the shepherds watched

On a hill far, far away

For the one bright star to guide them

To where the Christ Child Lay

They call it the star of Bethlehem

For it pointed out the way

And they found him in a manger

Upon a bed of hay.

Then they shouted Hallelujah

And they heard the angels sing

Hallelujah to our Savior

Hallelujah to our King

How we love to hear the story

As ‘twas told to you and me

How He came to bear our burdens

How He died to set men free

Then let us sing his praises

On this Glad Christmas day

For His star is always shining

To guide us on our way.

~ I composed this poem 1940….Grace Lentz

After Grace and John married, they raised sheep in Nebraska.

COLORADO

You may travel east, you may travel west

But I know you will like Colorado best

For there’s no other place that can compare

With its rivers and lake, its deer & bear

And the tall blue spruces growing there.

There are wild flowers peeping through the grass

Which you cannot miss as you journey past

But sweetest of all is the columbine

And now you have left them far behind.

But the rocks and the hills will be calling you back

And soon you’ll be traveling that same old track

Where the winds are cool and the grass is green

And there’s quiet places to sit and dream.

Where a chipmunk is hiding behind a tree

Oh that’s the place you long to be

So head this way when you feel blue

For this beautiful place has room for you

1944 – Grace and her Dodge Car

Grace Hattie Kaufman Lentz Smith’s Last Driver’s License

Grace Lentz married a second time to James Valentine Smith on August 31, 1945. He went by the name of Jim and Val and answered to both. I never knew my Grandpa John Lentz, since he died in 1938 before I was born, so I always referred to him as Grandpa Smith. James Smith was born Nov 16, 1894 in NE and died April 17, 1976, in Arvada, CO. Jim is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Denver, CO.

Jim was previously married to Lillian and had two children: Cecil E. and Laven G. He had six siblings. The census in 1920 showed Jim as a famer, but in 1940 census, his occupation was self-employed painter. I am not sure when Jim moved to Colorado to make it his home. I believe that Grace and Jim met when he was hired to paint the building where Grace was working. They struck up a conversation and realized that they were both from the same area of Nebraska and found they had many things in common. I have a picture of them dated 1940, so they had dated quite a while before they married.

In the Denver area, Jim Smith was a painter, by trade, and painted many houses inside and out. Mom and Dad had hired him several times to paint the inside of our big two-story home over the years when we lived there. He loved to fish. He and I used to go down to our ponds located in the pasture near Boulder Creek. We would fish for Crappie, Blue Gills, and Sun fish. Most weren’t worth the effort to clean and cook so we tossed them back and did it just for fun. Occasionally, we would catch some nice bass in those ponds. He loved to go to the mountains and fish the lakes and rivers near Grand Lake, Granby, and Hot Sulphur Springs. He was always a pleasant sort of a fellow. They bought the little house on 75th in Arvada. Later, he added a garage and then eventually added on a porch and then another bedroom. They lived fairly quiet lives, I think. They made many trips to Granby to visit Aunt Elaine and often came to our house for Sunday dinner and sometimes for Holiday dinners. Grandma Grace was quite religious. I remember Grandpa Jim smoking a pipe, and I think he smoked cigarettes, too, but I can’t remember for sure.

Grandma Grace always said she was Pennsylvania Dutch. For years, I didn’t know why she said that until I started researching our family history. I knew they had originated in Germany and Switzerland. When the Kaufman and Brenneman families came to Pennsylvania, they spoke German. People mistakenly took the German word Deutsch to be Dutch, but it simply referred to the German language they spoke. But, even knowing this, the term “Pennsylvania Dutch” continued to be used. Mostly, it refers to the Amish, Mennonites, Swiss Germans, and people of the Lower Palatinate, which is in Southeast Germany between Luxemburg and the Rhine River. Most were Lutherans or Reformed Church, and many were Anabaptists. This is another history lesson entirely that I will not expand on at this time.

For a couple of years, when my brother David and I were growing up, Grandma Grace would give us a little box of chocolate covered peanuts or chocolate covered raisins for Christmas. We were so happy to get them but always knew what they were before they were un-wrapped because of the shape of the box and the rattle they made when we shook them. This was a rare occasion because Grandma Grace had little to live on and had many grandchildren. This was also true of my paternal grandmother, Emma. It was impossible for grandparents, in those days, to give gifts at Christmas or birthdays. Quite different than today.

Grandma Grace grew amazing flowers at her home. I always loved going there, but we were forbidden to walk in the flower beds or pick any of the flowers unless she picked them for us. Beds and beds of colorful blooms such as pansies, iris, chrysanthemums, zinnias, tulips, crocus, daffodils, and daisies, plus many that I can’t remember, but most especially her roses. She had all types of roses including the climbing rose featured in the previous picture. She even had one bed of wild flowers that she grew every year. What a beautiful sight! She most definitely had the green thumb when it came to her flowers outside and her indoor plants. I have a lot of pictures of Grandma Grace in her flower gardens, but they are all black and white so the beauty is kind of lost.

OPAL MARGARET LENTZ 1912 – 1938 WILLIAM CARL HAUSSLER 1902- 1972

Opal Margaret was born March 1, 1912 in Gregory, SD and died of complications of childbirth with their fourth child on Oct 21, 1938 in Cambridge, NE. I believe after Opal’s death, since the children were small, that Bill’s mother, Grandma Haussler, helped take care of the children. She sewed the girls’ dresses and taught them things that their mother would have, had she lived. Often, as Jeanne grew older, the responsibility of the younger two fell on her shoulders. She would miss out on the usual teenage things and had to grow to adulthood early in life. Bill was a farmer, and in addition to that, had to raise his children as a widower, but he still found time to write some poetry. I will be including some later on in this section. Bill was very diligent about keeping in contact with my mom, Violet, his late wife’s sister. He sent pictures which helped my mom walk through the stages of the children’s lives to adulthood. The kids continued corresponding with my mom and kept her informed of their families. Bill came to Colorado several times and visited. He was always so enjoyable to be around and talk to. Speaking of corresponding, things were very different back them. Folks would wait for weeks for a card or letter to come, and postcards were the thing then! They didn’t have all the social media we have now to keep up on what someone is doing or to download pictures of their grandchildren or a niece or nephew. They would not have been able to have imagined the technology and the advantages that we have today.

Opal Margaret Lentz

IN MEMORY OF Opal

It will be a year now

Death came and knocked on your door

And took away a loved one so dear

That left your hearts broken and sore.

And though you are sad and lonely

She is happy there on that beautiful shore,

Perhaps you’ve packed and put away

All her pictures and other things

That belonged to her those few short years.

And as you look upon them your

Eyes are filled with tears

And you think your heart will surely break.

She is now a beautiful angel

And walks by a crystal lake.

On her feet are sandals of silver

Her garments are pure and white

On her head rests a golden crown

Set with gems that sparkle so bright

In her hand she holds a magic wand

Given her by an angel called Love.

And with it she will beckon you

To come, live with her in that city above.

It’s there she will meet you and greet you

On that bright and happy day

When all your cares and sorrows

Have completely passed away.

There she will take you by the hand

And lead you into the promise land

And show you a beautiful mansion on that evergreen shore

Where you’ll dwell with her forever

And part from her no more.

Poem

Life is short and full of sorrow

Here today, but gone tomorrow

Do not trust in earthly treasure

Do not live in sinful pleasure

Wholly be on Christ refying

While you’re living and when dying

Who’er trusts in ‘Jesus’ merit

Will eternal life inherit

Grant, O Lord, that I may, too

Spend eternity with you

Amen

— William Haussler – Jeannie’s Dad

Norma Jean, Janice, and Louis Haussler

I was six years old when I went with Mom and Dad back to Nebraska. It was the first time I had been out of state. We had gone there to attend my cousin Janice’s wedding. I was in awe of Jeanne, Janice, and Louis. I remember, since they milked cows as we did, that the cows needed to be brought in for the milking, so Louis asked me if I would like to go along. Of course, I jumped at the chance and went along with him. While we were gathering the cows, he told me to watch out for that old black and white bull and if the bull decided to chase us, I was to go under the nearby fence. Thank goodness that didn’t happen, but I was kind of scared. I had not been allowed to go out among the milk cows yet, on our own farm, so I thought I was doing something big. We spent the night there since the wedding was the next day. The next morning, I asked Louis where he had slept, and he told me the bathtub. I mentioned that to my cousin Jeanne some years later, and she said that they didn’t even have a bathtub yet at that time. Guess Louis pulled one over on me. They had a nice, typical, two-story farm house on their farm. While we were in Nebraska, we visited many relatives, though I cannot remember who they were. At one place, I was astonished to see these little lights floating through the air, and I asked about it and was told that they were fireflies. Someone caught a couple in a jar so that I could see them. I had never seen anything like that before as it would be unusual to see them in Colorado. One home we visited, the nice lady there gave me this little rectangular pillow and the top cover of it was done with sewn yo-yos. Very neat, and I still have it today. I am still wondering who that lady was. I think her name was Rebecca. Perhaps my Great Grandpa Vincent’s second wife. I wish I knew……

Bathrick, August 14, 1933 in Norton, KS. Ralph went by many names…Ralph, Tuffy, and Ted. I remember half of the time I didn’t know who my folks were talking about. Finally, as I got older, I figured out they were the same person. Ralph was born April 7, 1911 in Lewellen, NE to Frank and Bessie Bathrick. He died May 21, 2006. Uncle Ralph and Aunt Elaine were fortunate enough to have celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in Mesa, AZ, in 2003.

Ralph and Elaine moved from Hot Sulphur Springs to Grand Lake, Colorado. Then in 1941, they moved back to Longmont, Colorado, where their youngest was born.

Frank Theodore was born Sept 15, 1943 in Longmont, Colorado. He married Peggie Jane Griesch on June 19, 1964 in Granby, CO. Peggie was born June 16, 1946. They had two children:

Christina Jane Bathrick, born Oct 2, 1966 and Cary Alan Bathrick, born March 16, 1968

She married Jeff Salter on April 10, 1989 with one child Alexa Rae Salter, born Nov 25, 1989. She married Harold Davis with one child, Ross (deceased).

Cary married Amy Ingelbrightson on Aug 10, 1989. They had one daughter, Rebecca Jane Bathrick born June 22, 1989. Cary married Stacy and have Brady Alan, Anastatia Marie (Ana), and James Elway (Jeb).

After Frank and Peggie divorced, Frank married Joyce Ellen Reed on March 25, 1972. Joyce was born March 2, 1944.

When we were growing up we all called Frank, “Frankie,” but I think that changed by the time he got to high school. I think everyone started calling him Frankie because his grandfather was named Frank Bathrick and lived nearby in Granby.

Ralph had many different jobs in his lifetime. He did chores at home and for his neighbors. He drove mules to haul for a new bridge. He delivered ice, shucked corn, hauled grain and logs from Colorado, fed sheep and cattle, worked in a flour mill, farmed, ran a dairy, and worked on the Big Thompson Project in Grand Lake, Colorado.

Elaine and Ralph Bathrick

When my cousin Frank graduated from high school in Granby, Colorado, I was invited to go and stay for the graduation. Since other relatives were also visiting for the graduation, I stayed at Ralph’s parents’ home, which was only a block away from Uncle Ralph and Aunt Elaine’s. They had a neat couch that was a hideaway bed. It was a fun weekend. Frank and Bessie Bathrick were wonderful hosts. I didn’t know Frank Sr. well but got to know Bessie in later years, and she was always very good to me as if I was a granddaughter. She was a wonderful person, and I enjoyed her company very much. When she got ill and was confined to a nursing home in Boulder, Colorado, I went to visit her often.

I always thought of Uncle Ralph and Aunt Elaine as modern people. I don’t know why I thought that. Maybe it was because they were always traveling and doing things. My folks were pretty much tied down to the farm and ranch, so we didn’t get away much. They were always taking a trip here or there for their “Second Honeymoon.” That amused me, but they enjoyed their travels very much.

Ralph and Elaine loved to square dance and Ralph called for a lot of square dances all over the country and was very good at it.

When Ralph and Elaine lived in Longmont, Ralph, his father Frank, and my dad got jobs working on the Green Mountain Dam at Heeney, Colorado just South of Kremling. Ralph also worked in a coal mine while they lived in Longmont. They lived in Hot Sulphur Springs, Co where he managed a dairy farm. They also lived in Grand Lake, where Ralph worked as a plumber. After the Bathrick family moved to Granby, CO, Ralph bought a plumbing company, which he named the Ralph Bathrick Plumbing and Heating Co. After retirement, they moved back to the Denver area and then on to sunny Arizona where they lived in Mesa until their deaths. I visited their home a couple of time when they lived in the Denver area. I remember Ralph had tiled a unique entry way into the home by imbedding silver dollars in the tiles. Very neat!

Ralph was a big teaser and sometimes embarrassed me, but when they visited, it was good times, and I enjoyed playing with my cousin Frankie because he was nearest to my age. Oftentimes, we would enjoy Thanksgiving feasts together or sometimes just a Sunday dinner. We played around the farm and if my Dad had a stack of straw bales, we managed to make some neat forts. Sometimes, we would ride the ponies and play cowboys and Indians. We also played in the silos if they were empty at the time. We thrived on doing just typical kid stuff.

Uncle Harold was a soft spoken and mild-mannered man. He always thought a bit before he answered a question and spoke slowly. I don’t think I ever saw him angry in all the years I knew him. Back in about 1961, I had gone to the State Fair in Pueblo, CO on a 4-H trip. On the day I got ready to leave on the train, Uncle Harold took off work to come down and see me off.
