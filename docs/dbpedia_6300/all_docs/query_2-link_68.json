        "text": "The Simpsons was created by Matt Groening in 1989, depicting the life of a middle-class family of five in a fictional town called Springfield. Main character, notorious idiot, and father, Homer Simpson lives with his wife Marge, son Bart, and daughters Lisa and Maggie. The Simpson family dynamic is far from perfect, Homer strangles his son when he misbehaves, forgets his second daughter’s name on occasion, and spends most of his time at the local bar with friends. Homer, his friends, and his family are all part of Springfield’s middle/lower class, while characters such as Homer’s boss, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Burn’s associate, Smithers, are part of the upper class. Homer’s lack of intelligence, credited to the “Simpson gene,” a gene that makes every male in the family incredibly stupid, is what has made the sitcom so popular. In fact, it is what The Simpsons is best known for. While watching the series, however, viewers must stop and ask whether Groening’s depiction of Homer Simpson’s intelligence applies to a one in a million idiot, or is it instead an unflattering reflection on the much less severe (compared to Homer), simplemindedness of the middle class that Homer is a part of as a whole?\n\nHomer lives a typical middle-class lifestyle with his wife and kids, including a two-story house, nine-to-five job at a local nuclear power plant, and love for drinking seemingly shared by most fathers in slapstick animated sitcoms. Also shared by fathers of this tv category is being under the boot of their employer. Mr. Burns, Homer’s employer at the plant, fits the role by being verbally abusive and rude to Homer whenever given a chance. Mr. Burns can do this without retaliation from Homer because of his status in the upper class, as well as being his boss, leaving Homer powerless against him. “What Monkeys Can Teach Us About Fairness” by Nicholas Kristof presents the chilling fact that “the average C.E.O. at the largest American public companies earns about 350 times as much as the average worker” (Kristof 3). With this in mind, Mr. Burn’s treatment of Homer is understood. Burns knows he can push Homer around with no penalty because he is given such privilege due to his salary, status as a part of the upper class, and position of power within the company. The model of Mr. Burns and Homer’s relationship, according to Kristof’s data, occurs in many large businesses around the world, but goes unnoticed because the subordinate is powerless under their employer.\n\nWaylon Smithers is Mr. Burn’s right-hand man, associate, and executive assistant, but is still not safe from the abuse Mr. Burns deals out to his employees. Although treated better than Homer, Smithers’s position at the plant means nothing to Mr. Burns because Smithers is still below him. Mr. Burns refers to Homer and Smithers in the same manner, by their last name and nothing more. I was unaware as to what Mr. Smithers’s first name was because he is commonly known in the series as just “Smithers” by Mr. Burns. Although Smithers is directly below Mr. Burns and makes, most likely, the closest amount of money to his boss, Mr. Burns still makes more than he does, and the hierarchy still exists within the powerplant with Mr. Burns above Smithers. Therefore, Mr. Burns treats Smithers poorly. No matter the position of the employee at the plant, Mr. Burns will treat them like dirt and never see them as his equal because of his superior company status and larger paycheck.\n\n“Frink gets Testy,” written by Dan Vebber, is episode 11 of the 29th season in The Simpsons saga in which Mr. Burns fears a cataclysmic event is going to occur on Earth (World War III). Mr. Burns’s solution was to make a doomsday spaceship, which would hold a small percentage of Springfield’s residents and fly away in the event such fear came to life. At the beginning of the episode, Mr. Burns struggles to figure out who would come with him on his escape, and who stays on Earth to die. Mr. Burns calls on the brains of society including professor Frink, known to be one of the most intelligent members of Springfield, to solve his problem. Frink argued that a classic IQ exam isn’t enough to determine the worth of a person, because we all know we’re all more than just a number right? Nope. Frink designs a new test and calls it the “PVQ” or Personal Value Quotient test, an exam to determine the “worth” of a person on a scale of 1–500. The PVQ test, the professor sings, tests for far more than IQ but instead for “sympathy, empathy, and group collaboration. artistry, neatness, and complex socialization (and much more)” (The Simpsons: S29 E11). All these factors, Frink believes, can accurately tell Mr. Burns exactly who is worthy of escaping with him, and the song concludes with the societal elites all in agreement to administer the test.\n\nOn the day of the administered exam, all residents of Springfield are required to sit in a room for the assessment, similar to how we do standardized exams in school. Chief Wiggum is stationed outside the main entrance of the building with a large bell, ringing it to making sure everyone knows the test is mandatory. The camera then shifts to two of Homer’s friends, Lenny and Carl, who ask one another why they need to take the test but can’t come up with a good answer. Although they have no idea why the exam is mandatory, or what it actually tests, they funnel through the doors of the test center along with everyone else.\n\nNot far into the episode, the exam itself and the way it’s administered raises a very large and bright red flag. Residents of Springfield’s blind willingness to take an exam without any knowledge of its purpose is quite concerning, and something they should have questioned from the beginning. An obvious question the viewer should be asking, that is less obvious to Springfield, is what gives Frink and Mr. Burns (and the societal elites) the right to determine the worth of their peers? And a more important follow-up question, why are the creators exempt from taking the exam themselves? The answer to both questions is simply that Homer and his friends didn’t question anything. Even if they did, realistically they had no way of retaliating against it due to their lack of power. Groening’s depiction of the lower class in this episode is synonymous with herded sheep, which go wherever they are told without questioning the herder. This mindset shared among the lower class in Springfield is what allowed Mr. Burns and professor Frink to get away with testing and ranking them accordingly.\n\nThe results are in, says the TV in the Simpson’s household. At the same time, every resident of Springfield sits and waits to see their name and score flash across the screen. Lisa scores a respectable 475, Marge in second, Homer in third, and Bart in 4th with a Springfield low: 001. The lowest possible score on the exam, and accordingly, the least useful/worthy person in Springfield. The exam administered by the upper-class elites effectively reduced each member of Springfield to a number and nothing more. Bart convinces himself that his score doesn’t matter, but Marge believes otherwise. Marge storms into professor Frink’s office and demands that Bart’s test is rescored because she argues her son is not worthless. Frink checks the scores again and finds an error in his reporting of the scores. Marge’s excitement at the news is short-lived, for Frink realized that Homer got the 001 on the exam and not Bart. After the word got out of Homer’s score, and therefore worth in society, he was treated differently by his peers and friends. Homer was taken advantage of and ridiculed thanks to his PVQ exam number.\n\nGroening’s episode depicts the lower class as pawns in the upper class’s game of chess. Homer and the residents of Springfield willingly allowed Burns and Frink to mandatorily administer the exam with no information, and effectively allowed them to use the results to turn on one another. Marge argued to the professor not that her son is dumb, but that he is not worthless. Marge’s use of the word worthless shows why Springfield turns on Homer, because they believe their scores make them better than he is.\n\nWhile Homer is ridiculed for his exam score and begins to work with Marge to become more intelligent, Springfield’s lower class still doesn’t know why they took the test. They only know that 500 is the best and 001 is the worst, therefore, Homer is the worst. The lack of logical sense as to why exactly Homer is the least useful is meant to be appalling to the viewers. What’s more, Springfield still should be asking why Frink, and the rest of his upper-class colleagues, are allowed to determine who’s useful, as well as why the administrators were deemed useful enough not to take the test themselves. The word “useful” is both situational and subjective, different people can be useful for different reasons and at different times. If society needs a professor to conduct research, Frink is more useful than Homer. However, if society needs someone to eat all the doughnuts in town, Homer becomes much more useful than Frink. By this definition, the PVQ exam should make no logical sense whatsoever even to Frink who created it in the first place. If they tested specifically to a certain situation, that would be different, but the exam taking in all the components of a personality without testing for a specific situation, would cause the number to fluctuate.\n\nThere is a direct correlation between how our society takes, administers, and views the ACT/SAT exam and how Springfield does the same with their PVQ test. Each month, students file into a school for their exam date, scheduled by a person who doesn’t have to take the exam themselves, for the sole purpose of getting the highest score possible. This score, according to author, Julie Lythcott-Haims, in her book How to Raise an Adult, serves “as measures of student worth” (Lythcott-Haims 134). In her book, Lythcott-Haims points out that more financial aid is awarded to students with higher test scores, and that the “College board sells the PSAT score data to colleges so that kids with a certain level of aptitude can get onto a college’s radar screen” (Lythcott-Haims 135). These reported scores are what allow colleges to begin honing in on which students are deemed “useful” or ideal candidates for their school. So what becomes of you if you just didn’t test well or were sick that day? The schools will never know and will care less about your scores. In our society’s case, standardized test scores are used to determine the worth of students at first glance to colleges. During the application season, every college will receive thousands of applications with thousands of different test scores which will influence what an admissions office thinks of a student straight off the bat.\n\nBack in Springfield, all anyone saw of Homer was a 001 above his head that followed him everywhere he went. Any member of Springfield could look at his score and immediately determine they were better than he was, without taking into account any of his personality, character traits, or experience. Similar goes for the college admissions process. Although their holistic review process is meant to take into account everything about the student’s clubs, sports, work, involvement, volunteer work, experiences, etc, at first glance, a 36/1600 ACT/SAT is viewed as more useful than a 34/1500, or anything below it. Before anything else is taken into account, an applicant’s score skews the perception of the student to the school.\n\nSpringfield’s societal elites were able to administer, grade, and distribute the exam results while exempting themselves from it because of one simple fact, the lower class in Springfield didn’t question them. This microcosm of Springfield can be applied on a much larger scale to the outside world, where the extremely wealthy are seemingly untouchable especially to the lower class, who have no means of voicing their opinions against their wealthy counterparts. Dynamics between boss and employee, like Homer and Mr. Burns, exist as they do because the upper-class wealthy boss is free to do whatever he or she chooses to the employee with nothing the employee can do about it. Groening’s episode highlights the gap between the upper and lower class, while the sitcom as a whole brings forth the boss vs employee relationship. The Simpsons shows how the lower class is powerless against the wealthy elites and are forced to do what they are told without question. On the societal scale (outside Springfield) the same case seems to be true, where the lower class has less control over their fate than the wealthy."
