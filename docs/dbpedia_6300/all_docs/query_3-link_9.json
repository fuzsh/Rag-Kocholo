        "text": "Hey you 90s fans! Remember Klasky Csupo? The best animation studio who made Rugrats, Rocket Power, AAAHHH!! Real Monsters, and loads more.\n\nI’ll be looking at what were my favourite projects by this company and why have I chose to talk and review about Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo’s Company. Let’s take a trip down memory lane.\n\nWho are Klasky Csupo?\n\nKlasky Csupo is an Animation Production Company consisting of Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo, hence the company’s name is combined of the Co-Founder’s surnames. They went on to produce some of the best shows of all time and are well known for creating Rugrats and animated the first three seasons of The Simpsons. But they’re also not known for animating and creating tv shows, they are also known for their unique art style that was popular throughout the 90s and the 2000s, but is still remembered to this day.\n\nMy Favourite Klasky Csupo Projects\n\nWell, for me, I would say that my favourite projects from Klasky Csupo are the Original Rugrats (1991 – 2004), The Wild Thornberrys, AHHH!! Real Monsters, The Simpsons (Animators of Season 1 – 3), Duckman, Stressed Eric (For the BBC), and the 2008 animated movie Immigrants (Originally supposed to be a TV Show but was released as a Movie)\n\nKlasky Csupo Projects\n\nThe studio has created different projects for Television for companies like Nickelodeon, 20th Century Fox, and they also have had an advertising brand once formally known as Ka-Chew! And what was Ka-Chew? It was Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo’s division brand for advertising and other stuff that’s not television related. They’ve also released five feature films which were two Rugrats films (The Rugrats Movie and Rugrats in Paris) and one Wild Thornberrys Movie. However Rugrats and Wild Thornberrys have the crossover film which is titled as “Rugrats Go Wild”.\n\nBut I would recommend their fantastic wonderful projects to you, as they’re all great with an art style that everyone will remember when they were growing up in the 90s and 2000s.\n\nBut to be honest, Klasky Csupo are a great company, and one of the best production companies of all time (in my own opinion)\n\nOverall, I would recommend their work if you want to give a look at their animation OR art style. It’s such great detail put into them, nowadays characters have their facial features too small or too close together in most modern animated shows.\n\nAlso, Gabor Csupo, the Co-Founder behind Klasky Csupo is now on Twitter! Go give him a follow here\n\nThanks for Reading!\n\nRelated Posts"
