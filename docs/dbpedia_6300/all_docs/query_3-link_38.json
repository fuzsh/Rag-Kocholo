These businesses are just as eclectic as the cartoons they make. Here are the businesses that are part of the K-C family:\n\nGlobal Tantrum: Klasky Csupo's newest division, specialising in adult animation. Currently, Global Tantrum is producing 3 pilots for future series on TNN; the first of these being The Immigrants, a series about a pair of Russian and Mexican immigrants in Hollywood. That series is due to begin in early 2003.\n\nTone Casualties & Casual Tonalities: Record labels founded by Gabor Csupo, who is a jazz artist himself. Tone Casualties aim at the dark, moody types of music, while Casual Tonalities go for more commercial artists. Artists with TC and CT include Csupo, Frank Zappa, Drew Newmann, and The Pugs.\n\nClass-Key Chew-Po Commercials: K-C's advertising arm, with clients like Lincoln-Mercury, Kraft Foods, Campbell's, Burger King, McDonald's and Coca-Cola.\n\nKlasky-Csupo Publishing Division: Publisher of books about animation, in association with Simon & Schuster. Now in stores: their first book, about the making of The Rugrats Movie (see the movie page on how to get yours, direct from the publisher, at a discount). Other books now in production include \"The Art of Artist Janos Baska Soos\", \"Igor Kovalyov: A Director's Notebook\" and a series of childrens books based on the short-lived 1995 CBS series, Santo Bugito. Unfortunately, only The Rugrats Movie book was published so far (to my knowledge).\n\nLumpy Gravy: Csupo's restaurant located in West Hollywood, CA, \"where art, music & food collide.\" Opened in 1997, it closed in June 1999.\n\nWhere To Find Klasky-Csupo\n\nAbove: A map showing the approximate locations of Klasky-Csupo's old and new studio in Hollywood. The new studio at 6353 Sunset Blvd. is located a short distance away from their previous location at 1258 N. Highland. Also shown on map is K-C's pre-1988 location at 729 Seward. (Map from the EasyMaps CD-Rom, ©1998 Chicago Maps Corporation; portions ©1998 TRIUS, Inc.)\n\nQuestion: What did Klasky-Csupo do with the extra money that they made on The Rugrats Movie?\n\nAnswer: Move to a new building.\n\nAround July 1999, Klasky Csupo moved to a former Mercedes-Benz showroom on the fabled Sunset Boulevard, opposite the Cinerama Dome theater. Their new studio, a 6-floor 95,000 square-foot glass & steel structure, provides workspace for 500 employees of K-C. In addition to the new building, new equipment is included, featuring computer graphics workstations, and post production and recording facilities.\n\nTo make the new location as distinctive as their old one, they placed a K-C logo on the side of the building, as well as a neon sculpture of Tommy and his star ball on top. For pictures of the old and new building, see their web site.\n\nThe new studios is located on Sunset Blvd., between Ivor and Morningside Streets, west of Vine and about 2 blocks west of the Nickelodeon on Sunset studios. And located nearby is the Cinerama Dome Theater, at 6360 Sunset Blvd. -- this is where Rugrats In Paris and The Wild Thornberrys Movie had their premieres.\n\nWith the move, and their desire to remain in the Hollywood area, K-C is contributing to the revitalisation of Hollywood. According to Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, \"This is great news for the heart of Hollywood. The commitment of Klasky Csupo, one of our city's most creative and successful entertainment companies, is another important step in the revitalization of Hollywood.\"\n\nThis is the fourth place that Klasky-Csupo called \"home\" -- in 1982, it started in their apartment, then later, at Bob Clampett's old studio at 729 Seward St., near Melrose Ave. In 1988, they moved to Highland (1258) and Fountain.\n\nAs for the old, mural-covered Highland Ave. location? Klasky Csupo's still there -- these days, their sound operations, including the voice recordings for Rugrats and other K-C shows, are done at Highland Ave.\n\n(Source: Animation World Network)\n\nHow To Reach Klasky-Csupo or Tone Casualties:\n\nSnail-Mail:\n\n6353 Sunset Blvd.\n\nHollywood, CA 90028\n\nE-Mail:\n\nKlasky-Csupo: webmaster@klaskycsupo.com\n\nWeb Sites:\n\nKlasky-Csupo main site (Features info about the company, especially areas that are beyond the scope of the Cooltoons site (see below).)\n\nCooltoons (Klasky-Csupo's showcase of their animated series.)\n\nKlasky-Csupo's Rugrats Site (Official)\n\nTone Casualties (K-C's record label.)\n\nWorld Animation Celebration (An annual animation festival in Los Angeles, CA, founded in 1985 by Terry Thoren, currently CEO of Klasky-Csupo (one of the sponsors).)\n\nA Couple Of Sites That Are Important To Klasky-Csupo's History:\n\nPannóniafilm (The Hungarian animation studio where Gabor Csupo worked from 1971 to 1975.
