        "text": "While other entertainment conglomerates stumble, Viacom continues to thrive. But it won't win any awards for congeniality.\n\nThe recent screening of Paramount Pictures ' cartoon movie The Wild Thornberrys was a festive affair. Kids hooted at the corny jokes and popped out of their seats at the Pacific Theatres Galleria 16 in Sherman Oaks, Calif. to dance to the soundtrack. Unnoticed in the back row were executives from Paramount--including Motion Picture Group Chairman\n\nSherry Lansing Terry Thoren Klasky Csupo Mission: Impossible\n\n\"It's so exciting to just be making the movie,\" beams Thoren, whose company biography describes him as the \"Tycoon of Toons.\"\n\nBut behind all the smiles, Klasky Csupo is complaining that Paramount's parent, Viacom , is too tight with a dollar. An expiring five-year contract pays Klasky $450,000 per 22-minute episode of a TV cartoon. Among other items, Klasky wants to share in the profits of its shows after they run on Viacom's myriad outlets, instead of getting just the upfront payment typical in the industry. The firm also is complaining that Viacom isn't ordering enough episodes to allow it to pay its workers. Creating even more friction is Klasky's contention that Viacom has yet to pay back-end profits (beyond some advances) on Klasky's two hit Rugrats movies, one of which was the first non-Disney animated movie to crack $100 million at the box office.\n\n\"They claim the movie is still recouping,\" says Hungarian-born Gabor Csupo , who founded the firm in 1982 with his now ex-wife, Arlene Klasky , in their apartment. \"Unless you are Tom Cruise, then you are basically screwed.\" Csupo says he's hired auditors to go over Paramount's books.\n\nThe bad blood is all the more surprising considering Klasky's Rugrats TV series is almost singlehandedly responsible for making Viacom's Nickelodeon the most-watched cable channel during the day and the second-most-popular during prime time. Add in the merchandising, films, videos and so on, and Rugrats is a $1 billion honey pot.\n\nHardball tactics rub Hollywood's prickly creative crowd the wrong way, but they go a long way toward explaining why Viacom is holding its own while competitors such as Disney, AOL Time Warner and Vivendi stumble. Thanks in part to its tough stance on costs, Viacom enjoys an operating margin of 13%, compared with 10% at Disney and 9% at AOL.\n\nViacom's relationship with Klasky is also emblematic of how Viacom creates entertainment franchises by exploiting them across the stable of platforms it controls: Nickelodeon, MTV, CBS, United Paramount Network, Blockbuster, Simon & Schuster and many more. So, for instance, the company was able to gradually build an audience for its newest hit character, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, in part by sticking him in an episode of Rugrats.\n\nViacom manages the cross-pollination by demanding almost total control over the characters. \"For anything that gets done, you have to sell the character rights,\" says John Davis , co-owner of Jimmy Neutron's creator, DNA Productions . For the hit he will get \"very tiny-teeny\" royalties.\n\nKlasky, moreover, signed an exclusive deal permitting it to undertake only small jobs for other networks. That wasn't a problem until recently, when Viacom ordered a total of just 20 new TV episodes from Klasky Csupo over 12 months, down from 76 episodes two years ago. As a result, Klasky furloughed 75 animators from its staff of 350 for lack of work. Viacom is getting by on fewer episodes of its shows as it realizes that kids are content to stare, mothlike, at the same video over and over again, Csupo says. Viacom is now showing Rugrats reruns that get almost the same high ratings as the original episodes that cost it $450,000, but it pays nothing for the reruns. Viacom's Nickelodeon claims it is using more new programs than ever.\n\nNickelodeon also has leverage from having its own 270-person Burbank, Calif. cartoon studio, creator of the inexplicably popular SpongeBob SquarePants TV show and the recent Hey Arnold! movie.\n\nCsupo talks tough. \"I knew when I started it's a town of sharks, and you have to survive it,\" he says. \"I know we're going to be able to do a drastically different deal. If not with them, then with somebody who is willing to.\""
