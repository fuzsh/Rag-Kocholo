        "text": "I remember when the first Rugrats Movie came out how OBSESSED I became with the Rugrats, and about 75% of the obsession dealt with the actual animation of the movie. I really liked how they combined the regular 2D animation with 3D objects. And how detailed everything seemed to be. I rememebr making a comic book rype thing, somewhat copying off the Rugrats, and trying to mimick the 3D-ness and the \"wide angle lens\" shots the mvoie had to offer. I began to look at animated movies, looking for that 2D vs. 3D enviroment, and the next animated movie where I noticed that going on was Disney's Tarzan. ANYWAY, 2 years went by and ATBG hit the airwaves. I remember watching the show JUST for the animation factor, LOL. The enviroments were really a piece of art, and so different from any other Nick show. During the Rugrats 10th Anniversary Special I remember I recorded it and would puase and watch certain animated parts I liked frame by frame, LOL...such a wierdo. I do rememebr noticing the the whole 2D v 3D effect in the the WT Movie and RR Go Wild...and during the TV Movie Reggie's Big Break the previews were in widescreen, so it LOOKED like a movie theater type movie. But after that mvoie, I began to shy away from the whole KC animation obsession. Although, I remember liking the new AGU enviroments after they debuted in season 2. What reawakened me to this subject was watching Rugrats in Paris after about 4 years of not seeing it.\n\nSo, anyone else like KC Animation, 2D v 3D enviroment in the movies, etc?\n\nI personally love all of the KC animated shows, except for All Grown Up!. For some reason I just never caught onto that series. Anyways, I love the animation style they used for each, very detailed and colorful, and I loved the idea and storylines of all the shows. When Nick cut all their shows, one by one, I was really sad, especially since NN doesn't air any of them on their normal schedule. But, I am older now, realizing that the shows really don't fit me anymore, but I still love to watch them, especially Aaahh!!! Real Monsters. As for their movies, those we pretty well done, but I was young when they came out, so I don't quite remember how they go. I did pick up The Wild Thornberrys: Movie DVD and that was a nice movie to bring back childhood memories. But by next year, I probably won't be interested in them at all\n\nI have always loved KC animation, mainly because Rugrats and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters were the shows I grew up watching. Yes, I find myself likeing the Rugrats movie, just for the way it looks. I have always loved the KC shows, too bad Nick isn't letting them make any new shows.\n\nAlso, you bring up the point about the cinema feel to the previews for Rocket Power: Reggie's Big (Beach) Break, and I remember that too. I have always found that animation looks better when there are black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, I don't know why, but I do. It gives it a movie type feel, and I think they should do it with more animated series, though I guess it would look better with drama/action animated series more than comedies.\n\nK-C has done some great animation and then there are some bad spots with their animation. The only great animation which I believe K-C was at its peak was at the beginning with Rugrats up to the sixty-five episode plus a few specials milestone, Duckman, The Simpsons, and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters. During that time, they made some great strides in animation. However, once Rugrats came around again with new episodes in 1996, their style of animation grew into more greater detail which along with the humor took a dive with each passing season. The only animation which I really praise is what they did with As Told By Ginger. The animation style with ATBG of took a more serious tone as K-C and Nick looked for more older viewers.\n\nThe animation with Wild Thronberrries and Rocket Power had at some parts were plain and had too little detail at a fast pace. They should put a little more money into those shows instead of developing newer ways to animate Rugrats. Then again technology will always change animation in one way or another."
