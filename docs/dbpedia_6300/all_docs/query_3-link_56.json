        "text": "Terry Thoren, the production manager for popular Nickelodeon cartoons in the 1990s through the early 2000s, including “Rugrats” and “The Wild Thornberrys,” has turned his sights to education.\n\nThe Malibou Lake resident who was CEO for Klasky Csupo, the company that produced the shows, has remained busy in the fanciful world of cartoons.\n\nThoren, 63, never lost his zest for animation. He’s been studying the art form to find ways to use it for the betterment of children whether in schools, at nonprofits, in hospitals or elsewhere.\n\n“Animation knows no borders,” Thoren said at WonderGrove, his studio in Encino. “It’s the most powerful communicator of information in the world today. ”\n\nThoren is working to launch an educational series of cartoons in kindergarten through second grade classes in schools. Since he lives in the Conejo Valley, he hopes that a three-minute-per-day commitment to the educational cartoon series will find a footing with teachers and families in his hometown.\n\nAnimation can be a powerful teaching tool, he said. Young children form an emotional bond with animated characters, Thoren said, adding that studies show that lessons taught to youngsters by an animated character are retained 80 percent more than a lesson given in person by a adult.\n\nWonderGrove has developed a library of cartoons meant to model appropriate behavior in social skills, health, nutrition, safety and fitness. The three-minute shorts depict situations that are appropriate for children ages 5 to 7.\n\nThoren said the animated lessons help prepare children for the “test of life, not a life of tests.” The range of scenarios provide children with social and classroom skills, all aligned with the new Common Core standards.\n\n“We call it watch one a day and go outside and play,” he said.\n\nThoren’s team of animators has created 150 cartoons that touch on social issues young children can understand. He is also creating ways for children to interact with his characters and envisions hosting school contests that will allow a child to be featured in a cartoon.\n\nOne aspect of the series that speaks to educators is that the cartoons transition into real scenes. Children will see other kids having picnics, picking flowers, cooking with Grandma and so forth. Children will be encouraged to slow down and imagine what they see in the clouds.\n\nThe cartoon series has been used in the Betty Ford Center’s children’s program. The cartoons provide a gentle way of talking to children about addiction, which, according to Thoren’s research, affects about one in four families.\n\nSome episodes look at worldwide issues, such as water conservation. In one cartoon a child ponders what she would do without running water. She is shown traveling down to the river to fill buckets with water. The animation segues into a real-life video of a family that gathers water in the same fashion.\n\n“We put children in the situation,” Thoren said. “Empathy is so important.”\n\nThoren hopes his collection of animated shorts will play a part in creating an antidote for the negative media blitz that children experience daily."
