The recording was sent to a London theatre the band was due to play at but was found years later in a car boot sale by a historian.\n\nIn 2013, the BBC's \"The One Show\" reunited the pair with their letter, plus a reply from McCartney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sideburns of MLB great Don Mattingly — Season 3, Episode 17\n\nIn the 1992 episode \"Homer at the Bat,\" Mr. Burns recruits Major League Baseball players for his softball team, including the then-New York Yankees first baseman Don Mattingly.\n\nMr. Burns ends up benching Mattingly for not following the policy he has for the length of a player's sideburns. This actually happened to the Yankee captain in real life.\n\nIn 1991, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner fined him $250 and Mattingly was benched for not adhering to the boss' rule on hair length.\n\nWhen the episode aired a year later, everyone thought \"The Simpsons\" was spoofing the event, but it turned out that Mattingly had recorded his lines for the episode a month before his standoff with Steinbrenner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSiegfried and Roy tiger attack — Season 5, Episode 10\n\nThe Simpsons parodied entertainers Siegfried & Roy in a 1993 episode called \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling).\" During the episode, the magicians are viciously mauled by a trained white tiger while performing in a casino.\n\nIn 2003, Roy Horn of Siegfried and Roy was attacked during a live performance by Montecore, one of their white tigers. Roy lived but sustained severe injuries in the attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorsemeat scandal — Season 5, Episode 19\n\nIn 1994, Lunchlady Doris used \"assorted horse parts\" to make lunch for students at Springfield Elementary.\n\nNine years later, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found horse DNA in over one-third of beefburger samples from supermarkets and ready meals, and pig in 85% of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAutocorrect — Season 6, Episode 8\n\nSchool bullies Kearny and Dolph take a memo to \"beat up Martin\" on a Newton device in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" that aired in 1994. The memo gets quickly translated to \"eat up Martha\" — an early foreshadowing of autocorrect frustrations.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" was lampooning Apple's underwhelming Newton — the iPhone's ancient ancestor — that had just been released, and included shoddy handwriting recognition, according to Fast Company.\n\nNitin Ganatra, former director of engineering iOS applications at Apple, told Fast Company that this particular moment on \"The Simpsons\" served as inspiration to get the iPhone keyboard right.\n\nSmartwatches — Season 6, Episode 19\n\n\"The Simpsons\" introduced the idea of a watch you could use as a phone in an episode aired in 1995, nearly 20 years before the Apple Watch was released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe invention of The Shard — Season 6, Episode 19\n\nThe \"Lisa's Wedding\" episode from 1995 came with a lot of unexpected predictions. During Lisa's trip to London, we see a skyscraper behind Tower Bridge that looks eerily similar to The Shard, and it's is even in the right location.\n\nConstruction on the building started in 2009, 14 years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobotic librarians — Season 6, Episode 19\n\nIn \"Lisa's Wedding,\" we discover that librarians have been replaced with robots in the \"Simpsons\" universe.\n\nMore than 20 years later, robotics students from the University of Aberystwyth built a prototype for a walking library robot, while scientists in Singapore have begin testing their own robot librarians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCypress Hill performing with the London Symphony Orchestra — Season 7, Episode 24\n\nIn a 1996 episode titled \"Homerpalooza,\" the Simpsons watch in amazement as legendary rap group Cypress Hill performs with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nDecades later, a Cypress/LSO collab will happen in real life. The band announced a performance in July and also shouted out \"The Simpsons\" in its official statement.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be performing with the London Symphony Orchestra in such a prestigious venue as the Royal Albert Hall,\" the group said. \"It's a dream come true, a collaboration only 'The Simpsons' could have predicted.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson equation — Season 8, Episode 1\n\nIn a 1998 episode called \"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace,\" Homer Simpson becomes an inventor and is shown in front of a complicated equation on a blackboard.\n\nAccording to Simon Singh, the author of \"The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets,\" the equation predicts the mass of the Higgs boson particle. It was first predicted in 1964 by Professor Peter Higgs and five other physicists, but it wasn't until 2013 that scientists discovered proof of the Higgs boson in a £10.4 billion ($13 billion) experiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEbola outbreak — Season 9, Episode 3\n\nSome people maintain that \"The Simpsons\" predicted the 2014 outbreak of Ebola 17 years before it happened. In a scene from the episode \"Lisa's Sax,\" Marge suggests a sick Bart read a book titled \"Curious George and the Ebola Virus.\" The virus wasn't particularly widespread in the 1990s, but years later it was the top of the news agenda.\n\nEbola was first discovered in 1976, and though this latest outbreak has been the worst yet, it killed 254 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995 and 224 in Uganda in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney buys 20th Century Fox — Season 10, Episode 5\n\nIn the episode \"When You Dish Upon a Star\" that originally aired in 1998, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer produce a script Homer pitches. The script is being produced at 20th Century Fox, and a sign in front of the studio's headquarters reveals that it is \"a division of Walt Disney Co.\"\n\nOn December 14, 2017, Disney purchased 21st Century Fox for an estimated $52.4 billion, acquiring Fox's film studio (20th Century Fox), in addition to a bulk of its television production assets. The media conglomerate also has access to popular entertainment properties like \"X-Men,\" \"Avatar,\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe invention of the tomacco plant — Season 11, Episode 5\n\nIn 1999, Homer uses nuclear energy to create a hybrid of tomato and tobacco plants: the \"tomacco.\"\n\nThis inspired US \"Simpsons\" fan Rob Baur to create his own plant. In 2003, Baur grafted together a tobacco root and a tomato stem to make \"tomacco.\" Writers for \"The Simpsons\" were so impressed that they invited Baur and his family to their offices and ate the tomacco fruit themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald Trump as president — Season 11, Episode 17\n\nIn the 2000 episode, \"Bart to the Future,\" the show goes next level on its prediction talents when it name drops Donald Trump as having been POTUS.\n\nThe episode explores what Bart's life would be like when he got older. It features Lisa being president. While in the Oval Office, we hear her say: \"As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.\"\n\nIn 2017, Trump became the 45th President of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPot legal in Canada — Season 16, Episode 6\n\nIn the 2005 episode titled \"Midnight Rx,\" Ned travels to Canada with Homer, Grampa Simpson, and Apu and discovers that pot is legal in the country.\n\nIn 2018, Canada legalized recreational use of marijuana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaulty voting machines — Season 20, Episode 4\n\nIn 2008, \"The Simpsons\" showed Homer trying to vote for Barack Obama in the US general election, but a faulty machine changed his vote.\n\nFour years later, a voting machine in Pennsylvania had to be removed after it kept changing people's votes for Barack Obama to ones for his Republican rival Mitt Romney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. beats Sweden in curling at the Olympic games — Season 21, Episode 12\n\nIn one of the biggest upsets at the 2018 Winter Olympics, the U.S. curling team won gold over the favorite, Sweden.\n\nThis historical win was predicted in a 2010 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" called \"Boy Meets Curl.\" In the episode, Marge and Homer Simpson compete in curling at the Vancouver Olympics and beat Sweden.\n\nIn real life the U.S. Men's Olympic Curling Team won a gold medal after defeating Sweden even though they were behind, which is exactly how it played out on \"The Simpsons.\" The victory is the second curling medal ever for the United States (not including Marge and Homer's, of course).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple's Vision Pro virtual reality headset — Season 28, Episode 2\n\nIn 2024, Apple releases its virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro. Social media quickly fills up with public displays of people using the headset.
