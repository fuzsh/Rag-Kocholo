        "text": "It’s not even what Nick needed. I felt like it’s what kids needed.\n\n– Vanessa Coffey\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nOut of all the animation anniversaries I’ve been anticipated to celebrate in 2016, the 25th anniversary of Nickelodeon starting their brand of groundbreaking, one-of-a-kind animated originals (specifically with the charmingly bland Doug, the surprisingly adorable Rugrats, and the hilariously messed-up Ren & Stimpy Show) is the biggest one, aside from the 15th anniversary of The Fairly OddParents, on my agenda. And of course, Nick themselves have been hyping up this milestone of renaissance animation history all year long, spreading the #NickAnimation25 like wildfire on all their social media accounts. Also, they’ve done at least two major conventions: “Happy Happy Joy Joy: 25 Years of Creator-Driven Animation” at the Begovich Gallery in Fullerton, and the similarly-titled “Happy Happy! Joy Joy!: 25 Years of Nickelodeon Original Animation” at San Diego Comic Con. They both presented artwork from past, present, and upcoming productions (particularly Butch Hartman’s Bunsen is a Beast!, and the most anticipated thing in Nickelodeon Animation history, Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie), and had special guest appearances from creators such as Butch, Stephen Hillenburg, Craig Bartlett, Arlene Klasky, Jim Jinkins, and Jhonen Vasquez, as well as Nickelodeon Animation Studio founding mother, Vanessa Coffey. Unfortunately, I couldn’t go to neither of the events, but at least I’m able to view a hefty amount of photos and videos for my enjoyment (although I’m still not too sure if there’s art from underrated gems As Told by Ginger and T.U.F.F. Puppy, especially the former, of course)\n\nAnd coming soon, a sequel (sort of) to Jerry Beck’s addictive 2007 book Not Just Cartoons: Nicktoons! (which I’m going to review soon), titled You Can’t Do That on Television: The Rebellious History of Nickelodeon. I’m still waiting for the pre-order page, Amazon!\n\nNow enough about what Nick has been doing to celebrate. This special article is focusing on briefly telling the long journey of creator-driven animation making its comeback, a speech about why Nicktoons are so meaningful to me, my list of my 25 favorite Nicktoons, and finally, my tiny celebratory video. Let’s get slimed! On second thought, just looking at how people get slimed on the Kids’ Choice Awards, it would be a real pain to clean it all up.\n\nThe History of Nick Animation Finding its Voice\n\nI’m gonna borrow Mr. Peabody’s time machine so we can go as far back as 1988, when America met with an animation renaissance, which meant interest in the masterful, innovative animation of the Golden Age (from the ’30s to the ’60s) was brought back in a huge way, mainly thanks to big-screen hits Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Little Mermaid. Also, on the small screen, that wacky, radioactively-colored family, The Simpsons, gave prime-time animation for adults a spot not seen since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home (yeah, I’m sure you didn’t remember Hanna-Barbera producing another sitcom after The Flintstones, didn’t you?). As for the kids’ stuff, there were still mostly shows adapted from toys, books, comics, celebrities, live-action productions, video games, long-existing characters, and even food (at least in the case of Disney’s Gummi Bears). However, America’s #1 channel for kids, Nickelodeon, would start an intense mission to end the mundanity of American TV cartoons, and restart the delightful trend of creating cartoons how the creators want, not the bigwigs in their spinning desk chairs.\n\nVanessa Coffey, a producer and vice president of Nickelodeon at the time (she also worked on future Nick franchise Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), thought the state of television animation for kids was garbage…or at least, it lacked the spark present in animation of earlier decades, especially during the prime of Warner Bros. Cartoons’ brilliant comedies of the 1940s and 1950s. As her quote at the top of this article implies, she knew that those type of cartoons derived from the animators’ artistic freedom permitted by their respective studios were the ones that kids deserved to be exposed to, not necessarily what Nick themselves need for self-gratification. It may be expensive, but it would turn out worth it in the end. Before Doug, Tommy, and Ren and Stimpy, Nickelodeon’s animation lineup was mainly acquired from foreign countries, whether it be from Britain (most notably Danger Mouse and Count Duckula, both produced by Cosgrove Hall Films) , or Canada (like Inspector Gadget). Any American cartoons they had were just reruns of stuff like classic Looney Tunes shorts (which are, as mentioned already, the inspiration for the Nicktoons to begin with).\n\nBefore the original three Nicktoons were pitched to the network, Vanessa commissioned a couple of holiday specials to test out her goal of reviving creator-driven animation. Christmas in Tattertown (1988) was done by…get ready for this…RALPH BAKSHI! Yes, the man who made X-rated classics like Fritz the Cat made an edgy, yet still family-friendly X-mas special. Then again, even though his adaptation of Mighty Mouse from 1987 was short-lived (thanks to the “sniffing” controversy), Bakshi already made a huge contribution to the animation renaissance. Not to mention, Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures helped boost the career of a certain persnickety Nickelodeon animator from Canada.\n\nThe other holiday special was called Nick’s Thanksgiving Fest (1989), which was more directly produced in-house by Nickelodeon themselves. It was an anthology with two creatively-titled segments: “Thanksgiving Nightmare” by Kevin Altieri, and “Thanksgiving Dreams” by Joe Pearson. In between, Joey Ahlbum (a guy remembered for his Sesame Street cartoons, and his dinosaur and fruit bumpers for Nickelodeon) gave us some simple skits that involved turkeys, rabbits, vegetarian hunters, astronauts, and elephants working for peanuts by cramming cranberries into tin cans. Even though the special wasn’t seen as a huge game-changer by audiences when it aired, it obviously didn’t cancel the mission.\n\nAround 1989-1990, Vanessa ordered at least eight pilots/contestants to compete for the title of Nickelodeon’s first original Nicktoons:\n\nThunder Lizards (Joey Ahlbum again)\n\nChannel Zero (George Evelyn; I’d also like to note that even though the pilot is currently unavailable, we can still see the characters here)\n\nWeasel Patrol (based on a comic by Ken Macklin and Lela Dowling)\n\nDoug Can’t Dance (Jim Jinkins)\n\nThe Crowville Chronicles (by Cosgrove Hall Films)\n\nTommy Pickles and the Great White Thing (Klasky Csupo)\n\nTrash (also by Cosgrove Hall Films, though it’s stop-motion instead of 2D)\n\nBlg House Blues (John Kricfalusi)\n\nIf you have any knowledge of Nicktoons, you should have been able to guess which three charming pilots were the winners, and which five were the losers who bored the test audiences so much that they’d rather stare at a wall! I’m not kidding around!\n\nI would like to thank Patricia Miranda from Old School Lane for providing me this little-known information about the early stages of developing Nick’s original animation, with her video “Why Nickelodeon’s Thanksgiving Fest was Historically Significant for the Channel?”.\n\nThe executives at Nickelodeon knew that Jim Jinkins, Arlene Klasky, Gabor Csupo, Paul Germain, and John Kricfalusi all had potential when it came to unleashing creativity to help building their creator-driven animation empire. Each of the original three had their own unique backstory. Jim (who actually worked with Nick when the network was known as Pinwheel in the late ’70s) based Doug Funnie on his own awkward pre-adolescence in Virginia, and he wanted to publish a book with the character called Doug Got a New Pair of Shoes, but every single publisher in New York rejected! Jeez, it’s as if Oscar the Grouch hypnotized everyone in the Big Apple to be as grouchy as he is! Eventually, after Jim animated Doug and Porkchop prototypes in grapefruit juice ads and a bumper for USA Network, Vanessa Coffey excitedly caught interest in Jim’s idea, and gave him the opportunity to start up his own studio in New York, Jumbo Pictures (you know, the one with the giant egg logo), to make the pilot.\n\nBased in Hollywood, Klasky Csupo was already a very successful studio, given that they had The Simpsons under their wonky, Eastern European-influenced belt for three years. One day, when Arlene and Gabor were coming up with cartoon ideas for Sesame Street, they randomly wondered, if babies could talk, what would they say? Combine the characteristics of Arlene and Gabor’s own infant son, and the name of Paul Germain’s baby, and you got yourself Tommy Pickles! Peter Chung was hired to direct the HIDEOUS pilot, and Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo (and Pee-wee’s Playhouse, which launched the career of the creator of a certain football head) was brought over to composed the recognizable synthesized music. Then-Nick president Gerry Laybourne loved the pilot, so Rugrats was all set…except they realized the show would be much better if they gave Tommy and the twins some foils. Therefore, worrywart Chuckie and spoiled “princess” Angelica (based on a girl who bullied Paul) were born.\n\nMoving on to my favorite of the three, The Ren & Stimpy Show, I’m gonna leave it to John K. himself to explain his creation’s origin:\n\nI used to draw this retarded cat. He was somewhat influenced by the Bob Clampett cartoon called “A Gruesome Twosome”, which was a Tweety Bird cartoon. And it had these really cool-looking cats with big, bulbous noses, and it was a cartoon done in the mid-40s, but it was a throwback to ’30s cartoons when everybody had big, bulbous noses with a shine on them. I thought that was a really cool style. Around that same time, I found this postcard of a Chihuahua in a sweater. It’s a very funny picture, because there’s this psychotic-looking monster…in a cute sweater. And that, just right away, was a concept in my head that I thought was hilarious. I thought, what a great character that would make. So, I used to draw caricatures of this insane Chihuahua, and then I would do this Peter Lorre voice, and I’d act him out. “I’m here to murder your baby!” Joel Fanner [I think I spelled it right], who I worked with, he suggested one day, “Why don’t you put that Chihuahua character with your cat?” And I thought, “Okay! That’s a good idea.”\n\nAnd “a good idea” it certainly was. I mean, what could poor John K. do, after he left Ralph Bakshi, and suffered the consequences of trying to reboot Bob Clampett’s Beany and Cecil? He’s been trying to sell Ren & Stimpy for nine years; thus, as he said himself, he and the entire animation industry was lucky when Nickelodeon announced their search for fresh artistry. Originally, Ren and Stimpy would have been sidekicks in a series called Your Gang, because Vanessa initially didn’t like the idea of a dog slapping a cat around as the main feature of an independent series. Thank God she soon changed her mind.\n\nOkay, enough with the backstories. Time to sorta recreate the historic day in animation renaissance history. Nostalgia glasses required.\n\nThis cool, green painter was created by Doug Compton.\n\nAnd as a bonus:\n\nYou done reliving your childhood yet? If not, please finish, so that I can continue talking about Nicktoons. Thank you.\n\nWe can already figure out how Doug, Rugrats, and Ren & Stimpy, all successfully proved Nickelodeon’s worries concerning the expenses of producing original cartoons to be wrong. All three of them were very different from each other, and other cartoons produced at the time, and this is a case where it was a great thing. I can even go as far as to compare how these shows predicted a bright future for creator-driven animation to how Pixar’s shorts Luxo Jr. and Tin Toy opened the door to big possibilities for CGI. If John Lasseter could successfully ignore the naysayers, so could the people at Nick. And they did. Obviously.\n\nNow I’ll just briefly go into how each of the original three were individually important to animation. Before Doug, the closest thing to a slice-of-life cartoon that kids (and older people) could easily relate to was the Peanuts specials (remember the one about the girl with cancer). Funny enough, Jim Jinkins was influenced by Peanuts. Despite the characters (except for Doug Funnie himself) having unusual colors that wouldn’t be out of place on a Muppet production, not to mention the silly soundtrack provided by Fred Newman (who also voiced Doug’s “black” friend Skeeter), Doug was beloved for being so grounded in reality for a cartoon (at that time). It dealt with such relatable topics as bullying, infatuation, weight gain, self-esteem, creating a cartoon that unexpectedly causes controversy, and, most importantly according to Jim, honesty. In short, if it weren’t for Doug, we wouldn’t have such just-as-amazing slice-of-life cartoons as Nick’s own Hey Arnold!, and best of all, PBS’s Arthur! Both are gonna be 20 this fall!\n\nA fact about Doug I find interesting is that, during its 65-episode run on Nickelodeon (before Disney took over Jumbo), it won the Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite Cartoon, four years in a row! Now, I know Nick tends to let their own cartoons win every year (the last time a non-Nicktoon won was The Simpsons back in 2002, and that show isn’t even for kids at all!), but out of all the original three Nicktoons, why Doug? No offence to it, but kids are more likely to find the other two WAY more enjoyable than a rather mundane show about an average boy. Just a random thought.\n\nMoving on to Rugrats, while it has always been pretty popular, it wasn’t until the time during production hiatus in 1994 (caused by Arlene Klasky was acting like a whiny grouch, and Paul Germain leaving over creative differences) when those “dumb babies” became one of the biggest phenomenons in the ’90s. And nobody would have thought such a simple, yet rather clever little show about babies would be possible to win the admiration of rival animation producer Steven Spielberg of all people! And speaking of Hollywood royalty, Tommy and the gang are currently the only Nicktoons to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an achievement that not even SpongeBob has gotten yet! Not only that, but its movie in 1998 made over $100 million domestically, which is a first for an animated film not produced or distributed by Disney. However, critically-speaking, Rugrats in Paris did the best, while financially-speaking, Rugrats Go Wild did the worst. Either way, those babies have been Nick’s gold-laying geese throughout the mid-90s and the early 2000s. After having to let go of The Simpsons in 1992, the success of Rugrats made their parents (Klasky Csupo) more than happy. If it wasn’t for that show, Nick might not have given them more opportunities to make other great Nicktoons, such as Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, The Wild Thornberrys, and of course, As Told by Redhead! I mean Ginger. And don’t get me started on the spin-offs: All Grown Up! (based on a hugely successful 10th anniversary special from 2001), the four-episode miniseries Angelica and Susie’s Pre-School Daze (which nobody seems to remember/care about), and the direct-to-video Tales from the Crib (just fairy tales with Rugrats in ’em). In short, they’re all inferior to the classic. Rugrats lived a good life with 172 episodes, so there should be no need for a reboot.\n\nI’d also like to note that Rugrats was the first animated series to have not one, but two holiday specials focusing on Judaism, “Passover” and “Chanukah”. Everybody loved them… except for Jewish groups who complained about Grandpa Boris’ design looking like an offensive, Jewish stereotype or something.\n\nHowever, out of the three Nicktoons at the time, before Rugrats gained more popularity in the mid-90s, it was the outrageous Ren & Stimpy Show that sparked the most attention, and made just as big an impact on animation as any other Nicktoon…or any other ’90s cartoon, period. For this article, let’s not bother go into the drama between John K. and Nickelodeon, because this is already getting too damn long. With its gross-out gags, brutal slapstick, disturbing imagery, witty wordplay, questionable visual gags, adult references, and animation so deranged that it makes Tex Avery look sane, Ren and Stimpy were up there with Bart Simpson as one of the biggest delinquents in animation. They may not be considered good role models for kids, but they certainly are to a slew of other studios in the industry, such as Hanna-Barbera (2 Stupid Dogs and Cow and Chicken), Savage Studios (Eek! The Cat), hell even Disney (Shnookums & Meat)! Also, let’s not forget about Nickelodeon themselves! If it weren’t for that crazy Chihuahua and dumb cat, we might not have other outrageous shows like Rocko’s Modern Life, The Angry Beavers, CatDog, and of course, SpongeBob SquarePants! But you know what? Ren & Stimpy itself was influenced by the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s, so really, if it weren’t for Porky, Daffy, Tweety, Sylvester, and Bugs, Ren & Stimpy might not exist. And Nicktoons in general wouldn’t exist either.\n\nWell, that’s enough history. My God, it seems that I can’t keep it brief when it coming to talking about this type of stuff. Anyway…\n\nWhat Do Nicktoons Means to Me?\n\nWhile they might not have been as big a part of my childhood as Big Bird and the gang, Bugs and the gang, or Arthur and the gang, Nickelodeon’s groundbreaking lineup of amazing animated series has always been there to make me feel good. Although, since I’m a Canadian, I can only experience the Nickelodeon magic through channels like YTV, Treehouse TV, and later on, Nick Canada. Plus, Nick’s website used to be available to me…before it started to redirect me to YTV’s website. Man, I miss playing all those CatDog games.\n\nNow, I have to admit that, when I was very young, my experience with Nickelodeon Animation was mostly limited to the Nick Jr. shows. I loved me some Blue’s Clues, Dora the Explorer, Go, Diego, Go!, and The Backyardigans! There’s also Little Bear, but that was mainly a Nelvana production. As for the actual Nicktoons, SpongeBob SquarePants, The Fairly OddParents, Rugrats (even though I watched the movies just as much as the show), and CatDog have always been the most interesting to me, but SpongeBob and FOP, the two most popular of the 2000s, have always been the ones I watched the most. They were just so funny, exciting, and creative that it’s delightfully reasonable to see them as “top 10 great” when it comes to cartoons. It’s that simple.\n\nLater, I started to developed interest in other great Nicktoons, even if I didn’t watched them as often as my top two. After watching the otherwise panned movie on VHS in 2007, I was craving Hey Arnold!. Then, in 2009, by the time Nickelodeon Canada launched in November, I got an opportunity to experience the hilarious ingeniousness of Rocko’s Modern Life and The Angry Beavers. Since KaBlam! is extinct from airing on TV, I had to go on RetroJunk and YouTube to get into it. As for Ren & Stimpy, I had vague memories of watching it on Teletoon, and I used to think Ren was a rabbit. It wasn’t until I started binge-watching it on Netflix in 2011 when I’ve since became absolutely obsessed with this laugh-out-loud-hilarious show. Also in 2011, I gave the Canadian Nicktoon Wayside a chance, and instantly became obsessed with that offbeat show as well. Then, a few months later, I started getting attached to Butch Hartman’s third Nicktoon, T.U.F.F. Puppy, which I still find to be better than the overrated Danny Phantom. Also, there are a few cases, such as Sanjay and Craig and The Loud House, where I felt anticipated for the show before it officially comes out.\n\nThen came the years 2014 and 2015, when my love for Nickelodeon Animation suddenly escalated to very obsessive levels, to the point where I had an epiphany that said, “These guys are the studio I must work for in Hollywood!”. October 2014 was when I made one of the best decisions of my life as a cartoon lover: become a fan of the underappreciated Klasky Csupo gem, As Told by Ginger! More on that on my Ginger blog. Soon after, I pursued my goal of giving chances to Avatar: The Last Airbender, Invader Zim, Doug, Pelswick, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, My Life as a Teenage Robot, The Wild Thornberrys, Oh Yeah! Cartoons (besides the FOP shorts), Danny Phantom, Jimmy Neutron (other than the movie), Catscratch, and surprisingly enough, All Grown Up!. The first two mentioned are the ones I had the most luck with. Wow! That’s a total 12 Nicktoons I started to like in one year. And I still got a couple more to go, like El Tigre.\n\nOh, and on a sudden note, even though I don’t normally label it a Nicktoon, I loved to watch the puppet show Mr. Meaty on Saturday mornings on CBC. Now? I’m more indifferent towards that creepy thing than that other CBC/Nickelodeon co-production, Pelswick.\n\nBetween late 2014 and early 2015, I’ve became obsessed with Nicktoons more than ever before. My appreciation for the things that makes each of them good started taking over a hefty amount of space in my heart. I shared my first real list of favorite Nicktoons, a cheaply-animated short of my favorite characters dancing to an outdated song, a long PDF article saluting my favorite Nicktoons (which is now outdated as well), an article talking about why I want to work for Nickelodeon, and best of all, the most epic slideshow I’ve ever done at the time! All of these things and more are done with honest passion.\n\nSo you see, the Nicktoons mean a lot to me, on the same levels as Looney Tunes. Like every other cartoon I love, SpongeBob and the others make me feel like I’m wisely spending my time with these adorable examples of escapism. Whether I’m grinning at SpongeBob, Patrick, and Stimpy being idiots, feeling sincere sympathy for Ginger, getting playfully annoyed by the Rugrats’ naivety, getting angry at Timmy’s parents being neglectful nitwits, left stunned by Aang’s action scenes, or confused about CatDog’s anatomy, Nick always know how to get a reaction from me. Now, in case you don’t know, the biggest reason why I respect Nickelodeon Animation on the same veins as Disney and Warner Bros., and why I would love to work for them, is because their motto is “Kid-inspired, creator-driven.” The epiphany I mentioned earlier told me that Nick is always hungry for fresh talent, stuff they’ve never seen before. While it’s kinda mandatory for the network to request some little alterations to your concept, they still encourage you to do the show your way. Essentially speaking. That’s what I like, man! I already have a collection of original cartoon characters that I label “BerryToons”. Nickelodeon Animation would be a perfect environment for them. If I can’t make a show for all of my ideas, then I’ll just produce an anthology, a la Oh Yeah! Cartoons or KaBlam!. Oh my God! So much possibilities boiling in my head!\n\nIn conclusion, I am more than blessed about the existence of Nickelodeon and their Nicktoons. Thank you to all the talented creators, producers, writers, artists, executives, voice actors, and security guards for all the hard work they’ve done to successfully make the Nickelodeon network a bigger household name than ever before. And it all started with an insecure 11-year-old, a group of curious babies, and a pair of insane, polar opposites.\n\nMy Top 25 Favorite Nicktoons\n\nNow for the 25 Nickelodeon cartoons that I enjoy and take influence from the most, represented by custom fan art done by yours truly.
