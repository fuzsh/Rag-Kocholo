        "text": "JXP: Hello Mr. Peck. I would like to ask you a few questions. Im posting this interview on my cartoon website.Why did you create Squirrel Boy? What was your inspiration?\n\nEP: Hi Aristotle, I created Squirrel Boy as a modern version of cartoons from the 40's and 50's without literally mimicking the WB or UPA styles. I also wanted it to be a smart scripted show with complex story arcs and characters with fully dimensional personalities. Even the adult characters. Chris Painter was the head writer and did a fantastic job.\n\nJXP: Was Klasky Csupo involved with it?\n\nEP: Klasky Csupo was not involved, I developed this with Cartoon Network.\n\nJXP: What was it like working with Tom Kenny and Rick Horvitz?\n\nEP: Tom Kenny is an amazing talent and a wonderful person, and of course, a consummate professional. His character Leon is one of my very favorite characters I've created. Rick Horvitz was tons of fun. As Rodney's voice he was able to really cover his full range and fully utilize his comic abilities. We always recorded the main characters all together in the booth so they could feed off each other's energy. That was usually Rick Horvitz, Pam Adlon, Nancy Sullivan, Tom Kenny, and Kurtwood Smith.\n\nJXP: Why did Squirrel Boy and Duckman end?\n\nEP: Why did Duckman and Squirrel Boy end? I don't know, I ask myself the same question every morning.\n\nJXP: Was your work inspired from Gary Baseman?\n\nEP: I love Gary Baseman's work and he's a friend of mine, but I can't say a significant influence. I was at it many years before he appeared on the scene.\n\nJXP: Any advice?\n\nEP: Best advice I can give try to keep fresh and don't get discouraged....and keep on DRAWING!!!"
