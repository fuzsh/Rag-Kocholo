I loved the style of that show, I still do, even though our department was the only non-digital one because we were hand inking all the bg designs as the style required. Kudos to Carl Greenblatt & Dan Krall, who created the show and art directed it, respectively.\n\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\n\nI was an architect (in the Philippines) for a short while and had just passed the Continue reading\n\nLouie del Carmen\n\nWhat is your name and your current occupation?\n\nMy name is Louie del Carmen and I‚Äôm a story artist at Dreamworks Animation\n\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\n\nNothing real crazy but I was an FM DJ in Manila before I came to the US and one of my early jobs after coming to America was a hotel room service order taker.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you‚Äôre proud to have been a part of?\n\nI‚Äôve learned from EVERY show i‚Äôve worked on whether they were hits or not but I loved my last TV gig on the MIGHTY B! √Ç KIM POSSIBLE was another awesome show. √Ç INVADER ZIM was challenging and the people where downright insane. In other words: FUN. √Ç RUGRATS was where I learned to board and eventually direct series so that was memorable. √Ç The few episodes I boarded on GRIM ADVENTURES of BILLY AND MANDY really challenged and eventually elevated my work. √Ç Really proud of those. √Ç And of course, working alongside some really amazing, world class talent on KUNG FU PANDA.\n\nHow did you become interested in animation?\n\nI probably didn‚Äôt recognize it but growing up watching Japanese toons like Tetsujin (Gigantor) and Mazinger Z as well as all the american fare like Johnny Quest, Herculoids and Space Ghost, I guess I was always interested. √Ç It wasn‚Äôt until I was Continue reading\n\nDonna Grillo\n\nWhat is your name and your current occupation?\n\nDonna Grillo. √Ç Casting and Dialog Director.\n\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\n\nI‚Äôve always been in the entertainment business ‚Äì that‚Äôs crazy, right?\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you‚Äôre proud to have been a part of?\n\nWell, Spongebob Squarepants is certainly the most iconic show I ever cast but as far as favorites go I‚Äôd have to say ‚ÄúSquirrel Boy‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Angry\n\nBeavers‚Äù just for the sheer laughs and freedom to create crazy characters. ‚ÄúDuckman‚Äù was also an awesome show ‚Äì so friggen funny!\n\nHow did you become interested in animation?\n\nAlthough I loved Looney Tunes when I was growing up I wasn‚Äôt that big of an animation fan until I started working at Klasky Csupo.\n\nWhere are you from and how did you get into the animation business?\n\nI‚Äôm an L.A. girl.

Once I dressed up as Elmo.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you‚Äôre proud to have been a part of?\n\nI am proud to be one of the 200 artists that were involved in the Manifest Hope:DC art exhibition celebrating the inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2008. I flew to Washington DC a few days before the inauguration to participate in the art exhibit and the energy was amazing. The first Obama painting I did ‚ÄúUnite America‚Äù was sold in an auction during the campaign. The√Ç image was also√Ç published in a multicultural calendar.√Ç The second painting ‚ÄúThis Moment‚Äù, was published in an Art of Obama book, exhibited at the Bowers Museum and now hangs on my wall.√Ç Someone I knew was doing a brief stint at the White House and passed out a bunch of posters of my paintings to the people in his department.

So, although I don‚Äôt have physical proof, I think I can say that my paintings are in the White House.\n\nHow did you become interested in animation?\n\nI√Ç had always wanted to teach art but after meeting with my advisor and finding out that Continue reading\n\nDebbie Bonzon\n\nWhat is your name and your current occupation?\n\nMy name is Debbie Bonzon and I am currently working as a free-lance timer, storyboard artist, illustrator.\n\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\n\nI‚Äôve worked as a bread deliverer to stores and restaurants, landscaper, farmer, drywaller, caterer, bicycle and running gear salesperson, advertising sales, and as an illustrator for demonstrative evidence in the courtroom.What are some of your favorite projects you‚Äôre proud to have been a part of?\n\nMost recently I am very proud to have worked as a timer on the ‚ÄúCurious George‚Äù √Ç tv series, 2nd movie and Christmas Special. √Ç Also, the Rugrat feature movies were a blast. √Ç At Warner Bros. √Ç I really enjoyed storyboarding on ‚ÄúPinky and the Brain‚Äù and timing on ‚ÄúFreakazoid‚Äù. √Ç √Ç At Nickelodeon, I really liked timing on ‚ÄúCat Scratch‚Äù and directing on ‚ÄúOswald‚Äù. √Ç Also, storyboarding on the ‚ÄúTick‚Äù was a kick! √Ç As an animator, many years ago, I really enjoyed working on the first ‚ÄúTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles‚Äù series in Dublin. http://www.animationinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Debbie-reel.mov\n\nHow did you become interested in animation?\n\nIn high school, I wanted to work at Disney. √Ç I loved animation, mostly the Warner Bros. shorts!\n\nWhere are you from and how did you get into the animation business?\n\nI was born in Albuquerque NM and grew up in Los Alamos, NM (the atomic city). √Ç After attending a few different universities trying to find a major that could land me a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù and I realized, like it or not, that I was an art enthusiast, I completed my BFA at the University of NM. √Ç I had looked at the brochures from Cal-Arts, but, was intimidated by the photographs of other students, who were way cooler than I ever was or wanted to be, I began to look for something here in Albuquerque after I graduated. √Ç There was a small studio that produced commercials for clients around the world and after 2 weeks of graduating, I put on my best outfit and ‚Äústopped by‚Äù to see if they needed any help. √Ç √Ç When I entered the front office, I noticed they didn‚Äôt have a receptionist and thought I could do that. √Ç As I waited for someone to come to the front, the owner of the company passed by, stopped, and asked if he could help me. √Ç I told him I had just graduated and would love to work for them doing whatever they needed. √Ç √Ç He said I could work in the paint dept. (cell painting!) √Ç They paid minimum wage, at that time $3.35/hour! √Ç I didn‚Äôt care, I actually felt I Continue reading\n\nGregory Hinde\n\nhttp://www.animationinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bp_reel_2.mov\n\nWhat is your name and your current occupation?\n\nGregory Hinde, Music Composer www.GregoryHinde.com\n\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\n\nI worked for an industrial air-conditioner company cleaning ducts by climbing through them.

I also worked as a checker on √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnimaniacs√¢‚Ç¨¬ù and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìPinky and the Brain√¢‚Ç¨¬ù for WBTV before I started composing full time. My training is as a classical musician. Being a part of production really helped me understand the process of animation and the importance of telling a story with the music I write. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m proud of the score and song work I did, along with Drew Neumann, on √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy√¢‚Ç¨¬ù at Cartoon Network and the final season of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe Wild Thornberrys√¢‚Ç¨¬ù.
