        "meta_description": "Klasky-Csupo is an American animation company founded by artist and producer Arlene Klasky and her then-husband, animator Gabor Csupo. Starting off as a independent animation company in the couple's Hollywood apartment, the studio has become famous for its Nicktoons from The Renaissance Age of Animation, such as Rugrats, Aaahh Real Monsters, Rocket Power and As Told by Ginger. Besides their work for Nickelodeon, the studio also produced the animated shorts and 61 episodes of The Simpsons in addition to the character design of Dr. Nick Riviera, based somewhat on Csupo. Similarly, bits of Arlene Klasky's life had made it into their shows. She lost her mother at a young age the way Chucky Finster lost his in Rugrats, and Tommy Pickles is based on her and Csupo's own son.",

In 2004, Klasky-Csupo shut down production on most of its shows, including Rugrats, and in 2006, shut down production on all of its shows except the new pilots the couple created. After 20 years since The Simpsons animation changed over to Film Roman, Klasky-Csupo started to have its animation credit in the ending credits of a Dexter's Laboratory music video (\"Dee Dee and Dexter\" by They Might Be Giants). In fall 2006, Klasky-Csupo announced development of 14 new animated pilots, which will be up for sale at a later date; however, none of these projects has been seen.\n\nWorks animated primarily by Klasky-Csupo include:\n\nShows and Segments\n\nAaahh Real Monsters\n\nAll Grown Up!\n\nAs Told by Ginger\n\nDuckman\n\nRocket Power\n\nRugrats\n\nSanto Bugito\n\nStressed Eric\n\nThe Wacky Adventures Of Ronald McDonald\n\nThe Wild Thornberrys\n\nFilms\n\nImmigrants (L.A. Dolce Vita)\n\nRugrats Go Wild\n\nRugrats in Paris\n\nThe Rugrats Movie\n\nThe Wild Thornberrys Movie\n\nanimated in small part created by Klasky-Csupo include:"
