        "text": "If you're a kid, you can immerse yourself from morning til night in the cartoon fantasy worlds of Klasky-Csupo. You can eat Rugrats breakfast cereal, head to school on a Rocket Power skateboard, come home and watch As Told by Ginger on TV, read a Wild Thornberrys book, brush your teeth with a Rugrats toothbrush, and go to sleep on Rocket Power pillows. Not since Disney has an animation house held its youthful audience in such thrall.\n\nKlasky-Csupo has been around for more than 20 years, but it's not yet a household name. Maybe that's because few know how to pronounce the name. (As the phonetically spelled name of the company's animated-advertising arm indicates, it's Class-Key Chew-Po.) Still, the privately owned company is a mini media empire, which includes two record labels, a book publishing arm, three commercial-art divisions, an online store full of licensed character merchandise, and, of course, the animation artists behind the Rugrats and the Wild Thornberrys TV series and feature films, including The Wild Thornberrys Movie.\n\nKlasky-Csupo also has a distinctive style, instantly recognisable by kids, that's far from the smooth, flowing, cuddly Disney style. The cartoons' verbal humour tends to be hip and arcane, full of references that may sail over the heads of children but keep their parents interested. The kids (and occasional grown-ups) in Klasky-Csupo cartoons tend to be drawn with grapefruit heads, freckles, frizzy hair, bug eyes and wide mouths. It's an offbeat, shorthand visual style that company co-founder Arlene Klasky has described as east European. Which makes sense, since that's where co-founder Gabor Csupo hails from.\n\nBorn in Budapest, he got his start working at Hungary's Pannonia animation studio. In 1975, while on a tourist visa visit to Yugoslavia, he and several artist friends escaped to Austria by walking through a 2.5-mile train tunnel beneath the Alps. After six months in a German refugee camp, Csupo made it to Sweden, where he worked on the country's first feature-length cartoon.\n\nThree years later, he met Klasky, a graphic designer visiting Stockholm. They fell in love, and he followed her back to Los Angeles. In 1981, the now-married couple founded Klasky-Csupo in a spare room in their apartment. While they found work immediately - commercials, movie trailers and titles, and other promotional shorts - their first big break came in 1987 when they were asked to animate some Matt Groening-designed characters for segments of The Tracey Ullman Show. This was the origin of the Simpsons, whose first three series, starting in 1989, Klasky-Csupo animated, winning two Emmys.\n\nThe success of The Simpsons led to a meeting with executives at Nickelodeon, the kid-oriented cable channel. Klasky, Csupo and co-producer Paul Germain pitched an idea inspired by their own toddlers: what if infants could talk to each other? The result was Rugrats, which has been on the air since 1991 and became a worldwide hit that formed the cornerstone of both the Klasky-Csupo and Nickelodeon empires.\n\nOther Nickelodeon series followed, some also inspired by Klasky and Csupo's children. (Their two sons are now teenagers.) They included Rocket Power (about kids who enjoy surfing and skateboarding), As Told by Ginger (about an adolescent trying to navigate the treacherous terrain of the high school social pecking order), and the upcoming All Growed Up (a Rugrats sequel imagining the toddlers as prepubescent tweenagers).\n\nIn 1995, after 16 years of marriage, Klasky and Csupo divorced, but continued to work together. Csupo said, in a 1999 interview: \"It's a lot easier for us now. It was more difficult when we were married and brought our work problems home with us. We're very good friends, we share children and we respect each other,\" added Csupo, who has since remarried and fathered a daughter and son. \"People are always trying to dig up dirt, but there's really nothing to hide - we have a very good, friendly relationship.\"\n\nKlasky-Csupo began to challenge Disney in 1998 with the release of The Rugrats Movie. It topped $100m in US theatres, the first non-Disney animation to do so. A 2000 sequel, Rugrats in Paris, was nearly as successful, grossing $76m. Nickelodeon was having success adapting other series into movies, and the network and Klasky-Csupo turned to making a big-screen version of another long-running K-C series, The Wild Thornberrys.\n\nLaunched in 1998, the show is about the Thornberrys, a family of naturalists led by debonair, British-born documentary filmmaker Nigel Thornberry (voiced by Tim Curry). The central character is 12-year-old Eliza, a bespectacled girl who possesses a secret gift: she can converse with animals.\n\nThe Wild Thornberrys Movie aimed for the sweep of a Disney animated feature like The Lion King or Tarzan on a budget; it cost a reported $25m to produce, compared to a reported $80m for Lion King and $130m for Tarzan. Released in the US in December, it stands a good chance of joining Disney's Lilo & Stitch as a nominee for the animation Oscar and its featured song, Paul Simon's Father and Daughter, may well take the slot usually occupied by a Disney cartoon in the best original song category. (Nominations will be announced on February 11.)\n\nNot everything by Klasky-Csupo has turned to gold, however. Attempts to create adult material have met with mixed results. An animated detective spoof called Duckman, starring Seinfeld's Jason Alexander, never grew beyond cult status. Stressed Eric, which had a brief life on the BBC, flopped in America. (Another adult animated series, The Immigrants, will debut later this year on TNN, a sister cable channel to Nickelodeon in the Viacom empire.) Live-action series and movies in development have yet to get off the ground.\n\nA Hollywood restaurant/art gallery, called Lumpy Gravy (a reference to an album by Frank Zappa, the American musician who inspired the young Csupo to learn English), folded after a couple of years. Csupo himself has recorded two albums of ambient electronica, neither of which has sold enough to make him consider quitting his day job.\n\nMost worrisome, The Wild Thornberrys Movie has, despite the show's avid following, earned just $37m in the US since its release on December 20 - not enough to cover production and marketing costs. The movie's failure could be chalked up to bad timing; the release may have been swamped by the Two Towers juggernaut and Chamber of Secrets. Or the poor showing could be part of a larger trend of kids' indifference to movies featuring traditional, hand-drawn animation. Of the recent big animated hits - Shrek, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, Ice Age, and Lilo & Stitch - all but Lilo & Stitch were computer-animated, and only Jimmy Neutron was based on a Nickelodeon series. Disappointing box office for other recent animated movies - the Nickelodeon-based Hey Arnold! The Movie, the Cartoon Network-spawned Powerpuff Girls Movie, and Disney's Treasure Planet, all hand-drawn - suggest that kids will avoid in cinemas what they can easily see at home. But The Wild Thornberrys Movie will probably be a big success when it comes out on home video in a few months.\n\nThere's no sign that any of Klasky-Csupo's setbacks have blunted its ambitions. A couple years ago, the company took over a six-storey office building in Hollywood at the corner of Sunset and Vine that, along with the Hollywood and Highland complex and the Kodak theatre (where the Academy awards ceremony is now held), was credited with anchoring the revival of the once vice-plagued neighbourhood. Under CEO Terry Thoren, the company has gone from less than 100 employees in 1994 to about 500 today. And this summer brings what could be Klasky-Csupo's ultimate franchise movie: The Rugrats Meet the Wild Thornberrys."
