        "text": "Hi babes, just came to this article:\n\nhttp://www.tmz.com/2007/02/13/johnny-depp-getting-animated-about-bukowski/\n\nThe full text:\n\nJohnny Depp Getting Animated About Bukowski\n\nPosted Feb 13th 2007 7:13PM by Claude Brodesser-Akner\n\nBreaking News: Forget \"Dead Man's Chest.\" Johnny Depp has just boarded a fascinating new film project called \"How the Dead Love,\" an animated film that mines four short stories from the hard-living poet and quintessentially L.A. novelist, Charles Bukowski.\n\nWhat's more, he's doing it with Gabor Csupo, the Hungarian-born animator and producer behind the first three seasons of \"The Simpsons,\" as well as the subsequent Nickelodeon hit shows and movies \"Rugrats\" and \"The Wild Thornberrys.\"\n\nThis weekend, Csupo's first-ever live action film, \"Bridge to Teribithia,\" -- an adaptation of the family-friendly Katherine Paterson book of the same name -- will open nationwide for Fox and Walden Media. But he's not done with animation yet; Csupo's screenwriter on \"Teribithia,\" Jeff Stockwell (\"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys), helped fashion the new \"Dead Love\" script, which was originally penned by another prototypical Angeleno novelist and screenwriter, Bruce Wagner (\"I'm Losing You\").\n\nBukowski would be proud, largely because \"Dead\" is not a Saturday morning cartoon. Csupo tells TMZ that \"How the Dead Love\" is very much for grown-ups and more akin in tone to R. Crumb's ribald '70s animation classic, \"Fritz the Cat\" than, say, the Thornberrys' family-friendly \"Darwin the Chimp.\" (Crumb, fittingly, was a frequent Bukowski collaborator, illustrating such iconic books as \"There's No Business\" and \"The Captain is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship\").\n\nDepp will voice the main character of the film, and will also produce it with Csupo via Depp's own production company, Infinitum Nihil, which is part of the Warner Bros.-based film finance company, Initial Entertainment.\n\nDeveloping...\n\nI'm not surprised whatsoever that more Bukowski stories are being brought to life in one form or another... his work is a virtual gold-mine of possibilities that can ignite the imagination of film-makers. I wouldn't mind seeing Depp, Sean Penn, or even Jeff Bridges in any Bukowski-related project; so Penn may still get his chance and be lucky enough to get paid more than a dollar... Bridges could do that great laid-back California style\"”with humor!\"”that Bukowski used to talk about, and none of these actors would need to have a face like a train- wreck in order to create something authentic in atmosphere... The problem with Mickey Rourke for me is that when he was reciting \"The Tragedy of the Leaves\" in front of the bathroom mirror, he had no idea what he was reading and his vocal inflections had nothing to do with the poem, showing just how limited he was as a performer... I haven't seen \"Factotum,\" but I have a feeling from what I've read that it may be seriously lacking in humor, and I feel that if Bukowski hadn't cut loose somehow in those salad days and have a good laugh at it all, he'd never have made it... So surely there's a film-maker out there who understands that a good Bukowski project requires someone who knows how to read a good poem, with a sense of humor as a life-saver coming through from time to time as comic relief.\n\nQuite a few years is right. I had a sit down with Klasky Csupo back in 2000 I think, and they showed me the script and story boards for this thing. I had completely forgotten about it, heh.\n\nKlasky Csupo apparently had a web site showcasing some adult themed animations, including some Bukowski inspired tales at http://www.globaltantrum.com/ but its not online as I type this...\n\nHere are some stills and you can view the episode called Horse Sense at:\n\nhttp://media.putfile.com/Bukowsky-Horse-Sense\n\nEdit April 2009: See Below"
