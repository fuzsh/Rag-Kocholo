        "text": "Klasky Csupo, the independent animation studio responsible for such properties as Rugrats, Wild Thornberrys and Aaah! Real Monsters, has an all-new digital series: RoboSplaat.\n\nAll-new episodes of RoboSplaat will premiere on the Klasky Csupo YouTube Channel and official Instagram page twice per week (Wednesday and Saturday) into early 2021. Klasky Csupo has created over 100 mini episodes of RoboSplaat.\n\nRobosSplaat will also appear in the new game Splaativerse, where players take a photo, record their voice prompted by a question and choose from a list of surprise sound effects which are all woven into Splaat’s cartoon.\n\nArlene Klasky said: “The feedback on Instagram from animation fans that grew up on Klasky Csupo shows has been enormous. They seem to be uplifted by RoboSplaat’s offbeat personality, humor and nostalgia for their childhood. While Gabor and I were producing our series, we never dreamed the lasting impact our shows would have on those kids.”\n\n“It’s so important, now more than ever, that we use our voices to promote uplifting messages of positivity, understanding, and friendship,” said Greg Cipes, voice of RoboSplaat. “This is what Klasky Csupo has always stood for, and I am both humbled and inspired to champion that cause through the mouth of the iconic RoboSplaat.”"
