        "text": "The Simpsons has been around for an impressive 35 seasons, which means many of us have grown up on the much-loved American cartoon.\n\nDespite spending many afternoons binge-watching the show, there is one little detail that some fans have only just started to wonder.\n\nWhy in 35 years have any of the main characters not aged?\n\nThe fact was recently brought up by Facebook user, Peace Matters, who asked the question in one of his well-known reels.\n\n“So THIS is why they don’t age?! SIMPSONS RUINED,” he wrote, adding the caption: “It took me 27 years to realise THIS about The Simpsons.”\n\nAs it turns out – or maybe just a whack theory put forward by the mega fan – there is a reasonable explanation for why Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and every other character on The Simpsons, don’t age and it can be found in an episode that aired back in season four of the long-running animation.\n\nHomer died and this has all been a “dream”\n\nIn episode three, Homer talks with God and it is here that we are given the biggest clue.\n\n“Homer asks God about the meaning of life. God answers ‘you will find that out once you die’ and Homer says that he can’t wait that long, to which God replies ‘you can’t wait SIX MONTHS?'” the video explains.\n\nFast forward to an episode six months later and we see Bart pranking his father with an explosive beer can. The entire house explodes and Homer is put in a coma after the accident.\n\nThe fan then goes on to share his mind-blowing theory based on this scene.\n\n“From this moment on, Homer has been in a coma, so Homer never woke up from this coma and the entire story of The Simpsons is happening inside his head,” he says.\n\n“God told him he would die and it happened exactly as he said and this is why nobody ages in the show.”\n\nDude, it’s a CARTOON!\n\nWhile the fan’s mind was clearly blown, others weren’t so convinced, calling the theory complete nonsense.\n\n“Ugh… I hate when people start to come out with their stupid theories… especially on cartoons that we all grew up watching. People are always trying to ruin others childhood memories,” one follower commented.\n\nOthers offered a more straightforward answer to the question that seems to have bothered the fan.\n\n“The reasonable explanation is they are CARTOONS,” one person laughed.\n\n“No cartoons ever age. Cartoon characters don’t age because of a floating timeline,” another agreed.\n\nOthers echoed: “Or it could be that they’re all just animated characters and not human beings” and “the internet is losing its grip on itself. This is dumb.”\n\nThe creators wanted it this way\n\nThere’s also the fact that being dead and being in a coma are two very different things, but we’ll just slide past that one.\n\nOthers joined the conversation sharing that it is actually a common decision by creators of animations to not make their characters age because it helps with continuity.\n\n“The reason is because producers made a decision early on to not age the characters. Therefore continuity was easier than dealing with aging characters,” one person shared.\n\nAnother person pointed out that while the show has been airing for 35 seasons, it doesn’t exactly equate to 35 years.\n\n“Because there are only 762 episodes and each episode represents one day. It’s taken 33 years in real life for them to accurately represent 2 years, 1 month and 2 days of show time. This would explain why nobody has aged, because it’s only been 2 years in the show.”\n\nPersonally, I have never looked so deeply into a popular cartoon until now. Actually, I lie. Those Bluey theories are all-consuming too. Doh!"
