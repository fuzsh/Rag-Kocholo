        "text": "Throughout the historic core of downtown Springfield, and even along the downtown side streets of Shelbyville (Eugene), tributes to The Simpsons pop up in unexpected places.\n\nStart with the official Simpsons mural (2014) on the west wall of the Emerald Art Center building... this celebrated mural was christened by FOX television and Matt Groening himself, and even Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson, came out for its big reveal. (Go inside the Emerald Art Cent to take pictures with the Simpsons on their living room couch!)\n\nDespite this one official, glorious mural — over time, smaller, sneakier street art has crept into building cervices and along side streets to celebrate and immortalize Springfield's fictional alter-ego.\n\nNow... before you go blaming Bart, it seems that much of this recent street art can be attributed to local muralist Bayne Gardner. Gardner has worked with the respective cities and private businesses to place murals of all types across the Eugene - Springfield metro area. His diverse paintings were part of the EUG 20x21 mural project dedicated to increasing public art in the roll out to the World Athletics Championships Oregon22 at Hayward Field. And you can also see his work in the children's corridors at PeaceHealth's Riverbend hospital, on the side of local businesses, and in the training rooms beneath Hayward Field. A self-taught artist, Bayne is generous with his time, often involving students in collaborative school projects. And because of his playful nature... he doesn't like to announce all his mural locations — you have to spot them yourself!"
