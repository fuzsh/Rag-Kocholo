        "text": "Gabor Csupo is a renowned animator and co-founder of the animation studio Klasky-Csupo. He began his career in his homeland, working at the PannÃ³nia animation studios for four years before leaving Hungary in 1975. He met American-born animator Arlene Klasky while he was working in Sweden. The two hit it off and formed Klasky Csupo, which has produced a number of popular animated series including the Nickelodeon hits \"Rugrats,\" \"The Wild Thornberrys,\" and \"Aaahh!!! Real Monsters.\" Before his own company took off, Csupo worked on the acclaimed and long-running animated primetime comedy series \"The Simpsons.\" His unusual accent proved popular in the writers' room, leading to the development of the character Dr. Nick Riviera, who bears a vague resemble to Csupo. Beyond writing, producing, and animating cartoons, Csupo has branched out to directing live action films, including the tween drama \"Bridge to Terabithia\" and the children's fantasy tale \"The Secret of Moonacre.\" He also owns and operates his own record label, Tone Casualties, which specializes in industrial, noise, experimental, and ambient music acts. Founded in 2004, the label released albums by Holger Czukay, Drew Neumann, Paul SchÃ¼tze, Borut KrÅ¾iÅ¡nik, Wahorn, and Controlled Bleeding, as well as his own works."
