The pair soon married, settled in Los Angeles, and in 1982 started an animation and graphic design company, Klasky Csupo Inc., in a spare room of their home.\n\nAlthough they're now ending their marriage, having filed for divorce in January, the pair's professional collaboration is stronger than ever. Their Hollywood studio today employs more than 200, is animating three TV shows, working on a movie deal, and pumping out animated ads. Another Klasky Csupo creation, Rugrats, is the No.1 cable kids' show. Credit in part an unprecedented wave of growth in demand. \"The amount of animation done in the golden age of animation was insignificant compared to what's being done now,\" says Harvey Deneroff, editor of The Animation Report, an industry newsletter. Says Klasky: \"Were we ever in the right place at the right time.\""
