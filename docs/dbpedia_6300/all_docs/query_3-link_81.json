        "text": "“Bunch of thin-skinned, no-humor pansies! You tell them an ice-breaker or two about women’s libbers, gays, environmentalists, several minorities, the homeless, couple of religions, anorexics, obese people, the handicapped, old farts, baldness, and people who walk real goofy because they’ve just had a vasectomy, and suddenly, they get all sensitive, like I offended one of them or something!”\n\n***\n\nFor the first time ever on The Ink and Paint Corner, I will be taking a look at an entire series instead of just one short film or episode. This is a bit different than what I’m normally used to so please bear with me. Today we’ll be discussing one of the first animated shows made solely for adults, and one of my personal favorite television series, Duckman, Private Dick/Family Man. This show was created and developed by Everett Peck, produced by Reno & Osbourn Productions alongside Paramount Network Television. The shows characters and premise were based off of the Dark Horse Comics that Peck had written. The show aired on the USA Network from 1994 until 1997 and ran for 70 episodes.\n\nThis show will, undoubtedly, not appeal to everyone. The humor comes from constantly poking fun of political correctness, societal norms, insecurities of the main character, addiction, disabilities, and just plain setting things on fire. It seems as if nothing is safe from the writers of this show but the comedy isn’t begrudgingly and blatantly “in your face” as it is with shows such as Family Guy (which I believe we can all agree went downhill FAST) nor is it purposely vulgar and obscene for the sake of edginess like South Park. The show is, at its core, a satire of modern society and the trials and tribulations of life.\n\nThis series stars Jason Alexander, whom most of the world knows as George Costanza from Seinfeld, as the titular Duckman. Describing Duckman as a character is easy, he’s a morally bankrupt, sexually depraved, mean spirited, rapacious, lewd, lazy, and selfish person. The challenging part comes from describing how great a character he is. With a laundry list of negative qualities, its hard to see how a show with this lead could work. He has a penchant for crude double entendres, but he also worries about being a good father. He has a short temper but he’s also just trying to make it through life. He is a well developed, complex, and, dare I say, relate-able character.\n\nThe show’s premise revolves around the aforementioned Duckman and his dealing with being a widower (his wife, Beatrice, has been dead one year prior to the start of the series) and trying to be there for his three sons, a dim-witted eldest son named Ajax (Dweezil Zappa) and his siamese twin geniuses Charles and Mambo (Dana Hill and E.G. Daily). When his wife passed, she left their house to her twin sister, Bernice (Nancy Travis), in order to ensure that Duckman and her children were taken care of. But, as it turns out, Bernice hates Duckman and constantly berates and belittles him.\n\nDuckman works as a private investigator alongside his best friend, Cornfed (Gregg Berger). Although the company is named after Duckman, Cornfed does most of the work. A consistent running gag throughout the series is the fact that Cornfed is talented at almost anything he does and often solves the cases they acquire without Duckman’s help. Their secretaries are two Care Bear-esque dolls named Fluffy and Uranus (Pat Musick). These two are meant to represent the “moral center” and “political correctness” that society forces the mainstream media and, by exposure, the citizens to uphold. And Duckman kills them. Every. Single. Episode. The (yet another) running gag pertaining to Duckman’s constant mutilation of Fluffy and Uranus is one of the comedic highlights of the show, with the writers continuing to find new and inventive ways to off them.\n\nThe animation for the series was done by none other than Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo of Klasky-Csupo, the same animation team famous for doing Rugrats, As Told By Ginger, Aaahh Real Monsters, and the first three seasons of the Simpsons. Their trademark style of animation is definitely apparent here and is as wonderful to look at as ever.\n\nOne thing that I noticed while re-watching this series is that it never stops being funny. Every episode had at least one moment where I laughed out loud but the humor never feels forced and most, if not all, of my chuckling came from the clever writing and witty dialogue. There are multiple references and parodies throughout the series run. Some are spelled out for us, such as in Where No Duckman Has Gone Before (a Star Trek parody) and Hamlet 2: This Time Its Personal (which retells the story of Hamlet with the show’s main cast), while others are more subtle such as Room With A Bellevue (which parodies One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest) and About Face (who’s plot has basis in the story of Pygmalion).\n\nAmong the crude humor and perverse actions of the characters, there are tender moments emphasizing their struggles and serves to give an ounce of humanity and realism to animated water fowls. Its honestly very beautiful how two characters like Duckman and Bernice (who can barely stand to be in the same room with one another) can share these wonderful scenes in which they show compassion for each other and understand one another’s plight.\n\nDuckman is a very thought provoking show with a surprising amount of heart. It takes political and social satire to the next level and left several lessons ingrained in my mind. It brings light to the fact that its okay to be imperfect and Duckman makes imperfection an art form. Duckman is a truly beautiful television series.\n\nI feel as if I haven’t done this series justice here and I highly suggest you check this one out if you haven’t already. I can guarantee that you’ve never seen anything quite like this before."
