Other shows they did however I was never a big fan of.\n\nDadMom AngryPants said:\n\nI guess it would have ended with all of the other Klasky-Csupo shows in the mid-2000s, because didn't the studio mostly shut down? Unless SpongeBob's popularity kept them in business or something.\n\nAlso it would be ugly.\n\nAren't the weird character designs part of Klasky-Csupo's charm though?\n\nIf SB were made by that company, or were even designed by them..... man, my curiosity has piqued! Spongebob is a show about weird-looking sea critters who live in a nautical setting. A show that takes place underwater would of course be filled with wavy lines, squiggles, curves, and weird shapes.\n\nI think it'd be awesome-looking. Maybe not as overtly cute, but that style could lend itself well to the weird setting of the show.\n\nNow.. imagine if the entire show looked exactly like Stephen Hillenburg's concept art! There's something I'd love to see!"
