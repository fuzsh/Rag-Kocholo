        "text": "Right above is a cool collage I created last night for a unique, innovative, groundbreaking Hollywood animation studio that has been around since 1982. The people who brought us the first First Family of prime time animation since the Flintstones, one of the first and best of Nickelodeon's Nicktoons, and not to mention, one of the creepiest logos of all time (you know which one)! Klasky Csupo (pronounced CLASS-KEY CHEW-PO; remember that)! They might have played a major part of your childhood during the 1990s and early 2000s, with such great shows as Rugrats, the first 61 episodes of The Simpsons (plus the shorts from The Tracey Ullman Show), The Wild Thornberrys, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, Duckman (which I've just became an obsessive fan of), As Told by Ginger, and others. My top four Klasky Csupo cartoons are (#1) The Simpsons, (#2) As Told by Ginger, (#3) Rugrats, and (#4) Duckman. I've yet to become a fan of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters and the Thornberrys. Right now, I have the enthusiasm to briefly and vaguely salute this once major animation company. They're still around, only...not doing as much. I'll explain in a moment.\n\nAnyway, my opinions on Klasky Csupo were initially mixed; the stories were fine, their logos were impressive, but I mostly recognized them negatively for their ugly character designs, and crude, off-model animation style (especially as seen on the first two seasons of The Simpsons, the shorts preceding them, and the earliest Rugrats episodes\"). And with the exceptions of Rugrats and The Simpsons, I didn't even had much interest for their shows. In 2009, I was briefly a fan of that British sitcom they did the first six episodes for, Stressed Eric, but now I hate it after having an epiphany on how disgusting that \"Sex\" episode was to me. *shudder*. But now, ever since I became a fan of Ginger last fall, I grew to be more appreciative towards Arlene and Gabor's company, and they're now in my list of top 10 favorite animation studios...which I haven't made yet.\n\nHowever, I still don't think that their character designs are so beautiful (although it mostly depends on the character, and I honestly think Angelica's mom's a hot tamale), and their animation of The Simpsons and the early episodes of Rugrats are hideous. Oh. and the Ginger pilot's butt-ugly, too.\n\nWatch it if you dare. Also, I honestly feel sorry for Klasky Csupo, because it has been over ten years since they've created a successful new series for television (All Grown Up! to be exact). By 2008, the studio isolated themselves from the light of TV, and now, the least they're doing is online comics, and a web series based on their infamous \"Robot\" logo thing (check out their Facebook). Nickelodeon are a bunch of ungrateful pricks; KC was one of the reasons (specifically with those \"dumb babies\") why the channel was number one with '90s kids! Then, what happened? By the start of this century, certain nuisance of a sponge came along, Nick spent most of their time, money, and scheduling on him, and screwed over all of Klasky Csupo's Nicktoons like garbage! And on top of that, that V of Doom (Viacom) rejected all of the pilots they pitched (you can find some of them on Klasky Csupo's YouTube channel, and Gabor Csupo's YouTube channel). Awww! Why couldn't you green-lit Psyko Ferret, Nick? And the less said about how Rugrats Go Wild could be to blame why KC has lost their thunder, the better.\n\nAnyway, time will tell when exactly Klasky Csupo will make its big comeback into TV and film somehow. In the meantime, let's just honor them for playing such a huge part in our '90s/early 2000s cartoon-obsessed childhoods (and adulthoods). I really love these guys, their work, and their cool logos (I ain't afraid of that Splaat)! I wish I could be able to help KC come back to TV, maybe by bringing back the Sheltered Shrubs gang.\n\nThe very first episode (aired) of The Simpsons, made possible by Klasky Csupo in 1989.\n\nTommy's first birthday, and the start of the marvelous Nicktoons in 1991.\n\nDuckman is two types of dick: private eye, and a huge public jerk!\n\nGinger is talented in and passionate about writing. That's only one of the reasons why\n\nI see her as a great character and role model. Dream on, Foutley!\n\nI honestly think Dodie in \"Fair to Cloudy\" was creepier than Splaat. Did you know that this thing\n\ndebuted on a VHS tape of a cartoon Klasky Csupo made in 1998 based on the slightly less creepy Ronald McDonald?\n\nSome eye candy for the boys (and girls, probably):\n\nIt's Courtney! IT'S COURTNEY!! *wolf-whistle*\n\nGet those bikinis ready (and maybe something to stuff them with if you want), because March/Spring Break is almost here! Please drink, party, and flirt responsibly this year."
