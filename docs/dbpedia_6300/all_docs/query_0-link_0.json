        "text": "Klasky-Csupo, Inc. (pronounced \"Class-key Chuppo\") is a multimedia entertainment production company which specializes in animation and graphic design located in Los Angeles, California and it was founded by the American artist and producer Arlene Klasky, the master Hungarian animator Gábor Csupó and their nephew Attila Csupó in 1980, hence the company's name. It was known for co-producing a majority of Nickelodeon shows.\n\nKlasky-Csupo did the animation of The Simpsons Ullman shorts and the first three seasons of the series until the animation was taken by Film Roman, though the shorts were all completely animated from the ground up in-house over there (AKOM, of South Korea, took on the role as doing the in-betweening, coloring and filming when the show proper was renewed). The company had a major argument with the executives of the show about \"Some Enchanted Evening\", declaring \"maybe this shit isn't funny!\" (What they basically meant when they said that was that the show's writing quality was the real problem.). The episode that was originally going to be the first one (and was produced as such), but was left as the first season finale, since the animation was not good for the producers.\n\nKlasky-Csupo[]\n\nTitle Original Run Creator(s) Produced By The Simpsons 1989–present Created by Matt Groening (Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó).\n\nOriginal shorts (1987-1989), and first 61 episodes only.
