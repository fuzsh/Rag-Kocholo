        "text": "Ugly Cartoons\n\nStyle is something that’s very important in today’s animation. People have their own way of doing things, and that extends to cartoons. When you were a kid you’d turn on the television to watch your favorite cartoons and see the goofy, loose style of classic Looney Tunes. Or the darker, more tightly-defined models of action cartoons, such as Batman: The Animated Series. The 90s was the apex of all this: you could watch all these different cartoons with different styles that were meant to be accessible to different audiences. One thing that was big in the 90s, though, were UGLY cartoons.\n\nYou know the ones: weird facial expressions, more off-the-wall movements, and trying their best to not be constricted by the animation rules of yester-year. One of the most well-known examples of this back in the 90s were John Kricfalusi’s Ren & Stimpy. You all know Ren & Stimpy; that weird-ass cartoon from back in the early 90s. One of the original Nicktoons! Cartoons were coming off the rigidness of the 80s, which was full of cartoons based on toys or games. It was refreshing to see original content that wasn’t trying to get you to buy something. And with that freedom, something new was born.\n\nY’see back in the 80s it didn’t matter how good the show looked. That’s why you got shit like He-Man and Thundercats, with their barely-moving bodies and flat colors. It was a fucking eyesore, but hey, it sold toys, so who’s complaining? Then the 90s went STOP. Creators began to take more control of what they produced. It wasn’t about trying to sell a toy or video game, it was about trying to create a cartoon for the sake of creating a cartoon!\n\nAnd with that, a whole new world of freedom was granted to creators. A person could pitch a cartoon WITHOUT it being tied to something. John K was one of the pioneers who took advantage of this: Ren & Stimpy certainly was unique. In fact maybe a little too unique; John was fired from his own show. But he started a trend of ugly cartoons, one that was continued by an animation studio named Klasky-Csupo. Klasky-Csupo is mainly known for their flagship cartoon, The Rugrats. It aired around the same time as Ren & Stimpy, and definitely was nowhere near as outlandish as it’s fellow Nicktoon.\n\nThough that’s not to say Rugrats didn’t have some weird design choices. Animator Peter Chung, who worked on the pilot, made sure to implement strange camera angles to make the audience feel small, just like a baby. Then there was the character designs, like Tommy’s weird... scrotum... head. In fact they all kinda had weird heads in that show. Anyway, the weirdness didn’t really take off with Klasky-Csupo until Aaaah! Real Monsters. I was never a huge fan of the show but I do remember that the weirdness the show carried was part of it’s charm. It was a show about monsters, after all. Everything had these faded dark and bleak colors. It made everything feel strange and eerie\n\nThen Klasky-Csupo made other shows like Rocket Power and As Told By Ginger that continued the style of Rugrats, but they all still had these weird abstract looks to it. You got Ginger with her weird chewed bubblegum lips and you got this motherfucker.\n\nBut they were oddly normal shows about tween drama and EXTREME SPORTS. They were the kinda thing where if they were live-action you wouldn’t even blink. That’s not to say Klasky-Csupo were the only guys making weird stuff, though. You had Mike Judge’s Beavis and Butthead and Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s South Park. Very crude, very stiff, very... gguuuh.\n\nBut the great thing about these shows is how well they used their ugliness. Beavis and Butthead and South Park are known for their crude humor and writing in ADDITION to their crude look. All of it’s very deliberate and it makes the writing more apparent to the viewer, which was their intention all along. Then the 2000s kinda rolled around and kinda began to blur the lines. Television animation was now becoming cleaner and more brightly-colored, thanks to the influence of shows such as Powerpuff Girls and Dexter’s Laboratory, both of which used high-stylized and dynamic animation with simpler designs and movements.\n\nThese shows felt more... contained. Another factor was the popularity of anime in the West, which began to surface in the late 80s and early 90s in the West. Anime, at least usually, follows a general list of conventions. That’s not to say all animes look exactly the same but it’s easier to spot differences between Western cartoons at first glance than in anime. Animators who are fans of anime sometimes let that show in their style (hell, look at any Genndy Tartakovsky joint), leading to much cleaner, more appealing looking work. And that’s fine and dandy. Hell, I LOVE shows like Samurai Jack and the like.\n\nBut I do miss the days of more unconventional and ugly styles. Shows like Flapjack and Secret Mountain Fort Awesome harken back to that (though the latter is… not great), and I feel with the looser styles of Uncle Grandpa and the upcoming Clarence we’re starting to see that style reviving itself, since people who were fans of those styles back in the 90s are making cartoons now.\n\nOne thing I often notice is that people will write off a show just because it has an ugly style. I understand that not everyone likes that kind of thing, but just because something doesn’t look cute doesn’t make it unappealing, necessarily. With Ren & Stimpy I wouldn’t consider either character cute or charming, but I would consider them well designed and fit the style of the show they’re in. The thing about ugly cartoons is that we don’t realize that usually it’s a STYLE CHOICE and that there are rules and conventions that they even follow on making their characters look appealing to the audience. Good design doesn’t mean it has to be cute like Mickey Mouse or Hello Kitty; good design means good design.\n\nIt’s why a show like Problem Solverz is a trainwreck visually because while it’s an ugly cartoon and it looks the way it does intentionally, it’s not a particularly well-designed cartoon. Characters look flat and unappealing, colors and designs constantly clash. It’s painful to watch and while I actually don’t hate Problem Solverz’s style (at the very least, it’s interesting to see) it’s not something I would consider suitable for animation.\n\nIn the end, style is a TOOL; the same as a pencil or paintbrush is. It should be used to better suit the type of show you’re making. If you’re making something like a Hello Kitty cartoon, obviously you want it to look adorable because that’s the entire idea of the franchise. But if you want something gross and odd-looking like a horror cartoon, then ugly is the way to go!"
