        "text": "Gabor Csupo directed Bridge to Teribithia, so he's apparently moved on to directing live-action movies.\n\nThe first few seasons of Rugrats were not only cleverly written (which is apparently the doing of Paul Germain and a group of writers that eventually left), but the character designs weren't that ugly. The show was created around the same time Klasky-Csupo was the animation house for The Simpsons, so I could see some of Matt Groening (whose art style wasn't the lushest but at least was appealing and easy on the eyes) rubbing off on Rugrats. Even the lesser-quality followups aren't too ugly.\n\nDuckman was adapting Everett Peck's art style to animation, and the K-C art actually fit the gritty nature of the show, likewise an uglier art style worked with AAAAAHHHHHH! Real Monsters.\n\nIt's everything from the Jumangi cartoon onward that goes south. Not only is the art style of those shows utterly repulsive, but since there's nothing in the shows that compliments the art, it makes them painful to watch. And the weak writing doesn't help.\n\nIt's everything from the Jumangi cartoon onward that goes south. Not only is the art style of those shows utterly repulsive, but since there's nothing in the shows that compliments the art, it makes them painful to watch.\n\nIt's not really the in-house KC style as much as it was crappy character design. I think the Rugrats characters looked pretty good to be honest, and even today I rather like the designs. However, the stuff from Ginger, Rocket Power and especially Thornberries insults my eyes. Ugh.\n\nWeren't they a marrried couple writing team who are now divorced? So I think they are history now, but maybe they can make a comeback, but I doubt it. I wouldn't want to work with my ex, no matter how much they might still be friends, it might be best to just leave it at that.\n\nOf course divorce doesn't equal end of business partnership, but when does that type of arragement work?\n\nIt's funny how that ever since Nick stopped hiring them to produce shows, the company suffered tremendously.\n\nYes, since Nick was completely and utterly the only channel that ordered and aired series from them. As for what Klasky-Csupo is doing now, they are working on several animated pilots to pitch around to networks. Unlike their generic design that they are/were famous for, these are all in different animation styles. Here are the pilots they are working on:\n\nAce Bogart, Space Ape\n\nBig Babies\n\nCommander Bunsworth\n\nRonnie Biddles\n\nChicken Town\n\nGrampa and Julie, Shark Hunters\n\nSugarless\n\nZeek and Leo\n\nWiener Squad\n\nRollin' Rock Starz\n\nTwinkle\n\nRicky Z\n\nJunkyard Teddies\n\nLittle Freaks\n\nI hope this answers your question...\n\nlivingfruitvirus said:\n\nThe studio did it to themselves. Pumping out several mediocre shows that all looked the same, while also treating their artists like crap and refusing to pay them overtime, and Gabor Csupo refusing to sign a union contract ever. For a studio that makes cartoons, they sure can't stand cartoonists.\n\nIn 2006 they dissolved the remainder of their 401(k) program.\n\nzoombie said:\n\nWeren't they a married couple writing team who are now divorced?

By the end of their tenure on Nick they had clearly gotten into a rut creatively with shows that looked like endless carbon copies of one another, treating your workers like dirt is never good for business, and it doesn't matter how friendly you want to say you are, it's NEVER a good idea to work day to day with your ex."
