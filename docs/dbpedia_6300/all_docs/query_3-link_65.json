        "text": "Now, you’ll may remember Klasky Csupo for their work on Rugrats and other famous cartoons that aired on Nickelodeon and Fox. Well, what would I tell you that their final ever movie to date was supposed to be an adult animated TV show for the American TV Channel, Spike.\n\nHowever, this one didn’t actually make it onto Television due to Spike’s decrease in animation, but this TV show was none other than the film we now know as Immigrants. Originally it was supposed to have a marathon when it aired with additional episodes to come along with it but never happened due to all episodes that were ever made got combined into one and was turned into a movie.\n\nWhat was Immigrants?\n\nBasically in context; Immigrants was supposed to be an Adult Animated TV Series on Spike, an American TV Channel. However, Immigrants actually never aired on the channel along with the additional episodes it was supposed to air with, instead was turned into a film for both American and Hungarian audiences. This movie is in fact the final ever Klasky Csupo movie to date and the only one to be aimed at Adults. This is also the only project in the company to be solely written and directed by Gabor Csupo.\n\nThe movie is basically about Joska, a Hungarian immigrant in Los Angeles, shares an apartment with Vladislav, a Russian immigrant. In their quest for the “American Dream,” they encounter all kinds of troubles, wild adventures, and comical situations. The pair are routinely saved by their big hearts and loyalty to each other in this unlikely tale of friendship in a foreign country. This was a short description from the movie’s Wikipedia page, but the movie has all of its episodes combined into one.\n\nImmigrants is also known by the names; L.A. Dolce Vita and Immigrants: L.A. Dolce Vita. Even though this film originated as an American TV Show, it got a Hungarian release with a complete set of Hungarian Cast Members for their version (I’m not sure if it’s reanimated by the studio or dubbed over). But in Hungary, the movie’s name is titled as; Immigrants – Jóska menni Amerika\n\nWhere can I watch Immigrants?\n\nWell, you’re quite lucky to hear that you can watch the entire movie on YouTube, though the film is for older audiences which I’ve brought up quite a few times, but I’ve seen certain clips from Immigrants and it was really good. Below is the full movie itself on YouTube, the only copy of it. Turns out the original episodes have disappeared from Gabor’s YouTube Channel along with several Klasky Csupo Projects, but his work is incredible!\n\nYou can follow Gabor over on Twitter\n\nIs this really the final film from Klasky Csupo\n\nThe bad news is, it is. Though that didn’t mean Klasky Csupo stopped making projects, but Gabor did produce and direct some live action movies soon after, but I think most people will remember the iconic style. But though I think it would’ve looked really nice as a TV Show and this serving as a Movie Adaption towards the original unaired TV Show, but it is what it is.\n\nThat’s all I have at the moment for my latest review. Keep an eye out for more in the future!\n\nRelated Posts"
