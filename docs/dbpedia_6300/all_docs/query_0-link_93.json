        "text": "The Original Theme Song\n\nThe New Theme Song\n\nIt has been over two decades now since The Simpson’s became its own successful animated series. That is longer than I’ve been alive! So, essentially, I grew up off of the Simpson’s. I remember loving it as a kid, even though I never quite got the jokes. Over the years the Simpson’s has become one of the most well-known and well-recognized show of all time! Only now, playing a close second to the “spin-off” animated series; “Family Guy”.\n\nEvery so many years technology advances and evolves. So, every so many years, The Simpsons was created using a different and more improved program. The show itself has evolved. From jagged lines, dark backgrounds and low animation to smooth lines, bright colors and very high definition animation. Watching the animation in The Simpsons evolve even inspired me to take up Animation as my Major.\n\nThe Simpsons originally started off as a series of 30 second clips on the award winning television show, The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987. The creator, Matt Groening, named the immediate members of the family after his own family; with the exception of Bart, which is, in actuality an anagram for “brat”.\n\nDue to the clips miraculous popularity, The Simpsons became its own half-hour comedy series on January 14th, 1990. It was an instant hit! The show has since won the Emmy for the most outstanding animated program in 1990, 1991, 1995 and 1997! The show’s success has inspired movies, spin-offs and popular phrases like “Doh!” and “Eat my shorts!”\n\nThe main cast is centered around the actual “Simpson” family which includes the father and main “protagonist” Homer. The stay-at-home mother Marge. The hell-raising son, Bart. The book-worm saxophonist daughter, Lisa and the baby, Maggie who is known to communicate by sucking on her pacifier and occasionally shooting the richest man in town. (Mr.Burns)\n\nThe series has been around for over twenty years and in those years technology has evolved to great, new heights and in turn, the animation process for the Simpsons has changed several times over. Each time more advanced than the last, and became one of the most successful animated programs off all time!\n\nSince the shows creation The Simpson’s have used several different U.S.A and international animation studios to create the episodes. Throughout the time the show was still just a group of animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, the animation was created directly at Klasky Csupo; a multimedia entertainment production company in Los Angeles, Ca. Who continued work on The Simpsons for the first three seasons before moving onto other shows such as “Rugrats” and “The Wild Thornberrys” on Nickelodeon. When The Simpsons was introduced as an actual animated series Fox Studios had to subcontract several international studios, located in Korea, to help with the increased workload that the series brought. These studios included AKOM, Anivision, Rough Draft Studios, USAnimation, and Toonzone Entertainment.\n\nThe Simpson’s animation process is one in-which the different aspects of animation are covered by the different animation studios. First, USAnimation draws the storyboards, designs and creates new characters, backgrounds and props as well creates the character and background layouts. From there, Animatics screens the work before it is sent to the writers at Gracie Films to make any changes before the work is shipped over seas. Then, the international studios draw the in-between frames, the ink, the paint and then render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States for Fox to review and air three to five months later.\n\nThe first three seasons of the series was animated by Klasky Csupo in the United States. In 1992, the series productions company, Gracie Films, switched to Film Roman, who continue production on the show to this day. As of season 12 the series animation switched from the traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint, but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until season 14. The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was “Radioactive Man,” in 1995. Since then, The Simpsons has developed and improved on its digital ink processes and, on February 15, 2009 the series began high-definition production for Season 20. The first episodes to be aired in high-definition was “Take My Life, Please”. This move to HDTV followed up after “The Simpson’s Movie”, which actually took over ten years to be created due to the constant evolution of technology. This move not only set the standards for all other animated series but included a new opening sequence that Matt Groening called “A complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of the animation.” But completely worth it!\n\nOne of the many interesting aspects of the creation of The Simpsons that sets it apart from other animated series is that the entire cast of the characters are voiced by only 6 voice actors!\n\nVoices Mr.Burns, Mr. Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Kent Brockman, Dr.Hibbert, Lenny, Principal Skinner, Otto the bus driver, and others.\n\nVoices Homer, Grandapa Abe, Barney, Krust, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Hans Moleman and others.\n\nVoices Moe, Chief Wiggum, Apu, Comic Book Guy, Carl, Cletus, Professor Frink, Dr.Nick and others.\n\nVoices Bart, Nelson, Ralph, Todd Flanders and others.\n\nVoices Marge, Patty and Selma.\n\nVoices Lisa"
