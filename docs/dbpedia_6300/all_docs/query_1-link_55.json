        "text": "As the 1926 catalog stated: “Seattle is several hundred miles nearer to China than any other trade routes across the Pacific…if this is the gateway through which the blessed gospel must reach millions yet in darkness, it is an ideal place to train and equip those who shall carry it to these needy souls…”\n\nBy 1940, Simpson was offering a choice of programs: Theology, Missiology and Bible/Music. By 1945, it had officially become the western regional school of the C&MA.\n\nSimpson University was founded in 1921 as Simpson Bible Institute by W.W. Newberry, who served as its first president. Established in Seattle, Washington, the school was named in honor of Albert Benjamin Simpson (1843-1919), a Presbyterian minister who pioneered the Bible institute movement during the late nineteenth century and founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Initially offering a two-year program of study, the school was designed to promote spiritual growth and prepare students for Christian life and service, especially overseas.\n\nIn 1955, the school moved to San Francisco, and its name was changed to Simpson Bible College since it was now granting bachelor’s degrees. Over the years, the college continued to broaden its academic offerings so that by the time the half-century mark was reached in 1971, it had become a more comprehensive liberal arts college offering professional as well as biblical studies. That same year, the name was changed to Simpson College.\n\nAnother historic milestone was passed in 1989 when Simpson relocated to its current location in Redding and began building a new campus, which is still a work in progress. Since the move, undergraduate enrollment has grown from less than 200 to more than 1,200. Graduate programs (including the School of Education and A.W. Tozer Theological Seminary) have been established, and the Adult Studies (ASPIRE) program was added. In 2004, Simpson College became Simpson University.\n\nToday, Simpson students represent a range of Christian denominations. Typically, the largest segment are members of The Christian and Missionary Alliance; the remainder are associated with more than 30 different denominations and several independent churches. They represent a mix of ethnic backgrounds, and they come from a number of states and foreign countries.\n\nThe faculty, as well, reflect a broad range of evangelical backgrounds. Educated at a cross-section of institutions across the nation, they are also experienced in international study and ministry.\n\nSince the early 1950s, the logo-statement of the college has been “Gateway to World Service.” Although our original mission has expanded since 1921 and alumni of today serve in a variety of ministerial and lay professions, Simpson University maintains its focus on global service and its passion to deliver the gospel of Christ to those still lost in darkness.\n\nThere is one God,(1) who is infinitely perfect,(2) existing eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.(3)\n\nJesus Christ is the true God and the true man.(4) He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary.(5) He died upon the cross, the Just for the unjust,(6) as a substitutionary sacrifice,(7) and all who believe in Him are justified on the ground of His shed blood.(8) He arose from the dead according to the Scriptures.(9) He is now at the right hand of Majesty on high as our great High Priest.(10) He will come again to establish His kingdom, righteousness and peace.(11)\n\nThe Holy Spirit is a divine person,(12) sent to indwell, guide, teach, empower the believer,(13) and convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.(14)\n\nThe Old and New Testaments, inerrant as originally given, were verbally inspired by God and are a complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men. They constitute the divine and only rule of Christian faith and practice.(15)\n\nMan was originally created in the image and likeness of God:(16) he fell through disobedience, incurring thereby both physical and spiritual death. All men are born with a sinful nature,(17) are separated from the life of God, and can be saved only through the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ.(18) The portion of the impenitent and unbelieving is existence forever in conscious torment;(19) and that of the believer, in everlasting joy and bliss.(20)\n\nSalvation has been provided through Jesus Christ for all men; and those who repent and believe in Him are born again of the Holy Spirit, receive the gift of eternal life, and become the children of God.(21)\n\nIt is the will of God that each believer should be filled with the Holy Spirit and be sanctified wholly,(22) being separated from sin and the world and fully dedicated to the will of God, thereby receiving power for holy living and effective service.(23) This is both a crisis and a progressive experience wrought in the life of the believer subsequent to conversion.(24)\n\nProvision is made in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ for the healing of the mortal body.(25) Prayer for the sick and anointing with oil are taught in the Scriptures and are privileges for the Church in this present age.(26)\n\nThe Church consists of all those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, are redeemed through His blood, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Christ is the Head of the Body, the Church, (27) which has been commissioned by Him to go into all the world as a witness, preaching the gospel to all nations.(28) The local church is a body of believers in Christ who are joined together for the worship of God, for edification through the Word of God, for prayer, fellowship, the proclamation of the gospel, and observance of the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper.(29)\n\nThere shall be a bodily resurrection of the just and of the unjust; for the former, a resurrection unto life;(30) for the latter, a resurrection unto judgment.(31)\n\nThe second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is imminent(32) and will be personal, visible, and premillennial.(33) This is the believer’s blessed hope and is a vital truth which is an incentive to holy living and faithful service.(34)\n\n[1] Deuteronomy 6:4, [2] Matthew 5:48, [3] Matthew 28:19, [4] Philippians 2:6–11, [5] Luke 1:34–38, [6] 1 Peter 3:18, [7] Hebrews 2:9, [8] Romans 5:9, [9] Acts 2:23–24, [10] Hebrews 8:1, [11] Matthew 26:64, [12] John 14:15–18, [13] John 16:13; Acts 1:8, [14] John 16:7–11, [15] 2 Peter 1:20–21; 2 Timothy 3:15–16, [16] Genesis 1:27, [17] Romans 3:23, [18] 1 Corinthians15:20–23, [19] Revelation 21:8, [20] Revelation 21:1–4, [21] Titus 3:4–7, [22] 1 Thessalonians 5:23, [23] Acts 1:8, [24] Romans 6:1–14, [25] Matthew 8:16–17, [26] James 5:13–16, [27] Ephesians 1:22–23, [28] Matthew 28:19–20, [29] Acts 2:41–47, [30] 1 Corinthians 15:20–23, [31] John 5:28–29, [32] Hebrews 10:37, [33] Luke 21:27, [34] Titus 2:11–14"
