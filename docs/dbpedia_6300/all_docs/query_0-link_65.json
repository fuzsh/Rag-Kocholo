A Monster, the McDonalds VHS tapes, and especially Rugrats. So weird they were super janky just a short time before they started producing every other cartoon that wasn't the Simpson's in the 90s...\n\nI think they entered a partnership with Nickelodeon. And from the sounds of it the Simpsons team were not Klasky fans.\n\nI don't mind the more traditional stylings of the early seasons, but season 7's clean and precise style will always be my favorite look for the show.\n\nI missed the way that Bart's head would twist like this. Maybe the only quirk from the Klasky Csupo seasons that I look back fondly on, otherwise, I think I prefer the animation after that era.\n\nP\n\nI think they entered a partnership with Nickelodeon.

It was because James L Brooks didn't understand animation at the time and wanted immediate changes. Unfortunately, reshoots aren't that easy in animation (especially during the cel animation days).\n\nKlasky Csupo later animated Simpsons cameos in Duckman.\n\nAren't those in between frames? They are drawn like that intentionally and are \"off model\" by design.\n\nYeah basically it helps accentuate movement in animation with less frames being drawn. Most people won't see it but still is funny\n\nYeah basically it helps accentuate movement in animation with less frames being drawn. Most people won't see it but still is funny\n\nExcept in this case everyone saw it. Bart used to talk like that when he was saying something sassy. He'd turn his head to put a snap on a word and his mouth would stay facing the other way for a moment.\n\nI believe cartoons who don't act in a way that's way that makes sense in 3D called a cheated angle; a well documented pheromone.\n\nI worked on The Simpsons Game (the then-old-gen versions), and there was a lot of stuff in the design doc about keeping the characters correctly on-model despite having a free-rotating camera.\n\nI didn't work on the feature *myself* - so specifics here might be a bit off - but if I recall correctly, on our version it was set up so the face would actually have an animation attached to it, moving the features appropriately - except the animation wasn't tied to time as you'd expect for an animation, but instead tied to camera angle; the end result, hopefully, being that the face always looked 'correct' as you spun the camera around the character.\n\nYeah basically it helps accentuate movement in animation with less frames being drawn.

A lot of the time it's used for motion effects, if something is moving quickly, but can be used for other purposes, too.\n\nThe Art of the Smear: A Secret Animation Trick - Ceros Inspire\n\nHow do you animate movement without drawing every step frame-by-frame?

They're not supposed to have these tall eyes.\n\nOh man, I hope Lenny is ok."
