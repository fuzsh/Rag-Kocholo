        "text": "The Guardian\n\nBritish newspaper\n\nFormerly (1821–1959):\n\nThe Manchester Guardian\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 9:52 AM ET (AP)\n\nThey look like — and link to — real news articles. But they're actually ads from the Harris campaign\n\nThe Guardian, influential daily newspaper published in London, generally considered one of the United Kingdom’s leading newspapers.\n\nThe paper was founded in Manchester in 1821 as the weekly Manchester Guardian but became a daily after the British government lifted its Stamp Tax on newspapers in 1855. “Manchester” was dropped from the name in 1959 to reflect the newspaper’s standing as a national daily with a positive international reputation, and its editor and editorial staff moved to London in 1964.\n\nThe Guardian has historically been praised for its investigative journalism, its dispassionate discussion of issues, its literary and artistic coverage and criticism, and its foreign correspondence. The Guardian’s editorial stance is considered less conservative than that of The Daily Telegraph and The Times, its main London competitors, but its reporting is also marked by its independence. The paper was once called “Britain’s non-conformist conscience.”\n\nIts editorial approach is credited to the 57-year tenure of Charles Prestwich Scott, which began in 1871, when the paper covered both the Prussian and the French sides in the Franco-German War. As Scott once described his paper’s publishing philosophy, “Comment is free. Facts are sacred…. The voice of opponents no less than of friends has a right to be heard.”\n\nThe paper is owned by the Scott Trust, which also owns the Guardian Media Group. Income from the group supports the newspaper and allows it to remain financially secure. The trust ownership structure has prevented a buyout of the newspaper by larger media owners.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Adam Augustyn."
