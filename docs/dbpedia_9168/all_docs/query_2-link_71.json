        "text": "The Guardian US announced today that author and professor Moustafa Bayoumi will join the newsroom as a regular columnist. Bayoumi’s columns will touch upon race, immigration and foreign policy – topics he’s written on over the years for the Guardian, as well as for The New York Times, New York Magazine, CNN and others.\n\nBayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror. He is professor of english at Brooklyn College, City University of New York.\n\nUS editor Betsy Reed said: “Moustafa is an indispensable voice in American media, offering a perspective that is dramatically underrepresented in many newsrooms. The Guardian has been fortunate to publish Moustafa’s nuanced, incisive writing over the years, so I’m thrilled to announce that he’s coming on board as a regular columnist.”\n\nUS opinion editor Amana Fontanella-Khan said: “​​Moustafa Bayoumi has a long track record of writing powerful opinion pieces from a clear-eyed moral and political perspective. I’m so glad that he will be joining us as a columnist.”\n\nGuardian Media Group (GMG), is the publisher of theguardian.com, one of the largest English-speaking news websites in the world. Since launching its US and Australian digital editions in 2011 and 2013, respectively, traffic from outside the UK now represents around two-thirds of the Guardian’s total digital audience.\n\nGuardian US has more than 100 members of editorial staff across bureaus in New York, Washington DC and Los Angeles. In 2022, the Guardian US averaged 41 million unique visitors per month and now has more than 250,000 recurring supporters in the US. The Guardian US is renowned for its Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into widespread secret surveillance by the National Security Agency and for other award-winning work, including the Paradise Papers. Today, the Guardian US is known for its urgent coverage of the climate crisis, politics, race and immigration, guns, gender, the arts and more."
