        "text": "Process Sensors Corporation (PSC), a KPM Analytics company, has announced the release of the new Guardian-HD Web Profiling System for the on-line measurement of moisture, coatings and adhesives in difficult paper and converting applications. The Guardian-HD System features a more robust design and enclosed frame construction for measurements of wider width webs in harsh environments.\n\nPSC’s Guardian Web Profiling Systems use Near Infrared (NIR) technology to measure moisture and coat weight of films, paper and foils. A Guardian System rapidly identifies product parameters trending out of specification to improve product consistency and reduce scrap. With a Guardian System, time consuming laboratory testing is replaced by real-time measurements resulting in reduced start-up times and significant cost savings.\n\nThe new Guardian-HD Web Profiling System features a more powerful linear actuator in an enclosed frame to provide reliable operation in hot, dusty or humid environments. The rugged system is now available in widths up to 20’ (6m) for precise control of wide webs. With remote electronics, the system is more easily accessible in walled-off or enclosed installations.\n\nAll Guardian-HD systems include an industrial scanning frame, an NIR smart sensor and local easy to read touchscreen display for cross direction web profiling and lane and machine direction measurements. The new systems are available in two models:\n\nThe Guardian-HD Elite Web Profiling System features a 19” Windows-based PC with ViewerSuite software. The ViewerSuite software can monitor and control 100 zones across multiple webs with a single sensor and store up to 100 product measurement profiles. The Guardian Elite offers advanced display options, comprehensive roll reporting and data archiving. This allows production lots to be associated with modifications to line operations for full traceability and audits.\n\nThe Guardian Essential-HD Web Profiling System includes a 12” touchscreen for the display of basic profile information and control. The system can monitor up to 50 zones with a single sensor. The Essential Web Profiling System display includes cross direction web profile, lane and machine direction measurements.\n\nThe new Guardian-HD Web Profiling System is manufactured at Process Sensors’ global headquarters in Milford, MA USA, and is supported by more than 40 trained distributors around the world."
