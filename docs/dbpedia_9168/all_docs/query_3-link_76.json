        "text": "Topline\n\nElon Musk on Thursday boosted a fake news headline first shared by the leader of a far-right fringe group in the United Kingdom about “detainment camps” for arrested British rioters to his 193 million followers on X—before deleting it—as he continues to criticize U.K. leaders over their crackdown on far-right groups as violent race riots grip the country.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

The girls, aged 6 to 9, were killed in a knife attack. The same day, police arrested a 17-year-old from a village nearby. Before the suspect's identity was confirmed, social media posts began falsely claiming he was a Muslim asylum seeker. Following a vigil for the victims, protestors threw bricks and bottles at a local mosque and a police van was set on fire. Members of the far-right have since gathered for large-scale riots across the country, shouting anti-immigration and Islamophobic messages. Counter-protests have also broken out, leading to clashes between the two groups. Hundreds of people have been arrested. In addition to charging those involved with the violence, Parkinson recently said that those who share material that is \"intended to or likely to start racial hatred\" on social media could also face charges.\n\nTangent\n\nThe spread of misinformation on X has been a topic of discussion since Musk—who describes himself as a \"free speech absolutist\"—first took over. When he bought the platform, he said he was looking to create a space where “a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner.” But that seeming lack of oversight has led to a website where false claims run rampant. Last year, the European Union said X had the largest prevalence of fake news and disinformation among any social media platform. Fake news posts or those sharing blatantly false information are common on X, the EU said, and those posts are quickly able to find an audience and spread faster than they do on other platforms. X is under investigation by the EU for its handling of violent content and disinformation about the war between Israel and Hamas. In addition to allowing fake information shared by everyday users to spread, Musk uses his wide-reaching account to share his conservative views on domestic and international news. A study released in July showed that X has become more popular with conservatives since Musk took over and the billionaire has created space for right-leaning politicians and leaders to reach larger audiences.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nMusk is the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $218.7 billion as of Thursday. He has co-founded several companies, including electric car maker Tesla and rocket producer SpaceX, and has owned the social media platform since 2022.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nthe GuardianElon Musk shares fake news about England rioters being sent to Falklands POLITICOElon Musk shares fake news claiming UK rioters will be sent to 'detainment camps'BbcWhy are there riots in the UK and where are they taking place?ForbesX Is The Biggest Source Of Fake News And Disinformation, EU WarnsForbesElon Musk Isn't Stopping Misinformation, He's Helped Spread It"
