        "text": "What is a Guardianship of an Adult?\n\nA guardianship of an adult is a court process where a North Dakota state district court judge or judicial referee decides that an adult (18 years or older) is incapacitated to the point they’re unable to care for themselves responsibly or their incapacity endangers their health or safety.\n\nIf the judge or judicial referee decides, based on the evidence presented, that the adult is incapacitated, a guardian is appointed to make medical, legal, residential, educational, vocational, and some financial decisions for the adult. After a guardian is appointed, the adult is referred to as the Ward.\n\nThere are three types of guardianships of adults:\n\nEmergency guardianship, which can last no more than 90 days. An emergency guardianship can be either full or limited.\n\nFull guardianship, which lasts until the guardianship is no longer necessary. Full guardianship gives the guardian authority to make all personal decisions for the Ward.\n\nLimited guardianship, which lasts until the guardianship is no longer necessary. Limited guardianship allows the Ward to make the personal decisions they remain able to make, so the guardian only has authority to make personal decisions in areas the Ward is unable.\n\nLess Restrictive Options to Guardianship of an Adult\n\nThe appointment of a guardian severely limits or completely removes the right of an adult or make their own personal decisions. Before petitioning for guardianship, consider other, less restrictive options.\n\nLess restrictive options to guardianship of an adult include, but aren’t limited to, the following:\n\nNorth Dakota Protection and Advocacy Project\n\nSupported Decision Making, an Alternative to Guardianship\n\nNorth Dakota Department of Human Services, Adults and Aging Services Division\n\nAging & Disability Resource Link\n\nPower of Attorney\n\nHealth Care Directive\n\nRepresentative Payee\n\nNorth Dakota Guardian Establishment Program **Apply BEFORE Petitioning for a Guardianship\n\nThe North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services operates the Guardianship Establishment Program. This is a state-funded program that can provide financial assistance to people who are petitioning for guardianship of an incapacitated adult. You MUST complete the application BEFORE petitioning the Court for guardianship.\n\nAdult & Aging Services Program\n\nThe application for this program is found here. You may contact the Adult & Aging Services Guardianship Establishment Program at (701) 328-4613 and carechoice@nd.gov. (See Guardianship Establishment Funds Protocol.)\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities Program\n\nThe application for this program is found here. You may contact the Developmental Disabilities Guardianship Establishment Program at (701) 328-8930 or dhsddreq@nd.gov. (See DD Guardianship Establishment Funds Protocol.)\n\nThe application MUST be submitted to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services. The address is located on the last page of the application. DON’T file the application with a North Dakota state district court. The court can’t take your application.\n\nNorth Dakota Court System Informational Videos\n\nVideos are available on topics such as Adult Guardianship Training, Mental Health Decision Making, Alternatives to Guardianship, and New Guardian Duties.\n\nGo to guardianship.ndcourts.gov to watch the videos.\n\nSome of the trainings require you to create a login and password so you’ll receive a participation certificate.\n\nGuardian Responsibilities, Qualifications and Training Requirements, and Payment Information\n\nLearn how to identify when a guardianship is necessary, the qualification and training requirements for a guardian of an adult, the responsibilities of a guardian, and when a guardian may be paid for their services.\n\nND Guardianship Training Course\n\nGuardian Qualifications & Training Rule and Declaration Forms (Previously Affidavit Forms)\n\nGuidelines for New Guardians Packet\n\nPayment for Guardianship Services Information\n\nRequests Related to Attending Guardianship Hearings\n\nBefore a North Dakota state district court can appoint a guardian, at least one court hearings is required. After a guardian is appointed, more court hearings may be necessary, depending on the requirements of each individual guardianship.\n\nGenerally, the guardian, or guardians, and the adult subject to the guardianship are all required to attend guardianship hearings in person at the courthouse.\n\nHowever, the guardian, or the person requesting to become the guardian, may use the following form sets to ask to have the hearing held by reliable electronic means instead of in person, to have any of the parties attend the in person hearing remotely, to hold the hearing somewhere other than the courthouse, or to allow the adult subject to the guardianship not to attend the hearing at all.\n\nRequest to Hold the Hearing by Reliable Electronic Means or to Attend the Hearing\n\nRequest to Hold the Hearing at an Alternate Location (i.e. Nursing Home) or to Allow Non-Attendance at the Hearing\n\nEmergency Adult Guardianship\n\nA North Dakota state district court may appoint an emergency guardian of an adult if the court finds that using the non-emergency guardianship appointment process is likely to result in substantial harm to the adult’s health, safety, or welfare, and that no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in the circumstances. Emergency guardianships can last no more than 90 days.\n\nIf the emergency relates to mental illness or substance abuse issues, you may wish to review the information on the Mental Health Commitment process. Please note that a state’s attorney or a private attorney must approve the mental health commitment petition before the petition can be filed with the court.\n\nEmergency Adult Guardianship (Appointment of emergency guardian AFTER required court hearing)\n\nInstructions for Emergency Guardianship\n\nPetition for Appointment of Emergency Guardian\n\nConfidential Information Form\n\nOrder for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem\n\nNotice of Emergency Guardianship Hearing\n\nOrder for Emergency Guardian\n\nLetters for Emergency Guardian\n\nService Instructions & Forms\n\nEx-Parte Emergency Adult Guardianship (Appointment of emergency guardian BEFORE required court hearing)\n\nInstructions for Ex-Parte Emergency Guardianship\n\nPetition for Ex-Parte Appointment of Emergency Guardian\n\nConfidential Information Form\n\nOrder for Ex-Parte Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem\n\nOrder for Ex-Parte Emergency Guardian Pending Hearing\n\nLetters for Ex-Parte Emergency Guardian Pending Hearing\n\nNotice of Hearing on Ex-Parte Appointment of Emergency Guardian\n\nService Instructions & Forms\n\nEstablishing Adult Guardianship\n\nAny person interested in the welfare of an allegedly incapacitated adult may petition for the appointment of a guardian.
