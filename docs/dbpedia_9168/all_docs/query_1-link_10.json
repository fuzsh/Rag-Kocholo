Instead of replacing the door or frame, Guardian’s Field Labeling Evaluation Service offers a much more cost-effective solution.\n\nOur Field Labeling Evaluation Service, offered by our test lab, includes an on-site analysis and evaluation of the materials, design, and construction of the door, door frame, and protective plate where required. Field Labeling Technicians, trained in the test lab, conduct the analysis and evaluation with their knowledge of the IBC’s accepted door assembly codes and the door assembly test standards."
