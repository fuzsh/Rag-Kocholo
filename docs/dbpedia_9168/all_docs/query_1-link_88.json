        "text": "This print campaign by BBH London celebrates the Guardian’s independence. Unlike almost every other news outlet, the Guardian isn’t owned by shareholders who can influence news stories and push their own agendas. By being completely independent, the Guardian asks the questions others can’t to print the stories others won’t. BBH London used the Guardian’s typeface Guardian Egyptian in an illustrative form to highlight the campaign’s thought provoking copy. Subtle details, such as a registration mark resembling a gun target mark, also loaded lines like “We’ve got enemies in high places” with greater impact. Keeping the design bold, simple and stripped back cleared way for the campaign’s powerful messages to resonate in an unapologetic tone. The campaign launched in the United Kingdom and is due to roll out in Australia and North America.\n\nbartleboglehegarty.com/london"
