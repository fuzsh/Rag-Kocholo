        "text": "Space is no longer free from conflict. Defending space is as vital to our nation's security and prosperity as our protection from the air, land, and sea. In 2019 our newest military branch was officially formed.\n\nThey have been given the mission to guard our nation from threats, both on Earth and in orbit. Here’s to The Space Force Guardians!\n\nThis Guardian Bourbon represents the United States Space Force in its deep dark blue label and wax. Aged for three years, the Guardian Bourbon is as relaxing and smooth as a satellite drifting across a clear summer night sky. Unlike a majority of bourbons, our mash build is 99% corn and proofed with fresh Colorado Rocky Mountain reservoir water providing a smooth, almost sweet, well-tempered whiskey. Neat, over a rock, or with your favorite mixer, this bourbon’s taste is just like our newest armed forces’ motto, “Semper Supra” – “Always Above”."
