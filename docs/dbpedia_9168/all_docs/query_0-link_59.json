        "text": "72-5-325. Petition for removal or resignation of guardian -- termination of incapacity -- appointment of successor guardian. (1) On petition of the ward or any person interested in the ward's welfare, the court, after hearing, may remove a guardian if in the best interests of the ward. On petition of the guardian, the court, after hearing, may accept a resignation.\n\n(2) An order adjudicating incapacity may specify a minimum period, not exceeding 6 months, during which a petition for an adjudication that the ward is no longer incapacitated may not be filed without special leave. Subject to that restriction, the ward or any person interested in the welfare of the ward may petition for an order that the ward is no longer incapacitated and for termination of the guardianship. A request for an order may also be made informally to the court, and any person who knowingly interferes with transmission of the request may be adjudged guilty of contempt of court.\n\n(3) Upon removal, resignation, or death of the guardian or if the guardian is determined to be incapacitated, the court may appoint a successor guardian and make any other appropriate order. Before appointing a successor guardian or ordering that a ward's incapacity has terminated, the court shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the ward that apply to a petition for appointment of a guardian."
