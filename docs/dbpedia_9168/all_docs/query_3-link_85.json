        "text": "Foreign cybercrime unit still blackmailing Ginther\n\nCybercriminals continued to blackmail the city of Columbus over a data breach of city computer files that occurred last month, threatening to publicly release a huge trove of stolen information unless someone purchased it on the dark web for roughly $1.7 million by Wednesday morning, a Columbus IT expert said.\n\nBut the hacking group Rhysida later backed off on its threat, allowing more time for a bidder to step forward, said Daniel Maldet, with the Columbus office of CMIT Solutions, an IT consultant not directly working on the case.\n\n\"It did show when I looked this morning that it had not sold,\" Maldet told The Dispatch, adding that it looked like they were prepared to release the data, which the group claims is 6.5 terabytes. They restarted the auction because no one bid, apparently. The group has data from hundreds of other groups on its site that hadn't sold and were simply made public to users on the dark web, \"and it looked like that was what they were doing with the data from the city,\" he said.\n\n\"And then sometime after that it was back up on auction.\"\n\nNo one from Mayor Andrew J. Ginther's office returned emails seeking an update on the city's computer woes Wednesday afternoon, but officials have already made clear that certain city data was compromised. The city has cited an ongoing federal and local criminal investigation for keeping a lid on the totality of the problems, including what systems and data were breached.\n\nThe city told police officers in late July that it believed city \"data has been accessed\" by a \"foreign cyberattack,\" according to a memo from an assistant police chief.\n\nTechnology issues linger for Columbus government\n\nAnd signs continued to linger that the problems persist: Jennifer Fening, Ginther's deputy chief of staff for communications, return email noted the city \"is also experiencing limited email connectivity. As such, I may not see your email in a timely fashion.\" The city also had to share a police body camera video via burned disc instead through an online portal because of \"technology limitations.\"\n\nBrian Steel, who heads the Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, the union for city officers, said the number of officers who are experiencing issues with identity theft on bank and credit card accounts continues to multiply, \"same type of stuff, including retirees,\" Steel said.\n\n\"Once folks signed up for the credit monitoring, it's just dinging constantly - including mine.\"\n\nSeveral dozen officers and retirees have contacted the union office. \"Every day there's more,\" Steel said. \"...I just heard there's a ransom. We're directing all of our members to an attorney just in case they want to take action.\"\n\nSteel said he didn't see any problem with paying a ransom, as the city is constantly cutting checks to \"ambulance chasers\" anyway.\n\nPaying ransom might not solve problem\n\nBut there's no guarantee that paying a ransom - even if such a payment were deemed legal using city tax dollars - would make the city's problems go away, Maldet said.\n\n\"They're saying on their site that they have city credentials, user name and passwords of employees,\" Maldet said. \"They have video camera footage. And they say they've downloaded two full servers. ... But there is no way to see what's there, because they're preventing anyone from seeing it.\"\n\n\"Some of it is probably not valuable. You make the assumption that people are changing their passwords, or tuning on multi-factor authentication, as they should.\" And while it's not been verified that the problems facing police officers is related, it seems ironic that it happened at the same time as the attack, Maldet said.\n\nThe current request from the hackers is 30 Bitcoins. Bitcoins were trading at $55,275 Wednesday afternoon, meaning the ransom was around $1.66 million.\n\nThe British newspaper The Guardian reported last year that Rhysida had claimed responsibility for a large-scale attack on the British Library, which stole personal data that was put up for sale online. The group used \"double extortion,” demanding ransom and simultaneously threatening to release it for free online, \"which they hope will strengthen their negotiating hand,\" the newspaper said.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which is part of Department of Homeland Security, issued a cybersecurity advisory last November warning about \"Rhysida — an emerging ransomware variant — (that) has predominately been deployed against the education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors since May 2023.\"\n\nCISA issued a string of mitigations to protect against the threat, which were somewhat technical and dealing with coding and software restrictions. It is yet unclear whether the Ginther administration enacted any of these precautions, due to its general decision to not disclose details of the attack.\n\nBut certain city departments were still warning about disruptions from the attack on their websites on Wednesday.\n\n\"Please Note: We are currently experiencing technical difficulties and are only accepting CASH payments for impound releases,\" Parking Services' website still said on Wednesday afternoon. \" Ticket and permit payments may be made online but not processed at our facility. Sorry for the inconvenience.\"\n\nwbush@gannett.com\n\n@ReporterBush"
