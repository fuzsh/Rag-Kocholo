Our investigations have exposed governmental and social failings, including Windrush revelations in the UK, Covid-19, Cambridge Analytica, the Snowden Files, the Panama, Paradise and Pandora Papers, and the Pegasus Project. We are passionate about the climate emergency, social justice, fairness and progress. We remain dedicated to truth and to bringing about a more hopeful future."
