        "text": "Attention Valued Customers:\n\nYour Guardian Pharmacy of Maine prescription labels are going to look slightly different starting April 1, 2019. We have been working with our development team at Softwriters and they have finished our new label design. The changes that we made include removing the “Earliest Refill Date xx/xx/xxxx” and changing the number of refills to “QTY REMAINING.” Please see the example below and feel free to contact our account manager, Whitney Beal at 207-373-9077 with any questions. Thank you!\n\nPlease be aware the following changes will appear on your Guardian Pharmacy Prescription Labels:\n\nRemoved: Earliest Refill Date\n\nChanged: Refills Remaining to QTY Remaining\n\nExample:"
