        "text": "Traditional newspaper journalism was headed towards extinction. From its ashes had risen a digital-first news-gathering service — one which encouraged contributions, challenges and points of view from everyone, everywhere. The Guardian called it Open Journalism. We called it The Whole Picture, a strapline resurrected from their classic 1986 Points of View ad.\n\nIn the ad Three Little Pigs, we retold the classic children’s fairytale by imagining how the modern media would cover it. Playing out like a docudrama, the 2-minute film begins with SWAT police storming the porkers' house. News of the arrests spreads. Opinion frenzy swells. Investigative journalists seek out the truth, culminating in mass protests for reform –– all covered, of course, by The Guardian.\n\nThe campaign also played out across print, in a series of minimalist posters that showed how many people contribute to a single news story.\n\nAll in all, the campaign was seen in over 200 countries, even making headlines down under. That same year, The Guardian was named the number 1 quality news brand in the UK for the first time."
