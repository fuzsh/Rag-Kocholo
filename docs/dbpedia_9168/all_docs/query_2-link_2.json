A Lean Left bias is a moderately liberal rating on the political spectrum.\n\nLearn more about Lean Left ratings\n\nDetails\n\nIn 2004, a features editor asserted that \"it is no secret we are a centre-left newspaper.\"\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe Guardian Rated Lean Left in July 2021 AllSides Blind Bias Survey\n\nIn the July 2021 AllSides Blind Bias Survey, in which people across the political spectrum rated content from The Guardian's news section without knowing the source, the average rating was Lean Left.\n\nA total of 1,331 people rated The Guardian.

If we perform more bias reviews and gather consistent data, this confidence level will increase.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAbout The Guardian\n\nThe Guardian is a British national daily newspaper founded in reaction to the closure of a radical workers’ newspaper in 1821. The paper publishes content on its UK online edition, as well as its two international web sites, Guardian Australia and Guardian US. The newspaper’s print edition has an average daily circulation of 189,000 copies, behind the Daily Telegraph and The Times, and ahead of The Independent. Its online edition was the fifth most widely read in the world as of October 2014, with over 42.6 million readers.\n\nHistory of The Guardian: Founded As Left-Wing Newspaper\n\nThe Guardian was founded in 1821 to promote liberal interests during a turbulent time characterized by massive worker movements and growing anti-Corn Laws campaigns. It maintained its role as the voice of the left despite facing several financial hurdles over the years. By the 1970s and 1980s, a period of polarized politics in Great Britain, The Guardian’s opinion pages helped spawn the center-left SDP party. Meanwhile, its letters page was where the battle for the future direction of the Labour Party played out.\n\nWhen The Independent was launched in 1986, it solidified its position as a centrist British newspaper alongside The Guardian on the left and the Times and Telegraph on the right. A large majority of current readers vote for either the Labour or Liberal Democratic Parties, while the paper has traditionally endorsed one of those two parties during general elections.\n\nPolitical Leaning of The Guardian's Audience\n\nAccording to the 2014 Pew Research Study, Where News Audiences Fit on the Political Spectrum, the majority (72%) of The Guardian’s readers hold political values to the political left or left-of-center. 9% of The Guardian's audience is right or right-of-center (compared with 26% of all respondents to the survey). Roughly 20% of The Guardian's audience is considered mixed or center (compared with 36% of all respondents to the survey).\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe Guardian Ownership and Funding\n\nFunding and ownership do not influence bias ratings. We rate the bias of content only.\n\nOwner: Guardian Media Group\n\nThe Guardian is owned by the Guardian Media Group, which owns another British newspaper, The Observer. The Guardian Media Group is wholly owned by Scott Trust Limited. The current chair of the Scott Trust Board is Alex Graham."
