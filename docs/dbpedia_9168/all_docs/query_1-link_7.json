Those who pick grapes are often in the shadows, are subjected to hazardous working conditions, and do not have job security or opportunities for advancement in the wine industry. The Guardian Vital label will be adopted by wineries for special cuvées. A percentage of sales from the cuvée will benefit Líderes Campesinas, an organization whose mission is to strengthen the leadership of farmworker women and youth so that they can be agents of economic, social, and political change and ensure their human rights. The participating wineries must guarantee that workers whose labor goes into making their wines have safe workspaces, are paid fairly, and are treated with dignity, respect, and potential.\n\nDrawing and Design Collaboration by Oscar Lopez Guerrero (Art drawing), Uriel Contreras (Logo), Emilio Huerta (Set up), Irene De Barraicua (Concept) as well as feedback from Líderes Campesinas and The Vinguard’s staff and board."
