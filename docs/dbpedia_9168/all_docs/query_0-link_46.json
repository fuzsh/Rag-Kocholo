        "text": "The Guardian celebrates its 200th birthday in May 2021 with a digital festival of live events and masterclasses, journalism spanning digital and print formats, and a new brand campaign under the banner “200 years a work in progress” to inspire readers to support its ongoing investment into world-class journalism, say the publishers.\n\nThe first edition of the Manchester Guardian, as it was then known, was published on 5 May 1821. To mark the moment, from Wednesday 5 May, the Guardian will publish a range of journalism in digital, print, video and audio formats, examining the paper’s origins, its highs and lows, and how its exclusives and investigations changed the world.\n\nKatharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News & Media, said: “Since the first edition of the Manchester Guardian was published in 1821, the Guardian’s mission has been to seek out truth and use clarity and imagination to build hope. 200 years is a long time for any organisation to last, but thanks to the support and trust of Guardian readers we now have greater impact and are read around the world like never before.\n\n“We are looking forward to celebrating this moment with Guardian readers and supporters - bringing them special journalism and events which look back at our history, and forward to the future.\"\n\nAnnette Thomas, chief executive, Guardian Media Group, said: “Two hundred years since its foundation, the Guardian continues to thrive and grow our reach and impact. Our business is in a strong position and our unique reader relationship model has proved successful, with a record increase in reader support in 2020.\n\n“A big thank you to our readers, commercial clients and partners for their belief in the Guardian and our brand over so many years.”\n\nDigital festival of live events\n\nThe Guardian will be running a digital festival of live events to celebrate its 200th birthday. Highlights include:\n\nThe Guardian at 200: Made in Manchester (11 May), a free event exploring the Guardian’s Manchester roots with Guardian columnist John Harris and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner in conversation with some of the city’s most influential voices including Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham; great-granddaughter of suffragette Emmeline and granddaughter of Sylvia, Helen Pankhurst; CEO of Manchester Pride, Mark Fletcher; lead singer of The Charlatans, Tim Burgess.\n\nA series of Guardian Live events in June featuring politics, environment, the arts, activism, food, and more.

Campaign activity will celebrate the evolution of the Guardian’s iconic typography and its longstanding challenger voice.\n\nThe campaign will come to life through 230 innovative outdoor placements across London and Manchester, including a banner at Manchester Piccadilly, which will be treated with a pollution absorbing coating Pureti, and a series of special-build ‘work in progress’ billboards.\n\nThe Guardian will also be collaborating with leading podcasts, using traditional ad space to explore the concept of progress as it relates to key news topics. Host reads will appear on podcasts including Reasons to be cheerful, Kermode on Film, Adam Buxton, Scummy Mummies and Intelligence Squared.\n\nThe campaign will run across the Guardian’s digital platforms and apps, including an animated masthead on the homepage. Additional paid activity is planned across the Guardian’s social media channels, including ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe integrated campaign was created through a collaboration between the Guardian and OLIVER agency and features three films created in collaboration Independent Films which explore the idea of progress as it relates to the environment, equality and humanity at large. Voiceovers featured include the late Ursula K Le Guin, former Observer journalist, Alan Ross, and poet and author, Salena Godden, featuring the song ‘Immunity’ written and performed by Jon Hopkins.\n\nThe Guardian saw its biggest year for digital reader revenues in 2020, gaining 268,000 new digital subscriptions and recurring contributions, an increase of 43%. The organisation also received more than 530,000 single contributions from readers who believe in the Guardian’s values and purpose. Including print subscribers and single contributions, people supported the Guardian financially more than 1.5m times last year, says the Guardian."
