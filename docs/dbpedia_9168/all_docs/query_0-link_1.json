        "text": "Introduction The Guardian website is made up of a series of fronts and articles.\n\nIntroduction Containers are composed of modular story cards. These are designed to be flexible; they expand and contract depending on the number of stories added to them.\n\nIntroduction We have a variety of different card sizes which create hierarchy and pace on the page, and allow the reader to quickly gauge a story’s importance.\n\nIntroduction This is a selection of the card types. Each card type is designed to impart the tone of the story.\n\nIntroduction Below is a selection of the article types. Articles follow the design language of the cards, with each having its own distinct flavour and tone.\n\nGrids & spacing The grid provides the substrate and unifies how we arrange information on all of our digital platforms.\n\nGrids & spacing Spacing is intentionally used to echo the placement of the typography in print.\n\nBrand use The logo and the roundel are always aligned either top right or bottom right.\n\nBrand use The roundel acts as a simplified expression of the brand — often used to indicate Guardian content on- and off-platform. For more, visit The Guardian Brand hub\n\nTypography Guardian Headline is designed to provide an optimal reading experience across all platforms. It is used on the website and app for headlines, providing their unique character and voice.\n\nTypography Guardian Titlepiece was drawn from the Guardian’s logotype and is used for section titling and signposting. High contrast, bold and striking — use cautiously and appropriately!\n\nColour palette We use colour also as a navigational aid for our readers, therefore consistency is crucial.\n\nGraphic elements We have two styles of button. Consider weighting when choosing a style: the lozenge is bolder, the circular button is more subtle. Icons help the reader navigate and sit centrally inside an imaginary circle at the edge of the button.\n\nGraphic elements We use highlighting for impact and to create hierarchy and emphasis within designs."
