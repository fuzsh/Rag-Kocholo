        "text": "Guardian US sales and marketing leader Luis Romero is departing the publisher on Wednesday, Campaign US has learned.\n\nSteve Sachs, U.S. managing director of Guardian News and Media, informed staff of the news in a note sent Thursday, May 2.\n\nSachs said the media company will conduct a search to fill Romero’s position.\n\nIn the interim, Lora Logan, VP of sales, East Coast and Midwest, and Kym Nelson, head of West Coast advertising, will jointly lead the advertising team, reporting to Sachs.\n\nHe wished Romero the “best of luck” in his new endeavor; it’s not yet known where he’s headed next.\n\nRomero joined the U.S. arm of the British newspaper in March 2022 from digital media company Group Nine Media — owner of Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, Seeker and PopSugar — which was acquired by Vox Media in February 2022.\n\nThe sales leader spent most of his career in broadcast sales at NBCUniversal and Univision.\n\nAt the Guardian US, he navigated a turbulent two years for publishing, with advertising sales impacted by increasingly strict brand safety controls and the growing dominance of digital media channels like social media and connected TV.\n\nThe publishing industry’s ad revenues are forecast to decline 4.2% in 2024, according to Magna’s latest forecast, while digital companies, including social-media platforms, streamers and online retailers, are expected to boost sales by 12%.\n\nLogan recently told Campaign US that The Guardian has witnessed a decline in revenue as a result of advertisers blocking impressions due to brand safety concerns.\n\nNews publishers call out stringent brand safety policies at IAB NewFronts\n\nIn the note to employees, Sachs said that under Romero’s leadership, ad revenue increased 42% in fiscal Q1 2023 versus the prior year. He said the ad sales team “competitively navigated a very difficult Q3 and Q4 2023.”\n\nPart of Romero’s recent strategy to revive ad sales has been to pursue political dollars in the upcoming U.S. election. He recently told Digiday the Guardian US is actively pitching to political candidates and advocacy groups for the first time.\n\nAccording to its latest financials, revenue at parent company Guardian Media Group increased by 3.4% to £264.4 million ($331 million) for the year ended April 2, 2023. International revenues grew 17% to £93.2 million ($116.7 million), accounting for 35% of total revenue.\n\nU.K.-headquartered Guardian News & Media first launched a U.S. site called Guardian America in 2007. This was axed in 2009 as the publisher said it would instead focus on building its social media presence. It relaunched its U.S. website in 2011 under the leadership of then editor-in-chief Janine Gibson.\n\nBetsy Reed is the current editor of Guardian US."
