        "text": "If the problem is transparency and trust, is the solution better labelling? That was one of the questions a panel on native advertising wrestled with at the Changing Media Summit last week.\n\nAccording to Anna Watkins, head of Guardian Labs, native advertising is a “dirty phrase” at the Guardian. Why? Because “at its best it is branded content that adds value and a really positive experience for readers. At its worst it is commercial content, and poor-quality commercial content, dressed up and therefore hoodwinking readers into thinking it’s commercially independent.”\n\nA lack of transparency, deliberate or otherwise, is exacerbated online where native content is often seen in-stream or discovered via a search engine where the name of the trusted publisher might be immediately apparent – think Forbes – but the source contributor is not.\n\nSo what is the solution? Last week Meredith Levien, the head of advertising at the New York Times urged publishers to “label the hell” out of branded content and it was a call echoed at the Changing Media Summit.\n\n“We shouldn’t make it hard for the user to work out what’s paid and what’s not. It’s often not easy to join the dots and we need to help the user to do that,” Stephanie Himoff, Outbrain’s managing director for UK and Ireland, told the conference.\n\nOutbrain is a content discovery platform that places contextual, paid-for content at the bottom of articles on publisher sites. Last summer, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint that Outbrain’s use of the heading “You may also like these” meant the content it was serving was not “obviously identifiable” as advertising. Outbrain has since altered its labelling. “We were part of the process,” noted Himoff.\n\nAsked if she thought some people had been misled by native advertising labels in the past, Himoff said: “Probably. But if you look at what has happened in the last 18 months, a lot has changed.” Among those changes, the Internet Advertising Bureau has introduced its first native advertising guidelines.\n\nFor its part, the Guardian now uses two key labels to identify advertiser involvement. “Sponsored by” refers to sponsorship of either existing editorial projects or new editorial projects where a brand has a role – although no final say – in suggesting what kind of topics are covered. Once the idea has been signed off there is no further brand involvement, and the editor-in-chief of the Guardian has ultimate sign off (and power of veto) on any sponsorship deal.\n\nMeanwhile, the “Brought to you by” label is a nod to an advertisement feature. Here the content, which is paid for and controlled by the advertiser, is produced by commercial departments and does not involve GNM staff journalists. It is subject to regulation by the Advertising Standards Authority.\n\nTiffanie Darke, creative content director at News UK, said the publisher of the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun, took a comparable approach. “We do have similar labels but the wording isn’t exactly the same and I think this is where the confusion arises. You go from one platform to another platform and ‘brought to you by’ can mean ‘sponsored by’ on another platform. So it behoves publishers an enormous responsibility to make sure that everybody is very clear what the arrangement is.”\n\nIs the answer, therefore, a universally applied set of labels agreed by publishers and understood by the consumer? “Yes, it would be in the readers’ interest,” said Darke.\n\nNick Baughan, chief executive of communications agency Maxus UK, was less apologetic about native advertising, suggesting that readers had a sophisticated filter when it came to paid-for content. “Yes it would be useful to have a universal vernacular [around labels] but we do the readers a disservice if we think they can’t spot that a ‘brought to you’ or a ‘sponsored by’ is not going to be totally independent.” Baughan said energy would be better spent attacking public relations “subterfuge” rather than going after native advertising.\n\nWhen it was suggested that the younger generation cared less about the division between church and state – in other words, the separation between the editorial and advertising departments – most panelists insisted that it mattered all the same. Darke said that if young people really did take that view they would “soon notice that some of the most important precepts and pillars of journalism would be destroyed”.\n\nBaughan, however, suggested that digitally native publications have a less marked division with which everybody is comfortable. “When you are dealing with heritage sites like the Guardian you are running into more difficult areas,” he added.\n\nJon Bernstein is an independent digital media consultant and writer, formerly deputy editor then digital director of New Statesman and multimedia editor at Channel 4 News.
