        "text": "GURNEE, IL—KDV Label has been using PC Industries’ Guardian OLP system, designed for prepress proofing and pressroom quality control, to oversee their label quality on a narrow web flexo printer.\n\nDefects can always happen in the pressroom. Preventive measures are the best way to protect a company from shipping labels with defects and having dissatisfied customers. KDV Label, which provides labeling solutions for markets such as consumer goods, beverage, food, chemical petroleum and more, implemented PC Industries’ OLP Offline Proofing System to counter these issues at the source.\n\nFor Nick Scharber, the prepress manager at KDV Label, “the system itself, ease of use, and access to the developers and support,” prompted them to partner with PC Industries. “After evaluating many inspection systems for our printed label products we chose PC Industries OLP system for our needs based off of the features, cost and personnel. We have been using PC Industries’ OLP inspection system for over a year now and couldn’t be happier with our decision.”\n\nIn preparing for the pressrun, the Guardian OLP is used to verify register and job sign-off. By comparing press samples to the customer-approved master, the system helps guarantee plate quality and print job integrity. As for ease of use, these inspections typically only take a few seconds to perform, and can be set up with only a few clicks, to assure no interruption in the production process.\n\nWhile a couple small issues arose, Nick recalls that these were taken care of within a day, accompanied by a very positive customer support experience, thanks to one of PC Industries’ engineers, Nick Baker. “Any struggles we had have been addressed quickly and we even have made specific requests for modifications within the software that were implemented by PC Industries,” says Nick Scharber.\n\nThe Guardian OLP has become an efficient tool for KDV Label when inspecting their production, ensuring defect free labels to their customers."
