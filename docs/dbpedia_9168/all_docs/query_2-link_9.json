In 2023, we successfully renewed our certification, increasing our overall score and making progress in almost every category.\n\nWe are committed to reaching our goal of eliminating two thirds of our emissions by 2030 and report on this annually.\n\nOur people\n\nWe value and respect all differences in people, seen and unseen, and aspire to an open, supportive and inclusive culture which makes the Guardian a good place to work for everyone. We have a global workforce, with the majority of our staff in the UK and growing operations in Australia and the US."
