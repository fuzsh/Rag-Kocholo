        "text": "One of the central tenets of the Scott Trust is to secure the Guardian in perpetuity as a \"quality national newspaper without party affiliation, remaining faithful to its liberal tradition.\" People often assume the Guardian is linked inextricably to the Labour party, but it has in fact supported all three main political parties during its history.\n\nThe issue of party affiliation came to the fore in 2008 with Labour fury at a major Guardian three-day investigation into the \"new Conservatives\". This concluded with a leader column personally signed off by the editor in chief Alan Rusbridger, claiming that an attempt by ministers to present the Tories as masking \"rightwing instincts\" is not \"wholly true\" and that \"the new Conservatives claim to be progressive at least deserves consideration. Over three days, this paper has tried to offer it.\"\n\nConversely, the Observer was accused by Guardian investigative writer Nick Davies, in his book Flat Earth News, of losing sight of its political independence in the run-up to the Iraq war by becoming too close to the Labour government.\n\nRusbridger says the Guardian's ability to choose which party to support, without a proprietor breathing down its neck, is one of the core strengths of the paper: \"It is much more in the tradition of the paper to say what we believe and critically interrogate politicians rather than blind party loyalty.\n\n\"It would have been extremely strange if the Guardian, through imagined loyalty to the Labour party, had supported many of the things that have happened since 1997. This sometimes drives New Labour into a range of emotions from disappointment to fury but that is just the way it is.\"\n\nThat anger was expressed in a leaked Labour party memo in the wake of our series on the new Conservatives, reported on in the Independent: \"It is those progressives who are flirting with David Cameron who need to listen. If Guardian readers follow yesterday's leader - though they surely have more sense - and we ended up with a Tory goverment, there is no doubt at all that the result, after the rhetoric and gimmicks faded, would be a smaller, less active state, money having been redistributed to the richest and cuts in public services.\"\n\nRusbridger says it is important to test the Conservatives' claims to have changed and \"our conclusion was that in some respects they have. We will continue to reserve judgement as they go along.\n\n\"Of course it is conceivable we would support them and the Guardian has supported the Tories in the past at a time when the paper felt the Labour party of the day was worn out and it would be good for them to have a period regrouping out of office.\n\n\"This ability to have the freedom to choose whom to support is is a core strength of the Guardian. It would be terrible if were to say there were no circumstances in which we would support the Conservative party. That would suggest our mind is closed.\"\n\nNick Davies' book caused a furore with criticisms of all the quality papers. But there was particular disquiet in the Observer, which he accused of having been too close to the Labour party spin doctor Alastair Campbell ahead of the Iraq war.\n\nDavies says Observer readers were \"slowly soaked in disinformation\" and that the political editor at the time became a \"conduit for government announcements.\"\n\nIn a letter published in the Guardian in September 2008, Davies wrote that the editor at the time Roger Alton \"was manipulated directly by Downing Street and indirectly through key reporters by intelligence agencies and Downing Street again. The result was that he published mighty falsehoods because he thought they were true and failed to publish true stories because he thought they were false ... The manipulation of the Observer in the cause of war happened. It needs an explanation.\"\n\nAlton, now the Independent's editor, as well as then political editor Kamal Ahmed, now communications director for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, vehemently deny the charges.\n\nIn a review of the book in the Guardian, Peter Preston, former Guardian editor and a regular contributor to the Observer, accuses Davies' chapter on the Observer as \"being full of cop-out clauses ... and so notably short of attested fact that PA [Press Association] would bin it without a second thought.\n\n\"Davies doesn't agree with the Oberver's leader line on Iraq, and nor do I as a matter of fact. But the mush of hindsight, No 10 briefings that might or might not have mattered and dissident CIA leakers two removes down the line aren't particularly compelling.\n\n\"This isn't the reporter as unbiased crusader, meticulously assembling his case. It's up close and personal.\"\n\nRusbridger says that on the issue of the Iraq war, it was a sign of strength that the Guardian opposed the war and the Observer supported it: \"It showed that we are independent of anyone else and could arrive at our own decisions. I hope that will happen again, that the Observer and the Guardian will have different ideas of what progressive politics is. This results in a website that is much richer, with a broader range of voices and sensibilities.\""
