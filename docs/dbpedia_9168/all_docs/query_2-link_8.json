        "text": "The Guardian is the leading British paper on the left of the political spectrum. In 2013 it attracted international attention by exposing the spying practices of Western secret services. Although this triggered accusations of treason from other British media and the government, the paper received numerous awards, including the 2014 Pulitzer Prize. The Guardian's pro-European website is considered a major success. Access to all content is free but readers are asked for donations."
