Our organisation

The Guardian is owned by Guardian Media Group, which has only one shareholder - the Scott Trust.

The Scott Trust, named after our longest serving editor, CP Scott, exists to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity.

Today more than half of our revenue comes directly from our readers, helping to support Guardian journalism and keep it open for everyone.

In short, the Guardian isn’t owned or controlled by advertisers or billionaires. It’s owned by a Trust, and it runs on trust. Let’s keep building that trust together.

We’re reader funded

The Guardian’s independent, high-impact journalism is powered by its global readership. The Guardian has over 1 million recurring digital supporters from more than 180 countries around the world. It’s thanks to this generosity that we can provide quality, trustworthy reporting that’s open for everyone to read. With no shareholders or billionaire owner, we can investigate and challenge without fear or favour, and amplify stories that need to be told. You can show your support for our work today, in whichever way suits you best.

Journalism

The Guardian is globally renowned for its coverage of politics, the environment, science, social justice, sport and culture. Our journalists deliver agenda-setting investigations, breaking live news, compelling opinion writing and the liveliest features, as well as award-winning podcasts, video documentaries and infographics and visuals.

Our investigations have exposed governmental and social failings, including Windrush revelations in the UK, Covid-19, Cambridge Analytica, the Snowden Files, the Panama, Paradise and Pandora Papers, and the Pegasus Project.

Our teams in the UK, US and Australia produce theguardian.com, Guardian Australia, Guardian US, Guardian Weekly, and the Guardian and Observer newspapers in the UK.
