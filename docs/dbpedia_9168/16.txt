Guardian is Auth0's multifactor authentication solution that provides a simple and secure way to implement Multifactor Authentication. It also supports push notifications, removing the need for one time pass codes for a truly frictionless multifactor experience.

The Guardian app can be downloaded from the App Store or from Google Play.
