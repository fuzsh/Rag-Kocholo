        "text": "Transcript\n\nWho was Edgar Allan Poe? Born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts, Edgar Allan Poe was a short-story writer, poet, critic, and editor best known for his macabre poems and short stories.\n\nAfter his mother’s death, in 1811, he was taken into the home of John Allan, a wealthy merchant in Richmond, Virginia, and was provided with a classical education that led him to the University of Virginia. After only 11 months, gambling debt caused Poe to be pulled from college. He joined the army and was later admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but he purposefully sought expulsion and began to pursue a full-time writing career.\n\nPoe achieved fame through his short stories and poems, including \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" and \"The Raven.\" Many of his pieces focused on dark psychological themes and contained the elements of death, fear, and the supernatural that are associated with his legacy today.\n\nHe also wrote the first modern detective story, in 1841: \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\" The story launched a new genre and featured a fictional detective named C. Auguste Dupin, a character whose influences can be seen in mystery protagonists including Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn late September 1849 Poe left Richmond and was found semiconscious days later in Baltimore, Maryland. He was admitted to a hospital and died on October 7, 1849. Like the mysterious deaths in his works of fiction, the cause of his own death—whether from drinking, heart failure, or other causes—remains unknown."
