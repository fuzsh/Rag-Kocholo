        "text": "Edgar Allan Poe was a great American writer of short stories and poems. His works, from \"The Raven\" to \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" have inspired generations. Devotees of Edgar Allan Poe will find many mesmerizing spots in Edgar Allan Poe's Baltimore.\n\nPoe moved to Baltimore for the first time in 1829 and left shortly thereafter. He returned in 1831 and wrote many poems and short stories in his newly adopted home. He also met his wife, who was also his first cousin, while living in the home of his aunt in what is now the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum.\n\nBaltimore is perhaps most infamous for being the place where Poe died. Poe was found in a state of delirium and taken to Church Hospital, where he passed away. Prior to this, the last place he was seen was Al and Ann's, which is now The Horse You Came In On Saloon. The saloon has a marking showing the stool Poe sat upon before his untimely death.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe's Grave Site and Memorial at Westminster Hall is a place of pilgrimage for his fans. They can also visit the grave of Poe's wife, Virginia, who passed away at age 24, 11 years after the two were wed.\n\nTake this self-guided walking tour to pay homage to the life and death of Edgar Allan Poe."
