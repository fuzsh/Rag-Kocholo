        "text": "RICHMOND, VA (WWBT) - Sunday marks the 169th anniversary of the death of Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nPoe’s death on Oct. 7, 1849 is mysterious. The circumstances and cause of death are still disputed to this day. Just 10 days before he died, Poe left Richmond on his way to New York City. But on Oct. 3, he was found delirious in Baltimore. Reports say Poe was never coherent enough to explain what happened. He died at the hospital just four days later.\n\nHis death certificate listed phrenitis, or swelling of the brain, as his cause of death – but that has created much debate.\n\nWhile the exact cause may remain a mystery, many have developed their own theories as to what happened. The Smithsonian has even gathered the most popular belief’s behind the author’s death.\n\nBeating\n\nAccording to the Smithsonian, one biographer believes he became drunk and was robbed and beaten.\n\nCooping\n\nSome believe Poe was a victim of cooping, which was a voter fraud practiced by 19th century gangs and was common in Baltimore. Voters were often given alcohol after voting during this time. So, some say he was given liquor, forced to vote multiple times and then let go to die.\n\nAlcohol\n\nIt was said that Poe could not handle alcohol, and theorists say he might have drank himself to death.\n\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning\n\nA health researcher thought that Poe might have died due to carbon monoxide poisoning since coal gas was used for indoor lighting. Testing on his hair came back inconclusive.\n\nHeavy metal poisoning\n\nWhile testing for carbon monoxide, they found levels of Mercury. However, they were well below levels consistent with Mercury poisoning.\n\nRabies\n\nDuring a conference, doctors were working to solve and compare cards with patient symptoms. One card had a patient called “E.P., a writer from Richmond,” on it. Doctors say the symptoms are clear and he was suffering from rabies.\n\nBrain Tumor\n\nWhen his remains were exhumed, a worker said there was a mass rolling around in his skull. A forensic pathologist said it could have been a tumor that calcified.\n\nFlu\n\nThis theory suggests Poe had the flu, which later turned into pneumonia.\n\nMurder\n\nAnother theory by John Evangelist Walsh is that Poe was murdered by the brothers of his fiancée, Elmira Shelton. He says the brothers found him in Baltimore, beat him and made him drink whiskey which would make him deathly sick.\n\nCopyright 2018 WWBT. All rights reserved."
