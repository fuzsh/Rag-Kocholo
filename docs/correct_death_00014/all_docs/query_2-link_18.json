        "text": "Washington College Hospital\n\n(Now Church Home and Hospital)\n\nBroadway and Fairmount Ave.\n\nWashington College Hospital\n\nCourtesy: Maryland Historical Society\n\nPoe arrived at Washington College Hospital, about half a mile from where he was found at Ryan's 4th Ward Polls, on October 3, 1849. Though accounts of his actual condition are unclear, we are fairly certain that he was in great pain, possibly delirious, and perhaps even lapsing in and out of consciousness. We also know that he came in wearing a shabby set of clothes  not the same set he had been wearing when he departed for Baltimore days earlier. Poe's cousin Neilson, who lived in Baltimore, tried to visit him during his stay but was turned away because Poe was \"too excitable.\" Edgar Allan Poe was in the hospital for five days, and died on the morning of October 7 between 3:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. The mystery of the cause of Poe's death continues to this day.\n\nThe hospital itself has had an unusual history. Located near what was then the eastern end of town, the hospital opened in 1836. Doctors had a similar vision as that of Johns Hopkins  the hospital was to foster both good medicine and good teaching. But the school had financial troubles and acquired a reputation for using the newly buried remains from local graveyards for anatomy lessons and experiments. It closed in 1851, only two years after Poe died there.\n\nWashington College Hospital (Church Home and Hospital) - Now\n\nAn Episcopalian group decided to reopen the hospital in 1857 as the \"Church Home and Infirmary.\" Its ownership changed several times since then, but it continued to operate as \"Church Hospital\" until it closed in November 1999. The hospital was torn down, leaving only an archway and a statue to mark where it once stood. Townhouses are being built on the site of the former hospital today.\n\nTo learn more about Poe's connection with Washington College (Church) Hospital, visit the Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore's page on Poe's hospital connection."
