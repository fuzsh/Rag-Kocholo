Poe.\n\nFor the Historical Marker on the site:\n\n\"This structure, now the east building of Church Hospital, was erected in 1836, to house the Washington Medical College. Edgar Allan Poe, author, and poet, was brought here, ill and semi-conscious, on October 3, 1849 and died four days later. In 1857, the building was purchased by Church Home and Infirmary, which was renamed Church Home and Hospital in 1943.\"\n\nHospitals, Historical\n\nBy: boothy443"
