        "text": "The director John Waters has been collecting contemporary art for decades, and he’s built a trove full of some pretty idiosyncratic works. Take, for instance, Karin Sander’s Gebrauchsbild (2010). The artist did nothing to the canvas. She’s never been on the same continent as the canvas. She just told her dealer, Friedrich Petzel, to leave it in the backyard of his Hamptons house for a summer. Eventually, the canvas grew some green-black mold, and that’s the work. Petzel was worried the mold would poison him, so he refused to bring it inside his house. Waters bought it immediately.\n\n“(A) it’s beautiful to me. It looks like a Robert Ryman painting. And (b) it can kill you; it can ruin your house. It could disappear. And it’s expensive,” he said, standing in the Baltimore Museum of Art on Wednesday, staring at the decomposing woven fabric that he bought at a fancy gallery for a lot of money.\n\n“It’s got everything I love about contemporary art. I think art for the people is a terrible idea—I like the elitism,” he went on. “It’s a secret language. You have to dress a certain way; you have to learn a language; you have to be able to see. It’s a magic trick. And once you can, every day you walk home, nothing looks the same.”\n\nThe work, along with 371 others, was donated to the institution by the 76-year-old legendary filmmaker, author, performer, artist, and collector in 2020. It’s his hometown museum. Even though he has homes in New York and San Francisco and summers in Provincetown, Waters has never left Baltimore; if he is, as the sobriquet goes, the Pope of Trash, this is his Vatican City. Walking around with him on a weekday in the historic port town was surreal. Waters, immediately recognizable to all with his pencil-thin mustache and mischievous smile, talks in a low baritone, with that rare real Maryland accent that’s slightly Southern despite coming from a Union state. Waters is probably the most iconic Baltimorean the city’s produced since Edgar Allan Poe, and he’s treated there like a deity, even if his films deal in smut and the scatalogical. The hip new hotel where I was staying, Ulysses, has its decor deeply influenced by the John Waters–Charm City aesthetic on display in movies like Cry-Baby and Hairspray.\n\nAnd if this is his Vatican City, that makes the Baltimore Museum of Art something akin to Waters’s Sistine Chapel. It was there, brought by his parents, that he made his first art purchase: a poster of a work by Joan Miró. In 2018 the museum gave him a retrospective, and now there’s another one of sorts. On Sunday, a new show, “Coming Attractions: The John Waters Collection,” opens to the public, giving those who never got an invitation to his Christmas party a chance to see the unmistakably John Waters–esque horde of treasures. Out of the hundreds of works, 90 were selected and curated by the artists Jack Pierson and Catherine Opie at Waters’s request. He had no idea how they would be installed until he walked in on Tuesday.\n\n“I always liked the Baltimore Museum—it’s one of the first places that ever gave me recognition, way before it was safe to like me,” Waters says. “I’ve always stayed in Baltimore. My career would not have worked as well if I had left.”\n\nI asked how having his private collection now in the hands of a public institution got his juices going. He said he was especially keen on having the difficult works enrage and bedevil the everyday Baltimore residents who come to the museum to see the Matisses. He bent down to show me Mike Kelley’s Child Substitute (1995), a crude collage of cutouts of cats pasted on paper.\n\n“This is my favorite Mike Kelley because it so infuriates people,” Waters said.\n\n“It’s very Mike Kelley,” I said.\n\n“It is. It’s pitiful, and he invented pitiful,” Waters replied. “But pitiful’s very important. A lot of this art is pitiful. It’s a movement of pitiful.”\n\nWe came upon a framed piece of lined paper upon which Cy Twombly had written down his address. When an artist jots down a note for logistical purposes, it’s usually not an artwork. Then again, some of the late artist’s works are just words he wrote on canvas, and his makeshift business card sure did look like a Twombly.\n\n“That I love,” Waters says. “And I always said I would never show it because I met him and we were hanging out and I said, ‘Can I…?’ That’s how he wrote his address down for me.”\n\nTo hammer the point home, there’s a Twombly piece around the corner, Five Greek Poets and a Philosopher, that is just text, just the names of the poets and the philosopher. John Waters Sr. was so angry that his son had spent his hard-earned movie money on the work that he made his own Twombly to show how anybody could do it, scrawling “Crazy” in a style uncannily like that of the artist and then signing it “Cy W.” It’s now in the collection of the BMA, hanging between works by Opie and Pierson.\n\nWaters entered the art world as a collector, having grown up going to galleries while at college in New York and reading about shows in The Village Voice when he was in Baltimore. He often went around with Brenda Richardson, the longtime curator at the BMA, and found it easy to get access to primo works because the dealers liked his movies so much. Mary Boone gave him a fat discount just because the painting was going into his collection. He befriended the world’s biggest dealer, Larry Gagosian, and they remain close —when Gagosian held a dinner for Andreas Gursky in May, he saved the seat right next to him for Waters.\n\n“He hired me to write the text for the Elizabeth Taylor Warhol show, and my things would have made the collectors so crazy,” Waters says. “He printed them on the wall, what I said. He was great. He didn’t censor anything. I haven’t bought anything from Larry in a while—by the time they get to him, I can’t afford anything.”\n\nIt was way harder for the galleries to take him seriously as an artist. He didn’t have the bona fides of an art-school education and a Yale MFA, and could be seen as a Tinseltown interloper slumming it in SoHo with the art freaks. That changed after talking with one of the dealers he bought from, American Fine Arts founder Colin de Land.\n\n“Colin was my first dealer—I would have never made it in the art world without Colin, because there’s nothing people hate in the art world more than somebody coming in from show business,” Waters says. “There’s nothing more hated. Colin, he legitimized me. He said to me, ‘Do you ever paint?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have all these little pictures.’ He said, ‘What do you mean you have these little pictures?’ Because I had some, but I hadn’t shown them to anybody. So he came down and saw them, and he gave me a show.”\n\nAfter a few shows, he became accepted as a peer by the artists he bought work by, and he could start getting work through trades, including works by Christopher Wool and Larry Clark. Some of the artists became his friends. Richard Serra gave him a deeply affectionate birthday present—a drawing of two Serraean shapes humping each other, signed “Happy Birthday John Richard Serra 1996.” He swears that the famously taciturn Serra is actually a barrel of laughs.\n\n“I jitterbugged with him at the SqueezeBox. He led, of course,” Waters says, referring to the legendary party held at now defunct downtown club Don Hill’s in the late ’90s. “No one could imagine that. When people saw it, they were like, Oh, oh, he’s hilarious. He does have a good sense of humor. And a big, great heart.”\n\nCindy Sherman, who’s represented in the show, is another old friend, and played herself in Waters’s 1998 art-world satire, Pecker, in which the art world in Manhattan is forced to come down to Baltimore to get a piece of an in-demand photographer. He also loved Sherman’s one feature film, 1997’s Office Killer. Next to Sherman in the show is her fellow Pictures Generation icon, the appropriation artist Richard Prince.\n\n“My favorite thing Richard Prince ever did that I read about—I don’t have one—is you’d hire him to do your portrait,” Waters says. “And he’d say, ‘Show me a picture of yourself you like.’ And he’d take a picture of that and give it to you. So good.”\n\nSherman and Prince are art superstars making instantly recognizable work, but a good chunk of the collection is stuff by artists that experts couldn’t place, or even consider to be art without a bit of context. Waters has to tell visitors at his house not to hang their jackets up on a work by Richard Baker, Coat Hook (2014), that happens to look exactly like a coat hook but is painted paper. Douglas Padgett has two untitled paintings that throw people for a loop, because one looks exactly like an electrical socket and the other looks exactly like a light switch. The housekeepers keep trying to clean up Tony Matelli’s Yo (it’s a dirty mirror), pick Dan Herschlein’s The Belt off the floor (it’s a metal sculpture of a belt installed on the floor next to the closet in a bedroom, where a belt would be), or pick up the pieces of a Fischli/Weiss work that consists of painted shards of polyurethane foam.\n\n“A lot of the work I have is the cleaning people’s enemy,” Waters said.\n\nWaters’s most notorious such work is installed in a roped-off area of his Baltimore home in the Tuscany-Canterbury area north of downtown: Gregory Green’s Work Table #7 (1998., The area is called the “bomb room” because it very well could function as a lab where a terrorist could make a bomb. When former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley used to come over for his Christmas party, his security detail would be quite surprised to see that in the house.\n\n“We went around Baltimore and bought every single thing—today they would call the police because every single thing we bought is legal to blow up a huge place, except the gunpowder,” Waters says. “Every single thing you can buy. And we did go buy it all. So today someone would’ve probably alerted a tactical squad.”\n\nAt 76, Waters is not getting any younger. The announcement of the donation came because he’s putting his estate in order, and a gift would be necessary to avoid giant taxes. But he’s still keeping busy, writing and performing his Christmas special each year and taking it on the road for the entire month of December. And then in January, he tells me, he’ll sit down to write the script for Liarmouth, adapted from his own novel. It’ll be his first film in 20 years. Village Roadshow Entertainment is producing, and he’s back in the director’s chair.\n\nWhat he wants as his legacy is the John Waters Restrooms. As part of the donation, the museum agreed to name four gender-neutral bathrooms after him, an unusual request that’s perhaps unprecedented in the history of museum-giving. He said that though he was fighting with former BMA director Christopher Bedford over the decision to deaccession a Warhol, Bedford “didn’t miss a beat when I said I wanted the bathrooms named after me.”\n\n“So when you use the bathrooms tonight, which you will, take a photo,” he says.\n\nI wanted to see them right away. And so we exited the show to see a pair of pristine lavatories with Waters’s name embossed beside them. And installed on the wall is a large picture taken by Barry Holniker of the filmmaker Otto Preminger exiting a bathroom stall.\n\n“This is Otto Preminger taking a shit,” Waters says. “Somebody waited. They knew he went in there, and he was in there a long time, so they knew it was not number one. And then he finally came out and he was so pissed, and there were people everywhere. It’s perfect.”\n\nAnd then on Wednesday night, members of the museum board, gallery reps, collectors, artists, and various members of his Baltimore-based talent troupe who make up Dreamland all gathered at the BMA for a cocktail party to preview the show. It was perhaps the first time that movie theater nachos have been offered as a passed hors d’oeuvre during a museum preview. After Opie and Pierson introduced Waters, he took to the podium and talked about how much it meant to him that he was able to include a work by his dad in the show—and how his dad’s attempt to out-Twombly Twombly was “either the most sophisticated or the least sophisticated part in the show.”\n\n“I’d like to thank my parents, who took me to the Baltimore Museum when I was a kid, and I saw art that made my friends crazy when I took it home,” he says. “And I realized the power of art. And I hope some naughty little child sees my show here and does the same thing.”\n\nThe Rundown\n\nYour crib sheet for comings and goings in the art world this week and beyond…\n\n…There’s a feud brewing in the serene land of Sweden. This week GODA, the digital marketplace founded by Pharrell Williams and Kaws, began selling 163 NFTs of works by Hilma af Klint, the Swedish artist who died in 1944 but found fame in 2019 when her show at the Guggenheim became the most visited in the museum’s history. At first glance it seems like simply another day in the art world. Just Greenpoint’s Simpsons-loving mononym and the man who gave us “Blurred Lines” selling digital-only copies of paintings by a long-dead Swedish mystic—nothing to see here. But af Klint’s descendants beg to differ. The family has for years said no to dealers trying to represent the estate and sell the works for millions. In order to sell the af Klint NFTs, GODA partnered with the publisher of the catalog raisonné and produced them with Acute Art, which is run by Daniel Birnbaum, the Swedish curator and former director of Stockholm’s Moderna Museet. Hedvig Ersman, the artist’s nephew’s great-granddaughter, told me she believes that GODA is leading buyers into thinking they’re buying real af Klints. “The current commercialization of mere photographs with a digital stamp, presented as having nearly the same status as the real physical paintings, is a scam,” she said. The af Klint family is generally united in its protestations. Ersman polled 40 members about the sale, and 28 responded, all of them against it. Nonetheless, the NFTs still sold, for a price that on Thursday was 0.4 ETH, or around $476 a pop. Reached for comment, a GODA spokesperson said that the original agreement the Hilma af Klint Foundation signed for the catalog included the possible creation of NFTs. “We have great respect for Hilma’s legacy in the art world and feel honored to have the privilege of amplifying her art in such a unique and transformative way,” the GODA rep said.\n\n…If you have $60,000 burning a hole in your pocket at the start of each month and a bit of artist-centric necrophilia, you can rent the apartment where Jean-Michel Basquiat was found dead of a heroin overdose in 1988. Basquiat’s landlord was Andy Warhol; yours will be the owners of an expensive Wagyu beef purveyor that was once only open to those with a secret number. Sadly, there’s an outpost of cursed, VC-backed Blank Street Coffee around the corner. Some pluses: You’ll live above Adam Lindemann’s gallery, Venus Over Manhattan, next to Il Buco Alimentari, and down the street from me. Rent Basquiat’s deathplace today!\n\n…Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson found the perfect work to install in the fashion brand’s first-ever LA store: Paul Pfeiffer’s Justin Bieber Head (2018), a bust of the singer in santol wood that was first shown at Thomas Dane in London. “A lot of artists have looked to Justin Bieber, so I thought there was something to this idea of iconography and being in LA,” Loewe designer Anderson—who’s a real presence in the art world, cohosting events or popping into galleries to buy stuff for the Loewe Foundation—told WWD. I am not sure if “a lot” of artists have looked to Bieber, but this bust kind of rules, so maybe more should.\n\n…Takashi Murakami has, at long last, teamed up with the one and only Post Malone to make some grails to be sold through Ntwrk, the content-creating, live-streaming online retailer. And you know that Posty had to invite Murakami to take part in the musician’s ceremonial game of beer pong—video evidence shows the Superflat master flexing some pretty legit shooting form, sinking a deep shot from way back, before Posty hits a shot of his own, getting team Murakami-Malone a big bring-back. Our guy Murakami, the secret frat star.\n\n…Just-opened fall shows to catch in New York: never-before-seen William Eggleston pictures at David Zwirner; Cheyney Thompson at Lisson and Andrew Kreps; work by the Shipibo-Conibo artist Sara Flores at Clearing’s last show at its space in Brooklyn; David Flaugher’s Morandi-like paintings and mischievously lit-up beeswax sculptures at Lomex; and Sterling Ruby’s monumental punk-but-pretty paintings with larger-than-life wall power at Gagosian.\n\n…ArtReview magazine will announce its Power 100 list on December 1, a press release announced a full two weeks in advance. Clear your calendar. Last year the art rag put NFTs as number one.\n\nScene Report: Gala Season\n\nThe chill in the air, the leaves on the ground, billionaires leaving billion-dollar auctions in order to make a dinner: That’s right, it’s gala season in New York. The last few days have been a veritable riot of fundraising shindigs, with every venue from the Rainbow Room to the IAC building booked out by organizations looking to turn costly dinner seats and purchased tax-deductible art into a year’s operational budget. On Sunday, Swiss Institute had its first bash since the pandemic at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, a deconsecrated synagogue on the Lower East Side that was transformed into a blank-canvas event space, which that night was taken over by the gala’s “creative director,” Jamian Juliano-Villani. She decided to go with a theme as surreal as one of her paintings—something approaching mid-Atlantic horse ranch in a Kubrick film, a mood board slightly foreign to natives of the land of cheese and watches and discreet banking. Juliano-Villani ceded the stage to Simon de Pury, who auctioned off a few coveted works to collectors in the room, although a work by honoree Urs Fischer valued at $400,000 had mysteriously been disappeared, or destroyed, de Pury wasn’t quite sure—regardless, he assured the audience that Fischer’s gallery, Gagosian, would sell another work privately to benefit Swiss Institute.\n\nThe following evening, there were galas for the Warhol Foundation and the Hirshhorn—the DC museum announced that musician J Balvin would be its new cultural ambassador—and Dia threw its fall benefit in a former taxi garage on West 26th Street, honoring Mary Heilmann and Brice Marden. Marilyn Minter gave a toast to Heilmann, recalling that “she was a bit cold” in the ’70s, and lightheartedly told the fun story of that one time Carl Andre tried to strangle her in the back room at Max’s Kansas City. Classic Carl Andre. (Andre’s gallery did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) And then Stanley Whitney gave a tribute to Marden in a slightly more straightforward way, describing his influence on him as a young artist while Marden’s wife and daughters looked on. And then everyone went home early. There were more galas the next night.\n\nAnd that’s a wrap on this edition of True Colors! Like what you’re seeing? Hate what you’re reading? Have a tip?
