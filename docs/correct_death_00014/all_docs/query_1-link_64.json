        "text": "Poe and Women: Recognition and Revision, Edited by Amy Branam Armiento and Travis Montgomery\n\nReview in the Journal of Gender Studies\n\n\"This engaging collection redresses the balance of Poe studies to consider his work from the perspective of women, those in his works and those reading them. . . . [It] offers a welcome emphasis on the irrepressibility of women in his work who ‘die but do not stay dead’\"\n\n-- Sara Williams, University of Hull\n\nGender, Poetry, and the Form of Thought in Later Medieval Literature, Edited by Jennifer Jahner and Ingrid Nelson\n\nReview in the Journal of English and Germanic Philology:\n\nVery much in the spirit of Robertson's many impacts on our field, this collection opens a range of fascinating apertures into the medieval literary world that promise to be useful, both to fellow scholars and in a variety of literature classrooms.\n\n--Emily Houlik-Ritchey, Rice University\n\nNew Directions in Medieval Mystical and Devotional Literature, Edited by Amy N. Vines and Lee Templeton\n\nNew Directions in Medieval Mystical and Devotional Literature not only makes a fitting tribute to a beloved scholar and teacher; it constitutes a significant contribution to the field in its own right. The essays in this beautifully presented book will be essential reading for anyone interested in late-medieval vernacular theology and its reception, both in England and beyond.\n\n--Nicholas Watson, professor of English, Harvard University\n\nPlacing Charlotte Smith, Edited by Elizabeth A. Dolan and Jacqueline M. Labbe\n\nDolan and Labbe’s wide-ranging yet cohesive collection of essays offers a comprehensive and convincing breadth that succeeds in its mission of placing Charlotte Smith. Beyond Smithian scholarship, the volume comes at a prescient time.\n\n--Heather Heckman-McKenna University of Missouri-Columbia\n\nWife of Bath in Afterlife: Ballads to Blake, by Betsy Bowden\n\nBowden delves into each case study so expansively that at the end of reading the book, the reader has been immersed in many different eighteenth-century cultural worlds. This is an immensely learned and valuable book that dares to be different and, as a result, breaks new ground.\n\n-- Marion Turner, Jesus College, University of Oxford\n\nOur Osage Hills: Toward an Osage Ecology and Tribalography of the Early Twentieth Century, Edited by Michael Snyder"
