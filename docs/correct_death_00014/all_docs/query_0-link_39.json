        "text": "The sensation Poe created with his cryptography stunt played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines. [Friedman, William F. \"Edgar Allan Poe, Cryptographer\", \"On Poe: The Best from \"American Literature\". Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993. p. 40 – 41]\n\nPoe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest in his lifetime. William Friedman, America's foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe. [Rosenheim, 15] Friedman's initial interest in cryptography came from reading \"The Gold-Bug\" as a child — interest he later put to use in deciphering Japan's PURPLE code during World War II. [Rosenheim, 146]\n\nPoe in popular culture\n\nPoe as a character\n\nThe historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often representing the \"mad genius\" or \"tormented artist\" and exploiting his personal struggles. [Neimeyer, Mark. \"Poe and Popular Culture\", \"The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe\". Cambridge University Press, 2002. ISBN 0521797276 p. 209] Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting Poe and his characters share identities. [Gargano, James W. \"The Question of Poe's Narrators,\" \"Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays\", Ed. Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967. p. 165] Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as \"The Poe Shadow\" by Matthew Pearl. [cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |coauthors= |title=The Poe Shadow |date=2006-06-06 |publisher= |url =http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/06/features/bookwed.php |work =International Herald Tribune |pages = |accessdate = 2007-10-13]\n\nPreserved homes, landmarks, and museums\n\nNo childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items Poe used during his time with the Allan family and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. The dorm room Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826 is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society. [ [http://www.uvaravensociety.com/ Raven Society Homepage] . University of Virginia. Retrieved on December 16, 2007.]\n\nThe earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe). [cite web|url=http://www.eapoe.org/balt/poehse.htm |title=The Baltimore Poe House and Museum |accessdate=2007-10-13 |publisher=Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore] It is open to the public and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 1843–1844, is today preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site. [cite news |first=Niccole |last=Burns |title=Poe wrote most important works in Philadelphia |date=2006-11-15 |publisher=School of Communication — University of Miami |url =http://com.miami.edu/parks/philapoeauthor.htm |work = |accessdate = 2007-10-13] Poe's final home is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage in the Bronx, New York.\n\nOther Poe landmarks include a building in the Upper West Side, where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote \"The Raven\" here. In Boston, a plaque hangs near the building where Poe was born once stood. Believed to have been located at 62 Carver Street (now Charles Street), the plaque is possibly in an incorrect location. [Van Hoy, David C. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/02/18/the_fall_of_the_house_of_edgar/ \"The Fall of the House of Edgar\"] . \"The Boston Globe\", February 18, 2007] [Glenn, Joshua. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/brainiac/2007/04/_a_globe_reader.html The house of Poe -- mystery solved!] \"The Boston Globe\" April 9, 2007] The bar in which legend says Poe was last seen drinking before his death still stands in Fells Point in Baltimore, Maryland. Now known as The Horse You Came In On, local lore insists that a ghost they call \"Edgar\" haunts the rooms above. [Lake, Matt. \"Weird Maryland\". Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006. ISBN 1402739060 p. 195. ]\n\nPoe Toaster\n\nAdding to the mystery surrounding Poe's death, an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the \"Poe Toaster\" has paid homage to Poe's grave every year since 1949. As the tradition has been carried on for more than 50 years, it is likely that the \"Poe Toaster\" is actually several individuals; however, the tribute is always the same. Every January 19, in the early hours of the morning, the man makes a toast of cognac to Poe's original grave marker and leaves three roses. Members of the Edgar Allan Poe Society in Baltimore have helped in protecting this tradition for decades. On August 15, 2007, Sam Porpora, a former historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore where Poe is buried, claimed that he had started the tradition in the 1960s. The claim that the tradition began in 1949, he said, was a hoax in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed, [Hall, Wiley. \" [http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=2007-08-15_D8R1O6LO0&show_article=1&cat=breaking Poe Fan Takes Credit for Grave Legend] ,\" Associated Press, August 15, 2007.] and some details he has given to the press have been pointed out as factually inaccurate.
