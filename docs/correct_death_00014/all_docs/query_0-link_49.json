        "text": "Well, I technically live in Baltimore City (by about 500 feet), so Fort McHenry, The Star Spangled Banner, birthplace of Babe Ruth, death place of Edgar Allen Poe, Cal Ripken, Michael Phelps, Johnny Unitas, Ray Lewis, Blue Crabs, the first commercial railroad in the US... etc. If you want to know what the town I grew up in, Severna Park, is famous for, about the only thing I can think of is that John Waters filmed part of the movie Polyester there. And Pat Sajak had a house there for a while.\n\nBrenham is the home of Blue Bell Ice Cream.\n\nSome of you will sigh and think happy thoughts about childhood, summer, birthdays and apple pie when you read those words.\n\nOthers will not know why that's a big deal.\n\nI'm in the first group. I am happy for the second group, contrary to logic, as these folks still have the experience of tasting Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla for the first time"
