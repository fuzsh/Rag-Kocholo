Whether you're a local or a visitor, there are plenty of ideas here that are perfect for a special night with your significant other.\n\nWhether you're looking for a casual night out or a more formal occasion, you're sure to find something that suits your tastes and interests in this vibrant city. So, get ready to explore Baltimore with your love and make memories that will last a lifetime!\n\nThere are some affiliate links below, but they are all products I highly recommend. For more info, view my disclosure.\n\nRomantic Restaurants\n\nBaltimore is home to plenty of romantic restaurants, from Charleston to Hampden's La Cuchara. Whether you want a vegan-friendly meal with ambiance or some classic Chesapeake seafood, these spots are nothing if not delicious.\n\nCharleston Restaurant is one of the city's favorite eateries. This fine dining destination was even featured in TripAdvisor's 2019 list of America's most romantic restaurants! Led by Chef Cindy Wolf, Charleston's fan-favorite dishes include lobster soup, foie gras, and an obligatory aphrodisiac: fried oysters.\n\nLocated in the Four Seasons Hotel, Bygone is a rooftop restaurant that offers panoramic views of the city and a contemporary American menu. The restaurant's menu features dishes made with seasonal and locally-sourced ingredients, and the wine list is especially impressive.\n\nBasque-inspired La Cuchara is another Charm City favorite, known for its popular dishes like calamari, oysters, and veal tongue bocadillo. The intimate atmosphere, extensive wine list, and delicious cuisine combine for the date-night dinner of anyone's dreams.\n\nThese restaurants and more are loved by locals and visitors alike and are sure to make for a delicious date night.\n\nCultural Activities\n\nArt aficionados, history buffs, and everyone in between will find themselves feeling more cultured after experiencing the Baltimore dating scene. The city is home to a variety of cultural attractions, including museums, performing arts venues, and historical sites.\n\nThe Walters Art Museum is one such destination and a budget-friendly date night idea at that. Admission to the Mount Vernon museum and its special exhibits is always free! This leaves plenty of opportunity to treat your partner to something from the gift shop to remember this meaningful date.\n\nAmateur literary historians likely know Baltimore as the death place of legendary writer Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nToday, you and the one that you love with a love that is more than love can visit the Poe House, a National Historic Landmark and museum. This spot was Poe’s home during the 1830s, and it is now open to the public, dedicated to his life and work.\n\nThe Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture is dedicated to preserving and promoting the history and culture of African Americans in Maryland. The museum features exhibits that cover a wide range of topics, including art, history, and culture.\n\nIts collection includes objects from the colonial period through the present day and covers a wide range of topics, including slavery, abolition, the Civil War, and the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nDate Night Entertainment\n\nBaltimore offers a wide variety of entertainment options for a fun and engaging date night. Plan your next hot date around live music, comedy shows, or even magic acts here in the city!\n\nThe historic Hippodrome Theatre came to life once more when The France-Merrick Performing Arts Center opened in 2004. Here, you'll find touring Broadway and notable names like comedian Trevor Noah — and that's just within a few weeks of 2023.\n\nIllusions Bar & Theater is another must-visit attraction, with what the location describes as a blend of “comedy, sleight of hand, mentalism and even a bit of danger to create a show you won't soon forget!” The Art Deco bar is full-service, with an array of cocktails and spirits for every taste.\n\nThe Baltimore Symphony Orchestra provides a truly elegant option for your next Baltimore date night. The BSO is one of the most renowned orchestras in the country, and it offers a wide range of performances throughout the year.\n\nThe orchestra performs at the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, a beautiful concert hall located in Baltimore's cultural district.\n\nOutdoor Activities\n\nRegardless of if you take a waterside stroll hand-in-hand with your sweetheart or head out for a hike, Baltimore has an outdoor date idea for you.\n\nGet a breath of fresh air after your dinner date or plan for a lazy Sunday morning in the park with some of the city's favorite outdoor spots.\n\nA picturesque Inner Harbor date could include a variety of activities, depending on your interests and the season. For instance, you could meet your significant other at the waterfront, where you can take a stroll along the promenade and admire the views of the water and the city skyline.\n\nFor a day on the water with a more laid-back agenda, plan for a boat tour that lets you learn more about the area even as you see the sights. You could even arrange for a sunset sail!\n\nOf course, no Baltimore excursion would be complete without a bit of baseball.\n\nCamden Yards, home of the Baltimore Orioles, is one of the most iconic and historic ballparks in America. Attending a game at Camden Yards is a great way to experience the energy and excitement of a live baseball game.\n\nThe ballpark offers great views of the field from all seats, and there are plenty of food and drink options available. The atmosphere at Camden Yards is lively and fun, making it the perfect spot for a date night.\n\nCharm City's parks are another one of its highlights, with destinations like Patterson Park, Federal Hill Park, and Druid Park.\n\nEach of these locations offers activities and the simplicity of a romantic stroll. Take some photos at the Patterson Park Pagoda or visit the Howard Peters Rawlings Conservatory & Botanic Gardens for an Insta-worthy backdrop.\n\nThese parks and others in the area are all near to other Baltimore points of interest, so you can plan a full day of fun with your special someone.\n\nDating in Baltimore, Maryland\n\nWhether you're looking for a romantic evening, an adventurous outing, or a unique cultural experience, Baltimore has something to offer.\n\nWith its rich history, beautiful waterfront, and vibrant food and drink scene, this is the perfect destination for a memorable date night.
