        "text": "(2 of 3)\n\nThe far-flung settings of the book are straightforward. A suburb of Auckland, N.Z., is dominated by a North American-style shopping mall called Heaven-field\"a huge windowless pretence, as much an insinuation of Elsewhere as its own name or that of the city or the restaurant, Manhattan, as its entrance.\" Baltimore, Md., death place of Edgar Allan Poe, is recognizable, with its gray asphalt, red brick and black iron gratings, as are the affluent hills of Berkeley. \"passing through a 'wilderness' phase where it was fashionable to let meadow grass and herbs grow as they pleased, and the wild creatures come and go in the gardens and on the hillside roads.\"\n\nThere, in the guise of Novelist Alice Thumb, the narrator accepts an invitation from an elderly couple to use their vacation in Italy. Her writer's eye quickly perceives that the dwelling's modern angularities serve no other function than a change from the traditional. Its furnishings are a collection of expensive replicas; the library is a random reflection of the chic. One volume is titled A Lifetime Reading Plan.\n\nSuddenly it all belongs to Alice. A lawyer calls to say that her hosts have been killed in an Italian earthquake and that she is their sole heir. She is also advised that the departed had invited four others to use the house, and that it would be kind if Alice let them come. When they arrive, she becomes distracted from her work in progress and writes instead about her guests: the British desert lover, described as an \"experiential snob,\" because he thinks that his search for God makes him superior to his wife who quests only for a better Parmesan cheese; a 60-year-old soil erosion specialist who fancies himself the savior of other people's lives and careers; and his young, adoring hungarian wife.\n\nReaders of Frame's Scented Gardens for the Blind and Yellow Flowers in the Antipodean Room will be prepared for the unexpected. Literary aestheticians can ponder the author's ideas on replica and originals. Structural purists may find her infusions of poetry unwiedly and unnecessary. Frame herself simply calls the book an entertainment. It is that and more, for she proves to be not only spinner of bizarre and hunting fantasy but a sharp social observer as well. Her descriptions of New Zealand suburbanization, of California as public confessional booth, of television and religious fakers convey a reality as urgent as Alice Thumb's creativeschizophrenia. R.Z. Sheppard\n\nExcerpt\n\n\"You will say that such a dream is arrogant, ambitious, unoriginal, and of course it is ... I too will write a book. Another book. I know that our age has been propelled, blackmailed into becoming the Age of Explanation. I feel that literate people have almost explained themselves away. I use the word 'literate' as a fact, not a judgment. At first, you remember, Alice Thumb, it was our anxiety, our unease which was explained away, but in the process, we ourselves have been disappearing. The efficiency of our explanations is like that of the insecticide which reduces the insect to a crumbling shell."
