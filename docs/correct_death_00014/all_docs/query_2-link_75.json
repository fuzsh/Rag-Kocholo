        "text": "As Poe’s famous character, C. Auguste Dupin, would, we must retrace Poe’s last steps to try to deduce what happened to him. Poe’s last few days are murky, but we do know a few facts.\n\nOn Sept. 26, 1849, he had just returned to Richmond, Virginia, after a lecture tour through Philadelphia, Richmond, and Norfolk, where he had been attempting to raise money for his upcoming magazine, The Stylus. He was scheduled to continue on to New York and planned on stopping in Baltimore along the way to edit a friend’s poems.\n\nDuring his brief time in Richmond, he visited with his fiance, Elmira Royster Shelton. She noted that he seemed ill at the time, and urged him to call off the trip. There had been a cholera epidemic in Philadelphia while Poe had been visiting, and he had been showing symptoms of some illness before he returned to Richmond.\n\nBut Poe was not dissuaded. He intended to travel by boat to Baltimore, where he would meet his friend and spend some time editing her poems, then continue by train to New York to pick up his aunt Maria Clemm to bring her back to live with him in Richmond.\n\nAround 9:30 that same evening, he met with an old friend, Dr. John Carter, in his office. They chatted for a while; Carter said he seemed well. Then Poe took his leave rather suddenly, saying he was going to Saddler’s, a popular nearby restaurant. In his haste, he took the doctor’s cane — which contained a hidden sword — and left his own.\n\nCarter waited for his friend to return with his cane, but he never did. Carter later spoke with Saddler, the restaurant owner, and discovered that while there, Poe had met with some friends and stayed up talking and visiting until midnight. When Poe left, Saddler said, he seemed sober and in good spirits. He had, however, left his luggage in his room at the Swan Tavern.\n\nPoe’s boat left at about 4:00 the next morning. He must have been on it, since he made it to Baltimore, but everything after his late dinner at Saddler’s is a mystery.\n\nThe boat arrived in Baltimore on Sept. 28. There is some evidence Poe attempted to call on an acquaintance there, but the man was out of town. Other than that, there are no records, that we know of, that can tell us of Poe’s whereabouts from Sept. 28 until Oct. 3.\n\nIt was on Oct. 3 — an election day — that Joseph W. Walker, a typesetter for a local paper, found Poe in a semi-conscious state in the street. He was delirious and dressed in ill-fitting, dirty clothes, including worn boots and a cheap palm-leaf hat. Walker only managed to get one piece of information from Poe: Dr. J.E. Snodgrass. Walker wrote a hasty note to the doctor and helped Poe into a nearby pub to wait for his arrival.\n\nWhen Snodgrass arrived, he assumed Poe to be in a drunken state, and so took him to the Washington College Hospital to their ward for recovering alcoholics. Poe was made as comfortable as possible, but he never fully regained his faculties.\n\nHe could not answer questions about his state or how he got that way. He seemed to be suffering from visual and auditory hallucinations. On occasion, he would shout, “Reynolds!” but without another name, it didn’t shed any light on the situation.\n\nAfter four days in and out of consciousness, Poe died Oct. 7, 1849. Sources differ whether his time of death was 3 a.m. or 5 a.m. No death certificate was filed, as it wasn’t required in those days. No autopsy was performed, either, before he was hastily buried in an unmarked grave in Baltimore’s Westminster Burying Grounds.\n\nLater, Dr. Moran, Poe’s physician during his stay at Washington College Hospital, wrote to Clemm, but didn’t offer any diagnosis or cause of death. Newspapers reported he died of “inflammation of the brain” or “congestion of the brain,” but there was no definitive evidence of even this vague diagnosis.\n\nUnsurprisingly, his mysterious death has fascinated Poe’s fans and mystery lovers in general. Over the years, several theories have been put forward to try and explain his cause of death.\n\nThe Demon Alcohol\n\nThe perennial favorite — and the one promoted immediately after his death — is that he died of alcoholism. It did run in his family, and he struggled with it for his entire adult life.\n\nHis friend Snodgrass, a Temperance crusader, was quick to put this theory forward, and expounded on it frequently in his lectures and writings. Griswold, who had no love for Poe, amplified that theory through his hasty obituary and later writings that painted Poe as an incorrigible drunk and opium addict.\n\nSymptoms of alcohol overdose do include mental confusion and difficulty remaining conscious — Poe’s most obvious symptoms. However, the other most common symptoms — such as vomiting, seizures, trouble breathing, slow heart rate, clammy skin, dulled responses, and extremely low body temperature — were not present. In fact, he was reported to have had a fever — not a low temperature.\n\nAnd four days of incoherence seems overly long to dry out from a bender, even a fatal one. Alcohol, even in near-lethal amounts, metabolizes within a matter of hours, not days.\n\nSo the alcohol poisoning theory doesn’t seem to hold up.\n\nA similar theory states that alcohol killed him, but in a different way — because he was diabetic. There is some evidence this could be the case, since it was well known that even small amounts of alcohol would make him ill — a possible symptom of diabetes.\n\nIndeed, if Poe was an undiagnosed diabetic, heavy drinking would cause his blood sugar to spike and induce a diabetic coma, which can look like drunkenness — dizziness, sweating, and confusion. However, the length of his stay, coupled with the fact that he would regain consciousness at times, makes the diabetes theory suspect.\n\nAnother theory states that Poe had a genetic disorder that made him intolerant to alcohol. In this condition, a missing enzyme in the liver makes it unable to metabolize alcohol.\n\nAs a result, the alcoholic byproduct starts to build up in the blood and tissues, causing symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, heart palpitations, low blood pressure, diarrhea, headache, and fatigue. Several friends and acquaintances reported that Poe would become extremely ill after drinking only a single glass of wine, so this theory does have some merit.\n\nDid he have a brain tumor?\n\nLong before Poe’s death, the doctors and nurses who had attended to his wife, Virginia, as she was dying of tuberculosis suspected that he seemed to be suffering from a “lesion of the brain.” One doctor noted that Poe had a “twist in the face” that might indicate a kind of brain lesion as well.\n\nTwenty-six years after his death, when he was exhumed from his unmarked grave to be re-interred in what is now his final resting place, the gravedigger who handled his remains reported that he heard something hard rattling around inside Poe’s skull. This could have been the calcified remains of a brain tumor, but without an autopsy, we can never know.\n\nMatthew Pearl’s book The Poe Shadow details this theory in much more detail (affiliate link).\n\nDid he fall prey to murder?\n\nJohn Evangelist Walsh’s Midnight Dreary posits Poe was killed by Shelton’s brothers (affiliate link). They knew he had an alcohol problem and were convinced that he only wanted to marry their sister for her money.\n\nAll these theories have some interesting evidence to their credit. But they all have one glaring hole: why was Poe found in clothing that wasn’t his? One could say that maybe, since he’d left his luggage behind in Richmond, Poe had simply bought whatever cheap clothing he could find. But that doesn’t quite hold up.\n\nThe clothes were not just used, they were dirty and stained, and the boots he had on were extremely worn. He was also wearing a cheap palm-leaf hat. Why would he buy dirty clothes that didn’t fit?\n\nPoe took great care to cultivate his public image and was always neatly dressed, even when he was too poor to afford more than one shirt. And why would he purchase used, worn boots and a cheap, ugly hat?\n\nThe only theory that fits the evidence (as we know it) is that Poe was the victim of a practice called “cooping.”\n\nCooping was where politically associated gangs would kidnap people, ply them with alcohol (or beat them into compliance), and force them to vote for their candidate (this was in the days before the private ballot). They would then have their victim change clothes and vote again and again.\n\nIndeed, Poe was found in Baltimore on an election day, very close by a pub that was a polling place. While the alleged coopers might have tempted him with alcohol, the evidence indicates that they probably also inflicted a blow or blows to his head.\n\nThe evidence of such blows might well have been hidden under Poe’s thick hair, and since X-rays were still 46 years away, there was no way the doctors could have diagnosed a brain injury without external wounds. This would explain why he was in and out of consciousness and delirious for several days before succumbing to his injury.\n\nIn fact, it would actually fit with the commonly reported cause of death, “inflammation of the brain,” as a subdural hematoma resulting from a blow to the head would cause inflammation in the brain and surrounding tissue. It might even explain what the gravedigger heard rattling around in Poe’s skull — perhaps it was a small skull fragment from the blunt-force trauma, now freed by decomposition.\n\nHowever, without an exhumation and a thorough autopsy, we will never know for sure how Poe met his strange fate. For now, the last chapter of the poet and Gothic storyteller will have to remain a mystery."
