        "text": "Edgar Allan Poe was a literary genius who through his later years became an acclaimed writer and poet. But how was his life connected to Baltimore? What ties does he have to the city of Baltimore? Edgar Allan Poe’s work was shaped by his experiences in Baltimore and continue to impact the city to this day.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe’s Background\n\nEdgar Allan Poe’s family was established in Baltimore in the mid-1700s. Baltimore held great significance with him as it was where he met his wife and rooted his career. It was often said that Edgar Allan Poe even claimed Baltimore as his birthplace, even though it wasn’t the case. In Baltimore, Edgar Allan Poe began his internal revolution from poet to original short story writer.\n\nIn August 1835, Edgar Allan Poe left Baltimore for Richmond, Virginia, and later died of a mysterious death in 1849. There are many theories surrounding his death, ranging from alcoholism to diseases such as rabies.\n\nHow Baltimore Shaped Edgar Allan Poe’s Future\n\nBaltimore shaped Edgar Allan Poe’s future by being a place of remembrance for his childhood. Not only that, but Baltimore was where he felt himself and was able to reach deeper into his creativity. Despite Edgar Allan Poe’s many travels after he moved from Baltimore, he constantly referred back to the city as a place of beautiful memories that never left him.\n\nBaltimore Salutes Edgar Allan Poe After All These Years\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZlfOdmgWAP/?taken-at=73092740\n\nBaltimore pays homage to Edgar Allan Poe through a variety of ways. The main one way is through the Edgar Allan Poe House & Museum in which people can see where the author lived, along with artifacts showcasing his life and work. Another way Baltimore remembers Edgar Allan Poe is by means of the Baltimore Ravens team mascots; which are all ravens, and aptly named Edgar, Allan, and Poe."
