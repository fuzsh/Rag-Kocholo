I am especially beholden to Ed Folsom, mentor and friend, who provided invaluable encouragement and feedback from the earliest stages of this book’s inception through its completion. Without his support, this book, not to mention my career as a scholar, would still amount to nothing more than a loose collection of stray thoughts. Paula Bernat Bennett, who read the entire manuscript for the University of Missouri Press, also deserves special mention. Her pointed critical engagement throughout the revision process was precisely the catalyst the manuscript needed, and the book has been improved immeasurably by virtue of her involvement. These two individuals have taught me the meaning of collegiality, and I cannot repay the debts I owe them but by seeking to emulate their examples. Anything worthy of merit here likely emerged as a result of fruitful conversations held with them. I am anxious to acknowledge the members of the University of Iowa community that were influential in this book’s development: Laura Rigal, Kathleen Diffley, Matthew Brown, Joni Kinsey, Garrett Stewart, James Lambert, Joshua Matthews, Stephanie Blalock, Mark Mattes, and Chad Wrigelsworth. My colleagues in the English department at Florida Atlantic University have provided a rich and supportive environment for developing this book as well. I thank them for their support, and the intellectual home they have provided me. I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge, in particular, Wenying Xu and Andrew Furman, who supported me as I sought time and funding to complete the book, as well as Steve Blakemore, Taylor Hagood, Lisa Swanstrom, John Golden, and Wendy Hinshaw, who have read drafts, held lengthy conversations, and enthusiastically encouraged me as I moved the project along. Florida Atlantic University has been very generous throughout the process—providing intellectually wealthy colleagues, funding, time off for conducting research, and engaged graduate students—all of which helped bring this book to fruition. In addition to those just mentioned, there are several other scholars who have, in one way or another, contribted to the creation of this book: Michael Cohen, Mary DeJong, Tyler Hoffman, Barbara Cantalupo, Jeffrey Savoye, Ed Cutler, Gloria Cronin, Trent Hickman, Matthew Wickman, Emron Esplin, and James Swensen.

Several institutions have offered crucial support to me throughout the writing of this book. At the University of Missouri Press I have had the genuine pleasure of working with Clair Willcox and Sara Davis. Their support of this project has been unwavering, and the level of professionalism they have displayed has been exemplary. I’m deeply thankful for their interest and efforts. Likewise, I would like to thank the librarians, curators, and/or staff at the Iowa Women’s Archives, the University of Iowa Library Special Collections, LaBudde Special Collections at the University of Missouri Library, the Los Angeles County Museum of Fine Arts, the Smith College Museum of Art, the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages, the Library of Congress, and the Walt Whitman Archive. Portions of chapter one appeared in the Edgar Allan Poe Review, and early versions of chapters three and four appeared in the Walt Whitman Quarterly Review and in Sentimentalism in Nineteenth-Century America: Literary and Cultural Practices. I’m grateful to those associated with these publications for their support of this project. I’d also like to offer special thanks to Miriam Poe Bond Kopper for allowing me to reproduce the portrait of Virginia Clemm Poe found here. Finally, I wish to dedicate this book to my parents, Jann and Brent Bradford, who filled my head with narratives lyrical and musical from the earliest age, and to my own family, Tiffany, Noah, Isaac, Lucy and James, without whom, there would be no stories to tell.\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

He was probably without his customary boutonnière, as little if anything would have been blooming in late November, and a hothouse flower would have been a luxury hard to come by and even harder to afford. Still, he would have cut a fashionable figure, dressed as he usually was in those days in a stylish “frock coat and high hat” and carrying the obligatory “small cane” then in vogue.1 Perhaps he stopped in at his parents’ home at 71 Prince Street or dropped by the offices of Alden Spooner’s Long Island Star to deliver one of the many articles on temperance, theater, music, education, or literature that he had agreed to write for that publication. Regardless, his way ultimately lay along Fulton Street, and once he reached it he would have merged with the growing press of people heading for the ferry, boarded the boat’s broad, flat decks, and wended his way through the coaches, wagons, peddlers’ carts, and other foot passengers to a spot where he could engage in a 1\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

Whitman’s destination that morning was the corner of Manhattan’s Broadway and Duane streets—304 Broadway, to be exact. The small office there, home to the Broadway Journal, had recently moved from 135 Nassau Street, near the corner of Nassau and Beekman in the heart of the city’s printing district, to its current location further northeast on Broadway. Walking north from the ferry landing would have taken Whitman past haunts he knew well, the city’s bustling periodicals center, or “newspaper row.” He likely passed the offices of several periodicals with which he was familiar, those of George Morris and Nathaniel Parker Willis’s the Evening Mirror where he had worked the year before, Park Benjamin’s the New World in which Whitman’s widely selling temperance novel Franklin Evans had appeared, the New York Aurora where he had served as editor a few years prior, and perhaps even the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, which had, the month before, published Whitman’s sentimental anti-gallows piece, “Revenge and Requital: A Tale of a Murderer Escaped.” From the row his way lay across City Hall Park. Its stately gas lamps, a stunning sight for nightly visitors, would have been extinguished with the morning light, but his passage would nevertheless have been graced by the sight and sound of water gushing from Croton Fountain, a sound that would have been lost as he approached the park’s northern border and emerged onto Broadway a few blocks southwest of his destination. The Broadway Journal was not Whitman’s paper; indeed, his most steady employer at the time was, as mentioned, the Long Island Star, housed in Brooklyn. This did not prevent Whitman from earning the stray dollar from other local papers by submitting stories, articles, and reviews to them as well. It was just such freelance work that brought him from Brooklyn to Manhattan, past newspaper row, City Hall Park, and down Broadway to the door of the Broadway Journal. Stepping inside the building, leaving behind the rumble of the omnibuses, the grunting of the hogs in the street, and perhaps a stray note or two from J.F. Browne’s harp shop and Thomas Chamber’s Piano Forte store, Whitman would have mounted the stairs to the second floor and entered the office. The Journal had only been in its new location for a few days, and the chaos and strain associated with its recent move had left its editor, as Whitman described him, “languid, tired out, it is true,” and yet still “altogether ingratiating” in his welcome to the young writer.2 While likely dressed “with perfect neatness” in his usual black well-worn frockcoat, vest, and cravat not dissimilar\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

Poe testified to as much not only in his kindly conversation with Whitman in the Broadway Journal’s offices, but when he situated the piece on the page following the volume’s opening story, his own “A Tale of the Ragged Mountains.” He even generously located it between two poems written by well-known luminaries Francis Sargent Osgood and Fitz-Halleck Greene, placement sure to draw many a readerly eye to it. Poe’s generosity arguably had less to do with any intrinsic fascination he may have had with the event Whitman was reporting on--certain “performances of the Cheney family in Niblo’s Saloon” which occurred “some nights hence”— and more with the fact that in the piece Whitman articulated the importance of what he called “heart-singing,” singing which elevates the mind and “touches the souls and sympathies.”7 In a rather ebullient declaration, Whitman claimed to “[a]t last . . . have found, and heard, and seen something original and beautiful in the way of American musical execution,” “heart singing” of “elegant simplicity” which not only “put[s] one in mind of health . . . fresh air . . . [and] sunrise” but which “appeals to the throbbing of the great heart of humanity itself ” by “touch[ing] the souls and sympathies” and giving birth to “religious feelings.”8 In his estimation, the “effects” of such singing upon the “very soul” of a listener are profound, and although perhaps “not be seen in a day, or a year . . . yet these effects are potent invisibly” and ultimately serve to “tinge [even] the manners and morals” of anyone fortunate enough to hear such music.9 Whitman’s championing of a music whose impact on a listener served to inspire spiritual reverie, generate a sense of humanity’s interconnectedness, and evoke strong emotion apparently resonated so strongly with Poe that Poe felt compelled to add an editorial endorsement to Whitman’s piece when publishing it. Below Whitman’s article Poe took the time, and page space, to add a\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

It is a congruence which Poe’s later writing on such works—on their effects and purpose—confirms. In 1848, Poe went on to suggest that verses (musical and, even more germane to this book, poetic ones) should always work to “excite . . . by elevating, the soul,”11 a statement akin to Whitman’s that such should “[touch] the souls and sympathies” of those that hear them, arousing “potent” “effects” and almost “religious feelings.”12 Even more explicitly, Poe claimed in his most detailed aesthetic manifesto, “The Poetic Principle,” that “when by poetry-–or when by music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods,—we find ourselves melted into tears-–we weep then . . . through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever, those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem, or through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.”13 For Poe, as it seemingly was for Whitman even in the decade preceding his production of Leaves of Grass, any verses worthy of being sung or chanted must work to produce “effects” that inspired the soul and spurred the sentiments, giving birth to spiritual or “religious” feelings and perhaps even “brief and indeterminate glimpses” of “divine and rapturous joys.”14 This brief interaction and seemingly momentary aesthetic convergence of two of nineteenth-century America’s most prominent authors has, for the most part, been consigned to the dustbins of literary history, a fact that is, in some ways, understandable. It is a peculiar exchange, not only because of the subject discussed, but also because it is a conversation that takes place in rhetorical registers with which neither writer is generally associated—namely, the sympathetic and affective tones of that sentimental discourse which permeated American literary culture during the period. Whitman’s claim that it is in those songs of the “heart” that “souls and sympathies” are brought into communion with the “throbbing of the great heart of humanity itself ” invokes language and ideas that could easily have appeared in the work of sentimental writers such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, Susan Warner, or Sarah J. Hale.15 The same could\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction 5 be said of the language Poe uses in his concurring lament when he states that music which stirs “the natural heart of man” is “sadly disdained . . . right now.”16 Is it possible that these two authors could have been more intimately indebted to the literary and cultural discourses of sentimentalism than generally thought, and if so, is it possible to see this sentimental influence as an important thread binding their work to each other’s as well? Since the publication of Jane Tompkins’s seminal essay “Sentimental Power: ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ and the Politics of Literary History” (1981), scholars have come to see the period’s sentimental literature as more than the inferior and corrupt aesthetic practice that Ann Douglass suggests in The Feminization of American Culture (1977). Not only was sentimentality a profoundly empowering discourse for women, as Tompkins argues, but also for those men who employed it. Scholars like Douglass Branch noted as early as the 1930s that sentimentalism marked the work of nineteenth-century male writers such as Donald Grant Mitchell, Timothy Shay Arthur, and even George Lippard.17 More recently, strains of sentimentalism have been identified in works by Charles Brockden Brown, Frederick Douglass, and Herman Melville.18 There is even a scattering of scholarship that touches on the role of sentimentality in Whitman and Poe’s work, although none of the scholars who have investigated it have examined the way in which sentimentality links the work of these two authors. For example, Thomas Brasher, in his edition of Whitman’s early work, notes, and laments, the direct link between Whitman’s pre-Leaves of Grass writing and the sentimental literature of the period. Sherry Ceniza has explored the influence of poet Abby Hills Price on Whitman’s thinking about feminism and abolition. And Gregory Eiselein has linked Whitman’s handling of the poem “When Lilacs Last in the Door Yard Bloom’d” to the poetry of mourning and consolation that I study here. The same goes for Poe. Jonathan Elmer has noted Poe’s (sentimental) obsession with the afterlife, while Eliza Richards, most importantly, has linked Poe to a cadre of sentimental poetesses whose own work shaped and was shaped by Poe’s. Studies like these suggest an otherwise unsuspected kinship emerging between these writers’ work and the sentimental literature of the period that I am anxious to expand upon—a kinship that actually brings into focus the unique nature of the relationship that exists between Whitman and Poe. It is in their mutual engagement with sentimental literary culture that these two writers meet, and it is here that the horizon of opportunity exists for seeing their literary works as integrally connected to one another. Understanding Whitman’s\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\n6 Communities of Death and Poe’s discursive engagement with the literary and cultural practices associated with sentimentalism thus not only helps us better understand the aesthetics at the heart of their literature’s production and reception, it also limns connections between poetic projects that otherwise appear to be radically different from one another. Building on the work of these scholars, I will contend here that Whitman and Poe, as their brief exchange in the Broadway Journal suggests, not only recognized the promise and potential of sentimentalism’s discursive models, but also, and even more important, that they created, disseminated, and expected their work to be read within the literary, interpretive, and cultural registers provided by it. I will suggest, that is, that the literary language, practices, and the interpretive lenses provided by nineteenth-century America’s sentimental culture were crucial to these author’s literary projects, as they were to many other male writers of the period, and that they employed them-–refashioning them in the same moments they turned to them-–for many of the same reasons that their female counterparts did: to foster interpersonal and social cohesion, and to promote personal, political and social reform. The actual contours of Poe’s and Whitman’s relationship become perceivable as one takes into account the peculiar nature of the responses to Poe’s work that were penned by nineteenth-century readers. While most modern readers see Poe’s work, especially his Gothic and macabre poems and tales, as psychologically tortured, plagued by a sense of the dissolution of the self, and presenting a subversive challenge to the period’s social ideas, rituals, and practices, nineteenth-century readers frequently saw it quite differently. In fact, a significant number of them testified that Poe’s tortured ejaculations, his sadly alienated pronouncements, and his subversive depictions nevertheless ironically worked toward largely recuperative ends. For many readers, such work ultimately produced or confirmed what Poe’s aesthetic philosophy declared: that all literature that “deserves its title” should give a sense of the “immortality of Man,” a “prescience of the glories beyond the grave,” and even a greater recognition of those “divine and rapturous joys” with which contemporary sentimental literature and culture were so enamored.19 Whitman was foremost among such readers. He repeatedly testified to the oddly recuperative potential of Poe’s Gothic and macabre literature and claimed that it played a central role in spurring him to produce the rather remarkably transcendent Leaves of Grass. This fact, alone, necessitates a reassessment of the relationship between these two poets and their works and adds an air of relevancy, if not urgency, to those moments when the two authors, their\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nIntroduction 7 ideas, and their works, converged. Whitman further illuminated the dynamics of this literary relationship in a series of articles and essays, the first of which appeared in Washington’s Evening Star on November 18, 1875—the day following Whitman’s attendance of Poe’s reburial in Baltimore. In this article, Whitman began explaining the qualities of Poe’s work that he appreciated and detailing how this work had influenced him, expanding the sympathy of thought that first emerged between them in the Broadway Journal back in 1845. In the Evening Star article Whitman wrote after the funeral, expanded upon thereafter in the Critic, and finally included in Specimen Days and Collect, Whitman claimed,\n\nCopyright © 2014.

Non-complying with these requirements, Poe’s genius has yet conquer’d a special recognition for itself, and I too have come to fully admit it, and appreciate it and him. Even my own objections draw me to him at last; and those very points, with his sad fate, will make him dearer to young and fervid minds.20 The reasons for Whitman’s appreciation, and the meaning of his otherwise strange claim that his “objections” to Poe’s work are what “draw me to him at last,” became clearer in an 1882 article written for the Critic. In this article, Whitman overtly acknowledged that what tied the two poets together was the way each of their projects grappled with what he called a culture of “morbidity”—one of the “patholog[ies]” of the age.21 Whitman claimed that their work, immured in a sentimental culture obsessed with death, symptomatically reflects and reflects upon (or in Whitman’s terms “present[s] the most mark’d indications of ”) “this disease”—this cultural “tendency . . . to morbidity.”22 In other words, Whitman believed that however disparate his and Poe’s work might otherwise appear to be, they were nevertheless marked by and intimately involved in responding to this cultural preoccupation with death and mourning. As Whitman went on to indicate, however, his favored literary response to such a cultural preoccupation was the creative depiction of “perfect and noble life, morally without flaw, happily balanced in activity, physically sound and pure, giving its due proportion, and no more, to the sympathetic, the human emotional element—a life, in all these, unhasting, unresting, untiring to the\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

As he said, “to the character . . . [I have] outlined . . . the service [that] Poe renders [in his work] is certainly that entire contrast and contradiction which is next best to fully exemplifying it.”24 Whitman’s paradoxical, and largely ignored, statement of appreciation for Poe’s work suggests that one way of thinking about their respective writings is to see them as contrasting responses to a nineteenth-century American culture of morbidity, what throughout this book I generally refer to as the period’s sentimental culture of mourning and memorializing. This relationship, Whitman was careful to stress, was less antagonistic than symbiotic, for as he proclaimed at the article’s end, Poe’s work had been of immense benefit to him as it very nearly articulated, antithetically, Whitman’s own poetic thesis. In the shadows of Poe’s writing, Whitman felt he could better perceive and limn out the contours of that more “happily balanced,” “perfect,” and perhaps even transcendent existence that he was concerned with in his own writing.25 Or, as he had stated in his initial article in the Evening Star, Whitman understood that his “objections” to Poe’s work invaluably, if not ironically, facilitated a clearer understanding of his own ideals; they were the much appreciated “effects” intimately binding and “draw[ing] me to [Poe] at last.”26 Arguably, it was this ability of Poe’s otherwise dark and despondent literature to serve in this “contrast[ing] and contradict[ory]” way that accounted for the appreciative words in Whitman’s closing, where he claimed that the “nocturnal themes, [and] demoniac undertone behind every page” of Poe’s poems and stories nevertheless served “brilliant and dazzling” purposes, and thus “by final judgment belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature.”27 Such statements certainly help account for Whitman’s inclusion of Poe among the list of those who influenced the creation of Leaves of Grass. In a late essay entitled “A Backward Glance O’er Well Traveled Roads,” which first appeared in his 1888 book November Boughs, Whitman reported that prior to embarking on the creation of Leaves he read, “Walter Scott . . . Shakespere, Ossian . . . Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, . . . the Nibelungen, the ancient Hindoo poems . . . Dante . . . [and] the Iliad,” but he reserved the most conspicuous place of honor in this long train of literary influences for Poe.28 He stated, “Toward the last I had among much else look’d over Edgar Poe’s poems—of which I was not\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

(The Poetic area is very spacious—has room for all—has so many mansions!).”29 This passage, which once more weds Whitman’s resistance to Poe’s work with his appreciation for it, not only persists in the idea that Poe ironically nurtured Whitman’s own creativity, but perhaps more important, it implies that it was only after engaging Poe’s poetry that Whitman found himself able to fully articulate his own ideas, to begin chanting his own verses regarding death as “a mysterious process of evolution.”30 Whitman may have been brought to a “boil” by the writings of Emerson, as he famously claimed elsewhere, but if so, the infusion he was brewing was necessitated by the chill he felt when reading the macabre literature of Poe (and, as will be shown, the maudlin literature of a culture of mourning in which Poe’s literature was situated). Thus, in a larger sense, Whitman’s oeuvre stands as a testament to the potential of Poe’s morbid work to spawn a greater desire to understand and articulate an ideal death and postmortem existence. As Whitman’s brilliant concluding pun—“The Poetic area is very spacious”—makes clear, the initially confining nature of Poe’s work can nevertheless open the reader up to rather large imaginings. Whitman was not alone in viewing Poe’s dark and Gothic material as an invitation to express more transcendent ideas about death and the afterlife, ideas that later readers have thought absent from his work. Indeed, as the reader response presented in this book shows, Whitman was only one among a large cadre of contemporary readers who testified that Poe’s work functioned in just such a way. From anonymous reviewers writing in contemporary magazines, to amateur poets like Miss Mary Townsend of Philadelphia, to published authors like Thomas Holley Chivers and Frances Sargent Osgood, readers frequently responded to Poe’s work by translating the evoked sense of horror, grief, or despondency into thoughts and images more transcendent, luminous, and spiritually comforting. In essence, such readers reacted to Poe’s writing by asserting mankind’s supposed immortal nature and forecasting the existence of a glorious afterlife of nearly indescribable joy and beauty—the very “effects” Poe said literature that “deserves its title” should produce.31 Arguably what predisposed readers, including Whitman, to read and respond to Poe’s work in just such a way was their immersion in that same nineteenth-century American sentimental culture of mourning and memorializing that Whitman suggested\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\n10 Communities of Death was the very liquid from which his and Poe’s work was distilled. This culture operated according to a complex set of ideas, rituals, and practices surrounding death and mourning that included an active understanding about the effects of grief on the bereaved and the bereaved’s community. Such ideas and practices provided these readers with an interpretive framework which encouraged a significant number of them to interpret Poe’s morbid reveries as other than subversive attempts to critique language, culture, or prevailing social ideas. From within this cultural framework, within the bounds of what Stanley Fish would call their “interpretive community,” these readers frequently interpreted Poe’s literature as an invitation to reassert, reinscribe, and actively participate in the broader cultural work of mourning.32 Modern readers are generally impeded from seeing the rather recuperative potential of Poe’s otherwise horrifying and macabre work because we sit well outside the bounds of this culture and this interpretive community. Nevertheless, reconstructing such an interpretive framework is at least to some degree possible, and it holds the promise of helping us better understand the constellation of cultural ideas and practices within which Whitman and Poe’s work circulated. To break then, albeit briefly, from my direct argument about Whitman and Poe in order to illuminate how nineteenth-century Americans understood grief and the process of mourning seems not only advisable but necessary. In order to articulate these differences, I turn to Sigmund Freud, to British social theorist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby, and to cultural historian and literary critic Mary Louise Kete. The majority of twentieth-century discussions of mourning begin with Freud and run through works like Totem and Taboo (1913), “Mourning and Melancholia” (1917), and The Ego and the Id (1923). In Freud’s theoretical model, “Mourning has a quite precise psychical task to perform: its function is to detach the survivor’s memories and hopes from the dead” and to reinvest the energy elsewhere.33 According to Freud, this works as the mourner repeatedly calls up images of the deceased and is confronted time and again with the painful realization that this lost loved one is no longer accessible. Faced only with the prospect of further pain, the bereaved begins to sever his or her affective ties to the dead. Through this process, Freud claims, “the work of mourning is [ultimately] completed” and “the [mourner’s] ego becomes free and uninhibited again.”34 In short, with the withdrawal of one’s emotional investment in the deceased come opportunities for reinvestment elsewhere. For Freud, this process of mourning becomes problematic when an individual is unable to\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction 11 detach from the lost loved one. In his words, when an individual seeks to perpetuate instead of relinquish such affective connections, “we consequently suspect them of a pathological disposition” which he dubbed “Melancholia.”35 For Freud, maintaining an affective attachment to a love object that can no longer reciprocate is madness, or at least something close to it. In such a paradigm, successful mourning equates with severing bonds—the dead belong to the dead, the living to the living—anything else is pathological. For nineteenth-century mourners, such thinking would have been anathema, as mourning had everything to do with perpetuating affective connections to the deceased. Modern theorists and critics like Bowlby and Kete have been reticent to see an entire cultural model for dealing with grief as somehow pathological. Consequently, they have sought out an “understanding of melancholic attachments to [the lost]” that “depathologize those attachments, making visible not only their social bases,” but “their creative . . . aspects” as well.36 The social and creative aspects of maintaining these connections become visible when one turns to examine the way in which nineteenth-century Americans mourned. Grief-work during the period was both an intensely personal and more broadly social endeavor with rather specific goals. The most important of these was to bring the bereaved to a sense of the continued vitality and accessibility of an otherwise lost but now immortal loved one. To see the deceased as an altered but still vital “self ” that could be connected with helped the mourner to move past the pain of grief and back toward productive living. As Bowlby explains, this is because when we experience “the dead . . . as a companion who accompanies [us]” through our life experience, we avoid compounding the loss of a loved one with a bewildering loss of a stable sense of self.37 Since the self is always already understood only in relationship to the others, losing those others to whom we are most intimately attached means losing an integral means by which we constitute our own sense of self. Maintaining such attachments not only means that both the deceased’s and the mourner’s “identity is preserved,” but as a consequence, Bowlby asserts, mourners are able “to reorganize their lives along lines [in which] they find meaning” despite the loss they have suffered.38 Preserving a sense of the ongoing self of the departed thus negates what might otherwise appear to be a psychologically disruptive threat to our own sense of self. After the death of his daughter Sophia in 1920, Freud actually came to understand the salubrious effects of maintaining a sense of affective attachment to a lost loved one, and he amended notions put forth in “Mourning and Mel-\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\n12 Communities of Death ancholia” and elsewhere. Following her death, Freud wrote repeatedly of the need to maintain a connection with her, admitting to friend almost a decade later, “Although we know that after such a loss the acute state of mourning will subside, we also know we shall . . . never find a substitute. . . . And actually this is how it should be. It is the only way of perpetuating that love which we do not want to relinquish.”39 As this letter suggests, Freud did not wish for nor think it proper that he give up his attachment to his lost Sophie. Personal experience, running contrary to what he had conceptualized in his earlier works, had taught him “that grief work did not turn out to be a process that could ever be completed, nor did it turn out to be a process that resulted in cutting old attachments and forming new attachments.”40 Rather, maintaining those affective attachments seemed to Freud as both normal and natural, “how it should be,” in his words.41 To assist in the process of maintaining such affective attachments, nineteenth-century Americans engaged in the creation of a wide variety of mourning objects. Hair weavings, mourning quilts, mourning portraits, and consolation poems generally asserted the ongoing vitality of the deceased and sought to broker a sense of affective connection between mourners and their lost loved ones. These objects also stand as a powerful testimony to just how social and creative mourning was during the period. These mourning objects were frequently created in collaboration or given as gifts. Thus, they forged “closer reciprocal ties” between the mourner and “the larger [sympathetic] group or community” and countered the mourner’s drive to alienate herself in her grief—a very real fear during the period.42 As the bereaved and her community worked together to maintain affective attachments to one another and to the deceased, co-creating a sense of “the dead . . . as a companion who accompanies the bereaved” through her life experience, real psychological and social benefits were experienced.43 Such ideas relative to mourning have blossomed into what is now known as the “Continuing Bonds” model of grief—which, as its name implies, asserts the salutary psychological benefits of a grieving process in which both personal and social practices assist “the bereaved [in] remain[ing] involved and connected to the deceased.”44 Such bonds, this model argues, are central to a mourner’s ability to carry on after suffering a loss, allowing her to use the occasion as a profound vehicle for engaging in the “creative . . . work” of reimagining the ongoing nature of the self and for cementing social bonds.45 Poe’s poems, which frequently depict speakers lost in grief, isolated from their communities, and unable to satisfyingly connect with their deceased loved\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

Yet nineteenth-century readers who encountered his poems failed to see them as such. Rather, they interpreted Poe’s morbid work as the expression of one trapped in the throes of unresolved grief, in desperate need of an empathetic community willing to assist the speaker or poet in recognizing the “true” nature of the immortal self and in returning to full social fellowship. More often than not, readers responded to Poe’s poetry with sympathetic articulations that encouraged speaker and/or poet to recognize the immortal nature of man and find solace in an empathetic community. Such sympathetic responses invite us to question the precise nature of Poe’s relationship to this culture, its literature and practices. Investigating this relationship is the work of my first chapter, “Poe’s Poetic Aesthetics and the Communities of Mourning.” The claims I put forward here challenge traditional critical narratives that claim Poe’s relationship to this culture is subversive in nature. By surveying a variety of artifacts, such as hair remembrancers, mourning quilts, mourning portraits, and consolation poems, chapter one illuminates how nineteenth-century Americans understood the effects of grief, the process of grieving, the mode for countering grief, and the role of aesthetic objects in facilitating this. In light of this understanding, I reveal how Poe invoked and even invited his readers to embrace contemporary cultural ideas and practices as he produced his poems and tales, and articulated his thoughts about literature. Seeing Poe and his work in this light not only invites a reassessment of Poe’s personal and literary relationship to this culture, as mentioned, it also recovers the framework necessary for understanding the responses of figures like Whitman, Townsend, Chivers, and Sarah Helen Whitman. Along the way, I disclose the mechanics of how people employed mourning objects to restore a sense of continued connection to their lost loved ones. I also show how the production and use of these artifacts conditioned individuals to respond to poetry as seemingly morbid and macabre as “Annabel Lee” and “The Raven” with a sense of empathetic commiseration as opposed to shock and horror, making these poems into invaluable tools for brokering affective connections between even the most devastatingly bereaved individuals. If nineteenth-century America’s ideas, rituals, and practices of mourning were not only central to Poe’s aesthetic philosophy but conditioned readers of even his most plaintive and morbid poetry to see these works as less subversive than might otherwise be thought, one wonders how such a framework might also have conditioned the production and reception of his Gothic tales.\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\n14 Communities of Death How might works such as “Fall of the House of Usher,” “Berenice,” and “The Case of M. Valdemar” sit in relation to an aesthetic philosophy and body of poetry more sympathetically aligned than previously thought with this sentimental culture of mourning? Is it possible to see Poe’s tales as enjoying a similar relationship to this culture and its readers? The second chapter builds on the implications of the first by exploring how these tales and others, such as the “The Premature Burial” and “The Imp of the Perverse,” demonstrate a faith in the Gothic’s ability to paradoxically bring readers to a sense of the “immortality of Man” and a “prescience of the glories beyond the grave.”46 Poe believed he could achieve this, as chapter two shows, by providing readers with thoughts and images so horrifying that they would be driven to “recoil,” in his words, against what they found there, spurred to replace these thoughts and images with something more inspiring.47 In essence, Poe felt that his Gothic literature could provide readers with an impetus as well as a dark backdrop against which to articulate a more transcendent vision of death. As the above-mentioned series of articles testifies, this is precisely the type of response Whitman had to Poe’s work, and his response was mirrored by those of several other contemporary readers whose testimonies, in the form of reviews, letters, and parodies, are analyzed in this chapter as well. Whitman’s articles were not the only place where he acknowledged the power and influence of Poe’s work, not to mention the broader literature of mourning, on his own poetic project. Whitman paid direct homage to these in his poetry as well, perhaps most provocatively in his famous poem “Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking.” Here, Whitman suggests that Poe’s literature did precisely what Poe’s aesthetic philosophies state it should have done, namely spur Whitman to begin his own radically transcendent rethinking, if not articulation, of the nature of death and the afterlife. Whitman documents this, confirming the literary relationship existing between his work, Poe’s, and the period’s literature of mourning, when he depicts his own poetic song as being called forth by the mournful cries of a mockingbird that has lost its mate—mournful cries that resonate not only with the pathos of much of the period’s body of sentimental mourning literature, but also with the actual words spoken by Poe’s famous raven. Whitman’s provocative response in “Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking” thus opens the way to reassess just how integrally his own project was conditioned in its production and reception by nineteenth-century American ideas, rituals, and literature concerning death and mourning. The intimate ties between Whitman’s work and the literature of this culture become even more\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

Much of the literature that Whitman wrote in the 1830s and ‘40s— when he was likely reading Poe’s work for the first time and sprouting the strategies and voice that would finally mature in Leaves of Grass—was sentimental by nature. Several pieces, such as those written to memorialize the death of MacDonald Clarke, are elegiac in tone and can easily be seen as following the conventions of the sentimental memorial literature of the time period. Whitman’s participation in this culture through these highly conventional 1830s and ‘40s literary pieces seems, and has seemed to many critics, like a rather strange foreground for the unconventional Leaves of Grass. But as the fourth chapter, “The Collaborative Construction of a Death-Defying Cryptext: Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass,” shows, Whitman’s famous direct address to a reader—the radical “you” that first marked his 1855 Leaves of Grass—grew out of the apostrophic styles of address that were commonly employed in sentimental mourning poems, including his own. During the long foreground of the 1830s and ‘40s, Whitman repeatedly turned to apostrophe in order to ensure a sense of presence that, in 1855, would finally become that provocative “you.” It was this literary device, drawn in large part from the period’s sentimental mourning literature, that Whitman would ultimately radicalize and couple with other literary conventions of mourning. In doing so, he would not only lay the groundwork necessary for cultivating those interpersonal connections between speaker and reader that are at the heart of Leaves of Grass, but he would achieve an even more intimate and extra-temporal sense of presence than many of the more conventional mourning objects of the time did. By 1855, Whitman’s investment in nineteenth-century mourning and memorial literature, coupled with his reaction to Poe’s poetry, led him to construct a text that was capable of fostering a remarkable sense of his continuing presence despite space, time, and his own mortality. This sense of continuing presence created a kind of localized intimacy between “Walt Whitman, one of the roughs, a kosmos” and “you” the reader, certainly.48 But the lessons he learned in creating this sense of intimacy would be put to the test on a national scale a decade later, when he sought to heal the wounds of a nation by fostering a similar sense of presence for the “Million Dead” of the Civil War. The fifth chapter, “Embodying the Book: Mourning for the Masses in Walt Whitman’s Drum-Taps” examines how Whitman’s investment in and response to the morbid literature of the period proved crucial for his attempt to heal the nation in the wake of civil war. Drawing on the mourning conventions of the period\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\n16 Communities of Death and the sense of presence he had been able to generate in Leaves of Grass, Whitman produced a rather remarkable, if unconventional book—one whose imagery, typography, even its visual ornaments and binding, sought to create for all readers, Northern or Southern, black or white, a similar sense of the presence of their own lost Civil War soldier. It is a text that thus once again relies upon but also moves beyond conventional mourning rituals and practices (which were overwhelmed and rendered ineffective by the sheer destructiveness of the war), working to assuage grief while preserving and protecting the individual identities of the war’s “Million Dead.” In doing so, this text sought ultimately to heal the wounds of a nation torn asunder by urging the bereaved to recognize that their grief reunited them in what one contemporary famously dubbed a “republic of suffering.”49 In my final chapter, “Aggregating Americans: The Political Immortality of Walt Whitman’s Two Rivulets,” I examine what is arguably the pinnacle of Whitman’s investment in and response to the morbidity of the culture and literature he was exposed to, his nearly forgotten 1876 centennial gift to the nation, Two Rivulets. In many ways, it represents the denouement of Whitman’s literary career. In this volume, Whitman sought to counter the materialism, greed, and social inequity that ailed post-Civil War America by providing the nation with what once more essentially amounts to a memorial album, something which he believed would supply the “chyle and nutriment” that the nation would need in order to enjoy “many a coming centennial.” In this text, Whitman, again borrowing from the literary conventions of mourning culture, recast conventional understandings of death, the afterlife, and the immortal nature of the human soul to suggest that all were destined to share an immortal afterlife, fused together as indistinguishable elements of a divine, cosmic oversoul. It is a vision of the afterlife that mirrors the very one put forward by Poe in the text he claimed was the denouement of his own literary career, “Eureka.” As Whitman said, it was only when American society operated in accordance with such an understanding of the nature of the immortality of Man—an understanding that he and Poe, at least, seemingly shared—that Americans could finally find the affective means to “fuse, tie, and aggregate all” into a truly democratic utopia.50 By acknowledging and investigating the hitherto marginalized connections testified to by Whitman, my book seeks to sustain a kind of literary dialogue between him and Poe that discloses how intimately their projects were bound to each other’s and to the sentimental culture of mourning and memorializ-\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

It is, to be sure, an unexpected dialogue, tinged with perhaps a strange irony in which the Gothic, the transcendent, and the sentimental condition the production and reception of one another in surprising ways. Nevertheless, it is a dialogue that ultimately mirrors the spirit of the only interaction the two writers shared while alive – that time back in 1845 when they met at the offices of Poe’s Broadway Journal and had a conversation that Whitman characterized as “frankly conciliatory.”51 When Whitman, near the end of his life, described this scene to his scribe, Horace Traubel, he likely meant to indicate that he found Poe amiable and pleasant to do business with. But I would like to think that his words might also be a fitting description of the relationship between their otherwise disparate literary works—words which suggest an unsuspected conciliation, a sympathetic and agreeable harmony of literary “souls and sympathies” in need of further investigation.52\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

By all accounts, the play, entitled The Father, or Family Feuds, was enjoyed by those in attendance. Their appreciation was, perhaps, augmented by the Christmas-inspired bliss of families reuniting for the holidays or by the chance to see the family feuds such reunions can create satirized on stage. Applause was plentiful, and the intermission was marked by amiable conversation between Richmond regulars and those who had come for the holidays. The company included not only the usual ladies and their escorts, but also a significant number of young ones as well. The second billing that evening was a pantomime entitled “Raymond and Agnes or the Bleeding Nun.” Moments after the beginning of act two, one of the company’s actors, a Mr. Robertson, stepped out onto the stage waving his hand and crying, “The house is on fire!” Instantly, groups of family and friends leaped from their seats and surged toward the one narrow exit of the theater, while the fire—racing along the resin-covered pine-board roof—engulfed the house in a matter of minutes. 19\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

All rights reserved.\n\n20 Communities of Death When the flames finally subsided early the next morning seventy-two of the six hundred had died.1 Had Eliza Poe, mother of Edgar Allan Poe, still been a member of Mr. Placide’s Theater Company, she would, perhaps, have perished that night in the blaze. Eliza, however, had passed away two weeks earlier, on December 10, 1811, most likely of tuberculosis, and as a result, this event has been seen as one of little to no importance in Poe’s biography. Indeed, Arthur Quinn noted that, “this tragic event could have had little effect on [Edgar]” because he had been taken in within a few days of Mrs. Poe’s death by Mrs. John Allan. Edgar’s sister Rosalie Poe had already been taken in by Mrs. William MacKenzie, and Henry had been sent to live with his grandparents, Elizabeth Cairnes Poe and David Poe, Sr., in Baltimore.2 Both Allan and MacKenzie were of Richmond’s wealthy first families. Edgar was with Mr. and Mrs. Allan at the home of Bowler Cicke, with whom they spent the holidays at his plantation at Turkey Island, and by virtue of this circumstance, Poe and the Allans, in a very real sense, “escaped the fire [and] its aftermath.”3 However, in another sense, the Richmond Theater Fire of 1811 certainly did engulf Edgar, along with the Allans, the MacKenzies, Rosalie, and all the residents of Richmond regardless of their presence at the theater that night. In the face of the staggering losses which occurred there, losses which one New York Times writer would later reflect upon as “appalling at that early day, before railroads and steam-boats or war had accustomed the people . . . to great slaughters,” the city of Richmond was engulfed in the rituals and practices that surrounded the mourning and memorializing of their dead as the entire town “went into mourning.”4 As a respectable first family of Richmond, the Allans would undoubtedly have taken part. At his mother’s death, the orphaned Edgar may have seen her close friends and associates adopt mourning clothing and participate in the rituals and practices surrounding death. But now, after only a few weeks’ introduction into that world of black crepe, hat weeds, long veils, armbands, funerals, burial grounds, and more, Edgar’s entire world would seemingly have turned black. Throughout Richmond, ladies and gentlemen, shopkeepers and artisans, even children and some slaves, donned the markers of grief, attended services for the dead, and actively sought consolation and healing by collectively mourning their losses. Arguably, the community’s process of mourning and memorializing reached its culmination with the construction of the Monumental Episcopal Church, built by the citizens of Richmond on the site where the theater had stood—a church whose construction the Allans aided by purchasing pew\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nInspiring Death 21 number 80. Here, the Allans and Edgar attended services regularly, and their attendance would have been a weekly reminder of the need to honor the dead and the commitment of the community to do so. Proceeding up the front walkway, young Edgar would have had a view of the frieze above the church’s portico, covered in lachrymatories. He might have traced his hand over the names of the dead inscribed on the polished marble monument that dominated the entranceway—dead whose bodies lay buried in the brick crypt below the church. For Edgar, as for any Richmond inhabitant who visited there, to enter the church was to immerse himself in a world of mournful remembrance, ornamented with overturned and extinguished lamps, floriated funeral wreaths, Egyptian-styled winged orbs, and darkened sarcophagi all carved into the interior of the building. As austere and macabre as this might sound now, given the nature of the culture, Edgar’s intimacy with death, mourning, and memorializing was most remarkable for the fact that it was unquestionably so commonplace. Many critics have looked to Edgar’s early introduction to grief as the wellspring from which his later literary works are drawn. However, by focusing largely on the potential psychological impact of his youthful intimacy with death and grief, critics tend to marginalize the fact that these experiences were also an early initiation into a culture saturated with images, rituals, practices, and beliefs surrounding death. This cultural preoccupation with death was so intensely prominent at the time that the ideas and practices central to it were an ever-present fact of life for nearly every American. Poe’s immersion in this culture unquestionably informed the literature he produced. The beliefs and rituals associated with this culture were central to it, influencing not only Poe’s aesthetic philosophy, but also the production and reception of even his most Gothic poems. A nuanced examination of Poe’s relationship to this culture, its rituals and practices, discloses this. It illuminates, among other things, the extent to which Poe’s aesthetic philosophy was drawn, literally and figuratively, from the objects central to this culture. The hair weavings, mourning portraits, mourning quilts, and, most important, the consolation poems were capable of consoling the bereaved by bringing them to an awareness of their supposed immortality and a sense of the glorious existence that awaited them in the afterlife. Poe’s aesthetic philosophy argued that all literature that “deserves its title” should do the same.5 That philosophy, rooted in the aesthetics of the period’s mourning culture, resulted in the production of a unique species of “mourning” poetry. Poetry that, despite being interpreted by modern critics as\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

[they] collected and combined elements of these cosmological systems to create satisfying explanations of death.”7 Such “explanations” were still characteristically Christian, and they mirrored the shift from Puritanism to the more Protestant Arminianism and Evangelicalism that marked nineteenth-century America, focusing less on the putrefaction of the body and fear of damnation, and more on the bliss of a celestial afterlife enjoyed in the presence of family and loved ones. The reconceptualization of death and the afterlife during the time period carried over into rather generalized mourning practices that, in many ways, transcended religious, geographical, and, at times, even racial differences. Mourning portraits, for example, appeared in the parlors of homes from Nashville to Cambridge, and from the Ohio Valley to Long Island.8 Mourning poetry, or consolation verse, was written by black male elites in Philadelphia and by middle-class white women in Dover, Vermont.9 Mourning dress, or some variation of it, was worn by disparate classes and in surprisingly disparate locales.10 Mourning and memorial practices (including establishing rural cemeteries, conducting wakes and funerals, weaving hair, writing consolation verse, painting mourning portraiture, and quilting memorial quilts) became so ubiquitous, and their promise for aiding/and or uniting otherwise disparate religious, economic, and social groups so widely understood, that by the end of the Civil War no less an entity than the federal government had chosen to make use of these practices. In the war’s wake, the government felt it imperative to establish a national cemetery, Arlington, which would serve to both memorialize the country’s dead and bring together otherwise alienated communities, Northern and Southern.11 These practices would not begin to give way until\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nInspiring Death 23 the close of the Reconstruction era—when advances in mortuary science, the emergence of a modern funeral trade, and the rise of modern consumer culture took mourning practices from the home to the funeral parlor, radically reshaping them in the process. Death was ever-present in nineteenth-century America, and people needed these practices as a means to counteract the deleterious effects of grief, for, as one scholar has noted, “there were few families that did not frequently renew acquaintance with the grim reaper. . . . The pall of death was omnipresent.”12 Indeed, mortality figures for the time period are striking. During the antebellum era, for example, “anywhere from 8 to 10 percent of individuals could expect to die before reaching their twenty-first birthday,” and nineteenth-century Americans “commonly witnessed, or knew about, or were exposed to, the death of a relation, friend, acquaintance, or public figure at nearly every stage of life . . . [making death] a common experience.”13 Death, so it seems, was rather remarkable if only for its pervasiveness, and such pervasiveness invited the widespread use of rituals and practices specifically designed to ameliorate the pain of grief and foster successful mourning. Among the many strategies invoked in an attempt to counter their grief, nineteenth-century Americans engaged in the collaborative creation of a wide variety of mourning and memorial objects. The quilts, jewelry, portraiture, photography, hair weavings, and literature commonly produced by either mourners or their friends and associates marked the beds, bodies, walls, and parlors of nineteenth-century America’s populace and its domiciles. Such aids were intended to foster certain recuperative effects for mourners and for the producers of the objects (if not the mourners themselves). For most modern critics of American literature, perhaps the most readily identifiable literary representation of such mourning objects is found in the “crayons” or “tributes” associated with Mark Twain’s Emmeline Grangerford, of Huckleberry Finn fame. Grangerford, who represents an exaggerated parody of the nineteenth-century mourner, found death and mourning such a fashionably social activity that even “the undertaker never got in [the home of the deceased] ahead of Emmeline,” and her saccharine and artless “tributes” made her presence seem more absurd than ameliorative.14 While the parody that is Grangerford probably had more than one real-life correlative, to assume that her activities and attitudes represent the social norm with regard to these practices would be a mistake. In reality the popular mourning aids such as consolation poems, gravestones, and hair-remembrancers served as powerful talismans. As\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\n24 Communities of Death Mary Louise Kete explains, they helped the bereaved by “not only [working] to preserve the memory of their lost [loved ones]” but by creating “a world that would deny that loss . . . prevent[ing] the alienation that the separation of death might otherwise entail.”15 The worlds created to counter loss and alienation were both spiritual and social. Mourners found that the use of objects inspired a sense of the deceased’s ongoing vitality in a realm of transcendent bliss, a “prescience of the glories beyond the grave” to crib from Poe.16 In mourning portraiture and consolation verse, the deceased were frequently depicted enjoying a glorious afterlife which included reunion and continued association with previously departed family and loved ones. These affectively charged images also held out the possibility of a similar reunion for the deceased and the mourner in some future moment. As such, these images and objects offered an emotional balm to the bereaved, reminding them that what appeared to be loss was merely temporary separation. Such objects testified that a sweet communion with loved ones could continue affectively now and materially in the beyond. At the same time, objects like hair clippings and weavings sought to represent the identity of the deceased even in his or her absence, essentially functioning like material synecdoches, or parts that indicated the existence elsewhere of a now glorified individual made whole. As such, these objects also served a memorializing function. Holding a lock of hair or gazing at a mourning portrait, the bereaved could recall the unique individual identity of one they had lost, the object serving to inspire memories of the deceased’s features, mannerisms, and most important, the love they had for the bereaved. These objects thus served mourners in a very personal way, ameliorating their feelings of grief and helping them remember the dead. Moreover, because many of these objects produced in the nineteenth century were either given as gifts or required the participation of more than one individual in order to be created, these objects also addressed “the seemingly local and individual problem of . . . grief by forging closer reciprocal ties among the larger group or the community.”17 Working together to produce a hair weaving or complete a memorial quilt, the interpersonal ties between the bereaved and those in the larger community who assisted were strengthened. Such communal engagement not only testified to the bereaved that she was not alone in her grief, but also prevented her from alienating herself from the community in response to the pain she was experiencing. Thus, by virtue of being collaboratively produced and/or distributed as gifts, these objects helped “allay these feelings” of grief\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nInspiring Death 25 and alienation and served “to rebind the mourner to the community.”18 Mourning and memorial objects became a means for not only countering grief but for testifying to the mourner that they were part of a larger sympathetic community who stood by ready to help, assist, and console. Before moving into a more direct examination of the way in which these objects served to ameliorate grief and strengthen the social fabric of the communities that produced them, a brief word on the terminology associated with these mourning and memorial objects, indeed with the culture of mourning and memorializing more broadly, seems necessary. In general, nineteenth-century Americans thought of mourning as that period following the death of a loved one when a bereaved individual experienced not only intense emotional pain, but also the aforementioned desire to alienate or isolate herself from the community. Memorializing, on the other hand, was the process of securing a means whereby the lost individual could be not only remembered, but also perpetually—if imaginatively—reconnected with. The production of objects intended to assist with both of these functions usually started during the early period of intense mourning, but such objects were frequently completed and even used years after the initial phase of emotional devastation ended—in a memorializing capacity, no less. A blurring between “mourning” and “memorializing” prevents these activities from being concretely distinguished. In general, it is safe to say that much more unites mourning and memorial practices than divides them, which is why throughout this book I tend to favor using the entire phrase mourning and memorializing rather than merely the former or the latter when describing the rituals and practices associated with this culture.19 Seeing the way in which these objects serve to assist in both mourning and memorializing the deceased is easily perceived when one turns to examine the objects themselves. Three examples below (hair, mourning portraits, and memorial quilts) indicate the wide variety of objects that were produced and demonstrate the types of salutary effects that they had for those who created and used them. As such, these objects form a kind of framework within which to understand a mourning poetry (or “consolation verse”) equally committed to producing these types of effects, a poetry and material culture Poe borrowed from when conceptualizing his aesthetic philosophy and which he entered into dialogue with when articulating his own rather death-obsessed body of poetry. It is also within such a cultural framework that those who read such poetry or heard him proclaim such a philosophy would most likely have understood it.\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

All rights reserved.\n\nTranscendent Material/Transcending Materiality The Art of Nineteenth-Century Mourning It is well known that many nineteenth-century individuals turned their bodies into sites serving to mourn their dead. The men’s characteristic black suits and armbands (such as Poe wore after the death of Virginia), and the black dresses and flowing black veils worn by women are immediately recognizable symbols of this culture.20 What is perhaps less well known is that they also used artifacts from the body of the deceased to mourn and memorialize as well; most common were locks of hair. These became a powerful means of representing the departed and, for many, a means of envisioning the deceased in the afterlife. Poe himself participated in such a cultural practice when he clipped locks of Virginia’s hair after her death and kept them bound in a sheaf of paper.21 These locks of hair, while mourning objects in their own right, were frequently used to produce other mourning objects that could be displayed or carried with an individual. Such objects were so widely used that periodicals of the time not only published instructions for at-home hair weaving, but also regularly commented on the efficacy of such objects in aiding the process of mourning and memorializing. An article appearing in Gleason’s Pictorial-Drawing Room in 1853 noted, “We all preserve the hair of deceased or absent friends as a precious memento. . . . We know of . . . mothers who thus wear bracelets of their children’s hair, most ingeniously wrought, and in some instances even, of elaborate necklaces of the same. Children, too, wear the hair of departed parents.”22 Brooches, watch fobs, lockets, chains, hair ornaments, and a wide variety of other similar objects were all produced using the hair of loved ones, and they expressed what this writer called “a very tender and beautiful idea,” one most “interesting and agreeable.”23 Essentially, the plaited “token or keepsake” not only symbolized the character of the intimate interpersonal relationship that the deceased and the mourner enjoyed, it functioned to perpetuate a sense of continued association between the bereaved and the deceased. As another commentator writing in Godey’s Ladies Book in 1860 characterized it, “Hair . . . survives us like love. It is so light, so gentle, so escaping from the idea of death, that, with a lock of hair belonging to a child or friend, we may almost look up to heaven and compare notes with angelic nature—may almost say; ‘I have a piece of thee here, not unworthy of thy being now.’”24 As this writer attests, such clippings and weavings granted the mourner a gauzy view of the “angelic” deceased in the afterlife and simultaneously encouraged the mourner to feel\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nInspiring Death 27 the “love of ” or intimate interpersonal connection to that deceased individual persisting despite death. Thus, these hair clippings and weavings seemed primed not only to aid in the memorializing of departed loved ones, but also to counter the sense of loss and alienation that might otherwise result from the ongoing absence of the beloved deceased. As individuals knotted and wove the hair of their departed loved ones in order to fashion such mourning pieces, they were, in essence, “tying” themselves to their dead. The finished product not only contained or represented something of the identity of the deceased, but something of the skill, ingenuity, and fidelity of the object’s producer as well. No longer just a synecdoche for the departed loved one, the finished hair weaving now represented the bonds of love that tied the living to the dead, and it symbolically foreshadowed a glorious (re)union of mourner and deceased in a shared, immortal afterlife. If an object was produced by someone other than the mourner, it retained its ability to bind together individuals; however, in such a case it would arguably serve to bind together the producer and the mourner at the same time that it allowed the mourner to imagine a connection with the deceased. The “gift” of the mourning piece thus stood as a testament of the willingness of the producer to find ways to aid the mourner through the grieving process. In such a case, the object became a powerful means of reasserting social bonds and counteracting the mourner’s tendency to alienate himself in his grief, while still functioning as a catalyst for imagining the deceased in a glorified state of existence. These talismans or “token[s]” inspired individuals to “look up to heaven,” to feel themselves bound to their loved ones and, in many cases, to a broader sympathetic community as well. Hair was thought to memorialize so effectively that its use became ubiquitous, and it was frequently incorporated into another common mourning object of the time, the mourning picture. The “embroidered and/or painted mourning picture on silk,” paper, or ivory was “a new art form taught at academies for young females [which] flourished” in the first few decades of the nineteenth century before giving way to printed mourning pictures, as well as postmortem portraiture and photography only slightly later.25 These visual mourning aids were, like the hair weavings, “practical” objects in that they were not only intended to be aesthetically pleasing, but they were also regularly “used” to help the bereaved successfully mourn. As one scholar has described it, visual mourning aids such as a “posthumous mourning portrait functioned as an icon for the bereaved; contemplating it was part of the mourning rit-\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\n28 Communities of Death ual.”26 Through these images “the bereaved [had] their dead restored to them as living presences” with “the gap [between the living and the dead] bridged through art.”27 An entry from the diary of Shepard Alonzo Mount, a nineteenth-century portraitist, testifies to this. In 1865 Mount was at Glen Cove on Long Island when his infant granddaughter Camille passed away. Mount made several sketches of her, and approximately a week later presented a mourning portrait of little Camille to the family. His notes are rather telling. He claimed, “All the family seemed surprised and delighted with [the painting,] and to me it was a real joy to have been the instrument in affording so much comfort to all. Joshua and Edna would sit before it for an hour together, and Mr. and Mrs. Searing are in raptures with it. I have framed it and hung it up for all to see and love—for next to the dear babe herself—it is now the idol of the family.”28 For the family, little Camille’s painting certainly functioned as a talismanic icon, as Mount’s language suggests, and contemplating it was unquestionably a type of mourning ritual. Bereaved family members spent hours indulging in the thoughtful “raptures” that it inspired, and the nature of this ritual and the likely substance of the Searings’ thoughts are suggested by the image itself.29 It is a bust portrait that makes use of an interesting contrast of heavenly and earthly references to connect the terrestrial realm and the divine (fig. 1). On the bottom left area of the picture is a grassy knoll upon which sits a golden pocket watch, its hands depicting the time of the child’s birth (approximately nine forty-five).30 The white of the watch face is mirrored in the swirling white clouds that seem to billow up around the center of the portrait. These clouds frame the central image of the piece, a young child “Camille,” whose angelically white baby dress nearly disappears into the skin of her shoulders. It appears the child is being borne away upon fleecy clouds. The artist imagines her simultaneously as infant girl and angelic being, and her depiction suggests that what enraptured her family was not only the painting’s ability to help them remember physical details and personal attributes (the shape of her eyes, the fondness she had for her grandfather’s watch), but also its capacity to inspire them to a greater sense of Camille’s continued existence in the afterlife. The painting even goes so far as to encourage its viewers to imagine that there is room enough for them in such a heavenly realm. The white of the clouds, blending into two edges of the canvas itself, makes the picture appear in some ways unfinished, as if to invite viewers to continue the project that the painter himself has only just\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

Having aided the bereaved to see Camille as a heavenly being, the picture then leaves them to imagine what she might experience and who she yet might “meet” in those as-yet-unarticulated spaces of the canvas. This was the meditation that Camille’s family was likely engaged in as they sat enrapt with image and imagination. Poe also testified to his belief in the power of such objects when he commissioned the painting of a postmortem mourning portrait shortly after the\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

Attribution is unclear, though some have suggested that this portrait might have been painted by Mary Louise Shew, the benefactor of Poe and Virginia while they lived at Fordham cottage and the individual who arranged Virginia’s funeral and purchased her coffin.31 The portrait is a compelling one for several reasons. It would be difficult to surmise, if one did not already know, that this is, in fact, a postmortem portrait. Virginia wears what appears to be a white dress, with a piece of white cloth draping from the neck. Her head is tipped to the right, her eyes half-open; her lips are a light red and are slightly pursed. Her skin is pale although there is a blush to her cheeks, and her hair and eyebrows are brown. The image sits on a plain, dark background. The dress she wears and the white cloth that hangs about her neck actually make up her burial shroud, but in the absence of this information these might just as easily be mistaken for more “celestial” garb. Additionally, the way in which her head is turned, her lips slightly pursed, and her eyes half-opened depicts how her head fell and her eyes and lips relaxed in the moments following her death. However, on canvas—where the artist has refrained from depicting the actual background of her deathbed (thus making it unclear that she is dead\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nInspiring Death 31 and her body reclining)—it might just as easily depict the waking of a divine “Virginia” into a celestial afterlife as it does her repose at death. While the portrait’s history indicates that it was clearly painted postmortem, it seems likely that Poe did not see Virginia in death in this painting. Following her death and at her funeral, he had refused to look on her face, saying that he preferred to remember her living.32 This picture became a treasured object preserved by Poe and “Muddy” for the remainder of their lives, indicating that for Poe, at least, it held the potential to function as a means whereby he could remember Virginia as living or, in a sense, living on. Like hair weavings and paintings, mourning quilts enrapt mourners and bound them to both their deceased and their community. Made to memorialize the death of an individual, a quilt also bound together the various quilters and mourners who gathered in quilting bees and collectively decorated and stitched the larger quilt together. The elaborate patterns, vivid colors, ribbons, piping, and inscriptions that mourners and producers placed on such quilts generated a material object that provided at once physical and spiritual comfort—memorializing the dead, inspiring visions of the deceased and the mourner reuniting in the afterlife, and serving as a physical testament to the willingness of the community to aid the mourner in the process of mourning. The Eliza S. Howell Quilt (1848-1849) is an apt example of this. Its owner articulated, in some detail, the quilt’s most important function: its ability to connect her to the deceased, and to serve as a conduit through which she might imagine and conceptualize a glorious reunion in the afterlife. The central image of the quilt suggests this (fig. 3). Unlike the mourning portrait in which the deceased is depicted visually, here the image represents the mourner, Eliza Howell, in the act of mourning. She sits at a center table that holds her knitting, a manuscript, and a flower-filled urn, which is in itself a powerful symbol of mourning suggesting that from death springs forth new and beautiful life. On the floor are three objects: a basket containing sewing materials, another larger urn also containing flowers, and a tall clock with the time displayed (5:50). The urns and the clock are common markers among mourning portraiture of the period indicating that the pen-and-ink picture probably depicts a mourner in the act of grieving. The fact that the entire scene is encircled with what could be a funeral wreath made of “Rose of Sharon” such as commonly decorated nineteenth-century graves lends credence to such an interpretation. The way in which the woman holds the square and the absence of any needle in her hand seems to indicate that she is contemplating the square as opposed to doing\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014.

At its top, under a spray of drooping vegetation is a verse of New Testament scripture, “John 6.12 / Gather up / the fragments that remain / that nothing be lost.” The fragments the scripture refers to are the fragments of bread left over when Jesus fed the five thousand, but in the context of quilting, the fragments take on additional resonance, though one hardly less sacramental. Album quilts were collaborative productions, made from “gift” squares created and decorated by one’s family and friends. Generally such squares were created in order to “confirm the importance of family and friendship . . . [and] commemorate rites of passage,” death being, perhaps, the most monumental of “passings” frequently commemorated.33 These squares were collected over a\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nInspiring Death 33\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nperiod of time, sewn together, quilted, and bound to form the larger quilt. By gathering up the various squares (the “fragments”), Eliza worked to ensure that she still had access to those loved ones memorialized thereon so that “nothing may be lost.” In addition to the scripture, there are two pieces of verse inscribed on the square. These are written on drawn curtains which frame the seated woman, and they guide Eliza through a mourning process similar to that which the Mounts and Searings experienced as they looked at the picture of Camille.34 The fact that the verse is inscribed on curtains is indicative, as curtains or draperies were a common symbol in the mourning art of the time. Borrowing from theater, the closing of the curtain symbolized the end of the act of life, complementing the other visual and linguistic symbols on the square that testify to the nature of Eliza’s thoughts. It also creates an interesting visual barrier, at once inviting the viewer’s gaze and simultaneously making him aware of the need for discretion. In this way it mirrors the larger modus operandi of the culture in general. Grief was a private affair, yet not one to be carried out in strict isolation. The markers of grief, such as mourning clothing, helped both mourners and community members negotiate this by acting as a constant reminder that interactions between two individuals were being mediated through a veil or curtain of grief and required an appropriate level of discretion. The poems penned on the curtains on either side make obvious the need for exercising such discretion. The first poem, penned on the left curtain, calls up a vision of the absent friend. Entitled “Friendship,” it reads: In Vain—in different paths we tread— And though no more mayest soothe or cheer; Yet we have those hours of friendship shed, A sweetness that still lingers here; Thy form & look, in memory’s glass, I still distinctly see; Thy voice and words, in fancy’s ear Are whispering still to me. Having called up “in memory’s glass” (which in this case is both the imagination and the quilt—for both make the absent “visible”) the physical “form” and affectionate “look” of those she can no longer see, Eliza then moves to conceptualize a shared afterlife in “Eternity”—the second piece of verse. It reads:\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\n34 Communities of Death\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press. All rights reserved.\n\nWhen the dream of life is fled, When its wasted lamp is dead, When in cold oblivion’s shade, Beauty, power, wealth are laid; Where immortal spirits reign, There may be all we meet again; On the tree of life eternal Man, let all the hope be staid Which alone, for ever vernal, Bears a leaf that shall not fade. Through its verses, the quilt articulates and materializes Eliza’s mourning process, which begins with her remembering the deceased and ends with her imagining herself bound to them in a new realm where “immortal spirits reign” and where the “tree of life” offers a kind of “shade” that covers all and gives them “hope” for continued existence and association in the afterlife.35 While the quilt functions as a means of collecting and imagining a spiritual community of now-immortalized loved ones, it also binds together the more “worldly” community which produced the squares that constitute the larger quilt. Squares usually bear the signatures of their creators, and so the quilt binds mourner with producer and with the dead. In a continuation of this same type of constitutive activity, the individuals who may have gathered together in a quilting bee are themselves bound into the social and material fabric of the mourning enterprise as they join together and in their own characteristic hands stitch and bind the collected pieces of the final object. Thus, on multiple levels, such an object worked to counter the sense of alienation and separation that death, it was feared, threatened to inspire. The quilt’s power to bind together the mourner, the dead, and the larger community did not cease when the object itself was complete, for such quilts were then put into use. The symbols appliquéd, drawn, stenciled, or embroidered continuously directed the thoughts of the user toward the afterlife, and the verses, memorials, and prayers inscribed thereon were perhaps echoed by those that came from the lips of the individual who nightly wrapped him- or herself in it. This combination of image, text, ideology, and materiality warmed individuals against the coldness of grief by wrapping them in memories of the departed, in thoughts of the afterlife, and in assurances that they were not alone in their pain. Thus, in their materiality, their aesthetic design, and their mode\n\nCommunities of Death : Whitman, Poe, and the American Culture of Mourning, University of Missouri Press, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. University of Missouri Press.

As one might guess from the verse presented on Eliza Howell’s quilt, the writing (and circulation) of poetry was an important part of the nineteenth-century’s culture of mourning and memorializing. Inscribed on paper, quilts, headstones, urns, memorial samplers, mourning pictures, and more, poetry became a valuable means of inspiring individuals to imagine the splendors of the afterlife that they and their deceased might someday enjoy together. Given the ubiquity of such poetry, it is perhaps no wonder that throughout the nineteenth century, mourning poetry was not only written and exchanged by mourners and sympathetic friends, but was also widely published, printed, and circulated by otherwise professional writers, such as Lydia Huntley Sigourney, the “Sweet Singer of Hartford.” The wide circulation of Sigourney’s work is a testament to the appeal of such poetry throughout the early and middle decades of the century. Consolation verse, perhaps the most common type of mourning poetry produced at the time, was a significant part of Sigourney’s oeuvre; she wrote and published it frequently, producing volumes such as “The Weeping Willow” (1847) which were designed “for those who mourn . . . loving them better because they have wept, pointing through the shade of the willow boughs . . . and breathing a prayer that ‘this light affliction, which is but for a moment, may work out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.’”36 Sigourney’s conceptualization of her consolation poetry as a mourning aid capable of inspiring a reader to see “through the shade” of grief and death to the “glory” that lies beyond indicates that it was intended to work in the same way as other material objects integral to the culture of mourning and memorializing,"
