Argentina's currency is called the Argentine peso (ARS). The currency has undergone a lot of changes until the introduction of the current peso in 1992 which replaced the then-existing currency, the austral. The Argentine peso had all the existing banknotes replaced in 2002 when the fixed exchange rate system was deserted. Banknotes introduced in 1992 were in the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. Later three more denominations of 200, 500 and 1000 were added. New notes were issued for 20, 50, 100 pesos, and only the 1-peso note was replaced by a coin.
