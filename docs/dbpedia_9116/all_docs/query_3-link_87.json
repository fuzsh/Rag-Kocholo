One of those measures includes devaluing the peso by more than 50%.\n\nIn the video above, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman explains why Argentina is making such drastic economic changes.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nSEANA SMITH: Argentina's peso plunging in value relative to the dollar this week. It's in relation to some shock measures implemented by Argentina's new presidential administration in an effort to get the country's long-floundering economy back on track. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman is here with a closer look. Hey, Julie.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Hey, there, Seana. Well, Argentina's new economic policy can best be summed up with a chainsaw, seriously. Now, President Javier Milei wielded the power tool on the campaign trail to illustrate his plan to fix Argentina's staggering economic woes, that is cuts, cuts, and cuts. In his first full week in office, Milei's administration unveiled some of those policies, among them, slashing energy subsidies, halving the number of ministries, and devaluing the Argentine peso by more than 50%, that last move sending the currency tumbling against the dollar.\n\nI mean, this move is very dramatic. So it's now 800 Argentine peso to $1, a very dramatic move, among a host of dramatic moves. All of this as the government is up against some pretty staggering numbers.\n\nArgentina's inflation up 12.8% in November, that's month over month, year over year, 160% higher. How did things get so bad? Put simply, for decades, the Argentinian government spent like crazy, and the Central Bank printed money to finance the resulting debts, devaluing the peso in the process and driving up inflation.\n\nIt's that out-of-control government spending that Milei aims to tackle with his blunt spending cuts. But those policies take time to have an impact. And importantly, in the short term, Argentinians will feel the pain, that pain, by the way, torpedoed past efforts by past presidents, like Mauricio Macri, to make cuts.\n\nBut analysts say this time, Milei and his team have better communicated what's to come. That doesn't mean, though, that the people are going to be happy with it. Reduced government subsidies still mean higher costs for utilities and public transit.\n\nImport costs will soar as well, thanks to that devalued peso. A brutal drought earlier this year also took a toll on the economy's crucial farming sector, contributing to a 4.9% contraction of the nation's GDP in the second quarter. And the annual inflation rate could likely get even worse before it gets better. JP Morgan out with a note yesterday, projecting inflation to hit 210% by year end, and then stay elevated through the next year, guys.\n\nBRAD SMITH: So a lot of people might be wondering, Julie, why does this matter to US investors?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, it matters to the global economy. And a lot of folks I spoke to about Argentina said, it matters because it's a fascinating experiment here in Latin America, a really important and interesting region, where this is not the only country that has this problem. I emailed with Ian Bremmer, of course, of Eurasia.\n\nHe called this a laboratory for market reform. And it's going to be really interesting. He says, if Milei fails, the default could be more difficult to out than past restructurings and could also have a ripple effect throughout the region. I also talked to Peter Boockvar, another well-followed market strategist.\n\nHe called what's going on one of the most exciting and interesting economic and political experiments and stories to come around in a long time. So there's a lot at stake for Argentina, but also as potentially a model for the region. There is some cautious optimism here, but there are a lot of questions about whether it's going to work because it's going to be very difficult for everyday Argentinians to get through this period, guys."
