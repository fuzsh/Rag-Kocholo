        "text": "Exchange Rate in Argentina\n\nArgentina's exchange rate from 2013 to 2022 was marked by significant depreciation of the Argentine peso against major currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. Driven by economic instability, high inflation, and fiscal deficits, the peso's value eroded continuously. Government interventions, including currency controls and debt restructuring, provided temporary relief but could not stem the long-term decline. By 2022, the peso had reached historic lows, reflecting persistent economic challenges and lack of investor confidence.\n\nThe exchange rate ended 2022 at ARS 177.1 per USD, compared to the end-2021 value of ARS 102.7 per USD and the figure a decade earlier of ARS 6.5 per USD in Argentina.
