        "text": "Updated July 2024\n\nWhen I first arrived in Argentina in 2010, a peso could get a medialuna (my personal fatty benchmark for inflation).\n\nToday you‚Äôll need 500, minimum, for one buttery treat.\n\nTo say money in Argentina is complicated would be putting it mildly.\n\nInflation in Argentina is at an all time high right now and this level of economic volatility isn‚Äôt something that most North Americans or Europeans are used to.\n\nThere are times when travel to Argentina is very expensive and other times that it is very affordable for those coming from the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nRight now, in 2024 with Milei as the new president it seems that the country will be shifting away from being the ‚Äúbargain basement destination‚Äù many foreigners have grown accustomed to in recent years.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, keep reading to find out.\n\nThis article includes everything you need to know about travel and money in Argentina.\n\nYou‚Äôll find this article useful whether you‚Äôre here on holiday or plan on living in Buenos Aires.\n\nWhat is the dollar blue and does it still exist? Where to exchange money in Buenos Aires and get the best rate?\n\nCurrency in Argentina: The Peso vs. The Dollar\n\nThe official currency in Argentina is the Argentinian Peso.\n\nIt‚Äôs often denoted also with the same sign as the dollar, $, which is differentiated as U$100 vs $100 [Pesos].\n\nAnd while the peso is the official currency here, Argentines have always maintained an ongoing love affair with the US dollar.\n\nA volatile economy pushes many to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in US dollars as a way to keep their savings stable and safe from inflation.\n\nThis puts an unhealthy and unnatural demand on foreign currency and depreciates the peso.\n\nMany presidents, including the previous President Fernandez, put very strict currency controls in place, such as freezing the official value of the peso at a very artificial rate.\n\nTo be redundant, the official value of the peso was not free floating with the market.\n\nAlso, the government limited how many USD Argentina citizens could purchase from the bank each month.\n\nThe demand for dollars and the restrictions limiting access to them creates a parallel exchange rate, referred to as the blue dollar.\n\nAnd this blue dollar will also exist, even if the official rate is not controlled.\n\nWhy? This is Argentina, and there will always be a market for undeclared and ‚Äúnon-taxed‚Äù money.\n\nIt is what it is, I already said it‚Äôs complicated.\n\nüí∏TLDR: This article is pretty detailed, but if you just want to know how to get cash in Argentina CLICK HERE to jump to is.\n\nMilei & The Big Devaluation: What does it mean?\n\nOn December 10, 2023 Javier Milei took office as the new president of Argentina after running on a platform of extreme monetary policy changes.\n\nHis main promise was to dollarize the economy and virtually throw the peso into the garbage.\n\nThat hasn‚Äôt happened yet and if it does happen, it will take some years to create the conditions to even be able to consider it as a possibility.\n\nOne of Milei‚Äôs first actions after he took in office was to devalue the official currency from 366 pesos to 800 pesos to the dollar.\n\nIf you live in Argentina, you‚Äôre living the reality of prices increasing every single day.\n\nIf you‚Äôre coming on vacation, it will also affect you but differently, and not as hard as it is affecting locals trying to get to the end of the month.\n\nRead Next: A Guide to Tipping in Argentina\n\nHow does this affect me as a tourist to Argentina?\n\nIf the currency just devalued, shouldn‚Äôt things be cheaper!?\n\nThis is a question I get a lot but in reality, prices are increasing daily here.\n\nIf you‚Äôre renting a car, gas prices have increased quadruple from just a few months ago, going from around 25-30 cents a liter to over a dollar a liter.\n\nRestaurants have been increasing their prices as the prices of their ingredients (even beef) go up, etc.\n\nHotels and tours priced in dollars were always expensive and now the gap between the official and blue dollars has narrowed such that you can‚Äôt bring that price down with the blue dollar spread anymore as you could in the past few years.\n\nSo, expect things to get more expensive, but by how much?\n\nWe‚Äôll have to wait and see.\n\nAs of July 2024, prices are continuing to rise but the dolar blue rate is also finally rising on par with prices, making things more affordable to visitors coming with foreign currency.\n\nSo Argentina is still affordable for those coming from North America and Europe, especially for items like a nice steak dinner or that leather jacket of your dreams.\n\nHowever, you‚Äôll be surprising by prices in the supermarkets and other practical matters. It is no longer the bargain basement backpacker destination digital nomads fell in love with in 2023.\n\nSo, What is the current exchange rate?\n\nFirst, click here check the current exchange rates (official, blue, and MEP).\n\nIn Argentina, there are a lot of exchange rates, it can be dizzying even for locals.\n\nIgnore all of the rates you see except for:\n\nDolar oficial ‚Äì The official exchange rate, this is the rate set by the national bank.\n\nDolar blue ‚Äì The parallel unofficial exchange rate that exists due to currency controls on the official rate. This is the most free market dollar based on demand, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù dollar according to most locals.\n\nDolar MEP (Visa & MC) ‚Äì The dolar MEP is similar to the blue rate in value, at the moment if you use a foreign (not Argentine) Visa or Mastercard in Argentina, you will be charged close to this rate, confirm exact rate here.\n\nCCL ‚Äì This is the rate Western Union uses as a reference\n\nIf you‚Äôve done any minimal research into your trip to Argentina, you‚Äôve likely heard of the blue dollar.\n\nThe ‚Äúdolar blue‚Äù is the unofficial exchange rate that runs parallel to the official rate.\n\nAt the time of updating this (July 2024) the spread between the two rates is roughly $1400 pesos to the dollar at the official rate versus hovering around $900 pesos to the blue dollar.\n\nAt times the MEP and CCL surpass the blue, making credit cards and Western Union the best rates. Other times, the blue takes the lead. It varies but the difference can be minimal or great, check the rates regularly.\n\nHow to Get Cash & Exchange Money in Argentina\n\nTime to get down to it, how do you access cash in Argentina and get the most favorable exchange rate?\n\nI‚Äôll start with the most recommended methods and work my way down to the less desirable options.\n\nWestern Union in Argentina\n\nAn easy way to access a near blue dollar rate in Buenos Aires and other major cities in Argentina is via Western Union.\n\nThis is ideal because they not only offer one of the best rates, but it‚Äôs also a service you‚Äôre likely already familiar with and can trust.\n\nWU offers a rate that hovers around the blue rate (using the Contado Con Liqui rate as a reference), sometimes higher, sometimes lower.\n\nQuick Western Union Tips\n\nAlways put your FULL name as it appears on your ID/Passport, don‚Äôt leave your middle name out if it‚Äôs on your ID.\n\nBring your passport to pick up your WU transfer, small cities may ask you to bring your own photocopy.\n\nThis is not typically an exchange house for exchanging money in person.\n\nYou will wire yourself money using a credit card, debit card, or bank account. Check with your credit card about possible fees from the end.\n\nDebit and credit card wires tend to be immediate. Bank transfers can take 4-5 business days.\n\nWestern Union in Small Cities\n\nSmaller cities, like El Calafate or Puerto Iguazu, have WU locations but have limits set at under the equivalent of $200 US.\n\nTo answer a frequently asked question, no.\n\nYou cannot send yourself a big transfer and pick up just a fraction of it (getting the rest later).\n\nAlso, these smaller cities often have a lot of demand meaning long lines and low reserves.\n\nSometimes it‚Äôs better in this smaller cities to cash out at the end of the day, banking on (pun intended) them having received a lot of payments throughout the day.\n\nEven better, though, is to have cash in these places to avoid the lines and exchange in cuevas, more on that later.\n\nOr, if you‚Äôll be in Buenos Aires first, do a large transaction there and bring your pesos with you.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt to say you won‚Äôt be able to use WU outside of Buenos Aires, far from it.\n\nBut if you‚Äôre only in these destinations for a short time, I‚Äôd hate for you to waste a couple hours of that precious time in a Western Union line or have a hard time getting the cash if they‚Äôre out.\n\nCash Tip: Get a Money Belt\n\nWith the largest bill ($2000) being worth two dollars (April 2024) it‚Äôs inevitable that you‚Äôll always have a lot of cash on you.\n\nIt‚Äôs a good idea to bring a money belt to keep your stack of cash safe.\n\nClassic Money Belt | This money belt is the most common way to safely keep your money tucked away when you‚Äôre out and about in the city. You can also keep your passport safe for when you need to bring it to Western Union (other than for this purpose, I recommend never taking your passport out of the hotel with you!).\n\nTSA Approved Lock | It‚Äôs always a good idea to have a lock on your suitcase. If you will have a lot of cash in your suitcase when you leave your belongings at the hotel and hostel, lock it up. Most hotels will have a safe, use that. If it doesn‚Äôt, put your valuables/cash in your suitcase and lock it.\n\nMoney/Passport Scarf | This infinity scarf is a great alternative and it‚Äôs a lot easier to access your cash than from the belt under your shirt.\n\nMoney Bra Clip | This one is for the ladies and it doesn‚Äôt seem very comfortable but can be practical if the classic money belt doesn‚Äôt work for you.\n\nCuevas\n\nCuevas (or caves) are the name for unofficial currency exchange houses.\n\nYou will find them all over Argentina.\n\nTo discover a trustworthy cueva, I recommend asking your hotel, Airbnb hosts, or tour guides.\n\nAnyone hyper-local to where you‚Äôll be is ideal.\n\nAnd you never know, maybe they themselves will end up exchanging money with you, eliminating the need for a cueva completely.\n\nI recommend always having some crisp, green USD on hand, just in case.\n\nEven if you‚Äôre relying mainly on Western Union, you‚Äôll be grateful to have physical cash to exchange if you find yourself in a pinch in a tiny town miles from a WU office.\n\nIMPORTANT: In Argentina, it‚Äôs not just dollars that matter but the quality of the dollars. They want crisp, unmarked, untorn one hundred dollar bills. Even better if they‚Äôre the new ‚Äúbig head‚Äù design. Don‚Äôt ask, even I don‚Äôt understand it 13 years later.\n\nWhere to Exchange Money in Ezeiza International Airport\n\nIf you need cash the second you land, you do have a couple options in the Buenos Aires airport.\n\nThere is a Banco La Nacion office in the airport.\n\nUse them in a limited manner as you‚Äôll receive the official rate.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is to have your airport transfer reserved ahead of time.\n\nThis way you avoid the hassle of lines at the taxi booths and can benefit from their other services, as many can take you somewhere trustworthy to exchange dollars first thing.\n\nOtherwise, the taxi booths in the airport do accept credit cards. I‚Äôd pay with a Visa or Mastercard, they have a favorable rate.\n\nWorry about getting more cash once you‚Äôre in the city and rested from your travels.\n\nArbolitos & Calle Florida: Buenos Aires Currency Exchange\n\nCalle Florida is located in downtown Buenos Aires.\n\nThis pedestrian street is always busy, lined with shops and cafes.\n\nIt‚Äôs also bustling with unofficial currency exchange representatives called Arbolitos, or little trees.\n\nThe name comes from the green dollars, aka leaves, that they specialize in.\n\nExchanging money in Buenos Aires with these arbolitos is very common and many readers comment on doing this with no trouble at all.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs not my preferred method.\n\nYou‚Äôll follow your arbolito to their cueva and have to trust that you‚Äôre not being given counterfeit notes or that they‚Äôre not alerting a buddy outside to rob you as you head back out, pockets full of pesos.\n\nIf you go the arbolito route, start with a small amount and go from there.\n\nIf they prove trustworthy you can always go back again for more.\n\nThe benefit to Calle Florida, though, is being able to negotiate your rate.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt like what one arbolito offers, you can saunter on to the next guy and push for more.\n\nVisa & Mastercard Rates: Using Debit & Credit Cards in Argentina\n\nUntil late 2022, it was not recommended to use your foreign credit card in Argentina as you would be charged the official rate.\n\nThis is still HALF true.\n\nThe previous government started a new initiative in late 2022 with Visa and Mastercard where you will be charged near the MEP rate if you use a foreign Visa or MC (who use the MEP rate as a reference).\n\nConfirm with the Visa exchange rate calculator to see the rate of the day. Put it in 1 ARS to 1 USD (not the other way around).\n\nThis is a major relief to those not wanting to bring thousands of dollars in their carry on.\n\nI do still recommend using cash for small operations as Argentina‚Äôs economy is very much cash driven and the blue dollar rate (exchanging dollars in a cueva) is always the most advantageous.\n\nYou will often get discounts by paying in cash or small businesses may not be able to charge a card.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED CC QUESTIONS\n\nYou can check the Visa rate to confirm it‚Äôs giving the MEP rate by checking their currency exchange calculator here. Make sure to put ARS to USD (not the other way around).\n\nThis is for all foreign cards worldwide as long as they are Visa & Mastercard\n\nReaders report debit cards offer the same advantageous rate in ATM‚Äôs, I haven‚Äôt tried it yet.\n\nThis will work when in Argentina, I‚Äôve seen reports of people purchasing online flights on an Argentine site from abroad and it works. Do not just use Travelocity (as an example) and convert it to pesos, you‚Äôll still be charged in dollars.\n\nAs of March 2024, to avoid fraud, restaurants are now legally required to charge your credit card at your table, no longer being allowed to take your card to the back of house out of sight. They are being given some months to bring their systems into compliance but you are within your rights to request they bring the POSTNET machine to you.\n\nThere is a law on the books that requires businesses to accept debit cards for purchases that surpass 100 pesos.\n\nHowever, if they accept payment via QR code they are exempt from the requirement.\n\nBy QR code in Argentina typically means via the app MercadoPago (similar to PayPal).\n\nUnfortunately for tourists, you need a local DNI ID card to create a MercadoPago account.\n\nSo, as I said above, always carry cash on hand, just in case.\n\nATMs in Argentina\n\nIf you use an ATM to pull out money in Argentina (Visa or MC), readers report receiving the MEP rate.\n\nBut still, I‚Äôd avoid using ATM‚Äôs to get pesos unless you have a bank that refunds ATM fees.\n\nThe limit on the amount of cash you can get out is also extremely low per day with very high bank fees (averaging U$10 per transaction).\n\nWhen you absolutely must use ATMs here or abroad, I recommend using a bank like Charles Schwab that refunds any foreign ATM fees otherwise it will add up very quickly.\n\nTips for Exchanging Money in Argentina\n\nSo now you know what you need (cash) and how to get it.\n\nHere are some local tips to get even more bang for your buck.\n\nBring only 100 dollar bills that are crisp and unmarked. I always go inside my bank in the US and pull cash out with a teller then review every single bill, asking for any bills that are damaged or written on to be exchanged. Yes, this makes me feel suspicious.\n\nWhy? You will either get a lower rate or flat out rejected if you try to exchange 10s, 20s, or 50s. Many also reject or offer less for damaged/written on bills.\n\nIf using an ATM, LINK ATMs tend to have smaller fees than other chains like Banelco. Look for the LINK sticker on the bank windows.\n\nBring a credit card that returns ATM fees since fees here are so damn high, like Charles Schwab.\n\nTry to not exchange too much excess cash as getting dollars back for those pesos at the end of your trip will likely get you a low, official rate. Instead, if you get stuck with extra cash, spend those pesos!\n\nKeep small change on hand and break large bills whenever possible. Many smaller merchants lack change or have unreasonable anxiety around breaking large bills for a small purchase.\n\nTax Free Shopping in Argentina\n\nForeign tourists are entitled to a refund of the VAT tax spent on purchases of domestically-manufactured goods with a value over ARS $70 when made at participating outlets that belong to Global Blue Argentina.\n\nWhen shopping for authentic Argentine souvenirs, look for the Global Blue Argentina sign at the register or simply ask when you‚Äôre paying if the purchase is eligible.\n\nKeep your receipts and tax free forms given at time of purchase or you won‚Äôt be able to claim the refund.\n\nFor information on where and how to receive your refund, click here.\n\nRead more about Argentina"
