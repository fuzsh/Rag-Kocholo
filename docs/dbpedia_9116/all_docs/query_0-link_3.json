        "text": "If you go to Argentina you'll use the Argentine peso, the official Argentine currency, for all your transactions. Whether it's about the form that currency in Argentina takes (coins and banknotes) or how it is used (payment methods, withdrawals, exchanges), properly educating yourself about these things ensures a worry-free trip. In this guide, you'll learn everything you need to know about currency in Argentina so that you can travel with complete confidence.\n\nWhat is the official currency in Argentina?\n\nThe official currency of Argentina is the convertible Argentine peso, which is issued by the country's central bank â the Banco Central de la RepÃºblica Argentina:\n\nIts symbol is \"$\" or \"$Ar,\"\n\nIts abbreviation is ARS (new Argentine peso),\n\n1 euro is worth around 928.6 pesos,\n\nEach peso can be divided into 100 centavos (cents).\n\nCheck the latest euro-Argentine peso conversion rate.\n\nWhat are the coins and banknotes in Argentine currency?\n\nArgentine currency consists of various coins and banknotes, ranging from 5 centavos to 2000 Argentine pesos:\n\nArgentine coins: 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and 1, 2, 5 and 10 pesos.\n\nArgentine banknotes: 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 pesos.\n\nSend money to Argentina with Western Union\n\nWith Western Union, you can send money to Argentina in just a few clicks at a great rate.\n\nHow can you pay in Argentina?\n\nThere are two main means of payment in Argentina: cash and bank card (debit or credit). Because the economic situation in the country is sometimes unstable, where possible it's better to make everyday purchases in cash, the simplest means of payment, and to pay by bank card in tourist areas. Let's go over the details of these different payment methods:\n\nCash: The vast majority of payments in Argentina are made in cash, and this is the easiest and most convenient means of payment, especially outside major cities. What's more, paying for your purchases with Argentine currency sometimes means you can get discounts, especially if you haggle.\n\nBank card (credit or debit): Payment by bank card is widely accepted in major cities and tourist areas, making it a very convenient payment method. However, paying by bank card is not recommended for everyday transactions â each one will be charged at the official low rate of the Argentine currency, and there'll be a bank fee and, often, a supplement of 5% to 15% (called \"recargo\"). Some businesses also refuse foreign cards, and connecting to the bank terminal can be difficult.\n\nSo, to avoid accumulating fees and charges and to stick to your budget, it's better to pay as often as possible in Argentine currency and only use a bank card for large expenses with major chains.\n\nCan you pay in euro in Argentina?\n\nYes, you can pay in euro in Argentina, particularly at hotels, if you don't have any Argentine currency. However, if you don't have Argentine pesos, it's better to pay in dollars. A lot of stores accept them in major cities and you'll get a better exchange rate than for the euro. While it may be beneficial to keep euro banknotes with you, it's always best to pay in Argentine pesos (or dollars if need be) to avoid an overly unfavorable exchange rate.\n\nWhere can you exchange money in Argentina?\n\nDue to new government rules, it's recommended to exchange your money in Argentina at a foreign exchange counter, or at a Western Union agent location, which are the only authorized places for exchanging euro to Argentine currency. There is also a very popular alternative foreign exchange market that allows you to get Argentine pesos at a better rate known as the \"blue rate.\" To combat currency deregulation in Argentina, only foreign exchange companies such as Western Union are authorized to exchange banknotes. As a result, banks are now refusing to exchange money for individuals who are not customers. However, don't change your money at the airport, as the rates can be very unfavorable. You can also change your euro to Argentine currency before your trip by contacting your bank. However, pay attention to the rate offered and the delivery times. As a general rule, do not exchange all your euro at the same time. Argentine currency fluctuates enormously, so it's best to exchange your money as and when you need to, and take advantage of a more favorable rate.\n\nWhat is the blue rate in Argentina?\n\nThe blue rate is the unofficial exchange rate for the Argentine peso for exchanges made on the street through a street exchanger (known as an \"arbolito\"). Although considered illegal, the Argentine blue rate is widely used by locals and tourists alike to exchange euro or dollars, often at a better rate. However, to stay within the law and get the best rates, you can exchange your money with Western Union. We offer rates close to the blue rate, giving you greater security and a simpler exchange. In addition, with Western Union, you can easily transfer Argentine currency using your phone once you're there, and quickly pick up your money at one of our agent locations.\n\nWhere can you withdraw money in Argentina?\n\nYou can withdraw money in Argentina at one of the large number of ATMs in major cities. However, withdrawing money isn't recommended because withdrawals are capped, the rate is quite unfavorable, fees are high and the ATMs often run out of currency. If you need to withdraw money in Argentina, go to counters inside banks to avoid the risk of theft. If you're going outside of big cities, plan ahead and withdraw money beforehand, as there may not be ATMs in small towns. You can also withdraw money at Western Union locations in major Argentine cities and enjoy the best exchange rate. [There is no specific url for agent locations in Argentina, should we keep this link to agent locations?] Finally, as for withdrawals of currency in Brazil or currency in Colombia, let your bank know about your trip so that you can freely use your bank card (for physical or online payments) without risking it being blocked.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the Argentine peso exchange rate? The Argentine peso exchange rate is approximately:\n\n1 euro = 928.6 Argentine pesos,\n\n1 Argentine peso = 0.001 euro\n\nEasily convert EUR to ARS with Western Union, whatever the amount. How can I send money to Argentina? With Western Union, easily send money to Argentina from France:\n\nOnline in a few clicks via our website,\n\nWith our mobile app,\n\nIn person, by going to an agent location.\n\nYour receiver can get the money in cash, in their account (via their Argentine IBAN) or in their mobile wallet."
