        "text": "*This article was last updated in March 2024.\n\nSo you're interested in spending some time in Argentina, learning Spanish and experiencing a new culture? Firstly, congratulations! We've already written about the top reasons we think Buenos Aires is a great place to live and study Spanish. The Argentine capital is full of energy, culture, history and charm and these days you can spend a good deal of time there without breaking the bank.\n\nThose who come to travel or study in Argentina will find their dollars or euros go a long way. This is in large part due to changing in the exchange rate. In March 2020, one US dollar was worth around 60 pesos – four years later it’s around 850 pesos. But there’s even more to it than this. Argentina’s unofficial exchange rate – known locally as the ‘dólar blue’ – currently stands at around 1,000 pesos to the dollar, meaning it's possible to make your money go even further (see below for some tips on how to benefit from this rate and more).\n\nIs Buenos Aires Cheap for Students?\n\nThough inflation has been running high for a while, recent currency devaluations means that Buenos Aires remains really affordable for international students and digital nomads. According to cost of living comparison site, Numbeo, as of March 2024 consumer prices in Buenos Aires (including rent) are:\n\n80% cheaper than New York City\n\n74% cheaper than Los Angeles\n\n74% cheaper than London\n\n73% cheaper than Miami\n\n28% cheaper than Sao Paulo (Brazil)\n\nAs you can see, the cost of living in Buenos Aires remains very low, not just compared to major US and European cities but even other large South American cities. It's no wonder then that the Argentine capital has become so popular among travelers, students and remote workers. In fact, according to Nomad List, Buenos Aires is the best city in South America for digital nomads (and 2nd in the whole world) due to its good infrastructure, affordability, friendly people and rich cultural offerings."
