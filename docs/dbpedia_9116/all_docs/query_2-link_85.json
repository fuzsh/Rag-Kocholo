        "text": "Argentina will devalue the peso through its official exchange rate by more than 50% against the U.S. dollar, the country’s economy minister announced late Tuesday, as the new government of Javier Milei begins a raft of ambitious reforms.\n\nThe official exchange rate will see the peso valued at 800 per dollar, up from 391—a 54% devaluation—Economy Minister Luis Caputo said. Caputo also announced other economic initiatives days into the presidency of Milei, including cutting energy subsidies and canceling tenders of public work—part of a raft of efforts to tame chaos in Argentina’s economy including triple-digit inflation.\n\n“The move comes two days after libertarian Javier Milei was sworn in as president amid a package of measures that also includes major spending cuts,” noted Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. “This brings the total devaluation of the peso to 78% year-to-date, and moves it closer to the unofficial blue dollar exchange rate which has been at about 1000 recently.”"
