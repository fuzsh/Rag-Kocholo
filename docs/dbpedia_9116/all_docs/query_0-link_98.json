        "text": "SAO PAULO (ICIS)–The new Argentinian government’s peso devaluation in December came too early and was too deep, not helping reduce the gap between the official peso rate the unofficial ‘blue dollar’ and probably fueling inflation further, according to the director at Buenos Aires-headquartered Fundacion Capital.\n\nCarlos Perez added the sharp devaluation implemented by Javier Milei’s new government soon after taking office in December could have been implemented in phases, without the need to put an even larger strain in an already beleaguered high-inflation economy.\n\nThe sharp devaluation in Argentina’s exchange rate quickly filtered down to the real economy, with the annual rate of inflation jumping from November’s 161% to December’s 211%.\n\nPerez’s view is that if the government had waited slightly longer to go for an all-out peso devaluation, companies could have had more time to adapt by not having to pass onto customers sharp price rises.\n\nBy using the official exchange rate for some transactions, they would have been somehow shielded from the sharp price rises already posted in December and which are set to worsen.\n\nWhen Milei took office, the official Argentinian peso (Ps) exchange rate to the dollar stood at $1:Ps350. Economists had speculated with a devaluation to bring the rate to around $1:Ps600.\n\nMilei went deeper and devaluated the currency to $1:Ps825.\n\nThese moves would go in parallel to keeping the unofficial, ‘blue dollar’ exchange rate as close to the official rate as possible.\n\nIn November, with markets waiting for Milei to take office, the ‘blue dollar’ gained some strength – from having traded at $1:Ps1,000 and below during the electoral campaign, the ‘blue dollar’ went up to around $1:Ps900.\n\nBut the sharp devaluation of the peso in December just sent the blue dollar to a record low of $1:Ps1,200, where it currently stills sits.\n\nThis will be the dominant note during the first half of 2024, according to Perez: ever higher prices and a “profound recession” as salaries are set to greatly fall behind in terms of purchasing power, causing a sharp fall in demand and higher unemployment.\n\n“The devaluation has caused the same effect than the previous devaluation [in August under the previous government]: a rapid increase in inflation. The difference between then and now is that the previous government was an outgoing Administration without credibility,” said Perez.\n\n“The latest devaluation, done by a new government which is also aiming for a fiscal adjustment and has the legitimacy given by the election, should have had a different effect. But by going deep and fast, they have burnt quite a few bullets with the move.”\n\nThe government, said Perez, may still succeed with the fiscal adjustment, and the economy may start in the second half of 2024 to show sign of revival, but for the first half nothing but a “very important economic recession” is expected.\n\n“It will be very difficult for Argentinian salaries to keep up with the increases in inflation and, therefore, there will be a very significant drop in real salaries, and that will undoubtedly hit economic activity very hard,” said Perez.\n\n“Many people will suffer a tough first half of the year. Of course, it will not be the same for someone who was already close to the precipice than for someone who was managing relatively well. But clearly, we are all going to be worse off. However, if that’s the scenario for H1 but allows to see a light at the end of the tunnel, I think it would be digestible – it will be painful, but digestible.”\n\n– Question: Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? In other words, does Argentina have a solution?\n\n– Answer: We will have to see… It is undoubtedly a challenge.\n\nThe economy officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2023, after a second consecutive contraction in quarterly GDP. Two consecutive quarters with negative growth constitute a recession.\n\nIn the petrochemicals-intensive manufacturing sectors the downturn also started months ago. According to the country’s statistical office Indec, manufacturing economic output fell by 4.8% in November, year on year.\n\nOverall economic output fell by 1.4% in November, year on year, according to Indec’s Monthly Economic Activity Estimator (EMAE in its Spanish acronym).\n\nFROM CHAINSAW TO SCISSORS\n\nOutsider Milei came to prominence in the past two years with outlandish appearances in the media, not least those when he appeared with a chainsaw as a sign of his potential policies as president.\n\nIn his view, Argentina needed deep cuts to public spending, practically dismantling the welfare state, as well as privatizations of major state assets such as the energy major YPF or airline Aerolineas Argentinas.\n\nWhile Milei’s won a resounding mandate in the Presidential election, with more than 56% of the votes, his La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) party is in a minority in both Congress and the Senate: he will always have to seek the alliance of center-right parties who do share some of the points in Milei’s electoral program.\n\nHowever, those parties were always unlikely to support measures which would send millions straight into poverty as the measures kicked in. Subsidies, pensions, and other state expenditure on which many depend upon is likely to stay practically unchanged for now as Congress prepares to vote the so-called ‘Omnibus Bill’ presented by Milei in December.\n\nThe law aimed to revolutionize Argentina’s economic system by withdrawing hundreds of protectionists and state-led economic regulations and implementing deeply liberal measures in which the state would have little say or spending capacity.\n\nAccording to Perez, the cut to state spending planned by Milei accounted to 5% of GDP, which would have meant a true shock to both household and corporate finances, but around 40% of those cuts he proposed are currently being negotiated and are likely to end up being heavily watered down by Congress.\n\nJust like with the peso’s devaluation, Milei is also trying to go very quick with the fiscal adjustment, the economist at Fundacion Capital added.\n\n“Correct measures have been taken to get out of the economic emergency and avoid catastrophe. But then, instead of strengthening those measures and move towards economic stabilization, it is as if the government wanted to skip a few of the necessary steps,” said Perez.\n\n“This is like studying a degree: you cannot study the first two years and jump to the last year. The ‘Omnibus Bill’ presents us with a completely different model for the country – Milei wants to be in the last year of university, but he must first do the hard work of the years in-between.”\n\nOn Milei’s favor, however, Perez highlighted how he has for now the full backing of one of Argentina’s lenders of last resort: the IMF, which earlier in January released a $4.7bn tranch of funding to the country as part of a $44bn bail-out started in 2022.\n\nThe IMF said Milei had inherited an “exceptionally challenging” economic and social situation characterized by macroeconomic imbalances, the result of “inconsistent and expansionary” policies, especially during the final quarters of last year as the electoral cycle went underway.\n\n“The new administration is already implementing an ambitious stabilization plan, anchored on a large upfront fiscal consolidation, along with actions to rebuild reserves, correct relative price misalignments, strengthen the central bank’s balance sheet, and create a simpler, rules-based, and market-oriented economy,” said the IMF.\n\nFront page picture source: Shutterstock"
