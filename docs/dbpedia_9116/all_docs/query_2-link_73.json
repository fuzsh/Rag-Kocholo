        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe biggest banknote in current circulation in Argentina is being increased to 10,000 pesos, worth around $10, so that people don't need to carry too much cash around with them, according to recent reports.\n\nThe value of the Argentinian peso has fallen over the years and amid soaring inflation, Argentina's central bank is working on lightening the load of citizens by multiplying the value of the biggest bank note by five, making it a 10,000 pesos banknote, equivalent to approximately $10, according to an NBC report. This is being done so that people do not need to carry around loads of cash for simple transactions.\n\nHow badly has inflation affected the Argentinian peso?\n\nThe country's inflation rate has touched a whopping 287% in March this year, according to reports, which is one of the highest across the world, meaning that the Argentinian peso's value fell through the roof, amounting to very little in comparison to the US Dollar.\n\nWhen is the new 10,000 Argentinian peso banknote hitting the streets?\n\nAccording to authorities at Argentina's central bank, the new 10,000 pesos banknote will be officially available for circulation within the next month in an attempt to 'simplify transaction processes' between users.\n\nHard currency has always remained the most popular way to conduct transactions in the country, and the use of the 1,000 peso note is the most common in the country.\n\nHowever, before inflation soared in the country, this 1,000 pesos bill was worth $58 (on the black market), back in 2017, when it first came into circulation but now the value of this banknote is worth a mere dollar, says NBC.\n\nArgentina’s central bank has also recently mentioned that it would introduce an even bigger bill of a 20,000-peso note later this year, according to reports.\n\nWhat happened in Zimbabwe?\n\nLast month, Zimbabwe's central bank introduced a new \"structured currency\" supported by gold, aiming to address rampant inflation and bring stability to the country's struggling economy.\n\nDubbed Zim Gold (ZiG), the new currency will be backed by foreign currencies, gold, and other precious minerals, as announced by John Mushayavanhu, the governor of Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhich new Argentinian banknote will be in circulation soon?\n\nAccording to Argentina's central bank, a new 10,000 peso banknote will be available next month onwards for users to 'simplify transactions'. This note will be worth around $10, in comparison to the US Dollar.\n\nHow much is 1,000 Argentinian pesos worth currently?\n\nAfter inflation soared in Argentina, which touched a whopping 287% in March this year, the value of a 1,000 pesos banknote has been reduced to a mere one US dollar.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
