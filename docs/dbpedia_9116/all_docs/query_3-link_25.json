        "text": "The official currency of Argentina is the Argentine peso (ARS), which has been in circulation since 1992. The Argentine peso is subdivided into 100 centavos, and you’ll find coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos, as well as 1 and 2 peso coins. Banknotes come in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 pesos.\n\nArgentina’s currency has a long and tumultuous history, dating back to the early 19th century. The first currency used in Argentina was the Real, which was introduced during the Spanish colonial period. After gaining independence in 1816, Argentina introduced its currency, the Peso, which has been the country’s official currency ever since.\n\nThis article delves into the history and currency usage of the Argentine Peso (ARS). It will provide an overview of the currency’s denominations, including coins and banknotes, and trace its evolution from the early 19th century when the Real was used during the Spanish colonial period.\n\nHistorical Journey of Argentine Peso\n\nThe Argentine peso, known as the peso convertible, has been the currency of Argentina since 1992. It’s often symbolized as “$” and is divided into 100 centavos. However, due to high inflation, coins valued under one peso are seldom used. The peso replaced the austral currency at a rate of 10,000 australes to one peso.\n\nArgentina’s currency has suffered from severe inflation and even hyperinflation since the mid-20th century. This has led to several instances where the currency was replaced with a new version, with conversion rates ranging from 100:1 to 10,000:1. For example, when the new peso was introduced in 1992, it was worth ten trillion of the old pesos.\n\nIn recent times, particularly in the early 21st century, the peso has continued to experience significant inflation. By October 2023, the inflation rate had reached 142.7% year-on-year, which was the highest since the peso’s introduction in 1991.\n\nOriginally, when the peso convertible was introduced in 1992, it was pegged at an equal value to the US dollar. This 1:1 exchange rate was maintained until early 2002. Over the years, the value of the peso against the US dollar declined significantly, going from a 3:1 exchange rate in 2003 to 250:1 in early 2023. By September 2023, the official government exchange rate was 350 pesos to one US dollar, while the unregulated market rate was 768 pesos per US dollar.\n\nIn December 2023, following the election of President Javier Milei, the economy minister Luis Caputo changed the official exchange rate to 800 pesos per dollar, which was a devaluation of over 50%. This change was planned to be followed by a monthly devaluation target of 2%. At that time, the unofficial exchange rate was around 1000 pesos per dollar.\n\nHistory of Coins\n\nThe Argentine Peso has undergone numerous changes and denominations since its initial introduction. Early on, the peso was symbolized by a “$” sign, often accompanied by specific symbols to denote the particular type of peso in circulation. For example, “m$n100” indicated pesos moneda nacional. Since the introduction of the current peso in 1992, commonly known as the peso convertible until 2002, it is simply represented by the “$” sign.\n\nHistorically, the peso’s journey began with the silver Spanish eight-real coin, known as the peso, used during Argentina’s Spanish colonial period. After Argentina gained independence in 1816, it started issuing its currency, including silver eight-real coins, still referred to as pesos.\n\nFrom 1826 to 1881, Argentina introduced the peso fuerte and the peso moneda corriente. The peso fuerte was a convertible currency, tied to the gold standard, while the peso moneda corriente was a non-convertible everyday currency that depreciated over time. In 1881, these were replaced by the peso moneda nacional at a rate of 25 to 1.\n\nBetween 1881 and 1970, Argentina used gold and silver pesos, following international standards set by the European Congress of Economists. The currency system was then reformed to use the peso oro sellado and the silver peso, with specific weights and purities defined by law.\n\nIn 1970, the peso ley replaced the previous currency at a rate of 1 to 100. The peso argentino was introduced in 1983, replacing the peso ley at a rate of 1 to 10,000. This was followed by the austral in 1985, which replaced the peso argentino during a period of hyperinflation.\n\nThe current peso convertible was introduced in 1992, replacing the austral at a rate of 1 peso to 10,000 australes. Initially pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, this peg was abandoned in 2002, leading to significant devaluation.\n\nCoins in Argentina have varied over time, with the introduction of different denominations, such as 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos, and 1 and 2 peso coins. Commemorative coins have also been issued for various historical events and figures.\n\nThroughout its history, the Argentine Peso has been marked by periods of significant inflation and devaluation, impacting its international exchange rate and domestic buying power. The currency’s journey reflects Argentina’s complex economic history and challenges.\n\nHistory of Bills\n\nIn 1992, Argentina introduced banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 pesos. Initially, these notes had the phrase “Convertibles de curso legal,” indicating their value was fixed to the US dollar. The 1-peso note was later replaced by a coin in 1994. Currently, it’s rare to find convertible notes, except in the 100-peso denomination. All these bills are of the same size.\n\nThe design of these banknotes features important Argentine figures and landmarks, each with a unique color and watermark. For example, the 2-peso note features Bartolomé Mitre and the Museo Mitre, while the 5-peso note depicts José de San Martín and the Monument to the Army of the Andes. Other denominations include Manuel Belgrano on the 10-peso note, Juan Manuel de Rosas on the 20-peso note, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento on the 50-peso note, and Julio Argentino Roca and Eva Perón on different versions of the 100-peso note.\n\nIn 2016, a new series of banknotes was introduced, adding 200- and 500-peso denominations. These new notes feature Argentine fauna, such as the guanaco on the 20-peso note and the Andean condor on the 50-peso note. The 100-, 200-, and 500-peso notes depict the Taruca, Southern right whale, and Jaguar, respectively. A 1,000-peso note featuring the Hornero was also introduced.\n\nA concept design for a 5,000-peso note was revealed in 2020 but wasn’t issued. Instead, a 2,000-peso note was released in 2023, featuring the Instituto Malbrán and doctors Cecilia Grierson and Ramón Carrillo, without a security thread.\n\nIn May 2022, Argentina announced another series of 100-, 200-, 500-, and 1,000-peso notes, replacing animal motifs with images of historical figures and events. These designs include Eva Perón, Martín Miguel de Güemes and Juana Azurduy, Manuel Belgrano and María Remedios del Valle, and José de San Martín. As of May 2023, these designs have not been put into circulation. However, the new 2,000-peso note featuring Ramón Carrillo and Cecilia Grierson was released in March 2023 and circulated in May 2023.\n\nInflation and Buying Power of the Argentina Currency\n\nArgentina has been struggling with high inflation rates for decades, which has had a significant impact on the country’s economy and the buying power of its currency. In this section, we will explore the causes of inflation in Argentina and its effects on the buying power of the Argentina currency.\n\nArgentina experienced significant inflation fluctuations, with a rate of 54% in 2019, decreasing to 42% in 2020. The country’s economic challenges largely stem from the impact of the 1998-2002 economic depression and a history of poor fiscal discipline. While there’s a data gap from 2014 to 2016, Argentina’s inflation has been one of the highest globally in recent years. From 1980 to 2022, the inflation rate ranged between -1.2% and 3,079.8%, with an average annual inflation rate of 206.2%. This led to a staggering price increase of 902.38 billion percent over this period. By early 2023, an item costing 100 pesos in 1980 would cost 902.38 billion pesos. As of October 2023, the year-over-year inflation rate reached 142.7%.\n\nThe Argentine government has implemented various measures to combat inflation, including price controls and subsidies, but these measures have often been ineffective. One of the main causes of inflation in Argentina is the government’s tendency to print more money to pay off its debts, which leads to an increase in the money supply and a decrease in the value of the Argentina currency.\n\nThe high inflation rates in Argentina have also led to a phenomenon known as “dollarization,” where consumers prefer to use US dollars instead of the Argentina currency to protect their purchasing power. As a result, the US dollar has become a de facto second currency in Argentina, and many businesses now accept US dollars in addition to the Argentina currency.\n\nHigh inflation rates in Argentina have had a significant impact on the buying power of the Argentina currency. The government’s tendency to print more money and the resulting increase in the money supply have led to a decrease in the value of the Argentina currency, making it more expensive for consumers to purchase goods and services. Additionally, the phenomenon of “dollarization” has further eroded the buying power of the Argentina currency, with many consumers preferring to use US dollars instead.\n\nArgentine Peso\n\nIn May 2022, the Central Bank of Argentina announced a fifth series of banknotes in denominations of 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 pesos. These new notes replaced the animal motifs from the 2016 series with images of Argentine historical figures and significant events while keeping the same color scheme.\n\n100-peso\n\nThe 100-peso note is violet and features Eva Perón on the obverse, commemorating the extension of voting rights to women in Argentina in 1947.\n\n200-peso\n\nThe 200-peso note, in blue, shows Martín Miguel de Güemes and Juana Azurduy, depicting scenes from the Gaucho war.\n\n500-peso\n\nThe 500-peso note is green and portrays Manuel Belgrano and María Remedios del Valle, with an image of soldiers pledging allegiance to the Argentine flag in 1812.\n\n1000-peso\n\nThe 1,000-peso note is orange and features José de San Martín, illustrating the Crossing of the Andes.\n\n2,000-peso\n\nIn March 2023, a new 2,000-peso note was issued. This note features the Instituto Malbrán and doctors Cecilia Grierson and Ramón Carrillo, known for their pioneering work in medicine. The design of this note was initially intended for a proposed 5,000-peso note. Notably, the 2,000-peso note does not include a security thread. It was officially put into circulation on May 22, 2023.\n\nCurrency Usage in Argentina\n\nIn Argentina, the official currency is the Argentine Peso (ARS).

According to Expatistan, the estimated monthly cost of living for a single person in Argentina is around USD 1,182 (ARS $430,622).

It is also important to notify your bank before traveling to avoid any issues with your card being blocked.\n\nBe aware of common scams: Be aware of common scams such as the “shortchange” scam, where a vendor will give you change for a lower amount than you gave them. Always count your change carefully, and make sure you know the value of the bills you are receiving.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help protect yourself from currency scams while traveling in Argentina. Remember to always be aware of your surroundings and use common sense when making transactions."
