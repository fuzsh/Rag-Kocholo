        "text": "Blue Dollar AKA Dólar Blue or Unofficial Dollar is parallel dollar rate of USD in Argentina. This is the cost of buying and selling a physical dollar bill in a cueva, or clandestine financial house in Buenos Aires. This is the best price you’ll get if you are buying or selling physical bills, and the transaction is done with no involvement of any government-sanctioned or licensed entity (like a bank).\n\nSince the country’s government introduced tough currency change restrictions on its people, a black market has emerged. In short, you can change your money at an official outlet for one price; or you can go to an unofficial trader and get it changed at the “blue” rate – which will put many more pesos in your pocket. Taking plenty of hard cash contradicts the usual advice to tourists travelling abroad, but many visitors to Argentina have been doing just that to take advantage of the black market rates.\n\nSo how do you track down the more favourable blue rate? Many foreign visitors set up a local contact who can make the change, or ask their hotel to recommend a “cueva” (literally meaning cave; in reality, more like fully functioning businesses, accepting dollars, euros and pounds). Other tourists simply head to central shopping streets and respond to not-so-subtle calls of “Cambio! Cambio!” (exchange); the wise ones having checked the current rate first, so they can barter."
