        "text": "Javier Milei is still just a candidate to be president of Argentina. But he is already single-handedly delivering one of Latin America’s biggest economies a financial shock.\n\nThe value of Argentina’s currency is plummeting under criticism by Mr. Milei, a hard-right libertarian who has become the leading presidential candidate by promising to replace the Argentine peso with the U.S. dollar.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Milei continued his attacks on the peso by discouraging Argentines from holding any investments in the currency. “The peso is the currency issued by the Argentine politician and therefore is worth less than excrement,” he said on a popular radio show. “That trash is not even good as manure.”\n\nThe peso’s unofficial rate, which reflects the market’s valuation of the currency and drives prices in Argentina, fell 7 percent on Monday and then another 10 percent by Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAt that unofficial rate, $1 bought 1,035 pesos as of Tuesday afternoon, the first time the peso had crossed the 1,000 mark against the dollar. Before Mr. Milei won a primary election on Aug. 14, $1 bought 660 pesos. In April 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the figure was 80 pesos.\n\nThe escalating crisis prompted Argentina’s Central Bank, which Mr. Milei has promised to shutter, to issue an extraordinary statement on Monday afternoon that “Argentina maintains a liquid and solvent financial system” and that it backs Argentine bank deposits.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
