        "text": "Argentina's Economy Minister, Luis Caputo, has only been in office three days but has already ordered the central bank to execute a major devaluation of the peso. Overnight, the bank shifted its benchmark exchange rate from USD 1 / ARS 364 to ARS 800, a devaluation of 55%.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much subsequent movement of the peso will be allowed, but the ultimate aim is likely to be unification of official and unofficial exchange rates (latest black-market rate is USD 1 / ARS 1055), so that economic imbalances are removed and the black market no longer needs to operate. It is reasonable to expect more devaluations, therefore, although they should be smaller."
