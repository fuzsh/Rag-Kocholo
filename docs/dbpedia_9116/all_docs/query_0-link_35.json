Here are some handy facts about cash, card payments, costs and more in Argentina.\n\nWhere can you get Argentinian pesos?\n\nIf you’re planning a trip to Argentina and need some local currency, there are several ways you can get Argentinian pesos:\n\nCurrency exchange offices or bureaux de change on high streets, in city centres and airports.\n\nOnline currency providers like us here at Manor FX that specialise in currency exchange. Make sure to choose a reliable provider and compare rates and delivery options (Top tip, our rates are the best in the country!)\n\nLocal travel agencies. Some may offer currency exchange services.\n\nPrefer the convenience of online shopping? We can deliver Argentinian pesos right to your doorstep. You can also get the same great exchange rates in our bureau de change in Datchet.\n\nArgentine pesos are an exotic or minor currency, so you won’t find them at most banks or the Post Office. Remember to plan ahead and compare rates and fees to get the most favourable exchange rate.\n\nIt’s also good to check the latest travel advisories and restrictions before purchasing any foreign currency.\n\nCan you buy Argentine pesos in UK?\n\nAbsolutely, but because Argentinian pesos are an exotic currency, there are fewer places where you can buy them.\n\nWhether you’re dreaming of tangoing in Buenos Aires or exploring the stunning landscapes, getting your hands on some Argentinian pesos in the UK is possible with us.\n\nWe offer the best rates and deliver currency right to your door. Wherever you are in the UK, you can buy Argentinian pesos ready for your trip.\n\nShould I exchange money before I travel to Argentina?\n\nYes. When planning a trip to Argentina, it’s a good idea to exchange some GBP to pesos before you go.\n\nYou can exchange your pounds for pesos on arrival, but it’s better to have some local currency available when you land. It can save you from hassle, long queues, or unfavourable rates at the airport.\n\nWhat is the best currency to bring to Argentina?\n\nIt’s best to bring Argentine pesos when travelling to Argentina. It’s also a good idea to bring some US dollars with you.\n\nCan I use my bank card in Argentina?\n\nYes. All international hotels and large shopping malls in Buenos Aires and other main cities in Argentina will generally accept international debit and credit cards.\n\nBritish cards may not work in some Argentinian payment terminals. This is especially true for smaller supermarkets and shops, and vendors in suburbs, small cities and more remote places.\n\nVendors may also require you to spend a minimum amount before they accept payment by card to cover the card fees.\n\nSome British banks may charge for international card payments. In addition, your bank’s ARS (Argentine pesos) to GBP exchange rate may not be so good. This is how banks make money.\n\nContact your bank before using your card for payments in Argentina to avoid your bank card getting blocked.\n\nShould I use cash in Argentina?\n\nYes, especially if you plan to travel around Argentina – cash is still the most popular means of payment. Having cash can also come in handy for bargaining and getting better deals.\n\nMany shops in suburbs and small cities will only accept cash. This is also true for greengrocers, butchers, newspaper stands, street food vendors and candy stores.\n\nAmerican dollar banknotes are widely accepted in downtown Buenos Aires and other touristic cities. Some downtown shops will accept Brazilian Reais as well.\n\nIs it better to use cash or credit card in Argentina?\n\nWe recommend that you carry cash with you. Credit cards are widely accepted in major cities and tourist areas, but smaller establishments and local markets often prefer cash. Plus, some places might even offer discounts for cash payments. Having a credit card as a backup doesn’t hurt, though.\n\nHow much cash should I take to Argentina?\n\nIt depends on your spending habits and the length of your trip. Argentina is a diverse country, and costs can vary a lot. Ideally, have some cash in your pocket for smaller purchases in case you come across places that don’t accept cards.\n\nAim to have around 15000-20000 Argentine pesos (£30 to £60) per day for basic expenses like meals, transportation, and small purchases. However, you might want to bring more if you plan on indulging in fine dining, shopping, or visiting high-end establishments.\n\nHow can I avoid ATM fees in Argentina?\n\nMost ATMs in Argentina charge a fee for withdrawals, especially if you’re using a foreign card. Here’s what you can do to avoid those fees:\n\nPlan ahead: Exchange your pounds to Argentine pesos before you leave the UK.\n\nLook for fee-free ATMs: Some banks in Argentina offer fee-free withdrawals for certain foreign cards.\n\nWithdraw larger amounts: Instead of making multiple small withdrawals and paying multiple ATM charges, withdraw more significant amounts less often.\n\nUse your card for purchases: Whenever possible, use your card for purchases to avoid ATM fees.\n\nIs life expensive in Argentina?\n\nCoffee in a local cafe will cost 100-150 pesos (28-48p). A three-course meal in a mid-range restaurant costs between 5000 and 8000 pesos (£14-£22).\n\nAccommodation, food, transportation, attractions and activities are generally affordable. Tourists can explore the country’s cultural and natural wonders without breaking the bank.\n\nSouvenirs, handicrafts, and local products are reasonably priced, providing opportunities to bring home unique souvenirs of their trip.\n\nHow does tipping work in Argentina?\n\nIf you eat or drink in restaurants or cafes, you should leave a tip in cash. Tips are an important part of the staff’s income.\n\nTips are usually in the 5% to 10% range but can be more if the service is exceptional.\n\nIs it rude not to tip in Argentina?\n\nNo, it is not rude not to tip in Argentina. Unlike in the UK, tipping isn’t expected or customary. But, if you receive exceptional service or want to show appreciation, leaving a small tip is always appreciated.\n\nIs Argentina a cheap country to visit?\n\nIt depends on your budget and what you’re looking to do. It can get quite pricey if you plan to splash out on fancy hotels and dining at high-end restaurants.\n\nYour money will go further if you’re happy to stay in more budget-friendly accommodation and eat at local places. Especially since the financial crisis.\n\nArgentina offers a good balance between quality and affordability.\n\nArgentinian Currency\n\nBanknotes in Argentina\n\nBanknotes in Argentina come in various denominations and feature prominent figures from the country’s history, landscapes, and cultural symbols.\n\nTwo sets of ARS banknotes are circulating alongside each other:\n\nThe 3rd series features portraits of national heroes, including Manuel Belgrano and Evita Peron.\n\nThe 4th series features animals living in Argentina and has a vertical design.\n\nBanknotes in circulation are $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $200, $500 and $1000. Don’t accept banknotes of $2 and $1 banknotes since coins have replaced these.\n\nHigh inflation wiped out much of the value of the Argentine peso over the past years. Since then, new higher-denomination banknotes have been introduced.\n\nThe smaller banknotes remain in circulation and are often quite worn out and sometimes dirty. Wash your hands often.\n\nAdditionally, it’s always a good idea to be cautious when handling currency and avoid using or accepting damaged or counterfeit banknotes.\n\nCoins in Argentina\n\nArgentinian coins range from 5 centavos (0.05 pesos) to 10 pesos. They feature national symbols on one side and the denomination and year of minting on the other.\n\nWhen handling coins, be aware of their condition and authenticity to avoid accepting or using counterfeit currency.\n\nDid you get back from Argentina with some leftover coins? Our sister company Leftover Currency can help you to exchange Argentine peso coins back into cash.\n\nArgentina’s currency import and export regulations\n\nThere are no restrictions on the import or export of Argentine Pesos into and from Argentina. But, if the value is more than $10,000 USD, you should declare it. Exporting foreign currency from Argentina is not permitted if the value is worth more than $10,000 USD.\n\nOrdering Argentine pesos online\n\nWith Manor FX, you can order your Argentine Pesos online.
