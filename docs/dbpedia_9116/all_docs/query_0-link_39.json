        "text": "As the second-largest economy in South America, the Argentine economy is one of the most dynamic in the region. With a highly literate population and a diversified industrial base, Argentina stands to benefit significantly from its export-oriented agricultural sector and rich natural resources.\n\nHowever, the country’s economic history is characterised by periods of high growth and severe recessions. Income inequality and poverty have increased in recent times, challenging the nation’s progress. Despite this, Argentina remains one of the most promising countries in South America, with the potential to emerge as a major economic player on the global stage.\n\nThe currencies used in Argentina can be traced back to the pre-independence period. During the colonial era, the Spanish Real was primarily used as the currency until Argentina gained independence in 1816. Following independence, the country introduced the Peso Fuerte as its official currency.\n\nIn the 20th century, Argentina went through various economic crises that had a significant impact on its currency. The first crisis occurred in the 1980s, which led to hyperinflation and the introduction of the Austral currency. The currency had a short lifespan and was later replaced by the Peso Convertible, pegged at a 1:1 official exchange rate with the US dollar in 1991.\n\nThe Peso Convertible was successful in the short term, stabilizing the economy and reducing inflation. However, in the early 2000s, Argentina suffered another economic crisis that led to the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate system, and the Peso Convertible became the Peso once again.\n\nToday, the Argentine Peso operates under a floating exchange rate system, with its value determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The currency has historically been troubled by high inflation rates, which significantly affected its value against the US dollar and other major currencies.\n\nOverall, the history of Argentina’s currency has been marked by economic instability, devaluation, and crisis. Despite these challenges, the government is working to find solutions to stabilize the currency and strengthen the economy.\n\nTipping is not compulsory in Argentina, but it is considered customary and strongly ingrained in their culture. Argentinians view tips as a form of reward for good service. Tourists are encouraged to display some generosity when tipping, and this can go a long way in building relationships with the locals.\n\nHowever, it’s key to note that tipping is discretionary, and one should only give a tip when satisfied with the service received. So to help give you an idea of how much you should tip, here are some common tipping practices in Argentina.\n\nRestaurants: 10% is the norm for tipping in restaurants in Buenos Aires, and it’s common to leave less or nothing if the service is poor. Fine dining restaurants expect tips. A cubierto charge is sometimes added to the bill, which goes to the restaurant and not the waitstaff. Credit card receipts don’t have a tip section, so bring cash to pay the tip separately.\n\nBars: Tipping is becoming more common in bars, and bartenders appreciate it. There is usually a tip jar available, and it’s better to put the tip directly into the bartender’s hand. Tipping for high-end specialty cocktails is appreciated.\n\nTaxis: Tipping is not expected for cab drivers in Argentina. It’s polite to round up to the nearest whole peso multiple of $5. If the cab driver helps with your luggage, it’s nice to give them something in gratitude. For remis and private rental cars, tipping around 10% is common.\n\nTour Guides: Tipping around 10-20% of the tour price is common for professional tour guides, but only if you have a good experience. “Free” tours typically require giving around $200-300 pesos per person for a 3-4 hour tour.\n\n“Car Attendants” (trapitos): Car attendants or trapitos can charge $20-$30 pesos in some neighbourhoods to park on “their” block. Tipping them is wise, even if it’s not much, and a “half now” and “half later” approach works best.\n\nDelivery Person: Tipping 5-10% is a good rule of thumb for delivery guys, in addition to any delivery fee charged by the restaurant. It’s also polite to give something to the delivery man who helps unload the groceries if you have them sent “a domicilio” (to your house).\n\nBudget\n\nIf you’re backpacking around Argentina, the average daily budget ranges from 3,700-6,200 ARS per day. This budget includes essentials such as accommodation, food, transportation, and activities. Staying in hostels, eating at affordable food stalls, and doing free activities like hiking and city tours can help you save costs.\n\nModerate\n\nFor a moderate budget, we recommend budgeting between 7,100 and 11,500 Argentine pesos per day. This budget will allow you to stay comfortably in a private Airbnb or private hostel with some extra money for transportation and activities. You’ll have the opportunity to indulge in local drinks and occasional taxi rides, and even participate in popular tours like wine tours and dance lessons. Ensure you plan your budget wisely to get the most out of your travel experience.\n\nLuxury\n\nWhen it comes to budgeting for a luxurious trip, you’ll want to aim for a daily allowance of 13,800-23,500 ARS. With this type of budget, you can indulge in a range of activities and experiences without having to worry about breaking the bank. From staying in lavish hotels to dining out for every meal, the options are endless. You can even explore the rugged wilderness of Patagonia or hop between cities via flight. And if you’re willing to spend even more, the possibilities truly become limitless."
