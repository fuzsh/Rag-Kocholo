        "text": "Key View\n\nDespite government commitments to hold the peg through the rest of 2024, we believe a one-time devaluation (as a first step towards removing the cepo) or acceleration of the crawling peg in Q4 2024 is likely. This underpins our forecast that the peso is likely to average ARS1,050/USD in 2024 and end the year at ARS1,200/USD.\n\nWe forecast that amid an economic recovery, disinflationary pressures will help to introduce more stability to the peso in 2025, although the peso will still depreciate through the year, ending at ARS1,400/USD and averaging ARS1,300/USD for the year. We do not believe dollarisation will be fully implemented by 2025, but increased currency competition will continue to underpin peso weakness.\n\nWhile there is a possibility that the government could maintain the crawling peg through 2024, risks to our forecasts are particularly pronounced in 2025, where financial market and economic volatility could result in a weaker peso. If the macroeconomic picture is more stable than we currently think, then we could see the exchange rate depreciate by even less than expected or even marginally appreciate.\n\nShort-Term View (three-to-six-months)\n\nFrom a current spot rate of ARS933.75/USD (as of May 27),we forecast that the Argentine peso will end 2024 near ARS1,200/USD and annually average ARS1,050/USD. Our core view is that the government will maintain its 2.0% per month crawling peg through most of H224 but is likely to enact a one-time devaluation near the end of the year or accelerate the crawling peg in the last month or so. Our forecast is slightly more bullish than consensus of almost ARS1,400/USD by end-2024, but we note that consensus has moved closer to us since January 2024, as the crawling peg has remained more resilient than markets initially expected (see chart below).\n\nConsensus And BCRA Survey Exchange Rate Expectations Have Moderated Significantly Since Milei Took Office\n\nSelected Exchange Rates, ARS per USD\n\nSource: Ambito, BCRA, BMI\n\nWhile the peso saw broad stability in H124, as the government held the crawling peg steady after it was announced in December 2023, there are growing signs that the currency will start to show more volatility, especially in the various parallel exchange rates. There are many different exchange rates, but a few require detailing here:\n\nInformal ‘blue’ dollar: This is the exchange rate that is technically illegal to use but allows any entity or person to exchange pesos for dollars through black market dealers called cuevas (caves), avoiding capital restrictions.\n\nElectric Market of Payments ‘MEP’ Dollar: The exchange rate used for buying and selling sovereign bonds on the local market. Commonly used as a roundabout way to access USD at a cheaper rate than the savings ‘ahorro’ exchange rate.\n\nBlue-Chip Swap ‘CCL’ Dollar: The exchange rate used for buying and selling sovereign bonds on the international market.\n\nIn mid-January through early February, the informal and two financial market-related exchange rates all depreciated as the political risk premium rose following Milei’s failed first attempt at passing his omnibus bill. The exchange rates moderated and broadly stablised in March through mid-May, until a very aggressive, multi-step, rate cutting cycle brought the monetary policy rate down from 80.0% at the start of April to 40.0% by May 14. With the significant decline in interest rates the attractiveness of carry trades for investors, and savings for households, has diminished substantially, which caused the blue, MEP and CCL rates to weaken to all-time levels, before moderating somewhat in the subsequent week (see chart below). Indeed, as of May 29th, the spread between the ‘blue’ and official exchange rates remains elevated at 30%, above the 20.2% average during Milei’s tenure so far.\n\nMarch And April Stability Gave Way To More Volatility In Mid-May\n\nSelected Exchange Rates, ARS per USD (Inverted)\n\nSource: Ambito, BCRA, BMI\n\nH224 View: Core View Is A Year-End Devaluation, But Accelerating The Crawl Also A Possibility\n\nWe believe that the trajectory of macrofundamentals as well as market signals will prompt the government to allow the peso to weaken before the close of the year, most likely in the form of a one time-devaluation. This devaluation will be similar to the one enacted by the President in December 2023 – although the magnitude will almost certainly be much less. However, our forecast implies the government will not be able to honour its commitment to maintaining the exchange rate anchor, in the form of a crawling peg, unchanged through the remainder of 2024. Indeed, a consistent crawling peg would push the peso’s official exchange rate to approximately ARS1080-1090/USD. This is due to several factors that we will discuss below, as we also sketch out possible alternative scenarios to our core view (see chart below).\n\nWhile One-Time Devaluation Remains Our Core View, We See Alternative Scenarios Regarding Raising The Crawling Peg\n\nExchange Rate Forecasts, ARS per USD (month of exchange policy pivot, new crawling peg rate)\n\nSource: BCRA, BMI\n\nThe first and probably most important indicator to monitor is the broader inflation trajectory and shifts in expectations. Broadly, Milei has been quite successful in reducing inflation through his tenure so far, as collapsing domestic demand and easing money supply growth have proved quite disinflationary – consecutive fiscal surpluses have removed peso liquidity from the real economy. We forecast that inflation will end the year at 161.5% y-o-y, compared to 289.4% currently and 211.4% at the end of the previous year. This is in line with market expectation surveys conducted by the Banco Central de La Republica (BCRA) that show easing inflation in the short- and medium-term.\n\nHeadline Inflation In Argentina To Slow Through 2024, 2025, According To Our And BCRA Survey Expectations\n\nArgentina - REM Inflation Survey Expectations (LHC) & BMI Consumer Price Inflation Forecast, % y-o-y = LHS & % m-o-m = RHS (RHC)\n\nSource: BCRA, BMI\n\nHowever, inflation, while slowing since December 2023, is still higher than the rate of depreciation of the official nominal exchange rate, implying ongoing increase in the real exchange rate. In other words, the peso has seen a decline in competitiveness because foreigners have lost purchasing power in real terms, given the elevated rate of inflation. While not a useful tool for gauging the absolute fair value of a currency, the real effective exchange rate for the peso is hovering far above its 10-year moving average, which at least suggests that the peso is reaching overvalued territory. According to our core inflation forecast, this trend will continue, which could ultimately start weighing on the peso’s desirability and value, which underpins our related forecast of an exchange rate pivot close to end-2024.\n\nStill-High Inflation, Coupled With A Rigid Exchange Rate, Is Pushing The Peso Into Deeper Overvalued Territory\n\nArgentina - J. P. Morgan Broad Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Index (2010 = 100)\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan, BMI\n\nThis leads to our second set of indicators, which are the spreads between the official exchange rate and the (1) blue (informal) dollar and (2) ccl rates. Broadly, the blue dollar rate serves as a proxy for real economy participants’ (households, small and medium sized businesses, etc.) perceptions of the risk premium of holding pesos, while the ccl (and MEP for local players) rate serves the same role for financial market participants (investors, asset managers, etc.).\n\nParallel Exchange Rates Spreads Against The Official Rate Have Remained Relatively Low, Although More Volatility Is Expected In H224\n\nSelected Exchange Rates, ARS per USD (Inverted) & Spreads Against The Official Rate, %\n\nSource: Ambito, BMI\n\nGenerally, we believe this is important as an indicator of the inflation trajectory for determining the government’s internal confidence in the crawling peg; however, given President Milei’s more central goal of dollarising the economy sometime in the future, we believe that his government will be less sensitive to spikes in the spreads vis-à-vis the official exchange rate as it generally signifies people transferring pesos into dollars. Indeed, the previous administration clamped down on them heavily, but President Milei has relaxed enforcement against these informal traders. This is more true for the blue dollar rate than the ccl rate, as a spike in the latter could more directly imply weakening confidence in the peso from financial markets, which Milei is determined to avoid in order to maintain Argentina’s new business-friendly turn.\n\nOur core view is there will a fair bit of volatility in H224 in these spreads, particularly if there are surprises in future fiscal, inflation, and/or growth prints. Broadly, we think that the spreads will progressively average wider through the year due to the impacts of inflation mentioned above, but that the government will have a fair bit of tolerance for this.\n\nNext, we take a look at interest rates. In an effort to keep real interest rates negative but low enough to reduce excess liquidity in the banking system, Milei’s government enacted an aggressive rate hiking cycle (as mentioned above). Through April, high nominal interest rates had enabled a sizable carry trade for investors, but as policy turns more loose, many have started to pull their positions as returns have meaningfully reduced. This suggests that the Milei government would need to raise interest rates if it were to devalue the peso, as not doing so could possibly prompt a wider exit from the peso. This underpins our forecast that interest rates will rise from their current rate of 40.0% to 50.0% by end-2024, in order to increase the attractiveness of the peso and lend more support to the currency in the short term. We note that the BCRA is not independent and will implement policy prescription directly from the government.\n\nInterests Rates Will Likely Need To Be Adjusted, As Will The Exchange Rate, Before The Cepo Can Be Loosened Or Removed\n\nArgentina - Nominal Monetary Policy Rate (Historical & Forecast), %\n\nSource: BCRA, BMI\n\nFinally, growth will also play a role in driving the peso’s trajectory. We have recently revised our real GDP outlook to encompass an even deeper contraction of 3.8% in 2024 compared to 1.9% previously, with a return to positive growth delayed almost entirely to 2025 (see chart below). This means that consumption and thus corporate profits will be weak, which will dampen investment and overall capital flows to the economy, which will weigh on the peso.\n\nGrowth Recovery Will Likely Be Delayed To 2025, Given Weakness In Early 2024\n\nArgentina - Quarterly Real GDP Growth (Historical & Forecast)\n\nSource: INDEC, BMI\n\nIn our core view, we forecast that as the economy starts to exit contractionary territory around Q4 2024 with inflation remaining modest (relative to historical standards), the government will feel comfortable allowing the peso to weaken, especially as fiscal policy remains tight.\n\nLong Term Outlook (six-to-24-months)\n\nIn 2025, we believe that the peso will likely average ARS1,300/USD and end the year at ARS1,400/USD, as a result of lower inflation, among other improving macro fundamentals. That said, there is a high level of uncertainty given evolving and broad pronouncements about the medium-term exchange rate strategy and framework. Broadly, especially after a devaluation, we believe that the peso will be far more competitive. Not only do we forecast that 2025 annual average inflation will ease to 80% y-o-y, but that real growth should rebound to 2.5% and the fiscal deficit will narrow further from 1.7% of GDP in 2024 to 0.5% in 2025. This improving macro backdrop will help reduce the risk premium associated with investing and doing business in Argentina, improving its attractiveness, and thus supporting the exchange rate.\n\nArgentine Peso Likely To Continue Depreciating Through 2025, But At Much Slower Rate Than Previously\n\nOfficial Exchange Rate, ARS per USD (LHS) & Annual Rate Of Depreciation From End Of Period, eop (RHS)\n\nSource: INDEC, BMI\n\nIn line with our view that the cepo will be at least partially loosened before the end of the year, we think that exchange rate policy will also be liberalized with the possibility of a managed float system. The government has started to downplay its ‘dollarisation’ plan, and is instead talking about a ‘currency competition’ where multiple currencies would be used as legal tender. The scope of this currency competition is unclear, but while the US dollar and the peso will be the primary currencies usage of the Brazilian real and the Euro is also likely.\n\nIn public statements, Milei explains that a strong fiscal anchor will limit the growth of the peso-denominated money supply – also aligning with his plans to abolish the BCRA– and that freer use of the dollar in the real economy will naturally allow the economy to slowly transition from using the peso to the US dollar. The government has given sparse details, in the form of scope and timelines, and it is not clear that the IMF is supportive of the plan – which could have implications for the Argentine government’s efforts to renegotiate the current debt deal for a larger funds disbursal later this year.\n\nIn our core view, we believe that the peso will depreciate rather considerably in 2025 for two principal reasons. First, we believe that the spectre of dollarisation will continue to depress its value as investors, households and businesses alike will look to limit their holdings of pesos, especially as it becomes an increasingly smaller portion of the overall monetary base. Second, inflation will still be among the highest in the region and will for outpace that of the US, meaning the peso will have to soften in order to remain competitive."
