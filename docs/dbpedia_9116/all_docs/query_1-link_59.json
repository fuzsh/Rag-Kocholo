        "text": "Devaluation of the Argentine peso\n\nArgentina's economy and inflation have been characterized by a drastic decline in value for around 100 years. Since 1935 alone, there have been four currency reforms, each with new currency denominations, and a whole series of additional devaluations. The largest single devaluation of 99% took place at the turn of the year 1989/1999. Although the other devaluations were significantly lower in percentage terms, some of them took place on an annual basis. Overall, the value of the national currency has fallen by 99,99999999% since 1935.\n\nPegging to the US dollar\n\nIn 1991, the then \"Australes\" was pegged to the US dollar in order to stop the decline in value. As a result, there were only slight fluctuations in the short term. With the introduction of the \" Peso\" in 1992, five zeros were again removed, but the peg to the dollar was retained. In 2001, the Argentine crisis again caused severe turbulence and a collapse of the market. This was followed by several further devaluations by repeatedly adjusting the exchange rate against the US dollar.\n\nBlue dollar as a parallel currency\n\nBetween 2012 and 2015, the purchase of foreign currency was practically prohibited in order to prevent the purchasing power of the Argentinian peso from weakening even further. As a result, a black market for US dollars and other foreign currencies developed in Argentina. The unofficial conversion rate to the US dollar averaged 180% of the official rate, and in 2013 it exceeded the important 200% mark. The term \"blue dollar\" was coined for this type of parallel currency. The flight of capital into other currencies ultimately caused the central bank's foreign exchange reserves to collapse. Although exchange controls were relaxed a few years ago, the black market for foreign currencies still exists.\n\nKey interest rates of 40% and annual inflation rates of up to 50% are a significant burden on Argentina's economic system. There is no end in sight to the misery. In 2022 alone, the inflation rate rose to almost 95%.\n\nCurrency reserves for the Argentine peso\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the total broad money (M3) amounted to ARS 67.274 trillion at the end of 2023. For currency hedging, reserves were held in a total amount of 6.838 trillion pesos. This corresponds to a ratio of 1:9.8. In other words, not even 1 of 9 pesos is deposited with a countervalue.\n\nApproximately 3.940 trillion pesos (57.6%) of the currency reserves exist in gold reserves. The remainder consists of foreign currencies, special drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and other reserve positions.\n\nâ€º Worldwide currency and gold reserves\n\nSources\n\nAll conversion rates are based on data from the European Central Bank.\n\nData on currency and gold reserves are from the International Monetary Fund."
