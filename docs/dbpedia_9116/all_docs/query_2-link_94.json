        "text": "Dollar\n\nDon´t worry! We know this issue can be rather confusing at times. That´s why we are going to provide you with some clear and concise guidelines. But first, we´d like to remind you that while booking a trip with Argentina On The Go, you will be offered ongoing advice and guidance in that regard, along with the chance to make any other inquiry you may have.\n\nIn Argentina there are several “types” of dollars. In this post we will be discussing two in particular: the official dollar and the blue dollar (aka dolar blue, unofficial dollar, parallel dollar). The former, as its name suggests, is the official one sold by the national government, thus in banking entities. The latter is the one sold in the parallel market.\n\nWe suggest that visitors in Argentina bring in cash with them (dollars), so they may exchange it in the recommended sites. This way, they will obtain a lucrative rate for their transaction and be able to afford whatever they may need while traveling around the country.\n\nWhere should I exchange my money?\n\nOn arrival in Argentina you may exchange some of your money in sites inside the international airport (open 24 hours). By doing so, you will ensure a secure transaction and have some cash with you in case you should need it. Later on, you may visit a bank or exchange bureau for the rest of the cash.\n\nIf planning on touring more remote corners of the country, which usually only take cash, it is best to exchange your money in the main cities and thus have some cash with you at all times.\n\nIn the official website of the Banco de la Nación you will find the current exchange rate (purchase and sale of dollars). As for the times, the banks in our country open from 10 am to 3 pm.\n\nOfficial Exchange Offices\n\nMost of the official exchange bureaus are based in the center of the capital city. On the following link of the Argentine Central Bank you will find a full list, which includes directions and telephone numbers of all the exchange offices in the national territory.\n\nIt may interest you: 12 Months. 12 Recommended Destinations in Argentina to Visit in 2022\n\nBanco Nación\n\nAlternative Plan\n\nOne of the options most used by locals and foreigners alike is Western Union, which operates in many countries around the world and offers clients an easy and secure way to carry out this kind of online transaction. Through this platform you may send your money directly from your bank account or your credit card to receive money in cash, in this case, in Argentine pesos. The exchange rate is roughly 70% higher than the one you may obtain when exchanging currency through a bank or one of the official exchange offices. The good news is that this is the legal and safest way to receive a most convenient rate.\n\nThe “Arbolitos” (little trees)\n\nA shift in topic? Not at all. The so-called “arbolitos” are those people who seek to persuade tourists to exchange their money in the unofficial exchange offices they work for. They may be spotted on Florida street (in the center of the city) or in Buenos Aires downtown. “Cambio, cambio, cambio” is the most frequent chant they use to make themselves visible. For greater security, we highly recommend using official offices exclusively.\n\nCredit cards\n\nPlease note that in AOTG we only offer recommendations to our passengers. However we do not force anyone to follow them word for word. In this case in particular we do advice using credit cards only when have run out of cash. Remember that by paying with credit card you are bound to obtain less favorable rates.\n\nThis also applies to any transaction you make with your card in an ATM (cash withdrawal).\n\nFlorida Street\n\nIs it possible to exchange Euros in Argentina?\n\nThe most accepted (and appreciated) currency is the dollar, which means that carrying dollars will make things easier and more lucrative in general terms. However, if you´d rather not exchange your euros for American dollars, you will be able to exchange your euros for Argentine pesos in all the official offices and many of the hotels in our country.\n\nTips\n\n– Prior to the trip, estimate your average expenses so you know how much money to bring with you.\n\n– Get one of our agents to advice you on this issue.\n\n– Do not keep your cash in one single place. Be cautious when moving around from place to place. Bear in mind that many journeys include trekking, long rides, and in some cases, several stops.\n\n– Decline offers of help by strangers, and avoid exchanging your money in unofficial offices.\n\nSome costs in the city (in Argentine Pesos, 2022)\n\nBelow you will find some costs estimates for your information. Please note that these are average prices and that they vary according to the area, establishment or season.\n\n– Breakfast: between AR$ 1,000 and 3,000 per person.\n\n– Lunch: Between AR$ 2,000 and 6,000 per person\n\n– Coffee: Between AR$ 400 and 650 per person\n\n– Taxi, short ride: AR$ 600 (6 km approximately)\n\n– Tickets to museums and National Parks: Between AR$ 1,000 and $3,000\n\n– Tickets to theater plays: Between AR$ 1,500 and 7,000 (depending on the play)\n\n– Beer: Between AR$ 300 and 500\n\n– Bottle of water: Between AR$ 100 and 200\n\n– Dinner: Between $2,500 and 7,000 per person"
