My brother, Jonah, and I just want to TALK to the magic mirror -- we're not planning on traveling into any fairytales today. Promise.\n\nExcept we do wind up going through the mirror, this time into the story of The Frog Prince. The princess, who's supposed to transform the cute little frog back into a handsome prince, turns out to be super rude. Jonah and I decide we don't want -- or need -- her help. We can take matters into our own hands and turn the frog into a prince ourselves! Can't we?\n\nNow we just have to:\n\n- Climb out of a smelly well\n\n- Canoe over a waterfall\n\n- Sneak into a palace\n\n- Kiss a frog (ack)!\n\nAnd there's no time to waste -- let's hop to it!"
