So you’ll have a little more info than I did, Addie. About the bracelet. About the magic. About the creepy blond lady. (I hope she doesn’t come after you, too!)\n\nThen I’m going to bring the box to the post office.\n\nAnd then …\n\nWell, I don’t know what happens then! I’m going to hope that this package gets all the way to Addie Asante, of Columbus, Ohio. All the way to YOU.\n\nMaybe you’re feeling lonely, too. Maybe you lost a friend. Or your dad moved away? Or maybe you’re feeling blue about something else entirely.\n\nI don’t know why your name is on this box. But I hope you get it. And I hope you’ll reach out to me when you do. I’m not on Friendstagram (anymore), but my email and phone number are on the back of this notebook. I’m here to talk about anything. I would love to hear from you.\n\nGood luck, Addie. And best wishes.\n\nThank you to all the publishing people for working their magic on this book:\n\nEspecially Aimee Friedman, who edited this book about a hundred times, and Laura Dail, my forever agent, who has been cheering this series on for over a hundred years. Thank you both for your never-ending support and trust.\n\nMore thank-yous to everyone at LDLA and Scholastic, especially Carrie Pestritto, Rachel Feld , Taylan Salvati, Victoria Velez, Lauren Donovan, Erin Berger, Elizabeth Parisi, Olivia Valcarce, Arianna Arroyo, Lisa Sandell, Melissa Schirmer, Abby McAden, David Levithan, Ellie Berger, Lizette Serrano, Emily Heddleson, Alan Smagler, Elizabeth Whiting, and everyone in Sales and in the School Channels.

So grateful for all your help.\n\nI wish every writer had writer friends as magical as I do. A million thanks to:\n\nEmily Jenkins, for reading a very early draft and kicking my tush.\n\nCourtney Sheinmel, for her careful read and constant cheerleading.\n\nStu Gibbs for talking me through the plot again and again.\n\nMax Brallier for telling me THERE WERE TOO MANY THINGS and for understanding why I refused to add a tiny funny genie.\n\nMorgan Matson for fixing all the problems.\n\nChristina Soontornvat for her brilliant suggestions.\n\nAdele Griffin for hosting and feeding me cheese platters, pie, and friendship.\n\nMargot Miller for reading the book so quickly and giving me great notes! (And for having the world’s best aunt.)\n\nTo the rest of my coworkers in crime: Julie Buxbaum, Rose Brock, Alan Gratz, Anne Heltzel, Karina Yan Glaser, Julia DeVillers, Elizabeth Eulberg, Gordon Korman, Leslie Margolis, Lauren Myracle, James Ponti, Melissa Posten, Debbie Rigaud, Rebecca Serle, Jennifer E. Smith, and Bob—thank you for judging covers, brainstorming titles, Zooming, texting, and making me laugh while I write. I appreciate you all.\n\nBooks in Wonderland was inspired by the amazing Books of Wonder in New York City. While it currently doesn’t have a location on the Upper West Side, hopefully one day it will again.\n\nAdditional thanks and love to: Bonnie Altro, Elissa Ambrose & Robert Ambrose, the Bekers, Brett Berkowitz, Linda Guerrero & Ben Berkowitz (thank you for the name suggestion, Ben!), the Bilermans, Jess Braun, Rose Brock, Jeremy Cammy, the Deckers, Lauren Kisilevsky, the Mittlemans, Aviva Mlynowski, Larry Mlynowski & Louisa Weiss, Zibby Owens, Shobie Riff, and the Steins.\n\nLove to my husband, Todd, and my daughters, Chloe and Anabelle.

You are my wishes come true.\n\nSARAH MLYNOWSKI is the New York Times bestselling author of the Whatever After series, the Magic in Manhattan series, Gimme a Call, and a bunch of other books for teens and tweens, including the Upside-Down Magic series, which she cowrites with Lauren Myracle and Emily Jenkins and which was adapted into a movie for the Disney Channel.
