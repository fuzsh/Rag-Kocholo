        "text": "Anthony: This classic tale by Washington Irving is about a scrawny schoolteacher in the idyllic town of Sleepy Hollow. The teacher’s name (as you may already know) is Ichabod Crane. But, there is a funny rumor that has been circulating around the town for ages. It is about a headless soldier that rides around the countryside on his horse at night. One night, after a party with the girl Ichabod likes, he comes face-to-face with the headless horseman. Nobody in town is exactly sure what became of Ichabod Crane, but you can read this timeless classic and see for yourself!\n\nTy: The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving is a classic ghost story about the Headless Horseman. The main character is Ichabod Crane, a lanky school teacher. He is fascinated by ghost stories and the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel. There is also the town bully named Brom Bones, who also likes Katrina. One night they are all gathered around the campfire and Brom tells of his encounter with the Headless Horseman. On his way home Ichabod runs into the Headless Horseman and disappears. I think this is a great suspenseful story. I recommend it to people of more advanced reading levels become it has a lot of old English words in it. I loved it and I think you would like it to. I also recommend The Tell Tale Heart by Edgar Allen Poe, The Monkey's Paw by W.W. Jacobs, and The Necklace by Guy de Maupassant. Washington Irving doesn't have an official website but, you can learn about him by going to www.classicauthors.net/**Irving**. Listen to an excerpt:\n\nChris: The story is set circa 1790 in the Dutch settlement of Tarry Town, New York, in a secluded glen called Sleepy Hollow. It tells the story of Ichabod Crane, a lanky schoolmaster from Connecticut. Ichabod is a superstitious man and actively believes in ghost and goblins, but he fears none other than the terrible Headless Horseman. In this story Ichabod competes with Abraham \"Brom Bones\" Van Brunt, the town rowdy, for the hand of 18-year-old Katrina Van Tassel, only daughter of a wealthy farmer. Read this book and find out what happens when ghosts, rivals, and (far more troublesome than all of the others put together) a woman combine to create a truly timeless tale!\n\nThis story also includes Rip Van Winkle. The story of Rip Van Winkle is set in the years immediately before and after the American Revolutionary War (about 1770-1790s). Rip Van Winkle, a villager of Dutch descent, lives in a nice village at the foot of the Catskill mountians(in New York). An amiable man whose home and farm suffer from his lazy neglect, he is loved by all but his wife. One autumn day, however, something happens to Rip Van Winkle and causes him to never be the same again. Read this story and find out what happens next.\n\nBoth these novels are adapted by Jack Kelly and,unlike Washington Irving, are written in modern English and is appropriate for all ages to read.\n\nChris: This is a very interesting tale about how ghost stories can become true. Ichabod Crane is a skinny, lanky, and young school teacher. He moves to Sleepy Hollow so that he can pursue a teaching job and earn some extra money as a singing teacher. When Ichabod falls for Katrina Van Tassel a scandalous young trouble maker, his idea of what he came to Sleepy Hollow to do is all changed. Brom Bones another purser of Katrina hunts Ichabod down. But instead of hurting poor Ichabod, Brom tells him a bone-chilling tale about a headless ghoul who haunts Sleepy Hollow trying to find the head he lost in war years ago. That night some say that Ichabod was so frightened with his encounter with the headless horseman that he leaves town. Others might even go as far to say Brom Bones is behind it. The story of Ichabod Crane and Sleepy Hollow will always and forever remain a mystery.
