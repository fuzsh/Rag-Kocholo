        "text": "Darklight (Wondrous Strange #2)\n\nBy: Lesley Livingston\n\nPublished By: HarperTeen\n\nPublication Date: December 2009\n\nPage Count: 310\n\nBuy it at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or IndieBound\n\nSource: Purchased by Reviewer\n\nAudience: Young Adult - Fantasy\n\nMy love affair with Wondrous Strange continues in Darklight, Lesley Livingston's second installment in her Wondrous Strange trilogy! And it is a wondrous continuation of this delightful and intriguing faerie love story.\n\nA little bit of time has passed since the events of the last book. Kelley is left in New York City, missing and anxiously awaiting the return of her new-found love, Sonny, as well as dealing with the realization that she is an actual faerie princess. In an attempt to sort of maintain a semblance of a normal life, Kelley is also starring in a new play, Romeo and Juliet, following her success in A Midsummer Night's Dream. (Consistent with this trilogy, there is an underlying theme, tying a Shakespearean play into the story.)\n\nKelley is beginning to fully embrace her newly discovered magical abilities -- although half of which were reclaimed by her father, King Auberon, in a previous deal she made with him to save Sonny. And part of that deal also forced Sonny to return to the Otherworld to destroy the rogue hunters left from the awakening of the Wild Hunt.\n\nAnd while Sonny is away, his fellow guardsman, Fennrys Wolf, seems to have taken over the role of watching over Kelley... and inevitably rescues her on a regular basis as she stumbles into this new world suddenly open to her.\n\nBoth Kelley and Sonny are strong-willed and have their own loyalties, which sometimes leads to them butting heads. And just as Kelley and Sonny's relationship hits a few bumps on the road, there is definitely a strong hint that Fenn perhaps has more than just merely protective feelings for Kelley. But when Kelley and Sonny were together, they were simply magical, and my heart ached for them when they were apart.\n\nAs we delve further into the faerie realm, it appears that there is someone behind the scenes orchestrating all of these events... but who? And there seems to be some question behind who really called upon the Wild Hunt... just as we realize that Sonny is not without his own powers as well. We also learn much more about Queen Mabh and her involvement in all that has transpired so far. Just as some questions are answered in Darklight, new ones are revealed.\n\nNot only did I love getting to know these characters better... some really shined brighter besides the major players. Tyff demonstrates that she is more than just a faerie-diva--she genuinely has become a great friend to Kelley. I love her snarky personality.\n\nTitania, Queen of the Summer Court and sometimes lover of King Auberon, officially enters the story in Darklight. Kelley is in complete awe of this legendary faerie queen but her instincts are also troubled with her offer of assistance.\n\nAnother developing mystery is what is happening to once-almighty-powerful King Auberon--since he took his share of Kelley's powers, he is becoming exponentially weaker as time passes and no one knows how or why.\n\nDarklight was another 'can't put down' book for me. This magical story continues to flow so nicely and at a good pace, with lots of mystery woven in. Lesley cleverly writes with clear images conveyed into my mind. I love reading a book that sweeps me away to somewhere I could never physically go to but totally feel satisfied visiting in my head.\n\nI will warn everyone, however, that there is a heart-breaker of a cliffhanger at the end. And so rare for me, while I think I understood her reasons, I still wanted to throw my book at a beloved heroine.\n\nMuch has changed since autumn, when Kelley Winslow learned she was a Faerie princess, fell in love with changeling guard Sonny Flannery, and saved the mortal realm from the ravages of the Wild Hunt.\n\nNow Kelley is stuck in New York City, rehearsing Romeo and Juliet and missing Sonny more with every stage kiss, while Sonny has been forced back to the Otherworld and into a deadly game of cat and mouse with the remaining Hunters and Queen Mabh herself.\n\nWhen a terrifying encounter sends Kelley tumbling into the Otherworld, her reunion with Sonny is joyful but destined to be cut short. An ancient, hidden magick is stirring, and a dangerous new enemy is willing to risk everything to claim that power.\n\nCaught in a web of Faerie deception and shifting allegiances, Kelley and Sonny must tread carefully, for each next step could topple a kingdom . . . or tear them apart.\n\nWith breathtakingly high stakes, the talented Lesley Livingston delivers soaring romance and vividly magical characters in Darklight, the second novel in the trilogy that began with Wondrous Strange."
