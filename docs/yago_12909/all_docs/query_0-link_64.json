Iâve been trying for three days. Four\n\nnights ago, Jonah and I accidentally got sucked through the mirror and\n\nlanded in Snow Whiteâs fairy tale. Well, technically, we landed in the\n\nkingdom of Zamel. Rhymes with camel. Thatâs where Snow White lives.\n\nIf Iâd known we were going to Zamel, I never would have worn slippers\n\nand pajamas. I would have worn jeans, a cute sweater, and sneakers. But I\n\ndidnât even know where we were until after weâd already messed up Snowâs\n\nstory.\n\nBut donât worry! Everything ended up fine. Different, but fine.\n\nI did leave my slippers and pajamas at Snowâs, though. The slippers\n\nwere pretty beaten-up anyway, but the pajamas were my favorite pair. Snow\n\nborrowed them one night and loaned me a skirt and top. Getting my\n\npajamas back isnât the only reason I want to visit Snow. I also want to know\n\nwhy Maryrose, the person who lives inside our magic mirror, sent me and\n\nJonah there in the first place. There has to be a reason, right? And why did\n\nthe magic mirror in Snowâs bedroom tell us not to tell our parents about\n\nwhat happened?\n\nJonah and I decided to find out.\n\nP:10\n\nWhen weâd gone to Zamel, the mirror had sucked us inside at midnight,\n\nso the night after we got home, I set my alarm for 11:51 P.M. I put on jeans.\n\nA sweater. Sneakers. I woke up my little brother, Jonah. He put on jeans. A\n\nsweatshirt. Sneakers. We crept down the two flights to the basement and\n\nclosed the door behind us.\n\nJonah knocked. Then he knocked again. Then he knocked once more.\n\nThree times, just like the first time.\n\nBut it didnât work.\n\nWe stood there, waiting, but nothing happened.\n\nNo swirling. No hissing. No opening up its big mirror mouth and\n\nswallowing us whole.\n\nThe next night we tried again. We got up close to midnight. Put on\n\njeans. Sweatshirts. Sneakers. Crept down to the basement. Knocked and\n\nknocked again. Knocked a third time.\n\nNothing, nothing, nothing!\n\nTonight is Night Number Three. Everyone knows threeâs a charm.\n\nEspecially when dealing with fairy tales.\n\nSo here I am. In the basement. Again.\n\nJonahâs fist is up against the mirror. Again.\n\nâReady,â I say. I brace myself. Here we go. Itâs going to work. I know it\n\nis.\n\nJonah knocks.\n\nOnce.\n\nTwice.\n\nThree times.\n\nNo swirling, no hissing, no nothing.\n\nI stomp my sneakered foot. âI donât get it!â\n\nJonah sighs in disappointment, and his skinny arm falls to his side. âDo\n\nyou think itâs broken?â\n\nI peer at the antique mirror. It looks the same as it did when we first\n\nwent through it. Itâs twice the size of me. The glass part is clear and smooth.\n\nP:11\n\nThe frame is made of stone and decorated with carvings of small fairies\n\nwith wings and wands. Itâs attached to the wall with heavy Frankenstein\n\nbolts. We just moved to Smithville â and into our new house â a few\n\nmonths ago, and the mirror came with the house. I used to think the mirror\n\nwas creepy. I guess itâs still kind of creepy.\n\nBut itâs not just creepy. Itâs also fun. Itâs magic.\n\nâIt doesnât look broken,â I say, seeing my brother and myself in the\n\nreflection. Jonahâs brown hair is short and kind of a mess, standing up in\n\ndifferent directions. Mine is shoulder-length and wavy, but still neat. âLet\n\nme try,â I add.\n\nI knock once. Twice. Three times.\n\nThe room is still.\n\nâHello? Maryrose? Are you there?â I know I said Maryrose lives inside\n\nthe mirror, but truthfully, Iâm not sure. All I know is that Maryrose has\n\nsomething to do with the mirror. I think. I really donât know much. I sigh.\n\nâMaybe we imagined the whole thing.â\n\nâNo way,â Jonah says. âWe were there. I know we were. We met Snow!\n\nWe ate her stew sandwiches! Yum. I wish Mom and Dad would make them\n\none night for dinner.â\n\nI snort. First of all, Snowâs stew sandwiches were gross. And second,\n\nthe likelihood of Mom and Dad trying a new recipe these days is very\n\nunlikely. Like one in a bajillion. They havenât cooked in weeks. Weâve\n\nordered pizza for the last two â no, make that three â nights in a row.\n\nDonât get me wrong, I like pizza. What ten-year-old doesnât like pizza?\n\nWhat adult doesnât like pizza? Jonah LOVES pizza, even though he insists\n\non dipping the crust in ketchup, which is totally gross. But three nights in a\n\nrow is extreme. What happened to cooking? What happened to meat loaf?\n\nWhat happened to salad?\n\nMy parents used to cook all the time, before we moved to Smithville.\n\nThey had time to cook then. Now they work all the time. Theyâre lawyers\n\nand just started their own firm. I keep telling them Iâm old enough to do the\n\ncooking, but they wonât listen. Just because I nearly burned down our old\n\nP:12\n\nhouse when I put my socks in the toaster ONE TIME. What can I say? I\n\nwanted toasty socks. They wonât even let me near the washing machine,\n\nwhich makes no sense. Fine. I used too much detergent and turned the\n\nlaundry room into a bubble bath, but also, only ONE TIME.\n\nI yawn. âLetâs go back to bed.â\n\nâBut I want an adventure! Maybe the mirror can take us to other places,\n\ntoo. Like Africa! Or Mars! Or Buckingham Palace!â\n\nâWeâve tried three times, Jonah. We canât do this every night. Weâre\n\ngrowing kids. We need our sleep.â\n\nHe twists his bottom lip. âJust one more try.â\n\nI let him try one more time even though I KNOW itâs not going to work.\n\nI am three years older than he is. I know these things. And Iâm right. Of\n\ncourse Iâm right. Iâm always right. I march him up the stairs, back up to the\n\ntop floor, and steer him toward his room.\n\nHe kicks off his sneakers and plants his face on his bed.\n\nBack in my room, as I change back into my second-favorite pair of\n\npajamas, I canât help but wonder if we really did imagine the whole thing.\n\nBut wait! My jewelry box is sitting on my dresser, and on the lid of my\n\njewelry box are illustrations of fairy tale characters. Snow White is right\n\nbetween Cinderella and the Little Mermaid. Snow is definitely not wearing\n\nher puffy dress. Sheâs wearing my lime-green pajamas, which means it\n\nreally did happen.\n\nSo why isnât the mirror working?\n\nP:14\n\nBlah, grumble, blah.\n\nYes, Iâm cranky this morning. Why?\n\n1. Iâm tired from last night.\n\n2. Iâm having cereal for breakfast AGAIN when there is a full carton\n\nof eggs in the fridge.\n\n3. I have nothing to wear because all my clothes are dirty.\n\nItâs not like I need a hot breakfast all the time, but the eggs are going\n\nbad TOMORROW. I know because I checked the carton. Are my parents\n\never going to cook them? Why did they bother buying them?\n\nAnd the laundry! They havenât done the laundry in more than a week!\n\nWhat is up with that?\n\nâI am down to my monkey underwear,â I say, shifting uncomfortably.\n\nMy mother should know what this means. I have two pairs of monkey\n\nundies and I never, ever, EVER wear them unless I absolutely have to, since\n\nI am not a fan of wedgies. I should have just thrown them out. Of course, if\n\nI had thrown them out, then Iâd have to go to school wearing dirty undies.\n\nYuck. What I really need is for a) my parents to take me shopping, or b) for\n\nthem to do laundry, but itâs not like either will happen, since they barely\n\nhave time to brush their teeth.\n\nP:15\n\nSeriously, I think my dad forgot to brush his teeth this morning. His\n\nbreath smells like last nightâs pepperoni.\n\nMy mom ruffles my hair. âSorry, honey. Iâll try to get to the laundry\n\ntonight.â\n\nâIf I run out of laundry, can I wear my Spider-Man bathing suit under\n\nmy jeans?â Jonah asks.\n\nâNo, sweetie,â Dad says. âYou wouldnât be comfortable.â\n\nLike wedgies are comfortable?\n\nItâs the end of the day and Iâm in bed and Iâm not happy.\n\n1. We had pizza for dinner. Again. Forget smelling like a pepperoni. I\n\nmight turn into a pepperoni.\n\n2. No one did the laundry tonight. I will have to wear my second pair\n\nof monkey underwear tomorrow, which means I will have a\n\nwedgie again. And after that â shudder, shudder â itâs dirty\n\nundies for me.\n\nJonah, who is supposed to be asleep since his bedtime was an hour ago,\n\npops his head into my doorway and whispers, âSee you at midnight!â\n\nI purse my lips. âFine. Iâll try again, but itâs not like I expect it to work.â\n\nâI bet it does!â he cheers.\n\nâAnd what are you basing that on? The fact that it hasnât worked for the\n\npast three days?â I ask in my best lawyer voice. Iâm going to be a lawyer\n\nwhen I grow up. Not because I want to be a lawyer, but because I want to be\n\na judge. You have to be a lawyer before you can be a judge. Thatâs the rule.\n\nFor the record, when Iâm a lawyer, Iâm still going to do stuff like laundry\n\nand cook.\n\nâIt has to work at some point,â Jonah reasons. âIâm setting my alarm.â\n\nI flump my head back on my pillow. âFine. So will I.â\n\nP:16\n\nI will humor my brother and return to the basement. But this is the last\n\ntime. After tonight the mirror is dead to me. Enough is enough.\n\nâAbby! Wake up! Letâs go.â\n\nI open one eye, then the other. Doesnât my brother know that heâs\n\nsupposed to knock? Thatâs the rule.\n\nMy alarm rings and I reach out to turn it off. Grumble. So. Not. In. The.\n\nMood. But I swing my legs over the side of the bed anyway.\n\nâArenât you changing?â Jonah asks. Heâs wearing jeans. A red\n\nsweatshirt. Sneakers.\n\nâNope.â I am staying in my pink pajamas with purple polka dots. Not\n\nanything Iâd ever be caught in outside my house, but Iâm not worried. Itâs\n\nnot like the mirrorâs going to work.\n\nOkay, hereâs the secret thing. Have you ever heard the expression âA\n\nwatched pot never boilsâ? My nana says it all the time. It means if youâre\n\nwaiting for something to happen, it wonât. But if you donât wait, it will.\n\nLike when youâre waiting for your friend to call you back and you stare at\n\nthe phone, hoping it will ring. It doesnât. But if you go off and do your\n\nhomework, before you know it, your friend calls and â yay! â interrupts\n\nyou.\n\nSo hereâs what Iâm thinking: What if this is like that? When I get all\n\ndressed up expecting the mirror to let me in, it doesnât work. But if I wear\n\nthe most RIDICULOUS pajamas I have, the only ones that happen to be\n\nclean, then the mirror will think Iâm not expecting it and will finally let us\n\nin!\n\nI shove the thought back down deep inside my brain. If the mirror\n\nknows Iâm trying to trick it, then my trick isnât going to work.\n\nLa, la, la. No tricks here. Just wearing my ridiculous pajamas.\n\nAnd sneakers. (No choice. The basement floor is cold, and my slippers\n\nare still at Snowâs.)\n\nP:17\n\nI climb down the stairs with Jonah. I close the basement door. We stand\n\nin front of the mirror.\n\nJonah knocks once.\n\nHe knocks twice.\n\nâReady?â he asks.\n\nâWhatever,â I say, trying to sound bored.\n\nHe knocks a third time â thrice.\n\nHa, isnât that a funny word? It sounds like a kitchen utensil. To make\n\nthe eggs really fluffy, I need to use the thrice. Except no one in my house\n\neats eggs anymore.\n\nâAbby ââ\n\nâIt didnât work,â I say. âLetâs go back to bed. Iâm tired.â\n\nâBut, Abby ââ\n\nâMaybe we did just imagine the whole thing. Even the jewelry box. Or\n\nmaybe Maryrose left town. Maybe she came with us to Snowâs story and\n\nstayed there. Maybe ââ\n\nâAbby!â\n\nâWhat?â\n\nJonah is pointing at the mirror. âLook!â\n\nI look. Itâs spinning. Itâs hissing. Itâs turning purple. Itâs working?\n\nOh. My. Goodness. Itâs working!\n\nâWahoo!â Jonah cheers. âWeâre going back in!â\n\nWeâre going back in! Weâre going back in! Weâre going back in and Iâm\n\nwearing polka-dot pajamas.\n\nP:19\n\nJonah jumps on his toes. âLetâs just step inside before it eats us.â\n\nâGood idea,â I say. âMaybe then it wonât gobble up any more\n\nfurniture.â Last time, the mirror sucked up a swivel chair and most of my\n\nparentsâ old law books. I guess the plus side of our parents being too busy\n\nfor even teeth brushing is they havenât come down here in the last few days.\n\nTheyâd have a million questions and Iâd have no answers.\n\nâI canât wait to see Snow!â Jonah exclaims. âAnd the dwarfs! And\n\neveryone!â\n\nI grab my brotherâs hand. âMe too. Letâs do it!â\n\nWe hold tight and walk in. At first it feels like weâre stepping into a\n\nvacuum cleaner. I close my eyes. Then, thump.\n\nI land on my butt and open my eyes. I expect to smell trees. Or ground.\n\nLast time, we arrived in the middle of a forest.\n\nWe are not in a forest.\n\nWhere are we? All I see is white. And NOT as in Snow White. âJonah?\n\nYou okay?â\n\nâIâm tangled.â\n\nâIn what?â I have no idea where I am. Why do I only see white? Am I\n\nin a marshmallow? I reach out to touch the whiteness. Itâs furry.\n\nItâs an animal. Crumbs! An animal ate me! âHelp!â I scream. âIâve been\n\neaten!â\n\nI try to push myself to safety. I end up petting it. Aw. So soft!\n\nP:20\n\nIt doesnât move. I push the furry thing off me and stand up. The fur is\n\non a coat hanger. âOh! Itâs a coat!â\n\nI glance around the small space. Weâre surrounded by coats. Wait a sec.\n\nâWeâre in a coatroom!â\n\nThere are about a hundred coats all around. Leather coats. Wool coats.\n\nMink coats. Hats. Shoes. Ponchos.\n\nâAre we at the dry cleanerâs?â Jonah asks.\n\nâItâs a closet. A coat closet, I think,â I say. The door to the closet is\n\nslightly ajar, and a stream of candlelight is shining in.\n\nâI donât remember Snow having a closet like this,â Jonah says.\n\nâNo. Hmm. Whatâs that sound? Do you hear music?â\n\nJonah nods. There are trumpets and some drums. Dance music. Is it a\n\nparty?\n\nThe closet door swings open. Holding a green cloth coat, a skinny\n\nyoung man with a goatee and wearing a purple uniform grabs a hanger off\n\nthe pole.\n\nI try to duck, but itâs too late.\n\nâWhat are you doing in here?â he screeches.\n\nâWeâre not sure?â I say like itâs a question.\n\nâYou kids better not be stealing coats!â he yells. âIâm up for a\n\npromotion and I canât get fired!â\n\nâWeâre not, we swear,â I hurry to say.\n\nâWeâre here to see Snow,â Jonah adds.\n\nThe guy blinks. âItâs snowing? I should salt the stairs.â\n\nâNot snow, the weather,â Jonah explains. âSnow, the person.â\n\nThe guy shakes his head. âSnow is a name?â\n\nâYes!â I say. âSheâs the queen!â Who is this guy?\n\nHe hangs up the green cloth coat. âClarissa is the queen of Floom.â\n\nâFloom?â I repeat.\n\nâYes, Floom.â\n\nâWeâre in Zamel,â I say.\n\nâNo,â the skinny guy says, tugging on his goatee. âFloom.â\n\nP:21\n\nâRhymes with room,â Jonah says.\n\nâAnd loom,â the guy says. He eyes us suspiciously. âYouâre not from\n\nhere, are you?â\n\nâWeâre from Smithville,â I say.\n\nâIs that far?â he asks.\n\nâAbout a mirror away,â I mumble. âSo thereâs definitely no Snow\n\nWhite here? I wonder where we are. Another story maybe. You said the\n\nqueen is Clarissa?â\n\nâAnd the king is Eugene, and the prince is Jordan.â\n\nâIs there a princess?â I ask.\n\nâNot yet. Of course weâre all hoping that will change. How old are you,\n\nnine?â\n\nâTen and a half, thank you very much.â Humph. I try to push past him,\n\nbut he blocks my way.\n\nâWhat are you doing here?â he asks. He looks me over. âAre you the\n\ncourt jester?â\n\nMy cheeks burn. âNo, I am not!â I really did not think this pajamawearing plan through.\n\nâWell, youâre too young to be eligible for marriage.â\n\nâUm, no kidding.â\n\nA man and a woman, both wearing sheepskin coats, approach the coat\n\nman. âDonât go anywhere,â the coat man says to us. âI have to help them.â\n\nRight. And where would we go? Weâre stuck in a closet.\n\nHe bows to the couple. The guy is wearing a tuxedo and sheâs in a long\n\nsatin dress.\n\nWe are at a party. A fancy party.\n\nâOh my gosh, weâre at a fancy party and Iâm wearing pajamas!â I\n\nexclaim to Jonah. âHow embarrassing. Maybe I should just stay in the\n\ncloset.â\n\nâDo you think itâs a wedding?â Jonah asks.\n\nâMaybe.â\n\nâA sweet sixteen.â\n\nP:22\n\nâCould be.â\n\nâA bat mitzvah?â\n\nâI donât know, Jonah.â Iâm going to have a bat mitzvah when Iâm\n\ntwelve. Thereâs no way it will be this fancy, though.\n\nI peek at the woman as her escort hands her coat to the coat guy.\n\nSpeaking of fancy â her dress is covered in shiny beads and sequins,\n\nand has a huge poofy skirt.\n\nSheâs wearing a ball gown. Which makes this a ball.\n\nA ball. Weâre at a ball. My head nearly explodes. âJonah! Look at her\n\ndress! Do you know what this means?â\n\nâYouâre really, really underdressed?â\n\nI wave my hand. âYouâre hardly wearing a tuxedo. But besides that.\n\nWeâre at a ball. Think. Who has a ball?â\n\nâI have a soccer ball. I think itâs somewhere in the backyard, but I ââ\n\nâNot that kind of ball, Jonah. A ball ball. A party ball. We went through\n\nthe mirror, but weâre not in Snow Whiteâs story. Weâre at a ball and thereâs\n\na prince. A prince looking for his princess. Weâre in ââ\n\nHis eyes light up. âAfrica? Mars? Buckingham Palace?â\n\nI smile. âNo, Jonah. Cinderella.â\n\nP:24\n\nDo you know Cinderella?â I ask the coat guy.\n\nHe scratches his goatee. âNever heard of her.â\n\nâMaybe youâre wrong. Maybe weâre not in Cinderellaâs story,â Jonah\n\nsays.\n\nâNo, no, we are,â I say, thinking fast. âThe coat man works in the\n\npalace, which means he probably doesnât know Cinderella. Her family\n\nhides her away in the house!â\n\nâIf you say so.â Jonah pauses. âCan we go explore?â\n\nJonah always wants to explore. Floom. Zamel. The basement.\n\nâWait a second,â the coat guy says before Jonah can drag me away.\n\nâAre you supposed to be here? Were you invited?â\n\nâNot exactly ââ Jonah begins.\n\nI shoot him a look. If the coat guy kicks us out, weâre in big trouble.\n\nThe mirror that will take us home is probably here in the palace. Also, I\n\nwant to see Cinderella. What girl doesnât love Cinderella? That awesome\n\ndress! The glass slippers!\n\nIâve always wanted a pair of glass slippers. Also ruby slippers. Hmm, I\n\nwonder why we call the glass slippers slippers? Theyâre not slippers.\n\nTheyâre high heels.\n\nThe coat man is staring at me. Oh, right. I need to come up with a\n\nreason why weâre here. âWeâre um â¦ looking for our parents!â I say.\n\nâThey brought us here and told us to hang out while they talked to their\n\nfriends.â\n\nP:25\n\nOkay, fine. So I stretched the truth a bit.\n\nA lot, actually. But desperate times call for desperate measures. We just\n\ngot here. We canât get in trouble already!\n\nThe coat guy frowns. âWell, I suppose the king will enjoy your outfit.â\n\nHumph. I guess heâs being sarcastic.\n\nHe narrows his eyes. âYouâre sure your parents are here?â\n\nJonah and I both nod.\n\nThe coat guy shrugs. âAll right. Go ahead. Have fun.â\n\nWe step out of the closet. Weâre standing in some sort of entranceway.\n\nThe ceilings in this place are really high. Soaring. It reminds me of my\n\nschool gym. Except itâs much, much nicer. And less smelly.\n\nâLook,â Jonah says. âThereâs a painting on the ceiling!â\n\nI look up. Itâs a painting of people. Royal people. Hundreds of royal\n\npeople. I can tell theyâre royal because theyâre all wearing crowns. I guess\n\nthis royal family has been around for a long time. I feel eyes on me and\n\nlook back down. The man and the woman who just checked their coats are\n\nstaring at me.\n\nOr, more likely, staring at my pajamas.\n\nHow rude. This canât be their first time they ever saw pajamas. They\n\ndonât have to stare.\n\nâLetâs go inside the ballroom,â Jonah says excitedly.\n\nI notice an elderly woman eyeing me, too.\n\nâBut people are looking at me,â I whisper.\n\nâSo?â Jonah asks.\n\nâThey think Iâm weird!â\n\nâYou are! Who cares? Letâs go to the party!â\n\nâBut Iâm too obvious in my pajamas! And you, too! Youâre wearing a\n\nred sweatshirt and jeans. Do you see anyone else wearing a sweatshirt and\n\njeans? Weâre at a ball!â\n\nâNo one is noticing me with you in that outfit, trust me.â\n\nâThanks,â I retort. âWe have to be careful. What if someone says\n\nsomething to the prince? What if Cinderella sees me? What if I mess up the\n\nP:26\n\nwhole story?â\n\nJonah ignores me. âDo you think they have snacks? I bet they have\n\ndogs-in-a-blanket. It seems like the kind of party that has dogs-in-blankets.â\n\nâDo you mean those miniâhot dogs? Theyâre called pigs-in-a-blanket.â\n\nâNo, theyâre not.â He adamantly shakes his head. âWhy would they be\n\ncalled pigs-in-a-blanket when theyâre hot dogs? Theyâre not hot pigs.â\n\nâI didnât make this up, Jonah. Iâm just correcting you.â\n\nâWho cares what theyâre called? I just want to eat them. Letâs go!â\n\nInstead of waiting for me to respond or grant him permission, he takes off.\n\nWhy doesnât he realize that I am the older sibling and therefore\n\nresponsible for making all the decisions?\n\nI run after him into the ballroom.\n\nWow. There are, like, a thousand people here. No wonder Cinderella\n\nwas upset that she wasnât invited.\n\nâLook,â I say, pointing. Up on a stage are two people sitting on two\n\npurple thrones. âThey must be the king and queen.â\n\nThe queen is smiling a perfect smile. Her teeth are the color of white\n\nchalk, and she has long wavy blond hair. She looks like a real-life Barbie.\n\nOr maybe a beauty pageant contestant.\n\nThe king is sitting next to her, looking bored. He keeps yawning.\n\nBetween him and his wife is a humongous flag.\n\nThe Floom flag, probably. The design? Pink with purple polka dots.\n\nI look down at my pajamas. I look back at the flag.\n\nI look down again. I look back up.\n\nI look around and see that a crowd of people are waving and smiling at\n\nme. âGreat outfit!â one woman cheers.\n\nOh my goodness! No wonder no one has kicked me out. I am wearing\n\nthe Floom flag! Iâm their mascot.\n\nIâm going to blend right in!\n\nWait. Maybe thatâs why the mirror finally let us through. Yes! We never\n\nwould have been accepted here if I wasnât wearing this Floom flag pair of\n\npajamas.\n\nP:27\n\nOur magic mirror sure is smart.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I spot the prince.\n\nI can tell heâs the prince because:\n\n1. Heâs handsome.\n\n2. Heâs youngish (like an older teenager).\n\n3. Heâs wearing some sort of royal purple robe. (Or maybe itâs just a\n\nbathrobe over his pjâs, but I highly doubt it.)\n\n4. Heâs wearing a crown.\n\n5. Heâs surrounded by a ton of girls. There are many giggles and a lot\n\nof hair flipping. Itâs like watching one of those dating reality shows\n\nthat my mom used to watch when she had time for TV. The girls\n\nlook so silly. Iâm so embarrassed for them.\n\nâPrinces wear crowns, too?â Jonah asks. âCan I wear a crown?â\n\nI snort. âAre you a prince?â\n\nâMom says Iâm her prince.â\n\nâThen ask Mom to get you a crown. Maybe sheâll make you one out of\n\ntinfoil.â\n\nâNever mind,â he says. âIt looks kind of heavy. Hey, is that\n\nCinderella?â he asks, pointing to the girl standing next to the prince.\n\nâHer? No way.â The girl heâs pointing to is wearing a beige dress with a\n\ngold choker around her neck. Sheâs definitely not Cinderella.\n\nâHow do you know?â Jonah asks.\n\nâBecause â¦ because â¦â Her hair isnât straight and itâs not curly. Itâs\n\nmore zig-zaggy. A little frizzy.\n\nAnd itâs not blond. Or brunette. Itâs in the middle.\n\nAnd her eyes arenât blue or green or sparkly. Theyâre small. And her\n\nlips are kind of thin. âSheâs average-looking,â I answer. Sheâs not ugly or\n\nanything â sheâs just ordinary. Plain. And Cinderella is supposed to be the\n\nMOST beautiful girl in all the land.\n\nP:28\n\nâAre you sure?â Jonah asks. âThe prince is talking to her. He seems to\n\nlike her. Isnât that how the story goes?â\n\nI look more closely and have to agree. The prince is talking to her. Heâs\n\neven laughing at something sheâs saying. But it doesnât mean he wants to\n\nmarry her, does it? I mean, I laughed when Zach Rothenberg stuffed an\n\nedamame up his nose in the school cafeteria, but it doesnât mean I want to\n\nmarry him.\n\nThereâs a sudden trumpet sound at the door. Everyone in the room turns\n\nto look.\n\nThen one of the doormen announces, âThe gorgeous stranger princess\n\nhas arrived!â\n\nThe gorgeous stranger princess?\n\nCinderella!\n\nP:30\n\nI study the prince to see how he reacts. First, he turns to look at his dad, the\n\nking, who motions to the door. Iâm guessing thatâs his royal order to Go Get\n\nthe Stranger Princess. The prince nods and makes his way outside.\n\nAnd the girl he was talking to? Her face falls. Aw. I canât help but feel\n\nbad for her. But come on! How can a regular girl compete with Cinderella?\n\nCinderella! Iâm going to see Cinderella!\n\nThe entire crowd drifts out the door to see.\n\nOh. My. Goodness.\n\nFirst we see a gold coach. âThat used to be a pumpkin!â I whisper to\n\nJonah.\n\nThen I motion to the six gray neighing horses. âThose were mice!â\n\nStanding by the coach are six footmen and a plump coachman.\n\nâWhat were those?â Jonah asks.\n\nâThe coachman was a rat, I think. But I forget what the footmen were.\n\nSpiders? No, lizards, maybe?â\n\nHere she comes! First her foot. Her glass-slippered foot. The crowd\n\noohs and aahs.\n\nShe steps out of the coach just like a movie star at a Hollywood\n\npremiere.\n\nEveryone gasps.\n\nI gasp. She really is gorgeous.\n\nHer dress is gorgeous, too.\n\nP:31\n\nShe looks just like she does on my jewelry box, in her ball gown. Sheâs\n\nso sophisticated. So stunning. So sparkly!\n\nâSheâs breathtaking,â a young man with thick black glasses says.\n\nâBut who is she?â a woman with bright pink lipstick asks. âIs she really\n\na princess?â\n\nâSheâs not from around here, thatâs for sure,â an older woman leaning\n\nagainst a cane says, then clucks her tongue. âTrust me. I would know. I\n\nknow everyone.â\n\nâHer dress is real silver!â pink-lipstick woman says.\n\nâNo, itâs platinum,â the older woman declares. âThatâs better than silver.\n\nItâs even better than gold. Trust me.â\n\nThe dress glitters. Cinderella glitters. Her blond hair is pulled up and\n\nback in some sort of super-awesome knot, and her face is made up. Red\n\nlipstick. Blush. Silver eye shadow.\n\nOr maybe itâs platinum.\n\nYou can see her blue eyes even from here. Theyâre practically glowing.\n\nThe prince appears beside her. âHello,â he says gallantly. âNice to see\n\nyou again.â\n\nâHi,â she responds, batting her mascaraed eyelashes. âItâs nice to see\n\nyou again, too.â\n\nHuh? Again?\n\nâI donât get it,â Jonah says. âHe knows her already?â\n\nThat is weird. How does he already know her? I tap the cane woman on\n\nthe shoulder. âExcuse me,â I ask. âHow does the prince know Cinder â I\n\nmean, the beautiful stranger princess?â\n\nShe rolls her eyes. âThey met at the first ball.â\n\nOh! Right! There were a whole bunch of versions of Cinderella, and\n\nsome of them had more than one ball. My nana is a literature professor and\n\nshe used to read all the original fairy tales to me when we lived near her in\n\nNaperville.\n\nI just donât remember how many balls there were. Hmm. Probably\n\nthree. Of course â everything in fairy tales happens in threes.\n\nP:32\n\nâSo there are three balls?â I ask.\n\nShe clucks her tongue. âNoooo. Two. Yesterdayâs and todayâs. Thatâs\n\nit.â\n\nI guess not everything happens in threes. I turn back to Cinderella. She\n\nlooks so beautiful. He looks so handsome. They are a perfect fairy tale\n\ncouple. âIsnât it romantic?â I swoon. âIsnât it wonderful?â\n\nâThe other girl doesnât think itâs so wonderful,â Jonah comments,\n\npointing with his chin toward the girl who was talking to the prince before\n\nhe dumped her for Cinderella.\n\nThe average-looking girl.\n\nShe does look kind of devastated. I donât blame her â she was making\n\nthe prince laugh before Cinderella showed up. If she would have asked me,\n\nI would have told her to back off â she was asking for heartbreak.\n\nReally, everyone should consult me before making decisions. Itâs for\n\ntheir own good.\n\nâAbby, what now?â Jonah asks.\n\nâOne sec,â I say. I canât help but follow Cinderella and the prince as\n\nthey walk back into the ballroom. Theyâre magnetic. All the guests point\n\nand gasp. Even the music stops.\n\nEveryoneâs mesmerized. Everyone except my brother, but heâs a sevenyear-old boy. He canât be expected to appreciate epic romance.\n\nThe prince wraps his arm around Cinderellaâs waist and takes her hand.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe music restarts. My heart soars. They begin to dance.\n\nRumors and whispers swirl.\n\nâI heard sheâs the heiress to a diamond dynasty!â\n\nâI heard sheâs the youngest princess in Roctavia!â\n\nâI heard sheâs turned down thirteen marriage proposals, but thinks our\n\nprince is the one!â\n\nI cover my mouth so I donât laugh.\n\nâAbby,â Jonah whispers. âTheyâre wrong, right? Isnât she just an\n\nordinary girl whose fairy godmother made her look pretty to come to the\n\nP:33\n\nball?â\n\nâShe was always pretty,â I say. âBut her mom died and then ââ\n\nâHow come the mother always dies in fairy tales? Snow Whiteâs mom\n\ndied, too.â\n\nâI donât know, Jonah. I donât write these things, I just read them. Where\n\nwas I?â\n\nâDead mother.â\n\nâRight. Her mom died and her dad remarried an evil stepmother.â\n\nâAgain with the evil stepmother!â\n\nâTell me about it.â\n\nâBut the evil stepmother had daughters?â\n\nâYes. Two. And theyâre not as beautiful as Cinderella.â\n\nâAnd why is she at the ball again?â\n\nLuckily I paid attention to Nanaâs stories 100 percent of the time. Jonah,\n\nabout 30 percent.\n\nâThe stepmom was invited. She was planning to go with her\n\nstepdaughters, hoping that the prince would fall in love with one of them\n\nand make her a princess. Cinderella wanted to go, too, but her stepmom\n\nsaid no way. She made her sleep in the attic and do all the housework.\n\nCinderella cried, and then presto, up popped her fairy godmother who said\n\nshe was going to help her. She turned a bunch of animals into the coach and\n\nfootmen, and her rags into a beautiful dress. She gave Cinderella glass\n\nslippers. Sheâs an awesome stylist, this fairy godmother. Wish I had one.\n\nAnyway, she told Cinderella to leave the ball by midnight.â\n\nâWhy?â\n\nâBecause thatâs when all the magic ends.â\n\nâBut if sheâs a fairy godmother, why canât she make it last longer?â\n\nI shrug. âI donât know. But what happens next â what happens now â\n\nis that Cinderellaâs having so much fun that she nearly forgets itâs midnight.\n\nShe runs and drops her shoe ââ\n\nâI thought there were two balls?â Jonah asks.\n\nP:34\n\nâOh. Right. I donât remember every single detail, but I think at the first\n\nball Cinderella danced with the prince but then remembered to leave before\n\nmidnight. But the final ball is when she loses track of time and then drops\n\nher shoe. Her dress turns back into rags, and the coachmen and the footmen\n\nand the coach turn back to mice and rats and lizards and a pumpkin.\n\nMeanwhile, the prince picks up the shoe and promises that whoever the\n\nshoe fits will be his wife. Over the next few days, his assistant goes around\n\nto all the households in the kingdom and makes the ladies try on the slipper.\n\nIt fits Cinderella perfectly. She shows him the second shoe as proof and all\n\nis well. She gets married to the prince and is rescued from her mean\n\nstepmother. And they live happily ever after.â Sigh. I love this story.\n\nâWhat happens to the stepsisters?â\n\nâIn the classic version, I think it was written by some French guy,\n\nPerrault or Poutine or something, Cinderella forgives them. Thatâs the one\n\nNana liked the best. In the others I think itâs kinda grosser.â\n\nHis eyes light up. âTell me!â\n\nMy brother loves the gross parts.\n\nâWell, in the Grimm brothersâ one, the stepsisters try to cut off their\n\nheels and toes to fit into the slipper. And then they die.â\n\nâNo way! Awesome!â\n\nI roll my eyes.\n\nâSnack?â a waiter interrupts us, waving a plate in front of us.\n\nâDogs-in-a-blanket!â Jonah cheers.\n\nI roll my eyes again. But I take two.\n\nJonah takes three and stuffs them all in his mouth. âSo what do we do\n\nnow? Explore?â\n\nâCan you swallow before talking, please? Where are your manners?\n\nWeâre at a ball.â\n\nâWhy should I listen to you? Youâre wearing pink pajamas with purple\n\npolka dots.â\n\nHumph. âI think we should find the magic mirror that will take us home\n\nfirst so weâre not rushing around later.â\n\nP:35\n\nâThen we can explore?â\n\nâYeah. But letâs start with the mirror. Itâs probably somewhere in the\n\ncastle. Looking for it is exploring, right? Nowâs our best chance anyway\n\nsince the royal family and the staff are distracted by the ball. But we have to\n\nbe careful not to get in Cinderellaâs way. We canât risk messing up the\n\nstory!â\n\nHe wiggles his eyebrows. âYou donât want to say hi? Even quickly?â\n\nâOf course I do, but we canât. We learned our lesson with Snow White.\n\nWe will NOT mess the story up this time around!â No way, no how, no\n\nthank you.\n\nP:37\n\nWe find twelve mirrors in the castle:\n\nThe mirror in the queenâs room. The kingâs room. The princeâs room.\n\nThe guest rooms. The maidsâ rooms. There are even two in the ballroom.\n\nNone of them work.\n\nAnd knocking on them isnât always easy, either.\n\nThere was a maid in the queenâs room. We told her that Her Majesty\n\nrequested her presence downstairs so that we could continue âexploring.â\n\nIf we donât stop exploring soon, we are definitely going to get caught.\n\nâNow what? Weâve tried all of them!â Jonah huffs after weâve visited\n\nevery room â thrice.\n\nâMaybe the magic mirror isnât at the palace,â I say. âMaybe itâs at\n\nCinderellaâs house. Snow White lived in the palace before she had to run\n\naway. So maybe the portal is where the main character originally lives,\n\nbefore she gets to live happily ever after.â\n\nâBut we donât even know where Cinderella lives!â\n\nâWe can follow her home,â I say. âShe knows where she lives.â\n\nâDo you think sheâs still here?â Jonah asks.\n\nâWait, what time is it?â I glance down at my watch. Oh, no! Iâm not\n\nwearing my watch! I took it off last night before bed. Not that my watch\n\nwould tell me what time it is here. But it would tell me what time it is at\n\nP:38\n\nhome so we could get home before my parents wake up. And now I have no\n\nidea what time it is in Smithville!\n\nARGH.\n\nJonah follows me sneakily down the hallway back into the ballroom,\n\nand I spot a huge round clock hanging on the far wall.\n\nItâs 11:55.\n\nI scan the room for Cinderella and spot her dancing with the prince.\n\nNow the clock says 11:56. Hmm. Does Cinderella not realize what time\n\nit is?\n\nâItâs getting late,â Jonah says. âWe should tell her to go. Doesnât she\n\nturn into a pumpkin at twelve?â\n\nâHer coach turns into a pumpkin, not her.â I grab hold of his sleeve.\n\nâBut no, donât do anything! We donât want to mess anything up.â\n\nWe wait. We watch. 11:58. 11:59.\n\nMy heart thumps. What if our just being here messed things up? What if\n\nwe donât have to do anything but be here and the story changes anyway?\n\nWhat if she changes back into her rags right here and everyone gasps and\n\nfreaks out and the prince doesnât want to marry her after all?\n\nTwelve!\n\nDing Dong! Ding Dong! Ding Dong!\n\nCinderella looks up at the clock. Her face pales when she sees the time.\n\nShe looks at the prince, says good-bye, and then â sprints!\n\nLike really fast!\n\nShe makes a mad dash right out of there.\n\nShe doesnât look back, she just goes, goes, GOES!\n\nZoom! Rhymes with Floom!\n\nâWe have to follow her,â I order Jonah, and sprint right behind her. âIf\n\nwe lose her, we wonât know where she lives!â\n\nâAt least we didnât mess up the story,â Jonah calls out.\n\nWe follow her outside. Sheâs running down the steps of the palace, and\n\nthe prince is chasing after her. Sheâs in the front, Jonah and I are to her left,\n\nand the prince is behind us. Weâre a triangle on the move.\n\nP:39\n\nOn the bottom step, her glass slipper falls off, just like itâs supposed to.\n\nYes! We didnât mess anything up!\n\nShe glances back for a second, but sees the prince behind her and\n\ndoesnât stop moving.\n\nShe just goes, goes, GOES!\n\nâWait! Wait! WAIT!â the prince yells.\n\nI look behind and see that heâs stopped. He bends down and picks up\n\nthe slipper.\n\nJonah and I, however, keep on running.\n\nCinderella jumps into her coach and shouts, âGo, go, GO!â\n\nThe footmen and horses go, go, GO!\n\nâOh, no!â Jonah exclaims. âHow are we going to keep up on foot?â\n\nâRun,â I order. âFast, fast, FAST!â\n\nWe chase the coach down the block. Iâm huffing and puffing, and I\n\nreally need to do more exercise because I am not in very good shape and â\n\nI see a spark up ahead. Like someone is lighting a match.\n\nThe coach begins to glimmer. The horses are shaking. Something is\n\nhappening.\n\nKabam!\n\nThe coach is shrinking! The horses are shrinking! The footmen are\n\nshrinking!\n\nPoof!\n\nCinderella is sitting on her butt in the middle of the street next to a\n\nsquashed pumpkin.\n\nThe horses are mice. The footmen are lizards. The coachman is a rat.\n\nThe whole transformation only took about two seconds. I wish I had my\n\ndadâs video camera so I could put it on YouTube.\n\nJonah is standing beside me with his jaw wide open. âDid anyone else\n\nsee that? Someone else must have seen that!â\n\nI look around the empty moonlit street. Weâre the only witnesses.\n\nâOh well,â Cinderella says to herself. She looks nothing like the\n\nCinderella of two minutes ago. No wonder her own family didnât recognize\n\nP:40\n\nher. Her hair hangs around her shoulders, and sheâs no longer wearing any\n\nplatinum eye shadow or red lipstick or any makeup at all. Her dress is plain\n\nbrown. Her jewelry is gone, too. She stands up and brushes her dress off.\n\nShe takes off her right glass slipper and starts walking barefoot.\n\nâWhat do we do now?â Jonah asks.\n\nIsnât it obvious? âWe follow her home.â\n\nP:42\n\nWe follow her for the next thirty minutes, all the way to her house. Itâs a\n\ngood thing thereâs a full moon because this town doesnât have any\n\nstreetlights.\n\nWe keep a safe distance. We only whisper. We duck into the shadows\n\nwhenever Cinderella turns around. Weâre really good at this sneaky thing. I\n\nbet we could be spies when we grow up. Weâd be the cool brother-andsister team that gets to go to exotic places like New York or Japan to steal\n\nnuclear power secrets. Theyâll make a movie about us! Itâll be called â\n\nâWHY ARE YOU PEOPLE FOLLOWING ME?â\n\nOops.\n\nCinderella is glaring at us from her porch, her hands on her hips.\n\nâWeâre not following you,â I squeak.\n\nâUm, yes you are. You followed me all the way from the palace.â\n\nâNo, we ââ I stop in mid-sentence. We are following her. Iâm not sure\n\nwhat to say.\n\nâWe need to use your house,â Jonah says.\n\nâThereâs a public bathroom three blocks over,â Cinderella says.\n\nâNo, so we can go home,â I say.\n\nâWhat? Who are you?â\n\nâIâm Abby, and this is my brother, Jonah.â\n\nâDonât you have your own house?â she asks.\n\nâWe do, but we need to use yours to get back to it.â\n\nP:43\n\nâI donât understand,â she says. âAnyway, I canât let you in. My\n\nstepmother is really strict, and if I donât listen to her, I get into trouble.â\n\nâYour stepmother is still at the ball,â I say. âWeâll be in and out before\n\nshe gets home.â\n\nâYeah,â Jonah pipes up, âbut even if you did get into trouble, it wonât\n\nbe for long âcause youâre going to marry the prince!â\n\nHer eyes widen. âExcuse me?â\n\nUh-oh. âJonah, no!â\n\nJonah turns to me, cheeks reddening. âWhat? Was I not supposed to tell\n\nher?â\n\nCinderella steps down from the porch. âWhy would you say I was going\n\nto marry the prince?â\n\nâI donât see what the big deal is,â Jonah says to me. âWhy shouldnât she\n\nknow her future?â He grins at Cinderella. âYou were at the ball, right? You\n\ndanced with the prince and he thinks youâre the prettiest girl around. Youâre\n\ngoing to get married.â\n\nâBut â but I donât understand!â she sputters. âHow would he find me?\n\nHeâll never recognize me! Even my own stepmother and stepsisters didnât\n\nrecognize me!â\n\nI sigh. Since the cat is out of the bag, I guess thereâs no reason to keep it\n\nall a secret. âYou dropped your shoe, right? He picked it up. Tomorrow heâs\n\ngoing to make an announcement that heâs going to marry the person who\n\nfits the shoe. He sends his assistant to make every girl in the kingdom try it\n\non. It only fits you.â\n\nA slow smile spreads across Cinderellaâs face. âSeriously?â\n\nâSeriously,â I say. âYouâre going to be a princess â and then youâll get\n\nmarried and be his queen. Well, at first youâll just be a princess, but\n\neventually youâll get to be queen once his dad â¦ you know.â No need to be\n\nmorbid. âAnyway, my point is that even if your stepmother is ticked off at\n\nyou for a few days, it wonât matter in the long run.â\n\nâSquee!â Cinderella squeals. âThat is absolutely the best news ever. I\n\ncanât believe the prince picked up my slipper!â\n\nP:44\n\nâIt was lucky,â I say. It probably would have been luckier if the prince\n\nhad caught up with her, but who am I to judge?\n\nOne day Iâll be a judge. But not yet.\n\nâItâs also lucky that it only fits you,â Jonah says.\n\nâTheyâre perfectly molded to my feet.â She lifts the remaining shoe so\n\nthat itâs eye level. âSee?â\n\nAnd there it is. Right in front of me. The infamous glass slipper. âCan I\n\nhold it?â I ask breathlessly.\n\nâSure,â she says, and passes it to me.\n\nWhoa. Itâs heavier than I thought. And itâs really made of glass.\n\nCompletely see-through. It feels like Iâm holding one of my parentsâ forcompany-only wineglasses. But itâs a shoe. A really high-heeled shoe. Iâm\n\nnot sure how she even walked in them. And theyâre tiny, too. For an adult.\n\nOr an almost-adult, anyway â Iâm guessing sheâs about sixteen. The weird\n\nthing about the shoe? There are toe marks where the toes go. This shoe was\n\nperfectly molded to fit Cinderellaâs foot. I guess that makes sense for the\n\nstory â if they were just a size five, then other girls with size-five feet\n\ncould fit in them, too.\n\nI hand it back. I really donât want to drop it by accident.\n\nâWhy didnât the glass slipper disappear like the rest of the stuff?â Jonah\n\nasks.\n\nâMy fairy godmother changed the dress and coach and horses from\n\nsomething else,â Cinderella explains. âBut she gave me the shoes as a gift.\n\nThe slippers are made just for me, you know.â\n\nâHigh heels,â I say.\n\nâWhat?â\n\nI wave my hand. Never mind.\n\nâAnyway, how do you know whatâs going to happen to me?â Cinderella\n\nasks. âAre you some type of fairy?â\n\nâNo,â Jonah says. âBut weâre in a fairy tale.â\n\nShe scrunches her nose. âDoes that mean a fairy told you what happens\n\nto me?â\n\nP:45\n\nâWell â¦ kind of,â I say. A fairy tale told us what happened. Close\n\nenough. âCan we come in? We donât have much time. We need to get\n\nmoving before your family gets home.â\n\nâAll right,â Cinderella says, and unlocks the door.\n\nWe step into a fancy foyer. Not as fancy as the palace, but still fancy.\n\nThe tiles on the floor are checkerboard, black and white. Thereâs a big\n\ncouch, a love seat, chairs, a fireplace, and a wood grandfather clock up\n\nagainst the wall.\n\nThereâs a lit chandelier above us, and a big rectangular mirror right by\n\nthe entranceway.\n\nâLetâs try it,â I say. âCinderella, stand back. We definitely canât take\n\nyou home with us. That would mess up your life for sure.â\n\nJonah knocks. Once. Twice. Thrice! Nothing.\n\nBoo. âHow many other mirrors do you have in the house?â\n\nâMy stepmother has one in her room, and my stepsisters have two.\n\nThatâs it. But why do you need to use a mirror to get home? Where do you\n\nlive? I donât understand.â\n\nâNeither do we,â I say. âBut thatâs the way the magic works. Why do\n\nwe need a mirror to get home? Why did you have to leave the ball by\n\nmidnight?â\n\nâMagic is weird,â she says. âLetâs go.â\n\nOn the second floor, there are two rooms and another staircase.\n\nâWhereâs your room?â I ask Cinderella.\n\nShe points up. âThe attic. Letâs start in my stepmotherâs room.â She\n\nthrows the door open and motions to the large mirror by her bed.\n\nI knock. Once. Twice. Thrice!\n\nNothing.\n\nâArgh!â I say.\n\nThereâs a noise outside. Itâs a carriage.\n\nâLook who it is,â Cinderella says with a smirk. âMy stepmother and\n\nstepsisters returning from the ball. Wait until I tell them what you told me.â\n\nMy mouth goes dry. âNo, no, no. You canât say anything to them!â\n\nP:46\n\nâWhy not? You said itâs going to happen! Were you not telling me the\n\ntruth?â\n\nâI was telling you the truth, but who knows what will happen if you say\n\nsomething? What if they try to stop it? What if they mess something up?\n\nYou have to keep it a secret! Promise me youâll keep it a secret!â\n\nâOkay, okay,â she grumbles. âIf you think I have to.â\n\nâWe have to hurry,â Jonah says. âWe donât want them to see us, right?â\n\nâLetâs go. To the stepsistersâ room! One of those mirrors had better\n\nwork.â\n\nâAbby, what if they donât? How will we get home?â\n\nâI donât know!â\n\nLast chance. Here we go.\n\nP:48\n\nI can see in the moonlight that the room is all pink. Two pink beds, two\n\npink carpets, two pink desks, two pink wardrobes, and two pink pillows â\n\none embroidered with the name Kayla, the other with the name Beatrice.\n\nBut best of all: two full-sized pink-framed mirrors.\n\nI have a good feeling about these mirrors, I really do.\n\nJonah runs straight to Kaylaâs mirror. âMaybe they both work. We each\n\nget our own portal, how cool is that?â\n\nâDo you really think Iâd let you walk into a mirror by yourself?â I say.\n\nâWhat if you actually end up on Mars or something? Not happening. Letâs\n\njust choose one and go for it.â\n\nCinderella is looking out the window. âHurry! Theyâre getting out of the\n\ncoach! They wonât like this one bit! Last month they caught me napping in\n\nhere and they locked me in their closet for two hours!â\n\nI shiver. They sound awful. I take Jonahâs hand and knock. âOne â¦ two\n\nâ¦â\n\nAnd now for the final knock â¦\n\nâThree!â\n\nNothing.\n\nâCinderella, are you awake?â cries a voice from downstairs. âWhere are\n\nyou? Make us some tea!â\n\nOh, no! Theyâre home!\n\nAnd weâre still here.\n\nI hear the clomp-clomp-clomping of their walking around downstairs.\n\nP:49\n\nâI have to go,â Cinderella whispers urgently, and turns to leave the\n\nroom. âYou guys have to get out of here!â\n\nâWe will,â I say with more optimism than I feel. âThereâs still another\n\nmirror.â\n\nâBye, Cinderella!â Jonah says.\n\nâIt was nice to meet you,â I add.\n\nI grab Jonahâs hand. âThis mirror is going to work. It has to. Ready?\n\nOne â¦ two â¦â\n\nAnd now for another final knock â¦\n\nâThree!â\n\nStill nothing.\n\nThis is NOT good. Not good at all.\n\nI hear more clomping. Clomp-clomp-clomp coming up the stairs.\n\nThe sisters are going to walk into their room any moment. We need to\n\ndo something.\n\nWe need to hide.\n\nI signal to Jonah for him to slide under the bed. It looks like Iâm waving\n\nat him.\n\nâHuh?â he says.\n\nâShh! And donât say huh. Say excuse me.â\n\nâExcuse me, what are you doing with your hand?â\n\nClomp-clomp-clomp.\n\nâIâm trying to motion you to â Oh, forget it! Just slide under the bed!â\n\nHe nods and does it. Finally. I slide under Kaylaâs bed. The bed skirt\n\nreaches the floor, so unless they look for us, they wonât catch us. Ouch! I\n\njust scraped the top of my arm.\n\nWhat if they see us? What will we say? What will happen to us? Will\n\nthey call the fairy tale police? Will we go to fairy tale jail?\n\nThe room is suddenly lit up.\n\nâCinderella, were you in our room?â someone asks in a high nasal\n\nvoice. âOur door is open.â\n\nP:50\n\nâYes,â Cinderella calls back. âI was, um, cleaning up.â I hear footsteps\n\ncoming closer â not the clomp-clomp-clomp kind, but the dainty kind.\n\nCinderellaâs footsteps.\n\nâIs that what you did all night?â the same person says.\n\nâNo. I was pretty busy,â Cinderella says. I hear a smile in her voice.\n\nAt least sheâs not telling them the truth.\n\nI hear the window opening and feel a flush of cool air. âSo, tell me all\n\nabout the ball,â Cinderella says, and I detect a little bit of an edge to her\n\nvoice. âDid either of you get to talk with Prince Jordan this time?â\n\nHmm. That wasnât very nice. She knows neither of them got to talk to\n\nthe prince. She danced with him the whole time. Is Cinderella rubbing it in?\n\nâKayla got to talk to him,â the same person â must be Beatrice â\n\nsays.\n\nâReally?â Cinderella says. âI didnât â¦ I mean, thatâs nice. So what\n\nhappened?â\n\nâThe beautiful stranger showed up again and interrupted them,â\n\nBeatrice says.\n\nâReally?â Cinderella says again.\n\nâI heard she was a princess,â Kayla says.\n\nâShe wasnât a princess,â Beatrice says. âWeâd have heard about her if\n\nshe was a princess. I bet she was an heiress. Those clothes were expensive.â\n\nâThe prince danced with her the rest of the night,â Kayla says. âAgain. I\n\nwas really hoping she wouldnât show tonight.â\n\nâReeealllly? The prince danced with the beautiful stranger? And thatâs\n\nwhy he stopped talking to you? How sad for you!â\n\nI put two and two together and realize that the ordinary-looking girl we\n\nsaw talking to the prince was Kayla. Also, is it just me, or is Cinderella\n\nbeing mean?\n\nâYes,â Kayla says, âit was pretty sad.â She sits down on her bed, and\n\nthe mattress sags so that itâs an inch from my face.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nP:51\n\nIf she bounces, sheâs going to break my nose. DO NOT BOUNCE,\n\nKAYLA. DO NOT BOUNCE.\n\nI hope sheâs not a bed jumper. I think back to all the times Jonah and I\n\nhave jumped on our beds. What if there were kids from other dimensions\n\nhiding under our bed skirts and I had no idea?\n\nMy nose tingles.\n\nDo not sneeze. Abby, whatever you do, DO NOT SNEEZE.\n\nâPrince Jordan was obsessed with the beautiful stranger,â Beatrice says.\n\nâHeâs in love with her, surely. How could he not be? Sheâs gorgeous.â\n\nAh-ah-ah â\n\nDonât-donât-donât â¦ I squeak a sneeze.\n\nâDid you hear something?â Beatrice asks. âWe better not have another\n\nmouse problem. Anyway, guess what happened at the end of the night?â\n\nâI have no idea,â Cinderella says. âDid Prince Jordan ask Kayla to\n\ndance?â\n\nI can practically see Cinderella batting her eyelashes all fake-innocently.\n\nâNo,â Kayla squeaks.\n\nâDid he ask you to dance, Beatrice?â\n\nâNo,â Beatrice huffs.\n\nâI give up,â Cinderella says.\n\nâWhen the clock struck midnight, the beautiful stranger made a run for\n\nit. And no one could find her.â\n\nâNo way,â Cinderella drawls.\n\nWay.\n\nâThe prince ran after her and found her glass slipper! It fell off while\n\nshe was running, surely.â\n\nâYes, it did,â Cinderella says. Then she clears her throat. âIt did?â\n\nâYes,â Beatrice says, âAnd the prince is determined to find her. Heâll be\n\nable to, surely.â\n\nSurely, surely, surely. Sheâs such a know-it-all.\n\nâI think Iâll let you guys go to sleep,â Cinderella says. âOr maybe\n\nyouâre not that tired. It doesnât sound like you did much dancing.â\n\nP:52\n\nYup, that was definitely mean.\n\nShe closes the door behind her. Uh-oh. She thinks we made it through\n\nthe mirror. She thinks weâre gone. And now weâre stuck in the stepsistersâ\n\nroom! Argh!\n\nI hear some shuffling on the bed above me. And then I hear â¦ crying?\n\nWhy is one of the evil stepsisters crying? Theyâre supposed to be evil,\n\nnot sad.\n\nThe crying is coming from directly on top of me. It must be Kayla. The\n\none who was talking with the prince.\n\nâWhat on earth is wrong with you?â Beatrice asks.\n\nâI just thought â¦ I thought the prince might have liked me. I thought\n\nwe had a connection.â\n\nâOh, please. What did you expect? You canât compete with a girl like\n\nthat. Get real. Youâre just not pretty enough.â\n\nMy stomach hurts, and itâs not from the pigs/dogs-in-a-blanket. I canât\n\nhelp but feel bad for Kayla. I know sheâs supposed to be evil and all, but\n\nshe seems to really like Prince Jordan. And no one wants to like someone\n\nwho doesnât like them back.\n\nâJust go to sleep,â Beatrice says, and the lights go back out.\n\nOkay, at least theyâre going to sleep. Once theyâre out cold, Jonah and I\n\ncan sneak out. They must be exhausted. Itâs well after midnight, their time\n\nat least. I have no idea what time it is at home, which is a little bit scary. Iâm\n\nhoping time works the same way it did in Snow White â about one fairy\n\ntale day for every hour at home. Which means itâs only about twelve thirty\n\nat home.\n\nWe just have to get home before Mom and Dad wake up, around seven.\n\nNothing I can do now. Nothing but wait.\n\nAnd wait some more. When I finally hear not one but three sets of\n\nsnoring, I decide itâs safe to make a move.\n\nI pull myself out from under the bed with my elbows and crawl over to\n\nJonah. âCome on,â I whisper. When he doesnât answer I give him a poke.\n\nâWhat?â He jumps and hits his head on the mattress. âOuch.â\n\nP:53\n\nI shush him. When the sisters donât react, I motion to Jonah to follow\n\nme out the door.\n\nI make the motion very, very clear.\n\nHe lifts his eyebrows, not getting it.\n\nâJust follow me,â I whisper, and roll my eyes. I carefully open the door.\n\nCreeeak.\n\nWe step into the hallway. Phewf!\n\nThe stepmomâs door is closed. Guess sheâs asleep. How mean â she\n\ndidnât even say good night to her daughters. I might be running out of\n\nunderwear, but no matter how busy my parents are, they always come into\n\nour rooms to say good night.\n\nâWhat do we do now?â Jonah whispers.\n\nâI guess we go to sleep,â I say. âMaybe Cinderella can help us find the\n\nright mirror tomorrow.â\n\nâBut where will we sleep?â\n\nI point to the winding stairs. âThe attic. Cinderellaâs room.â\n\nWhen we reach the door, Jonah asks, âShould we knock?â\n\nâUm, yeah.â Now if heâd only knock on my door at home.\n\nâBut what if she gets scared?â\n\nâSheâs probably already asleep,â I say. âHopefully, she has a couch up\n\nthere we can curl up on. So I wonât knock.â\n\nI turn the handle and quietly open the door. Cinderella is standing in the\n\nmiddle of the room, admiring the glass slipper.\n\nâHi,â I say. âGlad youâre still up.â\n\nStartled, she jumps. As she jumps, the glass slipper slips from her hands\n\nand drops directly onto her left foot.\n\nâOWW!â she screams. âOw, ow, ow!â\n\nâAre you okay?â I ask, hurrying over to her.\n\nâDo I look okay?â she snarls, holding onto her foot and hobbling over\n\nto a chair. âThat really killed. You guys scared me. I thought you were\n\ngone!â\n\nâThe mirror didnât work,â I say.\n\nP:54\n\nâOw, ow, ow. That landed right on my foot.â\n\nâIâm so sorry,â I tell her. âDo you want some ice?â\n\nâItâll be okay. Just give me a sec. Ouch.â She closes her eyes. âOnly\n\nanother day or so and then Iâm outta here, right?â\n\nâRight,â I say. âAgain, sorry.â\n\nâCan you bring me the slipper? Did it break?â\n\nI look for the slipper on the ground and gulp when I see it. The heel has\n\ncracked off. In one hand, Iâm holding a four-inch heel, in the other a flat\n\nglass boat. âIt doesnât look so good,â I admit.\n\nHer eyes fly open. âOh, boo,â Cinderella says. âThat isnât going to mess\n\nanything up, is it? The shoe being broken?â\n\nâIt shouldnât,â I say, but Iâm not so sure. âNo â you have to try on the\n\nshoe the guy brings â at least, thatâs the way I remember it.â\n\nâThe way you remember what the fairy told you?â\n\nâUm, yeah. Right.â I look around the room for a safe place to put the\n\nslightly broken shoe and rest it on top of the only shelf next to a tin bucket.\n\nâOh well.â She closes her eyes again. âIâm really tired. And my foot\n\nreally hurts. Like really hurts.â\n\nâIt will feel better in the morning,â Jonah says with a yawn. âThatâs\n\nwhat my mom always says.â\n\nâThen letâs go to sleep,â Cinderella says. âI have to be up in a few hours\n\nto make breakfast.â\n\nâWhereâs your bed?â\n\nâI donât have one â I just sleep on the straw on the floor.â\n\nâThat stinks,â Jonah says. âYou really need a mattress.â\n\nâIâll get one when Iâm a princess,â she says with a sigh.\n\nâYouâll get as many as you want when youâre a princess,â I tell her.\n\nâYou can have a whole stack of them. Like The Princess and the Pea!â\n\nâThe who and the what?â she asks.\n\nI shake my head. âNever mind.â\n\nâI hate peas,â she adds.\n\nâForget I even mentioned them.â\n\nP:55\n\nâTomorrow,â Cinderella says wistfully, âIâll be a princess.â\n\nâAnd weâll find our way home,â Jonah adds.\n\nâEverything will work out tomorrow,â I say.\n\nWe each gather up some straw and mold it into beds. Itâs a little\n\nscratchy. Actually, a lot scratchy.\n\nWell, at least Iâm already in my pajamas.\n\nP:57\n\nI wake up to the sound of screaming.\n\nâMy foot! Ouch, my foot! What happened to my foot?â\n\nI bolt upright to see Cinderella clutching her left foot and howling.\n\nâWhatâs wrong?â I ask.\n\nâMy foot is wrong! Look at it!â She thrusts it in my face.\n\nI have never seen a foot quite like this.\n\nIt is black.\n\nIt is blue.\n\nHer toes are the size of marshmallows and the entire thing is bloated.\n\nIs it a foot or a balloon?\n\nâIs that from dropping the glass slipper on it?â Jonah asks.\n\nâNo, itâs from playing the piano with my toes,â she replies sarcastically.\n\nâOf course itâs from dropping the glass slipper on it! Itâs completely\n\nswollen. And it hurts!â\n\nI shake my head. âI knew we should have put ice on it.â\n\nShe tries to stand up, but then grimaces and falls back down onto the\n\nstraw. âHow am I supposed to do my chores? I can barely stand.â\n\nâCinderella! Cinderella! Where are you? Are you still sleeping?â yells a\n\nvoice from downstairs.\n\nâOh, no,â Cinderella wails. âThatâs Betty! My stepmother! I must have\n\noverslept! I have to make breakfast!â\n\nExcuse me for a second. Betty? Her stepmotherâs name is Betty? That\n\ndoesnât sound right. Betty sounds like a nana. Or someone who bakes\n\nP:58\n\ncakes. It doesnât sound like an evil stepmother.\n\nCinderella tries to stand up again, but she winces as she puts weight on\n\nher foot. âI need to get dressed. And you two need to get out of here. Iâm\n\nnot allowed to have guests.â\n\nâWhere are we supposed to go?â I ask. âWe have to find the mirror that\n\ntakes us home.â\n\nâYou tried all the mirrors here,â Cinderella says. âGo try other ones.â\n\nâBut we donât know where else to go!â I say. âIf the mirrors here donât\n\nwork and the mirrors at the palace donât work, which mirrors will?â\n\nCinderella shakes her head. âI am not a mirror expert!â She hobbles\n\nover to the closet, opens the door, and stands behind it for privacy. When\n\nshe closes it again, sheâs wearing a long-sleeved gray dress. âNow where\n\ndid I put my shoes?â\n\nâYour glass slipper?â Jonah asks.\n\nâNo, my work shoes. There they are.â She spots a pair of loafer-like\n\nshoes at the door and limps toward them. She slides the right one on, no\n\nproblem, and then tries to put on the left shoe. âOh, crow, my foot is too\n\nswollen. I canât get the shoe on. Iâm going to have to go barefoot.â\n\nUh-oh.\n\nI steal a look at the broken glass slipper thatâs lying by the wall. Itâs the\n\nright shoe.\n\nWhich means the prince has the left shoe.\n\nIf the loafer doesnât fit her left foot, then the glass slipper wonât, either.\n\nCrumbs.\n\nIf the glass slipper doesnât fit Cinderella, she isnât going to be able to\n\nprove sheâs the girl the prince danced with at the ball. They wonât get\n\nmarried. Sheâll be stuck here forever.\n\nI look at Jonah. He looks at me. He knows. He knows I know.\n\nWe did it again. We landed in a fairy tale and we messed things up.\n\nNow what?\n\nâUh-oh,â Jonah says. âHer foot is a basketball.â\n\nâEveryone shush!â I say. âI need to think. We need to fix this.â\n\nP:59\n\nCinderella waves her hand in the air. âFix what? I feel like thereâs\n\nsomething youâre not telling me here. Can you fill me in?â\n\nI really donât want to.\n\nâYour foot isnât going to fit the glass slipper,â Jonah blurts out.\n\nâIt wonât fit today,â I say. âWeâll take her to a doctor. Or it could still\n\nheal in time. We donât know when the prince is coming. Maybe heâs not\n\ncoming for another week. Her foot wonât stay like this forever. Itâll heal. Itâs\n\nprobably not broken. Itâs probably just a sprain.â\n\nâAbby,â Jonah calls out pointing to the wall. âItâs okay! Look!â Heâs\n\npointing at the slightly broken slipper on the shelf. âWe can show the\n\nprinceâs assistant that one. Cinderella will try it on her good foot and it will\n\nfit and our problem is solved.â\n\nOh! Yay! âJonah, youâre right! Shoe problem solved!â\n\nâCinderella!â the voice from downstairs yells. Itâs getting closer. âYou\n\nmissed breakfast! We had to butter our own bread and brew our own tea!\n\nWhere are you?â\n\nâIâm coming!â Cinderella calls. âItâs my stepmother!â she hisses to us.\n\nâShe canât come in here! Sheâll see you!â\n\nâCinderella, Iâm coming in,â the voice says.\n\nâHide!â Cinderella whispers to us, her eyes wide with fear.\n\nI look around the room. Hide where? There is nowhere to hide! There is\n\njust straw! No beds! No curtains! No nothing.\n\nOh, wait. Thereâs the closet. We can hide in there. Weâll be super quiet.\n\nShe wonât even notice us! Weâll be invisible! Like mice! Instead of\n\nbothering to motion to Jonah, I jump up, grab his arm, and hustle toward the\n\ncloset.\n\nWe can make it! We can make it!\n\nThe door to Cinderellaâs room swings opens just as Jonah and I are\n\nscrambling into the closet. Iâm about to close the closet door behind us\n\nwhen â Bam! Jonah bumps his head into my back, I lose my balance, I fall\n\nagainst the wall, I extend out my arms try to stop myself from crashing to\n\nP:60\n\nthe floor, I knock over the tin bucket thatâs sitting on the shelf â and clang!\n\nSmash!\n\nThe tin bucket knocks over the only-slightly broken glass slipper. The\n\nonly-slightly broken glass slipper crashes to the floor and smashes into a\n\nmillion pieces. Itâs now a VERY broken glass slipper.\n\nCrumbs.\n\nShoe problem unsolved.\n\nP:62\n\nCinderella, what are you doing ââ Betty stops in mid-sentence. âExcuse\n\nme! Young man! Young lady in the Floom flag! Who are you people?â\n\nSheâs taller than I expected. Taller than Kayla. And scarier. Sheâs\n\nwearing a long brown skirt and a tucked-in green blouse. She has thick\n\nstraight gray hair that falls past her shoulders, straight bangs across her\n\nforehead, a narrow nose, thin lips, and beady brown eyes.\n\nBetty definitely does not look like a Betty. A Betty would smile at me\n\nand offer me milk and cookies. Or maybe some brownies. A Betty would\n\nnever glare at me like I was some sort of cockroach dashing across her\n\nfloor.\n\nThink fast, Abby, think fast. Why are we here? I know! When in doubt,\n\nbe polite! âHi,â I say. âItâs so nice to finally meet you.â\n\nâIt is?â Jonah and Cinderella both ask.\n\nâJinx,â Jonah calls.\n\nBetty takes a step closer to me. âWho are you?â\n\nâIâm Abby,â I say, âand this is my brother, Jonah.â\n\nâWeâre from Smithville,â Jonah adds.\n\nBetty frowns. âAnd you are here, why?â\n\nâBe-because â¦â Hmm. Long-lost cousins? I glance back at the bucket\n\nthat unsolved my shoe problem and get an idea. âWeâre Cinderellaâs\n\nreplacements!â\n\nBetty clicks her tongue. âDo tell, why are we replacing Cinderella? Is\n\nshe going somewhere?â\n\nP:63\n\nâAs a matter of fact I am,â Cinderella says haughtily. âI am going to ââ\n\nOh, no! She canât mention the prince! âSheâs going to need help ââ I\n\ninterject while pinching Cinderellaâs arm.\n\nâOw!â\n\nââ since she busted her foot. Weâre not really replacements,â I add.\n\nâWeâre more like helpers.â\n\nBettyâs beady brown eyes nearly bug out of her head at the sight of the\n\noverstuffed toes. âHow did that happen?â\n\nâWell,â Cinderella begins. âLast night I dropped a glass sl ââ\n\nNooooooo! âSled,â I interject, pinching her again. âShe dropped a glass\n\nsled on her foot.â Oops. That just came out.\n\nâWhat is a glass sled?â Betty asks.\n\nâYou know,â I say, stalling. âA sled. For sledding?â\n\nâDown a hill!â Jonah adds. âI love sleds! We have one at home! Itâs\n\nwood, though. But I bet glass ones are slippier.â\n\nâYes,â I say. âExactly. Much slippier.â I really canât believe the words\n\nthat are coming out of my mouth.\n\nâBut thereâs no snow outside. Where was she using a sled?â Betty asks.\n\nâAnd where did she get it?â\n\nRight. Good points. âShe found it in the neighborâs trash,â I say. âNow\n\nwe know why they were throwing it away. Dangerous things, these glass\n\nsleds. Especially when used down staircases.â\n\nBetty stares at me.\n\nâObviously she would have used it outside if thereâd been snow,â I add.\n\nâBut there isnât.â That kind of makes sense, doesnât it?\n\nDo I sound as ridiculous as I think I do? Cinderella is bright red. Jonah\n\nis twisting his bottom lip. So yeah, I probably do.\n\nBetty scans the attic. âThen where is said sled now?â\n\nSheâs got me there. No. No, no, no. I will not let her win this! Where is\n\nthe glass sled now? I know! âAfter it busted Cinderellaâs foot, I had to\n\nthrow it out. Like the neighbors did. Wise people, those neighbors.â\n\nP:64\n\nJonah wags his finger like heâs talking to a dog. âBad sled. Bad, bad\n\nsled.â\n\nâBut how did you two end up here?â Betty asks.\n\nHow did we end up here? Good question. Iâm guessing that the magic\n\nmirror explanation isnât something I should share.\n\nâShe delivered the newspaper,â Cinderella offers.\n\nWay to go, Cindy! âYes!â I cheer. âI was delivering the newspaper.\n\nExactly. And I heard Cinderella scream when she landed at the bottom of\n\nthe staircase.â\n\nâThat makes no sense. Why is her foot swollen? You donât get swollen\n\nfeet from falling down the stairs. You get a broken back or a concussion or\n\nââ\n\nâUm, because when she picked up the sled to throw it out, she dropped\n\nit on her foot.â There. Whew. âAnd then she screamed a second time, and I\n\ncame running in. Your door was unlocked, by the way. Not a safe practice.â\n\nOh, Iâm good! âShe told me she had chores to do, so I offered to help her\n\nuntil she gets better.â\n\nBetty looks at me suspiciously. âWhere are the rest of the newspapers?â\n\nâWe gave them out,â I say quickly. âAnd then we came back.â\n\nBetty throws up her hands. âBut why are you helping her? Whatâs she\n\ngiving you in return?â\n\nâWeâre helping her because weâre nice,â Jonah says. âWe donât mind.\n\nThatâs what nice people do. They help each other.â\n\nBettyâs beady brown eyes narrow. Sheâs not buying it. She doesnât\n\nunderstand what nice is! I need to speak her language. âAlso,â I add, âsheâs\n\nteaching us to speak English.â\n\nBetty raises an overly penciled-in and slightly uneven eyebrow. âIt\n\nsounds to me like you already know how to speak English.â\n\nâSheâs teaching us to speak gooder,â Jonah pipes up.\n\nâCinderella is a â¦ a â¦ a â¦ dortun jombi,â I say. âThatâs means âgood\n\nteacherâ in Smithvillian. Thatâs the language we speak in Smithville. Also\n\nââ\n\nP:65\n\nâOkay, I donât care,â Betty says, looking bored. âIf you want to help\n\nCinderella while her foot is out of commission, knock yourself out. Weâre\n\ngoing to be busy, anyway. Since you delivered the paper, I assume youâve\n\nall read the news?â\n\nâAbsolutely,â I say, nodding. âCan you just remind us what it says?â\n\nâOnly that the prince has announced that he will marry whoever fits the\n\nglass slipper he found at the ball. His assistant will begin to visit all the\n\nhouseholds in the kingdom later today. So you three had better get started\n\ncleaning the house. Start in here. Thereâs glass all over the floor.â\n\nOh, no! Today already?\n\nI look at Cinderellaâs foot.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nâWe have a relamo,â Jonah says, after Betty leaves.\n\nâA what?â I ask.\n\nâRelamo is Smithvillian for problem,â he says.\n\nHardy har har.\n\nP:67\n\nWhat are we going to do?â I ask.\n\nâThis really is a relamo,â Cinderella says, frowning. âIf the princeâs\n\nassistant comes today, my foot is definitely not going to fit in the glass\n\nslipper.â\n\nâRight,â I say.\n\nâWhat should the Smithvillian word for âtroubleâ be?â Jonah asks.\n\nâDessinsty?â\n\nâJonah,â I say. âTry to focus.â\n\nâMaybe he wonât come today,â Cinderella says wistfully. âMaybe heâll\n\ncome tomorrow.â\n\nI check out the state of Cinderellaâs foot. âI donât think itâs fitting\n\ntomorrow, either.â\n\nâSo what do I do?â she asks. âI need it to fit!â\n\nâYou could always cut off one of your toes,â Jonah says. âLike in the\n\nGrimm story.â\n\nCinderella gasps. âThat is, indeed, a grim story.â\n\nâJonah, thatâs disgusting!â I say.\n\nâI was just kidding,â he says. âThat would hurt. Although it would be\n\nreally cool.â\n\nThere has to be a solution. âOh! I know!â I say. Itâs so easy! âYou have\n\na fairy godmother, right?â\n\nCinderella nods.\n\nâSo ask her to fix it! Thatâs what sheâs there for. To fix things.â\n\nP:68\n\nâI guess I could do that,â Cinderella says.\n\nâHow do you get her to come?â Jonah asks. âDo you just call her?â\n\nâCall her? Yes! Exactly. I call her name and she comes.â Cinderella tilts\n\nher head toward the chimney, âFarrah! Farrah! Yoo-hoo, you there?â\n\nâSheâs like Santa!â Jonah says.\n\nA second later, a big puff of yellow is sparkling in the center of the\n\nroom. Then the sparkle slowly trickles to the ground, and I see her â the\n\nlegendary fairy godmother.\n\nShe is not what I expected. I thought sheâd be plump.\n\nBut sheâs not. Instead, sheâs super skinny. And she has big wide eyes\n\nthat are green and smiling. Her hair is wild and curly and perched on her\n\nhead in a loose bun. Instead of wearing a twirly dress, sheâs wearing black\n\nleggings and a yellow sweater. Sheâs like a human bumblebee. Or not\n\nhuman, exactly. Are fairies human? At least I think sheâs a fairy. I donât see\n\nany wings. Sheâs holding a yellow-and-black swirly wand that looks like a\n\ncandy cane. If candy canes were yellow and black.\n\nâYouâre the fairy godmother?â Jonah blurts out.\n\nâI am. And you must be Abby and Jonah.â\n\nâHow did you know?â I ask.\n\nShe laughs. âWord gets around. So, Cinderella, what can I do for you?â\n\nâYou need to fix her foot,â I say. âItâs busted. Itâs never going to fit the\n\nglass slipper the way it is now. And if it doesnât fit the glass slipper, then\n\nshe wonât be able to marry the prince.â\n\nFarrah looks at Cinderella. âIs that what you want? To marry the\n\nprince?â\n\nâOf course thatâs what I want!â Cinderella says. âWhy do you think I\n\nwanted to go to the balls? For the pigs-in-a-blanket? I need the prince to\n\nrescue me and get me out of this place.â\n\nFarrah blinks. And then blinks again. âExcuse me?â\n\nâI need him to rescue me,â she repeats. âMarrying him will save me\n\nfrom this miserable life.â\n\nP:69\n\nâAnd if you donât mind,â I pipe in, âcan you please direct us to the\n\nnearest magic mirror? We need to get home. Thank you for your time.â\n\nThis is perfect. All of our problems will be solved with one burst of\n\nyellow sparkle! Farrah will fix Cinderellaâs foot and then send us home\n\nwith a poof.\n\nFarrah crosses her arms. âNo.â\n\nâExqueeze me?â Did I hear her right?\n\nâNo,â she repeats.\n\nCinderella blinks. And then blinks again. âI donât understand. Why\n\nnot?â\n\nâFirst of all, I donât like being told what to do,â Farrah says, glaring at\n\nall of us. âAnd second, Cinderella, I donât like this attitude of yours. Not\n\none bit. You need to learn to rescue yourself! You need to learn to stand on\n\nyour own two feet!â\n\nâBut my foot feels broken!â Cinderella whines. âI canât stand at all!â\n\nâWell, youâd better learn. You canât rely on a prince to save you. You\n\nhave to be self-reliant!â\n\nâWhatâs self-reliant?â Jonah asks.\n\nâIt means relying on yourself,â I explain.\n\nâIâm self-reliant,â he says.\n\nI snort. âPlease. You donât even make your own bed.â\n\nâDoes that mean youâre not going to fix my foot today?â Cinderella\n\nasks meekly.\n\nâI am not going to fix your foot today,â the fairy godmother says. I canât\n\nbelieve how mean Farrah is being. None of the fairy tale versions\n\nmentioned this!\n\nâWe really need you to fix Cinderellaâs foot today,â I say. âIf the slipper\n\ndoesnât fit, we wonât be able to prove that Cinderellaâs the right girl! Isnât\n\nthat why you sent her to the ball in the first place? So she could snag the\n\nprince?â\n\nâNoooo,â Farrah says. âI sent her so she could have a night out on the\n\ntown!â\n\nP:70\n\nâYou never thought that the prince might fall in love with her?â I ask.\n\nâIâm fine with the prince falling in love with her â I just donât want her\n\nto be so needy about it.â Farrah shakes her head at Cinderella. âYouâre not\n\nmy only charge, you know. Iâm the princeâs fairy godmother, too. Iâve\n\nknown him since he was a baby â no way do I want him getting stuck with\n\na whiny damsel in distress. He needs a partner in his life. After all, a queen\n\nmust be strong. If you can prove to me you wonât be hanging on to his\n\nshirttails, Iâll help you snag him. Got it? Show me you can stand on your\n\nown two feet and Iâll fix your foot. Iâm willing to help you â but only if\n\nyou help yourself first.â\n\nâBut it will be too late!â I say. âThe princeâs assistant is on his way\n\nnow!â\n\nâThe assistant is at the other end of the kingdom. He wonât make it here\n\nuntil Tuesday afternoon. Iâll give you until Tuesday at noon to call for me\n\nand prove your self-reliance. Itâs Sunday morning. You have two and a half\n\ndays. Make them count.â\n\nBut â but â but â¦ âWait! Farrah? What about us? Can you help us\n\nfind a magic mirror so we can go home?â I ask.\n\nItâs too late. Sheâs gone in a puff of sparkle.\n\nP:72\n\nThereâs no time for brainstorming ideas. We have to get right to work.\n\nCinderella hobbles around the kitchen cleaning up the breakfast dishes\n\nwhile Jonah and I sweep the living room.\n\nMore precisely, I hold the dustpan while Jonah attempts to sweep.\n\nHe is the worst sweeper ever. Heâs just running around with the broom,\n\nswishing it in every direction. I think he might be making the dust worse\n\nthan it was before.\n\nâFocus, Jonah, focus!â\n\nHe sweeps a piece of dirt into my mouth.\n\nâJonah!â I say with a spit.\n\nâSorry,â he says, but heâs laughing so I donât really believe him.\n\nHis face turns serious and he twists his bottom lip. âAbby, how are we\n\ngoing to get home?â\n\nâI, um, have a plan,â I say. Although to be honest, I donât have a plan\n\nyet. Iâm making it up right now. But I think itâs important for Jonah to trust\n\nthat I always have a plan. Itâs my job as the big sister.\n\nâYeah?â he says. âWhat is it?â\n\nâOh. Right. Well â¦â\n\nâYou donât have a plan, do you?â\n\nâI do, I do! We help Cinderella prove to Farrah that she can be selfreliant before noon on Tuesday.â\n\nâWhat is it about twelve oâclock in fairy tales?â Jonah asks. âWhether\n\nitâs noon or midnight, something always happens at twelve.â\n\nP:73\n\nâThat is true. I donât know why. So back to my plan. How about this â\n\nwhen Farrah comes back sheâll be so amazed by the new and improved\n\nCinderella that sheâll happily tell us where the magic mirror is.â\n\nâBut what if she doesnât know where it is?â\n\nâShe must know,â I declare. âAt the very least, she could zap us home\n\nherself. She does have a magic wand.â\n\nHe nods. âOkay. Decent plan.â\n\nI hear footsteps in the hallway. Itâs Beatrice, the meaner sister. She\n\nlooks a lot like her mother. Exact same thin nose and lips, exact same\n\nstraight hair and bangs. Except hers is brown instead of gray. And sheâs the\n\ntallest of the three.\n\nâWhy are you two here?â she asks.\n\nâWeâre here to help Cinderella.â\n\nâGood. Go help her with the wash. Iâm low on underwear.â\n\nThat makes two of us.\n\nâUh, okay.â\n\nâKayla!â Beatrice yells up the stairs. âDo you need Cinderella to do\n\nyour wash?â\n\nâYeah,â Kayla calls back.\n\nâThe hampers are in our closet,â Beatrice tells us. âWeâre going to visit\n\nfriends now. Surely youâll see to it that the laundry is done by today so itâll\n\nbe all ready for tomorrow. The princeâs assistant is coming, you know.â\n\nâFine.â Must be a really slow washing machine.\n\nI go upstairs. The stepsistersâ door is closed so I knock. After what\n\nhappened with Cinderella, I will never not knock again.\n\nâCome in,â I hear.\n\nKayla is lying facedown on her bed.\n\nâHi, Kayla,â I say. âIâm just getting your laundry.â\n\nShe turns her face toward me. âHow do you know my name? Have we\n\nmet?â\n\nWell, I saw you fawning over the prince at the ball and then spied on\n\nyou from under your bed. But no, technically, we havenât met. âYouâre\n\nP:74\n\nBeatriceâs sister, right?â\n\nâYes.â\n\nâWeâre helping Cinderella out while her foot heals,â I say. âWeâre going\n\nto do your laundry and then make you dinner.â\n\nShe nods. âOkay,â she says, and then turns her head the other way.\n\nâItâs nice to meet you, too,â I say sarcastically.\n\nShe doesnât bother to answer.\n\nI bump Kaylaâs hamper down the stairs. âCinderella?â I ask, popping\n\nmy head into the kitchen.\n\nBut sheâs already done cleaning the kitchen and has managed to sweep\n\nand dustpan the entire marble entranceway by herself.\n\nOn one foot.\n\nSheâs a cleaning machine.\n\nâWow,â I say.\n\nâYes?â she asks.\n\nâWhereâs the washer and dryer?â I ask.\n\nâThe what?â\n\nâThe washer and dr ââ I stop in mid-sentence. âDo you guys not have\n\na washer and dryer?â\n\nâIâm the washer and dryer,â she answers. âI wash the clothes by hand,\n\nthen hang them up to dry.â\n\nYikes. Even if my parents never bother using it, I have never felt more\n\nthankful for our washer and dryer in my entire life.\n\nCinderella and I are on all fours washing her stepsistersâ clothes in the tub\n\nin the basement. At least they have running water in Floom, otherwise weâd\n\nbe standing on a riverbank.\n\nIâm soaping, Cinderella is rinsing, and Jonah is hanging. We have a\n\nwhole production line going on. Next weâre ironing wrinkled dresses.\n\nCinderella is going to show me how to use the ironing board and\n\neverything.\n\nP:75\n\nâI donât understand what Farrah wants from me,â Cinderella says.\n\nâHow can I rescue myself?â\n\nâLetâs think about it,â I say. âYou said you were stuck here, right?â\n\nâI am stuck here. I have nowhere else to go.â\n\nâBut youâre not chained to the house,â I say. âYou can leave if you want\n\nto.â\n\nâWhereâs your dad?â Jonah asks. âIs he dead?â\n\nâHeâs not dead,â Cinderella says. âHeâs just gone.â\n\nâGone where?â\n\nâJust gone. He left us. He left me. My momâs death was just too much\n\nfor him.â\n\nâBut he got married again,â I say.\n\nâI think he just wanted to find a place for me to live, since I was only\n\ntwelve. And once he did â he took off. We used to get postcards, but we\n\nhavenât heard from him in three years.â\n\nâThatâs terrible!â Jonah says. âI canât believe a dad would do that.â\n\nâHeâs a sailor,â Cinderella says. âAnd he sailed away. I doubt Iâll ever\n\nsee him again. And he left me here. Stranded. I have no money and\n\nnowhere to go. Thatâs why I need the prince to rescue me.â\n\nâWhy donât you get a job?â I say, rinsing a pair of striped socks. âThen\n\nyouâll have your own money and you can get your own house.â\n\nâBut sheâs going to move into the palace when she gets married,â Jonah\n\nsays. âShe doesnât need her own house.â\n\nâShe wonât get to marry the prince if Farrah doesnât fix her foot,â I\n\nargue. âAnd Farrah wonât help unless Cinderella helps herself. If Cinderella\n\ngets a job and moves out, it should prove to Farrah that she can be selfreliant. But if Farrah gets all weird and says itâs not enough, at least this\n\nway Cinderella wonât be stuck here anymore. Itâs a no-lose plan!â\n\nCinderella cocks her head to the side. âBut what kind of job could I get?\n\nIâm not good at anything.â\n\nâThatâs not true,â I say. âYouâre the worldâs fastest cleaner. You tidied\n\nthat whole living room in forty-five seconds flat.â\n\nP:76\n\nâYou could be a cleaning lady!â Jonah says.\n\nâWe need to think bigger,â I say, my eyes widening. âYou could start a\n\ncleaning service! You could train a whole bunch of cleaners to clean\n\nsuperfast like you do and then send them out to peopleâs houses! You taught\n\nus to clean; you can teach other people, too! Youâll start a company. Youâll\n\nmake a fortune. You can call it â¦ Mess Be Gone. No wait, Cinderellaâs\n\nCleaners!â I pump my arm in the air, feeling proud of myself. I am a big fan\n\nof alliteration. Although I donât remember if alliteration has to be the same\n\nfirst letter or the same first sound. Whatever. Itâs still cute. From now on\n\nmaybe I should go by Awesome Abby.\n\nCinderella shudders. âNo way. I hate cleaning. I do it so fast so I can be\n\ndone with it. I donât want to clean other peopleâs houses for money. I donât\n\nwant to clean this house, and if I had my own place, I wouldnât want to\n\nclean that, either. If I had my own money, Iâd hire Cinderellaâs Cleaners.â\n\nâThey probably wouldnât use your name if you werenât part of the\n\ncompany,â Jonah points out.\n\nCinderella nods. âTrue.â\n\nIâm pretty sure sheâs missing an excellent business opportunity, but\n\nwhatever. I think harder. âWhat about something with animals?â I say.\n\nâArenât you really good with mice?â\n\nâFarrah is good with mice, not me. Actually, Iâm not all that great with\n\nany animal. Plus, Iâm allergic to dogs. They give me a terrible cough and\n\nmake me sneeze. Cats, too.â\n\nâCan you be a lawyer?â Jonah asks. âThatâs what our parents are.â\n\nâThat takes a lot of schooling,â I say, a little bit huffy. âNot everyone\n\ncan be a lawyer, you know.â\n\nâI donât want to be a lawyer,â Cinderella says. âToo much arguing\n\ninvolved.â She squeezes water out of one of Beatriceâs shirts. âThis is\n\nmissing a button. Iâll have to sew on a new one.â\n\nHmm. âYou can sew?â\n\nShe nods. âOf course. Canât you?â\n\nP:77\n\nâIâve never tried,â I say. âBut I probably could. But this is about you.\n\nWhat about becoming a seamstress?â\n\nâThink bigger,â Jonah says, echoing my previous statement. âYou could\n\nmake clothes. You could be a fashion designer.â\n\nâThatâs perfect!â I say. Way to go, Jonah! âYouâll make clothes and sell\n\nthem. A perfect plan!â\n\nâBut what should I make?â\n\nâYou have to make something unique,â I say. âSomething that someone\n\nelse isnât already making. What do you know how to make?â\n\nCinderella shrugs. âIâve never made anything entirely from scratch, but\n\nIâm really good at stitching. Iâve hemmed skirts. Sheets. Shirts. Dresses.â\n\nâCan you make underwear?â I ask. Mine are giving me a wedgie.\n\nâUm, I guess.â\n\nâNever mind. Letâs focus on things people in Floom want.â\n\nâFloom people wear underwear,â she says, sounding insulted.\n\nâNo, I mean special clothes,â I say. I think about the people of Floom.\n\nWhat do they all like? Oh! âThey loved your dress! Everyone loved the\n\ndress you wore to the ball. They couldnât stop gushing about it!â\n\nShe nods. âThey did love my dress. I loved my dress. I wish I still had\n\nmy dress.â\n\nDing ding! âThatâs what youâll do! Youâll make a Cinderella dress!\n\nYouâll make a bunch of Cinderella dresses and then youâll sell them!â\n\nâAnd make one for yourself,â Jonah adds. âMaybe the princeâs assistant\n\nwill recognize you if youâre wearing it when he comes by with the glass\n\nslipper.â\n\nCinderellaâs eyes light up. âThat, my little friend, is a perfect plan.â\n\nAnd once sheâs done with that, maybe she can make me a pair of jeans,\n\na sweatshirt, and some new undies.\n\nP:79\n\nWe take a break from the wash to search the house for material.\n\nâThe living room curtains!â I say. âTheyâre platinum!â\n\nâTheyâre more of a silver,â Cinderella says.\n\nâIs there really a difference?â Honestly, I canât tell. âThe curtains are\n\nperfect.â Itâll be just like in The Sound of Music when Maria makes the\n\nkidsâ clothes!\n\nâI canât dismantle the curtains,â Cinderella says. âBetty would notice.â\n\nâIs there anything else silver-ish that she has and wonât miss?â I ask.\n\nâI think she might have some extra tablecloths,â Cinderella says. âLetâs\n\nlook in the closet.â\n\nWe trudge over to the closet and find a stack.\n\nâThis one isnât bad,â I say. âItâs not exactly silver. Itâs more gray. But\n\nwe can accessorize.â\n\nâBut we still need to finish the wash,â Cinderella says.\n\nâWeâll finish the wash,â I say. âYou make the clothes.â\n\nâIâll be in the attic,â she says. âWish me luck.â\n\nI peek into the room ten minutes later. âHowâs it going?â\n\nâGreat,â she says from under the gray tablecloth.\n\nâDid you sketch it out?â\n\nâUm, no. Should I?â\n\nâI think thatâs what designers do.â\n\nP:80\n\nâIâm not really good at drawing,â she says. âSo I just started cutting.â\n\nâOkay,â I say. She probably knows more about this dress stuff than I do.\n\nâWhat should we do next?â\n\nâCan you make the beds?â\n\nThat I can definitely do. Unlike my brother, I make my own bed every\n\nmorning.\n\nSince Betty and the stepsisters have gone to âvisit friendsâ (I know â\n\nthey have friends? Iâm shocked, too) I take my time making their beds and\n\nsnooping through their stuff.\n\nKayla has Jordan + Kayla written in hearts all over her notebooks. Iâd\n\nfeel bad for her if she wasnât so mean.\n\nI go back downstairs and find Jonah reading the newspaper at the\n\nkitchen table. And by the newspaper, I mean the comics. âLetâs go,â I say.\n\nâGuess what I found,â he says.\n\nâBig Nate?â\n\nâNo, but there is a comic strip called Big Tate. Do you think theyâre\n\nrelated?â\n\nâMaybe. Come on. We have to make the beds.â\n\nâWait, I found something else youâre going to like.â He flips the pages\n\nback. âLook!â\n\nApartment in private home for rent\n\n33 Slipper Street\n\nCozy, 600 square feet\n\nPrivate bathroom, big kitchen, and big windows!\n\nGround floor! Great light! Wonderful location â near shops and\n\npalace.\n\nNo pets.\n\n$100/month\n\nP:81\n\nâIsnât this perfect for Cinderella?â he says. âItâs on Slipper Street. I\n\nthink thatâs a sign. And no pets! Sheâs allergic to pets.â\n\nâRent is so cheap in Floom!â I say. âThatâs amazing!â\n\nWe clomp up the stairs to tell her the news.\n\nâSounds heavenly,â she says.\n\nI look around the room. All I see is a heap of tablecloth. âHowâs it\n\ngoing?â I ask, a little concerned. But she looks pretty intent, so I guess\n\nthatâs a good sign.\n\nâGreat. Iâm a natural. Iâll probably need another hour or so, though.â\n\nâLet us know if we can help! Good luck!â\n\nAn hour later: âCinderella? How are you doing in there?â\n\nâWonderful! I need another hour! Do you think you could start dinner?\n\nMaybe make a chicken Caesar salad? We have leftover chicken from last\n\nnight.â\n\nâUm, I donât know how to make Caesar salad,â I say.\n\nâCanât we just order a pizza?â Jonah asks.\n\nâThe cookbook is on the counter! It tells you how to make the\n\ndressing,â Cinderella calls out.\n\nâOh. Okay.â\n\nHow hard can it be?\n\nWe follow the recipe. We mince. We chop. We whisk. We finish the\n\ndressing. Then we make the salad.\n\nâThis was easier than I thought!â I say, munching on some loose lettuce.\n\nAnd who knew? Cooking is fun! Cookbooks make it so much easier,\n\nthough. Cinderella has the Official Floom Cookbook. There is a section on\n\nstew. There is a section on pizza. There is a section on something called\n\nKingslingions, a Floom specialty, which calls for rice, shark fin, olives, and\n\npineapple (which I never, ever want to try). There is also a section on\n\nP:82\n\ndesserts. Chocolate chip cookies! Lemon meringue pie! White chocolate\n\ncake! Yum.\n\nWhen all the prep is done, we go back upstairs.\n\nI knock and call from the hallway, âCinderella? You still there? Howâs it\n\ngoing?â\n\nâAll done!â she says. âIâm just trying it on. Come in!â\n\nâI canât wait to see it!â I squeal.\n\nâHere I come!â She steps out from the closet and cheers, âTa-da!â\n\nOh.\n\nOh, no.\n\nIt is not good.\n\nIt is not good at all.\n\nThe edges are jagged. The sleeves are uneven. There are random slashes\n\nin places that shouldnât have slashes. It looks about seven sizes too big.\n\nShe looks like the bride of Frankenstein.\n\nShe pirouettes. âIs it gorgeous? This was easier than I thought.â\n\nJonah tugs at my arm. âThatâs what you said about making the Caesar\n\nsalad.â\n\nVery true. Except the Caesar salad actually looks like Caesar salad. This\n\ndress does not look like the dress she wore to the ball. It doesnât look like a\n\ndress at all. It looks like a tablecloth that got attacked by a class of\n\npreschoolers with scissors.\n\nCinderella does another twirl. âIâll make you a pair of undies with the\n\nleftover material.â\n\nThanks, but no thanks. âCinderella, I donât know how to tell you this\n\nbut ââ\n\nHer face falls. âWhat?â\n\nI sigh. âYou really need a mirror in here.â\n\nP:84\n\nOh my,â Cinderella says. Weâre in the stepsistersâ room, examining the\n\ndress in one of the mirrors. She looks at herself from all angles. âOh my, oh\n\nmy. I am really not a good designer.â\n\nâNo,â I say. âYouâre really not.â\n\nâYou can keep practicing,â Jonah says. âYou donât get good at\n\nsomething overnight.â\n\nâThatâs true,â I say. âBut itâs already Sunday evening. Itâs almost\n\ndinnertime. We only have a day and a half left to raise a hundred dollars!â\n\nCinderella sighs.\n\nâWhat?â I ask.\n\nâIt just seems like an awful lot of work for something thatâs not going to\n\nbe needed in the end. I mean, if this convinces Farrah to help me, Iâm going\n\nto marry the prince and live in the palace. I wonât need the apartment after\n\nall.â\n\nâYou could keep the apartment for your office,â Jonah says.\n\nShe makes a sad face. âMy office for what?â\n\nâYour job,â I remind her. âI want to get married one day, but I still want\n\nto be a judge. Even if you do marry the prince, you might discover you like\n\nbeing self-reliant. Even a princess should feel self-reliant. In the meantime,\n\nP:85\n\nyou still need a job. Are you sure you donât want to be a cleaning person?\n\nOr maybe just a clothes washer?â\n\nâI hate washing clothes,â Cinderella says. âMy hands are all chapped.\n\nAnd itâs boring. I want to make something.â\n\nâYouâre making something cleaner,â I say.\n\nCinderella shrugs. âIs the chicken Caesar salad done?â\n\nâYup. All set.\n\nâOh, good. Did you make anything for dessert?â\n\nâNo, were we supposed to?â\n\nâI can do it. But weâd better hurry. Theyâll be home soon, and they eat\n\nat seven.â\n\nMy stomach grumbles. âWhen do we eat?â\n\nâAfter they eat.â\n\nâOh, man,â Jonah wails. âIâm hungry.â\n\nWe help Cinderella back down the stairs and into the kitchen. We hear\n\nthe front door open, and then Betty butts her head in. âI hope dinner is\n\nalmost ready,â she says.\n\nâGezuty!â Jonah says.\n\nâHmm?â\n\nâThatâs Smithvillian for âalmost,ââ he explains.\n\nShe rolls her eyes and steps out.\n\nâSo what should we make?â I ask, flipping through the cookbook.\n\nâCake? Lemon meringue pie? Cookies?â\n\nâWhat about brownies?â Jonah asks.\n\nâYum, I love brownies,â I say. âLetâs make them.â\n\nCinderellaâs face scrunches up. âWhat are brownies?â\n\nBoth my brotherâs and my jaws fall open. âWhat are brownies?â I yell.\n\nâAre you joking?â\n\nShe shakes her head. âIâve never heard of them.â\n\nâYouâve never tried a chocolate brownie?â Jonah repeats,\n\ndumbfounded.\n\nâIâve never tried any kind of brownie,â she says with a shrug.\n\nP:86\n\nâYou really need to get out more,â I say. âIâm sure theyâre in the book.â\n\nI flip through the pages. Cinnamon cupcakes, pineapple tarts, chocolate\n\nchip cookies, apple muffins â¦ but no brownies. NO BROWNIES?\n\nâI canât find a single brownie recipe. This should be illegal.â\n\nâWhat is a brownie, exactly?â she asks.\n\nâItâs a small square of deliciousness,â I say.\n\nâSo letâs make some,â Cinderella says. âDo you know how?â\n\nâItâs easy,â Jonah says. âYou take the brownie mix off the shelf and give\n\nit to your mom and dad and they mix it with some stuff.â His face falls.\n\nEither he just realized that Cinderella doesnât have any brownie mix or he\n\nremembered that our parents donât have much time for brownie making\n\nright now.\n\nâOh,â he says. âI guess that wonât work. You probably have to make it\n\nfrom scratch.â\n\nâSo whatâs the recipe?â Cinderella asks.\n\nI look at Jonah. He looks at me. âI donât know,â I say. âOur parents\n\nnever made them from scratch.â\n\nâOkay, why donât you tell me what it tastes like?â Cinderella asks.\n\nâMaybe I can figure it out.â\n\nâTheyâre chocolaty. Theyâre like a cross between a cookie and a cake,â\n\nI say.\n\nCinderella ties an apron around her waist and pulls out a mixing bowl.\n\nâI do a lot of baking, so weâll have some trial and error. Do you mind being\n\nmy tasters?â\n\nâThat is something I wouldnât mind at all,â Jonah says. âBring on the\n\nbrownies!â\n\nHmm. Iâm getting an idea here. âYou do a lot of baking?â\n\nâYup,â she says, turning on the oven. âLots.â\n\nâDo you like baking? Is it something you could do even more of?â\n\nâSure,â she says. âI find it relaxing.â\n\nHereâs the big one: âAre you any good at it?â\n\nâIâm not bad,â she says with a shrug.\n\nP:87\n\nâAre you a better baker than you are a sewer?â I ask.\n\nShe laughs. âMuch better. Are you guys thinking what Iâm thinking?â\n\nMy mind is racing. âIâm thinking that this could be your job! You can\n\nbake brownies and sell them! All of Floom would come and buy them\n\nbecause youâre the only person who makes them.â\n\nâWhere would I sell them?â Cinderella asks.\n\nâYour apartment!â I say. âItâll be an apartment and bakery. Itâs on the\n\nground floor â itâs perfect.â\n\nâYou want me to start my own shop?â\n\nâYes! Wouldnât that be cool? You could call it Cinderellaâs Brownies!\n\nWait. No. That doesnât have alliteration. Hmm. Itâs really too bad youâre not\n\nmaking cookies. Cinderellaâs Cookies has alliteration.â Maybe not\n\nalliteration. But close enough.\n\nâFloom already has cookies,â Cinderella says.\n\nI drum my fingers against the counter. âRight. And you have cakes and\n\ncupcakes, too, huh?â\n\nShe nods. âWe do.â\n\nâOh, well. Brownies it is. Iâll keep thinking about the name.â\n\nâBut I need to sell these brownies before I have the money to get the\n\napartment,â Cinderella says. âI guess we could sell them at the market. We\n\ncould set up a booth.â\n\nâPerfect!â I say. âWeâll go tomorrow!â\n\nâHurray!â Jonah cheers.\n\nâOur problems arenât solved yet,â Cinderella says, her forehead\n\nwrinkling. âI still donât know how to make the brownies.â\n\nOh. Right. âYou will. I have complete faith in your baking skills.â\n\nI hope I donât have to eat those words.\n\nP:89\n\nWhile Cinderella bakes in the kitchen, Jonah puts the chicken Caesar salad\n\non plates and I serve it in the dining room.\n\nâYou didnât give me enough chicken,â Beatrice complains.\n\nExcuuuuuuuse me.\n\nâDo you want me to get you more?â I ask.\n\nâSurely I do. Why else would I have complained?â\n\nUm, because you complain about everything? So far sheâs told me that\n\nthereâs:\n\n1. A speck of dirt on her fork.\n\n2. A draft in the room.\n\n3. No pepper on the table.\n\nâAnything else?â I ask. I look at Kayla, but sheâs too busy staring at her\n\nplate. Whatâs up with her?\n\nâYou need to refill our water, too,â Betty snaps. âIâm thirsty.â\n\nâNo problem,â I say with fake cheer. As long as theyâre not coming in\n\nthe kitchen, Iâm happy.\n\nI keep a fake smile on my face until Iâm back in the kitchen and then\n\ngroan. âBetty and Beatrice are so annoying. More water! More chicken!\n\nClean forks! Blah, blah, blah!â\n\nP:90\n\nâDonât forget about Kayla,â Cinderella says, pulling her first batch of\n\nbrownies from the oven. âHasnât she complained about the food needing\n\nmore salt yet? She always complains about the food needing more salt.â\n\nâShe hasnât actually.â Kaylaâs barely said two words. Sheâs barely\n\neating, either. Sheâs just moping into her food.\n\nâMaybe sheâs getting sick or something,â Cinderella says. She cuts out\n\ntwo chunks of brownie and hands one to Jonah and one to me. âHere, try\n\nthis.â\n\nâBlah,â Jonah says, spitting it out in the garbage.\n\nâJonah, thatâs so rude,â I say.\n\nâBut it tasted gross!â\n\nâCan you try to be constructive, please?â I ask.\n\nHe looks thoughtful. âIt needs to be less bad.â\n\nI take a small bite. I second the blah, but keep it to myself.\n\nâVery constructive, Jonah, thank you. I actually think it needs more\n\nsugar. And maybe more chocolate chunks.â\n\nâWill do,â Cinderella says, dancing around the kitchen. I think sheâs\n\nhaving fun. Now all we need is for her to make a decent brownie and weâll\n\nbe all set.\n\nThe next batch is disgusting, too. And way too g"
