        "text": "An Analysis of Top Rated Books\n\nWriters are everywhere, and after the blitzkrieg of magic in 1998 known as Harry Potter every writer from novice to expert sees the potential impact of the craft, both financial and social. The desire to create an indelible project that pays and stays is the desire of most creatives; however, writers have the advantage of being able to pull data that is more quantitive. Analyzing data from 10,000 book titles listed on GoodReads.com, an online book review and recommendation platform, an analysis was completed to see a few of the characteristics that make a bestseller.\n\nThe dataset was found on Kaggle and cleaned using a bit of web scraping.\n\nTools Used:\n\nSQL\n\nPython\n\nI decided to explore the data to determine what reviewers deemed a \"goodread.\"\n\nAccording to data provided by Quantcast: Most Goodreads users are women, and the largest reader block falls between the ages of 25â34.\n\nAs of September 2017, the highest rated and reviewed genre was High Fantasy. This category included titles such as J.K Rowlingâs Harry Potter series, Suzanne Collinsâ Hunger Games Series, and George R.R. Martinâs Games of Thrones. Following at a close second is Childrenâs Literature, specifically poetry. Shel Silversteinâs Where the Sidewalk Ends received an average review of 4.29 out of 5.\n\nWord is important and typically genre specific. It came as little surprise that the average word count for the top 50 books (any book more than 1MIL reviews and more than 4 stars) was 116,224. According to WritersDigest.com, science fiction and fantasy are big exceptions when it comes to acceptable length due to increased usage of description and world-building in the writing. With these genres, I would say 100,000 â 115,000 is an excellent range.\n\nIf an author is looking for inspiration beyond the universes of Hogwarts and Panem they may want to explore the works of Bill Watterson, the author of Calvin and Hobbes as well as Brandon Sandersonâs Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive #2). Both fell into the top three of all books reviewed with Potter box set falling in the center. And if youâre wondering which Potter book readers loved the most look no further than the Deathly Hallows with its 198,227 word count and darker high fantasy theme."
