You found him really annoying!”\n\nJonah turns to me. “Oh yeah. I remember him. He was annoying.”\n\nI forcibly swing Jonah’s face back toward the yo-yo. “Don’t look away, Jonah. Your memories are coming back! The yo-yo is reverse hypnotizing you!”\n\nJonah’s eyes turn an even darker purple. “We were able to breathe underwater?”\n\n“We were!” I shout. “We really were!”\n\n“It’s all coming back to me!” Jonah screams while the yo-yo spins faster and faster and Jonah’s eyes get purpler and purpler. “Abby! Maryrose never said you were in charge when we visit fairy tales!”\n\nOops.\n\nA big puff of gold smoke blows out of the yo-yo, and Jonah’s eyes go back to normal. Suddenly, the mirror behind us turns purple.\n\n“The mirror,” I say. “It’s glowing. Jonah? Are you done?”\n\nSpeechless, he nods. “Yup. I remember everything. And, Abby —”\n\nThe mirror is starting to hiss. “Later, Jonah! We have to go.”\n\nI pick Prince up, take my brother’s hand, and together we step inside the portal.\n\nWe fall onto the floor in a heap. Prince wriggles out of my grasp and barks.\n\n“We made it,” I say. “Plus, we’re in the basement! Jonah, are you okay?”\n\nJonah nods, but he looks completely dazed. “My brain feels like it’s going to explode.”\n\n“It’s all the memories,” I say. “Come, we have to get into bed really quietly! And quickly! Mom and Dad’s alarm already went off. That means they’re getting out of bed any minute. Time is back to normal now. Go, go, go!”\n\n“But —”\n\nI pick up Prince and we run — very, very quietly — up the stairs.\n\nOur parents’ door is closed, but we can hear their muffled voices.\n\n“Abby —” Jonah starts.\n\nLater! I mouth, and I jump into my room and gently close my door behind me. At the same time, I hear my parents’ door open.\n\nI dive under my covers.\n\n“Good morning, sweetheart,” my mom says, opening my door and coming inside. “Time to get up.” She gently pulls my covers off. “Abby!” she exclaims, ogling my outfit. “You’re all dressed up!”\n\nHuh? Uh-oh. I’m still wearing my purple satin dress!\n\nOh! I know! “Of course I am,” I say, hopping out of bed. “It’s your surprise birthday party! Come on in, Jonah! Surprise, Mom!”\n\nPrince bounds in, his bow tie still on. “Ruff!”\n\nJonah rushes in next, bouquet of roses in hand, suspenders and bow tie still a mess. “Happy birthday, Mom!”\n\n“Oh, wow,” she says. “Look at you guys! And those flowers are beautiful! I’m speechless!” Her eyes tear up. “You kids are the sweetest. But where did you get those outfits?”\n\nHmm. “Nana sent them for us,” I say. “Don’t you remember?”\n\nShe scrunches her eyebrows together. “No.”\n\nI shrug. “You are a year older. Your memories must be getting fuzzy.”\n\nMy mom laughs. “Is that for me, too?” she asks, pointing to the wrapped painting on my desk.\n\n“Oh,” I say. “Yeah. But it’s not …” I’m about to say that it’s not good. But maybe that doesn’t matter. Maybe what matters is that I did my best. That it came from the heart. So what if I’m not as good an artist as Penny? I’m good at other stuff. Mr. Beast accepted who he is. Maybe it’s time for me to accept who I am. “Here you go,” I say, handing it to her.\n\n“Oooh,” she says, unwrapping it. “Abby! It’s wonderful. So much color! I absolutely love it,” she says. And when I look at her shining eyes, the funny thing is, I know that she means it. Maybe beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n“Thanks, Mom,” I say, my own eyes tearing up now.\n\nMy mom squeezes my shoulder. “Let’s go show Dad. He’s downstairs making birthday waffles.”\n\nJonah raises his eyebrows at me. “I need to talk to Abby for a sec.”\n\n“You can talk to her at the table,” my mom says, ushering him out of my room. “C’mon, I don’t want you to be late for school.”\n\nI wait for them to head downstairs before running over to my jewelry box.\n\n“Prince!” I hear my mom say. “Sorry, buddy, but you do not get to sit at the table. Even if it’s a special occasion.”\n\nI giggle. Poor Prince.\n\nI look at my jewelry box. There’s Beauty! She’s standing in front of what used to be the cheese shop. But now instead, it says LIBRARY. Beauty’s holding a pile of books, smiling a huge smile, and looking more beautiful than ever, because she’s truly happy. I’m so proud of her!\n\nAnd wait a minute — there’s another image next to her. It’s Mr. Beast! With his arm around Freckles. They’re standing in front of the castle where a sign reads THE B&B: BED AND (EXTRA-CHEESY) BREAKFAST.\n\nI am so proud of them.\n\nI’m still not very proud of myself. I know we are all part beauty and part beast, but I want to try to be more beauty than beast.\n\nAnd maybe there’s a way I can make that happen.\n\n* * *\n\n“Penny, can I talk to you?” I say before art class. “In private?”\n\nPenny follows me over to the side of the hallway. “What’s up?”\n\nI take a very big breath. “You were right,” I say. “Yesterday. It wasn’t an accident. I spilled the water on your painting on purpose. And I want to say I’m sorry.”\n\nShe jerks back in shock. “But why would you do that?” she snaps. “I worked hard on it.”\n\nI hang my head. “I know. And it was beautiful. And I was jealous. You are really good at painting.”\n\n“And you’re not,” she says.\n\n“Yeah.” Thanks for rubbing it in.\n\nShe leans against a locker. “I can’t believe you admitted it. My mom told me you were probably jealous.”\n\nMy cheeks heat up. She discussed me with her mom? I’m so embarrassed. I swallow. Hard. “Your mom was right,” I say. “Can you forgive me? I’ll help in any way I can.”\n\n“I don’t need help with art,” she says. She opens her mouth and then closes it.\n\n“What?” I ask, leaning closer. “Please let me make it up to you.”\n\n“Well … do you think you could help me with geography? I’m having a hard time understanding the map. And you seem good at it.”\n\n“Of course,” I say. “Any time!”\n\nPenny sighs. “Sometimes I’m kind of jealous of you, too, Abby. School comes so easily to you. It’s harder for me.”\n\nDid she say she was jealous of me? Of me?\n\nI blink at her in surprise.\n\n“I — well, I guess we’re all good at different things,” I say. “But I am sorry about your painting.”\n\n“It’s okay. Just remind me not to put water next to you in art class,” she says, her eyes twinkling.\n\nI blush but I also laugh. I spot Robin watching us from inside the classroom. I wave.\n\nRobin gives us a hopeful smile.\n\nWe smile back.\n\n“Should we go inside?” Penny asks.\n\n“Let’s go,” I say, and take a step toward class.\n\n“Abby!” Jonah says, appearing at my side. We go to the same school, but I almost never see him between classes since his grade is in another part of the building. He grabs on to my arm. “I’ve been trying to talk to you all morning.”\n\n“What’s going on? What’s wrong? Did you lose your memories again?” I ask in a hushed tone.\n\n“No,” he says. He wiggles his eyebrows. “The opposite.”\n\n“What does that mean?” I ask.\n\n“I know what Wallenta is,” he says.\n\n“You do? What?”\n\n“It’s the kingdom that Maryrose and Jax grew up in.”\n\n“It is?” I ask. “They grew up in the same kingdom?”\n\n“Yes,” he says. “They’re cousins! When Jax said he wasn’t going to apologize about what happened to his cousin in Wallenta, he wasn’t talking about Mr. Beast. He was talking about Maryrose!”\n\nWow. Finally, we know something about Maryrose! We know where she grew up. And that she has a mean, jealous cousin!\n\nThe second bell rings.\n\nWait a sec. “But, Jonah, how did you find that out?” I ask.\n\n“Because it wasn’t just my memories that came back,” he says, walking away from me and smiling mischievously. “I got some of Maryrose’s, too.”\n\n“What?” I ask incredulously.\n\nHe taps his head. “Maryrose’s memories! In here!”\n\nAnd with those words, he disappears down the hall, leaving me staring after him in amazement.\n\nDon’t miss Abby and Jonah’s next adventure, where they fall into the tale of The Frog Prince!\n\nLook for:\n\nWhatever After #8: ONCE UPON A FROG\n\nOnce upon a time there was an author who was very grateful for:\n\nAimee Friedman, Laura Dail, Tamar Rydzinski, Deb Shapiro, Becky Amsel, Abby McAden, David Levithan, Ellie Berger, Lori Benton, Tracy van Straaten, Jennifer Ung, Bess Braswell, Whitney Steller, Robin Baily Hoffman, Sue Flynn, Emily Cullings, Elizabeth Krych, Joy Simpkins, Elizabeth Parisi, Lizette Serrano, Emily Heddleson, Emily Jenkins, Cassie Homer, Elissa Ambrose, Aviva Mlynowski, Larry Mlynowski, Louisa Weiss, Robert Ambrose, the Dalven-Swidlers, the Finkelstein-Mitchells, the Steins, the Greens, the Adamses, the Wolfes, the Mittlemans, the Bilermans, Courtney Sheinmel, Anne Heltzel, Lauren Myracle, Emily Bender, Targia Alphonse, Rose Brock, Jess Braun, Lauren Kisilevsky, Bonnie Altro, Robin Afrasiabi, Jess Rothenberg, Stephen Barbara, Jennifer E.
