Sparkling written, communication and organizational skills. A drop of administrative work required. An all-you-can-drink opportunity!\n\nIf you have Star potential, please e-mail your resume as a Word document ONLY to hr@workforcheap&beourbitch.com.\n\n1\n\nMoonlighting\n\n“Why are you calling?” the HR woman asks me, panic-stricken, as if recess is over and she hasn’t finished her Fruit Roll-up. “Didn’t the ad say not to phone?”\n\n“Yes, I understand that, thank you, but I’ll only be in New York for a few days. I would really like to set up an interview.” I need a new job. I attempt to shield myself behind the pay phone’s plastic divider, since this is the only nicotine-friendly cafeteria on the block and anyone from the office could easily sneak in for a smoke.\n\nThe smell of this stale smoke combined with the plates of shepherd’s pie lined up on the counter make me wish long-distance calls from my cell phone didn’t make me sound as though I’m calling from Zimbabwe. I also wish I knew how to make a calling-card call from my office without getting the IT department.\n\n“Once the hundreds of resumes we’ve received for the Assistant Manager, New Business Development position are reviewed,” the HR woman says, “the managing director will choose the candidates to be interviewed. If you’re one of the fortunate ones selected, I assure you, you’ll be called.”\n\nObviously the first thing this woman does when she gets home is kick her dog. “Thank you very much for your time,” I say.\n\nI redial Soda Star’s number.\n\n“Florida Telephone Systems.” Brrring.\n\nI dial my calling-card number.\n\n“Soda Star, the shining light in beverages,” the receptionist sings. “How may I help you?”\n\n“May I please speak to the managing director?”\n\n“Which managing director is that, miss?”\n\nWhich managing director? Shouldn’t there only be one director who manages? Or maybe one manager who directs? “The new business managing director, please.” Please let that be right.\n\n“Whom should I say is calling?”\n\nA person he’s never heard of before? “Sunny Langstein.”\n\n“One moment, please. I’ll transfer your call.”\n\nFoiled again, HR.\n\nI’m probably going to get his voice mail. Why would he be at his desk at 10:30 a.m.? He’s probably out managing. Or directing. Or managing directors when it gets really crazy. I hunt through my recently started job-search notebook where I wrote possible messages to leave on prospective employers’ machines.\n\nRing, ring. Heart beating erratically.\n\n“Ronald Newman speaking.”\n\nGood. Damn. He’s there. It’s a he. Concentrate on exuding confident, sexy, sweet voice. I flip back to the page of possible things to say to prospective employers. “Hi, Mr. Newman? This is Sunny Langstein calling. I’m presently the assistant manager of new business development for Panda in Fort Lauderdale, but I will be relocating to New York for personal reasons. I’m very impressed with your company’s work and would like to continue my professional growth in the beverage industry. I’ll be in New York next week, and I was wondering if you’d consider meeting with me to discuss any potential job openings in your department.”\n\n“How did you get this number? Aren’t you supposed to go through HR?”\n\nSounds cranky. Must accent the sweet voice. “I’m so sorry to bother you, sir.” Now confident. “I just assumed calling you would be more efficient.”\n\nHe laughs. I picture him reclining in a brown leather reading chair, a pipe dangling from his lips. “Well, Sunny, you’re probably right. Do you think you could handle working in the big leagues?”\n\nOooh. The big leagues.\n\n“I’m quite confident I can, sir. I have excellent—” this is where I exploit the many hackneyed and meaningless qualifications employers salivate over “—communication and organizational skills. I multitask, prioritize, problem-solve and self-start. I pay strong attention to detail and work effectively with both creative and production staff. I have a proactive approach toward current products and new business, and I have a personable, team-player personality. Will you be able to meet with me for an informational interview?”\n\nPause. “Are you aware that I’m looking for an assistant manager right now? To report directly to me?”\n\nNo kidding. “Really? I’d love to come and talk to you about it. I’ll be in NewYork next Monday. Do you have a free half hour?”\n\nHe laughs again. “You’re a go-getter. I like that. Hmm. Let me check.”\n\nHe’s clicking on his keyboard. Clicking…clicking…more clicking.\n\n“Did I mention I’m proficient in most computer programs including Windows, Macintosh, Microsoft Office and Photoshop?” I ask.\n\nHe whistles his approval. “How about right before my golf game? Four o’clock?”\n\nLiza, my boss, strolls through the doors. Damn. Now why am I using a pay phone in the cafeteria across the street from my office in the middle of the morning? She knows I don’t smoke. I ram my notepad and pen back into my bag. “Perfect. I’ll see you then. ’Bye.”\n\n“Okay. Great…um…” Come on, Newman, spit it out. “Will you fax me your resume?”\n\nLiza doesn’t see me yet. She’s ordering something. Is she sneaking a cup of coffee? Since she announced her pregnancy, she’s been strutting her water bottle all Mormon-like around the office, boasting how effortlessly she gave up caffeine, smokes and Chardonnay.\n\n“No problem,” I say. “Thanks. ’Bye.”\n\n“Do you know where our offices are?”\n\n“On Forty-third Street, right? It’s on your Web site?”\n\n“Yes and yes. I’m on the sixth floor. Just tell Heidi you’re here to see me.”\n\nI assume Heidi is his receptionist. “Great. ’Bye.”\n\n“Don’t you want my fax number?”\n\n“Isn’t it the one on the Web site?”\n\n“No, I have a personal fax number. Do you want it?”\n\nOf course I want it! Just tell it to me already! I crouch against the wall and a ketchup-stained table eclipses my face. “Yes. Yes, I do. What is it?”\n\n“Hmm. Good question. Let me check. Hold on, it should be on my business card, right?” Clunk. Did he just knock over his chair? Is he completely incompetent?\n\nLiza pulls out her wallet.\n\n“Okay, got it. Two-one-two-five-five-five-nine-four-three-six.” Uh-oh, nothing to write on or with. Two-one-two-five-five-five-nine-four-three-six. Two-one-two-five-five-five-nine-four-three-six. I’ll remember it. No problem. I can remember one stupid fax number. Especially this one. Nine times four equals thirty-six. How can I forget? Two-one-two-five-five-five-nine-four-three-six. Or is it four-nine-three-six? This is a terrible plan.\n\n“It was a pleasure talking to you. I look forward to meeting you.” Two-one-two-five-five-five-four-nine-six-three? I should take out my pen and notebook. Who cares? I could be writing something besides a fax number for a future employer down. Like the lunch special.\n\n“I’m looking forward to meeting you, too,” he says.\n\nAs quietly and quickly as possible—two-one-two-five-five-five-three-six-nine-four—I hang up the phone. One interview scheduled. A good start.\n\n“Sunny?” Liza asks. Her hands leap to her rounded stomach. She does this often, as though she’s checking to ensure she’s still pregnant.\n\nMaybe she thinks I’m getting coffee. Not a ridiculous assumption. Office coffee is like the hot dog of the java industry. They get the leftover beans that don’t quite make the cut at Starbucks. Two-one-two-five-five-five-six-three-nine-four.\n\nLiza isn’t a horrible boss. Besides the fact that I do all her work and she takes all the credit. And that on staff birthdays she refuses to order “terribly fattening” chocolate cake and instead insists on serving celery sticks and low-fat tzatziki. And since she’s gotten pregnant, she’s become a walking bitch machine.\n\nBut the workload isn’t atrocious and she always writes me nice reviews and pays me fat bonuses.\n\nShe glares at my cupless hands. “Is there a reason you snuck out of the office to use the phone here?”\n\nA first-rate question. “My grandmother is sick, Liza. I needed to talk to her in private.” It’s a good thing both my grandmothers are already dead.\n\nShe looks doubtful.\n\n“What did you get, Liza?” I ask, motioning to her small plastic cup. There was an article in the Miami Herald that said that people respond more positively to you if you frequently use their names in conversation. It hasn’t worked for me yet.\n\nHer face flushes a shit-you-caught-me red. “Hot chocolate.”\n\nFunny, it doesn’t smell like hot chocolate. Smells like good old will-deform-your-baby caffeine. That’s terrible. Doesn’t she know that she’s risking her baby’s health?\n\nShe slides into a metal chair. “I’m going to stay here for a while and look over some notes.”\n\nShould I insist on sitting with her to make sure she doesn’t try to sneak a smoke, too? Maybe I should get a better sniff of what’s in that water bottle. Or maybe I’ve got to get somewhere and write down this number. “See you later, Liza.”\n\nTwo-one-two-five-five-five-three…three times twelve…twelve? Damn.\n\nDuring my leftover pineapple pizza lunch, I respond to the first of two of my friend Millie’s e-mails:\n\nTo: Millie\n\nSubject: Re: Where The Hell Are You?\n\nI just got back last night. He asked me to move in with him. I’m going. It’s insane.\n\nHer second e-mail, tagged with Fw: Purity Tampons Cause Cancer, is one of those health forwards. Millie, one of my closest friends, knows that I love spreading these millions-of-women-die-needlessly warnings. You never know, one day one of these e-mails could save someone’s life.\n\nI received this from a friend—please read and pass along. Have you heard that Purity includes asbestos in their tampons? Why? Because asbestos makes you bleed more, and if you bleed more, you are going to use more…\n\nI tried a Purity tampon once, but it felt as if I was trying to shove a cement brick up my vagina. I forward the e-mail to Liza because she loves chain letters, especially those feel-good chain letters that promise you instant death if you don’t forward immediately. I forward the Purity Tampons Cause Cancer e-mail to my older sister Dana, too. This way she knows that the reason I didn’t call her when I got home late night was not because my plane crashed, or was hijacked by terrorists, but because I am an extremely busy career woman who is also very concerned with women’s health. And who knows? Maybe she’ll get a story idea out of it. Dana does the nine o’clock news for the radio station WCMG Miami. She’s desperately trying to move to TV. She also sells feature articles to newspapers all over the country in an attempt to build up her portfolio.\n\nSix seconds after I hit Send, my extension rings.\n\nAs always, I contemplate answering the phone with, “What?” But I don’t. “Sunny Langstein speaking.”\n\n“Why didn’t you call me when you got in? You know I worry about you.”\n\n“Sorry, Dana. I got in late and I didn’t want to wake you.”\n\nMy sister snorts. “I told you to wake me. Did I not tell you to wake me? Did you have a good trip?”\n\n“Very nice trip, thanks.” Do I tell her? I have to tell her. “Hold on one sec,” I say. I put the phone on the desk and close my office door. I sit down in my swivel chair and take a deep breath. Liza hates when her staff’s doors are closed, always asks us to please leave them open so that the other departments don’t get the impression we’re unfriendly.\n\nHer door has been closed for about six months now.\n\n“He asked me to move in with him.”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Hello? You still there?”\n\n“I’m here,” she says. “He wants you to move to New York?”\n\n“Yes. What do you think?”\n\n“Do you care what I think?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n“Are you going to go?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You’re just going to quit your job and leave everything behind? Isn’t that a bit irrational?”\n\nAnd the guilt begins. Maybe I shouldn’t have told her. Maybe I should have moved and called her from New York. “What’s new?” I could have asked. She would have rambled on for hours, and when she finally stopped for breath, I could have interjected, “Call me at this new number, ’kay?” And that would have been it. I should have banked on Dana’s tunnel vision—her ability to only see and hear what she wants to see and hear. It would have taken her months, maybe even years, before she realized that 212 wasn’t Fort Lauderdale’s area code.\n\nCase in point: after I graduated from college, she admitted she didn’t know that I had studied business at University of Florida.\n\n“What did you think I was studying?”\n\nShe shrugged, straightening the neck of my gown. “Communications.”\n\nI laughed. “Why? Because you studied communications?”\n\n“No,” she answered, sounding insulted. “I thought that’s what you said. That you wanted to study communications.”\n\nI did. When I was eleven. When Dana wanted to be a star reporter like Barbara Walters and decided to major in communications, I said I wanted to be Barbara Walters and study communications. What do they teach you in communications anyway? How to talk? But then I decided that business was a little more practical. That’s what my father told me.\n\nAnd journalism isn’t the only way to make a difference in this world. I’m going to change the structure from within.\n\nOne day, armed with all types of theorems, my business degree and women’s studies minor, I would break through the corporate glass ceiling.\n\nOne day.\n\nComing up with the next Snapple wasn’t exactly what I had in mind. The problem is, I haven’t found a ceiling really worth breaking. Panda recruited on campus and I dropped off my resume, mostly because I didn’t know what I wanted to do and then they called me in for an interview and then they offered me a job. I am quite talented at convincing people to do what I want, even when I’m not sure I want it.\n\nBut I’m only twenty-four, still building the resume. One day I’ll do something real. Change the world. And in the meantime, unlike Dana, since the day I started college, my father hasn’t had to lend me a dime.\n\nA piece of pineapple is trapped behind my bottom teeth, in the wire that my orthodontist glued on after I got my braces off. “It’s not irrational,” I say, while digging for the stray piece of fruit.\n\n“I can’t understand you. You’re mumbling. Are you going to quit your job?”\n\nSpit or swallow? I spit the de-wedged pineapple into a tissue. “I thought of flying in every morning, but it’ll be difficult.”\n\n“Don’t be a smart-ass.”\n\nDana breathes heavily in my ear, waiting. I don’t breathe that loudly, do I? Now that Steve and I will be permanently sleeping in the same bed, I’ll have to train myself to inhale and exhale through my nose so that I don’t kill him with my morning breath.\n\nI see Liza huff by through the two window panels by my door. They don’t let us lowly assistant managers have blinds for fear we’ll spend all day playing Tetris, downloading porn or write to the higher-ups that we’re secretly doing their jobs.\n\n“I’ll find a new job.”\n\n“Isn’t Panda considered one of the top five companies to work for in Florida? Aren’t you on the fast track over there?” Of course, that she remembers.\n\n“I won’t be promoted for another year.”\n\n“Why? Don’t you do all of your boss’s work?”\n\nTrue. “But I’m not ready to be a manager. I still need to have someone look over my stuff. And I’m only twenty-four. They don’t let twenty-four-year-olds be managers.”\n\n“You’re a mature twenty-four. You should have asked for a promotion by now. Don’t be such a pushover.”\n\nI bite my tongue to keep from telling her to take her own advice. First she was a freelance journalist. And now she’s been a radio reporter for over a year. When is she going to go after the job she wants?\n\nShe takes a breath. “Have you even started looking for work?”\n\n“I already have one interview,” I say. Not that I expect to get a job right away. I know it takes time. But hopefully not too much time. I don’t want to quit my job until I have a new one. But I have to give my landlord at least thirty days’ notice before I want to move out, and I can only move out on the last day of a month. Which means that if I want to move out by October thirty-first I have to tell her by the end of September, next Tuesday. Otherwise I have to wait an entire month and Steve will end up paying for his entire apartment for all of November, since his roommate is moving out at the end of October.\n\nThis is all way too complicated.\n\n“Don’t you think you’re a little young to move in with your boyfriend?” She sighs for effect.\n\n“I thought I was a mature twenty-four?”\n\n“Not that mature.”\n\n“Dana, by the time Mom was twenty-four, she had you.”\n\n“I can’t believe you’re going to quit your job, give up your apartment, sell your car—you can’t bring a car, never mind a convertible to Manhattan, you know—to follow some guy across the country. Are you going to get married next? Take his name? Become a stay-at-home mom? Buy a bread-maker?”\n\nI wish I’d been offered a fabulous job in New York first and then met Steve while buying a hot pretzel from a street vendor. “I’ve always wanted a bread-maker.”\n\n“I worry about you.”\n\n“Don’t.”\n\n“What if you can’t find a job?”\n\n“Then I won’t move.”\n\nDana snorts. “Don’t think you can bullshit me the way you do everyone else. I know you. Do what you want. But don’t come crying to me when you’re forty, have five kids, no life of your own and need help filling the two-car garage with carbon monoxide. You should live a little. Experience life.”\n\nInstead of finding a job after college, Dana did a one-year women’s studies master’s (that’s why I did the women’s studies minor—she kept bugging me to do it). Then, she decided she needed a master’s degree in journalism. Dana never believed in settling down. Especially for a man. Last year she slept with twelve. A bona fide member of the Man-a-Month Club, she quantifies life experiences as men’s boxers over her bedpost. “You’re too inexperienced to make such an important decision,” she continues. “And you’ve been dating him less than a year. You don’t know him long enough to know he’s not a complete asshole. You haven’t done enough research. You’re making a mistake.”\n\nI hang up the phone and turn back to my e-mails.\n\nMillie has already written me back.\n\nMy phone rings. I’m not going to talk to her if she’s going to be annoying.\n\nIt rings again.\n\nStill ringing.\n\nI pick up. “Uh-huh.”\n\n“I’m sorry. I’m going to miss you, okay? I like having you an hour drive away. If you’re sure, I mean absolutely one hundred and ten percent sure it’s the right decision, I’ll stop protesting.”\n\nI imagine an army of stoned, ponytailed picketers waving felt-tipped marker-written signs and chanting at the airport, “No, no, don’t let her go!” “She’s too young, have more fun!” “She’s delirious for getting serious!”\n\n“It’s the right decision,” I say.\n\nOf course it’s the right decision. I’m in love. He’s in love. If it’s going to work, we can’t live in different cities forever, and he can’t leave New York. Saturday night was the ten-month anniversary of our first date, and after an hour of wine and sweaty sex he placed a little blue box on top of his pillow and whispered, “Happy anniversary.” My heart stopped, as if its plug had been ripped out of the wall. Holy shit, I thought. Is it a ring? Is he proposing? Am I going to get married? Do I love this man? I’m too young to get married. How can I marry him when we’re never in the same city for more than forty-eight hours? He loves me. I’m going to get married. We’re going to have a home. And then I opened the box. And it was a silver key chain. Smooth and silver, the inscription said, Move in with me? I love you, S. My heart turned over again, and still not sure if I was relieved or disappointed I kissed him, kissed him again.\n\nYes, yes, yes.\n\nIt’ll work. It’ll be perfect. I’m in love. Aren’t you supposed to take risks when you’re in love?\n\nBut if—and it’s a big fat unlikely if—I’m wrong about this (and I really doubt that I’m wrong about this) and he turns out to be a complete asshole like Dana warned, it’s not like my life will be over. I can find somewhere to live in New York if I absolutely had to. The Village Voice lists tons of people looking for roommates in Manhattan. Or if I discover I hate New York, I can always move back to Florida. I can stay with Dana until I find a place. Maybe Liza will give me back my job. Or I can teach English in Japan. I know someone who did it and loved it. She claimed it was the most incredible learning experience and that all she needed was a bachelor’s degree and that she made a shitload of cash. I could use the money to travel through Asia and even to Australia or New Zealand and I love miso soup and at least five Japanese schools have positions available immediately.\n\nI checked.\n\nThe message from Millie:\n\nOh my God! You are so lucky! NYC! Very jealous. When am I going to see you? Save Friday—we’re having a major girls night! Lucy, Laura and some of her friends from work. Cocktails here, dinner and clubbing on South Beach. You’d better come. You haven’t been out in years. You missed a crazy night on Saturday! We all ended up skinny-dipping with a bunch of Italians in Lucy’s pool! lol. Want to go for sushi tonight?\n\nDing! A message from Dana:\n\nLove you. Worried about you that’s all. You don’t use Purity tampons, do you? Do you think I should write a story about this? Of course you do, you crazy hypochondriac. I just sold a feature about American teenage prostitutes. Prada purse here I come!\n\nThe dichotomy that is my sister: She refuses to write about fashion, but is secretly obsessed with it. Before she got her news radio gig, she was offered a fashion column and she turned it down. She believes that publicly writing about clothing will brand her a frivolous journalist, a lightweight. I tell her that obsessing about fashion, spending all her money on fashion makes her a frivolous person. But that doesn’t seem to bother her.\n\nDing! Message from my boss Liza:\n\nIn case you’ve forgotten, I’m pregnant. What do I need tampons for? I’d appreciate if you don’t send chain letters during company time. Thanks, L\n\nIf I weren’t planning to quit, her e-mail would have annoyed me. Maybe she didn’t have her morning nicotine fix, after all.\n\nI respond to Millie’s many exclamations:\n\nI’m going back to NY this weekend for interviews. I have to keep looking for jobs this week. When I get back?\n\nAs soon as the message goes out, I delete it from the Sent folder. Then I delete it from the Deleted folder. I’ve got this Big Brother technology down pat.\n\nI set out down the block in search of a less visited pay phone.\n\n“No pay phone here,” a bald man says. “There’s one up the street.”\n\nPay phones are like men. Never a decent one around (by decent I mean in good working order) when or where you’re looking.\n\nTake my Europe trip for example. Who doesn’t want a summer fling? I wasn’t still a virgin—it wasn’t as if I had my heart set on losing it in a hostel bunk bed or anything like that—but I believed that having a wild affair was part of the backpack experience. Isn’t that why college students go to Europe? I called dibs on the Scots and Brits, and Millie reserved the Italians, so of course we mostly met frat boys from Miami. I met one overly freckled, broad-shouldered, seemingly interested Scot on the overnight ferry from Brindisi to Corfu, but by the time we got to Greece, he had dropped two tablets of E and found his way into a sleeping bag that boasted a brunette and a foot-long Canadian flag.\n\nNow, as I continue my hike up Flamingo Road, in search of a pay phone, the sun follows me like the evil eyes of a mysterious painting in a Scooby-Doo episode. It’s a good thing I have my sneakers on today. As I do every day. Dana tried to convince me to buy two-inch heeled pumps for the office. “But I’m allowed to wear sneakers,” I said.\n\n“It’s about image,” she said. “Your ten-year-old sneakers don’t scream sophisticated, now do they?”\n\n“At least they don’t scream pain.” I don’t get why anyone would choose to be uncomfortable.\n\nDana and I have very different understandings of the purpose of clothes. I see it as something you wear so you’re not walking around naked. Dana sees it as something worth going into debt for. Or at least worth borrowing money from my father, the person she can’t stand the most.\n\nThe sweater and jeans I’m wearing (which Dana has already vocally disapproved of—“they’re too straight leg and too light. You’ve had those jeans since eighth grade. You’ve got to think darker, boot cut.”), were chosen with an air-conditioned office in mind, not the Florida marathon.\n\nDid I put deodorant on this morning? Last time Steve came to visit me he forgot his deodorant and had to use mine. He smelled like summer tulips all weekend.\n\nSweet Stevie. How we met is an example of how great men appear when you’re not looking. It was one week after I moved into my new one-bedroom ocean-view Fort Lauderdale apartment, when Steve spilled his mocha latte down my shirt.\n\nI was at Pam’s, one of my favorite coffee shops in Miami, a small, homey, southwestern decorated café on Washington Avenue. I was on my way to meet with a research firm for a new chocolate soda we were developing, when the spilling took place. I wanted to maim the idiot but he kept apologizing and throwing coffee holders at me, thinking they were napkins. I kept telling him to stop, that it was fine even though it was not fine."
