        "text": "Far From the Tree\n\nBy: Robin Benway\n\nPublished By: HarperTeen\n\nPublication Date: October 3, 2017\n\nPage Count: 384\n\nBuy it at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or IndieBound\n\nSource: ARC Kindly Provided by Publisher via Edelweiss\n\nYoung Adult - Contemporary\n\nHigh school hasn't gone the way Grace planned. She never expected one of the star athletes to fall for her nor did she expect to end up pregnant with his child before her Junior year ended, but life has a way of keeping us on our toes. Grace's life crumbles after finding out she's pregnant. She never hesitates though - she knows that she must put the baby up for adoption. As much as she loves the child growing within her, she doesn't feel it would be fair to keep the baby when Grace can't provide a stable home. She isn't ready for the life of a single mom when she hasn't finished school and has no job prospects. She spends hours pouring over information about potential parents trying to choose the best possible mom and dad for her little girl.\n\nWhile she is struggling with these choices, her ex-boyfriend is dating a \"good\" girl and preparing for the homecoming dance. In those moments when Grace was suffering and overwhelmed, I despised Max and his parents. They tried to place all the blame for the pregnancy on Grace when it truly takes two. Max was able to go on with his life with no repercussions while Grace was forced to endure rude comments, bullying, and unfair treatment. Why do we have this double standard? Why is teen pregnancy so often seen as the problem of the mother?\n\nGrace's experience makes her crave a chance to find her own birth mother. Her parents have never made it a secret that she was adopted. They have always told her that when she was ready (if that day came) they would help her find answers to her questions. Grace gets far more than she bargained for when she learns that has an older brother, Joaquin, and a younger sister, Maya. She decides she needs to make contact with both of her siblings. In the beginning, for Grace, this is a way of finding redemption after making the choice to give her daughter up. She wants to know that her birth mother gave her up for good reasons in spite of loving her and wanting to keep her. She hopes her siblings feel the same.\n\nWhile Grace has been raised as an only child, her biological siblings have had different upbringings. Joaquin has been in foster care since the age of one. He feels like an abandoned sailboat left to the mercy of the waves. He has bounced from home to home and hasn't truly found where he belongs, but thinks it may be with his current foster parents, who truly seem to care about him. He is just as surprised as Grace to learn that he has biological siblings. Maya, on the other hand, appears to have a charmed life with her well off parents and younger sister, but she has her own share of demons lurking in the corners. She also isn't sure how to handle having biological siblings, but she doesn't cut their biological mom any slack. She firmly believes that there is no good reason for putting your kids up for adoption. Her staunch stance on the issue will cause a rift between her and Grace until things come to light. The siblings spend the novel learning what it means to be family and trying to decide if they want to look for their mother.\n\nThe notion of family is an important concept in this novel. What truly makes a family? Is it biology? Is it love? Can your friends become your family? I think pondering this notion is intriguing and provides a theme that will resonate with young adult and adult readers alike.\n\nOne Last Gripe: As mentioned in the review, I was frustrated by Max and his parents' response to Grace's pregnancy.\n\nFavorite Thing About This Book: The nature imagery that was scattered throughout the novel\n\nFirst Sentence: Grace wasn't one of those girls who was always fantasizing about homecoming.\n\nFavorite Character: Grace\n\nLeast Favorite Character: Max's Dad"
