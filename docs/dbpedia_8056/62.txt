During the Great Patriotic War and blockade Nikolai Timkov was among defenders of Leningrad.

His first part in Art exhibition refers to 1929 (Rostov on Don). In 1947, in the halls of the Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists has been opened the first solo exhibition of his works, as shown later in Leningrad at the Cinema House and the House of Arts. He painted landscapes, genre paintings, worked in watercolors and oil painting. Most famous as master of lyrical landscapes. Since the late 1940s, Nikolai Timkov become the constant participant of Leningrad, Republican, and All-Union Art Exhibition. Formation of his individual creative style proceeded gradually, as experience and lessons learned in the process of communicating with your colleagues and numerous creative travel to the Volga River and Don River, in Staraya Ladoga, the Urals, the work in Wira and Christmas village near Leningrad, on the Academicheskaya Dacha. Already as a mature master he visits Italy (1969), England (1974), France (1977), Yugoslavia (1981).

In the first post World War II decade, Timkov style developed and improved in areas identified during the years of study. He was entirely under the influence of the 19th-century Russian landscape painters. Real space in his works passed almost illusory precision, the colors muted. In landscapes of Don and Volga he tends to cover a larger space with the image of the set clearly legible plans that is in line with general trends in the genre of these years. Among the famous works of this period the painting "Harvest" (1950),[4] "Lights of Hydro Power Station", "Soon the harvest" (both 1951),[5] "Winter Landscape" (1952),[6] "Don River Distance" (1953), "Evening on the Don River", "At the Don River"[7] (both 1954), "Silent Fall. On the Don", "The Last Snow", "Towards Spring"[8] (all 1955), "Windy Day", "Evening"[9] (both 1956), "The ice moved",[10] "Evening on the Volga River"[11] (both 1957), and others.

The most interesting his etudes done from nature: "Landscape"[12] (1954), "Spring Landscape"[13] (1955), "The Wira village",[14] "A Winter" (both 1956), "White Night" (1957), "Last Ray", "Towards spring", "Young Aspen trees"[15] (all 1958), and others. In them Timkov often can be preserved impressions of the direct perception of nature. But the sketch in those years was considered only as auxiliary material for landscape painting, with its large size, an essential genre-narrative beginning with the careful selection and meticulous attention to detail and alignment of the composition. Not surprisingly, therefore, that at the solo exhibition of 1957 in the Leningrad Union of Artists, as later in Rostov on Don, Timkov appears as a gifted and serious professional, whose work is however still does not go beyond the tenets and practices that existed in the Soviet landscape painting of 1940-1950s.

However, much in his works has already drawn attention to themselves. This is a rare natural sense of color, sincere and resolute own voice in the selection of topics and reveal of the way. His painting becomes decorative, pattern and shapes becomes more generalized. The artist often resorted to building tracks around the large volumes and planes.
