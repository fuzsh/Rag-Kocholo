        "text": "Seated at the long work table in her studio above the People’s Store in Lambertville, Kelly Sullivan’s gaze sweeps the four walls of the large room where her paintings are displayed: portraits, landscapes, nudes and figure studies, still lifes, florals, and more.\n\n“All I’ve ever wanted was to be a great painter,” she says. “Ever since my grandmother taught me to paint when I was 5 years old.”\n\nShe speaks of \"landing in the Bay Area\" of San Francisco when she was in her 20s, where she did art projects for corporate clients. The long list on her website (kellysullivanfineart.com) includes corporations such as Macy's West, Joie De Vivre Hotels and the Hong Kong Association, to name a few.\n\nIt was there she set up 15 working studios under one roof to share the power of art with inner city kids and adults. That led to her development of Finger Smears, a program where hundreds of people are encouraged to dip their fingers in paint and create their own art — all on one canvas.\n\n“Over 80,000 people have stuck their fingers in paint for me, including Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Harrison Ford and well-known athletes,” she says. According to her website, Finger Smears has raised $150,000 for charities across the United States and has been commissioned to commemorate All-Star baseball games, the U.S. Open and other such significant events.\n\nSullivan still does her corporate work and is still deeply involved in Finger Smears, but in recent years she has returned to her first love — painting, more particularly to classical oil painting, in which she immerses herself in her studio.\n\nVisit her studio, and you will be surrounded by works such as “Idaho,” a 40- by 34-inch portrait of a weathered gray barn standing in the mid-distance, abandoned, with snow heavy on its roof behind mounds of unbroken snow. It’s difficult to determine which is done more deftly: the barn, the snow or the expert handling of those blue winter clouds that pick up the sienna tones of the landscape’s bare trees.\n\nSullivan says she does studies on site and paints from them in the studio, making edits based on composition and what she wants the painting to be. “I like both,” she says. “The studies have a lot of juice, but in the studio you get complexity.”\n\nSpeaking of complexity, when you visit her studio, spend time with “Olaf,” her portrait of an old rancher from Jackson, Wyo., whom she met recently while on a painting trip to the area. Pay attention to the contours of his face, the shadows in his deep-set eyes, the way light rests gently on his nose, his cheek, his white eyebrow. Notice his weathered ruddy skin and how Sullivan has worked the colors of his skin and his long matted beard and mustache into his battered clothing. Working in a very limited palette, she has given Olaf a real presence.\n\nShe has done it again in “Aidan,” where, using just muted blue, sienna, white and flesh tones, she captured the essence of a young girl lost in her own private thoughts, her long auburn hair caught in a gentle breeze.\n\nHer still life paintings include everything from a cruet of olive oil and olives to a lemon paired with a sprig of lilacs in a blue vase. These are small paintings from her “Simple Pleasures” series.\n\nHer landscapes include a wide variety of scenes, ranging from “Lambertville Creek,” showing a few buildings reflected in the meandering water, to a street scene in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. There are graceful trees casting their shadows on vast expanses of rolling green fields, and snow-covered mountain peaks rising over trees and land showing their autumn colors.\n\nA native of Clinton Township, Sullivan moved back to New Jersey and settled in Lambertville with her husband and children in 2011 after living in Teton Valley, Idaho, for several years. She seeks out painters whose work she admires and travels to study with them. She recently returned from study trips to Taos, N.M., and Jackson Hole, Wyo. She will be passing on what she has learned in beginning oil painting classes, starting Sept. 17. Details can be found on her website.\n\n“I work to create paintings that recognize our visual reality and suggest a subtle sense of beauty. I work for something poetic rather than ridged depiction,” she says. She adds that she experiments with a variety of surfaces, including canvas, hardboard and gessoed paper, and that she moves back and forth from figurative to landscape, to still life.\n\n“All of it interests me,” she continues. “I paint often from life using live models, plein air, or still-life set-ups.”\n\nShe also works from her own photo references, from memory and imagination, especially in her landscapes. She mentions Chauncey Ryder, William Lathrop and Nikolai Timkov as being among her favorite painters who are no longer living.\n\nOn a recent morning, with rain pelting the windows of her studio and music playing in the background, she sits back and muses, “I’m so into this corner of the world now I just want to paint. Just paint what I want to paint.”\n\nShe carries that thought even farther in her website blog. “I just want to make art. I don’t want to shout about it. I just want to make it, understand it and grow as a painter. I want to attempt in a quiet way, to translate some of the silent beauty I see in this world. Subtly.”\n\nWhen\n\n: Noon-5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays, or by chance or appointment.\n\nWhere\n\n: 28 N. Union St., third floor of the People’s Store, Lambertville\n\nContact\n\n: (732) 233-5614 or"
