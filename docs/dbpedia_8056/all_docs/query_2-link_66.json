We are holding your hands in this difficult moment of losing your father and grandfather.\n\nDon was and will always be, one of the central pillars of our work and our group. He is on the Board of our Directors and will always be there.\n\nHe spoke to us about Awe and Wonderment. About our human ability to live in awe and wonderment, not just when we see a beautiful sun set or the majesty of the ocean, but always. That we can live in a state of awe and wonderment. And we do that, says Don, by leaving behind the psychology of projection. The psychology of projection is like a scrim, a transparent stage curtain, where you believe that what you see is reality only as long as the light shines on it in a certain way. However, it is not reality. It is a projection. And in order to live in awe and wonderment, we have to look through this scrim and let go of all the details that appear on it, in which we are so caught up in. When we do that, we can see the beautiful sun set, the majestic ocean, always, in everything.\n\nWe are all inconsolable!\n\nWe are with you, dear Don, wherever you may be now!\n\nAnd we promise to always remember that we can live in Awe and Wonderment, always!\n\nEvelin, on behalf on our entire HumanDHS network!\n\nSunday, June 10, 2007\n\nDonald C. Klein was a psychologist and behavioral scientist. He was also a Member of the HumanDHS Board of Directors, HumanDHS Global Advisory Board, the HumanDHS Global Core Team, and the HumanDHS Global Coordinating Team.\n\nAfter earning a Clinical Psychology Ph.D. in 1952 at the University of California, Berkeley, he was CEO of an experimental community mental health center, directed a multi-disciplinary graduate center at Boston University, served as NTL Program Director for Community Affairs, and helped to develop and became coordinator of the Applied Behavioral Science graduate program at The Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSubsequently, he was Professor Emeritus of the Graduate College of The Union Institute & University, which offers an innovative non-residential doctoral program for working adults.\n\nDon Klein has been one of the first to explicitly examine and write on the humiliation phenomena. His first publication on humiliation goes back to 1991 (Journal of Primary Prevention on the Humiliation Dynamic, Vol 12, no. 2, Winter, 1991; Vol 12, No. 3, Spring 1992).\n\nHe has written numerous books and has conducted extensive research on how families and organzations use humiliation as a tool of control and socialization. In addition to the Humiliation Dynamic, as an Applied Behavioral Scientist, he has studied and written about community change dynamics, differences and diversity, power, and large group methods for change in organizations and communities. In his training and consulting work he has used sociodrama and other performatory approaches. He is especially interested in methods that can be used to create meaningful, integrative non-humiliating connections (i.e., \"social glue\") between diverse groups in community settings.\n\nIn recent years Don Klein has become deeply engaged with what he calls Appreciative Psychology, which has to do with the inherent level of appreciative being that connects each one of us with universal life energy.\n\nPlease find here:\n\n The humiliation dynamic: An overview by Donald C.

Council of Educational Research in 2008.\n\n• D. Raja Ganesan kindly writes on 25th April 2016: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the UN encompasses the concepts of dignity and prevention of humiliation. But many countries, I understand, have not yet signed the covenant. If I remember right India is not yet a signatory to this Delaration. The countries which have not yet become signatories may nevertheless have enshrined in their constitutions articles and sections in their statute books, as also institutional mechanisms for their implementation: they may not want to forfeit their sovereignty by signing this covenant. After making this status survey this group can draw upon the voluntary services of lawyers to draft a model legislation for adoption by countries which are in principle willing to adopt such a legislation but are not doing so because this is a relatively low priority item in their agenda. In the meantime it can be a subtheme for its annual conferences.\n\nSee also:\n\n• \"Message to the World\" (Video edited by Linda Hartling from PowerPoint prepared on November 10, 2021), contribution to the 2021 Workshop on Transforming Humiliation and Violent Conflict, Virtual, Columbia University, New York City, December 9 – 11, 2021.\n\nMICHAEL L.

Perlin has devoted his career to championing legal rights for people with mental disabilities. A prolific author of fifteen books and well over 175 scholarly articles on all aspects of mental disability law, Professor Perlin says that his ninth book, The Hidden Prejudice: Mental Disability on Trial (2000), represents my lifetime work. The book is an attempt to educate society about how the fear of persons with mental illness creates a hidden bias against them that prevents equal justice, a form of discrimination he calls sanism. In his book and his other work, he speaks out against sanism, which he defines as the irrational prejudice that causes, and is reflected in, prevailing social attitudes toward persons with mental disabilities.\n\nMichael Perlin is an award-winning author on mental disability law and insanity defense. He serves on the Board of Directors of International Academy of Law and Mental Health and lectures frequently in Central and Eastern Europe and elsewhere on international human rights and mental disability law. He testifies in trials as expert witness on questions of effectiveness of counsel in cases involving mentally disabled criminal defendants.\n\nHis courses address Civil Procedure, Criminal Law & Procedure: The Mentally Disabled Defendant, Criminal Procedure: Adjudication Mental Disability Litigation Seminar & Workshop, Mental Health Law, and Therapeutic Jurisprudence.\n\nHis educational background is as follows: Rutgers, A.B. 1966, magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, Columbia, J.D. 1969, Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar (Kent Commentaries, Managing Editor), Law Clerk, Hon. Sidney Goldmann, Appellate Division, Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Clerk, Hon. Ralph L. Fusco, Law Division, Superior Court of New Jersey.\n\nA teacher-lawyer-advocate who advises mental health professionals, hospitals, advocates, activists, lawyers, and governments, Professor Perlin has worked directly on mental disability cases as a deputy public defender and as director of the Division of Mental Health Advocacy in the New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate. He has witnessed the complexities and frustrations facing both judges and attorneys with such cases.\n\nProfessor Perlin travels around the globe to speak out about the legal rights of people with mental disabilities. In conjunction with Mental Disability Rights International, a U.S.-based human rights advocacy organization, he has presented mental disability training workshops in Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Uruguay. As part of his work with the Justice Action Center, he has traveled twice to Taiwan in an effort to help create a pan-Asian mental disability advocacy network.\n\nIn 2002, he helped organize a symposium at New York Law School on International Human Rights Law and the Institutional Treatment of Persons with Mental Disabilities: The Case of Hungary. It was the first such U.S. gathering, bringing together prominent activists, advocates, and attorneys to look at the application of international human rights law to improve the treatment of people with mental disabilities.\n\nHis multivolume treatise, Mental Disability Law: Civil and Criminal (Lexis Law Publishing, 19982003), which was first published in 1989 by Michie, won the 1990 Walter Jeffords Writing Prize; the five-volume second edition of that treatise won the Otto Walter Writing Award in 2003 and is the indispensable authority for legal practitioners. Another book, The Jurisprudence of the Insanity Defense (Carolina Academic Press, 1994), won the Manfred Guttmacher Award of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law as the best book of the year in law and forensic psychiatry in 199495. He was given the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law's Amicus Award in 1998.\n\nSince he joined the faculty in 1984, Professor Perlin has helped build the course offering in his legal specialty at New York Law School to such an extent that it now leads the nation in mental disability law curricula. He created and teaches the first online courses on mental disability law, offered to students here, at other U.S.-based law schools, as well as in Japan and in Nicaragua. There are currently four courses in the online program, and more will be added in the immediate future.\n\nProfessor Perlin has many other passions outside the law, including the clarinet, fishing, and the music of Bob Dylan.\n\nPlease see:\n\n• \"Friend to the Martyr, a Friend to the Woman of Shame\": Thinking About The Law and Humiliation, his presentation presented at the 2006 Workshop on Humiliation and Violent Conflict, Columbia University, New York City, December 14-15, 2006.\n\nPlease see here a collection of the following papers:\n\n• An Internet-based Mental Disability Law Program: Implications for Social Change in Nations with Developing Economies, 30 Fordham Int'l L.J. 435 (2007)\n\n• \"And My Best Friend, My Doctor/ Won't Even Say What It Is I've Got : The Role and Significance of Counsel in Right to Refuse Treatment Cases, 42 San Diego L.
