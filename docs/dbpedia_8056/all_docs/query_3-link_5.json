        "text": "Meridian to Exhibit Paintings by Renowned Russian Artist\n\nOpened on November 14, 2008, and on display until March 8, 2009, Meridian International Center presents selections from âThe Timkov Collectionâ, provided by Timothy and Lisa Wyman, featuring remarkable landscapes by renowned Russian painter Nikolai Efimovich Timkov (1912-1993). Dr. Alison Hilton, an eminent scholar of Russian art history and Chair of the Department of Art and Art History at Georgetown University, will serve as co-curator of the exhibition.\n\nA holder of the title of âHonorable Artist of the Russian Federationâ, Timkov is represented in major public collections including the State Russian Museum and the St. Petersburg Museum of History. Dr. Albert Kostenevich, Impressionist Curator at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, has characterized him as âthe greatest Russian Impressionist landscape painterâ of the second and third quarters of the 20th century.\n\nNikolai Timkov was born to a farming family in the years prior to the Russian Revolution. Growing up in a village located along the lower Don River instilled in him a lifelong appreciation for rural life and nature. This influence can be seen in his remarkable depictions of small communities, winter landscapes, and the Ural Mountains â all portrayed in vibrant colors with a deft hand.\n\nTimkov began painting as a youth and later studied at the Academy of Arts in present-day St. Petersburg. In this setting, he was influenced by the works of great Russian landscape painters, among them Levitan, Shishkin, and Brodsky. During the course of his long career he also incorporated elements found in works by French Impressionists. Timkov regularly returned to favorite rural places to paint these locales in different seasons. His landscapes embody the close relationship between the people of Russia and their land.\n\nThis exhibition, involving the Embassy of the Russian Federation, provides a wonderful opportunity for Meridian to work closely with Russia at a crucial time of leadership change."
