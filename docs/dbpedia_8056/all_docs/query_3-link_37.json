        "text": "Artistic Philosophy\n\nI love color! Color excites me! Color motivates me! As a culture, we dont use enough color in our working and living environments.\n\nTo bring color into my life, I paint realistic fruits and flowers. Fruits are subtle, luscious, and soothing. Flowers are dramatic, vibrant, and enchanting. In painting them, I try to capture that moment in time when they are visually most stimulating.\n\nBecause we often dont take the time to really see the beauty of nature, I strive to have my paintings move the viewer to see the spectacular splendor that surrounds us. I hope that they allow the viewer to pause and see nature in a new way.\n\nArticles about:\n\nSouthwestArt Magazine\n\nArtists to Watch\n\nMay 2001, p. 30\n\nHere we have IDAHO\n\nThe University of Idaho Magazine\n\nWinter 2000, p. 15\n\nMOSCOW-PULLMAN DAILY NEWS\n\nApril 3, 1997, p. 1B\n\nExhibitions:\n\nJune 11-July 9, 2004 Columbine Gallery, Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\n(Show with sculptures of C.T.
