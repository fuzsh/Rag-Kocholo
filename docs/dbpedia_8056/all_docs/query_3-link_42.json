        "text": "By Sue Dolamore\n\nRichard Oversmith studied in Michigan at the Kendall College of Art and Design, and in the UK, at the Royal College of Art in London. He is one of our local stars of plein air; internationally recognized, featured in Fine Arts Connoisseur, Outdoor Painter and Plein Air magazines. He participates in big events like Easton and the upcoming Olmstead event in Atlanta (April 25 – May 1). He has painted in the US, Europe and beyond. His subjects include landscapes,beaches, buildings, boats, and you name it. He also paints beautiful still life in his home studio. You can see a gallery of his work on his website. www.richardoversmith.com. You will also find there a blog with some informative posts about his process and work.\n\nI had a couple of great phone conversations with Richard in preparation for his upcoming demonstration for the Asheville Urban Landscape Project Featured Artists Series on Tuesday, April 19th, from 9:30am – 12:30pm in Biltmore Village. I’d met Richard before when he demonstrated for AULP last year at the Blue Ridge Assembly. He is personable and willing to share. I love that generosity and was excited to speak with him again.\n\nInfluences and education. Richard always thought of himself as an artist…it is just what he is. So he went to some schools and studied, probably with great people and got his start in that way but when I asked him what influenced him, he began talking quite passionately and immediately about Russian impressionists. These guys have clearly lit a fire for him. Why? Because they have what he describes as an authenticity that is rarely seen. I am still not sure I completely understand what Richard means by this, but I think it is about a bold and gritty approach to painting that reflects the life of these painters. Richard talked about how their lives were not easy, many of them were farmers, which we all know is demanding work, both physically and emotionally. There are struggles that come along with working the land. Taking all the insight and emotion that a subsistence farming life fosters to a canvas, when standing before a scene of your everyday life, shows up as a rich earthly basis topped with vibrant, colorful images of a life that nature bestows on us. Even amidst the hard work of an agrarian life, the artist is capturing the beauty of it. So among the grays and earth tones that are predominant, there is brightness and color, the light as it moves, and that is what pops. These Impressionists had to work quickly, as we all do, if we are to capture that glorious moment in an otherwise common scene. They did it with confidence and boldness. This is the essence that Richard is also working to grab in his picture making. So perhaps more than technique, though that is foundational and clearly there, the thing that makes the work grand is that confidence, working quickly and consciously, that renders a painting that is full of life and energy.\n\nHe also values the way that some of these Russian painters brought design into their work in a way that was different from French and other Western impressionists. In the Russian culture and in their folk art, fabric design, etc, you often see detailed decorative aspects. Somehow this aesthetic is infused into the visual perception of these painters and they bring to their work a sense of liberty in arranging their composition and colors that enriches the final work. Richard sees how various techniques contribute to a poetic quality. There is a strong mood present, often generated by use of texture, edges soft and hard, and color variations within big shapes. One example is a sky that has multiple blues within it. He mentioned many Russian impressionists that he not only admires, but studies. As we chatted, he was at one point scrolling through images of their works that he has collected, enthusiastically commenting on things he admires in them.\n\nI have since explored some of these and provide these links so that you may do the same if you choose. This is only a starting point and may lead you to many more as you will find other artists who either painted with them, taught or influenced these.\n\nArkady Plastov\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Plastov\n\nIsaac Levitan\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Levitan\n\nNikolai Timkov\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Timkov\n\nApproach to painting\n\nPainting is never a labor for Richard. He loves his work.\n\nHe has developed a sense of what is important for him as he paints:\n\nAccept that progress towards mastery takes time.\n\nRecognize that one must bring passion to have high quality of work\n\nBe fast and deliberate, place the paint down with confidence.\n\nOnce painting, do not over think the technical stuff\n\nDo your own thing.\n\nDo not blend paint on the canvas….put it down and leave it.\n\nStarts with darker darks, very quickly put down composition, then work the big shapes.\n\nFocus and be deliberate, making the effort to get the light right.\n\nDo not overthink getting accurate color, everyone sees color differently\n\nRichard adds that he sometimes uses one brush for entire painting.\n\nHe works all over the canvas at the same time and uses from 4 to 12 colors on his palette. For a landscape he may have, for instance; 3 yellows, 3 reds, 2 blues, 1 green and white. He paints with locally made Blue Ridge Oils, painting on Belgian linen which he buys in rolls. Brushes are not that important to him in terms of who makes them; he looks for brushes that have the feel that he wants.\n\nIn terms of subject matter, he paints what ignites a passion while also considering what will sell. Then a smaller portion of his work is purely for his own pleasure without consideration for it’s final showplace.\n\nWhere he is going from here?\n\nRichard has been painting professionally for over 20 years and still has great passion to evolve his work. He wants to be more authentic, gritty, bold, and free. He is playing with using texture and though he has used a palette knife infrequently, he is openly experimenting with it along with other elements of color and style. He continues to study his favorite masters while he works to develop his own expression as authentically as possible.\n\nLife as a working artist\n\nRichard now and for many years supports himself with his art, something that takes a huge commitment and dedication. He has a wife and children. He manages his time with a consistent daily schedule that begins with getting his girls off to school. He returns home to paint, usually for about 3 hours each day. In the afternoons, he takes care of the business side of his art career. He picks his kids up from school and the family spends the evening together.\n\nWhile his work is in many galleries, where he does well, he is also selling work on facebook. He says is important to show your work and social media is one place not to be overlooked. Richard has bought advertising in swanky magazines but can not attest to sales from those efforts. He has a belief in himself and his work that keeps him relatively relaxed about his income through market fluctuations.\n\nWhat Richard models for fellow artists:"
