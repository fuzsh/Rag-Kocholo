        "text": "At his 1993 exhibition, the year of his passing, Nikolai Timkov, one of the most important Russian landscape painters of the 20th Century, revealed himself as a deeply sympathetic artist. He was viewed as a composer arranging colors whose sounds vividly echo symphonies by Kalinnikov and Borodin. The exhibition celebrated his life’s work, as he died shortly afterwards. This last show was the monumental summation of an honored painter. The public in attendance was shaken with the integrity and wholeness of his artistic outlook, his perceptions, and his consummate spiritual awareness. It signified the emergence of a classic Russian artist whose works are viewed as those of a highly distinguished and original master.\n\nBorn in on the steppes of temperate southern Russia in 1912, Nikolai became a student at the Rostov Art College in 1927 and graduated in 1930. He then traveled to Moscow where he attended the Academy of Arts at the invitation of famous academician and painter, Isaak Brodsky. Brodsky’s influence bound him to the best traditions of Russian art of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Timkov graduated in 1939 as a professional painter and then, in accordance with the law, was immediately called up for military service with the Russian Navy, serving until 1946. His service to his country took him through World War II.\n\nMilitary service and the war behind him, Timkov’s career was highlighted by several major one-man exhibitions prior to his last. The shows represented extended periods of his artistic work and became important stages of his growth both spiritually and artistically. Throughout this time, he formed his unique approach to landscape painting, which has become known as “the Timkov style”, discernible through his compositional peculiarities, artistic solutions, palette and characteristic brush work.\n\nTimkov traveled extensively through west central Russia and was particularly fond of the landscape there. His landscapes, always concrete in detail, are also generalized by symbolic meaning. His temples and monasteries tower grandly towards the heavens and are secure structures full of pride seeming to crown the beauty of the landscape. Villages and wooden huts appear to cling to Mother-Earth as if drawing warmth from her. They become blurred against the background of trees and bushes as though trying to wrap themselves in the snow. His keen eye allows us to be aware of every tree, branch and twig, whether hidden beneath the lace of snowflakes, covered in the transparent ornament of spring foliage, or standing in severe winter nakedness.\n\nNikolai Timkov, sometimes referred to as the “Dean of Post-War Russian Impressionism”, is hung in some of the most exclusive public and private collections throughout Russian, the United States and Western Europe.\n\nPUBLIC COLLECTIONS and PRINCIPAL EXHIBITIONS\n\nPUBLIC COLLECTIONS\n\nAbramtsevo: State Museum of History, Arts, and Literature.\n\nBeloretsk: Beloretsk Picture Gallery\n\nBerdiansk: I.I.Brodsky Art Museum\n\nBriansk: Art Museum of the Briansk Region\n\nVladimir: Vladimir-Suzdal State Museum of History and Architecture\n\nVyshnyi Volochok: Local branch of the Kalinin State Museum of History and Architecture\n\nGorlovka (Donetsk region): Gorlovka State Museum\n\nGorokhovets (Vladymir region): Museum of Local Lore, History and Economy\n\nIzhevsk: Udmurtia Art Museum\n\nIoshkor-Ola: Mari Exhibition Hall\n\nKazan: Tataria Art Museum\n\nKalinin: Kalinin Picture Gallery\n\nComsomolsk-on-Amur: Museum of Soviet Arts\n\nKurgan: Kurgan Art Museum\n\nKonstantinnivsk (Rostov region): City Art Museum\n\nLeningrad (St. Petersburg):\n\nState Museum of the History of Leningrad\n\nState Russian Museum\n\nCentral Naval Museum\n\nPopov’s Central Museum of Communications\n\nMoscow:\n\nCentral Army Museum\n\nRepublic Center for Art Exhibitions\n\nTretyakov State Gallery\n\nMoscow region: Sovkhoz Voronovo Art Gallery\n\nNovgorod: Novgorod State Museum of History, Architecture and Art\n\nNovokuznetsk (Kemerovo region): Novokuznetsk Museum of Soviet Art\n\nOmsk: Museum of Arts\n\nOryol: State Picture Gallery\n\nOrenburg: Museum of Arts\n\nRostov-on-Don:\n\nMuseum of Arts\n\nMuseum of Local Lore, History and Economy\n\nEkaterinburg (Sverdlovsk): Museum of Arts\n\nCheboksary: Chuvashi State Art Gallery\n\nShadrinsk (Kurgan region): Museum of Local Lore, History and Economy and various picture galleries and other institutions\n\nAltai region: Pavlovsk Picture Gallery\n\nPskov region: (Novorzhev area): Vekhnyanskaya Art Gallery\n\nTomsk: Experimental and Production Holding\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota USA: The Museum of Russian Art\n\nPARTIAL LIST of PRINCIPAL EXHIBITIONS\n\nAll-Union Exhibition Heroic Front and Home Front, State Tretiakov Gallery, Moscow, 1943.\n\nExhibition of young artists, dedicated to the 25th Anniversary of the Lenin Comsomol, State Tretiakov Gallery, Moscow.\n\nFirst Exhibition of the Leningrad Frontline Artists, House of the Red Army, Leningrad.\n\nFirst Exhibition of the Leningrad Frontline Artists, Frunze House of the Red Army, Moscow, 1943.\n\nSecond Exhibition of the Leningrad Frontline Artists, State Russian Museum, Leningrad, 1944.\n\nThird Exhibition of the Leningrad Frontline Artists, Academy of Arts, Leningrad, 1945.\n\nFirst One-Man Exhibition of Timkov’s works, Russian Federation of Artists, Leningrad Branch, 1947.\n\nTraveling Exhibition of Leningrad Artists, House of Arts Named for K.S.

Gumilev, Drevnyaya Rus i Velikaya Step (Ancient Russia and the Great Steppe), Moscow: Mysl, 1989.\n\nThe literature on the Academic Dacha is extensive. The fullest documentary coverage is provided by I. Romanycheva, Academicheskaya dacha (The Academic Dacha), Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1975. The remaining publications are of a more popular nature, including: A. Berezin, Solnechnyy. Khudozhestvennaya galereya (Solnechnyy. Art Gallery), Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1982; V.M. Sidorov, Kray udozkhnoveniya (The Land of Inspiration), Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1986. None of the publications, even the artist V. Sidorov’s undoubtedly excellent book (in literary terms), are free of the pressure of official orthodox concepts of the development of Russian art, which is hardly surprising bearing in mind the time in which they were published.\n\nDuring Timkov’s lifetime; 1912-1993, there were no publications devoted to his work, save for an insignificant exhibition booklet. The artist’s legacy was similarly unlucky-it was on the verge of physical destruction after the artist’s death and was only preserved thanks to the efforts of the former Pushkin Collection, now the Timkov Collection. It was part of this project that the first monograph on the artist was published; The Seasons of Nikolai Efimovich Timkov: Master Russian Impressionist, Albuquerque, New Mexico: The Pushkin Collection, 1998.\n\nArtists of Leningrad: A collection of articles/Compiled by I.N.

In each case artists settled in the country and worked in the open air, yet Abramtsevo was above all a noble estate, one of those “cultural nests” where the owners were fully conscious of their role not merely as welcoming hosts but as organizers of cultural life and of specific and theatrical projects in which artists were specially invited to take part. Thus Savva Mamontov, the famous industrialist and patron who purchased Abramtsevo, pressured his guests into the realization of cultural programs - the revival of folk crafts, the collecting of folk art, the development of Russian applied art in a local version of the Art Nouveau style. The element of organization, of centralized artistic activity, sets this center apart from Western artists colonies, founded as they were on the principles of self-organization and individualism.\n\nShekhter, T.Ye.

At the station they were awaited in the old days by carts with horses, and in modern days by car or bus. Later they introduced a boat from Vysnyy Volochok, and even later they put asphalt on the road from town and put a bus into action,” recalled the artist’s son. V.N.
