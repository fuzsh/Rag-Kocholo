His father taught mathematics at the Leningrad Institute of Railroad Transport Engineers.\n\nIn 1947 Nikolai Pozdneev goes to Secondary Art School at the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, which ends in 1950. In the same year he entered at the first course of the painting department of the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin. His teachers were Alexander Debler, Elena Tabakova, Andrei Mylnikov, Vladislav Anisovich.\n\nIn 1956 Nikolai Pozdneev graduated of the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin in Victor Oreshnikov workshop. His graduation work was genre painting named \"From the school\", dedicated to the theme of childhood in the Soviet art of the end of 1950s[2] (currently in the collection of Pskov Art Gallery).[3] In one year with Pozdneev Institute graduates Engels Kozlov, Yaroslav Krestovsky, Piotr Nazarov, Anatoli Nenartovich, Leonid Fokin, Vsevolod Petrov-Maslakov, Lenina Guley, and other young artists who later became famous Soviet painters and art educators.\n\nNikolai Pozdneev graduation picture had opened a whole series of his works by late 1950 - early 1960s dedicated of the childhood theme. Among them some of the most known paintings \"A Spring day\" (1959), \"Natasha in baby-carriage\" (1960), \"A Fall day\" (1961).\n\nAfter graduation Pozdneev paints under contracts with the Leningrad branch of the Art Fund of the Russian Federation. At the same time working creatively, trying his hand at various genres. Since 1956, participates in the exhibition of Leningrad artists. The very first shown his art works brought him from the Academic Dacha attracted the attention of original snapping manner of paint and the special vision of color. He painted genre scenes, portraits in exterior and interior, landscapes, still lifes, sketches from the life. In 1957 Nikolai Pozdneev was admitted to the Leningrad Union of Artists.\n\nAll the subsequent bright, brief, and dramatic fate of Nikolai Pozdneev was closely associated with the picturesque surroundings of the Academic Dacha and Tver lands. He had lived and worked in village of Maliy Gorodok in the house of his wife Vera Vasilievna.[4] In the nearby villages lived Nikolai Timkov, Maya Kopitseva, Alexander Romanichev, Vecheslav Zagonek, Anatoli Vasiliev, Anatoli Levitin, Dmitry Maevsky, Vladimir Tokarev, and many other artists from the Leningrad and Moscow.\n\nIn 1960s and 1970s life of Nikolai Pozdneev, likes many other artists, clearly divided into two seasons: a city period from a late fall through April, and countryside period from April to November. Life in the city consisted of putting the customer and works to find new art contracts, Art Show, Artists' Union, contacts with friends and neighbours of the city art studio. Summer time at first of all is creativity, paint from the life.\n\nLiving and working at the \"Academichka\" Nikolai Pozdneev not only painted many of his best works, but also formed his unique individual manner by which artist's work has become a phenomenon in the life of the Leningrad Union of Artists.\n\nOne can only admire the strength and originality of talent artist through which the young man from a family of urban intellectuals created such profound paintings, clearly expressing poetry and the texture of rural countryside life.\n\nPictures painted in the late 1950s - the first half of 1960 pushed Pozdneev of the leading painters of Leningrad. Among them such works as \"A Spring\"[5] (1957), \"In the spring\",[6] \"A Bakery\", \"Across the river\", \"Spring sketch\"[7] (all 1958), \"Mushrooms. Still Life\", \"A Spring\", \"Kisharino village\",[8] \"A Spring day\",[9] \"In summer at reading\"[10] (all 1959), \"A Summer\", \"Natasha in baby-carriage\", \"Northern Bazaar\", \"A House at the road\",[11] \"Grandmother's House\"[12] (all 1960), \"A Summer\",[13] \"Already spring\", \"A Porch\",[14] \"Autumn day\" (all 1961), \"Baskets\"[15] (1962), \"Defoliation\"[16] (1963), \"Still Life in the grass\",[17] \"Shelf\", \"Bullfinchs\", \"Smoked vobla\", \"At the lawn\", \"At the aunt Sasha\", \"Rowan-tree\"[18] (all 1964), and others.\n\nFirst of all, in paintings of late 1950 - early 1960s Nikolai Pozdneev revealed as a talented colorist, has a rare natural sense of color. His painting style features a powerful broad paint, energetic separate swab and complex texture of painting, original composition and artistry of execution.\n\nBut perhaps the main feature of his style it is striking at first glance at his paintings was their original line-up. Nikolai Pozdneev had a rare gift as everyday painter and colorist. It seems all that surrounded him, was at hand, any thing, piece of furniture or household stage, he easily could turn into an original and profound poetic image.\n\nIt was the natural state of the artist, that we call a natural gift, talent, and not strained to stand out. In his still lifes, genre scenes Nikolai Pozdneev conveyed a sense of the his time, of simple human relations. His art, like the master himself, was a kind and ingenuous, full of optimism, sometimes ironic, and speaks of the fullness of life.\n\nIn 1960-1970s Pozdneev trips to Kandalaksha, the Ural Region, along the banks of Chusovaya River and Vyatka River, working in the houses of artistic creation in Hot Key, Staraya Ladoga, Akademicheakaya Dacha.
