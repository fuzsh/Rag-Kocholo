        "text": "Kazimir Severinovich Malevich (Russian: Казимир Северинович Малевич [kɐzʲɪˈmʲir sʲɪvʲɪˈrʲinəvʲɪt͡ɕ mɐˈlʲevʲɪt͡ɕ], Polish: Kazimierz Malewicz, Ukrainian: Казимир Северинович Малевич [kazɪˈmɪr sɛwɛˈrɪnɔwɪtʃ mɑˈlɛwɪtʃ], German: Kasimir Malewitsch, (February 23, 1879, previously 1878: see below – May 15, 1935) was a Russian painter and art theoretician, born of ethnic Polish parents. He was a pioneer of geometric abstract art and the originator of the Avant-garde Suprematist movement.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n1.1 Birth date\n\n2 Work\n\n2.1 Suprematism\n\n3 Post-revolution\n\n4 International recognition and banning\n\n5 Death\n\n6 Posthumous sales\n\n7 Malevich in popular culture\n\n8 Selected works\n\n8.1 Gallery\n\n9 See also\n\n10 Notes\n\n11 References\n\n12 External links and references\n\nEarly life\n\nKazimir Malevich was born near Kiev in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire. His parents, Seweryn and Ludwika Malewicz, were ethnic Poles,[1] and he was baptised in the Roman Catholic Church. His father managed a sugar factory. Kazimir was the first of 14 children, only nine of which survived into adulthood. His family moved often and he spent most of his childhood in the villages of Ukraine amidst sugar-beet plantations, far from centers of culture. Until age 12 he knew nothing of professional artists, though art had surrounded him in childhood. He delighted in peasant embroidery, and in decorated walls and stoves. He himself was able to paint in the peasant style. He studied drawing in Kiev from 1895 to 1896.\n\nRecently Ukrainian art historians established the precise birthdate of the artist: February 23, 1879. Professor D. Gorbachev, in his 2006 book Malevich and Ukraine, (published in Kiev) reveals many new biographical details. French art historian Andrei Nakov re-established Malevich's birth year as 1879 (and not 1878), and argues for restoration of the Polish spelling of his name.\n\nWork\n\nFrom 1896 to 1904 Kazimir Malevich lived in Kursk. In 1904, after the death of his father, he moved to Moscow. He studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture from 1904 to 1910 and in the studio of Fedor Rerberg in Moscow (1904 to 1910). In 1911 he participated in the second exhibition of the group Soyuz Molodyozhi (Union of Youth) in St. Petersburg, together with Vladimir Tatlin and, in 1912, the group held its third exhibition, which included works by Aleksandra Ekster, Tatlin and others. In the same year he participated in an exhibition by the collective Donkey's Tail in Moscow. By that time his works were influenced by Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, Russian avant-garde painters who were particularly interested in Russian folk art called lubok. In March 1913 a major exhibition of Aristarkh Lentulov's paintings opened in Moscow. The effect of this exhibition was comparable with that of Paul Cézanne in Paris in 1907, as all the main Russian avant-garde artists of the time (including Malevich) immediately absorbed the cubist principles and began using them in their works. Already in the same year the Cubo-Futurist opera Victory Over the Sun with Malevich's stage-set became a great success. In 1914 Malevich exhibited his works in the Salon des Independants in Paris together with Alexander Archipenko, Sonia Delaunay, Aleksandra Ekster and Vadim Meller, among others.\n\nSuprematism\n\nIn 1915, Malevich laid down the foundations of Suprematism when he published his manifesto From Cubism to Suprematism. In 1915–1916 he worked with other Suprematist artists in a peasant/artisan co-operative in Skoptsi and Verbovka village. In 1916–1917 he participated in exhibitions of the Jack of Diamonds group in Moscow together with Nathan Altman, David Burliuk and A. Ekster, among others. Famous examples of his Suprematist works include Black Square (1915)[2] and White on White (1918).\n\nIn 1918, Malevich decorated a play, Mystery Bouffe, by Vladimir Mayakovskiy produced by Vsevolod Meyerhold.\n\nHe was also interested in aerial photography and aviation, which led him to abstractions inspired by or derived from aerial landscapes. As Professor Julia Bekman Chadaga (now of Macalaster College [1]) writes:\n\nIn his later writings, Malevich defined the \"additional element\" as the quality of any new visual environment bringing about a change in perception... In a series of diagrams illustrating the \"environments\" that influence various painterly styles, the Suprematist is associated with a series of aerial views rendering the familiar landscape into an abstraction... (excerpted from Ms. Bekman Chadaga's paper delivered at Columbia University's 2000 symposium, \"Art, Technology, and Modernity in Russia and Eastern Europe\")\n\nPost-revolution\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Malevich became a member of the Collegium on the Arts of Narkompros, the Commission for the Protection of Monuments and the Museums Commission (all from 1918–1919). He taught at the Vitebsk Practical Art School in the USSR (now part of Belarus) (1919–1922), the Leningrad Academy of Arts (1922–1927), the Kiev State Art Institute (1927–1929), and the House of the Arts in Leningrad (1930). He wrote the book The World as Non-Objectivity published in Munich 1926, only translated into English in 1959. In it he outlines his Suprematist theories.\n\nIn 1923, Malevich was appointed director of Petrograd State Institute of Artistic Culture, which was forced to close in 1926 after a Communist party newspaper called it \"a government-supported monastery\" rife with \"counterrevolutionary sermonizing and artistic debauchery.\" The Soviet state was by then heavily promoting a politically sustainable style of art called Social Realism — a style Malevich had spent his entire career repudiating. Nevertheless, he swam with the current, and was quietly tolerated by the Communists.[3]\n\nInternational recognition and banning\n\nIn 1927, he travelled to Warsaw and then to Berlin and Munich for a retrospective which finally brought him international recognition. He arranged to leave most of the paintings behind when he returned to the Soviet Union. Malevich's assumption that a shifting in the attitudes of the Soviet authorities towards the modernist art movement would take place after the death of Lenin and Trotsky's fall from power, was proven correct in a couple of years, when the Stalinist regime turned against forms of abstraction, considering them a type of \"bourgeois\" art, that could not express social realities. As a consequence, many of his works were confiscated and he was banned from creating and exhibiting similar art.\n\nCritics derided Malevich for reaching art by negating everything good and pure: love of life and love of nature. The Westernizer artist and art historian Alexandre Benois was one such critic. Malevich responded that art can advance and develop for art's sake alone, regardless of its pleasure saying that \"art does not need us, and it never did\".\n\nMalevich's work only recently reappeared in art exhibitions in Russia after a long absence. Since then art followers have labored to reintroduce the artist to Russian lovers of painting. A book of his theoretical works with an anthology of reminiscences and writings has been published.\n\nDeath\n\nMalevich died of cancer in Leningrad on May 15, 1935. On his deathbed he was exhibited with the black square above him, and mourners at his funeral rally were permitted to wave a banner bearing a black square.[3] His ashes were sent to Nemchinovka, and buried in a field near his dacha. A white cube decorated with a black square was placed on his tomb. The city of Leningrad bestowed a pension on Malevich's mother and daughter. \"No phenomenon is mortal,\" Malevich wrote in an unpublished manuscript, \"and this means not only the body but the idea as well, a symbol that one is eternally reincarnated in another form which actually exists in the conscious and unconscious person.\"\n\nPosthumous sales\n\nBlack Square, the fourth version of his magnum opus painted in the 1920s was discovered in 1993 in Samara and purchased by Inkombank for $250,000.[4] In April 2002 the painting was auctioned for an equivalent of one million dollars. The purchase was financed by the Russian philanthropist Vladimir Potanin, who donated funds to Russian Ministry of Culture[5] and ultimately to State Hermitage Museum collection.[4] According to the Hermitage website, this was the largest private contribution to state art museums since the October Revolution.[5]\n\nOn November 3, 2008 a work by Malevich entitled Suprematist Composition from 1916 set the world record for any Russian work of art and any work sold at auction for that year, selling at Sotheby’s in New York City for just over $60 million U.S. (far surpassing his previous record of $17 million set in 2000).\n\nHe was awarded the highest category \"1A - a world famous artist\" in \"United Artists Rating\".\n\nMalevich in popular culture\n\nMalevich life inspires many references featuring events and the paintings themselves as players. The smuggling of Malevich paintings out of Russia is a key to the plot line of writer Martin Cruz Smith's thriller Red Square. Noah Charney's novel, The Art Thief tells the story of two stolen Malevich White on White paintings, and discusses the implications of Malevich's radical Suprematist compositions on the art world. British artist Keith Coventry has used Malevich's paintings to make comments on modernism, in particular his Estate Paintings. Malevich's work is also featured prominently in the Lars Von Trier film Melancholia.\n\nSelected works\n\n1912 Morning in the Country after Snowstorm\n\n1912 The Woodcutter\n\n1912-13 Reaper on Red Background\n\n1914 The Aviator\n\n1914 An Englishman in Moscow\n\n1914 Soldier of the First Division\n\n1915 Black Square and Red Square\n\n1915 Red Square: Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimensions\n\n1915 Suprematist Composition\n\n1915 Suprematism (1915)\n\n1915 Suprematist Painting: Aeroplane Flying\n\n1915 Suprematism: Self-Portrait in Two Dimensions\n\n1915-16 Suprematist Painting (Ludwigshafen)\n\n1916 Suprematist Painting (1916)\n\n1916 Supremus No. 56\n\n1916-17 Suprematism (1916–17)\n\n1917 Suprematist Painting (1917)\n\n1928-32 Complex Presentiment: Half-Figure in a Yellow Shirt\n\n1932-34 Running Man\n\nGallery\n\nFlower Girl, 1903\n\nBathers, 1908\n\nWinter, 1909\n\nTaking in the Rye, 1911\n\nThe Knifegrinder, 1912\n\nHead of a Peasant Girl, 1912-1913\n\nBureau and Room, 1913\n\nPortrait of Matiushin, 1913\n\nCow and Fiddle, 1913\n\nEnglishman in Moscow, 1914\n\nComposition with the Mona Lisa, 1914\n\nBlack Circle, signed 1913, painted 1915\n\nSuprematist Composition, 1916\n\nSuprematism (Self-Portrait), 1916\n\nSuprematism, Museum of Art, Krasnodar 1916\n\nSuprematism, 1921-1927\n\nBoy, 1928-1932\n\nRed-cavalry, 1928-1932\n\nSummer Landscape, 1929\n\nMower, 1930\n\nRunning man, 1932\n\nComplex Presentiment: Half-Figure in a Yellow Shirt, 1928-1932\n\nSee also\n\nAerial landscape art\n\nEl Lissitzky\n\nIRWIN\n\nLyubov Popova\n\nOBERIU\n\nRabo Karabekian\n\nSuprematism\n\nSupremus\n\nSuprematist Composition\n\nUNOVIS\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAndrei Nakov Kasimir Malevich, Catalogue raisonné, Paris, Adam Biro, 2002\n\nAndrei Nakov vol.
