The subjects of Realist paintings were industrial, non-exotic, and often ugly. Less about appearing realistic, Realist artists seeked to show their subject's reality without sugarcoating it. Working class people were often subjects in realist paintings. Ths list of artists includes Rembrandt, Edward Hooper, Gustave Courbet, and many additional artists as well.\n\nThis list answers the questions, \"Who are the most famous Realism artists?\" and \"Who are the best Realism artists?\"\n\nAlmost every well-known or influential figure in this movement is listed below. You can use the artists in this list to create a new list, re-rank it to fit your opinion, then publish it."
