        "text": "Claude Shannon\n\nEarly Years\n\nBorn in Petosky, Michigan\n\nGrew up in Gaylord, Michigan\n\nMother was a high school principal\n\nFather was a Probate Judge\n\nEarly Years\n\nEarly

Institute for Advanced Study\n\nNational Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study for the year following\n\nThis place should sound familiar by now.\n\nWorked under mathematician Herman Weyl, interacted with:\n\nJohn von Neumann: “He was the smartest person I ever met”\n\nKurt Gödel\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nDoctorate and Institute for Advanced Study\n\nSide story:\n\n\"Einstein once showed up for one of Shannon’s lectures, but was apparently looking for the tea room and left.”\n\nBell Labs\n\nUnderstands that he wants to solve problems related to the transmission of information\n\nReturns to Bell Labs in summer of 1941\n\nOne small event prevents from focusing on his interests: World War II\n\nBell Labs\n\nTo help the war effort, Shannon works under the National Defense Research Committee\n\nNDRC established by FDR and headed by Vannevar Bush\n\nWorks under Hendrik Bode to develop “software” for fire control systems\n\nHeavily influenced by previous work of Norbert Weiner\n\nSaw analogy between removing interference in communication signals and errors in tracking signals\n\nBell Labs\n\nAlso works in cryptography at Bell Labs\n\nAsked to inspect the encryption of a secure digital communication system, X System or SIGSALY\n\nUsed for secure communications between the United States and the UK during WWII\n\nInteractions were restricted, but he met a mathematician by the name Alan Turing\n\nTuring came to Bell Labs in January 1943 and stayed for 2 months\n\nSpoke about common interests outside of work\n\nShannon said he received “a fair amount of negative feedback”\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Cryptography\n\nClassified report by Shannon which was published in 1945\n\nApplied probability theory to cryptography\n\nRigorously used mathematics to prove aspects of cryptography, like how a random one-time pad encryption scheme is unbreakable\n\nThe declassified version of this report was released in 1949 under the title Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Cryptography\n\nMuch of the concepts introduced would be later used in his later work on information theory\n\nOne footnote of this paper literally announces the future work:\n\n“It is intended to develop these results in a coherent fashion in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information.\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nShannon’s seminal work (at least in his opinion) which was published in 1948\n\nWork with information theory was unofficial, unlike with fire control systems and cryptography\n\nMost ideas were developed from 1943 to 1945, but delayed due to the war\n\nWar also helped though, through his time spent with cryptography\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nA start for Shannon’s idea came from “Hartley’s paper”\n\nRalph Hartley was a Bell Labs researcher, published Transmission of Information in 1925\n\nAttempted to quantitatively measure the transmission of information\n\nNyquist’s work on sampling and bandwidth of transmission mediums also greatly impacted Shannon\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nAt the time, communications remained split:\n\nMilitary kept radar under a cloak of secrecy\n\nAT&T was the sole operator of the telephone system\n\nUniversities primarily focused on radio transmissions\n\nShannon’s worked unified many various fields by laying a mathematical foundation irrespective of any particular system or technology\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nFundamental unit of information: a “bit”\n\nAt one lunch, researchers were searching for a term for “binary digit”\n\nJohn Tukey said the “best and obvious choice” was the term bit\n\nShannon viewed information as a measure of uncertainty\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nWe want to view things that are unknown to us, so we learn about them\n\nCommunication then becomes the resolution of uncertainty\n\nUsing his sampling theory derived from Nyquist’s work, any continuous signal can be discretized and turned into a digital one\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nOnce digital, any message can then be encoded in variety of ways\n\nSame number of bits for each symbol\n\nVarying amount of bits per symbol\n\nVarying amount of bits per combinations of symbols\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nWe can analyze the frequency of certain combinations of symbols to compress the transmission\n\nThen leads to the question: How much compression is possible?\n\nShannon’s measure of information tells us how many bits are required to efficiently encode information\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nAnalysis of the structure of a source allows for more efficient encoding by removing redundancy\n\nThis all equals more cat videos\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nBack to redundancy, Shannon showed that adding redundancy allowed for the suppression and correction of errors in the transmission of messages\n\nHowever, redundancy can introduced more intelligently than just repeating the message\n\nSee the work of Richard Hamming and Hamming codes\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nThis paper proves an upper limit for transmitting data for every method of communication\n\nMaximum amount of bits per second\n\nShannon combined the ideas of Hartley and Nyquist, relating bandwidth and error rates, to give a mathematical definition for the capacity of a given channel\n\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\n\nFurthermore, he proved that any method of transmission could be done at capacity and be error-free\n\nThe catch is that he only proved they exist, not how to actually get them\n\nAftermath\n\nAt 32 years old, Shannon garnered interest from around the world with his work\n\nNot all was positive though\n\nMathematician Joseph Doob argued that the proofs were not rigorous enough\n\nPaper was successful due to the pragmatic focus that Shannon had with a background in both mathematics and electrical engineering\n\nAftermath\n\nUltimately, the entirety of A Mathematical Theory of Communication was proven to be correct\n\nAfter meeting in 1948, Shannon marries Mary Elizabeth “Betty” Moore in March of 1949\n\nBetty was a mathematician in her own right at Bell Labs, and would often help Shannon with his idea\n\nAlso, Shannon hated to write and Betty would help dictate in addition to helping Shannon formulate his thoughts\n\nBack to MIT\n\nAfter 15 years with Bell Labs, Shannon leaves in 1956\n\nReturns to MIT in order to maintain the intellectual freedom to pursue his interests\n\nHe began teaching advanced courses in information theory, and MIT became a leading institution in the field\n\nHis personality lead him to avoid much teaching or advising, but he continued pursuing problems\n\nBack to MIT\n\nContributed to work in Artificial Intelligence\n\nSupervised Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy during summer lab jobs, both of whom are pioneers in A.I.\n\nAdvised Leonard Kleinrock and Ivan Sutherland who would go on to work with the Internet and computer graphics respectively\n\nMore about his personal life\n\nHis love of devices continued past his youth\n\nWrote about machines playing chess\n\nCreated a mechanical “mouse” that could solve a maze, part of his work in A.I.\n\nCollaborated to created a machine for card counting then test\n\nTried to build a machine to solve a Rubik’s cube\n\nA calculator that used Roman numerals\n\nMore about his personal life\n\nIn 1951, Betty gave Shannon a unicycle, which he rode in the hallways at Bell Labs\n\nShannon was also an avid juggler which, in tandem with a unicycle, clearly helped him to focus\n\nAllegedly had a trumpet that would shoot fire\n\nLater years\n\nShannon officially retired from MIT in 1978\n\nBy many accounts, he had already retired from teaching, preferring his own interests\n\nApplied mathematics to juggling and published a juggling theorem\n\nWent up to the juggling club at MIT and asked if he could measure them\n\nSoon after, invited them over to watch juggling videos, play with his devices, and eat pizza\n\nDid well financially by investing in tech companies founded by friends\n\nTeledyne\n\nCodex\n\nHewlett-Packard\n\nSometime within the early 1990’s, Shannon developed Alzheimer’s disease\n\n“He vaguely remembered I juggled, and cheerfully showed me the juggling displays in his toy room, as if for the first time. And despite the loss of memory and reason, he was every bit as warm, friendly, and cheerful as the first time I met him.”\n\nAfter spending a few years in a nursing home, Shannon passed away on February 24th, 2001, at the age of 84\n\nHis wife said “He would have been bemused” by the digital world he helped to create\n\nOne last device"
