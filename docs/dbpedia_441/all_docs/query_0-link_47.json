If that donation is made, they will pledge an additional amount of money per gift.\n\nAffinity challenges can be made by class, living unit/fraternity, pledge class, metropolitan area, sports team, student club, scholarship fund, memorial fund, in honor of a professor/coach/student, etc.\n\nIf you are interested in launching an affinity challenge, you must first let the College know about your challenge by completing this quick web form here. After completing the form, we will send you a challenge code that you can share with your affinity group."
