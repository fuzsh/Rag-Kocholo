        "text": "So many people knowing Newton and Einstein, but not Claude Shannon. With the importance of digital communication and the future of AI it is time for this to change. Looking at the introduction of his 1948 paper ‚ÄúA Mathematical Theory of Communications‚Äù this paragraph may in hindsight seem straightforward (as so often is the case), but this way of thinking is what allowed him to develop the foundations of information theory: \"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen\"\n\nBig news! Avi Wigderson just snagged the Turing Award, aka the \"Nobel Prize of Computer Science\"! Coming from Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, he's been honored for his revolutionary insights into computational theory and randomness in computing. Born in Haifa and a grad from both the Israel Institute of Technology and Princeton, he's been rocking the computational complexity world since '99. From uncovering why some probs are just naturally slow-pokes on machines to pioneering randomness, Wigderson is a true leader in theoretical computer science!\n\nFrom cracking an egg to Lock-Out / Tag-Out in industry. I really enjoyed this talk. At one time, category theory was considered so abstract, that no actual industry applications would come from it. Time has proven just the opposite. We're only at the tip of the iceberg. Isaiah Hilsenrath begins the talk with a great introduction to linear logic, and a favorite topic of mine - resource theories. Once you use something, it's gone. So there's a cool discussion on cracking an egg. Now you have a yolk. What do you with that? Where do send it? How do we talk about this? From this introduction, Brandon Baylor begins (at about 11 minutes), taking our cooking example and describing a way to model complex industrial systems. Managing and servicing these systems safely requires new conceptual tools. How do you isolate hazardous energy and shut down things that could cause an accident? This is the subject of Lock-Out / Tag-Out which gets more complicated by the day as we expect more from complex systems. Fascinating talk from Holon Labs Foundation as we are now looking at high profile accidents in the news from Texas wildfires and electrical equipment to the Baltimore Bridge collapse. Category Theory is stepping up!\n\nOnce again the lectures series at von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics left me with much inspiration. This time about quantum computing in fluid dynamics organised by Frank Eulitz and Wim Munters . Basic concepts, algorithms and applications were introduced. In particular, I appreciated bridging the classical lattice Boltzmann methods with quantum computing. Many thanks to the organizers and all the speakers of which I will mention a few: Matthias M√∂ller , Oleksandr Kyriienko , Ren√© Steijl, Pierre Sagaut, Sauro Succi. I can highly recommend the lecture series üôÇ #fluid_dynamics #quantum_computing #lattice_boltzmann_methods"
