        "text": "Awards & Submit an Award Nomination\n\nIEEE Awards - Signal Processing Focused\n\nIEEE Signal Processing Society Awards\n\nCo-Sponsored Awards\n\nWe welcome your award nominations to honor an individual member, Chapter, or author for their work on publications, conferences, Chapters, educational activities, industrial activities, or service to the Society.\n\nEach award has its own nomination requirements and procedures. Please review the IEEE Signal Processing Society Awards section below for the specific details.\n\nProgram Details\n\nWho can nominate?\n\nNominations are accepted from any IEEE Signal Processing Society individual member, group of members, society committee, or society board. Nominators are encouraged to take into consideration the need for representation of diversity in the award nomination slate, when submitting their nominations. The SPS Diversity Statements and Pledge can be found here.\n\nWhat are the eligibility requirement for the awards?\n\nPlease review the IEEE Signal Processing Society Awards section below for the specific eligibility requirements as it varies for each award.\n\nWhere can I submit a nomination?\n\nAll Major Award nominations and their endorsements must be submitted online through this link by 1 September. However, all Paper Award nominations and their endorsements must be submitted through a Technical Committee for review by 15 July, except for cases where there is a noted conflict of interest within the Technical Committee.\n\nIn cases where there is a conflict of interest noted by the Technical Committee or indicated by the nominator(s), the Technical Committee shall directly forward the paper award nominations to the Awards Board, without any TC endorsement, for review through the online nomination system. For the rest of the papers, the technical committees will submit directly to the Awards Board papers that are award worthy with an explanation of why the paper is award quality.\n\nIf a Technical Committee member has a conflict of interest, the Technical Committee member shall abstain from providing any feedback or voting on the award nomination.\n\nWho can submit an endorsement?\n\nTo be an endorser, there is no requirement for IEEE Signal Processing Society membership. Endorsement forms can be submitted by any individual for an IEEE Signal Processing Society award nomination. A nominator cannot serve as an endorser for a nomination he/she is submitting. All Endorsement Forms should be submitted through the online awards system. Full details can be found here. Up to two endorsements can be submitted per award. Technical Committees cannot submit endorsements.\n\nCan I submit a prior year’s nomination again?\n\nYes, however, the Awards Board suggests that, for nominations that have already been considered in the past three award nomination cycles, the nominator take a pause for a minimum of one year before re-nomination.\n\nWhat are the conflict of interest rules?\n\nConflict of Interest concerns shall be disclosed and addressed in accordance with IEEE Policies 9.9 A, B. and C and IEEE Policy 4.4.H. - Eligibility and Process Limitations. Awards Board and Board of Governors members involved at any stage of the recipient selection or approval process for an award shall be ineligible to receive, or act as a nominator or reference for that award. Any real and perceived conflict of interest shall be avoided. Conflict of interest shall be defined as any relationships, professional or otherwise, that can affect impartiality and objectivity. Such relationship includes, but are not limited to:\n\nsupervisor/student\n\nsupervisor/post-doc\n\nmanager/employee\n\nshared institutional affiliations\n\nrecent (less than five years) research collaborations or joint authorship\n\nany Awards Board/Board of Governors member that reviews award nominations must disqualify himself or herself from participating in any part of the awards nomination process in which his or her impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including, but not limited to, instances where he or she has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a candidate.\n\nIn the case of a conflict of interest, the Awards Board or Board of Governors member should neither listen to nor speak in the discussion and should not vote on the nominee.\n\nHow do I manage collaborators on the online nomination form?\n\nThere is a Manage Collaborators button in the top right corner of the nomination page. The Primary Collaborator, who is the person who started the nomination, can add additional collaborators on the nomination by clicking the Add Collaborator button. Once a Collaborator is added, the application can be transferred to a new Primary Collaborator by clicking Make Primary next to the name. Access can also be removed from a collaborator by clicking Remove Access next to the name. Only the Primary Collaborator can submit or finalize the application, as well as add other Collaborators. All Collaborators can view and edit the application. However, only one user can edit the nomination at a time, this is to avoid accidental overwriting of another's information.\n\nWho do I contact if I have questions?\n\nSubmission questions can be directed to Debbie Blazek.\n\nRecent Awards Program Updates\n\nCreation of the Industry Young Professional Leadership Award, which recognizes meritorious service and leadership of IEEE Signal Processing Society Industry members who are young professionals and whose volunteer efforts have significantly benefited the signal processing community and the profession.\n\nThe criteria for the Norbert Wiener Society Award, the Leo L. Beranek Meritorious Service Award, and the Meritorious Regional/Chapter Service Award now requires that the nominee must be an IEEE Signal Processing Member for at least 10 consecutive years at the time of nomination.\n\nThe criteria for the Claude Shannon-Harry Nyquist Technical Achievement Award and the Carl Friedrich Gauss Education Award now requires that the nominee must be an IEEE Signal Processing Member for at least five consecutive years at the time of nomination.\n\nThe criteria for the Claude Shannon-Harry Nyquist Technical Achievement Award, Leo L. Beranek Meritorious Service Award, and the Carl Friedrich Gauss Education Award now states that previous recipients along with previous recipients of the SPS Norbert Wiener Society Award are ineligible.\n\nThe Best Paper Award and the Young Author Best Paper Award has been updated to select up to eight awards instead of six with a maximum of two awards per journal.\n\nThe Donald G. Fink Overview Paper Award now reflects that nominated papers should be an overview paper with technical depth, not a tutorial or literature review.\n\nThe Leo L. Beranek Meritorious Service Award and the Meritorious Regional/Chapter Service Award recipients will each be awarded $1500.\n\nAward Nomination Procedures\n\nTo learn about the Society’s general award nomination procedures, please visit:\n\nPolicy 2.19. Awards Nomination Process\n\nPolicy 5.7. Technical Committee and Special Interest Group Award Nomination Procedures.\n\nAwards Endorsement Form: All Endorsement Forms should be submitted through the online awards system.\n\nEach year, the Signal Processing Society and IEEE honor a select number of members with awards for their research and work in signal processing and for their involvement in both IEEE and the Signal Processing Society.\n\nBrowse through the Awards below for more information on individual IEEE and Signal Processing Society awards.
