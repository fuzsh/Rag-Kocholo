        "text": "Home * People * Elwyn Berlekamp\n\nElwyn Ralph Berlekamp, (September 6, 1940 - April 9, 2019)\n\nwas an American electrical engineer, computer scientist and professor emeritus of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. He finished his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at MIT in 1964, where his thesis advisors were Robert G. Gallager, Peter Elias, Claude Shannon and John Wozencraft [2]. While undergraduate at MIT, Berlekamp was member of the chess group and worked on Chess Playing routines for the IBM 704 Computer, also joined by Alan Kotok and others to build the Kotok-McCarthy-Program for the IBM 7090. Berlekamp dropped out of this project in 1960 and focused on Bridge, Go and combinatorial game theory [3].\n\nWinning Ways\n\nWinning Ways for your Mathematical Plays by Elwyn Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy is a compendium of information on mathematical games, first published 1982 in two volumes, second edition published in four volumes from 2001 until 2004.\n\nQuotes\n\nQuote from Alan Kotok's Oral History concering the development of a chess program under John McCarthy at MIT:\n\nSo there were a total of five people. There was the initial four were, besides me, Charles Niessen, Chuck Niessen, whose these days is some sort of director over at Lincoln Lab. And Mike Lieberman, who is on the faculty at Berkeley. And Elwyn Berlekamp, who is also Berkeley faculty, and fairly famous computer game theory person. Elwyn dropped out of this project at some point, and Bob Wagner, another so these were all sort of East Campus Model Railroad Club friends - and Bob Wagner is at, I think, University of North Carolina - what’s in Raleigh-Durham?\n\nSelected Publications\n\n[4]\n\n1960 ...\n\nElwyn Berlekamp (1968).
