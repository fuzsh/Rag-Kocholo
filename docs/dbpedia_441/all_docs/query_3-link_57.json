        "text": "Advice to a Beginning Graduate Student\n\nor\n\nWhat is Research?\n\nor\n\nThe 4 R's of Graduate School:\n\nReading, Rithmetic, Research, and Writing\n\n29-AUG-01. Updated 28-AUG-02.\n\nManuel Blum\n\nOutline of the talk:\n\nREADING, STUDYING, THINKING,\n\nSTARTING OFF on the PhD,\n\nDEEP in the MIDDLE of the PhD,\n\nWRITING it all up.\n\nYOU\n\nREADING:\n\nBooks are not scrolls.\n\nScrolls must be read like the Torah from one end to the other.\n\nBooks are random access -- a great innovation over scrolls.\n\nMake use of this innovation! Do NOT feel obliged to read a book from beginning to end.\n\nPermit yourself to open a book and start reading from anywhere.\n\nIn the case of mathematics or physics or anything especially hard, try to find something anything that you can understand.\n\nRead what you can.\n\nWrite in the margins. (You know how useful that can be.)\n\nNext time you come back to that book, you'll be able to read more.\n\nYou can gradually learn extraordinarily hard things this way.\n\nConsider writing what you read as you read it.\n\nThis is especially true if you're intent on reading something hard.\n\nI remember a professor of Mathematics at MIT,\n\nname of BERTRAM KOSTANT,\n\nwho would keep his door open whenever he was in his office, and he would always be at his desk writing.\n\nWriting. Always writing.\n\nWas he writing up his research? Maybe.\n\nWriting up his ideas? Maybe.\n\nI personally think he was reading, and writing what he was reading.\n\nAt least for me, writing what I read is one of the most enjoyable and profitable ways to learn hard material.\n\nSTUDYING:\n\nYou are all computer scientists.\n\nYou know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do.\n\nYou know what TURING MACHINES can do.\n\nFor example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.\n\nTuring Machines can compute any computable function.\n\nTuring machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.\n\nYet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that\n\nthe TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.\n\nThink about it.\n\nIt tells you something about the power of writing.\n\nWithout writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.\n\nWith writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.\n\nTHINKING:\n\nCLAUDE SHANNON once told me that as a kid, he remembered being stuck on a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nHis brother, who was passing by, said to him:\n\n\"You know: I could tell you something.\"\n\nThat's all his brother said.\n\nYet that was enough hint to help Claude solve the puzzle.\n\nThe great thing about this hint... is that you can always give it to yourself !!!\n\nI advise you, when you're stuck on a hard problem,\n\nto imagine a little birdie or an older version of yourself whispering\n\n\"... I could tell you something...\"\n\nI once asked UMESH VAZIRANI how he was able,\n\nas an undergraduate at MIT,\n\nto take 6 courses each and every semester.\n\nHe said that he knew he didn't have the time to work out his answers the hard way.\n\nHe had to find a shortcut.\n\nYou see, Umesh understood that problems often have short clever solutions.\n\nThere will come a time when you work on a problem long and hard but UNsuccessfully :(\n\nAnd then you learn that someone else found a solution.\n\nSee this as the GREAT opportunity it is to learn something important.\n\nDon't let it pass you by.\n\nAsk yourself: \"How SHOULD I have been thinking to solve that problem?\"\n\nI have found that doing so is a powerful exercise.\n\nDanny Sleator tells me that BOB FLOYD independently recommended exactly this exercise to his students.\n\nHe would lead them into asking themselves:\n\n\"How COULD I have led myself to that answer?\"\n\nTake the time to think it through.\n\nIt's worth it.\n\nThere will come a time when you work on a problem long and hard and SUCCESSFULLY :)\n\nAnd then you learn that someone else already published. :(\n\nHard as that may be for you to take, you must view this too as a great opportunity.\n\nDon't turn off. Read what got published.\n\nYou will be surprised how often the published paper turns out to be different in some significant way. Roughly\n\n50% of the time, it is NOT at all the same as what you did.\n\n25% of the time, it is the same but not as good.\n\n25% of the time it is better.\n\nThis means that 50% of the time or more, you can still publish.\n\nAnd what about the 25% time that what got published is better than your own?\n\nIn that case, you have a great opportunity to learn.\n\nAsk yourself: \"How SHOULD I have been thinking to solve the problem in this fine way?\"\n\nThis is how I discovered, as a young engineer, that I should learn something enormously powerful called \"Modern Algebra.\"\n\nIt's one reason I switched from Electrical Engineering as an undergraduate major to Mathematics as a Graduate major.\n\nOf course, this was before there existed anything called Computer Science.\n\nStill on THINKING...\n\nThe importance of PARADOX and CONTRADICTION.\n\nWhen you can prove that a statement S is true,\n\nand you can prove that the same statement S is false,\n\nthen you KNOW that that you're on to something:\n\nSomething is wrong somewhere.\n\nNever underestimate the power of a contradiction.\n\nIt is one of our most potent sources of knowledge.\n\nExamples include the Liar Paradox \"This statement is false.\" with its applications to Set Theory and our understanding of language.\n\nThere are the seeming paradoxes of countability and uncountability,\n\nIn CS, there is the apparent paradox that leads to The Halting Problem.\n\nPhysics has lots of paradoxical material:\n\nQuantum Theory. The Einstein-Rosen-Podulsky Paradox.\n\nThe relativistically speeding Twins.\n\nThe wave and particle nature of matter.\n\nHere's an ASIDE on my current work, also based on paradox:\n\nI am personally interested in the Paradox of consciousness. Compare the following two views:\n\n1. the view that the human is a MECHANISM, an automaton\n\nwith substantial but finite internal memory, programmed like\n\nany computer to do whatever it does, and/or\n\n2. the view that the human is a thoughtful observant\n\ncreature with a God-like free will; that it is a CONSCIOUS\n\nENTITY at the controls of a highly complex highly capable\n\nmechanism, choosing what to do from among options served up\n\nby/from its vast unconscious below.\n\nIn my view, both these views are correct. How can that be?\n\nIn his \"Life of Johnson,\" James Boswell quotes Samuel Johnson\n\nas saying:\n\n\"All theory is against the freedom of the will; all experience\n\nis for it.\"\n\nJohnson was 18 years old when Newton (age 85) was buried.\n\nJohnson knew that F=MA implied that humans are mechanisms.\n\n\"All theory is against the freedom of the will; all experience\n\nis for it.\"\n\nThis ends my ASIDE.\n\nMake a list for yourself of good ways to pursue a problem.\n\nMy own favorite is to try small examples. By comparison,\n\nDAVID GRIES's favorite is to put himself in the middle\n\nof a (presumed) solution. An example is his coffee can problem:\n\nGiven a can of black and white coffee beans, do the following: Pull out two beans: if both are the same color, replace them with a white bean. If the two are different, replace them with a black bean. What color is the last bean?\n\nOr try out the two methods on the Hershey Bar problem\n\n[Give an optimal algorithm to break an mxn Hershey bar into\n\n1x1 pieces. At each step, you can choose a single rectangle\n\nof chocolate and crack it along one of its vertical or\n\nhorizontal lines. A single crack counts one step. You are to\n\nmake the fewest number of cracks]\n\nBrains are muscles.\n\nThey grow strong with exercise.\n\nAnd even if they're strong, they grow weak without it.\n\nIn the months before Kasparov lost to Deep Blue,\n\nhis mother came after him.\n\nShe was worried that he wasn't spending enough time\n\nexercising himself (on chess).\n\nHer worries proved well-founded.\n\nTHE PhD: GETTING STARTED\n\nI remember a great summer job I once had at IVIC\n\n(Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificos).\n\nA top neurophysiologist, name of Svaetichin, gave me a splendid problem... one that I unfortunately could not solve.\n\nThe problem was to find a way to focus light on a single cell\n\nof a goldfish retina so that the light would not spill over\n\nonto any of the adjacent cells.\n\nSvaetichin had tried making a pinhole in a sheet of black tin,\n\nand shining his light thru the hole. This worked for moderate size holes, but failed for really small holes, which caused the light to diverge, to form diffraction patterns.\n\nSince Svaetichin couldn't solve the problem, I decided I couldn't. Or perhaps it's that I thought his problem physically unsolvable. In retrospect, I should have taken out books on physics, especially optics, read as much as I could, talked to others and kept on talking to him.\n\nSvaetichin would have helped me if I had shown him I was reading thinking working.\n\nDon't expect your thesis advisor to give you a problem that he or she can answer. Of course, she might.\n\n* She might give you a problem to which she already knows an answer.\n\n* She might give you a problem that she thinks is answerable,\n\nbut that she hasn't actually answered.\n\n* She might give you a problem that is deadly hard.\n\n* If the problem she gives you is hard enough,\n\nI suggest you look for a NONSTANDARD answer.\n\nMore on this later after I get done cooking the thesis advisor.\n\nYour thesis advisor may encourage you to work in an area\n\nthat she feels completely comfortable in... in which case you can rely on her for sage advice and sound guidance.\n\nOr she may encourage you to work on something she knows little or nothing about, in which case it will be up to you to inform and teach her.\n\nIn the latter case, you will have to learn all you can for yourself...\n\nYou will have to learn from other faculty, from courses, from books, from journals. from peers.\n\nBoth kinds of advisors can work out for you.\n\nI don't know that one is necessarily better than the other.\n\nBut you should know which you got.\n\nWhatever you do, you got to like doing it....\n\nYou got to like it so much that you're willing to think about it, work on it, long after everyone else has moved on.\n\nTHE PhD: DEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.\n\nThere's a wonderful quote from ANATOLE FRANCE:\n\n\"A University Student\"\n\n-- and this is especially true for a PhD Student --\n\n\"should know something about everything\n\nand everything about something.\"\n\nYou know the jokes about PhD's...\n\nA PhD knows more and more about less and less\n\nuntil he knows everything about nothing.\n\nWhen working on a PhD, you must focus on a topic so narrow that you can understand it completely.\n\nIt will seem at first that you're working on the proverbial needle, a tiny fragment of the world, a minute crystal,\n\nbeautiful but in the scheme of things, microscopic.\n\nWork with it. And the more you work with it, the more you penetrate it, the more you will come to see that your work, your subject, encompasses the world.\n\nIn time, you will come to see the world in your grain of sand.\n\nTo see a world in a grain of sand\n\nOr a heaven in a wild flower,\n\nHold infinity in the palm of your hand\n\nAnd eternity in an hour.\n\nWILLIAM BLAKE (1757-1827)\n\nThis gorgeous quartet is followed by a large number of sometimes deep sometimes questionable aphorisms, which I see much like the occasionally grinding work of a PhD thesis.\n\nThere's all kinds of research you can do.\n\nThere's research to prove what you know to be true.\n\nThere's research -- maybe better called SEARCH -- to figure out what is true.\n\nSome of the best such search succeeds in DISPROVING\n\nwhat you initially believed to most certainly be true.\n\nFor example, Sir Fred Hoyle is said to have coined the phrase \"Big Bang\" at a time when he was looking to disprove it.\n\nFor a relatively minor but personal example:\n\nWhen I was working on the MEDIAN problem,\n\nmy goal was to prove that any deterministic algorithm to find the MEDIAN of n integers must necessarily make roughly as many comparisons as it takes to sort n integers, i.e. n log n comparisons.\n\nI was shocked to discover that the median of n integers can be found with just O(n) comparisons.\n\nWhen working on proving some statement S true,\n\nyou should spend at least some time trying to prove it false.\n\nEven if it's true, trying to prove it false can give insight.\n\nAnd in any case, too often, our intuition is dead wrong.\n\nThere is yet another sense in which, when working on a hard problem, you may find that the answer is NOT what you expected.\n\nYou may be looking for a YES or a NO; it may be something else.\n\nSome years ago, JOHN HOPCROFT gave one of his PhD students the problem of deciding the Equivalence of Free Boolean Forms.\n\nThe specifics don't matter.\n\nThe problem appeared as an open problem in Garey and Johnson.\n\nThe question was: Is the Equivalence problem NP-complete?\n\nOr is it solvable in poly time?\n\nChandra, Wegman and I found a randomizing algorithm for this problelm. At the time this seemed to beg the question entirely. Only after writing it up did we really understand that we had given an efficient albeit randomizing algorithm to solve it, This shows, by the way, that the problem is not NP-complete if NP <> RP (Randomizing Poly-time), as seems likely.\n\nOf course, this brings up the question whether P = NP.\n\nThe question of our time: Are NP-complete problems solvable in poly time?\n\nCould anything I have said today be useful for so hard a problem as that?\n\nProbably not. Nevertheless...\n\nLEONID LEVIN believes as I do that whatever the answer to the P=NP? problem, it won't be like anything you think it should be. And he has given some wonderful examples.\n\nFor one, he has given a FACTORING ALGORITHM that is proVably optimal, up to a multiplicative constant.\n\nHe proves that if his algorithm is exponential,\n\nthen every algorithm for FACTORING is exponential.\n\nEquivalently, if any algorithm for factoring is poly-time,\n\nthen his algorithm is poly-time.\n\nBut we haven't been able to tell the running time of his algorithm because, in a strong sense, it's running time is unanalyzable.\n\nMaybe as STEVEN RUDICH suggests, the P=NP? problem is undecidable in the standard formalization of Mathematics.\n\nThe point is that the answer may not lie where you expect it. Here's a poem I wrote when I wondered at the fact that we must sometimes be dragged kicking and screaming in the right direction.\n\nIt's a comparison to the blind spot in our eyes,\n\nwhich isn't really blind but makes things up for us.\n\nIt questions whether there might not be other things in this world that our brains, our minds, by their very nature, make up for us:\n\nBlind Spots mb 15-MAY-96\n\nAll men have Blind Spots in their eyes,\n\nThat manufacture visions of their vale.\n\nAnd shape that void where light's unregistered,\n\nWith bold-faced unrepentant tales.\n\nWhat other blind spots shape our minds and thoughts?\n\nWhat other tales do won'dring minds unfurl\n\nTo woo us unbeguiled we would believe\n\nTo strange and nonexistent worlds?\n\nABOUT WRITING:\n\nHere is the one quote that I have found most helpful and wise:\n\n\"First have something to say,\n\nSecond say it,\n\nThird stop when you have said it,\n\nand\n\nFinally give it an accurate title.\"\n\nJOHN SHAW BILLINGS [1838-1913]\n\nMY ADVICE TO YOU:\n\nDon't expect your thesis advisor to read your thesis. Some thesis advisors can and do give good feedback, but not all.\n\nStill, make sure that SOMEBODY reads your thesis...\n\nI especially recommend that you ask your peers.\n\nHere's another piece of advice that I have often had to give myself, and I here give you...\n\nWhen you send a paper off to be published,\n\nand it gets rejected...\n\nDon't be turned off by the mindless cretinous feedback\n\nthat you get to your well-thought-out beautifully-written work!\n\nBe a MENSCH. Use the feedback to improve your paper!\n\nMake it better. And send it back.\n\nFinally, it is my most earnest wish that you should know something that is honestly amazingly true of you... That you are each of you UNIQUE and SPECIAL in some glorious way.\n\nI wrote a poem to capture this, which I now use to end my sermon. It's called \"Fundamentals.\"\n\nFUNDAMENTALS\n\nmb 05-JUN-96\n\nBird must soar. Skunk must stink.\n\nCat must prowl. Man must think.\n\nWhat sets man apart from beast is his engine of\n\nthought. His mind. His\n\nBRAIN\n\nmakes him unique\n\nand gives him his greatest pleasure.\n\nBut fundamental as is thought for human beings,\n\nthere is stuff more basic still that underlies and\n\nDRIVES\n\nnot only man\n\nbut all great beasts,\n\nAnd that is nature's call to each of us... to be special.\n\nTo be distinguished in some way. To be\n\nUNIQUE.\n\nTo BE something, to DO something, BETTER than everyone else.\n\nLike the leather nosed chimpanzee,\n\ndragging noisy cans and branches,\n\nfrightening peers into submission,"
