        "text": "Jimmy Soni, Rob Goodman\n\nDescription\n\nClaude Elwood Shannon is widely regarded as the father of information theory. His research has given birth to an entirely new theory on information and communication, laying the foundations for the information age today. Shannon was a groundbreaking polymath, a brilliant tinkerer, and a digital pioneer. He was deft at simplifying a problem and abstracting its essence. He was also a master at building links and drawing analogies between different things to find new ways to solve complex problems. Shannonâ€™s achievements were largely attributed to his curious and playful mind. He viewed serious research questions as puzzles, and he enjoyed solving them. This book, \"A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age\", decodes Shannon's life and experiences. It also offers an insight into Shannon's personal traits that enabled his achievements.\n\nAuthor : Jimmy Soni, Rob Goodman\n\nJimmy Soni has been an editor at the New York Observer and the Washington Examiner, and managing editor of the Huffington Post. He is a former speechwriter. His written work and commentary have appeared in Slate, The Atlantic, and CNN, to name but a few. Rob Goodman is a Ph.D. at Columbia University. He has written for Slate, The Atlantic, Politico, etc. His scholarly work has been published in Journals like History of Political Thought and the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal and so on."
