She was not in pain or ill and she died while sleeping. This year, shortly after celebrating her 98th birthday, she said she was getting old. It was a blessing to feel that way when she did. Family and friends benefited from her youthful, creative and adventurous spirit. Born in San Francisco, she lived in Scarsdale, NY after marriage and then Palo Alto, Los Altos Hills, Spain, Redding and Cupertino. She was mother to 6 children, a grandmother to 11 and had 3+ great grandchildren. She was an artist, a wife, a mother and a businesswoman who was a part owner and artist at the 'Expressions' gift store on main street Los Altos. Rising rents forced its closure. Many locals remember the store as unique. Recently, art projects with great grandchildren brought her joy. 'Who will take care of you?', she asked recently. Her husband of 64 years, George T. Hayes II and son Stephen Hayes predeceased her. Surviving children include Kathryn, Cynthia, Kenneth, George and Stewart. If you have a photo or a memory you would like to share we would be grateful....\n\nHoward Berger\n\nJuly 23, 1928 - Aug. 6, 2024\n\nAuburn, California\n\nHoward Peter Berger passed away peacefully in Auburn, CA on August 6, 2024, at the age of 96.

She is survived by her daughter, Martine; her sisters, Christine and Mary; her brother, Emmett; her nephew Brent; nieces Celine, Jaime, Elizabeth and Shannon. Nicole will be dearly missed by her family, friends, co-workers, and parishioners of Christ Church in Portola Valley, where she dedicated herself as church administrator. While she enjoyed her duties at Christ Church, her great passion was aviation. Nicole first flew commuter jets throughout the northeast, where the harsh winters test a pilot’s skill and grit. She was soon offered a position with Swissair, and was quickly promoted to Captain, breaking the glass ceiling by entering a world that, at the time, was mostly dominated by men. During this time she lived in Alsace, France where she easily fit in as this was her Mother’s native country and Nicole spoke fluent French. In her spare time she often pulled gliders for fun and flew her 1947 Piper Cub airplane. She once flew her cub from Long Island, New York to Half Moon Bay, California with family friend Kenny Steger, crossing the entire country in a plan...\n\nLucia E.

Burrowes\n\nNov. 27, 1937 - March 4, 2024\n\nMadrid, New Mexico\n\nTrevor Burrowes -- artist, visionary, and tireless defender of natural and man-made beauty in our environment -- has died. Born in Jamaica, Trevor lived on both American coasts and in Mexico, before making his home in East Palo Alto in the 1980s. His education in fine art, art restoration and architectural history, coupled with a transplant's fresh eye, gave him a singular ability to spot what was unique and precious in his new environment. This community, divided and isolated by a freeway, survived with much of its rural history intact within its landscape, while the surrounding Peninsula was rapidly losing any such traces. The steady growth of Silicon Valley placed it in imminent peril from real estate pressure. But Trevor saw, instead, how East Palo Alto offered a model for sustainable urban/suburban living -- where food could still be grown locally, and the peaceful, desirable qualities of green neighborhoods without sidewalks, so admired in the most prosperous areas of the Peninsula, remained. East Palo Altans were still able to keep sheep and horses, goats and chickens, and to grow vegetables. He was prescient. Today, our local organic growers must travel be...\n\nDonald Charles Creevy, MD\n\nApril 22, 1936 - March 3, 2024\n\nPortola Valley, California\n\nAfter several years of declining health, Dr Don Charles Creevy, 87, died peacefully in his sleep on March 3rd, 2024.
