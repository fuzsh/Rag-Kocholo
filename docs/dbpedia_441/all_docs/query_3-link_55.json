        "text": "Richard M. Eubanks\n\nRichard M. Eubanks (BSEE ‘95) is president and chief executive officer and director of The Brink’s Company (a global leader in total cash management and secure logistics). Prior to his May 2022 appointment as CEO, Eubanks served as executive vice president and chief operating officer since September 2021.\n\nAurelio E. Fernandez\n\nAurelio Fernandez (BSEE ’79) was born in Holguin, Cuba, on Dec. 19, 1954. He immigrated to the United States in 1966. His family settled in Hialeah, FL, where he spent most of his childhood until attending the University of Florida, where he studied electrical engineering. He began his career at Westinghouse Electric (Power Systems) but quickly saw the growing opportunities in computers and semiconductors. He proceeded to Digital Equipment Corp., beginning his career in technical sales. In 1981, Intel recruited him to focus on key accounts in South Florida. At Intel he learned the discipline required for high achievement with a focus on management by objectives, a practice he continued through out his career. In 1984, he was recruited by VLSI Technology, then a startup, as regional manager for the Southeast. At VLSI his responsibilities grew to vice president of Eastern sales & design centers and then on to vice president of strategic accounts. In 1994, seeking the position of vice president of worldwide sales, he moved to Silicon Valley where he spent time at two startups. Then, in 1997, he was recruited by Broadcom as their first vice president of worldwide sales. In 1998, he was part of the executive team who took Broadcom public. He and his team grew sales from $35 million to over $1 billion in three years. At that time, Broadcom was the fastest company to reach a billion in sales in the semiconductor industry. He retired from Broadcom in 2002, and has since been an investor in real estate and venture capital.\n\nMichael Hsing\n\nMichael Hsing (BSEE ’88) is the founder and CEO of Monolithic Power Systems, an S&P 500 company. Hsing was born in Shanghai, China, and grew up during the Cultural Revolution. During that time, schools were essentially shut down; but Hsing possessed vast curiosities about how things work, particularly in math and physics. When he was 21, he came to the U.S. as a foreign exchange student. He gained English proficiency quickly and worked many odd jobs to support himself through college. However, due to an undiagnosed learning disability, Hsing struggled. It was during his later years at UF, with the help of his professors, he was able to identify and conquer his learning disability. This redefined the trajectory of his life, and in 1988, he graduated with his BSEE and was accepted into the graduate program at UF. Hsing started MPS in late 1997 with a vision, reflected in the name of the company, Monolithic Power Systems – to integrate power electronics solutions onto a single chip. To execute his vision, Hsing created groundbreaking technologies using a fully integrated power process in a CMOS foundry. In 1998, a single-chip solution was created for powering CCFL backlighting in notebooks. By 2016, under Hsing’s leadership, MPS integrated power transistors, high-precision analog circuitries in embedded microcontrollers, and memory components onto a single silicon chip. Finally fulfilling Hsing’s vision, MPS introduced an industry first – a cost-effective, user-configurable, micro power module – an entire power system in a single package.\n\nPramod P. Khargonekar\n\nPramod P. Khargonekar, Ph.D. (MS (mathematics) LS ‘80; Ph.D. EG ‘81), was born in Indore, India, on August 24, 1956. Both his parents were schoolteachers, and they instilled a love of learning from his childhood. He received B. Tech. degree in electrical engineering in 1977 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India. He continued his education at the University of Florida, receiving his M.S. degree in mathematics in 1980 and Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1981. Dr. Khargonekar has been on faculty at UF, the University of Minnesota, the University of Michigan, and the University of California, Irvine. From 1997 to 2001, he became chairman of the University of Michigan’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and held the position of Claude E. Shannon Professor of Engineering Science. In 2001, he was recruited back to UF to become the dean of the College of Engineering until 2009. He was also Eckis Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering from 2001 to 2016. He served briefly as deputy director of technology at ARPA-E, U. S. Department of Energy in 2012–13. He was appointed by the National Science Foundation to serve as assistant director for the Directorate of Engineering in March 2013. In June 2016, he assumed his current position as vice chancellor for research and distinguished professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Khargonekar is known for his brilliant, high-impact research contributions to theory and applications of systems and control. His early work was on mathematical control theory, specifically focusing on robust control analysis and design. In late 1980s, he made groundbreaking contributions to the state-space solution to the H-infinity control problem. This work is recognized to be the greatest theoretical achievement in the control systems field since the pioneering work of R. E. Kalman, Ph.D., in the 1960s.\n\nChris Malachowsky\n\nChris Malachowsky (BSEE ’80) graduated with his BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida in 1980 and received his MSCS from Santa Clara University in 1986. He has been awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award from both universities. In 1993, Malachowsky helped established NVIDIA, a California-based multinational technology company that continues to make significant contributions to the data science and information technology industries. At NVIDIA, he serves as a member of the executive staff, an NVIDIA Fellow, and as a senior technology executive. A recognized authority on integrated-circuit design and methodology, he has authored close to 40 patents. Beyond his technical accomplishments, Malachowsky has also received an Emmy for a film he helped produce, Inheritance, that won Best Documentary in 2009. Malachowsky was inducted into the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame in 2019, and the University of Florida Academy of Golden Gators in 2022. In 2021, Malachowsky, along with NVIDIA, gifted to the university UF’s world-class AI focused supercomputer HiPerGator AI. He also is the namesake for the Malachowsky Hall for Data Science and Information Technology, a state-of-the- art academic building and hub that connects students, faculty, and researchers from across disciplines in pursuit of advances that capitalize on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. UF has also granted him an honorary Doctorate in Technology.\n\nLinda Rae\n\nLinda Rae (BSEE ‘87) is the General Manager for the Power Generation / Oil and Gas software businesses for GE Vernova (the energy-focused spinoff of General Electric).

His exceptional contributions were recognized with an honorary Doctor of Science degree from UF in 1974. Atanasoff’s most renowned invention, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC), developed with graduate student Clifford Berry, laid the groundwork for modern digital computers. Capable of solving multiple equations simultaneously, the ABC was a revolutionary achievement in computing history. Despite facing a patent dispute with John Mauchly over the invention of the electronic digital computer, Atanasoff’s legacy endures as a pioneer in technological innovation. His dedication extended beyond computing, as evidenced by his work with the Armed and Naval forces and the founding of the Ordnance Engineering Corporation. Atanasoff’s inventive journey continued until his passing in June 1995, leaving an indelible mark on the digital age that followed."
