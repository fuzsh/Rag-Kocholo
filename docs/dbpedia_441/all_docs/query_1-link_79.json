        "text": "Broad-shouldered and beefy Claude Akins had wavy black hair, a deep booming voice and was equally adept at playing sneering cowardly villains as he was at portraying hard-nosed cops. The son of a police officer, Akins never seemed short of work and appeared in nearly 100 films and 180+ TV episodes in a career spanning over 40 years. He originally attended Northwestern University, and went on to serve with the US Army Signal Corps in World War II in Burma and the Phillipines. Upon returning, he reignited his interest in art and drama and first appeared in front of the camera in 1953 in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). He quickly began notching up roles in such TV shows as Dragnet (1951), Flicka (1955), Rauchende Colts (1955) and Abenteuer im wilden Westen (1956). He also turned in several strong cinematic performances, such as gunfighter Joe Burdette in the landmark western Rio Bravo (1959), Mack in the excellent Flucht in Ketten (1958), Sgt. Kolwicz in Durchbruch auf Befehl (1962) and Earl Sylvester in the gripping Der Tod eines Killers (1964). In the early 1970s Akins turned up in several supernatural TV films playing \"no-nonsense\" sheriffs in both The Night Stalker (1972) and The Norliss Tapes (1973), and was unrecognizable underneath his simian make-up as war-mongering Gen. Aldo in Die Schlacht um den Planet der Affen (1973). Akins continued starring in films and TV right up until the time of his death from cancer in 1994. By all reports a very gregarious, likable and friendly person off screen, Akins was married for over 40 years to Theresa \"Pie\" Fairfield, and had three children, Claude Marion Jr., Michele & Wendy.\n\nActress and singer Ann-Margret is one of the most famous sex symbols and actresses of the 1960s and beyond. She continued her career through the following decades and into the 21st century.\n\nAnn-Margret was born Ann-Margret Olsson in Valsjöbyn, Jämtland County, Sweden, to Anna Regina (Aronsson) and Carl Gustav Olsson, who worked for an electrical company. She came to America at age 6. She studied at Northwestern University and left for Las Vegas to pursue a career as a singer. Ann-Margret was discovered by George Burns and soon afterward got both a record deal at RCA and a film contract at 20th Century Fox. In 1961, her single \"I Just Don't Understand\" charted in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 Charts. Her acting debut followed the same year as Bette Davis' daughter in Frank Capra's Die unteren Zehntausend (1961). She appeared in the musical Texas-Show (1962) a year later before her breakthrough in 1963. With Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Tolle Nächte in Las Vegas (1964) opposite Elvis Presley, she became a Top 10 Box Office star, teen idol and even Golden Globe nominated actress. She was marketed as Hollywood's hottest young star and in the years to come got awarded the infamous nickname \"sex kitten.\" Her following pictures were sometimes ripped apart by critics (Widersteh, wenn du kannst (1965) and The Swinger (1966)), sometimes praised (Cincinnati Kid (1965)). She couldn't escape being typecast because of her great looks. By the late 1960s, her career stalled, and she turned to Italy for new projects. She returned and, by 1970, she was back in the public image with Hollywood films (Kampf den Talaren (1970) opposite Anthony Quinn), Las Vegas sing-and-dance shows and her own television specials. She finally overcame her image with her Oscar-nominated turn in Mike Nichols' Die Kunst zu lieben (1971) and succeeded in changing her image from sex kitten to respected actress. A near-fatal accident at a Lake Tahoe show in 1972 only momentarily stopped her career. She was again Oscar-nominated in 1975 for Tommy (1975), the rock opera film of the British rock band The Who. Her career continued with successful films throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s. She starred next to Anthony Hopkins in Magic - Die Puppe des Grauens (1978) and appeared in pictures co-starring Walter Matthau, Gene Hackman, Glenda Jackson and Roy Scheider. She even appeared in a television remake of Tennessee Williams's masterpiece play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1983. Another late career highlight for her was Ein verrücktes Paar (1993) as the object of desire for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. She continues to act in movies today.\n\nJane Badler, the American and Australian actress best known for her role as the evil reptilian Visitor leader \"Diana\" in the NBC mini-series V: Die außerirdischen Besucher kommen (1983), its sequel V: Die außerirdischen Besucher kommen (1984), the subsequent TV series V: Die außerirdischen Besucher kommen zurück (1984), and the last season of the latest series V: Die Besucher (2009), was born on the last day of 1953 in Brooklyn, New York. She spent her teen years in Manchester, New Hampshire, where she attended Central High School. Jane won the Miss New Hampshire title and competed at the 1972 Miss America Pageant before going on to study drama at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nIn 1977, Jane gained her first major role on the TV soap opera Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968), where she played \"Melinda Cramer Janssen\" until 1981, returning briefly to reprise the role in 1983. She also starred on the venerable soap opera The Doctors (1963). Jane's other TV roles included a stint on Falcon Crest (1981) as \"Meredith Braxton\" from 1986 to 1987 and as \"Agent Shannon Reed\" for the revival of the series In geheimer Mission (1988), which was shot in Australia. She also guest-starred on many TV series.\n\nJane relocated to Australia after filming In geheimer Mission (1988) Down Under, marrying businessman Stephen Haines. They have two sons, Sam and Harry. Her Australian TV roles include Cluedo (1992) (the British and Australian name of the board game known as \"Clue\" in the United States). She also had a guest-starring role in Snowy River (1994). In the 1990s, she launched a stage career and cabaret act, including the one-woman show \"The Love Goddess: Rita Hayworth\".\n\nSince starring in his first film, Fieber im Blut (1961), Warren Beatty has been said to have demonstrated a greater longevity in movies than any actor of his generation. Few people have taken so many responsibilities for all phases of the production of films as producer, director, writer, and actor, and few have evidenced so high a level of integrity in a body of work.\n\nIn Regeln spielen keine Rolle (2016), he writes, produces, directs and stars in. Only Beatty and Orson Welles (Citizen Kane) have been nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as an actor, a director, a writer, and a producer for the same film. Beatty is the only person ever to have done it twice, for Der Himmel soll warten (1978) and again for Ein Mann kämpft für Gerechtigkeit (1981). Beatty has been nominated 15 times by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, and 8 films he has produced have earned 53 Academy nominations. In 1982 he won the Academy Award for Directing and in 2000 was given the Academy's highest honor, the Irving G. Thalberg Award.\n\nHe was awarded Best Director from the Directors Guild of America and Best Writer three times from the Writers Guild of America. He has received the Milestone Award from the Producers Guild, the Board of Governors Award from the American Society of Cinematographers, the Directors Award from the Costume Designers Guild, the Life Achievement Award from the Publicists Guild, and the Outstanding Contribution to Cinematic Imagery Award from the Art Directors Guild. The National Association of Theater Owners has honored him as Director of the Year, as Producer of the Year and as Actor of the Year.\n\nHe has won 16 awards from the New York and Los Angeles Film Critics, the National Board of Review, and the Golden Globes.

In addition, he is the recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, the HFPA Cecile B. DeMille Award and many others. Politically active since the 1960's, Beatty campaigned with Robert F. Kennedy in his 1968 presidential campaign. That same year he traveled throughout the United States speaking in favor of gun control and against the war in Vietnam. In 1972 he took a year off from motion pictures to campaign with George McGovern.\n\nIn 1981, Beatty was a founding board member of the Center for National Policy. He is a founding member of The Progressive Majority, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has participated in the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland.\n\nBeatty serves on the Board of Directors of the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation. He previously served on the Board of Trustees of The Scripps Research Institute for several years. He has received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award from the Americans for Democratic Action, the Brennan Legacy Award from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, and the Philip Burton Public Service Award from The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.\n\nIn multiple forums he has addressed campaign finance reform, the increasing disparity of wealth, universal health care and the need for the Democratic Party to return to its roots.\n\nIn March of 2013, he was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.\n\nBeatty was born in Richmond, Virginia. He and his wife, Annette Bening, live in Los Angeles and have four children.\n\nHis mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and his father, Ira Owens Beaty, a professor of psychology and real estate agent, was from Virginia.

Her roles mainly consisted of waitresses, hookers and women on the edge. Some of her later films were disappointments at the box office, but she did receive another Golden Globe for Der große Gatsby (1974). One role for which she is well remembered is that of the jewel thief in Alfred Hitchcock's last film, Familiengrab (1976). Another is as the woman terrorized in her apartment by a murderous Zuni doll come to life in the well received TV movie Trilogy of Terror (1975).
