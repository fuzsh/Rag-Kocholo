        "text": "Electrical engineering and computer science Distinguished Professor Pramod K. Varshney has been chosen to receive the prestigious 2021 Claude Shannon – Harry Nyquist Technical Achievement Award from the IEEE Signal Processing Society for outstanding contributions in the fields of distributed inference, and data fusion.\n\nThe Claude Shannon – Harry Nyquist Technical Achievement Award was established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to honor those who have made outstanding technical contributions to theory and/or practice in technical areas within the scope of the society, as demonstrated by publications, patents, or recognized impact on the field. There are over 400,000 IEEE members in over 160 countries and this award is annually given to one or two individuals.\n\n“I am truly honored to receive this prestigious award. It is a testament to the outstanding research performed by my students, post docs and collaborators in Syracuse and around the globe,” said Varshney.\n\n“I am extremely happy about Professor Varshney receiving this well-deserved prestigious award,” said Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department Chair Jae C. Oh. “He continues to excel in the field of data fusion and distributed inference. He is a world-renowned researcher whom our EECS department is so proud of. It is no surprise that he receives this prestigious award bearing the names of the giants such as Claude Shannon and Harry Nyquist, the names recognized by every electrical engineer in the world.”\n\n“The Shannon-Nyquist Award is one of the most notable awards in the signal processing field and a world-renowned leader like Pramod is very deserving of it,” said Engineering and Computer Science Dean J. Cole Smith."
