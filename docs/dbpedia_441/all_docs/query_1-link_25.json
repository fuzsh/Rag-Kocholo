        "text": "Hitch is at his best in what is one of the most entertaining,exciting and thrilling films ever made...direction,dialogue and acting are par excellence,even Eva Marie Saint acquits herself well in a role that was undoubtedly meant for Grace Kelly...there's not a dull minute in this masterpiece and it's my second favorite Hitchcock film next to Rear Window and one of my all time favorites.\n\n10+\n\nOne of the most exhilarating and entertaining films ever made...I'm not sure there is a movie as dialogue rich as this one and the cast is perfection in particular Bette Davis who gives her best performance and George Sanders who was born to play Addison DeWitt...one of my all time favorites.\n\n10\n\nMusicals are the one genre of film I never get excited about and I'm not sure why because when done right their magical and make me want to watch more and this exhilarating film is one of the best ever made...Kelly,Reynolds and O'Connor are an absolute joy and many of the musical numbers are truly memorable like the title sequence which really is one of the great moments in film...this is my second viewing of this classic and I liked it even more this time around and will probably be on my top 100 the next time I do my list.\n\n10\n\nOne of Ford's greatest films and one of the best westerns ever made this beautiful,elegant,lyrical and poetic film is filled with imagery that stays with you and Henry Fonda gives one of his best performances...it just gets better every time I see it.\n\n10\n\nOne of the great westerns and one of the most powerful films about vigilante justice ever made that is as relevant today as it was back in 1943...direction and performances are fine and help give this morality tale the punch that it has.\n\n10\n\nI've always considered \"The Big Sleep\" the best Philip Marlowe movie but this one ranks right up there with it...in many ways this is far edgier and Dick Powell is almost as good as Bogart even the dialogue is terrific...one of the best film noirs ever made and another film that just gets better and better every time I see it.\n\n10\n\nThis is my second viewing of Chaplin's classic film and I feel the same way about it as I did when I first saw it 25 years ago...this is a great film that is elevated to something special with one of the most beautiful and tender endings I've ever seen and if Chaplin's tramp persona wasn't one of the greatest characters in movie history it certainly was after this film.\n\n10\n\nI can't really explain why I like this film so much other than it makes me smile,truthfully I don't find it that funny but Mr Hulot is a character I relate to and I find him endearing just like Chaplin's tramp character...my second viewing is almost as good as when I first saw it 20 years ago.\n\n10\n\nThis end of the world low budget Sci-Fi film just might be one of the most intelligent films ever made in the genre...terrific story that relies not on special effects but on believable characters and plot and it works brilliantly...I've seen this film 3 times and it just keeps impressing.\n\n9\n\nThis is a film that's been on my must see list after seeing the Miike version which I thought was terrific but I think the original may be a little better...the cinematography and direction are flawless and Tatsuya Nakadai is unforgettable in the lead and this morality tale about honor and sacrifice is even more powerful.\n\n9\n\nThis is my 4th or 5th viewing of this classic and I feel the same way about it every time I see it,the first hour or so on the ship is Sturges at his best, but when it's on land so to speak though entertaining isn't as memorable and stops this film from being one of the great films that it had the potential to be...that being said Henry Fonda is at his best but it's Barbara Stanwyck who really stands out and gives her best performance and one of my personnel favorites.\n\n9\n\nGreta Garbo supposedly lamented when the beast becomes human \" Give me back my Beast\" and it's easy to understand why because the moment he changes the fairy tale ends and it takes you out of it's wonderful spell but until than this is an exquisite fantasy brilliantly directed by Cocteau and Josette Day and Jean Marais are wonderful...another film that's been about 30 years since I first saw it and my opinion hasn't changed but that inevitable ending stops it from getting a higher rating.\n\n9\n\nAn emotional and powerful retelling of the shootings at University of Texas back in 1966 that uses animation in a way I've not quite seen before in a documentary and it's absolutely brilliant...the acts of heroism from some individuals should not be forgotten.\n\n9\n\nThis film made me feel like a kid again when I wanted to be an astronaut and was excited and fascinated by anything involving the space program...Cernan's story about going to the moon is engaging and wondrous and the archival footage is absolutely astounding.\n\n9\n\nI love so much of this film and yet when it's over I feel a little disappointed by it and am not sure why...Grant,Bergman and Rains are brilliant and Hitch is at the top of his game...maybe the big moments in the film are so subtle that they don't have the punch they should have,like the ending,even though i think it's great...I certainly put it among Hitch's 10 best but it should be higher.\n\n9\n\nWhen I first saw this film 30 years ago,it had a potency and power that stayed with me and Michael Rooker's performance has never left me since...It felt so raw and real that I felt uncomfortable after it was all over and after seeing it again it still retains most of it's power but there's no denying that this isn't a film for everyone.\n\n9\n\nThese debates between Vidal and Buckley were a precursor to much of what we get today in political punditry for good or bad but rarely have we had 2 such intellectuals butting heads and getting under each other's skin in such a surprising and entertaining way...this is a terrific documentary.\n\n9\n\nAnother Hitchcock film that's lost some of it's luster but that being said it's still terrific fun and one of his best early films and I'd still put it among his 10 best...all the stars acquit themselves well and Hitch's direction is first rate even if it's not as polished as some of his later works.\n\n9\n\nKinski and Herzog fed off each other for good and bad and made some amazing films together even when they wanted to kill each other along the way and this documentary showcases their love/hate relationship in a very entertaining and at times shocking way...I knew some of the stories about Kinski's erratic and violent tantrums especially during the shooting of Aguirre,the Wrath of God but apparently not all.\n\nI suppose the one thing this film doesn't answer and if anyone would know it would be Herzog is whether his bizarre and crazy behavior at times helped with his performances.\n\n9"
