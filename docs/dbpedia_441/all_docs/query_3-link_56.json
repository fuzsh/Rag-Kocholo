        "text": "This is not a Cold War stereotype with impossible claims to breakthrough inventions. UC Berkeley has not felt the need, for institutional pride, to assert pioneering involvement in, say, the steam engine, the electric light, or the airplane.\n\nHowever: Berkeley’s role in advancing the computer, the transformative invention of our time, may not be widely understood.\n\nFirst, the computer itself. While distantly related to the abacus — a calculator that predates our written numerical system and may be 2,400 years old — the computer, like a student, takes instructions. It’s programmable. An early example of such instruction is Joseph Marie Jacquard’s 1801 textile loom, which used punched paper cards to tell the device how to weave intricate patterns automatically. The 1890 U.S. Census used punched cards to count Americans in the first use of large-scale data processing, with machines made by a company that turned into IBM.\n\nThe conflicting priorities of World War II stepped up the evolution of the computer, mainly in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. (Encoding and decoding on the German side, code-breaking on Allied side, which enlisted English mathematician/logician/cryptographer Alan Turing, who is frequently seen as the father of modern computer science.)\n\nThe opposing sides used punched cards to tell mechanical devices employing vacuum tubes how to manipulate and extract data. These were analog computers. A Michigan-and-MIT alumnus named Claude Shannon, in what has been called the most important master’s thesis of all time, essentially founded information theory and the theory behind the digital computer and digital circuit design. (He was 21 at that point.)\n\nTransistors replaced vacuum tubes, and computers got smaller, faster, cheaper, and more reliable. In the 1970s, the integrated circuit did the same thing but more so, and the stage was set for computing power to move out of air-conditioned “computer rooms” and the sole control of the technical class and arrive in the hands and offices and homes of average citizens.\n\nIn the next steps of this revolution, nobody invented the personal computer, the operating system, or the mouse, much less the Internet, entirely alone.\n\nBut we wouldn’t be where we are today without the major pieces UC Berkeley has placed solidly into those separate but intertwined jigsaw puzzles through the work — and inventive genius — of its faculty, its graduate students, and its undergraduate and graduate alumni.\n\nWhat follows is a selection, not a complete list, of Berkeley-connected puzzle-solvers, with brief explanations of what they did.\n\n(Names of Berkeley alumni are in bold italics in the narrative for ease of identification.)\n\nPOWERPOINT: About 30 million presentations a day, give or take\n\nThe world’s most pervasive software program for presentations, PowerPoint, was co-created (with Dennis Austin) by Robert Gaskins, who did graduate work at Berkeley in the 1970s. The program was released in 1987, initially for the Macinstosh platform, back when “desktop publishing” was a new concept, always in quotes. It allowed people to quickly and easily crank out text-and-graphics slide pages for overhead transparencies, spurring the sales of overhead projectors, and then, with the advent of laptop computers and digital projection, gutting that same market. Microsoft, which bought the program (and, of course, the company) soon after the launch, has estimated that at least 30 million PowerPoint presentations are made every day. Some believe the program has well over 90 percent of the presentations-software market.\n\nGaskins worked for Microsoft for nearly six years, directing its business graphics unit, after which he and his wife moved to London, restored an 1890 Victorian “mansion flat,” and he became seriously interested in the concertina (“the only native English musical instrument,” according to his website). In 2001, they moved back to San Francisco, where he lives and creates “authoritative websites about concertina history.”\n\nAt Berkeley, Gaskins had earned an M.A. in 1973, and most of a Ph.D. in computer science, linguistics, and English, with the help of a fellowship from the Ford Foundation.\n\nThe “Nobel Prize of computing,”\n\ngiven by the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM)\n\nTuring Award winners\n\nat or from Berkeley, 1966–2009\n\n1983 Ken Thompson* B.S. ’65, M.S. ’66\n\n1984 Niklaus Wirth* Ph.D. ’63\n\n1985 Richard M.
