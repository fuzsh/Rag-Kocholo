Shannon notes on page 68: ``As to the practicality of such a device, it might be said that J. P. Kulik spent 20 years in constructing a table of primes up to 100,000,000 and when finished it was found to contain so many errors that it was not worth publishing. The machine described here could probably be made to handle 5 numbers per second so that the table would require only about 2 months to construct.''\", } @Article{Shannon:1938:SAR, author = \"Claude E.
