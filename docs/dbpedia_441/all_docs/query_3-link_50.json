'Claude did so much in enabling modern technology that it's hard to know where to start and end,' says [Robert] Gallager, who worked with Shannon in the 1960s. 'He had this amazing clarity of vision. Einstein had it, too - this ability to take on a complicated problem and find the right way to look at it, so that things become very simple.' \"For Shannon, it was all just another way to have fun. 'Claude loved to laugh, and to dream up things that were offbeat,' says retired Bell Labs mathematician David Slepian, who was a collaborator of Shannon's in the 1950s. Shannon went at math like a stage magician practicing his sleight of hand: 'He would circle around and attack the problem from a direction you never would have thought of,' says Slepian - only to astonish you with an answer that had been right in front of your face all the time. But then, Shannon also had a large repertoire of real card tricks. He taught himself to ride a unicycle and became famous for riding it down the Bell Labs hallways at night-while juggling. ('He had been a gymnast in college, so he was better at it than you might have thought,' says his wife Betty, who gave him the cycle as a Christmas present in 1949.) \"At home, Shannon spent his spare time building all manner of bizarre machines. There was the Throbac (THrifty ROman-numerical BAckward-looking Computer), a calculator that did arithmetic with Roman numerals. There was Theseus, a life-sized mechanical mouse that could find its way through a maze. And perhaps most famously, there was the 'Ultimate Machine' - a box with a large switch on the side. Turn the switch on, and the lid would slowly rise, revealing a mechanical hand that would reach down, turn the switch off, and withdraw - leaving the box just as it was. \"'I was always interested in building things with funny motions,' Shannon explained in a 1987 interview with Omni magazine (one of the few times he spoke about his life publicly). In his northern Michigan hometown of Gaylord, he recalled, he spent his early years putting together model planes, radio circuits, a radio-controlled model boat and even a telegraph system.
