My doctoral advisor at Stanford University, Ed McCluskey, is undoubtedly the authority in digital design. He invented the first algorithmic approach for digital logic optimization, paving the way for multi-billion-transistors chips of today. He was the protégé of Claude Shannon, who started digital computing and made the link between the theory of Alan Turing and the switching circuits, together with John von Neumann in 1940’s, which is still driving the digital world of today and future. For his graduate logic design lecture, Ed used to give us - his doctoral students - the exam questions for dry-run. I vividly remember one time I messed up in one of the exam questions, he walked to my desk - as he used to do to talk to us and I have inherited this habit from him - saying with a disappointed tone: “Geez, Mehdi!”. Of course this shouldn’t be the mistake that a PhD student working in that subject would do and I tried to explain why I got confused and he explained back, convincingly, where I got it wrong. Days later when we got the exam back for grading, I realized that he removed that question from the exam altogether! At that time he was 75 and I was not even 25! He used to bet with us, dime was the limit, when we were arguing and had different opinions, and had to dig deeper into data or other papers for the verdict. Sometimes we would win, and he accepted easily (and paid!). Science requires humility, curiosity, and openness to change mind when data or evidence prove otherwise. Unfortunately, I find today that some people still believe inflexibility, stubbornness, and sticking to initial opinions/results and defending them no matter what, are signs of competence.
