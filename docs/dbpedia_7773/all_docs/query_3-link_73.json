        "text": "Mitch Daniels served two terms as the Governor of Indiana, from 2004 to 2012, receiving more votes than any candidate for any public office in the state’s history. During his tenure, Daniels introduced legislation that added record-setting numbers of jobs and investment, reduced the state’s overall debt by 40 percent, and passed property tax reforms that resulted in the biggest tax cut in Indiana history.\n\nDaniels was unanimously appointed at the 12th president of Purdue University in June 2012. With an emphasis on student affordability and the quality of the student experience, Daniels is spearheading the implementation of Purdue Moves, a 10-item action plan that focuses on investments in research, transformative education, affordability, and leadership in science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nThe author of the best-selling book, “Keeping the Republic: Saving America by Trusting Americans,” Daniels has a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a law degree from Georgetown University."
