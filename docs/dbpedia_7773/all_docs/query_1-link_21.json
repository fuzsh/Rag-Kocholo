        "text": "Former Indiana Governor and Purdue University President Mitch Daniels will spend his next chapter at a Carmel-based private education foundation, the Liberty Fund.\n\nDaniels had previously considered a run for U.S. Sen. Mike Braun's open seat in 2024, but in late January announced he decided against it, saying he would rather look for \"ways to contribute that do not involve holding elective office.\"\n\nThat would be as \"distinguished scholar and senior advisor\" for the foundation, which hosts conferences around the world on topics such as education, political theory and history, with the theme of individual liberty woven throughout. The conferences promote Socratic-style open discussion and questioning as opposed to traditional lectures.\n\nIndiana Statehouse:Mitch Daniels says U.S. Senate role is 'just not the job for me'\n\nIn his role, Daniels will help create educational programming and form partnerships to bolster the programs the Fund already has, according to a news release from the Liberty Fund. He starts April 1.\n\n“I have watched for decades as the Liberty Fund, with impeccable scholarship and fidelity to principle, has labored to keep lit the lamp of freedom, and spread understanding of its historical and intellectual underpinnings,\" Daniels said in a statement. \"Now, with individual liberty under relentless threats foreign and domestic, I'm grateful for the Fund's invitation that I try to assist it in its noble and essential mission.”\n\nMore:Did Mitch Daniels ruin education in Indiana, or save it?\n\nThe Liberty Fund was founded by Indianapolis businessman Pierre F. Goodrich in 1960. In addition to conferences, the foundation publishes books on the subject of individual liberty and free society. It's a private operating foundation, a nonprofit tax-exempt entity.\n\nDaniels retired from Purdue in 2022 after a decade at the helm. Prior to that, the Republican served two terms as governor."
