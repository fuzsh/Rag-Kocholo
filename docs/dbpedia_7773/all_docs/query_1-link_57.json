        "text": "Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. is the 12th president of Purdue University and the former governor ofIndiana.He was elected Indianaâs 49th governor in 2004 in his first bid for any elected office, and then re-elected in 2008 with more votes than any governor in the state's history. During his tenure,Indiana went from an $800 million deficit to its first AAA credit rating, led the nation in infrastructure building and passed sweeping education and healthcare reforms.After a series of transformations, which included the biggest tax cut in state history, the nationâs most sweeping deregulation of the telecommunications industry and a host of other reforms aimed at strengthening the stateâs economy, Indiana was rated a top five state for business climate and number one for state infrastructure and effectiveness of state government as Daniels exited office. Indianaâs business climate is now rated among the nationâs best. At Purdue, Daniels has prioritized student affordability and reinvestment in the universityâs strengths. Breaking with a 36-year trend, Purdue has held tuition unchanged from 2012through at least the 2020-21 academic year. Simultaneously, room rates have remained steady, meal plan rates have fallen about 10%, and student borrowing has dropped 33% while investments in student success and STEM research have undergone unprecedented growth. It is less expensive to attend Purdue today than it was in 2012"
