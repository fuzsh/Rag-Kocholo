As the following correspondence between President David S. Jordan and Professor Guido H. Marx of Stanford University throws much light on the question of Academic Salaries, the Quarterly has asked and received permission to print it. — The Editor. Stanford University, October 3, 1906. Professor Guido H. Marx, Dear Sir: At the next meeting of the Association of American Universities, Stanford University is asked to discuss this phase of the salary problem in universities: \" Should the same salary be paid to men bearing the same title ?\" If not, what should be the nature and pur- pose of variations ? I should appreciate a brief statement of your views on this ques- tion, and as the meeting occurs on November 23, an early reply would also be appreciated. Very truly yours, David S. Jordan. Stanford University, October 18, 1906. President D. S. Jordan, Stanford University, Cal. Dear Sir: I would respectfully submit the following reply to your circular letter of October 3. 1 v> 2 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April It is undesirable and impossible for universities to attempt to com- pete with the salaries which professional men can and do obtain in active practice. On the other hand t^iey should be the last to ignore the market value of trained men. These are two distinct facts which should not be confused. The average collegiate and graduate study of our Instructors be- fore receiving university appointments I have, upon investigation, found to be seven years. Our university is no exception in this, the doctor's degree or its equivalent in other training being generally demanded of a candidate for a position. Considering this long period of arduous preparation, the expenses involved in it, the earnings foregone during the time, and the fact that the men selecting teach- ing are among the hardest workers and those of highest mental abil- ity,— the beginner's salary should not be much lower than that of an artisan whose school work stops in the grammar grades, who, at most, spends three or four years as a paid apprentice, and at the end of that period earns journeyman wages, being then little, if any, older than the college freshman. The teacher's ability and training should rather put him on a level with the trained doctor, lawyer, architect, or engineer — and this, whatever his field of work; for university teaching should be con- ducted on such a plane that it should be considered a profession, irrespective of the subject taught. Moreover the successful teacher has a right to be compared with the successful professional man in other lines. University finances, however, could not stand the drain of such salaries as these same men might earn with equal exercise of effort and ability in other professions than teaching. Furthermore, it would be a calamity to have introduced into our simple and demo- cratic university communities the standard of extravagant and waste- ful living which necessarily accompanies these large salaries. Nor is it necessary to pay such salaries in order to tempt men of the high- est ability and character to enter and remain in the teaching field. It is universally recognized that the rewards of the academic life suf- ficiently counterbalance the attraction of exceptional financial gain. I do not believe that it would be necessary or desirable to make any noticeable general exception in favor of larger salaries for men teaching in professional lines if the regular salaries throughout the university were proper and adequate. 1911] Academic Salaries 3 I believe that the following method of compensation would work out with much success. The minimum instructor's salary to be $1200, advancing auto- matically $200 each year, if his services*are retained at all, until he reaches $1800. When he reaches this point his case, at once and automatically, should come up for consideration by the President for promotion and be carefully weighed — not judged solely upon the biased view (whether good or bad) of the individual who chances to be the executive head of a man's department (a method which in- troduces the most serious evil of as many different standards for pro- motion as there are executive heads), but carefully judged by the President, whose business this is, after investigating all sides of the case including a hearing of the person most concerned. As a result of this investigation he should be told whether he is to be promoted, retained without hope of promotion, or released. If promoted to an Assistant-Professorship, he should at once re- ceive the minimum salary of $2000 — with automatic yearly incre- ments as before of $200 each until he reaches $2800. At this time his case should once more automatically come up for promotion and the results of the President's careful consideration told him. If promoted, he begins as an Associate Professor at a salary of $3000 and receives an increase of $200 each year until he reaches $3800, when his case automatically comes up for cons'deration for promotion to Full Professorship. He will then be approximately forty years of age, with seven years of training and fifteen years of teaching experience behind him and may well be considered sufficiently mature and experienced for such promotion. The minimum Full Professor's salary should be $4000. At this point the salaries cease to increase automatically, further increase being based upon services of a peculiar and exceptional character rendered the university, and not at all upon the subject taught — a necesssary precaution in order to keep men of approximately the same strength in all fields of work. Such a scheme, with the minimum salaries never lower than these here set, since they are as low as present cost of living and a normally developing life permit, would be sufficiently attractive to draw and hold first-class men in all lines of work — professional as well as others. The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April The automatic increase and the compulsory consideration of each man's case by the President at stated intervals are the points in which conditions are lamentably defective. With these modifications I should answer the question \" should the same salary be paid to men bearing the same title\" in the affirm- ative. I am, Very truly yours, Guido H. Marx.

IMPRESSIONS OF BRYN MAWR As I had the thrilling experience of making a first acquaintance with America and with Bryn Mawr College at one and the same time, I must be excused if perhaps I put down to Bryn Mawr some impres- sions that belong rather to all this part of the world than to any par- ticular corner of it, however characteristic. Not that Bryn Mawr impresses me as being characteristically American; indeed, from the moment my English eye first lighted on the campus, with its charmed circle of baronial halls and hoary towers, with all its possibilities of bats, owls, ghosts, and games of hockey, the college has always seemed to me very un-foreign and familiar. And it was especially comforting to find that I could make myself understood without having to learn the English tongue all over again, as discouraging friends had threatened. Even after 1911] Impressions of Bryn Mawr 5 these many months at Bryn Mawr, there are times when I still find it hard to believe that this really is not home, and that the other hemisphere is not just round the corner. However, there are so many points of -difference between this and my Alma Mater, Newnham College, that I had a strenuous time when I first arrived, trying to account for them all. What seemed to me most queer of all was that you could almost never go through Rocke- feller gateway without meeting a hurrying figure with a suitcase firmly grasped in her hand : evidently, I used to think, some unfortu- nate freshman acting on first impulses, and giving up college life in disgust. When I discovered that these little odd holidays were a reg- ular part of everyday life, my idea of American \" Liberty\" began to be definite. At my own college our names are registered night and morning and the attractions of university life off the campus are locked out at eight-thirty nightly. The necessity for faculty chap- eronage and a vice-principal's permission (though not refused) for all evening expeditions — disadvantages of living in the midst of a grand old university town which still eyes a women's college with something of distrust — made me rejoice especially in the freedom of Bryn Mawr, untrammelled by this atmosphere of watchful criticism from without. And I was charmed with the picturesqueness of dress that contrasted so strongly with our sober tweeds and decently- gloved hands: it seemed like one long party to spend one's days among people so wonderfully clothed and taking such an evident interest in outward as well as intellectual graces. With us it is only the men students who habitually brighten their lives with anything so frivolous as a colour-scheme. The whole question of self-government interested me very much, but it was sometime before I came to believe that there really is such a thing. That hundreds of girls could be satisfactorily con- trolled by the \"rule of a simple majority\" and a sense of honour would have sounded too Utopian to me a few months ago ; and I should have objected strongly to the position of being more or less \"my brother's keeper\" which it would seem to involve ; besides the danger that such a constant appeal to their moral backbone might make students almost inhumanly good and self-critical — overcloud- ing the froh und ungebunden frame of mind that they need to have outside of work hours. But it is a fascinating experi- ment and certainly Bryn Mawr is equal to it. The strong 6 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April 'public spirit' in the college must be one of the good results of this government by public opinion. And I was interested to notice the importance of class spirit and the public feeling against any tendency to divide up into Halls, whereas in my own college the classes have not even names to distinguish them, but the Halls vie with one another in every possible way — in work and games, brains and beauty, even speed and efficiency of fire brigades and strenuous keeping of quiet hours each having its own essential character and traditions, so that you would no more think of leaving one Hall for another than of going into voluntary exile. I can see here the many advantages of a strong class spirit — it seems to break down the bar- riers between the classes rather than to set them up; for certainly there is here less stiffness on the whole between one class and another than we have at college, where classes are not separated at meals and where every upper-class-man entertains every freshman to tea or cocoa — though only to pass her by, very likely with a cold unseeing eye whenever they meet in the street. Our freshmen soon learn not to smile promiscuously at their elders and betters, faculty or other- wise. But Bryn Mawr seems to have a certain tolerant good-fellow- ship— the spirit of democracy, I should call it — that makes a new- comer soon feel like a part of the whole, and must absorb even the shy and retiring people who may otherwise not get much good out of college. And I have been strongly impressed by the general air of jollity and well-being: most especially, too, by the keen appreciation of the Joke — as such — an end in itself, not a mere accident in the day's work. So far, in spite of the harassment of continual quizzes and required reading, and in spite of all one hears about the ex- treme nervous tension of the American student of today, Bryn Mawr students have not impressed me as being in a state of worry or anxiety or intense mental strain. I feel certain there is more of this unrest among the students of our university, where not one hour of the course (usually lasting three years) is counted to one's credit — or discredit — except only the last six days of the last year. This final examination can never be put off or taken again, so that if the student fails of honours (a mere pass does not satisfy!), the whole three years' work goes for nothing: and small wonder if dread of this disgrace hangs like an ever-dar en- ing cloud over those of us who, in spite of the orthodox devil-may- 1911] Impressions of Bryn Mawr 7 care attitude, still cherish a sneaking desire to stand well at the end. It is this harrowing uncertainty that seems to me to be most success- fully avoided by the Bryn Mawr system, which keeps up the interest of the students in their work all along and does not risk letting good work pass unrecognized after all. I should like to know whether the plan of sharing studies has any effect on the amount of work done ; it seems to me, as an outsider, a splendid arrangement, and I do not see that room-mates tend to be hopelessly inseparable or to interfere with each other's work-time. I cannot believe that the most per- suasive companion would lure you away from your work or your bed so insistently as do the flickering fires that we have in our rooms at my college. The hours that we waste there in coaxing the unwill- ing flames in the morning, and sitting dreaming over the embers at night, and cowering round the hearth at all times, would I think be a shock to the well-regulated, central-heated Bryn Mawr student. And here Bryn Mawr has a great advantage. A place without draughts and with every kind of provision for comfort — even down to rocking chairs, and \" thermostatic regulation\" — has, to my mind, some of the first essentials of good hard work : for there are not many things so distracting to an ordinary student as persistent physical discomfort. I am much impressed by the delightfulness of Sunday here at Bryn Mawr; it is one of the pleasantest places to spend Sunday that I know of. At my college, some of the Halls are positively a-quiver with music the whole day long : which may be welcome or not, accord- ing as it happens to be your own piano which is charming the air, or your neighbor's that is breaking the Sabbath stillness ! But there is one element here that seems to belong to college Sundays everywhere. Said one of our Newnham college maids, when asked by a visitor what the students did with themselves on Sunday: \"Sure, ma'am, the young ladies mostly eats — with intervals for meals;\" and here again Bryn Mawr is not behindhand. And in general it seems to me that it is hard to put down \"impres- sions\" of any one college that would not apply to most of the others. When I promised to write all this too presumptuous criticism I had in mind those many things fascinatingly peculiar to Bryn Mawr that could not fail to strike one fresh from a distant college. But the more I think over the question, the more strongly I realize that the differences are superficial, and that of real and vital distinctions 8 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April between one college and another I have little to say. It seems to me that, wonderfully as nation differs from nation in its ideals and tend- encies and habits of thought, the student spirit is one and the same the world over. Margaret Stewart Dismorr, British Graduate Scholar Bryn Mawr College. 1911] Editorials The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly Vol. V April, 1911 No. 1 THE NEEDS OF THE LIBRARY It is to be hoped that the hearts of many Bryn Mawrtyrs will be so deeply touched by the entreaties for help from the Bryn Mawr Faculty that they will at once send money in any amounts, large or small, to swell the Fund for books that the Quarterly is undertak- ing to raise. The subscription list is well begun by the gifts from Mrs. Alba Johnson and Miss Gertrude Ely, and by June we hope to have raised an amount sufficient to relieve somewhat, at least, the most immediate needs. When de- partments are receiving only about a hundred and fifty dollars a year as a regular allowance for books, even a dol- lar counts tremendously, and every little subscribed now will go a long way towards building up departmental libra- ries. It is encouraging to know the memorial for Miss Chamberlain is to take the form of books for the department of German. More such gifts would be acceptable, and classes celebrating reunions can at the moment be of greatest service to the College by offering their gifts for books. Bryn Mawr is still young, and in spite of her general appearance of prosperity and the money that has been given her in recent years, is really wanting some of the necessities of life — the where- withal to pay adequate salaries to her teaching staff, and adequate funds for the library. Carved seats, sun-dials, leaded windows, graceful fountains, elaborate decorations for the ceiling of the new library and elaborate carvings for the cloister — all such things, charm- ing and suitable as they are, are luxuries that can well be spared until the College has been furnished with the necessities of life, with adequate equipment in the way of books and apparatus. Col- leges maintaining a graduate school have to shoulder heavy expenses, for the very existence of such a school implies advanced courses in almost any subject a student may wish; and how can grad- uate work be done properly without a well stocked library? The plan of de- pending upon the professor for special books in his line works, only fairly well for the professor, who must lend, and badly for the library as a whole. As the personnel of the Bryn Mawr Faculty change's frequently, great gaps are left in the library whenever a professor departs, and the graduate student is more or less limited in choice of subject by the material which can be found in the College Library or a professor's private library at any given moment. The letters from various members of the Faculty, printed in this number under \"News from the Campus,\" tell their own story and need no explanation. What Bryn Mawr really wishes she al- ways gets; and eventually she must have a large endowment for her library. Now that she is urgently asking for books, let us tide over the time by re- sponding promptly and generously, and giving her immediately relief. FUND FOR BOOKS FOR BRYN MAWR COLLEGE Anyone wishing to suscribe to this Fund will kindly send their cheques to Mrs. Charles B. Dudley, Montgomery Avenue, Bryn Mawr, Pa., indicating for which department they wish their money used. If no preference is expres- sed, the money will go into the general fund to be divided equally among the departments most needing help. The Quarterly will report in each number the progress and the distribution of the Fund.

Andrews, General Fund 5.00 SCO. 00 CLASS HISTORIES In an attempt to collect accurate news of individuals and classes, the Quarterly has enlisted the help of class secretaries, but in many instances the secretaries write that they know as little about the members of their classes as we do, because there is no organized method of collecting and riling such information. The following letter from one of the most interested and enthusiastic of them expresses the dilemma perfectly. 10 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April \"Ever since the new order of affairs was inaugurated and the old Alumnae Report ceased giving 'Class Reports,' I have felt that I have been neglecting my duty as Class Secretary, but I really have not known how to do it. Since the secretaries are no longer supplied with forms containing printed questions and authorized to send them out, it seems to leave a collection of news so much in the air. Every secretary hears informally, of course, more about her own set of friends; in my own case, for instance, I never hear of any news of several of the girls in my class except through the Quarterly or some college publication Another difficulty I find is that very often I hear a piece of news about a girl, but hesitate to report it because it has been reported to me in a vague way, or because I may know the source from which it comes is not accurate. No doubt all these difficulties have been presented to you very often, but I hope you can set my mind at rest. Of course, I can see that the alternative for the present state of things would be to go back to the old plan, and have the forms sent out again, which involves a good deal of work and expense. I don't want to seem to be finding fault at all; I have only felt dissatisfied with myself. I've always enjoyed my little secretary's work and hate to feel that I have rather let it slide lately.\" (The writer then gives two news items.) \"So far as I know there are no births or deaths or marriages. You see the above is not much of a report from all the mem- bers of my class. I shall be very thank- ful for any suggestions as to how to do better.\" It would seem to us a wise plan for the Class secretaries to become also Class Historians and for the Alumnae Associa- tion to furnish them every year with an exhaustive questionnaire to bje sent by them to every member of the Class. The College is now twenty-five years old, and if this history of the early classes is not quickly compiled and printed, the details will have vanished for ever. The Class secretaries can gather information much more quickly and accurately than the College itself or the Alumnae Asso- ciation, and the Quarterly will gladly print the histories as quickly as they are compiled. Having once brought the histories of the Classes up to date, the secretaries could then collect their information every year, and publish it every five years, whether their classes were having reunions at these periods or not. If reunions were being held, the Class History of the past five years, presented in detail by the Class secre- tary, would become a distinctive and interesting feature of the function. The Quarterly has had in mind for some time the plan of sending out such a questionnaire, but the present state of finances will not permit of such an expen- diture. But either the Alumnae Association or the Classes themselves should take up the matter and avail themselves of the opportunity they have of getting this material printed. The Quarterly is delighted to co-operate in the matter and to work out some plan whereby information regarding the Classes is accurately collected and edited and put into definite form for the benefit both of the present generations and of genera- tions to come. NEWS FROM THE CAMPUS THE NEED OF BOOKS AT BRYN MAWR COLLEGE The Quarterly wishes to call attention to the urgent needs of the Bryn Mawr College Library.

Dear Madam : It may be assumed that readers of the Alumnae Quarterly fully appreciate the vital necessity of adequate funds for the purchase of books in any college which, like 12 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April Bryn Mawr, is engaged in advanced work. But the various ways in which our pres- ent meagre appropriations affect the different departments may not be so evident, and as the classics are better provided for than any other departments because of the Sauppe Collection, it may melt some capitalist's heart if I can show how urgent is the need of more money even for one of our best equipped departments. The mere sta- tistics of the situation, exact details of which have kindly been furnished to me by Miss Jones, are easy to state. The Latin department has an annual appropriation of $150. About half of this sum is eaten up every year by payments for current period- icals, bindings, and continuations of sets of books which appear at irregular intervals. The last item alone has been known to require more than half of the total appropria- tion. We are left, therefore, with about $75. for the purchase of other books — a sum so small that it would be ridiculous if the question were not so serious. To this must be added appropriations from the Condition Fund and occasional special gifts. From the former source we have received an average of $55 annually for the last ten years, from the latter about $40 for the same period. Thus we have had all told about $170 a year to spend on books outside of the periodicals. This sum is, of course, much less than many a college professor devotes annually to his own private library, and yet it must serve for an entire college department. Now this poverty pinches the Latin department especially in restricting to the van- ishing point purchases of books. The new and important work in language and lit- erature appears not only in the numerous periodicals for which we subscribe, but also in a perfect flood of new books, and we are wholly unable to purchase the new books which are essential if we are even approximately to keep abreast of the work in our field or to fill serious gaps in the Sauppe Collection. We can merely add a book here and a book there according as our limited means allow. Thus we are constantly fall- ing behind and the gaps in our part of the library grow more numerous year by year. It would be easy to specify, if there were space, many books and sets of books that we ought to have. But the worst feature of the situation is not that we cannot own the books that we need, but that the work of our numerous advanced students in Latin is seriously retarded and hampered. When a necessary book is not in the library of the college or in that of a professor, it must be borrowed from another library. Such books, even if we are able to borrow them, can be kept only for a limited period. If we need books that cannot be borrowed, the students and professors are forced to travel in order to consult them. This situation arises many times every year and it is a nuisance. A certain amount of it will always be necessary in the case of rare books, but I am speaking now of books which we could buy if we had the money. In short an inadequate library appropriation impairs the efficiency of our advanced work. The cry of the Latin department has not always fallen on deaf ears. One of the alumnae, Miss Helen Lee Stevens of the class of 1903, has for a number of years been donating to the department $25 — a very welcome help — and she now has a nice little collection of books to her credit. Another alumna, whose name I do not feel at lib- erty to disclose, has by the terms of her will bequethed to the college $5000, the in- come of which is to be used to purchase books for the Latin department. The latter in her full appreciation of our condition will not, I am sure, accuse me of undue levity when I say that her bequest fills me with conflicting emotions — a fervent wish of long life for one who has been actuated by so generous a thought, and yet a strong convic- tion that we need $5000 at once! Arthur Leslie Wheeler. 1911] News from the Campus 13 To the Editor of the Brtn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly. In reply to your request for a brief statement with reference to appropriations for the purchase of books, I would say, that in my opinion there is no more urgent prob- lem confronting those who are endeavoring to maintain the standards for which Bryn Mawr College has always stood. Unless regular and adequate provision is made for the expansion of the Library, the work of the College in all its departments must suffer. It is not my desire to urge any special plea for the department with which I am con- nected. The need is general, and should be met by an enlargement of the general fund which is the common source from which flow the appropriations to the several Departments. If, then, I speak particularly of the English Department it is merely because concerning its needs I have more definite knowledge. Of the regular annual library appropriation the English Department receives equal share with the others. This appropriation, however, is sub-divided into five por- tions— one-fifth being assigned to each of the four Faculty members of the Depart- ment, and the remaining fifth to the English Essay work. It is clear, therefore, that the sum placed at the disposal of the individual instructor is not large — in fact, it is so small that I should blush to state it in print. Moreover, even this fractional ap- propriation exists only on paper, for the reason that the total amount granted to the Department is required to pay for the Journals (subscription price and binding) and the \" continuations\" (that is, series like Bonner Beitrdge, Yale Studies in English, Harvard Studies and Notes, etc.) for which standing orders are placed in advance in order that they may be forwarded promptly upon publication. For the purchase of any other books whatever we must seek a special appropriation — drawn usually from the Condition Examination Fund. In the distribution of these special appropriations the English Department very possibly has fared as well as any other — certainly our needs have been met as fully as the limited resources available gave us right to expect. But these special appropriations, though necessary in some cases to meet unusual emergencies, are much less satisfactory than a regular income. One has no assurance from one year to the next as to the amount which will be avail- able. And even the one who receives is made uncomfortable by the thought that, in a certain sense, his needs have been supplied at the expense of the needs of others. Finally, by thus granting relief in turn to this department and then to that, the bur- den is merely shifted without being lightened in the least. For the department which this year fails to secure any special appropriation will require next year twice as much in order to recover its lost ground. The problem, in a word, is a radical one, and it will not be solved so long as the regular funds available for the building up of the library continue to be as inadequate as they are at the present time. Carleton F. Brown. To the Editor of the Alumnae Quarterly. My Dear Mrs. Andrews: I have long wanted to draw the attention of the members of the Alumnae Associa- tion to the need of the Department of Economics and Politics for books. May I take the opportunity of doing so through the columns of the Quarterly? The amount appropriated annually by the College to our department for books is $150.00. From $85.00 to $90.00 of this sum is paid out for journals, periodicals, and binding, leaving about $30.00 to each member of the department for new publications. In addition to this annual amount a special grant of $100.00 was made in 190S-09; and the income of the 1902 Class Fund amounting to $25,000 was given to the depart- 14 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April ment in 1907-08. Since the year 1906-07 we have spent for new books $382.57. These figures are significant when we consider the field that must be covered. With $60.00 a year we are attempting to keep the Bryn Mawr Library supplied with all the latest publications in Economic history, theory, and economic geography; Political science, government and administration; Municipal problems and civics; Labor problems and organization; Statistics, economic, political, and social; Money, credit, and banking; Public finance, taxation, and tariff; Socialism and cooperative enterprise; Sociology; Charities, and corrections, and a list of allied subjects ! The result is that we can never equip the Library thoroughly along any one line. We can only buy the indispensable book for a class or a report. We must go without many desirable new publications. We can never buy sets of books or collections of docu- ments costing more than $60.00. We can never buy new editions of books already in the Library. We can practically never buy books of merely historic interest, owing to the quantities of current publications that must be added to keep the undergraduate work up to date as far as possible. We cannot attempt to buy foreign books other than a few French and German texts. It is true that we receive a number of Govern- ment publications free, and they are very valuable, especially for advanced students; but they in no way take the place of the reference books and standard works with which a department covering as many subjects as ours, should be equipped. Another point to consider is that this state of affairs has persisted so many years that the present departmental library is very unequal in value. Certain lines have been perforce neglected for years, when there was no professor or advanced student working in those subjects. Other subjects will be fairly well represented up to a certain date, when a change in the department meant a shifting of courses, and a change in the topics covered by the new literature. We are put to desperate shifts for material for report and thesis work for advanced students. Often they have to go to libraries in Philadelphia to read up these subjects, and to borrow books for a short time from the Library of Congress, and the few libraries with which we have exchange privileges. Also the difficulty of providing books for the large senior classes is harder to meet every year. The wise rule that none of the scanty funds of a department may be used to buy duplicate copies of books already in the Library is apt to make the life of the librarians and instructors a burden before all set quizzes and examinations. When a class of eighty persons is assigned reading in a book of which there is but a single copy — as must sometimes be done — the wear and tear on the instructor is apt to be as great as on the book. Our need for duplicate copies of certain standard works is second only to our general need for more books. May I add that though I am wholly in sympathy with the policy of the Alumnae Association in devoting all financial activities for the next few years to raising academic salaries, yet I feel that in an association of more than twelve hundred members, indi- viduals and classes may have wider, and at the same time, more special interests than the whole Association. No class gift, reunion gift, or memorial can benefit the college more immediately and more permanently than general library funds, or the endow- ment of departmental libraries. I am convinced that the most urgent need of the college at present is for books. We cannot maintain a standard of scholarship with- out the materials for scholarship. To attempt to do so, is to attempt the classic impossibility of making bricks without straw. Yours very sincerely, Marion P arris. 1911] News from the Campus 15 Extract from a letter to President Thomas. My Dear Miss Thomas: Mr. Brown has just told me of the interview this morning at which it was arranged that I should offer graduate courses in the History of Criticism in place of the Compar- ative literature I am now giving. . . . As you are leaving so soon may I mention another matter? I do not know when the library appropriations for next year are fixed, but am very desirous that my field shall be carefully considered whenever they are. There are so many serious needs in the way of actual literary material of the rarer sort from 1600 on, that the list already submitted to you only begins to represent it. Now the approach to Literary Criti- cism from the graduate point of view opens a new difficulty, for I find that only the most obvious hand-books on the subject are at present on our shelves. I am well aware that you have been very generous to the English Department for a number of years, but my trouble lies in opening graduate courses in fields where this library money has not been expended. . . . Very truly, A. H. Upham. Dear Mrs. Andrews: Some time ago I was asking one of my friends in the profession how much time he had for social activity and private research. I learned, as I suspected, that his hours were largely occupied with a task which he had virtually made his own; \"But,\" he concluded sadly, \"I spend a great deal of time in buying books. I have so much money to spend, that it is difficult for me to find enough desirable books to exhaust my appropriation.\" Alas, how different are the causes of our perplexity. In the Department of History at Bryn Mawr the time is taken up with vain endeavors to select the very small number of necessary books which our very limited appropriation will allow us to purchase. The regular allotment to the department is $150.00 a year. Since 1894-5, largely owing to the munificence of one contributor, there have been gifts amounting to $3632.53. These have been unevenly distributed, but they would average $164.53 a year. In other words, during the past sixteen years the entire department has had at its disposal something more than $300.00 annually. The result of this is that the Department of European History, for example, has about $150.00 a year, as has the Department of American History. But this is gross, and cannot all be used to buy books. First the cost of the periodicals must be taken out, and then sundry other items. In lean years, when there is no special appropriation, the remainder is very meager indeed. This year, owing to an overdraft from 1909-10, the Department of American History has for books $33 — enough to purchase Polk's Diary, and an odd volume or so. Of course this is an extreme case, but the departments of History at Bryn Mawr under the most favorable circumstances and counting extra gifts have less than half the amount regularly appropriated in a great university nearby. The results of all this are lamentable in the extreme. Bryn Mawr is one of the most important colleges in the land. It is really a university for women, since its work ia of the highest standard, real university work. Yet it has a library about as large as the circulating library in a prosperous town of the middle west. In some respects this library is indeed remarkable. Among its 70,000 volumes there is about as little useless material as it would be possible to find. In quality it is excellent, and for what it does contain it is worthy of the highest praise. Because of what it does not contain, it is wretched. 16 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April In doing seminary work, I am confronted by difficulties at every point. So little money do I have, that I cannot buy far ahead, but only for the present. By the time the books arrive the need for them has partly passed. Next year I hope to con- duct a seminary in the Reformation. Shall I confess that I have not an edition of the works of Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon, or Knox and no prospect of getting them? We have not even Janssen with notes. Yet I should be about as badly off in any other period. We have about one-third of the Rolls Series, a few volumes of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, and a fragment of Migne's Patrologia. I am giving a course in English constitutional history; only recently have I obtained Chadwick's volumes, McKechnie's Magna Carta, Maitland's Constitutional History, and Pike's Constitutional History of the House of Lords. Of the Statutes of the Realm I have the index volume; of the Statutes at Large, nothing at all. It may be said that after all, while this lack of funds is unfortunate, it affects only a few students who are doing advanced work; but is this so? \"Why do you give us this hard, dull reading\" my undergraduate students have asked me many times this year; and I have been forced to answer, \"Because there is nothing else in the library.\" Of source books, contemporary accounts, etc., for some periods we have next to noth- ing. I have said little about the Department of American History because I have not much to do with it. A description of it would reveal conditions even worse. A seminar in slavery is being given, but it was necessary to go to another institution to get Siebert's Underground Railroad. Such is the situation. The consequences I need not outline. Much excellent work has been done in the Department of History, but you cannot expect either teachers or students always to do first rate work with a third rate library. Surely Bryn Mawr, because of what it is doing and because of what it will do, deserves something better than this. Edward Raymond Turner. To the Editor op the Bryn Mawr Quarterly, Dear Madam: I was told some time ago by our librarian that the Romance Department had ob- tained probably fewer special funds to buy books than any other department in col- lege. As I asked why it wasso, the reply was to the effect that the Romance Depart- ment had practised more than others the Tolstoian virtue of non-resistance to evil treatment. The humiliation of being found too good has weighed on my conscience ever since, and 1 do not know whether I can ever make good for so many years of im- proper behaviour, but surely I am glad of this occasion to try. There is at least one redeeming feature in the situation, namely that I see, from a list of special library ap- propriations very kindly put at my disposal by Miss Jones, that I never let one year pass without heavily overdrawing. I further notice, on Miss Jones's list, that since 1905 we had an average extra appropriation of one hundred dollars (the regular appro- priation being $150). This gives an idea of the serious increase that would be neces- sary to do at least the indispensable; and since it is has to be done anyway, would it not be to the advantage of all, if it was done as a matter of course, regularly? Moreover this only about keeps us afloat. The gaps in the collection of books on hand are at times really too great. A few examples will suffice. Let us speak first of the question of Periodicals. We are running a Romance De- partment that claims to do scientific work; yet we are obliged to \"dispense\" with such \"indispensable\" reviews as: Revue des Langues Romanes, Revue de Philologit 1911] News from the Campus 17 francaise, Revue de Philologie, litterateur et historie, Biblioiheque de VEcole des Chartes, Journal des savants, Revue de me'trique et de versification, Revue celtique, Revue des Cours et Conferences, Entremetteur des cherceurs, Revue de la Renaissance, Revue la- tine, Revue des bibliotheques , not to speak of such important periodicals of a more gen- eral character as Nouvelle Revue, Grande Revue, Revue Contemporaine, La Revue, Vie litUraire, Revue hebdomadaire, Revue hebdomadaire des Debuts , etc., etc. With regard to Reference Books: We are covering all periods of literature and we have not even such standard works as Histoire litteraire de la France, ouvrage commence par les Benedictins, et continue par les membres de VInstitut (32 volumes out now, folios) Camille Zullian's Histoire de la Gaule (3rd out) Ampere: Histoire lit- ieraire de la France avant Charlemagne. Migne's Patrologia (a few volumes we have) The various editions of the Dictionnaire de rAcademie(we have only the first and last) ; the small Godefroy of Bernard et Salmon. So as not to go into a tedious enumeration of books, I will give only one more illus- tration here of a collective character. Out of more than fifty volumes now out in the splendid Collection des grand ecrivains frangais (published under the general editor- ship of Mr. J. J. Jusserand, French ambassador in Washington) we have only a very limited number. As they cost two francs a piece, it shows how rarely we have forty cents to spare. I may add that it has become a sort of unwritten law that whenever a professor has a book, the library need not have it. But this plan works very badly for the library; for as a professor will naturally own himself most \" indispensable\" books, the result will be that the library will generally not have the \"indispensable\" books. Such classics as Lawson, Faguet, and Pellisner's Histories of French litera- ture were bought only very recently because Mr. Blossom wanted to assign collateral reading in them. In the Lecture Work we are often very much hampered too. For this protestant country it is a remarkable fact that a college library like ours should be without one single book by Calvin. Our largest literature course (Minor) deals with the 18th century, and the professor is obliged to dispense with the momentous work of Di- derot and D'Alembert, the famous Encyclopedic In the standard editions of Les Grand Ecrivains de la France, we miss all the Pascal volumes, all the Retz volumes, and all the Saint Simon volumes. Professor Foulet gave his Moliere Graduate Course several times with an incomplete set of the Moliere of the same collection. And this reminds me of another sad circumstance: to own various editions of a writer is one of the most important things in scholarly work to-day. I have been obliged, however, to give a graduate seminary in Rousseau for years, with only one cheap edition (13 volumes for less than 6 dollars) just as good as the Bible for ruining the e}' es of its stu- dents. We have a very good Rousseau collection besides, but what ought to be the basis of the work, we have never been able to afford. I stop here and only beg now to call attention to two (out of many) drawbacks created by this situation. The first is that we are obliged to give much more time to our researches than if we could work under normal circumstances; it develops no doubt to an unusual degree our ingenuity for getting information in some round about fashion; but in the meantime others, better provided with books, get ahead of us in producing, and our efforts fail to be duly rewarded — which is often very disheart- ening. Sometimes I feel that we are about in the position of a man who in our 20th century, for some reason or other could not procure matches, but would have to rub together two pieces of wood each time he wants to smoke his pipe; surely you cannot blame him if, at times, he finds that he pays a rather high price for his moments of bliss. Another great difficulty brought about by these conditions is that of suggest- 18 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April ing subjects for Doctor's Dissertation; it is no easy matter to find such that can be treated with the books at hand; and it is no secret, I suppose, that graduate students are not always in a position to go to very great expenses for books. We depend mostly on European fellowships, and as there are only two awarded each year, the problem remains almost entire. This is a true picture. I do not wish however, to convey an impression of prevailing discouragement. None of the members of the Romance Department proposes, as yet, to commit suicide. They will to their work cheerfully as well as they can under the circumstances. Provided only it be understood that they feel a terrific thirst at times when they hear of a colleague in some other institution who gets 2000 dollars appro- priation for the mere asking, or of another who calmly tells that he has 300 dollars a year for seminary books only (periodicals not included) ; and that they could do their work better and with a considerably smaller expenditure of time in case some means could be found to relieve the situation, the aim of this letter would be reached. I beg to remain, Madam Editor, with only the best feelings for Bryn Mawr College and with deep sympathy for its library, Very truly yours, A. Schinz. THE ALUMNAE MEETING Inasmuch as the Quarterly no longer prints the Annual Report of the Alumnae Association, and as there are therefore many subscribers to the Quarterly who do not receive it, it may not be undesirable to quote from the minutes of the meeting. \"The annual meeting of the Alumnae Association of Bryn Mawr College was held in the Chapel, Taylor Hall, February 4, 1911, the President, Susan Fowler, in the chair. \"After the very interesting reports of the Board of Directors and the standing com- mittees were read and accepted, a special request was made that the Treasurer give a general outline of the finances of the Association. This the Treasurer did, answer- ing questions as to the condition of the general exchequer and the different funds. The meeting was so impressed by the tremendous amount of work the Treasurer had given the Association that it was moved and seconded \"that a vote of thanks be given Jane B. Haines, in recognition of her able and untiring services as Treasurer of the Alumnae Association of Bryn Mawr College for twenty years.\" \"According to the desire of the Association as expressed at the special meeting held May 7, 1910, Elizabeth B. Kirkbride, Alumnae Director of the College, read a statement of the present condition of the Alumnae Academic Endowment Fund, its \"in- come, expenditures and investments,\" and also a general outline of the finances of the College.1 \"The special committee consisting of Evangeline W. Andrews, Chairman, Pauline Goldmark, Frances Finck Hand, Julia Langdon Loomis, and Martha G. Thomas, appointed in May, 1910, to report on the terms of a future deed of gift for alumnae gifts to the College was represented by Pauline Goldmark, who reported on the terms of the future deed of gift approved by the Committee. The deed as read was accepted by the meeting section by section as follows: 1. Resolved, That the name of the Fund to which the alumnae have already given $250,000 shall be the Alumnae Academic Endowment Fund. lAny one not a member of The Alumnae Association can secure a copy of the Annual Report by applying to the Corresponding Secretary. 1911] News from the Campus 19 2. Resolved, That future gifts to the Alumnae Academic Endowment Fund be added to the principal of the Fund, and that the income of the Fund be used for the continued increase of academic salaries (starting with the salary scale for similar positions in force January 1, 1909) beginning preferably with heads of departments, until such salaries reach a standard approved by both the Directors of Bryn Mawr College and the Alumnae Association of Bryn Mawr College. 3. Resolved, That the term ' ' academic salaries' ' shall be interpreted to mean salaries of the teaching staff. 4. Resolved, That the Directors of Bryn Mawr College shall have full power to invest the Fund at their discretion, provided that no part of it shall be invested in halls of residence for students. 5. Resolved, That the money to be raised by the Alumnae Association may be used as a pledge to secure conditional gifts to the College, provided that the conditions of the Alumnae Academic Endowment Fund are not altered by the conditions imposed on such other gifts. 6. Resolved, That the Trustees of Bryn Mawr College be asked to make, through one of the Alumnae Directors, an annual statement to the Alumnae Association of Bryn Mawr College showing the income, expenditures, and investments of the Alumnae Academic Endowment Fund, and that an annual statement embodying the finanical reports of the Treasurer and President of Bryn Mawr College be obtainable on request by any member of the Alumnae Association. 7. Resolved, That when the next addition is made to the Fund, the Directors of Bryn Mawr College be asked to accept a new deed of gift for the entire Alumnae Academic Endowment Fund embodying these resolutions in place of the deeds of gift of 1909 and 1910. 8. Resolved, That for each $100,000 added to the principal of the Fund, the Bryn Mawr Alumnae Association accept the offer of the Trustees of Bryn Mawr College to name a Chair in the College as having been endowed by the Alumnae Association. 9. Resolved, That if any of the terms of the deed of gift are not carried out, the Fund thereby granted shall revert to the donor and its successors, provided, however, that the terms of the deed may be changed upon request of the Board of Directors of Bryn Mawr College, if the new terms are agreed to by a three-fourths vote of all the alumnae of Bryn Mawr College who vote on the question, an opportunity having been given all alumnae to vote. The Deed of Gift Committee through Pauline Goldmark further suggested that the Board of Directors of the Alumnae Association be empowered to appoint a special committee, or be themselves empowered to confer with the Directors of Bryn Mawr College and to draw up the legal articles of the final Deed of Gift embodying these resolutions before the next addition is made to the Alumnae Academic Endowment Fund. The report of the Deed of Gift Committee as a whole was accepted. Proposed amendments to the by-laws were then read as follows: Article II, Section I, omit the words \"in February\" and after the words \"Board of Directors\" add \"preferably the Saturday, of the Mid-year recess.\" The subject of a more systematic organization of the Association into branches or chapters at various points in the United States was brought to the consideration of the meeting by the following motion: Moved that the Board of Directors of the Alum- nae Association appoint a committee of seven to consist, as far as possible, of members of the executive boards of existing Bryn Mawr Clubs and local organizations, who 20 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April shall hold office for one year and shall present to the Association at the next annual meeting a plan for a forming local organizations in various parts of the United States. The motion was carried with a recommendation that such committee consider particularly: (1) the geographical distribution of the alumnse and former students of Bryn Mawr in order to determine where the main centers should be and what radius they should include; (2) the desirability of these local organizations including not only alumnae but all who might be associate members of the Alumnae Association, and the undesirability, therefore, of connecting these organizations by any system of voting with the central organization; (3) the existence, at present, of Bryn Mawr Clubs and local organizations and the desirability of consulting with these in order not to duplicate organizations and to make one organization in a given town meet all needs; (4) the necessity, if anything like effective work is to be done, of inducing all clubs and organizations to agree upon the same date for their annual meetings in order that they may receive the business of the annual meeting of the central organization, discuss it, offer nominations for the Academic Committee and members of the Board of Direc- tors of the College and keep in touch with the affairs of the central organization; (5) the preparation of a by-law that will contain their final recommendations and the rewording of the present by-laws to make them conform to the requirements of the new by-laws. Marion Parris then told of the formation of the Philadelphia Branch of the Alumnae Association at a meeting called by a few members at the Students Inn, Bryn Mawr, January 6, 1911. Investigation showed that there were three hundred and ninety regular members of the Association and about fifty associate members near Phila- delphia. The meeting was very successful and it was hoped that a precedent for the formation of other branches had been established. Katrina Ely Tiffany asked the privilege of speaking to the meeting on behalf of a project about to be started in New York for college women who must earn their living. Several branches of Alumnae Associations of other women's colleges wished to support a bureau of employment for women where occupations other than teaching might be made attractive. A large field was open for women in many departments of business but there had been no organized effort made to show them the way. An informal dis- cussion of this plan took place which showed that the sense of the meeting was against using funds of the general Association for such a project. The subject of the past and future usefulness of the Academic Committee was brought to the attention of the meeting by a communication from Evangeline W. An- drews in the form of a proposed amendment to the by-laws. Many of the alumnae felt with Mrs. Andrews that a change in the duties of the Committee might prove to the advantage of the Association, but at the meeting they felt that a new by-law would not bring the desired results. The by-law as written by Mrs. Andrews was read merely as a communication to the meeting. \"The members of the Academic Committee shall be chosen for their special fitness to discuss matters pertaining to education and administration. This committee shall hold a series of meetings each academic year during the week preceding and including the date of the annual meeting of the Alumnae Association to confer with the authori- ties of Bryn Mawr College on matters of interest connected with the College and with education in general. It shall have power to arrange for other meetings at its discre- tion. Each member of the Academic Committee shall be appointed by the chairman of this committee, chairman of a sub-committee of her own choosing; she shall be instructed to report in full upon the subject assigned her at the regular meeting held at Bryn Mawr, and if she cannot attend this meeting herself, she shall send a member 1911] News from the Campus 21 of her sub-committee who is familiar with the work. The duties of the Academic Com- mittee shall be social as well as academic. It shall undertake to know personally the various authorities of the College, shall familiarize itself with student life, and the better to accomplish these objects shall reside in the halls of residence during its stay in Bryn Mawr preceding the annual meeting. It shall make to the Association at its annual meeting a full report of its own work during the year and shall place in the hands of the Recording Secretary of the Alumnae Association not later than two weeks after the annual meeting a full account of the meetings held at Bryn Mawr, the subjects discussed and the results reached. It shall see that the unfinished business of one year is carried over to the next and that the Association is kept informed of progress. After a discussion of this subject the following resolution was adopted : Resolved, That the Board of Directors appoint a committee of five to consider the possible re-organization of the Academic Committee and to report to the Association at the next annual meeting, and that Mrs. Andrews' letter on the subject of the re- organization of the Academic Committee be placed in the hands of the Committee of five, for their consideration. The President reported that the elections for the Academic Committee just held were incomplete. There should have been nominations for two more members to succeed Frances Finck Hand and Elizabeth Winsor Pearson, who were to serve only until this election. These two members were appointed to succeed Ruth Furness Porter and Evelyn Walker, resigned, whose terms of office would end 1912, but the by-laws provide that substitutes shall serve only until the next general election. To relieve this situation the following resolution was passed : Resolved, That the two appointments to the Academic Committee made last spring by the Board of Directors to fill places made vacant by resignations be allowed to continue to the end of the terms of the members resigned. The following resolutions were passed: Resolved, That a vote of thanks be sent to the President and Board of Directors of the College for the luncheon to which the alumnae were invited after the meeting. Resolved, That a cablegram of greeting to President Thomas be sent from the meeting. The President read the names of the alumnae who had died during the year. Ruth Emerson Fletcher, '93; Estelle Reid, '94; Anna Clapp Radiguet, 95; Mary James Hoffman, '95; Juliet Baldwin, '98; Constance Robinson, '98; Charlotte B. Mitchell, '99; Jane C. Shoemaker, '95; Frances Simpson Pfahler, '06; and the fol- lowing resolution was adopted by a silent rising vote: Whereas, in the deaths of these members, the Alumnae Association of Bryn Mawr College has suffered great loss, be it Resolved, That we desire formally to express our deep grief and to record our sense of bereavement and to express our sympathy to their families, And be it further resolved that copies of these resolutions be sent to the families of these members and be inserted in the records of the Alumnae Association. On motion the meeting adjourned. Elizabeth Nields Bancroft, Recording Secretary. 22 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April CAMPUS NOTES AN ENFORCED HOLIDAY The sudden appearance of three cases of scarlet fever among the students caused the authorities to take quick action. The cases were isolated and the college was closed on March 14 for two weeks. Nearly all the students went home, a few only remaining in quarantine; and as up to date the three cases have proved light ones and no new cases have appeared, it is believed there will be no further outbreak. In con- sequence of this enforced holiday, there was no regular Easter vacation. PHILOSOPHICAL CLUB The first formal meeting of the Philosophical Club was held in Taylor Hall on the evening of January thirteenth. Professor Watson of Johns Hopkins University lect- ured on the \"Experimental Evidence for a Homing Sense in Birds.\" Professor Watson has been studying two species of birds that spend the nesting season at Bird Key, a small island out in the Gulf ofaMexico. His experiments in sending birds over an all-water pathway of often 1100 miles seemed absolutely to refute the different theories — visual, olfactory, or magnetic — that have heretofore been held of the hom- ing sense. The lecture was followed by a reception in Rockefeller Hall at which the members of the Philosophical Club and their guests were given an opportunity to meet the lecturer of the evening and to ask questions as to what might be his own theory of the homing sense. PRESS CUTTINGS By Bernard Shaw The Bryn Mawr Equal Suffrage League have the honor of first presenting a play of Bernard Shaw's at College. On the evening of February seventeenth they played Press Cuttings, never before given in America, and censored in England for its pointed political allusions — allusions that proved, on the whole far too pointed for our audience, although it was practically unanimous in thinking Press Cuttings one of the cleverest and funniest of Shaw's plays. According to the custom of this writer, the situations and characters are merely used as a means of promulgating penetrating and startling comments on life, in this case, political life. General Mitchener, trained in German ways, has succeeded in getting compulsory military service, but is quite unable to quell violent suffragettes. When the play opens the General is seen sitting before his desk, shuddering at the cries of \" Votes for Women\" outside; his discontented orderly, who serves as sarcastic comment on the blustering General, brings in a woman who has padlocked herself to the door scraper. When unlocked she proves to be Balsquith, the prime minister, who has secured access to the General by this suffragette disguise. The discussions between these two statesmen, although mainly concerned with the suppression of the feminine revolt, also touch so satirically upon modern political problems that one quite under- stands why the British government found the play unseemly. General Mitchener who has been brought up \"not to use his brains,\" has one solu- tion for every difficulty, \"Shoot them down.\" Balsquith, however, who feels the value of public opinion, cannot agree that if \"you shoot down the matter, you kill the mind.\" He also does not believe that Germany can be made to consider the \"interests of the British government as paramount.\" Both, however, seem to agree that real govern- ment is that of the \"masses by the classes.\" 1911] News from the Campus 23 While they thrash out these high matters, two anti-suffragettes are admitted. Mrs. Banger has led a charge at Kassassin, and thinks little of the vote. \"Do not the men have it?\" She wishes to oppose women by women and lays her plans before the Gen- eral. She is speedily dismissed by the terrified officer. Her companion, Mrs. Corin- thia Fanshawe, is an \"aesthete,\" and founds her \"dislike to woman suffrage on a novel interpretation of the Salic law — when men are all on the throne, women rule. The General, utterly confused by the \"weather cock\" movements of her brain, at length induces her to leave. He and Balsquith both decide that enfranchising women will not make much difference anyway, and Mitchener puts seal to his submission by proposing for the hand of his able charwoman, Mrs. Farrell. She ungraciously con- sents, and women have won the day. As a brief for woman suffrage, Press Cuttings is not especially convincing. We are, however, grateful to the Suffrage League for giving it, in that it necessitated a caste chosen from the college at large, rather than from any particular class. Miss Prussing 1911, who coached the play, carried off the difficult part of Mitchener excel- lently well, by skilful use of her voice and complete absorption in the part. Balsquith, the cautious cultured diplomat, was convincingly given by Miss Egan, 1911, who was unusually successful in the difficult matter of acting the middle-aged man. Miss Cabot, 1914, made her first appearance on the Bryn Mawr stage as Lady Corinthia Fanshawe, winning much applause by her interpretation of the woman with temper- ament. Miss Chase, 1912, as the militant Mrs. Banger, delighted the audience. Per- haps the most flawless acting was that of Miss Morrow, 1912, as the brisk charwoman. It would be hard to imagine any improvement in the part. Miss Scott, 1911, as the winning young orderly, won the most applause, whether because of her finished acting or that mysterious thing they call \"stage charm,\" one cannot well determine. By way of conclusion we would remark that the great pleasure of seeing a new play of Shaw's presented in so satisfactory a fashion more than justified the Suffrage League in its temporary excursion into the province of dramatics. A GRADUATE COTILLION On the evening of February 18, the graduate students invited the seniors to a cotil- lion in the gymnasium. Miss Mary Eleanor Bartholomew, 1909, was mistress of cer- emonies and planned all the figures which were very original and pretty. The music was excellent, and we of the gallery suppose the refreshments were, too. MR. HADFIELD'S READING OF KIPLING The Bryn Mawr Chapel which has witnessed at various times religious services, concerts, political rallies, and college plays, had a new experience on February 25, when Mr. Henry J. Hadfield gave within its walls a \"costumed interpretation of Kipling.\" Mr. Hadfield, whom some of us may remember as the messenger in A Message from Mars, found in the poems of Kipling many subjects well suited to his dramatic powers. His performance was one which demanded no small degree of ver- satility, involving as it did the assumption of six or seven different r61es, which ranged from that of the cockney, Tommy Atkins, to that of the stately Rajah of Dacca, in gor- geous East India robes. Notwithstanding the rather tawdry character which these lightning changes and the primitive stage arrangements gave to the performance, the audience derived a very considerable enjoyment from Mr. Hadfield' s rendering of the poems themselves. Many of those which he gave were old favorites with most of us, made doubly inter- esting by the vividness of their interpretation. We were harrowed again by Gentle- 24 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April men Rankers with its bitterly tragic refrain, and again thrilled to the swift rhythmical lines of the Ballad of East and West. Several of the poems were quite new to us, such as The Door of Dacca and Army Headquarters, the one tragic, the other deliciously humorous. But perhaps the part in which we liked Mr. Hadfield best was that of Mc Andrews, the \"Dour Scotch Engineer,\" in Mc Andrews Hymn. Altogether, the evening was a most interesting one, and the audience felt that the English Club had been justified in standing sponsor for Mr. Hadfield. A GIFT TO THE GYMNASIUM On the afternoon of March 6, 1911, in the gymnasium the Athletic Association pre- sented the class of 1912 with a brass plate in appreciation of the class gift of leaded windows to the \"gym\" last year. The inscription on the plate reads \"Leaded Glass Window Presented by the Class of 1912.\" Miss Applebee made an appropriate and witty speech \"just to 1912,\" in which she recalled the beginnings of the new gymna- sium, and the laying of the corner stone when 1912 as freshmen marched in white dres- ses and blue ribbons at the end of a long line of upper classmen in cap and gown — \"like a molly cotton-tail!\" As 1912 drew near, said Miss Applebee, Miss Thomas leaned over to one of the trustees and apologised that these were the freshmen, in white dresses, whose caps and gowns had not come yet. Mary Pierce in the name of 1912 received the plate from Helen Emerson, '11, in the name of the Athletic Associa- tion, and it was screwed in place on the upstairs landing below the big front window. DR. SHOREVS LECTURE On Friday evening, March third, Dr. Paul Shorey addressed the Graduate Club. \"The study of the classics is on the wane\" is a complaint we hear on every side, said Dr. Shorey. Anxious educators, discouraged professors, and scorned classical students raise a hue and cry at pedagogical conferences and in the correspondence sections of our periodicals, and then return to their deserted class-rooms to parse Homer and Euripides and analyse the syntax of Plato. This, however, as a writer in a recent number of the Nation suggested, is not the way to remedy the ill. To human- ise the Greek and Latin races, to vivify the Greek and Latin languages, and to apply Greek and Latin thought, is the only method by which a universal interest in the classics can be aroused again in the intellectual world. This is a method approved and pursued by our Bryn Mawr classical department, and it is a method which was most brilliantly exemplified by our former professor of Greek in his lecture to the Grad- uate Club. Dr. Shorey has no impossible ideals to which his Hellenes must conform; he believes that the descendants of the Olympians were a race as human and as vulgar as the adopted heirs of the Pilgrim Fathers, and he finds in Athens the prototype, not of Oxford or of Heaven, but of Paris. His lecture dealt with the transition from the mar- tial to the mercantile Athens, and from the lofty to the colloquial literature. He be- gan with the death of Pericles and the overthrow of the Athenian empire and showed how Athens exchanged political for intellectual supremacy, aristocracy for plutocracy ; and individuality for cosmopolitanism. Except for the idealism of Plato, he told us, there was a general lack of high enthusiasms, and the town was devoted to \"wine, women, and fish.\" The dilettantes of Athens found \"well educated ladies with music- al names\" as charming as the dilettantes of Paris have found them, a condition which Dr. Shorey told us was quite overlooked by the German who translated the line, \"Trust a woman not to drink water,\" as \"Trust your wife and drink no water.\" The comedies which were quoted throughout the smart world \"whether after the 1911] News from the Campus 25 school of the Alliance Frangaise or of Stratford-le-Bowe\" discussed the dress and the food, the cooks and the coquettes of the day. Nor did this ancestor of the yellow journal confine its attention to the love-making of the youth of Athens. It made all manner of fun of the University, of the University extension lectures with Gorgias at their head, and of the school of \" Professor Plato,\" and his \" elongated, green potato,\" as they disrespectfully called the cucumber which seems to have been a favorite subject for dialectic. This, then, was the age that bridged the gap between classical Athens and Alexan- drian Athens — \"for even the Greeks could not always be classical.\" ^Eschylus escaped the ridiculous because he just attained the sublime. Euphuism and turgidity were bound to follow. So we have Aristophanes parodying the old tragedy and Euripedes, \"the Ibsen of the Periclean Age,\" laying the foundation stones for the new comedy. Menander lost the glorious exuberance of Aristophanean Billingsgate, but he found a vital source of interest in his realistic depiction of contemporary life and manners. This, in brief, is a summary of Dr. Shorey's admirable lecture. The best part, how- ever, is left unsaid. Without a raid upon his manuscript, one cannot reproduce his inimitable translations, and he had chapter and verse to prove each one of his asser- tions, all done into colloquial English and interspersed with irresistible English tags in such a fashion that the rafters of Taylor Hall shook with the ceaseless laughter of the audience. The very rhythms of the Greek were caught and reproduced by the translator. Such gems as this were immediately inculcated into current college repartee: \"A wise man just invented salted almonds to fill the interstices of conver- sation and give the silent jaw some work to do.\" One may venture to assert that the Greek race and Greek ideas have become more vital to the members of our community than some of us believed possible, and that no one of us again will dare call Greek a dead language.

The meeting was an enthusiastic one and promises well for the success of the new organization. NEWS FROM jTHE CLASSES The news of this department Is complied from Information furnished by the Class Secretaries, Bryn Mawr Clubs, and from other reliable sources for which the Editor is responsible. The value of this department would be greatly increased if Bryn Mawr students everywhere would constitute them- selves regular contributors to it. 1892 Helen J. Robins is teaching at Miss Shipley's School, Bryn Mawr. She spent much time while in Siena in helping her teacher of Italian with a new Italian Grammar in English, which has just been published and which is being sold for the benefit of the Boys' Playground in Siena, for which she has done much good work.

Goodale '10, and Anna M. Dunham, '08. The last named I chaperoned on the steamer back to the United States. As the last Quarterly spoke of Anna Dunham's being with Linda Castle, perhaps it would interest some of the 32 The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Quarterly [April older alumnae if you put under either '89 or '00 that I had breakfast with Mrs. Cox on the piazza of her charming home overlooking Honolulu Harbor.
