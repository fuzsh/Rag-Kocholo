Historic monuments, evocative landscapes, scenic towns, and romantic medieval cities await those driving through this fascinating country. From the green marshes and pristine sandy coasts of the north to the mountainous and wooded regions of the south, the 24 leisurely drives in this book take you on a trip through a hospitable country while showing charming, lesser-known places oﬀ the beaten track. Getting Started The front section of the guide provides all the practical information needed to plan and enjoy a driving trip in Germany. It includes an overview of when to go and how to get there, advice on renting a vehicle, and details of any documentation required. The advice ranges from driving rules to road conditions, buying gasoline to breakdown or accident procedures – the kind of background knowledge that will help to make driving stress free. There is information on money, opening hours, communications, health and safety, and other practical matters, as well as advice on accommodation and dining options, to ensure that you experience the very best of Germany’s hospitality. A language section at the back lists essential words and phrases, including key drivingrelated vocabulary.\n\nThe delightful landscape ranges from the windy Baltic Coast to the remote valleys of the Black Forest and from rolling green pastures to dramatic mountain peaks. Travelers will discover reminders of Germany’s riveting past, delve into the alluring multicultural life of its cities, enjoy ﬁne traditional cuisine, and marvel at the country’s beautiful natural vistas. Expect delightful surprises around every bend, packed with the sights, sounds, and ﬂavors of the real Germany.\n\nbegins with a list of highlights and a clearly mapped itinerary. There is useful advice on the best time of year to do the drive, road conditions, market days, and major festival dates. The tour pages contain detailed descriptions of each stop on the route, linked by clear driving instructions. Side panels highlight information on the most authentic places to stay and eat. Tinted boxes feature background information and interesting anecdotes. Each drive features at least one mapped town or countryside walking tour, designed to take a maximum of two hours at a gentle pace with stops along the way. The tours are flexible: they can be linked to create a longer driving trip; others can be shortened into day trips while based in a region.\n\nUsing the Sheet Map\n\nA pull-out road map of the entire country is attached at the back of this guide. This map contains all the information you need to drive around Germany and to navigate between the tours. All highways, major roads, airports – both domestic and international – plus ferry ports are clearly identified. This makes the pullout map an excellent addition to the drive itinerary maps within the book. The pull-out map also has a comprehensive index for easy location of sights. The map is further supplemented by a clear distance chart, so you can gauge the distances between the major cities.\n\nThe Drives The main touring section of the guide is divided into 24 scenic drives, ranging in duration from one to six days. All the tours can be undertaken in a standard vehicle, and no special driving skills are required.

Modern cities of glass and steel sit only a few minutes away from thickly wooded forests dotted with romantic castles. Germany’s combination of multicultural cities, historic architecture, and charming medieval villages set in breathtakingly beautiful countryside make it an ideal vacation destination. The country’s main road network is extensive and well maintained, but it is When to Go The itinerary for each of the drives suggests the best times of the year to make the trip, based on the region. Visits to cities and historic buildings are best made in the spring or early fall as it can get very hot in summer. However, July and August are the ideal months for a vacation by the sea or one of the numerous lakes. Winter offers skiing in the Alps, southern Germany, the Black Forest, or the Harz Mountains. The country also hosts numerous events throughout the year, which makes a visit worthwhile during any seasons. In fall, visitors can participate in traditional folkloric festivals such as Freimarkt in Bremen, which is held in midOctober. In December, festive Christmas markets are held all over the country. They are particularly charming in southern German cities with historic town centers and are good places to pick up souvenirs and presents.\n\nthe smaller roads that lead into the heart of the region. Here, through castles, villages, and magniﬁcent palaces, Germany’s rich history is waiting to be discovered. Take a break to sample some exceptional wines – the most famous vineyards are in the western part of the country, especially the Pfalz and Rheinhessen regions – or take time to admire the natural landscape, from the stunning beauty of the German Alps to the myriad glacial lakes in the Müritz Nationalpark.\n\nOctober (fall vacations). Roads can get particularly busy around Easter and national public holidays. To enjoy a stress-free trip, it is best to avoid driving at these times of the year. A visit to northern and eastern Germany between November and late February can be unpleasant due to harsh winter winds and low temperatures. Ice, rain, and sleet make it challenging to drive and uncomfortable for sightseeing.\n\nFestivals Nearly every town and village hosts a parade, street shows, concerts, and fairs. These include folk festivals connected to local traditions, such as the asparagus or grape harvest. In April and May, the first spring fairs are held. It is also time for the solemn observance of Easter. In June, a\n\nnumber of classical music events take place and July is a popular month for lively wine and beer festivals. January and February are the Carnival season while December is synonymous with Christmas celebrations. Public Holidays New Year’s Day (Jan 1) Epiphany (Jan 6) Easter Sunday and Monday Liberation Day (Apr 16) Labour Day (May 1) Republic Day (Jun 2) Reunification of Germany Day (Oct 3) All Souls Day (Nov 1) Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Dec 8) Christmas (Dec 25/26)\n\nTimes to Avoid In late July and August, it can get very hot, especially in the southwestern regions. The busiest period is during the school breaks, which see a great surge in traffic levels. These are set independently in each state and take place in early April (Easter vacations), July and August (summer vacations) and Left Panoramic view of Königstein village from its mountain fortress, Bavaria\n\nAbove Half-timbered buildings, Limburg an der Lahn, Hesse\n\n10 BACK ROADS GERMANY\n\nGetting to Germany A popular destination, Germany is well connected to the rest of the world. Every large city in the country has an airport, most of which oﬀer international ﬂights. All the major US airlines also operate regular ﬂights to Germany. The increase in the number of low-cost ﬂights has made it much easier to travel to Germany from various European cities. Travelers from outside Europe may ﬁnd it cheaper to ﬂy via London to take advantage of the many budget ﬂights available from the UK. Car rental services are well established at all the big airports in the country. DIRECTORY\n\nArriving by Air\n\nARRIVING BY AIR Air Berlin 01805 73 78 00; www.airberlin.com Air Canada 06927 11 51 11; www.aircanada.com British Airways 01805 26 65 22; www.britishairways.com Delta Airlines 01803 33 78 80; www.delta.com Düsseldorf Airport 0211 42 10; www.duesseldorf-international.de Frankfurt am Main Airport 01805 372 46 36; www.frankfurt-airport.de German Wings 0900 19 19 100; www.germanwings.com Lufthansa 01805 80 58 05; www.lufthansa.com Munich Airport 089 97 52 13 13; www.munich-airport.de Qantas 01805 25 06 20; www.qantas.com United Airlines 069 50 07 03 87; www.united.com\n\nGermany’s most important airports are Frankfurt am Main, Munich, and Düsseldorf, from where connecting flights can be made to other German cities. If coming from outside Europe, visitors are most likely to arrive at one of these major airports. The largest German airports are Frankfurt am Main and Munich. The gigantic airport in Frankfurt comprises two terminals, which are connected by a fast overground railway. The airport in Munich is somewhat smaller, but still very popular. Among the busiest airports are Düsseldorf Cologne-Bonn and Berlin, which is also where Schönefeld airport is located. Most airports are 12–25 miles (20–40 km) outside the nearest city and connected to the center by local transport or the Autobahn. International hubs such as Frankfurt, Munich, and Düsseldorf offer long-distance train connections. Germany’s national carrier is Lufthansa, which operates regular, scheduled flights to destinations all\n\nAbove Germany’s efficient budget\n\nair carrier, German Wings\n\naround the world. Germany and the US are well connected through direct flights from major US cities such as New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Air Canada operates daily flights from Canadian hubs to Frankfurt and Munich in arrangement with Lufthansa. Other carriers that offer flights to Germany are Delta Airlines, Qantas and United Airlines. British Airways offers regular, scheduled flights from London (Heathrow and Gatwick), to major German destinations as well as from several regional airports in the UK. Traveling to Germany by air and then renting a pre-booked car is certainly the best option for tourists from North America, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. In addition to Lufthansa, there are a number of other smaller carriers in Germany including Air Berlin and German Wings. These often offer cheaper fares than Lufthansa on internal routes, as well as providing air links with small airports such as Augsburg, Dortmund, and Erfurt.\n\nGetting to Germany 11\n\nArriving by Sea There are ferry ports in many coastal cities, including Kiel, Lübeck, Rostock, Travemunde, and Sassnitz. The major operators are DFDS Lisco, Scandlines, Finnlines, and Color Line. Visitors traveling to Germany by car from the UK will first have to decide which ferry crossing to use (unless using the Eurotunnel). The shortest crossings are from Dover to Ostende in Belgium, or to Calais, in France. However, these will also require a fairly lengthy road trip. The Holland route of Harwich to Hook is useful for those starting their trip in Germany’s northern region. For a direct ferry crossing to Germany, Scandinavian Seaways operates services from Harwich and North Shields to Hamburg. Travelers coming from Ireland should first connect with a ferry service from Dublin to England before taking one of the options mentioned above. The latest provision to make a journey from the UK to mainland Europe by car is by using the Eurotunnel from Folkestone to Calais. The car is carried by train in just 35 mintues.\n\nArriving by Train Long-distance trains called EuroCity (EC) trains connect all important German cities with major European destinations. There are also overnight trains (City Night Line) from various European cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Belgrade, Budapest, Prague, Rome, Venice, and Vienna. Eurostar’s high-speed passenger service also offers many cheap options for traveling by train. The Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s national railway company, operates\n\nhighly modern, high-speed trains, the InterCity Express (ICE). The long distance ICE network is also linked to the international airport hubs of Frankfurt and Düsseldorf. However, ticket rates in the express trains are quite expensive. Seat reservations are recommended during the tourist season and public holidays. Train tickets can be bought and reservations made through travel agents or at the railroad station at the Reisezentrum, which also acts as an information center. Tickets can also be reserved by telephone or through the Internet, where a detailed timetable can be viewed to plan an itinerary. Eurail Passes, such as the Eurail Global Pass, which allows unlimited first-class travel in 21 countries, are also a good option.\n\nArriving by Coach Traveling to Germany by coach is not a very enjoyable experience, as the distances are often long and fares not cheap when compared with low-cost airlines. Eurolines is the provider of international coach services to Germany. A hop-on, hop-off bus service, Busabout, serves Berlin, Dresden, Munich, and Stuttgart. Most towns have a bus station located in the town center called ZOB (Zentraler Omnibus Bahnhof ), where timetables can be obtained and tickets purchased. It is best to inquire at the tourist information center for travel details.

Public services operate smoothly and eﬃciently, and the health system is good. Every town, large and small, has a tourist information center that can oﬀer guidance on ﬁnding accommodation and information about local restaurants, attractions and activities. Germany is a safe country for travel, and its police are highly trained to deal with any emergency. Communication networks are good and almost all banks have ATMs. Language Although all Germans do speak German, many of them use dialects that are sometimes almost incomprehensible, especially to foreigners with limited knowledge of German. The most difficult dialects to understand are probably those of southern Germany, particularly Bavarian and Schwabian, but Frisian and Saxon dialects are also likely to cause communication problems, even for German-speaking visitors. However, English is usually understood, particularly in larger cities and in places frequented by foreign tourists.\n\nPassports and Visas Citizens of the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and EU member states do not need a visa to visit Germany as long as their stay does not exceed three months. However, visitors from South Africa do need a visa. Nationals from most other countries require a Schengen Visa, named for the 1995 Schengen Agreement that abolished passport controls between Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and\n\nSweden. This visa is valid for stays of up to 90 days. Visitors should check with the German embassy or consulate in their own country prior to traveling or visit the Federal Foreign Office website and search for “visa agreements.” Most embassies, including those of the US and the UK, are located in Berlin, but consulates can be found in other major cities.\n\nTravel Insurance All travelers are strongly advised to take out travel insurance that covers for a broad range of possible emergencies. It is mandatory for all foreign visitors to have a medical insurance policy with sufficient protection on a visit to Germany. In addition to medical insurance, a comprehensive policy will normally cover the holder for loss or theft of luggage and other belongings, such as passports and money, damage or injury to a third party; personal accidents; and delayed or canceled flights. Most policies also cover legal costs up to a certain limit. A standard policy will not cover hazardous or extreme sports, so anyone planning to go surfing, skiing, or rock-climbing must check their\n\nAbove Police patrol van policy; extra coverage can usually be added for a small premium. Most credit card companies offer insurance for lost luggage; one is also entitled to compensation in case of flight delays and cancellation.\n\nHealth Germany poses no serious health hazards for travelers and no vaccinations are required before entering the country. Ticks are prevalent in rural areas, especially during the summer months. Avoid long grass, keep to paths and wear long pants and sturdy shoes. Those who require prescribed medication should ensure that they take enough to cover their stay, as it may not be available locally. Citizens of EU member states can obtain free medical assistance in Germany if they hold a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). Travelers can apply for the card by filling in form E111 at any of the main post offices or online before leaving home. To call an ambulance in the event of an emergency, dial 19222 plus the area code if using a cell phone or simply 112 without the area code if calling from a pay phone. Pharmacies (Apotheke) can be identified by a sign\n\nPractical Information 13\n\nAbove left European Union passports Above center Ambulance Above right Pharmacy building, Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg bearing a large red “A.” They are usually open from 8am to 6pm and also have a list of doctors in the area.\n\nPersonal Security As in other countries, visitors are far safer in towns and villages than in big cities, where vigilance is needed against pickpockets and petty thieves. One should be particularly cautious in crowded places, such as railroad platforms and on trains and buses, as well as at popular tourist sights. Leave passports, jewelery and expensive items in the hotel safe, and keep valuables such as cameras and audio equipment concealed under clothing when walking around. Park the car in a safe parking lot. Report thefts and burglaries immediately to the police. The German police can be recognized by their green or blue uniforms. There are motorized police units (Verkehrspolizei) that patrol German cities by car, motorcycle, bicycle, and even on horses. To telephone the Emergency Services (fire and police), dial 110. There are emergency buttons on the platforms of the public transport systems in the bigger cities. Contact the local lost property office (Fundbüro) – there is one located in every German city – to report lost property. The railway\n\nnetwork, Deutsche Bahn, has its own lost property offices, as do the urban transport systems in individual towns. In the event of a more serious problem, such as the loss of a passport, visitors should approach their consulate. Officials at the consulate can help travelers to get a new passport or obtain legal advice. In some circumstances, they may even finance the purchase of a ticket home.\n\nDisabled Travelers Germany is well prepared to receive disabled travelers. Large museums and historic monuments have special ramps or lifts for people who are confined to wheelchairs. Offices and banks are also accessible to wheelchair users, and there are usually lifts at railroad stations and larger underground stations. Most public transport vehicles have been adapted to take wheelchair passengers. Many hotels, especially the higher grades, offer suitably equipped bedrooms. Contact NatKo for further information.

German phone numbers have area codes up to six digits long, beginning with 0 followed by a local number of five to nine digits, depending on the region. When dialing within the country, use the full area code. Public telephones are serviced by Deutsche Telekom. Some accept coins, others require credit cards, or phonecards, which can be purchased at post offices. Coins of smaller denominations are not accepted and unused coins are returned, but no change is given. Card-operated phones are located at central locations in cities as well as at airports and train stations. It might be useful to have a mobile phone when traveling in Germany, especially in remote areas. Travelers should discuss their requirements with their domestic network provider beforehand. Charges vary according to the facilities and coverage offered. Be aware that roaming charges are higher than at home. If from an EU country, tariffs should be less than 50 cents per minute; outside the EU, they may be substantially higher. A money-saving option would be to buy a local SIM card in Germany. Deutsche Post operates most postal services in Germany. Post offices are usually open Mon–Fri from 8am to 6pm and 8am to noon on Saturdays. Internet cafés can be found in all bigger cities and most hotels offer Internet services to their guests. An increasing number of hotels, restaurants, and cafés provide Wi-Fi access to their customers.\n\nThe Euro (€) has been Germany’s currency since 2002. There are seven denominations of Euro banknote: the grey €5, the pink €10, the blue €20, the orange €50, the green €100, the yellow €200, and the purple €500. There are eight coins: €2 and €1, 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5, 2, and 1 cents.

They also sell or give away useful material about city attractions, such as guidebooks, maps and postcards, and may be able to find and book a hotel room. The website of German National Tourist Office is also a useful source of travel information. Many cities also sell a Welcome Card, which allows the user 2–5 days free use of public transport and discounted access to museums.\n\nOpening Hours The opening hours of shops, offices, and other businesses depend to a great extent on the size of the town. In larger cities, the usual office opening hours are Mon–Sat from 9am to 6pm. Supermarkets and other shops often have longer opening hours (mostly until 8pm). In smaller towns, however, nothing tends to open until 10am. Shops everywhere are usually closed on Sundays. Museums and historic monuments are also usually open from 9am to 6pm. However, some places might be closed on a particular day, often Monday, so check opening hours before arranging a visit.\n\nTime Germany uses Central European Time, which is GMT plus one hour. There is Daylight Saving Time between the end of March and the end of October, when the clocks move forward one hour on the last Sunday in March and back on the last Sunday in October.\n\nElectricity Germany’s electrical system provides 220V, except in some hotel bathrooms, where a lower current is provided as a standard safety measure. US 110V appliances will need a transformer. However, UK 220V appliances can be plugged into German sockets with an adaptor.\n\nDIRECTORY COMMUNICATIONS International Access Codes Australia: 0061 Ireland: 00353 UK: 0044 US and Canada: 001 TOURIST INFORMATION German National Tourist Office Beethovenstrasse 69; 60325 Frankfurt; 069 75 19 03; www.germany-tourism.de\n\nSmoking in Public Due to the federal system of government, the law on smoking in Germany varies from state to state. However, smoking is completely banned on public transportation and in hospitals, airports, public and federal buildings, including the Parliament. However, there are differences between the German states when it comes to smoking in bars and restaurants. In some places, such as small pubs and bars, or during late hours, the ban is not observed at all.\n\nBelow far left Information center, Landshut, Bavaria Below left One of the many banks in Germany Below center Notice board outside Reiskrater Museum, Nördlingen, Bavaria Below center right Sign along the road to Bad Harzburg, Lower Saxony Below Tourist information office in Würzburg, Bavaria\n\n16 BACK ROADS GERMANY\n\nDriving in Germany Driving is one of the best ways to explore Germany. The road conditions are among the best in the world and a well-developed network of Autobahns (motoways) and major roads allows access to almost every corner of the country. However, it is the scenic drives away from the urban centers, through Germany’s beautiful landscapes that provide a unique experience. To make the most of your trip, it is best to know the basics of driving in Germany before you get started. Insurance and Breakdown Coverage When renting a car, insurance is usually included in the rate. However, you should check the details of the rental company’s policy. If you are traveling in your own vehicle, make sure that your insurance is valid in Germany, so that in the event of an accident, any damage will be covered. Most UK motoring services such as the Automobile Association (AA) and Royal Automobile Club (RAC), offer insurance for assistance, breakdown, and recovery in Germany. European breakdown, and repatriation cover is also available with the Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil Club (ADAC).\n\nWhat to Take Driving licenses from America and Australia are recognized in Germany. However, citizens of non-European countries should carry an International Driving Permit. Several agencies (www. drivers.com)are authorized to issue the permit, including the automobile association of the driver’s home country. In order to drive in Germany, EU drivers must hold a valid driving license and carry the registration documents and insurance policy for the vehicle.\n\nSeat belts are compulsory in Germany, and there must be a warning triangle in the car, in case of a breakdown. Also, every registered vehicle must carry a first-aid kit that includes disposable surgical gloves and a thermal blanket. If you rent a car, make sure that such a kit is provided with the car.\n\nRoad Systems Germany is famous for the Autobahn – a well-developed network of toll-free highways. The prefix “A” on a blue sign indicates the Autobahn. Besides the highways, there are well-maintained major roads (Bundesstrasse), which can be distinguished by the prefix “B” on a yellow sign.\n\nSpeed Limits and Fines There is no specific speed limit for driving on the Autobahn, although many sections of it recommend a speed of 81 mph (130 kph). On major roads, the speed limit is 62 mph (100 kph), and inside a city and in built-up areas, it is 31 mph (50 kph). There are mobile speed cameras and radars (quite often at construction sites) and heavy fines may be imposed if you exceed these speed\n\nAbove Driving along limestone cliffs,\n\nAltmuhl Valley, Bavaria limits. As a rule, the most severe fines, including the possible revoking of a driving license, begin at exceeding 30 kph (19 mph) over the speed limit. Fines can also be incurred for tailgating and parking in prohibited areas. In both cases, your car rental company will bill you for any ticket that is sent to them, along with an administration fee. Do not drink and drive. The law is stringent and penalties high. The legal limit is 0.5 mg, but if you are stopped for another traffic offense, the limit drops to 0.3 mg. The police can impose a fine on the spot. It is also illegal to use a mobile phone while driving. This also applies if the car is standing but the engine is running. If caught, drivers will be fined $77 (€60). However, bluetooth headsets are allowed.\n\nRules of the Road Driving is on the right in Germany, and seat belts must be worn at all times by the driver and all passengers, front seat and back. Knowing the general rules of the road is important. Be aware that passing other cars is only allowed in the left lane. Under no circumstances should you ever pass in the right\n\nDriving in Germany 17\n\nAbove left Deer and cow crossing sign Above center Highway to Limburg an der Lahn, Hesse Above right Sign for the Romantic Road, Southern Germany\n\nlane. There is no sign indicating otherwise, but there is a strict rechts vor links rule, meaning that a car or any other vehicle coming from a street on your right has the right of way. Germans usually drive very fast and quite aggressively. In the event of an accident on the highway, or if a traffic jam necessitates an abrupt reduction in speed, drivers should turn on their flashing emergency lights to warn other drivers. Distances are indicated in kilometers. Most road signs are internationally understood, though there are some signs which are specific to Germany. For example, on Autobahns, a yellow triangular warning sign with a row of cars indicates a possible traffic jam. On mountain roads, a sign showing a tire wrapped in a chain, accompanied by the word Schnee, warns of difficult road conditions due to heavy snowfall requiring snow chains. A yellow sign with the word Umleitung indicates a diversion. A horizontal blue arrow with the word Einbahnstrasse refers to a one-way street. A special rule concerns the so-called Low Emission Zones or Green Zones implemented\n\nin 32 cities throughout the country. One is only allowed to access such a zone if the vehicle carries an Emissions Badge (Umweltplakette). If entering a Green Zone with a vehicle that does not display such a badge, you could be fined $52 (€40). Visitors can obtain a sticker permitting entry into environmental (pollution-controlled) zones from car dealers, repair centers and garages in Germany. It can also be ordered online at www.umweltplakette.de\n\nBuying Gasoline Germany has a good network of gas stations (Tankstelle). Unleaded gas (Benzin) and diesel are also widely available. Leaded gas is no longer sold but you can purchase a lead substitute additive and add it to the fuel tank. Fuel in Germany is quite expensive. Prices can vary substantially and are among the highest in Europe. On smaller roads, and in more remote areas, it might sometimes take more time to find a gas station, so make sure that you have enough fuel when traveling through less densely populated regions. Visit www.benzinpreis.de for the latest updates on fuel prices in Germany.\n\nDIRECTORY INSURANCE AND BREAKDOWN COVERAGE Automobile Association (AA) 0870 600 0371 (UK) or +44 161 495 8945 (from abroad); www.theaa.com Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil Club (ADAC) 0185 101 112 (information); 01805 222 222 (breakdown service) Royal Automobile Club (RAC) +44 020 7930 2345; www. royalautomobileclub.co.uk COMMON ROAD SIGNS Anfang Start Ausfahrt Exit Gefahr Danger Halt Stop Steinschlag Falling rocks Zentrum Town center\n\nBelow far left Street sign indicating speed limit Below left Road along vineyards, near Nierstein, Rhineland-Palatinate Below center Painted sign to a guesthouse Below center right Road junction, Marburg, Hesse Below Winding road\n\nthrough Lower Saxony\n\n18 BACK ROADS GERMANY Road Conditions\n\nadmire the views.

It is also wise to take photographs of any damage to the vehicle, as well as the scene of the accident.\n\nParking Lack of parking space can be a problem in cities. Using one of the multi-story parking lots (Parkhaus) is a convenient option, although they are expensive. A green or red sign in front of the parking lot will indicate whether there is an empty parking space. You pay for the number of hours that you park the car. Parking in city centers is often limited to 2 to 3 hours. Payment can be made with coins or (rarely) credit card to an automatic parking-ticket machine, which will issue receipts that are placed on the inside of the windscreen. There are also parking meters with a timer that allow parking for up to 2 hours. In many large cities, there are “Park and Ride” areas outside the center. It is possible to park your car here to take advantage of the well-developed public transport system. It is never worth leaving your car in a prohibited area – a traffic warden will impose a fine and\n\nDriving in Germany 19\n\nLeft Typical yellow road sign indicating route and distance Right Slow-moving traffic in Pottenstein, Bavaria arrange for the vehicle to be towed away. Retrieving an impounded car is expensive and difficult.\n\nMaps It is always helpful to have a map with you when driving through Germany. Free tourist maps are widely available, but they are seldom useful for back roads driving. The best option is to buy an up-to-date road atlas that provides detailed maps of all regions of Germany. You can usually purchase road maps at gas stations, bookstores, and tourist information centers.\n\nTrailers, Camper Vans, and Motorhomes Camping in Germany is a great way to experience the country and enjoy its green landscapes. Trailers and motorhomes (RVs) are subject to the same rules of the road as other vehicles. There are many well-maintained camp sites in the country that are ideal for a tour with a trailer, camper van, or motorhome. These are generally open from April to September, although many are open year round. Most camp sites accept the Camping Card International (CCI), a document that can be used as a form of identity and is accepted\n\nby many camp sites as security in lieu of a passport. Many camp sites also offer discounts on presentation of the CCI. When driving an RV or trailer outside cities, do not exceed speeds of 43 mph (70 kph) and 62 mph (100 kph) on highways. The traffic police are strict about speeding, so be aware that you might have to pay a heavy fine if caught driving too fast. The websites of the German National Tourist Office and Eurocampings offers up-to-date information about most camp sites in Germany. It enables you to search for your desired camping location and gives detailed information about sites.\n\nDIRECTORY TRAILERS, CAMPER VANS, AND MOTORHOMES Eurocampings www.eurocampings.co.uk German National Tourist Office www.germany-tourism.co.uk\n\nTransporting Bicycles, Roof Racks, and Trailers Bicycle carriers, roof racks, and trailers must be strongly attached to the car. You can either affix the bicycle behind the vehicle or on top of the car. If you are using a roof rack, make sure that the weight of the items you want to transport is evenly distributed on the rack. As far as trailers are concerned, make sure that the items inside are properly secured so that nothing moves around in case of braking or defensive driving action.\n\nBelow far left Driving through the town of Weilburg, Hesse Below left Transporting a bicycle on a car Below center Camping sign near Pottenstein, Bavaria Below center right Signpost to the walk around Blaubeuren, Baden-Württemberg Below Road patchwork on the isolated stretch to Havelberg, Saxony-Anhalt\n\n20 BACK ROADS GERMANY Motorcycles\n\ncause serious injury or death to the child in a crash. Children under the age of 12 have to be seated in a special child car seat. In this case, it does not matter if the child is seated on the back seat or on the front seat. However, there is an exception to this rule for children who are shorter than 5 ft (150 cm). Children below this height have to sit in the back seat. Remember to request any necessary child seats in advance when making your rental reservation.\n\nThe drives presented in this guide are also ideal for a motorcycle trip. The well-maintained roads that crisscross Germany’s countryside allow one to enjoy a feeling of freedom while discovering beautiful vistas. To rent a bike, get in touch with one of the major rental services well in advance, as rental stations do not always have them available. AdMo Tours is a national motorbike rental chain where motorcycles and dirt bikes can be booked for short periods. Several brands are available for hire, including BMW, Harley, Suzuki, and many more. It is mandatory for motorcyclists and passengers to wear protective helmets at all times. Drivers must have a valid driving license to cover a motorcycle or moped, and an insurance policy. The rules of the road are the same for motorcyclists as for other drivers, although you should take additional safety precautions. Go slow when filtering or driving between traffic lanes. Give other vehicles a wide berth when passing them, and be aware that they might not always see you. Motorcycles must have rear number plate lighting.\n\ntravelers on this matter. Applicants have to provide a disability ID and a passport-sized photograph. Medical documentation regarding their disabled status might also be required.

The ADAC, Germany’s and Europe’s largest automobile club, offers rental services for tourists who cannot bring their own vehicle to Germany.\n\nDisabled Drivers There are a number of parking concessions for disabled drivers in Germany. Visitors from non-EU countries who wish to apply for temporary parking permits should get in touch with the local council or the district authority. Germany’s Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs can advise\n\nAbove Motorcycles parked outside a café, Hollandische Viertel, Postdam, Brandenburg You can call the ADAC service number (see p17) to find out how to arrange the booking. To rent a vehicle, it is necessary to present a passport and a driver’s license. Drivers must be over 18, however, check before you make your reservation regarding “age restrictions.” It’s recommended that you book in advance, especially during peak season – you will often get a better rate. Rental rates usually include unlimited mileage, but do double check. Consider renting a smaller car than you may be used to at home, as they are much easier to handle on narrow country roads than big SUVs. If you need a child seat, it should be booked in advance as well. Third-party insurance is compulsory and is included in the rate. Some rental agreements also include a Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which limits your liability for damages to the rental car, theft loss coverage and personal injury insurance; others charge additional fees for these items. Be sure to read your agreement carefully so that you fully understand what your coverage and liabilities are.

From December to March, roads in mountain areas can be coated with snow and ice. Highways are kept clear, but side roads may be closed completely, and access to other roads may only be permitted for vehicles fitted with snow chains. When renting a car, make sure you get winter tires along with the car, even though many companies offer just regular summer tires. Note that car companies usually charge extra for snow chains. Make sure that the tires are in good condition. In case of an accident, if the car does not have adequate tires, the insurance cover may not remain valid. The maximum speed possible with snow chains is 30 mph (50 kph). In Germany, winter tires are not mandatory, but on the spot fines can be imposed if the vehicle is not equipped for winter weather\n\nconditions. In other words, fines can be levied for not enough windshield cleansing fluid or use of the wrong sort of tires. Bring plenty of warm clothes, a blanket, food, and water during winter travel in case of major delays on the Autobahn, or if travelling under hazardous conditions in mountainous areas. Always reduce your speed in adverse conditions, as you will need a longer braking distance, and poor visibility gives less time to react. In high-altitude regions and mountainous areas, you may encounter ice and snow in winter. Slow down, especially for curves and turns, and keep your actions steady and deliberate to avoid sliding out of control. If the car skids, take your foot off the accelerator – do not brake – and turn the wheel into the skid until the car corrects itself. Watch out for ice, especially on bridges and overpasses, which freeze up first. If you hit a patch, do not brake or turn the wheel, but keep as straight as possible and coast over it. When conditions reduce light levels, dipped headlights should be used. Turn on fog lights whenever visibility is less than 328 ft (100 m).\n\nDIRECTORY MOTORCYCLES AdMo Tours www.admo-tours.com DISABLED DRIVERS Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs + 49 (030) 18 300 3060 CAR RENTAL Avis 01805 21 77 02; www.avis.de Budget 01805 21 77 11; www.budget.de Hertz 01805 33 35 35; www.hertz.de Sixt 01805 25 25 25; www.sixt.de\n\nBelow far left Camper van parked on the road between Wildsteig and Rottenbuch, Bavaria Below left Motorcycles at Schloss Rheinsberg, Bradenburg Below center Bicycle secured to a motorhome Below center right Well-maintained road to Bad Harzburg, Lower Saxony Below Downtown shopping street in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n22 BACK ROADS GERMANY\n\nWhere to Stay Germany, like many other countries, has numerous hotels converted from palaces, castles, and other historic buildings. The range of prices for a night’s accommodation is wide, and depends on the services oﬀered and the location of the establishment. Lodgings can be particularly expensive in the centers of larger cities. However, smaller towns located in the tourist areas often have rooms to rent at reasonable rates. Set amid country landscapes, charming, family-run hotels providing comfortable rooms and local specialities reﬂect the unique character of Germany’s back roads. Hotels\n\nGuesthouses\n\nHotels in Germany are categorized according to the number of stars awarded for facilities, and not the standards of service. However, the star rating is no guide to the more subjective charms of a hotel, such as the style of decor or the kind of regional cuisine served. In larger cities, it is not difficult to find accommodation in deluxe hotels that are often part of an international chain. Away from the cities, high prices generally apply to rooms in comfortable hotels in beautiful locations or those provided within historic palaces or villas. There are many smaller hotels, too, offering good, affordable lodgings. Often the name Schlosshotel indicates a hotel within a palace. Many of these hotels are members of organizations such as Historic Hotels of Europe, who can provide further information. A hotel labeled Garni suggests that there is no restaurant on the premises, only a dining room where breakfast is served. Apartmenthotels offer suites with equipped kitchens or a kitchen annexe.\n\nGuesthouses (Gasthof ) can be found throughout the country, usually located in private houses that function as traditional bed and breakfast places. Often labeled as Pension or Hotelpension, the distinction between a small hotel, a pension, and a private B&B varies from region to region. Quite popular, they are a good value for money. Located in smaller towns and villages, they are cheaper than hotels; however, the standards of service and facilities offered are also lower. The rooms are usually cozy and comfortable, and equipped with TV and a bathroom. Guests can also expect a large German breakfast in most guesthouses.\n\nYouth Hostels Youth hostels (Jugendherberge) represent the cheapest option for a stay and can be located in almost every town, as well as major tourist areas in Germany. Some are housed in very attractive historic buildings. While they offer cheap lodging, the standards are still surprisingly good.\n\nAbove Logo of Schloss Haigerloch, a luxurious three-star hotel, Baden-Württemberg, see p232\n\nAccommodation is usually provided in double or triple rooms, as well as in dormitories. In order to stay at a youth hostel, guests must carry a membership card of the Youth Hostels Association (YHA), which can be obtained from the association in their home country. Prices vary between €12 and €25 per day, depending on the choice of room and the region where the hostel is located.\n\nCamping Summer is the best time for a camping trip to Germany, as most camp sites close between November and March. These sites are well equipped, and usually have access to a shared kitchen, bathroom, and laundry facilities, as well as refuse stations. Most offer power connections. Some also feature playgrounds and restaurants and organize sports activities. A lot of camp sites also have additional cabins apart from pitches for tents, motorhomes, or trailers. Visitors should reserve a spot well in advance if visiting during the busy summer season, especially at popular destinations.\n\nWhere to Stay 23\n\nLeft Four-poster bed in Burghotel auf Schönburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, see p151 Right Oberhof resort close to Thuringian forest\n\nSelf-catering\n\nFacilities and Prices\n\nAlong the country roads, spectacular natural backdrops provide perfect settings for a picnic. Supermarkets are usually well stocked with all that travelers will need for an enjoyable outing, such as a great variety of food and camping crockery. Be sure to check the opening hours for supermarkets and convenience stores as very few are open at night or on Sundays, and almost none for 24 hours. Outdoor markets, often held on Saturdays or Wednesdays, are also a good place to pick up fresh produce that is easily transported.\n\nWith a wide range of accommodation available – from the basic to the luxurious – the facilities available generally reflect the price paid. Luxuries such as swimming pools and saunas are more often available in high-end hotels. For simple accommodation in beautiful surroundings, guesthouses are a good option. However, prices are also heavily influenced by other factors, such as the time of year. In resort areas, prices are highest in summer, while in larger cities, spring and fall are more expensive. Prices may also double if a city or region is hosting a special event. This is especially the case for commercial fairs and cultural festivals. In cities, hotels situated in the centers are particularly costly, as are establishments housed within historic palaces or charming villas. However, many hotels have reduced prices on weekends.\n\nBooking Reservations for accommodations can be made directly with the hotel by telephone, Internet, letter, or fax. Visitors can also contact the local tourist office and ask them to make the arrangements.

Menus increasingly feature local produce and there are markets where one can stock up on gourmet delights. Many establishments specialize in regional fare, which although heavy, is appetizing. In addition, ethnic cuisine, notably Italian, Greek, Thai, Turkish, Chinese, and Indian, is popular throughout the country and can be enjoyed even in smaller towns. Some ﬁne restaurants run by master chefs serve European cuisine of the highest quality. Practical Information Most restaurants are open from noon but sometimes close for a break between 3 and 6pm, while cafés open from 9am. Many are closed for one day during the week. On Sundays, brunch is served in most places until 2pm. During the lunch period, between noon and 2pm, many establishments offer a fixedprice menu that is cheaper than in the evenings. Dinner is usually served after 7pm. Calling to make a reservation is recommended in popular city restaurants. The cost of a meal depends on the location. While a three-course meal in some restaurants may cost $13 (€10), it is more expensive in downtown areas of larger cities. In more upscale restaurants, expect to pay up to $94 (€70). Alcoholic drinks can be quite costly, but beer, the national drink, is cheap. In general, the prices on a menu include service and tax, but it is common to leave a tip, around 10 percent of the total bill. Restaurants usually accept credit cards and display the logos of acceptable cards at the entrance. In most good restaurants, the menu is written in German and English, and sometimes also in\n\nFrench. In cafés and less expensive restaurants, the menu may be handwritten in German, in which case the staff may help with a translation.\n\nRestaurants The term Restaurant is used to define both upmarket restaurants offering fine cuisine at steep prices, as well as popular local establishments that serve affordable food. For regional cuisine, visit one of the many Ratskellers found in the cellars of old town halls all across Germany, which serve Sauerkraut (fermented shredded cabbage) and regional specialities at affordable prices. They usually have atmospheric interiors that are well adapted to the vaulted, dark spaces of the historic cellars. Weinstuben (wine bars) or Bierstuben (beer bars) also offer great local food such as seasonal vegetables in a Hollandaise sauce or with dumplings, accompanied by local beverages. A Gasthaus refers to a rather simple restaurant serving good regional cuisine in a family atmosphere. Self-service venues offering snacks are known as Imbiss. These can vary from a stall serving baked sausages and canned drink to kiosks with an\n\nButcher’s sign listing items on sale extensive choice of salads and fast food. These kiosks are often run by immigrants. In fact, in most large German towns, there are numerous kiosks serving Arabic, Turkish, Chinese, and American food. For a sandwich or a healthy salad, visitors can also try the restaurants or cafeteria facilities in department stores, which are usually self-service.\n\nCafés and Bars The term café has a variety of connotations in Germany. Often, this is a place that offers good breakfast options in the morning, while serving mostly international cuisine from noon onward. Sometimes a café will have a selection of cakes on display. In addition, at any time of the day and evening, customers can have coffee or ice cream. Many of these establishments turn into bars in the evening when alcoholic drinks are served and live music is played. A typical venue to have a drink in Germany is the Kneipe, which can best be compared to an English pub in terms of its atmosphere. A wide range of alcoholic drinks is available here, and sometimes loud music is played. The most commonly served beer is pilsner, a bottom-fermented\n\nWhere to Eat 25\n\nLeft Entrance to a restaurant near Schneider Brewery, Kelheim, Bavaria Right Sandwich stall, a cheap meal along the route pilsner lager. Brown ales are also popular. Schwarzbier, a topfermented brown ale is increasingly popular as is Weizenbier, a bitter top-fermented beer. A small variety of dishes such as Strammer Max (a slice of toast with ham and fried egg) are usually offered and diners can often enjoy indoor games such as pool, darts, or foosball.\n\nLocal Markets Lively markets are held at designated locations in the centers of towns and villages all across the country. Shopping at these markets is the best way to sample local flavors. A good introduction to the specialities of the region; they have a lively atmosphere and offer a great choice of fresh, highquality food. Farmers come to these markets to sell their fresh produce. Many farmers also have shops on their farm, where they sell their goods. When driving through regions known for their agricultural produce, keep an eye out for fresh fruit and vegetables, honey, wine, or sausages on sale. Each driving tour notes the location and days of the week for markets around the region. Other great places to visit are bakeries.\n\nA Bäckerei specializes in bread and rolls, while a Konditorei mainly makes pastries, cakes, and sometimes chocolates. Germans make excellent breads, often organic, from various grains. Bread in Germany is of two kinds: rolls (brötchen) and loaves (brot). Delicatessens where one can find high-quality sausages, cheese, meat, and fish are also worth a visit. Special deli counters can be also be found in major supermarkets. However, prices can be quite high here. All kinds of fresh meats and sausages can also be bought at the butchers’ shops (Fleischern), easily found in any city or town.\n\nDIRECTORY PRICE BANDS The following price bands are based on a three-course meal for one, including a half-bottle of house wine, cover charge, tax, and service: Inexpensive – under €20; Moderate – €20–€40 Expensive – over €40\n\nPicnics and Outdoor BBQs There are many nice locations especially designated for picnics in Germany. These are usually situated in pleasant green areas and are equipped with outdoor tables and garbage cans. Most towns have a shop or a delicatessen where one can grab picnic supplies such as cold cuts, sliced cheeses, breads, and salads. Traditional German potato salad and pasta dishes are often sold in convenient deli-style plastic containers for easy carrying on a road trip.\n\nBelow far left Atmospheric Weinstube, Würzburg, Bavaria Below left Cafés outside\n\nthe Rathaus, Lübeck, Schleswig-Holstein Below center Wine bar, Tüchersfeld, Bavaria Below center right Roadside sausage stall, Rostok, Meklenburg-Vorpommern Below\n\nLocal market, Münsterplatz, Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg\n\n26 BACK ROADS GERMANY\n\nThe Flavors of Germany Germany is home to a variety of cuisines, with signiﬁcant diﬀerences in culinary traditions between its regions. However, the country is uniﬁed by its love of meat, bread, sausages, and beer. Though traditional meals can be high in calories, a new generation of chefs is improvising German classics to create “nouvelle” dishes. Fresh produce can be found at the many farmers’ markets and charming stores across the country and homemade breads and cheeses and locally caught ﬁsh, are usually of a high standard. Northern Coast Northern German food is meant to sustain fishermen during long, cold days, and to this end, is full of starches. The hardships of life in the northern coast are reflected in the hearty and filling cuisine of this region, much of which makes use of ocean fish such as halibut or plaice, or freshwater fish such as trout. The popularity of Matjes, salted herrings with cream and onions, served with baked potatoes, has spread from the northern cities to the rest of the country. Warming stews and soups, such as Pichelsteiner Eintopf, a one-pot dish with meat, potatoes and vegetables cooked in broth for the harsh winter months, are readily available, as is potato, salad, which is served hot or cold with chopped pickle relish or onions. Potatoes, often cooked with bacon, are by far the most popular side dish in the region.\n\nRhineland and Southwestern Germany This part of Germany, with its winegrowing regions along the rivers Rhine, Mosel and Neckar, is known for its superb, often French-\n\ninfluenced, gourmet feasts. Swabian food is rich, traditional German cuisine. Pasta and bread feature largely in a Swabian meal including Maultaschen, large pasta parcels containing meat, cheese, or vegetables served in soup or butter, or Spätzle, a type of pasta, which in Bavaria is made with beer instead of water. Swabian food is often referred to as “wet” food, since it is often drenched in sauce or melted butter. The Pfalz, a region of southwestern Germany, is famous for its Pfälzer Saumagen, sow’s stomach filled with sausage, herbs, and potatoes. The Franks, inhabitants of Franconia, part of Bavaria, produce perhaps the finest gingerbread in the country, as well as Nürnberger Rostbratwürstchen (small, spicy roast sausages), and dishes using rare types of fish, such as sheatfish.\n\nSaxony and Thuringia Thüringer Bratwurst, a spicy roasted sausage served with mustard, originates from this east German region, as does Sauerbraten, roast beef marinated in vinegar. Meat is not the only option, however, as Thuringian food is heavily influenced\n\nPilsner, the popular bottomfermented lager\n\nby the wide variety of vegetables grown. Asparagus, cabbage, and cauliflower dishes are also served. Saxony is widely known for its cakes, or Stollen; there are strict requirements which must be met for a cake to be considered an authentic Dresdner Stollen, including where it is made geographically. These cakes are usually served on or around Christmas. Another cake originating in Saxony is Baumkuchen, a multi-layered, pyramidshaped cake covered in a chocolate glaze. Thuringia is more likely to serve Bechkuchen (sheet cakes), such as Streusel-Kuchen, a German crumb cake.\n\nBavaria Much of southeastern Germany’s cuisine is heavily influenced by Eastern Europe, as demonstrated by the goulash dishes and dumplings that regularly feature on the menu. Knödel, for example, are boiled dumplings made in a variety of ways with several types of filling, such as liver, onions, or egg; Semmelknödel are bread-based dumplings with onion and egg, and Leberknödel are liver dumplings. Bavarian food, which the world identifies with Germany,\n\nThe Flavors of Germany 27\n\nAbove left Pretzels garnished with poppy seeds Above center Wine shop on Cremerstrasse, Wetzlar, Hesse Above right Spritzgebaeck, chocolate-dipped biscuits is filling and hearty; beer and pretzels, white sausages, Sauerkraut (dish made with fermented cabbage), and roast pork are fixtures of the traditional Bavarian menu. The Weisswurst (white sausage) has its origins in Munich, where several “rules” were made for its consumption, including not eating it after midnight.\n\nBreads Germany is home to an incredibly large variety of breads, including pretzels, Laugenbrötchen (salty sourdough rolls), Semmel (milkdough rolls), Berliner Landbrot (mild rye breads), Mehrkornbrotchen (mixed grain rolls), and many more. Bakeries are ubiquitous, so freshly-baked bread and rolls are always available, and in many regions, such as Swabia, there’s no meal without bread. German breakfasts consist mainly of different types of bread and toppings such as jam or cheese.\n\nBeer Beer is more than the most popular beverage in Germany – it is a way of life, with many regional specialities and locally produced brews available throughout the country. Bavaria, a major brewing center, is home to brands that are known the world\n\nover for quality and taste, such as Beck’s, Löwenbräu, and Bitburger. Brown ales are popular, particularly in the south, but the most commonly drunk beer is pilsner, a bottom-fermented lager.\n\nWine Germany is renowned for its delicious white wines, particularly those made from the Riesling grape. Among the most highly prized are those from the Rheingau region. Lovers of red wine can try Assmannshausen Spätburgunder, produced from the Pinot Noir grape. German wines are largely categorized into three groups according to their quality: the lowest is Tafelwein, then Qualitätswein, and the highest is Qualitätswein mit Prädikat. The term Trocken indicates a dry wine, Halbtrocken, semi-dry, and Suss, the sweet variety. Excellent sparkling wines known as Sekt, are also produced in Germany.

Lüneburg’s past wealth is evident in the splendid gables that line the streets of its old town. One of the city’s three Gothic churches, the Johanniskirche, has a 354-ft (108-m) high brick steeple that leans more than 6 ft (2 m) from the perpendicular. Built between 1300 and 1370 and restored in 1420, it is considered a major example of north German brick architecture. The city’s most important monument is the Rathaus (Jan– Mar: open Tue–Sat; Apr–Dec: open daily), located in Am Markt. This town hall, parts of which date back to the 13th century, is one of the most architecturally interesting town halls in northern Germany.
