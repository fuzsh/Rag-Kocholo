        "text": "Petra, Angkor, Copan, Venice, Lascaux, Easter Island—all are examples of irreplaceable cultural heritage built in stone and now slowly disappearing. In 1996 the Getty Conservation Institute published Stone Conservation: An Overview of Current Research as a tool for conservators and conservation scientists to guide policy, practice, and research in the preservation of stone in monuments, sculpture, and archaeological sites. This second edition reflects the explosion of new research, enlarging the discussion of preventive conservation and adding new sections on rock art and other subjects. It provides a strategic overview of the intervening fifteen years in stone conservation research and an updated critique of the field’s strengths and weaknesses. The accompanying bibliography summarizes material published between 1995 and 2009 and provides a framework for building a coherent base of useful knowledge for practicing conservators and scientists.\n\nThe loss of cohesion of stone materials, mainly caused by weathering, is a common problem in the conservation of our cultural heritage. When granular disintegration occurs, a consolidation treatment with silicone compounds, specifically ethyl silicate (tetraethoxysilane, TEOS) is often chosen in order to improve cohesion between the material particles. Today there is a wide variety of TEOS-based products available on the market with different compositions and it is not at all clear which product(s) are more appropriate than others for a particular case. This paper describes the results of a laboratory research carried out at KIK-IRPA that aims to better understand the behaviour of eight different ethyl silicate products. The consolidation effect is related to three types of treatment applications, each time based on capillary absorption on two different types of limestone. The influence of product and application type is evaluated in terms of the quantity of absorbed product and amount of deposited gel (SiO2). The consolidation effect is assessed by results of drilling resistance measurements (DRMS) and capillary water absorption. The results demonstrate that a major difference in consolidating effect can be distinguished and that there is a different influence of the product type on the final water absorption capacity. Furthermore a high amount of applied product is not always beneficial to the consolidation effect and reduces the water absorption capacity substantially.\n\nThe ICOMOS International Scientific Committee for Stone (ISCS) started in thè year 2000 to build an Internet Website, including, among other things, a multilingual illustrated glossary on stone deterioration. The committee has screened seven already existing glossaries, or classification systems, gathering terms and definitions in English, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian and French. A cumulated alphabetical list, including all thè terms that can be foUnd in each specific language, has been set up. Available definitions of each temi can be visualised simultaneously in any selected language. It is also possible to get thè translations of thè terms in thè other languages. On thè basis of thè 162 already existing terms in thè English cumulated list,'a new glossary of about 80 terms is being set up. This glossary will be then used as a basis for translating terms and definitions in all thè languages of thè participating countries. Commented illustrations are also available on a simple click, so that one can visualise each terni. It is also planned to use thè glossary as a basis for classification of decay pattems. address: http://www.lrmh.culture.fr/icomos/Site_Web_Icomos/index/index.htm"
