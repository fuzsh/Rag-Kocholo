        "text": "Released: 7 May 1914, Keystone\n\nDirector: Mack Sennett\n\nWriter: Charlie Chaplin\n\nDuration: approx. 6 mins (split reel)\n\nWith: Mack Swain, Phyllis Allen, Mack Sennett, Billy Gilbert\n\nStory: During a military parade a wife (Chaplin in drag) becomes jealous of her husband (Swain) and manages to interrupt the making of a movie…\n\nProduction: If some of the scenario of this split reel trifle sounds familiar, that’s because it is essentially Chaplin’s early movie Kid Auto Races at Venice dragged up, literally so as Chaplin appears dressed as a woman. From the opening moment when Chaplin’s female character tips back on her bench flashing her bloomers it is clear that he’s a pretty poor drag act. As un-ladylike as possible, Chaplin essentially presents his usual Tramp persona, but in a dress (he even seems to be wearing his usual shoes/boots, although the dress was said to have come from Keystone co-star Alice Davenport).\n\nIt is understandable that given he’d made a movie just like this several months before that Chaplin didn’t want to use the Tramp persona in such a throw-away trifle, hence his dragging up. None of the other characters even seem to treat him as a woman anyway. The funniest thing Chaplin does here is an almost ‘can can’ style dance, for no apparent reason before a policeman intervenes and gets a shove in the face for his trouble. This is the first of three film appearances in which Chaplin ‘drags up’, the other two being The Masquerader (August 14, 1914) and A Woman (1915), although in those later appearances there is more of an attempt to portray an actual female character than is bothered with here. It is less of a drag act and more of a panto dame.\n\nShot in Wilmington on April 11, 1914, A Busy Day takes place against the backdrop of a dedication ceremony and parade marking the extension of the harbour of Los Angeles at San Pedro (there’s a nice pan across some impressive ships at one point). The final, rather short item, was released on a split reel (meaning it took up around half of a single reel) with an unrelated educational film called The Morning Papers. It’s another of Mack Sennett’s ‘event movies’ driven by filming in and around an already existing event, giving Keystone great production values for next to no outlay. Sennett himself appears in this one playing the role of the irate film director. The six minutes of this film is filled out with some nice footage of the marching band, but Sennett and company are too keen to fall back on their old reliable of ‘trying to make a film’ as the slender excuse for a ‘story’ (really an unrelated bunch of kicking, slapping, and falling over in the worst Keystone-style).\n\nA Busy Day was once believed to have been a lost film, and while every silent film recovery is welcome, A Busy Day adds little of worth to the overall Chaplin filmography other than cursory interest. Having come up with the scenario here, it seems that Chaplin was hamstrung by having to fit in with the event and the requirements of Keystone, so he has simply fallen back on their usual kind of product, and the whole of A Busy Day is a definite step backwards in terms of his developing command of the cinematic medium. It had long been suspected that Chaplin had directed this one, even though he hadn’t included it on an early list of his first film achievements. Chaplin biographer David Robinson noted: ‘[Chaplin] clearly did not rate it very highly. Certainly it is one of Sennett’s ‘throwaways’, but it is a curiosity for all that.’\n\nSlapstick: A policeman is the first of many to fall over after a kick up the backside, while Chaplin spends much of the film rolling around in the dust in front of the camera as the band march past. When Charlie catches up with Swain there’s much slapping, kicking and hitting, none of it terribly funny. Naturally, there’s a big splash at the finale as Chaplin ends up in the water.\n\nVerdict: Nothing to see here, move along, 1/5\n\nNext: The Fatal Mallet (1 June 1914)\n\nReleased: 4 May 1914, Keystone\n\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\n\nWriter: Charlie Chaplin\n\nDuration: approx. 11 mins\n\nWith: Mack Swain, Alice Davenport, Alice Howell\n\nStory: The Tramp gets in trouble in pursuit of the ladies, leading to sleepwalking shenanigans and balcony baloney…\n\nProduction: Often considered to be Chaplin’s true debut as writer and director, as well as star, Caught in the Rain is a leap forward in quality of production. Gone is the usual slapstick-driven Keystone runaround. Instead, this short features a series of incidents that while played for comic effect actually relate to one another, and are partly driven by character not just plot. This would be the approach Chaplin would pursue in making his own films in future.\n\nCaught in the Rain is the film that Chaplin singled out in his autobiography as being his debut as a creative behind the camera (despite his largely uncredited but important contributions to a couple of shorts before this one). ‘When I started directing my first picture, I was not as confident as I could be,’ admitted the comic in My Autobiography. ‘In fact, I had a slight attack of panic. After [producer Mack] Sennett saw the first day’s work, I was reassured. Caught in the Rain was not a world-beater, but it was funny and quite a success.’\n\nAlthough Chaplin took a different approach to filmmaking than either Sennett or Mabel Normand, he was conservative enough for his first effort to rely on tried-and-tested material he knew he could perform. In creating the film he uses some of the ‘park comedy’ common to many Keystone films, and most recently seen in Twenty Minutes of Love, then a bar-room scene (straight out of his previous effort, Caught in a Cabaret; even the similarities in title are interesting), presented mainly as an excuse for Chaplin to redo his drunk act, which dated back to his vaudeville days. There’s a lovely touch as he appears to pull himself into the bar by his ear, thus overcoming his own resistance. It was a routine he knew he could pull off effortlessly, yet it would always, without fail, crack up an audience whether live in a theatre or in a cinema.\n\nEven the final section recalls a recent Chaplin short: the hotel room mix-up sequences are straight out of the Normand-directed Mabel’s Strange Predicament, and even the Tramp’s ‘predicament’ here recalls that film. However, the interest comes in how Chaplin makes his Tramp, the character of the ‘little fellow’, the driving force for the story. Things happen to him, yes, but it is in how he reacts and attempts to get himself out of the evermore bizarre things that happen to him where the comedy genuinely lies. While Chaplin doesn’t quite resort to the Keystone-style chase-and-fight finale for Caught in the Rain, he does rely upon that old stand-by of the Keystone Cops to wrap things up.\n\nDespite all these echoes of past work, Caught in the Rain is also a film that looks forward, not least to the following year’s A Night Out which revisits much of the material here in a more mature and controlled manner. From this film forward until the end of his Keystone contract at the end of the year, Chaplin would direct virtually every short he appeared in, only giving up the reins for three minor exceptions and the feature-length Tillie’s Punctured Romance which Mack Sennett handled.\n\nThere are other ways in which Caught in the Rain differs from the standard Keystone productions of this period. One of them is in the number of individual shots that make up the movie. Chaplin used here many more cuts than in most of the films he’d appeared in previously, applying all he had learned by studying the working methods of other directors. He’d spent the four months he’d been at Keystone figuring out how films were made and how he could improve upon the methods used. In Caught in the Rain, Chaplin shows an immediate grasp of how to construct a coherent story through editing, rather than through the pantomime acting featured so often in Keystone product.\n\nWhile not appearing to be innovative or out-of-step with the other Keystone releases surrounding it, Chaplin’s first writer-director credit nonetheless proves to be the funniest film he’d appeared in so far, and by far the best-told story of the dozen or so films he’d made up to this point. He relies far less on the use of inter-titles to explain the story: it is so straight-forwardly told visually they are largely unnecessary, and by the frantic final stretch of the film they disappear completely.\n\nIn Mack Swain, Chaplin had found an ideal foil, and he would work with him again many years later in 1921 when he was under contract at First National, appearing in classics such as The Idle Class (1921), Pay Day (1922), and The Pilgrim (1923), as well as playing a larger role in 1925’s The Gold Rush. Alice Davenport returned from Mabel’s Strange Predicament for this film, and proved to be a good ‘straight woman’ to Chaplin’s comedy antics. The entire ‘wrong room’ sequence is a piece of true comic genius, yet there was so much better material yet to come from Chaplin over the next few years. The following scene, in which he’s undressing for the night, is probably the most ‘human’ we’ve seen Chaplin’s Tramp to be so far in the Keystone series. The dizzying pace of events that make up the climax must’ve had audiences rolling the aisles, even if the film doesn’t have a proper ending…\n\nSlapstick: Swain’s irate husband is quick to knock down Chaplin’s Tramp when he’s caught chatting up his wife in the the park, while a near-miss with a speeding car put the Tramp down in the middle of the road. A man whose leg and foot are in plaster in the hotel foyer is an obvious target for some painful slapstick. An attempt by the drunken Tramp to tackle the stairs sees him fall back to Earth, face first, a situation repeated and multiplied when several other participants join him (this is actually a good, simple example of Chaplin mining an easy bit of business to the greatest comic effect, used again in The Floorwalker and One A.M., both 1916).\n\nVerdict: Genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, even after all these years, Chaplin has found his true path at last, 3.5/5\n\nNext: A Busy Day (7 May 1914)\n\nReleased: 27 April 1914, Keystone\n\nDirector: Mabel Normand\n\nWriters: Mabel Normand, Charlie Chaplin\n\nDuration: approx. 22 mins (two reels)\n\nWith: Mabel Normand, Harry McCoy, Chester Conklin, Edgar Kennedy, Minta Durfee\n\nStory: A waiter (Chaplin) takes on the role of a foreign dignitary to impress a girl (Normand), only to be invited to a society garden party…\n\nProduction: Over the final weeks of April and the first few weeks of May 1914, Charlie Chaplin would more-or-less alternate between appearing in standard Keystone efforts churned out by either Mabel Normand or Mack Sennett and movies where he came up with the original scenario and took charge of how it would be staged. In some cases the difference between Chaplin in the regular Keystone shorts and the tentative steps he begins to take controlling his own material are like night and day.\n\nCaught in a Cabaret is very much a bog-standard Normand/Sennett effort, with Chaplin straight-jacketed into playing a Keystone character any number of clowns could fulfil. There is some evidence, though, to suggest that Chaplin was having an effect on the work of those who employed him—remember, he was the ‘new boy’ and had only been at Keystone and even making films for a few months at this stage, although it is likely he didn’t think much of the even-at-this-point cliched pie throwing that features towards the end of Caught in a Cabaret: Mabel gets it in the kisser.\n\nIn his charade as a high-flying foreign dignitary (Baron Doobugle, Prime Minister of Greenland, according to a close up of his business card), it is possible to see some of the seeds of themes and issues that Chaplin would explore in more depth in his later work, such as class difference, something that wasn’t supposed to exist in America but which Chaplin was all too aware of from his lowly London origins. Elements from Caught in a Cabaret would be replayed in much of Chaplin’s later work, including in The Count, The Rink (both 1916), The Idle Class (1921), and in one of his mature films, Modern Times (1936). There’s some business with a dog sidekick in Caught in a Cabaret as well which looks forward to Chaplin’s pooch pals in Champion (1915) and A Dog’s Life (1918), although here his dachshund is little more than another prop. It’s the first film in which Chaplin’s Tramp has a regular job, and features him in various confrontations with his boss (larger than him) and a co-worker (who is much smaller), setting up contrasts of scale that would reoccur in later movies.\n\nChaplin’s clearly in command of his own performance here, and when he’s off-screen he is sorely missed. It’s evident just from the way he walks, puts on his hat and jacket, and the way he tips his hat in the street that he knows his Tramp character inside and out. The waddle as he walks, the skidding around corners, the fading gentility—it is all part of a distinctive character unlike any seen in movies before, and although it would be developed and changed over time, Chaplin had hit upon the basic core of his Tramp character this early in his cinematic work. His hero moment with a mallet where he evicts a surly bar patron is a nice touch, but it feels like it is from a completely different story (The Fatal Mallet, 1914, perhaps?) than the one this movie, as Normand no doubt originally conceived it, is trying to tell.\n\nDone up in a more presentable frock coat and top hat ensemble, Chaplin’s Tramp arrives at Mabel’s garden party, where he is quickly the centre of attention and begins drinking the place dry. A return visit by Mabel and her coterie of debutant friends (engineered by her jealous boyfriend who’d earlier followed him to his workplace) reveals Charlie’s fraud and leads to the riotous climax. It was clear that in working together on Caught in a Cabaret, whatever the dynamics of the power relations within Keystone, that Chaplin and Normand had reached an accommodation with one another. In classic form, the result of all this industry would be a future in which Chaplin would triumph and Normand would fall, as scandals and ill-health plagued her until her early death at the age of 37 in 1930.\n\nSlapstick: A swing door (a consistent inanimate adversary across several films, which he appears to have mastered by the end of this one) and some spilled food gives Charlie the waiter some trouble right at the start, and he (briefly) loses his little dog when he gets tangled up in its lead. There’s plenty of falling about when he sees off a ruffian who is bothering Mabel, while her boyfriend stands by doing nothing. A brick in the face and a slap from Mabel both put Chaplin on the floor at the film’s end.\n\nVerdict: Some interesting moments and further signs of the progress to come, but not exceptional, 3/5\n\nNext: Caught in the Rain (4 May 1914)\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN: A CENTENARY CELEBRATION\n\nAn 80,000 word ebook chronicle of Chaplin’s early films from Keystone (1914) and Essanay (1915), based on the blog postings at Chaplin: Film by Film with 20,000 words of supplemental biographical essays.\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK\n\nReleased: 20 April 1914, Keystone\n\nDirectors: Joseph Maddern, Charlie Chaplin, Mack Sennett\n\nWriter: Charlie Chaplin\n\nDuration: approx. 12 mins (one reel)\n\nWith: Minta Durfee, Edgar Kennedy, Emma Clifton, Chester Conklin\n\nStory: The Tramp is relaxing in the park, envious of those around him enjoying romantic interludes. The theft of a pocket watch allows him to try his own hand at this seduction racket…\n\nProduction: As a tentative beginning for Charlie Chaplin as the controller of his own cinematic destiny, Twenty Minutes of Love is an interestingly safe choice. Not only is it based upon the standard Keystone ‘park’ comedy format, in which a series of incidents occur in a public park, but while Chaplin took full creative control of this one reeler and contributed to the direction, he had Joseph Maddern on hand to make sure things went smoothly—and everything took place under the close (perhaps concerned) supervision of Keystone head Mack Sennett.\n\nAll this was very sensible, with Chaplin taking great precautions to make things easier for himself before taking the reins fully with his next but one short, Caught in the Rain (which Chaplin calls his directorial debut in his autobiography, although in a letter to brother Sydney he referred to Twenty Minutes of Love as ‘my own’, suggesting a sense of authorship). He would use the same basic material about a year later at Essanay when he made In The Park, at a time when Chaplin was recreating better versions of some of his earliest Keystone output.\n\nFormerly a Broadway actor, as a director Maddern was much more willing to bend to Chaplin’s vision than either Henry Lehrman or George Nichols, or his most recent directors, Mable Normand and Mack Sennett (on Mabel at the Wheel). Maddern’s time at Keystone was brief, and in 1914 he was focused on producing educational shorts rather than the studio’s trademark comedies. With Chaplin taking creative charge of the project, it seems to have been Maddern’s job to function as more of a producer than director, making sure everything was done on time, on budget and produced useable footage. Chaplin was given a $25-per-film raise by Sennett for writing and directing, but also offered up a $1500 guarantee to the studio in case his efforts failed to produce a releasable film. He didn’t have to pay up…\n\nChaplin claimed in his autobiography to have shot Twenty Minutes of Love in a single afternoon, and this is entirely plausible as this is how Keystone generally approached these ‘park’ pictures. It all starts innocuously enough, with Chaplin’s Tramp observing the amorous pursuits of several couples in the park. In a lovely touch, he is driven to emulate the ecstasy of a kissing couple, except his partner is the trunk of a large tree. When one woman demands a gift from her would-be suitor (Chester Conklin), he steals a watch to give to her. This allows the Tramp to enter the action directly re-stealing the watch and presenting it to the woman (Emma Clifton) himself.\n\nThe slapstick free-for-all that climaxes the film is standard fare, but throughout there are little touches that clearly came from Chaplin that lift this above the usual Mack Sennett runaround-in-the-park caper, although everyone ends up in the lake, as per usual (with the notable exception of Chaplin’s Tramp and the girl). The film was shot in Westlake Park in Los Angeles, a frequent venue for filmmakers at this time—it’s a wonder that film units weren’t constantly running into each other when out there shooting these ‘quickie’ shorts.\n\nFor probably the first time in the Keystone series, Chaplin’s Tramp is truly the central character in this short. He’s not part of a larger story, it is through him and his antics that we, as the audience, are brought into the film. Playing alternately interested and shy when caught in the girl’s gaze, Chaplin is clearly beginning to give his signature characters more depth than he has previously been allowed—there are the beginnings of a true character here. Unlike his turn as a standard Keystone villain in the previous short (Mabel at the Wheel), Chaplin reverts to the subtlety of movement he was previously starting to display, rather than the florid over-acting personified by the likes of Ford Sterling.\n\nNotably, Twenty Minutes of Love relies far less on inter-titles than most other Chaplin films previously did. The actor seems far happier to rely on his abilities in pantomime to convey the story, which in some of the past films could be hard to grasp, even with the aid of title cards. When confronted by a policeman, Chaplin effectively gets across the notion that the Tramp believes he is about to be arrested, when in fact the policeman is simply admiring the (stolen) watch and wants to know the time. Compare it with the pickpocket’s terribly obvious mime as he plans to steal the watch from the sleeping man on the bench. Chaplin realised that no on-screen text and no over-the-top theatrics were required to communicate his feelings: he does it all himself. It was a sign of things to come.\n\nThere is some interesting ‘hat business’ in this short as well, from the Tramp tipping his hat to a tree he bumps into (treating inanimate objects as though there were alive once more, enacting the idea of ‘transformation’), and puts a crease in the top of his bowler to affect a more sophisticated appearance as he approaches the pickpocket’s girlfriend, hoping to impress. By the end, it is Chaplin’s Tramp that is triumphant, as he’s stolen the picture as well as the young lady’s heart.\n\nSlapstick: Bumped off a bench by an angry suitor (Edgar Kennedy) early on, most of the slapstick mayhem in Twenty Minutes of Love is saved for the climax. Chaplin’s corner-skid is present once more as he runs into the policeman for a second time, and again as he flees from the real owner of the watch. He’s knocked down several times as fights erupt by the lakeside, yet he’s the one who walks away dry (and gets the girl) as everyone else hits the drink.\n\nVerdict: Here it begins, the true start of the proper ‘Chaplin’ shorts, 3/5\n\nNext: Caught in a Cabaret (27 April 1914)\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN: A CENTENARY CELEBRATION\n\nAn 80,000 word ebook chronicle of Chaplin’s early films from Keystone (1914) and Essanay (1915), based on the blog postings at Chaplin: Film by Film with 20,000 words of supplemental biographical essays.\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK\n\nReleased: 18 April 1914, Keystone\n\nDirectors: Mack Sennett, Mabel Normand\n\nWriters: Mabel Normand, Mack Sennett\n\nDuration: Approx. 23 mins\n\nWith: Mabel Normand, Harry McCoy, Chester Conkiln, Mack Sennett, Al St. John\n\nStory: Mabel takes the wheel in a car race after her racing driver boyfriend is kidnapped, and has to contend with the attempts of the villain to thwart her winning style…\n\nProduction: Mabel at the Wheel is an odd throwback production, in so many ways, and very oddly timed just before Chaplin began to seize the reins and start to control his own material. Not only is this not really a ‘Chaplin’ film—it’s one of many in the Keystone Mabel Normand series—but it doesn’t even feature Chaplin as a variation of his by-now rather well established Tramp character. Having been hired as a replacement for Ford Sterling, it is the stereotypical, moustache-twirling Sterling-style villain that Chaplin is playing here.\n\nIt’s the first two-reeler that Chaplin appeared in, so its all the more annoying that he’s so out-of-character. Top-hatted and in a light frock coat Chaplin even has a goatee, so clearly marking out this character from his Tramp. He enters the picture on a motorised bike, only the first of several vehicles featured. It is so odd to see him delivering such an exaggerated performance in the style of Sterling, as for the past few pictures it had been something he’d been reacting against, succeeding in delivering a performance in a more subtle style. Partly this diversion was down to the fact that this was a Mabel Normand picture. Having squabbled with his two previous directors, head of Keystone Mack Sennett thought it would be good to team Chaplin up with the star of the studio, who had creative control over her own pictures.\n\nIn the style of a Pearl White melodrama, Mabel is cast as the ingenue who drives her boyfriend’s car to victory in a race after he is kidnapped by the evil villain, played in over-the-top fashion by Chaplin, and his two henchmen (notably, one of these henchmen is William A. Seiter, later a director of features for Laurel and Hardy and the Marx Brothers). If teaming Chaplin with Normand was supposed to satisfy Chaplin’s cravings to innovate in motion pictures, it failed. He rapidly fell out with Normand as director, just as he had done with George Nichols and Henry Lehrman previously. The fact that Normand was a woman several years younger than Chaplin didn’t help.\n\nAbout six minutes into this so-so slapstick farce comes the footage that makes this film of slightly more historical interest. In the usual Keystone way, Mabel at the Wheel appears to have been built around film of a specific event, the Vanderbilt Cup road race that took place in Santa Monica towards the end of February 1914. It’s a great backdrop for the action (such as it is), definitely a step up from Kid Auto Races. It was also the location where Chaplin reportedly threw a sulk when Mabel wouldn’t let him include a joke in which he stands on a hose, then peers into the dry nozzle, just as he steps off the hose, so soaking himself.\n\nIt’s odd that Chaplin should have taken a stand over this piece of unoriginal business (it’s the archetypal early film joke, first used by the Lumiere Brothers almost 20 years before), but he did, and shooting was abandoned for the day. Perhaps the frustrations of having to imitate Sterling and being forced into such a cliched role as the villain in this picture had pushed Chaplin to breaking point, and his stubbornness over this trivial bit of business was staged to make a point?\n\nHe and those around him assumed that Chaplin’s days at Keystone were numbered, as he’d caused trouble for the boss’s girlfriend and star of the studio. However, Chaplin was as surprised as anyone when Mack Sennett and Normand forgave him the following day—actions that may have been connected to the huge numbers Chaplin’s films were producing at the box office. The orders from the head office in New York were clear: make more Chaplin! Sennett took over from Normand as director, in order to placate Chaplin, who began making representations about wanting to direct himself.\n\nShooting at the Santa Monica races put Chaplin and the rest in the middle of some wonderful backgrounds, from the crowds sitting on the bleachers to Chaplin hanging out in the pit stop area, with the car engineers. Watching closely the faces of some in the crowd, it has to be asked how many may have recognised Chaplin, despite his non-Tramp appearance? The shots of the cars lining up for the race really add great atmosphere to what is otherwise a standard Keystone runaround.\n\nMabel at the Wheel is 1914’s Need For Speed, built around the fad for racing cars and a variety of vehicles and car races. With her driver missing, Mabel herself takes the wheel and wins the race, despite Chaplin’s interference. The race footage stretches out and makes more interesting what is otherwise a rather slight film, certainly in terms of plot or character. The high point comes when Mabel’s car crashes—a scene that looks all too real. As a result of following the Sennett/Normand line on Mabel at the Wheel, Charlie Chaplin won the right to begin directing his own films, truly the start of something big.\n\nSlapstick: Mabel falls off the back of the villain’s motorised bike, right into a huge puddle—the roads of Los Angeles left a lot to be desired back then.

He not only made the switch from child star to adult actor, but also navigated the change from silent cinema to the talkies and, indeed, from appearing before the camera to working behind-the-scenes. As well as starring here with Chaplin (and in other later shorts, as well as an appearance in Tillie’s Punctured Romance), he’d go on to be the first actor to portray the character of Tarzan (as a child, in a 1918 film) and he played Tom Sawyer (in Huckleberry Finn, 1920). He worked as an assistant director in the 1930s and 1940s as the screen roles dried up, then became a producer through to the mid-1950s. His sparky and sly youngster is the catalyst for the drama in The Star Boarder as his ‘picture show’ at the short’s climax feeds the confusion of those watching—he’s the first of Chaplin’s child co-stars, a trend that would culminate in The Kid (1921) with Jackie Coogan.\n\nEdgar Kennedy (who also features in Tillie’s Punctured Romance) is the husband who fears that Chaplin’s lodger is usurping him in his wife’s affections. Like Ford Sterling before him, at this stage Kennedy is firmly wedded to the over-emoting Victorian school of acting that permeated much of early silent cinema. The eccentric moustache he sports only helps to exaggerate his features and grimaces, and he has great fun emoting away and over-signalling his feelings and intentions. Kennedy started as one of the original Keystone Kops and would later go on to star opposite the likes of Laurel and Hardy and the Marx Brothers, making his mark in a series of classic sound films and becoming well-known for his patented ‘slow burn’ reaction to the antics of the clowns he featured beside, as well as for directing a series of two-reel comedies for Hal Roach.\n\nChaplin has great fun here playing the boarder—who is dressed as the Tramp figure, but doesn’t act the same way—who can lord it over the rest due to the attentions of their landlady (Minta Durfee), often pulling faces at others when they fail to get their way or capture her attention. Chaplin once again displays the fleet-of-foot physicality that marked him out from so many of the other screen clowns of this period: the little dance he does when left alone in the pantry and goes looking for something to eat (or rather, drink) is a delightful moment. That’s followed by another outing for his ever-graceful drunk act. His face conveys everything we need to know about his discomfort when he has to sit upon the stolen pie in order to hide it (and the two bottles of beer) from a visiting friend of the landlady.\n\nFor the first time perhaps we see Chaplin playing the most sympathetic role in the picture: gone is the violent tough that the early Tramp appeared to be. Out of everyone in this boarding house, he’s perhaps the least objectionable (even if he helps himself to all the beer and pie he can carry). It’s a trait that future films would build upon and develop, turning the Chaplin character into someone the film audience would root for (in his next short, Mabel at the Wheel, Chaplin would—in dramatic contrast—play the villain). Although directed by Nichols (seemingly with some input from Sennett), this is a slower paced, less frenetic Keystone short and more room is given over to character development by Chaplin, suggesting he was having an effect on his films even when he wasn’t in full control (a state of affairs that’s only a few films off).\n\nSlapstick: The tennis match affords much opportunity for falling over while swinging the racket and failing to hit any balls. A fall from a ladder sees the landlady and the boarder caught by the boy with the camera in yet another compromising situation, if viewed from the ‘right’ angle. Naturally everything ends in the usual Keystone rumble, but Chaplin manages to effectively separate himself and enjoys a personal struggle with the sheet that made up the screen. Finally, a one-on-one tussle with Edgar Kennedy brings the whole thing to an exhausting close.\n\nVerdict: Growing in confidence, Chaplin is beginning to display many of the attributes that would make him the figure we know today, 3/5\n\nNext: Mabel at the Wheel (18 April 1914)\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN: A CENTENARY CELEBRATION\n\nAn 80,000 word ebook chronicle of Chaplin’s early films from Keystone (1914) and Essanay (1915), based on the blog postings at Chaplin: Film by Film with 20,000 words of supplemental biographical essays.\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK\n\nReleased: 26 March 1914, Keystone\n\nDirector: George Nichols, Mack Sennett\n\nWriter: Craig Hutchinson\n\nDuration: approx. 10 mins (one reel)\n\nWith: Edgar Kennedy, Minta Durfee, Alice Davenport, Billy Gilbert\n\nStory: A well-to-do gentleman runs into romantic trouble when his girlfriend discovers him in a clinch with the maid…\n\nProduction: The most obviously notable thing about Cruel, Cruel Love is that Chaplin is not playing the Tramp character. Recalling some of his stage work and even his first released film, Making A Living, Chaplin plays a gentleman, wearing a smarter frock coat, a top hat and sporting a longer moustache than usual. So, why the change?\n\nCruel, Cruel Love is a very different film from the recent releases featuring Chaplin’s Tramp. It’s more of a parody of a D.W. Griffith melodrama, with his gentleman pining for the woman who had left him, contemplating suicide, and envisioning his torment by the pitchforks of some pantomime-looking ‘devils’. There’s a race against time to save Chaplin’s poisoned fool (he’s only taken water, but believes it to have been poison) that only leads to violence upon the realisation of his mistake, and the ultimately expected romantic reconciliation. All in just 10 minutes.\n\nPresumably, Chaplin felt this scenario was so specific in its aims and intentions that he felt his Tramp simply didn’t belong in the melodrama. It also points to his continuing fluidity in these early films: his persona is by no means fixed. Of the nine films released in the first three months of 1914, Chaplin’s Tramp featured (in some form) in six, with Making a Living, Tango Tangles, and Cruel, Cruel Love seeing him trying out different looks and characters. The Tramp features in the overwhelming majority of the remainder of the 36 films released in 1914, but every so often—whether through boredom, experimentation, or to fit better with the scenario—Chaplin abandons his basic look for something else altogether. We’ll be seeing this costume—or a variation of it—again in Mabel at the Wheel (18 April 2014).\n\nThere’s something of Ford Sterling in Chaplin’s exaggerated gestures here, a style of acting he had done much to avoid in earlier shorts, but one which is actually eminently suitable to a spoof melodrama. It’s especially appropriate in the section inter-titled ‘A vision of his destiny’ in which all the hand-waving and face-pulling serves to illustrate his torment. There are certainly some unique Chaplin expressions in this sequence that we don’t often get to see. It’s just a pity that the costumed devils are like something from a school play or Am-Dram production.\n\nThe comedy business with the false poison would be revisited much later in Chaplin’s career in the brilliant Monsieur Verdoux (1947) to much better effect—the late-1940s seemed to be a time when Chaplin was deliberately redoing some of his old Keystone gags in light of everything he’d learned about comedy film craft in the years since then.\n\nCo-starring as Chaplin’s fiancee here is Minta Dufree, a Keystone stalwart and wife of Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle—who’s already been seen opposite Chaplin in A Film Johnnie, Tango Tangles, and Making a Living. Her real name is used to sign the note to ‘Charlie’ explaining that all is well and their engagement is back on. She’ll be showing up quite a bit over the next few months, alongside both Chaplin and Arbuckle. There’s the beginnings of something of a small rep company here that would also frequently include Mabel Normand.\n\nIt’s wonderful to see the pair of dodgy doctors summoned to come to Chaplin’s aid arriving in a horse-drawn carriage, at a time when the transport infrastructure of Los Angeles was a lot more mixed between horse-drawn vehicles, new-fangled automobiles and the tram service (the latter two are seen in the background of some of the doctor’s dash to the house).\n\nIn many respects we should be grateful that we’re even able to see this comedy at all: it was thought to be missing in the 1970s, before a print in very poor condition was found somewhere in Latin America. The existing version, even after restoration, is by-far the most ropey print among these early Chaplin shorts.\n\nSlapstick: There are a couple of tumbles—he manages to get himself entangled in a curtain pulled off a window—but Cruel, Cruel Love is very light on the slapstick front, apart from some energetic leaping about…\n\nVerdict: It’s slight fare, but at least this spoof melodrama offers some variety in Chaplin’s growing persona, 2/5\n\nNext: The Star Boarder (4 April 1914)\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN: A CENTENARY CELEBRATION\n\nAn 80,000 word ebook chronicle of Chaplin’s early films from Keystone (1914) and Essanay (1915), based on the blog postings at Chaplin: Film by Film with 20,000 words of supplemental biographical essays.\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK\n\nReleased: 16 March 1914, Keystone\n\nDirector: George Nichols\n\nWriter: Craig Hutchinson\n\nDuration: approx. 12 mins (one reel)\n\nWith: Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle, Peggy Pearce, Viola Barry, Edgar Kennedy\n\nStory: Charlie likes a drink—it’s his favourite pastime—but it gets in the way of his attempts to woo a young woman…\n\nProduction: Following his drunk act in Tango Tangles, Chaplin was at it again in his very next film, in which it is the focus of the comedy. This is within the flimsy frame of a traditional Keystone comedy, with Chaplin’s character generally making a nuisance of himself. Unlike his previous director, Henry Lehrman, at least George Nichols—who also helmed A Film Johnnie and would directed the next two Chaplin shorts—seemed more willing to allow Chaplin to try out some more sophisticated stuff amid the falling over. The business of the swing door is a little beyond the usual, as is his incredible stunt in which he flips off a staircase, landing sitting up on a sofa still smoking his cigar.\n\nThe saloon door gag was analysed by Gerald Mast in his book, The Comic Mind. It was, he said, ‘the ancestor of every inanimate thing that Charlie later succeeded in bringing to life; he turns a piece of wood into a living opponent. He succeeds in treating one kind of object as if it were a different kind of being… the object is not instantly transposed into something else, but undergoes the complete transformation process before our eyes.’ This ‘transposition of objects’ would become ever more central to Chaplin’s comedy as he gained greater control over his films.\n\nThe girl who is the centre of the Tramp’s affections—he follows her home, and then gets into a fight with her husband—was 18-year-old Peggy Pearce, Chaplin’s then girlfriend, and apparently his first relationship in Hollywood. She lived at home with her parents, and Chaplin—at just 24—didn’t feel ready for a serious relationship culminating in marriage, so their dalliance didn’t last all that long. Pearce did not appear in any further Chaplin shorts. They apparently had fun, though, as the pair won a trophy in a dance contest (Walter Matthau’s wife found the engraved trophy in an antique shop decades later).\n\nAlthough this short features some ‘blackface’ characters (mainly the maid, but also staff in the bar), where whites ‘blacked up’ to play ethnic stereotypes, it was a type of then-common film comedy that Chaplin generally did his best to avoid. His reasons for doing so were political, suggesting that his political sensibilities (that would do so much to get him into difficulties in later life) were formed rather early. ‘I never laugh at their humour,’ said Chaplin, of making African-Americans the subject of the joke. ‘They have suffered too much to be funny to me.’\n\nThere are some lovely old Los Angeles street scenes when the Tramp hitches a lift on a tram to follow the girl’s car home. I always find these glimpse of the city’s lost history fascinating, and although much has dramatically changed in the area (Los Angeles is a city that has always showed little interest in its own history), it is still possible sometimes to match locations from these one hundred year old films precisely. It’s a window on another world.\n\nAs with so many of these shorts, the end when it comes is rather abrupt. There is no climax to the story, no real payoff. The surviving prints of many of these early shorts come from later re-issues which often cut material from the originals. The discrepancy, therefore, might be down to missing material as original reviews of the film mentioned something to do with cheese and Charlie ending up atop a telegraph pole. If you can figure out how the story gets from where we leave it to that reported original ending, let me know!\n\nHis Favourite Pastime is very much of its time, a formless improvisation with very little in the way of a thought out plotline. It’s a series of incidents, but the interesting thing here is the way that Chaplin manages to dominate proceedings. Remember, this is not a ‘Chaplin film’ per se, just another run-of-the-mill Keystone featuring the studio’s newest comic signing. However, instead of his responding to the usual rote Keystone characters, this film turns on their responses to Chaplin’s antics. He quickly dominates whatever improvised scene he is in, and those around him just have to cope. Director Nichols allows this to happen, where previously Lehrman may have been more controlling in an attempt to force Chaplin to conform to the Keystone style. Instead, Chaplin was in the process of bending the Keystone films to his will.\n\nSlapstick: There’s much falling over, as befits a comedy largely set in a bar, but it is in Chaplin’s battle with the bar bathroom swing door that livens things up at about the five minute mark: and he’s on the losing end of that fight. The stairway-to-sofa tumble would have made an effective capper to this picture, but instead we get another unthinking Keystone shoving match. Shame.\n\nVerdict: There’s little improvement here over the previous shorts, 2/5\n\nNext: Cruel, Cruel Love (26 March 1914)\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN: A CENTENARY CELEBRATION\n\nAn 80,000 word ebook chronicle of Chaplin’s early films from Keystone (1914) and Essanay (1915), based on the blog postings at Chaplin: Film by Film with 20,000 words of supplemental biographical essays.\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK\n\nReleased: 9 March 1914, Keystone\n\nDirector: Mack Sennett\n\nWriter: Mack Sennett\n\nDuration: approx. 10 mins (one reel)\n\nWith: Ford Sterling, Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle, Chester Conklin, Minta Durfee\n\nStory: A night out in a dance hall, a few drinks, and a pretty girl… What could go wrong?\n\nProduction: Well, it’s hardly Strictly Come Dancing, is it… Even by Keystone’s lax standards, this is a film particularly lacking in a point. The biggest thing of interest here is the fact that Chaplin appears sans moustache, perhaps indicating that he was still experimenting with the look and character of the Tramp. Although he appears more or less fully-formed in the shorts immediately before this one, perhaps Chaplin still had reservations. In fact, perhaps he’s not playing the Tramp at all, as he appears just a little too well-dressed. The sight of him in Tango Tangles may suggest something of the shock that Mack Sennett suffered when he first saw Chaplin off-stage and out of make-up, as he’d supposed the performer to be an older man.\n\nChaplin had often performed the role of the polite drunk in touring vaudeville shows and with the Karno troupe (as in ‘Mumming Birds’), so that part of his performance here was clearly second nature. Despite his inebriated state, it is Charlie who claims the first dance with the hat-check girl who has attracted not only his attention but that of Ford Sterling’s band leader and Fatty Arbuckle’s clarinettist. Once again, in his awful, obvious, tiresome mugging and exaggeration, Sterling displays what a terrible film comic he was, especially when placed next to the much more natural Chaplin—thankfully this is Sterling’s final film with Chaplin.\n\nTango Tangles was, in fact, shot in a real dance hall—the Venice Dance Hall on Abbott Kinney Pier, although some inserts are clearly shot in studio—filled with real patrons (watch the people in the background to see them genuinely reacting to the mayhem that occurs). More or less improvised on the spot, this typical low-rent Keystone number is exactly the kind of film that Chaplin would soon be reacting against as he took control of his movies. His more sophisticated clowning and considered slapstick is a particularly poor fit with the standard Keystone knockabout nonsense practiced here by Sterling.\n\nThe three principals are wearing their usual street wear and appear without make-up (hence the reason for Chaplin’s non-Tramp appearance), suggesting this was a very spur-of-the-moment enterprise on behalf of Mack Sennett. There are hints here of the more sophisticated comedy to come in such boxing or fight films as The Champion (1915) and City Lights (1931), while Charlie’s drunk act would reappear frequently, most notably in His Favourite Pastime (1914), A Night Out (1915), One A.M. (1916), and Limelight (1952).\n\nWhile Tango Tangles is an unsophisticated little film, it is unique in offering a real-life glimpse of the then just 24-year old Charlie Chaplin immediately before he was consumed by worldwide fame (and later, notoriety).\n\nSlapstick: As soon as he enters, Charlie is tangling with chorus girls and then falling flat on his backside. Later, there’s the usual contretemps between Sterling and Chaplin that sees them both landing on the dance floor. Attempting to put on the same coat sees the pair have a riot in the cloakroom—but Charlie gets in the last punch.\n\nVerdict: Murder on the dance floor, 2/5\n\nNext: His Favourite Pastime (16 March 1914)\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN: A CENTENARY CELEBRATION\n\nAn 80,000 word ebook chronicle of Chaplin’s early films from Keystone (1914) and Essanay (1915), based on the blog postings at Chaplin: Film by Film with 20,000 words of supplemental biographical essays.\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK\n\nReleased: 2 March 1914, Keystone\n\nDirector: George Nichols\n\nWriters: Craig Hutchinson\n\nDuration: Approx. 14 mins (one reel)\n\nWith: Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle, Virginia Kirtley, Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling\n\nStory: The Tramp falls in love with a film actress, so visits the Keystone studio to track her down…\n\nProduction: It was an obvious idea, and a great place to put Chaplin’s Tramp—from the early scenes where he causes havoc in the cinema through to his disruption at the Keystone studio, A Film Johnnie is the perfect vehicle for Chaplin at this early point in his movie career.\n\nFrom retrieving a coin from within an old sock to his ecstatic behaviour when Virginia Kirtley’s ‘Keystone girl’ appears on screen (check out those facial expressions), Chaplin instantly displayed how far advanced he was in terms of screen acting (and re-acting) over the likes of Ford Sterling (who turns up later in this one, doing his usual exaggerated Victorian schtick, the poor man couldn’t even play himself adequately).\n\nVisiting the studio—those arriving in the cars are real Keystone personnel, including Chaplin’s hated erstwhile director Henry Lehrman—the first ‘star’ the Tramp encounters is the rotund Fatty Arbuckle, who promptly gives the poor fella a coin (quickly lost to another wiley employee). Straightening up his attire, the Tramp joins the influx of people through the studio gates…\n\nWhat follows is a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the Keystone studio in action, with Chaplin wandering from place-to-place falling foul of prop men, directors and actors. Cost saving measure this film may have been, but it has preserved a glimpse back in time revealing how a unique workplace functioned almost exactly 100 years ago.\n\nA Film Johnnie (the name refers to fan who used to loiter outside theatre stage doors) can perhaps be read almost as a sequel to Kid Auto Races, with the Tramp’s ambition to star in pictures taken one step further. In fact, this film feels like the first time that the focus has really been on the Tramp as a character in his own right, a sign of where the Keystone Chaplin series would go in the future.\n\nThe difference between screen fiction and reality seems to elude the Tramp as he attempts to rescue a damsel-in-distress, thereby ruining a take, followed by much use of a prop gun. The lighting of a cigarette using the gun which follows is an early instance of Chaplin’s propensity to transform objects through their use into something else entirely.\n\nThen A Film Johnnie goes all meta on us, with a ‘real world’ fire being used to form the climax of the film-within-the-film (as well as the one we’re watching) as Keystone dispatches a camera crew to capture a real (or is that reel?) event—something they often did. As everyone rushes to the scene of the action, we are treated to some lovely shots of Los Angeles in its early days (another example of the propensity of film to turn into a time machine).\n\nWorking with a new director didn’t make Chaplin any happier than when he’d been poorly served by Lehrman, according to Chaplin’s autobiography. Nichols ‘had but one gag which was to take the comedian by the neck and bounce him from one scene to another. I tried to suggest subtler business, but he too would not listen. “We have no time, we have no time!” he would cry. All he wanted was an imitation of Ford Sterling.’\n\nThankfully Chaplin was simply too good to be a poor-man’s Sterling. While at the end of this short, his Tramp clearly indicates he’s had it with the movies, the same was not at all true of Charlie Chaplin. He just needed to become master of his own destiny in order to do his best work and revolutionise film—this instalment was one of the baby steps on that long road.\n\nSlapstick: Ejected from the cinema for hitting too many people with his hat, a flailing Chaplin lands on the sidewalk. Fighting with the director, a plank is wielded and the Tramp ends up on the floor, before being doused by a fire hose.\n\nVerdict: A vast improvement but still not a classic, A Film Johnnie puts the focus firmly on Chaplin’s Tramp. 3/5\n\nNext: Tango Tangles (9 March 1914)\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN: A CENTENARY CELEBRATION\n\nAn 80,000 word ebook chronicle of Chaplin’s early films from Keystone (1914) and Essanay (1915), based on the blog postings at Chaplin: Film by Film with 20,000 words of supplemental biographical essays.\n\nAmazon US | Amazon UK"
