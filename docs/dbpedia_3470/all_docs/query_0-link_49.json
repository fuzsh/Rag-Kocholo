        "text": "This article explores the origins, whitewashing, and eventual fetishization of the “California look”—a body ideal centered on bronzed skin, bleached hair, and bulging muscles, which gained a prominent place within American visual imagery in the second half of the twentieth century. Rather than solely focusing on representations of California bodies in popular culture, as other studies have done, the article locates the origins of the California look in the social history of Los Angeles’ beaches and, in particular, their use as sites of corporeal spectacles. Unlike in Europe and the East Coast, where hygienist justifications for seaside recreation endured, from the early twentieth century onwards Southern California beachgoers set medical concerns aside and focused on having fun, and shaping and parading their bodies. In parallel, consumer capitalism, aided by the rise of the beauty, exercise, and diet industries, transformed these local pursuits of health and fitness into a marketable lifestyle and coherent set of body aesthetics. Despite African-American, Asian, and Latino Angelenos’ continuing engagement with local beach cultures, national and popular culture representations of such trends systematically erased non-white bodies, thereby constructing the California look as a conspicuously white icon.\n\nTwo graphical methods of exploring aspects of cutting structure in film using shot-length data are presented. The first of these converts the cumulative frequencies of shot-lengths to tabular form that can be displayed in various ways, including the use of correspondence analysis. The method is used to investigate the differences in cutting rates used by Mack Sennett and Charlie Chaplin while directing films for the Keystone Company in 1912–14. Results suggest that previous analyses based on the average shot-length may over-simplify the contrast, and some evidence for the evolution of Sennett’s style in 1913 is also suggested. The methods used, like much of the literature, do not take into account the time-series structure of the shot-lengths. In the second approach presented this is allowed for by smoothing the time-series of shot-lengths using non-parametric regression. A computer-intensive way of presenting results graphically is developed, that does not commit the analyst to a particular choice of smoothing level, and is used to investigate an ‘hypothesis’ about D.W. Griffith’s cutting style suggested by a ‘prescription’ for pacing implied in comments made in an article published under his name in the 1920s. It is shown that his major feature films between 1914–21 conform to the prescription, but there is not much evidence for it in his earlier and later work.\n\n\"The work of the Women and the Silent Screen Conferences [...] is to collectively create a new realm of cinema history, neither 'the' history, nor 'a' history, but a strange double world.\" These words are from Jane Gaines in her keynote address for the fifth Women and the Silent Screen Conference, held at the Stockholm University in 2008. This proceedings volume gives a representative picture of the breadth of the conference. The rich and varied contributions address theoretical issues around this double world of \"cinematification\" and feminist historiography, advancing questions on the authorship of pioneering female filmmakers and the role of female stars in early cinema. Other topics explored include transnationalism, the performance of femininity, fandom and fashioning, and branding within the studio system. The diversity of subjects in this volume reveals both the complexity and the problems of the field of research that the Women and the Silent Screen Conferences represent. Not only do these papers deal with well-known, concrete issues within feminist scholarship, but they also consider a more fundamental question: that of the medium as such in its early years, and its conceptualisation within a feminist scholarly framework.\""
