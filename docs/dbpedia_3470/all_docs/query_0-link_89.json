        "text": "In 1926 D.W. Griffith, in 'Pace in the Movies', issued what might be thought of as a 'prescription' for structuring melodramas of the kind for which he was famous. This can be interpreted in terms of the cutting-pattern to be expected. The paper develops a statistical method of investigating cutting-pattern. The 'prescription' would appear to have been applied to his major feature films between 1914 and 1921, but is much less evident in his feature films after this period, of in his earlier work, and shorter films, at Biograph between 1908--1913.\n\nIn film, a ‘cut’ is a transition between two continuous strips of motion picture film, or ‘shots’. These transitions can dissolve one film strip into the next, or be an abrupt stop between the two shots. How cuts have increased in frequency since the beginning of cinema and how their arrangement form structure across groups of shots is the focus of this study. In order to examine this, films were obtained from 3 genres (action, comedy, drama) and 4 years (1945, 1965, 1985, 2005), one film per genre per year. Luminance and color information were digitally sampled and imported into a Matlab-programmed ‘cut detector’ to predict where cuts occurred within the given film. The program detected hard and soft cuts, which were then manually confirmed or rejected. Additionally, ranges of flagged frames were processed to identify missed cuts, resulting in a list of all the frame numbers at which cuts occur in each film. The results show that mean shot length has decreased over the years.Auto-correlation computation of shot length pairs shows that shot pairs are positively correlated, across both variables of genre and year; this reveals that structure is present across groups of shots in the same pattern of shot length sequences. This finding suggests that there is much more structure to narratives and to seemingly intuitively-placed cuts than one may think\n\nStan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were one of the few comedy acts to successfully make the transition from the silent era to sound cinema in the late-1920s. The impact of sound technology on Laurel and Hardy films is analysed by comparing the median shot lengths and the dispersion of shot lengths of silent shorts (n = 12) produced from 1927 to 1929 inclusive, and sound shorts (n = 20) produced from 1929 to 1933, inclusive. The results show that there is a significant difference (U = 56.0, p = 0.0128, PS = 0.2333) between the median shot lengths of the silent films (median = 3.5s [95% CI: 3.2, 3.7]) and those of the sound films (median = 3.9s [95% CI: 3.5, 4.3]); and this represents an increase in shot lengths in the sound films by HLΔ = 0.5s (95% CI: 0.1, 1.1). The comparison of Qn for the silent films (median = 2.4s [95% CI: 2.1, 2.7]) with the sound films (median = 3.0s [95% CI: 2.6, 3.4]) reveals a statistically significant increase is the dispersion of shot lengths (U = 54.5, p = 0.0109, PS = 0.2271) estimated to be HLΔ = 0.6s (95% CI: 0.1, 1.1). Although statistically significant, these differences are smaller than those reported in other quantitative analyses of film style and sound technology, and this may be attributed to Hal Roach’s commitment to pantomime, the working methods of Laurel, Hardy, and their writing/producing team, and the continuity of personnel in Roach’s unit mode of production which did not change substantially with the introduction of sound.\n\nThe impact of sound technology on Hollywood is analysed through looking at the median shot lengths of silent films from the 1920s (n = 54) and early sound films (n = 106). The results show a large increase in the median shot lengths with the introduction of sound (Mann Whitney U = 554.0, Z = -8.33, p = <0.01, PS = 0.0968), estimated to be 2.0s (95% CI: 1.6, 2.4). The dispersion of shot lengths measured using the robust estimator Qn shows a similarly large increase in the dispersion of shot lengths with the transition to sound (Mann Whitney U = 319.0, Z = -9.18, p = <0.01, PS = 0.0557), estimated to be 2.0s (95% CI: 1.7, 2.4).\n\nCutting, Delong and Nothelfer (2010) use statistical methods to investigate the evolution of shot-length patterns in popular film. They argue, using what they call a `modified autoregressive index' (mAR), that patterns are becoming increasingly clustered and also evolving towards 1/f structure, a pattern described in later publication as 'like those that our minds may naturally generate'. This paper shows that the interpretation of the mAR index is wrong. It is also shown that that the results concerning 1/f patterns can be interpreted in an equally plausible and much less 'exciting' way. That is, although there are undoubtedly interesting temporal patterns in the shot length structure, they can't be interpreted in terms of the 'evolution of Hollywood film' in the sense intended in the original paper.\n\nIt is obvious to any seasoned moviegoer that contemporary popular films are different than those of earlier times. We measured 160 English-language films released from 1935 to 2010 and addressed four changes concerning shots, motion, and luminance. Perhaps the most obvious change is that shot lengths have gotten shorter, and others have also documented this trend. Perhaps also apparent is that contemporary films have more motion and movement than those of the Hollywood studio era. Less apparent, however, is the relation between shot lengths and motion. In contemporary films shorter shots also have proportionately more motion than longer shots in the same film, whereas in older films the shots of different length are not dis tinguished by their relative amount of their motion. And finally films have gotten darker. That is, the mean luminance value of frames across the lengths of a film has decreased over time. We discuss psychological effects associated with these four changes, including harnessing viewer attention through narrative pacing and the enhancement of the viewing experience."
