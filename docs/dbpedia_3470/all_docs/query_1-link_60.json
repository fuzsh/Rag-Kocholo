        "text": "Papa Roach Releasing a Song with Country Star Carrie Underwood\n\nPapa Roach and country star Carrie Underwood have teamed up for a new version of “Leave A Light On (Talk Away The Dark)” for an outstanding cause.\n\nThe re-recording is due out on Friday, August 2, and royalties from the track will be donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “Leave A Light On (Talk Away The Dark)” was first released on Papa Roach’s 2022 album Ego Trip.\n\nPapa Roach frontman Jacoby Shaddix said in a statement, “We were humbled that Carrie was open to our mission, and hearing the power of Carrie’s voice in that recording session, we were blown away. Not only is her vocal ability unequaled, but the impact of her voice brings a new meaning to our cause and will help people all over the globe. It’s an honor to have a ‘rock star’ bring life to this track with us.”\n\nUnderwood added in her own statement, “I’m such a huge fan of Jacoby and Papa Roach and was honored to be invited to record ‘Leave A Light On’ with them. It’s a beautiful song, and the message behind it and the band’s mission to shine a light on suicide prevention and mental health awareness has never been more important.”\n\nIf Underwood’s P. Roach fandom takes you by surprise, it really shouldn’t. In October 2023, Underwood and her husband, retired NHL player Mike Fisher, took in Shinedown and Papa Roach’s show at FirstBank Amphitheater in Franklin, Tenn. The husband and wife had the opportunity to go backstage and meet both bands. Papa Roach shared a photo with Underwood along with the caption, “Music City never disappoints – thanks for stopping by @carrieunderwood @mfisher1212.”\n\nShinedown singer Brent Smith shared a video of the meet and took a moment to touch on how much he admires Underwood. He wrote via Instagram, “I honestly had no idea that the INCREDIBLE @carrieunderwood was coming out to our show last night, or that ALL of us in @shinedown were going to get the opportunity to meet her, and her husband @mfisher1212. I held myself together pretty well, but inside I was freaking out with excitement. I have been a fan from the beginning, she is such a force of nature and such an incredible artist, and performer. It was such a huge honor to meet her in person. She is truly amazing.”\n\nIn recent years, Underwood has really leaned into her rock fandom, which has been really cool to see.
