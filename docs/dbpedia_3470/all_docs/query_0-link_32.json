        "text": "No apologies are due for bringing up Charlie Chaplin in these blogs. Two men loomed large in Mabel Normand’s life story – Mack Sennett and Charlie Chaplin. The idea that Mabel was a female Charlie Chaplin is erroneous, but she was, perhaps, a female Mack Sennett. Mack Sennett was the patriarchal figure that was held in awe by his employees. However, he was also a competent schemer, and some of his actions are judged to have verged on the criminal. Mabel took on some of Mack’s attributes, but used her hypnotic personality to win allies, and smooth her professional path. It was into this hall of smoke and mirrors that Charlie Chaplin was decanted in late 1913.\n\nCharlie in Edendale.\n\nChaplin, as many people know, was not an actor, as such. A product of the English Music Hall, he was a gagster, a knockabout comic. The Music Hall in America was virtually non-existent, and the Federal, State and City authorities were very much against these low forms of theatre, with their disgusting acts, relying mainly on cheap innuendo. When Music Hall star Marie Lloyd came to the States in 1913, she was immediately arrested and jailed by the New York authorities, for ‘Moral Turpitude’. This might have worried Chaplin, who wished to stay in the U.S., so when movie men Adam Kessell and Charles Baumann offered him a job with Keystone, he ripped their arms off. Good music hall men were much in demand by the comedy studios, as they carried huge numbers of gags in their heads, and knew which gags would work in a particular situation. Clearly, this saved the wastage of much expensive film, as gags could be thrown in without financial risk.\n\nDrama and Slapstick.\n\nIt was unfortunate that Chaplin came to Keystone in 1913, and not 1912, for the studio was in a state of change. Mack was dreaming of comedy features of an hour-and-a-half in length, while his star-of-stars, the inimitable Mabel, wished to make more dramatic films, with solid story lines. Chaplin had seen the Keystones, and he was under the impression that he could fall straight into the slapstick, and, perhaps, even steal the limelight. He might even snatch the, oh so pretty, Keystone Girl for himself. However, he was in for a shock when he first met Mack and Mabel outside a Los Angeles theatre. Mack was far from friendly, and Mabel seemed distant and ambivalent. They went to a restaurant for a meal, where Mack revealed his reservations about Chas. Although Mack said that Charlie appeared too young, he did not make known his true reasons for thinking him too young. Mack was shrewd and had kept Mabel in a kind of bubble, in which she was surrounded by men that were either married or quadragenarians plus.\n\nGreatly alarmed was the crafty Mack, when he perceived some chemistry between his young star, and the equally young vaudevillian. Mabel remained relatively quiet during the dinner, but she was someone that wore her heart on her sleeve, and the signals were obvious. Following the dinner, Mack went back to his hotel, wired his New York bosses, and demanded that Chaplin’s contract be rescinded. Meanwhile, Mabel went home, and dreamed of Burlington Charlie from Bow. The only person in Hollywood, who’d seen Chas in real life before that day, was Mary Pickford, and he’d had her and her friends swooning over his bohemian poet appearance, as actresses are wont to do. She undoubtedly reported this sighting to Mabel and, perhaps, to Mack as well. What was going through Mabel’s mind that night? Apart from falling head over heels for Charlie, she probably imagined she could use him to further her career, as she’d used Sennett in the past. If this does not make complete sense today, it made complete sense in Edwardian America, where a woman had to be carried along by a man. The girls at Biograph, on the advice of their stage mothers, put their trust in the studio’s D.W. Griffith, while Mabel took a slightly different route, and put her life in the hands of Mack Sennett. Mabel was a rarity at Biograph, in that she steadfastly refused to change her name, while others changed to Blanche Sweet, Mary Pickford and Bessie Love. Of course, ‘Mabel’ was acceptable enough, and Edwardians knew that it was Latin for ‘loveable’, but Normand, although French, has an air of the un-exotic Anglo-Saxon about it. It is curious, then, that she did not take a fully French name, like Rennee Adoree, which was then still available. Adoree, like Mabel, meaning ‘(be) loved child’ and Renee something similar to ‘reborn’.\n\nThus, it came to pass that Hollywood’s greatest star, and the first actress to have her name over a studio, had a very bland and ordinary name. Possibly, Mack had advised her not to listen to Griffith, and may have encouraged her baiting of and irreverence towards the ‘Genius’. Pertinent to the story of Mack and Mabel, is the fact that the other girls at Biograph pleaded with her not to depart for Los Angeles with “that Irish madman.” This might have been sheer selfishness, as no-one wanted to lose the girl from Staten Island, who was the only actress that had stood firm against the tyrant Griffith. However, they could not be blamed for thinking that things could turn out very bad indeed for their friend. In Mabel’s mind, she was making a smart move, and believed in Sennett’s statement that he would make her a star. And he did, in double-quick time. While the Biograph girls were floundering around, and making wrong moves (as Mary Pickford did) Mabel straight-lined to the top, and found herself competing, not against movie people, but the greatest theatrical stars of the age.\n\nBack at the Keystone Studio, Chaplin had arrived, but he was a very worried man. It was clear Sennett hated his guts, and following on from the latest Mack and Mabel film, in which Mack hunted down a tin-type that had run off with Mabel, he could be shot, and, of course, Charlie was there, apart from anything else, to lay insolent hands on Sennett’s star. When Chas eventually dared to enter the lot, he was kept hanging around without a role for four weeks. During this time, he saw little of Mabel, who was kept away from the limey, then both Mack and Mabel were away on location, making Cohen Saves the Flag and parts of other films. Much of this film was made out at Thomas Ince’s studio in Santa Monica, and presumably made use of Ince’s telephone to contact Keystone, with a view to giving Chaplin his marching orders.\n\nOn Sennett’s return, Chaplin was put to work with Henri Lehrman and George Nichols to do a few lacklustre films. Again, he only saw Mabel briefly, and, sometime in February, he saw her on a hotel set in her pajamas banging on a door shouting “Let me in!” Chaplin, for obvious reasons, got very close to the set, wearing a Mack Sennett-like hobo outfit, which he was going to use in a shoot out at Venice. At this point, Sennett called Chaplin onto the set to try a few gags – which is what he was paid for. Now, it would have been interesting to have been a fly on the wall at that shoot, for Mabel’s face would have been a picture. There is no doubt that this film was to be the first of a series in which she would step out as a dramatic artist. The clue is the costume she wears, which is not Edwardian, but historical, and dates back to the mid-19th century, or a little earlier.\n\nHowever, Charlie did a good turn on the floor, and after a pat on the back, Charlie was off to Venice to shoot Kid Auto Races At Venice. Shooting at Keystone continued, but not very successfully, and it seems Mabel’s attempt at dramatic comedy did not please Sennett. Mabel would have been distraught, as it seemed now that she’d given up a promising dramatic career for mere stardom. Sure, she was the darling of her Hollywood friends, but none of them would have wanted to ridicule themselves in slapstick comedy. On Chaplin’s return, the plot was rearranged to include the limey, who was needed to gag the whole thing up. Mabel, naturally, was as delightful as ever, but another dynamic was needed. Mabel’s screen boyfriend, Harry McCoy, simply would not do. The rejigging of scenes, led to discrepancies in the finished product, which can still be seen today. Clearly, the Chaplin scenes were inserted among those already finished. The completed film was very good, and Charlie complemented Mabel better than could have been imagined. Unfortunately, the excreta would have hit the fan, when the film was first shown. Although Mabel had seen the rushes, it probably came as a shock, when she saw the film in a downtown theatre with some of her friends. The first scene came on, with Charlie and Mabel in a hotel lobby together. Then Mabel left, and Charlie had 40 seconds of the first scene to himself, and this was bad news, as she’d been made a fool of in front of her friends – her name was in the title but she did not get the first scene. This would explain why Mabel and Charlie did not appear together for two months.\n\nThere seems little doubt that Chaplin’s first scene heroics were due to the intervention of NYMPs Kessell and Baumann, who seem to have foreseen trouble, when they dictated that Charlie be in the dramatic comedy Mabel At The Wheel. Charlie Baumann was in L.A. on business, as shooting began on the film, and he’d wisely sent daughter, Ada, along as an ‘extra’. Mabel had been given as much free reign on the contents of the picture, as Mack would allow. She would direct, as she wanted a film, which followed a strict story-line. The background to the film was that of the emancipated woman, a theme that Sennett had built his and Mabel’s reputation on. It is worth reflecting here, upon the general situation in the movie industry at that time. Directors, like southern gentleman D.W. Griffith, hired actresses to beautify his pictures, and he portrayed them as helpless, mindless creatures that needed a man to support them. When Lillian Gish risked her life out on the floating ice in Way Down East it was, significantly, a man that heroically rescued her. This was not the kind of scenario that Mack and Mabel wanted to use, and, indeed, Mabel showed genius Griffith, that wife-beater and serial chucker of actresses, nothing but contempt (much to the amusement of the other girls).\n\nConsequently, when the egotistical and misogynistic Chaplin walked on the set, he was shocked to see Mabel behind the camera, and giving the orders. When he tried to suggest some funny business, to gag the movie up, he was told to “shut it”. Then she said those immortal words “This is not a film about being funny with a hose!” She was right, this was a film about a girl, and a pretty one, who takes the men on in an arduous 200-mile car race in Santa Monica, and wins. Charlie had no option but to comply, as standing behind Mabel were a host of burly labourers, carpenters and set-shifters, who would have loved to alter Mr. ‘Big-Head Chaplin’s physiognomy.\n\nThis was the essence of Mabel’s success – she could carry everyone on the lot with her, and was not afraid to back the workers against the big-bad producer. Her popularity, however, would work against her as a director. A director has no friends, has to shout and bawl, and crush egos underfoot. Could she really stamp on her friends, those that had raised her to such dizzy heights? In any event, when Baumann heard that shooting had been held up, he read the riot act, ordered that Charlie get off his high horse, and that Mabel to include some of his gags, however much she hated and despised them. It seems clear that the account Chaplin gave in his autobiography, of Mack and Mabel keeling over and handing him directorship is total egotistical nonsense. Chaplin was firmly in his place, was not permitted to wear the tramp’s costume, and had no influence on the story-line of the film, but he could suggest gags, which might, or might not, be accepted by the director (Mabel).\n\nFollowing the Mabel At The Wheel debacle, Charlie was allowed to don his tramp’s outfit, and suggestions (or perhaps orders) came from New York that Chaplin, who was, by no means, an actor of any kind, be given every help to understand the movie business. Mack Sennett would not do this, but Mabel volunteered to take Charlie under her wing. Thus, it came to pass that Charlie was a constant visitor to Mabel’s dressing room, resplendent with its lovely garden. This was most gracious of the Queen of Keystone, but Mabel had an ulterior motive. If she could mould Charlie in her image, and make him see things her way, perhaps they could break out of Jailhouse Keystone, and make Hollywood their playground. Mabel had not started on an equal footing with Mack, and, although she just about worked herself to death, she held no stake in the studio, but she could start all over with Charlie on equal terms.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Mabel realized that, with Charlie, she was looking at a mirror image of herself. Charlie was self-centred, shy, rather peculiar, and spoke little. This was the Mabel of five years back, but she’d fought against her difficulties, and become the toast of Biograph studios, for whom anyone would die. Charlie was very rough around the edges, and had not been popular at his old Karno Company, so it was hardly surprising that the unwashed limey was not popular at Keystone. In fact, it is said that some members of the company, including Mabel, would waylay Charlie, and throw buckets of water over him, in the hope he would get the idea, and take a bath. He never did, and Minta Arbuckle recorded later that Chas was “Plenty dirty.” However, Mabel began to coach Charlie in the art of ‘getting along’.\n\nMabel had needed to pay attention to the way that she related to others, and it is likely that she suffered from a manic form of depression, while Charlie seems to have suffered likewise. At this distance in time, it is impossible to discover the underlying causes, but Mabel showed signs of Autism and ADHD. As for Charlie, he appears to have been bi-polar, and Stan Laurel (who was Charlie’s roommate for longer than most of his wives) was convinced he was “insane”. Contrary to what many people think, Charlie did not have a ‘cockney accent’ at this point – he had, in fact, developed a kind of aristocratic, Cavendish Square way of speaking. Unfortunately, his high-handed manner and attitude did not match the accent, and socially he was an outsider. Mabel, for her part, is said to have had a Brooklyn accent, slightly coloured by a smattering of ‘Bronx’. Unsurprisingly, and in very quick time, she began to adopt Charlie’s upper-crust mode of speaking, but never ‘lorded it’ over her colleagues. By 1924 the press could report that Mabel was a fully paid-up member of the ‘Cavendish set’.\n\nPrior to Mabel At The Wheel, Charlie had appeared in several reasonably good films, in one of which Mabel appeared in cameo, as a face on a Keystone poster. In these films, he was put with several attractive leading ladies. Chas began to get romantically involved with one of these, Peggy Pearce, but soon Mabel was ready to strike, and took Chas on board for a leading part in Caught in A Cabaret. For his previous film Twenty Minutes of Love Charlie had been allowed to direct, but this one was a Mabel film, and she was directing. In this film Mabel played a rare part as a debutante, while Charlie played a lowly waiter with aspirations of being the Prime Minister of Greenland, as his calling card clearly said. Mabel was ravishingly beautiful in the picture, and the audience was clearly conned into believing she and Charlie were an item.\n\nIn all probability this was what Mabel intended, and it was about this time that Peggy Pearce disappeared out of Chaplin’s life, and, soon after, out of Keystone. It is not clear if Mabel was somehow behind this, but it is true to say that no-one messed with ‘The Keystone Girl’ so there is a suspicion that Mabel was involved somehow. Chaplin, however, had had a pick of beauties for Caught in The Rain, like Peggy Page and the buxom Alice Howell. However, he did his bedroom scene with the 50 year-old Alice Davenport (mother of Dorothy) who was probably not the apple of his eye.\n\nIt appears that Mack Sennett called Mabel and Charlie together for The Fatal Mallet, which was not a film that Mabel really wanted to do at that point. Although hilariously funny, it consisted mainly of Charlie and Mabel getting kicked in the rear, and assorted actors being hit over their heads with mallets. Chaplin is credited as director of this film, which is not terribly clever, and clearly demonstrates that Chaplin was deep in his ‘knockabout’ period. It must be assumed that it was Chaplin’s idea that Mabel appear happy with being fondled by an 8 year-old boy. When Charlie gets upset with his miniscule competitor’s challenge for Mabel’s affections, he drop-kicks the kid and sends him sprawling. This was Charlie’s modus operandum at that time. The eagle eyed might have notice that the letters I.W.W. were scrawled on a shed, indicating, perhaps, that it functioned as a local headquarters for the Industrial Workers of The World, a socialist organization that worried governments all over the world. Charlie, Mack and Mabel were staunch socialists (if not anarchists), although Mack later turned traitor and went over to ‘the other side’.\n\nBeyond Fatal Mallet, there was Mabel’s Busy Day, which can be seen as part of Mabel’s new wave movie experiment. Chaplin was joint director, but he must have been surprised at Mabel’s insistence on introducing a high level of dramatic tragedy into the script. The limey probably learned, for the first time, that Mabel was a Griffith-trained dramatic actress and tragedienne (the best there was, according to Mary Pickford). He also discovered that Mabel had trained for comedy under none other than the great John Bunny and Flora Finch. The shock to Chaplin was certainly palpable, and he came to realize that Mabel was not the ‘dumb broad’ from the Lower East Side, he’d previously supposed. Mabel, when she’d previously played tragic parts (designed to draw attention to social injustice) had usually played a domestic skivvy, or ‘slavey’. In this film we see Mabel as a street vending girl, or coster-girl, as Charlie would have said. As we know Mabel had spent a lot of time walking around the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and the type of girl she played in the film was well known to her. She described the vending girl, as a poor, tragic figure, but one who (in the ‘coster’ tradition) was brimming with confidence, although her clothes were tattered and her leg of mutton-sleeved bodice and pompous hat were cast offs from 30 years earlier.\n\nFor footwear, she wears enormous shoes, of a type that would make any tramp green with envy. They would also, probably, have turned Chaplin green with envy, and we must here consider whether she stole the idea from Chaplin. If she did not, then we are left with the idea that Mabel created Chaplin’s tramp character that carried him to fame and fortune. Ridiculous? Not really, because when Chaplin came to Keystone, he did not have a character that he could effectively transfer to films. Other Keystoners had developed strong characters. Ford Sterling was the mad Dutchman, who gabbled crazily in double Dutch mime, Mack Swain was the scary, bug-eyed, but soft-centred giant. Harry McCoy drew the short straw, so to speak, and played the bland lower middle-class nerd. Chaplin had nothing except the drunk, who was not really a perennial character. Behind the scenes, Mack Sennett and his subordinates were scrabbling to give the limey a character, not because they wanted to, but because New York insisted.\n\nOn the day of shooting Mabel’s Strange Predicament, did Mabel advise the new boy to take on Sennett’s hobo-like character, but anglicised by the addition of the boots of an English tramp? (Footnote). One suspects that Mack and Mabel had more to do with the tramp than is usually supposed. The film Mabel’s Busy Day was met with outrage by the critical press. They got all hot and bothered about the excessive violence (women kicked in the rear, men punched, police officers assaulted / ridiculed, and a mad woman running around with a big knife. We’ve seen that Mabel introduced tragedy and melancholy into the film, so why the violence? It is likely that Sennett introduced excessive violence, in order to balance out the sad stuff. Mabel was wrong, you could not have a huge amount of melancholy in a comedy.\n\nWas Chaplin now being drawn, like so many others, into the black widow’s web? Undoubtedly he was, but, while Chaplin received help to immerse himself in the movies, Mabel gained moral support from someone, not so much allied to Sennett, but to the big, important bosses back east. This was crucial to Mabel, for her future career development. The evidence suggests that Kessell and Baumann dearly wanted Mabel at their studio, but for contractual reasons, Mack had complete control of his Keystone Girl. Poor old Charlie was in a strange predicament, floating in the ether, between Mack and NYMP, only being pulled to earth by little girl Mabel. It is highly likely that Charlie was aware of his descent into Mabel’s sticky web, but the advantages were clear – Mabel fought his corner against Sennett, Mabel arranged his pay rises, Mabel brought Charlie to Hollywood society, Mabel did everything except wipe his backside (perhaps).\n\nImmediately following Mabel’s Busy Day, Mabel and Charlie began Mabel’s Married Life, replete with melancholy on the part of Mabel. The sadness comes from Mabel being hitched to a totally useless Charlie, so useless in fact, that, whenever the pair walk in the park, the local toughs kick his hide around. Eventually, Mabel storms off from the park, but buys a rocking punch bag, that looks like Charlie’s main assailant. Back home, she thinks about her hopeless husband, and imitates his shuffling tramp walk. She then, slips into her pajamas, which no doubt delighted her audience. To keep it brief, the rest of the film is just crazy slapstick, revolving around the punch bag, with Mabel unable to provide much melancholy, although there is a little titillating stuff, where Mabel gets caught in her pajamas by two delivery men, and Mabel does a wiggling walk in her jim-jams.\n\nMoving on, there followed four films, in which Mabel did not appear with Charlie. Probably greatly annoyed, Mabel grabbed a cameo part in The Masquerader, although Chaplin might have asked for this. However, five films followed, in which Mabel played no part. One can imagine that tensions built up within Mabel, as she saw the tramp take on leading ladies like Cecile Arnold, Dixie Chene, and Peggy Page. None of these got closer to Charlie than Peggy Page, and, if Mabel had done her homework, she’d have realized that Peggy hailed from a notorious family of gold-diggers, the Carruthers gang, and her mother and sister were constantly around the studio. One person associated with this family had already died under mysterious circumstances in Texas, so Mabel had to take extreme care. Mabel, of course, was the fearless high diver and rider of bucking broncos, so a gold-digger with a pistol, held no real terrors for her. Mabel took the female lead in Gentlemen of Nerve, a racetrack film, which was right up Mabel’s street, she being, of course, the lover of race car drivers Earl Cooper and ‘Terrible’ Teddy Tetzlaff.\n\nPeggy Page (who has been identified as Helen or Gladys Carruthers) was most annoyed at Mabel taking the lead. Sitting in the stands as an extra, she is very displeased that Mabel is all over Charlie, and fluttering those two-inch long eyelashes at him. Unusually Mabel is carrying a small box-like ‘fashion’ bag. Could there have been a small calibre pistol within? Mabel skips Chaplin’s His Musical Career, but returns for His Trysting Place, where she supplies some melancholy in the form of a harrassed wife. Both Charlie and Mabel are then thrown into the big feature film Tillies Punctured Romance in which Charlie, deprived of his tramp’s uniform, appears much shrunken and uncomfortable between Mabel and Marie Dressler.\n\nMabel, however, excels, and, for the first time, plays a girl of her own age, and a crook’s moll to boot. This film much unsettled Charlie, who later said of the movie “It had little merit.” It may have had little merit, but reviewers of the film wrote that audiences went crazy when Mabel finally appeared, walking into camera view through a garden gate. Mabel did not appear in the first part of the film, and we might suspect this was a contrivance of Mack, and, possibly, Mabel to knock the steam out of Charlie and Marie. In spite of what Mack later said, he wasn’t directly responsible for bringing Charlie or Marie to the movies. That was done by Kessell and Baumann – Mack hated vaudevillians with a vengeance.\n\nIf Charlie thought he could escape Mabel, he was wrong. In Getting Acquainted, he again played male lead to Mabel, who did the clever stuff, while Charlie got into the slapstick. Basically, the film was about naughty husbands, Charlie and Mack Swain, who run amok in a park. It is notable for Chas and Mabel getting a bit risque, when Chas lifts Mabel’s skirts to knee level. Somehow, Mack let this through, although, normally, he would not permit the Keystone Girl to be so exposed. We might read this, as Charlie and Mabel giving Mack ‘the finger’. So far so good, as far as Mabel was concerned, but she graciously moved aside for Peggy Page in the next film, His Prehistoric Past. The film involved the wearing of a career-destroying grass skirt, so perhaps Mabel was not so gracious after all. No more was heard of Peggy (or Helen/ Gladys) until she turned up in a Portland hospital having, allegedly, swallowed bichloride of mercury. Less than ten years later she tumbled from the 5th floor window of a New York hotel. She’d apparently gained the title of Baroness by that time – now that’s gold-digging!\n\nWith the completion of His Prehistoric Past, Charlie began packing his bags, and after a final dinner with Mabel, at which many tears were shed, the tramp was gone, not to Hollywood, but to Chicago, 2,000 miles away.\n\nA Study in Manipulation.\n\nMabel, as we have seen, was a master of manipulation. Her astonishing rise to the top, within the embryo motion picture industry, was due, partly, to her ability to carry everyone with her. She’d captured hearts and minds and minds at Biograph, made everyone love her, but when she went to Vitagraph, her ego began to expand exponentially, giving her the idea that she was untouchable. Consequently, she became very, let’s say, delinquent, but when she began exposing herself at the windows she was fired by the management. Her friends might have found it a giggle – her paymasters did not. A few hours at Reliance ended in dismissal for ‘unacceptable behaviour’. Returning to Biograph, she was older and shrewder, if not a little bolder. She now knew what she could and couldn’t get away with, and she promoted herself as a wild child, but one that was god-fearing and wholesome by nature.\n\nShe threw her lot in with Mack Sennett, while other actresses clamoured to climb onto D.W. Griffth’s casting couch (and if they didn’t their stage-mothers threw them on). Mabel did not ignore ‘the genius’, she sassed and ridiculed ‘old hook-nose’ as she called him. Although Sennett was a svengali-like figure, it is likely Mabel manipulated him for her own purposes. She intended to rocket to the top, and Mack would help her. Thus, it came to pass that, by 1914, they were the biggest couple in Hollywood. There were, however, problems, mostly due to Mabel considering herself a partner in the business, but suddenly realizing she was just an employee. She’d concentrated on being a star, but now understood that this was not enough. Chaplin had understood, and now he’d gone on to pursue wider horizons. Why was Chaplin able to move on, as actor / director / producer, after just one year in the movies? The answer, of course, is that Chaplin was a man, and, therefore, acceptable to the producer society that controlled the industry. More specifically, he was a man that could have given Mabel a route out of the rat-trap that was Keystone. There is no doubt that Mabel felt betrayed, after all the help she’d given Charlie, he’d dumped her – without ceremony.\n\nWe do now need to consider Chaplin’s point of view. In his autobiography he says that he did not want to leave Keystone, even for more money. Why should he leave, when he had the attentions of the most desirable girl in the world, who, furthermore, spoon-fed him, and even arranged his pay rises? There are two answers. Firstly, Charlie felt smothered by Mabel (as Mack smothered her) and, alongside her, he looked curiously shrunken, and irrelevant. If he took her with him he’d be a mere foil to Mabel. The second point is that, from Mack’s point of view, Chaplin WAS leaving, if not of his own accord, then at the point of a gun barrel. Kessell and Baumann had authorized Sennett to make an offer of $1,000 a week to Chaplin, but Sennett made the contract so convoluted that Chaplin had no option but to turn it down.\n\nWhen Chaplin left, Mabel was furious, but blamed Mack more than Charlie, who had now escaped Mabel’s wrath by making sure he went out of L.A., indeed, out of California all together. This threw some other actresses that tried to follow him, and they went, in error, to Essanay, Niles, instead of Essanay, Chicago. Mabel really blew up, when Charlie (after trying Gloria Swanson), engaged a non-acting college girl, called Edna Purviance, to be his permanent leading lady. Edna was in HER place! Of course, Charlie inevitably returned to L.A. and here his problems really began. Whenever Charlie was out in a restaurant, or other public place, Mabel would stand up, point to him, and shout “Charlie! I’ll be your leading lady yet!” Naturally, everyone present would fall about laughing – Chaplin had few, if any, friends in the movie colony, while Mabel was universally adored, and could get away with anything. In any event, Mabel kept Charlie close, and when he married her new friend Mildred Harris, Mabel just waltzed into their life, without a ‘by your leave’. There were always Mabel parties to attend, including one snowballing party atop of Mount Lowe. It seems Mabel had instructed Charlie well, in the art of socializing, for they often formed a comedy duet to keep folks jolly at parties. There is a story that Charlie once met Mabel in the strongroom of a bank, where they both had safe deposit boxes. Charlie is said to have told Mabel:\n\n“Mabel, I’ve made several thousand dollars, and I owe it all to you. If you ever need any of of it, just shout and I’ll come running.”\n\nThings ran this way for many years, with Chaplin constantly aware of his treachery, but unable to make his peace with Mabel. When Mabel ran into big trouble and health troubles at Goldwyn, Charlie stepped in and declared that Mabel had to been sent back to Sennett, and this was done. In the general run of things, Charlie and Mabel often saw each other, even after he’d joined the ‘Fairbanks Set’. However, Mabel could not forget the way Charlie had thrown her over, and, in 1924, she had her revenge, when Mabel’s chauffeur, using Mabel’s gun, shot the millionaire boyfriend of Charlie’s star, Edna Purviance. Edna, whose career was just about over, was left high and dry.\n\nIt was a closely guarded secret in Hollywood that Mabel had been behind Chaplin’s success. One Tinseltown wag said this about Chaplin:\n\n“They say people sat at his feet, whereas, in reality, he went where people were already sitting down, and stood in front of them.”\n\nThis was reported by his ex-lover, Louise Brooks, who, naturally, could find no fault with the philandering limey.\n\nCharlie and Mabel drifted apart as Hollywood became more ‘cliquey’ although the press and public never forgot the Keystone Girl and her Tramp. At a premiere in 1928, the press had their last opportunity to photograph the pair for posterity. Within a year, Mabel had entered a sanatorium, where she died three months later. The whole of Hollywood was distraught, and especially Charlie. There was no opportunity to make it up with Mabel now, all he could do was help bear his Keystone Girl to her grave, and make numerous heart-felt eulogies in her memory:\n\n“She knew more about comedy than any of us will ever know”\n\n“When I first knew Mabel sixteen years ago, she was already suffering from tuberculosis, but so great was her spirit that she tossed aside her difficulties, with a gay indifference.”\n\nFollowing Mabel’s death, Chaplin never used a blond in his films again, and he married two of them. Pure coincidence of course, but then……"
