        "text": "We live in a time of incredible innovation, major advances in technology, and, of course, some very cool gadgets. From AI smart devices to genius tools that can be carried on you at all times, all manner of once unthinkable tech is now available to the masses.\n\nYou can pick up anything from incredible wireless speakers to hydration biosensors and everything in between. We are living in a golden age of gadgets and tech but it can be difficult to know what is the best of the best.\n\nTo make your life easier, we’ve done the research so you don’t have to. Here are our picks for the best gadgets and new tech money can buy in 2024.\n\nXGIMI MoGo 2 Pro\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£529), Peter Tyson (£529), AV.com (£529)\n\nXGIMI MoGo 2 Pro really is an incredible gadget. Boasting amazing sound quality, great visuals and all the capabilities of your typical high-quality smart TV, this projector is great for levelling up your movie nights, or even functioning in the place of a TV if you don't want a traditional setup.\n\nAs this projector is designed to be portable, you can move it anywhere you please without worrying that it's not robust enough. Its easy-to-use keystone functions mean you can program the screen up to fit your new space in a matter of seconds, and it also focuses on its own, so you always get a crisp picture. Put simply, we love it.\n\nBeats Studio Buds +\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£169), Very (£159.99), AO (£169)\n\nPromising crystal clear sound and up to 36 hours of battery life (nine hours from the earbuds themselves and 27 hours from the included charging case), the Beats Studio Buds wireless earphones are a cool gadget.\n\nMicrophones in the Studio Buds ensure that you can not only listen to clear and bassy music without dangling cables but also take calls. With one-touch pairing to Apple devices and Android you can easily set up a Find My account for the earbuds to help find them if they’ve gone missing.\n\nBest yet, the Beats Studio Buds are available in three colours, including transparent (which is super cool) and come with four sizes of ear tip options so you can personalise your fit to match your ears.\n\nCanon Powershot V10\n\nBuy now from Canon (£429.99), Amazon (£439.99)\n\nIf you’re looking to grow your YouTube channel and upgrade to 4K, the Canon Powershot V10 could be the camera for you.\n\nThis pocket-sized powerhouse is light, weighing just 211g, and is capable of filming in a wide-angle 19mm format in 4K UHD CMOS (55 minutes of shooting time). It has stereo microphones built-in with electronic wind shielding (and comes with cute miniature physical windshields), a retractable screen and stand, and more.\n\nDue to its small build, you can take it just about anywhere with you for whenever inspiration strikes.\n\nPhillips Signe Gradient Floor Lamp\n\nBuy now from AO (£279), Amazon (£279), Phillips (£279.99), Argos (£279.99)\n\nIf you’re on the lookout for a new light fixture, the Philips Signe floor lamp could just be the one you’ve been searching for. Owing to its minimal design and use of fully controllable gradient lighting, the Signe gradient floor lamp is a cool bit of kit.\n\nBy using the Hue app, voice commands, or smart accessories. you can control the gradient lamp and tell it which colours to use along its line of lights. You can blend colours for natural looks, go for something moody and dramatic, and even set dynamic scenes that move slowly through a light cycle to create whatever effect you’d like.\n\nOoni Volt 12\n\nBuy now from Cuckooland (£719), Lakeland (£799)\n\nThe Ooni Volt 12 is a great overall pizza oven. It's lightweight and has a weather-resistant powder-coated outer shell so you should be able to store it outside just fine.\n\nThe Ooni Volt 12 is all-electric, meaning you won’t need to deal with stocking up on wood pellets or dealing with the charcoal ash they leave behind.\n\nYou’ll be able to set precise temperatures, timers, and a top/bottom balance with ease, allowing you to cook homemade pizzas in around 90 seconds. Don’t worry if you can’t be bothered with the timers or temperature controls – the Volt 12 also has automatic heat settings and lights up inside so you can keep an eye on your cheesy treat.\n\nNix Hydration Biosensor\n\nBuy now from Nix (£103)\n\nThe Nix Hydration Biosensor is a must for those who take running, cycling, or any other form of exercise seriously and want to get the most out of their training or workout.\n\nThis biosensor will analyse sweat levels and deliver real-time hydration data in the form of personalised notifications to your smartphone or watch. You’ll be told exactly when you should drink, what you should drink, and how much you should drink to help ensure peak hydration.\n\nIf you’re looking to break your 5km run personal best or 10k cycle time, it’s definitely best to stay as hydrated as possible. Even mild dehydration can affect performance, after all.\n\nBeeline Velo 2\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£99.99), eBay (£85)\n\nTrying to get around a city on a bike is a stress like no other, attempting to navigate cars, people and lanes while also tracking your destination on your phone with a confused navigation system. The Velo 2 cycling computer is, unfortunately, unable to remove the cars and people in your way, but it can make navigation easier.\n\nThis tiny circular device attaches to your bike, giving you easy minimal navigation instructions that are built from tracking real-life journeys. You can also track your speed, arrival time, and distance and check the time. It’s even weatherproof!\n\nDJI Avata Pro-View Combo\n\nBuy now from DJI (£499+), Argos (£1,249) and Amazon (£1,294)\n\nFirst-person view drones (FPV) have really taken off recently. Allowing you to put on a headset and fly a drone from a first-person view, these unique devices are the closest you can feel to flying like a bird.\n\nDJI has released its latest version of this technology known as the DJI Avata. It is made to be more durable, and ready for any unfortunate crashes. You can pilot it via a controller or a joystick which mimics the movements of your hand. It also comes with plenty of clever features like the ability to use custom routes, follow a person or vehicle, and return to the starting point if it goes too far away.\n\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nBuy now from eBay (£649.99), Amazon (£699) and John Lewis & Partners (£699)\n\nApple has now been making its Watch series for a good few years, most of which have followed roughly the same formula. The Apple Watch Ultra takes all of the good bits of previous designs, and piles as much as possible on top.\n\nWhile the result is a smartwatch that is by no means cheap, it has also resulted in the perfect device for athletes of all practices. Apple has kept divers, climbers, tennis players, martial artists and everyone in-between in mind.\n\nIt is durable, water-resistant up to 100 metres, can deal with extremely low and high temperatures, has an impressive 36-hour battery life, and has detailed apps to track your fitness and health.\n\nAnker Soundcore Motion X600\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£199.99), Soundcore (£199.99)\n\nThis cool and relatively inexpensive portable speaker promises stereo spatial audio at an impressive 50W output. A modern-day boombox for Spotify users among us, the Anker Soundcore Motion X600 is a quality choice for audiophiles everywhere.\n\nThe Motion X600 boasts five drivers and five amplifiers placed in the gadget to deliver sound all around you. It should make whatever you’re listening to fill the space you find yourself in, inside or out and about. Remember to use the Soundcore app to alter your EQ for the best listening experience!\n\nWith a purported up to 12-hour playtime, the battery should last long enough for just about any function you’re heading to or organising, and, better yet, it features IPX7 waterproof protection for those rainy days.\n\nGarmin Instinct Crossover\n\nBuy now from Jura Watches (£349), Garmin (£399.99)\n\nGarmin’s new Instinct Crossover Solar fits a niche group of people who seem to be exercising every second of the day. It doesn’t matter what your chosen sport is, the never-ending menus on this watch will have a mode for you. It tracks everything from running power to heart rate, effective recovery time, and even how smoothly you descend a mountain bike trail.\n\nWhen you eventually stop running, it can track your sleep and stress, and to fit even more exercise into your life, it uses solar power to stay on for an estimated 70 days without a charge.\n\nPrinker S Digital Tattoo Printer\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£439)\n\nThis clever, digital printing gadget allows you to print temporary tattoos onto your body in an instant. The ink inside the gadget is cosmetic grade and cruelty-free, plus, the tattoos are water resistant but soap washable, and last between one and three days when printed onto the skin.\n\nThis gadget is amazing for corporate events and parties, but it's also a great gift for those who like the idea of tattoos but don't want the commitment of a lifelong design.\n\nTo use, you simply sync the printer to your smart device, choose from 12,000+ existing designs or create your own, before sending your chosen tattoo to the printer. You then roll the Prinker device onto your body- it's as simple as that.\n\niRobot Roomba J7\n\nBuy now from iRobot (£699), Amazon (£799)\n\niRobot, not to be confused with the 2004 Will Smith classic, is the leading creator of robot vacuums with the Roomba range. Getting smarter each year, the new Roomba J7 combines both vacuum and mop in one machine. This itself isn’t new, but the company has introduced a new self-retracting mop feature.\n\nThe mop lifts out of the way when it approaches the carpet, only using the mop in the places you want it. In theory, this means a robot vacuum that can be fully independent and doesn’t need to be assisted… so this is how the robot uprising starts?\n\nMeta Quest 3\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£479), Argos (£479), John Lewis & Partners (£479)\n\nAh yes, the metaverse - the supposed future of our digital world. While this new virtual land hasn't exactly begun successfully, many tech leaders are still very much of the view that we'll soon be plugged in, enjoying our own digital house, job and life.\n\nIf you want to get in now and enjoy the metaverse and virtual reality, the Meta Quest 3 will likely be the best way to do this. Meta, previously known as Facebook, has poured money into this to offer the latest and most impressive specs available in the world of VR.\n\nDespite an array of impressive features, the Meta Quest 3 only costs £479 - a drop in the bucket compared to Apple's new Vision Pro headset.\n\nApple Airpods Gen 2\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£229), Argos (£229), Currys (£229), AO (£229), Very (£229)\n\nFor Apple fans, Airpods are likely the obvious choice for a new pair of in-ear headphones. If you are looking for the latest and best option, it will be the new Apple Airpods Pro 2nd generation.\n\nWhile they don't come cheap, they offer Apple's best active noise cancellation outside of the incredibly pricey AirPods Max, as well as upping the battery life to get you 6 hours on a single charge.\n\nThe most important upgrade here is the new H2 chip. This aids the noise cancellation and allows the headphones to adapt songs to offer rich bass and clean high notes in real-time.\n\nDJI Osmo Mobile 6 Handheld Gimbal\n\nBuy now from Currys (£134), eBay (134.50), Argos (£135)\n\nWhen it comes to camera equipment, DJI has spread itself across the whole industry making a load of action cameras, drones and accessories. One of their latest devices is the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, a gimbal that you can use with your smartphone.\n\nThis will balance out your movement when you are filming, allowing you to take smooth videos even when you are running, driving or otherwise throwing yourself about.\n\nThrough the use of DJI's ActiveTrack 5.0 software, you can track a subject smoothly, keeping them in frame, even when they are moving about.\n\nThe gimbal also includes a host of buttons for zooming, cinematic blurs and other similar effects.\n\nAmazon Kindle Scribe\n\nBuy now from Very (£329), Currys (£329), Amazon (£329.99)\n\nAmazon has come a long way since its first Kindle device, but a feature that they have been slow to take up is the stylus. Now, with the Kindle Scribe, you can scribble notes on the book you are reading, make handwritten notes, and generally get more out of your Kindle.\n\nThe device also features one of Kindle's best displays, meaning you can continue to read in bright lighting. There is also a warm light setting for when you want to wind down and get ready for bed.\n\nNothing Phone 1\n\nBuy now from Very (£449), Currys (£449) and Argos (£449.99)\n\nThe brand Nothing (best known for headphones so far) has had the world of tech enthusiasts patiently waiting for the reveal of their new smartphone. They promised something a little bit different, and they delivered on that.\n\nThe back of the device is transparent, allowing you to see the inner workings of the device. On top of that, it features a number of LED lights that the company has called 'Glyphs'.\n\nThese lights flash in different ways to inform you of incoming calls, texts, social media notifications and plenty of other alerts on your device.\n\nElsewhere, the team at Nothing have fit in a sold battery, strong camera performance and a good display.\n\nRead our full review of the Nothing Phone 1\n\nHyperX Cloud Alpha\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£69), Argos (£169.99)\n\nThe HyperX Cloud Alpha are a pair of gaming headphones that offer one thing above all: a fantastic battery life. HyperX claims that these headphones offer 300 hours of battery life. That means you can use these headphones for just over 12 days straight without a charge, although we would really recommend a break in there somewhere!\n\nOther than how long they'll last, these headphones also feature a powerful crisp sound and a truly excellent microphone quality.\n\nSony WH-1000XM5\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£264), Currys (£279) and John Lewis & Partners (£319)\n\nBack in 2018, Sony released what would become one of the best pairs of headphones available - the WH-1000XM3. Since then we've seen the XM4, and now, Sony has followed up with the WH-1000XM5. If you ignore the somewhat painfully dull naming conventions, these, like their predecessors, are some of the best headphones around.\n\nScoring 5 star reviews all around, the Sony WH-1000XM5 are very much designed for those who would rather not splurge on a pair of Apple AirPod Max headphones.\n\nIn terms of specs and audio, these are extremely similar to Sony's renditions from before. They offer market-leading audio across the lows, mids and highs, excellent noise cancellation, and you get an array of smart ambient features.\n\nThe biggest difference with these headphones is the design, offering a completely new look to their predecessor. More minimalist and lighter too.\n\nMacBook Pro with M3 Chip\n\nBuy now from Apple (£1,699), AO (£1,949)\n\nDoes Apple's new MacBook Pro reinvent the wheel? No. Does it feature ground-breaking new features and a revolutionary design…? Also no. What Apple's new MacBook Pro does is ramp up specs and improve on an already popular design.\n\nIt features a backlit magic keyboard with touch ID, plus three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, SDXC card slot, a headphone jack and a MagSafe 3 port. Additionally, it has 36GB unified memory and 1TB SSD storage, but the biggest change here is the processor, now featuring Apple's M3 processor chip. This makes the 2023 MacBook Pro an incredibly powerful computer. Finally, we have an Apple laptop that can keep up with gaming alongside the demands of professional editing and creative software.\n\nDJI Mini 3 Pro\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£573), DJI (£709) and Currys (£588/£728)\n\nEvery year, DJI’s Mini series gets smaller and yet more powerful, cramming high-end specs into a lightweight drone that you can chuck in your bag.\n\nBut with all those improvements, comes an eye-watering price, and an increasing fear for your financial status if you crash it. It offers advanced obstacle avoidance features, a rotating lens so you can film portrait or landscape, 4K video, smart flying features like automatic tracking and the ability to follow a subject.\n\nDespite its higher price, this feels like the perfect drone for beginners, those who like to travel, or really anyone in the market for a light-weight, high tech drone.\n\nVAHA S Fitness Mirror\n\nBuy now from VAHA (£1,750)\n\nSure, you could go the gym... or, the gym could come to you. That's the idea of the Vaha S Fitness Mirror, giving you a full size mirror that can play over 850 workout classes, and connect you with personal trainers in real time.\n\nThe mirror itself is a 32-inch Full HD touchscreen, complete with 30W speakers and a brushed metal finish.\n\nWhile this is without a doubt one of the the more impressive home workout options, it is also pretty pricey. The mirror alone will cost you £1195 and then there is a £39 a month payment to access classes.\n\nFor more cool gadgets, see our round-up of the best smart mirrors to buy for your home.\n\nTherabody Wave Roller\n\nBuy now from Healf (£125), Therabody (£125), Amazon (£148.99)\n\nThe Therabody Wave Roller takes the traditional model of a foam roller and throws a bunch of tech into it. Through the use of vibration therapy and a wave-style texture, this roller helps to work out all of your aches and pains.\n\nIt comes with an app that can guide you through a rolling routine, five customisable vibration frequencies and can be used anywhere on the body that needs working out.\n\nGeneration Zerøgrand II\n\nBuy for women from Amazon (£103.55), M&S (£130)\n\nBuy for men from Amazon (£100.79)\n\nThe sustainable shoe market is blowing up right now, with major companies trying to create the shoe that leaves the smallest carbon footprint. One of the more unique attempts at this is the recent Generation Zerøgrand II.\n\nThese shoes from Cole Haan are made using almost entirely recycled materials. The upper design is made with vegan microfibre made of 21 per cent recycled content and a felt fabric made of 85 per cent plastic bottles. The laces are completely recycled, and the most unique part, the soles have a minimum of 25 per cent natural dandelion rubber!\n\nSony Linkbuds\n\nBuy now from Currys (£139), Amazon (£149) and Argos (£150)\n\nSony has always been at the forefront of headphone technology and with its latest pair, it is doing something rather unique.\n\nThese headphones feature a hole in them (by design – don’t worry, no parts are missing). This means you can be more aware of your surroundings and people desperately trying to get your attention while enjoying your music.\n\nIt features other clever features like touch control by tapping the skin by your ear and volume that adjusts to match your environment.\n\nLEGO App-controlled Transformation Vehicle\n\nBuy now from Amazon\n\nWhen it comes to LEGO, there is a lot of choice. However, this new LEGO Technic set has a unique feature to help it stand out - the ability to control it via an app.\n\nWith the app, you can drive the vehicle around, and when you flip the car over (or hit a wall), it will reveal a completely different car below. Because the LEGO car features suspension, you can even drive it over uneven surfaces.\n\nFor more LEGO Technic picks check out our list of the best LEGO Technic kits.\n\nSkydio 2\n\nBuy now from Skydio\n\nThere are a lot of drones on the market right now, all offering something slightly different. However, Skydio’s 2 has a unique feature we haven’t seen elsewhere that really helps it to stand out.\n\nThrough a technology known as Keyframe, you can plan out routes that the Skydio 2 will follow. You can define complex camera movements and then choose what speed the drone will approach these routes.\n\nSkydio’s aim with this feature was to be able to give anyone the ability to get clean drone shots, no matter their level of skill. Equally, you can use this feature to film yourself doing something if you don’t have someone to pilot it for you.\n\nRocketbook Smart Reusable Notebook\n\nBuy now from Rocketbook (£17.99+), Amazon (£33.99)\n\nFor the eco-conscious note-taker, this smart notebook has 32 pages that are easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth when paired with Pilot Frixion pens.

The FirePit eliminates smoke by making your fire hotter. Battery-powered fans at the bottom of the fire basket stoke the flames from beneath, while the mesh sides let plenty of air in.\n\nThe improved airflow means the flame burns hotter and more efficiently, therefore producing less smoke. Plus, you can put some charcoal in and rest a grill on the top. The fans last between 7 and 30 hours depending on how high they’re turned up, and the battery can be recharged via USB.\n\nSimba Hybrid® Luxe Mattress - SupportCore™\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£947.40), Mattress Online (£1,579)\n\nA good night’s sleep is one of the most important things you can do for your health and wellbeing.\n\nMemory foam mattresses are fashionable, but their spongy embrace isn’t for everyone. Simba’s patented hybrid solution pairs springs with open-cell foam, a memory foam-like material with internal pockets that allow the mattress to disperse heat. This creates a mattress that’s firm, ensures two people sleeping in a bed won’t feel each other move around, and is cooler than memory foam.\n\nThe company’s latest upgrade, the Hybrid Luxe, adds a second set of springs to provide extra support and remove any chance of sore joints for side sleepers. Plus, Simba has added a breathable bamboo wool layer just beneath the top layer, to help regulate your temperature and fend off a sweaty night’s sleep.\n\nTransparent Speaker\n\nBuy now from My Theresa (£900), Transparent (£900), Mr Porter (£1,222.37)\n\nApart from public toilets, few things in life aren’t made better by being see-through. Case in point, this speaker replaces its housing with tempered glass.\n\nIts creator, the Swedish design studio Transparent, says that its speakers use durable, recyclable materials. Each of the devices can be used alone as a Bluetooth speaker, paired together as a stereo sound system, or plugged into existing audio equipment.\n\nIt’s upgradeable too, with a compartment at the rear that can hold and power various modules – a voice assistant, for example, or new wireless tech.\n\nThe North Face Dryzzle FutureLight Insulated Jacket\n\nBuy for women from House of Fraser (£149), The North Face (£330)\n\nBuy for men from Alpine Trek (£319.95), The North Face (£330)\n\nA three-layer coat, the oddly named Dryzzle Futurelight provides a combined high durability and waterproofing to keep you safe out in the heavy rain. North Face applies a material that allows for great breathability so along with not getting wet, you also won't feel like you're getting overly stuffy.\n\nSonos Arc soundbar\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£798), Currys (£899) and Sonos (£899)\n\nOffering a hard-to-beat balance of features, design, ease of use and performance, the Sonos Arc, the company’s first Atmos soundbar, is an easy product to love. There are very few soundbars out there that do so much so well. In fact, it's our pick for the best soundbar.\n\nNo matter what you’re watching, it sounds superb. There’s a stunning clarity to dialogue, a fullness to bass and stacks of detail across the frequency range. But when you listen to an Atmos soundtrack, you really hear the added breadth and depth you’d expect from a more immersive 3D soundstage, with sound effects that are placed precisely around and above you, delivered by the Arc’s carefully angled drivers.\n\nOf course, it’ll fit into a wider Sonos multi-room system if you have other Sonos speakers, or act as a superb sound system on its own for crisp, expressive music playback. Its size means you’ll probably want a 55-inch TV or larger though, as it’ll dwarf anything smaller.\n\nFlare Calmer\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£19.95), Gear 4 Music (£20.99)\n\nWhat are the most annoying sounds you can think of? Nails scratching down a chalkboard? Car alarms? It could be that our ears, through thousands of years of evolution, are sort of designed to find these sounds particularly unpleasant to act as a warning that danger is imminent.\n\nThat’s great for our ancient ancestors, listening out for prowling sabre-tooth tigers, but for us modern humans it’s just plain annoying. In fact, according to audio specialists Flare, the shape of the eardrum itself acts as a bell, adding 20db of distortion-causing resonance.\n\nThis irritating distortion could impact on our mental and physical wellbeing, so the idea behind the Flare Calmer earplugs is that they change the shape of the eardrum to cut out the particularly annoying distorted frequencies between 2,000-8,000 Hz. By doing this, they claim to reduce ear fatigue, noise-induced headaches and overall stress levels.\n\nSo does it work? Well, it’s hard to tell how much earplugs can reduce your overall stress in the midst of a global pandemic, protests in the streets and the ever-present threat of a toddler walking into your Zoom meetings, but what is certain is that after using them almost constantly for a few weeks now, there are definitely benefits to having them in.\n\nFor a start, it is noticeable that the very worst day-to-day frequencies are reduced, and this has the knock-on effect that they are ultimately less annoying. The same can be said when you have them underneath headphones, and although they change the sounds slightly, it makes music a little warmer and notches down the intensity.\n\nAnother side effect that has been noted by other users, not that I can verify and was entirely unexpected by Flare, is that it reduces the constant ringing experienced by those suffering from tinnitus. - AM\n\nGoogle Pixel 8\n\nBuy now from Amazon (£599), Carphone Warehouse, Vodafone (£26+ per month)\n\nThe Google Pixel 8 doesn't just look sleek - it seamlessly blends cutting-edge technology with a vibrant display experience.
