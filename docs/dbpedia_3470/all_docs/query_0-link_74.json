        "text": "His Musical Career (1 reel) (1914) starring Charlie Chaplin, Mack Swain\n\nIn His Musical Career, Charlie Chaplin and his friend are hired to deliver a piano to one address, and repossess a piano at a different address. And the inevitable mix-up occurs.\n\nIn short, His Musical Career is an early Charlie Chaplin comedy at Keystone – which means frenetic, with a lot of slapstick. Having said that, it’s a fairly funny short film.\n\nTrivia\n\nThis film is one of the 34 short films in the “Chaplin at Keystone” DVD collection.\n\nMany of the gags were also in Laurel and Hardy’s “The Music Box“\n\nCast of characters\n\nCharles Chaplin (Limelight; The Rink) … Charlie aka Tom – Piano Mover\n\nMack Swain (The Gold Rush; His Trysting Place) … Mike aka Ambrose – Tom’s Partner\n\nFritz Schade (His Prehistoric Past; The Property Man) … Mr. Rich\n\nCecile Arnold (Dough and Dynamite; Those Love Pangs) … Mrs. Rich\n\nCharley Chase (The Golden Age of Comedy) … Piano Store Manager\n\nFrank Hayes (His Trysting Place) … Mr. Poor\n\nAdditional cast"
