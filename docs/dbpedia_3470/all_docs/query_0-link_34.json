        "text": "English musical hall veteran Charlie Chaplin began his film career just after New Year’s 1914. By Halloween, he’d shot 34 short films and the first full-length slapstick comedy and was already well on his way to superstardom. He had also made his debut as a director.\n\nNearly a century later, the fruits of Chaplin’s remarkable year at the Mack Sennett’s studio in California (he left for a more lucrative deal at Triangle soon afterwards) have been assembled in the wonderful collection “Chaplin at Keystone,” out today on DVD from the dedicated archivists at Flicker Alley.\n\nThe set is the result of a decade-long restoration effort by the British Film Institute, Italy’s Cineteca de Bologna and France’s Lobster Films that utilized negatives and prints from archives around the world, working miracles with state-of-the-art chemical and digital restoration methods. They’ve produced the clearest, steadiest and most complete copies of these oft-reissued, abridged, retitled and badly-duped films that have been available in more than 80 years.\n\nChaplin introduces his signature character, The Tramp, in his second short, in a beautiful transfer of the famous “Kid Races at Venice,” in which he creates a sensation disrupting a real-life sporting event. But the pathos he later invested in the character is rarely present in these often quite violent but very funny shorts that have Chaplin either teamed with or supporting (and frequently upstaging) Sennett’s established stars, Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle, Ford Sterling, Chester Conklin and Mable Normand (the latter directed one of the shorts and co-directed two others).\n\nDemonstrating an extraordinary instinct for performing on camera at the outset, Chaplin appears in a variety of other comic guises, playing a dandy turned newspaper reporter in his debut “Making a Living,” an immigrant German in “Mabel at the Wheel” and a con man who tries to fleece Marie Dressler in the feature “Tillie’s Punctured Romance,” adapted from Dressler’s 1910 stage hit (it was remade by Sennett in 1927 in an apparently lost version with W.C. Fields).\n\nIn several other films, Chaplin recreates his vaudeville role as a drunk, appearing in “Tango Tangles” more or less as his handsome self with Arbuckle and Sterling at a Venice, Calif. dance hall. By March, Chaplin had persuaded Sennett to let him co-direct “Twenty Minutes of Love” and “Caught in a Cabaret,” making his solo directing debut in April with “Caught in the Rain,” which he also wrote. Chaplin was already introducing themes that would reoccur throughout a film career that stretched into the 1960s.\n\nThat September, Chaplin wrote and directed the hilarious “Dough and Dynamite” co-starring with Turpin as waiters pressed into service as reluctant bakers during a strike. An excellent booklet by Jeffrey Vance accompanying the set says the film — which grossed more than $130,000 on an $1,800 budget — was considered “one of the greatest of all Hollywood comedies” of the silent era.\n\nBesides featurettes on the restorations and the filming locations, the set also includes a surviving fragment from “A Thief Catcher,” a long-lost short with Chaplin appearing as a Keystone Kop that was discovered earlier this year. “Chaplin at Keystone” includes all of his other shorts from 1914 except for “Her Friend the Bandit” with Normand, which sadly is no longer known to exist.\n\nTurner Classic Movies’ TCM Vault Collection, an ongoing excavation into Universal’s holdings, recently yielded the DVD debut of Douglas Sirk’s much-requested “The Tarnished Angels” (1958). William Faulkner, who avoided adapting his own novels in his long screenwriting career, reckoned that Sirk and writer George Zuckerman was the best translation he’d seen of his work. Sirk thought it was his finest film.\n\nSirk had wanted to film Faulkner’s 1935 novel “Pylon” when he was working in pre-World War II Germany, but UFA thought the subject was too American. The director found no taker until 20 years later, when the massive success of Sirk’s “Written on the Wind” (1956) interested Universal in another story that would reunite three of that film’s stars: Rock Hudson, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone.\n\nSet in New Orleans during the 1932 Mardi Gras, “The Tarnished Angels” casts Hudson as a soft-spoken, hard-drinking reporter who becomes obsessed with the parachute jumping wife (Malone) of a barnstorming World War I flying hero (Stack). Jack Carson plays their mechanic, who tries to talk the reckless Stack out of bartering his wife for a chance to pilot an experimental plane in an air race.\n\nVery different in tone than the romantic melodramas that Sirk is best known for today, the downbeat “The Tarnished Angels” was a commercial and critical failure on release. Sirk made just two more films — the regrettably unavailable-on-DVD World War I drama “A Time to Live and a Time to Die” and his very popular remake of “Imitation of Life” — in Hollywood before returning to Germany.\n\n“The Tarnished Angels” a tough and poetic movie with great, subtle performances and a remarkably staged climax. A pristine transfer shows off Irving Glassberg’s gleaming black-and-white CinemaScope photography. It’s available for sale (either alone or as part of a set with four other Sirk films from the ’50s) exclusively at TCM.com\n\nPlaying Mrs. Henry Miller, a young Ellen Burstyn has a lengthy opening scene with full-frontal nudity (and bedbugs) in Joseph Strick’s long-unseen 1970 version of Miller’s autobiographical novel “The Tropic of Cancer,” which oddly moves the action from Paris of the 1930s to the late 1960s.\n\nRip Torn, ideally cast as the randy Miller, still consorts with a variety of prostitutes, reciting large, lewd swaths of the book as voice-over narration. Very much a product of its time, this independently-produced film (the fearless Strick had previously filmed James Joyce’s “Ulysses”) was originally distributed by Paramount with an X rating. It now carries an NC-17 and would make an ideal double feature with the NC-17 biopic of Henry Miller and his mistress Anais Nin, “Henry and June.”\n\nTorn’s real-life wife and frequent co-star, the late, great Geraldine Page, was Oscar-nominated as Best Actress in another film licensed from Paramount that Olive Films is making available on DVD today. She stars as a spinster singing teacher in the pre-World War I South pining for a wastrel physician (Laurence Harvey) who prefers the town tramp (Rita Moreno) in Peter Glenville’s 1962 film version of Tennessee Williams’ “Summer and Smoke.”\n\nThis somewhat stagey Hal Wallis production — Glenville would direct “Becket” for Wallis two years later– received deserved Oscar nominations for Una Merkel’s turn as Page’s neurotic mother, Elmer Bernstein’s score and its art direction. Charles Lang’s Technicolor cinematography positively glows.\n\nThe Blu-ray debut of “Back to the Future” (and its two sequels), also out today, looks incredible for a 25-year-old film. The major new feature is an enteraining full-length documetary featuring fresh interviews with director Robert Zemeckis, co-writer and producer Bob Gale, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Steven Spielberg and other cast and crew members.\n\nFor the first time, Eric Stoltz, who was replaced by the previously unavailable first-choice Fox five weeks into shooting, has consented to the inclusion of some brief non-dialogue glimpses of his abandoned performance. Hopefully we’ll see some of Stoltz’s actual line readings — which reportedly weren’t very funny — for the 30th anniversary edition."
