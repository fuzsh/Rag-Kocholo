        "text": "How does one decide the Top 50 classic country artists of all time? Obviously, hit songs are essential, and a resume worthy of the Country Music Hall of Fame is key, while actual induction is better. However, the true legends of country music are those who exert a lasting influence on subsequent artists, as you'll see on this list.\n\nAll of these classic country stars had what it takes to make the cut. Each artist's influence on contemporary country was given much more consideration than anything else in deciding the Top 50.\n\nFor example, both Hank Williams and Hank Williams Jr. are legends who are more than worthy of Top 10 status. The former is a true pioneer, but the real question is this: which one of these men had more influence on artists of the 21st century?\n\nThat question provoked a huge debate among the Taste of Country team, and you'll see how it turned out in the list below. We did our best to explain the ranking for each of these 50 classic country artists, especially as it pertains to matters of influence.\n\nTo qualify as classic country for this list, each artist needed to have notched a hit song or notable achievement prior to 1990. Because of that, modern country legends including Tim McGraw, Toby Keith, Brooks & Dunn and Shania Twain did not make the cut. Others whose influence has timed out also washed out of consideration.\n\nStrength of catalog and success in retail stores and on country radio definitely moved a classic country artist higher on this list. The top artists do all of this, and they also lead the pack in some other tangible way, including musical innovation, business or how they approached their career in the later years.\n\nNo. 1 is an all-time icon who's influential for so much more than music. Can you guess who it is? Scroll down to see the full list of the Top 50 Classic Country artists and then let us know where we got it right, or wrong."
