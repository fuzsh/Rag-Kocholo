        "text": "This month marks the anniversary of Liza Minnelli and David Gest's unforgettable Hollywood wedding in March 2002.\n\nThe former couple, who divorced in 2007, had the craziest wedding that showbiz has ever seen - and it would appear other celebrities are yet to top their A-list guest list.\n\nAround 850 guests were invited to watch Liza - who was 48 at the time - and David, then 56, tie the knot in New York City on March 27.\n\nSome of those invited include the likes of ex-EastEnders actress Martine McCutcheon, who was Liza's bridesmaid, and pop legend Michael Jackson as David's best man.\n\nMartine, who recently appeared on The Masked Singer, appears to remember the day very well as she revealed back in January she sat next to former US president Donald Trump at the star-studded bash.\n\nShe gave viewers a clue as to who was behind the mask by dropping the subtle hint.\n\nThe singer clearly had an important role to play at their wedding 19 years ago, after meeting the couple at a club and immediately striking up a friendship.\n\nOther celebrities who also came along to watch them exchange vows at Marble Collegiate Church include Diana Ross, Donald Trump, Mia Farrow, Rosie O'Donnell, Martha Stewart, Joy Behar, Anthony Hopkins, Kirk Douglas, Dionne Warwick, David Hasselhoff, and Joan Collins, to name a few.\n\nLiza, who is now 75, had been married three times before tying the knot with David, but at the time of their wedding she was certain she'd found The One.\n\nShe told People how David was: \"Everything I ever dreamed of in a man - his humor, his authority, his manliness.\"\n\nGuests didn't think their over-the-top wedding could get any better, until they had their first kiss - which was the most unforgettable part of the day.\n\nThe View host Joy Behar revealed: \"He sucked her lips right out of her face!\"\n\nEven Donald Trump made a comment, as he said: \"I have been to many weddings. And I have never seen a kiss like that before.\"\n\nHowever, despite the fairytale showbiz wedding, the couple didn't get their happily ever after ending.\n\nThe pair filed for divorce in 2003 after just 16 months of marriage, sparking one of Hollywood's most acrimonious splits.\n\nAccusations and lawsuits flew on both sides, with David even suing his ex for $10million. The litigation dragged on for years and was only settled in 2007 when they agreed to drop their legal actions and opt for a no-fault divorce .\n\nLiza has not been married since, and David tragically died in 2016."
