        "text": "LONDON (AFP) - David Gest, the US television personality and ex-husband of actress Liza Minnelli, was found dead in a five-star London hotel on Tuesday (April 12) in unexplained circumstances, police and a friend said.\n\nGest's body was found at the Four Seasons Hotel in the Canary Wharf district of the British capital. The 62-year-old had been due to tour Britain in an autobiographical musical show, \"David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul\", later this year.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today,\" his friend Imad Handi said in a statement released to media.\n\n\"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.\"\n\nA spokesman for Scotland Yard said police officers were called to the hotel just after 10.00 am \"to reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s. \"London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. Life was pronounced extinct at the hotel.\"\n\nGest was married to Minnelli from 2002 to 2007 but they had a bitter divorce, with him accusing her of beating him while she was drunk. He was a close friend of Michael Jackson, producing a documentary about the late singer in 2011, and had appeared on a string of reality television shows in Britain."
