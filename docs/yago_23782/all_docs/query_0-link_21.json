        "text": "David Gest, a concert promoter and television producer who gained fleeting fame for his brief marriage to Liza Minnelli and went on to become a reality television star in Britain, died on Tuesday in London. He was 62.\n\nIn a statement, the Metropolitan Police of London said that they were summoned to the Four Seasons Hotel in Canary Wharf, where members of the ambulance service pronounced Mr. Gest dead. No cause was given.\n\nMr. Gest, a music-industry veteran, operated for most of his career behind the scenes, producing celebrity awards shows and concert tours featuring former soul-music greats. In 2001, he staged two concerts at Madison Square Garden, “Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration: The Solo Years,” which featured Michael Jackson, the reunited Jackson Five and several guests, including Ms. Minnelli. A film version was broadcast by CBS as a two-hour special.\n\nA year later, he found himself squarely in the glare of the spotlights when he became Ms. Minnelli’s fourth husband. The two married on March 16, 2002, with Elizabeth Taylor serving as a maid of honor and Mr. Jackson as best man. The swarm of celebrity guests at the reception included Michael and Kirk Douglas, Elton John, Anthony Hopkins, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Donald J. Trump.\n\nA television series, “Liza and David,” was planned for VH1 but was scrapped after one episode was completed because of constant arguments between the co-stars and the channel’s executives.\n\nThe couple separated after 16 months. During divorce proceedings, Mr. Gest sued Ms. Minnelli for $10 million, accusing her of violence and physical abuse. He alleged that Ms. Minnelli, in alcohol-induced rages, beat him so badly that he suffered “constant, virtually unrelenting pain” in his head. The lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
