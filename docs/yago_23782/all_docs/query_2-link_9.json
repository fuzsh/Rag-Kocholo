Everyone knew but me. And I found out... well, let me put it this way: I'll never surprise anybody coming home as long as I live. I call first!\"\n\nLater in 1974, Minnelli married Jack Haley Jr, a producer and director. His father, Jack Haley, was Garland's co-star in The Wizard of Oz. However, they divorced in 1979.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1992, Minnelli was married to Mark Gero, a sculptor and stage manager.\n\nMinnelli was then married to concert promoter David Gest, from 2002 to 2007.\n\nShe also had relationships with Rock Brynner (son of Yul Brynner), Desi Arnaz, Jr, Peter Sellers, Charles Aznavour and Martin Scorsese."
