        "text": "Having spent virtually her entire life in the spotlight, Liza Minnelli has been candid about living in the public eye. That includes some choice quotes about her four husbands—Oscar-winning songwriter Peter Allen, TV director and producer Jack Haley, Jr., sculptor Mark Gero, and producer David Gest.\n\n\"I have great taste in directors and in people for costumes. But as far as husbands go, I think that I kept changing for them. And then about a year later I'd think: 'What am I doing? This really isn't me,'\" she told Oprah in 2010.\n\nMinnelli, 75, collaborated with her close friend, the legendary designer Halston, on one of her most striking wedding looks, a yellow pantsuit she wore to marry Jack Haley, Jr. That wedding is depicted in Netflix's new Halston series by Ryan Murphy.\n\nThe recreation of Minnelli’s yellow wedding suit from Netflix’s Halston.\n\nSpeaking to Variety, Krysta Rodriguez, who plays Minnelli, talked about gaining insight into the legendary singer from her past husbands.\n\n\"The things that really informed a lot about what I was doing were the quotes other people said about her. I would listen to what her ex-husbands would say or her friends,\" Rodriguez said. \"She talks about how people ask her why she doesn’t sing her mother’s songs, and she says, 'Because my mother’s singing about victims and I sing about survivors.' I think that was the key: The key to Liza was that she survived, and she still survives, and she’s the only one.\"\n\nRodriguez also spoke about the importance that Halston played in Minnelli's life.\n\n“What I love about the relationship that I got to have on the show was that her and Halston got to be ride or dies,” Rodriguez told Variety. “And that my interactions with him were always emotional. When things are going wrong in his life, or things are going wrong in her life, they find each other through every decade, through every era, through every trial, and usually it’s in one of their homes, quietly, just the two of them.”\n\nWhile they aren't all depicted on Halston, here's what to know about Minnelli's marriages and the lives of her four husbands.\n\nMinnelli's first husband was Peter Allen, the composer whose life and songs inspired The Boy from Oz.\n\nA few days shy of turning 21, Minnelli married her first husband, Peter Allen in 1967, wearing a Victorian-inspired wedding dress for the ceremony. A musician, songwriter, and stage performer, Allen won an Academy Award for the song \"Arthur Theme (Best That You Can Do),\" which appeared in the film Arthur starring Dudley Moore and Minnelli herself.\n\nMinnelli and Allen on their wedding day.\n\nAllen first rose to fame as a member of the musical duo The Allen Brothers, who were discovered by Judy Garland, Minnelli's mother, in 1964. Garland helped the pair achieve success in the U.S. and U.K., and reportedly was the one who introduced him to Minnelli.\n\nAllen's career was explored in the popular musical The Boy from Oz. The show debuted in Australia but went on to become a Broadway hit featuring Hugh Jackman as Allen.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with The Advocate cited in the book , Minnelli spoke about Allen's sexuality. \"[I] married Peter and he didn't tell me he was gay. Everyone knew but me. And I found out...well, let me put it this way: I'll never surprise anybody coming home as long as I live. I call first!\" she said.\n\nAfter eight years, they split in 1974–though they had previously separated in 1969. Later, Allen was in a relationship with Gregory Connell for over a decade, until his death in 1984. Allen passed away in June 1992 due to throat cancer related to contracting AIDS.\n\nShe was with Emmy-winning director Jack Haley, Jr. for five years.\n\nMinnelli's second marriage was to Hollywood staple Jack Haley, Jr. when she was 28. The pair had a connection, in that Haley's father played the Tin Man in 1939's The Wizard of Oz, opposite Garland.\n\nHaley was acclaimed for his work in television, winning a Peabody Award for the documentary series Biography, and an Emmy for producing the 41st Academy Awards. Fittingly, many of his projects focused on the film and TV industries. Some of his enduring works include Life Goes to the Movies, which featured Minnelli as a co-host, the Nancy Sinatra special Movin' with Nancy, and the MGM compilation flick That's Entertainment! which also features Minnelli.\n\nAccording to a 2008 article from The Guardian, the relationship between Minnelli and Haley was largely about companionship. \"Haley was husband number two and straight, but they were friends rather than lovers.\"\n\nAfter five years, Minnelli and Haley divorced in 1979. Haley died at 67 in April 2001 of respiratory failure.\n\n\"Jack was the first one to remind the general public of our heritage. America’s royalty is our entertainers, who have given so much to the world. I fell in love with him the first time I met him, and I have loved him with all of my heart ever since,” Minnelli said when he passed, per Variety.\n\nAt 33, Minnelli married sculptor Mark Gero.\n\nHer third marriage, to sculptor Mark Gero, took place in 1979, when Minnelli was 33.\n\nMinnelli and Gero's relationship was comparatively private, but a 1990 Architectural Digest feature shared details about their Manhattan home. It even features a cameo from Halston, who introduced the couple to interior designer Timothy Macdonald.\n\n“I suppose our professional relationship began in a fairly unorthodox way,” Minnelli told Architectural Digest. “A good friend of mine, Halston, knew in his own clever way that I was looking for a designer, but that I would hate to go to someone's office and be shown swatches. So he invited Tim and me to the same dinner party, and we hit it off right away. I'd already found the apartment, and when I brought Tim up here, he took one look and said, ‘Great.’ Then we were off and running immediately.\"\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, Minnelli was stressed about decorating her space with Gero, so Halston told her to \"go out of town and forget about it.\" When she returned, the place was finished.\n\n\"We walked into the most beautiful apartment I had ever seen in my life. He had gone to all that trouble and then left so that we could discover it ourselves,\" she recalled.\n\nWhile she and Gero were together, Minnelli suffered a miscarriage in 1981.\n\nBy January 1992, things had evidently soured between Minnelli and Gero, and she was \"granted an uncontested divorce.\" Gero is currently 68. His father was successful Broadway producer Frank Gero, who worked on Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Oleanna, and A Steady Rain.\n\nHer fourth wedding to producer David Gest, reportedly cost $3.5 million.\n\nMichael Jackson introduced Minnelli to his close friend David Gest, per The Washington Post. Gest had produced a trio of television specials on Jackson, and was highly successful within the entertainment industry.\n\nAccording to E!, their Manhattan wedding cost roughly $3.5 million. Minnelli's dress from this wedding was designed by Bob Mackie, and she was 56 at the time.\n\nTheir relationship mixed the professional and personal, with Gest serving as her manager and planning a successful comeback tour for her in 2002, according to NBC News. Things began to deteriorate prior to their split in 2007, and Gest accused her of hitting him in a rage fueled by alcohol, something Minnelli denied, according to The Washington Post. He also filed a $10 million lawsuit against her, while Minnelli responded with a suit of her own.\n\nThe legal battle between them lasted years, but in 2007, they finalized a no-fault divorce and settled the lawsuits. Gest died at 62 in 2016.\n\nMinnelli expressed hesitance in marrying again during an Access Hollywood interview in 2012. “If you even hear I’m getting married, hit me over the head and take me outta there!\" she joked. \"You try and accommodate because you love someone… [and] nowadays why get married? Nobody else does. It’s not like I want to have children, I tried that, didn’t work unfortunately.”\n\nBut the good news is, if we learned anything from the Sex and the City sequel, she's clearly comfortable being single."
