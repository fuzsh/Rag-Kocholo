It's called 'Liza's Back!', it's receiving its world premiere in London, and it opens two weeks after Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor take up the reigns of Best Man and Maid of Honour respectively for what promises to be New York's wedding of the year.\n\nShowbusiness legend Liza Minnelli, bouncing back from illness and heading into marriage number four, said on Thursday she was convinced her mother Judy Garland was watching over her as a guardian angel.\n\nThe 55-year-old star even burst into song with a brief chorus from \"Cabaret\" as she hugged impresario David Gest, who is producing Minnelli's new stage show and marrying her in New York in March.\n\nElizabeth Taylor is to be maid of honour and Michael Jackson the best man for the showbusiness wedding of the year.\n\nMinnelli, whose rollercoaster career and search for true love have mirrored her mother's tempestuous life, said: \"I loved my mother like crazy. She is my guardian angel.\"\n\nThe Hollywood star, whose father was film director Vincente Minnelli, told a London news conference: \"I am a thoroughbred, literally a thoroughbred. It's an inner strength that my parents gave me, especially my mother.\"\n\nMinnelli has been plagued by ill health, suffering a bad back, two hip replacements and encephalitis, a potentially deadly inflammation of the brain.\"\n\nGest said: \"A year ago she could not walk, she could not talk. They said she would never sing and she was in a wheelchair. She lost 90 pounds. How many of you could get through that and a year later be standing here looking as fabulous as this woman?\"\n\nMinnelli met Gest 15 years ago at Frank Sinatra's house.\n\nThey got together again when she was appearing in a Michael Jackson special to mark the 30th career anniversary of \"The King of Pop\".\n\nAfter three marriages -- to Australian singer Peter Allen, filmmaker Jack Haley Jnr and sculptor Mark Gero -- she had been single for the last 10 years and vowed never to marry again.\n\nGest changed all that when he took her up to the rooftop of his apartment building, went down on one knee and proposed.\n\nFirst comes the wedding on March 16 in New York. Then she starts a European tour on April 2 with five nights at London's Royal Albert Hall where she last sang with Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jnr. Mary J. Blige, Luther Vandross and Usher will provide new material for the star who scooped an Oscar for her now-legendary portrayal of Sally Bowles in Bob Fosse's 1972 classic movie musical 'Cabaret'.\n\nMore than 300 stars -- from Whitney Houston to Michael Jackson -- are to attend the wedding with 42 top name acts performing with an 80-piece orchestra.\n\nGest, sporting the compulsory impresario shades for his London news conference, decided after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center to stage their wedding reception at The Regent in Wall Street.\n\n\"We all want to bring the party back there,\" he said\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2015.
