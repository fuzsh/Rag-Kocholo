        "text": "Hiya,\n\nAS you mighta seen, Mr Gest died recently and his name struck a chord somewhere. Only took a second of searching to see who he married back in 2002. I vaguely remember it being a pretty odd thing at the time. Liza Minelli was the Bride and the wedding guests were from all over the map. Some real old timers like Mickey Rooney and maybe more like Elizabeth Taylor and then Michael and Tito Jackson as best men, who grew up with Mr Gest in California I believe.\n\nSo I started a search from the engagement and wedding, and then marriage and after. Plenty to find if that interests you. Sad it didn't work out.\n\nMartin\n\nI remember the year he was on 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" and he was absolutely hilarious. I knew little or nothing about him before this, but I'll never forget how he made me laugh every night when he appeared on that show. He really had a fantastic sense of humor. Was saddened to hear he had passed yesterday.\n\nLooks like a lot of the folk at the wedding used the same plastic surgeon.\n\nI'll bet if you were to crack open the coffins in 20 years time they would look pretty much the same as when they croaked.\n\nI liked him, mad as a march hare but seemed harmless\n\nIf I remember rightly they hated each other with a vengeance after the marriage failed\n\nHe wanted Liza to pay him ten million bucks upon divorce because she kept beating him up.\n\nI watched a few clips from before the marriage (hopeful) through to the end (his death) and he was an interesting guy as it turned out. Heh, The Daily Mail? dished the hot poop on his private life with some spicy tidbits.\n\nAnyway, I didn't mind taking a few minutes to see what was up with him and his relationship with LIza."
