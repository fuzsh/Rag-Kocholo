They split 16 months later after explosive rows before finally divorcing in 2007.\n\nShe was at her lowest ebb when they tied the knot, tipping the scales at 17 stone following five trips to rehab, but her troubles continued after their $3.5million wedding.\n\nTheir split was played out in public with allegations of drunken rages and assault, after which David sued the star for $10 million in damages for spousal abuse.\n\nRead more:\n\nGest also accused her of not telling him she was carrying the herpes disease before he signed a pre-nuptial agreement, with his lawyers claiming she perpetrated a fraud.\n\nAccording to documents filed by Gest's lawyer in 2006: \"A person who knows he or she has an infectious disease and has sexual relations with another is guilty of a misdemeanour.\"\n\nHe also accused her of attacking him on a number of occasions, including an incident in 2003 while they were staying at London's Connaught Hotel.\n\nLegal papers claimed Liza \"began beating [Gest] about the head and face with her fists without relenting...Alcohol gave her remarkable force and strength.\"\n\nIn an interview the BBC, he said: \"There's a part of me that never wanted to be quote 'a celebrity' when I was married - I can't remember the woman's name.\"\n\nWhen prompted by the interviewer that the wife was Liza, he quipped: \"I knew it was Elizabeth. I never wanted to be in the public eye.\n\n\"It's very hard when you wake up each day and there's press outside your house. I would never want to live that type of life, I live a very simple life.\"\n\nThey continue to slam each other in the press, with Liza telling US talk show host Joy Behar she was unaware she paid for their wedding until recently.\n\nA total of 300 guests attended the ceremony at New York's St Regis hotel. Michael Jackson was best man with Elizabeth Taylor was matron-of-honour.\n\nOther stars in attendance included Joan Collins, Mia Farrow, Elton John and Donald Trump."
