        "text": "David Gest, a TV producer who was briefly married to stage star Liza Minnelli, was found dead in his hotel room at age 62, according to Deadline.com.\n\nThe death was termed “unexplained” by police. An autopsy is planned.\n\nGest and Minnelli married in March 2002 but separated in July 2003, during which time the couple was frequently featured in tabloids, as he encouraged her to get back in the public spotlight. At his urging she toured in the concert show Liza's Back in 2002 and became a regular guest on Arrested Development starting the following year. He was Minnelli's fourth husband.\n\nGest later sued Minnelli for $10 million claiming she had been physically abusive toward him. The suit was subsequently dismissed. Their divorce was finalized in 2007.\n\nDeadline reported that Gest was found unresponsive in his room at the Four Seasons Hotel in London April 12."
