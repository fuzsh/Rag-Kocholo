        "text": "The reality TV star and music producer David Gest has died in London at the age of 62, his friend Imad Handi said in a statement.\n\nGest appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in January but left the house for medical reasons. Viewers saw Gest take to his bed as Big Brother informed the audience he was under the weather.\n\nGest was married to Liza Minnelli from 2002-03, but they only officially divorced in 2007. He was also known for being a close friend of the late Michael Jackson.\n\nHandi said: “It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today. David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon. I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.\n\n“If I may steal the words of one eminent critic, David was a natural star and a genuine celebrity. I will miss him desperately.”\n\nA Metropolitan police spokesman said officers went to the Four Seasons hotel in Canary Wharf, east London, at around 10.15am on Tuesday after receiving reports of an unexplained death. London Ambulance Service staff also attended but he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nGest became a public name when he married Minnelli in 2002, although they separated around 18 months later. He sued her for $10m, claiming she had been violent during their marriage. Minnelli denied the accusations, saying Gest was simply after money. The case was dismissed in September 2006.\n\nGest was due to tour the UK in a musical show called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul, starting in York on 1 July.\n\nThe name was inspired by an incident in the Celebrity Big Brother house when the American reality TV star Tiffany Pollard mistakenly believed Gest had died rather than David Bowie.\n\nChristopher Maloney, who spent time in the Celebrity Big Brother house with Gest, tweeted his condolences on Tuesday.:\n\nFellow housemate Danniella Westbrook said Gest was a “beautiful soul” who she would miss dearly.\n\n“David was like a father to me in the Celebrity Big Brother house. He told me I should be proud of who I am and I was Danniella Westbrook and that was OK,” she said. “He gave me strength every day, he got me and I will never forget him. A shining star who will live in my heart forever.”\n\nNancy Dell’Olio, who also appeared in the show, said: “I am very shocked. I can’t believe it. I spoke to him just a few weeks ago. I felt that something was not right the last time I saw him. It’s very sad news indeed, he will be sorely missed.”\n\nThe former Hollyoaks star Stephanie Davis, another housemate, tweeted:\n\nMyleene Klass, who appeared with Gest in ITV’s I’m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2006, tweeted:\n\nThe American singer Peabo Bryson, who was due to appear in Gest’s show in Bournemouth, tweeted:\n\nGest was behind the widely watched Michael Jackson 30th anniversary special for CBS and produced many American Cinema Awards shows, honouring stars such as Bette Davis, Clint Eastwood, Robert Mitchum, Tom Cruise, Donald O’Connor, James Stewart, Lauren Bacall and Gene Kelly.\n\nFor the last few years, Gest had lived in York, telling the Yorkshire Post in 2014: “It’s my home and the most beautiful place in the world. You look at the minster, the cobblestone streets, the history with the Vikings and the river Ouse running through. It also has the York Hogroast. People come by and see me eating there and I tell them I’m having my turkey and my yorkshire pudding, my stuffing, my crackling, my vegetables and my gravy and I’m loving every minute of it.”\n\nGest grew up in Encino, a wealthy neighbourhood in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. He became involved in the music business when he was a teenager, writing interviews and reviews for newspapers. At the age of 17 he was hired by London Records.\n\n“I said I was 21 and I looked that age because by then I had a beard, moustache and an afro down to my tush,” he told the Yorkshire Post. “They hired me as west coast publicity director and the next year I became national public relations director in New York. I was handling the careers of people like Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, ZZ Top and Al Green.”"
