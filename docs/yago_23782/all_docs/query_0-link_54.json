        "text": "David Gest, best known for his marriage to Liza Minnelli, has died at the age of 62.\n\nThe American reality TV personality and music producer, who was a close friend of the late musician Michael Jackson, passed away at a hotel in Canary Wharf, London, according to his friend and former bodyguard Imad Handi.\n\nIn a statement obtained by BBC News, Handi said: \"It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today.\"\n\nHandi added: \"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.\n\n\"I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.\"\n\nGest famously married actor Minnelli in a lavish ceremony in 2002, with Jackson as his best man. The marriage ended a year later in July 2003 and the couple were divorced in 2007.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his appearances on U.K. reality television shows including I'm a Celebrityâ€¦ Get Me Out of Here! , on which he finished in sixth place. In January 2016, he also took part on Celebrity Big Brother but left the show due to an undisclosed medical condition midway through the series.\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police said it responded to a call from the Four Seasons hotel in Canary Wharf at 10:17am on Tuesday morning, following \"reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s.\"\n\n\"London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. Life was pronounced extinct at the hotel. A post-mortem will be held in due course. Next of kin are in the process of being informed,\" a spokesperson for the police department said.\n\nTributes poured in on social media as news of his death broke. British actor Darren Day, who appeared with him on Celebrity Big Brother , said he was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\nMore tributes continue to be shared by other U.K. personalities:"
