        "text": "Liza Minnelli has denied referring to her ex-husband David Gest as an ‘asshole’ following his death last week.\n\nThe claims were made in Monday’s New York Post by the stage and screen legend’s friend and showbiz reporter Cindy Adams, who was at the couple’s wedding in 2002.\n\nBut a spokesman for Liza said she had not commented on her ex-husband’s death, who passed away at the age of 62 in his suite in the Four Seasons hotel in London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Liza Minnelli has not addressed Mr Gest's passing and any suggestion that she has done so following his death is misleading,” the spokesman said.\n\nHe added that Liza had not spoken to the New York Post journalist recently.\n\nIn her column, Cindy Adams wrote that Liza and David’s marriage “lasted no longer than a colonoscopy. He really was just a gest.”\n\nShe added: “Obits always say the person was wonderful. This guy was unwonderful.\n\n“While he was breathing she wouldn't even speak to him. Now that he's not breathing she wouldn't even speak about him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“My friend Liza told me: 'He's an a******'.”\n\nThe ‘Cabaret’ actress and music producer were married in 2002 at a star-studded event with Michael Jackson as best man and Elizabeth Taylor as maid of honour.\n\nBut their relationship soon soured and just a year after getting hitched David sued his wife for $10 million (£6.9 million) for allegedly beating him during drunken rages.\n\nLiza responded to his lawsuit by suing him for $2 million (£1.4 million), alleging that he had stolen money from her."
