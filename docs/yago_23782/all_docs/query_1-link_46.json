        "text": "MINNELLI: 'I'M SICK OF SEX'\n\ncontactmusic.com\n\nLegendary performer LIZA MINNELLI has declared she is through with sex and just wants to find a partner who is kind and has some integrity. Minnelli split from fourth husband, producer DAVID GEST in 2003 and their divorce is still pending, so the singer insists she won't be racing back down the aisle anytime soon. She explains, \"Look at my track record - I have good taste in friends and lousy taste in husbands.\" The 60-year-old, who has survived addiction problems and two hip replacements, is cautious when it comes to her love life She admits she's \"seeing a couple of people\" but insists, \"I'm sick of sex! I don't give a rat's a**! I care about integrity and kindness.\" Although Minnelli admits to having some regrets over the years she adds, \"They're not enough to slow me down. There's too much to look forward to.\"\n\n31/03/2006 03:04\n\nWell,sex or no sex,the really interesting news about Liza is the release of her 1972 TV special,\"Liza With A Z\",both on DVD and on the Showtime network. A live stage show,directed by Bob Fosse,with so little of Fosse's work available on film,this is an important piece of entertainment history. I'm waiting to rent a copy from our Blockbuster(amazing that they actually brought two copies in the store and yet both have been out since release late last week). I haven't seen this since the first airing almost 35 years ago(on a deeply worn B&W TV)so I can't critique this version,but in it's time this was a TV spectacular right up there with the 'first three Streisand specials,Sinatra's \"Man & His Music\" specials and,yes,Mr. Alpert's Singer specials. As good as Liza's recording output on A&M was compared to the Columbia,the audio version of this special(on Columbia and evidently newly remastered but containing no additional material) has always been the best moment in her checkered career.
