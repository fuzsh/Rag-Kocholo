        "text": "Jim Edmonds\n\nThe only certainty in love and sports? There is no certainty. Few people have lived this truth more intimately than former St. Louis Cardinals star, Jim Edmonds. He’s faced his fair share of heartache and setbacks in the search for true love. Edmonds has walked down the aisle not once or even twice. He’s done it three times!\n\nHis first two marriages were with Lee Ann Horton and Allison Jayne Raski. In October 2014, he married Meghan King – a relationship that looked like happily ever after. But the relationship soured when King accused him of having an affair with their nanny. A messy divorce battle ensued. In 2020, Edmonds found love again with model and real estate agent Kortnie O'Conner.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nDrama seems to follow Nicolas Cage everywhere – from his movies to his tumultuous love life. Marriage is hard, but Cage has still given it a go – five times! He married Patricia Arquette in 1995, their flame burning brightly for six years before fading. Cage swiftly found love again and married Lisa Marie Presley in 2002. The pair filed for divorce just months later. In 2004, the actor began a new chapter with Alice Kim. This one seemed legit, with the couple going strong for over a decade.\n\nSadly, it wasn’t meant to be. Cage surprised fans again by marrying Erike Koike in 2019 – a marriage that lasted a record-breaking four days! In March 2021, Cage tied the knot with girlfriend, Riko Shibata in an intimate Las Vegas wedding. The couple shares one child together.\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor epitomized “Page 3” before the world even had a term for it. This Hollywood icon was more famous for her nine marriages than her career. She first exchanged vows with Burhan Asaf Belge in 1935 before separating in 1941. An unfazed Gabor moved on swiftly to Conrad Hilton. Next came her marriages to George Sanders in 1949 and Herbert Hutner in 1962. Even as she was calling it quits with Hutner on March 3, 1966, Gabor found a new man in Joshua S. Cosden. She married him six days later.\n\nNext up was her marriage to Michael O’Hara and Felipe de Alba. Alba was famously her husband for under 24 hours. In 1986, Gabor finally found true love in Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt. The couple remained together for three decades until her death in 2016.\n\nJennifer O'Neill\n\nJennifer O’Neill knows a thing or two about matrimony and resilience. The Brazilian actor and model has tried it nine times. She was only 17 when she first got married to Dean Rossiter in 1965. They split up in 1971. O’Neill chose to dive head first again into marriage with Joseph Koster in 1972, Nick De Boia in 1975, and Jeff Barry in 1978. The wedding bug got the better of her sooner than you could blink.\n\nShe walked down the aisle with John Lederer the same year she divorced Barry. Richard Alan Brown was her next love, followed by a brief marriage to Neil L. Bonin in 1992. O’Neill’s latest husband is Mervin Disney Louque Jr, and this story is seemingly for keeps. We’ve got our fingers crossed!\n\nMickey Rooney\n\nMickey Rooney famously said that he’s been to a lot of weddings. The catch? All the weddings were his! Rooney had eight wives during his lifetime, and he said he loved them all. There was Ava Gardner in 1942, Betty Jane Phillips in 1944, Martha Vickers in 1949, and Elaine Mahnken in 1952. In 1958, Rooney lived through the gruesome murder of his then-wife, Barbara Ann Thomason.\n\nMercifully, he found healing and love in the arms of Marge Lane. The marriage ended in divorce after 100 days. Rooney and Carolyn Hocket were married from 1969 to 1975. Finally, he married Jan Chamberlin in 1978. Despite an 18-year age difference, the marriage remained rock solid until his death in 2014.\n\nLarry King\n\nThe late Larry King admitted to loving only three women in his lifetime. He said the other marriages were driven by social pressure. So, which marriages (out of the eight) were the real deal? The world will probably never know. He married Freda Miller, his high school sweetheart in 1952. Wife number 2 was Annette Kaye. Not one to give up so easily, King tried marriage again - this time with Alene Akins in 1961.\n\nThey called it quits in 1963, briefly remarrying in 1968 but parted ways for good in 1971. A string of other marriages ensued: Mickey Sutphin in 1964, Sharon Lepore in 1976, and Julie Alexander in 1989. In 1997, he gave matrimony another shot with Shawn Southwick. Despite the marriage lasting a while, they filed for divorce in 2019.\n\nElizabeth Taylor\n\nElizabeth Taylor’s colorful romantic history is the stuff of legend. Her eight marriages probably make up mere snippets of this history. Taylor’s first husband was Conrad Hilton, Jr. Taylor was only 18 then. In 1952, she married Michael Wilding in 1952, despite their significant age difference. Taylor faced a devastating loss when her next husband, Mike Todd, died in a plane crash in 1958. The actor seemingly bounced back, straight into the arms of Eddie Fisher. He was the ex-husband of her good friend, Debbie Reynolds.\n\nTen days after her divorce from Fisher, Taylor shocked fans and peers by marrying her co-star, Richard Burton. The relationship was a roller coaster – with a divorce in 1974, a remarriage in 1975, and a second, final divorce in 1976! After the Burton debacle, the actor found happily-never-after with John Warner in 1976 and Larry Fortensky in 1996.\n\nLana Turner\n\nLana Turner’s life didn’t quite go according to plan. She dreamt of one husband and a brood of seven children. But fate gave her the opposite - she ended up with seven husbands instead! Turner eloped with Artie Shaw in 1939 – a short-lived affair that fizzled out in four months. Turner married Joseph Stephen Crane in 1942 and had his baby. But it turns out he never divorced his previous wife. The cycle of quick weddings and divorce continued for a while.\n\nShe married Henry J. Topping in 1948, followed by Lex Barker in 1953. She wasn’t done yet with numerous trips to the altar – namely, Fred May in 1960, Robert Eaton in 1965, and Ronald Dante in 1969. Wisdom prevailed, and Turner decided to take a break from marriage altogether. She remained single until she passed in 1995.\n\nRichard Pryor\n\nRichard Pryor's comedic genius lives on, even after his untimely death in 2005. But behind all the laughter, Pryor battled demons stemming from a difficult childhood. Broken marriages were a recurring theme in Pryor's life. He walked down the aisle seven times with five different women. The marriages rarely lasted a year.\n\nHe married Patricia Price before moving on to Shelley Bonis in 1967. He then married Deborah McGuire in 1977. In 1981, Pryor wed Jennifer Lee. They divorced after just one year. In 1986, he married Flynn Belaine, only to divorce one year later. In 2001, Pryor married Jennifer Lee for the second time, and they remained together until his death from a cardiac arrest in 2005.\n\nRue McClanahan\n\nRue McClanahan’s romantic history was so eventful, she wrote a book about it! No kidding. McClanahan documents the highs and lows of married life in \"First Five Husbands … And the Ones Who Got Away.\" Her first husband was Tom Bish - a marriage that only lasted a year. She then married Norman Hartweg, but that didn’t work out either. The actress remained unlucky in love for a long time after.\n\nHer marriage to Peter DeMaio lasted seven years. She thought she had found “the one” in Sam “Gussie” Fisher and later, with Tom Keel. When none of these relationships panned out, McClanahan took a break from matrimony, choosing to focus on herself. As it turns out, a little me time was exactly what she needed. She met her soulmate, Morrow Wilson, in 1997. They remained married until her death in 2017.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton\n\nBilly Bob Thornton's reputation for being a ladies’ man in movies spills over easily into real life. He tied the knot five times between 1980 and 2002, each marriage more dramatic than the last. He was briefly married to Melissa Lee Gatlin from 1978-1980, Toni Lawrence from 1986-1988, and Cynda Williams between 1990-1992.\n\nHis next marriage to Pietra Thornton lasted three years. And then came Angeline Jolie in 2000 – a marriage that was so buzz-worthy it reached mythical proportions. After divorce number 5, Thornton openly discussed how marriage wasn’t for him. Still, the actor took another shot at it in 2014, and surprise, surprise! This one endured. Thornton has found love and stability with Connie Angland whom he wisely married after 12 years of dating.\n\nGary Oldman\n\nGary Oldman will always be the inimitable Sirius Black for Harry Potter fans everywhere. And true to form, the actor’s life off-screen has been called “scandalous” by wagging tongues. He’s been romantically linked with several Hollywood legends and married five times. Today he's happily hitched to writer Gisele Schmidt, but love didn’t come easy for the star. His fling with actress Lesley Manville fizzled out between 1987 and 1990.\n\nThen came Uma Thurman, whom he married in 1990. They divorced just two years later. Oldman gave marriage another shot in 1997 with Donya Fiorentino, another marriage short-lived. In 2008, hope arrived in the form of Alexandra Edenborough. That journey reached a dead end in 2015 and his prospects looked bleak until he met Gisele Schmidt.\n\nDavid Foster\n\nMarriage has been quite the adventure for singer and composer, David Foster. Before finding happily ever after with Katherine McPhee, Foster had several hits and misses in his love life. He was married to singer B.J. Cook from 1972 to 1981. When that chapter closed, a new one opened with Rebecca Dyer which, once again, wasn’t meant to be.\n\nFoster next walked down the aisle with Linda Thompson, and they were together from 1991 to 2005. Soon, he found love in the arms of Yolanda Hadid. That union lasted from 2011 to 2017. And even though Foster seems to have found his forever person in Katherine McPhee, he’s also busy defending their 35-year age gap.\n\nRita Hayworth\n\nRita Hayworth epitomizes everything we love about old Hollywood – glamorous, elegant, and seductive. But beneath that iconic image lay a starkly different reality. She was timid and shy, her life and career controlled by domineering men. A string of disastrous marriages plagued her life. She tied the knot with Edward C. Judson from 1937 to 1942. Her next marriage to Orson Welles took the world by storm. He would be her one great love and for a time, it seemed like Hayworth was happy. Yet, this too, was temporary.\n\nAfter parting ways with Welles, she married Prince Aly Khan in 1949, only to divorce in 1953. Not long after, Hayworth said “I do” to actor Dick Haymes. Their relationship took a dark turn after a violent public altercation. Hayworth took another chance on love in 1958 with producer James Hill before divorcing him three years later.\n\nPamela Anderson\n\nPamela Anderson is a self-proclaimed hopeless romantic. Anderson loves love, and traditional marriage. Who can forget her highly-publicized wedding to Motley Crue drummer, Tommy Lee? They famously married within 96 hours of meeting! The couple divorced after three rocky three years together. Anderson walked down the aisle again with musician Kid Rock in July 2006. They split in November of the same year. And it’s been an emotional rollercoaster ever since.\n\nAnderson married Rick Salomon in 2016, but the marriage was annulled in under six months. They gave it another shot, only to divorce shortly after. She then married Jon Peters for what seemed like a hot minute. On Christmas Eve 2020, she married her bodyguard, Dan Hayhurst. They announced their split in January 2022.\n\nKenny Rogers\n\nKenny Rogers might have been a legendary country music star, but he wasn’t always lucky in love. He took five trips down the aisle before finding happiness with his wife, Wanda Miller (they remained together until he died in March 2020). Rogers’ first marriage was to Janice Gordon from 1958 to 1960. Then came Jean Rogers from 1960 to 1963.\n\nWedding bells rang once more when he met Margo Anderson from 1964 to 1976, and again in 1977 when he tied the knot with actress Marianne Gordon. The singer finally found his forever love in Wanda Miller. The couple remained happily married from 1997 to 2020 until Rogers passed away.\n\nJoan Collins\n\nJoan Collins has been happily married to her fifth husband, Percy Gibson, for over 20 years. They met in 2000 while working on “Love Letters,” a play that Gibson happened to produce. In her 2011 memoir, \"The World According to Joan,\" Collins cheekily writes about kissing several frogs in her life before finding her prince. Right. So, who were these men?\n\nThere was actor Maxwell Reed in 1952, but their love story ended in divorce in 1956. Next up was Anthony Newley in 1963. In 1972, she tied the knot with Ron Kass for a bit. Collins then married Swedish singer Peter Holm in 1985. She had no intentions of ever marrying again until she met Gibson.\n\nGeorge Foreman\n\nGeorge Foreman's love life has been complex, to say the least. So complex, that it can sometimes be difficult to keep track. The boxing star is married to his fifth wife, Mary Joan Martelly. The two dated for a year before deciding to get hitched in 1985. Before Martelly, Foreman had been married to numerous other women.\n\nAdrienne Calhoun from 1971 to 1974, Cynthia Lewis from 1977 to 1979, Sharon Goodson from 1981 to 1982, and Andrea Skeete from 1982 to 1985. After the ups and downs in his love life, Foreman has finally found everlasting companionship with Mary Joan Martelly.\n\nJames Cameron\n\nDirector James Cameron’s path to finding love has been a long one, finally leading him to current wife, Suzy Amis. But few people know that the filmmaker has been married four times before. He was married to Sharon Williams in 1978. The couple parted ways with her in 1984.\n\nNext up was his marriage to producer Gale Anne Hurd, a love story that went awry and ended in 1989. Not long after, Cameron fell in love with director Kathryn Bigelow and married her the same year. He then married Linda Hamilton, best known for her appearance in \"The Terminator\" series.\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nMartin Scorsese’s personal life is complex, not unlike the characters in his films. The filmmaker has been married five times. He married Laraine Marie Brennan in 1965, his love from university. They had a daughter together before parting ways a few years later. Scorsese married journalist Julia Cameron, with whom he had another daughter in 1976. This marriage also unraveled.\n\nEnter Isabella Rossellini in 1979, and a three-year marriage filled with love and a shared passion for cinema. But even that wasn’t enough to eventually save the marriage. Scorsese fourth marriage was with Barbara De Fina, which lasted a good six years before fizzling out. He is currently married to Helen Morris and the two share a daughter together.\n\nBilly Joel\n\nIn 2015, Billy Joel (66) tied the knot with fiancée, Alexis Roderick, who was 33 years old. The couple exchanged vows during an annual July 4th gathering, surprising their family and friends. This is Joel's fourth marriage. The musician was previously married to Elizabeth Weber from 1973 to 1982, Christie Brinkley from 1985 to 1994, and Katie Lee from 2004 to 2010. Rumor has it that his ex-wives even provided inspiration for some of Joel's greatest hits.\n\nHe channeled the emotions from past and present relationships as songwriting material. Which ones? There are hidden references to his relationships in cult favorites such as “Piano Man,” “She’s Only A Woman,” and “Uptown Girl,” among others!\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nFrank Sinatra, or Old Blue Eyes, sang beautifully about love and romance. Women everywhere were smitten, including the four who became his wives. Sinatra's first wife, Nancy Barato, stood by him when they were poor and still struggling. He swiftly married kindred spirit and actor, Ava Gardner, only a week after his divorce from Barato.\n\nSinatra's career ironically turned into shambles after he married Gardner. When Sinatra met Mia Farrow years later, she was only 19 and a virgin. They got married in a flash! And although Sinatra's longest-lasting marriage was with Barbara Sinatra (his last wife) he always held a special place for Nancy, his first love.\n\nMelanie Griffith\n\nMelanie Griffith has long moved on from her three ex-husbands. But she has only wonderful things to say about Don Johnson, Steven Bauer, and Antonio Banderas. The Working Girl actor is still close with her ex-husbands. She and Johnson were briefly married in 1976, after which she tied the knot with Bauer in 1981. They had a child together before divorcing in 1989.\n\nThe two even reconciled in 1989 and welcomed their daughter Dakota that same year. But the relationship ended in 1996. That same year, Griffith found love with Banderas. After nearly twenty years together and raising their daughter, the pair separated in 2014.\n\nGeena Davis\n\nThe wonderful Geena Davis of “Thelma & Louise” fame has had several great loves over the course of her life. The actor was married four times. Each relationship was as impactful as the other. Her first marriage was to director Richard Emmolo from 1982 to 1983.\n\nWhen that relationship turned sour, Davis fell in love with actor Jeff Goldblum. The pair were married from 1987 to 1990. Davis’ search for love soon led her to director Renny Harlin, whom she was married to for five years. Her most recent marriage was to surgeon Reza Jarrahy. The relationship lasted from 2001 to 2017.\n\nLiza Minnelli\n\nLiza Minnelli makes no bones about her life choices, especially her many marriages. Her list of ex-husbands includes Oscar-winning songwriter, Peter Allen, and producer and director, Jack Haley, Jr. There was also Mark Gero, a sculptor. She thought she had found the one with producer, David Gest. Like her previous marriages, this one wasn’t meant to be.\n\nIn 2010, Minnelli sat down for a tell-all with Oprah Winfrey. She believed she had made changes for her husbands, only to later realize that she hadn’t been true to herself. Minnelli didn’t reveal much more. Still interested in the tea? The Netflix series “Halston” depicts certain aspects of her relationship with Jack Haley, Jr.\n\nBarbara Walters\n\nMost people know Barbara Walters from \"The View\" or \"20/20.\" The journalist has also interviewed the cream of entertainment royalty, including Oprah Winfrey and Tom Cruise. Besides her outstanding journalistic work, Walters was equally famous for her intriguing personal life. She enjoyed the single life for most of her later years. But not before trying to find wedded bliss four times with three men.\n\nHer first marriage to Robert Henry Katz ended in an annulment within a year. She married Lee Guber in 1963. The marriage ended in a divorce in 1976. She married Merv Adelson twice, first from 1981 to 1984 and again from 1986 to 1992.\n\nChristie Brinkley\n\nSupermodel Christie Brinkley once said she would be willing to put her busy life on hold for the right guy. Fast forward to today, many men have come and gone. Her life remains busy (she’s an independent momma of 3)! And she looks as youthful as ever still! Brinkley’s been married four times to different guys: Peter Cook, Richard Taubman, Billy Joel, and Jean-François Allaux.\n\nTrue love has eluded her. But the \"Parks and Recreation\" actor says she enjoys dating. She’s candid about her views on marriage, namely, that she now finds no reason for it. Marriage and having kids go hand in hand for her. And since she’s not planning to have any more, why complicate things? Word to the wise!\n\nLisa Marie Presley\n\nIt wasn’t easy being Lisa Marie Presley – life in the public eye, a family name to uphold. Her love life attracted more attention than others by virtue of who she was. The late Elvis Presley's daughter had a string of unsuccessful marriages until her death in January 2023, at age 54. Presley first married musician Danny Keough in 1988. They had two kids together during their six-year marriage: daughter Riley Keough and late son Benjamin Keough.\n\nFollowing her divorce from Danny, she was briefly married to the late Michael Jackson in the 1990s – probably her most high-profile romance ever. They were the subject of salacious gossip or raised eyebrows at the very least! In 2002, she was married to Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage for three months. Her fourth and last marriage was to Michael Lockwood, with whom she had twin daughters, Harper and Finley Lockwood, before their divorce in 2016.\n\nMadonna\n\nMadonna believes that getting married \"both times\" had never been a good idea. Madonna married Sean Penn in 1985. Both stars were still young in Hollywood, head over heels in love. She even dedicated her third album, “True Blue,” to him. Their relationship lasted four years before the singer filed for divorce in 1989.\n\nIt took over a decade for Madonna to say \"I do\" again, this time to English filmmaker Guy Ritchie. Madonna filed for divorce in 2008 after an eight-year marriage. She once said that if she hadn't been an artist, she would have wanted to be a teacher. Such is her love for kids.\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nKim Kardashian might be dating again but she’s not settling down again anytime soon. Kardashian's love life has dominated headlines since the early 2000s. She’s been married thrice: the first to music producer Damon Thomas, the second to former NBA player Kris Humphries (the infamous 72-day marriage), and the third to rapper Kanye West, from whom she divorced in 2021. They have four children together.\n\nShe’s blissfully single as of September 2022, stating that clearly, she’s doing something wrong in the relationship department. Her next tryst? The star imagines she might look for love with someone whose life is away from the spotlight.\n\nBritney Spears\n\nBritney Spears's most recent marriage was to Sam Asghari and lasted about a year. But this isn’t her first rodeo – it’s her third, in fact! Her first marriage was in 2004 to childhood buddy Jason Alexander. The couple unexpectedly got hitched after a week of wild partying in Vegas. Their marriage lasted a record 55 hours before Spears got it annulled. Rumor has it that she went out dancing to celebrate after. She made news again later that year when she became engaged to Kevin Federline.\n\nThe two met on the dance floor of a Hollywood bar. Not one for conventions, Spears later proposed to Federline on her private jet. The pair then shocked their closest friends and family at their Studio City home with a surprise wedding celebration. The guests were completely blindsided. The couple divorced three years later.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nThe media has been obsessed with Angelina Jolie's love life over the years. After her divorce from Brad Pitt in 2016, Jolie shared in an interview that she felt “stronger” after, especially for her kids. Jolie has been married twice before. She met her first husband, Jonny Lee Miller while filming \"Hackers.\" They were together from 1996 until 1999. Her next big relationship was with Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nSoon, they began making headlines for outlandish displays of passion, including putting vials of each other's blood around their necks. They were married from 2000 until 2003. Jolie met her third husband, Brad Pitt on the set of “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” in 2005. Their love story and marriage immediately became a media sensation. They divorced in 2016.\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nDrew Barrymore may have loved and lost several times over. But she still considers herself a \"hopeless romantic.\" She’s been married three times and engaged twice. Barrymore's first marriage, to Jeremy Thomas, lasted from 1994 to 1995. She then married actor Tom Green in 2001. Their marriage ended in under a year.\n\nBarrymore was married to Will Kopelman from 2012 until 2016, and despite their divorce, they are still devoted to co-parenting their two girls, Olive and Frankie. But good news. She recently revealed she is on a dating app, reportedly with the most adorable profile photo. Barrymore says it took her some time to get to this stage after her divorce from Will Kopelman.\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck finally got their happily after in 2022. And it’s been a long road for both stars. Lopez was first married to Ojani Noa in February 1997. They met in a Miami restaurant where Noa worked as a waiter. When Jennifer's career took off with the release of “Selena,” the relationship fell apart. The pair split up in 1998.\n\nLopez then married dancer and choreographer Cris Judd on September 21, 2001.

She married singer James DeBarge in 1984. Jackson was only 18 and later acknowledged that part of her decision to marry was to escape her overbearing father.
