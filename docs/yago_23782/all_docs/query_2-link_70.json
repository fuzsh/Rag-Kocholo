        "text": "A multiple award-winning legend, Liza Minnelli moved beyond the long shadow cast by her mother, Judy Garland, with an accomplished and prolific career of her own. The daughter of Hollywood royalty, it came as little surprise when Liza followed in her mother's footsteps. Already a Tony-winning Broadway performer, Minnelli won an Oscar for her role as bohemian chanteuse Sally Bowles in \"Cabaret\" (1972) and followed with the Emmy-winning \"Liza with a Z\" (NBC, 1972) television special. Her marriage to singer-songwriter Peter Allen ended in 1974, and would be just the first of Minnelli's romantic relationships with men rumored to be homosexual. It was Allen who penned the Oscar-winning theme song to Minnelli's next film, the comedy classic \"Arthur\" (1981), starring Dudley Moore. Although beloved by fans, the vulnerable performer suffered from addictions to alcohol and pills, much as her mother had, eventually seeking rehab for her issues. Ever the survivor, Minnelli continued to record and perform, reaching a new generation of fans with the concert special \"Liza Minnelli Live from Radio City Music Hall\" (PBS, 1992) and again with a hilarious recurring role as an over-sexed socialite on the acclaimed comedy series \"Arrested Development\" (Fox, 2003-06). Still going strong, she made a triumphant return to Broadway in the Tony Award-winning \"Liza's at the Palace...!\" in 2008 and continued to perform live for her devoted fans. After more than 50 years on stage and screen, Minnelli had truly earned her reputation as one of the greatest entertainers of all time."
