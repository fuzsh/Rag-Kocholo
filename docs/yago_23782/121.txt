David Gest, the American producer perhaps best known for his five-year marriage to Liza Minnelli from 2002 to 2007, has died at the age of 62. He was found Tuesday morning at the Four Seasons Hotel in London at the Canary Wharf by his friend and longtime bodyguard Imad Handi, but as of yet no cause of death is known. Gest had been diagnosed with a tumor in his neck back in 2012, but he was expected to have made a full recovery, and it’s unknown if the tumor was ultimately related to his death.

Ironically, Gest was just about to embark on a British theater tour called “David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul,” based on a misunderstanding during a recent stint on UK Celebrity Big Brother, in which American reality star Tiffany “New York” Pollard confused David Bowie’s death with Gest’s passing. Gest eventually left the house early for undisclosed medical reasons.

Perhaps even more ironically is that Gest wasn’t the only one looking to profit off of the mix-up, and in the wake of his passing, Pollard was forced to remove “David Is Dead” T-shirts from her online store referencing the hilarious goof. (Uh, did anyone remember that David Bowie actually had died? Inconsequential.)

This comes after beloved comedian Garry Shandling passed away shortly after filming an episode of Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee called “It’s Great That Garry Shandling Is Still Alive,” so I think the takeaway here is never makes jokes about your mortality or anyone’s else’s, ever.
