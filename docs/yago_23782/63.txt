Liza Minnelli got married for the fourth time Saturday night in New York, to producer David Gest, before a guest list of 1500 that included A-list, (Liza with a) Z-list, and everything in between. The bride wore a Bob Mackie-designed white gown, whose long train was held by best man Michael Jackson until maid of honor Marisa Berenson remembered her duties and picked up the slack. At the altar, at the Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue, Liza danced, Jacko moonwalked, and Natalie Cole sang ”Unforgettable.” The ”Love Boat”-worthy ensemble ranged from Anthony Hopkins, Michael Douglas, Elton John, Diane Sawyer, and Barbara Walters to Elizabeth Taylor, Phyllis Diller, David Hasselhoff, Robert Goulet, Robert Wagner, Gina Lollobrigida, Janet Leigh, Carol Channing, Lauren Bacall, Tito Jackson, Petula Clark, Tony Franciosa, and Kirk Douglas. Even Cindy Adams, the New York Post gossip columnist who was one of the bridesmaids and is no spring chicken herself, called the event the ”night of 1,000 facelifts” and likened the guest list to ”the commissary at 18th Century Fox.” ”This was one of the most thrilling weddings I’ve ever been to,” said Mickey Rooney, who’s been to many, nine of them as the groom.

Minnelli and Gest met when she appeared at the Jacko tribute concerts he produced in New York last September, along with a roster of Hollywood golden-agers that resembled the wedding guest list. It’s the fourth marriage for Minnelli, 56, and the first for Gest, 48. The couple plan to honeymoon in Thailand, followed by a concert tour of Europe for the bride.
