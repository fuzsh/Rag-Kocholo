        "text": "MARK KIRK, Republican\n\nIn a year when a restless electorate was ready to listen, Mark Kirk had a lot to talk about as he introduced himself to Illinois voters. There was his service in the Navy Reserve, his 10 years in Congress, his views on key issues.\n\nKirk was the kind of moderate Republican who might have walked away easily with Barack Obama’s former Senate seat.\n\nBut his record of exaggerating here, waffling there and sometimes just not telling the truth means Kirk has wound up running not only against Democrat Alexi Giannoulias but also against himself. Kirk has chosen to fall silent about parts of his life, especially his military service.\n\nThe result is a nearly deadlocked race in which the lauded Naval Reserve officer’s trustworthiness is being weighed by voters in the same way as his opponent’s involvement in his family bank’s dealings with convicted felons.\n\nKirk, 51, admits he has made mistakes and said things that weren’t true, but he denies any pattern. Despite repeated questioning, he never has publicly explained why he embellished.\n\n“I made a mistake and then apologized,” Kirk said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Going forward, the question we have and the choice we make as to who our senator is has a lot less to do with what happened in the 20th century and a lot more with what’s happening in the 21st century.”\n\nVulnerable to trust question\n\nGiannoulias isn’t about to let the issue go, however. He mentions trust at every opportunity, often pressing Kirk to flatly state whether he came under fire during flights over Kosovo and Iraq — a claim Kirk used to make, but has abandoned.\n\n“Why, with this record, would you not tell the truth? Why would you make all this stuff up?” Giannoulias asked Kirk in a televised debate two weeks before the vote. “Congressman, it’s a simple question: Were you shot at or not?”\n\nKirk never answered.\n\nKirk was born in Champaign and grew up in the comfortable Chicago suburb of Kenilworth but really found his place in Washington.\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell and then getting a master’s degree from the London School of Economics, Kirk landed a job working for Republican Rep. John Porter, his hometown congressman in a moderate district north of Chicago. Kirk rose to become Porter’s chief of staff, while also earning a law degree from Georgetown University and signing up for the Navy Reserve. He also worked at various times for the State Department, a Washington law firm and the House International Relations Committee.\n\nHe married but divorced in 2009 after eight years.\n\nFive terms\n\nWhen Porter stepped aside, Kirk ran for his seat and is now serving his fifth term. He also has climbed to the rank of commander in the reserves, where he is an intelligence officer occasionally assigned overseas, including to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nKirk initially was seen as a nearly ideal Republican candidate in a Democratic-leaning state. The only controversy was his vote for “cap and trade” environmental legislation, which many Republicans loathed, and Kirk quickly changed his position on the issue before the primary election.\n\nBut after he secured the nomination, the Washington Post reported that one of Kirk’s major laurels — being named the Navy’s intelligence officer of the year — was false. A unit Kirk led earned a similar honor, but Kirk himself didn’t get the award -- although he had been claiming it for years.\n\nThat led to a string of other revelations about Kirk’s claims, as almost every detail of his resume was questioned.\n\nHe said once that he ran the Pentagon war room, an exaggeration of his real duties. He or his staff had mentioned him serving in the first Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq, which was incorrect. He had spoken of coming under fire as a passenger on military flights, but he stopped making those claims when pressed for details.\n\nInstead of mentioning his military service at every opportunity, Kirk had turned a major political asset into a potential liability.\n\nQuestions about other parts of his life started popping up, too.\n\nHis experience as a teacher, which he said gave him insight on the dangers of guns in schools, turned out to be a part-time job as a nursery school assistant and one year at a private school in London.\n\nKirk’s accounts of a dramatic sailing accident as a teenager, while true in general, contained some details that didn’t add up. He talked about standing on his capsized boat and watching the sun set as he awaited rescue. But records show he was rescued in mid-afternoon.\n\nGlowing reviews\n\nPeople who have worked with Kirk often give him glowing reviews.\n\nMilitary fitness reports he has released show Kirk’s commanding officers praising him as a “go-to guy” with “unlimited potential.”\n\nAl Pate used to run a Veterans Administration hospital in Kirk’s district that was targeted for closure. He said Kirk came up with the idea of saving the hospital by combining it with a facility for Navy personnel and then he fought for years to make it happen.\n\n“He never wavered in his vision. And it was tough sledding,” Pate said. The Lovell Federal Health Care Center opened Oct. 1.\n\nIt’s not clear that Kirk’s embellishments would affect any future work in Washington. Alan Dixon, a former Democratic senator from Illinois, said other senators would not hesitate to work with Kirk.\n\n“They accept the judgment of the voters,” Dixon said.\n\nBut trust is an issue for Kirk not just because of what he has said about himself but because of the positions he has taken — and changed — in Congress.\n\nIssue consistency\n\nConservatives look at his vote in favor of cap-and-trade, his record of supporting abortion rights and his decision to back federal bailout legislation, and they conclude Kirk doesn’t represent their interests. Even though he has backed away from some of those positions, they wonder whether Kirk will stick with them after the election.\n\n“What do you truly believe? That is the question that people wonder,” said state Sen. Chris Lauzen, an Aurora Republican who has not endorsed Kirk.\n\nKirk also faces criticism from the left.\n\nAfter consistently opposing abortion restrictions, he took anti-abortion positions while preparing his run for the Senate last year. He also voted against ending the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy despite a generally strong record on supporting gay rights.\n\n“He really just completely changed his stripes,” said Terry Cosgrove, head of the abortion-rights group Personal PAC. “I’m so disappointed in him.”\n\nKirk rejects any suggestion that he has tried to reinvent himself for political purposes. He said he remains “a fiscal conservative, a social moderate and a national security hawk” as well as someone who studies issues carefully.\n\n“I think the first mark of leadership is to listen,” Kirk said. “If you truly listen, you may come to a new view.”\n\nIn brief\n\nMark Kirk, 51, Republican\n\nHome — Highland Park\n\nFamily — Divorced, no children\n\nEducation — Law degree, Georgetown University; master’s in economics, London School of Economics; bachelor’s in history, Cornell University.\n\nExperience — Elected to Congress in 2000; had previously served as counsel to the House International Relations Committee and as a staffer at the State Department; chief of staff for U.S. Rep.

Even the White House courted another Democrat for the job.\n\nBut Giannoulias pushed ahead — eventually winning the nomination and the embrace of national party leaders — in what some call a mark of the drive that also characterizes his style on the basketball court, where he likes to have his hands on the ball and admittedly doesn’t pass as much as he should.\n\nGiannoulias attributes his ambition to his Greek family’s immigrant background and some of his success to a lucky sense of timing.\n\n“There’s a certain drive to do things and to work hard and to succeed but, you know, again, this is less about me, I think, than other people and helping other people,” he said in an Associated Press interview, noting that Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan have ascended from their Illinois-based jobs to top Washington positions.\n\n“I just think it’s an opportunity that doesn’t come up too often,” he said.\n\nBrief resume\n\nGiannoulias’ critics attack him for his inexperience, his failed family bank’s deals with criminals and problems with the college-savings program he oversaw as treasurer.\n\nIn what has been an exceptionally negative campaign, Republicans scoff at the idea Giannoulias is ready for the U.S. Senate. They argue he’ll follow the White House and other Democrats in Washington, rather than push ideas of his own.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, the Republican running against Giannoulias, refers often to what he calls the Democrat’s “rapidly disappearing resume.”\n\n“I think that our records have no comparison,” Kirk said.\n\nBut timing could again work in Giannoulias’ favor. At least partly because of Kirk’s admitted embellishing of his own resume, he and Giannoulias are nearly even in the polls.\n\nBorn in the U.S. to Greek parents, Giannoulias played professional basketball for about a season in Greece and was a regular in pickup games with Obama before he went to the White House.\n\n“When the pressure’s on, he wants the ball,” said Duncan, former head of the Chicago Public Schools and another pickup game regular. “Once he’s in, he’s going to do what it takes to win. He’s going to outwork you, he’s going to out-hustle you, he’s going to out-think you.”\n\nWhen Giannoulias was elected Illinois treasurer in 2006, at just 30 years old, he touted his experience working as an executive at his family’s Chicago bank. But in the Senate campaign, his financial background has been a drag, and he has tried to distance himself from its troubles. The bank failed earlier this year, and questions linger about its business practices, which included loaning money to criminals.\n\nPushed ethics\n\nGiannoulias burst on the political scene in 2006 when he beat the Democrats’ party-backed candidate to win the primary in the treasurer’s race and then went on to easily beat the Republican in the general election.\n\nA major accomplishment during his tenure has been signing an executive ethics order for his office banning “pay to play politics,” the kind of quid pro quo shenanigans Illinois is known for. Under the order, banks, office employees and contractors were prohibited from contributing to his campaign fund.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. John Fritchey said Giannoulias also supported efforts to pass broader restrictions on political contributions from state contractors.\n\n“It would have been easy for Alexi to make noise and not do anything about it,” Fritchey said.\n\nBut Giannoulias’ time as treasurer has been overshadowed in the Senate campaign by the Bright Start college-savings program. The program lost about $150 million in one of its investment options, although Giannoulias recovered about half that money from the firm overseeing the investments.\n\nKirk has accused Giannoulias of misleading families about the fund and has questioned whether taxpayers should trust their money with him as a U.S. senator.\n\nGiannoulias told the AP he followed the advice of financial experts, even though he saw early signs of trouble with the fund. Some experts have said Giannoulias acted responsibly and sounded the alarm about the firm managing the fund, which also had losses in other states.\n\nBank failure\n\nStill, his family’s Chicago bank failure has been Giannoulias’ biggest hurdle as he tries to persuade voters he’s qualified to represent them in Washington.\n\nGiannoulias rose through the ranks at the bank, which was founded by his late father more than 30 years ago. He was vice president when he won his state office four years ago.\n\nGiannoulias has said the bank was in sound financial shape when he worked there, but regulators shut down Broadway Bank in April.\n\nKirk says the bank failure should cast doubt on Giannoulias’ judgment. Kirk’s campaign has labeled Giannoulias a “failed mob banker,” and Kirk rips Giannoulias for some of the bank’s business practices, including lending money to criminals and convicted political insider Antoin “Tony” Rezko, who had close ties to ousted former Gov. Rod Blagojevich.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune has reported the bank lent about $27 million to two convicted criminals, much of it after Giannoulias became an executive at the bank.\n\nGiannoulias staunchly defends his family’s business, but tries to distance himself from the questionable borrowers.\n\n“Is it easy to cherry pick a few customers out of thousands, out of thousands, and make a nasty political ad? Absolutely,” Giannoulias told the AP. “But any business owner will tell you that running a business is not a straight line and mistakes are made, and inevitably, unfortunately, sometimes you do business with people you never wish you would have.”\n\nAlexander “Alexi” Giannoulias, 34, Democrat\n\nHome: Chicago\n\nFamily: Single, no children\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree from Boston University.
