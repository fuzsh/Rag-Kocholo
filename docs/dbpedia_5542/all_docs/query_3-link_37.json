        "text": "The Commission’s final report, America’s Languages: Investing in Language Learning for the 21st Century, was influential with federal policymakers. It inspired the Congressional Caucus on American Languages and the World Language Advancement and Readiness Act, which included a competitive grant program to support local and state school districts seeking to expand world language learning. The grant program was incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. The report was used in deliberations over several other bills to support native language programs, expand study abroad opportunities, and recognize student language proficiency. The report was cited in Congressional “Dear Colleague” letters in defense of federal funding for Title VI education programs and Fulbright-Hays Fellowships, in Congressional testimony before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, and by the U.S. Department of Education’s International Strategy, “Succeeding Globally Through International Education and Engagement,” issued in November 2018.\n\nOn college and university campuses, the Commission’s report inspired curricular reviews and is providing an intellectual foundation for the Lead with Languages public campaign organized by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. Media coverage included an op-ed by former Secretary of Defense and Director of the CIA Leon Panetta in the San Francisco Chronicle and discussion in publications such as The Hill, Inside Higher Ed, Boston Herald, Washington Times, The Conversation, and Language Magazine.\n\nTo further advance the Commission’s recommendations, the Academy convened the America’s Language Working Group. The group includes representatives of language and learned societies, education advocacy organizations, government agencies, and international business. The Working Group’s outreach and follow up focuses on four goals: dissemination of the Commission’s final report; a call to action, “Bridging America’s Language Gap,” endorsed by nearly two hundred leaders and institutions from a variety of sectors; creation of a website to highlight successful, scalable language initiatives around the country; and planning a future conference of funders to strategize new investment in language education.\n\nLearn more about the Commission on Language Learning’s influence:"
