        "text": "Being attorney investigators isn't the typical legal career path... Most people think of lawyers battling with opposing counsel or persuading juries in Perry Mason-style dramatic gotcha' moments. The OIG practice is decidedly different. That's one reason why we enjoy celebrating when our team members are recognized for their good work! So, it's a pleasure to announce that for the second year in a row Vida L. Thomas and Gorev Ahuja have been selected for inclusion in the 2024 Northern California Super Lawyers and the Rising Stars lists (respectively), both of which are issued by Super Lawyers, part of Thomson Reuters. Our roles as impartial investigators, mediators and assessors are to serve as neutral parties, uncovering the truth behind claims of inappropriate behavior in workplaces, schools and other organizational settings. We are often called to mediate disputes between co-workers or to provide training and coaching to reduce instances of bias, harassment and other troubling behavior. Most of us didn't go to law school with this particular career trajectory in mind, but we love spreading the word about this alternate path for working within the legal field. Hopefully, seeing our lawyers recognized alongside the many others who made this year's list, will help bring additional visibility to what we consider a fascinating and satisfying option for more up-and-coming attorneys. Congratulations, Vida and Gorev! #OIGlaw #WorlplaceInvestigations #CareerAlternatives #LoveWhatYouDo\n\nIn this throwback photo, I stood in my black court robe, a symbol of my beginnings in the legal profession. This image captures more than just a moment in time; it represents the foundation of my journey. Once dedicated to the intricacies of law in the courtroom, my path has since evolved, leading me towards my true passion for law reform and corporate governance. As I reflect on this transition, I'm reminded of the importance of embracing change and pursuing what genuinely drives us. The shift from practicing law to focusing on reform and governance has not only been a professional transformation but also a personal revelation. It has allowed me to contribute to the legal field in a more impactful way, advocating for changes that not only improve the sector but also society at large. This journey underscores the belief that our careers are not static; they are dynamic, shaped by our passions, experiences, and the lessons we learn along the way. Let this be a reminder to all professionals that it's never too late to pivot towards what truly fulfills you.\n\nExploring the impact of lateral moves made during the bustling years of 2021 and 2022 reveals a complex tapestry of success and challenges. Success for laterals isn't merely about landing a new position; it's about thriving, integrating effectively, and contributing to their new firm's growth. It raises important questions for lawyers: Have your goals aligned with the outcomes of your move? Are you leveraging your skills to their fullest potential in your current role? Lateral Link specializes in navigating these pivotal career transitions, offering a strategic lens to identify opportunities that align with your expertise and your professional goals. If you are considering your next career step or evaluating the success of a recent transition, I am happy to share insights into how strategic moves can enhance your legal career. https://lnkd.in/e4VE4NBS\n\nDear young lawyer, When/if you choose to begin your practice right after law school or NYSC, you've opted for a journey that may take a bit longer. Know this and know this peace! During this phase, it's crucial to avoid unnecessary arguments and comparison with other lawyers or being swayed by naysayers, even if their feedback seems constructive. Instead, focus on putting in the hard work and refining your skills and knowledge. Find your advantage! At this point it advisable to find your niche and streamline your focus. Take inspiration from successful lawyers who have paved the way before you. There are lawyers who have done and are doing well Stay flexible and open to opportunities that come your way. Most importantly, be prepared to put in the effort, focus,amplify on socials, give it time and remain willing to learn and grow. I have learned that Naysayers aren't always individuals who dislike you. More often than not, they are people influenced by their biases, journey,privilege and experiences, and that's perfectly understandable. Be discerning! Much love, Bernice #younglawyer #fashionlaw\n\nI spoke with another attorney yesterday who is considering a potential job offer and opportunity at becoming a law firm owner. He was introduced to me through a mutual friend. The job would be a big change, involving a move to a different city and switching from in house to private practice. I had never met this attorney before, and had no preconceived opinions about the firm that was courting him. During our conversation it became pretty clear that he had some reservations about the opportunity. Since I had gone through the process of becoming a partner at my last firm, I was able to be a sounding board for him and raised some issues that he hadn’t thought about before. We ended the call with him getting the clarity he needed. I am so glad that my friend thought of me, and decided to connect me with this attorney. Something in his gut didn’t feel right about the job. This wasn’t purely a professional decision, and it rarely is. The move would put him much closer to family, which is highly important to him. He was searching for someone who could speak from experience, but also to provide a neutral opinion from the outside. I think he got that from me. A takeway for law students and young lawyers: be relentless in seeking information from those who have more experience than you when weighing career decisions. And be willing to go outside of your circle for that advice. Ask for meetings. Leverage your network. Take advantage of this platform. The worst that can happen is someone says no or doesn’t respond. By and large, I’ve found that attorneys are more than willing to share their perspective to help someone along in their career journey. It’s how the profession should work.\n\n💡Many lawyers feel stuck; as if their careers lacked direction. They lose sight of what drew them to law in the first place. They feel like there is no purpose within their legal career. 💡But purpose is not a destination, it is a journey of self-discovery. 🎥Watch as our co-founder, Ryan (Ra) James, explains this concept further. 💪At the (re)purpose law course we equip lawyers to reflect on what their values and passions are so that they may find their ideal niche within the legal landscape. 💪We want lawyers to turn their purpose into action by leveraging their individual skills for a cause they deeply care about. 💪We want to empower lawyers to contribute meaningfully to a better society through the power of law. 👇Don’t settle for a career that leaves you feeling uninspired. (Re)purpose your legal career and ignite your impact by joining us for our next cohort on the 24th of June 2024 by clicking the link in the comments! 👋We look forward to sharing the course with you!\n\nRecently, I had the amazing opportunity to participate in Gibson Dunn’s Insight Day, and it was truly enlightening! Firstly, we were warmly welcomed by a partner who shared fascinating insights about the firm.Established in 1890, Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher is not only one of the largest but also one of the oldest firms, which was incredibly inspiring to learn firsthand. Throughout the day, I engaged in insightful discussions with the panel, gaining valuable insights into the firm's diverse practice areas and daily operations. Exploring topics from corporate law to litigation, I was deeply impressed by their commitment to excellence and innovation. One of the highlights for me was learning about secondments and their crucial role in professional development within the legal field.Understanding how secondments provide unique learning opportunities and broaden perspectives affirmed my career aspirations in law. Moreover, the Insight Day deepened my understanding of the legal industry and reinforced my dedication to pursuing a career in law. I am particularly grateful for the chance to learn from industry leaders and for the inspiring discussions that have fueled my passion. Moving forward, I am excited to apply these insights to my future endeavors. They have provided me with a clearer vision of the legal profession and equipped me with invaluable knowledge that will undoubtedly guide my career path. Thank you, Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, for this invaluable experience. I look forward to leveraging these insights as I continue to grow and develop in my legal journey. #GibsonDunn #LegalInsights #CareerDevelopment #LawFirmCulture #ProfessionalGrowth\n\nIntelligence and knowledge are two distinct concepts. If you lack the latter, it can be remedied. The former, well not much you can do about that. Fortunately, in my job I often speak to very intelligent people who have managed to complete law degrees. But not all of them have found themselves in workplaces where they can reach their potential and gain the knowledge needed. If you: • find yourself longing for more challenging work and be among the best partners; have you thought about moving up to a top-tier firm? • are already at a top-tier firm and feel like you have plateaued in your development; have you considered going internationally to work on larger deals in a different jurisdiction? Think about where you and whether this will get you to where you want to be. If not, do you stay longer or do you move to get the experience that you want?
