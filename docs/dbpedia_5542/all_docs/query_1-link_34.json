        "text": "Alumni Spotlight: Brad Urschel ’79\n\nBradley V. Urschel ’79 was the quintessential scholar-athlete. He was class president and captain of the football, basketball, and track and field teams. He still holds multiple school records in track and field.\n\nIn 1979, he finished 2nd at the US Junior Championships and 4th against the Russian Junior Team in the Decathlon. He went on to Princeton University where he excelled in the classroom, as well as in football and track and field.\n\nBrad was training for the 1984 Olympic Trials when he was involved in a traffic traffic accident. In the years since, he has fought to overcome paralysis, memory loss, and other disabilities. Throughout his ordeal, Brad has maintained his infectious positivity and zeal for life. Since the accident, Brad has maintained a close connection with his classmates and the School, including mentoring athletes as an assistant coach.\n\nIn recognition of his athletic achievements and ongoing work, St. Mark's renamed its annual interschool track and field tournament the Bradley V. Urschel Track & Field Invitational. The BVU, as it's known, continues to this day and has welcomed more than 1,400 athletes to campus.\n\nBrad's journey was chronicled in a 2010 issue of The Pride alumni magazine."
