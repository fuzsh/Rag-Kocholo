I began my career studying Criminal Justice at Bowling Green State University. Shortly thereafter, I was a Probation Officer for five years. During this time, I supported many through the process of probation and found my passion for advocacy. As a Probation Officer, my philosophy was simply to inspire people to do better in life, rather than violate them, which often came with jail time. Discovering the passion of advocacy led me to law school. In law school, I participated on the Trial Advocacy Team. This experience taught me how to present a case and advocate for a client in court. I continue to draw on that experience as a real life attorney. Cleveland Marshall College of Law taught me how to read and interpret law, a skill that I offer clients in hopes of helping them fight through the complex legal system. Although I can’t promise to win every case, I can promise to fight for my clients!\n\nE. Mark Young co-teaches the Mediation short course with Russell O’Rourke of of Meyers, Roman, Friedberg & Lewis.
