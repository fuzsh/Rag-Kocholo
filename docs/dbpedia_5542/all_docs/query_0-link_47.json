MAZZANT, III, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS; ROBERT LEE PITMAN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS; AND ROBERT WILLIAM SCHROEDER, III, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS ---------- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2014 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Dick Durbin, presiding. Present: Senators Cornyn and Cruz. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DICK DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Senator Durbin. The Judiciary Committee will come to order. We will consider five highly qualified nominees to the Federal bench. They are Jorge Luis Alonso, who has been nominated to be a District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois; John Robert Blakey, also nominated for the Northern District of Illinois; Amos L. Mazzant, III, nominated for the Eastern District of Texas; Robert William Schroeder, III, also nominated for the Eastern District of Texas; and Robert Lee Pitman, nominated for the Western District of Texas. At these hearings, it is traditional for nominees to be introduced before the Committee by Senators from their home States. I will note that the Ranking Member will soon join us. We are going to proceed with introductions. I am going to start by introducing Jorge Alonso from Illinois, and then turn to my colleague, Senator Mark Kirk, who will introduce Jack Blakey. My colleagues from Texas, when they arrive, will make their introductions. I am pleased to introduce Judge Jorge Alonso before this Committee. Judge Alonso has been nominated to fill the vacancy in the Northern District of Illinois that will be opening up on November 16, when Judge Ronald Guzman takes senior status. Since 2003, Judge Alonso has served as an Associate Judge for the Cook County Judicial Circuit. Currently in his third appointed term, he presides over felony cases at the Cook County Criminal Court Building. As a State trial court judge, Judge Alonso has presided over hundreds of cases that have gone to verdict or judgment, including at least 88 jury trials. He also presides over the Women's Justice Mental Health Call in Cook County. Judge Alonso helped to create this program and it provides intensive support and services to women in the justice system who have suffered from trauma and addiction. Prior to serving as a State court judge, Judge Alonso served for 12 years as an Assistant Public Defender in Cook County. He initially handled civil proceedings in the Child Protection Division of the Public Defender's Office, and later worked in the Juvenile Justice Division and the Felony Trial Division. As a public defender, he participated in approximately 30 jury trials and 150 bench trials. In addition to his substantial courtroom and judicial experience, he has an admirable record of service in the Chicago community. Among his activities, he serves on the boards of the Daniel Murphy Scholarship Fund, providing scholarships and support to low-income Chicago students, and the Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood. He also works as judicial interviewer with the Lawyers Assistance Program, which assists members of the bar who are struggling with mental health or addiction issues. Judge Alonso received his undergraduate degree from the University of Miami and his law degree here at the George Washington University Law School. To put it simply, Judge Alonso is an outstanding nominee. He has the experience, the integrity, and the judgment to be an excellent Federal Judge. In Illinois, we have a bipartisan process which Senator Kirk and I have initiated to select judicial candidates and send their names to the White House. Under the system, I recommended Judge Alonso for the Federal bench. I thank my colleague, Senator Kirk, for signing a blue slip signaling his support for that nomination. Judge Alonso has a few more supporters in the audience. I think I will let him acknowledge them when he comes to the table, but we are glad that the entire family is here today. I am going to turn to my other colleagues to introduce nominees and since Senator Kirk was not only prompt, but early, I am going to recognize him at this point. Senator Mark Kirk. PRESENTATION OF JOHN ROBERT BLAKEY, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, BY HON. MARK KIRK, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Senator Kirk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am here to recommend and to thank you and President Obama for bringing forward Jack Blakey. I am going to focus on Jack Blakey because it is a twofer. We are getting Jack and his dad. His father, Robert Blakey, worked for Senator McClellan of Arkansas in the late 70s and wrote the RICO Statute. If there is any State in the Union that needs experts on RICO, it is Illinois. I just would thank you for having--I would say with Jack Blakey we are putting a guy on the bench who is an experienced Shakespearean actor who even performed in London--90 trials all the way to the end, including bench and jury trials. He is working for Anita Alvarez in a very senior leadership position in Cook County, Illinois, a place you would know very well. With that, I will conclude then. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Durbin. Senator Kirk, thank you very much. Mr. Blakey, thank you for being here and you will have an opportunity to introduce your family when you are called. The other nominees are from the great State of Texas. Who is here to speak on their behalf but Senator John Cornyn. Take it away, Senator. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN CORNYN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I like the way you said ``Great State of Texas.'' We agree. I want to thank the Chairman for convening this hearing. We have before us five nominees for the Federal bench, three of whom have been nominated to fill vacancies in Texas. I want to congratulate each of those nominees and their families for this great honor. I know you traveled a long way and endured a lot of paperwork and other scrutiny to get where you are. I want to just introduce these three nominees briefly. Magistrate Judge Amos Mazzant is a fixture in the bar in Sherman, Texas in the Eastern District. He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh and Baylor Law School, and remained in Texas after that. From 1990 to 1992, Judge Mazzant clerked in Sherman for U.S. District Judge Paul Brown. Since then he has made his legal career there, including serving for the last 5 years as a Federal Magistrate. If confirmed, Judge Mazzant will serve in the courthouse named for Judge Brown. Robert Pitman is our U.S. Attorney in the Western District of Texas. He has graduated from Abilene Christian University and University of Texas Law School, and then clerked for a Federal Judge. Before assuming his current role, Mr. Pitman served for many years as a Federal Prosecutor and Magistrate in the Western District. He has earned accolades for his work at every level, as well as the support of the local bar. I was proud to support Robert for U.S. Attorney, and I am proud to support him for the nomination at the Federal bench. Trey Schroeder is a litigator in private practice in Texarkana, Texas. I understand he is not a native Texan, but we have always taken converts and people who got there as fast as they could. He graduated from the University of Arkansas and American University's Washington College of Law. Since then he has had a distinguished career, including work in the Office of the Counsel to President, and as a law clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He is currently a partner at Patton, Tidwell and Schroeder, and his reputation in Texarkana is stellar. Each of these three nominees are lawyers of the highest caliber and the kind of individuals who should serve on the Federal bench. That is no surprise because like your process, Mr. Chairman, we have a bipartisan Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee that has scrutinized these nominees and done an outstanding job in making these recommendations to Senator Cruz and myself, and working with the White House to get these nominations where they are today. The FJEC, as we call it, is a bipartisan blue ribbon panel of some of the best lawyers and judges in the State of Texas. They provide input on applicants to the Federal bench and we work closely with the White House, as I said, to ensure that the nominees in our State are the kind of men and women who deserve the honor of these important jobs and lifetime tenure that goes along with it. I want to thank our volunteers who serve on the FJEC and the White House Counsel's Office for their work with our offices on these nominations. I am proud of the work that the FJEC has done and the quality of these nominees. I look forward to hearing from all of them. Thank you. Senator Durbin. Thanks, Senator Cornyn. I will ask the staff to put the name tags before the chairs so each nominee will see where they are to approach in just a moment. For the record, all of these nominees have gone through an extensive process, an application, which is voluminous and then review by committees in Illinois and Texas in this circumstance. They have answered scores and scores of questions about their background. So if the questioning today is brief, it is not an indication that we think there is little to be asked. A lot has all ready been asked and answered. We will start by asking the nominees to each approach the table and stand for a moment while I administer the oath customary of the Committee. Raise your right hand. Do you affirm the testimony you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Judge Alonso. I do. Mr. Blakey. I do Judge Mazzant. I do. Mr. Pitman. I do. Mr. Schroeder. I do. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Let the record reflect that all five of the witnesses and nominees have answered in the affirmative. We are going to give each of you a chance to say a few words by way of opening, and start with Judge Alonso. STATEMENT OF HON. JORGE LUIS ALONSO, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS Judge Alonso. Thank you, Senator. I would like to start by thanking the Committee, the entire Committee for convening this meeting. I would like to thank the Chairman, the Ranking Member, and I would also like to thank you, Senator Durbin. I would like to thank you for presiding and chairing today. I would also like to thank you for your gracious introduction, as well as, of course, for your recommendation and all of your support. Of course, I would like to thank President Obama for this incredible honor of the nomination. I do have family with me here today, as you alluded to. I have my wonderful wife here, Amee Alonso, of 15 years. My amazing daughters are here, Lila, Ursula, and Lulu. They are here. They are in eighth grade and sixth grade, and they have sacrificed a couple of days to be here. I have got my mother here from Florida, Ursula Alonso, and I would like to thank her for being here. I am so happy she is here. And I would like to thank her for her support, her guidance throughout all of these years. I would be remiss if I didn't mention my father. We lost my father some years ago, Pedro Alonso, but I would like to have his name inserted in the record. And he would be thrilled to be here, as thrilled as my mother is and the rest of my family. Also here from Arizona are my wonderful in-laws, Robert and Rosemarie Orlick. He is a retired engineer and a Korean War Veteran. I have family that couldn't make it here today that is watching on the webcast and supporting me. I would like to acknowledge my brother, Jose Alonso, who is an attorney in Florida; my sister and her family, Dr. Susanna and Steven Barski, and their wonderful daughters, Elia and Emily. And in Arizona I have my sister-in-law and her family, Drs. Kathy and Douglas Little. He is also a Colonel in the National Guard and they have four wonderful children, Christopher, the oldest that we are all very proud of, and the rest, AJ, Alexandra, and Brendan who, of course, we are also proud of. I would also like to just acknowledge all the support back in Chicago, back home from my legal family, all of the hardworking professionals that I have been fortunate enough to serve with over the last 10 years, plus all of my fellow judges in Cook County, all of the hardworking lawyers, and all of the other individuals that have always supported me, clerks, sheriffs, court reporters, interpreters, probation officers. Thank you very much. [The biographical information of Judge Alonso appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Thank you, Judge. Mr. Blakey. STATEMENT OF JOHN ROBERT BLAKEY, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS Mr. Blakey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for presiding today.

MAZZANT, III, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS Judge Mazzant. Thank you, Senator, and I want to thank the Committee for convening the hearing. I want to thank the President for the honor of this nomination. I want to thank Senator Cornyn for his kind introduction, as well as both Senator Cornyn and Cruz for recommending me to the President. And I want to thank the Senators Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee for recommending me to the Senators. I have a large number of family that made the trip here today. If you will indulge me, I will introduce them. The love of my life, my wife Michelle of 24 years. She is a kindergarten teacher in Sherman. My daughter, Caitlin would have loved to have been here, but she is starting her freshman year at Texas A&M and is watching via the webcast. My younger daughter, Alex is here. She is missing high school. She is a junior at Sherman High School. My sisters are here, Cynthia Mazzant and Jim Colbert. My younger sister Kristina Mazzant-Thorpe, and my nephew Zach. My brother-in-law, Sam, is watching via webcast, as is my niece, Taylor, who is also in college. My father would have loved to have been here, but he and my stepmother, Amos and Cookie Mazzant, are watching via the webcast in Florida. And my brother Matt is--hopefully--he said he would get up to watch from California, early. We will see if he did or not later. I have wonderful in-laws. They are here, Jeanne and Bill Melfi; my brother-in-law, Todd and Melissa Melfi. My wife's aunt Rosemarie Melfi is here. My wife's Uncle Donnie and Aunt Jackie Melfi are here as well, as well as her cousin Marilyn Coleman. I also have some of my staff members here, Terri Scott, my judicial assistant, as well as Debbie McCord, my courtroom deputy and my career law clerk is watching via the webcast. I have a number of lawyer friends that actually showed up too, and I will just say their names really quickly, Alienne Durrett, Bret Johnson, Kimberly Preist-Johnson, Roger Sanders, Clyde Sigman, Judge Carol Sigman, all from Sherman or Dallas, as well as Jim Carter who is from here in Washington, DC. I would also like to acknowledge the judges of the Eastern District who have been so supportive of me in this effort. I want to acknowledge my mother who passed away 13 years ago, but is here in spirit. And then finally, I would like to just recognize Judge Paul Brown who was my mentor and hired me as a law clerk and changed my career 24 years ago, and we have several other law clerks here that are in attendance. And I thank you. [The biographical information of Judge Mazzant appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. Mr. Pitman. STATEMENT OF ROBERT LEE PITMAN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS Mr. Pitman. Thank you Chairman Durbin, Senator Cornyn. I appreciate this opportunity to appear before you today. I especially would like to thank Senator Cornyn for his generous introduction and for his longstanding support. I would like to thank both Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz for submitting my name to the President. And, of course, I would like to express my appreciation to President Obama once again for the proud honor of a nomination. The opportunity to serve as U.S. Attorney has been the greatest honor of my life, and I am humbled beyond words now to be considered for appointment to the bench. I would like to acknowledge several family members and friends who are with me here today. Joining me today is David Smith, on whose support, and encouragement, and wisdom I have relied for over 20 years now. Of my four brothers and sisters, one is with me today, my eldest brother, Tim and his wife, Echo. The youngest of five kids, I owe much to the guidance and love--albeit sometimes tough love--of my elder siblings and I appreciate so much their support throughout the process. Echo's daughter, Rebecca Beyer, has joined us from New York today. I am also very honored to have today supporting me, several friends who have come from Texas. They are really like family to me, and they have supported me, again, throughout this process, John Dalton and Marilyn and Lex Henderson. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to recognize, for the record, the outstanding men and women of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Texas with whom it has been my honor to serve and who I believe represent the very best of public service. Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity to appear today. [The biographical information of Mr. Pitman appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Mr. Pitman, would that include your first assistant? Mr. Pitman. That does. My first assistant--for the record, his name is Richard Durbin. [Laughter.] Mr. Pitman. Senator, I figured with a name like that, I couldn't go wrong. Senator Cornyn. No relation, I hope. [Laughter.] Mr. Pitman. He is a graduate of the University of Chicago. Senator Durbin. Mr. Schroeder. STATEMENT OF ROBERT WILLIAM SCHROEDER, III, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS Mr. Schroeder. Thank you, Senator Durbin, for chairing the hearing today and for giving me the opportunity and the privilege to be here. Thank you, as well, Senator Cornyn for being here today. I want to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley for scheduling the hearing as well as the other Members of the Committee for considering my nomination. I would like to begin by thanking President Obama for nominating me for this position. I am humbled by it. I am grateful to you, Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz for recommending me to the President and for your support and the support of your staffs throughout this process. Thank you, Senator Cornyn, for your kind and generous words today. I would also like to thank the Senator's Bipartisan Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee for considering my application and for its support of me as well. I am fortunate today to be joined by my family and I would like to introduce them. My parents, Mary and Bill Schroeder are here. Just last month, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. They are two of the finest, hardest working people I know, and I owe so much to both of them for their love and support. My mother-in-law, Nancy DeLamar, the best mother-in-law one could hope for, and I am glad that she is here today. My daughters, Eleanor and Francis are here. Their birthdays were last week. They turned 15 and just started as freshmen at Texas High School in Texarkana. Their mother and I are very proud of them and the fine young women that they are becoming. I would be remiss if I did not also tell you that they are both excellent soccer players. Finally, my wife, Megan--we were married 20 years ago this summer. And as Senator Cornyn sometimes says about himself, Megan is a recovering lawyer herself and I can assure you that she is the smartest lawyer at our house. She is my best friend and the love of my life. I also have a couple of friends that I would like to briefly acknowledge. My lifelong friend, Brad Davis, came from Little Rock and I am glad to have him here. We have been friends for more than 45 years. One of my law partners, Kelly Tidwell, is here with his son, Hutch, who is a tenth grader, also at Texas High School. And I am glad that they were able to make the trip. I also have several longtime friends from Washington who were able to be here today, and I thank them as well. And finally, friends, other family members, and colleagues from back home watching on the webcast. I appreciate their support. And my thanks to all of you and I look forward to answering your questions. [The biographical information of Mr. Schroeder appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Thanks, Mr. Schroeder. I am going to ask a generalized question to start with. I am going to acknowledge the obvious. None of you would be sitting here today if you didn't have the appropriate legal credentials and experience. And now you are aspiring, for most of you, to a new position in life, at least at the Federal level, to be a judge. In that position, you are going to be called on to use that legal expertise, that experience, in a different way. My experience--in the distant past when I practiced law--was that you were looking for two things when it came to a judge, the right temperament and fairness. I have had a chance, having served here for a few years, to interview a lot of people aspiring to the Federal bench, even to the Supreme Court, and I have found it interesting how many of them would come before me and say, ``Ignore what you read about what I have done in the past. That really has nothing to do with what I will do in the future. I am going to go right down the center stripe of the highway. I used to be left-handed all of my life. I can be right-handed too. I can do whatever it takes to make sure that we apply the law fairly and accurately and so forth and so on.'' Most of the time as I observe their records afterwards it, it turns out to be less than truthful. What we are today is what we were and what we learned in our life experience. So I would like to ask each of you--for three of you there is a life experience as a defender, as a prosecutor, and other experiences. You have been in courtrooms, all of you, many times in the fray representing litigants, prosecuting, defending, some clerking for the judges who are observing this process and trying to come to a fair outcome. I would like to have each of you comment on these two basic ideas of temperament in judges and fairness, what you have observed and the standard you would hold yourself to. Judge Alonso, start. Judge Alonso. Thank you, Senator. In terms of temperament, Senator, what I have tried to do over these past 11 years is I have always tried to make sure that I am kind and respectful to everyone that appears before me, litigants, attorneys, all of the parties. I try to practice restraint at all times. It is my sense that as judges we have to control the courtroom, but I feel that if you can't control your own emotions, it is very, very difficult to control the courtroom or the emotions of other people that appear in front of you. It is my feeling that they take their cue from you as the judge in the courtroom. I try always to be humble and I also try always to be patient. I think that is a very important trait. I think only when we are patient can we make sure that everyone feels like they have had their say and have been heard. Senator Durbin. Mr. Blakey, your background is largely as a prosecutor. And to put it in context, if I am an impoverished criminal defendant, minority, standing before you as my judge, do I have a chance? Mr. Blakey. Thank you for the question, Senator. Of course. As a public servant for over 20 years, having done both criminal and civil, having done prosecution and some criminal defense issues, some issues with respect to being a law clerk, I have always been committed--no matter who my client was--to the rule of law. And if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would bring that to the bench and I would have not only the temperament to apply the law fairly and to give dignity to each person who came into the room, I would do it impartially. I would never put my finger upon the scales of justice for any party, whether it be the government or any particular litigant. I would listen. I would be humble. And I would be patient because in humility and patience and listening comes very good results. It allows a person not only to know that they have been heard, but that they have been understood. Senator Durbin. Mr. Mazzant, I don't know the judges that you have clerked for and worked with, but you have certainly observed it from that side of the courtroom. What are your thoughts on this? Judge Mazzant. Thank you, Senator, for the question. I have had a great role model with Judge Paul Brown. He epitomized what a good judge would be, followed the rule of law, had a great temperament, treating everyone with respect. When I became a judge 10 years ago, and I served both as a State judge and a magistrate judge for the last 5 years--I followed that example, following that rule of law and treating everybody that came before me with respect and fairness. And if I am lucky enough to be confirmed, I would follow that same pattern. Senator Durbin. Mr. Pitman, as a U.S. Attorney, tell me how you view your future role on the bench. Mr. Pitman. Senator, having been an Assistant State's Attorney and now a U.S. Attorney, I have certainly had the role as an advocate, but I have made this transition before from being an advocate to being a United States Magistrate Judge. Making that transition from prosecutor to being a judge, although it is a shift, it is somewhat different than being another kind of advocate that goes to the bench because a Federal prosecutor has the obligation of being an advocate, but also of doing justice. And so I think because that has been an added dimension of the job that I have had throughout my career as an advocate, I have appreciated the fact that a big part of that job was to be a gatekeeper and to watch out for people's rights even if they were on the other side of the docket. I did that, I believe, successfully when I made the transition to be a United States Magistrate Judge. And I pledge to you that I will understand the difference between being an advocate, and I will understand that as a judge I will need to be not only an impartial and neutral arbiter, but to be seen and perceived as that. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Schroeder. Mr. Schroeder. Thank you for the question, Senator Durbin. I have had a diverse legal career. I had a couple of years clerking for Judge Richard Arnold on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which was an amazing experience for me. He had a profound commitment to the rule of law, and I learned so much from him about the importance of preparation and the importance of hard work, the importance of being kind and courteous to litigants and counsel. I had a few years working in the executive branch here in Washington, and I have had 15 years of private practice in Texarkana. My experience and the judges in both State and Federal court that I have appeared before that I most admired were well prepared, thoughtful, careful, people of modesty and humility who recognize their role in the process and who recognize that their role as the judge was an important role, but a limited role. And their job and obligation was to carefully consider the facts and apply the law to the facts of each case, approaching each case fairly, impartially, and with an open mind. And that is the kind of judge I would try to be. Senator Durbin. Thank you and I find it interesting how many of you have used the word ``humility.'' Humble is one of the first words that comes to mind when you say ``United States Senator.'' [Laughter.] Senator Durbin. We have a lot to be humble about, I guess. I acknowledge the presence of Senator Cruz and I will recognize him immediately after Senator Cornyn. Senator Cornyn. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Schroeder, you mentioned the fact that I was a recovering lawyer, and as you know, I also spent 13 years on the State bench, so I admit to being a recovering judge as well. [Laughter.] Senator Cornyn. I agree 100 percent with what Senator Durbin said about we are all a product of our background and upbringing and probably what we will do in the future--the best indicator of that is what we have done in the past, but I also would want to stress what some of you have acknowledged is that your role as an Article III Federal District Judge is different from any role that you have held in the past. I know for the three nominees from Texas, you have gone through a very extensive vetting process, FBI background check, you have got public records that have been examined closely and, as we said, to the FJEC's bipartisan evaluation. I feel like I know a lot about each of you, and it is because of the confidence that I have that I was very comfortable recommending to the President each of you be nominated for these positions. So I don't have a lot of questions, but I just want to ask each of you--my experience has been that what litigants want, what people who come into court want are basically three things. They want somebody who will listen, somebody who will treat them respectfully, and somebody who will follow the law. I will start with you, Mr. Alonso, and we will go down the line. Would each of you agree with that or disagree? And if you agree with it, will you do it? Judge Alonso. I agree with it. I think that is a great top three. There are many skills that are necessary and that come into play, but that is a great start, very important traits. I have tried over the last 11 years to operate exactly that way, and so happily in my case, you have my assurances, of course, that I will continue to do that. Also we have, hopefully, the evidence of the job that I have tried to do over these last 11 years as a judge in Cook County. Senator Cornyn. Thank you. Mr. Blakey. Thank you, Senator. Yes, I agree with you emphatically. I believe that listening is perhaps one of the key ones that you mentioned. Listening and engaging the attorneys to find the critical legal and factual turns of a case is critically important not only in getting a good result, but getting the nuance of the result and the basis for the result correct and for avoiding unjust results or unnecessary costs or delay. So I agree with you completely. Judge Mazzant. Thank you, Senator. I agree with you wholeheartedly and that is something that as a judge for the last 10 years, as the magistrate judge sitting in Sherman for the last five, that is what I try to do every single day with every case, to follow those three precepts you set out. Mr. Pitman. Senator, of course, I do agree with that. I would add that it has often occurred to me as a judge and someone who has practiced in Federal court all of my career, that with life tenure comes a reciprocal obligation to treat people respectfully, to have a strong work ethic and then to respect the law because you are the face of the justice system. And I pledge to you that I will do as I have done previously in my career and be the judge that you have described. Mr. Schroeder. Thanks for the question, Senator Cornyn. I do agree with that and that is exactly the kind of judge I would hope to be. Senator Cornyn. If there was one other trait I would mention, it would be patience. Because some of you have alluded to the fact that with life tenure, sometimes people lose their patience. They develop what is commonly called in the profession ``robotis,'' which is a dangerous disease that judges sometimes get. When you don't have to stand for election, and you are basically insulated from the kind of accountability that most other public officials have, sometimes that can lead you down the wrong path. But I feel confident based on the knowledge that I have that certainly the Texas nominees--I take the other nominees at their word that they will do those things, listen, be respectful, follow the law, and hopefully demonstrate patience and not develop that dreaded case of ``robotis.'' I just have one other question for all of you. I would like to go down the row again. As a trial judge, do you believe that is your responsibility to follow binding precedent by the Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, or do you feel like you have some license or authority to make new law as a lower court judge? Judge Alonso. I feel that it is the job of the trial judge to be bound and to follow the precedent that is set out by, in our case if I was fortunate to be confirmed, the Seventh Circuit and, of course, the Supreme Court of the United States. Mr. Blakey. Yes, Senator, Federal courts are very important courts, but they are courts of limited jurisdiction and they have a role to play within divided government, and part of that is that each member of the judiciary plays its role within the framework that the framers have laid down. And binding precedent and the authority of a superior court is critical to the functioning of the judicial system. I agree completely. Judge Mazzant. Thank you, Senator. I also agree with my fellow nominees. As a magistrate judge, I am bound by the authority of the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court and that is what I do every day in my job currently. Mr. Pitman. Senator, I do believe that is the role of a district judge to follow precedent, and I pledge to you that if confirmed, I will adhere to the precedent of the Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit as I engage in the activities of judging. Mr. Schroeder. Senator, I likewise agree. I think following precedent is what brings stability and predictability to our legal system and our system of justice and I would be strictly bound by the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit. Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield to Senator Cruz who has joined me in making these recommendations for the three judges from Texas to the President. Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, let me congratulate each of the five of you on your nominations. I would note for the three nominees from Texas, that as Senator Cornyn made reference, you have been through a vigorous process beginning with extensive review and interviews by the Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee which is a bipartisan committee that Senator Cornyn and I have formed together consisting of some of the most highly respected lawyers throughout the State of Texas in a variety of fields of practice, geographically diverse, and consciously bipartisan to reflect that the bench is not supposed to be a partisan endeavor. Upholding the rule of law and taking the oath as an Article III judge requires a degree of confidence, a degree of fidelity of law that should cut across party lines. So I want to commend each of the three of you from Texas because you would not be here had each of you not very much impressed the members of that committee and had you not very much impressed both Senator Cornyn and myself. We have had the opportunity to visit with all three of you. You have impressive professional credentials and a long career demonstrating the fidelity to law that we expect from our judges. It is obviously a unique and critically important responsibility that we entrust upholding the law to a relatively small number of men and women who take an oath to do so. What I would like to ask each of the five of you is a couple of questions. The first of all, simply how would you describe your judicial philosophy? Judge Alonso. Thank you, Senator. I would describe my judicial philosophy as always being open-minded, fair, patient, always listening until the end, always making sure that I am not guessing what is going to come next. I wait with an open mind and I exercise my judgment fairly and evenhandedly. Mr. Blakey. Thank you for the question, Senator. I would characterize my philosophy as a devotion to the law, a devotion to the role that we play in society, that limited role, but important role. In a variety of contexts, a great deal of power is given, and to those who are given power, much is expected. And I would apply law to the facts presented and I would do it impartially with a great deal of hard work. Judge Mazzant. Thank you, Senator, for your nice remarks about the Texas nominees. My judicial philosophy is one that I am bound to adhere to the rule of law, that I am going to impartially consider the facts of the case, apply precedent to those facts, and make a decision without any regard to any personal views or feelings I might have. And that is what I have done as a magistrate judge. Mr. Pitman. Senator, at the risk of repeating, I will reiterate that I believe that the judicial philosophy appropriate for district judge is faithful adherence to the rule of law and to the precedent of the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit. And I assure you that that is the philosophy that I will follow as a district judge if confirmed. Mr. Schroeder. Thank you for the question, Senator. I think that the role of the judge is to fairly and impartially decide cases with the impartial application of the rule of law. As I said before, I think that the role of the judge is limited. It is important, but limited. Judges don't make law. They decide concrete disputes in front of them, one case at a time with attention to the facts and the arguments of the parties, and by applying the law and precedent to those facts. And that is the type of judge I would hope to be. Senator Cruz. Thank you, gentlemen. Let me ask one additional question. Again, to all five of you, which is how would you define judicial activism and how would you characterize the responsibility of a judge to avoid engaging in judicial activism? Judge Alonso. Thank you, Senator. I think that an activist judge would be a judge who does not understand his limited role. I think it is a judge who has an agenda, shall we say, a judge who is deciding a case based on what he or she wants the case to be about. The opposite of that is a judge who exercises humility, who understands this limited role, and who understands that he or she has to decide the issues that are necessary to resolve the dispute that is before that judge at that time. Mr. Blakey. Thank you, Senator. I would define activism, judicial activism as a judge who has not only stepped out of his role as my colleague mentioned, which I agree with fully, but someone who has turned the law to their own purpose rather than serving the purpose of the law. A very smart person can achieve any result if they are willing to give up their service to the law, and I think that is what activism is. You should serve the law, not vice versa. Judge Mazzant. Thank you, Senator. I don't disagree with anything that my fellow nominees said, but I would just add that the simplest way is a judge who makes decisions based on what they feel should be the result is judicial activism. That is not what I would adhere to as a judge, and I will always follow the rule of law, and am bound by that precedent. Mr. Pitman. Again, Senator, at the risk of simply reiterating and repeating, I do understand that term to mean a judge who injects his or her personal beliefs or political agenda into the decisionmaking process. I believe that that is not the role of a judge, and it is not the mode that I would employ in interpreting the law or in engaging in my other duties as a judge. Mr. Schroeder. Thank you, Senator, for the question. I agree with what my fellow nominees have said. I think one way to avoid that result is by focusing on the narrowest issues in the case and deciding the case as narrowly as possible and not deciding things that don't need to be decided. Senator Cruz. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Durbin. Gentlemen, I would like to ask a question in the second round. From the beginning of this nation, the drafting of the Constitution, we have grappled with one fundamental issue, many, but this one recurs. The issue of race and justice in America--a Constitution which acknowledged slavery, a nation which as recently as a few weeks ago in Ferguson, Missouri was reminded that it is still a challenge in this modern America despite all the progress that has been made, all the effort that has been put into it. You are seeking an opportunity to serve as a member of the Federal judiciary. It is likely that many of the criminal defendants who come before you will be minorities. It is also likely that many of them feel that this system is rigged against them. Statistics in the past--and they do go back a few years, so they may have changed some--suggest, for example, that out of the 12 or 15 percent minority population in this country, when it comes to arrest for drug crimes, it is 35 percent. When it comes to incarceration for drug crimes, it is 60 plus percent minorities who are being incarcerated. How do you view--and I know you cannot address any specific case, but how do you view this issue in terms of your responsibility and if you wish to step out a little further, and my responsibility on the legislative end of it, when it comes to dealing with establishing or in some cases restoring a sense of fairness in our system of justice when it comes to minorities? Let me start with Mr. Schroeder. This applies as well to Illinois as well as Texas, so I am not singling out any State. It applies to all of us. Mr. Schroeder. Thank you, Senator, for the question. I think you do it one case at a time. I think you approach every case impartially and with an open mind, and you seek to do justice in each case. I think that it is very important that the way you run your courtroom makes clear to everyone that it is a place where everyone is going to be treated fairly and that people who come into the courtroom without regard to their race or their gender or their socioeconomic status or their station in life, that they are going to get a fair shake. Senator Durbin. Let me take this to another level. You may find it incredible that Senator Cruz and I would find agreement on a basic issue, but we have on the Smarter Sentencing Act. In that situation, we are trying to make sure that the mandatory minimum sentencing under the Federal law gives judges more discretion in a specific category of cases, drug offenses that don't involve guns, gangs, or violence, to give more latitude. One of the things that inspired me to move in this direction was the judiciary, judges who came back after applying our laws to their case and saying, ``Senator, this is not fair. It is not just.'' They stepped out of their role as strictly judges and became, at least, commentators on the state of law. So I ask you do you think that is part of your responsibility? Mr. Schroeder. Senator, thank you for the question. I think it is your responsibility to understand the impact that any individual result or judgment has in a case, and I think it is important for you to try to treat everyone fairly and impartially and obviously, I do not have great experience in the criminal field. I have handled 15 to 20 cases over the years. I did a fair amount of work in criminal cases when I was a law clerk and I certainly understand the importance of uniformity in sentencing and I think that is an important goal to be achieved. Senator Durbin. Mr. Pitman, you have had to live with these laws that we've passed here and apply them as a prosecutor. What are your thoughts on this issue of race and justice? Mr. Pitman. Well beyond just that, Senator, I will say that as you know, the Attorney General has proposed and implemented the Smart on Crime Initiatives within the Department. And one of the goals of that is to make sure that we are reserving--the very serious sanctions made available to us under statutes passed by Congress are reserved for the most serious offenders and to scale the tools that we have at our disposal to make sure that the law is enforced. Getting back to your question about the profile of some of the defendants that we deal with, one of my practices as a magistrate judge was before I went out onto the bench, I considered the fact that even if it was a very--what to me was a very routine and perhaps not something that was going to be on the front page of the paper, for the person standing there, it was the most important thing in the world and that it deserved my full attention. So I would make every effort not only to go out and be fair and impartial and to treat everyone the same regardless of their background, but to make sure that they felt that way and they got the message from me that I was taking their problem and their situation seriously. And I will continue to do that if confirmed. Senator Durbin. Judge Alonso, as a criminal judge in Cook County, you have faced many criminal defendants. You know what I am talking about on this issue of race. Judge Alonso. Yes, I do, Senator. I think that in essence, we always have this tension between wanting uniformity across the system in sentencing, but we also want to make sure that the judge has discretion. So at the system, we look at all of these cases and we try to figure out what category they fit in, but it really is an impossible task. Every defendant in a criminal case is different. Every case is different factually. So it is always a challenge to remember that, to treat every case as the most important case and not one of 400 cases, but just that case. I think it is important to have discretion and to trust the judge to exercise that discretion within certain limits, and it appears to me that the recent adjustment in the Federal sentencing provisions lands in a good place, starting with the guidelines, but moving from there and giving more discretion to the judges. I think it is important. I think also that we see across the system more and more talk about restorative justice and helping courts, or problem solving courts. And when we have sentencing provisions that don't allow us to take advantage of that in a situation where we can identify a specific problem and we actually think we can make a difference in this person's life, both to help the defendant and to help us as a society so that there is not recidivism, which is what we are trying to stop. I think it is important to make sure that judge's hands are not handcuffed and that the judge does have discretion in those situations to give the appropriate sentence. Senator Durbin. Mr. Blakey, I recently attended an Innocence Project dinner in Springfield, Illinois where formerly incarcerated people spoke. They had been found to be innocent and had been incarcerated for long periods of time, unjustly. One of them, African American, said, ``They sat me down and they said if you don't plead to this crime, here is what you face. You face the possibility of a mandatory sentence and it is stiff, and you are going to face a jury that may not be friendly to an African American defendant. So do you want to roll the dice here, or would you rather plead to a lesser offense and get this behind you?'' And the man said, ``I have no choice.'' He went to jail for something he had not done. Have you run into this? What are your thoughts on this circumstance? Mr. Blakey. Senator, that is a horrific story and a failure of the role of a prosecutor to be a fair administrator of the law and to do so impartially. I also think it is important in a prosecutorial role to be vigilant with respect to race disparity and the way the criminal justice system is run. In fact, as a Federal prosecutor and as a State prosecutor, I have devoted much time to police corruption and civil rights violations and have done a lot of work in that area. And it is important to do that and to assess each case on an individual basis and have a fresh look and an individual assessment so that each individual is only charged with what they have done and that as a prosecutor that your just sentence is the only sentence that is going to be adhered to. Senator Durbin. Mr. Mazzant, your thoughts on this issue? Judge Mazzant. Thank you, Senator. As to the issue of mandatory minimums, naturally in my purview as a judge, I am not sure that is part of my job, but if this august body would change the mandatory minimums, I will enforce the law as you all change that, if that is changed. As to how I deal with anyone who comes before the court, as a magistrate judge, I do handle the pretrial criminal. So I do all of the initial appearances and the motions prior to trial. I make sure--and my goal would be that anyone who comes before the court, by the time they are finished, they feel they got a fair treatment before the court. And that is what I would try to do. Senator Durbin. I thank you very much. I know there is no easy answer to the questions I have been asking. It is a challenge to us on this side as it is to those on your side of the table to restore that sense of justice and feeling of fairness in our courts across America. We have a lot of work to do. I thank you all for being here today, thank your families for attending at this hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The record is going to remain open for a week. There may be some additional information asked of you or questions sent your way and I hope you can respond in a timely fashion. I thank you all for being here today and the Committee stands adjourned. [Whereupon, at 10:52 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Additional material submitted for the record follows.] A P P E N D I X Additional Material Submitted for the Record [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] NOMINATIONS OF ALLISON DALE BURROUGHS, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS; JEANNE E. DAVIDSON, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE U.S. COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE; HAYWOOD STIRLING GILLIAM, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA; AND AMIT PRIYAVADAN MEHTA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ---------- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2014 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Dianne Feinstein, presiding. Present: Senators Grassley and Lee. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. I would like to welcome everyone to this nomination hearing. There are two big announcements today. Today is the 227th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution in the United States in 1778. So it is a big day. It is also a big day for this Committee because the Ranking Member on my right--it is his birthday. [Applause.] Senator Grassley. Thank you. Senator Feinstein. And the rumor mill has told me a story. On every birthday he runs to the Capitol, and it is six miles. This morning--and I am not going to tell you his age because we are very close. [Laughter.] Senator Feinstein. Well, I am not going to tell you his age, but he ran the six miles. That is what really deserves a round of applause. [Applause.] Senator Feinstein. Now we will get down to business. I am pleased to welcome Eleanor Holmes Norton from the House of Representatives to be with us today. Let me make just a brief introduction and then call upon the Ranking Member. We have today three nominees to the United States District Courts, one of them from California, as well as a nominee to the Court of International Trade. So I would like to ask Senator Grassley to make his opening statement and then we will go to those introducing the nominees and then we will go to the nominees. Senator Grassley, happy birthday. Senator Grassley. Thank you very much. Elizabeth Warren sent me a letter yesterday. Senator Feinstein. Oh, she knew. Maybe you are the source of the rumor. Who knows? [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. Anyway. I have no opening statement. We do not believe, at this point, any of these nominees are controversial. You never know until you get through all of these hearings and go through all of the papers and stuff, but right now it looks like no controversy. That is why I do not have an opening statement. Senator Feinstein. Okay. We will go to introductory statements, and if I may if you are not in a rush, I would like to recognize the presence of the Delegate from the District of Columbia. As I said to her privately, we welcome you here. I have followed your career for many, many years and it is a very impressive one. So welcome, and we would be very happy to hear your statement. PRESENTATION OF AMIT PRIYAVADAN MEHTA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, BY HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, A DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Delegate Norton. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I will say that following is mutual. Many happy returns, Senator Grassley. I have been told to keep it very short. I agree with Senator Grassley. There should be nothing controversial about, certainly, my nominee. I will say only that Amit Mehta will be the first person of Asian Pacific background in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and boy what does he come with, magna cum laude graduate from Georgetown, Phi Beta Kappa, University of Virginia Law School, Order of the Coif, clerked on the Ninth Circuit, experienced now as a partner in a major law firm, and before that criminal experience at the renowned public defender service of the District of Columbia. He has got it all. It is a whole package. I strongly recommend him and we would be very proud to have a young able judge like this on our U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much. Now I would like to recognize the distinguished senator from Massachusetts, Senator Warren. PRESENTATION OF ALLISON DALE BURROUGHS, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS, BY HON. ELIZABETH WARREN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS Senator Warren. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman, and happy birthday Ranking Member. Delightful to be here today. Thank you for holding this hearing allowing me to be here today. I am very pleased to have the chance to introduce Allison Burroughs who has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on the District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Ms. Burroughs is joined today by her husband, Mike; her children, Jake and Harry; her sister, Carol; her niece, Haley; and her mother, Rima. I know they are all tremendously proud to have the chance to share this moment with her. Now Ms. Burroughs' nomination came after she was recommended for this position by the Advisory Committee on Massachusetts Judicial Nominations. The Advisory Committee is composed of distinguished members of the Massachusetts legal community, including prominent academics and litigators and is chaired by former Massachusetts District Court Judge, Nancy Gertner. The Committee's recommendation reflects the broad consensus of the Massachusetts legal community that she will be a superlative member of the Federal bench. Ms. Burroughs attended Middlebury College in Vermont and law school at the University of Pennsylvania where she graduated in 1988. She immediately began a 1-year clerkship with Judge Norma Shapiro on the United States District Court in Philadelphia beginning what has been a long and distinguished career in public service. After her clerkship, Ms. Burroughs went to the United States Attorney's Office, first in Philadelphia and then later back home in Boston. For 16 years, Ms. Burroughs has worked as a Federal Prosecutor and her record is one of significance, success and extraordinary integrity. Allison won three Director's Awards for superior performance as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. I want you to hear this one--her first in 1994 recognized her role in the investigation and prosecution of the Junior Black Mafia, one of the most ubiquitous and dangerous Philadelphia gangs in the 1980s and 1990s, a group believed to have killed more than 40 people. Her most recent 2004 Superior Performance Award recognized another kind of work that Allison did, her critical role in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's Office investigating and prosecuting individuals who perpetrated a complex offshore tax avoidance money laundering scheme. Since 2005, Ms. Burroughs has worked as partner and a defense lawyer in private practice in the firm of Nutter McClennen and Fish. Her extensive experience both as a prosecutor and a defense attorney gives Ms. Burroughs significant insight into both law and the practicalities of our adversarial system that will serve her well on the bench. She has also devoted significant time to civic and charitable work. She was founding member of Womanade, an organization that focuses on philanthropy to support programs that positively impact women and girls in the Boston area. She is also the former president of the board and a longtime trustee of Agassiz Village, a nonprofit camp for physically challenged and economically disadvantaged inner-city kids. Agassiz Village was founded by Allison's grandfather, a Russian immigrant who sold newspapers on a Boston street corner before putting himself through law school. Ms. Burroughs has received numerous honors recognizing her skills as a litigator, including multiple listings as a Massachusetts Super Lawyer and is a superlatively talented lawyer with a demonstrated commitment to public service. I am proud to have recommended her to President Obama. I look forward to her full approval by the Committee and her swift confirmation by the full Senate. Thank you very much for letting me be here today. Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Senator. If you would like to be excused--I meant to say that to Delegate Norton--but you are certainly able to. Thank you for taking the time. Senator Warren. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Senator Feinstein. I appreciate it. It is my pleasure to introduce Haywood Gilliam, Jr. He is a nominee I recommended to the President after my bipartisan screening committee--similar to what Senator Warren has in Massachusetts--gave him a strong recommendation. Mr. Gilliam's wife, Estela; daughter, Maya--nine years old, whose favorite author is a man by the name of Jackson. I told her I am from the ``Little House on the Prarie'' school, so I did not recognize him. He does mythology; right, Maya? So she is here. Mr. Gilliam's father is here. He was trained as a thoracic surgeon in the United States Army. I would like to thank him for his years of service on active duty as well as reserve duty. This is a distinguished practitioner at a major firm, Covington and Burling, and a former Federal Prosecutor. He graduated magnum cum laude from Yale in 1991, earned his law degree from Stanford in 1994, was an article editor for the Stanford Law Review. After graduation, he clerked for Judge Thelton Henderson of the Northern District of California. From 1995 to 1998, he worked as an associate at the law firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Enersen. He joined the United States Attorney's Office in San Francisco in 1999, serving until 2006. He was the Chief of the Securities Fraud Section from 2005 to 2009. He has handled several securities fraud cases as well as cases involving immigration fraud, health care fraud, commodities price manipulation and narcotics possession with intent to distribute. In 2006, he rejoined his prior firm, at that time called Bingham McCutchen as a partner. In 2009, he joined Covington and Burling where he has been a partner for the last 5 years. He is focused on corporate and individual clients facing investigation by the Federal Government. At Covington and Burling, he is the vice chair of the firm's white collar defense and investigations practice group which includes dozens of partners. So you can see he has had both sides of the question with respect to securities fraud, both as a U.S. Attorney and as a corporate defense lawyer. He has served on the District Court's Merit Selection Panel for magistrate judges, chairing it 2013, on the Stanford Law School Board of visitors from 2010 to 2012, and he serves on the board of Vincent Academy, a charter school in west Oakland. So for his family, you should know that your father and your son has an outstanding record of academic success, legal practice, and community involvement. I am confident he will serve with distinction as a district court judge. Let me add just a few words about Jeanne Davidson who has been nominated to serve on the Court of International Trade. This court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear important cases arising out of international trade, such as customs disputes. Jeanne Davidson, the nominee, earned her bachelors from UC Berkeley and her law degree from New York University of Law. For three decades, she has served in the Civil Division of the Department of Justice where she has held a variety of supervisory positions, some involving international trade. The American Bar has given her the highest rating of well- qualified. So now I would like to call forward the nominees, have them sworn in, and give them a chance to do very brief opening statements and then we will begin our questions. If you would raise your right hand, please and affirm the oath as I tell it. I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States in all cases, so help me God. Ms. Burroughs. I do. Ms. Davidson. I do. Mr. Gilliam. I do. Mr. Mehta. I do. Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much. The normal rule is 5-minute rounds. So I would like to begin with Ms. Burroughs and go right down the line with a brief opening statement and then ask Senator Grassley to be the first one to ask questions. Please, if you will. You need your mic on. Ms. Burroughs. I do not think you can be a judge unless you are smart enough to figure out how to turn it on. [Laughter.] Senator Feinstein. Sometimes that means you are just very brilliant. STATEMENT OF ALLISON DALE BURROUGHS, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS Ms. Burroughs. I would like to thank the Committee for inviting me here today. Senator Grassley, happy birthday. I was gratified to hear you say we were noncontroversial and I hope none of us do anything today to change your mind about that. I would also like to thank Senator Warren for her kind and generous introduction as well as Senator Markey for his support. I would be remiss not to also thank the Massachusetts Selection Committee and its Chair, Nancy Gertner, who I know worked very hard to get this right. And of course, my thanks to President Obama for his nomination. I am very fortunate to have many friends here today and others watching on the webcast, including my colleagues at Nutter McClennen and Fish. Friends in this room who were generous enough to make the trip from Boston include Amy Holman, Al Ulatom, Mark Kmetz, John Levy, and Mathilda Willey. My wonderful family is also here or watching and I am grateful for their support as well. There is one family member, though, that is not here and is very much on my mind today. My father died this summer during the selection process and shortly before I was nominated. There is no one that wanted this for me more than he did, and no one that would have gotten more of a kick out of being here today than he would have. I miss him and very much wish he could be here, but I am fortunate to have my fabulous mother, Rima Burroughs here, my sister, Carol, her husband, Brett, and their children Eli, Tessie, and Topher are watching or at least will be when school is out for the day. My niece Haley, who is a high school senior is here today. I know she is hoping to get an interesting college essay out of her experience in Washington. My brother, her father, Warren Burroughs, Jr., her mother, Cindy, and her sister Linsey, along with my other siblings, Cathy and John are also watching today. John's wife, Anita as well as my Aunt Jean and her family. My husband, Mike Leslie's family is also watching, his parents, John and Susan, his brothers, Bill and John and their families. And last, but certainly not least, I want to mention my husband Mike Leslie and our boys Jake and Harry who are sitting in back and are 4-years old. My husband is also a lawyer and I know he too feels very honored and humbled to be a part of this proceeding today. I think that Jake and Harry are enjoying their first trip to Washington, although Harry did tell me he was looking forward to my concert today and I can only hope he is not disappointed. [Laughter.] Ms. Burroughs. I thank you, again, for your consideration and I look forward to your questions. Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much. [The biographical information of Ms. Burrough appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Feinstein. Ms. Davidson. STATEMENT OF JEANNE E. DAVIDSON, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE U.S. COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE Ms. Davidson. Good morning. Thank you, Senator Feinstein, for chairing this hearing and for your kind introduction. I would like to thank the Committee for holding this hearing and I would like to thank President Obama for the honor of nominating me to the Court of International Trade. I also would like to wish Senator Grassley happy birthday. I would like to thank all of my friends and family who could not be here today, but are watching on the webcast in California, New York, Maryland, and in the District all in one fell swoop. Thanks to all of you for your support. With one exception, I will limit my introductions to people who are here today. The exception is my parents. They were California natives and members of the greatest generation. My father served in World War II, in the Navy, and then was in the Naval Reserve until he retired. My mother was a public school teacher in California. With me today are two family members who flew all the way from California, my son, my greatest achievement in life, Jeremy Davidson Hoffman. He obtained his bachelor's and master's degree in computer science at Stanford University and is now a senior software engineer at Google. My brother, Dr. John Michael Davidson, served in the Army during the Vietnam war era and then went on to obtain a doctorate in physics and for 35 years worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena where I can only describe his job as rocket scientist. My sister, Mary Elizabeth Davidson, is here today with her husband Matthew Seiden. They met almost 45 years ago when they were both serving in the Peace Corp in Brazil. Their son, Gabe Seiden, is here today. He also served in the Peace Corp many years later in Guatemala and is the proud father of Zev and Jacob Seiden. I would like to recognize some family friends, Virginia Lum and Dr. Robert Young, originally from the State of Hawaii, but now from the State of Maryland. My colleagues from the Federal Circuit Bar Association, of which I am privileged to serve as the president, currently, are here today and I welcome their support. Finally, I would like to recognize the lawyers from the Department of Justice, many of them are here today, with whom I have had the privilege of serving for almost 30 years and who are extraordinary, dedicated, talented group of lawyers. I would particularly like to mention those from the National Court Section in the Office of Foreign Litigation. Thank you very much. Senator Feinstein. Thank you. You have pretty much filled up the place. [The biographical information of Ms. Davidson appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Feinstein. Mr. Gilliam. STATEMENT OF HAYWOOD STIRLING GILLIAM, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Gilliam. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much for your kind introduction and for recommending me to President Obama. I deeply appreciate the trust that you have placed in me. Thank you to Ranking Member Grassley and the rest of the Committee for holding today's hearing. I am honored to be here today to answer your questions. I thank President Obama for placing his trust in me by nominating me to this very important position. I would like to acknowledge my family who have traveled here today. My wife, Estela Lopez Gilliam--Stella and I met when we were young lawyers speaking to a class of tenth graders--who were reading ``To Kill a Mocking Bird''--about our jobs as lawyers. I can tell the young lawyers here always take the chance to do volunteer work when you can because it paid off for me. We celebrated our 12th anniversary this past June. My daughter, Maya Pearl, is here as well. Maya is a fourth grader at Hillcrest Elementary School in Oakland, California. She is very excited about the opportunity to visit the Smithsonian this week and we are hoping that her teachers give her extra study credit for that. My parents, Dr. Haywood Gilliam, Sr. and Audrey Gilliam have traveled from Alameda, California to join me today. I appreciate their support. I would like to also acknowledge four people who are not here, but who are very much here with me in spirit, and that is my grandparents John and Pearl Bryant and Marvin and Emma Gilliam. I know that if they were here, they would be very proud. I can say with certainty without the love and support and encouragement of my family members, there would be no way that I could be sitting here before you as a nominee to the Federal bench. Finally, I would like to recognize those who are joining us today on the webcast, especially the folks in California who got up very early to view these proceedings. Thank you to everyone watching on the webcast. Thank you, again, and I very much appreciate the opportunity to be here before you today. Senator Feinstein. Thank you, Mr. Gilliam. [The biographical information of Mr. Gilliam appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Feinstein. Mr. Mehta. STATEMENT OF AMIT PRIYAVADAN MEHTA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Mr. Mehta. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. I would also like to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for convening the meeting today. I wish Senator Grassley a happy birthday. I would also like to thank Senator Feinstein for chairing the meeting. I would like to thank Congresswoman Norton for her kind introductory remarks as well as her faith in me, and nominating me to the President as well as her nominations commission for considering my application and recommending me to the Congresswoman. I would also like to thank President Obama for the honor and the privilege of the nomination. I thank him very much for the trust that he has placed in me. I would like to acknowledge my family and friends who are here today, starting with my wife and best friend, Caroline Mehta. We have been married for 9 years and without her, I certainly would not be here today. My daughter, Devan, who is 7 years old--she is a second- grader at John Eaton Elementary here in Washington, DC. She is here and this is her first true civics lesson. My son Kian, who is 3 years old is here as well. My Parents, Priyavadan and Ragini Mehta are here from Baltimore, Maryland. My parents came to this country 42 years ago. My presence here today is a testament to them as well as the opportunities that this country has afforded my family. My sister, Sheetal Prasad, is here from New York city. I would like to acknowledge my in-laws, my wife's parents, Charles and Susan Judge, who could not be here today. My wife is fond of saying that I have already met the most important Judges in my life, and she is right about that. My dear friends are here, my law partners and dear friends William Taylor, Roger Zuckerman, and Susan Taylor. I would also like to acknowledge my friends Marybeth Rathman, Ephraim Leavy and Michael Zamor who are here as well. Last, I would like to thank Este Berwinkle for being here. Ms. Berwinkle is staying with our family from South Africa for the year and this is a nice way for her to see how the American judicial and Congressional process work. Thank you. Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much. [The biographical information of Mr. Mehta appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Feinstein. We will now go to questions. I will ask our distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Grassley, to begin. Senator Grassley. Well, thank you. I usually only ask one or two questions of each of you here orally. I submit questions for response in writing and sometimes when those come back, we ask for further elaboration on some of the questions. So do not be surprised if you get questions in writing and maybe even followups. I am going to start with Ms. Burroughs. I have three or four questions of which I am only going to ask one, but they deal with the issue of the death penalty. In the case of the Boston bomber, you wrote that a decision to forego the death penalty ``would have required political courage''--just a short explanation of what you meant by the statement. Ms. Burroughs. Thank you for giving me an opoortunity to address that topic. The marathon bombing case was, obviously, a high profile case in Boston. It struck at an iconic event in both Boston and in the United States. There is obviously a lot of strong emotion over what should happen to the defendant in that case. Because it was so high profile and the crime so atrocious, including the taking of a life of a small child, to forego the death penalty in that case, I believe, would have required political courage of a different sort than, perhaps in a more run of a mill, gang kind of case. Senator Grassley. And just a short answer to this question. Do you hold any personal views regarding the death penalty that would make you unable to impose it if the law required it? Ms. Burroughs. No, Senator, I do not. Senator Grassley. All right. Now I am going to go on to Ms. Davidson. In a 2004 panel you said, ``your credibility before the court is your most important asset as a lawyer.'' If confirmed, how would you evaluate the credibility of lawyers who appear before you? Ms. Davidson. Thank you, Senator. If confirmed, I would prepare very carefully and very thoroughly for every case that came before me, and I would evaluate the credibility of the lawyers based upon their candor in making their arguments to the court, whether their arguments were well-based in the record and in the law, in the Constitution, the statutes, the decisions of the Supreme Court. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Mr. Gilliam, you would not know this, but I spend a lot of time considering points of view of whistleblowers. So you have had an interest in that. In your capacity as a partner of a law firm, you represented clients during governmental investigations. You have written extensively on how to conduct investigations and how to deal with whistleblowers. What is your view in the role of whistleblowers? Mr. Gilliam. Thank you, Senator. Whistleblowers have a very important role under the law. A number of statutes that I deal with routinely--for example, the False Claims Act, have expressed provisions that provide for whistleblowing. I think that those statutes are clear. They set out the proper process by which whistleblowers can bring claims and by which those claims would be adjudicated. Were I to have th"
