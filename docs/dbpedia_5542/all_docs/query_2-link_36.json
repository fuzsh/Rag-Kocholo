        "text": "U.S. Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) today reconvened his non-partisan, statewide Judicial Review Commission to recommend Federal District Court Judges for Illinois.\n\nSenator Kirk's Commission is responsible for the extensive review of applications, interviewing applicants, and providing informed recommendations to ensure a successful, efficient process for recommending the most qualified federal judicial candidates to the President. Senator Kirk will continue to work closely with Senator Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), who has formed a similar committee. There are currently four judicial vacancies on the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. President Obama nominated Thomas Durkin of Mayer Brown LLP, at the recommendation of Senators Kirk and Durbin, to fill one of these vacancies. Durkinâ€™s nomination currently awaits a confirmation vote by the full Senate.\n\n\"This panel provides non-partisan recommendations for filling judicial openings in our federal courts,\" said Kirk. \"With the help of this statewide Commission, we submit the strongest applicants from Illinois for consideration by the President and U.S. Senate.\"\n\nOnce Senator Kirk makes recommendations, the President will submit a nomination to the U.S. Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee will then review the nominee and vote to advance the nominee for consideration by the full Senate. Qualified applicants for federal judgeships can find an application here. The application is similar to those used by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The deadline for submission is Tuesday, January 22, 2013, close of business.\n\nSenator Kirk's 14 member screening committee is chaired by Peter Baugher of Schopf & Weiss LLP.\n\n\"This is an outstanding Commission,\" said Baugher. \"It includes prominent civil and criminal practitioners, business lawyers, leaders of bar associations, a former U.S. District Judge, a law professor, and a senior member of the Illinois Congressional Delegation- all committed to helping Senator Kirk find the best women and men to serve as federal court judges.\"\n\nAdditional Commission members include: U.S. Congresswoman Judy Biggert; Former Federal Court Judge Wayne Andersen of JAMS Arbitration, Mediation, and ADR Services; Keith Beyler of the Southern Illinois University School of Law; Roxane Busey of Baker & McKenzie LLP; James Figliulo of Figliulo & Silverman, P.C.; Victor Henderson of Henderson Adam LLC; Larry Kuster of Rammelkamp Bradney P.C.; Lynn Mirabella of Mirabella, Kincaid, Frederick & Mirabella, LLC; James Montana of Vedder Price P.C.; Jennifer Nijman of Nijman Franzetti LLP; Richard Porter of Kirkland & Ellis LLP; Ronald Safer of Schiff Hardin LLP; and Marschall Smith, General Counsel at Archer Daniels Midland Company.\n\nJudicial Review Commission Members:\n\nPeter Baugher (chair).
