        "text": "Nancy H. Rue, 76, of Athens, Ohio passed away peacefully Saturday, February 4, 2023 at Riverside Methodist Hospital following a brief illness. She was born in Canton, Ohio, on June 14, 1946, the daughter of Marian P. and W. Donald Huffman. She grew up in northeastern Ohio, but spent her adult life in Athens. She graduated from the College of Wooster in 1968 and received a Master’s degree in Library Science from Kent State University a year later. Following her mother’s career path in librarianship, Nancy enjoyed a successful career as reference librarian at Ohio University’s Alden Library, receiving the Outstanding Administrator award in 1991. She retired as the Associate Dean for Public Service after 35 years of service to the University Libraries. Connecting people with information was her passion as a librarian. She learned to play golf as a youngster, taught primarily by her father, and grew up on the family’s golf course in Austinburg, OH. She remained an avid golfer throughout her life. Nancy was the women’s champion at the Athens Country Club for more than 30 years and a six-time medalist in the Southeastern Ohio Women’s Golf Association tournament. An active member of the Country Club, she served as president of the Board of Trustees, president of the Women’s Golf Association, on various Club committees, and as the Club’s historian. Nancy was a generous benefactor to her alma maters, Wooster and Kent State, as well as to many local and national charitable organizations. She established a scholarship fund to honor her family, supported the Ohio University golf program, and local libraries. She enjoyed and appreciated her friends, especially those with whom she shared many happy times on the golf course and over card games or a glass of wine. Their support and love lifted her spirits through her final illness. She was preceded in death by her parents and her best friend of over 40 years Connie Stanforth and her husband William. She is survived by her husband, Charles V. Rue, Jr., of Athens; and by her brother, Donald S. Huffman and his wife Joanna of Vero Beach, FL; nephews Andrew Huffman and Nathan Huffman, great niece Callie and great nephew James Huffman, and her Stanforth family, Kirby and Will. Nancy’s final message to the world is this: Be kind and love each other. Doing good for others out of love and kindness is the true purpose of our existence: “I shall pass through this world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being, let me do it now, for I shall not pass this way again.” (S. Grellet)\n\nTributes and remembrance gifts in Nancy’s memory may be directed to the Huffman Family Scholarship Fund at the Foundation for Appalachian Ohio (FAO), P.O. Box 456, Nelsonville, OH 45764, or the Ohio University Libraries through The Ohio University Foundation, P.O. Box 869, Athens, OH 45701, or (to benefit the Athens Public Library) the Betcher Memorial Endowment for Library Services, also c/o FAO in Nelsonville.\n\nThere will be a memorial gathering and celebration of Nancy’s life on Saturday, April 15, 2023, 3:00 PM at the Athens Country Club. Arrangements are by Hughes-Moquin Funeral Home where You may send a message of sympathy to the family at www.hughesmoquinfuneralhome.com.\n\nRobert Howard Evans died March 19, 2023.\n\nBob was born May 1, 1938, in Pittsburgh, PA to Howard John and Eugenia Wilson Evans. Bob grew up in Pittsburgh and DuBois, PA, graduating from Plum HS in Pittsburgh. He and his wife, Mary, graduated from the College of Wooster where he received honors and the John F. Miller prize in philosophy, while serving as a member of the Marine Corps Reserves. He attended the University of Indiana, and then received a Mellon Fellowship, and his PhD, from the University of Pittsburgh. He arrived in Duluth in 1964 to replace Henry Ehlers for a quarter at UMD, but Bob proved he was a natural teacher and together they developed a philosophy major where he taught across the curriculum throughout his 40 years on the faculty. Bob taught in the Rusty Ladies program and the Experimental Freshman Studies Program, served on the Athletic Committee, the Award and Honors Committee, and on the All-University Committee on Active Learning. He was Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts under Rip Rapp. Bob became the first Assistant Dean for Student Affairs for the College of Letters and Science, and Head of the Philosophy Department numerous times. He was president of the Duluth Chapter of the AAUP and served as the UEA legislative liaison. Bob served widely including being on the American Indian Advisory Board, the Medical School Admissions Committee, Director of Interdisciplinary Studies, as the Director of the Center for Public Policy and on the St. Louis County Historical Society Board. Three different years he was Director of the Study in England Program and taught two other years in England for a program he loved. Bob had a wide variety of skills, from being the interim Provost & Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs to earning a varsity athletic letter in college for wrestling, the latter being a story that he regaled to his children. He received the Jean Blehart Distinguished Teacher Award, and the Advisement Award for CLA. Even in retirement he continued to share his knowledge through courses he taught for the University for Seniors.\n\nhttps://www.duluthnewstribune.com/obituaries/obits/robert-h-evans-5d0135ff67a60618cb3bf3a9-64190e23f3f54b1dcbb4d73b\n\nHello Wooster Family and Dr. K.\n\nI wanted to share with you that my Future City Middle School team won the World Championship in Washington DC in February. We now have won back-to-back international titles and the third time in five years. My team is now the winningest team in the history of this prestigious STEM competition.\n\nI have coached our Future City team over the last 17 years. We have won the regional competition 12 times and been nationally ranked 1st (three times), 2nd, 4th, 6th, 11th (twice), 12th and 13th over those years.\n\nThis year’s team created the future city of Odesa Ukraine and then presented their project to the diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC (see attached Lancaster newspaper article).\n\nWhile the competition is heavily dominated by engineering schools and science academies, we (a public school) are now on top of the ranks. I attribute a good deal of my teams’ success to the liberal arts education I received at Wooster. I remember the dean addressing us with our parents at freshman orientation. He said that Wooster will teach us not what to think but how to think. My dad (also a Wooster grad) cried at that moment. I was a Philosophy major and Economics minor at Wooster. While I have never had an engineering class in my life, I learned how to think, how to compete, and how to win an engineering competition.\n\nYou can learn about the competition at https://futurecity.org/.\n\nAlso see the FC Press Release\n\nBeth Irwin Lewis, 1934-2023\n\nNoted scholar, cultural historian of German modern art, loving mother, equal partner, steadfast feminist, and committed organic gardener, Dr. Beth Irwin Lewis died March 3, 2023, in Oberlin, Ohio. In appropriate fashion, a woman who lived a life of her mind, defined and led by the independence of her thoughts and convictions, concluded her 8-year struggle with dementia with grace days after her 89th birthday.\n\nBorn in Mashhad, Iran, before the outbreak of World War II, Beth Louise Irwin held a global perspective on the intersection of politics, religion, and culture throughout her life. The daughter of missionaries Rev. J. Mark Irwin and Ruth Hoffman Irwin, her childhood was defined by vivid memories of Russian, German, British, and American interests in the oilfields of Persia, and her harrowing evacuation with her older sister, Mary Lynette, and her mother by merchant and prison transport ships across the Pacific between 1942-43.\n\nAlthough she returned to Iran after the war, Beth came stateside and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from The College of Wooster (’56) and completed her doctorate from The University of Wisconsin (’69) working with Prof. George L. Mosse. Beth met and married fellow graduate student D. Arnold Lewis in 1958, and their research travels over the next year through post-war Europe and the Middle East initiated a 58-year fruitful and loving partnership. She gave birth to daughter Martha and twin sons, David and Paul, published a comprehensive analysis of George Grosz, served on the Board of Education for the Wooster City Schools, co-authored as a Member of Session the 1979 report calling for gender equality in the language used throughout the Presbyterian Church, and held positions as Associate Director of Admissions, and Secretary of The College of Wooster all before her 48th year.\n\nWhile granted the title, Affiliated Scholar and Adjunct Professor of Art History at Wooster, Beth navigated her own academic career, achieving international recognition for her scholarship and writing from 1982 through 2009. She was invited by UCLA as a Visiting Associate Professor for multiple years between 1982-1987, held the positions of Visiting Scholar at the Getty Center, Scholar in Residence at the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Research Associate at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton between 1989-1994.\n\nBeth’s scholarship illuminated the intersections between power, politics, and art. She was keenly interested in public perception of culture and wrote foundational scholarship on the depiction of women in modern art. Her essay, “Lustmord: Violence against Women in Early Twentieth-Century German Art,” solicited invitations by Stanford, Harvard, Wisconsin, UCLA, Pomona, and Iowa, among others, for keynote lectures. She co-authored Persuasive Images: Poster of Art and Revolution with Peter Paret and Paul Paret (Princeton University Press, 1992), and her book George Grosz: Art and Politics in the Weimar Republic, first printed in 1971, was revised and reissued in 1991 (Princeton University Press) and has been translated into Italian and Japanese.\n\nFollowing a decade of archival research, Beth completed her substantial work, Art for All? The Collision of Modern Art and the Public in Late-Nineteenth-Century Germany in 2003 (Princeton University Press). Her 448-page opus challenged the dominant Francophile narrative of modern art, positioning the role of mass art exhibitions and popular culture as central to the rise of German national identity, modernity, and the subsequent reaction of the European Avant-Garde. Upon publication, the book was hailed as “..the most innovative book on German art written in the last decade or so, and will certainly be the one that sets the standards while also formulating the questions for future studies.” (R. Heller)\n\nThroughout her life, Beth remained keenly grounded and attuned to the interdependence of the earth and human life. The self-sufficiency that defined her childhood in the mission field was brought to annual cycles of sumptuous garden cultivation, harvesting, and canning, and early adoption of diets for a small planet. Among her children’s earliest memories are of forays into homemade yogurt, Tigers Milk with brewers’ yeast, and unending boxes of organic flour and heirloom grains from Walnut Acres. Her hands were never still, whether steeped in soil or enmeshed in a whir of knitting needles, the latter often while simultaneously reading or listening.\n\nAfter 47 years of maintaining a 19th-century farmhouse in Wooster, Ohio, Beth with her husband, architectural historian Arn Lewis, moved to Kendal at Oberlin in 2011. She is survived by her sister, her three children, all architects, and four grandchildren: Astrid, Quinn, Sarabeth, and Maximo. At her dignified passing, she was encircled by her children and long-time friend Sara Patton. A memorial celebration of her life, spirit, and work is planned for this summer.\n\nJan Lee Kreader passed away in Los Angeles, CA, on February 26, 2023, after a long illness. Lee was born Edward Dale Cronk to Margaret Cronk on December 5, 1945, in Omaha, NE. In an act of love and self-sacrifice, Margaret relinquished her son for adoption to the Nebraska Children’s Home when he was several weeks old. Lee was joyfully adopted by his parents Helen and Colman “Mannie” Kreader in February 1946. Lee was raised through eighth grade in Dalton, NE, near the family’s wheat farm. They spent the winters of 1952 and 1953 in Tucson, AZ where Lee attended the Brandes School to recover from rheumatic fever he contracted in first grade. Lee’s family moved to Lincoln, NE, in 1959, when his father became the president of the Nebraska Wheat Growers Association. Lee loved music and played the accordion as a child, studied piano in high school, and attended Rocky Ridge Music Center in Estes Park, CO every summer. Lee graduated from Lincoln Southeast High School in 1963 and went on to receive his B.A. in U.S. History in 1967, from the College of Wooster in Wooster, OH.\n\nLee married his Rocky Ridge and high school sweetheart Barbara Barlow in 1967. Lee and Barb had two children, Benjamin Colman in 1969, and Eleanor Alice in 1973. After receiving a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, Lee completed his M.A. in U.S History at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 and returned to the College of Wooster to teach history.\n\nWhen Lee was drafted for the Vietnam War, he successfully petitioned to be classified as a Conscientious Objector on moral grounds. To fulfill his alternative service to his country, Lee and his family moved to Chicago in 1971, where he established and directed Sheridan Center, a bilingual social service and mental health center that provided a comprehensive neighborhood response to the needs of low-income children and families in the neighborhood surrounding Wrigley Field. Lee flourished at Sheridan Center and found his life’s calling assisting vulnerable communities and at-risk children, transforming his childhood aspiration to become a Presbyterian minister into a career in social service.\n\nIn 1975, Lee went on to direct Broadway Children’s Center before becoming Director of the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago’s day care and after-school programs in 1980. After a brief tenure as the Executive Director of The Day Care Action Council of Illinois, Lee completed his Ph.D. in U.S. Social History from the University of Chicago in 1988, authoring his dissertation on the life of Isaac Max Rubinow, a leading theorist on the idea of social insurance during the New Deal. In 1990, Lee became Director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services’ state-wide resource and referral project, helping families find quality affordable child care.\n\nAfter Lee and Barb divorced in 1998, he embarked on a new chapter, moving to New York City to work as a Senior Policy Analyst and later Co-Director of Child Care & Early Education Research Connections at the National Center for Children in Poverty, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. While there, he launched Research Connections which synthesized research on child care subsidy use and infant and toddler child care into a standard resource for professionals throughout the country. Soon after moving to New York, Lee met his life partner Kay Hendon, who shared his commitment to child care and early childhood education and his sense of adventure exploring the city’s endless cultural offerings. Lee embraced Kay’s family as his own and cherished his role in their lives, sharing his love and guidance with her children and grandchildren.\n\nLee inherited the “fiesta gene” from his parents and knew how to have fun. He loved cheering on his favorite teams – the Nebraska Cornhuskers, the Chicago Cubs and the New York Yankees. Lee also loved show tunes (preferably from Judy or Liza) and was known for his ability to spontaneously warble the perfect lyric to sum up any situation. He had an affinity for Siamese cats, collected cardinals, rubber duckies and wind-up toys, and found it hard to resist a good old-fashioned pun.\n\nLee was a loving father, grandfather, and partner. He was also a devoted friend who loved his friends as family. Having been an “only child” for seven decades, he was overjoyed to learn that he had six siblings – three brothers and a sister through his birth mother Margaret Cronk Wortman and a brother and sister through his birth father Joseph Grigalauski. Not long after the discovery in 2017, Lee was able to meet all but one of his siblings, as well as their extended families. He relished his new role as the older brother to his brothers and sisters and delighted in being an uncle and great-uncle to their many children and grandchildren.\n\nLee is survived by his former wife Barbara Skalinder of Highland Park, IL; his son Ben (Gary Trethaway) Kreader of Los Angeles, CA; his daughter Eleanor (Paul) Zwart and granddaughter Antonia “Nia” Zwart of Rohnert Park, CA; his brother Mike (Kathy) Wortman of Lincoln, NE; his sister Sue (Tom) Millsap of Lincoln, NE; his brother Mark (Deb) Wortman of Elkhorn, NE; his brother Paul (Sue) Wortman of Elkhorn, NE; his sister Kathy (Dan) Waldron of Loves Park, IL; his cousin George Bryan of Omaha, NE; and many treasured nieces and nephews.\n\nLee is also survived by his life partner Kay Hendon of New Haven, CT, and her family, including: daughter Sarah Hendon and grandson Sammy Hendon-Dahl of East Haven, CT; Sammy’s father Lawrence Dahl of Madison, WI; son Luke (Lara Loyd) Hendon and grandsons Liam and Emory Hendon of Cheshire, CT; granddaughter Annie Beckett of Boston, MA and grandson Taran Besant of St. Paul, MN, children of Kay’s late daughter Jean (Christophe) Hendon Besant.\n\nLee was preceded in death by his adoptive and birth parents; his uncle and aunt Donald “Swede” and Mildred Kreader; his granddaughter Helen Zwart; his brother Charles Grigalauski; and his niece Megan Boyer.\n\nSylvia Spencer Petrie, 90, passed away on August 9th, 2021, at her Peace Dale home surrounded by members of her family. She was the widow of Rhode Island poet (and long-time University of Rhode Island faculty member) Paul Petrie. Sylvia was born on June 15, 1931 to Ruth Clark Spencer and Dr. Warren P. Spencer. She grew up in Wooster, Ohio, where her father was a professor of genetics at Wooster College. As a young child, she traveled with her mother to visit her mother’s birthplace of Rio de Janeiro, and this Brazilian connection has always been important to her.\n\nSylvia attended Wooster College where she was awarded the Netta Strain Scott Prize in art and earned a BA. She always looked back fondly on her time there. After graduating from Wooster, she made her way to the University of Iowa where she studied printmaking with Mauricio Lasansky. It was there that she met and married Paul, her late beloved husband of 58 years, who was studying creative writing. They fell in love over their shared love of music, singing the romantic songs of Rodgers and Hart together. She continued to devote time to her art while they started a family. Sylvia and Paul sometimes worked symbiotically in their art and poetry, with each occasionally drawing inspiration from the other’s work. She exhibited her artwork in many venues, including one-person shows in Providence, Boston and even England. She was a member of several artist groups, notably the Print Consortium and 19 on Paper. Her work ranged between realism and abstraction but it always revealed a strong love for nature and a sensitivity to the interplay of light and shadow.\n\nThough an accomplished artist, she always put her family first. A devoted mother and grandmother, she leaves behind three children: Philip, Emily and Lisa, and their spouses, and five grandchildren whom she doted on. It is impossible to sum up anyone’s personality with just a few words, but like her beloved monoprints, we might paint in broad strokes—Sylvia was curious; Sylvia was compassionate; Sylvia gave what she had with very little thought for herself. She will be sorely missed by all of her family.\n\nFor condolences, please visit averystortifuneralhome.com.\n\nMIAMI, FL – January 23, 2023 – Cresa Miami, South Florida’s premier occupier-only commercial real estate firm, is pleased to announce that it has welcomed two new advisors to its team of experts. Alberto Martinez and Benjamin Kuhn have joined the firm to service office and industrial occupiers. This announcement comes on the heels of one of the team’s most successful years to-date, with over $160 million in transactions in 2022 alone.\n\n“Now more than ever, tenants are in need of knowledgeable and loyal partners to guide them through the ever-evolving industry and help make their goals a reality,” said Jeff Hartsook, Managing Principal at Cresa. “With this in mind, we couldn’t be more thrilled to be expanding our team and for Benjamin Kuhn to be on board as our newest Advisor. Together, we look forward to building on our existing momentum in the dynamic South Florida market.”\n\nBorn and raised in South Florida, Kuhn has witnessed the city’s immense economic development firsthand. In his new role, Kuhn’s immediate focus is on business development and market research. Prior to joining Cresa, he served as a property manager for WaterFront Realty Group. Kuhn holds a BA from the College of Wooster where he studied Communications and Business Economics.\n\n“2022 was a monumental year for the Cresa team in South Florida,” said Tim Rivers, Market Leader – Florida for Cresa. “Much like our roster of deals, our team and client roster continues to grow at an impressive rate across the state. With the recent addition of Bob Schneiderman in Boca Raton and Lauren Rizzo in our Tampa office, we’re excited to continue our momentum in 2023 and beyond.”\n\nElmer Everett Selby Jr. age 92, of Horseheads, NY, passed away on November 2, 2022. He was the son of the late Elmer Everett Selby and Clara Summers Moist Selby and was predeceased by his wife, Beverly Ann Scheidemantle Selby of 54 years. Elmer is survived by his daughter Heather (Bruce) Smith of Davidson, NC, son Scott (Judy) Selby of Endwell, NY, son Craig (Nan) Selby of Ashland, OH, sister Clara (John) Kelly, grandchildren Kevin Selby, Emily (Andrew) Torba, Tyler and Jared Smith, Melanie Irvine-Selby, great-grandchildren Sophia and Samuel Torba, and sister-in-law Mariellen Burkhart as well as many nieces, nephews, and friends.\n\nBorn on July 22, 1930, in Charleston, WV, Elmer grew up moving between his hometown and Carnegie, PA. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from The College of Wooster in Ohio and a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nImmediately following his final exam, Elmer flew to Pittsburgh to begin a very successful career with Westinghouse Electric Company. Shortly afterwards, he transferred to Westinghouse in Horseheads. There he rose from Assistant Engineer to Fellow Engineer, working with luminescent screens (awarded a patent), photosensitive surfaces, and clean manufacturing environments with assignments in both Engineering and Manufacturing Departments. He was a member of the American Chemical Society, a member of the American Society for Testing & Materials Committee, Chairman of the Task Force on Surface Examination, and more. During his 35 years of employment, he became involved in metallurgy and nondestructive analysis, was manager of the Chemical & Physical Laboratory, and was involved in Quality Control. One interesting accomplishment was his work on the camera Neil Armstrong used on the moon. Shortly after arriving in Horseheads, Elmer married his college sweetheart in 1955. They settled in Elmira and had two children, Heather and Scott. When Craig was born, they decided the house was too small and moved to Holiday Drive in Horseheads. After retiring, Elmer and Bev spent the winters in a condo in Seminole, FL near Bev’s mother and sister.\n\nElmer reached the rank of Eagle in his Boy Scout troop, being a role model for his grandsons to do the same. He enjoyed years of camping, hiking, and canoeing as well as earning merit badges. He eventually worked in leadership positions in Troop 33 of Elmira and became the Scoutmaster and Troop Committee Chairperson of 44 in Horseheads. He was awarded an outstanding service award for his untiring work with Boy Scout Troop 44 and the Claude V Furman Memorial Trophy from the Sullivan Trail Council for promoting “good camping and the love of nature”.\n\nAs an active member of the Presbyterian church, Elmer taught Sunday School and served as an Elder and a Deacon. He had a lifelong love for travel, having explored 49 states, Canada, and many European countries. He was also an avid reader of scientific journals and religious books. Elmer was an enthusiastic stamp and coin collector. As a member of basketball teams in college and at Westinghouse, he took full advantage of his 6’5” height. Spelunking was always an adventure and included repelling into shafts to measure rooms and corridors of many unexplored caverns, including a new area of Organ Cave. Other favorite activities included bowling, golf, high school track, and beating everyone in card games.\n\nElmer was well known as a caregiver. After his wife, Bev, developed Parkinson’s Disease, he retired early to travel with her and then to take care of her physical needs. During her 27 years of suffering, he never wavered in his care of her, showing everyone what it means to fulfill his marriage vow, “in sickness and in health”. A worship service celebrating Elmer’s life was held on Monday, November 7th. He was then laid to rest in Maple Grove Cemetery in Horseheads.\n\nShirley J. Wright of Rehoboth, Massachusetts passed away at home on Sunday October 9, 2022, surrounded by family and friends.\n\nDaughter of Agnes and Joseph Wright of Burlington, New Jersey, she is survived by her beloved wife, Robin Rose, sisters-in-laws, Wendy Rose Sanchez and Charity Rose, nieces Becca Niendorff, Margaret Hageman, Sara Gardner, Mary Alice and Gabriela Romero Rose, nephews Stephen Niendorff, Harry Sanders, Ben Rose, Thomas Rose, Gabe Sanchez, Bobby Sanchez, and Julian Romero Rose. She is also survived by her loving brothers-in-laws, Richard Niendorff and Martin Sanchez and was pre-deceased by one additional brother-in-law, Charles David Rose. In her life, illness and death Shirley and her wife Robin were supported by many family members and a community of devoted and loving friends who are their extended family.\n\nShirley was educated at Burlington New Jersey High School, The College of Wooster, Northwestern University, and the University of Connecticut. She valued education and as a financial aid officer at UConn, Wheaton College and Brown University she was dedicated to making educational opportunities accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. After retiring as Associate Director of Financial Aid at Brown University, she worked for several years as the Scholarship Director at the College Crusade in Providence. Her passion for educational equity was palpable and through her work she helped transform the lives of countless students.\n\nFor the past eight years, she participated in the Grace Notes Singers group which sings for the terminally ill. She loved the women who sang and the compassionate work of the group. She served as treasurer and as a member of the steering committee.\n\nShirley was an avid reader who devoured three newspapers a day and countless books on a monthly basis. She cherished vibrant and thoughtful conversations about complex issues of social justice and politics. She loved canoeing and camping with friends, snorkeling, travel, walking the family pets and appreciating the natural world. She was a highly educated environmentalist and treasured her time in the woods, on rivers, in the mountains or in the presence of old growth forests. The natural world was her sacred space.\n\nShirley was committed to addressing issues of social justice and to making a positive difference in the world. She did so through her philanthropy, her service, and her daily interactions with others. Her generous spirit, compassion and ability to be truly present to others was a gift to many. The most appropriate way to honor her is by sharing your resources with organizations of your choosing or with: Save the Bay Rhode Island, Save the Bay Dr. Providence, RI 02905 or The Rhode Island Community Food Bank, 200 Niantic Ave., Providence, RI 02907.\n\nA Celebration of Life service was held in her honor on Monday, October 17th.\n\nRobert “Bob” L. Tignor, 89 years old, passed away after a short illness on December 9 in his home in Princeton, NJ.\n\nBob, a dedicated father, husband, and scholar, was born in Philadelphia on November 20, 1933. His father, Bob M. Tignor, was the minister of the Yeadon Presbyterian church and his mother, Martha, taught high school Latin. The oldest of five, Bob was a natural leader whose work ethic emerged in childhood – from the classroom to the sports fields to his first job at the Breyers ice cream factory. Bob earned his bachelor’s degree from the College of Wooster in 1955 and his Ph.D. at Yale University before joining the faculty at Princeton University, where he taught for 46 years until 2006. He was the Rosengarten Professor of Modern and Contemporary History, Emeritus, and a pathbreaking scholar of British colonialism and its aftermath, world history, and the modern histories of Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya. He was also affiliated with the Program in Near Eastern Studies and the Program in African Studies and served as director of the latter from 1970 to 1979.\n\nAs a teacher, Bob offered Princeton’s first courses in African history. As a scholar, he immersed himself in the study of the continent, learning Arabic and exploring new historical methods, including ethnographic accounts of the roles of the Kamba, Kikuyu and Maasai peoples of East Africa in the rise and fall of the British empire in Kenya. His research took him to Egypt, Nigeria, Sudan, England, and Kenya, countries where he and his family would live during sabbatical years.\n\nHis 14 years as chair of the Department of History was considered transformative, as he helped push the intellectual frontiers of the department beyond Europe and North America. He supported the creation of new kinds of courses, in new fields, with connections and support for interdisciplinary international studies, especially in African, Asian and Latin American studies, and initiated graduate and undergraduate courses in world history. He focused on empire and capitalism before either topic was fashionable, writing seven books on African history. His book “Worlds Together, Worlds Apart: A History of the Modern World: 1300 to the Present” (Norton, 2002), a two-volume history of the world, is generally regarded as the defining scholarly work in the field and the leading college-level textbook on global history.\n\nA full list of Bob’s publications and academic honors are included in the Princeton University obituary. [https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/12/21/robert-tignor-distinguished-egyptologist-and-historian-wonderful-mentor-and]]\n\nBeyond his own scholarship, Bob was a dedicated mentor to generations of undergraduate and graduate students in modern African history and modern world history. Among his graduate students, many of whom went on to prestigious academic careers, he is remembered for his wry sense of humor and no-nonsense approach.\n\nThe easy athleticism and competitive spirit that Bob showed as a child – from the swimming pool to the basketball court to the football field where he played quarterback on his intramural college team – continued into his adulthood. Among colleagues and friends, he was known as a fierce and fearsome tennis and squash player. His childhood loyalty to Philadelphia sports teams never wavered, and he was equally devoted to his Princeton Tigers as an adult. A passionate spectator, Bob’s game-watching moods ranged from sheer glee to total exasperation. He never shied away from letting the refs know when he disagreed with a call – which was not infrequently – or voicing his opinions when watching games on TV (and sometimes waking up his sleeping children in the process).\n\nBob was fair, honest, and deeply committed to helping others, most especially through education. Not one to slow down in “retirement,” he continued writing, publishing books on the Nobel-winning economist W. Arthur Lewis, a short history of Egypt, and a biography of Anwar al-Sadat. He also completed revisions of “Worlds Together, Worlds Apart” and wrote a companion volume. Bob continued his work as a member on the Board of Trustees for The College of Wooster, a role that brought him great pleasure. He volunteered as a reader for the blind; worked with struggling elementary school learners in the read-aloud program at a local elementary school, and helped women living in a shelter get their GED. Bob offered adult education lectures to the Princeton community and held advanced group history discussions in his home for a group of motivated high school students.\n\nAmong many things, his family will remember his commitment to summer vacations on Cape Cod spanning 60 years and countless trips taking children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to the Brewster General store.\n\nBob’s wife of 66 years, Marian, suffered a fatal stroke on Dec. 15, just six days after Bob’s death. He was predeceased by his son, Jeffrey David Tignor, who died in 2003. He is survived by his brother, Richard Tignor; his sisters, Joan Tiernan and Judy Russo; his daughters, Laura Tignor and Sandra Selby and husband Trevor Selby; four grandchildren, Hilde McKernan, Sam Cobb, Owen Selby and Isabel Selby; and two great-grandchildren, Hunter and Harper McKernan.\n\nA memorial service will be held at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Princeton, 50 Cherry Hill Rd., Princeton, New Jersey, at 2 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 19, 2023.\n\nI am a graduate of Wooster, class of 1966, and a retired pastor living in the Finger Lakes of western New York. My late wife, Martha Eshelman Brown (known as “Marty”), was in the class of 1965. My second children’s book, entitled Maggie of the Crooked Lake, a true story about my current dog, is about to be published, and is in memory of Martha.\n\nMy first children’s book, Willy of the Crooked Lake, was about a previous rescue dog we found, and it was published in 2015. This book was a fund-raiser to help complete a new shelter at the Finger Lakes SPCA in Bath, NY — we raised approximately $40,000 for that project, along with providing matching funds and connections that brought in tens of thousands more in support. I did book signings at the Lowry Center at a class reunion with the Willy book. Approximately 1800 Willy books have been distributed thus far. My wonderful collaborator and illustrator for the Willy book is an artist friend of many decades, Bonnie Mitchell, and the book was self-published.\n\nMaggie of the Crooked Lake, also self-published and also illustrated by Bonnie, will be a fund-raiser for two organizations dear to my heart: CareFirstNY, a hospice organization headquartered in Painted Post NY, and Bampa’s House, a comfort care home located in Corning NY. CareFirst helped me take care of my wife when she was terminally ill in 2014, and the current headquarters of CareFirstNY is located on what was once my grandparents’ land, in a decommissioned school once named for my grandfather. Bampa’s House was created by the family of one of my high school friends and is located in my original home town of Corning. The rationale, in part, for the choice of the two agencies is that Maggie was picked out at the SPCA by my wife before her illness (and her care by hospice), and the story relates how I lost my wife and how Maggie then “rescued” me and became my dog.\n\nJackie McMakin died on October 2nd, 2022, at age 88 in Shelburne, VT. She left this world the way she tried to live in it – present, active, and mindful. Her last week was spent reading contemplative texts, taking long canoe rides in Lake Champlain, writing, corresponding with friends, walking in the forest, skinny-dipping in the Lake, listening to Verdi’s Requiem, and enjoying time with her children.\n\nJackie grew up in New Rochelle, New York, the daughter of Robert and Virginia Straub. There she met the three great loves of her life – religious studies, her husband Dave (they were the Presbyterian church youth group together), and music. At the College of Wooster in Ohio, she majored in religion, kept dating Dave, and directed the campus choral group. Her junior year, she studied at the University of St. Andrews University in Scotland.\n\nJackie and Dave were married after graduation, and she moved to Japan where Dave was serving in the Air Force. Called to service, she and Dave then moved to Taegu, South Korea where they worked at a Presbyterian mission for two years, helping that nation with its post-war healing and reconstruction. From there they took the trip of a lifetime, taking a year to explore Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt.\n\nJackie’s early passions were church and civil rights. Integration was on everyone’s mind in the early sixties, and Jackie helped create sister bonds between white and black churches in DC. This interest in what we have in common versus what separates us led to her focus on bringing together different denominations and faiths in ecumenical settings, a master’s degree in religion from the Catholic University of America, and teaching posts at DC-area seminaries.\n\nJackie and Dave joined the Church of the Savior, an ecumenical church on Massachusetts Avenue, and were active members there for many years. During this time, Jackie began to write professionally, publishing more than 130 articles in national religious publications, mostly on ecumenism, spiritual development, and lay leadership as well as co-authoring the Doorways to Christian Growth series of books with Rhoda Nary.\n\nLater, she joined Sonya Dyer to create The Lab, a series of workshops focused on vocational discernment that started rooted in the Christian tradition but which they then broadened to include the full breadth and richness of human spiritual experience. With Sonya, she co-authored Working from the Heart.\n\nIn retirement, she and Dave moved from D.C to Vermont. For fifteen years, they would volunteer to help various communities overseas (in places as far-flung as South Africa, Australia, and Lithuania). Most recently, Jackie did a series of workshops for young people in Ukraine, an experience that gave her great joy but that has caused her concern as she has seen conflict envelop that country.\n\nJackie loved adventure. She and Dave took a big walk or bike ride every summer for more than two decades. Among many trips, they walked across Great Britain, biked from Amsterdam to Marseilles, and biked the length of the Danube.\n\nOn her 82nd birthday, Dave bought her an ultra-lite single-person canoe. It was her greatest joy to take that boat out on Lake Champlain during the summer and swim. She also had an abiding love of music. Her grandfather was a noted piano maker, and the apple did not fall far from the tree. Jackie played piano, flute, saxophone, clarinet, harmonica, violin, and accordion as well as being able to sight read. Throughout her life, she enjoyed conducting choral ensembles.\n\nIn her final years, she became passionate about the environment, penning Our Defining Moment: A Pocket Guide to Creating the Future We Truly Want as well as the death-with-dignity movement that works to guarantee the right of people to choose how they die. She wrote about her commitment to this cause in Looking Forward: Discovering the Art of Dying Well, her final book. At the end of her life, she decided to, “choose her exit ramp from life and not wait until it is too late to make that choice” by voluntarily stopping to eat or drink (VSED), an option for which she was an advocate.\n\nJackie was preceded in death by Dave and leaves behind two children, Tom McMakin who lives in Montana, and Peg Marshall who lives in Pennsylvania\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIt is real hot in the American West right now. August was the hottest month on record in parts of Montana, and it’s not letting up. Some areas are seeing 100-degree temperatures in September for the very first time. Climate forecasts project more heat waves in the future, so air conditioning is just going to become crucial in places where people have never needed it before. Here’s Montana Public Radio’s Aaron Bolton.\n\nALYSSA ALSOP: We have, like, 16 fans going.\n\nAARON BOLTON, BYLINE: Alyssa Alsop lives in a subsidized apartment complex just 17 miles from Glacier National Park. There’s no air conditioning here. And she says it’s been so hot inside, her 1-1/2-year-old daughter has been sick.\n\nALSOP: And then she started puking every night, probably a good three times a night. And I’m like, she’s too hot. I would give her three, four cold baths, but how many times can I do that?\n\nBOLTON: Alsop eventually took her daughter to the emergency room because she couldn’t stop vomiting.\n\nCathy Whitlock, a Montana State University professor who wrote Montana’s climate change assessment, says some are suffering more than others.\n\nCATHY WHITLOCK: It affects the old and the very young, people far from services, people with health conditions, people who live in poverty that don’t have access to cooling systems.\n\nBOLTON: Whitlock says summers like these will only become more common in climate models.\n\nWHITLOCK: So that covers large areas of Montana, and I think it’s probably our No. 1 concern about climate change going forward.\n\nBOLTON: Amy Cilimburg at the nonprofit Climate Smart Missoula is trying to help spur heat adaptation in Montana. Cooling centers don’t really work in rural areas with dispersed populations, so more people will need home air conditioning.\n\nAMY CILIMBURG: It’s not just a comfort thing. It’s actually essential to have the ability to cool your – the place that you sleep, right?\n\nBOLTON: Cilimburg has been working on helping low-income people get AC for about a year, but…\n\nCILIMBURG: How do we actually fund this?\n\nBOLTON: The most climate-friendly option is heat pumps, which also provide air conditioning, but can cost thousands of dollars.\n\nCILIMBURG: It’s complicated. And it – you know, these new heat pumps cost money. So that’s where the Inflation Reduction Act is just really exciting.\n\nBOLTON: The Inflation Reduction Act President Biden signed last month earmarks $4.3 billion for rebates to help low- and middle-income homeowners swallow the upfront cost of installing a heat pump. Cilimburg’s organization is preparing to help people navigate the new rebates and pick up additional costs. And a little AC makes a big difference. Alyssa Alsop in Columbia Falls was finally able to install a window air-conditioning unit, despite it being against her apartment complex rules.\n\nALSOP: I – we put that in yesterday, and it feels a lot better in here.\n\nBOLTON: Yeah. How hot was it getting in here?\n\nALSOP: I would say more than probably a hundred degrees. You know, it was to the point where you couldn’t sit in here.\n\nBOLTON: Alsop says with the cool air blowing, her daughter slept through the night without puking for the first time in days. Whether the Inflation Act’s incentives will lead landlords to outfit more apartments like Alsop’s with air conditioning remains to be seen.\n\nDiego Rivas with the nonprofit Northwest Energy Coalition says the federal government is still hashing out exactly what those incentives will look like.\n\nDIEGO RIVAS: But hopefully, with the IRA, these investments become, you know, cost-neutral, so to speak.\n\nBOLTON: How effective the legislation is in helping Montanans get air conditioning depends on how much this Republican state cooperates with the Biden White House, whether they can efficiently help people and landlords access the federal funding with minimum hassle.\n\nFor NPR News, I’m Aaron Bolton in Columbia Falls, Mont.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE HALIFAX PIER SONG, “STRANGE NEWS FROM ANOTHER STAR”)\n\nMark High, a member in the Detroit office of Dickinson Wright PLLC, has been named the recipient of the 16th Annual Stephen H. Schulman Outstanding Business Lawyer Award by the State Bar of Michigan’s Business Law Section. This prestigious award honors Michigan business lawyers who consistently exemplify the characteristics the Business Law Section seeks to foster and facilitate: the highest quality of professionalism, the highest quality of practice, and an unwavering dedication to service, ethical conduct, and collegiality within the practice of law.\n\nHigh specializes in business transactional matters including mergers and acquisitions, private equity, and corporate governance. He has worked at Dickinson Wright for 37 years. Before joining the firm, High spent time clerking for the Ohio State Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court with the late Justice David D. Dowd, Jr. High then practiced law at a Toledo-based firm before moving to Dickinson Wright.\n\nThroughout his distinguished career, High has counseled small and medium-sized entities in several industries to help with transactions ranging from $5 million to $150 million, along with Fortune 500 companies such as Johnson Controls and multiple other Tier One automotive suppliers. He also assisted many foreign entities with their U.S-based operations. He has a special affinity working for Canadian clients.\n\nHigh joins other experienced and accomplished business law attorneys who received the Schulman Award, including many leading business law attorneys in Michigan he looked up to in the 1980s. Some of High’s most substantial contributions to the Business Law Section include roles as chair and council member of the Business Law Section and a founder of the Section’s Small Business Forum. He has repeatedly served as an instructor at the Section’s annual Business Law Institute as well.\n\n“I remember attending the Section meetings when I was a young lawyer and (legal leaders and former Schulman recipients) Verne Hampton, Cy Moscow and others were leading the way,” High said. “The Section was still in its infancy then and I was amazed at the opportunities members had to help change (business) law for the better by being involved.”\n\nHigh grew up outside of Cleveland before attending The College of Wooster for his bachelor’s degree and Duke Law School for his J.D. He quickly gravitated to the transactional side of business law because it gave him the opportunity to help clients move forward in a positive direction. “Litigation was never for me,” High said.\n\nAs a council member and Section chair in the mid-2000s, the Grosse Pointe Park resident was focused on expanding the Section’s reach, especially with small-to-mid sized firms outside of the Detroit and Grand Rapids markets. He presented educational sessions with colleagues as a spin-off of the Business Law Institute in such communities as Traverse City, Kalamazoo, and Midland.\n\nWhile High helped to educate his legal colleagues as an instructor, he learned a few things along the way as well. One year he hosted an Institute training in Midland on November 15 and was surprised that only a handful of lawyers had shown up. A local attendee filled him in. “I learned that you never schedule anything in that part of the state on the first day of (firearm) deer hunting season,” High says. “We never made that mistake again.”\n\nIn addition to High’s work with the state bar’s Business Law Section, he has been involved in the American Bar Association’s Business Law Section and its Model Shareholder Agreement Task Force. High has served for over 10 years as President of the Canada – United States Business Association. He also is a former co-chair with the U.S. Law Firm Group’s Corporate and Securities Committee, a former member of the Business Advisory Board for the Institute of Continuing Legal Education, and a former member of the Alumni Board at The College of Wooster. He has served on the boards of Gleaners Community Food Bank and the Detroit Wine Organization.\n\nAs a result of his involvement in the Section, High recommends that business-focused attorneys of all ages throughout the state become involved to support their network building and continuing education. “It has been very useful to know the lawyers within the Section and I have actually completed many deals with them,” High said. “Having those strong relationships supported my practice and therefore my clients because it has made so many of these transactions smoother.”\n\nThe legal field also demands that its leaders set an example for future attorneys as well, High says. “We work in a profession where we have an obligation to give back and the entire process is very rewarding,” he added. “The people involved with the Section make it very easy for us all to benefit. Plus, it’s great to see the knowledge seamlessly passed from one generation to another.”\n\nHigh will be introduced at the Schulman Award Ceremony, held in conjunction with the Section’s annual meeting on October 7 in Grand Rapids. Former junior high classmate and long-time Dickinson Wright colleague Timothy Stoepker will introduce High at the Annual Meeting.\n\nReceived from Jim Sentman for 1972 Class Notes:\n\nOur reunion days, June 9 – 12th, were filled with so many brief moments of shared discovery and rediscovery that I want to write them down before I forget them. Our paths crossed again on a weekend of poignant, funny, and even random events that I treasure. Was the best one talking to Dr. Gordon Collins at our Coccia House pizza party? Or perhaps the many of us moved by the bag piper at the Memorial Service? Maybe a random statement over a breakfast? Finding a lost twin in Luce Lounge among the snacks & the drinks & the fellowship?\n\nSunday morning the congregation at Westminster House had invited all alumni to attend a special worship service at 10 a.m., but by 11:45, I returned to a deserted Luce Hall, to discover I was surely the last man standing in celebration of our 50th reunion. At Westminster, alumni were invited to speak about our spiritual journey in connection with Wooster, and four of us spoke. I want to share with you what I expressed.\n\nI defined the Holy Spirit as that divine spark within each of us humans that creates potential connections between us. I testified that I experienced that spark as a boy of 17, who came to Wooster for an education, but discovered a life changing culture among the students and professors I met. More importantly that spark was very much alive during Alumni Weekend when, over and over again, a decades old experience was relived among you my classmates and me. Old friendships, long dormant, came alive again. New ones formed. I know Wooster is indeed a real community of caring and supporting people. Apparently, that did not end on graduation day.\n\nAs if in affirmation of all I’d said, it turns out during the worship service a stranger I was sitting with at Westminster House turned out to be Professor Vivian Holliday of the Classics Department, who had taught me Mythology in 1971. I began to weep when I rediscovered her and was able to thank her for all she gave to me decades past.\n\nI hope that any of you whom I spoke to during our reunion knows exactly what I mean by a brief connecting moment we had that weekend. I would love to share them all here in this message. But, instead, I hope that each of you will get to your laptop and send in some special memories either of this June 2022 at Wooster or perhaps from our shared days long ago.\n\nJim Sentman"
