        "text": "\"This is one more humiliation for Illinois. We need better leaders.\" That was U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk's comment after the Senate Ethics Committee admonished U.S. Sen. Roland Burris of Illinois in November.\n\nIt is one of the reasons he said he joined a crowded Republican field to win back Barack Obama's former Senate seat which federal prosecutors say ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich tried to sell to the highest bidder. The then-governor later awarded it to Mr. Burris under what critics suggest were suspicious circumstances.\n\nThe latest polls show Rep. Kirk leading by a substantial margin over the five other GOP contenders -- Patrick Hughes, Kathleen Thomas, Don Lowery, John Arrington and Andy Martin -- but a significant number of voters remain undecided as Tuesday's primary approaches.\n\nThe crowded field is dominated by social conservatives who appeal to the Illinois GOP's right wing. That faction has been a powerful force in primary politics. Its winners, however, have not enjoyed much success in the General Election. That, Rep. Kirk suggested to our editorial board, is one of his major advantages. As a social moderate who supports abortion and gay rights, and a fiscal conservative, he believes he will appeal to a wider base of voters come November.\n\nBorn in Champaign, Mr. Kirk grew up in Chatham, Downers Grove and Kenilworth. He holds a masters degree from the London School of Economics and a law degree from Georgetown. He began his career working for U.S. Rep. John Porter, whom he replaced. His background includes stints on the World Bank and at the State Department.\n\nAs a commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve, the intelligence officer has served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and Bosnia. In December he was deployed to Afghanistan, which his campaign said makes him the first member of Congress to serve in an imminent-danger zone since 1942. In 1999, the Navy named him Intelligence Officer of the Year for his work in Kosovo.\n\nMr. Kirk said active-duty service gives him a unique perspect on America's mililtary mission here and at home. The self-professed hawk says he supports the Obama administration's surge in Afghanistan. In trouble spots like Yemen and Iran, he backs \"diplomacy with consequences.\"\n\nThough opponents have tried to connect him with the economic policies of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Kirk said as a member of the House Appropriations Commitee and co-chair of the moderage GOP Tuesday Group, he has fought majority Democrats on a number of issues.\n\nHe co-sponsored a measure to end earmarks and said he helped to kill the infamous Alaskan bridge to nowhere. He voted against the Democrat's stimulus plan and offered two amendments: one successfully cut $200 million to resod the National Mall, the other creating a bipartisan oversight panel was rejected.\n\nHe backs a capital gains tax cut, the elimination of the estate tax, a line-item veto and a balanced-budget amendment, and he would make the Bush-era tax cuts permanent.\n\nHe acknowledged that he has taken criticism for a change of heart on the Cap and Trade energy bill. He was among just eight House Republicans to vote for it. He did so, he said, because it was \"in the narrow interests of my district.\"\n\nOnce he became a Senate candidate, his focus changed and he realized the measure would hurt Illinois agriculture and other downstate industries.\n\nHe has been an early and vocal critic of Guantanamo Bay prisoners at the Thomson Correctional Center because he is unconvinced that authorities can promise the area can be made safe from terrorists. He would back turning it into a federal lock up to ease overcrowding in the federal system.\n\nHe said America needs health-care reform and the GOPneeds to lay out a solid program of its own to taxpayers. There is an alternative, he said, but it has had too little attention. He said he would support reforms that include prohibiting any law that interferes with a decision between patients and doctors, tort reform and granting Americans the right to buy coverage in \"any state in the union.\"\n\nOn ethics reform, he lauded the work of federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald in uncovering and prosecuting Illinois political corruption. As senator, he said, he would support the appointment of more tough-on-corruptionU.S. attorneys. He also said he has led the fight to cancel pensions for members of Congress such as Dan Rostenkowski, Duke Cunningham, James Traficant and Bob Ney who have been receiving that money even though they are convicted felons.\n\nMark Kirk\n\n* Born in Champaign and grew up in Chatham, Downers Grove and Kenilworth.\n\n* Graduated from New Trier High School, Winnetka, and attended Blackburn College and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico before earning a B.A. from Cornell; Masters Degree from the London School of Economics; law degree from Georgetown University.\n\n* Five-term Congressman from northern suburbs of Chicago; began his career on the staff of his predecessor, U.S. Rep.
