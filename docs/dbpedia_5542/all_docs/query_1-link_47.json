        "text": "<p>So is Georgetown the best school for a future politician?</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking in terms of:</p>\n\n<p>low levels political apathy?\n\nHearing different viewpoints?\n\nInternational and national focus?\n\nGood programs for:\n\npoly sci?\n\nInternational Relations?\n\nPublic Policy?\n\nother politically based majors?</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in being a politician, Harvard or Yale. If youre interested in working in politics (aide, thinktank, lobbyist) Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson school or Georgetown. If Harvard and Yale are a bit lofty for you to get into as an undergrad, a great route for a politician is to go to your state school (depending on the state, of course).</p>\n\n<p>Georgetown has six current US Senators, four current Governors and about 15 Congressmen in office.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Kirk from Illinois and Michael Castle of Delaware are leading in their races too… Georgetown could end up with eight alumini in the 100 member senate in January.</p>\n\n<p>MSauce didn’t say it was a better route, they said it was a great route which I can personally attest to being true. State schools have strong ties to the local community and can feed people into community organizing, campaign/district office of congressional members, or other state political orgs which will all help train them to eventually be ready for state political positions such as county commissioner, assembly/senate, board of regents, etc. which can later on eventually leads upwards.</p>\n\n<p>For someone interested in strictly federal/international level work for state agencies and what not, Georgetown would be better though.</p>\n\n<p>There is more to working in politics than just being a U.S. Senator :)</p>\n\n<p>thanks guys, </p>\n\n<p>just a couple thoughts:</p>\n\n<p>I was reading a related thread, and someone made this good comment: “Harvard, Princeton, Yale would be the best school for those who wish to study the halls of power, and Georgetown would be the best school for those who wish to walk these halls” or something to that degree.</p>\n\n<p>I would assume that was said b/c of internship opportunities in DC and access to countless NGO’s, Interest goups, 527’s, rallies and speeches. </p>\n\n<p>But then again, HYP, might allow a future politician to understand the issues better because of their extraordinary strength in economics, history, law, environmental science etc, </p>\n\n<p>although, doesnt Georgetown have the best International Relations program in the country, plus a very strong study abroad program?</p>\n\n<p>There are more members of the House of Representatives from Georgetown than any other school. Georgetown attracts people interested in politics and puts them in a town where they can develop that interest. That said, I don’t think education plays any role in preparing you to be a politician or not. It’s things you don’t learn in school that lead to success in politics: people skills, money, connections, a winning smile, a sincere-sounding voice, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Columbia should be in the mix as a ‘best school’ for future politicians, politicos and the like.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the alum base, which includes folks like Barack Obama, President of the U.S. CC’83, Eric Holder, Attorney General, CC’73, Judd Gregg, New Hampshire Senator, CC’69, conservative pundit Ben Stein, CC’66, Ben Jealous, CC’95, President of NAACP, George Stephanopoulos, CC’82, now Anchor of Good Morning America, David Paterson, CC’77, Governor of NY State, Mike Mukasey, CC’63, the previous Attorney General, several US reps, major city mayors, and even Meagan McCain, CC’07, just to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a long history of Supreme Court Justices like John Jay, founding fathers like Alexander Hamilton and major world leaders who have graduated (founder of the African National Congress, writer of the Indian Constitution, major ambassadors to nations during challenging periods in modern history). </p>\n\n<p>Columbia is arguably the most politically active campus in the country where undergraduates are not afraid to protest, counter-protest and take on some tough conversations. Surprisingly, the campus is more diverse politically than you might think.</p>\n\n<p>Columbia brings major national and world leaders to campus through The World Leaders Forum, The Earth Institute and ServiceNation.</p>\n\n<p>One of the world’s best Political Science departments with exclusive internships at the United Nations among other opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Just adding CU to the mix.</p>"
