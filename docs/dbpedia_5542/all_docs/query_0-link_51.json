        "text": "Parents rely on sports – and trained coaches – to help their children build character and learn life skills, including working with others.\n\nCHICAGO, Ill. & PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (Aug. 19, 2024) – While 93% of parents agree that kids can learn important life skills from playing sports, four out of five parents also believe there is a shortage of high-caliber coaches today.\n\nThat is from a new survey by global consulting and market research firm, The Harris Poll, and youth development organization, First Tee. The U.S.-based survey was conducted online in April 2024 with feedback from 2,049 adults.​\n\nThe survey captured data on youth involvement in extracurricular activities and sports. The data was also analyzed by gender, age, race, education, and income, among other characteristics.​\n\n“Since our mission is centered on positive youth development, we think it is important to seek parents’ perspectives as the world around them continues to change and their kids face new challenges,” said First Tee CEO Greg McLaughlin. “It helps us better understand and serve youth, and in the case of this study, it reinforces the importance of our investment in training our coaches.”\n\nFirst Tee’s network of 150 chapters engages more than 5,000 active, trained coaches who deliver a curriculum designed with input from youth development experts using golf as the platform. The training system is built on research-proven methods of positive youth development, providing coaches with the tools to make kids feel safe, included and empowered. As part of First Tee’s onboarding, each coach is background-checked and completes training from the U.S. Center for SafeSport.\n\nThe key findings from the survey include:\n\n89% of parents feel character is a lost value that should be more emphasized in today’s society – an increase of +4 percentage points from the 2023 survey. Today’s kids and teens are facing new challenges, and strength of character is essential for overcoming obstacles. Parents understand that need, as nine out of 10 parents seek opportunities for their kids to build character.\n\nParents believe sports can help close the character gap. Parents put their kids in extracurricular activities – with sports being most popular – for socialization and to build confidence. According to 93% of parents, children learn important life skills from playing sports.\n\nParents believe coaches are essential to youth development. Parents turn to coaches to help teach their kids character, self-confidence, determination and leadership. 91% of parents agree that sports coaching should inspire children to excel both on and off the field.\n\nSafety is critically important to parents. They prefer coaches who have been background checked, with 94% of parents citing it as a priority in today’s world and 83% wishing their child had more access to well-trained coaches.\n\n“While every generation confronts their own unique challenges, kids are facing new barriers to character development,” said Harris Poll CEO Will Johnson. “Our research findings make it clear: Parents, when registering your kids for the upcoming school year, don’t forget the critical development that comes outside the classroom.”\n\nThis is the second annual research collaboration between The Harris Poll and First Tee.\n\nDownload the full 2024 Report.\n\nFor the results of the 2023 parent survey, click here.\n\n***\n\nAbout PGA TOUR First Tee Foundation (“First Tee”)\n\nFirst Tee (www.firsttee.org) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit youth development organization that is supported by the PGA TOUR. Its mission is to impact the lives of young people by providing educational programs that build character and instill life-enhancing values through the game of golf.

Headquartered in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, USA, programs are delivered in all 50 United States and select international locations. President George W. Bush serves as Honorary Chair.\n\nAbout The Harris Poll\n\nThe Harris Poll is a global consulting and market research firm that strives to reveal the authentic values of modern society to inspire leaders to create a better tomorrow.

(August 5, 2024) – First Tee and PGA TOUR Superstore are set to host 40 teens from across the country at West Creek Ranch, an intimate setting in Montana for leadership development, community building and connection. Owned by PGA TOUR Superstore chairman and First Tee board member Arthur M. Blank, the picturesque ranch is the perfect setting for a once-in-a-lifetime experience for these teens to explore leadership development, community building and problem solving. Students spend much of the time in outdoor interactions including whitewater rafting, horseback riding and archery, based on the belief that connections made in nature provide benefits that cannot be replicated in the classroom.\n\nEach week will tee off with keynote speakers who will discuss their individual leadership, share life experiences and examine how they have grown through opportunities and challenges. The first week will feature actor Michael Peña, while actor and First Tee alumnus Kathryn Newton will be the featured speaker during the second week.\n\nThe First Tee Leadership Summit is designed to help teens grow their leadership skills through hands-on activities that require teamwork and personal strength. Daily leadership themes include pursuing goals, growing through challenges and building positive self-identity.\n\nThis is the fourth consecutive year that nonprofit youth development organization First Tee and PGA TOUR Superstore will hold this event at West Creek Ranch. This year’s group comes from 25 cities across the country, with 20 teens attending each week. West Creek Ranch is a 6,600-acre working ranch in Emigrant, Montana, that is bordered by the Yellowstone River and Gallatin National Forest.\n\n“We are excited to host these 40 impressive teens for an unforgettable week of personal growth and relationship building,” said Dick Sullivan, Executive Chairman & CEO, PGA TOUR Superstore. “So many lessons from golf can be applied to life, and we truly believe in the positive impact sports can have on kids and teens, which is why we’re proud to support this event and partner with First Tee chapters across the country.”\n\n“Thank you to Arthur Blank and PGA TOUR Superstore for their continued generosity in supporting this event,” added Greg McLaughlin, First Tee CEO. “The lessons these young leaders will take away from Montana will shape their futures in remarkable ways.”\n\nAt the conclusion of the Summit, four students will be selected for the First Tee College Scholarship Program and will receive financial support as well as access to mentorship and professional development opportunities throughout college.\n\nTo be eligible for the Summit, teens completed a five-week Leadership Series that was hosted at PGA TOUR Superstore locations across the country, before completing applications that outlined their leadership experience and goals. For more than a decade, PGA TOUR Superstore and Arthur Blank have championed First Tee’s mission through donations and by supporting participant events, including the Leadership Summit and the Leadership Academy, which is held in Atlanta.\n\nThe Leadership Summit is one of several national opportunities provided by First Tee to expose teens to new challenges and inspire them as they prepare to embark on life after high school.\n\nSee the full field of participants.\n\nClemson, South Carolina (June 27, 2024) – Norah Yang of Los Altos, California, and Trent Mierl of Austin, Texas, won the girls’ and boys’ divisions of the 4th annual First Tee National Championship at the Walker Course at Clemson University. The event brought together First Tee’s elite golfers for an opportunity to showcase how the program has helped build the confidence, perseverance and skills needed to play at the next level.\n\nYang finished the tournament 6-under-par and shot a final round 69 to clench the victory on the girls’ side. She is a rising high school senior with a 4.0 GPA. She’s been a volunteer coach at First Tee – Silicon Valley for three years and finished 3rd at the 2023 PURE Insurance Championship, a PGA Tour Champions event that pairs First Tee juniors with professional players for a week of competition and mentorship at Pebble Beach.\n\n“It has been amazing playing at Clemson this week,” Yang said. “I have met so many amazing players from all the other chapters and had so many great experiences. Getting here and winning would not have been possible without First Tee and all the skills they have taught me.”\n\nMierl, who will play golf at the University of Missouri next year, shot a blistering 65 in the final round to finish 9-under for the tournament. He’s been a member of First Tee for nine years and is a volunteer coach at his chapter. He’s the only player to compete in all four First Tee National Championships, with the inaugural event taking place in 2021, and said it was special to win in his final attempt.\n\n“I came up one shot short of the playoffs in the first National Championship,” he said. “I’ve met great people here and made so many great memories. This is my favorite junior golf event, and it feels like I came full circle in my final chance to win at the same golf course where I fell just short.”\n\nBoth winners were awarded with the Tattersall Cup in honor of event chairman Fred Tattersall.\n\nTwo players were also awarded exemptions to the 2024 PURE Insurance Championship. As First Tee juniors can only play in the PURE Insurance Championship once, this year’s exemptions went to Gianna Singh from First Tee – Greater Sacramento and Spencer Ives from First Tee – Naples/Collier. The tournament will be broadcast on Golf Channel, Sept. 20-22.\n\nBased on their play at the First Tee National Championship, two players will also earn spots in the PGA TOUR’s Pathways to Progression program, which aims to support talented golfers from backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented in the sport. The PGA TOUR will announce the full roster for its Pathways program, including the two players who earned their spots at the First Tee National Championship, in the coming days.\n\n“Congratulations to all of our participants in the field and especially to Trent and Norah for an outstanding performance in becoming the 2024 First Tee National Champions,” said Greg McLaughlin, First Tee CEO. “This event plays an important role in helping these young people prepare for the next level. We are extremely proud of this event and of the teens who work hard on their game all year preparing. Thank you to Clemson University for hosting for the second time, we look forward to coming back again.”\n\nThe First Tee National Championship is held annually at various college golf courses around the nation, providing First Tee participants the opportunity to network with others from across the country.

That includes 2023 winner Megan Meng of First Tee – Greater Trenton, who’s in the Top 10 in the AJGA Rankings and will begin her collegiate career at Northwestern this fall.\n\nIn advance of this year’s competition, the event will feature a keynote address by First Tee – Greater Richmond alumnus Gavin Parker, PGA, who shares his love for the sport on his popular social media channels. Participants will also attend a careers in golf panel to learn more about working in the industry.\n\n“First Tee continues to play an important role in the development of teens, both on and off the course,” said First Tee CEO Greg McLaughlin. “Our National Championship is an opportunity for participants who want to take their game to the next level to showcase their skills. The week provides them with competition and an enriching opportunity to get them ready for playing in college and beyond.”\n\nFor the first time, viewers can stream the First Tee National Championship on Gamekast. Scoring will also be available on Golf Genius.\n\nIn addition to crowning a male and female tournament winner, one boy and one girl from the field will be awarded spots in the PGA TOUR’s Pathways to Progression program, a player development program that aims to achieve greater diversity in golf through an increased focus on developing talent from diverse and historically underrepresented groups.\n\nFirst Tee – Greater Austin’s Danica Lundgren earned a spot in the Pathways program at last year’s National Championship, held at Stanford University. She’s back in the tournament field this year before joining the Nebraska Cornhuskers women’s golf team this fall.\n\nTwo exemptions to this year’s PURE Insurance Championship will also be up for grabs.
