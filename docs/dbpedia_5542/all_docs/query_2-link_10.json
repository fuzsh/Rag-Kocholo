        "text": "In 2000, Mark was elected to the House of Representatives where he served five terms before his election to the U.S. Senate in 2010. During his 17 years in Congress, Kirk was known for his staunch support of human rights. He co-founded the Senate Human Rights Caucus and was one of the only members of Congress to post publicly on Movements.org, where he offered his support to dissidents around the world. In January 2012, Senator Kirk suffered an ischemic stroke and underwent surgeries at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to relieve swelling in his brain. After nearly a year of intensive recovery and rehabilitation, Senator Kirk triumphantly returned to work by climbing the 45 steps of the U.S. Capitol on January 3, 2013. Friends and colleagues from both sides of the aisle cheered as Senator Kirk walked up the Capitol steps. Senator Kirk regards his return to the Senate as one of the greatest moments of his life."
