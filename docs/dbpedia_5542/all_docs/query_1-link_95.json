They don't tend to be the rainmakers,” Julie Fershtman 86L says in a Q & A with Crain’s Detroit Business. “The networking program is for women to share concerns and support and promote each other. Over the last 30 years, just about every law school shows admission criteria for its first year students. Enrollment is made up of 50 percent women. That was true of my class when I went to Emory Law School in 1983.” Read the story.\n\nOn June 1, Christine E. Howard 90L started a three-year term on Fisher Phillips’ Management Committee.

I think it’s what makes trial lawyers different. This isn’t a job for us,” Speed told the Daily Report in April, when her year as president ended. “We’re a one-issue organization,” she adds. “We’re focused on protecting the right to trial by jury.” Speed will serve on the executive committee for another year as immediate past president, and return her focus to Speed & King, the litigation firm she started with Michelle King two years ago.

It’s billed as “an evening with two all-star lawyers and their legal journey from the South Bronx to streaming superstardom.”\n\n“The NFCJ provides critical support for the nation’s criminal defense bar—the constitutionally-ordained guardians of individual liberty,” Findling said. “The criminal defense function is the ultimate brake on governmental power versus the individual, and the NFCJ ensures that the defense bar is robust in defense of the individual and pursuit of criminal justice reform. Whether assuring the government needs a warrant to search a cellphone, advocating for Brady reform, or training and ensuring that everyone has an effective lawyer, the NFCJ is the most important charity I can think of to fix America’s criminal justice system.”\n\nOn April 2, President Donald Trump announced he intends to nominate Steven Grimberg 98L for U.S. District Court judge, to serve in Atlanta. Grimberg is a former U.S. attorney known for prosecuting white-collar and cyber crimes, who served with the Department of Justice for more than 12 years. In 2018, he joined Nardello & Co., where he is managing director, head of the Atlanta office, and general counsel of the Americas. Grimberg is also an adjunct professor at Emory Law.

Lawyers Say Diversity Still Can Be Just for Show.” The headline: “A steady stream of initiatives has scarcely increased the ranks of lawyers of color in Big Law—amid concerns that some are used as ‘window dressing’ for client pitches.”\n\n“We’ve made great strides, but it’s been in baby steps,” Sears said. She was the first black female lawyer at Alston & Bird’s predecessor, Alston Miller & Gaines, and went on to become the youngest-ever Georgia Supreme Court justice. In the ‘80s, “it was pretty obvious that you weren’t going to get the same kind of opportunities that were going to young men who looked like the partners,” she said. “It’s better than just tokenism now,” she said. “But we have not come as far as we need to. It’s not a walk in the park for any minority now at any firm.” Read the story.\n\nLisa Lott 94L took the bench as Superior Court judge for Georgia’s Western Judicial Circuit on Jan 1. But her election last year was both remarkable and a first.\n\nShe was the first woman elected to that bench, but also one of only two judges in the Western Circuit’s 118-year history who won their seat purely by election, rather than first serving as a governor’s appointee. Other than Judge David Sweat’s election in 2002, “the other judges who were appointed retained their seat in subsequent elections,” Lott said. “Although I have to say there were very few challengers throughout that history.”\n\nLast May, Lott won with 54.6 of the vote against Judge Regina Quick, who Gov. Nathan Deal appointed in August 2017. Prior to that, Quick was a Georgia State House representative. Lott, a longtime public defender who lives in Athens, campaigned on the idea that judicial appointees often don’t reflect the cities they serve, she said.\n\n“It is time for our community to elect our judges, as opposed to Atlanta appointing all of our superior court judges … And by Atlanta, I mean the governor,” Lott told the Red & Black.\n\n“I’ve been a public servant in our community for the last 18 years ... I’ve had my feet on the ground, working in this community for those less fortunate,” Lott said during the campaign. “I’ve been involved in this community as a volunteer, as a concerned citizen, and as a parent. I know what makes this community tick. That is perspective which I believe is an essential characteristic for a fair and impartial judge.” The Western Circuit includes Clarke and Oconee Counties. Lott will serve a four-year term.\n\nChristine Norstadt 09L has joined Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White, Williams & Aughtry as senior counsel. For 18 years, she and Stephanie Friese, who also joined the firm, have advised clients in all phases of commercial development and transactions.\n\n“Stephanie and Christine’s depth of experience is an asset to our growing Atlanta office,” said Managing Shareholder Wayne Risoli. “The strategic expansion of our real estate practice is in response to client needs and is reflective of our commitment to providing integrated services for virtually all legal matters related to real estate transactions and development.”\n\nIn 2018, the pair negotiated more than one million square feet of office leases totaling more than $50 million in value.

Battiste III 74L. “A community leader, philanthropist, and public servant, Battiste epitomizes the values the CMA recognizes each year with the Craft Award,” according to a press release. Battiste received the award, named for the CMA’s first director, on Nov. 14, 2018.\n\n“Luther Battiste is a positive force in the life of our community, a person distinguished for his balanced and productive leadership and love of the arts,” said Executive Director Della Watkins. “He has happily contributed to the museum’s growth and continuing success and served with modesty as an example for how to strengthen our shared commitment to culture.

Goldstein 77L celebrated her new series debut with the release of One Taste Too Many (published by Kensington Books) on Dec. 18, 2018.\n\nGoldstein is an Agatha and Anthony Award finalist, and here’s a synopsis of the book: “It introduces Sarah Blair, a culinary-challenged, recently-divorced woman adjusting to her new status as ‘single,’ her new studio apartment—which she shares with her Siamese cat, RahRah—and her new job as a law firm receptionist. When her ex-husband gets murdered and her twin sister becomes the top suspect, Sarah will have to add ‘solving crimes’ to the list of challenges she’s taking on.”\n\n“The time has come to sail off into the sunset,” Clay Seaman 74L writes. He spent 20 years in the Navy JAG Corps and retired in 1994. His service included forward tours in the eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. “For the last 20 years or so, I have had something of a niche appellate practice,” he says. “I have only six clients, all of whom live in relatively close proximity in the most exclusive gated community in California--Death Row at San Quentin,” He now lives in Prescott, Arizona, with his wife, Nancy. “Soon, we’ll be able to hike in the western national parks, putter in the garden and play with the dogs. Not bad things to do in retirement.”\n\nJulie Fershtman 83C 86L, equity shareholder with Foster Swift Collins & Smith, received the Michigan Bar’s highest honor at the State Bar’s NEXT Conference and Annual Meeting, held in September in Grand Rapids. The Roberts P. Hudson Award commends “one or more lawyers for their unselfish rendering of outstanding and unique service to and on behalf of the State Bar of Michigan, the legal profession and public.” The award isn’t given annually, but awarded periodically based on merit. Fershtman is co-recipient with Bruce Courtade.\n\n“My father was a lawyer. My husband is a lawyer. It was a commitment I was born into as the daughter of a lawyer who really took his job very seriously,” Fershtman said. “You don’t become a lawyer without a significant and sincere commitment to the public and the people you serve. When you become a lawyer, your commitment is serving your clients and protecting them.”\n\nA book by Carrie Baker 94L, Fighting the US Youth Sex Trade: Gender, Race, and Politics was published in September by Cambridge University Press. “Earlier this year, Congress passed two laws that allow states to criminally prosecute internet service providers who 'promote or facilitate' prostitution of another person and allow individuals to sue internet service providers for civil damages for harm resulting from such actions,” Baker writes on the Cambridge blog. “These laws resulted from the efforts of a politically and ideologically diverse anti-child-sex-trafficking movement that included conservatives and liberals, feminists, evangelical Christians, and others. But despite the broad-based, bipartisan support for these laws, the politics behind them are complicated.” Baker is director of the Program for the Study of Women and Gender at Smith College.

He estimates he's written a thousand. His last day was Aug. 31. “It’s bittersweet leaving,” Hines told the Daily Report. “I’m not one to look back. The practice of law has been good to me. I’m one of those who have always been able to like what they do.” Read the story.\n\nDrew Findling 84L was sworn in as president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers at its annual meeting on July 29. He was also the 2018 recipient of NACDL’s Robert C. Heeney Memorial Award, an honor presented annually to the member who best demonstrates the goals and values of the association and of the legal profession.\n\n“Drew Findling’s entire life has been about service and the defense of people against whom the deck is clearly stacked, people who quite literally are oppressed by our criminal justice system” said past president Rick Jones. Findling was sworn by Vernon S. Pitts Jr., who hired Findling as a public defender 33 years ago.\n\n“I will not be able to sleep at night if during the next twelve months I do nothing to lessen the impact of collateral consequences for the men and women who have been arrested, prosecuted and/or convicted of a crime; especially those who have been sentenced to prison,” Findling said. “I will only be able to sleep better at night after I know I have done something to ease their transition back to society, by helping to restore their right to vote, enhance their opportunity to get jobs that pay living wages and overall reestablish themselves as citizens whose past misdeeds have truly been forgiven and forgotten.”\n\nDrew Findling 84L is due to be sworn in as president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers on July 29 in Miami. But last year as president-elect, he let the group know he wanted to focus on how those who have been incarcerated can successfully reenter society.\n\n“The product of that idea is a three-day gathering of defense attorneys, judges, prosecutors, celebrities and former prison inmates in Atlanta Aug. 23-25,” according to the Daily Report. It’s titled: “Shattering the Shackles of Collateral Consequences: Exploring Moral Principles and Economic Innovations to Restore Rights and Opportunities.” Scheduled speakers include: Gov. Nathan Deal, former U.S. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, NAACP President Derrick Johnson, Koch Industries GC Mark Holden, and Georgetown law professor Shon Hopwood.

The vacancies were created by two women justices leaving, Katheryn Tucker writes.\n\n“When the new justices are being selected for the Georgia Supreme Court—unless we’re willing, in this day and age, to once again accept an all-male court, which is predominantly white, that neither reflects the diversity of the population served nor that of the legal profession itself—diversity must be a priority rather than an afterthought,” Sears said.\n\n“It is, without question, imperative that our bench reflect the natural and inherent diversity of our beloved state,” Clark said. “When the bench is reflective of our diverse citizenry, there is greater confidence in the court’s rulings. Greater confidence in the bench’s rulings results in greater acceptance of its authority. Greater acceptance of the Court’s authority directly results in appreciation of the Rule of Law. This is a good thing.”\n\nRead the story.\n\nSenior Judge Frank M. Hull 73L, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, received the Lifetime Achievement Award this year at the Daily Report’s 2018 Georgia Legal Awards annual ceremony.\n\n“I simply loved being on the State Court of Fulton County, which I still consider my most important challenge and accomplishment, because I tried cases constantly,” she told the newspaper in an interview. “In my view, state courts of our country handle collectively 10 million cases, while all federal district courts had 250,000 total and 60,000 appeals collectively before all federal courts. My most important and favorite job will remain the State Court of Fulton County due to the constant daily interaction with litigants, lawyers and the community. The ‘lower the level’ of the court, the more important the court, as it is where most experience justice or do not.”\n\nRead the story.\n\nMark Wasserman 86L, U.S. CEO for Eversheds Sutherland, told the Daily Report that the firm’s U.S. branch aims to have women represent at least 30 percent of its total partners and its equity partners by 2021.\n\n“To move the needle, everyone in the firm needs a target,” Wasserman said. “We use metrics in other ways—[that] we want to have revenue of X and work of Y—so why not do so about something as important as our diversity and inclusion numbers?” Read the story.\n\nAmy Weil 81Lhas been invited by the U.S. Supreme Court to brief and argue a specific position in an attorneys’ fee dispute (in a social security case) that will likely be argued next term. Typically, these rare appointments typically go to former high court clerks, Bloomberg Law reports. It’s the first time justices have asked a non-former clerk to argue as an amicus in an upcoming case in over a decade, according to Bloomberg research. There have only been 51 other such appointments since the practice began in 1966, according Adam Feldman, who blogged about the practice in January.
