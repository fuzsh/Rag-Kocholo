        "text": "(born 1959). American politician Mark Kirk was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 2010. He represented Illinois in that body for a single term.\n\nMark Steven Kirk was born on September 15, 1959, in Champaign, Illinois. He attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City before graduating from Cornell University with a bachelor’s degree in 1981. He then earned a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1982, and from 1984 to 1990 he served on the staff of U.S. Representative John Porter. Kirk studied law at Georgetown University. After receiving his law degree in 1992, he worked briefly as a special assistant in the U.S. State Department and then practiced law for several years. He also served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as an intelligence officer from 1989 to 2013. Kirk had noncombat roles in air campaigns in Yugoslavia and Iraq; he retired from the military with the rank of commander.\n\nIn 1999 Kirk returned to Illinois to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. After narrowly winning the election, he took office in 2001. He served in the House until 2010, when he ran in a special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat that had been held by Barack Obama and then appointee Roland Burris. Despite some controversies—notably, Kirk misstated some facts of his military service—he won the close election and took office soon thereafter. In January 2012 Kirk suffered a major stroke that required surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation. He returned to the Senate in January 2013."
