Upon her swearing-in, Judge Kreuziger became the first female and first African-American superior court judge in the circuit.\n\nNominated by her predecessor, Griffin Judicial Circuit Chief Judge Christopher C. Edwards, stated, “I know she will fit right into the bench with our four other excellent judges.” Judge Kreuziger was appointed by Governor Kemp on July 20, 2021 and sworn in on August 19, 2021.\n\nWhile a student at AJMLS, Judge Kreuziger was a member of the mock trial team, editor-in-chief of the The Advocate newsletter, and the first AJMLS student to intern at the Attorney General’s Office. As a forensic scientist, she attended classes both day and night while maintaining her previous career. She credits the Law School’s flexibility with her ability to manage working as a scientist and attending law classes, and describes her experience at the school as “phenomenal”.\n\n“If you are willing to put in the time and effort, Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School will afford you every opportunity you need,” says Judge Kreuziger.\n\nThis appointment is not her first post on the bench having served the Griffin Judicial Circuit as the Associate Juvenile Court Judge, and previously, Chief Judge of the City of Fayetteville Municipal Court.\n\nPrior to the bench, Judge Kreuziger served as an Assistant District Attorney in the Griffin Judicial Circuit before opening her own law practice. Her practice focused on Criminal Law, Family Law, and General Civil Litigation.\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School is pleased to celebrate this historic milestone and wishes Judge Kreuziger much success in her new role.\n\nAugust 2021 Employee of the Month, Hal Morgan\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) established its Employee of the Month Program in 2021 to recognize hard working employees, especially as we navigate uncharted times in legal education. AJMLS appreciates the efforts of its employees who strive to achieve goals and fulfill the vision of Atlanta’s John Marshall. Outstanding employees deserve to be recognized both as a reward for exceptional performance and as a model to others. The program seeks to recognize hard work and achievement in the workplace and is a peer-to-peer recognition program.\n\nThe August 2021 Employee of the Month recipient is Hal Morgan, Enterprise Systems Administrator.\n\nHal joined the AJMLS family in March of 2015.

Top Ten Tips to Maintain Focus in a Virtual Class Environment\n\nWritten by: Scot Goins, Assistant Dean of Academic Achievement and Bar Success\n\nThe most frequent concerns I hear from students around any shift to a virtual environment are in regards to staying focused, paying attention, and making sure they continue to learn and expand their knowledge. Many students express frustration around the difficulties of concentrating in a remote classroom and are concerned that their performances may suffer. The good news is that although this learning environment can create new challenges, it is one that you can survive and even thrive in. These tips work great in any virtual learning environment, whether in law school or preparing for the bar exam.\n\nHere are my top ten tips for maintaining focus, attention, and learning in the virtual world:\n\n1. Designate a space.\n\nOne of the interesting things I’ve noticed about myself over the past year is my tendency to perform better when I set aside an area that is just for working. I think of it much like going to the gym. Once you walk in the door, you are likely to flip a mental switch and your expectations shift as to what to expect in that environment. When you hear the sounds of weights clanking, treadmills grinding, or someone like me complaining that I cannot get the double knot out of my shoes, you know where you are and what you are there to accomplish.\n\nVirtual learning is the same way. If you attempt to work from a space where you often engage in other activities, whether it’s sleeping, watching tv, or reading a book, it can be hard not to let your mind wander. Set aside a space where you live to engage actively with your learning environment, and try not to do other things there.\n\nThat said, I remain very aware of the constrictions of working from home for many, and you may not have a space that is readily available to be set aside. In that case, I recommend that when the time comes for a class that you change the space around, effectively creating a work environment. This could be something as simple as setting out some highlighters and some books, moving a vase, or clearing off the table, but the key is that you have a transition moment for the space and your learning. When you know you are entering your proverbial mental gym, your expectations, mindset, and mood will adjust accordingly.\n\n2. Turn on your camera.\n\nTrust me, I know. The thought of making sure you are camera-ready can be concerning, but being on camera is important. For starters, it involves you directly in the class, as opposed to observing from afar. The awareness that others can see if you are paying attention operates similarly in class, and your tendency to avoid staring at the ceiling and singing show tunes will decrease dramatically when you know someone might see.\n\nAll kidding aside, being on camera also helps your professor to engage with you. One of the biggest things I struggle with within the virtual environment when engaging with students is being able to see expressions. Oftentimes, I assume that I am making my point, only to see looks of confusion in my audience, and that helps me realize that I need to try a different approach, speak more clearly, or revisit the differences between my base knowledge and what I think I am communicating, versus what my audience is receiving. Help yourself stay engaged, and help your professor to engage with you, and stay on camera.\n\n3. Turn off your phone.\n\nThis is a big one. Turn off your phone (or at least silence it), turn off your notifications, and flip it upside down until class is over. Phones are a big distraction generally, and they tend to lead to rapid shifts in attention while simultaneously allowing opportunities to zone out. Buzzfeed has some top ten lists that are more humorous than this, but it won’t help you learn what you need to know for class. Give your phone a break.\n\nAlso, the urge to text, WhatsApp, etc., is another phone no-no that can prevent you from focusing in class. As soon as you send that first message or receive that first message, your attention is partially devoted to awaiting the next message, which makes it hard to stay in the present moment.\n\n4. Do not browse the internet.\n\nThis is another danger zone (cue Top Gun music).\n\nI avoided the urge to Google what year the movie Top Gun came out right then, but that only goes directly to my point. The internet is a lovely place full of a variety of sources of news, information, entertainment, and so much more, but it is also an easy place to mentally meander for hours exploring the history of the movie Top Gun instead of paying attention in class. Resist the urge to go on an endless search for the world’s best strawberry cheesecake recipe (but if you have one, feel free to let me know) and stay in the moment.\n\nI am not oblivious to the fact that sometimes in class something may be said that encourages you to explore information or to search a definition, but I encourage you to wait and stay focused on your class. Instead of diverting your attention during class, do what I recommend in number 5.\n\n5. Make a list and take notes.\n\nIn the modern world, we want what we want, and we want it now. Just ask anyone who has ever delivered Thai food to me at 2:00 a.m. However, pursuing knowledge by searching the internet or frantically flipping through a book can be a huge distraction from what your professor is saying/showing on your screen, so save that for later. Making a list and taking notes can also help you stay on track with your learning, ensuring that you complete assignments (it feels great to check off an accomplishment), and helps you stay accountable to yourself.\n\nNot only does creating a list give you something to do later to ensure you are maximizing your learning, it prevents you from missing out on anything said in the present, and it also keeps you actively engaged after class is over. There will be plenty of time after your class hours to search out terms and explore cases (and you may even find time to track down that strawberry cheesecake recipe), so maximize your engagement in class.\n\n6. Immediately review after class.\n\nThis should be on your list whether you are in-person or virtual, but it is something that students sometimes forget when online. When we are at home or in our own space, it is very easy to immediately click ‘end meeting’ and turn to a streaming service such as Disney+, but ‘What If?’ you didn’t? (That reference to a Disney+ Marvel show was 100% intentional).\n\nInstead of immediately shifting your attention to the next thing on your to-do list, review what you just covered in class, your list, and your notes. You may find gaps in your note-taking, areas that you need to explore or uncover questions for your professor that you can make note of before you forget. Think of it like utilizing someone’s name in a conversation after you meet them – you are much more likely to remember a name if you use it when addressing the person, so make sure to actively engage with your material before you have time to forget (and if you are reading this, I’m sorry Taylor – I’ll remember next time!).\n\n7. Join an accountability group.\n\nJust as you want to maintain focus and review after class as an individual, you also want to have accountability with others to assist you in staying on track (and to assist them as well!). Knowing that you will be meeting with others to discuss cases, black letter laws, bright-line rules, and lecture notes help ensure that you stay on track. Discussing things with others is not only beneficial for your learning, but will help you fill in gaps, find new ways of thinking about things, and ensure that you are focusing on the right things.\n\nWhen it is just you being accountable to you, it is easier to slip up, but when you know others will be counting on you and that you have a role to play in a bigger group it will help you perform better. This is beneficial if you schedule your group meeting on the same day that you have class, and has the bonus of serving as an additional review that will help you retain information in the long term.\n\n8. Noise-canceling headphones.\n\nDistractions are dangerous, and no matter how laser-focused your eyes are, if your ears are tuning into something else, you can rest assured that you are tuning out. I often think of my dog when she thinks someone might be dropping off a pizza at the door, no matter where her eyes are, her ear is up and her head is tilted. It’s hard to maintain focus on one person speaking when you are concerned about pizza delivery, and this carries over to class as well.\n\nIf noises, others talking, or your neighbor’s unrelenting bass (my issue) are a problem, then invest in some noise-canceling headphones. This will help you keep your focus on class, and not on plotting your next angry knock on your neighbor’s door. Listening with focus, combined with active note-taking and list-making, will help you learn and retain information better.\n\n9. Snacks.\n\nEat. It should go without saying, but I often fall victim to the angry grumbling distraction that is my hungry stomach. Sometimes, because we are not following a live, in-person schedule, we do not plan the simple things like remembering to eat meals on a schedule. When you are at home, it is much easier to forget to pay attention to the clock, and you can find yourself struggling to stay focused in class when you know that extra-large pepperoni pizza is in the kitchen waiting for you.\n\nIt is always good to have a handy, non-distracting snack and beverage nearby, just in case. What do I mean by non-distracting? I mean that it shouldn’t be difficult for you to open, runs the risk of spilling all over your shirt, or requires 40 paper towels to maintain clean hands during class. Having something to snack on and something to drink can keep you mentally alert and focused during class, especially when you forget to eat the meal prior.\n\n10. Exercise.\n\nLet me be clear here. I am not suggesting that you attend class from a treadmill or while spinning away on an exercise bike. Instead, what I am recommending is that you remember to step away from your desk. One of the biggest pitfalls of remote learning or working is that you can inadvertently spend too much time in your workspace. You need to remember to take a break from the screen!\n\nThere are also a ton of benefits to exercise, from increasing feel-good neurotransmitters to cardiovascular health, and it also is a great way to relieve stress. If you are someone who has concerns about the virtual learning environment, finding good ways to release stress and relieve anxiety is important, and one of the best ways to do so is to exercise. Even if you just take a walk outside for 15 minutes or walk up a few flights of stairs, you will find plenty of benefits from exercise.\n\nHopefully, you found these ‘Top Ten Tips to Maintain Focus in a Virtual Class Environment’ to be helpful, and I encourage you to explore and develop additional tips to ensure that you make the best of the virtual experience. It is a different environment, but one that you absolutely can thrive in and where you can achieve a high level of learning and success.\n\nDr. Bridgett Ortega Presents at National Association of Drug Court Professionals Conference\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) Associate Dean of Career Services and Professional Development, Dr. Bridgett Ortega, recently presented at multiple sessions at The National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) Conference – RISE21 in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nRISE21 was held August 15-18, 2021 and brought together judges, law enforcement officials, treatment providers, drug and veterans court coordinators, researchers, celebrities, leading authorities on best practices in adult, juvenile, and veterans substance abuse treatment, drug court graduates, veteran treatment court graduates, probation officers, attorneys, consumer advocates, and experts in the treatment court field.

These alumni’s achievements have brought distinction to themselves, credit to the University, and real benefit to their communities.\n\nWhen asked of his recent honor, Professor Rapping reflected, “This award is incredibly meaningful to me because my experience at the University of Chicago helped set me on a path to live out my vision for myself as part of a larger effort to make the world more just. As a Professor at AJMLS I am able to help students define their vision for how they want to serve. Atlanta’s John Marshall did not expect me to leave my previous work to become a law teacher. Instead, it welcomed me bringing that work into my teaching and scholarship to train a student body to carve a career path consistent with our mission to develop the lawyers of tomorrow who will serve those who have historically had the least access to justice. I am honored to be able to live the professional achievement that this award recognizes through my work at AJMLS.”\n\nOutside the classroom, Professor Rapping is the founder and president of Gideon’s Promise, a nonprofit organization with the mission to transform criminal justice by building a movement of public defenders who provide equal justice for marginalized communities. In addition to his full-time teaching at AJMLS, he is also a visiting professor at Harvard University Law School.\n\nProfessor Rapping recently authored Gideon’s Promise: A Public Defender Movement to Transform Criminal Justice (2020), building on an extensive collection of scholarship and informed by his work in the field. In the book, he argues that cultural transformation is critical to realizing justice in America’s criminal legal system and provides a blueprint for achieving that vision. In 2014, Professor Rapping received the prestigious MacArthur Genius Fellowship for his cutting-edge approach to justice transformation. He is the co-host of Gideon’s Promise: The Podcast, along with his wife and Gideon’s Promise co-founder and executive director, Ilham Askia. Professor Rapping’s work was also the inspiration for the award-winning HBO documentary Gideon’s Army.\n\nCongratulations, Professor, it is our honor to support your mission and champion your successes. AJMLS students are afforded the very best criminal justice education from you.\n\nProfessor John Melvin Published by National Institute of Trial Advocacy (NITA)\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) congratulates Adjunct Professor, John Melvin, for his recent publication, Georgia Objections at Trial, Second Edition.

After a multi-floor construction project, designed by Stevens & Wilkinson, the Law School took possession of its pristine new campus on August 6, 2021. AJMLS is now housed on three full floors of One Marquis Tower and comprises almost 60,000 square feet of classroom and office space, including a spacious law library and courtroom. The move from midtown to downtown culminated after months of construction led by general contractor Humphries and Company, who completed the project is less than 24 weeks.\n\nIn connection with its move, the Law School received its largest in-kind donation from the American Cancer Society of premium office furniture. The Atlanta nonprofit donated enough furniture to furnish every office, conference room, and common area in the new facility. The American Cancer Society’s donation represents the second largest donation in the Law School’s history, the first being the donation of all the Law School assets upon its conversion to nonprofit by Dr. Michael C. Markovitz, Chairman of the Board of the Directors and long-time friend. Dr. Markovitz’s generous donation is in-line with his nearly 30-year relationship with the Law School, repeatedly going above and beyond to ensure its success.\n\n“The gift by the American Cancer Society is without a doubt the single most important gift the Law School has ever received,” said Dean and CEO, Jace C. Gatewood. “Without their generosity, this move would not have been financially feasible for the Law School without incurring a large amount of debt.” Gatewood continues, “In the coming weeks, we will find some way to permanently honor their gift and show our gratitude.”\n\n“I speak for the entire Board of the Law School when I say we are completely delighted with Dean Gatewood’s leadership in all matters, and especially as regards the move. Law school staff rose to the challenge of coordinating the complexity of issues that all came together in a successful move on an accelerated schedule. Bravo to everyone involved,” said Chairman, Michael C. Markovitz.\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School is thankful for its generous supporters, growth, and ability to better serve its students, alumni, and legal community.\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School – different on purpose.\n\nProfessor Jaffe Cited in Michigan Supreme Court Concurring Opinion\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) Professor Elizabeth Jaffe’s 2016 article on swatting was cited in the Concurring Opinion in the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision in People v. Pagano, 2021 WL 1570350. In this case, the Defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated with a child as a passenger and having an open container in a motor vehicle. The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss arguing the traffic stop was unlawful. The District Court granted the motion and the Circuit Court affirmed the decision. The State appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the decision. The Defendant appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court and the Court reversed and remanded finding in favor of the Defendant. In the Concurring Opinion, Justice Zahra cited to Professor Jaffe’s 2016 article in footnote 2.\n\nThe footnote is based upon an article written by Professor Jaffe in which she addresses the crime of swatting. The footnote reads “In recent years, individuals have used spoofing technology to make fake 911 calls in order to prank or harass individuals. See Chapter 284, 45 McGeorge L. Rev. at 585; Jaffe, Swatting: The New Cyberbullying Frontier After Elonis v. United States, 64 Drake L. Rev. 455, 456 (2016).”\n\nProfessor Jaffe has been on faculty since 2006. She teaches Domestic Relations, Legal Research, Writing & Analysis I & II, Pretrial Practice & Procedure, and Depositions. She has conducted extensive scholarly research with the focus on education law and the legal response to bullying, and has several published articles in this area. In addition to published articles, she has presented at the Symposium “Cyberbullying in America: A Discussion of Liability, Policy, and Progress” and has received national media coverage for her expertise in this area of law.\n\nThank you for your continued contributions to both AJMLS and the legal community, Professor Jaffe. We appreciate all of your efforts!\n\nAJMLS Alumna, Mandira Sethi, Named First AABS Outstanding Alumni Service Award Recipient\n\nThe Academic Achievement and Bar Success (AABS) Outstanding Alumni Service Award is awarded annually to an outstanding alumnus of Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) for extraordinary service and leadership in supporting graduates as they prepare to take the bar exam. Recipients of this award will have demonstrated a willingness to go above and beyond to assist bar takers on their path to success by dedicating their time, energy, and expertise to their alma mater and recent graduates in extraordinary ways. AJMLS has a favorite saying, “Our students come for law school but find a community,” and recipients of this award will have demonstrated a true commitment to that sense of community by lifting others to new heights.\n\nThe inaugural recipient of this award is Mandira Sethi, AJMLS Class of 2020, currently a Staff Attorney at Barnes & Thornburg LLP. Even though Mandira was very busy working on a wide array of immigrant visas and nonimmigrant petitions during her first year as a practicing attorney after many successful years as a diligent and successful paralegal, she dedicated many hours of her free time to supporting students preparing for the July 2021 bar exam. Not only did she participate in AABS discussion panels, check-in regularly with the Assistant Dean of the Department, and willingly share her experiences, but she also met regularly with students and offered her insights into successful bar preparation and essay writing. Mandira was available to any alumni who reached out, whether she was acquainted with them or not, and her efforts will undoubtedly pay off for all of the bar takers that she worked with.\n\nAJMLS is proud to name Mandira Sethi the first recipient of the AABS Outstanding Alumni Service Award.\n\nProfessor Burch to argue before the Palau Supreme Court, Publishes Book Chapter\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) faculty are diverse in trial, classroom, and scholarship experience, with a strong international presence.

The mock courtroom, the offices, the podiums, and study rooms; we can’t wait to welcome everyone this fall to our new campus!\n\nBar Exam July 2021: Your Best is Yet to Come\n\nWritten by: Scot Goins, Director of Academic Achievement and Bar Success\n\nThe July 2021 bar exam is right around the corner, and this is a stressful time. As the bar exam dates get closer, future examinees tend to put a lot more emphasis and react more strongly to how they performed ‘today.’ The sense of time running out, combined with the elusive (and impossible) search for perfection on practice questions and essays, leads to people suffering as they strive to understand why today they scored x, but yesterday they scored y. Furthermore, this leads to fears about what is going to happen in the future when they might get z score. These concerns are normal in the process, but not realistic as a method of approach and to perform your best.\n\nI attached the graph above to remind you that your best is going to vary daily, and although you have invested plenty of time and effort up to this point, you will still have days that are up and down in terms of your daily scoring. Please remember that your up days shouldn’t lead you to be overconfident, and that your down days shouldn’t destroy your confidence. Instead, I encourage you to simply keep in mind that each day is an opportunity to improve, and fluctuations will occur. These are normal, and one single day will neither make nor break you when it comes to ultimately being successful. Additionally, if you step back and think about it rationally, each day you are encountering different items, specific nuances, varying levels of difficulty, and will have varying levels of mental energy and focus. You are not a machine, and you should not expect bar prep to be an assembly line process where everything looks the same at the end of each day.\n\n“Success is not built on success. It’s built on failure. It’s built on frustration. Sometimes it’s built on catastrophe.”\n\n~Sumner Redstone\n\nRemember that bar exam preparation is not about being perfect and knowing everything. Bar exam preparation is about studying, putting forth the effort, and learning from your mistakes as you progress. In fact, making mistakes and learning from them is part of the path of progress.\n\nWhat many people see as failure on any particular day is not that at all, but rather it is an opportunity to learn a nuance, uncover a misunderstanding, or gain an insight. It is an opportunity to see a literal red X in your bar prep programming now so that you can eventually get the proverbial green light of success notification from the Board of Bar Examiners later. This is a difficult time period, but it is one of opportunities that you have worked towards for years, and now is your time to shine. See each day as an opportunity to gain knowledge and set your sights on success.\n\nI know that you can do this. Strive to learn something new each day and improve, dedicate your time to bar preparation, and treat yourself with kindness. You have been successful your entire life to arrive at this point, and you can continue to be successful moving forward. The bar exam is a difficult challenge, but it is an achievable goal for you to accomplish. You simply have to keep working hard and believing in yourself the way that I believe in you.\n\nYou can pass the bar exam! You’ve got this! Keep working hard and take advantage of each day on your journey to successfully becoming an attorney and receiving that celebratory news letting you know that you passed the bar exam!\n\nKeep working hard and turn your dreams into reality!\n\nJuly 7, 2021\n\nThe team continued to see more progress on the floors and ceilings this week. The classrooms, offices, and common areas are looking great. Construction is still on schedule and we look forward to welcoming students back to campus this fall.\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nThis week’s construction meeting might have shown the greatest progress to date. There is carpet and paint throughout a large portion of the project.\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School Welcomes Linda A.

Bishop of the Pataula Circuit.\n\nAs part of its commitment to supporting Latino law students in their search for the career they want, each year, the GLLF provides connections to the bench through its judicial internship program.\n\nAshley helped us learn a bit more about herself with the interview below.\n\nWhat led you to pursue a career in law?\n\n“I wanted to pursue a career in law in order to be part of this country’s judicial system and try to improve the areas where that system may fail.”\n\nWhy AJMLS?\n\n“I went to Georgia Tech and knew I did not want to leave Atlanta. AJMLS offered me a wonderful scholarship and a chance to pursue my dreams in the city I love. It was a no-brainer!”\n\nWhat does the future look like for you after graduation?\n\n“I hope to land a clerkship with a federal judge after I graduate and have dreams of opening my own general practice firm one day.”\n\nWhat will you be doing this summer with your internship?\n\n“This summer, I am interning for the Honorable Judge Joe C. Bishop of the Pataula Circuit. He is a wonderful mentor. I am excited to learn about all different areas of law, practice my memo and order writing, and experience the courtroom with a Judge’s eyes!”\n\nWho inspires you?\n\n“I am inspired by my family. They have always supported me through tough times and instilled values of community, compassion, and diligence. They are the reason I strive for success today.”\n\nCongratulations again, Ashley, we hope you have a wonderful summer and look forward to seeing you again in the fall.\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nWith a month of construction left to go, the campus is starting to really take shape.

The study rooms are looking great!\n\nLibrary\n\nCampus\n\nMay 2021 Employee of the Month, Scot Goins\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) is pleased to continue its Employee of the Month Program. AJMLS appreciates the efforts of its employees who strive to achieve goals and fulfill the vision of Atlanta’s John Marshall. Outstanding employees deserve to be recognized both as a reward for exceptional performance and as a model to others. The program seeks to recognize hard work and achievement in the workplace and is a peer-to-peer recognition program.\n\nThe May 2021 Employee of the Month recipient is Scot Goins, Director of Academic Achievement and Bar Success.\n\nPrior to joining Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School in September 2020, Scot worked as a Regional Director for Kaplan Bar Review, but his experience ranges from working at a big New York law firm, to teaching business law, and includes building several successful startups from the ground up. He started his career at AJMLS as the Director of the Office of Academic Achievement and Bar Success, where he focuses on student service, utilizing data analytics for programming outcomes, and most importantly, the success of students. He is of the firm belief that the bar exam, like law school, should be a stepping stone on the path to being an impactful attorney, and he strives daily to help students realize their dreams and potential. Scot is also the author of his department’s blog, Law School Brief.\n\nOriginally from Virginia, Scot enjoys mountain biking, hiking with his dog Lucy, and cheering for his undergraduate alma mater, the University of Georgia Bulldogs. He also enjoys spending time with his niece and nephew, Halona and Chayton, as well as traveling the world and exploring different cultures.\n\nScot joined the AJMLS family during the pandemic and has embraced his new position and continues to jump into more involvement, above and beyond what he is required. Scot consistently demonstrates a high degree of excellence, professionalism, and integrity in the performance of his duties and routinely shows a willingness to extend himself to help others at AJMLS. We are very fortunate to have Scot on our team!\n\nJune 9, 2021\n\nEach week, we are blown away by the natural light that fills our new space. All the little details from signage to finishes are being solidified. We look forward to the weekly meetings to see all the progress… and never tire of seeing the grand spiral staircase.\n\nJune 2, 2021\n\nAfter the long holiday weekend, the team was back onsite checking the progress of the new campus. More drywall progress and wall layout are happening.\n\nCongratulations to Our 2021 Graduates and Award Recipients\n\nThe Law School is incredibly proud of its graduates.

The first would be in my 1L year, being cold-called in Professor Van Detta’s Contracts class, to this day, I still remember the terrifying feeling. I remember fumbling through the hypo, but in that moment things changed. That day I gained a mentor for life, what I learned from Professor Van Detta is something I will never be able to fully describe into words. It is a memory I will cherish forever.\n\nMy second would be competing in the Georgia Intrastate Moot Court Competition and becoming Chair of the Moot Court Advocacy. Moot Court is an invaluable experience to all students, it helps us perfect our oral and legal writing skills.\n\nPlans/dreams after the bar exam:\n\nTen years ago, I started my path in immigration law as a paralegal with the goal of helping immigrants, like myself, come to this country and pursue their dreams.

One memory that left an imprint on me was during my first year of law school. I was struggling and finding it hard to adjust to law school. It was my first time answering a question correctly in Professor Van Detta’s contract class. Disclaimer: It can be a little difficult to give a completely correct answer. But this event made me feel like I could make it through law school.\n\nPlans/dreams after the bar:\n\nTake a break, travel, look for a job and continue working on my organization for orphans in Nigeria.\n\nThe Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears Pro Bono Award\n\nThe Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears Pro Bono Award is given to the graduate whose pro bono work has demonstrated outstanding commitment to legal services for underserved communities and their work was impactful.\n\nYvette Hill\n\nUndergraduate institution:\n\nMorgan State University\n\nFavorite AJMLS memory:\n\nI have several invaluable memories at AJMLS, but my favorite is working in the school’s business office as a receptionist.

On one particular emotionally challenging day, Professor Baker sat with me and shared his wisdom about not losing yourself or your perspective during law school. I made it a point from that moment on to remind myself daily of my true purpose and to exercise some grace! Also, the friends I made during my law school career are INVALUABLE.\n\nPlans/dreams after the bar:\n\nAfter the bar, I will be a Staff Attorney with the State Court of Cherokee County.\n\nPro Bono Distinction\n\nThis distinction is given to students who have completed 75 hours or more of pro bono work during their law school career.\n\nYvette Hill\n\nUndergraduate institution:\n\nMorgan State University\n\nFavorite AJMLS memory:\n\nI have several invaluable memories at AJMLS, but my favorite is working in the school’s business office as a receptionist.

AJMLS appreciates the efforts of its employees who strive to achieve goals and fulfill the vision of Atlanta’s John Marshall. Outstanding employees deserve to be recognized both as a reward for exceptional performance and as a model to others. The program seeks to recognize hard work and achievement in the workplace and is a peer-to-peer recognition program.\n\nThe April 2021 Employee of the Month recipient is Hilary Waldo, Assistant Director of Marketing and Communications.\n\nPrior to joining the Law School in February 2012, Hilary worked as an Account Executive at the Atlanta Convention and Visitor’s Bureau, and previously as the Marketing and Events Coordinator at Solutions Bridal. She started her career at the Law School as the Director of Meeting and Conference Services managing the Blackburn Conference Center and miscellaneous Law School events. Having both a marketing and events background, she gravitated towards more marketing-themed projects and transitioned to the Admissions team as the marketing lead in 2013.\n\nOriginally from Florida, Hilary enjoys the sunshine and cheering for her alma mater, the Florida Gators. Outside of AJMLS, she loves spending time with her husband and college sweetheart, Austin (AJMLS ’14), and her kids, Claire (4), and Calvin (2).

She is positive, flexible, always makes herself available, and has strong communication skills. We are very fortunate to have her on our team!\n\nAJMLS 1L, Dr. Shannan Young, Awarded Alan Rumph Memorial Fellowship\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) 1L, Shannan Young, PharmD, MBA, was recently awarded the Alan Rumph Memorial Fellowship for her summer internship with the Georgia Department of Community Health and also the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. The fellowship is awarded annually to commemorate the life of Alan H. Rumph, an exceptional healthcare attorney who served the Georgia Bar Health Law Section and the Georgia Bar in an exemplary fashion as a trusted advisor, friend, and mentor.\n\nYoung is a part-time evening student who earned her Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry from the University of West Georgia, her Masters of Business Administration in Healthcare Management from American Intercontinental University, then her Doctorate of Pharmacy from Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. She also served in the U.S. Army Reserves for eight years as a healthcare sergeant/combat medic. After practicing as a staff pharmacist, then surgical pharmacist in Atlanta, she opened her own pharmacy consulting group, Varxiant Consulting LLC, which she continues to lead as the Chief Pharmacist while attending Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School.\n\nAt AJMLS, Shannan is in the top 5% of her class and on the Dean’s List after her first year of study, was named an Outstanding Student of the Quarter for Fall 2020, and earned a CALI Excellence for the Future Award® for Contracts in her first semester of law school. She is also the Student Bar Association 1L Class Representative, a Diversity and Inclusion Student Committee Member, Barbri Representative, Southern Regional Black Law Student Association Social Action Director, American Bar Association Student Liaison – Substance Use Disorders and Mental Health IG, Gate City Bar Student Member, and Georgia Association of Black Women Attorneys Student Member.\n\nShannan engaged in answering a number of questions for us to help our community get to know her and her journey better.\n\nWhat led you to change careers?\n\n“Most of my career decisions were the result of me responding to a need or a cause that directly impacted someone I cared about, I call it my hero’s journey. My personal trek into unknown territory to retrieve something that my family or I needed. Each new adventure planted the seeds for this next adventure. Additionally, having taken all of the adventures that I have, I have often noticed that the people that make decisions are very far removed from the processes that they control. As a result I feel that it is my duty to speak up having witnessed health inequity and systemic racism not only as a minority, as a woman, as a soldier, as a patient, as a family member of a patient who was mistreated by the healthcare system, as a healthcare provider, and soon as an attorney.”\n\nWhy AJMLS?\n\n“AJMLS offered a flexible program that worked with my schedule as a consultant pharmacist.”\n\nHow do you balance work and law school?\n\nOnce I figure that out, I will let you know. Honestly as hard as law school is, the demand of it is a lot like my life as a multi passionate adult outside of school. I have always had a tendency to take on a lot of things at once and oddly enough I feel like I do best when I am running around like a chicken with its head off. One thing that I can say helps me is that outside of reading my textbook and reviewing my class notes, I listen to the Barbri lectures whenever I am in my car, I think the repetition helps me. Other than that I try to write everything down so I can keep track of all the things I need to do and I constantly tell myself that I can, I will, and I must see this through.\n\nWhat does the future look like for you after graduation?\n\nI don’t know exactly but I am optimistic. My goal is to be at the decision-making table relying on my acquired knowledge, my experiences, and my personal connection to the realities of my community to make meaningful change as it pertains to the health and welfare of minorities and other disenfranchised groups.\n\nWhat will you be doing this summer with your internship?\n\nA little bit of everything! This summer I will be splitting my summer between the Department of Community Health and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. I am primarily hoping to get some insight into policy approaches to address health disparities and the development/implementation of policy at a local and state level. Additionally, I have been asked by two different law firms to assist on independent projects so I am excited about that especially because it will give me some exposure to state and federal litigation.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nI am forever inspired by all the minorities and all the women that have paved the way for me to be able to do everything that I have done and will do in the future. I am also forever inspired by everyone who has been able to turn tragedy into triumph and to overcome adversity.\n\nIt is our pleasure to be a part of Shannan’s journey and we wish her all the best in her internships this summer. We can’t wait to see what she does next!\n\nMay 26, 2021\n\nThe site team made their weekly visit to the construction site.\n\nAJMLS Honors Judge Angela Duncan and Corey Martin as 2021 Distinguished Alumni\n\nOn Saturday, May 22, 2021, Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) presented The Distinguished Alumni Award to two incredible alumni at the 2021 commencement ceremony.

This year’s event, titled “Dreams 2 Reality”, was co-chaired by Darrick McDuffie, senior counsel at Constangy, Brooks, Smith & Prophete LLP, and Dr. Bridgett Ortega.\n\nThe Youth and the Law Summit is an annual event that focuses on providing meaningful and impactful education and support to teens and parents on a variety of life and legal issues. This year, the summit was organized into breakout rooms where parents and teens could attend interactive sessions with top professionals and ask questions in small groups. Each AJMLS volunteer was tasked to assist in each room along with several other administrative tasks that helped the summit be successful and have over 100 participants.\n\nMany organizations helped support this effort and AJMLS is proud to be a part of such a great group. AJMLS stands true to its commitment to the community and looks forward to helping again next year!\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School Welcomes Judge Angela Duncan, Class of 1996, as 2021 Commencement Speaker\n\nAtlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) is pleased to announce Judge Angela Duncan, Class of 1996, as the Law School’s 2021 commencement speaker. Commencement exercises are scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. on May 22, 2021 at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis Atrium Ballroom – 265 Peachtree Center Avenue, Atlanta, GA 30303.

Due to a cancelled event in 2020, this year’s commencement welcomes graduates who finished their degree December 2019 through May 2021.\n\n“I am honored that Judge Duncan accepted our invitation to be this year’s commencement speaker. Her background and rise to the top of the legal profession are emblematic of the quality of legal professional Atlanta’s John Marshall Law strives to create. We are truly proud of her success.”\n\n– Dean Jace C. Gatewood\n\nAbout Judge Angela Duncan\n\nJudge Angela Duncan was appointed the 11th Superior Court Judge for Gwinnett County in 2019. Gwinnett County is Georgia’s second largest county and this position was created by Governor Brian Kemp to assist in the increasing caseload. Duncan was Gwinnett’s first openly gay Superior Court judge as she joins a handful of other officials who are members of the LGBTQ community and hold high profile positions in the county.\n\nJudge Duncan has worked as a Gwinnett County Magistrate Court judge for the past 15 years and was the chief judge for the city of Chamblee’s municipal court at the time of her appointment. She earned her bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from North Georgia College and served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1987 to 1995.\n\nDuncan attended AJMLS part-time attending both day and night classes while also maintaining a full time job. Throughout her study, she sought to experience different areas of law by working at a different firm each year of law school. She learned every aspect of private firms, from working in the file room to becoming a law librarian assistant and court runner. She also experienced many different law practices prior to graduation, from labor law and appellate work to personal injury and criminal defense.\n\nIt was during her third year of study, and work at the former Gambrell and Stolz, that her interest was piqued in serving on the bench. Irwin W. Stolz, Jr., who served on the Georgia Court of Appeals from 1972-1977, was an excellent mentor and teacher during her employment at the firm.\n\nWhen asked what it meant to return to her alma mater in this capacity, she said,\n\n“It is an honor to be asked to come back and be the 2021 Commencement Speaker. Never did I believe as I gave my sweat and tears to the halls of AJMLS that I would receive this honor. It is amazing to see how AJMLS has grown over the years since I have graduated. I am so proud of what the school and its alumni have accomplished over the years.”\n\n– Judge Angela Duncan\n\nTickets are required for entry and the ticket window has closed.

Part Two of this series will discuss another oft overlooked component of bar exam success, “Friends and Family.”\n\nIf you step back and think about your life on any particular day, you will quickly realize that other people and your interactions with them play a big role in your day. Positive interactions can lift you up and inspire, and alternatively, negative interaction can drag you down and demotivate you. It makes sense that if your normal daily life can be positively and negatively impacted by others, if you then add bar exam study and stress into that mix, these interactions will have increased weight. A positive interaction can lift you up when you feel like you cannot possibly watch another video, do another practice question, or read one more outline. On the other hand, a negative interaction can distract you from your work, make you question how you are balancing your life, and lead to feelings of frustration and guilt. It makes sense to think about your relationships early.\n\nObviously, despite the beginning of your bar preparation, you will still interact with other people and be impacted by them. The key to enhancing the positivity and supportive nature of these interactions, while simultaneously minimizing any negativity, frustration, and guilt, is to do some early preparation. By having conversations with your friends and family about your journey and the time requirements of your studies, setting aside time in advance to spend with them, and managing others’ expectations of your time and availability, you can save yourself stress and frustration down the road. Here are three tips to help you be successful on the bar exam by actively managing your relationships in a way that supports your success.\n\n1. Let your friends and family know what you are doing.\n\nThis may sound obvious, but taking the time to communicate with your friends and family about what you will be doing from graduation until you take the bar exam can help you avoid a lot of pitfalls down the road. Although it may seem like everyone should understand that you will be busy studying as you prepare for the challenges of the bar exam, the truth of the matter is that anyone who hasn’t engaged in such a rigorous undertaking may not understand why you need to spend so many hours every single day studying. It may seem instead that you are neglecting them, have poor time management, or that they are just not your priority. If you take the time in advance to discuss what your daily schedule will be like, let them know a timeline, and ask them for their patience before you begin your studies, you will potentially avoid a lot of problems and stress down the road.\n\n2. Make your friends and family a part of your weekly schedule.\n\nGenerally, the importance of time management during bar prep is understood, and ensuring that you have time to watch lectures, review your notes and outlines, engage in practice questions, write essays, and other important things is simply a matter of assigning a time and day to them. This process is important as it helps you stay on the right track to success, but it is equally important to schedule time to spend with friends and family as well. Bar prep is time consuming and intensive, but it should not encompass every hour of every single day. Instead, treat it like a job, and when you are not working, make time to reconnect with friends and spend time with family. This will not only help you maintain positive relationships, but it will help keep you healthy, supported, and balanced as you engage in the rigors of preparing for the bar exam. If you get in the habit of scheduling and valuing others’ time before you start prepping for the bar exam, you will find that it is much easier to continue that habit during your prep.\n\n3. Remember that other people have lives outside of bar prep.\n\nThis is one of those things that makes sense when you stop and think about it, but is not so easy to keep in mind when you are preparing for perhaps the most important test of your life. If you think back to the beginning of law school, you will likely remember a sense of disconnect with those who were not in law school because of how embedded you were in the process of legal education. No one outside of law school understood the perils and fears associated with the Socratic method, why you feared losing a highlighter, or why the letters IRAC made you cringe. The bar exam process is the same while you are in the middle of it for you, but it is also the same for those that are outside looking in at you. Just as they may not understand what you are going through, try to keep in mind that you may not understand what they are going through as someone who supports you and cares about you, and try to be open to communication and also inquiring about things that are not related to bar prep. Not only will it give you a nice break, but it will also help ensure that you stay connected with the people that matter most. Make sure that you actively engage with others before you begin your process, and it will be easier to maintain that communication and stay engaged during your preparation.\n\nThe aforementioned things are important for your mental and emotional well-being, but they will also help you on the exam. One of the most common refrains I hear from bar exam takers is about how lonely the process is, and how cut-off they feel from friends and family. If you actively engage in the aforementioned before (and during) your bar prep, you will find yourself better prepared and better able to handle the stress and rigors of the process.\n\nIn Part Three of this series, we will take a look at how you can “Make Your Commercial Course a Success Before Day One” and discuss a variety of ways that you can ensure you hit the ground running when your commercial course starts.\n\nAJMLS 3L, Yvette Hill, Two-Time Young Litigators Project Champion Coach\n\nThe Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School (AJMLS) Office of Experiential Learning & Pro Bono Programs is proud to announce that Yvette Hill, Class of 2021, "
