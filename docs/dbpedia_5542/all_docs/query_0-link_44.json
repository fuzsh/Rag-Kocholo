        "text": "In a recent conversation with Paper, I found it truly inspiring to hear about the impactful work Superintendent Kirk Shrum and educators in Visalia Unified School District are doing to foster connections that extend beyond the classroom for students. Their dedication to ensuring each student feels a part of something larger within their community is remarkable. üìöü§ù \"What research shows is that when students are connected to something beyond maybe just their academic class, they perform better, they feel better about themselves, and they have better attendance...if every student's connected to something meaningful, it's going to change their trajectory.\" üîó Watch his full interview and explore more insights from leading superintendents at leadership-voices.com.\n\nFor the fifth consecutive year, U.S. News & World Report magazine has named Linfield University the No. 1 liberal arts college in Oregon and one of the best in the nation when it comes to social mobility. In the publication‚Äôs 2024 rankings, Linfield was named No. 52 in the nation on the ‚ÄúTop Performers in Social Mobility‚Äù list, up five spots from 2023‚Äôs No. 57. Linfield moved up in the overall rankings as well. The university rose 12 spots this year, tying at No. 107 in the nation‚Äôs top liberal arts colleges list. In its 39th year, U.S. News & World Report evaluated nearly 1,500 U.S. four-year bachelor‚Äôs degree-granting institutions on 19 measures. The annual ranking added increased emphasis on how often schools‚Äô students from all socioeconomic backgrounds earned degrees and added new data on graduate outcomes. Linfield scored high in the social mobility category, which measures how well universities graduate students who received federal Pell Grants. Students receiving these grants typically come from households whose family incomes are less than $50,000 annually, with most money going to students with total family incomes below $20,000. Of Linfield‚Äôs 1,754 students last year, 28% were Pell Grant eligible. Linfield was also recognized for the third consecutive year among the publication‚Äôs list of ‚ÄúBest Undergraduate Nursing Programs.‚Äù U.S. News & World Report isn‚Äôt the only national publication recognizing Linfield‚Äôs commitment to improving the lives of students. Forbes listed Linfield University among ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Top Colleges‚Äù and one of the top 100 liberal arts universities in the nation earlier in September, and Washington Monthly ranked Linfield No. 9 nationally for earning performance and the No. 1 liberal arts college in Oregon. In addition, College Raptor included Linfield on its 2024 Hidden Gem rankings, recognizing Linfield‚Äôs commitment to retention, graduation and student-to-faculty ratio.\n\nThe ability to regulate time, place, and manner is critical for universities to both facilitate and protect free speech while ensuring the safe continuation of campus operations like classes, final exam periods, etc. From the piece by president Christopher Eisgruber (hat tip to Gadi Dechter for posting): \"The University thus may, and indeed does, limit the times and places where protests can occur. It may, and indeed does, prohibit tactics, such as encampments or the occupation of buildings, that interfere with the scholarly and educational mission of the University or that increase safety risks to members of the University community. \"These time, place, and manner regulations are viewpoint-neutral and content-neutral. They apply to any protest or event, regardless of which side they take or what issues they raise. \"Time, place, and manner regulations are fully consistent with ‚Äî indeed, they are necessary to ‚Äî Princeton‚Äôs commitment to free speech. The purpose of our policy is ‚Äúto promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation,‚Äù not simply to maximize expression in all its forms, no matter how disruptive. \"Dialogue, debate, and deliberation depend upon maintaining a campus that is free from intimidation, obstruction, risks to physical safety, or other impediments to the University‚Äôs scholarship, research, and teaching missions.\"\n\nTania Tetlow, JD - congrats on recognition- continue the successes for Fordham and beyond! ‚ÄúWhat inspired you to pursue a career in education? I love the force multiplier of teaching, the chance to inspire and train generations of students who will go out and change the world. Our teaching creates citizens in the broadest sense. It supports democracy and engagement. It reinforces values and ethics. Higher education becomes one of the gateways of opportunity, the chance to invest in talent the world might otherwise squander. We fuel American global competitiveness. We make meritocracy real. What do you think the future of New York‚Äôs education system looks like? At a moment when COVID set back decades of progress in educational opportunity, we need to redouble our efforts to create meaningful access. From fully supporting public institutions to allowing students to seek out private institutions that will best support them, I hope that New York will continue to stand ahead. Investing in education is a tide that lifts all boats.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/gaMk6G2S\n\nI saw this post, I recalled some of the best commencement speeches that stick with me. My own was given in 1996, when I graduated from management studies at the University of Manitoba, by Dave Angus, then President of The Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. It was about human potential and not setting limiting beliefs. The 1997 hypothetical commencement speech written by Mary Schmich but made famous by @Baz Luhrmann, \"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\", also known as \"The Sunscreen Song. There is some great advice I still dispense today to others, my favourite is \"that some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't know what they want to be in life.\" In 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven's commencement speech at the University of Texas often called the ‚ÄúMake Your Bed‚Äù speech. Start your day by doing one thing successfully, even if that is making your bed. Two recent ones that have caught my mind space; In 2023, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's speech at Northwestern University entitled Would an Idiot Do That caught my attention because of how he spoke about those who deal in cruelty and ignorance. Finally, Reshma Saujani, Founder of Girl's Can Code, delivered the 2023 commencement speech at Smith's College, which is referred to as the Bicycle Face speech. In it, she dispels Imposter Syndrome in the same way that the historically malady Bicycle Face was used to hold women back. For my speech, I would use the theme of Acceptance without Understanding‚Ñ¢. So much in life can be overcome so that we all coexist together, even though we don't understand. It's not about agreeing or tolerating either. Like the famous TED talks, which are not on my bucket list as a speaker, neither is giving a commencement speech. If asked, I would say yes to both! #acceptancewithoutunderstanding #acceptanceforall2050\n\nI was in the first integrated middle school class in Howard County, MD. -- literally 10 years after Brown v. Board of Education. Contrary to popular belief, integration was a gradual and often halting process. You may remember the words in the SCOTUS decision \"with all deliberate speed\". Public school integration gave rise to private so-called Christian schools to stem the tide of racial reconciliation. After middle school, my parents enrolled me in a predominantly Jewish school, where racism was not as keenly evident. Despite the initial progress made in desegregating schools following Brown, we have seen a steady reversal in recent decades, with schools becoming increasingly segregated once again along racial and socioeconomic lines. The data is stark. This resegregation is not a natural or inevitable phenomenon, but rather the result of specific policies and practices, including the dismantling of court-ordered desegregation plans, discriminatory housing policies that reinforce racial divides, disinvestment in federal programs supporting integration, and legal decisions limiting strategies for fostering diversity. As the UCLA Civil Rights Project warns, we are \"betting our educational and social future on inaction\" when decades of research shows the immense benefits of integrated schools for all students. The undoing of Brown's promise and the resegregation of American schools is an ominous development that perpetuates racial and socioeconomic inequalities. It demands urgent attention and concerted efforts from policymakers and society to reverse this damaging trend and uphold the ideal of public education as a great equalizer."
