        "text": "Senator Kirk between Constellation Brands' Paul Hetterich and Democrat alderman Ed Burke\n\nCHICAGO – U.S. Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) was recognized by Constellation Brands Beer Division for his bipartisanship Award during a ceremony Monday.\n\n“I was elected to put the needs of Illinois ahead of partisan politics,” said Senator Kirk. \"Independent, rational voices in the United states Senate must prevail to produce results. The bipartisan coalitions are where cooler heads prevail to move the country forward.\"\n\n\"Cooperation, the ability to find common ground, and compromise are core to effective business and government,\" said Paul Hetterich, President of Constellation Brands Beer Division. \"This is why Constellation is proud to honor U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, who reflects the spirit, the tenacity, and dedication to work in a bipartisan manner for the good of the State of Illinois, and our Country. We appreciate his continued support of the beer industry and those whose livelihoods are supported by the beer industry.\"\n\nConstellation Brands honored Senator Kirk for his consistent efforts to work across the aisle and promote bipartisanship in the Senate, including co-sponsoring the Fair BEER Act, bipartisan legislation which lowers the federal excise tax for brewers.\n\nIn 2015, Senator Kirk was named the third most bipartisan Senator by the Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. Only Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Joe Donnelly of Indiana ranked higher in working across the aisle.\n\nThe Conservative Review gave Senator Kirk an F – a 19% ranking in 2016."
