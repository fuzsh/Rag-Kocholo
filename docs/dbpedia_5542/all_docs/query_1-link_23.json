        "text": "Since 1969, COST has been fulfilling its mission to preserve and promote equitable and nondiscriminatory state and local taxation of multijurisdictional business entities largely due to the unparalleled work and dedication of our staff, fellows and interns. With the support of our members, we are also engaged in developing the future of the field of state and local taxation by way of our long-standing partnership with the Georgetown University Law Center and other area law schools whose select students are regularly offered substantial fellowship, and research positions at COST. Many of these “COST Fellows” have gone on to work at top accounting, consulting, and law firms, and Fortune 500 company tax departments."
