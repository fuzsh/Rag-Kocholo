        "text": "The race for the U.S. Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama is wide open, since appointed incumbent Sen. Roland Burris isn’t running for election this year.\n\nSix Republicans and four Democrats are vying in Tuesday’s primary to be their respective parties’ candidate. (A fifth Democrat, Jacob Meister, announced Sunday that he was dropping out of the race, although his name still will appear on Tuesday’s ballot.) The winners of those contests will join the lone Green Party candidate, LeAlan Jones of Chicago, on the general election ballot in November.\n\nPolls show GOP U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk of Highland Park the frontrunner in his race. The race on the Democratic side is closer, according to pollsters. But the candidates say voters – not polls – will determine the outcome.\n\nOther Republican candidates say Kirk, who voted for “cap-and-trade” anti-pollution legislation (though he says he’d vote against it as a senator) and is pro-choice on abortion, is too moderate.\n\nOn the Democratic side, David Hoffman, in particular, questions whether state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, who is in only his first term as state treasurer, has the experience needed for the Senate post.\n\nThe State Journal-Register asked the contenders in contested primaries to answer some basic questions – why does each believe he or she is the best candidate; what each would do to help the economy; how each would improve health care, and what action should the U.S. take in Afghanistan.\n\nHere are their answers.\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nPatrick Hughes, 41, of Hinsdale\n\nOccupation: Real estate developer\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, Marquette University; law degree, DePaul University.\n\nFamily: Married, three children\n\nWhy best: “I have vast experience with the impact of legislation and regulation on job creators.” Supports “reduced spending and the elimination of earmarks in order to balance our budget,” would reduce taxes and regulation, promote national defense, energy independence, and “the traditional social and family values that have been the fabric of our nation since its inception.”\n\nEconomy: “I would oppose rolling back the Bush tax cuts. … We need to put money back into the pockets of Americans.”\n\nHealth care: “I would work for a health care system that allows purchasing insurance across state lines, the elimination of mandates, and tort reform. I would not support a government-sponsored health plan.”\n\nAfghanistan: Favors the military’s request for more troops in Afghanistan. “Telling them to set up a working democracy without America’s assistance is not an option.”\n\nJohn Arrington, 49, of Harvey\n\nOccupation: Management consultant, former alderman\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, Chicago State University; master’s, Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government\n\nFamily: Married, four children\n\nWhy best: “I am the only conservative candidate who has actually held elected office. As a two-term city councilman in Harvey, I helped reduce taxes levied against our senior citizens and worked as an educational consultant to bring parental authority back to the classroom.”\n\nEconomy: “I expect to bring jobs back to our state by mandating a percentage of all imports be reserved for American companies who deal with those products.”\n\nHealth care: The U.S. needs more preventive care, and he would “emphasize the personal responsibility required from at-risk individuals.” He would also cap malpractice awards and allow people to buy health insurance across state lines.\n\nAfghanistan: “The U.S. must win over Afghan civilians by reducing bystander casualties (and) by emphasizing ground troop deployment rather than risky aerial bombing.”\n\nKathleen Thomas, 61, of Springfield\n\nOccupation: Historical researcher and former college teacher\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, University of Texas; master’s, University of West Florida; doctorate in humanities, Florida State University\n\nFamily: Married, three children\n\nWhy best: “I have actually read the major legislation currently in Congress. … I have the confidence and courage of my convictions and my conservatism. I will not apologize for them or back off from them.”\n\nEconomy: “A business-friendly environment begins with low taxes. … If the U.S. wants to grow its economy, it needs to cut unnecessary red tape and regulation and untie the hands of the private sector.”\n\nHealth care: Reforming medical litigation rules and lifting some mandates from insurance would make health care cheaper. “Legislators need to spend their time investigating and correcting the waste, inefficiencies, mismanagement and fraud that currently exist in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.”\n\nAfghanistan: “We cannot police or bring peace to the entire world, but in this situation, it is worth a try.”\n\nMark Kirk, 50, of Highland Park\n\nOccupation: U.S. representative, commander in U.S. Naval Reserve\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, Cornell University; master’s, London School of Economics; law degree from Georgetown University\n\nFamily: Divorced\n\nWhy best: “We need a senator who can bring reform, integrity and experience to Washington. … As a 20-year Navy Reserve intelligence officer, I served during conflicts with Kosovo, Iraq, Bosnia, Haiti and, most recently, Afghanistan. As a senator, I will fight for lower taxes, less spending and pro-growth policies.”\n\nEconomy: “I will oppose attempts to raise federal taxes for Illinois families or impose crippling regulations on small businesses and family farmers. I will fight to cut wasteful spending and make current tax relief permanent. I will invest in our rails, roads, rivers and airports to boost support to Illinois exporters.”\n\nHealth care: “Adopt the Medical Rights Act, prohibiting the government from interfering with decisions made by you and your doctor; cut waste, fraud and abuse; enact lawsuit reform and expanding electronic medical records; allow Americans to buy cheaper and more flexible health insurance from any state in the union … not raise taxes, add to the deficit or cut Medicare.”\n\nAfghanistan: Supports President Obama’s plan to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. “While gains by our NATO forces and the Afghan government will be very difficult, September 11th reminds us that ignoring Afghanistan will not keep our families safe.”\n\nDon Lowery, 62, of Golconda\n\nOccupation: Retired judge, prosecutor\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s and law degrees, Southern Illinois University\n\nFamily: Married\n\nWhy best: “With 26 years experience as a judge, I understand the importance of legislating national policies that conform with the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nEconomy: “Lower Americans’ tax burdens by downsizing government and stop raising the debt ceiling. Balance the budget, reduce the national debt, and audit the Federal Reserve.” He would limit federal bills to a single subject and require that appropriations bills have sunset clauses.\n\nHealth care: Opposes a public option, would allow purchase of insurance across state lines and would create an “a la carte” plan “that allows people to buy coverage based on their individual needs rather than government mandate.” Backs tort reform. For people with pre-existing conditions or in high-risk health categories, proposes “a plan where each health insurance company insures those people at standard rates, or government pays the difference.”\n\nAfghanistan: “Combat decisions should be made by military commanders in the field, not by politicians in Washington, D.C.”\n\nAndy Martin, 64, of Chicago\n\nOccupation: Self-described “Internet Powerhouse” and perennial candidate under both his current name and his former name, Anthony Robert Martin-Trigona.\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s and law degrees, University of Illinois (but was denied a law license by the Illinois Supreme Court, which found him unfit to practice)\n\nFamily: Asked to name spouse and number of children, if applicable, he responded, “n/a.”\n\nWhy best: “We need a senator who loves the flag and will stand up to defend America.”\n\nEconomy: “Jobs are being sent overseas by greedy Wall Street speculators that buy up successful and profitable American firms, then close their plants, fire their employees and produce inferior products in foreign countries. … We must rebuild Illinois’ economy.”\n\nHealth care: “We can create ‘portability,’ so workers who transfer or lose jobs will not lose insurance. We can address the serious problem of covering pre-existing conditions. We can work to create a nationwide market for insurance. But what we cannot do is nationalize the health care industry.”\n\nAfghanistan: “We must defeat Islamic terrorism. … We must ensure that Afghans, not Americans, start to do the bulk of the fighting to save their nation.”\n\nDEMOCRATS\n\nCheryle Jackson, 45, Chicago\n\nOccupation: On leave as president of Chicago Urban League. Former aide to former Gov. Rod Blagojevich in his first term.\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, Northwestern University; graduate work at University of Memphis.\n\nFamily: Married.\n\nWhy best: “People need a problem-solver who has fought for families. … I have a jobs plan designed to get Illinois working again and propose to shift our national priorities from Wall Street to Main Street, from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to address our economic crisis at home.”\n\nEconomy: “I propose eliminating tax breaks for multinational corporations that send jobs overseas and instead give those breaks to U.S. businesses that create jobs here at home.” She also wants to develop the “green” economy.\n\nHealth Care: “I support a strong public option (and) I insist that health care reform legislation respects women’s right to essential reproductive health care choices.”\n\nAfghanistan: “I am calling for the end to the wars to bring our troops and money home where we need them most.”\n\nAlexi Giannoulias, 33, of Chicago\n\nOccupation: Illinois state treasurer\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, Boston University, law degree from Tulane University.\n\nFamily: Engaged\n\nWhy best: “Now is not the time to go backward to the Bush years, where insiders and special interests wrote economic policies that lined their pockets. … As state treasurer, I’ve demonstrated a commitment to ethical leadership.”\n\nEconomy: His jobs plan “includes provisions aimed at getting people back to work, such as a payroll tax holiday for low-and middle-income workers and a new jobs tax credit for small businesses. I would also extend the college tuition deduction and provide an $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers for an additional year. … I will focus on policies that spur creation of ‘clean energy’ jobs, good-paying positions that can’t be outsourced.”\n\nHealth care: Supports reforms to stop denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions, to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, to cover preventive care and computerize health records, and give consumers the right to compare plans. “The best way to achieve these goals is by offering a non-profit public health insurance option.”\n\nAfghanistan: “I do not believe that there is a purely military path to victory in Afghanistan. We need an integrated approach, which includes refocused civilian efforts and international diplomacy.”\n\nDavid Hoffman, 42, of Chicago\n\nOccupation: Attorney, former inspector general, city of Chicago\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, Yale University; law degree, University of Chicago.\n\nFamily: Married, one son\n\nWhy best: Hoffman cited past jobs as foreign-policy assistant for former U.S. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., law clerk to former Chief Justice William Rehnquist, former federal prosecutor and Chicago inspector general, and member of a state reform commission.\n\nEconomy: “The government must be a catalyst for job creation, using all tools available to it to increase lending to small and medium-sized businesses and get stimulus funds out of Washington much more quickly.” Supports job creation tax credit, investment in public works, and improving workforce skills.\n\nHealth care: “I strongly support comprehensive health care reform,” including a public option. The plan should end barriers to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, cover preventive care, minimize waste and remove the anti-trust exemption for insurance companies.\n\nAfghanistan: “I am skeptical that increasing troop levels above the current level of 68,000 is the right strategy. … History has not been kind to foreign forces occupying portions of Afghanistan.”\n\nDr. Robert Marshall, 66, of Burr Ridge\n\nOccupation: Radiologist (also has run for office as a Republican and a Libertarian)\n\nEducation: Graduate, Harvard Medical School\n\nFamily: Married, four children\n\nWhy best: “On issues such as abortion funding, gay marriage, opposition to tax increases including cap-and-trade legislation, and gun-owner rights, including concealed carry laws, I am much more conservative” than other Democrats.\n\nEconomy: Proposes giving the middle class a permanent income-tax cut. “We should reduce our troops and decrease military expenditures throughout the world.”\n\nHealth care: “We need to stop the practice of denying people health care because of pre-existing illnesses. I am for a public option to decrease premiums for all Americans. … I am also in favor of decreasing the Medicare age to 60. There should also be protection for people filing bankruptcy because of health care costs.”\n\nAfghanistan: “We should withdraw all of our troops from the Mideast, including Iraq and Afghanistan. I would have them all home within one year. The problem of al-Qaida is a police issue.’’\n\nBernard Schoenburg can be reached at 788-1540."
