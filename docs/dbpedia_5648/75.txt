Nestled in an indie cabin escape along California's Russian River, Jennifer Skog captures adventure, style and intimate connection. Bedroom hair and soft smudged makeup by Maria completed the carefree look Jennifer styled for the shoot.

Music & Fashion Photographer Jennifer Skog photographs CATHEDRALS, the indie-electronic pop duo made up of Brodie Jenkins & Johnny Hwin. Taking inspiration from their merging genre's we started with an urban hip hop vibe at Johnny's Sub Mission Art Space. For something a little most haunted and melodic, we played around a historic victorian mansion turned co-op. Our time together was just pure magic. Hair & Makeup by Lindsay Skog.
