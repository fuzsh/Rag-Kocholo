Music & Fashion Photographer Jennifer Skog photographs CATHEDRALS, the indie-electronic pop duo made up of Brodie Jenkins & Johnny Hwin. Taking inspiration from their merging genre we started with an urban hip-hop vibe at Johnny's Sub Mission Art Space. For something a little most haunted and melodic, we played around a historic Victorian mansion turned co-op. Our time together was just pure magic. Hair & Makeup by Lindsay Skog.
