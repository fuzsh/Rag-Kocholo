Texas soundscaper Louk Cox, aka Watercolors, and Netherlands chillhop producer Jack Julian, aka Papi Thereso, meet in this enchanting zen dimension.

“Skog” is a mind-friendly, anti-tension zone imbued with the grounding forest recordings and slowly expanding, efficient, spiritual melodies. The musicians channel all their inspiration from modern classical to drone and ambienty avant-garde. Papi Thereso's fretless bass and keyboard sound bath complement the magia of nature with its quiet and drowsy vibrations. The refined, oriental flute phrases by Watercolors cover “Skog” with a layer of mystical mountain mist.
