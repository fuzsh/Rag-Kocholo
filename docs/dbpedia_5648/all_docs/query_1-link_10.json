        "text": "Norwegian folk-pop duo\n\nKings of Convenience is an indie folk-pop duo from Bergen, Norway, consisting of Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nØye and Bøe were both born in 1975 (Øye on 21 November and Bøe on 25 October) and have known each other since they met in the same class at school. Their first musical collaboration was a comedic rap about a teacher.[2] At sixteen, they played together in the band Skog (\"forest\") with two other friends, releasing one EP, Tom Tids Tale, before breaking up and later forming the Kings duo.\n\nThe duo was signed to the American label Kindercore after appearing in European festivals during the summer of 1999. After a spell living in London in 2001, they released their debut album Quiet Is the New Loud. The album was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson. The album was very successful and even lent its name to a small movement of musicians in the pop underground (including acoustic contemporaries such as Turin Brakes) which took Elliott Smith, Belle & Sebastian and Simon & Garfunkel as their inspiration and focused on more subtle melodies and messages. Kings of Convenience also inspired an indian music duo Parekh & Singh.[3][4]\n\nVersus, an album of remixes of tracks from Quiet Is the New Loud, came out shortly after. After this breakthrough year, not much was heard from the band. Øye spent the next few years living in Berlin and doing solo material, releasing music under the DJ Kicks series as well as a solo album titled Unrest. He also had a side project named The Whitest Boy Alive.\n\nIt was not until 2004 that the Kings' follow-up Riot on an Empty Street was released. The video made for \"I'd Rather Dance With You\", the second single from the album, topped MTV's European list as the best music video of 2004. The album also featured contributions by Feist.\n\nIn January 2008 the band played concerts in the Northern Norwegian cities of Tromsø, Svolvær and Bodø, and Swedish city Umeå along with a concert in August in Stockholm. The band then toured North America, Latin America and Europe, including stops in Boston, New York, Toronto, Detroit; Latin American stops in Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Chile, where they performed in Santiago with local musician Javiera Mena, who later opened for them in Spain and Portugal.[5] European stops include Italy, Switzerland and Spain. On some of their American tour stops they appeared with the band Franklin for Short who joined them on stage for a few rousing numbers.\n\nTheir third album, called Declaration of Dependence, was released on 20 October 2009.\n\nIn June 2012, the band performed at the Primavera Sound festivals in both Barcelona and Porto.\n\nIn 2017, Eirik released an album entitled 'Analog Dance Music' with his other band Kommode.\n\nIn March 2019, Kings of Convenience provided an update regarding their upcoming (fourth) album, stating that \"the songs were written and even performed live, but when we tried to record it during 2016/2017 for a mixture of reasons the results just weren’t good enough[, and] by that time I (Erlend) didn’t have anymore energy to pour into it[, ... so] 2018 was a charging battery year, and now we are planning to try again\".[6]\n\nOn 30 April 2021, Kings of Convenience released a new song, \"Rocky Trail\", after 12 years without publishing music as the duo. They also announced, through their official social network channels, that their fourth studio album, Peace or Love, was released on 18 June 2021 via EMI.[7]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications Title Album details Peak chart positions Certifications NOR\n\n[8] FRA\n\n[9] GER\n\n[10] ITA\n\n[11] NLD\n\n[12] POR\n\n[13] SCO\n\n[14] SWE\n\n[15] UK\n\n[14] US\n\n[16] Quiet Is the New Loud\n\nReleased: 6 March 2001\n\nLabel: Astralwerks\n\nFormats: CD, LP, digital download, streaming\n\n1 103 — — — — 95 — 72 —\n\nIFPI NOR: Gold[17]\n\nBPI: Silver[18]\n\nRiot on an Empty Street\n\nReleased: 21 June 2004\n\nLabel: Astralwerks\n\nFormats: CD, LP, digital download, streaming\n\n2 80 61 3 91 18 50 53 49 —\n\nBPI: Silver[18]\n\nDeclaration of Dependence\n\nReleased: 20 October 2009\n\nLabel: EMI, Virgin\n\nFormats: CD, LP, digital download, streaming\n\n8 71 32 10 57 22 77 53 69 112\n\nFIMI: Gold[19]\n\nPeace or Love\n\nReleased: 18 June 2021\n\nLabel: EMI\n\nFormats: CD, LP, MC, digital download, streaming\n\n4 130 10 60 24 7 9 — 26 — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nRemix albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of remix albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions NOR\n\n[8] UK\n\n[14] UK\n\nIndie\n\n[14] Versus\n\nReleased: 30 October 2001\n\nLabel: Astralwerks\n\nFormats: CD, LP, digital download, streaming\n\n30 135 23\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\nList of EPs, with selected chart positions Title EP details Peak chart positions Track listing NOR\n\n[8] UK\n\n[20] \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles, with selected chart positions, showing year released and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Album NOR\n\nAir\n\n[21] BEL\n\n(FL)\n\n[22] ITA\n\n[23] SCO\n\n[24] UK\n\n[14] UK\n\nIndie\n\n[14] \"Brave New World\" 1999 — — — — — — Non-album single \"Failure\" 2000 — — — 87 63 12 Quiet Is the New Loud \"Toxic Girl\" — — — 48 44 5 \"Winning a Battle, Losing the War\" 2001 — — — 98 78 13 \"Misread\" 2004 — — 15 — 83 — Riot on an Empty Street \"I'd Rather Dance with You\" — — — 65 60 — \"Know How\" (feat.
