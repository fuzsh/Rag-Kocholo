        "text": "Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie present a feast of great music and chat for weekend breakfast\n\nToday they are joined by Eirik Glambek Bøe of Norwegian indie-folk duo Kings Of Convenience. The critically acclaimed band are back with their first new music in a decade. Their new album ‘Peace or Love,’ due out later this month, was recorded over five years in five different cities. The pair met at school in Bergen, Norway and performed together in rock band Skog before forming Kings Of Convenience as a duo in 1999. With singles including ‘Toxic Girl’ and ‘Winning a Battle, Losing the War' and three albums released between 1999 and 2009, their acoustic sound and songwriting gained them a loyal cult following. Eirik chats to Mark and Stuart about their eagerly-awaited fourth album.\n\nAlso on the show… catch up on the best music and entertainment stories of the past week in ‘This Week In Music’.\n\nPlus… regular features 'The Chain' - our world-famous list of over 8000 interconnected songs - and 'Sampled Underfoot' which explores the samples used in some of our favourite tracks.\n\nWith a selection of music old and new to get the weekend started."
