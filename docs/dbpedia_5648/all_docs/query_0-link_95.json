        "text": "Norway’s festival game is strong – regardless of the season. But summertime comes with the added bonus of festival-friendly weather and a never-setting sun. This is particularly true in northern Norway, where the cold weather and lack of sunlight can be quite harsh the rest of the year. So get your festival mood on and head north: we’ve gathered all the events you shouldn’t miss this summer.\n\nRiddu Riđđu Festival\n\nWhere: Gáivuona / Kåfjord municipality in Troms\n\nWhen: July 12-15\n\nIts name means, “little storm on the coast” in Sami. Riddu Riđđu Festival is an international indigenous festival that celebrates Sami culture, taking place every July for 25 years. The diverse program includes everything from concerts, performances and films to workshops and literature. There is a camping ground, so that you can have a more authentic experience of the Sami way of life.\n\nHamsundagene\n\nWhere: Presteid, Hamarøy\n\nWhen: August 1-4\n\nKnut Hamsun is a Nobel Laureate and one of the most important writers of the late 19th century, whose work has influenced writers like Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka and Ernest Hemingway. His legacy is celebrated all year long at the Knut Hamsun center, on the banks of the Glimma River in an area that shaped and inspired the author. But in the summer, something extra special happens: Hamsundagene, a literary festival that includes anything from author meetings, art exhibitions and theater, to ‘adventours’ in the surrounding area.\n\nNordland Musikkfestuke\n\nWhere: Bodø\n\nWhen: August 3-12\n\nNordland Music Festival has been taking place in Bodø, the capital of Nordland county, since 1980. The festival week, which is held in various indoor and outdoor venues all around the city, celebrates the best of classical music – but also features other music genres such as jazz and folk.\n\nViking Festival\n\nWhere: Bøstad, Vestvågøya, Lofoten\n\nWhen: August 8-12\n\nLofotr Museum is a must stop any time of the year, if you’re interested in retracing the steps of Vikings. At the excavation area, you will find the largest Viking house ever uncovered – as well as reconstructed areas that will make you feel you’re starring in a Vikings episode. Every August, they host a Viking festival with era-appropriate activities such as Viking ship sailing, fighting games, a market and much more.\n\nSee privacy policy.\n\nVerket Music Festival\n\nWhere: Mo I Rana, Nordland\n\nWhen: August 24-25\n\nThis outdoor music festival is on its tenth year, and the idyllic surroundings is just one of the reasons people keep coming back, year after year. With international names such as Travis on its lineup, seems like 2018 will be one of the best years yet.\n\nArctic Sea Kayak Race\n\nWhere: Bø and Skipnes, Vesterålen, Lofoten\n\nWhen: July 22-28\n\nStarting from Fjordcamp Kråkberget in Bø in Vesterålen, Arctic Sea Kayak Race will have you exploring the area by sea and spending time at the fishing village of Skipnes in Lofoten. Also dubbed “the world’s most beautiful kayak festival”, ASKR involves activities for all levels of experience – so if you’re a beginner when it comes to kayaking, you can still go and have fun.\n\nBuktafestivalen\n\nWhere: Tromsø\n\nWhen: July 19-21\n\nWith the motto “rock, beer & seafood in the Arctic”, you know you’ll have a good time at Bukta. This annual rock festival, which has taken place in Tromsø for the last fifteen years, explores all the different facets of rock music (from indie to metal), both Norwegian and global. On this year’s lineup, you’ll find iconic artists like Sivert Høyem."
