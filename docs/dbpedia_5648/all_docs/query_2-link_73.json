        "text": "[Note to the reader: This text was originally published in the now out-of-print book ”Studio Talks: Thinking Through Painting” published in 2014.]\n\nIn this text Jan Rydén [Bonmot] explores how to find a useful way of talking about painting’s medium specificity without being normative or limiting, and how that medium-specificity explains painting’s remarkable perseverence in contemporary art. He puts forward the idea that painting should be regarded as a field, or a nebulous entity with a strong nucleus and very diffuse boundaries. However, to pinpoint an essence might be impossible. The exact centre of gravity, the core of the matter, could well hover in the empty space between the different central parts. There are resemblances to Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Family resemblance theory. These are discussed in the text, as well as the theories of embodied cognition (George Lakoff) , prototype theory (Eleanor Rosch ) and affordances (James J. Gibson) in conjunction to painting.\n\nYou find the text below as a downloadable PDF and as a blog post.\n\nOverture\n\nIf you are a painter, why bother with contemporary painting\n\ntheory? It will in itself not make you paint better paintings. This can\n\nonly be achieved by the doing: honing your skills again and again. But\n\ncontemporary painting theory might have other advantages. It could\n\nmake it easier to discuss painting with your fellow painters. Like all\n\nnerds, many painters take pleasure in delving in to the minute subtleties\n\nof their medium. It might also make it easier to talk about your work\n\nwith the outside world, the non-painters.\n\n* * *\n\nAbove all, I see an advantage with the practice and theory of painting\n\nbeing discussed, re-defined and re-distributed, among painters themselves.\n\nThis will free them of the burden of having to react to theories\n\ncoming from the outside, or as it might feel, from above. Choosing not\n\nto discuss painting’s role in contemporary art is also an active choice.\n\nYou run the risk of somebody else formulating the question, for lack of a\n\nbetter word, that good art is supposed to answer.\n\nI think few painters originally have discourse-driven practices. The\n\nlove of paint and painting most often comes before the words. But the\n\nreception and evaluation of what we do can be discourse-driven. And\n\nthoughts, ideas and concepts are of course of great importance to\n\nmany painters’ practices, and these ideas and concepts live in a discursive\n\necology.\n\nHowever interesting I might ind it to discuss why one paints, there\n\nis a type of normative statement that has always irritated me a lot.\n\nSomeone might write: ‘after that article, argument, artwork, it was impossible\n\nto continue painting… ’. These types of statements are all about\n\nmistaking the map for the terrain. Of course, it was, and is, and will\n\nalways be possible to paint. The theory of painting might run into different\n\ndead ends, but the practice of painting remains remarkably vital\n\nover time, and if anything the number of painters in the world keep\n\nincreasing especially with the continuous addition of new art schools\n\naround the globe.\n\nWhat they are actually saying is something along the lines of: ‘according\n\nto our theory of what makes painting important, it would seem\n\nimpossible, or at least completely unnecessary to make any more paintings\n\nafter that article, argument, artwork’. In such a situation, is it the\n\ntheories of painting that need to change, or the practice of painting?\n\nIn the case of painting, for some reason, normative statements on\n\npainting often refer to Clement Greenberg. At least the reasoning starts\n\nwith Clement Greenberg, if only to emphatically refute his ideas on the\n\nessence of painting. As if he were the year zero in painting theory. He\n\npublished his infamous essay Modernist painting in 1960. For the sake of\n\nargument, or a good debate, these discussions are often reduced to an\n\neither-or position. As André Rottman notes in his text Remarks on\n\nContemporary Painting’s Perseverance:\n\n“For the longest time, the theory and practice of painting has been\n\norganized, contained and propelled by a series of closely related antagonisms\n\n– colour and contour, transparency and opacity, gesture and\n\nfacture, illusion and latness, semblance and objecthood, chroma and\n\ncontrast, chance and composition, mark making and the monochrome,\n\nostentatious virtuosity and anonymous execution, figuration and abstraction\n\n– to name just a few.”1\n\n* * *\n\nA similar antagonism is whether painting is medium-specific or not,\n\nan idea that seems closely related to Greenberg’s essentialist view on\n\npainting. Without hesitation, I would argue that the notion of painting\n\nbeing medium specific has been thoroughly discredited amongst art\n\ntheorists. Most critics and writers would not fail to mention Rosalind\n\nKrauss’ text Sculpture in the expanded ield and the reasoning about other\n\nart genres, painting included, which follow. Painting is also thought to\n\nfunction in an expanded ield. Other texts that argue along the same\n\nlines, only to mention a few recent ones, are Painting beside itself by David\n\nJoselit, and our namesake Thinking Through Painting: Agency and Relexivity\n\nbeyond the Canvas by Isabelle Graw.\n\nClement Greenberg’s aesthetic understanding of art and especially\n\npainting has come to represent Modernism with a capital M, even\n\nthough in reality there were many contradictory isms within modernism:\n\ndada, surrealism, futurism, to name only a few. It seems that\n\nGreenberg its nicely as a perfect monolithic counterpart to post-modernism.\n\nGreenberg claimed that an artwork could be qualitatively good\n\nonly if it was autonomous, which was achieved by remaining true to\n\nits medium, i.e. being medium specific. However, Clement Greenberg’s\n\ndefinition of medium specificity is rather particular. He maintains\n\nthat within the Modernist project artists created artworks that were\n\nmore and more ‘about’ their own medium, one by one excluding traits\n\nfrom the other arts. Painters emphasized latness, excluding perspective\n\n(the domain of sculpture) and narrative (literature). This process also\n\nshowed that these elements were not essential to painting.3 By excluding\n\nnarration, figuration and perspective, you ended up with abstract\n\npainting.\n\nCritique of Greenberg has had two main ingredients. Firstly, the\n\naesthetic definition of art was considered having come to an end and\n\nno longer being useful to understand the art of the time: e.g. minimalism,\n\nhappenings or conceptual pieces. Secondly, the aesthetic notion\n\nof art was a part of a bourgeois ideology that many artists and theorists\n\nwanted to question or attack. Conceptual art was among other things\n\na way to counteract the commodiication of art. By taking away the\n\nmaterial basis of an art piece, there was no object to sell. In some sense\n\npost-modernism and conceptual art was also a direct extension of the\n\nmodernist idea of the avant-garde. To take art even further you had to\n\ncritique the institution of art itself. In the post-modernist context being\n\navant-garde equals performing institutional critique, whereas Greenberg’s\n\nconception of avant-garde is linked to the idea of developing art,\n\nin this case painting, within the limits of its medium. In his view, any\n\npolitical power is rather a side effect of aesthetic innovation.\n\nToday nobody would be caught dead saying the art of our time is\n\npost-modern, however multiple the art scene might be. Instead, the\n\ndiscourse has morphed into an even more vague notion: contemporary\n\nart. The foundation of this notion is still very much based in the\n\npost-Greenbergian shift to conceptualism in the late sixties. The value\n\nof painting is still not considered to be linked to the actual medium.\n\n“However, painting has long since left its ancestral home – that is, the\n\npicture on the canvas – and is now omnipresent, as it were, and at work\n\nin other art forms as well”.\n\nIf painting is omnipresent, everywhere, thus everything, is it\n\nanything in particular? Clearly, this type of reasoning; that you cannot\n\ndefine painting because its boundaries are diffuse, is untenable. At the\n\ntime, the post-modernist theorists argued that Greenberg’s notion of\n\nmedium specificity wasn’t useful as a way to understand contemporary\n\npainting. Today one could argue that the post-modernist/conceptual/\n\ncontemporary art stance isn’t that useful to explain contemporary painting’s\n\ncontinuous allure and perseverance within the world of contemporary\n\nart.\n\nTo me as a painter the crux is the idea that painting shouldn’t be\n\nthought of as medium specific has never rung quite true. I can follow\n\nthe reasoning in the essays mentioned above, but my experience\n\nfrom my own physical reality tells another story. Especially, it tells me\n\nanother story of why painting as a practice continues to exist, and why\n\npaintings continue to enthral us as viewers. In this case the medium is\n\ncertainly a large part of the message.\n\n* * *\n\nDefining without defining\n\nIt is pretty obvious that in the way we use the word painting\n\nevery day, it is medium specific. Of course, it is a tautology, since it is\n\nthe name of a medium. What we seem to need is a useful way of talking\n\nabout medium specificity that is neither normative nor limiting\n\nand to avoid the cul-de-sac of Clement Greenberg, as well as some of\n\nthe more Orwellian versions of post-modernism. What annoys me with\n\nthe existing discussion is irst and foremost the disciplinarian ring that\n\nstatements based in Aristotelian definitions tend to have: if and only if\n\nyou accept that all Brillo Boxes are also paintings can we accept your\n\nargument… Secondly, I am also annoyed by some of the nonsensical\n\nand counter-intuitive conclusions this rigid reasoning leads to.\n\nIn the publication with the same name as our project Isabelle Graw\n\nraises two interesting questions: “How do we explain painting’s remarkable\n\nperseverance in the expanding ield of contemporary art? […]\n\nHow to determine a practice that renders impossible the rigorous distinction\n\nbetween what is intrinsic and what is extrinsic to it?”5 Both\n\nquestions are interesting, but we come up with quite different answers.\n\nI will offer her answers, and elaborate a bit on my reasons for coming\n\nto a different conclusion. The last question of how to define painting\n\nis dependent on the view that one cannot rigorously distinguish what is\n\nintrinsic to painting, and what is extrinsic to it. Painting, she says, is\n\nomnipresent and at work in other art forms as well. But, is it anything\n\nin particular? I think it is. So does Graw, intuitively I guess, but she\n\nhas to go out of her way to ind a definition that is acceptable. Graw’s\n\nsolution to the problem is to propose “that we conceive of painting not\n\nas a medium, but as a production of signs that is perceived as highly\n\npersonalized.\n\nPainting is indeed a nebulous ield, a practice that in every direction\n\nvanishes into the hazy distance and blends into all surrounding ields of\n\nvisual communication. My point is that expanding a notion or making\n\nits boundaries diffuse doesn’t necessarily make its core any less dense.\n\nLets play with the analogy that the idea of painting is some kind of\n\nluffy, permeable entity with a strong nucleus. It is whatever is in the\n\nnucleus that exerts the strongest gravitational pull on us. Not the luffy\n\nstuff on the rim.\n\nDefining literally means to ‘show the limits of something’, the\n\nextent, the outline, where something ends, to follow it al ine. The avantgarde\n\nhas often looked for the limits of a scientiic or artistic ield.\n\nTongue in cheek one would be tempted to say that this way of defining\n\nthe ield of art or the ield of painting has ‘reached its limits’. What I\n\nsuggest is to look the other way, instead of looking for the outer limits\n\nsearch for the inner nucleus.\n\nI came up with an idea of a sort of connected or webbed thinking as\n\nan image. I drew something like a mind map, but where the exact centre\n\nof gravity, the core of the matter could hover in the empty space between\n\nthe different central parts. It is a visual way of defining something. In\n\nthis case, I wanted to define painting, but in a new way: inside out,\n\nrather than the other way around. I was also looking for a way to say\n\nsomething meaningful about a concept, or a genre, without being normative.\n\nThere would be no definite right or wrong, there would be a\n\ncentre, there would be more central and less central, but no rigorous distinction;\n\nintrinsic or extrinsic.\n\nThere seem to be certain recurrent qualities that keep painting interesting\n\nin an age when it had been discredited over and over again.\n\nIn and by themselves none of these would do as definitions of painting\n\nas a genre, or as a full-blooded explanation of painting’s essence, in the\n\nGreenbergian sense, but they nevertheless seemed closely related to our\n\ncommon fascination for painting.\n\nI had been toying around with this idea for quite a while and decided\n\nto put it into words. At that time, I stumbled upon an article about an\n\nexhibition of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s photos and realized that he had\n\nput forth a very similar idea with the notion of family resemblances, apparently\n\ncrucial to his later philosophy.7 Wittgenstein suggested that we\n\nunderstand words\n\n“…like members of the same family, they might have a series of similarities\n\nand dissimilarities that overlap and criss-cross in various complicated\n\nways. Some Wittgensteins (such as Ludwig and his sisters) might\n\nhave the same nose, the same mouth, the same eyes but, say, different\n\nforeheads. There need not be one thing that all members of the family\n\nhave in common.\n\n* * *\n\nThe exhibition contained a composite photograph made up of four\n\nportraits of Wittgenstein and his three sisters, enabling the viewer to see\n\ntheir strong family resemblance. However, Wittgenstein’s most famous\n\nexample is games. He tries different features that could be common\n\nto all practices we call games: winning and losing, amusing, competition, skill\n\nand luck. But he dismisses them one by one since they are true to some\n\ngames but not to other games. Similarities crop up and disappear.\n\nInstead he sees a “complicated network of similarities overlapping and\n\ncriss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of\n\ndetail”. Interestingly Wittgenstein encourages us to “look, not think”.9\n\nWhat he says is that even though it is impossible to define games in the\n\nconventional way, we don’t need such a strict definition. We already use\n\nthe word successfully. The same would of course be true for a concept\n\nsuch as painting. For every individual painting a list of features or qualities\n\nwould of course differ slightly. A tentative list of painting’s family\n\nresemblances could look something like this: colour, pigment, binding\n\nmedium, surface, form, image, texture, body of paint, perspective, concept,\n\ncontent etc. Wittgenstein’s family resemblances were introduced\n\nto the discussion of art by Morris Weitz’s claim that art should be considered\n\nan open concept.\n\nThe argument goes that art cannot be defined\n\nin a conventional manner, because there is always the possibility that a\n\nnew entity will appear on the art scene. There is no one common property\n\nto all art, only strands of similarities. An act of judgement will be\n\nneeded to decide if this new entity has enough similarities with what we\n\ncall art to be included in the family of art.\n\nAn idea that is similar to Wittgenstein’s family resemblance and\n\nmy metaphor of the gravitational ield is Eleanor Rosch’s prototype theory,\n\nequally applicable to our discussion. Instead of using a model based\n\non definition, (necessary and suficient conditions), Rosch claimed that\n\neach category consisted of elements of differing status. This led her to a\n\ngraded notion of categories; in the category bird, a robin would be more\n\ncentral than for example a penguin. A traditional definition might\n\nhave gone along the lines of a bird fulilling the conditions of having\n\nwings, a beak, feathers and the ability to fly.\n\nIn our discussion, painting could be seen as a prototype. Colours\n\ncould also be seen as prototypes. Coming from a professional background\n\nas an editor and writer before going to art school, the relation\n\nbetween words and colour has always held a special tension to me. If\n\nwe substitute the questions, ‘What is art?’ or ‘What is painting?’ with\n\nthe question ‘What is red?’ we would be able to make a number of observations.\n\nFirst of all, red is just as abstract an idea as art or painting.\n\nWe would be hard pressed to suggest the exact point where red ends\n\nand orange begins. We would define, or name, certain colours as red\n\nor orange depending on what we compare them with. Pure spectral\n\ncolours form a continuous spectrum. Another take on the relation\n\nbetween colour and language would be Isaac Newton’s. By using a\n\nprism, he showed it was possible to disperse seemingly colourless light\n\ninto separate colours. He originally divided the rainbow into ive colours:\n\nred, yellow, green, blue and violet. He later added orange and\n\nindigo to make the number of colours seven, out of a belief that there\n\nwas a connection between the number of colours and the number of\n\nmusical notes. Today, scientists do not see more than six main colours.\n\nOrange is still there, but indigo has vanished from the rainbow. Or is\n\nit cyan? Apparently, in Newton’s day blue was closer to what we today\n\nmight call cyan. It has been suggested that what we define as blue today\n\nwas then seen as two colours: blue and indigo. It certainly has a poetic\n\nring to it that the blues we see in the sky have drifted and shifted through\n\nthe centuries. The rainbow isn’t the same these days. Or is it?\n\nIf we transfer this reasoning to painting, we would be hard pressed to\n\ndraw a line where painting ends. Individual works of art would be possible\n\nto define as belonging to painting or not, depending on; on the one\n\nhand what we compare them to, on the other hand our everyday use of\n\nlanguage, in Newton’s case the word blue, in this case the word painting.\n\n* * *\n\nAn endnote: Painting as embodied cognition\n\nSo, if i were to return to the question of why painting has such\n\nremarkable allure and perseverance within the world of contemporary\n\nart I would not end up outside the canvas or painted surface, I would\n\nend up in the actual body of paint itself. I believe paintings get a lot\n\nof their magic from the fact that we go back and forth between seeing\n\nthem as images, windows into another world, and as objects and surfaces\n\nwith a bodily, leshy presence in the room. Like Wittgenstein’s famous\n\nand ambiguous image of the duck-rabbit. We licker between the\n\ndifferent aspects not only of the image, but also between the painting\n\nas body or as pure content.\n\nThe reason that this attracts us might be that painting is closely\n\nrelated to how we think: in metaphors and images that arise from our\n\nbodily experiences. Cartesian dualism has given western thought two\n\nbasic ideas: reason is disembodied because the mind is disembodied\n\nand reason is transcendent and universal. As if by chance, if we look for\n\nan alternative to this idea we again ind ourselves among Eleanor Rosch\n\nand her colleagues. Her graded notion of categories is central to many\n\nmodels of cognitive science and cognitive semantics, most famously in\n\nthe work of George Lakoff. As a proponent of the idea of embodied cognition\n\nhe has shown that not only is the mind connected to the body, but\n\nthat the mind arises from the nature of our brains, bodies and bodily\n\nexperiences.\n\nTo understand reason we must understand our visual system\n\nand our sensorimotor system. Sensory inputs and motor outputs,\n\nmovement, gesture, are integral to cognitive processes. This also entails\n\nthat reason itself isn’t passionless and conscious but emotional, embodied\n\nand mostly unconscious.\n\nSemantics arise from the nature of the\n\nbody. If reason isn’t based on abstract laws, because cognition is grounded\n\nin bodily experience, this puts a new twist to the relation between\n\nlanguage and painting, and why paintings seem so meaningful to us.\n\nIf we do not have a faculty of reason that is separate from our faculties\n\nof perception and bodily movement, the split between perception and\n\nconception is less clear.\n\nA painting, or any other external representation, provides affordances\n\nthat internal representations, and concepts lack. Affordance is a term\n\ncoined by psychologist James J. Gibson. He defined it as ‘action possibilities’\n\nlatent in a specific object, in our case a painting, and our in the\n\nenvironment. Affordances are measurable and independent of an individual’s\n\nability to recognize them, but always in relation to an agent’s\n\ncapabilities. A typical example would be a child’s reaction to a light of\n\nstairs versus an adult’s. An extended notion of perceived affordances also\n\nincludes an agent’s goals, plans, values, beliefs, and past experiences.\n\nThis idea of affordances provided by external representations seems related\n\nto Wittgenstein’s emphasis on seeing. A core feature of Wittgenstein’s\n\nphilosophy is what he calls the understanding, which consists in seeing\n\nconnections. And seeing is not meant metaphorically, but literally.17\n\nExternal representations help us think thoughts we couldn’t come\n\nup with by pure thinking. I believe that is what Wittgenstein meant\n\nby telling us not to think but to look. Any kind of external representation\n\nof an idea, such as a teapot, would of course provide affordances.\n\nHowever, since our internal representations are images and metaphors,\n\nimages form a very special category of external representation.\n\nThe typical approach in cognition literature is that an agent is confronted\n\nwith a pre-existing environment or an object, which provides\n\nthe affordances. For me as a painter in the act of painting, the notion of\n\naffordances would be different. At the same time as the painter places\n\nanother brushstroke on the painting’s surface he or she does two things:\n\ncreates an external representation of an internal one, and also creates\n\nnew affordances to be recognized, laying down new latent ‘action possibilities’.\n\nIt’s like a dance with two partners taking turns leading. By\n\nobserving the changes in the painting, new possibilities arise. We can\n\nsee anew.\n\nJan Rydén is an artist who lives and works in Stockholm .
