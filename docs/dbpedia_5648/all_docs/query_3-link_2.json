        "text": "Musical artist\n\nIrving Force (real name Adam Skog)[1] is a synthwave producer from Stockholm, Sweden. He previously was a member of the black metal bands Vanh√§vd and Vapenlicens, before becoming interested in 80's-influenced film scores.[1][2]\n\nWorks and style\n\n[edit]\n\nIrving Force's musical and aesthetic style is influenced by 1980's action films and characters, such as John Carpenter films and his character Snake Plissken.[3] Skog originally intended Irving Force to have a more pop oriented sound, but the music soon took on elements from his heavy metal past.[2][4]\n\nHe also cites cyberpunk science fiction from all types of media and the band Tangerine Dream as further influences.[2] Having come from a film-score background, much of Irving Force's music is designed to have some sort of narrative or story element - such as his 2015 release The Violence Suppressor.[5] A video was filmed for the title track on that album, which was made to invoke classic sci-fi and action movies like Assault on Precinct 13 and Judge Dredd.[2] Following releases were set out to take place in a loose thematic universe.[6]\n\nIn April 2020, Irving Force provided the soundtrack for the Android retro point & click adventure game Awaken Alone.[7][8] His music has been described by reviewers as \"guiding the listener through cyberpunk narratives that twist and mutate with a musical playfulness\".[2] Others have praised its \"next level grooves\" and \"balls to the wall rhythms\".[5][4]"
