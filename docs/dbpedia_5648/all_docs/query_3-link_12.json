It was founded in 1997 by Mathias Nygard and Jussi Wickstrom and named after an ancient Finnish God of War.\n\nTurisas is a Folk Metal band, incorporating elements of Power, with some influences taken from Symphonic Metal and most recently Death Metal. Turisas is known to play all of their solos on electric violin, as opposed to traditional guitar solos. The album title Battle Metal has given rise to the term \"battle metal\" being used as a description of Turisas' genre (used mainly by Metal Hammer magazine and its readers) but it is not yet recognised as a canonical metal subgenre.\n\nCurrent and Past Members[]\n\nCurrent: []\n\nMathias \"Warlord\" Nygard - Lead Vocals (1997 - Present)\n\nJussi Wickstrom - Guitar (1997 - Present)\n\nJukka-Pekka Miettinen - Bass Guitar (2011 - Present)\n\nTuomas \"Tude\" Lehtonen - Drums (1997 - Present)\n\nOlli Vanska - Violin (2007 - Present)\n\nRobert Engstrand - Keyboard (2011 - Present)\n\nPast Members: []\n\nAri Karkkainen - Guitar (1997 - 1999)\n\nGeorg Laakso - Guitar (1999 - 2006)\n\nMikko Tormikoski - Bass Guitar (1997 - 2004)\n\nTino Ahola - Bass Guitar (2005 - 2006)\n\nSami Aarnio - Bass Guitar (2006 - 2007)\n\nHannes \"Hanu\" Horma - Bass Guitar (2007 - 2011)\n\nAntti Ventola - Keyboard (1997 - 2007)\n\nJanne Makinen - Accordion (2007 - 2008)\n\nRiku Ylitalo - Accordion (2008)\n\nWincef Boncamper - Accordion (2008)\n\nNetta Skog - Accordion (2008 - 2011)\n\nReleases[]\n\nCD: (Albums)\n\nBattle Metal - 2004\n\nThe Varangian Way - 2007\n\nStand Up and Fight - 2011\n\nCD: (Demo's)\n\nTaiston Tie--The Battle Path - 1998\n\nUnnamed Promo - 1999\n\nThe Heart of Turisas - 2001\n\nVideo's:"
