        "text": "This was done at WDVX's Lunch Time Show called the Blue Plate Special. WDVX's studio is in downtown Knoxville.\n\nFirst time I heard the CCD was on DVX, and the more I hear them, the more I like them. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the emo pseudo-'Americana' crap they play in the afternoons, so we've started listening to AM850, WKVL at the shop.\n\nI love the Bluegrass show DVX plays in the morning. I wish they played more of it thru-out the day.\n\nSeeker, glad to help a brother out.\n\nCheck out Gogol Bordello for some gypsie punk. Think of it as an eastern European version of Drop Kick Murphy's\n\nThose guys are awesome. I have a CD of theirs floating around somewhere and like a listen occasionally.\n\nHere are a few I like\n\nChad K. Slagle Longbow Country\n\n(He also sings other great songs like High, Wild, and Free)\n\nYouTube - ‪bush hookin‬&rlm;\n\nKeep your lamp trimmed and burning (One of my favorites)\n\nYouTube - ‪Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning‬&rlm;\n\nblue side of the mountain\n\nYouTube - ‪The SteelDrivers - Blue Side of the Mountain‬&rlm;\n\n\"Way out west there was this fella, fella I wanna tell ya about. Fella by the name'a Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him...\"\n\nWhen I'm going on a trip or going to go camping, I listen to Americana music. Bob Dylan, CCR, John Prine, The Boss, Willie Nelson, Woody Guthrie. I was raised on Bluegrass so the sound of a banjo gettin' it will always get my blood pumping. And yea, I dig metal too. But that's for other environs.\n\nI'm seriously going to go watch the dude though. Once that song started to play... Thanks Stove.\n\nNo problemo Arctictough....watch out for Jackie Treehorn and the nihilists out there in los angle'eze......time for a white russian.\n\nWe used to have a thread for current favorite songs, sort of a \"what are you listening to\" thread but I don't know where it went. Probably shuffled off into the off topic section. Vamos!\n\nPMZ\n\nI've got a few instruments that are specifically suited for camping, canoeing or motorcycle trips. Ukulele, guitar, flute, ocarina and harmonica. I'll play out my repertoire in about 1 hour, that's the non- G, C, D stuff. I agree with the Willie Nelson and add in some Hoagy Carmichael and Billy Joe Shaver. One or two show tunes, a Tiny Tim number, asked to be played so many times when I pull out the ukulele, I learned it in it's original form to show that Tiny may have been a clown but the tune itself is a great example of turn of the century melody driven progressions, not that I'm teaching anybody anything sitting around a camp fire in the middle of no where, man \"o)\n\nDon't usually listen to music out side as I'm no musician. When I do it's mostly traditional Irish folk music ie the Clancy brothers nd Tommy makem. Love floggin Molly and the dropkick murphys as well. Blame the melancholy scotch Irish heritage if u must, but croppy boy and odonnel aboo are two of my favorites.\n\nThe French Canadian side loves to tell stories for some reason. Stories from history and my mind.\n\nAs to theme music in my mind. When I'm woods walking alone for some reason the theme from the great escape is pingin around in there.\n\nI'm loving this thread!\n\nMy personal taste in music runs the gamut of just about everything: Loreena McKinnet to Rob Zombie; metal, country, etc.... I really enjoy a lot of the 'unknown' genres, like gypsie punk! That''s just too cool. Pirate rock is a hoot too...just so much fun stuff!\n\nSomeone posted something that reminded me of these guys: Sons of the San Joaquin. A real old-school cowboy music group made up of a family of ranchers.\n\nThe Sons of the San Joaquin - YouTube\n\nNot much for blue grass but I do enjoy a bit of folk music, especially Irish folk. My favorite is a combination of genera that is folk metal! Finnish folk metal is definitely the most bushcrafty as well as satisfying my need for metal Finntroll and Korpiklaani are my favorites. Yoik? Metal? Both? I think so!\n\nKorpiklaani - Kohmelo (Karkelo) - YouTube\n\nI always though Classical Music, the score from Last of the Mohicans. Violin Music and the like, just classical music. Cain't forget Gordon Lightfoot: \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" - Gordon Lightfoot (HD w/ Lyrics) - YouTube\n\nThis band: Bathory - Twilight Of The Gods (With Lyrics) - YouTube\n\nI really don't like the other music selections listed with this, but it's a unique song i think.\n\nAnd the man in black: Johnny Cash - A Boy Named Sue - YouTube"
