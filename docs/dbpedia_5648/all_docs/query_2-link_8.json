        "text": "~\n\nToday, Black Metal Daily proudly partners with our longtime friends and conspirators at cult label Realm and Ritual to present the exclusive full stream of an EP that will have you sharpening your blades and raising a claw to the night sky… Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations, the upcoming third release from Brazilian entity NÖLDR.\n\nForged in 2019 and wasting no time at all releasing two killer albums in the venerated dyad of Misanthropic Forest and Profane Eternity, it has thus been proven that Nöldr does NOT mess around; and as expected, Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations once again sees sole practitioner Lord Deathlaff charged up to attack. As he launches into the heavy, d-beat onslaught of opener ‘Hymn ov the Moon’, his roar is in fine form, linking arms with the bestial energy of the track to rush headlong at the enemy… before it all switches into the brand of soaring, medieval nostalgia and lacerating passion he summons with such devastating ease and effectiveness. As evidenced by his previous works, Nöldr riffs are simply great riffs – firmly entrenched in the Scandinavian past yet with one eye on the current epoch – and the composition calls to your blood, stirring the spirit and whipping you into a lunar frenzy. As might be expected (considering the name), ‘Hymn ov the Moon II’ strikes further along the same selenic pathways, the pair combining in a superb one-two punch of crepuscular madness that make the EP worth the price of admission alone. But wait! Then… ‘Warriors of the Frozen Wastes’ arrives.\n\nInfused with that delicious rolling, frostbitten epic-ness and nobility that the later Abbath-era Immortal might have conjured, this beast does indeed call to mind images of fur-clad warriors riding in to glorious battle on bitter hyperboreal plains. You’ll be tapping your foot or nodding along with the rhythmic pulse that seems to echo through aeons of ice, and will have you coming back for more, again and again… once the final, and titular, ambient synth outro track ‘Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations’ has allowed time to contemplate the aftermath of what you have just experienced, of course.\n\nReleasing on limited cassette in the next Realm and Ritual drop this coming Friday, this tantalisingly short EP stakes itself a claim as one of the finest underground black metal releases of the year to to date by virtue of doing more in three short tracks (plus outro) than many bands accomplish in an entire album. To accompany our full stream we were also privileged to partake in a quick chat with Lord Deathlaff himself; so listen below, read on for a glimpse behind the shrouded mysteries of this EP’s creation, and be sure to pick up a tape on Friday while you can. For when Nöldr calls you to battle… you MUST answer. Hails.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nHail Lord Deathlaff! It is a pleasure to speak with you today for the full stream of Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations, the third Nöldr release. First things first: to what does the title refer? Are we within the Dynasty right now?\n\nLD: Greetings my friend! The pleasure is all mine! So, first of all, the title and the whole album refers to the Battle of the Morannon from J.R.R Tolkien. We can consider our reality that we’re already living in the Dynasty now.\n\nThe initial two tracks, ‘Hymn ov the Moon I &II’, form a sort of suite to begin proceedings. Can you tell us a little about the meaning behind these tracks and their relation to each other?\n\nLD: The first two songs I made with the intention of giving an aspect of Warsong, something to give chills. The Moon is basically the only light when you are in the darkness, the horror of a battle gives this aspect.\n\nThis release is also the first Nöldr EP, after two full-lengths. Why did you decide to release these four tracks as an EP, instead of working towards another full album?\n\nLD: I always have new ideas, so I decided it would be better to release singles, EP’s and splits with the intention of keeping my public always updated with my ideas… I think an album must have a huge weight. Of course I will continue releasing albums, but always with the intention of bringing an evolution, so as not to become something like “That Album Part 2”.\n\nSpeaking of evolution: pressing play on the EP, we immediately see another development in your sound – I love how you always seem to be progressing and pushing the project further with every release. Is this a conscious thing on your behalf?\n\nLD: Yes! It’s like I said in my previous answer, I’m always looking for something new, and to improve better and better. Although I try not to deviate from Nöldr’s proposal and I’m happy to be keeping the proposal as planned.\n\nImprovisation has always played a sizeable part within Nöldr. Is this still the case for Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations? Why do you utilise this technique within your work?\n\nLD: I think music is basically feeling, a different language. Talking about improvisation: you put all your feeling between the right lines, it’s like you’re saying some quotes.\n\nIn my head it makes sense. Music is basically another language, like our languages.\n\nRiffs are certainly your stock in trade – there are some rippers on this record (that one in ‘Warriors of the Frozen Wastes’ is a personal favourite). Do you start with a riff first when creating a track? What is your usual compositional process?\n\nLD: My composition process is kinda fun. I hope that help a lot of people, haha. I’m always listening to music, so I think all of my ideas comes from what I listen to. I start singing a melody first – it can be any time of the day – after that I write the base harmony on paper. I really recommend people to have a notion of the harmonic field, at least the basics. Sometimes I write some tablatures but only in cases of solos and melody. After that I record directly on the computer. Today, things are easier, it was difficult when I recorded my first album Misanthropic Forest. Basically it was all with a Boss Katana MkII amplifier and my phone earphones.\n\nI believe you play every instrument within Nöldr yourself, including the drums, which is rare for many solo projects. Is Nöldr your only musical outlet? What was your pathway to becoming such a proficient multi-instrumentalist?\n\nLD: Yes, I’ve learned to play several instruments since I was 12 years old.\n\nI had some garage bands during my high school, but all of them were not in the metal genre. At least during them I acquired a lot of knowledge of mixing, mastering and behavior inside a music studio.\n\nI think the most difficult instrument is the drums, and I admire those who play well. I don’t consider myself a good drummer; I just know the basics and sometimes I repeat the same lines. I think I have more knowledge on bass and guitar.\n\nDo you find working as a solo artist easier than collaborating with other artists?\n\nLD: The only good thing about it is the fact that you feel freedom to put 100% all your ideas, but sometimes I miss that team feeling. Having a band is awesome when you are within the nice people, considered as “Friends”.\n\nThere are many classic influences to be found within the Nöldr sound, not least of all Judas Iscariot. Which artists have been some of the strongest artistic inspirations for you, and did any in particular inform the creation of Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations?\n\nLD: Many inspirations, such as Sargeist, Moortrieder, Nargaroth, Drowning the Light and especially Lamp of Murmmur. It would be awesome make a split with Lamp.\n\nBrazil has always played a massive part in the history and development of Black Metal, from the earliest days of Sarcófago, Vulcano, Mystifier etc to the current epoch of artists. Do you feel a closeness to your national scene? What is your opinion on the older bands, and do you feel there are any particularly underrated newer artists within your country that deserve closer attention?\n\nLD: Not that close. The Brazilian scene in general don’t like the “difference”, so the majority always make the same cliche stereotypes which are not cool anymore. But there’s still some nice bands from my country, and they need more visibility.\n\nBy the way: Sarcófago is the father of the blast beats, in my opinion.\n\nNöldr is, quite unmistakably, quintessential black metal. What does “black metal” mean to you?\n\nLD: Black metal to me means… like a horror movie, but with an old style vibe. Something like castles, swords and tragedies.\n\nAnd finally, as this is the premiere of the EP, I shall leave the final thoughts about it to you: what do you hope the listener to glean from the experience of Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations?\n\nLD: Well, I hope that I can bring new listeners, everyone is welcome. But actually I just do all of this because I love it; the process of creating music and drawing the art cover, everything.\n\nSincerest thanks for your time, Lord Deathlaff. It has been a pleasure. Any last words or wisdoms you would like to leave us with?\n\nLD: My last words is: stay heavy and don’t forget to drink water!\n\nDynasty ov the Darkened Evocations releases May 26th via Realm and Ritual.\n\n~\n\nPurchase Dynasty ov the Darkened Evocations from the Nöldr Bandcamp HERE or the Realm and Ritual Bandcamp HERE on May 26th.\n\nSupport NÖLDR:\n\nOfficial Facebook\n\nOfficial Instagram\n\nOfficial Bandcamp\n\n~\n\nFollow Black Metal Daily on Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Bandcamp HERE for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\n~\n\nBy AK Bergwanderer and GOS\n\n~\n\nGOS: Well, well, here we are, back again. Straight off the finale of the AULD RIDGE review, AKB and I decided that we gotta take life by the horns and yolo / inertia / all that stupid shit and roll right into a review of O.W.G.A.‘s concurrent release from brother project ALBIONIC HERMETICISM, in a blatant attempt to brainwash readers into loving The Hermetic Order of Ytene family as much as we do. *motions of worship commence*\n\nAKB: Hell yes, I’m all aboard The Hermetic Order of Ytene train, and have no qualms keeping this one rolling along.\n\nGOS: I feel like we should do some preliminary conceptual groundwork, but without giving away too much, because at the time of writing this, access to information about this concept of the album is limited. Nova Nativitas Mundi is being described as “a space opera in 3 acts”, which, briefly, revolve around a cosmic quest for divinity, the encountering of Satan, and subsequent Satanic galactic imperialism. Now that we have that covered…\n\n~\n\n~\n\n‘Prologue’ / ‘The Devil In A Conical Flask (Or His Unholy Formula)’\n\nGOS: Oooooohhhhhhh this is spacy and cozy, psychedelic. Or is it just me? Floaty synth with acoustics creeping in… AAAAAAEEEEEEEHHH!!!\n\nAKB: And BOOOOOMMM, it goes off. The first actual track certainly didn’t fuck about starting off… but man, this got a bit trippy. ‘Spacy’ is a very apt term, describing both the intro and now barely a minute into the first proper track! But man… not unlike the AULD RIDGE, the guitars are NOT messing around. None of it is messing around, if we’re being honest.\n\nGOS: Yeah, as expected, it is riffing all over the place. It reminds me of something… Oh it’s WINDIR! And these initial vocals remind me of ESOCTRILIHUM. But more rudimentary sounding. In a good way, if that makes sense.\n\nAKB: There’s also a murkiness that is different from the AULD RIDGE record, but then again, that’s been one of the differing factors between these two specific projects. ALBIONIC HERMETICISM is a bit more raw and “out there”, so to speak.\n\nGOS: Definitely. This seems both more raw and more… abstract.\n\nAKB: I can’t bring a specific comparison to mind, vocally, but did I just hear some clean vocals buried in there that was a bit Attila-like? This is already a journey. I expect nothing less from a self proclaimed “Space Opera” as stated in the booklet. And while this is more abstract for sure… this is so far the most accessible ALBIONIC HERMETICISM album to date, already. The other albums I have to be in a mood to sit down and listen to a whole album. This is already something I know I will visit again multiple times. I’m liking this. I’m really liking the more delicate moments, when there’s space (no pun intended), room for the song to breathe and guide us along.\n\nGOS: There’s definitely something about this that feels more… I dunno… delicate? Pristine? But not in production, it’s just that there is some element that seems almost graceful or beautiful or something. I dunno. Maybe I am too high. Haha.\n\nAKB: Nah man, I hear it too. It sounds vast. This is what other “space themed” black metal acts strive for, I assume, but it comes off… muddled. There is an underlying beauty to the proceedings so far. And… that was 12 minutes of music already??\n\nGOS: THE FUCK? That was like a goddamn time warp. Really? Dude. I think I might be a little too high. Or maybe just right for this I dunno. Whew. Aaaanyway… It’s strange, because compared to AULD RIDGE, this definitely seems more, well, all those things we mentioned up above. In a word, let’s say ‘atmospheric’ or ‘cosmic’. But, prior to this I have always thought of ALBIONIC HERMETICISM – Psalms to the Father, anyway – to be more aggressive and heavier, like AULD RIDGE but a little more deathy. That is NOT what is going on here.\n\nAKB: Yeah, this is not like the previous efforts at ALL. I hear that same kind of… ’avantgarde’ vibe the other albums of this project have, but yeah, it’s not nearly as harsh. As I stated before, I have to be in the right mood to sit down with the other ALBIONIC HERMETICISM albums. And, I think we’re seeing this continued trend of these projects under this Hermetic Order banner becoming more homogeneous. I hear AULD RIDGE, I hear SKARE, but it still stands out as different from those other two monikers of O.W.G.A.\n\nGOS: It almost seems to me like AULD RIDGE is sort of the backbone, it seems more consistent and predictably awesome album to album, while ALBIONIC HERMETICISM is a bit of a grab bag. Sometimes deathier, sometimes cosmic (apparently), sometimes… what do the earlier ALBIONIC HERMETICISM albums sound like? You know them better than I do.\n\nAKB: Simply put, the earlier efforts are raw black metal, with a tendency to get off into some weird headspace. Never too far *out there*, but there’s a feeling of experimentation. They have some rather bipolar moments. And keep in mind I’m only speaking of the two splits and the preceding two full length efforts. The very first full length… ehhhhh, I’m not a fan. O.W.G.A. was definitely trying to find his footing, and he hadn’t found it yet. It’s pretty standard stuff, but not particularly interesting. But, it’s probably still better than any number of projects out there. You know, it dawns on me; without knowing what O.W.G.A. is all about in his day-to-day life, and in thinking about the prior AH albums, I wonder if AH is a project he does the compositions for when he is under the influence of something mind altering. Be it drugs, alcohol, both, whatever the case may be. AULD RIDGE is so much more straight laced and focused (as you alluded to previously), while this has more of a “free form” thing going on.\n\nGOS: Perhaps! I hope we get a chance to ask him. I do know that I’m currently experiencing a good amount of… ummm… *saturation* with this Nova Nativitas Mundi!\n\nAKB: Speaking of which, the title track is up next.\n\nGOS: *mentally buckles up*\n\n‘Nova Nativitas Mundi’\n\nGOS: Wow this riff is… all over the goddamn place. Is this a riff? Or is he just doing whatever? I’m having trouble finding a solid pattern repetition. Jeezus. I’m gonna have to listen to this so many times to try to figure out what the guitar alone is doing.\n\nAKB: Woah… I like how this kicks off!! It’s almost… ’70s prog. PROGRESSIVE. That’s another way to describe this whole album so far. I am a bit annoyed that there are no lyrics to read along with. I can call there’s something conversational happening with the vocals. Like there’s different characters speaking. And here we go… a little more aggression and beef in the 3min mark.\n\nGOS: Yeah it sort of solidified into familiar territory for a second there but that guitar is STILL all over the place.\n\nAKB: Let’s face it: O.W.G.A. is just showing off at this point. His guitar prowess and songwriting ability is off the damn charts.\n\nGOS: Yeah this is some Faustian shit. I wonder if he “wrote” this beforehand or just fucking *did* it during the recording. The guitar work has a very improvised, almost jazzy feel to it (without sounding like jazz at all). There was some cool chanting that flew past there which I really enjoyed, and you are right, there is definitely a discourse happening within the music that we cannot make out.\n\nAKB: I had refrained from saying “improvised”…but now that you say it. There is that kind of flow to it, just finding a groove, a track to fall into and is just playing what comes to mind. He’s pulling a Roman Saenko under his WINDSWEPT guise on us. OR, O.W.G.A. just has that big of a brain and is just a musical savant.\n\nGOS: I’m gonna give the credit to his spirit, not his flesh! I just realized I heard about 15% of that song. I was so zoned in on the guitar that I don’t even know what the rest of it was. It’s tempting to replay it again, but for some reason it seems almost daunting, like I just know I’m going to get lost again.\n\nAKB: Aside from the fact that it was a title song, and it should be dense as all hell, there’s just a ton of stuff going on musically with this entire album. It’s quite cinematic, really. My little computer speaker setup does this no justice at all. I think I need a massive 1980’s stereo and speaker system to fully appreciate everything that is happening. Not that I don’t appreciate it right now, but it needs a bigger room and much more volume! Haha.\n\nGOS: I do have it playing loud on big speakers (small space, however), and I can tell you, it is quite overwhelming. Earlier I could have kept up with it, but as I’m getting more tired, there is SO MUCH going on that it is pretty disorienting.\n\n‘Agios! The Cosmic Temple of Satan Is Born’\n\nAKB: What in the name of ABIGOR is up with that song title? I’m sure it will be another mind-melting, lengthy slab of spacy insanity. And I love the thought of it. This is by far my favorite ALBIONIC HERMETICISM to date. I feel I can say that with confidence now that we’re this far along.\n\nGOS: I’m on the fence. This is trippy and cool, but so different from Psalms, and I like Psalms a LOT. I’ll have to do a side-by-side someday, and it’s a little strange to anticipate that it might be apples and oranges even though they are both ALBIONIC HERMETICISM.\n\nAKB: For me, I think it’s the accessibility of it. It’s not quite as much a strain on the ear as the earlier albums, and… maybe due to this concept album thing going on with this one, there’s a consistency between the tracks that I can latch onto. Whatever the case, I just love it. Anyway, so we have this ABIGOR-inspired song title, let’s see what an audio representation of a Cosmic Temple For Satan sounds like… Oh this is nasty, vicious. Much more assertive.\n\nGOS: YES! I can dig this. Way more straightforward than that meandering of the last track. Now THIS reminds me a bit more of the last album of AULD RIDGE. I like the more upbeat groove and the chanting vocals, but also when it slows down into this almost meditative psychedelica.\n\nAKB: This interlude part… this has to be real drums. Yes, I’m still stuck on that. I like this ethereal, trippy vibe going on. AND BOOM. What an explosion back to the blasts!\n\nGOS: Yeah I like this better than the last track fo sho.\n\nAKB: If I didn’t know better, I’d say it makes sense this track is like THIS, as this story is starting to get to its final stanzas. A climax of a track. Once again, I long for the lyrics to this madness. And I do not typically say that about a black metal album.\n\nGOS: Let’s ask him! I got an email reply from O.W.G.A a few days ago that he is interested in an interview with Black Metal Daily! Man this song is great. A great closing track… except there is actually still the Epilogue to go.\n\nAKB: I’m still mind blown about that news. And oh yeah, there *is* an Epilogue, isn’t there? Haha.\n\n‘Epilogue’\n\nGOS: … an epilogue which is layers of reverbing riffs across an easy-flowing tempo and perfectly audible bass and keys. Even as an album outro, this is very enjoyable.\n\nAKB: It sounds like a dirge of sorts. Satan has won, the defeated are marching to their doom… but what is this..? There’s a bit of piano and an uplifting melody emerging? This is rather epically cinematic. Oh man, I’m really liking this riff pattern happening now…and the synth touches… I get ’70s vibes. OOOhhhh… this gets a bit… ominous… in the closing bit of this, eh?\n\nGOS: Yeah, very beautiful towards the end… overtaken by feedback… then beauty again for the fade out.\n\nAKB: What a ride of an album.\n\nGOS: Definitely demands subsequent listens to try to grasp what is going on. At the very least with the pretty significant variability between tracks.\n\nAKB: For sure. I’m definitely going to be diving in on this one a few more times. There is variability between the tracks, but there’s still a cohesion that ties it all together. Perhaps a *CHAOTIC* cohesion, but it’s still cohesion. Man, ‘Agios!…’ and the ‘Epilogue’ really steals the show here. Everything prior was just a big build up to these tracks, which does make sense as part of a concept album. Once again, I do hear elements of O.W.G.A’s other projects in the mix. And yet, this still stands on its own legs as quite the entity itself. Bravo!\n\nGOS: I’m not sure that all of what is offered here hits the same as the parts that I like the best, which is basically the more straightforward and aggressive element, but I would be lying if I said that the album concept and the corresponding divergence of different styles isn’t intriguing.\n\nAKB: I can certainly appreciate that train of thought. I’m with you, in regards to the more straightforward moments on this album. I obviously like those parts the best. HOWEVER, the super trippy free flowing riff fest presented for the majority of this wasn’t a big ear strain for me. My big issue with a lot of the more “avantgarde” styles of black metal is the pure note density that tends to happen. There’s space for the notes to breathe (as we had talked about earlier), and you actually can hear what O.W.G.A. is doing at any given point in time, instead of having to decipher layers upon layers of tracks and murk to figure out half of what’s going on with other artists. May not be a big deal for some, but that’s huge for me and my particular tastes. If more of these types of projects had a similar approach to the production as *this*I would be a much bigger fan of this particular subgenre of black metal.\n\nGOS: I’m with you. I think it happens when the avant-garde style ends up being too technical or progressive, too complicated, and usually too sterile. In this case though I would describe it less as that and more borrowing elements from, like, psychedelic rock or something, with a very stripped-down, organic feel. I approve.\n\nAKB: That’s a fair point. Maybe I’m a bit loose, or even unknowing with the “avant-garde” tag, but then again I don’t really listen to many of those kinds of bands. The progressive element should have been a more obvious descriptor for me, as now I’m reminded of the earliest Arcturus albums (ok, the first album), and maybe even ‘Vikgingr Veldi’-era Enslaved. You know, where it’s obviously black metal but there’s much more complex musical backbone underneath it all. I did pick up on all those ’70s psych-rock flourishes as well. I bet O.W.G.A. has quite an extensive music collection in his abode. And I suppose that is something that could be asked in a potential interview!\n\nNova Nativitas Mundi is available now via The Hermetic Order of Ytene and Dark Adversary Productions.\n\n~\n\nPurchase Nova Nativitas Mundi on CD and digital from The Hermetic Order of Ytene Bandcamp HERE or the Dark Adversary Productions webstore HERE.\n\nSupport ALBIONIC HERMETICISM:\n\nThe Hermetic Order of Ytene Bandcamp\n\nOfficial Albionic Hermeticism Facebook\n\n~\n\nFollow Black Metal Daily on Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Bandcamp HERE for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\n~\n\nCollaborative Review by AK Bergwanderer and GOS\n\n~\n\nGOS: Tyler! My man! How are you doing on this fine evening? I, for one am fucking AMPED about this new AULD RIDGE release Folklore from Further Out, as well as other upcoming activity from this artist which will be forthcoming this year.\n\nAKB: Yo! I am doing great! I too am equally pumped about the new AULD RIDGE! A collaborative review is the perfect way to celebrate this.\n\nGOS: I sort of forget which one of us came across AULD RIDGE first. I actually think that it was our Black Metal Daily contributor and cohort Nathan who brought the project to my attention, and then I might have shared it with you somewhere along the way? But at any rate, I know that in 2021 I was introduced to The Hermetic Order of Ytene with AULD RIDGE’s Consanguineous Tales of Bloodshed and Treachery, then the sister album Consanguineous Hymns of Faith and Famine shortly thereafter, then I discovered ALBIONIC HERMETICISM and I was off to the races, so to speak! Since then we have both been following Ytene pretty closely.\n\nAKB: I believe you are correct… I seem to recall Nathan posting about it, then I dove right on into the Hermetic Order rabbit hole. Perhaps you tagged me in a post? It doesn’t matter at this point, but I am glad it happened! Anyway, …Hymns of Faith and Famine and Mítt Ríce is where my AULD RIDGE experience began. I’ve only recently tracked down a copy of …Bloodshed and Treachery, and I could NOT be happier about that. I did get into ALBIONIC HERMETICISM at the same time, starting with Psalms To The Father and the Swēsaz Ambos split with YNKLEUDHERHENAVOGYON (however the hell you pronounce *THAT*). In other words, I tread down a similar path of discovery as you. I have since then been able to obtain all the physical copies I can get, that’s available in my preferred CD format anyway, from each of these projects.\n\nGOS: In an effort to catch readers up with this black metal badassery, what we have here, as far as I know, is one artist who goes by the title O.W.G.A., is from England but is currently living in France, and who runs his own small label called The Hermetic Order of Ytene, with support and distribution from Amor Fati Productions and Dark Adversary Productions. Beneath the Ytene banner he has at least three active projects, which are AULD RIDGE, ALBIONIC HERMETICISM, and SKARE (which, oddly, in some places is listed as a project from Australia). I am familiar with the most recent albums from each project but I think you are more familiar with the discographies as a whole. Since AULD RIDGE is our subject here, how would you describe them as distinct from the other two?\n\nAKB: Well, first off, I would say all of the projects have a very strong second wave foundation. AULD RIDGE perhaps being the most ‘traditional’ of the three, with the additional influence of some really good folk music roots. ALBIONIC HERMETICISM seems to be more raw, and a bit more avante-garde in its approach. SKARE I would describe as being most like your traditional, yet way above average “atmospheric black metal” project. It truly is difficult to figure out how to properly separate them out, as all three projects do have massive amounts of atmosphere that they each create. All three projects revolve around the almighty riff. However, with the onset of both Folklore From Further Out and Nova Nativitas Mundi, the newest ALBIONIC HERMETICISM effort, any of those distinct lines that separated these three specific projects have gotten a bit blurred. Each of these two specific albums borrow elements from the others. But we’ll get deeper into that here in a minute. Though I will say that ALBIONIC HERMETICISM deserves its own dedicated analysis at some point soon. Time to focus on the task at hand!\n\nGOS: Absolutely!\n\n~\n\n~\n\n‘A Pact With Kólumkilli’\n\nGOS: No idea who Kólumkilli is. Wikipedia says: “Independent People: An Epic (Icelandic: Sjálfstætt fólk) is a novel by Nobel laureate Halldór Laxness, originally published in two volumes in 1934 and 1935… The novel is considered among the foremost examples of social realism in Icelandic fiction in the 1930s. It is an indictment of materialism, the cost of the self-reliant spirit to relationships, and capitalism itself. …Independent People is the story of the sheep farmer Guðbjartur Jónsson Bjartur… [who] has recently managed to put down the first payment on his own farm… The land that he buys is said to be cursed by Saint Columba, referred to as ‘the fiend Kolumkilli’ and haunted by an evil woman named Gunnvör, who made a pact with Kólumkilli.”\n\nAKB: Yeah, I have no idea who the players are in this tale, but we do get a glimpse of the premise of what Folklore From Further Out is actually referring to. I had read, I believe on the Dark Adversary website, that each song is a different folktale from the UK and also beyond their borders. Further out from home, as it were.\n\nGOS: Indeed. In this case, I’m not sure if the first track is referring to Iceland or Ireland, however, as Saint Columba is a Catholic Saint mostly involved in Irish lore. At any rate… pressing ‘play’. Standard simple riff at first but I just KNOW this is going to go off into some epic shit. Some atmospheric synth comes in at about 1 minute… pace is picking up by 1:30… here we go…\n\nAKB: The very first thing that jumps out to me is the big step up in production compared to previous efforts. Not that the previous albums sounded horrible by any means, but this is a big step up. That bass guitar is really cutting through!\n\nGOS: Yeah, definitely! Okay, now about 2.5 minutes in and I guess this is a good time to note right off the bat that this dude is a fucking riff machine. I don’t know how he comes up with such amazing guitar work for all three projects! Ahhh, 3:45 it hits! Everything just got dialed up and by 4:10 we are in full, epic swing. That didn’t take long! Fuuuuuuuck. Ugh, I love this so much already.\n\nAKB: Yes! This is, by far, some of his best riff work for any of his prior albums under this particular banner. And we’re not even 6 min into the first song. I should ask if you’re already seeing what I alluded to earlier, about how O.W.G.A. seems to be combining elements from the other projects. A similar move I had felt Roman Saenko pulled in that newest HATE FOREST album, as we heard elements of Drudkh, Windswept, etc. This sounds like an Auld Ridge album, but it is offering SO much more than before. I mean, more than epic, melodic, savage riffwork of course. And… drums sound more live than before, like recorded in a legit studio. To be quite honest, I don’t recall the drums on previous efforts sounding fake per se, but this is another element that has stepped up on top of everything else.\n\nGOS; Absolutely. Although I think I would need more listens to really absorb everything, I certainly recognize some SKARE elements in the keys here. They have that sort of church/medieval/ almost gothic sound to them which I mostly associate with SKARE. The feels in the second half of this track are out of control. Not only can he riff like a madman, but the melodies he creates are sublime, both the fast ones and the slow and acoustic ones.\n\n‘Titchfield Abbey’\n\nAKB: Something about this definitely reminds me of the Mítt Ríce debut…\n\nGOS: I’m not as familiar. Does it have a lot of acoustic material? That’s what this is, quite beautiful. Side note: “Titchfield Abbey is a medieval abbey and later country house, located in the village of Titchfield near Fareham in Hampshire, England. The abbey was founded in 1222 for Premonstratensian canons, an austere order of priests. The abbey was a minor house of its order, and became neither wealthy nor influential during its three centuries of monastic life; the inhabitants were devoted to scholarship, as shown by their very impressive library.” (Wikipedia)\n\nAKB: It’s all acoustic, save for the very last track. And it doesn’t really go “black metal”. Instead, it’s a rather sludgy, doom-y affair. But, yes, this is absolutely the type of material that makes up that first album. And you are right, this is a beautiful track!\n\n‘The Sound Of The Fyrth Begins To Creep’\n\nGOS: This one starts out pretty slow and plodding. Building up to something at 2 minutes… oh, nevermind. More acoustic, but still building… THERE WE GO! Love the second wave-ish riff towards the end of the 3 minute mark, then the double kick ramps up and the keyboard swells, then it chills out a little and does it again… this is awesome.\n\nAKB: Oh man… that acoustic bit… with the slinky bass guitar… building up to that literal EXPLOSION. “Epic” is a term that gets tossed around far too freely, and I am as guilty as anyone of using such a phrase, but holy fuckin’ hell, how else do you describe this when such a simple word suffices? And there we go again with the medieval sounding synth work. The riff work once again proves to be mind boggling. Was that a lead guitar lick we just heard??? I’m looking at the lyrics right now, and I am uncertain of the source. But in a nutshell, it tells the tale of a priest traveling from Ulster towards Meath (Ireland) in the middle of the night, who encounters a hideous beast. This beast explains that a great curse had been placed upon it by an abbot named Natalis, and is wishing for last rites so it can die a ‘Christian Death’. In hopes that others can get their hands on a physical copy themselves, I will offer no spoilers about the tale’s end, but it’s rather scholastic, well written stuff. Ok, MASSIVE is another way to describe this album so far. Another overused phrase, but fuck it. It works.\n\nGOS: The second half of this track is just riff upon riff upon riff… and this song is almost 11 minutes long! I’m hearing symphony, choirs, and that double kick just keeps coming in and fucking it up! Whew! Next level, even for AULD RIDGE!\n\n‘Auld Spurgin Hide’\n\nGOS: I’m noting that this is another acoustic deal, and I’m also seeing that the pattern continues with yet another shorter acoustic track in between the next two longer, presumably black metal tracks. You don’t mind it in this case? I know that that was one of your criticisms of the band STORMRULER (which is fucking great by the way), that they put instrumental interludes between each track…\n\nAKB: My issue with the STORMRULER interludes is that they all sound like symphonic power metal openers, and were total energy killers for me while sandwiched between quite adept melodic black metal tracks. On this album, #1) There’s not 20 tracks to sift through, with ten of each kind of musical selection. #2) The interludes on *this* album fits the vibe and overall aesthetic that the proper black metal tracks establish, and it feels like a cohesive WHOLE, and not filler for the sake of having BLIND GUARDIAN levels of absurd track listings. Something even they themselves have gotten away from. But I digress, with the acoustic moments that have popped up so far in the metallic offerings, the interludes don’t feel all that out of place. And, admittedly, I am quite a neo-folk fan anyway, so this is all in my preferred listening wheelhouse, so to speak.\n\nGOS: Fair enough. For some reason even though on paper STORMRULER is overdoing it, it has never bothered me in listening. And these AULD RIDGE interludes certainly aren’t putting me off. They are quite beautiful.\n\nAKB: I think a big part of my enjoyment of these acoustic tracks, is the fact that you can tell there is the same kind of care and effort into actually constructing a proper *song* out of these tracks, as he’s put in with the proper metal tracks. It’s not just an atypical “black metal band strums an acoustic guitar and calls it an interlude” type of tune that was probably whipped up, on the fly, while recording in the studio. O.W.G.A. approaches these tracks with the mindset of a proper neo-folk artist, in my opinion.\n\n‘An Omen of Death Heralds the Season’\n\nGOS: Well, this one wastes no time… Goddamn.\n\nAKB: Yeah man, I was looking forward to this one. This is one of the three teaser tracks that came out on YouTube. Call it bias from hearing this previously, but this one is probably my favorite track. THE RIIIFFFFSSSSS!!!\n\nGOS: Exactly! It’s just nonstop. And that fast-as-fuck double kick right before the two minute mark was awesome. I am fighting the urge to immediately replay the track before it finishes. Uuuuuuugh. There’s just something so… so… just fucking authentic, pure about this guy’s work. Just unmistakably Black. Fucking. Metal.\n\nAKB: And I’m here trying to determine whether or not it was the change in scenery, moving from the UK to France that inspired this unbridled energy on display… or if someone just royally slighted him in the worst way and he’s making a fucking POINT. As much as I really enjoy the previous efforts, this song just set in stone the top slot for this album in regards to the Auld Ridge discography. OH MY GAWD THIS HALF TIME PART. I’m headbanging and having similar feelings of wanting to start this over. What an exhilarating ride that track was! And I have to point out the BASS GUITAR… man do I LOVE good audible bass playing on a black metal album.\n\nGOS: Man, I wasn’t even paying attention to it at all, I was just getting consumed by those riffs. Fuck, lets play it again?\n\nAKB: Fine by me. Be ready for the 4 string monstrosity on display! Or 5… who knows. I just know dude goes off with it.\n\nGOS: And the keys! AND THE DRUMS. Fuuuuuuuuck! I can’t believe this dude does everything. Just now noticing that extra guitar AND the bass at 2 minutes! Wow.\n\nAKB: Yeah dude. And I keep going back and forth as to whether or not these are live drums, or if they are programmed. I know sound file technology has come a very long way, but man… there’s a feel to this that just screams “live drummer”. There’s a nuance that is REAL hard to replicate if you DON’T have drumming experience. Nothing sounds too over the top. Just unreal. Everything about this track, and album as a whole has been unreal.\n\nGOS: Yeah, it sounds very organic. Everything does. Nothing here is pristine and it is fucking great. Even the synth is kinda murky. We gotta interview this guy and find out. That track is a masterpiece. I feel the same way about the track ‘Beyond The Church Spires’ that he does for SKARE, but this track is much more straight to the point, no-holds-barred.\n\nAKB: Here we go again with that half tempo, almost moshable section before track end. And yes, I agree about the interview. We somehow have to make it happen. But…on the other hand, this air of mystery is pretty cool too. In this modern age it’s pretty hard to keep mostly anonymous, so I have to give props to those who can pull it off.\n\nGOS: It seemed like he was trying to stay under cover with SKARE, but I sniffed that one out on my first listen, way before it appeared in The Hermetic Order of Ytene. It just sounded too close to AULD RIDGE.\n\nAKB: Yeah, I think that was pretty easy to figure out. Between being released on the same label as AULD RIDGE, et al, and then showing up on the AULD RIDGE Bandcamp page, along with the other Hermetic Order projects. And yeah, it sounds A LOT like AULD RIDGE for sure. And on the flip side, I feel this AULD RIDGE album pulls elements from SKARE (the synths…). Again, things are getting a little homogenous with these projects, and I am absolutely here for it.\n\nGOS: Definitely. I don’t really care what he’s calling anything to be honest, I’m buying everything that he offers. In my opinion this family of projects is one of the most exciting *new* developments in black metal.\n\nAKB: I strive to do the same. Well, for sure the ones that get released in my preferred format anyway. But regardless, 100% full support, in any way I can give it. If it has to be digital, then whatever. Full support!\n\n‘Tornedalen’\n\nGOS: This intermission track is beautiful. My favorite of them I think, I like the low key electric guitar towards the end. Finnish folk, represent: “Tornedalians descend from Finnish peasants who arrived from today’s western and eastern Finland. Settlements began during the Middle Ages around the northern end of the Gulf of Bothnia and along the river valleys nearby…” (Wikipedia)\n\nAKB: I’m glad you’re on top of the research for these tracks. And yes, once again, a fully thought out, COMPOSED acoustic/neo-folk song. Part of me is a little bummed we’re getting to the closer now… what a ride this album has been up to this point.\n\nGOS: No kidding! Well… at least we have the new ALBIONIC HERMETICISM to check out still! Haha!\n\nTYL: Hell yes!\n\n‘Where Night’s Black Bird Her Sad Infamy Sings (John Downland)’\n\nGOS: Fifteen seconds in and I love it already. Who the hell is John Downland? “John Dowland (c. 1563 – buried 20 February 1626) was an English Renaissance composer, lutenist, and singer.” (Wikipedia)\n\nAKB: No wasted moments. Everything is firing on all cylinders. This dude is NOT messing around. Have you been noticing the subtle lead work buried in some of the guitar tracks? And once again that bass is keeping right up with it all. I may have to change my mind on what my favorite track has been to this point… but then again, why pick one singular song when EVERY SONG has been nothing short of exquisite.\n\nGOS: You know you are listening to a great album when your favorite track is whichever one you are listening to.\n\nAKB: Definitely a rare feat, especially in this age of oversaturation when every day sees a million new releases, good, bad or otherwise. I’m sitting here thinking about it, and I have to say, it’s a very small list of albums I can bring to mind where there literally was no weak songs. And, think about this: This is full length number four. More often than not in this beloved genre, a band will come out of the gates super hot and then taper off with time. AULD RIDGE has only been IMPROVING with each release.\n\nAnd man….HOW EPIC HAS THESE LAST COUPLE MINUTES BEEN? WOW! And yes, I did throw out that overused word to describe this. Yet again.\n\nGOS: I wasn’t really expecting this track to slow down in the middle but it almost had an intermission-like acoustic interlude for a bit and then finished up with this slower, really grandiose, majestic finale. Epic seems to be a perfect way to describe it.\n\nTYL: As we go through our final thoughts, I’m totally starting the album over again.\n\nGOS: Same! Man Folklore From Further Out is fucking fantastic! I think we both have this drive to instantly replay the album and figure out which track rocks the hardest and find all of the intricacies. But at the same time, everything seems so… again, organic, or natural, or perfectly integrated, that I’m really not sure that I’m going to be able to pick it apart. And maybe I shouldn’t anyway!\n\nAKB: I WISH more bands could aspire for this kind of a “natural” balanced attack in the production aspect of their albums. Every instrument and vocal part has its place, and everything supports one another. AS IT SHOULD BE. A lot of modern production has a pop sensibility, in the sense that the vocals and drums are more upfront. I absolutely LOVE how not one thing overpowers anything else. Everything has its chance to shine, everything is heard loud and clear, and the end result is absolutely spectacular. Everything is on display for the world to hear. Nothing is hidden behind excessive layers of murk and reverb. Proof that great, smart songwriting and powerful music creates a powerful atmosphere. Simply put, we are truly seeing a genius at work here. WOW what a listening experience this is! This is an album I fully support everyone taking in as a whole, in one sitting. Something I DEFINITELY do not say for all albums.\n\nGOS: Absolutely. I become more and more enthralled with every listen, and that sentiment isn’t limited to just Folklore… any time I listen to any of the albums from any of these projects, my hype intensifies for all of them.\n\nAKB: As you, and others, are fully aware, I definitely hold this project in high regard. Honestly, I could say that for each of the Hermetic Order projects. Anyway, when I saw this album was coming out, along with the new ALBIONIC HERMETICISM, in my mind I already had both in my top 20 of 2023. Even though there’s practically ⅔ of a year still to go, not to mention that at that time I had only heard one track from each thanks to his YouTube channel. But now that we’ve really dug into Folklore From Further Out in depth, I’m proclaiming right now that this is on top of the heap for this year. O.W.G.A. is standing on a castle turret, awaiting all challengers to come and lay claim to the throne he is currently occupying. The gauntlet has been thrown down. If you call yourself a fan of melodic, well composed, expertly executed and MAJESTIC black metal, then you will do what you must to track this album down for your collection.\n\nGOS: … As well as all the rest of the albums from all of the projects we have been referring to!\n\nFolklore from Further Out is available now via Dark Adversary Productions.\n\n~\n\nPurchase Folklore From Further Out on CD from the Dark Adversary Productions webstore HERE.\n\nSupport AULD RIDGE:\n\nThe Hermetic Order of Ytene Bandcamp\n\n~\n\nFollow Black Metal Daily on Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Bandcamp HERE for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy."
