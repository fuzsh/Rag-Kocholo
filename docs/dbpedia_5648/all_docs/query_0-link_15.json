        "text": "Between April 20-22, Nordic Folk Alliance's second annual showcase festival and conference will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden. It is the largest gathering of the folk music industry and community in the Nordic countries creating a platform for rising stars in the genre to work across the Nordic market and even further afield.\n\nThe festival focuses on acts from the Nordics, and welcomes delegates from all over the world. Four Finnish acts have been chosen to play at the event: Désirée Saarela & Triskel, Frigg, La Riippa Group and Pauanne. Scroll down for videos of all the Finnish showcase acts.\n\nNordic Folk Alliance’s Official Showcases are jury-selected featuring both emerging artists and established touring legends. There is also a conference part where topics like “Is There a Nordic Folk Music Identity?” will be explored as well as themes on Nordic touring, diversity in Nordic folk music and practical seminars on songwriting and sync.\n\n\"We are excited to participate in Nordic Folk Alliance! It's been a long time since our last performance outside Finland and we can’t wait to start touring again. It is extremely important for Nordic bands to have opportunities to showcase their music on international platforms like these. We believe Nordic collaboration should be strengthened especially in uncertain times like these – and we hope opportunities for Nordic folk bands internationally will only grow\", comments Tommi Asplund from Frigg.\n\nThe event's delegation consists of festival and venue bookers, agents, managers, labels, media, and music industry representatives. The curated showcases feature touring and export-ready artists representing a diverse array of folk genres including Nordic Folk, Global Roots, Americana, Indie-Folk, Indigenous Music, Traditional, Singer-songwriter, Spoken Word, and every imaginable fusion.\n\nNordic Folk Alliance is organised by Förvaltningen för Kulturutveckling Västra Götaland and NOMEX, the collaborative platform of the Nordic Export Offices: Music Norway, Export Music Sweden, Music Finland, Iceland Music and Tempi.\n\nSee all the showcase acts at Nordic Folk Alliance's website.\n\n."
