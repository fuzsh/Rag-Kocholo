        "text": "They shut the road through the woods Seventy years ago. Weather and rain have undone it again, And now you will never know There was once a road through the woods Before they planted the trees. It is underneath the coppice and heath, And the thin anemones. Only the keeper sees That, where the ring-dove broods, And the badgers roll with ease, That there was once a road through the woods. Yet, if you enter the woods Of a summer evening late, Where the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools Where the otter whistles his mate They fear not the men in the woods Because they see so few, You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet And the swish of a skirt in the dew. Steadily cantering through The misty solitudes, As though they perfectly knew The old lost road through the woods But there is no road through the woods"
