        "text": "Noveria - Aequilibrium (2019) 8.5/10\n\nMy reference in the Progressive Power Metal subgenre is Symphony X from USA, but when refering to country, it must be Italy, with bands like DGM, Secret Sphere, Vision Divine and... Noveria. After two albums, in 2014 and 2016, Aequilibrium is definitively the confirmation in this hard kind of music. Great solos, addictive melodies with keyboard support, efficient rhythms, an excellent vocalist and no boring lines are the ingredients needed, and Noveria applies them all. It's not a surprise that all members, except the vocalist, play in other bands, like DGM (bass) and Ethernity (guitars and keyboards). This album is full of subtle details, gets better everytime it is heard.\n\nNoveria Facebook\n\nNOVERIA - Broken (Official Video)\n\nBlind\n\nAntonello Giliberto - The Strategy Of Chaos (2019) 8.5/10\n\nMany years ago, I liked a lot Yngwie Malmsteen, Vinnie Moore and other guitar heros, and still own and enjoy their first albums. So when I received a contact from Antonello Giliberto to review the album, after a brief search of course I accepted. He is an italian guitar player, and besides their solo works, also a composer and educator. There are many fast and virtuous guitar players, but feeling and skills to compose good and remarkable songs is not for everyone. But mr. Giliberto's compositions got it. Influenced by the classics, the instrumental songs are either fast (some power) or melancholic, but all have a proper sentiment. The Strategy Of Chaos, his third album, includes collaboration from other skilled musicians, and is a must to all Neoclassical Metal fans.\n\nAntonello Giliberto Facebook\n\nForgotten Mists\n\nSecrets from the Past\n\nÐÑÐ¸Ñ - ÐÐ¾ÑÑÑ Ð¸Ð· ÑÐ°ÑÑÑÐ²Ð° ÑÐµÐ½ÐµÐ¹ [Aria - Guest From The Shadow King, Live] (2019) 9/10\n\nSome months ago I reviewed here Aria's last studio album \"Curse Of The Seas\". Being quite unknown outside Russia, the situation is changing fast and the band got invitations to some european festivals, like Keep It True. Now they released a DVD + 2 CD with the full pharaonic show recorded in Moscow, April 2019. And this band really loves live shows, this being the third release in 3 years. With an excellent setlist of 18 songs, lengthing for 2 hours, quite good players and vocalist, a Metal party is assured. But Aria wanted more, so they got a huge visual show, one of the largest I've ever seen: a 3 level stage, 9 meters LED screens, a \"ghost ship\" floating platform, a suspended system for the vocalist and many other effects. The music, perfectly recorded, is among the best Heavy Metal actually made, of course sung in Russian.\n\nAria Facebook\n\nÐÑÐ¸Ñ - ÐÑÐ¾ÐºÐ»ÑÑÑÐµ Ð¼Ð¾ÑÐµÐ¹ (LIVE, 30.04.2019)\n\nStone Sovereign - Tales of Myth & Madness (2019) 7.5/10\n\nStone Sovereign hails from the far away Australia. They started in 2013 with the name Tomes of Ruin, released 2 EPs and, in 2016, adopted the current name. After an homoninous EP, here is the first album. The music is a reasonable Melodic Death, viking tinted, with some Folk. Not too original, but the aussies succeeded to make an entertaining album. Vocalist Jordan Giblett has a proper way of singing, midway to talking, but fits in the music. In my oppinion, the mixing could be better. Favorite songs: Across The Boiling See and Children Of The Old Gods. Overall it is a good album, give it a listening!\n\nStone Sovereign Facebook\n\nStone Sovereign - Across the Boiling Sea\n\nChildren of the Old Gods\n\nWaylander - ÃriÃº's Wheel (2019) 8.5/10\n\nOne of the best representatives of Celtic Folk Metal is back. Waylander comes from Northern Ireland and their celtic influences and pagan roots are well impregnated into their music. By conjugating folk instruments, most of the time whistle but also mandolin, with extreme music and aggressive vocals, it seems we are transported to a dense forest and attend a pagan ritual. Seven years after the good Kindred Spirits, ÃriÃº's Wheel maintains the same level. Just a curiosity, ÃriÃº is a matron goddess of Ireland, and where the country name came. Being quite homogeneous and without weak parts, I will highlight Beltime, As The Sun Stands Still and Autumnal Blaze. And it's an awesome live band, if you can, don't loose a show.\n\nWaylander Facebook\n\nWAYLANDER - Autumnal Blaze (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)\n\nLemuria - The Hysterical Hunt (2019) 9/10\n\nHere it is another band coming from a long time of inactivity, in this case 9 years. Lemuria is a Belgian quintet that plays a good symphonic Black Metal with some Folk and Heavy elements. The Hysterical Hunt is the third album and the major impression are the majestic orchestrations, maybe exaggerated to the detriment of guitars and rhythm section. Some spoken parts give a cinematic effect and defines the album conception on a XVIII century tale of werewolves. Anyway, the overall album is a good surprise, I may suggest a mix of Dimmu Borgir, Stormlord, Bal-Sagoth, even with some Wintersun orchestrations. Alexandra Kastrinakis, Daedric Tales vocal, is a guest in some songs including the beautiful folk song that ends the album. Another band highly recommended to see alive, as I have done a month ago in Zaragoza.\n\nLemuria Facebook\n\nLEMURIA - A Plague Upon The Land (Official Video)\n\nLEMURIA - Deceptive Hibernation (Lyric Video)\n\nSalduie - Viros Veramos (2019) 9/10\n\nSpain has a great tradition on Folk Metal with many trilling bands. And Salduie for sure is one of the best representatives. Viros Veramos is the third album, a conceptual album about the Iberian resistance against the Roman Empire, led by Sertorio (nice to remember some of our History). There is even a song named Viriato, dedicated to the Lusitanian resistance ☺ Musically, all songs are excellent, mixing the folk instruments (bagpipe, flute, tin whistle) with good guitars, bass, drums and keyboards. I love the parts when all instruments stop, then the tin whistle leads just with drums. By using several voices, clean and harsh, the story gains another dimension. An ambitious album totally achieved. If you can, don't miss their live shows, I already saw them twice!\n\nSalduie Facebook\n\nR.T.N.P. (Roma Traditoribus Non Praemiat) - Videoclip Oficial, SALDUIE (VIROS VERAMOS, 2019)\n\nViriato - SALDUIE (VIROS VERAMOS, 2019) - con MIGUE FRANCO (SAUROM)\n\nExcalion - Emotions (2019) 8.5/10\n\nFor those who like the Finnish Power Metal scene with keyboards, like Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, you have to consider this band. Existing since 2000, Emotions is only the fifth album, mainly due to a long period, between 2010 and 2017, without news. As the previous Dream Alive, two years ago, all songs of the album are very well constructed and praise the most melodic branch of Power Metal, with good leads, efficient rhythms, appealing keyboard parts and an excellent job on vocals. Efficient mixing and mastering by Simone Mularoni (from the Prog Power Italian band DGM). As Sonata Arctica is going pop, this is definitely a band to look at. A tour with the opening by the portuguese Waterland would be great ☺\n\nExcalion Facebook\n\nEXCALION - Trust (Official Video)\n\nEXCALION - Sunshine Path (Lyric Video)\n\nElvenking - Reader of the Runes - Divination (2019) 9/10\n\nAfter the excellent Secrets of the Magick Grimoire (2017), the Italian kings of Folk Power Metal are back with a new anticipated album. Reader of the Runes - Divination is the first chapter of a series based on the Reader of the Runes story, a mystical figure that reads the future on rune stones and magical cards. Each of the songs is based on a Tarot card (by the way, beautiful set included in the boxset), reminding what the Portuguese Heavenwood made with The Tarot of the Bohemians. Musically, it's an excellent album of Power Metal, maybe a little darker than its precedent, quite melodic, where the violin and Damna's vocals immediatly identifies the band. Very looking forward to see Elvenking again later this year!\n\nElvenking Facebook\n\nELVENKING - Silverseal (2019) // Official Music Video // AFM Records\n\nELVENKING - Divination (2019) // Official Music Video // AFM Records\n\nFinsterforst - Zerfall (2019) 10/10\n\nI'm in huge trouble to ellect the best album of 2019, this being one of the best Metal years ever. For sure this album is a serious candidate! Four years after the excellent Mach Dich Frei, and after the less serious and funny #Y0L0 ep, Zerfall is a majestic monument of Folk Post Black Metal. Only with 5 songs, but lasting for almost 80 minutes, the Black Forest Germans even surpasses the previous album. Songs with 13, 11 or even 37 minutes (the magnificent Ecce Homo) boring and repetitive? Not here, for sure! The music flows easily with no weak parts. Despite not having a permanent accordionist since 2016, this instrument still is used often. If in the past they were named as Moonsorrow's followers, since Rastlos (7 years ago) the paths diverged and now in my oppinion Finsterforst is far superior. Mandatory audition and headbanging!\n\nFinsterforst Facebook\n\nFINSTERFORST - Zerfall (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nFINSTERFORST - Fluch des Seins (Short Version) (Official Lyric Video) | Napalm Records\n\nFreedom Call - M.E.T.A.L. (2019) 9/10\n\nReady for another dosage of Happy Power Metal? Three years after the excellent Master of Light, the friendly germans, celebrating 20 years, are back with another bunch of Metal Hymns. With 2 new members, Francesco Ferraro on bass (also Vexillum) and Tim Breideband on drums (ex-Bonfire), the sound doesn't change a bit. Curious how the new drummer will be alive, not expecting the energy of the former drummer Ramy Ali. Wait, Mr. Dan Zimmermann, the first drummer, is guest in \"M.E.T.A.L.\" and \"Sail Away\". The lyrics are all about positive vibes and Metal glorification, and, if things aren't good, play the \"Ace of the Unicorn\", card actually included in the limited edition box, with other excellent goodies. Not original, but maintaining the same high level of the previous albums, and another silly drawing cover as the last one ☺\n\nFreedom Call Facebook\n\nFREEDOM CALL - \"M.E.T.A.L.\" (Official Video)\n\nFREEDOM CALL \"111\" (Official Video)\n\nEquilibrium - Renegades (2019) 7/10\n\nOpinions diverge a lot on Equilibrium's new album, once my top band, several years ago. No one can claim that RenÃ© Berthiaume doesn't innovate and is afraid of experiencing new sounds. Three years after the excellent Armageddon (remember Born to be Epic?) here is even a more diverse album. Maintaining some epic sound identity, we also get some clean modern-type vocals, lots of metalcore, oriental mood (Kawaakari - The Periphery Of The Mind), rap (boy, I have to jump Path of Destiny), and no Folk at all. There are a couple decent songs, starting with the first one, but, for a guy that doesn't support metalcore, most album is soon forgettable. Kudos for RenÃ©'s courage and honesty, but I wonder how many of these songs will be on a future setlist! Ah, and the limited edition has the same songs on 8-bit, completely useless. Miss the old sound? Follow Atlas Pain!\n\nEquilibrium Facebook\n\nEQUILIBRIUM - Renegades - A Lost Generation (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nEQUILIBRIUM - Final Tear (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)\n\nHammerFall - Dominion (2019) 9/10\n\nIn the lates 1990's, Hammerfall was one of the main responsibles for restoring the traditional values of Heavy and Power Metal with the historical debut Glory to the Brave. The crusaders are now back with their eleventh full-length, three years after the good Built to Last. The formula is explored perfectly, with melodic speed, catchy choruses, ready-to-play-live refrains, the high pitched vocals of Joacim Cans, great guitar riffs and solid rhythm section. Starting with the strongest Never Forgive, Never Forget, there are 12 perfectly chained songs, including two expected slows. All songs have something to notice, but One Against The World (some Iron Maiden?) and the first one are my top. Excellent production, especially the guitars sound.\n\nHammerFall Facebook\n\nHAMMERFALL - Dominion (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nHAMMERFALL - One Against The World (Official Live Video) | Napalm Records\n\nAstralium - Land of Eternal Dreams (2019) 9/10\n\nFrom the Land of Eternal... Symphonic Metal Bands, also known as Italy, here comes a new one. Astralium used to be known as Black Roses, was founded by Giuseppe Pappalardo and his daughter Roberta. In 2014 they changed the name to Astralium, but only now they released the first work. And this is a quite strong debut album, with symphonic, power, some progressive, some theatrical dark and full of orchestrations and choirs. The maturation of all songs and their care on arrangements are very evident, but I have to highlight the excellent and flexible Roberta's vocals. Another band? There's always plenty of room for good Metal. The many fans of Nightwish should check this.\n\nAstralium Facebook\n\nASTRALIUM - The Journey (Official Music Video)\n\nASTRALIUM - Rising Waves From The Ocean (Official Lyric Video) feat. Tommy Johansson\n\nDreams in Fragments - Reflections of a Nightmare (2019) 6.5/10\n\nDreams in Fragments is a new symphonic gothic band coming from a small swiss town, Reflections of a Nightmare being the first album. The band is composed by experienced musicians and a female vocalist. The main reference is indeed Seraina SchÃ¶pfer, whose vocals is simultaneously, delicate and strong, flexible and melodic. Almost all musics have a midtempo registry with permanent orchestrations, several keyboard parts, efficient but getting a little flat. As references I may point to Tarja and Delain. A strange note, an instrumental song called Prologue, an interesting small instrumental piece; I would expected this to be at the beginning of the record.\n\nDreams in Fragments Facebook\n\nDREAMS IN FRAGMENTS - Nightchild (Official Lyric Video)\n\nElkir - EP 2019 (2019) 8.5/10\n\nAnother recent finding, Elkir is a recent Folk Metal band from Italy. Being surprised by their quality and digging a little, the band was born in 2016 in Milan, the first single was released in May 2018 and they are active in the Nord Italy underground, playing with Atlas Pain, Blodiga Skald, Kanseil and others. Recently they released this first 21 minutes EP with five songs. The band is composed by 7 members, including flute, violin and keyboards, and, on top, the excellent vocalizations of Francesca. The music is a good Folk with a celtic accent, quite well played. If you like Eluveitie without the harsh male vocals, you have to check this band, I foresee a brilliant future for them.\n\nElkir Facebook\n\nELKIR - I Will Return (Official Studio Video)\n\nELKIR - Faun Dance (Official Track)\n\nVagrant - The Rise Of Norn (2019) 8.5/10\n\nA good surprise. Vagrant is a new German band, born in 2016, that plays Melodic Death Metal with epic proportions. Composed by a trio of quite young members, with The Rise of Norn the band created quite an impressive debut. Stanley Robertson's guitars and music provide catchy melodies and solos that stay in your head, well complemented by Dragnier's vocals and lyrics and Arnaud's bass. Some acoustics and folk add subtle details that enriches the composition. The only defect is the length, 34 minutes. Favorite songs: the videos below. If you like melodic songs with intricate solos and emotive vocals, like Insomnium or Aephanemer, you have to hear these brothers!\n\nVagrant Facebook\n\nVAGRANT - Spirit Of Valor (OFFICIAL PLAY-THROUGH)\n\nVAGRANT - Darkness During The Reign Of A Black Sun (OFFICIAL Audio)\n\nSinheresy - Out of Connection (2019) 7/10\n\nSinheresy is an italian band that plays symphonic melodic Metal with a modern accent. On the tradition of Lacuna Coil, the main characteristic is the vocals duet between the excellent Cecilia Petrini and the efficient Stefano Sain, but the music is closer to Within Temptation and Amaranthe. Out of Connection is the third album, this time mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen (Volbeat and Amaranthe). It's an easy album to listen, well played and sung, adequate for summer, sometimes with a pop feeling thus allowing to expand outside Metal hordes. Very curious to see the band alive next November, on an iberian tour with Brainstorm.\n\nSinheresy Facebook\n\nSINHERESY - Out of Connection (Official Video)\n\nSINHERESY - Zero One (Official Video)\n\nWormwood - Nattarvet (2019) 10/10\n\nWith the release of the almost perfect first album, back in 2017 and reviewed on these pages, Wormwood surprised the Metal world with their Melodic Black impregnated of many other styles. So, when hearing that a new album is coming, the expectation was very high. And the result even surpassed. Nattarvet is a mix of exquisite emotions, containing seven songs full of variations and where vocals and all instruments fit like a clock The solos and tremolo guitar frequently breaks in atmospheric and folk moments, like calm after the storm. The lyrics, most in Swedish, got inspiration in an old local hunger period. For sure one of the best albums of the year from one of my top bands! Surprisingly, Metal Happiness is completed, they are playing in Portugal the 10th August, to an unmissable show at Vagos Metal Fest ☺\n\nWormwood Facebook\n\nWormwood - The Isolationist (Lyric Music Video)\n\nWormwood - Av lie och bÃ¶rda (Official Music Video)\n\nCeltian - En Tierra de Hadas (2019) 8.5/10\n\nWhen talking about Folk Metal, for sure Spain is a reference, being Mago de Oz and Saurom their major ambassadors. Celtian is a new band created by Diego Palacio (ex-Mago de Oz). After an instrumental album in 2017, Xana Lavey entered the band as female vocal and by the end of 2018 a stable line-up has been achieved. En Tierra de Hadas is the second album and the result is quite good. The music is pure symphonic folk, drinking influences from Mago de Oz and Nightwish, quite melodic and where the crystal clear voice is well supported by experienced musicians. Of course violins, whistles and bagpipes play here an important role. It's quite an homogenous album, hard to point out any song. Many guests participate (Mago de Oz, Debler and Eluveitie) and good production from Txus di Fellatio (Mago de Oz).\n\nCeltian Facebook\n\nCELTIAN \"Niamh\" (Videoclip)\n\nCELTIAN \"Tu Hechizo\" (VÃ­deo-lyric)\n\nSynlakross - Malice Murder (2018) 8/10\n\nNu Metal and Metalcore tell me nothing, so the first time I heard Synlakross (2013?), despite being primarily a Melo Death band, I was not impressed. But knowing that this Spanish band is coming to play in Portugal by the end of the year, let's give this last album a careful listening. Fronted by the extremely versatile Patricia Pons, with a wide vocal range capable of, in a matter of seconds, going from clean singing to growls, whispers or screams. The music is a technical Melodic Death but incorporating elementos of Nu Metal, Metalcore and Groove, resulting quite energetic, theatrical and original. Imagine a mix of early Arch Enemy with recent In Flames and a bit of Butcher Babies. Patricia is also a great designer, she drew the album cover. For sure it will be a hell of a show, very looking forward!\n\nSynlakross Facebook\n\nSYNLAKROSS - Dark Seed (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nSYNLAKROSS - Fatal Frame (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nAlien Weaponry - Tu (2018) 9/10\n\nIs Heavy Metal exhausted? Far from that, quite alive and healthy, with such new acts like Alien Weaponry! This quite young trio comes from New Zealand and plays an energetic and original Thrash Groove with a Maori tribal accent. There is no need for special effects, just plain incisive guitars and thunderous bass/drums, often breaked with melodic clean singing parts. Tu is the first album and what a debut it is. Heavily based on the Maori traditions and history, due to the members family roots, half the lyrics are in Te Reo, the Maori endangered language. This, together with tribal choruses and beats, gives an extra dose of originality, but never loosing simplicity and strength. And don't you dare to loose a show and to do Haka with the band!\n\nAlien Weaponry Facebook\n\nALIEN WEAPONRY - Kai Tangata (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nALIEN WEAPONRY - Ahi Ka (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nDeath Divine - The Oracle (2019) 8.5/10\n\nDeath Divine is a solo project from Daniel James, also playing in Devil May (Melodic Groove) and Shackled (Hard Rock). I didn't know any of these bands, when I first heard The Oracle. And what a good piece of Melodic Death it is! Meanwhile I checked his first EP and it's more metalcore for my tastes (trivia, it's his real blood on the cover!). But then, Daniel attended a Wintersun show and a whole new story started, well reflected in The Oracle. Starting with the awesome Blind, we are graced with 5 excellent symphonic Melodic Death songs plenty of exquisite solos, followed by a long beautiful piano instrumental. The album ends with Blind and The Oracle's Winter, instrumental versions. Well worth to be checked by all Melodic Death fans and deserved to be better known!\n\nDeath Divine Facebook\n\nBlind\n\nThe Oracle's Winter\n\nGlasya - Heaven's Demise (2019) 9.5/10\n\n2019 is being an awesome year for Metal, also in this far corner of Europe. Glasya is a recent Symphonic Metal band, soon to be one of the most requested not only in Portugal but also outside our borders. Born in 2017 from ex-members of well known bands, and fronted by Eduarda Soeiro, a vocalist also in Nightdream (Nightwish tribute) and vocal teacher. Of course the band's main reference is Nightwish, incorporating keyboards symphonic and melodic elements with the guitars power and scales, following in perfection the excellent vocalizations. All 10 songs of Heaven's Demise are quite elaborated (just check the videos) and even we got a good instrumental closing the album. With such bands like Glasya, I'm proud to be a Portuguese Metalhead! And, fans of Nightwish and Symphonic Metal, check this band and may be surprised!\n\nGlasya Facebook\n\nGlasya - Heaven's Demise\n\nGlasya - Glasya Lyric Video\n\nAktarum - Ragnatroll (2018) 9/10\n\nTrolls, trolls and more trolls. When speaking about these creatures, immediatly Aktarum comes to my mind ☺ By the end of last year, this Belgian Folk Metal band released their second album and the main subjet is, guess... trolls of course. Musically, this is a good album, an excellent evolution since the first album 8 years ago, varied, with some Black traces but mainly funny and addictive Folk Metal. Still unsigned, for sure they deserve a better recognition and be among the European top Folk bands. I never saw them alive, but hopefully I will someday, great party assured, and let's enter the Troll circle pit.\n\nAktarum Facebook\n\nAKTARUM - Trolls In The Fog [Official Live Video]\n\nAktarum - Party Troll [Lyric Video]\n\nNevalra - Conjure the Storm (2019) 8.5/10\n\nIf it wasn't by this relatively young band opening for Wolfheart & Carach Angren Euro tour, probably it would slide under my radar. With so many daily Metal releases, normally I don't check bands whose genre is Blackened Death Metal. But the show in Lisbon had a quite good sound and Nevalra's quality was revealed. Their first album was released a couple days before the tour starts, got it signed and here is the review. And it's a good debut, quite melodic, very technical and with a great guitar work. Scott Eames, the mastermind, composes, sings and plays guitars (also live guitars in Thy Antichrist). No slows or midtempo songs here, my favorite songs are the two videos below, quite adictive. Andres Vargas (Thy Antichrist vocals) sings on the first one. We are going for sure to hear much more about Scott and Nevalra.\n\nNevalra Facebook\n\nNEVALRA - Conjure the Storm (Official Animated Video)\n\nNEVALRA - âIt Dies In Vainâ (Official Music Video)\n\nDiviner - Realms of Time (2019) 9/10\n\nDiviner is a Heavy Power Metal band from Greece that for sure is going to be one of the top Greek Metal bands. After the excellent Fallens Empire first album, in 2015, here is the second chapter. The immediate attention is caught by the powerfull vocals of Yiannis Papanikolaou, quite similar to Dio or Ronnie Romero (Rainbow, ex-Lords of Black). But the vocalist himself doesn't make the band and must be supported by efficient musicians and catchy melodies. And that's the case: good Heavy Metal, great guitar lines and good drums/bass support. Without many concerts abroad, this masterpiece should open doors all around the world. Let's hope Portugal or Spain could be included.\n\nDiviner Facebook\n\nDiviner - Heaven Falls [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]\n\nDiviner - Beyond The Border [OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO]\n\nEnchantya - On Light and Wrath (2019) 9/10\n\nEnchantya are back, seven years after the excellent Dark Rising's debut. In between, so many changes happened, but Rute Fevereiro's strength and its love to Metal took Enchantya to a new level. Her versatile vocal abilities, including easy changes between growl, clean, soprano and spoken, are very well supported by excellent players. Musically speaking, we are grateful by a diverse Gothic Symphonic Metal, with excellent orchestrations and great melodies, where all guitars, keyboard, some violin and choirs are meticulously coordinated. Without neglecting the other songs, I may highlight the emotive Deception (love the vocals and solo) and the single The Beginning. In the Gothic genre, one of the best worldwide albums of the year, for sure, that will bring deserved notoriety to this Portuguese band.\n\nEnchantya Facebook\n\nEnchantya - The Beginning (Official music video)\n\nDeception\n\nMoonlight Haze - De Rerum Natura (2019) 8/10\n\nMoonlight Haze is a new Symphonic Power Metal band founded by the talented and active Chiara Tricarico and Giulio Capone. For those who don't know Miss Tricarico, she also sings in RavenWord and Sound Storm and sung in Temperance and several other projects. The other members are also well known on the Italian metal scene (Elvenking, Teodasia, Overtures, etc). So, besides Chiara's excellent vocal skills, the main trademark of this new band, the music is quite well constructed, extremely melodic and varied. This first album includes guests from Epica, Mayan and Elvenking. Besides the two videos below, I particularly like Dark Corners of Myself (great intro). White smoke, we have band!\n\nMoonlight Haze Facebook\n\nMOONLIGHT HAZE - Ad Astra (Official Video)\n\nMOONLIGHT HAZE - The Butterfly Effect (Lyric Video)\n\nAether - In Embers (2019) 9.5/10\n\nBrutal! Aether is a young Polish band that plays an epic Melodic Death Metal. I reviewed Tale of Fire, their first EP, in 2016, and then an album was highly desirable. So it is now and the promise was fulfilled! Besides the four songs from the EP, In Embers includes five more Melodic Death gems. The strong keyboard presence, the killer riffs, orchestrations and good vocals turns this into a great album. As guests we find members from Stratovarius, Aether Realm, Lux Perpetua and others. Together with Aephanemer, these are the new Wolves of Melodic Death. Complains, again? Sure, just 38 minutes ☺\n\nAether Facebook\n\nAETHER - Forest (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)\n\nAether - Golden Eyed Fox\n\nSpeedemon - Hellcome (2019) 8/10\n\nDo you want old school speed? Fast thrash? Aggressive vocals? Intense riffing? So you have to check this first album from Speedemon. After the promising First Blood EP, back in 2015 (reviewed here), the confirmation arrived now. This still independent Portuguese quartet releases an album that will please Metal fans. From the Ep only Road to Madness was promoted to the album. Besides Atrocity Divine and the homonymous song (both videos below), to note is the Riding Over Skulls instrumental. Not original but quite efficient and headbanging Metal.\n\nSpeedemon Facebook\n\nSPEEDEMON ATROCITY DIVINE\n\nSPEEDEMON\n\nGrimgotts - Dragons of the Ages (2019) 9/10\n\nGrimgotts is a recent band from UK that started in 2015 as a Harry Potter themed parody band but soon shifted to fantasy themes based on sea mosters and nautical subjects. Dragons of the Ages, the second album, is based on a war between dragons, sea creatures and men. The music is Symphonic Power Metal, frequently cinematographic and epic. Of course the first reference coming to mind is Alestorm, but to me, this is far superior and more varied, better vocals and catchier songs (and no silly rubber ducks). Other references may be Rhapsody, Atlas Pain and Mindfeeder (The Great Shadow). A curiosity, the bass player, Nelson Moreira, is Portuguese. A quite good and engaging album.\n\nGrimgotts Facebook\n\nGrimgotts - The King Under the Sea\n\nGrimgotts - The Last Dragon Warriors\n\nMÃ¥negarm - Fornaldarsagor (2019) 9.5/10\n\nHere it is a band that is getting better on each album. The Swedish trio delivers another monument of solid Viking Folk Metal, with some traces of Black still coming from their origins. The whole album is imponent, epic, plenty of choirs, great riffs and the recognizable Erik GrawsiÃ¶ vocals, perfectly mixing growls and clean. All lyrics are in the native language. Besides the two songs on the videos below, I may highlight the epic Tvenne DrÃ¶mmar and the emotive acoustic DÃ¶dskvÃ¤det. The awesome limited edition includes two bonus songs, one being the timeless (Don't need) Religion Motorhead cover. One of the best albums of the year!\n\nMÃ¥negarm Facebook\n\nMANEGARM - Ett sista farvÃ¤l (Official Lyric Video) | Napalm Records\n\nMANEGARM - Hervors arv (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nMunarheim - Willens & frei (2019) 9.5/10\n\nFour years after the excellent Stolzes Wesen Mensch, here is the third full-length of one of the best Symphonic Folk Metal bands around. The nine members deliver a solid album with plenty of good Metal, pompous orchestrations, flutes, acoustic moments, whistles,... In two words: beautiful music. Being quite original, some slight influences of Equilibrium and Haggard may be traced. And Robse (Equilibrium vocals) is a guest on Vergebung. Of course an expected event is Munaheim's limited edition. Again a beautiful one, limited to 200, includes, besides the CD, a 56 page book, a download card for all five editions, a signed photo and 4 seeds of Ginko tree, all in a cloth bag. Another band in my have-to-see list!\n\nMunarheim Facebook\n\nMunarheim - Vergebung\n\nMunarheim - Dein ist der Tag\n\nMeadows End - The Grand Antiquation (2019) 8.5/10\n\nMeadows End comes from Sweden and they play on the same league as Insomnium or Omnium Gatherum, that is Melodic Death. While not so well known, this fourth album will provide for sure a rise in the rank. More symphonic than the above mentioned bands, The Grand Antiquation surprised me for the melodies and orchestrations, where the first videos (below), quite well chosen, are great MDM hymns. Also to be noticed is the inclusion of two songs in Swedish. I'm sure we are going to hear much more about this band!\n\nMeadows End Facebook\n\nMEADOWS END - Non-Dreaming Eye (Official Video)\n\nMEADOWS END - Svept i SorgeplÃ¤d (Official Video)\n\nHaeredium - Ascension (2019) 9.5/10\n\nAnother excellent surprise. Haeredium comes from France and they play the most varied Folk Power Metal I've ever heard, and extremely melodic. This band, supporting Freedom Call, would be the most epic Happy Metal concert ever. After a quite good first album Aurora, in 2014, here is a new album, even better. The beautiful whistle intro previews what is coming, confirmed by the powerful Breathe. I just love he way they conjugate guitars and keyboards with millimetric inputs and crossed references to classics, french music, southern and others. The incorporation of flute, mandolin, piano, violin, ukulele adds extra layers of melody. SÃ©bastian warm vocals are perfect, as well as backing vocals, both male and female. Another band that I'd love to see alive, party assured. TrÃ¨s bien, mes amis!\n\nHaeredium Facebook\n\nHaeredium - Breathe (Official Video)\n\nHaeredium - Merchant Of Lies (Official Lyric Video)\n\nAmon Amarth - Berserker (2019) 9/10\n\nBefore the release, I was wandering if this could be the album of the year, as I'm a long time Amon Amarth fan. The unmistakable Melodic Death is present in all songs, the vikings theme is also there, but they played on the safe side, repeating the formula that lead them to one of the best Metal bands around. I feel drums are not as strong as they used to be (mix ou new drummer?). By lightening a bit the weight, and introducing subtle variations (piano, a few clean singing parts) Amon Amarth probably will even enlarge their fan base. Not as good as I expected but still quite entertaining and several songs will be great alive (for sure Crack the Sky), but I doubt that anyone will remain on the set list of a concert 10 years from now. Favorite song: Valkyria.\n\nAmon Amarth Facebook\n\nAmon Amarth - Crack the Sky\n\nAmon Amarth - Raven's Flight\n\nKull - Exile (2019) 8.5/10\n\nNow there's a band that I haven't heard for a long time. Wait... It's not Bal-Sagoth! Or better, it's Bal-Sagoth with a new name and a new vocal. Some history: since The Chthonic Chronicles (2006) the band are on hold and Byron, the charismatic vocalist, is more interested in writing short fantasy tales. Then, the four remaining members, including the Maudling brothers, got Tarkan as vocals (Dyscaphiaâs guitars), and Kull is born. The music? Epic Symphonic Black Metal like a refreshing Bal-Sagoth, with intricate and elaborated songs where keys and guitars alternate in supporting the excellent vocalizations, sung and spoken. Fave song is Hordes Ride. A quite good surprise and a cool album!\n\nKull Facebook\n\nKULL - A Summoning to War (Official Audio)\n\nKULL - VOW OF THE EXILED (official track 2019)\n\nAegonia - The Forgotten Song (2019) 7.5/10\n\nAegonia comes from Bulgaria, a country that I love and that visited 4 or 5 times. They started in 2011 with the first album was released last April. The band genre can be confusing as they mix many influences: doom, gothic, atmospheric, melodic death, fantasy metal and folk. I may create a new one ☺: Melancholic Nature Metal. Of course the major influence is the rich Balkan folklore. The most remarkable aspect is the clean vocals and violin of Elitsa Stoyanova, adorned in parts by acoustic guitars, flute, riffs and some growls. The songs tell a fantasy story written by the front singer. Interesting and original project. I just wonder why the video single was not included in the album.\n\nAegonia Facebook\n\nAEGONIA - The Maid And The Mountain [OFFICIAL VIDEO]\n\nThe Stolen Song\n\nSechem - Disputes With My Ba (2018) 8.5/10\n\nA Spanish Middle Eastern Folk Metal? Looks promising, let's check! Sechem comes from Madrid, was born in 2010 and this is the first full-length, after one EP in 2016. The music is quite original, a mix of Folk, Power and Symphonic, always with an oriental feeling, and the exoticism of a kind of oriental flute. Yossi Sassi (Orphaned Land's mastermind) is like the band's godfather. Sechem played the supporting act of the Yossi Sassi Band during the Roots and Roads European Tour (with two dates in Portugal, that I missed), and Disputes With My Ba was produced by Yossi Sassi, mixed and mastered in Israel. While being an homogeneous album, my fave song is the fast \"An Epic Journey To Yam\".\n\nSechem Facebook\n\nSechem - An Epic Journey To Yam (feat. Yossi Sassi)\n\nSechem - Horus & Seth (Official Video)\n\nStormlord - Far (2019) 9.5/10\n\nWow, was my reaction when receiving the invitation to review Stormlord. For a long time I haven't heard about one of my favorite Italian bands, first album Supreme Art of War bought 20 years ago! The Romans play a proper type of extreme epic metal, quite symphonic, sometimes black, but always melodic and with perfect constructions. Beyond this, the omnipresent background orchestrations add a cinematographic effect, sometimes remembering Bal-Sagoth but better. Album mastered by Simone Mularoni (DGM). There are no weak songs, however my fave songs are the beautiful Far, Cimmeria (based on Conan the Barbarian), Invictus and Levante. Another band that I must see alive!\n\nStormlord Facebook\n\nSTORMLORD - Leviathan (Lyric Video)\n\nSTORMLORD - Far (Lyric Video)\n\nMy Enchantment - Saligia (2019) 9/10\n\nThere are albums hard to born, but when they finally are released, BANG! Saligia, the second full-length, 14 years after the first one, started to be composed in 2015, with recordings begining in 2016. But the wait was worth it! The ambitious inspiration was Inferno's Dante and the album is composed by an intro, outro and, inbetween, seven songs each dedicated to a capital sin. With this new chapter, the band also changed its visual, now with theatrical white masks. The music is an elaborated symphonic Melodic Death, plenty of variations, where keyboards play an important role on the backgound layer. While an audition in sequence is mandatory, my fave song is Canto IV, dedicated to Hate. A Portuguese band and an album not to be missed!\n\nMy Enchantment Facebook\n\nMy Enchantment - Canto II Avaretia ( Official Audio Track) from the album Saligia\n\nMy Enchantment - Canto VI Ira ( Official Audio Track) from new album Saligia\n\nDallian - Automata (2018) 9/10\n\nWhat an excellent debut album! Dallian is a portuguese new band, that plays an original Progressive Symphonic Death Metal, unexpectadly matured attending to the youth of the band and their members age. The more than 60 minutes of Automata include ellaborated orchestrations, acoustic guitars reporting different cultures (awesome intro), different choirs, some fado, and many diverse surprising moments. As references we may notice in some short parts Septicflesh, Moonspell and even Orphaned Land. The music is completed with a steampunk aesthetics and lyrics related to the occult and human conflict. And the curiosity of the family members support on choirs and clean vocals. A new band with a bright future!\n\nDallian Facebook\n\nSatori\n\nCaixa PensatÃ³ria\n\nBloodbound - Rise of the Dragon Empire (2019) 9/10\n\nThe swedish masters of Fantasy Power Metal are back! If you mix Sabaton and Hammerfall, add some Freedom Call Happy Metal and the Dragons fantasy theme of Rhapsody you'll get a good idea about Bloodbound. Rise of the Dragon Empire, the 8th album of originals, maintains the Dragon's theme, getting some ideas from the magnificent Game of Thrones. Musically, we get eleven average-length themes, all good, plenty of melody and orchestrations, with good riffs adorning the efficient Patrik Selleby vocals. I just would prefer some more guitar in the mix. This is a huge miss in the bands that I have seen alive, hope to solve it soon!\n\nBloodbound Facebook\n\nBLOODBOUND - Rise Of The Dragon Empire (2019) // Official Music Video // AFM Records\n\nBLOODBOUND - Slayer Of Kings (2019) // Official Audio Video // AFM Records\n\nBuzzocracy - Metamorphosis (2019) 8.5/10\n\nHere is an excellent surprise coming from Portugal! Buzzocracy was born in 2016 in Porto and Metamorphosis is the first opus. While described, and well, as Progressive Death Metal, this is technical as hell. Normally I'm more on the melodic side of Death, but hearing these addictive riffs and aggressive vocals with attention, for moments I forgot my work and started headbanging ☺. Being a conceptual album about a transformation story on old Egypt, each song has its own moments. Definitively one more recent band to follow. And great cover!\n\nBuzzocracy Facebook\n\nBUZZOCRACY - God of Egypt (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nBUZZOCRACY - Bringer Of Despair (Live Metalpoint 04-12-2018)\n\nRhapsody Of Fire - The Eight Mountain (2019) 9.5/10\n\nI followed the Dragonflame since the begining. The flame faded a little with the bad influence of Joey DeMaio, Luca Turilli's departure in 2011 and Fabio Lione in 2016. But then master Alex Staropoli was successful in reuniting an efficient lineup, now on full potential with this new album. Starting a new saga, the Nephilim Empire, all the ingredients that made them the best symphonic power metal band are there: pompous and epic, fast and emotive, great hymns and some good surprises (that speech on the long Tales of a Hero's Fate). Excellent performance from all members and awesome vocals. So happy they are playing in August in Portugal, a show that can't be missed!\n\nRhapsody of Fire Facebook\n\nRHAPSODY OF FIRE â Rain Of Fury (2019) // Official Music Video // AFM Records\n\nRHAPSODY OF FIRE â Master Of Peace (2019) // Official Lyric Video // AFM Records\n\nAntologi - Berjuang (2018) 7.5/10\n\nWith Internet there are no boundaries for Metal knowledge! And it's time to go to Far East, to Singapore, also known as a fine country (double meaning intended ☺). While not being on the Metal radar, from Singapore I may recall Across The Abyss or Coup The Grace. And Antologi now belongs to my country references. Despite existing since 2009, Berjuang is the second album. Playing a mix of Thrash and Technical Death, some songs in english others in malay, the result is a varied short 30 minutes album, but with many headbanging moments, like my favorite Thrashing in Chaos. Check and be surprised!\n\nAntologi Facebook\n\nANTOLOGI - THRASHIN' IN CHAOS (2018) OFFICIAL VIDEO CHAOS MV\n\nANTOLOGI - DELUSIONS OF MAYHEM (2018) - OFFICIAL MV\n\nInvictus - Burst the Curse (ep 2019) 8/10\n\nWith such young bands like Invictus, Metal is quite healthy and alive! Invictus started in 2017, a five piece from Germany that gathers the main influence on the golden age of german speed metal. Being a recent band does not mean that their members have no experience, three of them are also on Avator. This EP is the first record of the band and not much to say with only 3 songs and 11 minutes, the title song lasting less than 3 minutes. Anyway this is quite promising, reminding me the mighty Angel Dust, with good riffs and variations, and adequate vocals. For sure a band to follow and let's wait for the first full-length.\n\nInvictus Facebook\n\nBurst the Curse\n\nBlack Therapy - Echoes Of Dying Memories (2019) 8.5/10\n\nAfter an excellent In the Embrace of Sorrow, I Smile, from 2016, I was waiting with anticipation this new work. Black Therapy hails from Rome, started in 2009, with the first album released in 2013. Echoes of Dying Memories is the third album and confirms Black Therapy as one of the best Italian Melo Death bands. The ingredients that we love in Melodic Death are all there: emotion, melodies, variations, great riffs, a good harsh vocals, good production and mixing, and 45 minutes of great music. Asim Searah (Wintersun) gave a contribution on Scars song. If you like Insomnium, you have to check this band, for instance Dreaming (one of the videos below). They deserve for sure to be better known!\n\nBlack Therapy Facebook\n\nBLACK THERAPY - Dreaming (Official Music Video)\n\nBLACK THERAPY - Phoenix Rising (Official LYRIC VIDEO )\n\nRotting Christ - The Heretics (2019) 9/10\n\n13 is only the bad luck number for some, not for these Metal Greek gods with this 13th full-length release. Distant are the years of the Triarchy of the Lost Lovers, my first contact with this veteran band. The music is still Melodic Black but impregnated of symphonic, gothic and classic moments, even some folk. The result is imponent and epic, each of the 10 songs are different, while maintaining the sick Rotting riffs, Sakis vocals and an efficient almost martial drums sound. The album lyrics goes around the heretic subject often including many literature citations and spoken parts. Fave songs are the catchy Heaven and Hell and Fire and The Voice of the Universe, with some arabic parts. Quite good result, looking forward to see the band again, they will embark on tour with Moonspell.\n\nRotting Christ Facebook\n\nRotting Christ - Fire, God and Fear (Official Lyric Video)\n\nRotting Christ-Dies Irae (Official Lyric Video)\n\nWolfheart - Constellation of the Black Light (2018) 9/10\n\nThis week I had the great news that Wolfheart is coming back to Portugal, with Carach Angren, for two shows in June. One and half year after the excellent Tyhjyys (reviewed here), a new proof of Tuomas Saukkonen prolific talent is presented. And we get what it is expected: great midtempo cold Melodic Death with some doom. The album starts with a long 10 minute song, including a three minute almost acoustic intro, well followed by six more good songs, with no rest for the weak! The Saw, one of the official videos and my preferred, is the perfect example of what a Melodic Death song should include. A must to see this year!\n\nWolfheart Facebook\n\nWOLFHEART - The Saw (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nWOLFHEART - Everlasting Fall | Napalm Records\n\nTÃ½r - Hel (2019) 9/10\n\nFinally, a new opus from the most known Viking (and Metal) ambassadors of the Faroe Islands, 6 years after the quite good Valkyrja. TÃ½r is a safe bet band that we can pre-order a new album without hearing a song. And I was not disappointed, on the contrary. A general audition indicates a heavier sound, less folk and an extremely elaborated sound, mixing prog, power and melo death, of course on top the distinctive vocals of Heri Joensen. Among the 13 varied songs, all good, 5 are based on traditional nordic songs, two are sung in Faroese, some melo death rhythms on Gates of Hel, the fast Garmr, the happy hit Far from the Worries of the World (it will be insane played alive) or the surprising Empire of the North. Don't miss TÃ½r on tour, Portugal included at Vagos Metal Fest in August!\n\nTÃ½r Facebook\n\nTÃR \"Sunset Shore\" (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nTÃR \"Ragnars KvÃ¦Ã°i\" (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nAtlas Pain - Tales of a Pathfinder (2019) 10/10\n\nTwo year after the excellent What The Oak Left, and less than one year after their unforgettable show in Portugal (a wall of death at 04.00 am?!), here is a new album of this amazing Italian band. This album, candidate to one of the best in 2019, will for sure bring a large due recognition. The concept is a 1900's steampunk fair show that takes us into strange lands and cultures. While with some layers related to the place of each song, the main genre is a unique cinematographic epic Folk Metal, where some initial Equilibrium and Wintersun influences are now worked on a quite proper and unmistakable style. So, sit down, fasten yous seatbelts and fly around the world on the wings of Tales of a Pathfinder! And superior cover!\n\nAtlas Pain Facebook\n\nATLAS PAIN - The Moving Empire (Lyric Video)\n\nKia Kaha\n\nGates Of Paris - Gates Of Paris (2018) 9/10\n\nEven in Metal, from time to time there are some surprising refreshing projects. This one was created by RÃ©mi Carrairou, guitar and songwriter from Kerion, one of the best Power Metal bands in France. As the name suggests, this project is dedicated to Paris and all songs are based or have specific references to french musics, episodes or other well known Parisian icons (belle epoque, Edith Piaf, cabaret, can can, and so on). Between the classical intro and outro, 10 more songs are presented, all different but all could be classified as symphonic Power Metal. The addition of several excerpts, spoken parts in French, accordion, acoustics, organ, violin and other instruments delivers the original Parisian accent. Raphael Dantas, an excellent vocals, fits perfectly in the project. Also to be noticed several vocal and guitar guests (like Kerion's Flora). The result is excellent! Looking forward to hear a second chapter of Parisian history!\n\nGates of Paris Facebook\n\nGates Of Paris - The Cabaret\n\nGates Of Paris Teaser (Remch Kerion)\n\nFrozen Crown - Crowned In Frost (2019) 9/10\n\nIn early 2018 I reviewed Frozen Crown's first album, one of the best newcomers of the year, and, one year after, a new album is going to be released. Meanwhile they took the Italian and European Power Metal scene by storm and their first video, \"King\", got more than 1.5 million views. Since the first audition on that album, I have foreseen that, with dedication, this band had all the ingredients to be great. And the confirmation is here with Crowned In Frost. Do not be fooled by the delicate and beautiful ladies: Giada is becoming one of the strongest female vocals and Thalia's guitar playing is excellent, despite being only 18 years old. This, together with great songs written by mastermind Federico, who also recorded all guitars and keyboards, make this an outstanding and consistent album. And the best news is that they are playing in Portugal at Milagre Metaleiro, 23rd-24th August ☺\n\nFrozen Crown Facebook\n\nFROZEN CROWN - Neverending (Official Video)\n\nFROZEN CROWN - Kings (Official Video) [from previous album]\n\nKambrium - Dawn of the Five Suns (2018) 9/10\n\nTwo year after the excellent The Elder's Realm, here is the fourth album of this German band that allies a good Melodic Death with Symphonic Power. The symphonic parts are pulled by the keys and plenty of choirs, while harsh vocals emphasize the death parts, clean vocals pull some epic power and riffs alternate between power and melodic death. Anyway the mix is efficient and the result is great. The album concept is about the Aztec and Mayan gods, which leads to the inclusion of some tribal sounds and spoken parts. On the 60 minutes of this work, even if there is no powerful track as the Shattered Illusions hit from the previous album (but some parts approach, thus maintaining the band's brand), headbanging is mandatory. Anyone to bring these Brothers to Portugal? I'd love to see them alive!\n\nKambrium Facebook\n\nKAMBRIUM - Dawn Of The Five Suns (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)\n\nKAMBRIUM - Against All Gods (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)\n\nVarious Artists - Nobilis Metallum, Two Sides of Lusitanian Heaviness (compilation 2018) --/--\n\nNormally I don't review compilations, this is an exception because it relates to portuguese bands, most unknown, and... it's free! But no rating. The mentor is my friend Dico (Eduardo JosÃ© Almeida), long-time Metal fan (almost as long as me ☺), journalist, drummer on several historical bands, author of the sold-out book about the Portuguese Metal History, etc. This compilation is divided into 2 volumes, the first dedicated to Heavy & Melodic bands, and the second to Obscure & Extreme bands. On the first CD, with the exception of Dogma (reviewed some time ago) and Ledderplain, the others didn't attract me, covering a wide spectrum sometimes out of Metal. Now the second CD is much stronger (mainly Death and Black), nice to hear Morbith Death after a long time, the inclusion of Sanctus Nosferatu and Yar, and found other good bands. The compilation objective is fulfilled! If you want to know a wide range on the Lusitanian Metal scene, go ahead and download both CDs! Congratulations Dico!\n\nDico Facebook\n\nCD 1 download (Heavy & Melodic)\n\nCD 2 download (Obscure & Extreme)\n\nPagan Reign - Once Again (2018) 9.5/10\n\nOne excellent surprise by the end of 2018, that only now got my attention. Pagan Reign is a Russian band that started in 1997, released 5 albums but then hibernated for 12 years and just returned with this masterpiece. The style is an epic melodic Pagan Folk Metal with traces of atmospheric Black, and since the first acoustic to the last notes, it's a parade of Metal emotions. The slavic pagan music is interleaved many times with beautiful folk acoustic guitar, mandolin and flute. And impossible for me to highlight songs, it's to hear from begining to end and repeat. Fans of Arkona or Nokturnal Mortum must check this album, it will surpass your expectations. Looking forward for what they are preparing for the current year.\n\nPagan Reign Facebook\n\nPagan Reign â Reborn\n\nPagan Reign â Â«Once AgainÂ» 2018 full album\n\nEndolith - Chicxulub (2019) 7.5/10\n\nBy curiosity, an endolith is an organism that lives inside rocks. My first contact with this norwegian band, still thinking how to classify them. The closest may be progressive extreme Metal but incorporating many other elements like groove, symphonic, thrash, electronic and some clean singing. Chicxulub, subtitled The Fossil Record, is the second album from this three members project and is a concept album based on the extinction of dinosaurs, and how mankind is mirroring the situation with inevitable consequences. While not being an Extreme Metal expert, I may find some Meshuggah influences. But definitively it is a surprising album, demonstrating that Metal has no well defined boundaries. To be noticed the inclusion of the Arctic Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra and guests on timpani and solo viola.\n\nEndolith Facebook\n\nEndolith - Ichthys (official video)\n\nEndolith - Bloodfiends (official video)\n\nHell's Guardian - As Above So Below (2018) 8.5/10\n\nFrom the Italian Metal Armada, here is another good band. Born in 2009, this lombardian quartet released the first album in 2014, followed by an EP in 2015. As Above So Below is the second album and the epic melodic death metal path is maintained with some progressive winking to Amorphis. The addition of some power touches is probably due to the mixing and mastering of Michele Guaitoli (Temperance and Vision of Atlantis). And glad to notice my friend Samuele Faulisi (Atlas Pain) credited for orchestrations. A good album, varied, no weak songs, not exceptional, but quite enjoyable and deserved to be checked.\n\nHell's Guardian Facebook\n\nHELL'S GUARDIAN - Crystal Door (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nHELL'S GUARDIAN - Blood Must Have Blood (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nTriboulet - Quest for Hope (2018) 7/10\n\nChilean Metal is above average, with good bands and some tradition in Heavy Power Metal. Born in 2012, Triboulet released an EP in 2012 and the first album, The March of the Fallen, in 2016. At that time I got a good impression, a good Heavy Power album. At the end of 2018 Quest for Hope was released. This second album tells the story of a group of humans that flew to a new planet leaving behind a very damaged Earth. Musically, this is more experimental, following a progressive path, still melodic, but almost without power. Instrumentally, it is irreproachable, and the new vocalist suits the music. Having to select a song I would choose the fastest one, The Day The Earth Stood Still. Fans of Melodic Progressive Metal should check this one!\n\nTriboulet Facebook\n\nTriboulet - New Horizon (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)\n\nAexylium - Tales From This Land (2018) 8.5/10\n\nWhat an excellent debut. Tales From This Land is the first album from this Italian band that was born in 2014. The music is a good Folk Metal, where keyboards, violins, bagpipes, flutes, are pushed by some power delivered by guitars, bass and drums. The quality reflects the homogeneous eight members lineup (just changed violin player since their start) and the care put in each song. If you like Elvenking, Eluveitie and Alestorm you will find in this album several appealing songs, but also several good less influenced songs with a more personal touch. But I would appreciate lesser influences of Alestorm in Black Flag and Radagast And no fill-in songs, that's great. Just one complain, only 41 minutes. Another band to add to the must-see list!\n\nAexylium Facebook\n\nAEXYLIUM - Tales From Nowhere (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nAEXYLIUM - Revive The Village (Studio Diary Video)\n\nAephanemer - Prokopton (2019) 10/10\n\nStill in the early days of 2019, and already hearing the best album of the year? This will be another awesome year for what is coming, but Aephanemer questionless takes the lead. Starting where the first album Mement Mori left, Prokopton even surpasses its predecessor with 8 of the most epic melodic death metal hymns ever done. Of course the typical Aephanemer's sound is present with the extremely melodic and permanent riffing, a good rhythm section, and, on top, the each time better Marion's vocals. Pointing out songs it's difficult, maybe what surprised me: my favorite Snowblind (some classical music feeling), the instrumental At Eternity's Gate (folk base) and the long epic If I should Dye. To help release such a masterpiece it's not strange the work of Dan Swano (mixing) and Mika Jussila (mastering). Excellent artwork of Niklas Sundin (Dark Tranquillity). Aephanemer should soon be recognized as one of the top Melodic Death Metal bands around. Be careful with permanent headbanging!\n\nAephanemer Facebook\n\nAEPHANEMER - Bloodline (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)\n\nAEPHANEMER - Dissonance Within (OFFICIAL TRACK)\n\nLahmia - Resilience (2019) 9/10\n\nNow that's a band that I haven't heard for a long time. The first album, Into the Abyss, back in 2012, left excellent memories. And in early 2019, here it is the second album, Resilience, named after some difficulties the band felt after the release of the first album. And so glad they didn't ended up. The music is still an appealing Melodic Death with plenty of guitar riffs, melody and the excellent Francesco's vocals. Probably this the Italian band that best follows the so-called Gothenburg sound, and in many parts, also due to the vocals, remind the mighty Amon Amarth. Ah, and mastered at Finnvox Studios by Mikka Jussila (Insomnium, Omnium Gatherum, and many others). One of the songs, The Age of Treason, is an almost 12 minute song, quite interesting. Excellent album!\n\nLahmia Facebook\n\nLAHMIA - Her Frantic Call (Lyric Video)\n\nFuror Gallico - Dusk Of The Ages (2019) 7.5/10\n\nBorn in 2007, Furor Gallico is one of the most popular and solicited bands of the genre Folk Death Metal in Italy. Dusk of the Ages is their third album. The music is a blend between Melodic Death and Celtic Folk. Besides the \"Beauty and the Beast\" vocals of Davide (male, growl and scream) and Valentina Pucci (guest female clean vocals), many times in harmony, the trademark of the band is the inclusion of Becky's powerful celtic harp. All songs are well constructed and appealing, some including violin, acoustic guitar and tin whistle. Favorite songs: the powerful The Phoenix and The Gates of Annwn, the magic Canto D'Inverno, the instrumental The Sound of Infinity and the varied Dusk of the Ages (nice solo and harp outro). Well done, I do hope to see the band alive someday.\n\nFuror Gallico Facebook\n\nFUROR GALLICO - The Phoenix (Lyric Video)\n\nDesdemonia - Anguish (2018) 7.5/10\n\nDespite existing since 1994 and this being their 4th album, Desdemonia is new to me. They come from the small country of Luxembourg (by the way nice country and the only Grand Duchy in the world) and what caught my eye on this was the name of Fredrick NorstrÃ¶m (At the Gates, Arch Enemy, Hammerfall, Opeth, etc) in mixing and mastering. The genre is more than just Death Metal (Metal Encyclopedia) and most of the time I would categorize this on Melodic Death, but with some quite technical parts and groove. The less melodic songs are not too appealing to me, but most are reasonable good. Guitars and vocals on some songs, like Anguish, have notorious Amon Amarth influences (kuddos). A good album, deserved to play several times.\n\nDesdemonia Facebook\n\nDesdemonia - Anguish (official video)\n\nDesdemonia - Endless Fight (Official Music Video)\n\nTomorrow's Outlook - A Voice Unheard (2018) 9/10\n\nThe recipe for a great album? Join three passionate and talented friends, write a dozen kick-ass tunes, complete lineup with several guests and... bam! A Voice Unheard is the second album from this Norwegian trio (Trond is listed as manager and co-writer) and, from the beginning to the end, true Heavy Metal happens. I would say the mix is 2/3 Iron Maiden and 1/3 Judas Priest, with some drama added, related to the album concept story about apocalypse. What about the guests? Ralf Scheepers (Primal Fear, etc) is the singer in half the songs, Tony Johannessen (Thunderbolt) sings in 5 and Scott Oliva (Reverence, etc) in 1. The last two songs are covers from Bruce Dickinson and Aria (the most know Metal Russian band) with the participation of Vitaly and Maxim (Aria). Roy Z mixed the album. This a band that needs to complete the lineup and embark on a massive tour, for sure successful!\n\nTomorrow's Outlook Facebook\n\nTomorrow's Outlook - A Voice Unheard\n\nTomorrow's Outlook - Nothing Shall Remain (Official Lyric Video)\n\nSojourner - The Shadowed Road (2018) 9.5/10\n\nSome weeks ago I reviewed Sojourner's first album Empires of Ash. Meanwhile, this international band, with members from all around the world, signed a deal with Napalm Records, my favorite record company. It's now time to review their last opus. The cover art, in the same line of the previous album, induces us not to expect a path change (thanks!). On a general evaluation, the album reveals a more mature approach, the tin whistle gains evidence as well as the angelical vocals of Chloe Bray. To the whole improvement it's not strange Dan Swano's mastering. Of course it's still Epic Atmospheric Black Metal with an highlands accent, plenty of beautiful moments. One of the best albums of 2018, for sure, and now I'm suffering from high doses of anxiety to their first concert in Portugal, 23-24 August. Just one complain, the 51 minute album duration flew too fast.\n\nSojourner Facebook\n\nSojourner - Titan\n\nSojourner - Ode to the Sovereign (North of the Wall & Dark Troll Live Reel)\n\nÐÑÐ¸Ñ - ÐÑÐ¾ÐºÐ»ÑÑÑÐµ Ð¼Ð¾ÑÐµÐ¹ [Aria - Curse Of The Seas] (2018) 8.5/10\n\nFormed in 1985, Aria is considered by far the main Heavy Metal act in Russia. One curiosity about this band is that the lyrics are written mainly by poets, and they always sing in Russian. Due to this, the public target are mainly the russian fans. Outside the borders, they are not so popular despite their undeniable quality. This Curse Of The Seas is the 13th album of originals, includes 11 catchy songs along 75 minutes and was mixed by Roy Z. The music could be side by side with the best from recent Iron Maiden or Accept, just listen to the 1st (Race for Glory) or 6th (It All Starts Where the Night Ends) songs, but also some delicious progressive pieces will surprise. Mikhail Zhitnyakov does a pretty decent job on vocals. To be checked by all Metal fans, and if not used to singing in russian, give it a try.\n\nAria Facebook\n\nÐÑÐ¸Ñ - ÐÑ ÐÐ°ÐºÐ°ÑÐ° Ð´Ð¾ Ð Ð°ÑÑÐ²ÐµÑÐ° (2018)\n\nOrion's Reign - Scores of War (2018) 8.5/10\n\nMediterranian sea not only saw the birth of great civilizations, also has some importance in the European Power Metal Scene. These Greek brothers started in 2005 and released the first album, Nuclear Winter in 2008 (rereleased as deluxe limited edition in 2010). Scores of War is the second album and includes 57 minutes of epic symphonic Power Metal. Besides some Rhapsody influences, several distinguished guests add diversity to some songs (Tim \"Ripper\" Owens, Mark Boals, Minniva, Bob Katsionis). All songs are quite well played and sung, I may highlight the fast symphonics Elder Blood or Warrior's Pride, the folkish An Adventure Song, the epic Nostros (with violin and the crystal clear Minniva vocals) and the manowarish Ride to War. A good album and another band to deserve better recognition!\n\nOrion's Reign Facebook\n\nORION'S REIGN & MINNIVA - Nostos (2018) // Official Video\n\nORION'S REIGN ft TIM RIPPER OWENS - Together We March (2018) // Official Video\n\nAsh of Ashes - Down The White Waters (2018) 9/10\n\nThis new band is a project from Skaldir, aka Markus Skroch, ex-Hel, owner of the Kalthallen Studios in Germany, also with an important role in recording, mixing and mastering many bands, like Myrkgrav. Together with Morten B., they based the band's sound and lyrics on nordic influences and legends. The promo says the genre is Epic Skaldic Metal, basically it is Epic Pagan Metal with Viking accent, reminding in some parts Bathory or Falkenbach. The result is quite good, all nine songs plus outro flow free with great melodic and intense moments, including an instrumental, Springlar, adapted from a folk song. The last four songs relate the story of Wayland, an heroic legend. Definitively a project to follow!\n\nAsh of Ashes Facebook\n\nAsh Of Ashes Down The White Waters\n\nSojourner - Empires of Ash (2016) 9/10\n\nNow this is an international project, with members living in New Zealand, Sweden and Italy, also with strong connections to Scotland, and... long life Internet. Sojourner was born in 2015, and just one year after, this album was released. And what a start! The music is an exquisite epic atmospheric black metal with plenty of folk moments, sharing some afinities with Saor or Summoning. The density of riffing guitars and the delicacy of the tin whistle among some keys work well on all songs, some quite long, but never boring. On vocals also we get a quite good \"beauty and the beast\" combination. It's not normal for me to review older albums, but... surprisingly the band will be gathered and is coming to play in Portugal next August. The 2018 album review will follow soon on these pages.\n\nSojourner Facebook\n\nSojourner - Heritage of the Natural Realm\n\nSojourner - Trails of the Earth (2016)\n\nCor Scorpii - Ruin (2018) 9.5/10\n\nOne band that made an impression on me was Windir (one of the patches in my vest) and Valfar's tragic death was a shock. But their music stays forever. And that very particular music genre, Sognametal, named from the norwegian fjord region, is well and alive. One of the bands that better honors Windir's legacy is Cor Scorpii, that includes Gaute Refsnes, keyboards on the last two Windir's albums. Ruin is Cor Scorpii's second album, ten years after the first one, and it's a masterpiece of Melodic Black Metal with some folk, driven a great guitar work, impressive drums and bass lines, extremelly melodic keyboard pieces and beautiful songs. Thomas vocals fit quite well but leaving the focus on the music. An album indispensable for Windir fans and excellent to iniciate those who never heard them. And thanks to the Bergen Kommune for partly funding this album. More city councils should follow this!\n\nCor Scorpii Facebook\n\nCor Scorpii - Skuggevandrar (Official Audio)\n\nCor Scorpii - Fotefar [New Song] 2018\n\nNeros Benedictios - Ermo (2018) 8.5/10\n\nNeros Benedictios is a 15 years old four members Melodic Black Band from Recife, Brazil. Despite the age, and after a 36 minute demo in 2005, only in March 2018 this first album was digitally released. Some months after, a nice digipack with beautiful artwork was released. That's great that this band didn't give up and gained experience by the years. The music is a varied Black Metal, the opposite from raw, fast and plenty of changes, including some acoustic breaks. But acoustics are not limited to some inserts, the album includes three complete acoustic songs that fit well on the dense sequence. All songs have something special, I may point Carcosa with a bit of everything. Even those who don't like Black Metal should give this a listen and be surprised.\n\nNeros Benedictios Facebook\n\nNeros Benedictios - Ermo [Official Full Album] 2018\n\nBrainstorm - Midnight Ghost (2018) 9/10\n\nHere it is a brand new album from one of the most regular bands in Power Metal. The Germans released this 12th album of originals and the first impression is that the thematic of the previous album, Scary Creatures, is maintained. As songs started to spin, the top melodic power music supported by great riffs and the unmistakable Andy B. Franck vocals, are present. Midnight Ghost was produced, engineered, mixed and mastered by no other than Sebastian \"Seeb\" Levermann (Orden Ogan) and the result is great. Of course some could argue that the band applies the same safe formula, but those who like strong and melodic Power Metal don't care. And, in my oppinion, this is the best Brainstorm album ever, all songs are great. However my fave is Jeanne Boulet (1764). A final word to the awesome limited box edition with a signed photo and an old style alarm clock.\n\nBrainstorm Facebook\n\nBRAINSTORM - When Pain Becomes Real (2018) // Official Music Video\n\nBRAINSTORM - Ravenous Minds (2018) // Official Video\n\nKylfingar - VilÃ¡gok HatÃ¡rÃ¡n (2018) 9/10\n\nAnother good surprise discovered on Internet. Kylfingar is a Hungarian band that play a mix of Viking Folk Metal with nordic influences. The name comes from a scandinavian tribe that raided Eastern Europe, including Hungary, around the 10th century. The band founders started by learning covers of their favorite bands, Ensiferum, Finntroll, Equilibrium and others, but soon advanced for their own material, of course influenced by those bands. VilÃ¡gok HatÃ¡rÃ¡n is the second album, meaning \"At the Border of Worlds\", and it's 56 minutes of quite good Viking Folk Melodic Metal, sung in Hungarian, with great and epic melodies. Besides the efficient guitars, bass and drums, the violin and keyboards define the folk, celtic and ambient parts. Definitively a band to be followed by those who like Ensiferum and Finntroll!\n\nKylfingar Facebook\n\nKYLFINGAR - ÃrÃ¶k VadÃ¡szat (Official Lyric Video)\n\nKYLFINGAR - JÃ¶tÃ¼nheim KÃ¼rtjei (Official Lyric Video)\n\nKalidia - The Frozen Throne (2018) 9/10\n\nThis review is special to me: Nicoletta Rosellini is one of my first Facebook friends and the first interview to the reborn Sounds from Apocalypse, back in 2014, was Kalidia's (here). 4 years after the first album, the excellent Lies' Device (second review on the site), here is finally The Frozen Throne. The music is still melodic Power Metal with some symphonic and few gothic details, but evolved in terms of composition and sound. The crystal vocals of Nicoletta, one of the best Female vocals around (also with Walk in Darkness and Overtures, among many other collaborations), superbly captured, is highlighted by the excellent production and mix by Lars Rettkowitz (Freedom Call). All instruments, as well as several symphonic tracks, give a solid consistency and diversity to the songs. This album deserves a huge tour, I hope that Portugal could be included!\n\nKalidia Facebook\n\nKalidia - Frozen Throne [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]\n\nSkÃ¡lmÃ¶ld - Sorgir (2018) 10/10\n\nHere is the expected return of the mighty SkÃ¡lmÃ¶ld, one of my top bands. Coming from the cold and spectacular Iceland, the sextet play an addictive Viking Folk Metal, sung in local language. Two years after the VÃ¶gguvÃ­sur Yggdrasils release (with a humble contribution of this yours), Sorgir is a darker album, divided in two parts. The first four songs are stories of death and tragedy, while the next four are the same stories but from the perspective of the ghosts that caused the tragedies. The bonus track is the excellent HÃ¶ndin sem veggina klÃ³rar, included in the split with Omnium Gatherum. Musically speaking, the album is impeccable, with great melodies, solos and harmonies, different vocal contributions. Favorite songs? Hard to mention, probably Mara and the two on video. Looking forward to meet the band again next December!\n\nSkÃ¡lmÃ¶ld Facebook\n\nSKÃLMÃLD - SverÃ°iÃ° (Official Lyric Video) | Napalm Records\n\nSKÃLMÃLD - MÃ³ri (Official Lyric Video) | Napalm Records\n\nOrder to Ruin - Let The Mortals Bleed (2018) 8/10\n\nAn album that starts with a song named Cheers to the Apocalypse must be reviewed here ☺ Earlier this year I reviewed Return to Ceyrior VII and now, eight months later, a new album was released. During this short period, they changed vocals and hired a bass player. But the band permanent lineup is still Denis and Simon, guitars. And what to expect from this proactive German band? Good Melodic Death from start to end, faithful to the sound of Gothenburg, but with some thrash and power elements, like the beat on Under the Veil of Obscurity. The melody is always present and supported by the twin guitars, well shown on the title album song or Neo's Fear. Nice work! And maybe by the middle of next year we'll have another album ☺\n\nOrder to Ruin Facebook\n\nOrder to Ruin - NeoÂ´s Fear\n\nElvenstorm - The Conjuring (2018) 9/10\n\nHere is a quite underrated female fronted band, coming from France and existing for 10 years. The style is a mix between True Heavy Metal and old school Speed Metal. The Conjuring is the 3rd album and, after an intro that names the album, no merci for the weak and speed ahead. All songs are fast with emphasis on an excellent guitar work and pounding drums. Laura Lombard's vocals, with a tone similar to Crystal Viper's Marta Gabriel, in some parts seem a bit in effort, should have been better mixed. I particularly like the sequence starting with the superb instumental Stellar Descension, the hymn Evil's Dawn and Cross of Damnation, very Running Wild. The Forces of True Metal are conjured! Enjoy!\n\nElvenstorm Facebook\n\nELVENSTORM - Devil Within' (Full Song)\n\nStellar Descension\n\nAsterism - Ignition (2018) 8.5/10\n\nAnother great surprise provided by internet. Asterism is a young japanese band, and really young: Hal-Ca, the guitar lady, is only 15 yo, Miyu, the bass player, is 16 yo and Mio, the drummer, is 18 yo. They met in 2014 at The 8th Music Revolution and the bond was made, united by Metal. Ignition is the first anticipated album, after two EPs. The music is neo-classical Heavy Metal, 99% instrumental, where Miss Hal-Ca shreds like a guitar hero (and the reader must see her amazing passion on video), no strange her idol is Akira Takasaki (Loudness). Despite the age, Miyu and Mio are also excellent players. Besides great own written songs, the album includes two nice covers: Stand Up and Shout (Dio) and Helter Skelter (Beatles), and the special first edition is accompanied by a 38 minutes DVD with all clips, live songs and studio report. Definitely a band with a promising long career!\n\nAsterism Facebook\n\nASTERISM Rising Moon MVã(AL âThe Session Vol.2)\n\nDoro - Forever Warriors, Forever United (2018) 6/10\n\nThe so-called Metal Queen is back with its 13th album of originals and six years after the last one, but meanwhile a bunch of compilations, lives, singles have been feeding the lady's account. Long time ago, I belonged to the Warlock fan club, but after the first solo albums of Miss Doro Pesch I lost interest. Anyway, for this new ambitious double album let's give it a try. The usual recipe is here used to exhaustion: catchy heard-this-before refrains, banal repetitive lyrics, super-production, several ballads, some German... I couldn't find a theme that get my attention. Not even Amon Amarth's Johan Hegg retribution on \"If I Can't Have You - No One Will\" or the Motorhead cover \"Lost In The Ozone\" save this. Better hear the four Warlock albums!\n\nDoro Facebook\n\nDORO - All For Metal (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nMoonshade - Sun Dethroned (2018) 9.5/10\n\nFinally! Here is the first album of this Melodic Death Portuguese band. I'm following Moonshade since the excellent Dream | Oblivion EP, back in 2014, and, when meeting the guys, the question was always about the album release. And the wait proved to be worth it, Sun Dethroned is one of the best Melo Death albums of the year, so far. Everything here shows an extreme care: the concept and lyrics, the guitar work with many catchy riffs, the orchestrations filling perfectly the music, Ricardo's vocals... I would dare to say that here Dark Tranquillity meets Aephanemer and Wintersun. All songs are great, with an identifiable sound but plenty of subtle details and surprises. I foresee a huge success for Moonshade. Portugal is not only Moonspell (good sentence borrowed from Los Mejores Rock Magazine), another band, by coincidence whose name also starts by Moon, is just around the corner.\n\nMoonshade Facebook\n\nMoonshade - The Flames that Forged Us (Lyric Video)\n\nOmnium Gatherum - The Burning Cold (2018) 9/10\n\nGrey Havens, the previous album from 2016, is a reasonable piece of Finnish Melodic Death but nothing overwhelming. However, this new album is a strong improvement and guides Omnium Gatherum to the top of the Gothenburg sound. Everything in the album is planned in detail, since the cover art to each of the songs. Quite interesting is the fact that this work's name is the combination of the first song, a good instrumental, and the last song, a midtempo that concludes the album and recovers the opening riffs. The second song, the excellent Gods Go First, immediatly defines the album and it will be mandatory in any show setlist, well seconded by the fast Refining Fire. Most of the songs are quite good, but I want to highlight Be The Sky, love the riffs, melody and the acoustic interlude. Jukka Pelkonen vocals have the perfect intensity acording to the songs. A must for every Melo Death fan. I'd love to see these guys alive again!\n\nOmnium Gatherum Facebook\n\nOMNIUM GATHERUM - Gods Go First (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nPowerwolf - The Sacrament Of Sin (2018) 10/10\n\nThree years after Blessed and Possessed has taken the Metal World by storm, and three shows attended, I was with great expectations on the following, if the German Wolves could maintain or surpass the previous album. And success! The Sacrament of Sin maintains their unique brand of Epic Symphonic Power Metal sound, with no distinct bass, the operatic vocals of Attila Dorn, the keyboard orchestrations, the guitar duels, and the collection of excellent no-more-than-4-minutes contagious hymns. But it also includes some new elements, like the celtic touch on Incense and Iron, the Where the Wild Wolves Have Gone slow (well sung, Attila, and great solo) or the unique vibe of Stossgebet. This album, supported by the mix of churches, sex and wolves image and concept, has everything to maintain Powerwolf on the route to be one of the best Heavy Metal acts around. Also looking forward to see this tour! Metal is Religion!\n\nPowerwolf Facebook\n\nPOWERWOLF - Fire & Forgive (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nAmorphis - Queen Of Time (2018) 9/10\n\nI followed Amorphis almost since the fine doom death time with The Karelian Isthmus and the superb Tales from the Thousand Lakes. Between Tuonela and Circle I didn't pay too much attention to these Finns. But Under The Red Cloud got my attention again by its imagination and quality. The first time I heard Queen of Time, wow, what a blast! Since the first notes of the excellent The Bee to the last accords of Pyres on the Coast, everything flows smoothly without compromising with subgenres and being quite diverse. And all this without loosing the characteristic Amorphis sound with harsh and clean vocals, keyboard melodies and exquisite solos. Some loose remarks: the participation of Anneke van Giersbergen in Among the Stars, the Hotel California intro of The Golden Elk and the cinematic We Accursed. I do hope to see the band alive on this tour!\n\nAmorphis Facebook\n\nAMORPHIS - The Bee (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)\n\nGwydion - Thirteen (2018) 9.5/10\n\nThanks Asgard! Gwydion are back, five years after suspending activity. The most known Folk Viking Metal Portuguese band just released Thirteen, their fourth album, and the scandinavian-influenced hordes are gathered again! Heathen (intro) away, 793 is the perfect drums power battle hymn, followed by two of the best album songs, the epic Balverk Warfare and the full of details folkish Strength Remains. And the remaining songs are also quite good, particularly Shield Maiden's Cry (SkÃ¡lmÃ¶ld meets Ensiferum?) and the new band's hymn Thirteen to sing and go into circle pits. Kaveirinha's lead guitar and Daniel's keyboards define the melodies, well supported by the other guitar and a powerful bass and drums work. Vocalizations, main and chorus, are epic as Odin would command. And party assured in all gigs!\n\nGwydion Facebook\n\nGwydion - Thirteen Days - Lyric Video\n\nCryonic Temple - Deliverance (2018) 7/10\n\nCryonic Temple is around since 1996, released the first album in 2002, but never got the stardom of other Swedish Power Metal acts, like HammerFall or Sabaton. After a 9 years hiatus they returned last year with Into The Glorius Battle, interesting but nothing special. On 20th July here comes their sixth album, Deliverance. With a pompous intro, the second song starts with a great acoustic moment and one of the best album songs, Rise Eternally Beyond, very Helloweenish. Songs make a mix between some old school Heavy Metal (like the Priest influence on the title theme) and soft Power Metal with plenty of keyboards on the background. The weakest part to me are the vocals, not transmitting enough energy.\n\nCryonic Temple Facebook\n\nCRYONIC TEMPLE - End Of Days (Lyric Video)\n\nShylmagoghnar - Transience (2018) 10/10\n\nWhen beauty comes to music! One of the most thrilling bands around, whose virtuosity is proportional to the difficulty in spelling its name! Shylmagoghnar is a two \"blood brothers\" project from the Netherlands, they play a sort of Progressive Melodic Death with some Black roots. Their first album, Emergence, independent, got more than 1.7 billion views on Youtube and it was natural the interest of record companies (nice move, Napalm Records). Transience is the second opus, four years after the first album, and it's 73 minutes of delight with a perfect blend of exquisite guitar work with all instruments and vocals, also including three epic instrumentals. Some experiments, like the pagan smell on No Child Of Men Could Follow resulted quite well. One of the best albums of 2018 for sure, if not the best!\n\nShylmagoghnar Facebook\n\nSHYLMAGOGHNAR - Transience | Napalm Records\n\nEuphoreon - Ends of the Earth (2018) 9.5/10\n\nThat's what I like more on the Internet: to find such great music and have a direct link for those who create this art. Euphoreon is a two-men band that couldn't be further: Eugen in Germany and Matt in New Zealand. Anyway, in modern times, distance is not an issue and the proof is here, an excellent piece of Melo Death, plenty of beautiful melodies, great riffs, some magnificent chorus and melancholic piano passages. Of course the main reference is Wintersun, but these friends manage to have a proper sound and don't need a half million euros studio. A special note, when acquiring the album on bandcamp, you will also get the instrumental version, that's also a pleasure to hear! All songs are quite good but to me Mirrors is awesome.\n\nEuphoreon Facebook\n\nEuphoreon - Ends of the Earth\n\nEphyra - The Day of Return (2018) 8/10\n\nEphyra is an Italian Folk Metal band with clear female vocal and harsh male vocal. With this third album, the heaviest to date, I would say this is more Melodic Death with some Folk and sliding a bit to Orient. Most songs are well achieved, but to me the rhythm is a bit repetitive and the drums sound could be less rough. However I do like the oriental feeling, with some throat singing and the mongolian folk instruments. My highlights are Your Sin, Being Human and Sublime Visions, this one an instrumental.\n\nEphyra Facebook\n\nEphyra - Your Sin [OFFICIAL LYRIC]\n\nHeimsgard - Following The Starlight (2018) 9.5/10\n\nI love the days when I discover awesome Metal. And some days ago, it was a bright one, even with stress work and rain. Heimsgard is a one-man project, Raido, also the Epictural Productions manager, France. The music is a glorious epic Pagan Folk Metal that may spin non stop and warm our Metal souls. Before writing the review, I also heard the previous work, Ordrag, that by the way is also excellent. Following The Starlight is more pompous, with more layers of instruments thus having a more complex, but still quite epic and melodic, sound. Raido does a quite nice job in all instruments, particularly guitars, programming and mixing all together. For less good days, this is a proper antidote!\n\nHeimsgard Facebook\n\nHeimsgard - I was born under a wandering star\n\nNebelhorn - Urgewalt (2018) 7/10\n\nNebelhorn is the project of Wieland, where this German guy plays everything. The music is well assumed as Viking, but several parts are pure Death and Black while others Pagan Melodic, and including, as usual in this subgenre, some chorus, nature sounds and folk. Urgewalt is the fourth album, released more than 10 years after the last one. If there are catchy songs, like the title song (some SkÃ¡lmÃ¶ld here) or Auf Neue Lande, with a contagious rhythm, others are less achieved. The album ends quite well with Freyhall, a good instrumental.\n\nNebelhorn Facebook\n\nNebelhorn Urgewalt Teaser 2018\n\nSuotana - Land Of The Ending Time (2018) 9.5/10\n\nAs a few of you know, Suotana comes from the cold Finland. Land of the Ending Time is the second album and, if the previous Frostrealm was a pleasant surprise, this one is the confirmation of an excellent band, and one of the best Melodic Death bands around. For this album, the band pushed quite high the technical limits and sequenced the songs on a conceptual album. The result? A quite good mix between Wintersun and Kalmah with some minor doses of Power Metal and Children of Bodom added to the cauldron. The new elements on keyboards and vocals helped to expand the band's diversity. All songs are great, making this one of my preferred albums of the year.\n\nSuotana Facebook\n\nSUOTANA - Into The Ice (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nDogma - Reditum (2017) 8/10\n\nDogma is a Doom Gothic Portuguese band, created in late 1996. They released a demo and two EPs and dismissed in 2003. In 2014, four of the former members decided to revive the band, specially recovering the old demo songs together with some more from that time and the result is Reditum. I'm not a particular doom fan (opposition of my nick, ah ah), but the result is a damned good album. Singing in Portuguese, with excellent male and female vocals and quite good guitar riffs, I would highlight Criacao and Sangue & Frio songs. Doom Gothic used to be quite popular in Portugal those years, it's not strange that some influences from Moonspell and Desire are noticed.\n\nDogma Facebook\n\nReditum (full album)\n\n11th Dimension - Paramnesia (2018) 8/10\n\nKnowing the band from some time I had some expectations about their first album. 11th Dinension is a Progressive Metal band from Lisbon, Portugal, launched in 2013, but with older roots. Fronted by an exquisite female vocal, Diana Rosa, also with a successful photographic model career, her crystal clear voice much defines 11th Dimension sound. The music is quite dense and intricate, due to Pedro Marques guitar work and the efficiency of Carlos' bass and Filipa's drums. Best songs to me: the strong Trust Denied, the unexpected Expectations and the varied The Journey of The Wild Mind. After recording, a second guitar was added, I'm looking forward to see the result ☺\n\n11th Dimension Facebook\n\n11th Dimension - Trust Denied (Music Video)\n\nMetalwings - For All Beyond (2018) 7.5/10\n\nHere it is a good Symphonic Metal work. Coming from Bulgaria and still unsigned, this quintet is fronted by Stela Atanasova, an excellent opera vocalist that also plays electric viola (a kind of violin) and manages the band. Their first video, Crying of the Sun, included on the first EP, have been seen more than 12 million times. For All Beyomd is the first album, where Stela's vocal capabilities and viola are highlighted and well escorted by keyboards and the other intruments, with some irish flute adding a celtic touch. Without weak songs, my favorite is Secret Town, also quite nice and original is Tujni Serza, a slow sung in Bulgarian.\n\nMetalwings Facebook\n\nMETALWINGS â Thereâs No Time (Official Track)\n\nKanseil - Fulische (2018) 8/10\n\nA different type of Folk? Yeah! Kanseil is an Italian band existing since 2010 and this is their second album. Instead of party or beer songs, the lyrics here are quite important and drive the songs. The vocals, in Italian and excellent, by the way, alternate between clean and harsh, also some spoken parts are incorporated to add drama to their stories. The music is a heavy Folk with several Melodic Death, even Death, and when needed, acoustic parts. Of course bagpipes and whistles are here quite important but also an unusual, in Folk, guitar work. Besides Pojat (the video below), Densiloc (good guitars), Vallorch (typical song) and the acoustic Serravalle deserve to be mentioned.\n\nKanseil Facebook\n\nKANSEIL - Pojat (Official Music Video)\n\nBeyond the Katakomb - Beyond the Katakomb (2018) 9/10\n\nDo you know The Storyteller, an excellent Power Metal band from Sweden? Well, I'm following them since the beginning. After some years of a matured process, Beyond the Katakomb is the born son of my friend L-G Persson, The Storyteller's mastermind. Reuniting a set of experienced musicians, like Henrik Ohlsson (Scar Symmetry) and Johan Niemann (Evergrey, Talisman, Tiamat), and engineer/producer Per Nilsson (Scar Symmetry, Nocturnal Rites, etc), this work acts like a solo album and represents a mystic introspection taking L-G vocals to new dimensions. Of course the epic Power roots are there but I would classify this mainly as Epic Progressive. The album is quite diverse, each of the 12 songs have a proper feeling, but all well played and sung, on a common melody line. Excellent production. This album will be released by the end of June 2018.\n\nBeyond the Katakomb Facebook\n\nBeyond The Katakomb - The Parallel God (Lyric Video)\n\nGrimner - Vanadrottning (2018) 9/10\n\nNow here is one of my favorite Folk Viking bands, and a new album to sing and drink around the fire! Two years after the acclaimed Frost Mot Eld, Vanadrottning maintains the same epic Folk Viking genre. Most songs are driven by Johan's flute, but perfectly folowed by all instruments, thus creating an easy identifiable sound. Besides the excellent En Fallen JÃ¤tte (first video), the fast DÃ¶dens Dans and Freja Vakar (bonus song) will please every Metal fan. SÃ¥ngen Om Grimner (The Song of Grimner) is also a great midtempo song, reminding me the country mates Manegarm. This is a band that I must see alive!\n\nGrimner Facebook\n\nGrimner - En Fallen JÃ¤tte (Official Music Video)\n\nTheriomorphic - Of Fire and Light (EP 2018) 8/10\n\nLong time no heard (well, except on two tributes) for this historical Portuguese Death Metal act and JÃ³'s band (all local metalheads know JÃ³ and his The Deadstore)! The last album, The Beast Brigade, was released 10 years ago! The EP starts quite well with an orchestral intro by Kaveirinha (Gwydion), followed by the excellent Fire (not expecting some Amon Amarth influences!). The remaining songs alternate between well placed intros and good Death with some melody and vibrant riffs yet not dropping on the Gothenburg sound. A good surprise! The digital version is free here.\n\nTheriomorphic Facebook\n\nTheriomorphic â Of Fire And Light [full EP with lyrics]\n\nAngelus Apatrida - Cabaret De La Guillotine (2018) 9/10\n\nThis is one of my top Thrash bands ever, being lucky enough to have seen them alive several times. Of course, hearing that a new album is coming, just followed every bits of music and clips. And Cabareth De La Guilhotine, the fifth full-length of these Spanish Thrash Gods, confirms to be one of the best works on this genre for last years. With plenty of riffs, fast energetic structures, powerfull old-style vocals, enough melody, no cores or modern effects, this is an album that will spin a lot. Among such hymns as Sharpen the Guillotine or Downfall of the Nation, pure speed as One of Us, also there is an awesome emotive song as Farewell. Hoping to see these Brothers alive again!\n\nAngelus Apatrida Facebook\n\nANGELUS APATRIDA - Farewell (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nVallendusk - Fortress of Primal Grace (2018) 9.5/10\n\nAnother precious gem discovered on the net. Vallendusk is a band from Indonesia (!) that plays an awesome Atmospheric Melodic Black Metal. When I first heard this I immediatly became a fan and ordered the available CDs. Fortress of Primal Grace is the third album and the first note is for the attractive oil-painted cover. Along one hour, seven long songs are presented, in a perfect sequence, all with a permanent pair of guitars supporting a just on point black vocals and some keys filling in. I can't find any fault in this album. Fans of Wormwood (as I am) will love this! One of the best releases of the year, so far!\n\nVallendusk Facebook\n\nVallendusk - Fortress of Primal Grace (Official Album Premiere)\n\nKamelot - The Shadow Theory (2018) 8/10\n\nThe kings of Power Progressive are back with a new album, three years after Haven. And expectations are not drop, the album consolidates the route from the two previous albums, yet without innovating. The Shadow Theory starts quite well with a power and melodic song, Phantom Divine, with the first female guest vocal Lauren Hart (Once Human. Among the 13 songs we got fast songs, slower songs, another duet with a female vocal, Jennifer Haben (Beyond the Black), all typically Kamelot songs, but some are forgettable. Of course we have the fabulous vocals of Tommy Karevik, good guitars and keyboards and a super symphonic production. Tour not to be misssed!\n\nKamelot Facebook\n\nKAMELOT - Phantom Divine (Shadow Empire) ft. Lauren Hart (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nNox Aeterna - Aurora Borealis (2018) 8/10\n\nHere is a new album from this Dutch quintet, still unsigned, that plays a solid Melo Death. Reviewed the previous album The Desperation Deal some years ago (almost on the rebirth of Sounds from Apocalypse) and at that time, I heard a promising band. Aurora Borealis confirms a good band with melodic and fast songs, based on a accomplice pair of guitars, filled with non-intrusive keyboards. The first three songs, specially the galloping Chasing the North (some Amon Amarth here), will get you tied to the album. The refreshing Destitude Salvation also deserves a mention. A have-to-check to all Melo Death fans!\n\nNox Aeterna Facebook\n\nNox Aeterna - Chasing The North\n\nJudas Priest - Firepower (2018) 9/10\n\nGood old Heavy Metal is healthier than ever. After excellent albums from Saxon and Blaze Bailey, among others, here is a new album from one of the most important fathers of Metal. After some so-so albums, that didn't bring too much attention to me, Firepower is quite good and the best album since Painkiller. The production is perfect, Rob's vocals is ageless, Glenn Tipton (too bad his Parkinson's disease that will prevent him to play full shows) recovers Priest's best guitar duels with Richie Faulkner. I can't nominate a weak theme, all have some special and strong moments. Not forgetting the past, Heavy Metal scene present and future is assured!\n\nJudas Priest Facebook\n\nJudas Priest - Never The Heroes (Lyric Video)\n\nElvenking - Secrets of the Magick Grimoire (2017) 8.5/10\n\nAs Elvenking is playing in Portugal in August 2018 (XI Milagre Metaleiro), it's a good opportunity to review this album, released last November. This veteran Italian band plays a catchy Melodic Power mixed with Folk and it's an assurance of live party time. With a full set of guests (Snowy Shaw, Dave Briggs of Waylander, Simone Mularoni of DGM, Alessandro Conti, etc), the sextet released a solid album plenty of good and varied songs, highlighting the opening theme (first album video). The violin, keyboard, whistle and other folk instruments fits quite well in the music enriching the sound. One of the most anticipated shows for this year, together with other excellent bands.\n\nElvenking Facebook\n\nELVENKING - Invoking the Woodland Spirit (2017) // official clip // AFM Records\n\nEldritch - Cracksleep (2018) 8.5/10\n\nTogether with DGM, Eldritch are one of my favorite Power Progressive Italian bands. These veterans started in 1990, under the name Zeus, changed to the current name in 1991. They are now back with their 11th album and Cracksleep doesn't disappoint at all, being one of their best works. The album concept and cover relates to experiences and causes about insomnia. The themes are all quite well played and sung, varied but not moving away from the progressive and melodic line. Highlighted are the excellent As the Night Crawls In (first video), the fast Reset and Voices Calling, and the emotive Hidden Friend. For sure, an album to be appreciated by fans of Symphony X, Angra and Evergrey.\n\nEldritch Facebook\n\nELDRITCH - As The Night Crawls In (Lyric Video)\n\nTribulation - Down Below (2018) 9/10\n\nI confess I never paid too much attention to this Swedish band, used to play Death Black. But being on tour with the mighty Insomnium, I had to give it a try. And wow, what an album, completely surprised me. The music is unexpectedly melodic and simultaneously refreshing, with great solos and harmonies between both guitars, excellent well constructed songs and good vocal lines, following the horror visual and lyrical themes. Throughout the album, several horror ambients are reinforced with keyboard layers. Being all good, my favorite songs are Nightbound, Lady Death, The World and Here Be Dragons. Missed Vagos 2016, looking forward to see them in a couple weeks in Lisbon.\n\nTribulation Facebook\n\nTRIBULATION - Lady Death - Live in Oberhausen 2018 (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nArkona - Khram (2018) 8.5/10\n\nA new album of originals from one of the most important Russian bands is always good news. Four years after Yav, here is an ambitious and epic 74 minutes record. Starting with a Black Metal intro, soon we get the blak folk sung in Russian, just before the 17 min epic Tseluya zhizn', a superb and intense Melodic Black Folk Tribal opus, and my fave song. And here is the confirmation of the Blackish path followed by ÐÑÐºÐ¾Ð½Ð°, for sure original and full of intricate construction melodies. Instrumentally, the album is impeccable, as the harsh and clean vocals. I just feel that some songs are too long for what they transmit (V ladonyah bogov, for instance). Anyway a quite good Melodic Black Folk album!\n\nArkona Facebook\n\nARKONA - V pogonie za beloj ten'yu (Official Video) | Napalm Records\n\nImperial Age - The Legacy of Atlantis (2018) 9/10\n\nFinally here is one of the month's most anticipated albums to me. I follow this Symphonic Russian band almost since the beginning. Knowing the band leader, Aor, perfectionism and attention to detail, with his commitment to write an ambitious Metal Opera the result couldn't be less than excellent. And it's a beautiful piece of Symphonic Metal, emotive and imponent, where all vocalizations raise perfection. While the music base are Aor and Corn keyboards, there is also an excellent work on drums, bass and guitar. All songs have remarkable parts but I will highlight The Legacy of Atlantis and The Escape. A 100% recommendation for Heavy and Symphonic fans!\n\nImperial Age Facebook\n\nIMPERIAL AGE - The Legacy of Atlantis [OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO]\n\nTherion - Beloved Antichrist (2018) 7.5/10\n\nFirst statement: this is not a Metal album, neither a Metal Opera, as announced on the tour poster, but a Rock Opera. Based on A Short Tale Of The Antichrist, by 19th century Russian writer Vladimir Soloviov, Beloved Antichrist is the most ambitious work coming from the genious mind of Christofer Johnsson, with 46 songs and lasting for more than 3 hours. The story involves more than 30 different vocals. As a Metalhead, that don't fancy Opera, this is hard to classify. Of course it's extremely well played and sung, but most songs are just Operatic vocals without any Metal base, and only few could remember Therion's Symphonic Metal. I'm sure this Opera album played alive would be quite special, but listening to the whole album is a bit boring.\n\nTherion Facebook\n\nTHERION - Theme Of Antichrist (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)\n\nWalk in Darkness - Welcome to the New World (2018) 8/10\n\nA year ago I reviewed the first album, In the Shadows of Things, of this Italian Gothic Metal band and now here is the second work. Remembering, this band is Kalidia's vocalist Nicoletta Rosellini supported by five mysterious \"monks\". While waiting for Kalidia's next Melodic Power opus, this Welcome to the New World highlights Nicolettas vocal skills, on a Gothic Metal Rock registry, leading a gang of efficient musicians. A good and varied Gothic album!\n\nWalk in Darkness Facebook\n\nWALK IN DARKNESS - 'Welcome to the New World' (OFFICIAL AUDIO)\n\nHeidevolk - Vuur van Verzet (2018) 9/10\n\nA new Heidevolk album at the beginning of the year? Great! The Folk Metal Dutch sextext is back with its sixth album, three years after the excellent Velua. By the way, Vuur van Verzet means Fire of Resistence. The themes, sung in Dutch, with two male vocals in perfect harmony, Heidevolk's trademark, are quite well escorted by all instruments, including, in some songs, folk instruments, choirs and a string quartet. I have to highlight the fantastic A Wolf in my Heart (sung in English) and The Alliance (this with guest vocal Nemtheanga from Primordial)"
