        "text": "Øye's affection for Italy informs his latest work, the 2014 album, which features songs sung in oddly accented Italian that he plans to perform at Kitec in Kowloon Bay.\n\nWhimsical and in thrall to his new home, the songs follow the jaunty, melodic style he made his own over the past decade with Kings of Convenience, the indie-pop outfit that had a minor hit with the catchy in 2004.\n\nOne of the key themes in his new musical direction is sunshine, an ironic twist in a career comprising gentle indie anthems whose easy melodies conjure thoughts of summer. \"I now live in a country that has a real summer,\" the 39-year-old says. \"A big reason for moving was the great weather. Summer, for Norwegians, is something that happens in the movies. In Italy, I feel like I am living in a movie — I am a movie star.\"\n\nSinging his latest work in Italian felt appropriate, he says, not because the songs were about his new home, but because \"it's a big pleasure when you understand how a culture works\". He says: \"Living in Italy has given me a new perspective on life.\"\n\nOne of those new perspectives is an appreciation for the dolce vita famously valued by his adopted countrymen; a laid-back attitude he refers to as the \"confirmation\" life. \"You meet someone and you agree to meet, say, at the market tomorrow. The next day you have to call to confirm. If you don't, it means it most likely won't happen. But that's OK.\"\n\nIt's an observation as quirky as Øye's songs, which with Kings of Convenience and his other musical vehicles The Whitest Boy Alive and Skog, have veered towards the eccentric. \"In Norway, if you were to arrange to meet someone up a mountain tomorrow, that's written in stone. I like the fact that people in Italy can just imagine themselves doing things — saying you're going to do something is as exciting as doing it.\"\n\nØye was at the vanguard of a Scandinavian surge that has seen bands such as The Knife, Sigur Rós and The Cardigans dominate everything from electronic dance music to pop. As Kings of Convenience, Øye and partner Erik Glambek Boe took traditional Norwegian church music and welded it to Western folk and pop, in songs constructed from delicate guitar melodies and intricate arrangements.\n\nTheir debut Coldplay-produced album released in 2001 captured a sense of intelligent and knowing innocence that sat easily alongside the likes of Pulp.\n\nThe duo's remarkable musical talent meant they were in demand as collaborators, and Øye teamed up with dozens of other Scandinavian artists, most notably dance stars Röyksopp for their debut album.\n\nØye says he's at a loss to explain the sudden explosion of musical creativity from Europe's cold northern extremes, especially his home country, where he says generations of Christian puritanism from the 18th century extinguished whatever musical culture the country had.\n\n\"When I was growing up, there were bands, but they weren't very original,\" he says. \"Music is part of the culture that just never developed.\"\n\nThe problem for Norway, he says, was a religious revulsion at public gatherings. \"We didn't have a pub culture. We used to have saunas, but the Christians saw that as sinful, men and women together. The only places people gathered was in church. That says a lot about a culture.\"\n\nOne explanation for the wave of Scandinavian acts is the demise of the nation's manufacturing industries — \"which have all gone to China. There's no longer very much meaningful work. Nobody makes anything anymore,\" he says. \"But there is music, one of the few handcrafts left that matters. It's about the only thing we still make that we can share.\"\n\nØye has also played a role in the emergence of Iceland as a musical force. After years of nurturing local bands, producing albums, and doing arrangements for a variety of artists, he recorded , his second solo album, in Iceland last year. He decided to work in the tiny island nation because he says it's become an important focus for musicians, thanks almost entirely to the success of Björk.\n\n\"Things have been getting better for Norway and Iceland over the past 40 years. People have more free time. If you go to Reykjavik, it's full of musicians. Once Björk became famous, everyone seemed to realise that being a musician for a living was not such a silly idea,\" he says.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Unlikely stories"
