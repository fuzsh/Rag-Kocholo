        "text": "Hadees Drudge - Album Review: The Mind Lies When The Soul Dies\n\n01 Aug 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nHadees Drudge is quite an anomaly in Wellington’s metal scene. Forgoing a second guitarist, they proudly rock one guitar in a genre where that’s almost unheard of.\n\nRead More...\n\nThousand Limbs - Album Review: The Aurochs\n\n16 Jul 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nThousand Limbs has been on the scene now for a few years (since 2016) and have gained quite the following since, for their powerhouse of instrumental metal. Now, if you are also a fan of Kerretta and Nine Inch Nails then Thousand Limbs will be right up your alley.\n\nRead More...\n\nCrowded House - Album Review: Gravity Stairs\n\n10 Jun 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nIn a moment we’ve all been waiting for, Crowded House, who need no introduction have released their new album, Gravity Stairs. It’s only been a little over two years since their last offering, Dreamers Are Waiting (2021) and it seems fans just can’t get enough.\n\nRead More...\n\nGovernment Pest - EP Review: Vol. 3\n\n05 Jun 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nFormed from the ashes of local bands, Hellborne and Wall of Silents to name a few, Government Pest have been on the scene since 2014 and have never failed to amaze fans with their solid metal offerings and swag of albums over the years. 2024 is no different and they’re back again with a new EP, Vol.\n\nRead More...\n\nPARK RD - Album Review The Novel\n\n23 May 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nIt’s easy to see why Auckland five-piece, PARK RD is making some noise, figuratively and literally with their debut album, The Novel. Heavy on the indie, but far from light with solid guitar riffs and pop and funk sensibilities, PARK RD are a great example of solid musicianship.\n\nRead More...\n\nBad Schematics - Album Review: C O L L I D E\n\n01 May 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nManawatu might seem one of the unlikeliest places to find some damn good alt-rock pop punk, even more so when you add elements of metal, but stranger things have happened and I’m here to tell you it’s true, and their name is Bad Schematics. Not a name that may be familiar (yet), but they are a pretty determined bunch, having released their debut EP, Keep Your Gods in a flurry of a few short weeks, in 2023.\n\nRead More...\n\nMatt Hay - Album Review: Dog and Pony Show\n\n02 Apr 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nMatt Hay may not be a name you’re familiar with yet. Well, better late than never.\n\nRead More...\n\nGig Review: Stretch To Mould @ The Welsh Dragon, Wellington - 30/03/2024\n\n31 Mar 2024 // by Kerry MB\n\nThe building once described as Wellington’s ‘fondest inconvenient convenience in the land’ by one commentator, The Welsh Dragon Bar (and Scorpio’s Restaurant) has been known as a few different things throughout it’s nearly 100-year history. From the original public convenience for Wellingtonians and its tramways employees and passengers when it was first built in 1928, to a theatre prop space, tea house and café, and for many years now, a unique but tiny Taj Mahal looking music venue, in the middle of the road on Cambridge Terrace.\n\nRead More...\n\nView All Articles By Kerry MB"
