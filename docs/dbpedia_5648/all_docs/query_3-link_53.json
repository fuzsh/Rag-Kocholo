        "text": "—From our archives— *Older Interview*\n\nInterviewed by Jessica Clingempeel\n\n© Ethereal Metal Webzine\n\nHow is life in Turisas?\n\nIt’s good thanks! We\n\njust arrived from Czech Republic, played there one show at Brutal Assault festival. It was really\n\ngood! Loads of people and very nice\n\ncrew!\n\nWhat other projects are you or have you done?\n\nMmmm… well nothing at the moment. Oh well, there’s no\n\nother projects in the past either. Hehe!\n\nIs there any talk of a new album?\n\nYep, now we’re having\n\na time off from touring because of the new album. We’re writing it right now, but don’t know\n\nanything about the releasing time. Next\n\nyear obviously.\n\nWhat lead you to choose the accordion as an instrument?\n\nCan’t remember so\n\nclearly but I think my mom put me into some kind of music school when I was a little kid, like 4 years\n\nold or something. And the teacher was\n\nplaying accordion and i thought “Wow! I wanna do that as well!” so one year after that I got my\n\nown accordion. How cool is that!\n\nWhat is your favorite Turisas song?\n\nIt’s hard to say only one but maybe Five Hundred and One.\n\nIf someone was to steal your ipod, what would they find on\n\nyour playlist?\n\nHahaha well\n\ndefinitely NOT heavy metal! I mean, yes, I do listen to heavy metal but quite rarely. But usually I’m\n\nlistening to pop, techno, dance,\n\npop/rock and so on. For example I like Hannah Montana (and Miley\n\nCyrus obviously!) and Lambretta. Oh my,\n\nit’s SUCH a good band.\n\nWere there any adjustments you had to make when joining\n\nTurisas?\n\nNot really. Well talked through the basic stuff about\n\n“rock’n roll” hehe.\n\nOut of all the places Turisas has performed, what was your\n\nfavorite or is there no place like home?\n\nI have to say there’s\n\nno place like home, hehe. And it’s really hard even to say three favourite places to perform. But\n\nas a country I love to perform for example\n\nin Canada.\n\nIs there any other instruments other than the accordion that\n\nyou want to learn or already play?\n\nI do play piano and I’m singing too.\n\nHow long does it usually take you before the shows to\n\nprepare your costume?\n\nFor me it takes only\n\nlike 10 minutes but I’m always trying to start really early because not wanting to be in a hurry.\n\nBut sometimes you have to be…\n\nDo you have any regrets joining Turisas?\n\nWhy would I have?\n\nAbsolutely not. I love this whole thing and I’m so thankful for the guys they wanted to give me\n\nan opportunity to do what I enjoy the\n\nmost.\n\nWhat helps you get motivated before each show?\n\nTalking with the guys while dressing…. I mean going\n\nthrough the set list and so on. Nothing special, really.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite past times?\n\nPast times? You mean in my life or with the band? I don’t\n\nknow then!\n\nDo you still see yourself with Turisas in the future?\n\nOh well I hope I will.\n\nTo end this, is there anything you would like to say to your\n\nfans?"
