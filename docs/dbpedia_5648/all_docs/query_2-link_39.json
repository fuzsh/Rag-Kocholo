        "meta_description": "The Osmundales (Royal Fern order) originated in the late Paleozoic and is the most ancient surviving lineage of leptosporangiate ferns. In contrast to its low diversity today (less than 20 species in six genera), it has the richest fossil record of any extant group of ferns. The structurally preserved trunks and rhizomes alone are referable to more than 100 fossil species that are classified in up to 20 genera, four subfamilies, and two families. This diverse fossil record constitutes an exceptional source of information on the evolutionary history of the group from the Permian to the present. However, inconsistent terminology, varying formats of description, and the general lack of a uniform taxonomic concept renders this wealth of information poorly accessible. To this end, we provide a comprehensive review of the diversity of structural features of osmundalean axes under a standardized, descriptive terminology. A novel morphological character matrix with 45 anatomical characters scored for 15 extant species and for 114 fossil operational units (species or specimens) is analysed using networks in order to establish systematic relationships among fossil and extant Osmundales rooted in axis anatomy. The results lead us to propose an evolutionary classification for fossil Osmundales and a revised, standardized taxonomy for all taxa down to the rank of (sub)genus. We introduce several nomenclatural novelties: (1) a new subfamily Itopsidemoideae (Guaireaceae) is established to contain Itopsidema, Donwelliacaulis, and Tiania; (2) the thamnopteroid genera Zalesskya, Iegosigopteris, and Petcheropteris are all considered synonymous with Thamnopteris; (3) 12 species of Millerocaulis and Ashicaulis are assigned to modern genera (tribe Osmundeae); (4) the hitherto enigmatic Aurealcaulis is identified as an extinct subgenus of Plenasium; and (5) the poorly known Osmundites tuhajkulensis is assigned to Millerocaulis. In addition, we consider Millerocaulis stipabonettiorum a possible member of Palaeosmunda and Millerocaulis estipularis as probably constituting the earliest representative of the (Todea-)Leptopteris lineage (subtribe Todeinae) of modern Osmundoideae.",

        "text": "General remarks\n\nIn the following treatment, the diagnostic axis characters accumulate with increasing resolution of taxonomic rank, i.e., features considered diagnostic of the family are included again also in the diagnosis for the subfamily, and those are together again repeated in the diagnosis of the genus, and so forth. We follow this practice to account for parallelism owing to potentially homoplastic but, nonetheless, informative morphological features: individual features or feature combinations diagnostic of a taxon at a given rank within a given target group may independently also be diagnostic of another distantly related taxon in another target group. Following Miller (1971), we set those features of a diagnosis in italic font whose combination serves best to differentiate this particular taxon from any other taxon at the same rank in the same target group (rank-specific discriminating characters within the target group). By doing so, potentially homoplastic, but nonetheless informative features (e.g., high degree of stele perforation) can serve as differentiating diagnostic characters within a target group of closely related taxa, even though these features may occur independently also within a more distantly related group.\n\nOrder Osmundales Link 1833\n\n(Fig. 9)\n\nDiagnostic axis characters: Stems radially symmetrical. Stele with a more or less modified, distinct peripheral metaxylem siphon, with protoxylem initially mesarch or subexarch. Phyllotaxis a tight spiral. Vascular bundle in the stipe base entire, strongly curved adaxially (e.g., C-, omega-, or horseshoe-shaped), with endarch protoxylem.\n\nStatus: Holophyletic, extant (relictual) with fossil representatives.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian to present.\n\nComments: The holophyly of all Osmundales, extant and extinct, is universally accepted (see, e.g., Yatabe, Nishida & Murakami, 1999; Smith et al., 2006; Schuettpelz & Pryer, 2007). For the family and subfamily subdivision indicated in Fig. 9 see relevant descriptions and remarks below.\n\n1 (†)\n\n(†) Family Guaireaceae R.Herbst, 1981\n\n(Fig. 10)\n\nDiagnostic axis characters: Stem and stipe cortex primarily parenchymatous and not differentiated into distinct layers; where known, stipes lacking stipular wings and stipe bundle with recurved tips (i.e., more or less omega-shaped); roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Putatively holophyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian to Early Jurassic.\n\nComments: Our subdivision of Osmundales into two main families—Osmundaceae and Guaireaceae—follows most previous studies since Guairea and Guaireaceae were established (Herbst, 1981; see, e.g., Tidwell & Ash, 1994). The main difference from the most recent proposed classification (Wang et al., 2014b) is that we exclude Osmundacaulis and Shuichengella from Guaireaceae and re-assign them to Osmundaceae. The corresponding clade in that study is most likely a long-branch artefact. The neighbour-net illustrates the morphological disparity within the earliest (Permian) Guaireaceae, but also highlights the relative scarcity of data for members of the family. In the all-inclusive data set, neither family received measurable support (BSML/NJ/MP < 10), nor the alternative proposed by Wang et al. (2014b) of a family Guaireaceae including Osmundacaulis. Nonetheless, the character suites found in the earliest Guiareaceae and Osmundaceae indicate that they represent potential sister lineages within the Osmundales and that neither one evolved from the other. The position of the Guaireaceae root is undetermined. By analogy with Osmundaceae, Itopsidemoideae may be basal within Guaireaceae considering the imperforate steles of all its members.\n\n1.1 (†)\n\nSubfamily Guaireoideae Z.M.Li, 1993\n\nDiagnostic axis characters: Stele perforated; stem and stipe cortex primarily parenchymatous and not differentiated into distinct layers; where known, stipes lacking stipular wings and stipe bundle with strongly recurved tips; roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Possibly holophyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian to Early Jurassic.\n\nComments: We recognize those Guaireaceae taxa that possess perforated (dissected) siphonosteles or dictyosteles (Guairea, Lunea, and Zhongmingella) as being sufficiently similar to each other and sufficiently distinct from other Guaireaceae (Fig. 9) that we assign them to one subfamily: Guaireoideae. Although (highly) perforated steles also evolved independently in other Osmundales (in particular, Osmundacaulis; as reflected by BSML/NJ ≥ 20 for an artificial Guairea + Osmundacaulis clade using the all-inclusive matrix), they are typically restricted to distinct sublineages with a probable inclusive common origin. The split between Guaireoideae and Itopsidemoideae is well supported (BSML/NJ/MP ≥ 70) if the taxon set is restricted to only Guaireacae (Fig. 10).\n\n1.1.1 (†)\n\n(†) Genus Guairea R.Herbst, 1981\n\nDiagnostic axis characters: Stems forming large arborescent trunks (reaching up to about 10 cm in diameter); stelar xylem siphon very thick (up to >50 tracheids in radial thickness), moderately perforated; endodermis external and internal and connecting through leaf gaps; pith and stem cortex parenchymatous only and not differentiated into distinct layers; ca 20–35 leaf traces in a given stem transverse section; roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Holophyletic or paraphyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian to Middle Triassic.\n\nComments: Guairea species are very similar to each other and sufficiently distinct from other Permian Osmundales to be recognized as a genus. The close similarity of the individually scored Osmundites braziliensis, which is the reason for the high BS of the according split under ML and LS/NJ (BSML/NJ ≥ 75), supports its synonymy with Guairea carnieri (see Herbst, 1981). A Guairea-clade would receive (moderately) high support (BSML/NJ/MP ≥ 67). However, the lack of additional Triassic Guaireaceae fossils makes it difficult to assess the relationship of Guairea and Zhongmingella to the Jurassic Lunea (they may be precursors, i.e., forming a paraphyletic group, or ancient holophyletic sister lineages with no ancestor–descendant relationship).\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) G. carnierii (J.Schust) R.Herbst, 1981 including Osmundites braziliensis of H.N.Andrews, 1950 (Late Permian: Paraguay, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; Middle Triassic: Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil).\n\n(†) G. milleri R.Herbst, 1981 (Late Permian: Paraguay).\n\nReferences: Andrews (1950), Ash (1994), Bower (1926), Herbst (1981), Herbst, Barboni & Dutra (2012), Kidston & Gwynne-Vaughan (1914), Miller (1971), Schuster (1911), Tidwell (1991) and Tidwell & Ash (1994).\n\n1.1.2 (†)\n\nGenus Lunea Tidwell, 1991\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems rhizomatous to erect; stelar xylem siphon thin (less than ca 20 tracheids in radial thickness), moderately perforated; endodermis external only; pith and cortices of stem and stipes parenchymatous with abundant scattered masses of sclerenchyma fibres; ca 25–35 leaf traces in a given stem transverse section; stipes lacking stipular wings and stipe bundle with strongly recurved tips; roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Monotypic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Early Jurassic.\n\nComments: The Guaireaceae-matrix signal regarding the placement of Lunea is ambiguous (Fig. 10). The higher support for a Lunea + Zhongmingella clade compared to the alternative of a Lunea + Guairea clade may be artificial: Lunea is relatively distinct from the (much older) Guairea spp., Zhongmingella even more so, and all are substantially distinct from the members of Itopsidemoideae. There are no traits shared by Lunea and Zhongmingella to the exclusion of Guairea that would support a sister relationship of the former two.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) L. jonesii Tidwell, 1991 (Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\nReferences: Tidwell (1991), Ash (1994) and Tidwell & Ash (1994).\n\n1.1.3 (†)\n\nGenus Zhongmingella S.Jun Wang, J.Hilton, Xiao Y.He et al., 2014\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems rhizomatous; stelar xylem siphon moderately thick (reaching up to ca 30 tracheids in radial thickness), moderately perforated, dictyostelic with internal and external phloem connecting through leaf gaps; pith and stem cortex parenchymatous with abundant scattered fibre masses; stem cortex not differentiated into distinct layers; more than 40 leaf traces in a given stem transverse section; roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Monotypic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian (Changhsingian).\n\nComments: The pith and cortex of Zhongmingella contain structural elements that have been described variously as groups or clusters of secretory cells or of sclerenchyma (Li, 1983; Wang et al., 2014b). We follow the coding in the matrix of Wang et al. (2014b) and consider these elements to be sclerenchyma masses. Perhaps owing to its peculiar cortex construction with a seemingly distinct innermost zone, Zhongmingella is unlike other members of Osmundales according to phylogenetic reconstructions (Fig. 10).\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) Z. plenasioides (Z.M.Li) Shi-Jun Wang, J.Hilton, Xiao-Yuan He et al. 2014 (Late Permian: Guizhou, China).\n\nReferences: Li (1983) and Wang et al. (2014b).\n\n1.2 (†)\n\nSubfamily Itopsidemoideae Bomfleur, G.W.Grimm & McLoughlin, subfam. nov.\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stelar xylem siphon lacking discrete leaf gaps, composed of a spongy admixture of metaxylem and more or less diffusely interspersed patches of parenchyma; stem and stipe cortex primarily parenchymatous and not differentiated into distinct layers; stipes lacking stipular wings and stipe bundle with recurved tips (i.e., more or less omega-shaped); roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Holophyletic or paraphyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian to Middle Triassic.\n\nComments: We consider the unique stele composition and structure of three Guaireaceae taxa—Itopsidema, Donwelliacaulis, and Tiania—to be so substantially different from those of the Guaireoideae to warrant the erection of this new subfamily. Itopsidemoideae might be a holophyletic sister lineage of the Guaireoideae—both lineages having appeared about the same time, and the unusual spongy metaxylem tissue representing a unique trait within the Osmundales—or include members from which the Guaireoideae with their much more complex steles have evolved, analogous to the presumed evolution of Osmundoideae from Thamnopteroideae in Osmundaceae. The less complex steles in combination with traits not found in Osmundaceae, account for the relatively high support for Itopsidemoideae vs. all other splits for the all-inclusive (BSML/NJ/MP = 42/47/32) and Guaireaceae (Fig. 10) matrices.\n\n1.2.1 (†)\n\nGenus Itopsidema Daugherty, 1960\n\nDiagnostic characters: Pith parenchymatous with interspersed tracheids; stelar xylem siphon thin (reaching ca 20 tracheids in radial thickness), lacking discrete leaf gaps, composed of a spongy admixture of metaxylem and more or less diffusely interspersed patches of parenchyma; stem and stipe cortex primarily parenchymatous and not differentiated into distinct layers; numerous (reaching >100) leaf traces visible in a given stem transverse section; stipe bundle with recurved tips (i.e., inverse omega-shaped or mushroom-shaped); stipe cortex with masses of secretory cells; surface of stem and stipes covered in multicellular spines with interspersed trichomes; roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Monotypic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Middle Triassic.\n\nComments: Unfortunately, the diagnosis, description, and documentation of Itopsidema and its type species I. vancleavei (Daugherty, 1960) followed an unconventional format that makes it difficult to compare them with other, probably closely related taxa. Important information missing from the protolog concerns, for instance, the origination and development of leaf trace protoxylem from the stele through the trace and into the stipe. This lack of information makes it impossible at present to determine how, for instance, T. yunnanense (see below) differs structurally from I. vancleavei; the separation of these taxa in the neighbour-net (Fig. 9) is partly a consequence of a poorly defined pairwise distance owing to missing data. Poor data overlap may be one reason that BS analysis provides support for Itopsidema + Tiania (BSML/NJ/MP = 38/36/15) as alternative to Itopsidema + Donwelliacaulis (BSML/NJ/MP = 59/58/63; see below).\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) I. vancleavei Daugherty, 1960 (Middle Triassic: Arizona, USA).\n\nReferences: Daugherty (1960), Hewitson (1962), Miller (1971), Ash (1994) and Tidwell & Ash (1994); see also Wang et al. (2014a).\n\n1.2.2 (†)\n\nGenus Donwelliacaulis Ash, 1994\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems exceeding 25 cm in diameter and forming very large arborescent trunks reaching more than 40 cm in diameter; pith parenchymatous with interspersed tracheid bundles; stelar xylem siphon very thick (reaching >70 tracheids in radial thickness), lacking discrete leaf gaps, composed of a spongy admixture of metaxylem and more or less diffusely interspersed patches of parenchyma; stem cortex primarily parenchymatous with interspersed sclerenchyma masses, not differentiated into distinct layers, containing rather few (ca 20) widely separated leaf traces in a given stem transverse section; stipe bundle inverse omega-shaped with recurved tips.\n\nStatus: Monotypic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Middle Triassic.\n\nComments: Hundreds of Donwelliacaulis trunk fragments have been collected from the Holbrook Member of the Moenkopi Formation of east-central Arizona (Ash, 1994), whence also the type and only specimen of Itopsidema derives (Daugherty, 1960). Owing to the small sample size and the incomplete knowledge of important diagnostic characters and about the range of variation in I. vancleavii, it remains unclear in which characters Donwelliacaulis differs structurally from Itopsidema apart from those that might be related to ontogeny and development (e.g., much larger size or fewer leaf traces). Their close relationship is reflected by the BS values for the according split (Fig. 10). We consider the two genera to be at least closely related, and suggest that they might represent different growth stages of the same type of natural plant.\n\nCells that were originally interpreted as protoxylem are “[…] about 24–36 μm in diameter and with walls about 3–5 μm thick” (Ash, 1994: 6). These dimensions are much too large for true protoxylem. Instead, we interpret those cells as small, early-formed metaxylem tracheids as they occur in the stele periphery of all Osmundaceae (see Ash, 1994: pl. 5, fig. 2; pl. 6, fig. 7). Hence, protoxylem maturation in Donwelliacaulis should no longer be considered exarch as originally proposed (see also remarks for Aurealcaulis).\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) D. chlouberii Ash, 1994 (Middle Triassic: Arizona, USA).\n\nReferences: Ash (1994) and Tidwell & Ash (1994).\n\n1.2.2 (†)\n\nGenus Tiania Shi-Jun Wang, J.Hilton, Galtier et al., 2014\n\nDiagnostic characters: Pith primarily parenchymatous; stelar xylem siphon thin (up to ca 10 tracheids in radial thickness), lacking discrete leaf gaps, composed of a spongy admixture of metaxylem and more or less diffusely interspersed patches of parenchyma; stem cortex primarily parenchymatous and not differentiated into distinct layers, containing scattered masses of secretory cells and sclerenchyma; numerous (reaching >100) leaf traces visible in a given stem transverse section; leaf trace protoxylem single and mesarch in stele, dividing into two and becoming endarch before departure from stele; leaf trace with more than four endarch protoxylem strands upon departure from stem; roots commonly arising from abaxial side of leaf trace within the stem cortex.\n\nStatus: Problematic (possibly synonymous with Itopsidema).\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian.\n\nComments: Tiania appears to differ from Itopsidema mainly in preservational aspects and in the accompanying protolog: the former has more fully documented features of the leaf traces but lacks preserved stipes (Wang et al., 2014a), whereas the type material of the latter has a few attached stipe bases but lacks documented features of leaf trace emission (see Daugherty, 1960). Tiania might be a junior synonym of Itopsidema, but formal taxonomic treatment should be based on a re-examination of the type material of Itopsidema and acquisition of more completely preserved axes.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) T. yunnanense (B.L.Tian & J.L.Chang ex Shi-Jun Wang, J.Hilton, Galtier et al.) Shi-Jun Wang, J.Hilton, Galtier et al., 2014a (Late Permian: Yunnan, China).\n\nReferences: Li & Cui (1995) and Wang et al. (2014a).\n\n2\n\nFamily Osmundaceae Martinov 1820\n\n(Fig. 11)\n\nDiagnostic axis characters: Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped). Peripheral xylem siphon typically with leaf gaps (except some Thamnopteroideae).\n\nStatus: Natural, possibly paraphyletic with respect to Guaireaceae, extant with fossil representatives.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian to present.\n\nComments: Unlike Wang et al. (2014b), we include Osmundacaulis and Shuichengella in Osmundaceae instead of Guaireaceae. We argue that Osmundacaulis may appear affiliated with Guaireaceae, and with Guairea in particular (Fig. 9), because they share several features that are highly homoplastic and are known to vary between closely related taxa or even between individuals of the same species. Such characters include the degree of stele perforation (see Vera, 2008); the occurrence of simple or dissected-siphonostelic or dictyostelic conditions (see Faull, 1901; Hewitson, 1962; Miller, 1971; Serbet & Rothwell, 1999); and the occurrence of tracheids or medullary bundles in the pith (see Gwynne-Vaughan, 1914; Hewitson, 1962). Therefore, we consider the placement of Osmundacaulis closer to Guaireaceae in the trees of Wang et al. (2014b) and in the comprehensive neighbour-nets presented here (Fig. 9) to be artificial and a result of a combination of long-branch attraction and overestimated signals from homoplastic features.\n\nBy contrast, Osmundacaulis shares with other Osmundaceae (1) the two-layered cortex of stems and stipes with an inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and an outer sclerenchymatous cylinder (as opposed to a homogeneous, un-layered cortex of stems and stipes in Guaireaceae); (2) a C-shaped or horseshoe-shaped vascular bundle with more or less incurved tips in the stipe base (as opposed to omega-shaped or mushroom-shaped bundles with recurved tips); (3) the presence of stipular wings; and (4) the formation of a prominent mantle of many persistent leaf bases and roots (as opposed to a mantle of mainly roots with no or few persistent stipe bases). These features are invariant characteristics distinguishing Osmundaceae (including Osmundacaulis) from Guaireaceae, and represent conserved traits in all extant Osmundaceae. We consider these latter features to have much greater phylogenetic and systematic significance than those used previously, and re-assign Osmundacaulis to Osmundacaeae. Shuichengella is also assigned to Osmundaceae based on the observation that it has a similarly two-layered cortex. The fact that it is not resolved as a close relative in the Osmundales neighbour-net (Fig. 8) but nested instead within Guaireaceae is probably an analytical artefact related to the dearth of preserved diagnostic characters. No split placing Shuichengella received BSML/NJ/MP ≥ 10. When the data matrix is reduced to only include Osmundaceae, Shuichengella groups with Osmundacaulis, and the corresponding split represents the best-supported alternative (BSML/NJ/MP = 42/32/22; all other alternatives BSML/NJ/MP < 10). Hence, if Shuichengella is accurately interpreted as belonging to Osmundaceae, it probably is part of the same lineage that gave rise to Osmundacaulis. If future studies should produce further support for this hypothesis, it may become appropriate to re-institute the subfamily Shuichengelloideae Z.M.Li, 1993 for these two genera.\n\n2.1\n\n(†) Subfamily Thamnopteroideae C.N.Mill., 1971\n\n(Fig. 12)\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems typically forming large, arborescent trunks. Stem core consisting primarily of tracheids. Peripheral metaxylem siphon typically entire and imperforate [most taxa] or with few leaf gaps [Chasmatopteris, some Thamnopteris spp.] or sparse perforations [Chasmatopteris]. Leaf trace protoxylem initiating subexarch in peripheral bulge, becoming endarch typically in cortex. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped).\n\nStatus: Holophyletic or paraphyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian.\n\nComments: Species included in this subfamily are rather similar to each other; the group-limited matrix (including B. rhomboidea, see below) comprises only 20 partly defined and variable characters (sites). Species included in Thamnopteris (nine variable sites) are generally similar in their preserved traits, hence 10 out of 55 pairwise distances are zero, and little phylogenetic structuring is evident (Fig. 12; File S3) within the subfamily.\n\n2.1.1\n\n(†) Genus Thamnopteris Brongn., 1849\n\nSynonyms here assigned:\n\nIegosigopteris Zalessky, 1935.\n\nPetcheropteris Zalessky, 1931.\n\nZalesskya Kidst. & Gwynne-Vaughan, 1909.\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems typically forming large, arborescent trunks.

Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped).\n\nStatus: Putatively monophyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian.\n\nComments: Many species and several genera of large, “protostelic” osmundaceous trunks have been described from Upper Permian strata of the Ural Mountains (Eichwald, 1842, 1860; Kidston & Gwynne-Vaughan, 1908; Zalessky, 1924, 1931a, 1931b, 1935). Zalessky (1935) himself and later Miller (1971) remarked that the delimitation of several of these genera is problematic and probably artificial. The main feature distinguishing Petcheropteris from Thamnopteris, i.e., the more sinuous outlines of the stipe sections in the mantle, is “[…] due to compression prior to preservation” (Miller, 1971: 141). Iegosigopteris combines features of Thamnopteris (e.g., the more rhombic shapes of sclerenchyma rings in TS) and of Zalesskya (e.g., longer tracheids in the stem centre) (Zalessky, 1935; see Miller, 1971). Furthermore, the different tracheid length might result from a misinterpretation, since the original descriptions and illustrations (Zalessky, 1935: p. 2: fig. 1, pl. 3, fig. 2) show the stem core tracheids to be rather short and indeed more like those of Thamnopteris. Finally, we note that the main features distinguishing Zalesskya from Thamnopteris are a greater number of leaf traces in the cortex, a thicker inner cortex, incompletely preserved outer cortex, and missing information on mantle and petiole bases. Therefore, we see no reason to consider Zalesskya anything but a particularly large and incomplete Thamnopteris trunk. Consequently, the three genera listed above are treated here as junior synonyms of Thamnopteris.\n\nOverall, the most distinct species of the genus (pairwise distances of 0.21–0.42 based on the Thamnopteroideae-matrix) are Thamnopteris javorskii (13 out of 20 characters unambiguously defined) and Thamnopteris splendida (15/20). Interspecies relationships are largely unclear; a limiting factor is the lack of overlap in the unambiguously defined characters. For instance, the 0.42 distance between Thamnopteris javorskii and Thamnopteris kidstonii (16/20 characters unambiguously defined) translates into six different out of 14 unambiguously defined characters for both species.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) T. diploxylon (Kidst. & Gwynne-Vaughan, 1908) comb. nov.

Stem core consisting primarily of tracheids. Peripheral metaxylem siphon with leaf gaps and sparse perforations. Leaf trace protoxylem initiating subexarch in peripheral bulge, becoming endarch typically in cortex. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped).\n\nStatus: Monotypic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian.\n\nComments: In light of our critical reappraisal of the significance of the degree of stele perforation for systematic classification (see also Vera, 2008), one can argue whether the presence of complete perforations in the xylem siphon merits the separate generic status of C. principalis. This is especially so given that we propose a rather broad definition of its closest relative Thamnopteris (see above), into which C. principalis would otherwise be merged. However, given that the entire subfamily Thamnopteroideae is otherwise composed of species with consistently imperforate xylem siphons, we consider the combination of having a stem core of more or less entirely tracheids (“protostelic”) but a truly perforated (“dictyoxylic”) stelar xylem siphon to be so unique as to warrant the separate generic status of C. principalis within Thamnopteroideae. Otherwise, the special significance of C. principalis as the single taxon having a stele construction somewhat intermediate between that of the remaining Thamnopteroideae and those of Osmundoideae might not be adequately emphasized in its systematic classification.\n\nChasmatopteris is the most distinct (derived) known Thamnopteroideae (Fig. 12; MD = 0.38–0.54 based on the Thamnopteroideae-matrix, see File S3; the relatively low distance to T. kazanensis, MD = 0.17, is unrepresentative and an artefact of missing data). Should Chasmatopteris represent an extinct genus in its own right, it probably evolved from a Thamnopteris-like ancestor, rendering the latter genus paraphyletic.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) C. principalis Zalessky, 1931[a] (Late Permian: Russia).\n\nReferences: Zalessky (1931a), Gould (1970) and Miller (1971).\n\n2.2\n\nSubfamily Osmundoideae R.Br. ex Sweet, 1826\n\n(Fig. 13)\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stem core a primarily parenchymatous pith. Stelar xylem siphon usually thin (up to ca 20 tracheids in radial thickness) and with prominent leaf gaps. Leaf protoxylem poles initiating in mesarch position in stele, becoming endarch in stele or (rarely) in cortex. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. Inner cortex usually thinner than outer cortex, rarely about equally thick. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped).\n\nStatus: Holophyletic, extant with fossil representatives.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Permian to present.\n\nComments: The signal of characters instrumental for the recognition of subfamily Osmundoideae is completely outcompeted by the signal from homoplastic characters and differentiation within its sublineages in the case of the all-inclusive Osmundales matrix and the Osmundaceae matrix (BSML/NJ/P < 10). Further taxon-reduction (81 taxa vs. 124 in the all-inclusive matrix), however, has the effect that the most distinct genera within the Osmundoideae (Palaeosmunda, Plenasium) not only receive higher support from BS (File S3) but also become apparent in the neighbour-net graphs. Notably, the Osmundoideae matrix includes ca 25% fewer characters than the all-inclusive matrix (33 vs. 45), but also has a lesser proportion of missing and ambiguous data cells (16% vs. 20%).\n\n2.2.1\n\n(†) Genus Palaeosmunda R.E.Gould, 1970\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems erect, forming arborescent trunks. Stem core a primarily parenchymatous pith. Stelar xylem siphon thin with variably developed leaf gaps. Leaf trace protoxylem poles initially single and in mesarch position in stele, becoming endarch and, in some cases, first bifurcating before departure from stele; leaf trace protoxylem further dividing repeatedly within stem cortex; leaf trace departing from stem with at least four (commonly more than 10) protoxylem strands. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder, containing few to many (reaching ca 45) leaf traces in a given stem transverse section; inner cortex about as thick as outer cortex. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped); stipe sclerenchyma cylinder somewhat rhombic to fusiform in cross-section, with lateral margins usually thinner than abaxial and adaxial portions, distally becoming extended laterally into flanges that partially or completely replace the stipules.\n\nStatus: Probably holophyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian, possibly extending to the Late Triassic.\n\nComments: The position of Palaeosmunda with respect to the other Osmundoideae genera and in particular the (putatively) paraphyletic Millerocaulis is not entirely clear (Fig. 13). Independent of the optimality criterion used, BS fails to recover any preferred placement of Palaeosmunda within alternative tree topologies (BSML/NJ/MP of all possible alternatives < 10). Nevertheless, the genus seems to represent an early-diverged, distinct sister lineage when analyzed in a larger taxonomic context (Figs. 9 and 11). Both their morphology (see Diagnostic characters; Fig. 6) and stratigraphic occurrence (Upper Permian to possibly Upper Triassic) can be taken as arguments against the alternative hypotheses that this genus represents a lineage that evolved from a Millerocaulis-type ancestor, or that it could represent the ancestral stock from which the remaining Osmundoideae evolved. Millerocaulis stipabonettiorum has several features that are unusual among Millerocaulis species and more reminiscent of Palaeosmunda (Herbst, 1995); the most conspicuous similarities are the rhombic to fusiform shape of the stipe sclerenchyma rings and the absence of sclerenchyma patches or fibers associated with either leaf traces or stipe vascular bundles (Herbst, 1995). Unfortunately, protoxylem—whose distribution and development should enable unambiguous assignment to either Millerocaulis or Palaeosmunda—is not preserved in the single available specimen. Nevertheless, since (1) we refrain from using Millerocaulis as a “waste-basket taxon” for left-over species that cannot be positively assigned to any of the other taxa of Osmundoideae; (2) all our subset analyses consistently place Millerocaulis stipabonettiorum closer to Palaeosmunda than to any other representative of Millerocaulis (the only splits involving Millerocaulis stipabonettiorum receiving BSML/NJ > 10 are those with Palaeosmunda or one of its species); and (3) generic assignment of this species should thus be considered provisional anyway, we tentatively group Millerocaulis stipabonettiorum with Palaeosmunda and exclude it from our analyses of Millerocaulis (Fig. 13).\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) P. playfordii R.E.Gould, 1970 (Late Permian: Queensland, Australia).\n\n(†) P. williamsii R.E.Gould, 1970 (Late Permian: Queensland, Australia).\n\nTentatively included:\n\n(†) “Millerocaulis” (?Palaeosmunda) stipabonettiorum (Late Triassic: Argentina).\n\nReferences: Gould (1970), Herbst (1995) and McLoughlin (1992); see also Li (1983).\n\n2.2.2\n\n(†) Genus Millerocaulis Erasmus ex Tidwell emend. E.I.Vera, 2008\n\n(Fig. 14)\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems usually rhizomatous to small (semi-)erect. Stem core a primarily parenchymatous pith. Stelar xylem siphon usually thin (up to ca 20 tracheids in radial thickness) and with prominent leaf gaps. Protoxylem poles in stele initially single and mesarch, becoming endarch in stele or (rarely) in cortex. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into thin inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and thick outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped). Sclerenchyma ring in stipe base circular to elliptic in cross-section, homogenous to gradually or diffusely heterogeneous.\n\nStatus: Probably paraphyletic with respect to Osmundeae.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Triassic to mid-Cretaceous.\n\nComments: Vera (2008) proposed merging Millerocaulis Erasmus ex Tidwell emend. Tidwell (1994; with imperforate steles) and Ashicaulis Tidwell (1994; with perforate steles) into a single genus, the broadly defined Millerocaulis Tidwell emend. E.I.Vera, which we follow here.\n\nMembers of Millerocaulis, explicitly circumscribed here as a paraphyletic taxon, can be either precursors or belong to sister lineages of the “modern” Osmundaceae (classified as Osmundeae). In the light of the notable size and disparity of the genus, it is tempting to subdivide it further. With the available information, however, a consistent further subdivision is difficult to achieve. The neighbour-net focussing on Millerocaulis is essentially a “spider-web” (Fig. 14), and the same holds true for support consensus networks (Grimm, Bomfleur & McLoughlin (2017) available from Dryad Digital Repository http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.270gs), illustrating the lack of consistent sorting signals in the underlying matrix. The traditional subdivision based on the degree of stele perforation (informal groups as in the listing below) is, therefore, not supported by any further evidence. Furthermore, the data compiled here show that imperforate and highly perforate steles are end members of a complete transformation series in Osmundoideae and, thus, provide a poor basis for classification above species level. A much deeper understanding of character conservation and evolution in the Osmundoideae would be necessary to propose a finer subdivision. Moreover, it is conspicuous that the network (Fig. 14) shows several boxes that are composed of species of similar age and similar geographic occurrence that plot closely together (e.g., Millerocaulis limewoodensis with Millerocaulis dunlopii and Millerocaulis aucklandicus all from the Middle Jurassic of eastern Australasia); we suspect that more complete knowledge of the natural variability of anatomical features of the constituent species might prove some of those to represent variants of the same natural species, as has been suggested for Millerocaulis dunlopii and Millerocaulis aucklandicus (Miller, 1971; Tidwell, 1986; zero pairwise distance here). Further potential sister species pairs including candidates for further taxonomic revision are listed in Table 1. The association of the Triassic Millerocaulis herbstii with the Cretaceous Millerocaulis kolbei is probably an artefact: both taxa differ from all other Millerocaulis as much as from each other.\n\nAlthough Millerocaulis is defined mainly on the absence of traits diagnostic of other genera of Osmundoideae, it should not be considered a “waste-basket” or “form-taxon” for Osmundoideae of uncertain affinity. We suggest that if in a new fossil osmundoid rhizome critical characters, such as stelar xylem siphon or the stipe sclerenchyma ring, are not adequately preserved, or if the fossil in question is insufficiently comparable with other fossil osmundoid taxa, it should not automatically be described as a new Millerocaulis species. Instead, we suggest that such specimens should be described in open nomenclature and labeled with the lowest taxonomic rank to which they can be confidently assigned (e.g., “undetermined osmundoid rhizome” or “Osmundoideae gen. and sp. indet.”). The name Millerocaulis should be reserved for Osmundoideae rhizomes with a distinctly plesiomorphic character suite compared with the other genera of the subfamily and, in particular, Osmundeae.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n“Millerocaulis s.str.” group (low degree of stele perforation; see Char. 8):\n\n(†) M. chubutensis (R.Herbst) Tidwell, 1994 (Late Jurassic: Argentina).\n\n(†) M. donponii Tidwell & Clifford, 1995 (Middle Jurassic: Australia).\n\n(†) M. dunlopii (Kidst. & Gwynne-Vaughan) Tidwell, 1994, including Osmundites aucklandicus P.Marshall, 1926 (Middle Jurassic: New Zealand).\n\n(†) M. indicus (B.D.Sharma) Tidwell, 1994 (Early Cretaceous: India).\n\n(†) M. juandahensis Tidwell & Clifford, 1995 (Middle Jurassic: Australia).\n\n(†) M. limewoodensis Tidwell & Clifford, 1995 (Middle Jurassic: Australia).\n\n“Ashicaulis” group (moderate degree of stele perforation; see Char. 8):\n\n(†) M. amarjolensis (B.D.Sharma) Tidwell, 1986 (Early Cretaceous: India).\n\n(†) M. australis (E.I.Vera) E.I.Vera, 2008 (Early Cretaceous: West Antarctica).\n\n(†) M. beipiaoensis (N.Tian, Y.D.Wang, Wu Zhang et al., 2013) comb. nov.

Stelar xylem siphon typically thin (up to 15, rarely up to 20 tracheids in radial thickness) and with prominent leaf gaps. Leaf protoxylem poles initiating in mesarch position in stele, becoming endarch in stele or (rarely) in cortex. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. Inner cortex usually thinner than outer cortex. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped). Stipe sclerenchyma ring heterogeneous: differentiation beginning in the stipe base usually with the formation of an abaxial arch of particularly thick-walled fibers that, distally, may differentiate further into massive sclerotic rings, patches, or arches in characteristic configurations.\n\nStatus: Natural, holophyletic.\n\nKnown geochronological range: Triassic to present.\n\nComments: Traditionally, the occurrence of a heterogenous sclerenchymatic ring in the stipe bases has been used to differentiate modern Osmundaceae (genera with extant taxa: Claytosmunda, Osmunda, Osmundastrum, Plenasium, Leptopteris, Todea) from extinct, ancient Osmundoideae (Ashicaulis–Millerocaulis group; Osmundacaulis sensu Miller; Palaeosmunda). Under the widely shared assumption that all extant Osmundaceae are holophyletic (Metzgar et al., 2008; Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; PPG I, 2016; Testo & Sundue, 2016), the heterogenous ring represents the synapomorphy for this clade. Thus, all fossil taxa with heterogenous sclerenchyma rings showing similar differentiation from an abaxial arch of thick-walled fibers should be classified as members of one of the modern genera, or be accommodated in new genera if they have character suites that clearly distinguish them from extant Osmundeae. We recognize two mutually holophyletic subtribes (see Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; but see Yatabe, Nishida & Murakami, 1999; Metzgar et al., 2008): Todeinae, the lineage leading to and including Leptopteris and Todea, and Osmundinae (former genus Osmunda), the lineage including Claytosmunda, Osmunda, Osmundastrum, and Plenasium with two subgenera (Aurealcaulis and Plenasium).\n\n2.2.3.1\n\nSubtribus Todeinae Bomfleur, G.W.Grimm & McLoughlin subtrib. nov.\n\nDiagnostic stem characters: Stem core a primarily parenchymatous pith.

Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder; inner stem cortex usually thinner than outer stem cortex; outer stem cortex heterogeneous, with a distinct ring of fibers surrounding each leaf trace.

Stems of Todeinae are readily distinct from those of their potential sister clade Osmundinae (cf. Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; but see Yatabe, Nishida & Murakami, 1999; Metzgar et al., 2008). Detailed analysis of rhizome evolution and more fossils representing this lineage will be needed to decide whether the Todeinae stems (i) can be derived from the basic type represented in Osmundinae (“paraphyletic Osmunda” scenario discussed by Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015) or (ii) represent their actual sister lineage (“monophyletic Osmunda” scenario of Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015). An important question in this context is also whether Osmundaceae foliage (Todea-type vs. Claytosmunda/Osmundastrum-type) found from the Triassic onwards (see Escapa & Cúneo, 2012; Grimm et al., 2015), can be associated with either one of the subtribes. So far, only two relatively young stem fossils with characteristic Todeinae anatomy have been found. Todeinae may simply be greatly under-represented in the fossil rhizome record, or earliest (pre-Cretaceous) Todeinae had a less differentiated, Osmundinae-like stem.\n\n2.2.3.1.1\n\nGenus Todea Willd. ex Bernh., 1801\n\nDiagnostic axis characters: Stem core a primarily parenchymatous pith.

The Early Cretaceous age of Todea tidwellii coincides with the estimated divergence of the two extant genera and would allow for both scenarios (Grimm et al., 2015). In the neighbour-nets used here, Todea tidwellii groups consistently with Todea barbara (see also Table 2), and a corresponding clade would receive moderate to high support for all matrices including these taxa (BSML = 64–73; BSLS = 66–75; BSMP = 43–52), which provides ample support for the conclusion of Jud, Rothwell & Stockey (2008) that Todea tidwellii is an early respresentative of the modern genus Todea.\n\nIncluded species:\n\nT. barbara (L.)

The species was supposed to be distinct from most other Osmundaceae in lacking stipular wings (hence the epithet estipularis = lat. “without stipules”). We disagree with this assumption, and point out several features of the specimen based on which we propose an alternative interpretation: (1) preservation of the holotype is imperfect, and parenchyma is mostly lacking throughout the specimen; (2) there are abundant transverse sections of unusually thick roots visible between the sclerenchyma cylinders of stipes throughout the mantle of the trunk; and (3) the composition of the outer stem cortex appears heterogeneous with clearly distinct rings surrounding each leaf trace already in the outer cortex. Based on these observations we argue that the type and only specimen of Osmundacaulis estipularis represents a poorly preserved fossil of an arborescent osmundoid trunk in which the strong vertical roots penetrating downwards through the mantle, together with the imperfect preservation of parenchyma, hamper the identification of stipular wings. Furthermore, the outer stem cortex is heterogeneous in a manner typical of Todea and Leptopteris, and what is visible of the inner cortex shows no evidence of sclerenchyma patches that would be diagnostic of Todea; in fact, the entire aspect of the specimen is very similar to the basal stem section of the extant arborescent Leptopteris wilkesiana reproduced by Miller (1971: compare figs. 3 and 4 of Plate II), in which the roots have removed most of the parenchymatic stipular wings. We hypothesize that this specimen represents the only known fossil trunk of a Leptopteris yet discovered, but definite assignment should await a re-investigation of the type material.\n\nIn contrast to Todea, character suites of Leptopteris rhizomes provide a highly ambiguous phylogenetic signal as reflected in the much lower supports for a potential Leptopteris clade (BSML/LS/MP ≤ 16 including the fossil described as Osmundacaulis estipularis; BSML < 10, BSLS = 26–34; BSMP = 16–18 for a clade comprising all extant species). Under ML, a competing, presumably inaccurate split (see, e.g., Metzgar et al., 2008; Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; see also Fig. 15) associates the extant Leptopteris fraseri with the Todea spp. (BSML = 39–47). Mutual holophyly of Leptopteris and Todea, however, is well-supported by distance data (Fig. 15; Table 2).\n\nIncluded species:\n\nL. fraseri (Hook. & Grev.)

Stelar xylem siphon typically thin (up to ca 20, rarely up to 25 tracheids in radial thickness) and with prominent leaf gaps. Leaf protoxylem poles initiating in mesarch position in stele, becoming endarch in stele or (rarely) in cortex. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder; outer stem cortex homogeneous, thicker than inner stem cortex. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings commonly containing strands of thick-walled fibers of various shapes and sizes; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped). Stipe sclerenchyma ring heterogeneous: differentiation typically initiating in the stipe base with the formation of an abaxial arch of particularly thick-walled fibers.\n\nStatus: Holophyletic (cf. Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015), extant with fossil representatives.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Triassic to present.\n\nComments: In analyses of molecular datasets that are based also on conserved coding chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, the outgroup-inferred root is consistently placed between Osmundastrum and a clade comprising all remaining extant Osmundaceae (Yatabe, Nishida & Murakami, 1999; Metzgar et al., 2008). Combining several lines of evidence, such as detailed analysis of the signal from molecular data, fossilized birth-death dating using frond fossils, rhizome anatomical evidence, and hybridization capacity, Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin (2015) argued that this is an outgroup-ingroup (long) branching artefact. In a recent comprehensive pteridophyte analysis aiming to capture rate shifts in the evolution of fern lineages (Testo & Sundue, 2016), the distances between the hypothetical most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of living Osmundaceae to the extant species is much smaller than the distances between the Osmundaceae-MRCA and the Osmundaceae root and between the Osmundaceae-MRCA and -tips and the roots/tips of Marattiales (having diverged earlier) and Hymenophyllaceae (having diverged later; PPG I, 2016; Testo & Sundue, 2016). In such a case, ingroup–outgroup (long) branching artefacts and accordingly misplaced ingroup roots may be inevitable. Thus, we see no reason to not recognize Osmundinae as holophyletic (Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; Grimm et al., 2015). With respect to axis anatomy, the signals from the few but consistent traits that differentiate members of Millerocaulis, Todeinae and Osmundinae appear to become outcompeted by signals from convergent traits. Moreover, some early members of Osmundinae (especially of Claytosmunda) lack the derived features typical of its modern relatives, and have many presumably primitive traits shared with species of Millerocaulis. Consequently, pairwise distances between (early) members of the Osmundinae and of Millerocaulis can be smaller than those within each lineage, which may explain the poor support for an Osmundinae clade and the Osmundastrum- and Osmunda-lineages (Table 3).\n\nIn the case of Osmundinae and its genera, the practical advantage of an “evolutionary” classification (Figs. 8G and 8H) in contrast to a strict “cladistic” classification (Figs. 8D and 8E) becomes vital. Even if unambiguous fossil evidence should prove that Todeinae evolved from an Osmundinae-like ancestor and confirm the outgroup-defined root, Osmundinae can remain valid and usable as a well-defined paraphyletic taxon. A cladistic classification, on the other hand, would require major taxonomic changes: in addition to rejecting the subtribe subdivision, many early Osmundinae axes would need to remain nameless (see comments below for each genus).\n\nWe follow PPG I (2016) in recognising four genera in the Osmundinae, which have mostly been treated as subgenera of Osmunda. Even though this subdivision is supported also by vegetative and reproductive features and by molecular data (see Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015), all four genera can be diagnosed and well distinguished solely on the basis of axis anatomy. Three of the genera are (likely) holophyletic (Osmundastrum, Osmunda, Plenasium), whereas Claytosmunda, which probably represents the most primitive suite of axis anatomical characters (see Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015), is monotypic today but paraphyletic when fossils are included.\n\n2.2.3.2.1\n\nGenus Claytosmunda (Y.Yatabe, N.Murak. & K.Iwats.) Metzgar & Rouhan, 2016\n\nDiagnostic axis characters: Stem core a primarily parenchymatous pith. Stelar xylem siphon typically thin (up to 15, rarely up to 20 tracheids in radial thickness) and with prominent leaf gaps. Leaf protoxylem poles initiating in mesarch position in stele, becoming endarch in stele or (rarely) in cortex, first bifurcating in outermost cortex or outside the stem. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder; outer stem cortex homogeneous, thicker than inner stem cortex. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings commonly containing strands of thick-walled fibers of various shapes and sizes; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped). Stipe sclerenchyma ring heterogeneous with an abaxial arch of particularly thick-walled fibers that may further develop into two opposite, separate or thinly connected lateral masses.\n\nStatus: Partly ancestral (paraphyletic per definition) to Osmunda, Plenasium, and possibly Osmundastrum; extant with fossil representatives.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Middle Triassic to present.\n\nComments: In a previous phylogenetic analysis with fewer characters and fewer operational units, we concluded that “[…] a subdivision into two putatively monophyletic subgenera Osmunda sensu Yatabe et al. and Claytosmunda generates two taxa without discriminating anatomical and morphological features” (Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015: 15f). Based on the more comprehensive analysis of structural and morphological characters in Osmundales presented here, however, we agree that species of Claytosmunda are in fact distinguishable from the remaining Osmunda species based on the combination of (italicized) anatomical characters as outlined above. The plesiomorphic features of Claytosmunda include the protoxylem division occurring only outside the stem (shared with Osmundastrum) and the sporadic occurrence of mesarch leaf traces in the inner or rarely outer cortex (the one prominent difference between Claytosmunda beardmorensis and Claytosmunda claytoniana, as far as the two species can be compared). The main diagnostic rhizome trait is the composition of the heterogenous sclerenchymatic ring in the leaf trace.\n\nSeveral fossils currently included in Millerocaulis are here formally transferred to Claytosmunda. In most cases, the similarity and inferred relationship of each of these species to Osmundinae in general and to genus Claytosmunda in particular (i.e., including also some species of Osmunda sensu Miller, 1971) has already been suggested by the original authors in the respective comparative discussion. For example, having noted the remarkable similarity of Osmunda plumites to Claytosmunda claytoniana, Tian and colleagues noted that the species “[…] should also be a member of this paraphyly” (Tian et al., 2014a: 217). Also Claytosmunda chengii, Claytosmunda preosmunda, Claytosmunda sinica, Claytosmunda tekelili, and Claytosmunda wangii were immediately interpreted to be close relatives and possible precursors of Claytosmunda claytoniana, the only extant representative of the genus (Cheng & Li, 2007: 258; Cheng, Wang & Li, 2007: 1357f.; Cheng, 2011: 102; Vera, 2012: 43; Tian et al., 2014b). Precursors of the remaining lineages Osmunda, Plenasium, and, possibly, Osmundastrum would probably be diagnosed as members of Claytosmunda. The paraphyletic nature of species with Claytosmunda-rhizome anatomy is well represented in the neighbour-net, where species included in this genus occupy positions between the better defined (morphologically more distinct) genera of the Osmundinae (Fig. 16; or Osmundeae: Figs. 11, 13 and 15). Claytosmunda is more or less equally similar to all other members of Osmundeae and shows no apparent preference toward any extant species. Accordingly, no member of Claytosmunda, including the extant Claytosmunda claytoniana, would be supported as a member of a clearly defined clade (BSML/LS/MP ≤ 10; File S3; see the BS support networks in Grimm, Bomfleur & McLoughlin (2017) available from Dryad Digital Repository http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.270gs).\n\nAlthough Claytosmunda nathorstii from the Paleogene of Svalbard is known only from isolated stipes and was thus excluded from the phylogenetic analyses owing to it lacking too many characters, the species is clearly allied with Claytosmunda based on its characteristic stipe structure with two lateral masses of thick-walled fibers in the sclerenchyma cylinder and with an elongate mass of fibers in each stipular wing (Miller, 1967).\n\nIncluded species:\n\nC. claytoniana (L., 1753) Metzgar & Rouhan, 2016 (Extant: East Asia and eastern North America).\n\n(†) C. beardmorensis (J.M.Schopf, 1978) comb. nov.

We also include another pre-Cretaceous species in Osmundastrum, Osmundastrum indentatum, which is less derived and, as a consequence, overall more similar to the basic type within Osmundinae as seen in members of Claytosmunda and Osmunda (to some degree), and accordingly placed in the neighbour-nets.\n\nOsmundastrum precinnamomeum from the Paleocene of North America (Miller, 1967) is more distinct from extant Osmundastrum cinnamomeum than other specimens that have been included in the latter species, thus we accept is as a separate species. Whether (some) fossil Osmundastrum cinnamomeum are better treated as distinct species requires a better understanding of the extant diversity in this species. We note that the diversity evident in the fossils is as high or higher than between species of other (extinct and extant) genera (see also File S3); a Osmundastrum cinnamomeum-only clade would receive low or diminishing support. Overall these modern-type Osmundastrum rhizomes (Osmundastrum cinnamomeum, Osmundastrum precinnamomeum) nevertheless form a coherent group distinct from other Osmundinae or Osmundoideae; a corresponding clade would receive moderate support under ML and LS (low under MP; Table 3). Osmundastrum pulchellum (Bomfleur, G.W.Grimm & McLoughlin) comb. nov. from the Lower Jurassic of Sweden is a probable precursor of modern Osmundastrum, which ranges from the Late Cretaceous onwards (Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015). Hence, we include it in this holophyletic genus, even though it lacks the fiber patch adaxial to each leaf trace that is characteristic of the modern members. The intermediate, bridging nature of this fossil is also apparent in the neighbour-nets provided here, where it consistently occupies a position between modern Osmundastrum and early representatives with putatively primitive axis anatomy as seen in early Claytosmunda. This placement underscores its great similarity to its more derived congeners (MD ≥ 0.08) and to early members of the Claytosmunda–Osmunda(–Plenasium) lineage (MD ≥ 0.10). If forced into a tree, Osmundastrum pulchellum would be placed close to modern Osmundastrum (Table 3; see also BS support networks in Grimm, Bomfleur & McLoughlin (2017) available from Dryad Digital Repository http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.270gs), as expected for an early member of this lineage.\n\nMolecular dating using the frond fossil record confirms a Triassic split between Osmundastrum and the remainder of the Osmundinae (Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; Grimm et al., 2015). Triassic Osmundaceae fossils include Osmundinae rhizomes with a heterogenous sclerenchyma ring in the leaf traces, usually exhibiting the pattern typical of many Jurassic Osmundinae and the extant Claytosmunda claytoniana. An exception is Australosmunda indentata (Hill, Forsyth & Green, 1989), which has the typical Osmundastrum configuration. In other aspects (e.g., stele dissection), this species is most similar to the Jurassic Claytosmunda embreii, and to a lesser degree, Claytosmunda sinica and Claytosmunda preosmunda; corresponding clades would receive low but consistent support based on our matrices (Table 3). Given the high conservatism and diagnostic value of the organization of the heterogenous sclerenchyma ring in all extant members of Osmundaceae (Osmundeae; see, e.g., Hewitson, 1962; Miller, 1967, 1971; Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; this study), we nevertheless regard Millerocaulis indentata as an early member of the Osmundastrum lineage. We consider its association with early Claytosmunda spp. in the graphs to be a methodological artefact due to the dominance of shared primitive (such as a nearly imperforate stele and commonly mesarch basal leaf traces) or generally homoplastic features encoded in our matrix among the earliest members of both lineages within Osmundinae (compare also the neighbour-nets with potential tree, BS-best supported topologies). This example cautions that classification of fossil taxa should always consider the actual traits shared or not by two taxa resolved as potential sisters in trees or grouped in networks. A further hint to the existence of two already differentiated, modern lineages in the Triassic is the higher diversity between the Triassic Osmundinae species (MD = 0.14 between the purported sister species Osmundastrum indentatum and Claytosmunda embreii; MD = 0.42 between Claytosmunda beardmorensis and Osmundastrum indentatum) in comparison to the situation from the Jurassic onwards (e.g., MD ≥ 0.08 vs. ≥ 0.10 between Osmundastrum pulchellum and other Osmundastrum or Claytosmunda/Osmunda).\n\nIncluded species:\n\nO. cinnamomeum (L.)

According to a recent molecular dating that makes use of the entire rhizome and frond fossil record of modern Osmundaceae, the Claytosmunda claytoniana-lineage diverged from the Osmunda–Plenasium lineage sometime in the Jurassic (Bomfleur, Grimm & McLoughlin, 2015; Grimm et al., 2015), with Osmunda and Plenasium separating in the Cretaceous. Thus, Jurassic and younger Osmundinae fossils likely represent members of either the Claytosmunda claytoniana lineage or the Osmunda–Plenasium lineage. However, Paleogene fossils (Osmunda oregonensis, Osmunda pluma) still appear intermediate between extant members of Osmunda and Claytosmunda in their development of leaf trace protoxylem and development of fibre masses in the sclerenchyma ring. This is also well reflected by their intermediate position in the neighbour-nets. Some fossil axes show the modern Osmunda feature of the leaf trace protoxylem dividing already in the inner cortex, but also the retention of just two separate lateral fibre masses in the sclerenchyma ring instead of an adaxial arch, as is typical of Claytosmunda. Hence, we restrict Osmunda to only those species that have the adaxial arch in the sclerenchyma ring, and retain other early potential members of the Osmunda-lineage in Claytosmunda until more explicit phylogenetic hypotheses can be presented.\n\nIncluded species:\n\nO. japonica Thunb., 1780 (Extant: East Asia).\n\nO. lancea Thunb., 1784 (Extant: East Asia).\n\nO. regalis L., 1753 (Extant: eastern North to eastern South America, Europe, Asia, Southern Africa).\n\n(†) O. ilianensis C.N.Mill., 1967 (Miocene: Hungary, Austria).\n\n(†) O. oregonensis (C.A.Arnold) C.N.Mill., 1967 (Eocene: Oregon, USA).\n\n(†) O. pluma C.N.Mill., 1967 (Paleocene: North Dakota, USA).\n\n(†) O. shimokawaensis M.Matsumoto & H.Nishida, 2003 (Miocene: Hokkaido, Japan).\n\nReferences: Arnold (1945, 1952), Bower (1926), Faull (1901), Gwynne-Vaughan (1911), Hewitson (1962), Kidston & Gwynne-Vaughan (1907, 1910), Matsumoto & Nishida (2003), Miller (1967, 1971) and Unger (1854).\n\n2.2.3.2.4\n\nPlenasium C.Presl, 1836\n\nDiagnostic stem characters: Stem core a primarily parenchymatous pith.

Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder; outer stem cortex homogeneous, thicker than inner stem cortex. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings typically containing a single or numerous distinct masses, commonly in elongate shape or arrangement; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped). Stipe sclerenchyma ring heterogeneous, differentiating distally into a thin band of particularly thick-walled fibres forming the outer margin of the sclerenchyma ring.\n\nStatus: Possibly ancestral (paraphyletic per definition) to subgenus Plenasium; extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Early Cretaceous to ?mid-Eocene.\n\nComments: Since Aurealcaulis was established (Tidwell & Parker, 1987), it has been considered fundamentally different from other Osmundaceae because of its allegedly exarch leaf trace protoxylem and its leaf traces arising in the form of two separate masses. The first feature is plainly a misidentification: the putative “protoxylem cells” that would render trace formation exarch (see arrow in fig. 17 of Tidwell & Parker, 1987) are only smaller metaxylem cells at the stele periphery, just as in the stelar xylem of any other osmundaceous fern. The centre-left of the same figure shows a stelar xylem segment with an actual protoxylem pole in mesarch position.\n\nThe second feature is that a given leaf trace usually arises in the form of two separate segments—each with one inward-facing protoxylem pole—that fuse into one C-shaped segment inside the cortex only at some distance from the stele. This seemingly unique feature, however, is merely an extreme form of the mode of leaf trace formation represented in Plenasium. In extant Plenasium species, the tips of the two meristele segments first fuse with each other and then separate from the stele in the form of a single, deeply C-shaped trace (Miller, 1971). The Eocene Plenasium arnoldii and Plenasium dowkeri are somewhat intermediate in that curvature of the basal leaf trace is so strong and the thickness of the strand so uneven that they adopt a curved-dumbbell shape, with two thick xylem segments connected only by a thin band of tracheids (see, e.g., Chandler, 1965: figs. 3, 4, 6, 7 and 17; Arnold, 1952: figs. 13, 14 and 16). In fact, a few leaf traces appear to depart from the stele in the typical Aurealcaulis manner, i.e., in the form of two completely separate segments (see, e.g., Chandler, 1965: figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, basal leaf traces of Aurealcaulis arise sporadically in the form of a deeply indented, but nonetheless intact C-shaped strand just like those typical of Plenasium chandleri and Plenasium arnoldii. This type of leaf trace formation is indeed common enough that Tidwell and Parker referred to it as “the other type of trace formation” in the original description of Aurealcaulis (Tidwell & Parker, 1987: 807). Hence, the supposedly unique mode of trace formation in Aurealcaulis is one end member of a spectrum that also encompasses forms typical of extinct and, to a lesser degree, extant Plenasium species.\n\nAnother problematic diagnostic feature relates to the heterogeneity of cells in the stipe sclerenchyma ring—the distinctive feature of all “modern” Osmundoideae. Most recent taxonomic treatments of fossil Osmundaceae have adopted characters from the original publication without critical appraisal: e.g., that the sclerotic ring in Aurealcaulis petioles were homogeneous (Tidwell & Parker, 1987: 805; see, e.g., Tian, Wang & Jiang, 2008; Wang et al., 2014a, 2014b). However, Cheng and Li (2007) already noted that the stipe sclerenchyma ring of Aurealcaulis has a heterogeneous composition. Tidwell & Parker (1987: 809) wrote in their original description “the cells comprising this ring are generally uniform in size (50–70 μm in diam.) and wall thickness (10–25 μm). However, a layer of fibres near the edge of the sclerotic ring is much thicker-walled and appears to be more resistant to decay than the remainder of the ring” (Tidwell & Parker, 1987: 809). We consider this to represent just different phraseology for describing the type of heterogeneous sclerenchyma ring that occurs in Plenasium: “While the sclerenchyma ring of the petiole base appears homogeneous in species of Plenasium, there is a very thin abaxial arch of thick-walled fibres visible in transverse sections near the stem. In sections more distant from the stem, the ring is completely surrounded by a narrow layer of these cells, and this situation persists throughout the stipular region” (Miller, 1967: 181)—or, alternatively: “thick-walled fibres in sclerenchyma ring thin near attachment to stem extending to surround ring as a narrow band in lower one-third of stipular region” (Miller, 1971: 31).\n\nFinally, Aurealcaulis has been described to differ from all other Osmundaceae in that its roots arise directly from the trace and not from the stele (Tidwell & Parker, 1987: 811). However, this is the regular mode of root formation in other Osmundaceae (Bower, 1926; Hewitson, 1962; Miller, 1967, 1971).\n\nWith these supposed differences revised, we identify Aurealcaulis as being: (1) a typical member of Osmundaceae with mesarch protoxylem in the stem and endarch protoxylem in the leaf traces; (2) a member of Osmundeae (modern Osmundoideae) with a heterogeneous stipe sclerenchyma ring similar to those of Todea, Leptopteris, and Plenasium; (3) an extinct member of Osmundinae owing to its homogeneous outer cortex (unlike Todeinae; Tidwell & Medlyn, 1991); and (4) a close relative and possible ancestor of extant species of Plenasium owing to their peculiar similarities of having two protoxylem initials per leaf trace, leaf traces arising in the form of two separate or thinly connected deeply indented masses, and a similar type of development of the sclerenchyma ring.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) P. bransonii (Tidwell & Medlyn, 1991) comb. nov.

Stelar xylem siphon thin (usually up to ca 15 tracheids in radial thickness) and with prominent leaf gaps; leaf protoxylem poles initiating in mesarch position in stele, becoming endarch in stele; leaf trace strongly curved adaxially upon departure from stele, usually arising with two protoxylem strands from two adjacent stelar xylem segments. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder; outer stem cortex homogeneous, thicker than inner stem cortex. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings typically containing numerous, small scattered strands of thick-walled fibres; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped). Stipe sclerenchyma ring heterogeneous, differentiating distally into a thin band of particularly thick-walled fibres forming the outer margin of the sclerenchyma ring.\n\nStatus: Holophyletic; extant with fossil representatives.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Paleocene to present.\n\nIncluded species:\n\nP. banksiifolium (C.Presl) C.Presl, 1836 (Extant: East and Southeast Asia).\n\nP. bromeliifolium (C.Presl) C.Presl, 1836 (Extant: East and Southeast Asia).\n\nP. javanicum (Blume) C.Presl, 1848 (Extant: Southeast Asia).\n\nP. vachelii C.Presl, 1848 (Extant: Southeast Asia).\n\n(†) P. arnoldii (C.N.Mill., 1967), comb. nov.

Information on axis anatomy is at present inadequate to determine whether these two species are better assigned to subgenus Plenasium or subgenus Aurealcaulis.

Tidwell, 1986\n\n(Fig. 17)\n\nDiagnostic characters: Axes usually arborescent or erect, rarely rhizomatous. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder; inner stem cortex thicker than outer stem cortex. Peripheral xylem siphon with prominent leaf gaps, very thick (typically >30 tracheids in radial thickness), commonly highly perforated (except Osmundacaulis lemonii, Osmundacaulis nerii, Osmundacaulis tidwellii, and Osmundacaulis whittlesii); phloem external and internal and sporadically connecting through leaf gaps (i.e., dictyostelic). Leaf trace protoxylem initially single and in mesarch position in stele, in most cases dividing repeatedly in stele and inner cortex (except Osmundacaulis bamfordae); leaf trace strongly curved already upon departure from stele. Stipes with a pair of stipular wings; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., horseshoe-shaped).\n\nStatus: Putatively holophyletic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Jurassic to Cretaceous.\n\nComments: Osmundacaulis is clearly distinct from other Osmundaceae in having an inner cortex that is thicker than the outer cortex, in having very thick and typically highly perforated stelar metaxylem cylinders, and in having leaf traces that are already strongly curved at the point of departure from the stele. These features served to distinguish first the species Osmundites skidegatensis Penh. (see Kidston & Gwynne-Vaughan, 1908) and later the “Osmundacaulis skidegatensis group” (Miller, 1971) that subsequently formed Osmundacaulis Miller emend. Tidwell as currently understood. Osmundacaulis contains a disparate array of morphologically distinct species that, analogous to Millerocaulis, are transitional from having highly perforated steles (e.g., Osmundacaulis skidegatensis) to only a few (e.g., Osmundacaulis nerii, Osmundacaulis tidwellii), or no perforations at all (Osmundacaulis lemonii).\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) O. andrewii Tidwell & Pigg, 1993 (?Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\n(†) O. atherstonei (Schelpe) C.N.Mill., 1971 (Early Cretaceous: South Africa).\n\n(†) O. bamfordae R.Herbst, 2015 (Early Cretaceous: South Africa).\n\n(†) O. griggsii Tidwell & Pigg, 1993 (Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\n(†) O. hoskingii R.E.Gould, 1973 (Middle Jurassic: Queensland, Australia).\n\n(†) O. janae Tidwell & Pigg, 1993 (Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\n(†) O. jonesii Tidwell, 1987 (Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\n(†) O. lemonii Tidwell, 1990 (Late Jurassic: Utah, USA).\n\n(†) O. natalensis (Schelpe) C.N.Mill., 1971 (Early Cretaceous: South Africa).\n\n(†) O. nerii Tidwell & Ross Jones, 1987 (Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\n(†) O. pruchnickii Tidwell & Pigg, 1993 (Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\n(†) O. richmondii Tidwell & Pigg, 1993 (Early Jurassic: Tasmania, Australia).\n\n(†) O. skidegatensis (Penh.)

Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner, primarily parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder; inner stem cortex much thicker than outer stem cortex, containing numerous (up to 60) leaf traces in a given transverse section. Peripheral xylem siphon with sporadic narrow, complete leaf gaps, thin (typically ca 10 cells in radial thickness). Leaf trace strongly curved upon departure from stele, containing three protoxylem clusters in inner cortex.\n\nStatus: Monotypic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian.\n\nComments: The precise systematic affinities of Shuichengella primitiva within Osmundaceae are unknown. However, it is notable that the genus shares some rather unusual characters with Osmundacaulis, e.g., an inner cortex that is much thicker than the outer cortex, and the strong curvature and multiple protoxylem clusters of leaf traces already differentiated upon departure from the stele. Li (1993) instituted the subfamily Shuichengelloideae for the monotypic genus; however, considering that, for instance, important information on stipe anatomy is lacking (see Tidwell & Ash, 1994) and that insufficient comparison can be made with other taxa, we consider Shuichengella to be too poorly known to warrant erection of a separate subfamily.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) S. primitiva (Z.M.Li) Z.M.Li, 1993 (Late Permian: Guizhou, China).\n\nReferences: Li (1983, 1993) and Tidwell & Ash (1994).\n\n2.?.3\n\n(†) Genus Anomorrhoea Eichw., 1860\n\nStatus: Nomen dubium, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian.\n\nComments: The holotype is a fragment of the mantle of roots and stipe bases with a small portion of outer cortex attached; stele, inner cortex, and most of the outer cortex is missing. It is, thus, too fragmentary to be identified with certainty (Kidston & Gwynne-Vaughan, 1909; Zalessky, 1927; Miller, 1971). The sclerotic outer cortex and prominent stipular wings indicate affinities with Osmundaceae, but the lack of information on the stem core composition makes it impossible to determine whether, for example, the genus belongs to Osmundoideae or to Thamnopteroideae. We propose that use of the name should be abandoned until better and more completely preserved material enables more detailed comparison.\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) A. fischeri Eichw., 1860 (Late Permian: Russia; here considered Osmundaceae gen. indet.).\n\nReferences. Kidston & Gwynne-Vaughan (1909), Zalessky (1927) and Miller (1971).\n\n2.?.4\n\n(†) Genus Bathypteris Eichw., 1860\n\nDiagnostic characters: Stems forming large, arborescent trunks. Stem core consisting of tracheids with scalariform thickenings. Peripheral metaxylem siphon entire and imperforate. Cortex of stems and stipes two-layered, differentiated into inner parenchymatous cylinder and outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. Leaf trace protoxylem single. Stipes lacking stipular wings but bearing multicellular spines; stipe bundle with incurved tips (i.e., more or less horseshoe-shaped), surrounded by sclerotic cells that form a narrow lining band. Sclerenchyma ring in stipe base circular to elliptic in cross-section, homogenous.\n\nStatus: Monotypic, extinct.\n\nKnown geochronologic range: Late Permian.\n\nComments: The affinities of Bathypteris cannot be determined precisely; it has a two-layered cortex and horseshoe-shaped stipe bundle typical of Osmundaceae, but its petiole surfaces bear multicellular spines instead of the characteristic stipular wings—a feature otherwise known only from Itopsidema among Osmundales (Daugherty, 1960).\n\nIncluded species:\n\n(†) B. rhomboidalis (S.Kutorga) Eichw., 1860 (Late Permian: Russia)."
