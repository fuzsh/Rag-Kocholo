        "text": "Taxa descriptions\n\nCerinomycetaceae Jülich, Bibliotheca Mycologica 85: 358 (1981).\n\nA monotypic family in the class Dacrymycetes, consists of the genus Cerinomyces.\n\nCerinomyces G.W. Martin, Mycologia 41: 82 (1949).\n\nTypus: Cerinomyces pallidus G.W. Martin, Mycologia 41: 83 (1949).\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps either arid and corticioid or gelatinous and pustulate, pulvinate, and resupinate; colour from white to ochraceous, pale yellow, brown, and dark brown. Basidiocarps monomitic, consist of hymenium and supporting structure (subiculum), some species have a distinct margin. Hymenium amphigenous, hymenial surface either smooth or in some corticioid species bears hyphal pegs. Hyphae transparent, smooth, hyphal width and wall thickness can vary inside a single basidiocarp, wall gelatinization occurs in many species, gelatinous layer sometimes roughened. Clamps present on each septum except occasional clampless secondary septa inside basidia. Clamps mostly simple, loop-like clamps can occur in subicular areas. Hymenium includes basidia and, in some species, hyphidia with thickened base and thinner cylindrical apical part, which is either branched or simple. Hyphidia of the second type tend to organize in hyphal pegs. Mature basidia long-clavate, with two subulate sterigmata. Basidia occasionally bear one or rarely three sterigmata. Basidiospores cylindrical to curved-cylindrical, aseptate or rarely with up to three transverse septa in few species, walls thin and smooth, contents usually hyaline, germination with germ tubes or subglobose to cylindrical conidia.\n\nHabitat: decayed, usually decorticated wood of gymnosperm and angiosperm trees and shrubs. According to our observations, cause brown rot.\n\nDistribution: Occur worldwide in forested areas, as follows (informal taxa not listed). Africa: C. albosporus. Asia: C. aculeatus, C. curvisporus, C. enatus, C. enterolaxus, C. nepalensis, C. pinguis. Australia and Oceania: C. fasciculatus, C. inermis, C. verecundus. Europe: C. aeneus, C. borealis, C. creber, C. crustulinus, C. lipoferus, C. neuhoffii, C. tortus, C. volaticus. North America: C. atrans, C. cokeri, C. enatus, C. favonius, C. fugax, C. hesperidis, C. pallidus, C. tristis. South and Central America: C. brevisetus, C. concretus, C. paulistanus, C. ramosissimus.\n\nCerinomyces aculeatus N.

Maekawa (holotype TUMH61942! ex TMI794, ex-type culture TUFC50098∗).\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arid, originate as patches of white mycelium, coalesce into seamless formations up to 5 cm in the longest dimension. Hymenial surface first arachnoid, then solid, light ochraceous to buff; subiculum light ochraceous, cottony; margin similar to subiculum or arachnoid if present. In older areas hymenium cracked, brownish. Basidiocarps covered with hyphal pegs up to 300 μm in length. Hyphae clamped, gelatinized, in subiculum 2–4(–5) μm in diam, with walls 0.5–1.2 μm in width. Subhymenial hyphae of the same diam, with walls 0.3–0.7 μm in width. Hyphal pegs consist of parallel hyphae, 2–5 μm in diam, walls 0.5–1.5 μm in width, thicker in the base and core of peg. Hymenium composed of basidia and hyphidia. Hyphidia with thick-walled clavate base up to 11 μm in diam and simple cylindrical thin-walled apical part; occasional or in groups developing into hyphal pegs. Basidia clavate, 12–46 × 3–7 μm, with sterigmata up to 29(–66) μm in length (n = 115/4), basidial walls sometimes thickened at the base. Basidiospores slightly curved-cylindrical, 0–1(–3)-septate, (9.7–)10.5–17.2(–17.7) × 4.0–6.5(–7.4) μm, L = 13.8 μm, W = 5.0 μm, Q = 2.8, Q’ = 1.7–3.5 (n = 121/4), walls ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm (Pinus) and perhaps angiosperm wood; East Asia.\n\nMaterial examined: Japan, Honshu, Chūbu reg., Nagano pref., Sugadairakougen, on Pinus densiflora, 18 Aug. 2006, T. Shirouzu HNo.478 (TNS-F-21063); Kansai reg., Kyoto pref., Mt. Daimonji, on P. densiflora, 20 Apr. 2006, T. Shirouzu HNo.191 (TNS-F-15706∗).

Viner КЮН1422 (reads “KUN1422”, H7008652), КЮН2396 (TU135069∗), КЮН2417 (TU135070∗).\n\nNotes: The species was synonymized with C. albosporus shortly after description (Maekawa & Zang 1997). The two species are related, but clearly different in the ITS sequences, basidiocarp appearance, spore size, and distribution. Maekawa (1987) provided a detailed study on the cultural characteristics of the species, showing that young basidiospores are binucleate, and when deposited on MEA, aseptate basidiospores develop one to four transverse septa before or rarely after germination. He also described curved-cylindrical conidia 3.6–5.6 × 1.2–1.6 μm produced from hyphae in monokaryotic culture and pictured basidiospores with conidiogenous scars. Shirouzu et al. (2009) reported subglobose conidia born from basidiospores, measuring 6 × 3 μm.\n\nCerinomyces aff. aculeatus 1. , .\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps at first arachnoid, then turning into smooth brownish thin film, waxy and semitransparent when wet, in better developed (or preserved) areas more arid, solid and light ochraceous. Hyphal pegs absent. Hyphae clamped, subicular hyphae 2–4 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width; in subhymenium 2–3 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.4 μm in width. Hymenium simple, basidia clavate, 11–20 × 3–4.5 μm, with sterigmata up to 23 μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, 0–1-septate, 9.5–11.3(–11.5) × (3.2–)3.3–4.4(–4.5) μm, L = 10.5 μm, W = 3.7 μm, Q = 2.8, Q’ = 2.4–3.3 (n = 30/1), walls ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width. Basidiospores produce cylindrical conidia 2.2–2.6 × 1.2–1.3 μm.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Pinus); East Asia.\n\nMaterial examined: Taiwan, Taipei, Peitou dist., on Pinus luchuensis, 17 Jul. 1999, R. Kirschner 542 (TNM:{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"F16565\",\"term_id\":\"4823785\"}}F16565∗).\n\nNotes: The taxon belongs to the C. albosporus clade by similarity in LSU sequences, but we postpone a formal description until more markers are sequenced or new material found. The most similar LSU sequence was obtained from a Japanese environmental sample 05151-1B2 (Shirouzu et al. 2016). For the same Taiwanese material, Kirschner & Yang (2005) reported sporothrix-like conidiogenesis in culture, with curved-cylindrical conidia < 5 μm in length.\n\nCerinomyces aeneus A.

Ordynets (holotype H7009708∗!, isotypes CWU(MYC)7500!, UPS!).\n\nEtymology: aeneus (Lat.) — bronze, referring to the colour of basidiocarps.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps gelatinous, first pustulate, then coalesce into smooth to densely cerebriform resupinate formations up to several cm in the longest dimension, light brownish yellow at margins, reddish brown in the center, becoming almost black when dried. Some pustulate basidiocarps can remain isolated outside of these formations. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum (1.5–)2–3.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width, gelatinized, sometimes roughened, often agglutinated. Subhymenial hyphae 1.5–3 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width. Marginal hyphae simple cylindrical or slightly clavate up to 4 μm in diam, rarely branched, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Hymenium includes abundant branched cylindrical hyphidia, in base 2–2.5 μm in diam, with apical part 1–2 μm in diam. Basidia clavate, 16–38 × 2–6 μm. Sterigmata up to 24(–35) μm in length (n = 57/3). Basidiospores cylindrical to slightly curved-cylindrical, 0(–1)-septate, at least some binucleate, (7.9–)8.1–11.2(–13.0) × (2.7–)3.0–4.5(–5.0) μm, L = 9.5 μm, W = 3.8 μm, Q = 2.5, Q’ = 1.9–3.5 (n = 176/5), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Angiosperm wood (Alnus, Carpinus, Fagus, Quercus, and unident.); Europe.\n\nMaterial examined: Czech Republic, Vysočina reg., Jihlava dist., near Třešť, Velký Špičák Nature Reserve, on Fagus sylvatica, 28 Oct. 2011, M.

Kit (CWU(MYC)7035).\n\nNotes: The species was traditionally identified as Dacrymyces enatus (≡ C. enatus). Cerinomyces aeneus develops resupinate basidiocarps and grows only on angiosperm, typically decorticated wood in Europe, while C. enatus produces mostly pulvinate or rarely resupinate basidiocarps and occurs on both angiosperm and gymnosperm wood with bark in North America and East Asia. Cerinomyces crustulinus and C. aff. crustulinus 1, similar European taxa growing on angiosperm substrates, have basidiocarps of different, lighter colour. Also, in contrast to C. enatus, in these species outlines of separate pustules remain visible even in mature basidiocarps.\n\nCerinomyces albosporus Boidin & Gilles, Bulletin de la Société Mycologique de France 102 (3): 318 (1986). , .\n\nTypus: France, Réunion, Saint-Benoît dept., Forêt de Bébour, on Senecio ambavilla, 8 May 1985, J. Boidin (holotype LY11692∗!).\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arid, originate as circular patches of white mycelium that develops into thick cottony subiculum. Above the subiculum, hymenial surface arachnoid to solid, light ochraceous to buff, covered with abundant hyphal pegs up to 500 μm in height; margin irregular, white, fimbriate. In well-developed areas surface cracks showing darker, brownish hymenium and subhymenium, and lighter subiculum. Hyphae clamped, densely packed, in subiculum 2–5 μm in diam, walls 0.5–1.0 μm in width; in subhymenium of the same diam, walls 0.4–0.8 μm in width. Hyphal pegs consist of parallel hyphae, 2.5–3 μm in diam, with wall width of 0.5 μm at the top and sides of peg, thicker at the base and in the core. Hymenium composed of basidia and occasional cylindrical hyphidia, simple or, rarely, branched at the apical part, walls thin, only thickened at the base; usually occurring in groups that develop into hyphal pegs. Basidia clavate, 25–62 × 3–6.5 μm, with sterigmata up to 20 μm in length (n = 30/1), basidial walls sometimes thickened at the base. Basidiospores slightly curved-cylindrical, 0–1(–3)-septate, (11.8–)12.0–17.8(–18.0) × (5.0–)5.2–7.0(–7.1) μm, L = 15.3 μm, W = 6.0 μm, Q = 2.6, Q’ = 1.8–3.3 (n = 34/1), spore walls ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width. Basidiospores bear cylindrical conidia 3.1–4.1 × 1.8–2.1 μm.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Angiosperm shrub (Senecio); Africa (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: The species has the most robust basidiocarps and the largest basidiospores among the peg-bearing Cerinomyces species. Three-septate basidiospores are extremely rare and most easy to find in substrate scrapes made next to basidiocarps.\n\nCerinomyces atrans A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Hallenberg 7309 (holotype GB-0071218∗!, isotype UBC:F1032!).\n\nEtymology: atrans (Lat.) — darkening; due to a brown colour of well-developed basidiocarp areas.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arachnoid, arid and light ochraceous, in older areas smooth, solid, crustose, slightly waxy when wet, dark ochraceous to brown, especially in prominent or bruised areas; with thin subiculum and indistinct arachnoid margins. Hyphae clamped, subicular hyphae 2–3.5 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.5 μm in width, gelatinous layer up to 4 μm in width; in subhymenium 2–3 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width. Hymenium includes hyphidia, simple, cylindrical or with slightly thickened base, with apical part ∼ 2 μm in diam, up to 100 μm in total length; sometimes agglutinated, more abundant closer to margins. Basidia clavate, 13–24 × 3–4.5 μm, with sterigmata up to 21 μm in length (n = 40/2). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, (6.7–)6.9–10.8(–11.1) × (2.3–)2.4–3.9(–4) μm, L = 8.8 μm, W = 3.1 μm, Q = 2.9, Q’ = 2.3–3.5 (n = 53/2), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Angiosperm (Alnus and unident.) and possibly gymnosperm wood; Western North America.\n\nMaterial examined: Canada, British Columbia, Vancouver Island, Juan de Fuca reg., Fairy lake near Port Renfrew, 12 Aug. 1988, N.

Forest, Siuslaw National Forest, on Alnus, 11 Oct. 1972, M.J. Larsen (CFMR:FP-133356).\n\nNotes: Older, prominent, and damaged areas of the studied basidiocarps have dark brown tints, but we suppose this character can be absent in young fungi. Compared to C. pallidus, another North American species inhabiting mostly angiosperm wood, C. atrans does not produce hyphal pegs visible to the naked eye, but only microscopic aggregations of hyphidia. When dealing with occurrences on gymnosperm wood, a great attention is needed to distinguish between C. atrans–C. pallidus and exclusively conifers-inhabiting North American species. However, basidiocarps of the latter group do not turn into darkened crust so easily, instead remaining arachnoid or firm-cottony.\n\nAn earlier published ITS sequence of a culture TUFC30545 aligns well with our sequences, though we did not examine its voucher material UBC6108.\n\nCerinomyces borealis Miettinen, Spirin & A.

Subiculum thin and indistinct; hymenium at first irregular, but in well-developed basidiocarps becomes smooth and solid; margin indistinct or absent. Dark brown to black underlying layers of old collapsed basidiocarps sometimes present. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum 2–4 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.5 μm in width, with gelatinous layer up to 1 μm; in subhymenium 2–3 μm in diam, with walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width.

In Nordic herbaria, the majority of the specimens labelled as C. crustulinus belong to C. borealis — e.g., GB-0071198, cited as such in “The Corticiaceae of North Europe” (Eriksson & Ryvarden 1973). The species can be distinguished from similarly looking C. volaticus by longer, thinner basidiospores (mostly ≤ 3.0 μm in width) and the more delicate, arachnoid basidiocarps. Intermediate forms with large basidiospores also occur, but even then, higher Q values of C. borealis still hold.\n\nIn three specimens identified as C. borealis chiefly by the thin basidiospores, we found hyphidia: long cylindrical with thickened bases, typical for the C. pallidus clade (GB-0071209), and branched, either only slightly (GB-0071221), or with knot-like heads, more characteristic for some gelatinous Cerinomyces species (GB-0071210). Sequencing attempts of these specimens were unsuccessful.\n\nCerinomyces brevisetus Chikowski, Alvarenga & A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Chikowski 1544 (holotype URM∗!, isotypes H!, TU135139!).\n\nEtymology: brevi (Lat.) — short; seta (Lat.) — bristle-like organ, peg herein.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arid, at first arachnoid, later mature areas become crustose, covering thin cottony subiculum; hymenial surface solid, light ochraceous, with regular brownish hyphal pegs up to 80 μm in height. Hyphae clamped, subicular hyphae 2–3 μm in diam, walls 0.5–1.0 μm in width; in subhymenium 2–4 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width. Pegs rooted in subiculum, their hyphae parallel and densely arranged, core hyphae similar to subicular, outer hyphae 3.5–4.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.4 μm in width. Hymenium includes rare simple hyphidia with cylindrical or obclavate base and cylindrical long tip; scattered or organized in microscopic pegs. Basidia clavate, 12–23 × 3–5.5 μm, with sterigmata up to 19 μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, 9.3–11.1(–11.7) × 3.5–4.4(–4.6) μm, L = 10.3 μm, W = 3.9 μm, Q = 2.6, Q’ = 2.4–2.9 (n = 30/1), walls ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Unidentified wood; South America (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces brevisetus has the shortest pegs in the genus, which helps to differentiate it from the closest relatives in the C. albosporus group, as well as from the similarly looking C. pallidus and C. paulistanus. In addition, all other members of the C. albosporus clade have longer basidiospores, while the C. pallidus clade is characterized by the shorter ones.\n\nCerinomyces canadensis (H.S. Jacks. & G.W.

In younger areas margins indistinct, arachnoid. Hymenial surface smooth and solid, waxy-gelatinous when fresh, crust-like when dried, from yellow to deep orange colour, in old collections bleaks to pale ochraceous. Hyphae clamped, pseudoclamps occasionally present, subicular hyphae 2–4 μm in diam, walls 0.2–0.3 μm in width; in subhymenium 2–3.5 μm in diam, walls of the same width; marginal hyphae cylindrical, similar to subicular. Hymenium consists of clavate basidia 19–43 × 3–6 μm, with sterigmata up to 31 μm in length (n = 54/3). Basidiospores cylindrical to slightly curved-cylindrical, often with conspicuous lipid droplets, 0–1-septate, (8.5–)9.2–14.7(–16.5) × (4.1–)4.3–6.2(–6.8) μm, L = 11.7 μm, W = 5.1 μm, Q = 2.3, Q’ = 1.6–3.2 (n = 126/4; 75 measured in 1 % KOH), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Abies, Picea, Tsuga, and unident.); East Asia and North America.\n\nMaterial examined: Russia, Krasnoyarsk reg., Yenisey dist., E of mouth of the river Kolchim, on gymnosperm wood, 14 Aug. 1958, E.

USA, Idaho, Bonner co., Trapper Creek, on Tsuga heterophylla, 14 Oct. 2014, V. Spirin 8468 (H∗, UPS).\n\nNotes: The species does not belong to Cerinomyces s.s., but we postpone raising a new synonym (see Discussion). The type material could not be located in TRTC hebarium (S. Margaritescu, 15 Sep. 2016, pers. comm.), but morphology of the studied specimens agrees well with the original concept of Ceracea canadensis. It can be confused with Dacrymyces corticioides, though the latter species possesses larger microstructures, basidiospores with up to three septa and basidiocarps of well-defined circular form. Maekawa (1987) reported ovoid to straight cylindrical conidia born from hyphae in a monokaryotic strain of C. canadensis (CCCM 0194), but we did not check identity of this strain.\n\nUnder pseudoclamp we understand a clamp which development was arrested before the terminal part of a clamp fused with the parental hypha (upper C, three rightmost pictures on D, Clémençon et al. 2004). The character is rather rare in the species but was found in all studied specimens. Sequences from TAAM007082 and TAAM061880 were not used in the analyses, but they are similar to the ITS of Spirin 8468.\n\nCerinomyces cokeri (McNabb) A. Savchenko & J.C. Zamora, comb. nov.

Hyphae clamped, in subiculum 1.5–2.5 μm in diam, walls 1.5–3.0 μm in width together with gelatinous layer; small knots of ramificated hyphae rarely occur; subhymenial hyphae of the same diam, walls 0.2–0.3(–0.5) μm in width; margins covered with simple cylindrical or slightly clavate anastomosing hyphae 1.5–2.5 μm in diam, walls 0.2–0.5 μm in width. Hymenium includes dendroid cylindrical hyphidia with base 2–3.5 μm in diam and apical part 1–2 μm in diam; up to 40 μm in total length. Basidia clavate, 36–60 × 3–6 μm. Sterigmata up to 34 μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores cylindrical to slightly curved-cylindrical, 0(–1)-septate, at least some binucleate, (9.6–)9.7–12.8(–13.0) × (3.4–)3.5–4.6(–5.0) μm, L = 11.2 μm, W = 4.0 μm, Q = 2.8, Q’ = 2.3–3.2 (n = 55/2), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Pinus and unident.); North America.\n\nMaterial examined: Canada, Ontario, Ottawa, on Pinus resinosa, 27 Jan. 2020, I.

Menge 396 (NCSLG21222∗).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces cokeri can be confused with C. enatus, both occuring on coniferous wood with bark. Cerinomyces enatus is generally darker coloured, becoming almost black in dry conditions, while C. cokeri remains dark brown. Also, we did not find in C. cokeri swollen hyphal compartments and such thick gelatinous layer on hyphae as in C. enatus.\n\nCerinomyces concretus A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Reference to a dense hymenium becoming crustose.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arid, crustose, slightly gelatinous when rewetted, with thin subiculum and indistinct margins, hymenial surface smooth and solid but cracking in older areas, of pale ochraceous to yellowish brown colour. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum loose, 1.5–3(–3.5) μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.4(–0.8) μm in width, covered with small crystals (≤ 1 μm) that can cluster in amorphic masses. Subhymenial hyphae of the similar type, densely packed, with occasional swellings. Hymenium includes simple hyphidia of total length up to 70 μm, with thickened clavate base 4–5 μm in diam, and apical cylindrical part 2 μm in diam, up to 50 μm in length, occasionally branched or incrusted with minute crystals. Basidia clavate, 15–28 × 3–6 μm. Sterigmata up to 11(–19) μm in length, widely spaced (n = 30/1). Basidiospores slightly curved-cylindrical, aseptate, (7.7–)7.8–10.5(–12.0) × (3.3–)3.4–4.5(–5.0) μm, L = 9.0 μm, W = 4.0 μm, Q = 2.2, Q’ = 1.9–3.0 (n = 30/1), wall ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Unidentified wood; Central America.\n\nMaterial examined: Venezuela, La Silla, boundary between Distrito Federal and Estado Miranda, 22 Aug. 1975, A.E.

Two species with spore W > 3.5 μm, C. pinguis and C. verecundus, do not overlap with C. concretus in distribution. The type specimen has a slight meruloid pattern under hymenium that may be an evidence of an old, overgrown basidiocarp. A lone 1-septate spore was found in the type.\n\nCerinomyces creber J.C.

Young basidiocarps pale yellow to pale cream, later light brown to greyish brown, becoming brown and dark brown when dried. Internal or marginal areas can look opalescent in well-developed basidiocarps; margin becomes fimbriate upon drying. Hyphae clamped, subicular hyphae 2.5–4.5 μm in diam, walls 0.4–0.8 μm in width; in subhymenium 2–3.5 μm in diam, walls 0.2–0.8 μm in width. Hymenium includes dendroid cylindrical hyphidia with thickened base 2–2.5 μm in diam and branching apical part 1.5–2 μm in diam; up to 50 μm in total length, from rare to abundant in different areas. Basidia clavate, rarely asymmetric, 14–36 × 3–5 μm, with sterigmata up to 18 μm in length (n = 55/2).

Also, it seems that C. creber is confined to Cupressaceae wood (according to the substrates we were able to identify), while all studied specimens of C. neuhoffii were found on Pinus wood. Cerinomyces aff. crustulinus 1 resembles C. creber by macro- and micromorphology but represents a distinct taxon with even paler basidiocarps growing on angiosperm wood. Sequence of UPS:F-979574 was produced during the revision of this study; it was not used in the analyses but matches other included sequences.\n\nCerinomyces crustulinus (Bourdot & Galzin) G.W.

Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, (7.4–)7.7–13.4(–14.0) × 2.8–4.0 μm, L = 9.8 μm, W = 3.3 μm, Q = 3.0, Q’ = 2.1–3.6 (n = 58/2), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Angiosperm wood (Fagus); Europe (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: No dendroid hyphidia were observed in contrast to an earlier report (McNabb 1964). We assume hyphidia were unevenly distributed in basidiocarps and destroyed with past preparations. Among the species described in this revision, the closest morphological relative to C. crustulinus is resupinate C. aeneus that also inhabits angiosperm wood in Europe, but differs in darker cerebriform-resupinate basidiocarps with reddish tint and abundant branched hyphidia. The extremely scanty type material and absence of fresh collections that fully agree with our observations prevent resolution of the exact position of C. crustulinus (but see C. aff. crustulinus 1 below). Roberts (2006) reported the species from Jamaica, and while it does resemble C. crustulinus, the robust gelatinous discoid to coalescing brown basidiocarps with light margins, abundant branched hyphidia, larger spores (11.4–)11.8–13.8(–14.5) × 4.0–5.2(–5.7) μm place it closer to either C. enatus or even members of the Dacrymycetaceae.\n\nCerinomyces aff. crustulinus 1. , .\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps gelatinous, pustulate and gregarious, < 1 mm in diam, readily coalescing into resupinate conglomerate with shapes of separate basidiocarps remaining visible, from yellowish white to light yellow when fresh, light brown when dry. Margin slightly opalescent when fresh and fimbriate when dry. Hyphae clamped; subicular and subhymenial hyphae similar, 2–3.5 μm in diam, walls 0.2–0.3(–0.5) μm in width with gelatinous layer up to 1.5 μm in width; marginal hyphae slightly clavate, sometimes with thinner rarely branching apical part. Hymenium includes abundant dendroid cylindrical hyphidia with base either thickened to 2–4 μm in diam or of the same width as apical branching part of 1.5–2 μm in diam; up to 60 μm in total length. Basidia clavate, 20–49 × 3–5 μm, walls often thickened towards the base, with sterigmata up to 23 μm in length (n = 40/1). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, 0(–1)-septate, at least some apparently binucleate, (8.4–)8.6–10.9(–11.6) × (3.4–)3.4–4.2(–4.2) μm, L = 9.8 μm, W = 3.7 μm, Q = 2.7, Q’ = 2.3–3.0 (n = 45/1), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Angiosperm wood; Europe.\n\nMaterial examined: Spain, Asturias comm., Somiedo, Coto de la Buena Madre, on angiosperm wood, 2 Jun. 2018, E. Rubio 7557 (UPS:F-958851∗).\n\nNotes: The taxon is the closest match to C. crustulinus except for difference in branched hyphidia (but see commentaries on C. crustulinus above about previous report of hyphidia in this species). In absence of additional material, we are inclined to keep this specimen and the type material of C. crustulinus as two separate taxa.\n\nCerinomyces curvisporus N. Maek. & M.

Maekawa 93091618 (holotype HKAS27392!, isotypes TMI-18048, TNS-F-11473!).\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arid, arachnoid on margins and solid in well developed areas, subiculum thin, hymenial surface light ochraceous, covered with regular hyphal pegs up to 300 μm in height. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum 2–3(–5) μm in diam, walls 0.5–1.0 μm in width, with minute crystals; in subhymenium 2.5–5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Internal hyphae in hyphal pegs parallel, similar to subicular, 3.5–5 μm in diam, walls 0.5–1.0 μm in width; at the top 3–5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Hymenium consists of clavate basidia 41–77 × 6–10 μm, with sterigmata up to 34 μm in length (n = 30/1), some probasidia have thickened walls in upper parts. Basidiospores strongly curved-cylindrical, 0(–3)-septate, (16–)16.3–20.0(–20.4) × 5.9–7.1(–7.5) μm, L = 18.4 μm, W = 6.5 μm (n = 30/1), spore walls ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Pinus); Southeast Asia (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: The species is easy to recognize by large, strikingly curved basidiospores. Sequencing was not attempted because the basidiocarp was difficult to separate from another, overgrown corticioid fungus. Judging from abundance of hyphal pegs, C. curvisporus belongs to the C. albosporus group. Septate basidiospores are extremely rare, 1-septate ones were reported in the original description (Maekawa & Zang 1997), and in addition we found a single collapsed 3-septate spore. The longest spore dimension was measured as length. Q values are not shown, being not comparable to other Cerinomyces species with straighter basidiospores.\n\nCerinomyces enatus (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) A. Savchenko, comb. nov.

MycoBank typification MBT10001414.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps gelatinous, variable in shape, pulvinate when young, in maturity most often pustulate, but also slightly cerebriform or flat and resupinate, up to 3(–4) mm in diam, from reddish brown when fresh to dark brown and black when dried; margins of resupinate basidiocarps light yellow and semitransparent. Basidiocarps often grow through holes in bark; when growing on decorticated wood can develop short stalk or, inversely, become resupinate. Light subicular core visible through darker hymenium in well-developed basidiocarps. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum 2–5 μm in diam, walls 0.5–1.0 μm in width, with gelatinous layer up to 6 μm in width, agglutinated, often deeply roughened. Swollen cells abundant in upper subiculum of well-developed basidiocarps, up to 20 μm in diam, with thickened roughened walls. Subhymenial hyphae 2–3.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Sterile surfaces and margins covered with simple cylindrical or attenuating hyphae. Hymenium includes abundant branched cylindrical hyphidia with base ∼3 μm in diam and apical part 1–2 μm in diam; up to 30 μm in total length. Occasional simple, not branched hyphidia up to 50(–100) μm in length present, single or in peg-like groups. Basidia clavate, 13–56 × 3–6.5 μm, with walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Sterigmata up to 27 μm in length (n = 208/9). Basidiospores cylindrical to slightly curved-cylindrical, 0(–1)-septate, (7.0–)7.4–13.2(–14.2) × (2.7–) 2.9–4.5(–5.4) μm, L = 9.5 μm, W = 3.5 μm, Q = 2.7, Q’ = 1.7–3.8 (n = 196/9), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.

Burdsall (CFMR:HHB-7334∗).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces enatus is similar to C. cokeri but demonstrates darker colouration, swollen cells and thicker gelatinous layer on internal hyphae. In all studied specimens septate basidiospores are extremely rare. The species shows high variability in morphological characters, nrDNA sequences and substrate preferences. In all publications of Shirouzu et al. Japanese materials were cited as C. canadensis or C. pallidus. For American specimens CFMR:HHB-671 and CFMR:HHB-7334 we were able to sequence only 5.8S and part of ITS2. The sequences were too short to use in the phylogeny reconstruction but sufficient to identify them as C. enatus. Interestingly, Seifert (1983) studied a culture UBC 6124 from CFMR:HHB-671 (D. punctiformis in his paper), and found in a wood block decay test that it was almost unable to degrade Pinus wood — a substrate, from which it was originally collected.\n\nThe studied types of C. enatus from K and FH are contaminated by mycoparasites, contain only few, collapsed basidiospores, and show a highly agglutinated hymenial layer, which altogether deny proper measurements. Nevertheless, characteristic macromorphology, presence of branched hyphidia, thick-walled subicular hyphae with occasional swollen compartments and simple marginal hyphae help to connect type material to the other collections cited here.\n\nDacrymyces gangliformis has 0–1-septate basidiospores that are slightly wider than typically in C. enatus — 9.2–12 × 4.5–6 μm. The species-defining “ganglia” were found to be altered swollen basidiospores, germinating with hyphae. The type specimen is scanty, poorly preserved and contaminated with anamorphic fungi. Considering similarities in microstructures and basidiocarp, we believe the specimen belongs to C. enatus. Dacrymyces fuscominus type is also in a rather bad condition, but observed morphology allows us to treat the species as a synonym of C. enatus, which has already been suggested by Kennedy (1958b).\n\nCerinomyces enterolaxus Shirouzu & A.

Hyphae clamped, in subiculum embedded in gelatinous hyaline matrix, loosely arranged, 2–4 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Subhymenial hyphae densely organized, 1.5–3 μm in diam, walls 0.3(–0.5) μm in width. In sterile areas terminal hyphae branched or simple, cylindrical or clavate, 2–4 μm in diam. Hymenium includes abundant branched cylindrical hyphidia 1.5–2 μm in diam. Basidia clavate, 14–33 × 3–6 μm. Sterigmata up to 19 μm in length (n = 62/8). Basidiospores cylindrical to slightly curved-cylindrical, occasionally slightly obpyriform, 0(–1)-septate, 9.1–13.7(–14.1) × (3.0–)3.2–4.5(–4.6) μm, L = 11.6 μm, W = 3.9 μm, Q = 3.0, Q’ = 2.4–3.8 (n = 92/9), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.

A single collapsed and deformed 3-septate spore was noted. Specimens TNS-F-61327 and TNS-F-61334 are infected by an intrahymenial Tremella species. Compared to other C. enterolaxus sequences, LSU of TNS-F-88726 contains few short indels and a 20 bp-long duplicating insertion that were cut from the final alignment. In the earlier publications of Shirouzu et al. the species was cited as Dacrymyces punctiformis.\n\nCerinomyces fasciculatus Gilb. & Hemmes, Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden 89: 81 (2004).\n\nTypus: USA, Hawaii, Island of Hawaiʻi, Kaʻu dist., Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, Kīpuka Puaulu, on Pipturus albidus, 17 Nov. 1998, R.L. Gilbertson 22101 (holotype BPI, isotype ARIZ).\n\nDescription fide Gilbertson & Hemmes (2004): Basidiocarps annual, resupinate, arid, membranous, effused to 10 cm; hymenial surface light buff, smooth, with projecting sterile hyphal pegs, margin thinning out, whitish with radiating fibrils at the edge; pegs up to 40 μm diam and projecting up to 70 μm, composed of thin-walled clamped hyphae, arising in the subiculum and appearing as more compactly interwoven columns in the surrounding subicular tissue, apices with projecting rounded hyphal ends. Hyphae in subiculum hyaline, with abundant clamps, 2–4.5 μm diam. Hymenium. Some irregularly lobed or branched hymenial hyphidia present; basidia clavate at first, 25–40 × 4–6 μm, becoming bifurcate, sterigmata to 35 μm long and 3–4 μm diam, tapering to pointed apex. Basidiospores curved-cylindrical, aseptate, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, negative in Melzer's reagent, 10–12.5(–13) × 4.5–5.5 μm.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Angiosperm shrubs (Pipturus); known only from Hawaiʻi.\n\nNotes: We have not seen the specimens, but according to the described morphology, C. fasciculatus is related to the C. albosporus clade. The types could not be traced in BPI (several loan requests) or ARIZ (A.E. Arnold, 7 Jul. 2019, pers. comm.).\n\nCerinomyces favonius Spirin, Miettinen & A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Substrate under old basidiocarps is often dark brown. Hyphae clamped, loosely interwoven in subiculum, 2–3 μm in diam, with walls 0.3–0.6 μm in width; tightly and vertically arranged in subhymenium, 2–2.5(–3) μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.4 μm in width. Hymenium simple, basidia clavate, 8–18 × 3.5–5 μm, with sterigmata up to 16 μm in length (n = 40/2). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, (6.3–)7.1–10.3(–10.8) × 2.3–3.0(–3.1) μm, L = 8.3 μm, W = 2.7 μm, Q = 3.1, Q’ = 2.5–3.9 (n = 60/2), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Abies, Picea, Pinus, Tsuga); North America.\n\nMaterial examined: Canada, British Columbia, Fraser-Fort George reg. dist., McLeod lake co., pine forest near the McKenzie road, on Pinus contorta, 27 Jun. 1969, B.

Liberta 550 (BPI1106575).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces favonius can be separated from other corticioid North American species by its narrower basidiospores and often by thinner basidiocarps. Though, specimen GB-0071216, that was identified as C. favonius primarily by the spores, has relatively robust basidiocarps and cylindrical hyphidia with thickened bases that arrange into microscopic hyphal pegs, which is more characteristic to the C. pallidus clade members. The closest phylogenetic relative to C. favonius, European C. borealis, features slightly larger basidiospores and basidia.\n\nCerinomyces fugax A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Eriksson & J. Eriksson 7507 (GB-0071219).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces fugax together with C. favonius and C. tristis form a difficult morphogroup of conifers-dwelling North American species. However, basidiospores of C. fugax are wider than of C. favonius and longer than of C. tristis. Micromorphologically, C. fugax is almost indistinguishable from its closest phylogenetic neighbor — European C. volaticus. Among the specimens that we were unable to sequence but tentatively identified as C. fugax, one has larger basidiospores 9.0–10.9 × 2.9–4.2 μm, L = 10.0 μm, W = 3.4 μm, Q = 3.0, basidia 13–20 × 2.5–4.5 μm, and sterigmata up to 18 μm in length; it can represent either a better developed C. fugax or yet another species in this complex (USA, Oregon, Cascade Head Expterimental Forest, Siuslau National Forest, on gymnosperm wood, 11 Oct. 1972, M.J.

Rarely young basidiocarps grow directly on older ones. Hyphae clamped, internal hyphae 2.5–4 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width, with gelatinous layer 0.5–1.0 μm in width, sometimes roughened. Subhymenial hyphae (2–)2.5–3 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width, with gelatinous layer up to 0.5 μm in width. Marginal hyphae simple cylindrical or slightly clavate, 2.5–3.5 μm in diam, walls of the same width as in subiculum. When stalks present, they covered in palisade of clavate or rarely slightly conical terminal cells 4–8 μm in diam, walls together with gelatinous layer ∼ 1.0 μm in width. Hymenium consists of basidia and rare cylindric hyphidia, simple or slightly branched. Basidia clavate, 23–41 × 2.5–4.5 μm. Sterigmata up to 35 μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores slightly curved-cylindrical, 0(–1)-septate, (9.9–)10.0–12.3(–13.4) × (3.1–)3.2–4.2(–4.5) μm, L = 11.3 μm, W = 3.7 μm, Q = 3.0, Q’ = 2.6–3.9 (n = 30/1), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width, collapsed basidiospores often constricted in the middle and have slightly attenuated apical part.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Pinus and unident.); North America.\n\nMaterial examined: USA, Montana, Flathead co., North Fork Flathead River, Glacier Nature Park, on Pinus ponderosa, 3 Aug. 1964, R.L.

Burdsall (CFMR:HHB-553)\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces hesperidis differs from European gelatinous Cerinomyces species by basidiocarps that are more regularly shaped, often with a central depression or of cupulate form, rooted in substrate with a short stalk, without a tendency to coalesce, resembling some collections of C. tortus. Cited here non-sequenced specimens fit well in the concept of C. hesperidis, but differ from the type by having thick-walled, pronouncedly clavate terminal hyphae covering basidiocarp stems.\n\nCerinomyces inermis A. Savchenko, sp. nov. MycoBank MB 839794. , .\n\nTypus: New Zealand, Te Ika-a-Māui, Bay of Plenty reg., Te Urewera, Tarapounamu, UA 2 NW 16m, on gymnosperm wood, 10 Oct. 2004, P.R. Johnston & B.C. Paulus 752 (holotype {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"PDD87816\",\"term_id\":\"1251300034\"}}PDD87816∗!).\n\nEtymology: inermis (Lat.) — unarmored, referring to the absence of hyphal pegs.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps originate as arid white subicular patches, turning into smooth and solid, light yellowish brown to dark brown, semitransparent, thin film, waxy when moisture applied, with thin subiculum and white fimbriate margins. Hyphal pegs absent. Hyphae clamped, gelatinized, subicular hyphae 2–3(–4) μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width; in subhymenium 1.5–3 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Hymenium simple, basidia clavate, 12–25 × 3–5 μm, with sterigmata up to 21 μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, often with lipid droplets within, aseptate, (8.1–)8.2–10.2(–10.6) × (2.9–)3.0–3.9 μm, L = 9.5 μm, W = 3.3 μm, Q = 2.9, Q’ = 2.3–3.4 (n = 30/1), walls ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood; New Zealand (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces inermis can be confused with the C. pallidus clade members, but it has averagely longer basidiospores. In contrast to its relatives from the C. albosporus clade, basidiocarps of C. inermis lack hyphal pegs and are prone to gelatinize when re-wetted, which puts it close to C. aff. aculeatus 1 morphology-wise.\n\nCerinomyces lipoferus J.C.

Hyphae clamped, with comparatively high content of lipid droplets; clamps often have a hole under the loop (see B–D). Subicular hyphae 2–3.5(–4.5) μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width, gelatinized and sometimes roughened. Subhymenial hyphae densely arranged, (1.5–)2–3.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.4 μm in width. Sterile areas and margins covered with simple cylindrical, slightly inflated or narrowly clavate hyphae 2–4 μm in diam, walls of the same width as in subiculum.

Ryvarden 18670B (holotype O:F-904088∗!).\n\nEtymology: Reference to the type collection locality.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arid, solid and smooth, with crustose pale fawn hymenial surface and cottony white subiculum. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum agglutinated in strands, loose, 2–4 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.6 μm in width. Subhymenial hyphae of the same diam, walls up to 0.8 μm in width, decreasing to 0.3 μm towards hymenium, with occasional swollen cells. Hymenium includes hyphidia with cylindrical to obclavate base up to 4 μm in diam and simple apical part ∼ 1.5 μm in diam; of total length up to 25 μm, in groups or scattered among basidia. Basidia clavate to almost cylindrical, 7–17 × 2.5–4.5 μm. Sterigmata up to 10(–15) μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores ellipsoid to slightly curved-cylindrical, often with long apiculus and distinct hilar appendix, aseptate, (5.0–)5.2–7.7(–7.9) × (2.1–)2.5–3.4(–3.5) μm, L = 6.6 μm, W = 3.0 μm, Q = 2.2, Q’ = 1.8–2.8 (n = 30/1), wall ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Unidentified, probably gymnosperm wood; South Asia (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: The species has the shortest basidiospores in the genus. In our opinion, pronounced apicular part of the basidiospores (and large space between hilum and its appendix) can indicate their immaturity, so the reported measurements may not represent the full range for the trait. Type locality of C. pinguis is also in Nepal, but this species has substantially larger microstructures than C. nepalensis. The type specimen was first reported as C. pallidus by Hjortstam & Ryvarden (1984).\n\nCerinomyces neuhoffii J.C. Zamora & A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Rarely, basidiocarps stay clearly isolated and only gregarious. Separate basidiocarps up to 1(–1.5) mm in diam, from pale brown when fresh and young to dark brown or dark greyish brown, in maturity with or without a whitish subicular core, becoming almost black when dried.

The former one is widespread in Europe, while the latter occurs mostly in its northern part. Basidiocarps of C. neuhoffii are generally smaller, darker, with a softer consistency, and often organized in large, closely crowded groups. On microscopic level, C. tortus very rarely forms dendroid hyphidia, in contrast to the finely branched, abundant structures of C. neuhoffii. Also, C. neuhoffii has shorter and stouter basidia, and at least some of them tend to be slightly bent or asymmetric. Cerinomyces creber is highly similar to C. neuhoffii in hyphidia and gregarious coalescing basidiocarps, but it is often more light-coloured, has smaller basidiospores, slightly smaller basidia, and seems to be associated with Cupressaceae. Two undescribed taxa designated below as C. aff. tortus 1 and 2 both have branched hyphidia, but their basidiospores are on average shorter than of C. neuhoffii. We also found that basidiospores of C. neuhoffii specimens from Southern and Eastern Europe are slightly wider compared to the Northern collections. Zamora & Ekman (2020) cited the species as Dacrymyces tortus s. lat. 4.\n\nNeuhoff (1934) actually distinguished two putative species (D. punctiformis and D. romelii) in what had been previously considered as Dacrymyces tortus s.l. Although the original descriptions may partially cover the morphological characteristics of C. neuhoffii, they also fit within the variation of C. tortus. The type specimens of both D. punctiformis and D. romelii turned out to be conspecific to C. tortus (see note under that species), so in absence of available names we describe C. neuhoffii as a new species, while honouring Neuhoff’s clue that C. tortus has to be split.\n\nCerinomyces pallidus G.W.

Well-developed hymenial surface solid, crust-like, light ochraceous, becoming pale fawn to pale brown in older, prominent, and bruised areas; smooth or irregularly covered with hyphal pegs up to 300 μm in height. Margin fimbriate or indistinct, concolourous with hymenium surface; subiculum relatively thick, filling depressions of substrate under the hymenial crust. Older basidiocarps can be found under new ones as collapsed dark brown to black layers. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum interwoven, 2–3 μm in diam, walls 0.5–0.6(–0.8) μm in width; in subhymenium mostly perpendicular to substrate, 2–3.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5(–0.7) μm in width. Pegs formed by parallel, compact and often agglutinated hyphae 1–2.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.7 μm in width. Hymenium consists of basidia and rare hyphidia with thickened base up to 5 μm in diam and simple cylindrical apical part 2–2.5 μm in diam; hyphidia tend to form small groups, developing into microscopic hyphal pegs. Basidia clavate, 10–27 × 2.5–5(–6.5) μm, with sterigmata up to 19 μm in length (n = 116/6). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, (6.1–)6.5–10.2(–11.3) × 2.9–4.1(–4.8) μm, L = 8.0 μm, W = 3.3 μm, Q = 2.4, Q’ = 1.7–3.5 (n = 176/6), walls ∼ 0.2 in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Angiosperm (Malus, Quercus, and unident.), very rarely gymnosperm (Pinus) wood; North America.\n\nMaterial examined: USA, Iowa, Johnson co., Iowa City, on Malus, 21 Aug. 1939, G.W.

Cooke (CFMR:WBC-39924∗).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces pallidus can be identified by association with angiosperm substrates and by the presence of pegs in mature basidiocarps. It shares these features with C. paulistanus, but the latter species occurs only in South America and slightly differs in morphology. In some collections, pegs can be very rare or even absent, leading to confusion with another North American angiosperm-inhabiting species, C. atrans, that has similar micromorphology, but darker basidiocarps. Both species can occasionally appear on gymnosperm wood, and then it is difficult to tell them apart from strictly conifers-dwelling taxa.\n\nIn the protologue of C. pallidus Martin assigned a “type” and, perhaps already after publication, distributed its duplicates to a number of herbaria. Maekawa (1987) cited a holotype deposited in TRTC, but the specimen could not be traced (S. Margaritescu, 14 Sep. 2016, pers. comm.). Worth noting, that under the same number 4673, Martin put another gathering from 28 July of 1948 (ISC-V-0045115), also marked as a type. Besides of the same locality (Iowa City) and substrate (oak), it is unknown how exactly the specimen is connected to the original type material from 1939. Martin (1949) reported ellipsoid conidia produced at the tops of its hyphal pegs, but we did not see any anamorphic structures in C. pallidus.\n\nA non-sequenced specimen UBC:F873 (Canada, British Columbia) deserves a specific mention having unusually short, ellipsoid basidiospores (6.5–8 × 3–4 μm, L = 7.4 μm, W = 3.6 μm, Q = 2.1, Q’ = 1.6–2.6, n = 16/1), and can represent either an immature C. pallidus or a potential new species. Sequence of ARIZ-M-AN09245 was produced during the revision of this study; it was not used in the analyses but matches other included sequences.\n\nCerinomyces paulistanus A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Hymenial surface arachnoid to solid, from pale ochraceous to brown in older or damaged areas. Margin fimbriate, concolourous with subiculum. Well-developed basidiocarps covered with scattered hyphal pegs 300(–500) μm in height. Hyphae clamped, subicular hyphae 2–3.5(–6) μm in diam, with occasional swellings up to 10 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.8 μm in width; in subhymenium 2–4 μm in diam, walls 0.2–0.6 μm in width. Hyphae inside of pegs 3–4 μm in diam, originating from subiculum and becoming gradually thinner and more thin-walled towards the top of peg, being 2–3(–4) μm in diam on sides and at the top. Hymenium consists of basidia and hyphidia that have slightly swollen base 2.5–3 μm in diam and simple cylindrical apical part 1.5–2 μm in diam; ≤ 50 μm in total length. Hyphidia tend to arrange in agglutinated groups, microscopic pegs. Basidia clavate, 10–23 × 2.5–5 μm, with sterigmata up to 13 μm in length (n = 49/7). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, (6.0–)6.5–9.6(–11.2) × (2.5–)2.6–3.9(–4.4) μm, L = 7.6 μm, W = 3.3 μm, Q = 2.3, Q’ = 1.8–3.1 (n = 126/7, 91 measured in 1 % KOH), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Unidentified, probably angiosperm wood; South America.\n\nMaterial examined: Brazil, São Paulo, Parque do Estado, [near] Instituto de Botânica, 18 Mar. 1964, K.

They are the only two species in Cerinomyces outside of the C. albosporus clade that develop macroscopic hyphal pegs, though we noted that in C. paulistanus many of otherwise well-developed basidiocarps have no such pegs.\n\nCerinomyces pinguis A.

Hyphae clamped, not differentiated. Subhymenial hyphae 2–3 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width, gelatinized, agglutinated in strands closer to substrate. Hymenium includes hyphidia with thickened base 3–5 μm in diam and simple cylindrical apical part 1.5–2 μm in diam; up to 50 μm in total length. Basidia clavate to broadly clavate, 10–21 × 4.5–6.5 μm. Sterigmata up to 12(–16) μm in length (n = 30/1), sometimes covered with gelatinous layer. Basidiospores slightly curved-cylindrical, aseptate, (8.7–)9.0–10.5(–12.6) × 3.5–4.5(–5.0) μm, L = 9.8 μm, W = 3.9 μm, Q = 2.5, Q’ = 2.2–2.9 (n = 30/1), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Unidentified, probably gymnosperm wood; South Asia (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces pinguis has the largest basidiospores and arguably the most delicate basidiocarps among the peg-lacking corticioid Cerinomyces species.

Hyphae clamped, densely packed, in subiculum often arranged in threads, 2–4 μm in diam, walls 0.8–1.0 μm in width, bearing crystals: from scattered transparent pustulate ≤ 2 μm in height to amorphic brownish coating. In some subicular areas crystals can be completely absent. Subhymenium develops from subiculum as tangles of ramificated hyphae. Subhymenial hyphae well-branched and tightly arranged, 2–3 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.6 μm in width. Some sterile areas covered with the same type of branched hyphae.

MycoBank typification MBT10001415.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps gelatinous, first pustulate, then flattened, often centrally depressed, discoid or slightly cerebriform, sometimes with short stalk. Gregarious, occasionally can coalesce with shapes of single basidiocarps remaining visible; separate basidiocarps up to 3 mm in diam. Colour from translucent light yellow to brown with lighter internal core of subiculum inside of mature basidiocarps, dark brown to black when dried, very rarely of orange shades. Sometimes young basidiocarps grow directly on older ones. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum heavily gelatinized, 2.5–3.5 μm in diam, rarely swollen, walls 0.3–0.8 μm in width. Subhymenial hyphae densely arranged, 2.5–4.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.8 μm in width. In cupulate basidiocarps sterile areas and margins covered with terminal hyphae 3.5–5 μm in diam, walls 0.5–1.0 μm in width. On borders between fertile and sterile areas branched anastomosing hyphae are often abundant. Hymenium consists of basidia and rare cylindrical hyphidia with few short branches, 2–3.5 μm in diam, walls width varies from up to 0.8 μm in the base of hyphidium to ∼ 0.3 μm at the top. Basidia clavate 17–56 × 2.5–5 μm, with thicker walls in the bases. Sterigmata up to 31(–38) μm in length (n = 87/9). Basidiospores slightly curved-cylindrical, aseptate, binucleate, (9.0–)9.7–14.4(–15.6) × (3.0–)3.1–4.9(–5.3) μm, L = 12.1 μm, W = 4.0 μm, Q = 3.0, Q’ = 2.4–4.2 (n = 140/10), walls ∼ 0.2–0.3 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Picea, mostly Pinus, and unident.); Europe, mostly northern part.\n\nMaterial examined: Estonia, Viljandi co., Põhja-Sakala par., Soomaa National Park, on gymnosperm wood, 16 Sep. 2018, O.

Akulov AS0078.1 (CWU(MYC), TU135066∗).\n\nNotes: Basidiocarps of C. tortus are similar to the ones of C. neuhoffii, but generally larger, more light-coloured, occasionally yellowish when fresh or dull orange when dry. In addition, C. tortus has a northern distribution and does not produce such easily coalescing groups as C. neuhoffii or C. creber. The branched hyphidia of C. tortus are rare and more robust than of any other gelatinous Cerinomyces species. Cerinomyces lipoferus is different from C. tortus by its in average wider basidiospores, as well as by longer basidia and much higher content of lipid droplets in hyphae. In C. lipoferus, single-septate basidiospores are rare but consistently present, whereas in C. tortus they occur only in exceptional cases (e.g., in the specimen Miettinen 21768). Other affined taxa, C. aff. tortus 1 and 2, possess well-branched hyphidia. In Zamora & Ekman (2020) C. tortus sensu typi was referred to as Dacrymyces tortus s. lat. 3.\n\nWhen describing Tremella torta, Willdenow (1788) mentioned that it is a rare fungus occurring in hedges near Berlin, but he did not elaborate much on morphology. Fries (1828) transferred the species to Dacrymyces and specified Pinus as the only substrate. He also synonymized Dacrymyces lacrymalis sensu Sommerfeld with D. tortus. It caused some confusion, since Sommerfeld’s concept of D. lacrymalis is a mix of two species: one growing on gymnosperm wood and another one on angiosperm (Sommerfelt 1826). Fries’ herbarium in UPS contains two specimens that both support the current concept of C. tortus as a conifers-dwelling species. We could not prove that this material was used for the sanctioning description, and therefore it is unavailable for lectotypification (ICN 2018, Art. 9.4).\n\nLater Bourdot (1932) described Dacrymyces deliquescens var. castaneus characterized by discoid, short stalked, brown with orange tint basidiocarps, absence of hyphidia, and occasionally 1-septate basidiospores. We think the variety represents a well-developed C. tortus s.l. (For information on D. castaneus Rabenh. see the next section.) Neuhoff (1934) added superfluous D. punctiformis and D. romellii. Excellent condition of D. punctiformis holotype allowed us to sequence ITS region that, together with the typical morphology, confirmed the type identity to C. tortus. We have checked D. romellii isotype and found that it is very scanty, contains no spores, and is massively contaminated by intrahymenial Tremella species. Curiously enough, Neuhoff in pers. comm. to Kennedy (1957) said that D. romellii is a “luxuriant state” of D. punctiformis, which is opposite to the state of the types. Basidiocarps and hyphal structure of D. romellii are similar to C. tortus, though some microstructural differences are present, such as hyphal knots in subiculum and more thick-walled hyphidia. We consider it a synonym of C. tortus, assuming morphological peculiarities could be caused by the parasite and the old specimen age, respectively.\n\nCerinomyces aff. tortus 1. , .\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps gelatinous, pustulate, often with a central depression when mature, rooted in substrate. Colour from translucent light yellow to brown when fresh, dark brown to black when dried. Basidiocarps up to 0.5(–1) mm in diam, gregarious, close groups can coalesce with the shapes of separate basidiocarps remaining visible. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum agglutinated, 2.5–4.5 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width with uneven gelatinous layer up to 1.5 μm. Subhymenial hyphae in a very thin layer, 2–3(–5) μm in diam, walls 0.3 μm in width. Sterile areas and margins covered with terminal hyphae 3–4 μm in diam, walls 0.3 μm in width, gelatinized. Hymenium consists of basidia and branched hyphidia up to 70 μm in length, with base 2–3 μm in diam, and apical part 1–2 μm in diam. Basidia clavate, 11–32 × 2.5–4.5 μm, with sterigmata up to 24 μm in length (n = 60/2). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, binucleate, (8.2–)9.0–12.0(–12.4) × 3.0–4.1(–4.4) μm, L = 10.4 μm, W = 3.6 μm, Q = 2.9, Q’ = 2.3–3.7 (n = 60/2), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Pinus); Northern Europe.\n\nMaterial examined: Finland, Perä-Pohjanmaa prov., Rovaniemi, on Pinus sylvestris, 14 Jul. 2018, J.C. Zamora & P. Posio (UPS:F-946509∗, H6014413). Sweden, Kalmar co., Öland, Borgholm mun., Bödakusten västra Nature Reserve, Byrums Sandvik, on P. sylvestris, 2 Oct. 2017, J.C. Zamora (UPS:F-946504∗).\n\nNotes: The taxon is similar in basidiocarp appearance and distribution to C. tortus, C. lipoferus, C. neuhoffii, and C. aff. tortus 2, though the first two do not have abundant, finely branched dendroid hyphidia. In turn, basidiospores of C. aff. tortus 1 are averagely smaller than of C. neuhoffii and larger than of C. aff. tortus 2, though additional collections are needed to confidently delimit the taxa. Related Japanese material is discussed under C. aff. tortus 2.\n\nCerinomyces aff. tortus 2. , .\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps gelatinous, pustulate, often centrally depressed, later slightly cerebriform, rooted in substrate. Fresh basidiocarps of light yellow to brown colour, becoming dark brown to black when dried. Basidiocarps up to 1.5 mm in diam, gregarious, coalescing when close, with the outlines of separate basidiocarps remaining visible. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum 2.5–4 μm in diam, walls 0.4–0.7(–1.0) μm in width, gelatinized; in subhymenium 2–3(–5) μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width. Margins covered with slightly swollen hyphae 2–3.5 μm in diam, apical parts slightly attenuated, and walls thickened. Hymenium includes branched hyphidia up to 70 μm in total length, with thickened base 2–3 μm in diam, and apical part 1.5–2 μm in diam. Basidia clavate 21–40 × 2.5–4 μm, with sterigmata up to 31 μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores slightly curved-cylindrical, 0(–1)-septate, binucleate, 7.8–10.7 × 3.3–4.2(–4.4) μm, L = 9.4 μm, W = 3.8 μm, Q = 2.4, Q’ = 1.9–3.0 (n = 38/1), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Pinus); Northern Europe.\n\nMaterial examined: Norway, Hedmark co., Kongsvinger mun., Kubergskogen, on Pinus sylvestris (?), 6 Oct. 2018, J.C. Zamora & P. Posio (UPS:F-940948∗, H7009043).\n\nNotes: The taxon highly resembles C. tortus and C. lipoferus in basidiocarp morphology, and C. neuhoffii with C. aff. tortus 1 in presence of well-branched hyphidia. Among them C. aff. tortus 2 has the on average shortest basidiospores. Zamora & Ekman (2020) cited the taxon as Dacrymyces tortus s. lat. 2.\n\nShirouzu et al. (2020) added two undescribed taxa related to C. aff. tortus 1 & 2. Two collections are similar in the LSU sequences to the Norwegian specimen, but they are likely to represent a separate taxon, cited here as C. aff. tortus 3 (Japan, Honshu, Chūbu reg., Nagano pref., Sugadairakougen, on Pinus densiflora, 12 Jul. 2017, T. Shirouzu HNo.1176 [TNS-F-88757∗], 3 Sep. 2018, HNo.1215 [TNS-F-88780∗]). Another, slightly different, LSU sequence was obtained from a Japanese environmental strain 1611_131A1, but we are not aware of any specimens supporting this taxon.\n\nCerinomyces tristis Miettinen & A.

Miettinen 16934 (holotype H7009711∗!, isotype NY!).\n\nEtymology: tristis (Lat.) — dull coloured; reference to basidiocarp colour.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps arid, with relatively thick cottony subiculum, hymenial surface solid and smooth, light ochraceous with whitish margin; covering several cm in the longest dimension. Hyphae clamped, in subiculum loose, 2–4 μm in diam, walls 0.2–0.6 μm in width. Subhymenial hyphae of the same type, wall thickness decreases towards hymenium. Margin covered with simple or rarely branched thin-walled hyphae 1.5–2 μm in diam. Hymenium consists of basidia and rare hyphidia with thickened base up to 3 μm in diam and rarely branched cylindrical apical part up to 2 μm in diam; 15–40 μm in total length, often in groups. Basidia clavate, 9–22 × 2.5–5 μm. Sterigmata up to 16 μm in length (n = 45/3). Basidiospores long-ellipsoid to slightly curved-cylindrical, aseptate, 6.0–8.9(–9.7) × (2.5–)2.7–4.0(–4.1) μm, L = 7.4 μm, W = 3.3 μm, Q = 2.2, Q’ = 1.6–2.8 (n = 108/3), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Larix, Picea [?], Pinus, Tsuga, and unident.); North America.\n\nMaterial examined: Canada, British Columbia, Columbia-Shuswap dist., Bugaboo Provincial Park, on gymnosperm wood, 19 Aug. 1982, N.

Miettinen 19013 (H∗).\n\nNotes: Cerinomyces trisis, together with C. atrans, C. favonius, and C. fugax, belongs to a difficult morphological group of North American conifers-dwelling species. Among them, C. tristis is characterized by the shortest basidiospores.\n\nA possibly related to C. tristis specimen demonstrates some of the lowest Q values in Cerinomyces, having basidiospores (5–)5.7–7(–7.2) × (2.9–)3.1–3.9(–4) μm, L = 6.3 μm, W = 3.5 μm, Q = 1.8, basidia 11–19 × 3.5–4 μm, and sterigmata up to 13 μm in length (Canada, British Columbia, Vancouver island, China beach, on Picea sitchensis, 20 Sep. 1967, B. Eriksson, J. Eriksson 8401 & J. Ginns [GB-0071226]). Hilar appendix in spores of this specimen is often distanced from the hilum itself. This pattern was also observed in the holotype of C. nepalensis, potentially indicating spore immaturity. For the same Canadian specimen, authors of “The Corticiaceae of North Europe” reported 3- to 4-sterigmate basidia (Eriksson & Ryvarden 1973). We could not confirm any of these, but 3-sterigmate basidia do occasionally occur in other species of Cerinomyces (own observations). Interestingly, the specimen NY:ex TRTS20941 bears a name “Ceracea temagamensis Jacks.” — the author correctly assumed it belongs to a new species, but never published the result. Sequence of O. Miettinen 19013 was produced during the revision of this study; it was not used in the analyses but matches other included sequences.\n\nCerinomyces verecundus A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Hyphae clamped, not differentiated, 2–3 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.5 μm in width, gelatinized. Hymenium consists of broadly clavate basidia 12–25 × 2.5–4.5 μm. Sterigmata up to 15(–17) μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, aseptate, (7.9–)8.0–10.1(–10.5) × (3.0–)3.1–4.5(–4.8) μm, L = 9.2 μm, W = 3.8 μm, Q = 2.4, Q’ = 2.0–2.9 (n = 30/1), walls ∼ 0.2 μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Pinus); New Zealand (known only from the type locality).\n\nNotes: Comparing C. verecundus to its closest relative, C. atrans, the former has larger basidiospores and occurs only in New Zealand. Notably, there are more differences in TEF1-α sequences of the two species than in ITS regions that are nearly identical.\n\nCerinomyces volaticus A. Savchenko, V. Malysheva & J.C. Zamora, sp. nov.

Many of the specimens in European herbaria labelled as C. crustulinus belong to this species. It is similar in appearance to C. borealis, but can be separated by its shorter and thicker basidiospores, presence of hyphidia, and more robust basidiocarps. Note though, that some specimens show intermediate morphologies and can be difficult in identification. Spore shape and size vary between individuals: for instance, the collection O189348 has more ellipsoid, smaller than usual, and probably immature basidiospores, measuring 5.1–7.8 × 2.4–3.5 μm, Q = 2.3. A specimen presumably belonging to C. volaticus was recorded in Italy from Tamarix gallica (Losi 2003), but otherwise C. volaticus is strictly associated with gymnosperm wood. The most closely related species to C. volaticus is the North American C. fugax, and the two are hardly distinguishable by morphology.\n\nDacrymyces burdsallii A. Savchenko, sp. nov.

Burdsall (holotype CFMR:HHB-6908∗!).\n\nEtymology: In honour of the North American mycologist Harold H. Burdsall.\n\nDescription: Basidiocarps appear as patches of cottony white subiculum, later coalescing. Subiculum thick, covered with solid, arid to waxy, light ochraceous to yellowish brown hymenium; margin wide, fimbriate, white. Hyphal pegs present in older areas, rare, irregularly scattered, up to 250 μm in height. Hyphae without clamps, subicular hyphae 2–4 μm in diam, walls ∼ 0.5 μm in width; in subhymenium of the same diam, walls ∼ 0.3 μm in width; in margin terminal hyphae cylindrical, 2–3 μm in diam, walls 0.3–0.4 μm in width. Hyphae in pegs agglutinated, densely arranged, similar to marginal. Octahedral transparent crystals abundant in subiculum, with the longest edge 15–30 μm and more. Crystal agglomerations visible by the naked eye. Small crystals also occur in margin. Hymenium simple, basidia clavate, 24–48 × 2.5–6 μm, with sterigmata up to 48 μm in length (n = 30/1). Basidiospores cylindrical, slightly curved, 0–3-septate, (11.6–)11.9–15.0 × (4.8–)4.9–6.1(–6.3) μm, L = 13.4 μm, W = 5.3 μm, Q = 2.5, Q’ = 2.1–3.0 (n = 30/1), walls ∼ 0.3–0.6(–1.0) μm in width.\n\nHabitat and distribution: Gymnosperm wood (Taxodium); North America.\n\nMaterial examined: USA, Florida, Alachua co., Austin Cory Forest, picnic area, on Taxodium distichum, 20 Jul. 1972, H.H. Burdsall (CFMR:HHB-6685).\n\nNotes: Compared to the allied North American species, D. burdsallii has smaller microstructures and much less abundant pegs than D. grandii — another species that also inhabits gymnosperm wood. At the same time, D. ceraceus and D. sobrius apparently prefer angiosperm substrates. Aside the intron TTGAGAG present in the end 5.8S, D. burdsallii is different from relatives by changes in the ITS, SSU, LSU and RPB2 regions. A non-sequenced specimen CFMR:HHB-6685 possesses swollen up to 6.5 μm cells in subhymenial hyphae, but never as wide as in D. ce"
