        "text": "The singer-songwriter\n\nKatie Melua\n\nWho she is: The 22-year-old is the UK's biggest-selling female artist.\n\nWhose iPod she had: Andreas Scholl's.\n\nWhat she thought: An iPod shuffle doesn't show the artist's names, so I didn't know what was coming next. But I liked that. The first track started with a really nice beat, then a jazz thing and this guy rapping in French.\n\nBut then we got into one of my least favourite eras of music: the 1980s. Although I was born then, I think the music was appalling - all that early electronic, computerised production. So there's all this weird synth stuff, although some classic songs like Call on Me, the original version [Valerie, by Stevie Winwood], and [Buggles'] Video Killed the Radio Star. But then, I've just covered Just Like Heaven by the Cure, from the 1980s, so I'm a hypocrite!\n\nAn even worse area for me is country, but there's a track on this iPod I love! I've tried Googling the lyrics, 'In constant sorrow', but I still don't know who it is.\n\nApart from the 1980s songs, everything was quite specialist, which I appreciated: there was none of the current trendy groups. I liked the fact I was listening to music I wouldn't normally hear.\n\nHer guess: I've become obsessed with wondering what this person is like. It's a bit like iPod blind dating! I think they are very passionate about their likes. The amount of European stuff on there suggests German or Italian parentage. I'm 99.9% sure it's a man - women tend to listen to more emotional music, less rhythmic. The obvious one is Mylo because of the dance connection, but what people put on their iPod is not necessarily what they're involved in. I think a classical person would have more specialist tastes. My gut instinct says it's Andreas Scholl. Correct\n\nThe classical singer\n\nAndreas Scholl\n\nWho he is: World's finest countertenor, the German was the star of last year's Last Night of the Proms.\n\nWhose iPod he had: Mylo's.\n\nWhat he thought: I found this very interesting, like astrology, trying to put together why someone would listen to what. There was lots of electronic music from the 1980s - especially Italo-disco, a good mix with today's music: Franz Ferdinand, OutKast and Goldfrapp. Then someone like Den Harrow, an Italo-disco singer that not many people would know about. I was a big Italo disco fan so I was delighted to find this stuff! I actually started out aged 17 doing electronic music in the mid-80s with a Commodore 64 and a Casio keyboard. I really identified with the owner of this iPod.\n\nHis guess: Because there's a lot of Italo-disco, this is definitely someone my age who was a teenager in the 1980s. There's also radio jingles and advertising spots: it's not just someone's favourite music, it's someone who's like a collector. Limahl's Neverending Story is on here! There's also Kraftwerk and other German stuff, and some of the music sounds as if it had been copied from old audiocassettes. It has to be someone who listens to different styles to extract something from them, like a DJ. I think it's Mylo. Correct\n\nThe dance act\n\nMylo\n\nWho he is: Myles McInnes' 2004 debut, Destroy Rock'n'roll, made him one of the hottest names in electronic music.\n\nWhose iPod he had: Devendra Banhart's.\n\nWhat he thought: I must confess to being absolutely baffled and bewildered by the music. I don't want to slag this person off, but it sounds like it's been put together by someone with something to prove - Will Young, maybe. It's prescribed music for people who are supposed to take music seriously, so you get the Fall and Moby Grape, Ravi Shankar next to R Kelly, Amps for Christ next to Andy Williams. It's preposterously eclectic. Half the bands I hadn't even heard of: Skog, Deer Hoof and Dr Buzzard. Rather than branching out into the vast collections of Hungarian world music, I ended up listening to the stuff I know and love, like Bob Dylan, Captain Beefheart and Led Zeppelin. There was stuff I'd heard about that I hadn't had a chance to check out before, like Animal Collective and Jamie Lidell, but the general tone of being patronised made me feel uncomfortable. I've never had much time for Joan Baez; I find her voice shrill and unpleasant. Or Joan Armatrading - anyone called Joan! And I can't stand Janis Joplin either. There was loads I liked - Hall and Oates, JJ Cale - but there's nothing from this person's youth, you know, the embarrassing stuff.\n\nHis guess: I would say this iPod belongs to someone extremely talented, quite beard-strokey and a bit pretentious. I can state categorically that this iPod belongs to Devendra Banhart. Correct\n\nThe folkie\n\nDevendra Banhart\n\nWho he is: 2005's Cripple Crow, Banhart's fourth album of cosmic acid folk, saw torrents of rave reviews bearing the words \"weirdie\", \"beardie\" and \"magical\".\n\nWhose iPod he had: Estelle's.\n\nWhat he thought: I have had such a fabulous time with this iPod. I've really been able to tune into my sexy side. There are some seriously sexy things on here and it's very physical, athletic. I've been doing sit-ups to the music - I can now do five! There's a lot of rap, hard-edged electro and a lot of very raw, dirty hip-hop. I don't have an awful lot of that on my own iPod but I should really correct the imbalance. The other thing that shines through is a soulful, mellow, emotional side to this person's character - maybe even nostalgia. There are quite a few old-school soul tracks and a good chunk of Marvin Gaye, who as we know is the master of sexy funk and soul.\n\nHis guess: It's definitely a female. I narrowed it down to two people, Lady Sovereign and Estelle, because both of them are representative of street music and femininity. I'm going to go for Lady Sovereign. Tell me I'm not wrong ... oh! Incorrect\n\nThe grime star\n\nLady Sovereign\n\nWho she is: Teenage sensation Lady Sovereign's debut single, Hoodie, made her an instant hit in street culture. She is variously described as \"the female Mike Skinner\" or \"the white Dizzee Rascal\".\n\nWhose iPod she had: Matt Davies', the lead singer in Funeral for a Friend.\n\nWhat she thought: The iPod I got is a bit weird! There were about 4,000 tracks on there - a lot of it was emo or gremo or hardcore emo or whatever they call it. I'm not sure how many tracks I got through. It's not the sort of stuff I would download, but not all the songs are about death, pestilence, despair. There's some lovey-dovey stuff ... well, not really, but emotional songs delivered in a heavy way.\n\nHer guess: I think this person is very into their music. I've got mates into this stuff; they wear black clothes. I actually found out whose it was by going into the iPod's settings to find out who it was registered to - Matt Davies. That's cheating? Nah, that's clever. Correct\n\nThe heavy metal kid\n\nMatt Davies, Funeral for a Friend\n\nWho he is: Kerrang! magazine call emo-punk-metal stars Funeral for a Friend \"the hottest new band on the planet\".\n\nWhose iPod he had: Katie Melua's.\n\nWhat he thought: We're touring in Japan at the moment and I've really enjoyed listening to this iPod because it's made me feel at home. There's a lot of stuff on here that I've got on my own iPod - the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin. I'd say this is a person who listens to an awful lot of music and is always trying to learn. The thing that I liked most was that there were a lot of surprises, and some funny stuff. There would be a load of jazzy stuff and singer-songwriters but then you'd get something totally unexpected, like Metallica. Whoever owns this is not impartial to extremely loud guitars. There are a few things on here I would probably download myself, and very little I hated.\n\nHis guess: At first I thought this iPod might be owned by someone who was fairly young in the 1970s, but the curve balls made me think again. The one thing I can say is that the owner is female, because there was a lot of emotional stuff on there; it just didn't feel \"blokey\". I might make a total fool of myself here, but I think it belongs to Katie Melua. Correct\n\nThe R&B rapper\n\nEstelle\n\nWho she is: 25-year-old London MC Estelle Swaray is the UK's premier female rapper.\n\nWhose iPod she had: Rich Archer's, lead singer of Hard-Fi.\n\nWhat she thought: I thought this iPod was a bit trendy, as if the owner were trying to impress someone. There was some really weird stuff. I don't even know the names, but I was thinking, \"What? You call this music?!\" There was a lot of hip-hop and R&B but it would be the singles, the big TV tunes. Something that shocked me was that there were a few Gang Starr tunes, and some really raw hip-hop. There was a lot of rock stuff like the Who, Kaiser Chiefs. There'd be odd tracks from Busta Rhymes or Mariah Carey, but on the rock side it would be the whole album. I disliked the stuff that sounded as if it shouldn't be released to the public - I'm sure they're big in China! But there was a lot of stuff I would download. There was a lot of the Specials and the Clash.\n\nHer guess: If I saw this person in the street I'd probably think they hang out in Hoxton, Old Street, or Portobello Road in London - somewhere trendy. I've got friends like that and I think they've got Hard-Fi records. I'm not impressed that he's not got my album here! But I'm gonna go for Rich Archer from Hard-Fi. Correct\n\nThe indie rocker\n\nRich Archer, Hard-Fi\n\nWho he is: Hard-Fi's Stars of CCTV album has seen Staines' finest compared to the Specials and the Clash.\n\nWhose iPod he had: Lady Sovereign's.\n\nWhat he thought: This was an iPod Nano, which holds less music, but I was still surprised by the limited amount and nature of it. It felt like a Now That's What I Call Music compilation of what's around. There was a lot of obvious stuff, like the Kaiser Chiefs and Goldfrapp, but it would be the big singles. They're everywhere already; you don't need them on your iPod. When I hear a band, I want to hear the obscure album tracks and B-sides. This felt like a compilation made by someone who wasn't actually that into music. Not that I'm a music snob. There was a lot of R&B, but again, obvious tunes. It felt a bit like spring-cleaning the house before someone comes round, putting on stuff you think is cool. A lot here is on my own iPod but I expected a few surprises."
