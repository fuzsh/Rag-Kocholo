Sometimes an innocent situation turns into a toxic one, reality gets blurred and one man's war has started behind the phone screen and in person. Don't get pulled into the vicious circle and save yourself before it's too late! Stalking is no joke and can be extremely damaging over time! With this song I wanted to express how turning away and moving on is sometimes the healthiest way, no matter how difficult it is!\"\n\nPre-order \"Antares\" at the Inner Wound Store here: https://innerwound.bandcamp.com/merch\n\nPre-order \"Antares\" directly from the band here: https://angelnation.bigcartel.com/\n\nANGEL NATION, the melodic metal band founded by the classically trained Finnish singer Elina Siirala (also in Leaves' Eyes) just released a music video for \"Seraph\", the first single from their new album \"Antares\".\n\nLink to the music video: https://youtu.be/GGJ3qECmyq4\n\n\"Antares\" will be released on CD and digital on April 8th and on limited vinyl on June 3rd via Inner Wound Recordings.\n\nElina Siirala of ANGEL NATION comments on the single:\n\n\"'Seraph' is the manifestation of all the willpower and determination we've had to show as a band and as individuals during the past two years. Lockdowns, no concerts, no normal life.. it's easy to forget who you are and slowly sink into the darkness.

Being able to unleash my creativity both musically and lyrically has been a true lifeline over these past couple of years and the result is a hybrid of reality, fiction and multiple musical styles blended together. Working alongside George, Julia and Lucas has ensured this album is on another level, heavier and fresh while sounding like true AngelNation. Our biggest gratitude goes to our unbelievably supporting fans who made this album possible!\"\n\nThe greatly anticipated third album takes Angel Nation to a new level! Named after the star \"Antares\", the brightest object in the constellation of Scorpius, it takes the listener on a journey of multiple elements, through an album full of energy and fire with the true sound of a metal band! \"Antares\" is combining catchy melodies, stadium rock and powerful metal tunes together with a flavour of modern synths, while maintaining the depth, both musically and lyrically.\n\nInspired by a concept of an army of angels (Seraphim), the often cryptic texts intertwine with true life stories, leaving room for the listeners own interpretation.\n\nThe album is mixed and mastered by Alexander Krull (Leaves' Eyes, Atrocity) and the artwork was created by Jobert Mello (Sabaton, Primal Fear).\n\nGet ready for it all: Heavy, rocking and epic tunes from this highly anticipated album with tons of character!\n\n\"Antares\" track listing\n\n01.

Has it really been 20 years since we released the Wings of Forever album? Time certainly flies and without doubt more so as we get older, at least that's the impression I get these days.\n\n20 years.. amazing and in some ways we need to go back a further 20 years to 1982 or thereabouts when I was first getting into rock and metal, learning piano and basically dreaming about being in a rock band, making a record and touring the world. So after 20 years of hopes and dreams it really was incredible to finally release an album, see it in the shops and all that good stuff.\n\nIt was a memorable time for not only me but for Steve Scott (bass), Adam Bickers (guitar), Alessio Garavello (vocals), Sam Totman (guitar) and Andrea Martongelli (guitar). We had a blast putting this record together and the friendships made in those early days remain as strong as ever to this day, which is another thing I am incredibly proud of.\n\nI hope you guys enjoy the vinyl reissue of the debut Power Quest album. It's been out of print generally for so long now but it's cool to have a special limited edition vinyl release to celebrate the anniversary.\n\nThanks for the support down the years. Be safe and take care of yourselves.\"\n\nThe Swiss folk/black metal band MORGARTEN just released a lyric video for \"The Last Breath\", the third single from their new album \"Cry of the Lost\".\n\nLink to the lyric video: https://youtu.be/wXrZSoKk26c\n\n\"Cry of the Lost\" will be released on June 18th on CD, limited vinyl and digital via Inner Wound Recordings.\n\nPierric from Morgarten comments on the new single\n\n\"'The Last Breath' is one of the first songs we wrote for the album and it's the first song we ever wrote that features clean vocals. It may not have the aggression or speed of other songs, but it has an intensity that makes it really unique, especially when played live. It is about the moment when the warrior, on the verge of death, realises that he may have spent his life building something that was ultimately meaningless. It's this situation that we chose to represent on the album cover. 'The Last Breath' is also in my opinion one of the songs that Jens Bogren did the most impressive work on, especially the vocal work and some of the effects he added that really bring something to the atmosphere.\"\n\nPre-order \"Cry of the Lost\" from the Inner Wound Store here: https://innerwound.bandcamp.com/album/cry-of-the-lost\n\nThe Swiss folk/black metal band MORGARTEN just released a lyric video for \"Tales of My Lands\", the second single from their new album \"Cry of the Lost\".\n\nLink to the lyric video: https://youtu.be/fFY1u4D082c\n\n\"Cry of the Lost\" will be released on June 18th on CD, limited vinyl and digital via Inner Wound Recordings.\n\nMorgarten comments on the new single\n\n\"'Tales of My Lands' is the starting point of the story on which 'Cry of the Lost' is based. It's about the day when a man realizes who he's meant to be and that he longs for the great outdoors. With the song we want to show the excitement of this man and his dreams, his thirst for great things and for travelling, and his will to be a warrior.\"\n\nPre-order \"Cry of the Lost\" from the Inner Wound Store here: https://innerwound.bandcamp.com/album/cry-of-the-lost\n\nThe female fronted melodic metal band ANGEL NATION just released a music video for their new single \"Fly Away\".\n\nLink to the music video: https://youtu.be/Ghn6zzXC5Vk\n\nAngel Nation are currently working on the band's third Album but they've made a pit stop on this journey by releasing an extra special song \"Fly Away\". Some time ago a long term supporter approached Elina to ask if she would write a song to his son's memory. She read the story behind it which turned out to be very moving and sad. However, when hearing more and looking more closely, it was the positivity and joy that shone through. A song dedicated to the memory of Leif Ole, someone who touched so many hearts, kept laughing, showing others how to enjoy the small things. Someone who's smile will never die in the hearts of those who got to know him.\n\nMusically \"Fly Away\" has the true Angel Nation sound, bringing back the old school band feel and 80's vibes. This ballad combines more intimate, acoustic approach and a full rock sound being delicate, strong, sad and joyful, all at the same time!\n\n\"We are thrilled to be releasing new music and hope this song will bring positivity in the midst of what has been a hard year for many of us. If you want to support us on our way to our third full length album, you can purchase and stream this single on the usual digital platforms.\"\n\nANGEL NATION online\n\nWebsite: http://www.angelnationofficial.com\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/angelnationmusic\n\nInner Wound Recordings are proud to announce the signing of the Swiss folk/black metal band MORGARTEN to the label.

Besides several short European tours Morgarten appeared on international festivals, like Occultfest (NL), Brainstorm Festival (NL), Devils Rock For An Angel (BE), Mannried Open Air (CH), Winter Armageddon (DE) and Rise Of Trolls (BE). Also the band was asked as opening-act for Finntroll on their visit to Switzerland in 2018.\n\nMorgarten now returns with their new album \"Cry of the Lost\", which surely won't leave fans of folk- and black metal disappointed! The album was mixed by Jens Bogren (Opeth, Dimmu Borgir, Amon Amarth) and mastered by Tony Lindgren (Opeth, Eluveitie, Sepultura). For the drums Morgarten visited Fascination Street Studio's to let David Castillo (Carcass, Opeth, Leprous) handle the recordings.\n\nThe result is a high quality release that will please fans of bands like Ensiferum, Eluveitie and Wind Rose. Morgarten proves to be the leading folk- and black metal band from the French speaking part of Switzerland and with their new album Morgarten is ready to march upon the European battlefields once more!\n\n\"Cry of the Lost\" track listing\n\n01.

The album will be available on CD, limited vinyl and digital on February 5th via Inner Wound Recordings.\n\nThe original version of \"Lies' Device\" has been sold out since the release of the second Kalidia album \"The Frozen Throne\" (Inner Wound) in 2018, an album that brought the band to another level. Since the release of \"The Frozen Throne\", it passed 2 million streams on Spotify and 5 million views on YouTube and Kalidia have toured around Europe, gaining hordes of new fans.\n\nVocalist Nicoletta Rosellini comments:\n\n\"Our debut album 'Lies' Device' has been sold out for almost two years and since then we've been receiving a growing number of requests for a reissue from our fanbase. We felt that both the album and the fans deserved an improved version of the album with better and more up to date performances, production and artwork, without losing the original flavor of the album; alas a new version of the album was created. This is our tribute to celebrate our first ten years of the band!\"\n\nThe album was mixed and mastered by Paolo Campitelli and the new artwork was created by Jan Yrlund (Battle Beast, Apocalyptica, Delain).\n\n\"Lies' Device\" track listing:\n\n01.

You can find the single on all digital outlets, or check it out on YouTube at the link below!\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/JXrJLuvYJLY\n\nThe song was recorded at the same time as the band's latest album \"The Frozen Throne\" and was originally planned to be used as a bonus track for the album. However, we felt the song was too good to end up as just a bonus track, and that it was a good time to release it now, to make the wait for the third Kalidia album a little bit bearable for everyone. :)\n\nInspired by the book \"The Dwarves\" by Markus Heitz, the song features a tasteful melodic guitar solo by Lars Rettkowitz (Freedom Call) who also produced and mixed \"The Frozen Throne\". The artwork and video was created by dwarven master Claudio Falconcini (Cosmic Nest Studio) from Wind Rose.\n\n\"Legend of the Bone Carver\", the classic second album from PYRAMAZE will be re-issued on CD, digital and for the first time on vinyl on February 15th in Europe and North America via Inner Wound Recordings.\n\nThe re-issue includes an extended 16 page booklet that features album history written by Pyramaze guitarist and founder Michael Kammeyer. The CD and digital editions also includes the bonus track \"Flame and Retribution\" that was originally only included on the Japanese edition of the album.\n\nMichael Kammeyer comments:\n\n\"Dear fans of Pyramaze and all things metal: our highly praised concept album Legend of the Bone Carver is up for a re-issue. Originally released back in 2006 to great acclaim, the album was dubbed by genre fans as one of the best concept albums in fantasy metal. Now almost 13 years later our album has found a new home with Inner Wound Recordings of Sweden. This release also means that ALL Pyramaze albums, both old and new, are finally under one roof with the very passionate crew at Inner Wound. The re-issue features a re-worked booklet, insightful album history and a bonus track. This should be a real treat for any Pyramaze fan. While I myself am no longer an active member of Pyramaze, I still follow the guys closely as a friend and fan of the new releases. I'm also still handling the business decisions regarding the three first albums, and this release has been in the making between myself, Pyramaze and Inner Wound Recordings for quite some time. Finally it's a reality and on behalf of all of us, I hereby announce that Legend of the Bone Carver 2.0 will be out in Europe and North America (digital worldwide) on February 15, 2019. Metal greetings and Merry Christmas (God Jul)\"\n\nLegend of the Bone Carver album synopsis:\n\nClose your eyes and picture an epic novel-like tale from start to finish. An original story centering on the classic tale of good vs. evil - of unspeakable horror consuming all that is good in a realm of Tolkien-like proportions, and a prayer that brings a mystical young hope of unknown origin to the world. Will this young innocent soul be able to help against the massive upheaval and chaos? You'll have to hear the album in its entirety to know the whole story and find out what the LEGEND OF THE BONE CARVER is all about!\n\n\"Legend of the Bone Carver\" was mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen (Volbeat, Amaranthe, Evergrey).\n\n\"Legend of the Bone Carver\" track listing:\n\n01.

It's time for the old to become the new! Our highly praised debut album Melancholy Beast is up for a re-release. Originally released back in 2004, the album has had a good run, but has become increasingly hard to obtain in the stores over the last years, due to obsolete record contracts and label changes. While the new Pyramaze stuff continues to gather new fans around the world, the old album(s) have also become highly coveted by the growing Pyramaze fanbase. Therefore it is with great pride and joy that I can announce the signing for a re-release with Inner Wound Recordings. The album has been updated with track commentary, album history and new band photos inside the booklet. Also for the first time outside of Japan with the bonus track \"The Wizard\". This should be a real treat for any Pyramaze fan. While I myself am no longer an active member of Pyramaze, I still follow the guys closely as a friend and fan of the new releases. I'm also still handling the business decisions regarding the three first albums. And this release has been in the planning between myself, Pyramaze and Inner Wound Recordings for quite some time. Finally it's a reality, and on behalf of Pyramaze, Inner Wound Recordings and myself I hereby announce that Melancholy Beast 2.0 will be out in Europe and North America on November 24th. Metal greetings, Michael Kammeyer (ex-Pyramaze captain/guitarist).\"\n\n\"Melancholy Beast\" was mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen [Volbeat, Amaranthe, Evergrey].\n\n\"Melancholy Beast\" track listing:\n\n01.

We were in discussions for a couple of months, during which time the salient points of the deal were already agreed before I recently flew to Gothenburg to sign the agreement in person. In this age of faceless business it was refreshing to do things the old fashioned way. I'm really excited about this collaboration and we have a lot of cool things planned for the next 12 months.\n\nEmil Westerdahl of Inner Wound Recordings comments:\n\nIt's a true pleasure to announce the signing of POWER QUEST to the label. During the past few months that Steve and I have been in contact it's become clear that we share the same vision for the band and that POWER QUEST and Inner Wound is a perfect fit.
