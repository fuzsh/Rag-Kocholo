        "text": "2013. Unreferenced spoken-word draft of position paper given at the Cultural Musicology Conference, Amsterdam, 2014. \"In my view, a truly ethnomusicological approach to the cultural history of music still has not yet emerged in the discipline. Firstly, I make a distinction here between the long established concerns of historical ethnomusicology, which are primarily musicological (admirably and crucially so), and the chrysalid cultural histories of those same art-music systems. The difference, as I see it, is that between a piece of carved jade and a clear glass prism – the study of music as a beautiful and important cultural object in and of itself, versus the study of music predominantly as a lens to illuminate the rest of the world. Both modes of historical study are critically important and frequently complementary, and there has not been anywhere near enough of the former in most cases to even start on the latter. But I do consider them to be substantively different kinds of enterprise. Secondly, the curious thing for me about the concerns of the new cultural histories of [Indian] music is how presentist they are. This is generally fair enough, I think, of history in ethnomusicology: a) because ethnomusicologists have rarely ventured earlier than the twentieth century in any case; and b) precisely because of the overwhelming concerns of the bulk of the discipline with the present and the impact on the present of the immediate past. With respect to India, much of the recent historical work I’ve noted has at its heart a valid and necessary desire to expose anti-colonial nationalists’ deliberate construction of North and South India’s contemporary classical traditions as “ancient, Hindu arts”, and to reposition them as colonial products to a lesser or greater degree. But historians of earlier soundworlds [and I include myself here] do not have such an excuse. Surely, as cultural historians seeking to illuminate the very different life-worlds of the past, we should at least recognise presentist concerns for what they are, and try to resist them where they are not relevant to our primary sources? Should we not approach the archives of the past as we do the living fields of the present: alive to difference, and its scholarly pleasures and dangers?\"\n\nThis collection of papers explores the intellectual history of music in global context during the period between around 1870 and 1930. Following an introduction that discusses the state of the field, each of the three papers presents a case study that explores the intersection between music and global history from diverse perspectives. The first paper discusses a Hindi music treatise published in 1896. By situating this work within multiple 'significant geographies', the paper highlights the limitations of 'global' approaches that neglect the more immediate musical, social and intellectual environments of their subjects. The second paper analyses the intersection between music and Islamic modernism in the late Ottoman Empire. It argues that a Eurocentric understanding of music history propagated by earlier reformists was succeeded at the end of the nineteenth century by an oppositional narrative that drew on the geopolitical imaginary of pan-Islamism. The final paper discusses the work of the Argentine composer Alberto Williams, particularly in relation to his views on race and national music. The paper demonstrates how contemporary scientific theories such as positivism and Social Darwinism contributed to a narrative of national musical development that created hierarchies of musical genres and excluded Argentine composers of African descent.\n\nThe “classical” music of South India is an amalgam of regional traditions and practices. Increasingly codified in the past five centuries, it is now known as Carnatic or Karnatak music. Like the Sanskrit term Karnâtaka Sangîtam, these Anglicisms denote “traditional” music besides distinguishing South Indian music from its northern (Hindustani) counterpart. Progressive scholars have long espoused the common goal of making teaching more effective for both idioms while safeguarding “authentity”. It may therefore seem odd that detailed notation has not been embraced by practitioners. This paper probes the resilience of oral transmission in the face of modernity. It looks into the concerns shared by musicians who, while belonging to different cultures and periods, have much in common as far as performing practice is concerned: close integration of vocal and instrumental music. The role of manuscripts in Minnesang, as described by McMahon, also applies to Carnatic music: “songs were handed down in an oral tradition [and] the manuscripts were not intended to be used by performers.” (The Music of Early Minnesang Columbia SC, 1990.) It will be argued that this fact is not just a question of some musicians’ conservatism, ignorance or irrationality; nor would it put the continuity of a living tradition at risk. On the contrary, Carnatic music reaches global audiences today while “ancient” roots are claimed even by those who cherish its association with musicians from other cultures throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Music Road has been called 'an extraordinary , effective contribution towards the establishment of a non-hierarchical musicology, the result of an equal dialogue between different musicological and historical perspectives'. Based on research for the Balzan Musicology Project 'Towards a global history of music' and supported by the Balzan Prize for Musicology, most of the chapters have been prepared by mid-career musicologists and ethnomusicologists for workshop conferences in 2016 and 2017. As advocated by Martin Stokes in his keynote chapter on ethnomusicology and the Middle East, the book demonstrates the changes of historical thought in ethnomusicology. It also proves the benefits of anthropological approaches to music history. The individual chapters on musical cultures from the Mediterranean to India bring together historical research, philology and ethnographic fieldwork to revive the differentiated voices of this world region. It is here called 'the Music Road', to emphasise the musical traditions in this western half of the 'Silk Road', and the transitional nature of its cultural migrations and coherences. Mobility in space, transmission in time and 'the East-West imagination' (a less one-sided term for what is known as 'Orientalism') are demonstrated in the following historical cultures: Ancient Gandhara ˉ (north-west India, first centuries ce) and the tradition of Alexander's conquest; 'Intercultural Islam' from medieval Persia to modern Turkey; 'Indian encounters' with the West-and vice versa-in music and dance (18th-20th centuries); Greek music and theatre as a bridge between East and West; and Gypsy musical styles in European nationalist music."
