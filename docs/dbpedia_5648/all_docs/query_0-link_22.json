        "text": "I wish there was somewhere where people gave reviews of the different EZmix preset packs, but I haven’t found anything. Just ordered the 6-pack from AudioDeluxe, and I’m deciding what to get. Most of what I do is rock, from indie (think Indie Folk, the genre that EZX aims for) up to pop-punk, power-pop type stuff. I’m not into recording metal type stuff, so the metal packs are pretty much off my list.\n\nHere’s my list of possibilities…\n\nCore: Seems like a no brainer, but is it? Getting a little bit of everything is usually a good thing, but I looked over the detailed list of presets and it doesn’t look at all that interesting, but maybe that’s the point. It’s just a general sprinkle of presets.\n\nVocal Toolbox: I think I’m pretty sold on this one. I mean, how can you go wrong with a ton of vocal presets?\n\nAmps: Again, this is one of those I feel you can’t go wrong with. Though honestly, I have a LOT of amp plugins, but I usually only use 2, maybe three. Scuffham S-Gear is my goto amp plugin. For bass I usually turn to Studio Devil VBA. I also have Kuassa Creme which is incredible for high-gain metal type stuff, but I don’t usually do that kind of music anyway. I also have Waves GTR3 (which I really do not like anymore). So yeah, I feel like I already have amps covered, but I was a bit impressed with the amps in the stock presets. And I love the really quick and easy way of auditioning preset in EZmix. It really lends to the creative process. So though I do have a lot of amp options already, I feel this may still prove useful.\n\nHenderson: I respect this guy and his work immensely, so I feel like this one is already locked into my list.\n\nMastering: At first glance, I was skeptical of this one. I had that kneejerk reaction in regard to the art of mastering, and that how dare anyone reduce it to some quick setting plugin, blah blah blah. But looking back, I’ve had plenty of projects that I tried mastering myself, and got OK results. But just OK. But those OK results really did take me a good amount of time. So my attitude has changed on this. I think the EZmix preset workflow is a terrific way to try out different mastering situations on my mixes. So I pretty much have this one locked in as well.\n\nDirt: On this one, at first glance, I was sold. But the more I think about it, how much dirt do you need, especially if you really aren’t working in that particular genre? I happen to love that Refused, International Noise Conspiracy sound, I just don’t actually play or work on that type of material that often (but I didn’t say never). I have plenty of distortion at my disposal, from the stock EZmix stuff, to stock DAW distortion plugins, to all my amp plugins. I’m curious to hear from anyone who has this how much versatility it really brings to the table when working outside of it’s targeted genre.\n\nSongwriter’s: I’m turned off by the EZmix 1 packs for some reason. Maybe just feeling like they aren’t as capable as EZmix 2 pack because they don’t take advantage of all the plugin has to offer. Maybe that thinking is wrong though. I definitely am a songwriter. So in title alone, it fits me perfectly. I’m just wondering if the selection wouldn’t be better spent on one of the other signature producer packs. Ainley comes to mind, but again, it’s an EZmix 1 pack. Just undecided on this one. Would love to hear opinions.\n\nSo that’s 7 I’m considering. I’m open to suggestions on the other producer packs or others I haven’t mentioned, like Alternative, Rock, Modern Pop, etc. I’m really not into anything that gears itself toward metal, but I’m open to everything from mellow Indie (Shins, Fleet Foxes) to Hard Rock / Pop-Punk (Foo Fighers, Green Day).\n\nDouble thanks in advance to anyone who took the time to read this!"
