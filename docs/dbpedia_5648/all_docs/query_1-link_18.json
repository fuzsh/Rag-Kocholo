        "text": "March Listening Station & Social Media Titles Released This Week:\n\nHoney Harper – Starmaker CD/LP (ATO)\n\nHoney Harper’s debut album, Starmaker, comes as a collection of contradictions in both subject matter and style. Written with his wife and writing partner Alana Pagnutti over the past three years, the album itself is primarily about the journey to create it. Its self-awareness is largely the result of Harper’s inner monologues about his fear of failure, desire for success, and the toll that journey has taken on him and his loved ones. It’s an attempt at honesty through the veil of a country singer lost in the stars. After explorations in other vastly different styles, Harper recognized the value he could add to a genre with beautiful sounds but negative connotations. On Starmaker, Harper seeks to revitalize country music for people who don’t like country music. With album appearances from Sébastian Tellier, Austra, and John Kirby, the contrast of the songs becomes even more apparent and set Honey Harper apart to become the torchbearer for a revitalized country sound. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nLauv – How I’m Feeling CD/2xLP (Lauv)\n\nMost pop genre albums can be categorized by their peppy messages along the lines of “Believe in yourself no matter what!” or “Life is always amazing!” That’s what Lauv’s second album – How I’m Feeling – subverts. Instead of following industry standards, the record acts as a refreshing take on pop music by taking an honest introspective look on himself. [Clear vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nMandy Moore – Silver Linings CD/LP (Verve)\n\nEmmy, Grammy & Golden Globe-nominated actress/singer/songwriter Mandy Moore returns to music with her first album in a decade, Silver Landings. In a purposeful departure from the pop sound of her previous material, she worked closely with longtime collaborator, producer Mike Viola and her husband, Taylor Goldsmith (of folk-rock band Dawes), creating the lyrics on her own and recording each song live with a full band setup. The album deftly moves from ‘70s inspired soft-rock to contemporary pop.\n\nEsmé Patterson – There Will Come Soft Rains CD/LP (BMG)\n\nEsmé Patterson is folk-rock singer/songwriter who began as a member of the Denver folk pop septet Paper Bird and has written three records as a solo act including All Princes, I (2012), Woman To Woman (2015) and We Were Wild (2016). The Guardian called her “defiant and witty,” the New York Times found her voice “wiry and candid” with songs that “hint at mystery and mortality.” Now she returns with her fourth solo endeavor, There Will Come Soft Rains, produced by Tennis aka Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore. Named after a story from Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles, it finds Patterson adding synthesizers and dream-pop arrangements to the mix with stunning results. Patterson calls single “Shelby Tell Me Everything”, a “sweet and innocent gay love song” that “exists in the initial moment of attraction, frozen temporarily in the air like a cloud. This song ecstatically explores the distance between reality and fantasy, between attraction and first kiss, suspended in innocence like a daydream.”\n\nSilverstein – A Beautiful Place To Drown CD/LP (UNFD)\n\nOntario-based post-hardcore band Silverstein celebrate their 20th anniversary with the release of a new album. A Beautiful Place To Drown fittingly encapsulates the best of Silverstein while pushing their sound into daring new territory. They may be proud torchbearers of the emo and post-hardcore scenes but appearances from Underoath’s Aaron Gillespie, Beartooth’s Caleb Shomo, Simple Plan’s Pierre Bouvier, and perhaps most surprisingly, hip-hop firebrand Princess Nokia, are indicative of the band’s wide-reaching impact and their ability to reach listeners in all worlds of music. Silverstein pushed themselves lyrically as well, exploring the mental duress that seems to be inextricable from the personal and societal challenges of modern life, often focusing on external perspectives and even political elements without losing the band’s trademark intimacy. [Limited indie store exclusive colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nSadler Vaden – Anybody Out There? CD/LP (Dirty Mag)\n\nAcclaimed solo artist. Songwriter. Grammy-winning member of Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit. Producer. Studio musician. Modern-day guitar hero. A professional musician since the age of 18, Sadler Vaden has spent the better part of two decades on stage, on the road, and in the recording studio, lending his unique rock & roll approach to highly-revered bands, up-and-coming acts, and in his own solo work. His new album, Anybody Out There?, mixes the hook-savvy sweep of Vaden’s songwriting with the supersized stomp of his electric guitar. It’s a modern record that doesn’t ignore the past, balancing frequent nods to Vaden’s 20th century influences – including Neil Young, The Who, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh, and Oasis – with a contemporary sound that mixes raw, live performances with digital recording technology.\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nAllen/Olzon – Worlds Apart CD (Frontiers)\n\nInimitable singer Russell Allen (Symphony X, Adrenaline Mob) and acclaimed Swedish guitarist, songwriter, and producer Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear, Magnus Karlssons Free Fall) have collaborated successfully on three critically acclaimed albums where Russell dueted with Norwegian singer, Jorn Lande. After a break in their collaboration on said albums, where Timo Tolkki stepped in and oversaw an album, Magnus has returned to the fold, but with an exciting new twist to the formula. This time, Russell and Magnus welcome none other than the amazingly talented Anette Olzon (ex-Nightwish, The Dark Element) to the fold as Allen’s vocal partner and offer up an unbelievable new duets album.\n\nAsh – Teenage Wildlife – 25 Years Of Ash CD/2xLP (Echo Label Ltd.)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – now available on CD. Sharing its title with the documentary which depicted Ash’s rise from local school heroes to all-conquering band that topped the charts with their debut album 1977, Teenage Wildlife traces the band’s recording career from exuberant debut “Jack Names The Planets” through to “Buzzkill” and “Annabel” from 2018’s Top 20 album Islands. Teenage Wildlife also includes a brand new song “Darkest Hour Of The Night” alongside thirteen Top 40 singles amid an array of the band’s recorded history.\n\nAtmosphere – Whenever CD/2xLP (Rhymesayers)\n\nFor over 20 years, Atmosphere have pursued the underbelly of what it means to be human with a rabid curiosity. Ant’s dusky production has provided the pulse for Slug’s evolving and matter-of-fact pen. As Slug transitioned from throwing-up-in-the-backseat-raps to holding-hands-when-you-cross-the-street-raps, Ant has grown to be a master of crate digging and unearthing the humanity of a drum loop. Thriving at the intersection of guttural and self-effacing, Atmosphere will go down as some of America’s best archivists. On Whenever, the duo continue to move in lockstep. Within the minutiae lie clues they’re still struggling with mortality and the need to protect emotional energy, as on previous releases, but there’s a quiet romanticism now, with Slug sounding – reluctantly – in love with life. And no other producer can pull truths out of a rapper like Ant fishes the blues out of Slug.\n\nLauren Auder – Two Caves In CD/LP (Harvest)\n\nLondon-based Lauren Auder began lending experimental beats and spectral vocals to artists such as Jeshi and Slowthai. The resultant interpretations of hip-hop, post-rock and noise gave rise to the expansive sonic palette of her debut EP Who Carry’s You. The 21-year-old then old took to the Jura mountains with bandmate & collaborator DVIANCE to imagine it’s follow-up: Two Caves In. With similar fluid regard to genre, Two Caves in revels with fevered grace in a trajectory through innocence and coming of age.\n\nDanny Barnes – Man On Fire CD/LP (ATO)\n\nThe new album from the banjo virtuoso was executive produced by Dave Matthews and finds Barnes collaborating with musical legends including Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones on bass and mandolin, Bill Frisell on guitar and Matt Chamberlain on percussion. With Man On Fire, Barnes insists that we not only bear witness but that we also step outside of ourselves, that we treat our brothers and sisters with the empathy and grace they deserve.\n\nKenny Barron/Dave Holland Trio featuring Jonathan Blake – Without Deception CD/LP (Dare2)\n\nWithout Deception is the intimate and adventurous debut recording by the Kenny Barron / Dave Holland Trio featuring Johnathan Blake. The album expands on the fruitful relationship forged by the two jazz icons over the course of more than three decades with the rejuvenating addition of the masterful young drummer.\n\nBlue Öyster Cult – Agents Of Fortune CD+DVD/LP (Frontiers)\n\nIn celebration of the 40th anniversary of their widely celebrated Agents Of Fortune, Blue Öyster Cult performed the seminal album in its entirety at an exclusive concert for the Audience Music Network on Monday April 18, 2016 at Red Studios in Hollywood, CA. [Stand-alone Blu-ray edition also available.]\n\nBody Count – Carnivore CD/LP (Century Media)\n\nSeventh album from the metal band fronted by rapper/actor Ice T.\n\nBrandy Clark – Your Life Is A Record CD (WB)\n\nFew artists understand the human condition like six-time Grammy nominee Brandy Clark. Working again with acclaimed producer Jay Joyce, Your Life Is A Record takes her unerring eye for detail and a genre-melting sense of melody to examine personal truths, revelations and emancipations with wit, grace and compassion. Working with just four acoustic-based musicians, intimacy was the goal. Memphis strings and horns, guest appearances from Randy Newman (Bigger Boat) and guitarist John Osborne color in the sketches – creating a depth to what is easily Clark’s most revelatory record yet.\n\nColosso – Apocalypse CD (Transcending Obscure)\n\nA breathtaking and refreshingly diverse album showcasing the myriad aspects of this bold and innovative death metal band without compromising on their aggressive, apocalyptic sound.\n\nCornershop – England Is A Garden 2xLP (Ample Play)\n\nIn the latest of a series of albums that have mirrored the exceptional story of the band itself, Cornershop return with England Is A Garden. It is an album that strides in an upbeat fashion, to deliver a full listening experience, bringing songs of experience, empire, protest and humor, steeped in the way only Tjinder Singh would come with. The anvil here is music itself, and a celebration of Tjinder’s birth place – The Black Country, which also gave birth to heavy metal that has gone on to influence the world to dirty rock, whether the streets are lined with pylons or palm trees, the Black Country has allowed us to see things differently. [Limited green colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nCream – Goodbye Tour – Live 1968 4xCD (Polydor)\n\nThe first authorized release of these four historic complete 1968 concerts.

[Vinyl edition due March 27.]\n\nDisq – Collector CD/LP/Cassette (Saddle Creek)\n\nDisq have assembled a razor-sharp, teetering-on-the-edge-of-chaos melange of sounds, experiences, memories, and influences: gnarled power pop, anxious post-punk, warm psych-folk, and hectic, formless, tongue-in-cheek indie rock. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nDråpsnatt – I Denna Skog [Reissue/2009] CD/LP (Nordvis)\n\nRecently reissued on vinyl – now back-in-print on CD.

The Game locked down a place in the pantheon alongside greats of both coasts by a combination of bar-for-bar bravado, provocative observation, hard-hitting hooks, and sharp introspection. And now the prolific rapper returns with his ninth album fittingly titled, Born 2 Rap.\n\nLuke Haines/Peter Buck – Beat Poetry For Survivalists CD/LP (Omnivore)\n\nBeat Poetry For Survivalists is the collaboration between Peter Buck and Luke Haines. Peter Buck was the guitarist for one of the biggest bands in the world, R.E.M. Luke Haines was the guitarist for The Auteurs. The Auteurs were not the biggest band in the world. They were pretty good though. Luke Haines also does paintings of Lou Reed. One day, Peter Buck bought one of Luke Haines’ Lou Reed paintings (for £99.00) They had never met before but decided that the fates had brought them together and they should write some songs together and make an album. Beat Poetry For Survivalists is that album. With songs about legendary rocket scientist and occultist Jack Parsons, The Enfield Hauntings, (of 1978) a post-apocalyptic radio station that only plays Donovan records, Bigfoot, and Pol Pot.\n\nHarem Scarem – Change The World CD/LP (Frontiers)\n\nNew album from the Canadian rockers.

Of course, this is Stephen Malkmus of Pavement and those great records with the Jicks, so this might be rootsy but it’s also fresh, unpredictable, infectious and imaginative: ACC Kirtan, Xian Man, The Greatest Own in Legal History, Cash Up and more tracks made with Matt Sweeney, Spooner Oldham and the Decembrists’ Chris Funk.\n\nMassicot – Kratt CD/LP (Bongo Joe)\n\nMassicot’s latest album occupies a strange and Wonderful Reuleaux triangle situated between the traditional spiritual story telling mysticism of North European pagan folklore, Latin and Middle Eastern inspired polyrythms and post punk. It’s meandering arrangements are full and juicy, yet formed from the simplest elements, they are minimal, sculpted and reBined. Bouncing and multi-timbral percussive tapestries are coupled with thick pulsating baselines to form tightly wound rolling beats, accented by citric guitar hooks that bring to mind the percussive pique and jag of Glenn Branca or talking heads and soothed by Latvian chant-like and choral vocal melodies, Massicot choreograph a sort of carnival carousel dance eternal that locks in the mind and lures the body. The groove is key, mechanical, yet nuanced, seductive and human.\n\nThe Mastersons – No Time For Love Songs CD/LP (Red House)\n\nThe Mastersons are singer-songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Chris Masterson and Eleanor Whitmore. Longtime members of Steve Earle’s band the Dukes, the musical and marital twosome make inspired albums of their own vivid, deeply humanistic songs. Their fourth album, No Time For Love Songs, marks the 10th anniversary of their partnership and creative journey with a collection of songs that could easily serve as the soundtrack to our lives-or at least one version of it.\n\nMayhem – Out From The Dark [Reissue/1996] CD (Peacville)\n\nOut from The Dark is a demo album by the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem.

While sonically distinctly different than its predecessor, Circles features many of the hallmarks for which Swimming was critically-acclaimed upon its release – Miller further realizing his singing voice in addition to rapping, live instrumentation and earnest, confessional lyrical content.\n\nMatthew Morrison – Disney Dreamin’ with Matthew Morrison CD (Walt Disney)\n\nEmmy, Tony, and Golden Globe nominated artist Matthew Morrison releases a fresh contemporary take on some of his favorite iconic Disney songs.

Brooklyn “laboratory.” Fight is a spectrum of sonic outbursts designed to empower and uplift.\n\nP.E. – Person CD/LP (Wharf Cat)\n\nThe 12 tracks from P.E.’s snarling debut, Person, display the band members’ collective experience in piecing together unforgettable compositions then gleefully tearing them apart at the seams, while the album’s clattering industrial percussion, zigzagging synths and sax, and colorful percussion, dystopian poetry maintain the spark of P.E.’s improvisational dystopian bent. The result is a sonic lexicon that reflects the unnatural surroundings of their adopted home in NYC – chaotic yet alluring, gnarly yet beautiful, gritty yet fun.\n\nPears – Pears CD/LP (Fat Wreck Chords)\n\nThird full-length album from the New Orleans-based punks.\n\nPhantogram – Ceremony CD/LP (Republic)\n\nGenre-defying alt-rock duo Phantogram – comprised of lifelong friends Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel – have continued to change the zeitgeist for almost a decade now by consistently challenging it with their signature blend of hard-hitting beats, guitar-driven dark psychedelia and electronic pop.

Written as a sequel to 2018’s Loner, Superstar “plays out like an epic movie about the pursuit of fame and fortune,’ Rose states. ‘I’ve always been fascinated by this pursuit, but what’s even more fascinating is what happens when it fails.” Indeed, gone are the successful Hollywood hunks and starlets of old.

Throughout the revelatory 12-song album, she reflects on gratitude, compassion, authenticity and optimism, questioning what comprises character, and lifting herself up in the process. Honoring the resilience of the human spirit, Sage’s striking songs remind us that sometimes “it’s ok to not be ok.”\n\nSaturnalia Temple – Gravity CD/LP (Listenable)\n\nIn their decade of existence, Saturnalia Temple has created their own niche of occult doom metal with their unique brand of psychedelia.\n\nSaxophones – Eternity Bay CD/LP (Full Time Hobby)\n\nDrawing from fifties exotica, west coast jazz, and seventies Italian lyricism, drama seeps into Saxophones’ deceptively simple sound, transforming dreamy surf pop into thoughtfully textured pieces, with a spaciousness at their core.\n\nScarab – Martyrs Of The Storm CD/LP (ViciSolum Productions)\n\nNew album from the Egyptian death metal act.\n\nSemblant – Obscura CD (Frontiers)\n\nNew release from the the Brazilian dark/melodic death metal band.\n\nSession Victim – Needledrop CD/LP (Night Time Stories)\n\nGerman duo Session Victim’s fourth studio album via Night Time Stories, the London based sister label to the coveted LateNightTales, marks a notable move towards the downtempo dynamic of artists like Nightmares on Wax DJ Shadow and Portishead. Artists that have all played a strong influence in Session Victim’s variety of output over the last decade. Needledrop provides a suite of both uplifting and easy-listening moments refined and understated individually yet cohesively crafted with the honest musicianship and inarguable credentials.\n\nWill Sexton – Don’t Walk The Darkness CD/LP (Big Legal Mess)\n\nTexas guitar legend Will Sexton teams up with New Orleans veterans the Iguanas for his first solo album in over a decade, the 10-track roots rock classic Don’t Walk the Darkness.

Following the subversive sheen of 2018’s In A Poem Unlimited, Remy has taken a deeply introspective about-face to produce a set of mindful compositions on hindsight, the passage of time, the delicate balance of the conscious and the unconscious, and the pursuit of a radical empathy. Remy worked with co-writers Basia Bulat and Rich Morel to develop the core of Heavy Light, a set of songs conceived as a richly arranged balance between orchestral percussion (as arranged by percussionist Ed Squires) and the human voice.\n\nViscera – Obsidian CD (Unique Leader)\n\nNew release from the UK death metal band.

But the story of Sean Bonniwell is one of the saddest. He and his band The Music Machine broke through in 1966 with “Talk Talk” and the accompanying album (Turn On) The Music Machine. Because the record came out on the thinly-resourced Original Sound label, though, tour support, promotion, and, most importantly, royalties were in short supply, causing the band to disintegrate in short order. Limited colored vinyl pressing.\n\nBonny Doon – Blue Stage Sessions LP (Third Man)\n\nA live album recorded at the Third Man Detroit location from Motor City’s sweetest psych-folk groovers, Bonny Doon.

Gilmour’s music has been described by Uncut as sounding like some parallel-universe collaboration between Brian Eno and electro-jazz innovator Raymond Scott with wistful Arthur Russell-like sighs.\n\nSinne Eeg – We’ve Just Begun LP (BFM Jazz)\n\nNew release from Danish jazz vocalist. Eeg has received a number of recognitions and positive reviews both nationally and internationally, and is considered among the best female jazz vocalists currently in Scandinavia.\n\nStella Emmett – Admirer LP (Ship To Shore)\n\nTwo summers ago, Stella Kortchmar started making Admirer. Kortchmar and co-producer Mike Dvorscak knew they wanted to make a full-length electronic pop record, a collection of songs tied to the better parts of the warmer months. Between Albany and White Plains, New York, the duo spent the long summer days writing, recording, and polishing the LP while following a recipe: Build the songs up, strip them back down, add extra ingredients (harmonies, synth pads, collegiate samples) with ease and purpose. Most importantly, indulge in the collaborative nature of it all. The outcome is a tiered cake, nuanced, layered, and light – familiar in structure and unique in taste.\n\nPricilla Ermell – Origens Da Luz LP (Music From Memory)\n\nA retrospective Brazilian composer and multi-instrumentalist Priscilla Ermel Origens Da Luz brings together a selection of recordings drawn from a body of work that was originally recorded between 1986 and 1994.\n\nNoel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds – Blue Moon Rising 12” (Caroline)\n\nNew EP from the former Oasis guitarist and songwriter.

Then in 1995, using extensive samples from that German recording alongside a free rock ensemble and traditional Asian instruments, Otomo Yoshihide and his Ground Zero band issued a terrific and definitive rendition of that opera, in the form of a noisy sound collage. We reunited the Japanese and original German versions on that record.\n\nOtis Houston Jr. – America [Reissue/2006] LP (Post Present Medium)\n\nOtis Houston Jr. recorded the songs for America in three locations around Harlem and the Bronx in 2006, the year the album was originally self-released. Makeshift studios that no longer exist provide a telling context for his autobiographical storytelling. Prerecorded beats made by studio owners were picked based on which suited his cadence laden poetry best and often-times on America the songs repeat, with different lyrics, transforming themselves. Houston Jr., a raconteur and quick-witted wordsmith has so much to say, that when there is a groove, he doesn’t want to let it go, but rather float around and experiment. Influenced by Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye and the like, his strong voice and natural ability to use slogans give this album a cunning stance.\n\nRowland S.

Records label and its assorted imprints. Hale’s talent was so distinctive that when Stone finally let Hale step out of the studio shadows to record his own album on the Cat imprint, the effects were immediate and long-lasting. Featuring contributions from Thomas, Wright, Latimore, and Jaco Pastorius (under the name Nelson “Jocko” Padron), 1974’s Party Down scored a No. 2 hit with its title track and has been repeatedly sampled by latter-day rap artists ranging from People Under the Stairs to Jay Z. himself (the “Party Life” track on his American Gangster album).

Jeff Mercel was there, playing drums with Mercury Rev – Paul was there as guitar tech for Sparklehorse’s Mark Linkous, and Jason was there on the same bus as Jeff and his upstate compatriots in his official capacity as ride-along-poet-in-residence. Flash forward 20 years and to the first item of official Miracle Whips business which was a field trip to the local Goodwill to purchase a large and unwieldy 1970’s era cast iron electric typewriter in order to place it, and themselves, on Jason’s porch every weekend and get to work on writing these damn songs.\n\nNegative Approach – Tied Down [Reissue/1983] LP (Touch And Go)\n\nTranslucent purple vinyl in purple jacket.
