Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie present a feast of great music and chat for weekend breakfast

Today they are joined by Eirik Glambek Bøe of Norwegian indie-folk duo Kings Of Convenience. The critically acclaimed band are back with their first new music in a decade. Their new album ‘Peace or Love,’ due out later this month, was recorded over five years in five different cities. The pair met at school in Bergen, Norway and performed together in rock band Skog before forming Kings Of Convenience as a duo in 1999. With singles including ‘Toxic Girl’ and ‘Winning a Battle, Losing the War' and three albums released between 1999 and 2009, their acoustic sound and songwriting gained them a loyal cult following. Eirik chats to Mark and Stuart about their eagerly-awaited fourth album.
