Although Uttie Is known about the objects, “I think It’s fair to say they will be giant gaseous bodies, not unlike Jupiter,\" said Bruce Camp- bell, research associate at Dominion Aslrophysical Observatory In Vic- toria, British Columbia. The objects roust be studied fur- ther before- they could be -labeled planets, but their masses lie rouch closer to those of planets than of stare, hc-said. Campbell spoke In an Interview be- fore presenting the work Thursday at a Joint meeting of the American Astronomical . Society ’and Canadian Astronomical Society In Vancouver, Brltlsh^olumbia. -Scientists have long tried-to find planets outside the solar system, driven by potential clues to understanding the sun’s planetary system amt the possibility of finding life elsewhere. But previous claims of detecting other planets have not withstood sdcntl(ic-.scru(iny. Campbell said - he believes his evidence is stronger because o( a new 'method that allowed detecting smaller celestial bodies; and because seven out of 16 stare studied 'showed evidence of such bodies. In interviews, other astronomers said they would .have to look closely at (he data, before ' evaluating whether it formed a firmer case. But “I think that it is a strong observation.” said William Baum, director ol-planctary research at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. ArU. \"It appears to be a solid piece of work.” — The technique Campbell’s team used “appcare .to he a major .step forward,” he said. The new evidence Is based on six years of observing IG stars with sun- like masses about S9 trillion mBcs to 295 trillion mites from Earth. The work was ilone at the Canada-Francc-ilawaii Telescope In Hiiwall. Working -with Campbell were Gordon Walker and Stephenson ■Ynng of the University ot British Columbia in Vancouver. The researchers measured liny variations in the speed at which the stars were moving toward or away from Earth, becausc'thc variations 'would betray the gravitational lugs of bodies orbiting the stars.

Tnc finding suggests competing hospjtals use ex- pensive new technologies In their effo^ to attract new patients and doctors, said the study, which was based on hospital bills In 1982. Since then, some experts contended, price has become more important in hospital competillon, especially because of changes in federal Medicare reimbursement policies. Price competition works best when the consumer can readily compare the quality of products, which is not the case with hospitals, said the report published in today's Journal of the American Medi- cal Association.

EVELYN DONNELLY Twin Falls Good fishing on the way out Most anglers in soulhem Idaho know that the Idaho Fish and Game has lifted bag llmltson some of our area reservoirs: It is my humble opinion that they have goofed, big time. The trout that 1 caught and released two' weeks ago ( before the new regulations) will probably be caught again and stuffed in a freezer where it will reside until it's thrown out lo the cat. who probably wouldn’t touch it L dililJ sending a lank truck to South Dakota for a load of expensive fish feed (shiners for walleye) when we have trout and bass that could be salvaged and relocated, possibly even in the Snake River, where most people can enjoy them. Idaho Fish and Game will say “We can raise them cheaper than we can salvage them.” Bull! The fish 1 caught were at least two or three years old. They can't raise a fish to that size economically. 1 would have to sec 17-lnch trout dumped from Ihe stocking truck to feel that we got a fairshakc. I know this won’t happen. In the coming years we will sec a decline in the angling opportunities that we enjoyed in Ihcpast. We will sec a decline much like that suffered after the drought of '77, which we haven’t recovered from completely yet! I believe that Idaho Fish and Game is so worried about the dollar that they have been making poor management decisions. Ever y ■year we see more waters opened froni January toDcccmbcr. Some waters can take pressure like that, some can’t. The great fishing In southern Idaho will be talked about for years after it Is gone, which by the way won’t be far in the future if Idaho Fish and Game keeps making these management decisions. JOHN VANDERWALKER Illeqal war will be stopped At the funeral of CIA director William Casey, the presiding bishop of the Long Island Diocese of Rockville Center, John R. McGann spoke out against the illegal war against Nicaragua being waged by the Con*, tras, the so-called freedom fighters, who are supported by our government. The situation in Central America is, os Bishop McGann said, a matter of life and death. As in Nazi Germany, the issue is not - solely political, but primarily moral. No end can justify the killing and maiming of Inoo- ' cent men, women and children. It is heartening to know that the majority of the spiritual leaders of this country give testimony to the truth regardless of the. cur-l rent administration’s disdain for their message.

This in the late 1960s 01^ again in the eailytSSOs. Tbe l36Ds’ shift sharply reduced the Soviet reqczremeiit for nnclear farces. Previously, had ruled that a world war would r- » » rt !ahr y mvolve nucIcar strikes on tbe SoTieC Union. In sacb circamstances. the op- icncB Soviet strategy was to strike at tbe Ueded Slates if war was seen to be cnaroidable. This required mtclear sqperiorily and no arms control. Tbe doctrine hftd that escalation to 30 intercontinental exchange was no toeger icevilabfe. and the new strategy of U.S. strikes on the USSR meant f. j g i i i' g Crrgryf OP North America. This ramaved the need for nuclear superiori- IT, a new requirement for pxrity at as low a level as could be negoti- ated. In tbe late 1960s. the Soviets reversed their policy cs arms control, resulting in cidlisg short the deployment of third-- generatioa ICBMs. At theend of the 1970s, the replacement of these missiles by fbur* Cb-geceratida systemswasalsocntsbort,tO- cenfarm to the SALTn (Strategic Arms — — limitaticnsTreaty) restrictions. Th<^ drreicpcnects led directly lo Reykjavik and to Gcrtiachev's prop<»aI to reduce nuclear aisecalstazeroov^a 15-year period. . The 1960s’ doctrinal shift favored reduced nuclear inventories but increased the re- quirement for conventional forces. Since the U.S. military-industrial base would be spared, it was essential that the United Slates be denied the bridgehead in Europe that worked so well In World War II. but U.S. forces from the continent had to be evicted without precipitating intercontinental escalation. In 1967-68, the Soviets set about restructuring their forces to provide the ca- pability, using conventional means only, to disable the nuclear delivery systems of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to mount a blitzkrieg into Western Europe. A variant of this wartime requirement to occupy Western Europe had existed since the early 1950s and had always incurred heavy political costs. The new Soviet con- ventional capability was largely in place, despite the political costs, by the second half of the 1970s. But a change In military doc- trine in the early 1980s provided the oppor- tunity to relax thb constraint on Soviet foreign policy and reduce its demands on the Soviet economy. The Soviets had always assumed that ma- jor conflict with the United Slates would in- volve world war. But in between 1979 and 1982 there emerged the concrete possibility of major conflict with the United Slates in - - the area nortliof the Persian Gulf, and the Soviet leadership had to decide whether or not such conflict could be contained. If escalation to world war was inevitable, then Soviet forces were already poised and, at the appropriate moment, they wouud launch an offensive Into Western Europe. If, however, escalation was not inevitable, (hen the -priority objective would be to contain the war, there would be no offensive Into Europe, and the Soviets would need to hold in the west while engaging U.S. forces lo the south. MIKHAIL GORBACHEV Running with the ball Evidence is mounting that the Soviets decided that such a conflict might be con- tained. There Is the new structure of theater commands, the new emphasis in their military writing on strategic defensive operations, and their new approach to con- ventional arms control, including proposals for sweeping reductions in the two sides’ forces. But this change in doctrine Implies more than the possibility of adopting a defensive po'sturc facing Europe. Fpr more than70 years, an enduring element of t Moscow's defense policy has been the rd- quircmcht to bc'abic to niounl'a cbhUnen- tal-scalc offensive to the west. By downgrading this enduring strategic imperative, the Soviets have removed a lin- chpin from the framework of Soviet strategic thinking and allowed political and economic factors to assume a new salience. Another concrete factor that Is pushing the Soviets towards \"new thinking\" about foreign and defense policy Is the impending \"rcvolullon in mllUary affairs\" being generated by emerging technologies. This threatens a new arms race, which the Soviets desperately need to avoid. One way Is to admit the Interactive nature of the arms race and to act to dampen it. Another is to redefine the nature of the security en- vironment and hence the nature of Soviet military requirements. The changes In military doctrine have madcboththcseapproachcsposslblcond - both have been adopted. Undoubtedly, this “ncw.pollUcal thinking\" serves Soviet Inter- ests, but most of the underlying conclusloos were reached long ago by thinkers in the West. Over the years, western leaders have paid lip service to many of those ideas, but It now looks as if the Soviet leadership is abopl to take them seriously. We arc fac<^ with a new Soviet line, and the weight of evidence argues that this is not a taetteal adjustment but a fundamental new direction In Soviet defense and foreign policy. The West has proved adept at responding to Soviet threats. Will It be equally suc- cessful in responding to this new typed challenge?

This gain included a $1.6 billion fisc in manufacturing payrolls, which contrasted with a $1.3 billion decline in April. Economists said tbe wage gains in manufacturing reflected Increased production spur- red by higher export sales and they predicted this trend should strengthen in the months ahead. Farm income fell $11 billion in May compared with a $6.7 billion April decline. The decreases were al- tributed to declines In govcmmenl subsidy payments. Excluding gov- cmmenl aid, farm Incomes would have risen small amounts In both months.

South KorcatAP) - Tens of thousands of students seized the hc.irt of the city Thursday during massive street battles that erupted after police used tear gas to.brcak up tnarches by people demanding a ban on tear gas. Violence raged in Seoul and at least seven other major cities as op* position groups held an ••Anti-Tear Gas Day^* to demand the authoritarian government slop us- ing the powerful irritant to suppress politicaldisscnt. •'Expel tear gas from our land,” protesters in the capital and other cities chanted. '•Destroy the military dictatorsiiip.” ' But police repeatedly used tear gas to break up what had been large- ly peaceful marches. Hordes of stu- dents briefly seized the center of the city and trapped scores of riot police. Students stood and saniy-Uic coun- try's national anthem 'as they cheered and applauded their viclory. \"We love our country.\" students in jeans and T-shirts shouted before police recaptured the area. President Chun Doo-hwan's gov- ernment was reported to be con- sidering \"drastic measures” to end the worst political violence the country has seen since it took power in 1980. A crowd estlnzated at 80,000 peo- ple, made up of students, workers and residents, surgeej through the southern city of Pusan chanting, \"Down with military dictatorship.” Police advancing in massed forma- tions fired volleys of tear gas to con- trol the protests in the country’s se- cond largest city. Thousands of protesters carrying South Korean flags battled police in the southern city of Taegu and at- tacked three police- stations. Stu- dents fought police who tried to slop them swarming off campuses in the southern city of Kwangju. There were street battles in the central ci- ty of Taejon. Thousands have been Injured in the fighting, but there have been no confirmed deaths. So tar, the riot police have not carried guns and have relied mainy on tear gas and truncheons. Special attack squads arc'tralned In martial arls. Scores of people were injured and several students were hit at close range by riflc-fjred tear gas canisters. But officials declined to provide any figures. About 80 riot police were seized when .students overran their unit after crowds seized the main square in front of tlic Bank of Korea and held it for nearly an hour. Protesters overran another unit of about 30 men in front of the city’s main railway station and held it for about two hours. Kneeling officers begged the at- tackers to stop beating them. But enraged students hurled rocks from a few feet away, hit and kicked the huddled police and stripped them of their weapons and equipment. LONDON <AP).— Diplomatic ties between Britain and\" Iran were reduced to a caretaker basii Thursday as part of a dispute that started with the arrest of an Iranian official accused of shop- lifting three pairs of socks and a plastic purse.

From that seed grew a crisis that will hamper thou- sands of travelers and $S00 million In annual trade for lack of diplomatic backup. Britain brought four diplomats home from Tehran.

ADVERTISEMENT Reprint from Albuquerque Tribune Device may increase gas mileage by 22% BOSTON - National Fudsaver Corp. of Boston lias developed a simple automotive accessory iltat increases gas mileage by 22 v.'«. The Gasaver, wliich takes only 10 minutes 10 install, releases microscopic quantities of plati- num into the air-fuel mixture entering the engine. Platinum has the unique ability of making unburnt fuel burn. With platinum in the flame zone, you increase ihcpcrccntagcorfud burning in the engine front 68^<'e to 90%. Normally, that 22% of liie fuel would only burn ifil came in con- tact with titc platintim coated sur- faces of a catalytic converter. Unfoniinaicly, litis converter process takes place outside of tlic engine, where the energy pro- duced is lost. With the Gasaver dispensing platinum into the combustion chambers, 22% more of eaclt gallon burns inside the engine so that 22% fewer gallons arc retjuired to drive the same distance. The process works on both leaded and unleaded gasoline, and meets the emission standards of all stales. I-edcral Judge Waiter J. Skinner concluded the five-year admin- istrative procedure siudyitig the Gasaver by stating; \"Independent testing show’s greater fuel savii;.-^ with the Gasaver than the 22-V- claimed by its developer Naiioi.al Fuelsavcr Corp.\" The government had alrca.ly confirmed in I9K4 that llic Gasaver raises the octane -if gasoline, eliminating the need u>r premium fuel.

In this regard, we have previously held that a parent's extramarital sexual rela- tionship alone is insufficient to justify a change in custody.\" the court said Wednesday. The case stemmed from a custody dispute between Jennifer Sanderson. Cedar City, and Robert L. Tryon. Tyron, who had other wives, had three children with Ms. Sanderson before Ihey split up and she started a relationship with a man who also hadolhcrwlves. thcdccislonsaid. Tryon forsook polygamy and went to court to gain' custody of' the children, contending they were liv- ing in an immoral environment where the mother and stepfather were not legally married. The judge agreed, and awarded him custody. However, the high court said the judge had made no ruling on who was the belter parent or what would be in the best interests of the children. The justices sent the ease back to circuit court for additional findings of fact. Polygamy was practiced within the Mormon Church until 1890. Since then the church has cxcommuni- ' cated those who advocate it, but it continues- to be practiced by followers of some offshoots of the church.
