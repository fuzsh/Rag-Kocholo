        "meta_description": "French postcard. Photo Sartony. A.N., Paris, series Les Vedettes de Cinéma, nr. 96.\n\t\n\t<b>Léon Mathot</b> was a French actor and director, born 1886 in Roubaix and died 1968 in Paris. Mathot became well-known for his role of Edmond Dantès in the French serial Le comte de Monte Christo (1918), directed by Henri Pouctal. He is also known for his role in Coeur fidèle (1923) by Jean Epstein.\n\t\n\tAfter passing his youth in Liège, Belgium, and following the Conservatory there, Léon Mathot started to play on stage in Lyon, then Brussels and Paris. Thanks to his friend Lucien Nonguet who shot short comedies at Pathé, Mathot started in cinema in 1906, playing extra’s, his first one being La course à la perruque, a André Deed comedy directed by Georges Hatot and André Heuzé. Between 1911 and 1914 he played in dozens of the Gontran comedies, often directed by Nonguet. Alongside he also played in dramatic films by directors Henri Andréani and Alfred Machin, mainly for the Belge-Cinéma. During the First World War Mathot switched to the Film d’Art company, where he worked with young director Abel Gance, such as in Les gaz mortels (1916). His collaboration with Henri Pouctal started with the film Volonté (1917) and culminated in 1917-1918 with the serial Le comte de Monte Christo, which made Mathot an over night star. Mathot played the leading character of Dumas’ classic novel, Edmond Dantès, who takes revenge on the people who had him imprisoned and forgotten, after he has come into possession of a huge treasure and a new identity. This was followed by other films by Pouctal like Travail (1919), a film in seven chapters on a steel factory, in which Mathot again had the male lead, opposite Huguette Duflos as the female leading character. Mathot’s reputation only grew during the 1920s while playing in popular French silent films like L'ami Fritz (René Hervil 1920), again with Duflos ; the serial L'empereur des pauvres (René Leprince 1922), with Gina Reilly; Cœur fidèle (Epstein 1923), with Gina Manès; L’Auberge Rouge (Epstein 1923), again with Manès; Mon oncle Benjamin (Leprince 1923), Le mirage de Paris (Jean Manoussi 1925), Le puits de Jacob (Edward José 1926), with Betty Blythe; Yasmina (André Hugon 1927), with Duflos; Le mystère de la Villa Rose (René Hervil &amp; Louis Mercanton 1930), with Simone Vaudry; and La maison de la flèche (Henri Fescourt 1930), with Annabella.\n\t\n\tWhen he sensed that his star was descending, Léon Mathot started to combine acting with directing, first with Carmine Gallone in Celle qui domine (1927) and afterwards with André Liabel in Dans l’ombre du harem (1928), L’instinct (1929) and L’appassionata (1929). When sound cinema became the norm in French cinema, Mathot exclusively focused on film direction. He only performed twice again in Passeport 13 444 (1931) which he directed himself and in Deuxième Bureau contre Kommandantur (1939) by René Jayet and Robert Bibal, his last role as actor. In the 1930s he first directed various vehicles for the comic singer George Milton (La bande à Bouboule, Bouboule 1er roi des nègres, Embrassez-moi, Nu comme un ver, Le comte Obligado) and the adaptation of an operetta for comedian Dranem (La Mascotte). He then focused on spy films, filming two of the four adventures of « Capitaine Benoît » after « Ceux du SR » by Charles-Robert Dumas (Les loups entre eux, 1936 et L’homme à abattre, 1937). He then switched again, adapting Gaston Leroux’ Chéri-Bibi (filmed 1938), starring Pierre Fresnay; it has been considered one of Mathot’s best films. In 1938 he also adapted Maurice Larroy’s novel Le révolté, which was scripted by the joung Henri-Georges Cluzot, and meant one of the first serious roles of René Dary (four years after, Mathot would direct her again in Forte tête, 1942). After a short return to comedy with Le bois sacré (1939) after the play by Flers and Cavailet, Mathot filmed Rappel immédiat (1939) with Erich von Stroheim and Mireille Balin, a striking spy film. He also tried his luck with exotic melodrama in Aloha, le chant des ïles (1937), starring Arletty, and showed interest in nomads in 1941 with Cartacalha, reine des gitans which confirmed the career of Viviane Romance. Critics appreciated Mathot’s adaptation of Daudet’s Fromont jeune et Risler aîné (1941), with Mireille Balin.\n\t\n\tAfter the war Mathot alternated melodrama (La route du bagne, 1945, with Viviane Romance), with ‘film policier’ (Le dolmen tragique, 1948, with Paulette Dubost) and adventure (La dernière chevauchée, 1948, with Balin and Jacques Dumesnil). Mathot also shot a pseudo-biographie of Marcel Cerdan, played by the famous boxer himself (L’homme aux mains d’argile, 1949). After having supervised La rue sans loi (1950), directed by Marcel Gibaud, Mathot ended his career with a short return to comedy (Mon gosse de père, 1953). Mathot was vice-chair (1938-1959) and later on chair of the Cinémathèque française (1959-1967). He was also chairman of the  l’Union Européenne des Techniciens du Film et de la Télévision.\n\t\n\tSources : French and English Wikipedia, IMDB.",
