        "text": "HONOLULU — The Hawaii state Legislature has advanced two bills that would allow some 17-year-olds the right to vote by next year’s primary election.\n\nThe bills passed the state House Government Reform Committee on Wednesday. The bills have a final state House committee to advance beyond before they are presented before the full House.\n\nThe new bills would allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections if their 18th birthday falls between the primary election and general election.\n\nUnder current state law, only those 18 or older are allowed to vote.\n\nIn 2022, the primary election takes place on Aug. 13 and the general election on Nov. 8.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Les Ihara Jr., who introduced the proposed bills, said because the state very often votes for Democrats, having a say in the primaries is important for equity.\n\n“The fairness issue is by the time they get to vote in the general elections, the major choices were already made from the primary elections,” said Ihara, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.\n\nAcross the U.S., 19 other states allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections, the newspaper reported.\n\nEarlier this legislative session, similar bills were introduced to pull the voting age down to 16, but the measures failed to gain traction."
