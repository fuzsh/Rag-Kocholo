        "text": "In early June, the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawai‘i (\"ACLU of Hawai‘i\") sent a questionnaire to the 160 candidates running for Hawai‘i State Senate and State House in 2020. We crafted this questionnaire to highlight key civil rights and civil liberties issues affecting the people of Hawai‘i and to allow voters to make informed decisions about who represents them at the Legislature. Topics include privacy and technology, criminal legal reform, policing, education justice, houselessness, and the criminalization of poverty. Candidates were given the option of selecting “YES,” “NO” or “PREFER NOT TO ANSWER,” and were able to elaborate on their position for each question.\n\nLearn more about the ACLU of Hawaii's policy work.\n\nThe ACLU of Hawai‘i is 501(c)(4) nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to defending the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the U.S. and state constitutions. The ACLU of Hawai‘i does not endorse or oppose candidates for elected office, but offered this opportunity to candidates to explain their positions on key civil rights issues to the communities they hope to serve. This questionnaire was sent to all candidates running for Hawai‘i State House and State Senate in the 2020 election. The intent of this questionnaire is for the sole purpose of producing and disseminating informational or educational communications that are not made to influence the outcome of an election, question, or issue on a ballot."
