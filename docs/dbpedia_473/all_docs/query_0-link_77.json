        "text": "I\n\nFriday, September 11, 1998\n\nFunds from Bishop Estate’s\n\nnonbid contractors were allegedly\n\nused to cover for Marshall Ige\n\nand Milton Holt\n\nCOMPLETE TEXT:\n\nAttorney General’s Petition for Removal\n\nBy Mike Yuen\n\nStar-Bulletin Bishop Estate trustees, for years suspected as influence peddlers in the corridors of power, have been accused of directing a scheme in which nearly $49,300 in illegal campaign contributions were paid to two isle politicians. The alleged payoffs: $18,300 to Senate Government Operations Co-chairman Marshall Ige. $31,000 to former Senate Vice President Milton Holt. That’s the assertion of Attorney General Margery Bronster, who said funds from the estate’s nonbid contractors were used to cover the campaign debts of Ige and Holt. But Ige maintains that he had no knowledge of an alleged bogus billing scheme supposedly used to conceal how a 1994 campaign debt of $18,261.71 was paid. Nonetheless, Ige said the state attorney general’s office has told him that he is a target in connection with Bronster’s investigation of Bishop Estate. The allegation against Ige (D, Kaneohe) and a similar one against Holt — with a campaign debt of $31,025.16 — were cited in a 58-page petition that Bronster filed yesterday with state Probate Court. The petition seeks the permanent removal of trustees Henry Peters, Richard “Dickie” Wong and Lokelani Lindsey. Peters is a former House speaker; Wong, a former Senate president. Bronster’s report asserts that the three majority trustees used trust assets to enrich themselves. The report also states that possibly all five trustees knew of illegal campaign contributions to Ige and Holt and of lobbying expenses used to entertain lawmakers. The expenses, the report states, weren’t disclosed to the state Ethics Commission or the federal Internal Revenue Service. Estate critics have long said that the trust, the state’s largest private landowner, uses its clout to gain influence at the Legislature. Critics also are convinced that trustee appointments have been used as political plums for key lawmakers who protected the estate’s interests. Holt, 45, an estate employee since 1987 who is now a special projects officer, could not be reached yesterday. His attorney, Reginald Minn, said he had no comment about the latest allegations involving his client. The FBI and the city prosecutor’s office have been examining Holt’s campaign finances; Holt allegedly used campaign funds for his personal benefit. Bronster declined to say if any wrongdoing alleged in her report would lead to criminal charges.\n\nGraphics firm was owed\n\nIge, a Peters protege who served as Peters’ vice speaker in the House, said he learned about the allegations when he answered a subpoena from Bronster about 1-1/2 months ago. Ige, 44, acknowledged that following his unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1994, he owed $18,262.71 to Ryan’s Graphics Corp., whose clients also included Holt. Bronster, in her petition, said Ryan’s Graphics contacted Holt for help in collecting what was owed by Ige, who was elected to the Senate in 1996. A Bishop Estate employee — whom Bronster did not identify — supposedly called officials at Ryan’s and told them to bill Ige’s campaign debt to Kajioka, Okada, Yamachi Architects Inc. Kajioka, which has received nonbid contracts from the trust, then paid the bogus invoice, Bronster said. A similar scheme to pay off Holt’s campaign debts involved Kajioka and several other firms receiving nonbid contracts from the estate, she added. The firms, Bronster said, “were receiving, have received and continue to receive lucrative nonbid contracts from the trust.”\n\nBogus invoices alleged\n\nPrincipals of the companies did not return telephone calls from the Star-Bulletin yesterday. Bronster said after Holt lost his re-election bid in 1996 to then-Rep. Suzanne Chun Oakland (D, Liliha), he owed $12,334.44 to Ryan’s Graphics, which was paid by parceling the campaign debt into three separate false invoices of $4,111.48 each that were paid by Kajioka and two engineering firms, Ronald N.S. Ho & Associates Inc. and Sato & Associates Inc. Holt also owed Starr Seigle McCombs Inc., his media and advertising consultants, $18,690.72 that the firm had paid Ryan’s Graphics, Bronster said. She gave this account as to what subsequently unfolded:\n\nYukio Takemoto, chief executive for the estate’s budget and review group, who reports directly to Peters, succeeded in getting another trust nonbid contractor, the engineering firm of Akinaka & Associates Ltd., to help with Holt’s debt. In 1993, Takemoto was forced to resign as state budget director when a special Senate investigative panel raised questions about his role in state nonbid contracts. He was never charged with any wrongdoing. Takemoto told the Akinaka firm that the Kajioka company would get in touch, which it did. Shortly thereafter, a Bishop Estate employee — whom Bronster did not identify — ordered Ryan’s Graphics to send four bogus invoices — each for $4,672.68, which is one-fourth of the debt of $18,690.72 — to Kajioka, Ho & Associates, Akinaka & Associates and Okita, Kunimitsu & Associates Inc., an architectural firm. The four companies paid the bogus charges.\n\n‘It seems peculiar’\n\nAsked if he thought it was odd that an architectural firm had paid off his campaign debt, Ige said: “I did not know about it. So now that you mention it, of course it seems peculiar. But I didn’t know about it at the time.” Ige said he was trying to settle his debt with Ryan’s by paying the firm several hundred dollars each chance he got. He will be paying the Kajioka company $4,000 to reimburse the firm for its payment and then will be paying the balance of more than $14,000 off with interest, Ige said. Ige added that he knew that he owed Ryan’s more than $18,000, but he could not explain why that debt never showed on the reports he filed with the state Campaign Spending Commission. His wife, Caryn Ige, is treasurer of his campaign committee. She didn’t know anything “because everything comes through me,” Ige said. “I accept full responsibility. It’s not her. We got no bills (showing the $18,262.71 debt).” Ige said he is ensnared in a politically motivated investigation meant to enhance Democratic Gov. Ben Cayetano’s re-election hopes simply because he is Peters’ friend. That’s not true, Cayetano said. He added that the evidence came from the Bishop Estate’s own files. The executive director of the state Campaign Spending Commission, Robert Watada, said the panel is conducting its own investigation into other “suspicious and questionable” aspects of Ige’s campaign finances. He declined to provide details.\n\nBronster: Trustees,\n\nnot estate, gained in deals\n\nShe claims to have found\n\nkickbacks to Peters and Wong,\n\nmisuse of workers and\n\npoor investments\n\nBy Rick Daysog\n\nStar-Bulletin Attorney General Margery Bronster’s allegations that Bishop Estate trustees Henry Peters, Richard Wong and Lokelani Lindsey enriched themselves at the expense of the estate focus on several complicated business transactions. Here’s a thumbnail sketch of the deals and the major players involved: KALELE KAI\n\nBack in 1995, a partnership affiliated with Jeff Stone, a local developer and brother-in-law of Bishop Estate trustee Richard Wong, acquired the leasehold interest to the 229-unit Kalele Kai luxury condominium project in Hawaii Kai from California developer Peter Bedford. The fee interest to the Kalele Kai project previously was owned by the Bishop Estate. In January 1996, Stone bought an upscale Makiki condominium previously owned by Peters for an inflated price, according to Bronster. In May 1996, Stone’s Pacific Northwest Inc. bought Wong’s Makiki apartment at a similarly inflated price of $613,800. That same day, Pacific Northwest sold Wong a Kahala home for $1.1 million. Bronster believes the inflated prices paid by Stone’s companies represent a kickback for past real estate deals involving the estate. “The inflated prices were paid to Peters and Wong as a quid pro quo for conferring financial benefits on Wong’s brother-in-law, Jeffrey Stone,” Bronster said. Stone and Wong could not be reached for comment. But in the past they have denied any link between the trustees’ private deals and the estate. Wong said he recused himself from trust decisions affecting the Hawaii Kai project, but state investigators said he did not do so. KDP TECHNOLOGIES LLC\n\nBishop Estate’s trustees initially invested $500,000 in KDP but planned to invest as much $2 million in the New Jersey start-up, which operated an Internet database for the entertainment industry. Despite its promise, the estate put a halt to its investment in KDP late last year when a company director and acquaintance of Lindsey’s pleaded guilty to federal mail fraud and money laundering charges. The estate now plans to write off its $1.2 million that it put in the venture. According to the state, Wong and Peters used their position as trustees to help a second brother-in-law of Wong’s, Randy Stone, to obtain a consulting contract with KDP. MID OCEAN LTD.\n\nUntil this March, Henry Peters had served on the board of directors of this Bermuda reinsurance company, in which the estate is a big investor. For his efforts, Mid Ocean’s management granted Peters options to 4,500 shares of Mid Ocean stock. The company also paid him quarterly director’s fees. According to the state, the director’s fees and stock options belong to the trust, not Peters. They argue that Peters is enriching himself at the expense of the trust and its beneficiaries. Peters, meanwhile, said that his actions as a Mid Ocean director added millions of value to that estate investment. The estate’s initial $31 million investment in Mid Ocean, which recently merged with Bermuda-based Exel Ltd., is now worth more than $100 million. LINDSEY’S HAUULA HOME\n\nIn 1993, Lokelani Lindsey wanted to expand her beachfront home on the North Shore and filed for the necessary building permits. But rather than hiring a consultant with her own money, Lindsey used Bishop Estate employees to seek the permits, costing the estate about $12,000. After intense public criticism in 1997, Lindsey agreed to pay back the estate. Lindsey denied any wrongdoing. EDUCATION MANAGEMENT GROUP INC.\n\nIn 1994, the estate agreed to purchase more than $3 million worth of computer hardware, software and support services from this Scottsdale, Ariz. company, despite staff reports saying that the estate could purchase similar equipment much cheaper. The EMG products, which include distance-learning curriculum for schools, have not performed well, prompting the estate to develop its own education technology system. Lindsey, who played a key role in getting the estate to purchase EMG’s service, traveled to the 1997 Super Bowl with EMG officials on their private jet, the state said.\n\nLawmakers express shock,\n\nsurprise over allegations\n\nagainst trustees\n\nBy Mike Yuen\n\nStar-Bulletin Democratic Gov. Ben Cayetano has expressed .shock and surprise that a state senator and a former Senate leader have been implicated in schemes in which the Bishop Estate secretly directed its nonbid contractors to pay their campaign debts totaling nearly $49,300. Cayetano said the allegations made against Senate Government Operations Co-Chairman Marshall Ige (D, Kaneohe) and former Senate Vice President Milton Holt (D, Kapalama) by Attorney General Margery Bronster certainly won’t enhance the public’s view of public officials. But Cayetano added he hopes the public keeps in mind that it is a public official, meaning himself; and a public servant, Bronster, who are .trying to resolve this kind of problem. So I think the people out there are smart enough to know that the government is trying to clean up wrongdoing. Republican gubernatorial challenger Frank Fasi, former Honolulu mayor, said that if Ige and Holt did anything illegal, .let them pay the penalty. It could be at .the bar of justice where the fate of Ige and Holt is decided, Fasi said. Maui Mayor Linda Lingle, also seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, did not respond to the Star-Bulletin’s request for reaction to the allegations involving Ige and Holt. She did comment in general on Bronster’s report, saying Bronster .made the right decision and that estate trustees will all have their day in court. I don’t think, realistically, they could continue to do their job under this cloud. The allegations against Ige could affect his status in the Senate, which earlier this year stripped Senate Education Co-Chairman James Aki (D, Waianae) of his membership on the Consumer Protection and Transportation panels after he pleaded no-contest to promoting gambling on his Nanakuli property in 1994. Senate President Norman Mizuguchi (D, Aiea) said he will be reviewing Bronster’s report to determine if any action should be taken against Ige .at this time.\n\nParents, teachers support\n\nAG’s efforts\n\nBy Stan Constantino\n\nStar-Bulletin Beadie Kanahele Dawson, attorney for Na Pua e Ke Ali’i Pauahi, a 3,000-member group of Kamehameha Schools parents, teachers and alumni, has urged members to continue backing the attorney general’s effort to remove Bishop Estate trustees. Dawson said she wants everyone present at court Oct. 2, when the court will “either accept or reject” the estate’s court-appointed master Colbert Matsumoto’s report. She also urged members to be present Oct. 23 when the court takes Attorney General Margery Bronster’s recommendation to permanently remove Bishop Estate trustees Henry Peters, Richard Wong and Lokelani Lindsey. “Let the world know that you care,” Dawson said. “I think it’s our intent to take the trustees to court to defend our stand that we are the direct beneficiaries,” said Julie Nurre, former assistant treasurer for the organization. “That’s why we want to get more members.” In front of about 70 members last night, Dawson urged the collection of 1,700 signatures from Kamehameha Schools students, 3,000 signatures of parents, 9,000 signatures of alumni and 9,000 signatures of friends to help fight the Bishop Estate trustees in court. Dawson, who has been working for free as legal adviser for the organization, said it is important to raise money to pay for legal costs. “No one would have ever thought that we would have gotten this far,” Nurre said yesterday. “People kept saying there’s no way (the trustees) will ever be asked to be removed and yet today we’re standing here and the attorney general asked for their removal. I think we’ve accomplished a lot.” Kamehameha Schools alumni echoed Nurre’s sentiments. Liane Ulumealani Stewart, a 1952 Kamehameha Schools graduate, said she recently joined the organization because “now is the time to stand up and be counted against the Kamehameha Schools trustees. This is ho’oponopono.” “If the trustees are mismanaging the funds, they should be removed, they should have people in there that are of character, that are of moral fiber,” said Nathan Kilbey, a 1968 Kamehameha Schools graduate. “We want resolution and accountability.”\n\nBishop Estate Archive\n\nhttp://archives.starbulletin.com/98/09/11/news/story1.html\n\nSaturday, November 28, 1998\n\nBy George F.Lee, Star-Bulletin\n\nBishop Estate trustee Henry Peters, accompanied by\n\nattorney Renee Yuen, appeared in District Court yesterday\n\nafter being indicted for theft. Yuen, left, said her client will\n\nplead not guilty, and called grand jury proceedings “one-\n\nsided.” Two others indicted also went to the downtown\n\ncourthouse to be booked. Estate trustee Peters is booked, posts bail\n\nBishop Estate trustee Henry Peters surrendered to authorities two days after an Oahu grand jury indicted him on a theft charge. The 57-year-old Peters, the first trustee to face a criminal indictment in the estate’s 114-year history, appeared yesterday afternoon at District Court downtown where he was booked and fingerprinted, and then he posted $5,000 bail. Arraignment was set for Dec. 3. Peters, accompanied by his attorney, Renee Yuen, had no comment yesterday as he left the court building. Yuen said her client will plead not guilty to the theft charge. On Wednesday, the 16-member grand jury indicted Peters, a former speaker of the state House of Representatives, on one count of first-degree theft in connection with a Hawaii Kai land deal between the estate and a brother-in-law of Bishop Estate trustee Richard Wong, Jeffrey Stone. The indictment said that in 1995, Peters helped a company affiliated with Stone, One Keahole Partners, acquire the fee interest beneath the 229-unit Kalele Kai complex in Hawaii Kai. In return, Stone, through a company controlled by a business associate, Leighton Mau, bought Peters’ Makiki condo at an inflated price. If found guilty, Peters faces up to 10 years in prison. Yuen has denied wrongdoing by her client and questioned the grand jury proceedings, which she has described as “one-sided.” She believes the evidence will show that her client is not guilty of a crime. Yuen also said that Attorney General Margery Bronster, whose 15-month investigation of the estate prompted the grand jury investigation, has a conflict of interest in serving as prosecutor and as parens patriae, or legal guardian, of the estate. Besides Peters, the grand jury Wednesday indicted Stone and Mau for criminal conspiracy and for serving as accomplices to theft. The grand jury indicted Stone on additional charges of commercial bribery and perjury. Yesterday, Stone and Mau also appeared at District Court for booking and fingerprinting. Stone, joined by his wife, Lorrie, and his attorney, John Edmunds, posted bail of $12,000. Mau posted $10,000 bail. Stone had no comment, but Edmunds said his client plans to plead not guilty. Stone’s arraignment also is set for Dec. 3. News of Peters’ indictment prompted critics of the Bishop Estate trustees to renew calls for the removal of trustees. Beadie Kanahele Dawson, attorney for the 3,500-member parent and alumni group Na Pua a Ke Ali’i Pauahi, said Peters’ indictment harms the estate and she called it a “scar” on the estate-run Kamehameha Schools. She believes that Bronster will step up removal proceedings against Peters now that he faces a criminal trial. “It is not a conviction, but it’s a clear indication that everybody should take a serious look at this,” Dawson said. “You can’t leave a trustee in place while we make our way through a criminal indictment.”\n\nBishop Estate Archive\n\nhttp://archives.starbulletin.com/98/11/28/news/story1.html\n\nTuesday, April 13, 1999\n\nThe Bishop Estate trustee\n\nwas indicted by a grand\n\njury yesterday\n\nKalele Kai condo deal at\n\ncenter of controversy\n\nBy Rick Daysog\n\nStar-Bulletin An Oahu grand jury has indicted Bishop Estate chairman Richard “Dickie” Wong for allegedly taking a $115,800 kickback, making him the second board member in the history of the 114-year-old trust to face criminal charges relating to his duties as a trustee. In the latest legal scandal to rock the multibillion-dollar charitable organization, the secret panel yesterday indicted the 65-year-old Wong, a former state Senate president, for first-degree theft, perjury and conspiracy over his alleged role in a scheme involving a 1995 Bishop Estate land deal in Hawaii Kai. The grand jury — convened in January by Attorney General Margery Bronster — also voted to indict Wong’s wife, Mari, for criminal conspiracy and for hindering prosecution. Wong’s brother-in-law, local developer Jeffrey Stone, was charged with commercial bribery, criminal conspiracy and serving as an accomplice to theft.\n\nBy George F. Lee, Star-Bulletin\n\nBishop Estate Trustee Dickie Wong fled from the waiting\n\nmedia at Circuit Court on Friday afternoon\n\nfollowing his testimony.\n\n“Richard Sung Hong Wong violated his fiduciary duty to the Bishop Estate by accepting a bonus or commission for himself … for acts he had done as a trustee for the Bishop Estate in connection with the administration of the Bishop Estate,” the indictment said. Wong yesterday said he was disappointed but predicted that he would prevail in court. His attorneys believe the charges are politically motivated. Wong, a Bishop Estate trustee since 1993, is expected to surrender as early as today to authorities at District Court downtown, where he will be booked and fingerprinted. Wong’s bail has been set at $5,000, while Mari Wong’s bail was set at $2,000. Stone’s bail was set at $3,000. If convicted, each faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison in addition to fines of up to $50,000. Wong’s indictment comes at a time when many critics of the Bishop Estate are calling for board members to step down, saying their legal woes are crippling their ability to govern the estate and the trust-run Kamehameha Schools. In November, a separate Oahu grand jury indicted trustee Henry Peters for first-degree theft over the same alleged kickback scheme, while trustee Lokelani Lindsey is the target of a soon-to-be decided removal suit by trustees Oswald Stender and Gerard Jervis over allegations of mismanagement and unfitness. Peters has pleaded not guilty. Jervis, meanwhile, is recovering at his Kailua home under a doctor’s care after taking an overdose of sleeping pills last month. Jervis’ apparent suicide attempt came after he and an estate employee, attorney Rene Ojiri Kitaoka, were caught in a compromising position in a Waikiki hotel restroom. Kitaoka committed suicide the day after the hotel incident. Founded in December 1884, the Bishop Estate is one of the nation’s wealthiest charitable organizations, set up to educate children of native Hawaiian ancestry. The estate operates and finances the Kamehameha Schools. Yesterday’s nine-page indictment charged that Wong received a $115,800 kickback from his brother-in-law Stone through a series of complicated real estate transactions. According to the grand jury, Stone paid an inflated price for the Wongs’ second-floor condominium in the upscale 1015 Wilder apartment complex in Makiki on May 17, 1996. That same day, the Wongs bought a $1.1 million Kahala home from Stone, using the proceeds from the sale of their condo as partial payment. In return, Stone received a “sweetheart deal” when he and his mainland partner, National Housing Corp., acquired the estate’s fee interest to the 219-unit Kalele Kai luxury condominium complex for $21.9 million in Nov. 1995, the state has alleged. Wong, according to the grand jury, secretly met with Stone prior to the Kalele Kai transaction to mediate some of the aspects of the deal. The indictment further alleged that the Wongs provided incomplete testimony in sworn interviews with the attorney general’s office in November 1998. The charges against Wong and his family are a result of Bronster’s 19-month investigation into alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and mismanagement by the estate’s $840,000-a-year trustees. In September, Bronster sued for the permanent and interim removal of at least four trustees, saying they engaged in a pattern of self-dealing and mismanagement. Senior Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Goya said that with the latest indictments the state has completed its investigation of the Kalele Kai transactions. But he did not rule out further criminal charges relating to other aspects of the state’s investigation. The state recently subpoenaed the campaign records of Sen. Marshall Ige, former state Sen. Milton Holt and various estate vendors who contributed to their campaigns. In its September removal petition, the state alleged that several trust vendors, at the request of Bishop Estate employees, helped launder Holt and Ige’s campaign expenses. Sources say the state also has subpoenaed the election records of other state legislators. Meanwhile, Eric Seitz, Wong’s attorney — said Wong recused himself from all aspects of the Kalele Kai negotiations, which were finalized by trustees Lindsey, Jervis and Peters. Seitz — who attempted unsuccessfully last week to postpone the grand jury proceedings against Wong — denied that Stone received a “sweetheart” deal, arguing that the lease-to-fee conversion was of enormous benefit to the estate. The $21.9 million price paid by Stone and his partners is almost 2-1/2 times the value that an independent appraiser placed on the Kalele Kai property in 1995, said Seitz, who noted that the project had been stalled under the original developer, Peter Bedford’s Kapalele Associates, of California. “This is the most disgraceful indictment I’ve ever seen or heard of,” said Seitz. “They don’t have a case. I rarely predict a victory, but in this case it’s a slam dunk.” Seitz believes that much of the state’s evidence against Wong comes from testimony by local attorney Richard Frunzi, who once served as vice president in Stone’s now-defunct company, Honolulu International Telecommunications Inc. Frunzi allegedly told the grand jury that Stone expected Wong to receive “some payoff” as a result of the Kalele Kai transaction, Seitz said. Wong was asked by the grand jury about Frunzi’s remarks and called the allegation a lie, said Seitz. Frunzi, who was sentenced by a federal judge to five years in prison last February for laundering drug money, is telling his story to help shorten his own jail time, Seitz said. “Whatever Mr. Frunzi told them, I’m more than happy to have him repeat it in front of a jury because at that time he’ll be in prison, he’ll be disbarred. He’s a scumbag,” Seitz said. “He’s a crook and a criminal and a disgrace to the bar and a liar.” Members of the Stone family, meanwhile, say they feel intimidated by the attorney general’s latest legal assault. Wong’s mother-in-law, the Rev. Beverly Bates, who testified before the grand jury on Thursday, said her daughter, Mari Wong, and her daughter-in-law and Jeff Stone’s wife, Lorrie Stone, are in “deep depression” over the ordeal. Bates believes that the attorney general is unfairly attacking members of Wong’s family to get him to resign. “I know my family never did this. This is unconscionable that Margery Bronster can so abuse her power and take Richard’s family hostage,” Bates said. “Our lives are ruined.” Ironically, Wong — a former state Senate president for 13 years — and his attorneys believe that he is a victim of a game he once mastered: politics. Ronald Malone, a mainland attorney for Wong, argued that Bronster is attempting to use the indictment to unfairly influence a separate civil suit by her office to remove Wong temporarily and permanently as a Bishop Estate trustee. The interim removal suit — which alleged that Wong, Peters, Lindsey and Jervis jeopardized the estate’s tax-exempt status, mismanaged Kamehameha Schools and withheld some $350 million of trust income from Kamehameha Schools — is now in the third week of a scheduled five-week trial. “This is totally political,” Malone said.\n\nAt a glance\n\nRichard “Dickie” Wong\n\nTitle: Chairman of the board of trustees, Bishop Estate\n\nAge: 65\n\nAppointed to board: 1993\n\nTerm ends: 2003\n\nOutside positions: Realtor\n\nExperience: Former state Senate president, assistant division director, United Public Workers union\n\nBishop Estate Archive\n\nWednesday, April 14, 1999\n\nBy Craig T. Kojima, Star-Bulletin\n\nPeters, charges stand out in lengthy\n\nBishop Estate investigation\n\nBy Rick Daysog\n\nStar-Bulletin\n\nalumni of the Kamehameha Schools debated the temporary removal of Bishop Estate trustees, Henry Haalilio Peters unexpectedly strolled into the well-attended conference room. The atmosphere of the November 1997 meeting became tense. Graduates nervously eyed the trustee as he entered hostile territory. Hands that were previously 2 feet in the air were going up inches. To say that the burly, 6-foot-tall Peters is an imposing presence in the Bishop Estate boardroom would be an understatement. The 58-year-old former speaker of the state House of Representatives is the longest current serving trustee — joining the five-person board in 1984 while still speaker — and arguably the most powerful. While trustee Richard “Dickie” Wong may be chairman, Peters, as treasurer and former acting asset manager, is the prime mover behind a financial empire that spans three continents and holds big stakes in names like Goldman Sachs Group and Saks Fifth Avenue. Supporters see Peters as a larger-than-life folk hero who rose from a humble upbringing on the Waianae Coast to become House speaker and an $840,000-a-year trustee of one of the nation’s richest charitable organizations. They say he’s remained down to earth, even as he rubs elbows with Wall Street investment bankers, Asian tycoons and U.S. Treasury secretaries. Critics view him as a symbol of what’s wrong with the Bishop Estate. Lawyers for trustee Oswald Stender regard Peters as key to the boardroom triumvirate that for years has ruled the estate and the estate-run Kamehameha Schools through a “fist of power.” Along with trustees Wong and Lokelani Lindsey, Peters has called for an investigation of teachers at the estate-run Kamehameha Schools over the release of a report critical of the trustees. Peters — who once broke his knuckles during an argument with a state lawmaker — also has taken a hard line against critics within the Hawaiian community, calling them “Hawaiian shields” and “disgruntled and sophisticated country club Hawaiians.”\n\nHe became so angry at Kamehameha Schools graduates who took part in the May 1997 march protesting trustees’ management of the campus that he took down names of participants, implying future retaliation, according to court testimony of the estate’s former spokeswoman. Peters denied the charge. Peters often toys with his notoriety. He joked that his grandson asked him if the Bishop Estate was an evil empire and if Peters was Darth Vader. His wisecrack response played on the theme of the popular “Star Wars” movies in which the menacing Vader redeemed himself in the end: “I’m Luke’s father,” Peters said.\n\nCases against Henry Peters\n\nLike Darth Vader, Peters is a villain, so cast by state prosecutors in the 2-year-old Bishop Estate saga. Attorney General Margery Bronster has accused Peters and fellow trustees of an “educational tragedy” that has denied benefits to a generation of native Hawaiian children. Bronster has sued for the removal of Peters and trustees Wong, Lindsey and Gerard Jervis, alleging that the trustees jeopardized the estate’s tax-exempt status and withheld $350 million in trust income from the Kamehameha Schools. The temporary removal suit against Peters and Wong, now in trial before Probate Judge Colleen Hirai, is just one of several legal actions against Peters. Last November, an Oahu grand jury convened by Bronster indicted Peters for theft, making him the first board member to face criminal charges in the 114-year history of the charitable organization. The indictment alleged that Peters took a $192,500 kickback from developer Jeff Stone, a brother-in-law of trustee Wong. In exchange, Stone and his mainland partner, National Housing Corp., received a “sweetheart deal” when they purchased the estate’s fee interest to the Kalele Kai condominium project in Hawaii Kai in 1995, the state charged.\n\nCalls for resignation\n\nCritics say that Peters’ legal woes not only tarnish the legacy of the estate’s founder, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, but also interfere with his daily duties at the trust. They are calling for him to voluntarily resign, noting that he recently stepped down temporarily from the board of a Southern California savings and loan, PBOC Holdings Inc. “It certainly doesn’t look good to the outside world that one of the trustees has been indicted for a crime directly related to the performance of his fiduciary duties,” said Randall Roth, University of Hawaii law professor and co-author of the 1997 “Broken Trust” article critical of trustees’ management of the Bishop Estate. “He’s innocent until proven guilty, but in the meantime it’s hard to have a lot of confidence in him as a trustee.” Peters has pleaded not guilty and has refused to step down. He believes that Bronster trumped up the criminal charge to leverage her removal case against him. Peters – who failed to get his indictment thrown out on jurisdictional grounds – said Kalele Kai has been a great deal for the estate and that Stone and his partners got no “sweetheart” transaction. The $21.9 million price for the fee interest in Kalele Kai is almost 2-1/2 times that of an independently appraised value for the land and will serve as a benchmark for future leasehold conversions in East Honolulu, he said. The trial is set for January 2000. (A separate grand jury on Monday indicted trustee Wong for theft, conspiracy and perjury in the same alleged kickback scheme. Wong expects to plead not guilty.) “We are guilty of being successful,” Peters said.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\nIn a recent interview, Peters characterized his legal woes as a Machiavellian setup. He believes that former rival Gov. Ben Cayetano used the Bishop Estate controversy to bolster his position in the close re-election fight with Republican Linda Lingle last November. The idea was to make the estate a scapegoat to divert attention from the state’s fiscal woes, Peters said. Many of the estate’s Hawaiian critics, he added, were enlisted to serve as “Hawaiian shields” in the Cayetano administration’s campaign against the trust. “They did a number on us,” Peters said. Peters’ recent court filings accused Attorney General Bronster of abusing her powers and intimidating the state Supreme Court. Last year, the high court ended its century-old practice of selecting Bishop trustees and has recused itself from several estate-related cases. He refers to Bronster as a “New York, Ivy League newcomer” who has embarked on a “personal crusade” against the Bishop Estate and its trustees because they don’t share her “corporate missionary mentality.” A spokeswoman for Bronster declined response.\n\n.\n\n“I personally feel that the majority of Hawaiians have not been told the truth,” Peters said. “When they find out that KSBE has been maligned by these untruths about our operations and our management, there will be an explosion in this town. It will be heard across the country and probably the world.”Peters conceded that his legal woes have taken a toll on him and his family. But Peters said he doesn’t let the controversy affect his daily life.He joked that he recently was stopped for speeding on the highway near Makakilo, but the officer didn’t issue him a ticket after he recognized Peters. The officer told him he didn’t need a ticket because he had enough troubles as it is, Peters said.”This is not the first time that Henry Peters was involved in controversy and it probably won’t be the last,” he said.\n\nHumble upbringing\n\nPeters was raised on the Waianae Coast in a close-knit family steeped in Hawaiian tradition. His mother, Hoaliku Drake, headed the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands under Gov. John Waihee.Peters’ great-grandfather, James Hakuole, was sent to Japan as a member of King Kalakaua’s Hawaiian Youths Abroad program. Hakuole studied with members of the Japanese imperial family.After graduating from Waipahu High School, Peters studied for two years to become a priest at the now-defunct Jackson College in Manoa before transferring to Brigham Young University, where he graduated with a degree in business administration.While at BYU, Peters was a standout volleyball player, later playing against the likes of Olympic volleyball legend Pete Velasco and former Olympian Jon Stanley. Peters also had a tryout with the Pan American Games volleyball team but was left off the squad after he broke his ankle while playing basketball.After a tour in the Army National Guard in the late 1960s, Peters became Waianae community advocate for the Model Cities program, a Nixon-era initiative to boost economic development in the inner cities. Waihee also worked on the staff of Model Cities, recalled local historian Bob Dye, who was former Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi’s liaison for Model Cities.”Both Waihee and Peters were on parallel paths,” said Dye. “I was personally surprised that Henry didn’t end up as governor. That’s always where I thought he was headed.”\n\nRose through the ranks\n\nPeters was elected to the state House from Waianae in 1974 in a freshman class that included Cayetano, current state Senate President Norman Mizuguchi and U.S. Rep. Neil Abercrombie. He gained the confidence of then-Speaker James Wakatsuki, who guided Peters through the ranks to become speaker in 1980.In 1984, Peters was named to the Bishop Estate board. Then-Chief Justice William Richardson said he believed Peters would become one of the best trustees ever.Former Associate Supreme Court Justice Frank Padgett recalled that the selection of Peters was unanimous. While he may not have had the financial background back then, the justices believed that Peters would grow into the job and would benefit from the expertise of board member and legendary financier Matsuo Takabuki, Padgett said.Padgett declined to comment on the current controversy, but said he had fond memories of Peters. When Padgett’s wife suffered a stroke about a decade ago, Peters sent her two dozen roses.”Henry is a very personable and a very caring guy,” Padgett said.Several credit lawmaker Peters with playing a key early role on ceded lands. Kamaki Kanahele, former Office of Hawaiian Affairs trustee and Peters’ cousin, said Peters helped pass legislation in the early 1980s that would later serve as the basis for the state’s sharing of revenues from its use of former crown lands.”It was a historical decision because it was the difference between Hawaiians getting something or Hawaiians getting nothing,” Kanahele said.Larry Meacham, executive director of Common Cause/Hawaii, has a different perspective. Common Cause, a citizen watchdog group, often complained about Peters’ dual role as a lawmaker and as a trustee of the state’s largest private landowner, Meacham said.\n\nPersuasive presence\n\nWhile Peters may not have openly voted on issues that affected the trust, such as legislation involving trustees’ compensation and the leasehold conversion, Meacham said he had an influence on the direction of the legislation.”That’s one of the reasons the management of the Bishop Estate has escaped scrutiny for many years,” Meacham said.Peters had an image as a brooding and intimidating person during his political career, earning the nickname of the House bouncer.In one often-recounted tale, Peters broke his knuckles during a 1979 dispute over organizational issues with a fellow lawmaker, former state Rep. Mits Uechi.Peters, then House majority leader, confronted dissident legislator Uechi and banged his hand on Uechi’s office furniture, according to news reports.Later that same day, Peters got into a shouting match with then-Rep. Oliver Lunasco, also a member of the dissident group. Peters called the incident unfortunate and said he doesn’t intend to come across as intimidating.”When he gives you a handshake, he means it 100 percent,” Kanahele said. “But if you reneged on one, oh boy, you have an enemy.”\n\n‘Schoolyard bully’\n\nThe toughness that Peters developed in the athletic and political arenas is also present in his business dealings.Larry Landry, former chief financial officer for the $4 billion John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which is a co-investor with the estate in a Boston-based investment fund and a Florida apartment complex, describes Peters as a savvy and thorough investment manager.Deal promoters often approach large foundations and charitable trusts thinking they have deep pockets. But Peters brings a healthy skepticism to anyone who brings an investment to the estate, according to Landry.”Henry is extremely bright and has the right kind of conservative (investment) philosophy,” said Landry, who now serves as chief executive officer of Florida-based Westport Realty Advisers. “He’s good at making sure that whoever they’re dealing with have their skins in the game.”Some businessmen have complained that Peters can be heavy-handed. For instance, when a group led by Tokyo General Corp. acquired the Kahala Mandarin Hotel in 1993, Peters refused to give the partners a break on the annual lease rent even after the partners decided to invest at least $30 million in hotel improvements and agreed to pay the estate’s $1 million litigation costs.Those involved say Peters often overruled previous negotiations by then-asset manager Tony Sereno.\n\nPeters plays hardball\n\nPeters is just as tough in the boardroom, according to sources. Peters once got into a shouting match with trustee Jervis over the estate’s legal strategy. The confrontation ended after Peters reportedly uttered an ethnic slur disparaging Jervis’ Portuguese background, sources familiar with the event said.Peters said he did not recall the incident.Supporters concede that Peters can be harsh but say that just shows he’s taking his fiduciary duties seriously.”He wants to make sure that never, never again will the Hawaiian people be ripped off,” said Kanahele.To be sure, there are questions about his skills as an investment manager.In his review of the estate’s 1994-1996 accounts, court-appointed master Colbert Matsumoto and the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen said the estate — during Peters’ tenure as acting asset manager — generated an embarrassing return on investment of minus 1 percent. During that period, the trust set aside more than $240 million in reserves for future losses.That woeful performance came as Wall Street was in the midst of a record bull run in which investors could have made double-digit returns just by putting their money in an index fund.Matsumoto’s findings have served as a major foundation for the attorney general’s removal petitions against the trustees.Peters takes strong exception to the master’s report, saying Matsumoto failed to understand the complexity of the estate’s finances. Peters also suggests ulterior motives on the master’s part.\n\nContrasting outlook\n\nPeters believes that the estate’s investments are extremely healthy and cited top credit ratings by Standard & Poors and Moody’s Investors Service. He also pointed to the estate’s successful investment in Goldman Sachs Group, in which the estate has more than tripled its initial $500 million investment.The Bishop Estate — which until the late 1970s had been a land-rich, cash-poor trust that could barely meet school expenses — has seen its investments grow at a compound, annual rate of 17.3 percent since the late 1980s, he added.If the estate followed many of Matsumoto’s and Arthur Andersen’s recommendations, it would have suffered huge losses during the Black Tuesday stock market crash of October 1987 as well as the recent Russian and Asian economic crises, he said.”This mastering process has become so political that it’s an embarrassment to the Judiciary. … It should be an embarrassment to the C.J. (state Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald Moon) and it should be an embarrassment to the people of Hawaii,” Peters said.Last year, Peters joined with Wong and Lindsey to seek Matsumoto’s removal as master and to invalidate his findings. They believe that he is a political crony of Cayetano’s who is doing the governor’s bidding.Probate Judge Hirai in January rejected Peters’ motion to remove Matsumoto after the master’s attorney, James Duffy, likened Peters, Wong and Lindsey to “schoolyard bullies” who were attacking the master not because the report was inaccurate but because the findings were critical of them.Peters now believes that he probably should have worked closer with Matsumoto and critics within the Kamehameha ohana about their concerns on the management of the estate and the Kamehameha Schools.”I’m disappointed it’s gotten this far. In hindsight, could we have done something differently or better?” Peters said last week. “Would it have helped? I’m not sure. It could have. I’m a great Monday quarterback.”\n\nPeters, charges stand out in lengthy\n\nBishop Estate investigation\n\nBy Rick Daysog\n\nStar-Bulletin The state’s exhaustive investigation into the Bishop Estate appears to focus on trustee Henry Peters as a central figure in the two-year controversy that’s rocked the multibillion-dollar charitable trust. In a September Probate Court petition to permanently remove several trustees, Attorney General Margery Bronster alleged that Peters took part in repeated acts of self-dealing and mismanagement. The state’s charges include: Between 1993 and 1998, Peters received options to acquire 6,000 shares of stock as well as substantial director’s fees from a Bermuda-based insurance company, Mid Ocean Ltd. The estate was a big investor in Mid Ocean. Peters has since declined to exercise the stock options, which would have been worth more than $400,000 under Mid Ocean’s 1998 merger with competitor Exel Ltd. Peters directed trust managers and the estate’s former Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center subsidiary to hire his friends and relatives for unbudgeted positions and outside consulting work, according to the state. The employees included former state Rep. Terrance Tom, local attorney Albert Jeremiah and Office of Hawaiian Affairs trustee and former state Sen. Clayton Hee. Starting in 1995, a company headed by Peters’ nephew received more than $1.3 million in nonbid and subcontracting work from the estate. The company, Rhino Roofing, conducted renovation work on Peters’ Maili home. Since 1995, Peters’ former employer, Dura Constructors Inc., received more than $2.7 million in nonbid work from the estate. In one case, Dura billed the estate $465,000 to build an athletic locker room at Kamehameha Schools that was later deemed unsafe for student use. The trust wound up correcting the building deficiencies itself and did not pursue Dura for the faulty work. Dura also conducted work on Peters’ Maili home. Along with his fellow trustees, Peters received compensation well above that of comparable organizations. In 1997, each trustee earned about $840,000 in commissions. Peters and fellow trustees also spent more than $900,000 of trust money to lobby Congress against the passage of federal legislation limiting salaries for board members of charitable trusts. Peters has defended himself from charges of conflicts of interest and cronyism, saying that family members or friends that work at the estate were hired because they are qualified and not because they are related to him. He and other trustees say their compensation is performance-based and have argued that they have waived millions in dollars in commissions that they were legally entitled to. The estate, Peters added, benefited from his sitting on outside boards in which the estate held big stakes. He noted that two of those companies, Mid Ocean Ltd. and PBOC, have generated millions of dollars for the estate. “We’re the wealthiest we’ve ever been in our history and we are far more liquid than we ever have been in our history,” he said.\n\nWednesday, April 28, 1999\n\nMany see vote as political\n\nIRS to Bishop trustees: Resign\n\nBudget director ousted\n\nBy Craig Gima\n\nStar-Bulletin The state Senate today rejected Margery Bronster’s nomination to a second term as the state’s attorney general in a 14-to-11 vote. Bronster and supporters and opponents watched in a packed Senate gallery as the vote was taken after about 2-1/2 hours of debate. The vote on Bronster had been too close to call, with a large number of undecided senators and other senators who switched sides in the hours leading up to the vote. “In 1999, the confirmation of Margery Bronster will define this Senate,” said Sen. Randy Iwase (D, Mililani), who said he received more calls and letters on this issue than any other. “Ms. Bronster has been a solid and often stellar attorney general,” said Sen. Matt Matsunaga (D, Palolo). He said Bronster is not perfect, but has “been fearless when it comes to advocacy for the people of Hawaii.” Sen. Jonathan Chun (D, Lihue) spoke in opposition to Bronster. “I need to be as comfortable as the governor with her legal advice and her character,” Chun said. However, he said concerns about her management style and delays in legal opinions and what he sees as advocacy within her opinions does not give him confidence in her. Bronster is expected to step down as attorney general. It was not clear if she would or could accept a position to continue on as a special counsel on the Bishop Estate investigation. Despite the setback, Gov. Ben Cayetano vowed earlier in the week that the vote would not end the investigation of the estate. “It’s going to continue because the ball has started to roll and we’re too far along the way,” Cayetano said on Monday. Cayetano today said Bronster has done a tremendous job as attorney general. The debate over Bronster had overshadowed much of what was happening in the Legislature in the 12 days since her April 16 confirmation hearing. The nomination was held as Senate Judiciary Co-Chairmen Matt Matsunaga (D, Palolo) and Avery Chumbley (D, Kihei) tried to gather the necessary votes to confirm Bronster, and it was finally brought to the floor today. Bronster and Cayetano made personal visits to senators, but that apparently did not sway many undecideds. While the concerns expressed by some senators over Bronster’s management ability may have been sincere, the fight over her nomination was also about controversy and politics over the Bishop Estate and an internal reorganization struggle in the Senate. At one point last week, the governor urged that state Sen. Marshall Ige (D, Kaneohe) recuse himself from the vote because he has been named in the Bishop Estate investigation. The attorney general alleged that the estate paid an $18,261 campaign debt for Ige in a bogus billing scheme. However, even if Ige had recused himself, Bronster would still have fallen short of the majority she needed for confirmation.\n\nThe Vote on Bronster\n\nYes (11):\n\nRobert Bunda (D, Wahiawa, North Shore)\n\nAvery B.

Despite Dawson’s warning, the attorney general’s battle with the estate is just one of many subplots in a political drama in the Senate. The vote is being viewed as a prelude to a leadership fight and appears to have altered relationships among senators, between the Senate and the governor, and between the governor and the state’s largest government worker union. “If the vote comes out fractionalized as it appears to be, no, I do not believe the Senate will be the same,” said Sen. Colleen Hanabusa (D, Waianae). “I believe it (the vote) will draw lines for people.” Judiciary Co-Chairmen Matt Matsunaga (D, Palolo) and Avery Chumbley (D, Kihei) agreed. “The organization of the Senate is always fragile,” Matsunaga said. The Judiciary Committee recommended Bronster be confirmed, but breaking with a long-standing practice, Senate President Norman Mizuguchi (D, Aiea) refused to say yesterday if he would support his Judiciary chairmen. “I told the full Senate that you vote your conscience and you’re going to live with that vote in political life,” Mizuguchi said. He denied that the vote in the Senate is being influenced by internal strife.\n\nBy Kathyrn Bender, Star-Bulletin\n\nA crowd turned out at the Capitol yesterday to\n\nshow support for the confirmation of Margery\n\nBronster as attorney general. Today the Senate\n\nrejected Bronster, 14-11\n\n“It’s not about Senate organization,” he said. “I have great respect for the committee chairs.”\n\nMizuguchi said the issue over Bronster’s nomination is about concerns senators have over her management style and other issues. He cited the lack of support for teachers involved in the Felix consent decree, delays in making legal decisions, the attorney general’s opinion on the constitutional convention and a proposal to exempt the state hospital from the privatization law. But Gov. Ben Cayetano said internal politics is playing a role in the fight over Bronster and his budget director, Earl Anzai. “I think there are people in positions of leadership right now who are worried about losing their positions and want to make deals with other factions so they can save their necks,” Cayetano said yesterday. Cayetano also said Mizuguchi’s decision on Bronster was influenced by the Hawaii Government Employees Association. “I think the HGEA is very influential with Sen. Mizuguchi,” Cayetano said. “If he switches, then it will be unfortunate. Perhaps it’s a sign of the leadership they have in the Senate.” The HGEA is officially neutral on Bronster’s confirmation, and a union official last week denied that there was any effort to derail Bronster’s nomination. But Cayetano said he “knew for a fact” that the union was actively lobbying against her. Cayetano implied that other forces were behind the union’s anti-Bronster effort. “I think that those of us who know Hawaii know that there are pressures and interests that go far beyond the ranks of labor. People in this state — everyone knows each other, and that influences people,” he said. Beyond what the vote may mean internally, senators are also conscious of how it will play with voters. “I know I’m taking a risk on this,” said Sen. Jonathan Chun (D, Lihue), who held a press conference yesterday to explain in detail his decision to vote against Bronster. He insisted that his decision has nothing to do with the Bishop Estate controversy. “I know there are people out there who find her very popular, but I’m not going to make a decision based on popularity,” Chun said. Chun said he was voting against Bronster because of delays by the attorney general’s office in issuing legal opinions for departments, and said Bronster tries to influence policy decisions through her office’s opinions. He added that the attention on Bronster’s nomination has diverted attention from the budget, ceded lands settlement and other issues that still need to be worked on before the scheduled close of the session next week. Sen. Norman Sakamoto (D, Moanalua) said nominations should have been voted on earlier so the Legislature could focus on passing bills in the last week of the session. “Now the session is the Bronster session,” Sakamoto said.\n\nBudget director ousted\n\nIRS to Bishop trustees: Resign\n\nBishop Estate archive\n\nLilly sees a parallel in AG fight\n\nThe Senate battle over Bronster’s\n\nposition recalls his 1985 rejection\n\nBy Craig Gima\n\nStar-Bulletin The last time the Senate rejected an attorney general nominee was in 1985, when the Judiciary Committee refused to send Gov. George Ariyoshi’s nomination of Michael Lilly to the Senate floor. Lilly, now an attorney in private practice, sees parallels between his experience and the Margery Bronster nomination fight. “I think it’s obviously a political process,” Lilly said.He said he was caught in the middle of a battle between the Legislature and the governor and believes Bronster is a victim of that as well. “I think that’s exactly what’s happened to Bronster . . . that the governor and the Legislature are at odds with one another. The governor has taken such tough choices and made decisions that the Legislature doesn’t agree with,” he said. Lilly believes Bronster is doing a good job and should be confirmed but sees the irony in her situation, because one of the senators who led the effort to reject Lilly was then-dissident Ben Cayetano.”They say what goes around comes around.” “Ah, history comes back again,” Cayetano said when asked about Lilly’s nomination. However, he said the situation in 1985 and Bronster’s current troubles are different. “In that particular case the attorney general had a conflict. The nominee had a conflict and there were some serious questions about that particular conflict. In this particular case, there’s no conflict. There’s no question about the attorney general’s character, as was the issue the last time.” During Lilly’s confirmation fight, Cayetano and other critics raised several issues, including a charge that Lilly was present and condoned beatings during a shakedown at Oahu Community Correctional Center and that he was slow to investigate the collapse of Manoa Finance Co. Lilly said he was cleared of any wrongdoing in the prison shakedown and many of the other issues raised in the committee. He said he would have been confirmed had his nomination gone to the floor. After Lilly was rejected by the Judiciary Committee, Ariyoshi kept him on as attorney general until Lilly resigned a month after the Legislature adjourned to avoid a lengthy court battle over the confirmation. He said he is proud of what he accomplished during the short time he served as attorney general. He points to the establishment of the criminal justice unit in the office, which was headed by Keith Kaneshiro. “It’s ironic that the unit that I created 14 years ago is the unit that’s now prosecuting some of Bishop Estate trustees’ alleged crimes,” he said. Lilly said his rejection turned out to be a blessing. After leaving government service, he founded a successful law firm . He said he is very happy in private practice.\n\nLegislature Directory\n\nHawaii Revised Statutes\n\nLegislature Bills\n\nhttp://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/04/28/news/story1.html\n\nFriday, July 2, 1999\n\nBy Craig T. Kojima, Star-Bulletin\n\nHenry Peters meets with reporters after his case\n\nwas dismissed yesterday.\n\nJudge: Peters didn’t get fair hearing\n\nJudge Town dismisses\n\nindictments of Peters and\n\ntwo businessmen\n\nStender vs. Lindsey in court again\n\nBy Rick Daysog\n\nStar-Bulletin\n\nThe state attorney general’s criminal investigation of Bishop Estate trustees has suffered another setback as a state judge dismissed indictments against trustee Henry Peters. But the judge’s action does not rule out future criminal investigation of Peters.\n\nCircuit Judge Michael Town yesterday threw out grand jury indictments against Peters, local developer Jeffrey Stone and isle businessman Leighton Mau, saying they were denied a “fair and unbiased” grand jury.\n\nTown said prosecutors — who alleged Peters, Stone and Mau took part in a kickback scheme involving Bishop Estate land — improperly bolstered the testimony of Richard Frunzi, Stone’s former lawyer. Frunzi gave up his law license after he was convicted of federal money-laundering charges. “Frunzi’s testimony … denied these defendants a fair and unbiased grand jury and such conduct invaded the (jury’s) province,” Town said. “It certainly had a tendency to prejudice the grand jury.” On June 16, Town dismissed separate indictments against Stone, Stone’s brother-in-law trustee Richard “Dickie” Wong and Wong’s wife, Mari. As in his previous ruling, Town dismissed the Peters indictment without prejudice, meaning that state prosecutors could bring new criminal charges against the trustee before a new grand jury. Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Goya had no response when asked whether the state would seek new indictments. He said he’ll meet with acting Attorney General Rick Keller to discuss options. In its Nov. 25 indictment, the grand jury alleged that One Keahole Partners, a partnership between Stone and Cleveland-based National Housing Corp., received favorable treatment when it bought the estate’s fee interest to the Kalele Kai condominium project for $21.9 million in 1995. About the same time, Stone acquired Peters’ second-floor condo at the upscale 1015 Wilder complex indirectly for $192,500 more than it was worth, the indictment said. Peters then used the money from that sale to buy a 12th-floor penthouse unit in the same complex, according to the grand jury. “The crimes that have been charged are essentially theft crimes involving the Bishop Estate,” Goya said. Peters and Stone have denied wrongdoing, saying Stone and National Housing overpaid the estate in the Kalele Kai transaction. Both have said there is no connection between the Kalele Kai deal and Peters’ private transactions. Defense lawyers said the only link between Peters’ condos and the Kalele Kai deal was provided by Frunzi, who was improperly called before the grand jury. Stone’s attorney, John Edmunds, said Goya engaged in misconduct by not telling jurors that Frunzi had been convicted on money-laundering charges. Edmunds added that Frunzi improperly violated the attorney-client privilege that exists between him and Stone when he went before the grand jury without Stone’s knowledge or permission. Peters said the criminal investigation is based on “fraudulent charges” and is part of a political campaign orchestrated by former Attorney General Margery Bronster and the Cayetano administration to remove him as a trustee. Peters said he was disappointed that the case was not dismissed with prejudice, because it would allow the state to go back and continue its campaign against him. Peters compared the allegation that he took a kickback to the 1986 smear that derailed the gubernatorial campaign of former U.S. Rep. Cecil Heftel. “From day one, this has been a Cec Heftel-type smear to dethrone the duly appointed trustees of Kamehameha Schools and Bishop Estate and have this governor appoint his provisional governance,” he said. “It’s very disheartening to have a corrupt attorney general and governor besiege innocent people like this using millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money.” Peters said he hopes Town’s ruling could help him get reinstated as a Bishop Estate trustee. In a May 7 decision, Probate Judge Kevin Chang temporarily removed Peters, Wong, Gerard Jervis and Lokelani Lindsey from their $1 million-a-year posts and accepted the voluntary resignation of Oswald Stender after the Internal Revenue Service threatened to revoke the estate’s valuable tax-exempt status. Peters noted that Chang’s ruling came in the same week that the estate saw its $500 million investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. grow several-fold with the Wall Street investment banking firm’s initial public offering. “Isn’t it ironic that the very week in which we bring home $2 billion to the Bishop Estate is the week I lose my job? Any place else they would have given a parade for me. They would have given me bonuses. Here they indict you.” Stone and Edmunds said they would sue the state in federal court if the attorney general tried to seek a new indictment. Edmunds said the state has no case without Frunzi’s testimony. “I would like to see my family start to heal,” Stone said. “… I think it’s time for Hawaii to move on to a better subject.”\n\nStender vs. Lindsey in court again\n\nBy Rick Daysog\n\nStar-Bulletin Former Bishop Estate trustee Oswald Stender is opposing Lokelani Lindsey’s request to set aside a judge’s ruling to remove her as a $1 million-a-year trustee of the nonprofit, charitable trust. In court papers filed yesterday, Stender said Circuit Judge Bambi Weil, who ordered Lindsey’s dismissal May 6, demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Lindsey was unfit to serve as a trustee. Lindsey said Weil abused her discretion by not allowing her to testify in rebuttal to several witnesses who followed her after she took the stand in the middle of the trial. Lindsey asked the judge to allow her to remain in office while she appealed her removal to a higher court. Stender, whose motion was joined by the attorney general’s office and trustee Gerard Jervis, said Lindsey testified for eight days and had ample opportunity to address the allegations against her. Stender said restoring Lindsey would have a “devastating effect” and would “paralyze” the healing process under way at the Kamehameha Schools. In her findings of fact and conclusions of law, Weil said Lindsey misappropriated estate assets, micromanaged the estate-run Kamehameha Schools and created a climate of fear on the school’s Kapalama Heights campus. Stender, who recently was named acting executive director of the Hawaii Nature Center, added that Weil found 19 instances in which Lindsey’s trial testimony was not credible. “The truth is that the court showed extraordinary patience in letting Mrs. Lindsey testify and ‘tell her story’ literally as long as she wanted to,” said Stender’s attorney, Crystal Rose. No stay, “no matter how carefully crafted, could safeguard Kamehameha Schools from Mrs. Lindsey’s vindictiveness.”\n\nBishop Estate Archive\n\nSaturday, February 23, 2002\n\nCourt vindicates ex-trustees\n\nA ruling admonishes the state\n\nin favor of Henry Peters\n\nand Richard Wong\n\nBy Rick Daysog\n\nrdaysog@starbulletin.com Saying the state’s prosecution represented a “serious threat to the integrity of the judicial process,” the Hawaii Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of theft charges against former Kamehameha Schools trustees Henry Peters and Richard “Dickie” Wong.In a strongly worded 39-page ruling yesterday, the high court said the Attorney General’s Office denied Peters’ and Wong’s rights to due process by introducing tainted grand jury testimony.The state also acted improperly by halting testimony from a local developer that would have exonerated Peters and Wong’s former brother-in-law, local developer Jeffrey Stone, according to the ruling.”The state’s actions cannot but have improperly influenced the grand jury and prevented it from operating with fairness and impartiality,” the court said. “The state’s interest in prosecuting these cases is, at this point, clearly outweighed by the lack of fundamental fairness that would ensue were we to allow these prosecutions to continue.”Eric Seitz, Wong’s attorney, called the ruling a “ringing denunciation” of the Attorney General’s Office.”I’ve won a number of prosecutorial misconduct cases in my day, but I haven’t seen one as strong as this,” Seitz said.Senior Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Goya said he was disappointed by the ruling and did not agree with the court’s reasoning. He declined to discuss specifics.Both Peters and Wong were indicted in 1998 by Oahu grand juries over their alleged roles in the Kamehameha Schools’ sale of its fee interest in the Kalele Kai condominium complex in Hawaii Kai to a Stone-led company.The indictments alleged that Peters and Wong received kickbacks in exchange for favorable treatment on Kalele Kai. Stone was indicted by the same grand juries on commercial bribery charges.All three have denied wrongdoing, saying the Kamehameha Schools, then known as Bishop Estate, earned millions when it sold the fee interest to Kalele Kai.Yesterday’s ruling upholds Circuit Judge Michael Town’s dismissals of indictments against Peters, Wong and Stone. Town found that the state violated Stone’s right to attorney-client privilege when it allowed Stone’s former attorney, Richard Frunzi, to speak to the grand jury about matters involving his former client.At the time, Frunzi was serving time in a federal jail after pleading guilty to money laundering.Town also dismissed the theft charges against Peters after the state introduced improper testimony from the estate’s former general counsel, Nathan Aipa.In 1999, Peters, Wong, Gerard Jervis, Oswald Stender and Lokelani Lindsey resigned from their $1 million-a-year jobs as Kamehameha Schools trustees after the Internal Revenue Servicethreatened to revoke the $6 billion charitable trust’s tax-exempt status.Yesterday’s ruling was made by Circuit Judges George Masuoka, Ronald Ibarra, Dan Kochi, Shackley Raffetto and Gary Chang. The judges were serving as substitutes for the five Supreme Court justices, who recused themselves from all cases involving the Kamehameha Schools. Until recently, the high court selected the trustees of the Kamehameha Schools.\n\nhttp://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/02/23/news/story1.html\n\nRelated References:\n\n~ o ~"
