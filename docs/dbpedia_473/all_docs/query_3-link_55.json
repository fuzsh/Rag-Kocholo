        "text": "Co-Intelligence:\n\nThe Applied Wisdom of Wholeness, Interconnectedness, and Co-Creativity\n\nWhile our global societies boast intelligence and even collective intelligence, their ability to address our escalating global challenges remains tragically inadequate.\n\nIn \"Co-Intelligence - The Applied Wisdom of Wholeness, Interconnectedness, and Co-Creativity,\" Tom Atlee proposes the transformative shift we may be missing: the grounded and yet visionary leap into the realm of co-intelligence.\n\nThrough essays, stories and poems, he highlights this holistic manifestation of intelligence that holds the key to cultivating meaningful collective wisdom for the long-term benefit of all.\n\nSee the dedicated webpage and endorsements here\n\nAvailable in Paperback & e-Book | Buy on Amazon\n\nThe Tao of Democracy\n\nUsing co-intelligence to create a world that works for all\n\nThe Tao of Democracy describes a new vision of politics and governance that can simultaneously address our unprecedented social problems and build a society that works for all.\n\nIt demonstrates how very different people can now find creative common ground and shared wisdom together. And it tells us how to use that fact to bring our dusty old politics up to speed, and find the wisdom we need to safely navigate the 21st century.\n\nAvailable in Paperback & e-Book | Buy on Amazon | Bookshop.org\n\nFor Bulk Copies, Email Us At cii@igc.org.\n\n“Here-and-now practices showing what's possible in our immediate future. An important gift for our small, challenged planet!”\n\n—Frances Moore Lappé\n\nAuthor of Diet for a Small Planet, Co-author of Hope's Edge\n\n“About the most important thing that's happening at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\n\n—Paul H. Ray, Ph.D.\n\nCo-author of The Cultural Creatives\n\nParticipatory Sustainability\n\nNotes for an Emerging Field of Civilizational Engagement\n\nParticipatory Sustainability introduces the idea that sustainability cannot be achieved merely through top-down government policy or economic activity. Sustainability requires the participation of all people and all parts of society, working with each other and with nature. The book provides dozens of approaches for doing this, including guidance for generating collective wisdom, participatory leadership, inclusive participatory forms of power, and six expanded dimensions of intelligence we can use together to address the depth and complexity of the challenges we face. Recognition of the intrinsic participatory nature of both sustainability (co-creating a good life for our grandchildren) and non-sustainability (co-creating disaster) provides both motivation and direction for making a better world, starting immediately.\n\nAvailable in Paperback | Buy on Amazon | Buy on Alternatives\n\nEmpowering Public Wisdom\n\nA Practical Vision of Citizen-Led Politics\n\nIn this book you will find how diverse citizens can generate a coherent, shared “voice of the people,” infusing the political process with wise common sense by learning about, reflecting on, and discussing what needs to be considered to produce long-term, inclusive benefits. Doing this together moves us beyond partisanship to a place of collective responsibility for our shared destiny.\n\n*Currently Out Of Print | Search for used copies.\n\n“Tom Atlee shows us how we can harness our collective wisdom to discern the way forward in these complex and challenging times. Inspiring and highly recommended!”\n\n—William Ury\n\nCo-author, GETTING TO YES, Author, THE THIRD SIDE\n\n“This book suggests new forms that can embed a wise public voice in real-world democratic governance, ­a wise and important development for the democracy movement.”\n\n—Hawaii State Senator Les Ihara, Jr.\n\nSenate Majority Policy Leader\n\nReflections on Evolutionary Activism\n\nEssays, Poems, and Prayers from an Emerging Field of Sacred Social Change\n\nEvolution, the most ancient, complex and self-organized of all change processes, has been going on for 13.7 billion years. We are now part of that process becoming conscious. Inspired by the Great Story of evolution and our role in it, and guided by our increasing understanding of evolutionary dynamics, we can co-create wiser social systems, cultures, consciousness, and technologies. Much of the material on this site is part of this co-creative adventure.\n\nAvailable in Paperback & e-Book | Buy on Amazon | Buy on Alternatives\n\n“Tom Atlee offers a fresh, and penetrating perspective — connecting our understanding of evolution, consciousness, and activism into a new and compelling synthesis for making a difference in today's challenged world.”\n\n—Juanita Brown and David Isaacs\n\nThe World Café"
