        "text": "Together we can be wiser than any of us can be alone.\n\nWe need to know how to tap that wisdom.\n\nHealthy communities, institutions and societies -- perhaps even our collective survival -- depend on our ability to organize our collective affairs more wisely, in tune with each other and nature.\n\nThis ability to wisely organize our lives together -- all of us being wiser together than any of us could be alone -- we call co-intelligence. Co-intelligence is diverse people working really well together in ways that make things better from a bigger picture perspective - especially in the face of challenge and change.\n\nIn its broadest sense, co-intelligence involves accessing the wisdom of the whole on behalf of the whole.\n\nCo-intelligence is emerging through new developments in democracy, organizational development, collaborative processes, the Internet and systems sciences like ecology and complexity. Today millions of people are involved in co-creating co-intelligence. Our diverse efforts grow more effective as we discover we are part of a larger evolutionary enterprise, and as we learn together and from each other.\n\nThe Co-Intelligence Institute works to further the understanding and development of co-intelligence. It focuses on catalyzing co-intelligence in the realms of politics, governance, economics and conscious evolution of ourselves and our social systems. We research, network, advocate, and help organize leading-edge experiments and conversations in order to weave what is possible into new, wiser forms of civilization.\n\nThis site includes hundreds of articles and references describing proven methods, innovative models, practical visions and the theoretical frameworks that weave them all together. It has rightly been called a treasure-trove. Welcome to its resources. You can get a good overview on our FAQ and Topics pages.\n\nThank you for whatever you may be doing to make groups, organizations, communities and whole cultures more effective, vibrant, sustainable and wise. We expect our work to empower yours. We welcome your support.\n\nHome || Previous Homepage || What's New || Search || Who We Are || Co-Intelligence || Our Work || Projects || Contact || Don't Miss || Articles || Topics || Books || Links || Subscribe || Take Action || Donate || Legal Notices"
