Keep checking back for live updates from the Capitol. Read our previous coverage here.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nNov. 13, 2013\n\nHawaii governor signs same-sex marriage legislation into law\n\nPhoto: Diane Lee\n\nToday Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed the Hawaii Marriage Equality bill into law, making the Aloha State the 15th state to allow gay couples to legally wed.\n\nAt the Hawaii Convention Center's Liliu Theater, the governor signed the measure with a koa pen in front of a crowd of about 200 invited guests and state lawmakers.\n\n\"I intend to give this pen, that signs this bill on this day, to Justice [Steven] Levinson,\" Abercombie says. The crowd screamed with joy.\n\nA retired Hawaii Supreme Court Justice, Levinson wrote the 1993 Baehr v. Lewin decision that denying same-sex partners the right to marry violated the state constitution.\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\n\"Done!\" Abercrombie says, after signing SB1 HD1. The crowd goes wild, cheering and clapping.\n\nPhoto: Diane Lee\n\n10:22 a.m.\n\nAn emotional Sen. Clayton Hee pauses and chokes up at the podium. The crowd applauds. \"I've been telling people my role in this journey has been a small one and an important one. But it's weight is beginning to rest on me,\" Hee says.\n\n\"Someday as the song 'Imagine' depicts the world will accept all of us for who we are,\" Hee says. \"I could never imagine to have played a small role in a profound, yet in my mind, a simple thing to do: bring justice and equality to all.\"\n\nPhoto: Diane Lee\n\n10:10 a.m.\n\nHawaiian singers Amy Hanaialii and Willie K. reunited for a performance together—the first time in 10 years. \"We're kinda out of practice,\" Willie K. joked. At the ceremony, they sang an emotional mashup of \"Imagine\" and \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\" After the performance, someone shouted \"Thank you—that was beautiful!\" Willie K. shouted back, \"You're welcome!\" The crowd laughed out loud.\n\n10 a.m.\n\nGov. Neil Abercrombie arrives.\n\nMostly supporters, including Equality Hawaii, Pride Alliance Hawaii and Hawaii United for Marriage, attended the invitation-only gathering.\n\nPhoto: Diane Lee\n\nKumu Hina and Brad Lum at the gathering.\n\nPhoto: Diane Lee\n\nSen.
