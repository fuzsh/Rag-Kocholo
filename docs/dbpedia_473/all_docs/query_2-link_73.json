        "text": "By Tim Sakahara - bio | email\n\nHONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - The State Senate has a new leader. Colleen Hanabusa is off to Congress and remaining state senators didn't waste any time naming her replacement. The majority of Senate Democrats voted for Shan Tsutsui as the next Senate President.\n\n\"Whether you're a democrat or republican in the senate it will be my job to make sure we all work together,\" said Tsutsui.\n\nThe Maui senator represents Wailuku and Kahului. He's been in the State Senate since 2002. He was the vice chair of the Ways and Means Committee and was selected over Donna Mercado Kim who was the chair. He also beat out Russell Kokubun who was the senate vice president last session.\n\n\"I wouldn't necessarily say leapfrog but one of the things you look at when you look at an organizational structure, is it's not just the senate president, it's all the other leadership assignments, it's the committee structure,\" explained Tsutsui. \"You're really voting on an entire organizational structure versus one position so that's basically what happened last night.\"\n\nTsutsui says he's humbled and excited to work with everyone.\n\n\"Senator Kim, Senator Kokubun, they're all on board. We talked this morning and they said they fully support this organizational structure and want to be a part of this team moving forward,\" said Tsutsui.\n\nMercado Kim will serve as vice president for the second time. David Ige will chair the Ways and Means Committee. Kokubun will chair the Water and Land Committee.\n\nOn the Republican side Sam Slom is the only member in the Senate from the GOP.\n\nHouse Republicans made their new leadership appointments. In a news release Republicans announced Gene Ward will be the Minority Leader. Kymberly Pine will continue to serve as the Minority Floor Leader. Cynthia Thielen remains the Assistant Minority Leader, Corinne Ching will be the Assistant Minority Floor Leader and Barbara Marumoto will be the Minority Policy Leader. The three freshman George Fontaine, Aaron Johanson and Gil Riviere will serve as Whips.\n\n\"Our new Caucus is excited and united and ready to do the people's business, particularly regarding fiscal responsibility and job creation in the 2011 Session. We are very pleased to have grown 33 1/3 percent representing the first net-gain in the size of caucus in 10 years,\" said Ward in a written statement.\n\nHouse Democrats have not scheduled any meetings regarding leadership changes.\n\nNext session begins the third Wednesday of January.\n\nBelow is a complete list of Senate leadership and committee chairs.\n\nCopyright 2010 Hawaii News Now.
