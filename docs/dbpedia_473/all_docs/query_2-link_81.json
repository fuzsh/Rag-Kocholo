        "text": "copied directly from an email from Tom Atlee:\n\n“SUMMARY: Hawaii State Senator Les Ihara (who has signed the Co-Intelligence Institute’s “Pledge to Hear the People’s Common Sense”) is now organizing state legislators across the country to strengthen public deliberation as a force in state governance. This Thursday 7/22 he and other legislators are sponsoring a session to discuss this at the annual meeting of the main national organization of state legislators in Salt Lake City. He is asking supporters of this initiative (like us) to do two things:\n\n1. To encourage our state legislators — if they are attending this annual meeting — to go to this session on citizen deliberation and\n\n2. To call or email our state legislators to join this state-level citizen deliberation effort for the long haul.\n\nDetails are below.”\n\nDear friends,\n\nPeople often ask “What can I do to further co-intelligence and wise democracy in my area?” Often the answers I give require people to do more than they’re ready for. But every now and then someone organizes an intiative that allows the rest of us to take a small action that together adds up to a big result. Thanks to the work of Senator Les Ihara, we can now do exactly that. If you can act on this before Thursday, July 22 — Great! If not, you can still have a real impact. Please read on…\n\nACTION TO TAKE BEFORE THURSDAY JULY 22\n\nSTEP A. Find the names and contact information for your state legislators. If you don’t have this information, you can easily get it by typing your 9-digit ZIP code into the search box on the upper left corner of . That will show you all state and national elected officials and candidates for your district.\n\nSTEP B. If any of your state legislators are on Sen. Ihara’s list of hot prospects below, send them an email AND call their offices saying you’d like them to attend the “NCSL ancillary group session on ‘Strengthening the Legislator-Citizen Connection’ on Thursday July 22 at 4:00-5:00 pm in the Salt Palace Convention Center #151-F (Lower Level).” The legislators listed below are hot prospects because they are all attending the annual meeting AND Sen. Ihara has reason to believe they’d be interested in this session. He’d like us to nudge them along.\n\nAlabama / Representative Cam Ward\n\nAlaska / Senator Con Bunde\n\nArkansas / Representative Joyce Elliott\n\nArkansas / Representative Mike Creekmore\n\nDelaware / Senator Dori Connor\n\nIndiana / Representative Dennie Oxley\n\nMaryland / Delegate Susan McComas\n\nMaryland / Delegate Adrienne A. Mandel\n\nMassachusetts / Senator Richard T. Moore\n\nMinnesota / Senator John Hottinger\n\nMississippi / Representative John Mayo\n\nNew Mexico / Senator Dede Feldman\n\nNorth Carolina / Representative Louis M. Pate, Jr.\n\nNorth Carolina / Representative Martha Alexander\n\nOhio / Representative Merle Grace Kearns\n\nOhio / Representative Larry Price\n\nOhio / Senator Tom Roberts\n\nPennsylvania / Representative David J. Steil\n\nPennsylvania / Representative Harold James\n\nTennessee / Representative Mark L. Maddox\n\nUtah / Representative Ralph Becker\n\nVermont / Senator Ann E. Cummings\n\nVirginia / Senator Emmett Hanger\n\nVirginia / Senator R. Edward Houck\n\nWashington /Senator Jeanne Kohl-Welles\n\nWashington / Representative Velma Veloriz\n\nSTEP C. For any legislators who are not on the list of hot prospects, you can find out if they are among the 1000 or so legislators attending the annual meeting. It would be best to call their offices and ask: “Is [legislator] attending the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Salt Lake City this week?”\n\n1. YES — If the staff person says, “Yes” then say, “Could you please tell them that I’d really like them to attend the NCSL ancillary group session on ‘Strengthening the Legislator-Citizen Connection’ on Thursday July 22 at 4:00-5:00 pm in the Salt Palace Convention Center #151-F (Lower Level). And I’d like to hear what they thought of it.” Give them your contact information. Then send that legislator an email that says the same thing.\n\n2. NO — If the staff person says, “No” then say, “OK. Please tell [legislator] that I’m very concerned about the lack of citizen deliberation at the state level. Several leading state legislators are organizing themselves with the help of a major non-profit, the Kettering Foundation, to learn more about public deliberation and to promote it to their constituents and their fellow legislators. This effort could make a tremendous difference and I would really like [legislator] to take a lead in this. Please ask him/her to contact the leader of this effort, Senator Les Ihara of Hawaii at to find out more about it. Also ask him to let me know what he thinks of it.” Give them your contact information. Then send that legislator an email that says the same thing.\n\nACTION TO TAKE AFTER JULY 22\n\nIf you don’t get to this before Senator Ihara’s session on Thursday, that’s OK. You can still have an important impact by finding out your legislators’ names and contact info (STEP A, above) and making the phone call and/or sending the email described in STEP C (2), above.\n\nSending an email is fairly simple. It could go something like this:\n\nDear [legislator],\n\nI feel very strongly that our state legislature needs to get involved in convening — and listening to — citizen deliberative activities. Many very sophisticated methods for public deliberation exist, which we should be using in [your state]. Hawaii State Senator Les Ihara and several other state legislators are organizing themselves with the help of a major non-profit, the Kettering Foundation, to learn more about public deliberation and to promote it to their constituents and their fellow legislators. This effort could make a tremendous difference and I would really like to see you take a leadership role in it, which I think would be quite popular with voters. Please contact Senator Les Ihara at , who is leading this effort, to find out more about it. Then let me know what you think of it. Thank you ahead of time for looking into this for all of us.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[your name, address and email]\n\nFeel free to vary the messages above — which I’ve just provided for your convenience — using the informatiuon below. Note that what you’re advocating here doesn’t promote one side of one issue but rather promotes better deliberation to integrate all sides of every issue. So the kind of “lobbying” you’re doing for it constitutes a different kind of citizenship, a different kind of activism, a way to nudge the whole system towards wiser democracy.\n\nStates legislatures — most of whom are reeling from budget crises and partisanship — are fertile ground for citizen deliberation intiatives right now. So now is a great time to move this ahead.\n\nWhatever we all end up doing on this, may it have a profound effect on the expansion of citizen deliberation and, ultimately, on the emergence of wise democracy in our states, nation and world.\n\nCoheartedly,\n\nTom\n\n_ _ _ _ __\n\nTHE FULL INFORMATION ABOUT SEN. LES IHARA’S SESSION\n\nStrengthening the Legislator-Citizen Connection * Ancillary Group Session\n\n* NCSL Annual Meeting * Salt Lake City UT * July 22, 2004 (Thursday) *\n\n4:00-5:00 pm, Salt Palace Convention Center #151-F (Lower Level)\n\nPublic trust in government is alarmingly low and some legislators think\n\nit’s time to address the issue head on. NCSL has been working with a\n\ngroup of state legislators who are highly interested in connecting with\n\ncitizens in more meaningful ways. Looking at citizen forums, conflict\n\nresolution processes, improved legislative hearings, civic education\n\nprograms and other options, this group is holding an annual meeting\n\nancillary session to share best practices, advice and information on how\n\nto improve the legislator-citizen connection. NCSL has two grants to fund\n\nwork in this area of citizen engagement and conflict resolution, and this\n\nsession will also examine legislator and legislative staff suggestions on\n\nwhat kind of NCSL projects, information and assistance would help\n\nlegislatures.\n\nThis session is open to any member of the citizen engagement working group\n\nor any legislator or legislative staffer interested in the topic. Grant\n\nfunding provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the\n\nKettering Foundation. Session moderators will include: Bruce Feustel, NCSL\n\nLegislative Management; Peggy Kerns, NCSL Center for Ethics In Government;\n\nand Hawaii Senator Les Ihara, Jr.\n\n_ _ _ __\n\nMORE INFORMATION ON THIS WHOLE INITIATIVE\n\nThis powerhouse initiative in the field of citizen deliberation was instigated by State Senator Les Ihara of Hawaii . Senator Ihara is the first politician to sign the Co-Intelligence Institute-sponsored “Public Pledge to Hear the People’s Common Sense” . Now he is organizing state legislators across the U.S. to enhance public participation in state-level decision-making. Working through the primary national association of state legislators — the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) — he is identifying receptive state legislators with whom he can collaborate to develop a range of powerful examples of deliberation and, ultimately “evolve the culture of legislative bodies — where the public is fundamental to the legislative process, and legislatures are models for the practice of democracy.”\n\nHe has also brokered a 3-year agreement between NCSL and the Kettering Foundation . Kettering is a leader in the U.S. deliberative democracy movement, having sponsored widespread citizen deliberation on public issues for years. Through their new agreement with NCSL, Kettering will be supporting efforts\n\n* to study current and potential ways for legislators to engage the public;\n\n* to encourage and prepare interested legislators to participate in deliberative forums;\n\n* to incorporate discussion of deliberation in new legislator trainings;\n\n* to educate NCSL staff on public deliberation;\n\n* to develop ways to use deliberative activities for legislators outreach;\n\n* to use existing NCSL issue projects to engage citizens deliberatively; and\n\n* to develop a national network of deliberation-friendly legislators.\n\nKettering-funded, NCSL-sponsored research is expected to address questions such as:\n\n* What do we know about public disaffection with the legislature?\n\n* When do both citizens and legislators begin to recognize a need for each other?\n\n* What do we know about the capacity of state legislatures to hear a ‘public’ voice?\n\n* How could legislators get a better sense of how the public decides issues?\n\n* What happens to the legislator/public relationship when legislators listen while the public is\n\nworking through issues in deliberative forums?\n\n* What is the role of an official when there is no ‘public’ readily visible?\n\n_ _ _ _\n\nMore details and requests from Senator Les Ihara:\n\nIn the next year, we seek to involve more legislators in the project…and\n\nthis is where you could help. If you know a state legislator who supports\n\ninvolving citizens in legislative policy making, please let me know. We plan\n\nto meet later this year with interested legislators, and probably twice in\n\n2005. Information on all 5,400 state legislators, including email addresses,\n\nare available at http://www.ncsl.org/public/leglinks.cfm and I encourage you\n\nto increase your contacts with them. [Note from Tom: This link lists all\n\nthe legislators but doesn’t help you find your own. The\n\nlink helps you identify your reps.]\n\nOf expected NCSL conference attendees, we’ve identified 27 legislators who\n\nmight be interested in meeting with us. Their names and emails are below.\n\nReinforcing encouragement could increase attendance.\n\nI view state legislatures as a primary venue for public policy discussions\n\nin a state, and want to encourage citizens to become involved in public\n\ndeliberations in their own state legislature. A first step is for us to open\n\nup conversations with interested legislators. I consider us partners in\n\npromoting open deliberation of public policy issues, and appreciate the work\n\nwe have in common. Thank you.\n\nLES IHARA, JR.\n\nHawaii State Senator\n\nhttp://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/ihara-bio.asp\n\n————————————\n\n27 LEGISLATORS INTERESTED IN PUBLIC DELIBERATION\n\nR – Alabama / Representative Cam Ward / Camjulward@aol.com\n\nR – Alaska / Senator Con Bunde / Senator_Con_Bunde@legis.state.ak.us\n\nD – Arkansas D / Representative Joyce Elliott / elliotj@arkleg.state.ar.us\n\nD – Arkansas / Representative Mike Creekmore / mcreekmore@arklet.state.ar.us\n\nR – Delaware / Senator Dori Connor / dorinda.connor@state.de.us\n\nD – Hawaii / Senator Les Ihara, Jr. / senihara@capitol.hawaii.gov\n\nD – Indiana / Representative Dennie Oxley / h73@ai.org\n\nR – Maryland / Delegate Susan McComas / susan_mccomas@house.state.md.us\n\nD – Maryland / Delegate Adrienne A.
