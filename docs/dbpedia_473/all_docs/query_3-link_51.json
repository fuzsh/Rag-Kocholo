Lee\n\nRepresentative Creagan\n\nRepresentative Johanson\n\nRepresentative Keohokalole\n\nRepresentative Lowen\n\nRepresentative Quinlan\n\nRepresentative Saiki\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Bill established a Carbon Farming Task Force to identify agricultural or aquacultural practices that sequester carbon, decrease marine sedimentation, and provide emissions reduction to support the creation of a carbon farming certification. The Task Force must produce a preliminary report of its findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation to the legislature before the regular session in 2023 and produce a final report prior to the regular session of 2025.\n\nThe Task Force was overseen by the State of Hawaii Office of Planning and funded through the General Fund of the State of Hawaii.\n\nSoil Health Definition:\n\n“Soils that enhance their continuing capacity to function as a biological system, increase soil organic matter, improve soil structure and water and nutrient holding capacity, and result in net long-term greenhouse gas benefits.”\n\nStated Goals:\n\nTo identify agricultural or aquacultural activities and best practices that provide carbon sequestration benefits that may be used to establish a carbon farming certification.\n\nTo reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector and to improve Hawaii’s resilience to climate change\n\nThe Task Force was conceived to overcome the historic division between agriculture and environmentalists through soil health and carbon farming as well as achieve Hawaii’s climate goals.\n\nProgram Required Measurements:\n\nN/A\n\nTools & Guidance:\n\nN/A\n\nFunding Source/s:\n\nThe General Fund of the State of Hawaii (received $50,000 in the fiscal year 2017-2018)\n\nFunding Type/s:\n\nN/A\n\nPractices Eligible for Funding:\n\nN/A\n\nAgencies Involved:\n\nState of Hawaii Office of Planning\n\nRulemaking Process:\n\nTask Force is overseen by the Office of Planning\n\nState Universities & Researchers:\n\nThe University of Hawaii Manoa, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management, Crow Soil Ecology & Biogeochemistry Lab (land-grant university)\n\nAgricultural Organizations & Technical Assistance:\n\nHawai‘i Association of Conservation Districts (HACD)\n\nList of partners with the HACD\n\nNRCS Hawaii\n\nEducation & Advocacy Groups:\n\nHawai‘i Center for Food Safety\n\nLessons Learned:\n\nTake the time upfront to educate lawmakers on the synergies and opportunities possible through improving soil health\n\nBring together ranchers, farmers, and environmentalists. The Center for Food Safety hosted a conference to educate and build relationships; in this process, it was critical to ensure that producers and land managers had a seat at the table from the beginning. This helped people work together and agree on shared goals.\n\nWhile Task Force members are often met with skepticism because their position is often one of compromise on stricter or more “impactful” laws, the Task Force performs important groundwork for future work through building coalitions and education\n\nThis bill benefited from a strong elected champion who introduced and shepherded it through the legislature.\n\nMedia:\n\nClimate Smart and Healthy Soils, Hawaii\n\nMaps:\n\nBack to Top\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nGreenhouse Gas Sequestration Task Force (GGSTF)\n\nDates:\n\nHB 2182 passed June 2018\n\nTask Force formed February 2019\n\nLegislation:\n\nHB 2182, Act 15, SLH: Environmental Protection; Carbon Farming Task Force; Greenhouse Gas Sequestration Task Force; Sequestration; Emissions; Office of Planning; Task Force; Appropriation\n\nSponsor/s:\n\nRepresentative C. Lee\n\nDescription:\n\nIn June 2018, Hawaii’s Governor Ige signed HB 2182 into law as “Act 15,” establishing a permanent Greenhouse Gas Sequestration Task Force in the Office of Planning and Sustainable Development. Act 15 repealed Act 33 (2017), replacing the Carbon Farming Task Force with the new Greenhouse Gas Sequestration Task Force (GHGSTF). The GHGSTF is made up of 19 members, representing state and local government, universities and extension programs, environmental nonprofits, agricultural/ranching associations, and other relevant appointees.\n\nAct 15 also established a statewide target to both adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sequestering more GHGs than the state produces by 2045:\n\n“This chapter establishes the framework for the State to:\n\n(1) Adapt to the inevitable impacts of global warming and climate change, including rising sea levels, temperatures, and other risk factors; and\n\n(2) Mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than the State produces as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.”\n\nSoil Health Definition:\n\nNo soil health definition yet. Definitions for agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU), agroforestry, carbon sink, and forestry can be found here.\n\nStated Goals:\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Sequestration Task Force (GHGSTF) aims to align Hawaii’s climate initiative goals with the state’s clean energy and carbon sequestration efforts. The mandated tasks include:\n\nEstablish a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions baseline as well as short- and long-term GHG sequestration benchmarks;\n\nIdentify criteria to measure GHG sequestration that may be used to create a certification program for practices that generate agricultural and GHG benefits;\n\nIdentify policies that would promote increased GHG sequestration and build healthy soils;\n\n“Identify ways to increase the generation and use of compost in Hawai‘i to build healthy soils”;\n\nIdentify policies to add trees and vegetation in urban areas to mitigate high temperatures and increase climate resiliency;\n\nMake recommendations to the legislature and governor regarding measures to increase climate resiliency, build healthy soils, provide greenhouse gas benefits, or cool urban areas;\n\nDevelop incentives and funding mechanisms for these practices; and\n\nProvide research, education, and technical support.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe task force is set to present a preliminary report to the legislature and climate change mitigation and adaptation commission no later than 20 days before the convening of Hawaii’s 2023 legislative session, and will submit a final report no later than 20 days before the convening of the 2024 legislative session.\n\nDuring their March 16th 2022 meeting, the task force formed three Permitted Interaction Groups (PIGs), one on agriculture, one covering aquaculture and marine use, and one on urban green infrastructure, to research and report on their respective scopes in preparation for the preliminary report. Both the agriculture PIG and the urban green infrastructure PIG are tasked with identifying and making recommendations to increase the generation and use of compost.\n\nProgram Required Measurements:\n\nN/A\n\nTools & Guidance:\n\nN/A\n\nFunding Source/s:\n\nAppropriated $150,000 from the general revenues of the State of Hawaii for the fiscal year 2018-2019 to create the Task Force\n\nDefunded in 2019-2020.\n\nFunding Type/s:\n\nN/A\n\nAgencies Involved:\n\nState of Hawaii Office of Planning\n\nRulemaking Process:\n\nTask Force is overseen by the Office of Planning\n\nState Universities & Researchers:\n\nThe University of Hawaii Manoa, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources Natural Resources and Environmental Management (NREM) has several ongoing projects to support the Task Force (land-grant university)\n\nAgricultural Organizations & Technical Assistance:\n\nHawaii Agriculture Research Center (HARC)\n\nHawaii Association of Conservation Districts (HACD)\n\nList of partners with the HACD\n\nNRCS Hawaii\n\nEducation & Advocacy Groups:\n\nUnknown\n\nLessons Learned:\n\nN/A\n\nMedia:\n\nN/A\n\nMaps:\n\nN/A\n\nBack to Top\n\nNOT PASSED: Cover Crop Reimbursement Pilot Program\n\nDates:\n\nIntroduced January 2020. Failed to pass in July 2020.\n\nLegislation:\n\nSB2704/HB2167\n\nSponsor/s:\n\nRepresentative Dale Kobayashi\n\nSenator Roz Baker\n\nSenator Les Ihara Jr.\n\nSenator Gil Riviere\n\nSenator Russell Ruderman\n\nSenator Mike Gabbard\n\nDescription:\n\nThis bill would establish a cover crop reimbursement pilot program to provide up to 100% cost reimbursement to farmers or ranchers in Hawaii for acquiring cover crop seeds or green manure. A cover crop reimbursement pilot program manager position would be created within the Department of Agriculture to administer the program.\n\nSoil Health Definition:\n\nN/A\n\nStated Goals:\n\n“The legislature finds that the use of cover crops and green manure increases agricultural productivity and aligns with the State’s integrated sustainability goals. Plants used for this purpose, including grasses, legumes, and forbs, add nutrients to the soil, act as windbreaks, assist with water retention, provide habitats for beneficial insects, and help to prevent soil erosion.\n\nThe legislature further finds that it is in the interests of the State to incentivize the use of management practices that enhance the quality and sustainability of Hawaii’s agricultural lands.”\n\nProgram Required Measurements:\n\nN/A\n\nTools:\n\nN/A\n\nFunding Source:\n\nAppropriation from the general fund.\n\nFunding Type:\n\nReimbursement up to $50,000 per year per applicant.\n\nPractices eligible for funding:\n\n“Cover crop” and “green manure” mean the plants listed in the cover crop and green manure database maintained by the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources.\n\nAgencies Involved:\n\nHawaii Department of Agriculture’s (HDOA)\n\nRulemaking process:\n\nThe program would be implemented by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture’s (HDOA).\n\nState Universities & Researchers:\n\nUniversity of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources\n\nAgricultural Organizations & Technical Assistance:\n\nN/A\n\nEducation & Advocacy Groups:\n\nN/A\n\nLessons Learned:\n\nN/A\n\nMedia:\n\nN/A\n\nVETOED BY THE GOVERNOR –Healthy Soils Program\n\nSB2989 is a new bill establishing a Healthy Soils Program that was enrolled to the Governor May 2022. The Healthy Soils Program requires the Department of Agriculture to offer education, technical assistance, and grants to help farmers implement healthy soils practices. $500,000 was appropriated to support this bill.\n\nThe Healthy Soils Program shall:\n\nCreate a statewide soil health assessment\n\nProvide education and technical assistance to farmers\n\nEstablish healthy soils standards based on the findings of the GHGSTF (created by Act 15)\n\nProvide financial incentives to encourage on-farm healthy soils practices\n\nThe Act was set to take effect on July 1, 2022 but was vetoed by the Governor.\n\nAllowing Composting in Agricultural Districts\n\nHB1992 facilitates composting by making it a newly permissible activity within agricultural districts. The Hawaii legislature recognized the soil health, agricultural, and climate benefits of allowing composting in agricultural districts.\n\nThis bill amended Hawaii’s definition of agriculture to now include composting, as follows:\n\n“Composting and co-composting operations; provided that operations that process their own green waste and do not require permits from the department of health shall use the finished composting product only on the operation’s own premises to minimize the potential spread of invasive species.”\n\nThe bill was transmitted from the Hawaii legislature to the Governor May 2022.\n\nFarmer Apprentice Mentoring Program\n\nSB3197 appropriates $300,000 toward a farmer mentorship program to help new farmers learn soil health best practices from mentor farmers. Since composting is considered a best practice, this program can promote composting and assist with monitoring of newly permitted operations.\n\nThis bill was enrolled to the Governor May 2022 and is expected to take effect in July 2022.\n\nWe thank Sophia Jones, Policy and Development Associate at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance for her contributions to this page.\n\nLast Update 01/12/2023\n\nQuestions?\n\nContact Hawaii@healthysoilspolicy.org"
