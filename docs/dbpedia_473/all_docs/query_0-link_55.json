        "text": "Hawaiian Humane's Winter 2024 Community Newsletter. In this issue of Paw Prints, we reflect on the meaning of laulima - \"many hands working together\" in Ōlelo Hawaiʻi - and how it permeates all that the Hawaiian Humane Society does in collaboration with dedicated partners, volunteers, supporters and friends. Learn about the Hawaiian Humane Society's partnership with the City and County of Honolulu Department of Emergency Management and American Humane on disaster response training; meet some of our off-site adoption partners who help to make adoption that much more accessible in the community; the launch of our new Lap Crashers foster program for cats; how local content creator and celebrity, Bretman Rock, stepped up to help a lost dog in need; and Hawaiian Humane's successful Hele on Home Challenge, which sought to reunite a record number of lost pets with their families in the field; and more."
