        "text": "HEADS UP! PLEASE SHARE WIDELY!\n\nAs we expected, the A&B Water Bill is back! Not satisfied with their loss at the legislature on Thursday, and with $62 million on the line, A&B is pulling out all the stops to pass a bill that would give them another 7 years to divert East Maui streams without any environmental review.\n\nUpcountry water is NOT at risk, as it is protected by a court order. This is really all about A&B’s profit.\n\nTHIS ZOMBIE BILL WON’T DIE. Rumor has it that a Senate Floor vote will be forced on Tuesday. This would be the terrible House version (without all of Senator Kahele’s thoughtful amendments) and if it passes a Senate floor vote it will go right to the Governor to be signed into law.\n\nKILL THE BILL FOR GOOD!\n\nPLEASE HELP BY CALLING YOUR SENATOR.\n\nTHEN CALL ALL THE OTHER SENATORS.\n\nFINALLY, CALL HOUSE FINANCE CHAIR SYLVIA LUKE.\n\nShe has the power to withhold funding for important projects in Senators’ districts. Word is that she’s pushing for this bill hard. She needs to stop doing that and respect the will of the people who have worked so hard to stop this bad bill.\n\nThey all need to know that WE OPPOSE HB1326 HD2 (House Bill 1326, House Draft 2), WHICH WOULD BAIL OUT ALEXANDER & BALDWIN TO THE TUNE OF $62 MILLION. Please ask Senators to vote NO if the bill comes up on the Senate floor.\n\nIf the call goes to voice mail, please leave a message. If the voice mail is full, please send them an email. Better yet, do both! They need to know that we are watching!\n\nWe are close to winning this for good, but we need your help to keep the legislature from reversing our win before the end of the legislative session.\n\nPLEASE CALL and/or EMAIL TODAY!\n\nMAHALO!\n\nHOUSE FINANCE CHAIR:\n\nLuke, Sylvia (D)\n\nPhone: 808-586-6200\n\nEmail: repluke@Capitol.hawaii.gov\n\nSENATORS:\n\nBaker, Rosalyn H.
