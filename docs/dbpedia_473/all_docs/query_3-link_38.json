        "text": "Kaimuki Neighborhood Board No. 4\n\nDRAFT -- SPECIAL MEETING MINUTES\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 28, 2015\n\nKAIMUKI CHRISTIAN CHURCH, FELLOWSHIP HALL\n\nCALL TO ORDER: Chair Lyle Bullock called the meeting to order at 5:37 p.m. with a total of eight (8) members present.\n\nBoard Members Present: Lyle Bullock, Brian Kang, James Larson, Marilyn Moniz-Kahoohanohano, William Paik, Liberty Peralta, Sharon Schneider, and Lori Yamada.\n\nBoard Members Absent: Samantha Ruiz, Paul Hoe\n\nGuests: Gerry DeBenedetti, Ashley Norman, Scot Shimamura, Matthew Gonser, Mr. Elwood, George Atta (DPP Director), Marjorie Miurt, Councilmember Ann Kobayashi (District V), Sandy Simmons, Molly Jenkins, Gerry Ralston, Wayne Rae Tadaki, Cre MacDonald, Nuce Town, Catherine Nughes, Michael Schuster, Janet Hirata, The Rev.

Members of the PIG and Kaimuki Neighborhood Board #4 (NB4) are introduced. Meeting agenda is outlined for audience.\n\nSharon Schneider: Ms. Schneider welcomes the audience. Provides background of the PIG and goals.\n\nCouncilmember Ann Kobayashi: Councilmember Kobayashi provides comments on the PIG, overview of her thoughts and the history of Kaimuki.\n\nCouncilmember Trevor Ozawa: Councilmember Ozawa provides his thoughts on changes in Kaimuki community. Recognizes Kaimuki as a special place.\n\nDPP Director George Atta: DPP Director Atta provides a \"Zoning 101\" for audience. Land Use regulations, General Plan, process for permits are discussed. Director describes limits of zoning regulations, identifying Revised Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) Chapter 21 as location for zoning regulations. All land is zoned, which designates permitted uses. Land Use Ordinance (LUO) describes development standards. Zoning is related to specific lot size. Director notes that changing zoning has ripple effects in a given area.\n\nDirector identifies Mixed Use Zoning as only type of zoning where multiple potential uses of one lot are permitted. Subdivision of lots is not related to zoning, Street Use is not related to zoning, and zoning is only one aspect/dimension of LUO. Creating a Special District (the goal of the PIG) is covered by ROH Chapter 21, how this would apply would depend on the goals of the PIG.\n\nAudience Questions:\n\nQ: Does Director Atta have a presentation?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Are Improvement Districts included in ROH Chapter 21?\n\nA: Improvement Districts are not covered by Chapter 21. Zoning is a different component of City Ordinances.\n\nQ: Can the public view old \"Master or Vision\" Plans for Kaimuki?\n\nA: Yes. DPP can provide them by request, there may be many iterations of the Master Plan.\n\nQ: Can DPP consider Transit Oriented Development (TOD) for high traffic areas?\n\nA: Yes. This occasionally comes up at DPP. TOD is considered for future rail and bus lines, can be used to modify parking requirements for rail areas, nothing is currently planned for Kaimuki, but could be considered.\n\nQ: How do we change the zoning rules?\n\nA: By creating a Special District. Accomplished by changing the LUO or Zoning Code. Aesthetics can be considered, however it is not regularly included. Covering 50% of a lot is currently permitted in Kaimuki.\n\nDirector Atta exits the meeting (6:02pm)\n\nDTS Deputy Director Mark Garrity: Deputy Director Garrity came to the meeting to provide a transportation focused perspective. Kaimuki is an interesting community, is very walkable, pressure to develop is increasing, bus service is good and Waialae Avenue bike lane is good.\n\nHistoric Hawaii Foundation: HHF member provides history of Kaimuki, of its arid environment, usefulness during King Kamehameha the Great's invasion of Oahu, history of Pu`u O Kaimuki (now known as Telegraph Hill), land division during the Great Mehele, changes to Kaimuki following the building of the H-1, efforts to preserve historic homes in the area.\n\nProfessor Matt Gonser (UH): Interested in community guiding the City and State to respond to area residents' concerns and goals. Strong support for sustainability but cautions that compromise is important for things to improve and move forward.\n\nAUDIENCE QUESTION AND ANSWER:\n\nQ: What is the required \"set-back\" for properties?\n\n(UH) A: Property line is up to sidewalk.\n\nQ: Can parking be restricted to residents?\n\n(DTS) A: Technically, yes. However not practiced on Oahu.\n\nQ: Can the rail be extended to Kaimuki?\n\n(DTS) A: Some studies have been done, however not currently planned.\n\nQ: Can the City install a \"proper\" bike track on Waialae?\n\n(DTS) A: Could be considered, however bike track on South King Street is still a pilot project.\n\nQ: Can the parking lot between 12th Avenue and Koko Head Avenue be re-paved?\n\n(DTS) A: Monies have been allocated in the budget to repave the lot.\n\nQ: Can street lights be changed to LED?\n\n(DTS) A: The whole island of Oahu is slated to have street lights changed to LED. Completion date is not firm, NB4 will be updated when more information is available.\n\nQ: How many Special Districts on Oahu?\n\n(UH) A: Not sure.\n\nQ: What special tools are available for Historic Building owners?\n\n(HHS) A: Special Districts, which give guidelines, or Historic Districts, which give stronger guidelines and require Conditional Use Permits (CUP) to modify property.\n\nQ: Status of Queen Theater and Liliuokalani Elementary School?\n\n(HHS) A: Liliuokalani Elementary School will be repurposed. Queen Theater is a private property and therefore not up to government, state of disrepair is acknowledged.\n\nQ: How can people be encouraged to downsize their property and how can homeowners be assisted in staying in Kaimuki?\n\n(UH) A: Zoning permitting and persons owning their own home.\n\n<Member of the Public interjects> Legislative options are under review at City Council.\n\nQ: How to deal with cars parked on sidewalk blocking access?\n\n(DTS) A: \"Unimproved Sidewalk\" is where these vehicles are parked, is not permitted but only enforced by complaint. Sidewalks can be built, under Special Improvement District, but requires cost-sharing between homeowners and City.\n\n<Member of the Public interjects> Issue is often on private streets.\n\nQ: Who is on the PIG?\n\n(NB4) A: Sharon Schneider, Marilyn Moniz-Kahoohanohano, Brian Kang\n\nQ: What next?\n\n(NB4) A: More neighborhood meetings, collect more community input. PIG will be folded into regular item for NB4.\n\nQ: Can parking requirements for new businesses be loosened?\n\n(DTS) A: Current code requires new businesses to provide parking on site. DTS would be open to discussing a \"better way\", perhaps shared parking. Could be revised in Master Plan for Kaimuki. DPP would be important in determining best way to encourage business. Significant parking does exist in Kaimuki.\n\n(UH) A: Input from business owners is necessary.\n\nQ: <General concerns about Master Plan for Kaimuki>\n\n(NB4) A: NB4 is encouraging multifaceted approach, input from all stakeholders desired. At this time, it would only be a plan to guide the future of Kaimuki, without a plan the community has less input in how community grows. This plan would be a low-hanging fruit, not set in stone. NB4 is seeking strong support for the plan before finalization. Borders of Kaimuki are also in question. Much of the plan is still pending, not ready to present publicly.\n\nQ: Could the Kaimuki parking lot needing repaving become a double decked lot?\n\n(DTS) A: Not currently planned.\n\nCLOSING REMARKS:\n\nCouncilmember Ozawa:\n\n$1.5 million in budget to repair/update parking lot in Kaimuki. Believes TOD could apply to Kaimuki.\n\nNB4 (Schneider):\n\nStill work to be done but much has been accomplished by the PIG. The PIG will be closed but NB4 will continue to expand on work already done. Next steps not clearly defined but members committed to the goals.\n\nADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 7:35 p.m.\n\nSubmitted by: James Larson, Board Secretary\n\nReviewed by: Lyle Bullock, Chair"
