She was born on September 4, 1930 in Puunene Hospital, Wailuku, Maui. Shirley met her Hilo-born husband on Oahu where they were married on her 20th birthday. As a military wife, she traveled throughout the world, where she volunteered for the Red Cross and military Thrift Shops, all while raising six children. She was a good cook and baker, loved to play bridge and visit Las Vegas. Shirley is survived by her husband Les, and six children, Les Jr. (Cathy), Sherry (Clifford) Goya, Arlene (Walter) Thomas, Catherine (Steven) Kawamura, Percy (Laurie) and Daniel (Julie), 14 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. A celebration of life will be held on Tuesday, October 11th at Valley of the Temples, with visitation starting at 9am and funeral service at 10am. Aloha attire. No flowers."
