        "text": "DISASTROUS EXPLOSION OF A BOMB.\n\nReturning from the Church of San Geronimo, the procession\n\nhalted temporarily on the Calle mayor Bouquets, which were\n\nshowered from the balconies on the Royal couple, included one\n\nwhich concealed a steel bomb. The missile exploded towards the\n\nright, between the hindermost horses and the front wheel of the\n\nRoyal carriage. The groom was killed with two horses; the carriage\n\nwas damaged.\n\nThe Marquis of Sottomayor, Grand Chamberlain, and an equerry,\n\nwho were riding on the right, were wounded. A lieutenant standing\n\nat the salute and four soldiers lining the route were killed. The\n\nexplosion decapitated a police bugler, besides killing two women\n\nspectators and injuring numbers of other spectators.\n\nKING ALFONSO'S GALLANTRY.\n\nThe Duke of Cornaohuelos, rushing forward, opened the door of\n\nthe Royal carriage, and dragged out King Alfonso and then Queen\n\nEna, who exhibited great emotion. Both reached the palace uninjured.\n\nAt the moment of the explosion, recovering himself immediately,\n\nKing Alfonso spoke through the broken windows of the carriage, and\n\ninquired what damage had been done. Forthwith he sent an orderly\n\nto reassure the Princess Beatrice, the mother of his bride, and the\n\nQueen Mather, Christina-Maria, and raising his voice he ordered\n\nthe procession to proceed.\n\nQueen Ena, who was deathly pale, smiled courageously, and\n\nsoon King Alfonso and his bride were helped out, and continued the\n\njourney in another coach. The Queen broke down on reaching the\n\npalace. Courtiers pressed forward, but King Alfonso waved them\n\nback and tenderly supported his weeping wife.\n\nTHE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES.\n\nAt the time of the explosion the carriage of the Prince and\n\nPrincess of Wales was some distance ahead of that of King Alfonso.\n\nMESSAGES OF SYMPATHY.\n\nThe dominant note of comment in the newspapers is one of gratitude.\n\nThe providential escape of their majesties is interpreted as of\n\ngood augury for the sovereigns' happiness and that of Spain.\n\nMessages of sympathy and congratulations have been received\n\nin the Palace at Spain from all countries- *\n\nThe populace was furious at the attempt made on the lives of\n\nthe King and his Queen, and they nearly lynched several foreigners,\n\nincluding a French detective who was suspected during the confusion\n\nof the authorship of the outrage.\n\nSOCIETY MUST PROTECT ITSELF. '.\n\nAUthe newspapers agree that it is high time for society to take\n\nenergetic measures to protect itself from the danger of high explosives\n\nfalling into the hands of anarchists and homicides, The newspapers\n\nalso urge a reconsideration of the laws and attitude of the\n\npeople towards secret societies,\n\nv Strangely enough, a bomb emanated from the only house owned\n\nby the Queen Mother in Madrid. It was the bequest of a philanthropist,\n\nand is let as a grocery on the ground floor, and a boarding\n\nestablishment above.\n\nIt is supposed that the bomb thrower is one Manuel Duran, a\n\nwell-dressed Catalonian. He and many others have been arrested.\n\nTHE DEATH ROLL.\n\nThe Madrid correspondent of the \" Daily Telegraph\" states that\n\nthree officers, seven soldiers, and five spectators were killed by the\n\nexplosion of the bomb, and that 100 were injured more or less\n\nseriously, some of the injured being on the first floor balcony of the\n\nhouse from which the bomb was thrown."
