        "text": "Princess María de las Mercedes of Orléans (June 24, 1860 – June 26, 1878) was Queen of Spain as the first wife of King Alfonso XII of Spain. She was born in Madrid, the daughter of Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nHer father, Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, was her first cousin once removed, and the youngest son of King Louis-Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nHer mother, Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, was the younger daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his fourth wife and niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain was the sister King Fernando VII of Spain, the father of Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nInfanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain elder sister was Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBorn at the Palacio Real in Madrid on June 24, 1860, Mercedes was the sixth of her parents’ nine children. Her mother’s elder sister, Queen Isabella II, and brother-in-law, King Francisco, served as Mercedes’ godparents at her christening, when she was given the names: María de las Mercedes Isabel Francisca de Asís Antonia Luisa Fernanda Felipa Amalia Cristina Francisca de Paula Ramona Rita Cayetana Manuela Juana Josefa Joaquina Ana Rafaela Filomena Teresa Santísima Trinidad Gaspara Melchora Baltasara et omni sancti.\n\nAlthough Mercedes was patrilineally a French Princess, she was also a Spanish infanta and spent the first eight years of her life in Spain. Her childhood was spent at the Palace of San Telmo in Andalusia, her father’s rumoured aspirations to obtain his sister-in-law’s crown periodically rendering him unwelcome at the royal court in Madrid.\n\nMarriage and reign\n\nWhen Queen Isabella II was deposed in 1868, Mercedes’ family left Spain for exile. It was reportedly during that banishment in 1872 that she met her first cousin Infante Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, also living in exile. Queen Isabella II opposed a marriage between the two due to the hostilities between Mercedes’ father and the former Queen.\n\nUpon restoration, King Alfonso XII of Spain married María de las Mercedes at the church of Atocha in Madrid on January 23, 1878, following a huge ball in December 1877. Allegedly, the King’s choice dashed the hopes of his still-exiled mother Queen Isabella for Alfonso’s marriage to Infanta Blanca de Bourbon, daughter of his Carlist rival Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid.\n\nInfanta Blanca of Spain (1868 – 1949) was the eldest child of Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain and his wife Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma. Blanca was a member of the House of Bourbon and – according to the Carlists – an Infanta of Spain by birth.\n\nIn 1889 she married Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria. The couple had ten children. The family left Austria after the end of the Monarchy and finally settled in Barcelona. When the male line of Blanca’s family died out at the death of her uncle, Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, some of the Carlists recognized her as the legitimate heiress to the Spanish throne.\n\nQueen Mercedes helped build a new temple after the Church of Santa María de la Almudena was demolished in 1868.\n\nDeath\n\nShortly after their honeymoon, it became evident that Queen Mercedes suffered from typhoid fever. The marriage would last only six months, during which she reportedly had a miscarriage. She died due to the fever on June 26, 1878, just two days after her 18th birthday.\n\nWhen the King’s minister Cánovas del Castillo suggested that he take a new wife, King Alfonso XII acquiesced, choosing Mercedes’ sister Infanta María Cristina. For a few months he courted Infanta María Cristina, who was willing to replace her late sister, but it soon became clear that she was suffering from tuberculosis. Maria Cristina died at the age of 26 on April 28, 1879 in her native Seville\n\nIn late 1879, the King married Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen; a daughter of Archduke Charles Ferdinand of Austria (grandson of Emperor Leopold II) and his wife, Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria, the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).\n\nPalatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria, was the ninth child and seventh son of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, daughter of parents, King Carlos III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nThe eldest child, of King Alfonso XII and Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen was Infanta María de las Mercedes (1880 – 1904) was named in honour of Queen Mercedes. She was Princess of Asturias, the heir presumptive to the Crown of Spain, for all 24 years of her life.\n\nHad her younger sibling, unborn at the death of King Alfonso XII, been a daughter, Mercedes would have been Queen of Spain. The sibling proved to be a boy, King Alfonso XIII, a King upon his birth in 1886, and Mercedes turned out not to be queen.\n\nShe resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held until her own death, and was succeeded in it by her own infant son Prince Alfonso of the Two Sicilies, King Alfonso XIII having not yet married and fathered a legitimate child.\n\nMercedes married in Madrid on February 14, 1901, to her second cousin, Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a nephew of the King of the then-defunct Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, who was elevated to the rank of Infante of Spain. The marriage was highly controversial due to her father-in-law’s ties with the Carlists. She died three years later from complication while giving birth to her third child.\n\nAftermath\n\nAlthough the French won the day and prevented a British-backed suitor from becoming Spain’s King Consort, they and their moderado allies in Spain had to pressure the young queen into the marriage, as Infante Francisco, Duke of Cádiz was thought to be impotent.\n\nThe affair was a source of embarrassment for France. The rapprochement between Britain and France was wrecked, and Guizot sought allies instead among the reactionary Northern courts led by Metternich. This movement toward conservatism drove liberals from the ruling coalition in France, and contributed to the final end of the Orleanist monarchy in France two years later in the Revolution of 1848.\n\nBoth of the marriages proved to be unhappy ones.\n\nIn 1847, a major scandal took place when Queen Isabella II, age seventeen, publicly showed her love for General Serrano and her willingness to divorce her husband Francisco de Asís; though Narváez and Isabella’s mother Maria Christina solved the problem posed to the monarchical institution—Serrano was shifted away from the capital to the post of Captain General of Granada in 1848—, the deterioration of the public image of the queen increased from then on. Following the near-revolution of 1848, Narváez was authorised to rule as dictator to repress insurrectionary attempts up until 1849.\n\nIn late 1851, Isabella II gave birth to her first daughter and heir presumptive, who was baptised on December 21, as Infanta María Isabel Francisca de Asís. Historians have attributed the Princess of Asturias’ biological parenthood to José Ruiz de Arana, Gentilhombre de cámara.\n\nQueen Isabella II’s heir, Infante Alfonso de Asís, was born in Madrid on November 28, 1857. His official father, Isabella’s husband Francisco de Asís, has been generally viewed as effeminate, impotent or homosexual, leading historians to question his biological paternity.\n\nThere is speculation that Alfonso’s biological father may have been Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans, a captain of the guard. The relationship of the queen with Puigmoltó was so much of a public hearsay at the time that Francisco de Asís initially refused to attend the baptism ceremony of Alfonso (the heir apparent) even if he was eventually forced to do so.\n\nThese rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the Carlists, and he came to be widely nicknamed “Puigmoltejo” in reference to his supposed father. Others have assigned the fatherhood to Federico Puig Romero, a colonel who was murdered under unclear circumstances in 1866.\n\nIn order to protect their political position, the moderados moved to carry out the French-backed marriages, over Palmerston’s protestations, who insisted that the marriages were a breach of the 1712 Treaty of Utrecht.\n\nPalmerston’s efforts failed – on October 10, 1846, Queen Isabella’s 16th birthday, the Spanish Queen was married to her cousin, Infante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz, while her sister Luisa Fernanda was married to Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, her first cousin once removed, and the youngest son of King Louis-Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nInfante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz, was born at Aranjuez, Spain, the second son (first to survive infancy) of Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain, and of his wife (and niece), Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies. He was named after Saint Francis of Assisi.\n\nInfante Francisco de Paula of Spain was the youngest son of King Carlos IV of Spain and Princess Maria Luisa of Parma. He was a brother of King Fernando VII of Spain, Queen Isabella II’s father.\n\nInfante Francisco de Paula of Spain’s mother, Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies, was the eldest child of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies from his second wife, Infanta María Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma.\n\nThis means when Infante Francisco de Asís married Queen Isabella II of Spain, they were double first cousin.\n\nThere is evidence that Queen Isabella would rather have married his younger brother, Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, and complained bitterly about her husband’s effeminate habits after their first night together.\n\nInfanta María Luisa Fernanda of Spain, Duchess of Montpensier (1832 – 1897) was the younger daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his fourth wife and niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies.\n\nWhen her elder sister Queen Isabella II of Spain succeeded to the throne, Infanta Luisa Fernanda was heir presumptive to the crown between 1833 and 1851, when Isabella’s oldest surviving daughter was born.\n\nInfanta Luisa Fernanda, was only 14 years old, and Antoine, 22, had their nuptials on October 10, 1846 as a double wedding with Queen Isabella and Francisco, and young Antoine was elevated to the rank of an Infante of Spain. Infante Francisco became King Consort of Spain upon his marriage to the Queen. The couple moved to Paris and later to Sevilla. The relationship between Queen Isabella II and her sister was tense, due to Antoine’s conspiracies against the queen.\n\nDuring the Spanish revolution of 1868, Duke Antoine supported the insurgents under Juan Prim against Queen Isabel II, his own sister-in-law.\n\nIn 1870 he fought a duel against Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, the brother of King Francisco, and killed him. Antoine was convicted and sentenced to one month in prison.\n\nThe Affair of the Spanish Marriages was a series of intrigues between France, Spain, and Great Britain relating to the marriages of Queen Isabella II of Spain and her sister the infanta Luisa Fernanda in 1846.\n\nBritain and France took opposing roles with British foreign minister, Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, Lord Palmerston (later Prime Minister) as hostile to France. However France was successful in promoting a French husband for the Queen of Spain. The affair led to a deterioration of relations between France and Britain in the final years of the July Monarchy\n\nFrançois Guizot, the French foreign minister, had been a supporter of friendly relations with Britain and had served as France’s ambassador in London in 1840. During Guizot’s tenure in London, the two countries had been brought to the brink of war on the matter of the Syrian Question, before France’s king Louis-Philippe intervened to de-escalate the crisis.\n\nThe Syrian Question was actually the The Second Egyptian–Ottoman War which lasted from 1839 until 1841 and was fought mainly in Syria. It has sometimes been referred to as the Syrian War or Second Syrian War.\n\nThe war was the climax of the long power-struggle between the Ottoman Empire and the Pasha of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, which had reached a point of crisis that threatened to destabilize the whole of the Levant.\n\nThe second Soult government was formed in autumn of 1840 in France with Guizot as foreign minister, and Guizot set himself to the task of restoring friendly relationships with other European powers – including Britain – who had sided with the Ottoman Empire in the crisis. Guizot became a personal friend of the British foreign minister, Lord Aberdeen. Relations between Britain and France warmed significantly during the tenure of the Conservative Peel government.\n\nPeel and Aberdeen resigned from their posts in 1846 over disputes relating to the Corn Laws, where they were succeeded by a Liberal government led by Lord John Russell, with Lord Palmerston serving as foreign minister. Guizot’s relationships with this new government were strained at best – Palmerston had been Britain’s foreign minister during the Syrian crisis, and had directed an aggressive strategy to bolster the Ottoman Empire in direct contradiction to France’s designs. Palmerston’s reappointment as foreign minister in 1846 was seen in France as a threat.\n\nBritish fears of a union between the French and Spanish crowns were long-held; they had been central to the War of the Spanish Succession a century and a half earlier. Guizot, intent on rebuilding relations with Britain and his friend Lord Aberdeen in the early 1840s, had come to an understanding with his British counterpart that Isabella II, the Spanish Queen, would marry a Bourbon of the Spanish or Neapolitan branches, rather than a Bourbon of France.\n\nPalmerston rejected this understanding which had been made with his predecessor, and instead revived the suggestion of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry as a suitor.\n\nPrince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry (1824 – 1884) was a German Prince of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (the Koháry branch). He was the third son of Ferdinand, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya, the founders of the Koháry branch.\n\nLeopold was a younger son and was unlikely to inherit titles or land, so he entered the Army in the service of the Austrian Empire. At one point Leopold was considered as a potential husband for Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nThe House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was closely linked to the British Royal House of Hanover; Queen Victoria’s mother was born Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and her husband, since 1840, was her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nAnother Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, sister of Queen Victoria’s mother, Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent, married in 1816, Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of the Prince Regent (the future King George IV). Leopold and Charlotte’s marriage was happy, but it ended after a year and a half when Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in Britain.\n\nThe British had backed the candidature of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha when he was elected King of the Belgians in 1830, and although he had married King Louis-Philippe’s eldest daughter, Princess Louise of Orléans, the French were confronted with the possibility of facing a Britain-aligned dynasty on both of France’s northern and southern borders if Palmerston succeeded in his enterprise. Guizot therefore determined to adamantly oppose any Coburg marriages.\n\nThe affair connected also with the chaotic politics of mid-nineteenth century Spain. The French backed the ruling conservative moderados, while the British backed the opposition liberal progresistas, who desired to reinstate the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812.\n\nAlfonso XII (November 28, 1857 – November 25, 1885), also known as El Pacificador or the Peacemaker, was King of Spain from December 29, 1874 to his death in 1885.\n\nInfante Alfonso was born in Madrid as the eldest son of Queen Isabella II on November 28, 1857. His official father, Isabella’s husband Francisco de Asís, has been generally viewed as effeminate, impotent or homosexual, leading historians to question his biological paternity.\n\nThere is speculation that Alfonso’s biological father may have been Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans, a captain of the guard. The relationship of the queen with Puigmoltó was so much of a public hearsay at the time that Francisco de Asís initially refused to attend the baptism ceremony of Alfonso (the heir apparent) even if he was eventually forced to do so.\n\nThese rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the Carlists, and he came to be widely nicknamed “Puigmoltejo” in reference to his supposed father. Others have assigned the fatherhood to Federico Puig Romero, a colonel who was murdered under unclear circumstances in 1866.\n\nHis mother’s accession to the Spanish throne created the second cause of instability, the Carlist Wars.\n\nThe Carlist Wars were a series of civil wars that took place in Spain during the 19th century. The contenders fought over claims to the throne, although some political differences also existed.\n\nWhen King Fernando VII of Spain died in 1833, his widow, Queen Maria Cristina, became regent on behalf of their two-year-old daughter Queen Isabella II. The country splintered into two factions known as the Cristinos (or Isabelinos) and the Carlists. The Cristinos supported Queen Maria Cristina and her government, and were the party of the Liberals.\n\nThe Carlists advocated for Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina, a pretender to the throne and brother of the deceased Fernando VII. Carlos denied the validity of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830 that abolished the semi Salic Law (he was born before 1830). The Carlists wanted a return to autocratic monarchy.\n\nWhen Queen Isabella II and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the Revolution of 1868, Alfonso accompanied them to Paris. From there, he was sent to the Theresianum in Vienna to continue his studies.\n\nOn June 25, 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to those of the exiled queen. Alfonso assumed the name Alfonso XII, although no king of a united Spain had borne the name “Alfonso.”\n\nThe Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy of Asturias, León and Castile, which were represented by 11 kings also named Alfonso.\n\nAfter the Revolution deposed Isabella II, it was the Spanish Nobles who recognized Alfonso as the new King of Spain. However, it was the new Cortes which decided to reinstate the monarchy under a new dynasty.\n\nThe Cortes chose Prince Amadeo of Savoy, the Duke of Aosta as the new King. Prince Amadeo was a paternal descendant of King Felipe II of Spain through Tommaso Francesco of Savoy, Prince of Carignanohis, who was the grandson of King Felipe II of Spain through his daughter Infanta Catherine Michaela of Spain who had married Duke Carlo Emmanuel I of Savoy.\n\nPrince Amadeo was also a maternal descendant of King Carlos III of Spain through his daughter Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain who was the Holy Roman Empress, Queen of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia, Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Archduchess of Austria as the spouse of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThier son, Archduke Rainer of Austria, was Prince Amedeo’s grandfather as his daughter, Archduchess Adelaide of Austria was Queen of Sardinia by marriage to Vittorio Emmanuel II of Sardinia, future King of Italy. Archduchess Adelaide was the mother of Amedeo I of Spain but also the mother of Umberto I of Italy.\n\nThe Savoyard prince was elected king as Amadeo I on November 16, 1870 and swore to uphold the Constitution in Madrid on January 2, 1871.\n\nDuring a tumultuous reign, Amadeo was targeted by assassination attempts and struggled with opposition from both Carlists and republicans while his own faction split. After the Carlists revolted and the Third Carlist War broke out, he abdicated and returned to Italy in early 1873.\n\nFollowing Amadeo’s abandonment, the First Spanish Republic was established. The republicans had to contend with a war in Cuba and Muslim uprisings in Spanish Morocco.\n\nIn the midst of these crises, the Carlist War continued and the Carlist party made itself strong in areas with claims over such places as Catalonia and the Basque Country. This unrest led to the creation of a group in favour of the Bourbon Restoration, led by the moderate conservative Antonio Cánovas del Castillo."
