        "text": "HRH Infante Don Juan of Spain, Count of Barcelona, Juan Carlos Teresa Silvestre Alfonso de Borbï¿½n (June 20, 1913 - April 1, 1993), was the fourth son and designated heir of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, the monarch replaced by the Second Spanish Republic, and father of King Juan Carlos, under whom a constitutional monarchy would be restored.\n\nOn October 12, 1935, in Rome, he married Maria Mercedes Borbï¿½n y Orleans (also known as Doï¿½a Marï¿½a de las Mercedes de Borbï¿½n y Orleans or as HRH Princess Maria de las Mercedes Cristina Genara Isabel Luisa Carolina Victoria of Bourbon Two-Sicilies).\n\nAfter living in Rome, he moved his residence to Estoril, Portugal.\n\nHe was fond of the sea, and had tattoos of a marine theme from his time at the British Royal Navy.\n\nTo assert his claim to the throne, he used the title of Count of Barcelona, a sovereign title associated to the Spanish crown,\n\nWhen General Francisco Franco changed the form of government in Spain to a monarchy, he characterized it as a reinstitution, but passed over Don Juan, who would have been king if the monarchy had continued uninterrupted, in favor of his son, Juan Carlos.\n\nThe Count of Barcelona renounced his claim to the throne in 1977, forty-six years after Spain had been declared a republic, eight years after being deposed by Franco and two years after his son had become King Juan Carlos.\n\nHe is buried at the Royal Crypt of the monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial, near Madrid.\n\nSource: http://www.brainyencyclopedia.com/encyclopedia/j/ju/juan_de_borbon__count_of_barcelona.html"
