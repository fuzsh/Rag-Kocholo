        "text": "Select dimensions\n\nThe size of the margins surrounding the photos varies depending on the size of the original photo and the chosen size of the print.\n\nThe representation of the margins on the site is given as an example.\n\nThe photos whose original format is square, are printed on vertical sheets.\n\nSome images may not be available in large format prints due to the definition of the original photo.\n\nFor other formats or special requests, please contact us at\n\nSelect paper\n\nRC satin paper 250 grams\n\nThe photosensitive emulsion is coated on a polyethylene support called RC (Resin Coated) which makes this paper particularly resistant to handling and stable over time.\n\nThe print is made from the digital file on real silver photo paper. The Durst Lambda imager uses paper with silver emulsion. The transfer is made directly from the digital file, by exposing the photosensitive support with red, green, and blue laser beams. The paper is then developed in a chemical process, washed and dried. This technology guarantees very high-quality productions and a traditional photographic rendering.\n\nThe RC satin paper 230 grams is only available for the format 24 X 30 cm.\n\nHahnemühle baryta paper 315 grams\n\nThe baryta silver paper is a paper on a thick cardboard support, covered with a sensitive emulsion and a layer of barium sulfate (or baryte). It is this mineral which allows the whiteness of the paper and its exceptional durability.\n\nToday, paper manufacturers have adapted baryta paper into a modern digital version for inkjet printing. We have chosen the baryta of the legendary brand Hahnemühle.\n\nPermanence. The permanence of a process is its capacity to resist the progressive erasure of dyes or pigments on a given support, under determined exposure conditions: quality and quantity of light, humidity. For Hahnemühle 315 gram baryta paper, the estimated permanence, coming from the scientific research of the professional laboratory we work with, is 110 years..\n\nBlack & White Fine Art Pigment Inkjet Prints\n\nOur Black & White photographs benefit from a special treatment for printing on 315 grams baryta paper. They are printed on a new generation of Fine Art pigment inkjet printers, whose advanced Black & White management (ABW) allows to realize high quality photos with subtle gradations and an incomparable sharpness.\n\nThis true art print with very beautiful Black and White rendering allows to obtain a longevity and a richness of values which sublimate the photographs."
