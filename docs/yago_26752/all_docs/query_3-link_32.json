        "text": "I think it would be interesting to have a thread -I don't know if that has been done yet- about the sons and daughters of King Alfonso XIII. I guess there is few info about them, specially concerning their marriages and descendancy. I believe this would help us to know more about our spanish royal family and to understand \"the importance\" of people like Alessandro Lecquio in Spain.\n\nI would appreciate if you could post in this thread any info and photos you have regarding this topic.\n\nThank you a lot and congratulations on the work you are doing in the forums\n\nPrince Alfonso of Asturias\n\nThe eldest son of King Alfonso XIII and Queen Ena of Spain was Alfonso, named after his father. His birth was followed by huge celebrations as he was to be the heir of the Spanish Crown. Nevertheless, soon after, it was discovered that he was hemophilic and thus, he spent the majority of time in bed as his health was very weak. A light injury meant for him lots of time to recover from. It is said that, when King Alfonso XIII discovered his heir suffered from hemophilia he started to avoid Queen Ena as he blamed her for the illness of their son. This is in part true... we know women carry hemophilia but men suffer from it but King Alfonso XIII knew Ena was a potential carrier of the mentioned illness, so the \"separation\" from his wife is not, at all, coherent and logic.\n\nThe only surviving son of King Alfonso XIII is Leandro de Borbón Ruiz, bastard son of the King and an actress named Carmen Ruiz Moragas. He wrote a best seller book several years ago, and was recognized by the law as son of his father. There was no need of a DNA proof, because the King himself aknowlegded him as his son, helped him financially and took care of his education. Also, he looks like a true Borbón. He has some sons and daughters, with whom he seems not to have a good relationship, and lately some of them have been on the television speaking about their family matters.\n\nMaybe this can help. (I hope so)\n\nThe royal couple had seven children:\n\n-Alfonso Pío Cristino Eduardo (1907-1938) was born with haemophilia and renounced his rights to the throne in 1936 to marry with a plebeian. He was named Count of Covadonga.\n\n-Jaime Leopoldo Isabelino Enrique (1908-1975), who was deaf and dumb as consequence of an operation in his childhood, he also renounced his rights to the throne in 1933. He was named Duke of Segovia and later Duke of Madrid, and he was a candidate to get the throne of France from 1941 to 1975. He was known as Duke of Anjou.\n\n-Beatriz Isabel Federica Alfonsa Eugenia (1909-2002)\n\n-A child who was born dead (1910)\n\n-Maria Cristina Teresa Alejandra (1911-1996)\n\n-Juan Carlos Teresa Silvestre Alfonso (1913-1993) was named inheritor of the throne and Count of Barcelona.\n\n-Gonzalo Manuel Maria Bernardo (1914-1934), was born with haemophilia.\n\nThe king had also three children born out of his marriage:\n\n-Roger Lévesque de Vilmorin (1905-1980). His mother was the French aristocrat Melanie de Gaufridy de Dortan.\n\n-Leandro Alfonso Ruiz Moragas (he was born in 1929). He was recognized officially by the Spanish court on May 21, 2003 as Leandro Alfonso de Borbón Ruiz, son of the king.\n\n-His sister Ana Maria Teresa Ruiz Moragas. The mother of both Leandro and Ana was the Spanish actress Carmen Ruiz Moragas.\n\nhttp://www.elsemanaldigital.com/articulos.asp?idarticulo=36302\n\nLeandro de Borbón: \"the son of the Princes must be called Pelayo\"\n\nThe son ilegítimo of Alfonso XIII, in a visit to Real City, commented which it would like that it was the paper of the first son of Don Felipe and Doña Letizia, and of step it promoted his books.\n\n14 of August of 2005. The Leandro infant Alfonso de Borbón, whom two years ago recognized like biological son of the monarch Alfonso XIII, thinks that the unit of Spain is in danger and sees the new real sprout like a great solution.\n\nHe affirms that it would like that the son that waits for the princes called Pelayo and that with him the recovery of the unit of Spain could \"be initiated, that now seems is wanted to break\".\n\nIn a visit to promote the acts of the fairs and celebrations in honor to the Virgin of the Prado, that today begin in Real City, it has taken advantage of to promote its books the real bastard (2002) and Of bastard to infant of Spain (2004).\n\nLeandro de Borbón was sorry that this city is one of the few capitals that a street or an avenue with the name of its father does not tell on, offering itself to inaugurate the corresponding arrived plate the case.\n\n​\n\nAbout the question of haemophilia, the late great Spanish Historian Juan Balansó, hinted in one of his books, (I`m sorry I don't remember which of them as I am relying on my memory) that one of Infanta Beatriz's grandsons could have died from haemophilia on an early age. He was referring to Paul Alexandre Weiler, who died aged five in 1975. He was the son of Olimpia de Torlonia and Paul Annik Weiler.\n\nDoes anyone have more information about that and what other could have been the causes of the death of that five year old kid?\n\nMarcus said:\n\nAbout the question of haemophilia, the late great Spanish Historian Juan Balansó, hinted in one of his books, (I`m sorry I don't remember which of them as I am relying on my memory) that one of Infanta Beatriz's grandsons could have died from haemophilia on an early age.

I agree with you that it would be interesting to learn about the causes of the death of this boy. If I'm not mistaken, he was the brother of Sybille Weiller, who is currently married to a brother of the Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.\n\nIf this little boy died from haemophilia, that would mean that Infanta Beatriz transmitted the illness to her daughters and they may have transmitted it to their descendence. Infanta Beatriz had some boys too and one of them died but I don't know the cause. Infanta Cristina didn't have any boys if I'm not mistaken, she only had daughters... so they may also be a possibility that she transmitted to them haemophilia.\n\nIf anybody can bring some light to this topic, it's welcome. I also have to remind and ask for the collaboration about the info in this topic: any information, photos of King Alfonso's XIII sons and daughters is welcome.\n\nThanks to all of you"
