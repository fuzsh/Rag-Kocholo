        "text": "Infante Don Juan, third son of the late Alfonso XIII and heir to the inactive Spanish throne, let it be known last week that he was thinking of getting out his father’s robes and reopening the monarchy for business. The reports came from Bern, where the 30-year-old, British-trained Prince of the Asturias lives with his Bourbon-Sicily wife, Princess Maria Mercedes. Like startled pigeons, the several versions of the news rose, fluttered, settled back.\n\nMost sensational report came from the New York Times’s Bern bureau, headed by unreliable Daniel T. Brigham. He reported an accord reached “in principle” between Don Juan and Franco, said restoration was due “in the very near future.”\n\nThere was much incognito flitting. Ex-Queen Victoria Eugenie, granddaughter of the great Victoria and widow of Alfonso XIII, lives in England, was recently in Switzerland. Cousin Alfonso d’Orléans, onetime Ford worker, last week went from Switzerland to Madrid. Juan Ventosa, confidant of the late King, turned up in London early in June, reportedly saw Churchill. The Duke of Alba, Spanish Ambassador in London, put in a quiet appearance in Bern in the spring.\n\nThe reports and the journeyings could mean much or little, but if fat Franco was looking for a hedge against disaster, he could do worse than to court Don Juan. Today Franco has the power to place the heir upon the throne; tomorrow perhaps the new king would have the power to protect Loyal Subject Franco from the wrath which may sweep Spain in the wake of Hitler’s defeat."
