        "text": "WI Spain remained under the Habsburgs under one form or another through the 1700s, but never became Bourbon. The Habsburgs can be divided into Branches or reunified.\n\nHow does this all change the trajectory of Spanish America, and European geopolitics through the 1700s and beyond?\n\nIt would be interesting to say the least. The latest possibility (barring a Baltasar Carlos survives scenario) if for each of Felipe III's sons to wind up married. Or we have all of Felipe II's sons (by three different wives, he had six/seven all told (one by wife no. 1, one/some sources say two (both stillborn) by wife no. 3, and the rest by wife no. 4), but only one who survived). And if your POD is in the 1620s/1630s that can change a lot. Spain might (not saying it will) keep Portugal, for instance. Which means the Dutch keep Brasil and a couple other places (most likely)...\n\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nI can't begin to imagine what genetic horror show would come about from a Spanish Hapsburg line that lasted that long...\n\nNot really. I mean, if we look at how the Bourbons married for Spain it wasn't exactly much-better. I mean:\n\nFelipe V= Luisa Maria of Savoy (second cousin, heavily related to her on both sides)\n\nFelipe V= Isabel Farnese (reasonably distant relation - can't find closest relative)\n\nLuis I = Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans (first cousin once removed through her mother, second cousin through her father)\n\nFernando VI = Barbara of Portugal (same story as Isabel Farnese)\n\nCarlos III = Maria Amalie of Saxony (second cousin through their mothers)\n\nCarlos IV = Maira Luisa of Parma (first cousin through their fathers)\n\nFernando VII = Maria Antonia of Naples (first cousin through their fathers)\n\nFernando VII = Maria Isabel of Portugal (uncle, her mother, Carlota Joaquina is Fernando's sister)\n\nFernando VII = Maria Josefa of Saxony (more closely related through her Parmese mother and step-mother than through her father, but still cousin)\n\nFernando VII = Maria Cristina of the Two Sicilies (niece, her mother, Maria Isabel is Fernando's sister)\n\nIsabel II = Francisco d'Asis, duke of Cadix (double first cousin)\n\nAlfonso XII = Maria Mercedes d'Orléans-Montpensier (first cousin)\n\nAlfonso XII = Maria Christine of Austria-Teschen (reasonably distantly related)\n\nAnd let's not get started on the cadet lines in Naples and Parma that nearly always had at least one Bourbon-Borbon marriage per generation. All in all, I'd say that the Bourbons in the whole inbreeding thing, just got a lot luckier than the Habsburgs.\n\nBaltasar Carlos having a surviving brother (Fernando Francisco) would work. The two of them were reasonably less inbred (parents were second cousins, paternal grandparents second cousins, while maternal grandparents are pretty distantly related (think the closest common ancestor is way back in the de Foix ancestors of Anna of Hungary/Bohemia's mom IIRC) than the rest. Baltasar sets his brother up as ruler in Netherlands/Naples/wherever, and marries him to a suitably quasi-Habsburg wife, (Baltasar marries Maria Anna of Austria) and they have kids, the principle should be the same as all cadet lines descending from Felipe V.\n\nThere was no bad blood at all. In fact the regions that benefited the most from las leyes de la nueva planta were Catalans and Valencians. \"The bad blood\" thing is a modern myth created by Carlists and inherited by nationalists (that come from Carlism)\n\nIm by no means an expert on this question so you might be right. However why was it than that during the spanish war of sucession it was the Aragon territories and epecially Catalonia that fought the hardest against the Bourbons and one of the reasons was that Philipp already began his centralisation during the war. That sounds to me really like bad blood right at the beginning.\n\nAlso even if they benefited say economically there is bound to be a number of people who wont acknowledge that said economic growth was possible do to them becoming part of a big centralized nation and only focus on the part where they lost their independence etc. And there are always losers to every change. To summarize its is very hard for me to imagine that the dismantling of a kingdom didnt leave any resentment whatsoever.\n\nIm by no means an expert on this question so you might be right.

To summarize its is very hard for me to imagine that the dismantling of a kingdom didnt leave any resentment whatsoever.\n\nIt depended it on the town. It is a myth that it was a war between Castile and Aragon. And the ones who rebelled were the nobles which greatly benefited from their priviledges. The bulk of the catalan borgouis would be pretty liberal which was procentralization\n\nA lot of houses did a lot of inbreeding. Charles II was the poster child of what could go wrong, but in that era, he's really the only overwhelming example of such horrors. IF he'd never been born, it's highly likely most people would not jump to the freak show conclusion when talking about the Habsburgs.\n\nAs to what would happen, one can reasonably draw up plenty of TL's. The continuous line of Habsburgs could be competent and revive the fortunes of the Spanish Empire . for example, often it's mentioned that there would be no Bourbon Reforms. Maybe, or maybe they would be called the Habsburg Reforms, and they could have come earlier. Or you can write your TL that the continuous line are idiots who crash Spain. one huge butterfly is that merely knowing there is a continuous line of Habsburg succession (say Charles II was born with working testicles and had offspring) changes the waning decades of the 17th century. OTL, everyone within and without Spain was girding for a disrupted succession. Within Spain business was run to suck as much personal gain as possible while the grabbing was good. Without, everyone was jockeying for lining up at the trough to get their share of the spoils. The 9 years war was wound down with an eye to prepping for the coming succession struggle.\n\nWhat would be a cool idea IMO: Baltasar Carlos/Felipe III/whoever divvies his empire up - one brother/son gets the kingdom of Naples, one gets a crown in the Low Countries and he keeps the Spanish-Portuguese thrones for himself. Then, shit hits the fan when the main throne - Spain-Portugal - gets inherited by another dynasty (could be due to differing succession laws, could just be because the other house is married to the eldest sister/daughter of the last Spanish king. So we get Spanish Habsburg sidelines in Brussels and Naples, but they've lost Madrid and the Americas...\n\n. Among other things, France and Prussia might stay more cordial and Austria and Britain probably stay more aligned in their anti-French interests. And if the Austrian Habsburgs die out as they did OTL, then that makes matters even messier.\n\nIf Austrian Habsburgs die Spanish branch would replace them (unless it is only one male Habsburg left at the time of Austrian branch extinction). It would be easier than other way around because of Salic Law. Male-line Habsburg would be undisputed heir to Austria, not like in Spain which allowed female line inheritance which allowed Burbons to take Spanish throne when Habsburg line still existed.\n\nA Hapsburg Spain would have some real revenue problems and lots of corruption. IOTL, the Bourbons solved it through centralization and turning the American kingdoms into de facto colonies. I'm not sure what the Hapsburgs would do about it.\n\nHow do you figure?\n\nThere were rather strong parliaments under Spanish rule due to in large part its decentralization, though I don't see how they were all merging into a single one. Spain wouldn't be a parliamentary monarchy so much as many parliamentary monarchies in personal union with one another, with the American kingdoms increasingly trading with Britain."
