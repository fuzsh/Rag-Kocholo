During the subsequent procession, a bomb was thrown at the carriage, narrowly missing, and killing 23 people. The King and Queen had seven children, but two of their four sons had hemophilia, which she inherited from Queen Victoria, which, coupled with his various mistresses and illegitimate children, led to the breakup of their marriage. The Spanish monarchy was abolished in 1931, and though he didn’t abdicate, the King left Spain for exile, settling in Rome, where he passed in 1941. Queen Ena settled in Switzerland and died in 1969. The Spanish Monarchy was restored under their grandson, King Juan Carlos, in 1975."
