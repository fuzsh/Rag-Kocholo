        "text": "King Alfonso XII of Spain\n\nIn examining the lineage of King Alfonso XII of Spain I mentioned that most of us commoners have eight unrelated great-grandparents. Alfonso XII only had four great-grandparents, and even then they were all from the House of Bourbon. These four individuals were his paternal great-grandparents as we have seen:\n\nCarlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain\n\nIn examining his maternal great-grandparents we find these same four individuals:\n\nCarlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain\n\nThe difference of course is in who their children were and whom they were married to. For example, paternally Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma had Infante Francisco de Paula, Duke of Cádiz who married his niece Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies daughter of Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain.\n\nHowever, on Alfonso XII’s maternal side, Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma had King Fernando VII of Spain who married, as his fourth wife his, niece Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, (her mother wife, Maria Isabella of Spain’s older brother).\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies\n\nTherefore, maternally, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, parents were of Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain.\n\nThis means that these two sisters of the House of Bourbon-Two Siclies (below) each married their uncles (who were brothers) of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon.\n\n* Luisa Carlotta (1804–1844), who married her mother’s younger brother Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain.\n\n* María Cristina (1806–1878), who married firstly her uncle Ferdinand VII of Spain (her mother’s older brother);\n\nThey were King Alfonso XII’s grand parents.\n\nHis paternal grand parents were Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies and they were the parents of King Alfonso XII’s father…Infante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz.\n\nFrancisco married Queen Isabella II of Spain, his double first cousin, on October 10, 1846. There is evidence that Isabella would rather have married his younger brother, Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, and complained bitterly about her husband’s effeminate habits after their first night together.\n\nInfante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz\n\nAlfonso XII’s maternal grandparents (his maternal side is where he derived his claim to the throne) were King Fernando VII of Spain Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies and they were the parents of his mother, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nIsabella II, was Queen of Spain from 1833 until 1868. She came to the throne as an infant, but her succession was disputed by the Carlists, whose refusal to recognize a female sovereign led to the Carlist Wars. After a troubled reign, she was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1868, and formally abdicated in 1870. Her son, Alfonso XII, became king in 1874.\n\nIsabella II, was Queen of Spain"
