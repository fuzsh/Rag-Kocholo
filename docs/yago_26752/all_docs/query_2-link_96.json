        "text": "On 31 May 1906 King Alfonso XIII of Spain married princess Victoria Eugenia (Ena) of Battenberg, the daughter of Princess Beatrie of the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\nAfter the wedding ceremony, the royal procession was heading back to the Royal Palace when an assassination attempt was made on the King and his new consort (now called \"Queen Victoria Eugenia\" or, less formally, \"Queen Ena\"). Anarchist Mateu Morral threw a bomb from a balcony at the royal carriage. Ena's life was saved because, at the exact moment the bomb exploded, she turned her head in order to see St. Mary's Church, which Alfonso was showing her. She escaped injury, although her dress was spotted with the blood of a guard who was riding beside the carriage.\n\n==\n\ncopyrights expired\n\nI've never seen a close up of Ena's wedding dress before. Thanks for posting that.\n\nI'm curious if anyone knows what those photos were taken for? Was the dress on display before the wedding? Does anyone know whatever became of the wedding dress. Just wondering if any attempt was made at having it cleaned, or if it was just left as was after the explosion.\n\nIt took quite a lot of effort for Victoria-Eugenie to be the royal bride.\n\nKing Alfonso had previously considered Princess Victoria Patricia of Connaught as a spouse.\n\nVictoria-Eugenie had to convert to Roman Catholicism.\n\nAlfonso's mother viewed her as a non-royal.\n\nKing Edward VII raised his niece's status to that of Her Royal Highness.\n\n​\n\nIt took quite a lot of effort for Victoria-Eugenie to be the royal bride.\n\nKing Alfonso had previously considered Princess Victoria Patricia of Connaught as a spouse.\n\nVictoria-Eugenie had to convert to Roman Catholicism.\n\nAlfonso's mother viewed her as a non-royal.\n\nKing Edward VII raised his niece's status to that of Her Royal Highness.\n\n​\n\nWell in all honesty, Victoria Eugenie was the product of a morganatic marriage. But worse was that she was a carrier for Hemophilia and Alfonso was warned about that, but didn’t listen to that.\n\nMoments later there was an assassination attempt,the second one in 12 months on the king.\n\nI already know about the ugly reality of political assassination.\n\nBut to murder(or attempt to murder) a person on their wedding day takes someone truly soul dead imho.\n\nI already know about the ugly reality of political assassination.\n\nBur to murder(or attempt to murder) a person on their wedding day takes someone truly soul dead imho.\n\nSpain was and had been politically volatile for a long time. When people seek to change something they don’t care how they do it."
