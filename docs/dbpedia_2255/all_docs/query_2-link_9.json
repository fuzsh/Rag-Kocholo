        "text": "You became an Angel this year (congratulations!) - how did that\n\nfeel? Where were you when you found out and how did you react?\n\nWhat's the best thing about being an Angel?\n\nI was so excited that I cried! Tears of happiness, of course. I was shooting an editorial in Mexico and the team thought something bad had happened when they saw me crying… It was the opposite! I'm still pinching myself. The best part of all is being able to have an even deeper connection with my VS family.\n\nRead more: Lais Ribeiro: Catwalk CV\n\nYou used to do a lot of catwalk, but have\n\nscaled back in recent years and are doing much more editorial - why\n\nis that? Is it a conscious decision?\n\nWalking in shows is so great. It's such a privilege to be the first to see each designer's collection before the editors and the public. I enjoy it all… shows, advertising, editorial - but there's only one of me so I can't be in two places at one time.\n\nYour seven-year-old son Alexandre must be\n\nbeginning to understand more clearly what you do for a living. Do\n\nyou talk to him about your job?\n\nHe actually doesn't really know what I do. When my Self story came out, he saw the pictures and asked if it was me… I said it was me and that it's my job and he replied, 'What? Are you famous or something?'\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMany models who have become mothers while\n\nyoung - Jourdan Dunn for example - have talked about how much more\n\nit motivates them to achieve and succeed in their career. Has that\n\nbeen the same for you? What else has it changed?\n\nHaving a child changes everything, obviously. Yes, it's motivated me more to be the best person I can be and to be a true role model for him.\n\nHave you spent much time with the other\n\nAngels since you were all confirmed? Are there friends of yours\n\namong the group?\n\nI've been shooting for VS for quite some time so over the years, I've built deep friendships with a love of the most recent Angels. I've always looked up to Adriana and Alessandra. I've also become very close to Behati, Candice and Jac because we've spent the most time together.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThere are lots of Brazilians among the VS\n\ngroup - seven including you in the last show - is it nice to have\n\nyour fellow Brazilians around you? What do they understand about\n\nyou that other nationalities might not?\n\nBrazilians share a love for great food. Besides a common language, Adriana, Isabeli, and Alessandra and I share a bond as mothers.\n\nYou are the only model who has ever been\n\nconfirmed for a VS show and then pulled out on the day due to\n\ninjury - how did you feel that day?\n\nThat was a devastating experience, but I was so honoured to be included in the video the following year. I was touched by how kindly my VS family handled it and honoured that I was featured in such a beautiful manner.\n\nWhat do you like to do when you're not at work? Where are you\n\nbased most of the time?\n\nI'm based in NYC but travel all over the world. I'm never in the same place each week! When I'm not working, I usually spend most of my time with my son.\n\nIf you could talk to your 10-year-old self\n\nwhat would you tell her? Did she think she'd be a full-time model\n\none day?\n\nIf I could talk to my 10-year-old self I would tell her to love herself, and keep up the hard work. My focus at the time was on school, my dream was to study medicine. I have been so blessed.\n\nWhat's the best lesson you've learned from working in the\n\nfashion industry?\n\nThe best lesson I have learned is to never underestimate myself.\n\nRead more: Victoria's Secret Angels In Vogue\n\nLais Ribeiro is the face of Bottletop, for more information on the brand and its aims visit Bottletop.org"
