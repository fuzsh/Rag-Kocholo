        "text": "Say hello to Unfiltered, a fresh, new beauty series where you'll get an exclusive glimpse into the dressed-down beauty routines of our favorite celebrities. They'll reveal their guilty-pleasure beauty practices, the five-minute routine product lineup they can't live without, the one good-skin tip they'll be forever thankful for, and so much more. To bring every conversation full circle, we ask each celebrity to send us a selection of self-shot, filter-free photos of their choosing to capture the essence of their Unfiltered beauty philosophy.\n\nThis month, we're excited for you to get to know Brazilian model Lais Ribeiro. As a fellow skincare enthusiast and product junkie, she's answering all of our rapid-fire questions and sharing her best-kept beauty secrets below. Enjoy!\n\nIf you had to leave the house in five minutes, what products would you use?\n\nI would use my Bobbi Brown Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation SPF 15 ($42), Charlotte Tilbury Cheek To Chic Blush ($40), Maybelline Great Lash Mascara ($7), and Bite Beauty Agave+ Daytime Vegan Lip Balm ($14).\n\nOn days when you’re not working or you’re just staying in, what does your skin routine look like both morning and night?\n\nIn the morning, I always wash my face. Lately, I've been using the Fresh Soy Face Cleanser ($15), and I’ll follow that with the Facial Treatment Essence ($235) from SK-II. Next comes Dr. Barbara Sturm's Darker Skin Tones Hyaluronic Serum ($300), and I finish it all off with Supergoop!'s Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 ($38).\n\nAt night, I keep it really simple. I remove my makeup with Neutrogena's Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes ($7), wash my face again with the same cleanser from Fresh, and then use IS Clinical's Reparative Moisture Emulsion ($95).\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received that’s made the biggest difference in your skin?\n\nThat it’s all about hydration! Even on days when I’m really tired, I make sure that, at the very least, I wash my face and put on a hydrating moisturizer.\n\nIf we looked in your bath or shower right now, what would we find? Do you have any prized bodycare obsessions?\n\nI’m pretty simple in the shower. I love using shampoo and conditioner from Pantene and then anything Dove for my body. Occasionally, I'll use a body oil but only when I'm feeling extra dry.\n\nWhat are the biggest ways Brazilian beauty differs from American beauty? How have you kept or incorporated aspects of each into your beauty aesthetic?\n\nI think Brazilians have a much more simple approach to makeup, in particular. Growing up, I spent most of my time outside or at the beach, so any makeup I'd put on would be very minimal. Because of that, I usually gravitate toward soft, glam looks, but every once in a while, I like to switch it up with a bold eye or lip.\n\nWhat about hair? Do you have any ride-or-die styling tips or products?\n\nMy hair routine is very simple—I deep condition weekly, and I usually just leave it down so my hair can breathe. I don’t like to style my hair too much myself!\n\nAre there any beauty trends or practices you don’t buy into or that you feel aren’t worth it?\n\nI’m not a big fan of the peel-off masks. I think that can do more damage than good to your skin.\n\nWhat’s one thing about your beauty routine that would surprise people?\n\nWell, while we're on the topic of masks, I actually love to use honey as a face mask!\n\nDo you have any \"guilty pleasure” beauty secrets?\n\nI know it’s so bad… But sometimes, I pop pimples!\n\nWhat about wellness? Health and beauty are so intertwined—do you have any tips that make you feel your best inside and out?\n\nI would say my health and wellness routine is a big part of my beauty routine. For me, beauty starts from within and what you put into your body. I’m always drinking a lot of water and making sure I’m eating healthy, but I also love staying active so I can sweat out any toxins in my body.\n\nAs you transition from your 20s to your 30s, what’s your approach to aging? How do you see your routine changing (if at all) in terms of products or treatments, and what are you most excited about as you enter this next decade?\n\nI’m not afraid of aging. I think the transition from my 20s into my 30s has been one of a lot of personal and professional growth, which has given me a lot more confidence. I used to be afraid of oils and adding too much moisture to my skin, but now, I embrace it! I know it is what will keep my skin balanced and dewy long-term.\n\nWhat’s your Unfiltered beauty philosophy in seven words or less?\n\nBeauty starts from within.\n\nShop Lais's Unfiltered Beauty Edit"
