        "text": "Lais Ribeiro, Fashion Model & Influencer Graces The Cover of The Inaurgural Issue.\n\nLifestyles South Florida Magazine is changing the way we present luxury. Bold and brilliant, this luxurious quarterly publication has nestled within its pages the defining trends within the luxury space. Everything from where to travel, what to wear, and how to get there, this beautifully re-envisioned piece is set to become the premier luxury lifestyle piece for those living in South Florida and The Hamptons.\n\nThe cover star, Lais Ribeiro, is a new Miami resident and is most known for her triumphs as a fashion model and influencer on social media. Shot on location at 3681 Flamingo Drive in Miami Beach, which is currently listed with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, Lais was photographed wearing stunning designer fashion from the likes of Carolina Herrera, Danny Santiago, Balmain, and more.\n\nA special feature on Donna Karan showcases the prolific designer’s shift into a new, Balinese-inspired home decor and fashion line, and how, amidst a changing world, she is encouraging that more good is done for those in need. The designer, who sold her companies Donna Karan Collection and DKNY to LVMH, which is also known as Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey, for the sum of $643 million over 20 years ago, is now making herself a new kind of icon within the fashion and lifestyle industries. Urban Zen is her new fashion line, and you can browse the available collection at UrbanZen.com.\n\nAlthough filled with bold and unique content, a luxury lifestyle magazine must offer prized real estate. Within the pages of Lifestyle South Florida, you will discover some of the most unique real estate presented by Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty’s elite Associates."
