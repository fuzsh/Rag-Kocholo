        "text": "CRISTINA NITOPI INTRODUCES A COLLECTION\n\nDRIVEN BY THE INFLUENCE OF COLOR\n\nNEW YORK, NY – September 12, 2022 - Designer Cristina Nitopi once again returns to\n\nNYFW to present her latest SS23 collection featuring model, Lais Ribeiro (a Brazilian\n\nmodel most known for her work as a Victoria Secret Angel), photographed by celebrity\n\nphotographer Jason MacDonald.\n\nIn her collection, Nitopi noted that she was “Inspired by colors and the power behind\n\nthem.” As a true artist, the designer understood that a collection, aside from prestige\n\nrenowned tailoring, had the power to also instill genuine connection through the use of\n\ncolor.\n\n“Colors have various frequencies that can energize us, introduce a sense of calmness, and\n\njust alter our perception of things” Nitopi notes. “As an artist, understanding the psychology\n\nof color allows each piece to establish an emotional connection with everyone - that is why I\n\nwanted to have color be the theme this season. To allow people to connect with my collection,\n\nsimilar to how I do when I create it.”\n\nBy introducing bold, eye catching colors in Yellow, Pink and Turquoise, Nitopi allowed her\n\nguests to connect with an uplifting and optimistic feeling. This is the same feeling found within\n\nthe seasons, with Spring evoking a feeling of hope, and Summer instilling Joy. Nitopi then\n\npaired these bright selections with hints of grey and silver; one of the most powerful shades\n\nand a prominent member of the color wheel, ultimately representing hope, and unconditional\n\nlove.\n\nBut beyond the color, we can not shy away from the expertise and distinctive tailoring found\n\nthrough every piece of her ready-to-wear line shown this season. Offering crisp tailored\n\npants and similar silhouette shorts, both meant to hug each curve, and made in brushed\n\nlinen. Nitopi then paired them with both romantic and edgier pieces made of silk and lace,\n\nultimately presenting between calm and chaos – similar to those emotions felt when exiting\n\nwinter and entering into a brighter Spring &amp; Summer season.\n\nWith textural elements of movement, created through lace draping’s and architectural\n\ndesign – the cropped lace tops offered a harmonic balance within each look created. From\n\noff shoulder pieces to twist detailing panels, each piece embraced it’s own expression.\n\nThe showstopper pieces, however, were found within her quilted tops; offering more of an\n\nabstract presentation, with flirty peek-a-boo inserts throughout for a unique take on cut-\n\nouts. These pieces from the collection, offered a unique and fresh perspective in the use of\n\nstructure, taking elements of a couture-level approach that is both luxe and flirty.\n\nWith plenty of highlights from this show, it’s clear that it’s never too early to start listing\n\ndefinitive trends found within NYFW.\n\nWe can’t wait to see what the designer will be coming out with next.\n\nMake sure to follow her at:\n\n@cristinanitopi\n\nhttp://cristinanitopi.com\n\nABOUT THE DESIGNER\n\nCristina Nitopi was born in Sydney, Australia, on March 12, 1982.\n\ndesign with style.\n\nmotivated her to self- study fashion and to launch her own fashion label in 2007, at New York\n\nFashion Week.\n\nWith each collection you can observe the designer&#39;s Italian heritage and appreciate the\n\nuniqueness and craftmanship.\n\nCREDITS :\n\nDESIGNER : Cristina Nitopi @cristinanitopi\n\nMODEL : Lais Ribeiro @laisribeiro"
