        "text": "Julia Roberts - 5'9 (175 cm)\n\nJulia Roberts became Hollywood's sweetheart after headlining in the cult-classic rom-com \"Pretty Woman\" in 1990.\n\nThis 5'9'' Hollywood veteran has won three (!) Golden Globe Awards and an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in \"Erin Brockovich.\"\n\nKate Grigorieva - 5'11\" (182 cm)\n\nYekaterina Sergeyevna Grigoryeva (kind of a mouth full), more famously known as Kate Grigorieva, is a Russian model that made it big in the U.S. as one of the beloved Victoria's Secret Angels between 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe blue-eyed beauty is 5'11'' tall, and she participated in many beauty pageants at the beginning of her career. Fun fact: she won second place in the Russian adaptation of Tyra Banks' \"America's Next Top Model.\"\n\nKristen Johnston - 6'1'' (185 cm)\n\nKristen Johnston rose to fame when she played Sally on the sitcom, \"3rd Rock from the Sun,\" for which she won not one, but two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nDespite her accomplishments, her life wasn't easy growing up, and she struggled with low self-esteem issues. And believe it or not, her height played a factor. She has been quoted saying how in high school, she often felt \"enormous, a monstrosity, a freak.\"\n\nLiv Tyler - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nLiv Tyler not only inherited her rock star dad's, Steven Tyler's, good looks, but she is exactly the same height as him as well! They both stand 5'10'' tall.\n\nThe actress started her modeling career at the early age of 14 but quickly transitioned into acting, where she has found even greater success and satisfaction. One of our favorite roles is when she portrayed Arwen Undómiel in the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\n\nFamke Janssen - 6'0'' (183 cm)\n\nDutch actress Famke Janssen not only has incredible height, but apparently, she also has incredibly large feet! The star has to get special custom-made shoes for size 11 feet.\n\nFamke's most memorable performances include hit films and TV shows like the \"Taken\" trilogy, \"Hemlock Grove,\" \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" and \"The Blacklist: Redemption.\"\n\nMandy Moore - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nSinger-songwriter and actress Mandy Moore is another lady on our list who wasn't always confident about her tall stature but is now a proud member of the tall women's club.\n\nIn 2005, Moore launched a fashion line called Mblem, which aimed to create clothes for tall girls and women. She also starred in the hugely successful NBC drama, \"This Is Us,\" and was even nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Emmy.\n\nRebecca Romijn - 5'11\" (180 cm)\n\nActress and model Rebecca Romijn apparently suffered her share of health issues when she was younger due to her height. She suffered from scoliosis, which would often cause her intense pains after a growth spurt.\n\nBut luckily, today, she is way past her growth spurt. With her height, looks, and work ethic, Romijn has built a very successful career!\n\nTyra Banks - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nTyra Banks began her career as a 5’10'' 15-year-old! After she was booked for her 24th show at her very first Paris Fashion week, it was pretty clear that she was on her way to stardom.\n\nAfter a very successful modeling career, Tyra went on to create and host the wildly successful reality show \"America's Next Top Model.\" Later she hosted her own talk show, \"The Tyra Banks Show.\"\n\nElle Macpherson - 6'0'' (183 cm)\n\nAustralian supermodel, Elle Macpherson, is known for her record number of cover appearances on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issues since the beginning of the 1980s.\n\nWhile millions of people drooled over her figure, she wasn't such a fan and said that she hated that she was 6 feet and would lie, saying she was 5-foot-12.\n\nKatie Holmes - 5'9 (175 cm)\n\nKatie Holmes was 5 inches taller than her ex-hubby Tom Cruise, whom she was married to from 2006 to 2012.\n\nHer most notable role was in the television series \"Dawson's Creek.\" Later, Holmes made a transition to film, where she has achieved success.\n\nNicole Kidman - 5'11 (180 cm)\n\nThe Australian veteran actress has become one of the most recognizable faces in the entertainment industry. You probably have noticed how she towers over her husband, Keith Urban — that's because she's a tall lady!\n\nShe wears her height proudly and can often be seen on the red carpet wearing heels.\n\nKarolina Kurkova - 5'11\" (180 cm)\n\nThe beautiful Czech model, Karolina Kurkova, is 5'11'' and said that she was bullied for being the tallest among her classmates.\n\nBut her height is what landed her a modeling contract at 15! This former Victoria's Secret Angel has been on the covers of major fashion publications like Vogue.\n\nIrina Shayk - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nRussian supermodel Irina Shayk, 5’10, made her way to American publications after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated back in 2011.\n\nIn fact, Shayk was the first Russian model to grace the cover of the popular magazine.\n\nKate Middleton - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nUK's sweetheart, Princess Kate Middleton, was destined to one day become a royal from her modest-yet-impressive style to her powerful stature. At 5’10'', she is still five inches shorter than her husband, Prince William.\n\nBesides her philanthropic work, the Princess is also an influential fashion icon. In fact, her impact on trends is called the \"Kate Middleton effect.\"\n\nDot-Marie Jones - 6'3\" (190 cm)\n\n6'3\" Dot-Marie Jones is a former athlete turned actress, widely known for her role as Coach Beiste on the musical TV show \"Glee.\"\n\nBefore hitting the big screen, Jones, an accomplished athlete, was a track runner, weight lifter, and shot putter, and is a 15-time world arm-wrestling champion!\n\nGal Gadot - 5'10 (178 cm)\n\nThe Israeli model and actress Gal Gadot rose to fame in the U.S. after playing the DC Comics superhero, Wonder Woman.\n\nBefore that, Gadot's first international film role was when she portrayed Gisele Yashar in \"Fast & Furious,\" a performance that got her reprised in two additional films in the franchise.\n\nNatasha Henstridge - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nCanadian actress Natasha Henstridgeis best known for her roles in \"The Whole Nine Yards,\" \"Species,\" and \"Ghosts of Mars.\"\n\nShe once said in an interview how there are more short male actors in the industry than we realize. Many times, they had to try to camouflage the height difference between her and shorter actors.\n\nBehati Prinsloo - 5’10\" (178 cm)\n\nBehati Prinsloo, another Victoria's Secret Angel on our list, is 5'10'' tall. She also happens to be married to pop star Adam Levin.\n\nEven after giving birth to two children, she shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, Prinsloo is at the height of her modeling career, with quite a following.\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal - 5'9\" (175 cm)\n\nFor some odd reason, Maggie Gyllenhaal comes across as one of the petite Hollywood actresses, but the award-winning actress — and older sister to Jake Gyllenhaal (FYI) — is actually 5'9''.\n\nShe has appeared in several critically acclaimed productions, including \"Donnie Darko,\" Mona Lisa Smile,\" and \"Dark Knight.\" She also won a Golden Globe for her lead performance in the BBC series \"The Honourable Woman.\"\n\nAnjelica Huston - 5'10 (178 cm)\n\nAnjelica Huston is an Academy Award-winning actress who stands 5'10'' tall and proud.\n\nHere is a fun story about this talent: Huston became the third-generation Oscar winner of her family when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in \"Prizzi's Honor\" (1985). She joined her father, the late John Huston (director), and her grandfather, the late Walter Huston (actor).\n\nMartha Hunt - 5’11 (180 cm)\n\nMartha Hunt can often be seen beside her bestie of similar stature, Taylor Swift. She also happens to be one of the most successful models today, working with brands like Louis Vuitton, Versace, and Prada.\n\nHunt suffered from Scoliosis when she was younger, a problem common among tall people, which has left her with multiple surgical scars, but luckily it wasn't enough to stop her from becoming a top model. Good for her!\n\nKarlie Kloss - 6'1'' (185 cm)\n\nKarlie Klos is 6'1'', which is probably why you'd be hard-pressed to find her in high heels when she's not on the runway.\n\nShe once told People, \"I think I would look like a crazy woman walking around NYC in heels since I’m 6’1 and 6’4 in heels. Plus, I take the subway, so I’d stand out even more!\" Would you be hesitant to wear heels if you were her height?\n\nElizabeth Debicki - 6'2\" (188 cm)\n\nAustralian actress Elizabeth Debicki who is 6'2'', told The Daily Mail in 2016 that it's nothing out of the norm in her family...\n\n\"My younger sister is also very tall and my little brother, who is just 17, is 6ft 6in, so we're the Amazonian Family. As a teenager, I wasn't comfortable with being taller than other people, and I'm sure I stooped a lot.\"\n\nJenna Elfman - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nThe glamorously quirky actress, Jenna Elfman, is best known for starring in the beloved sitcom \"Dharma & Greg.\"\n\nThe casting crew made a clever decision when they cast Thomas Gibson, who is 6’2'', as her on-screen husband.\n\nSerena Williams - 5'9 (175 cm)\n\nSerena Williams, with a total of 23 Grand Slam singles titles under her belt, is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Coolidge has starred in \"American Pie,\" \"2 Broke Girls,\" and \"A Cinderella Story\" alongside Hilary Duff. Coolidge is best known for comedic roles, but she actually always dreamed of taking on more serious and dramatic roles while at college. She got to fulfill this dream when she was cast as Tanya in \"The White Lotus\" — a role which ultimately won her an Emmy and a Golden Globe!\n\nFun fact: Coolidge spent some time waitressing in New York (as is a right of passage in Hollywood), and worked alongside fellow soon-to-be-famous actress Sandra Bullock.\n\nMinnie Driver - 5'10\" (178 cm)\n\nMinnie Driver is a beloved British actress who has starred in hits like \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Good Will Hunting.\" Driver even received an Academy Award nomination for her role in \"Good Will Hunting\" in 1997. Despite her name, there's nothing \"mini\" about her. This British bombshell has been making heads turn for years, no doubt helped by the fact she is 5'10\" tall and knows how to command attention.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Good Will Hunting,\" there was plenty of hype that surrounded the actress. She wasn’t able to live up to it, though, and has never really established herself as a household name.\n\nLauren Graham - 5'9\" (175 cm)\n\nLauren Graham played the (very) young mom, Lorelai, on the hit show \"Gilmore Girls\" but that's far from being the only thing she's done. Her film creds include \"Sweet November,\" \"Bad Santa,\" \"The Pacifier,\" \"Because I Said So,\" and \"Evan Almighty.\" Her television roles have had the same major influence on her career, like her major role in the show \"Parenthood.\"\n\nLauren also reprised her role as Lorelai in the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival season, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Graham is one of Hollywood's taller actresses at 5'9\" — something you could see clearly enough when Graham stands next to her castmates.\n\nCamila Alves - 5'9\" (175 cm)\n\nShe's best known for being the wife of Hollywood heartthrob Matthew McConaughey, but Camila Alves had already made a name for herself before her marriage in 2012. Alves is a Brazillian model, which makes sense given that she's 5'9\" tall.\n\nShe was a brand ambassador for Macy's, but largely featured in editorials. Alves is also an entrepreneur, having started her own lifestyle website and co-owning an organic food company. Another impressive project of hers is the children's book she has co-authored with Adam Mansbach. Titled \"Just Try One Bite\", it was published in 2022 and became a New York Times bestseller."
