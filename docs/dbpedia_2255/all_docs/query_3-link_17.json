        "text": "She's 25-year-old. She's mother of a 8-year-old boy. In 2010 she made her first appearance in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. 6 months ago, in April, she officially became an Angel. Since she was discovered at 19 she has walked down the runway of the most prestigious brands such as Chanel, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Versace, Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, Christian Dior, Michael Kors and Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nShe's Lais Ribeiro. The gorgeous Brazilian model who is gonna make her debut as a Victoria's Secret Angel during the annual show in New York tomorrow, November 10th 2015.\n\nNow that her big moment approaching and she's clearly on the top of her career, Lais opens up about her childhood memories and about how long it takes, and obviously how hard you have to work, to become a supermodel, exclusively here on Vogue.it.\n\nYou were born in Teresina, Brazil. What are your childhood memories?\n\nMy childhood was of a girl from a small town...I was born in Miguel Alves, that is in the state of Piauí. It has just over 30,000 inhabitants.I used to play with my friends, study in the morning...everyone knew everyone!I always loved running, be out playing...\n\nYou've been discovered thanks to a national competition. Tell us everything about your early career at the beginning.\n\nI did not plan to be a model...I was studying to be a nurse, until I was encouraged by a friend to try. Then it all started...I did some work in my city and in nearby regions. After that I participated in the contest JOY Model Brazil. I was among the finalists, I moved to São Paulo, and soon after began to travel...and here I am! lol\n\nWhen you started, who were the models that you looked at for inspiration?\n\nI have a special admiration for Adriana Lima, who became a friend. I like people who have positive energy and humility.\n\nHow did you feel when did you know you officially become an Angel?\n\nI was thrilled! My manager called me to break the news, and I was in a job. I started to cry! People asked what had happened, and I still could not tell what it was...lol. It was a mixture of joy with excitement and recognition\n\nIn which ways your life has changed since then?\n\nThis recognition of the work motivates me. Fills me with energy and encourages me to move on. It's like a fuel that moves you.My son and my mother live with me today in New York. This undoubtedly was the most important change!\n\nVictoria's Secret most famous claim is \"What is Sexy?\". Now we wanna know what is sexy for you? What makes you feel sexy and confident?\n\nFor me, being sexy is a state of mind. Trust yourself and show what you have to offer.An invigorating bath, VS lingerie or a good perfume makes me feel sexy!\n\nWhat does Victoria's Secret mean to you?\n\nTo me it is already like family. More than five years together!Victoria's Secret has become so huge worldwide because they have extremely high quality products, that makes woman feel beautiful and confident.\n\nMany of your fellow angels are part of Taylor Swift's #girlsquad. Do you have your own squad too? Are you friends with models?\n\nAll wonderful!Of course I have! I have friends of all kinds. To have a friendship between two people there needs to be affinities, especially of character...and not regarding the profession.\n\nThe Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is just around the corner. Are you excited? How do you prepare for such a huge event? Does your workout routine change during the weeks before the show?\n\nI'm always very excited! It's a beautiful, great event, made with affection. Hundreds of people involved! Professionals that I admire and respect ...Preparation is constant ... you need to have discipline every day. We work all year, so sports and food are routine care.\n\nIn the meantime you're a mother of a 7-year-old boy. How do you handle everything?\n\nHe's already 8 years! It's my little-big man. Alexander is a light in my life.I must be present in his life and follow his growing.On a daily basis, I take him to school, have dinner together, play together...I would never leave that aside.I balance this with my career in the most natural way possible, just like all mothers that have to work and raise a child.\n\nWhere do you spend your free time? What are your hobbies?\n\nI really like to stay at home.I like to be with my son, with my family. I like to rest ....I love traveling...like movies too! At the cinema or on the couch.\n\nOne of your (craziest) fans has tattooed (literally) your face on his arm. How did you feel when you saw it?\n\nIt was a very remarkable tribute...I'll never forget. At the time I saw it, I could not believe someone would do a tribute of those for me!I played with him, saying: \"Boy, I do not deserve all this\" lol.\n\nYou travel a lot around the world because of your job. Recently you've been in Rome with the VS team to shoot the annual 'Holiday Commercial'. Did you enjoy your stay in Italy? What are the places that you really wanna travel to?\n\nItaly is beautiful! It was a pleasure to revisit places that refer you to far back.There was not much time for tourism... but the locations used by the VS are a spectacle.The next trip I want to do is with Bottletop, a charity brand that I have just been appointed ambassador of. It is a company that produces incredible handmade bags made with recycled materials. The money from the sales is donated to artisans women.These women that are manufacturing the products are from Bahia - Salvador and Africa, and I want to be able to get to know the people assisted by this project.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 10 years? Do you still have a dream to achieve?\n\nI just hope to stay healthy, live in peace, work and have the people I love around.This is my dream.\n\nLast On Vogue"
