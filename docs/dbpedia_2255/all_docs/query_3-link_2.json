        "text": "Thank you so much for doing this with us! Our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you share with us the backstory of how you came upon this career path to where you are today?\n\nBefore I had ever thought about modeling, I was studying to become a nurse. Many of my friends would always tell me that I should consider taking it up, but I gave it little thought. I began working with a Brazilian Agency, and then one thing led to another. This started with local job, and then eventually landed me moving to New York only after three months in São Paulo as a model. I started working with brands like Victoria’s Secret, Carolina Herrera, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Proenza Schouler, Oscar De La Renta, Ralph Lauren, and many others.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nI am grateful for so many people who have helped me get to where I am today. From my childhood friend, who encouraged me to try modeling to my family, who helped raise my son when I had to leave for work. I wouldn’t be where I am today without them. My son being with my family while I was in New York only pushed me to work harder towards a better future for us.\n\nIt has been said that sometimes our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story with us about the most humorous mistake you made when you were first starting? What lesson or take-away did you learn from that?\n\nI would always try to avoid making any mistakes. I always tried to be professional and be one of the first ones on set. I was very focused because I wanted to move my son close.\n\nAs a model, you have been blessed with great success in a career path that many have attempted, but eventually gave up on. In fact, perhaps most people who tried to follow a career path like yours did not succeed. Do you have any words of advice for others who may want to embark on this career path but know that their dreams might be dashed?\n\nBelieve in yourself and your unique qualities. Your uniqueness is your strength, so believe in yourself and your potential to stand out. It’s also important to stay persistent and patient. Success doesn’t come overnight, and challenges will come along the way. You must stay persistent in pursuing your dreams and remain patient during the ups and downs of your journey.\n\nCan you share with our readers some of the strategies you’ve used to build an engaged, loyal, and large online community?\n\nIt’s essential to be your authentic self when you are building an online presence. Especially when it comes to working with brands, you have to connect with the brands that best resonate with you and what you believe in. When I post on social media, I share all different types of photos, especially those that peek into my life beyond work. I love sharing content that connects to my everyday life, whether it’s working out with my trainer, traveling, or with my family. Those types of posts that let people get to know the real me.\n\nOk thank you for all that. Now let’s shift to the main focus of our interview. In my work, I focus on how one can thrive and care for oneself in three areas: body, mind, and heart. You are a busy person with a demanding schedule, can you share with our readers two self-care routines, practices or treatments that help your body thrive? (Kindly share a story or an example for each.)\n\nI focus best on my mental and physical well-being by regularly exercising. I like to do strength training and lift weights with my husband. I always make sure to keep my routine whenever I’m not traveling. After I drop the kids off at school, I go straight to work out. I turned my garage into a gym and workout at home with my trainer. After my workouts, I like to get in the sauna and ice.\n\nEating proper nutrition is very important when maintaining a healthy and happy body. Despite my busy schedule, I make sure to get my body the nutrition it needs with a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. In the mornings, the first thing I do is make green juice. You get all sorts of vitamins and minerals. It also helps with my digestive system and boosts my energy.\n\nCan you share with us two routines that you use to help your mind or heart to thrive?\n\nYou have to keep a strong sense of centeredness and mental clarity to succeed in the industry. I always make sure to take a few minutes for myself and breathe. There have been so many shows I’ve walked in that have been high-pressure, and I’ve had to stop and take a few moments to breathe to help me regain a sense of calm and focus. This has helped me approach each runway show and other stressful situations.\n\nThe amount of sleep you get during the night completely controls the type of day you will have. A bad night’s sleep can leave you with no energy and a bad mood. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized how important sleep is. It gives my body time to recover and recharge for the next day.\n\nCan you help articulate why self-care is so important for your mental wellness?\n\nSelf-care is vital for your mental wellness. It helps reduce any stress and helps prevent burnout. Self-care can be so many different things, from meditation and getting exercise to journaling and pampering yourself. It’s important to find what best fits you and helps you the most. Balancing a career and being a mom can be very hard at times, so I always make time for the self-care that best works for me.\n\nCan you share five ideas that anyone can use “to feel beautiful”?\n\nEmbrace your individuality: When I’m not traveling, I like to throw on what makes me feel comfortable. I love wearing sweat suits whenever I have downtime. When I’m comfortable, I am my happiest.\n\nCaring for your skin: I have a morning and nighttime skincare routine. This routine helps me keep my skin clear and healthy. Waking up with fresh and restored skin makes me feel naturally beautiful and ready to face the day.\n\nEngaging in physical activity: Working out daily helps release endorphins that affect my mood. I love being outside as much as possible, and getting some sun always boosts my energy. I always feel so good after working out or being in the sun.\n\nPracticing gratitude and positivity: Focusing on all the good in my life has helped me create a positive mindset. I try to take a moment to reflect on what I’m grateful for. It could be a beautiful sunrise, a supportive friend, or a conversation I had with my kid on the couch.\n\nIs there a particular resource, a practitioner, expert, book, or podcast that made a significant impact on you and helped you to thrive? Can you share a story about that with us?\n\nI was lucky to meet two incredible people who have significantly impacted my life. My husband introduced me to health and wellness experts Laird Hamilton and Gabby Reece, and I was so impressed by their way of life and how they care for body and mind. As I get older, I’m starting to understand that better.\n\nAs an influencer, you are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.\n\nI would like to use my platform to bring attention to preserving our planet and how as a society we can collectively work to protect it.\n\nWe are very blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world with whom you’d like to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this. :-)\n\nIf I could go back in time I would say grandpa, I miss him.\n\nWhat is the best way our readers can follow you on social media?\n\nMy handle is @laisribeiro and I actually manage my own social media so if you message me I will try to write back."
