Since then she has become well known as Victoria’s Secret Angel and engaged to NBA player Joakim Noah.\n\nTo maintain her toned physique, she works out daily using an assortment of exercises targeted at different muscle groups.\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Biography\n\nLais Ribeiro was born in Teresina in Piaui State and started modeling at 18 years old. Being Libra, Lais has always strived to find balance. In her initial years of modeling, she participated in multiple shows before eventually becoming one of the most popular models on the runway.\n\nRibeiro has participated in fashion campaigns for leading designers like Chanel Louis and Shiatzy Chen. A regular social media user, she frequently posts images of herself wearing different outfits and locations across social media – boasting an incredible Instagram following of over 3.2 million people!\n\nRibeiro began her professional modeling career in 2009 after being encouraged by friends to try her hand at modeling. Starting locally and eventually expanding to other cities across Brazil, her success can be attributed to her hard work ethic as well as remaining humble while trying to stay out of the limelight.\n\nRibeiro, in her personal life, is a single mother to her son Alexandre and has found that motherhood has changed her for the better. Motherhood has taught her that women tend to assume various versions of themselves over their lifespans and that motherhood can be one such form.\n\nRibeiro enjoys spending her free time relaxing with her family and friends, eating healthy, exercising regularly, and sharing photos of her animal friends on her social media pages.\n\nRibeiro has been modeling for over 10 years and has worked with major brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Blumarine, Christian Dior, Ralph Lauren, and Marc Jacobs. She’s appeared in five Victoria’s Secret fashion shows where she was chosen to wear Mouawad’s “Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra” which cost an estimated $2 Million at their 2017 show.\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Personal Life\n\nLais Ribeiro is an accomplished fashion model with over 15 years of experience in the industry. Her work has taken her onto the runways of many renowned designers like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Moschino as well as appearing on the covers of international magazines.

While studying to become a nurse, Lais was recommended by her friend that she try her luck at modeling instead. So she took up this challenge by moving to New York despite not speaking any English at the time – her perseverance paid off!\n\nShe first made her debut at Rag and Bone’s 2010 New York Fashion Week show for Rag and Bone and has since then gone on to model for various renowned fashion houses such as Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, and Versace. Additionally, she has been featured in numerous international fashion shows and campaigns, including the 2011 Sao Paulo Fashion Week.\n\nIn 2017, she participated in Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show where she donned the $2 Million “Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra,” designed by Mouawad and featuring diamonds, yellow sapphires, and blue topaz set in 18-karat gold. As well as modeling she is active on social media to raise awareness for issues that need support.\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Relationship\n\nLais Ribeiro had previously been in a relationship with Jared Homan, an American basketball player; however, this ended in 2022 and she is currently dating Joakim Noah, a retired NBA player; they became engaged earlier in 2019 and plan to marry soon.\n\nLais despite her busy schedule is committed to staying healthy and exercising regularly. She follows a clean diet with no processed foods and plenty of protein-rich food such as shrimp and avocado toast; in addition, she enjoys making smoothies made of fresh fruits and vegetables for herself and others. Lais believes the key to long and successful lives lies in being positive, kind, and never giving up!\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Modeling Career\n\nLais Ribeiro has built up an impressive resume over just a few years.

While attending nursing school, she took advice from one of her friends and started modeling on the side; quickly becoming one of the most in-demand runway models.\n\nIn 2011, she moved to New York to advance her career, and her hard work soon paid off: she soon secured high-profile gigs – including appearing as an actress on the hit series New Girl! Additionally, her beauty has seen her grace the covers of numerous magazines like Vogue, GQ, and Harper’s Bazaar.\n\nRibeiro is not just known for her modeling career; she is an active proponent of body positivity. She encourages women to embrace their curves and has spoken out against unrealistic beauty standards. Furthermore, Ribeiro advocates for social justice – she frequently supports local initiatives in Brazil and elsewhere and even called for an “insurrection of feelings and actions” after the murder of Rio de Janeiro Councilwoman Marielle Franco, a champion for slum rights.\n\nThough busy with her career, this model still finds time for family and friends. She remains close to both her mother and sister and often posts pictures of them on social media. Additionally, in her free time, she enjoys dancing and staying fit through fitness; dancing has long been one of her hobbies, as is fitness; she’s an animal lover too, sharing pictures of her dog or other pets on social media; she travels frequently for work too – including visits to countries such as France and Italy!\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Social Media\n\nVictoria’s Secret model Lais Ribeiro is unquestionably one of the hottest young stars in fashion and it’s easy to see why. She graces runways regularly while also modeling for Dolce & Gabbana, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton fashion houses; not to mention being known for her stunning lingerie shoots!\n\nRibeiro has built up an enormous following on Instagram, where she regularly shares provocative photos of herself posing in skimpy outfits. Recently, she sent shockwaves through fans as she donned a neon green mesh bikini top that showed off her figure with poise. Holding two puppies in either hand while staring seductively into the camera lens, Ribeiro completed her look with brown leather sandals for an eye-catching finish.\n\nShe recently posted a sultry picture of herself wearing a black two-piece, chunky boots, statement sunglasses, and a brown bag – making an impactful fashion statement with over 6.5 million followers weighing in with praise in the comment section.\n\nMalibu beachgoer and lingerie model Sarah Brown was recently seen walking the shores in Malibu on Memorial Day wearing an eye-catching brightly colored long-sleeve top and rainbow-striped shorts, covering her body well enough for all eyes to admire it. She recently posted a snap from this Memorial Day outing.\n\nShe can often be seen sporting the latest trends, like an off-the-shoulder white Bardot dress with loose curls worn loose and an elegantly cut cropped jacket. To complete her stunning appearance she topped it all off with an exquisite bun.\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Net Worth\n\nLast year, she made headlines when she graced the runway of Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2017 in Shanghai wearing an exquisite $2 million Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra designed by Mouawad and featuring more than 6,000 yellow sapphires, yellow diamonds, and blue topaz stones set in 18-karat gold.\n\nShe recently revealed her engagement to Memphis Grizzlies star Joakim Noah at Burning Man festival 2021, later sharing a beautiful snap of them."
