        "text": "If you're a fashion fan, chances are Lais Ribeiro is a familiar face. The 26-year-old Brazilian-born Victoria's Secret Angel, who earned her official wings in 2015, has been featured in some of the industry's hottest lingerie ads, runway shows (she's a member of the Balmain army, after all), and magazines — and she looks flawless every. Single. Time.\n\nHow, you ask? Because she trains hard, that's how. A quick scroll through Lais's Instagram shows her dedication to regular sweat sessions, and we're seriously impressed. From oceanside yoga to hardcore conditioning, read on to see all the times Lais was the ultimate fitspiration. When you're done, grab your headphones, crank up our playlist, and try our (relatively) easy Summer workout."
