        "text": "Try to imagine, for a minute, lying on a hot beach in Brazil. The waves are pounding, the sun is shining and Lais Ribeiro is whispering in your ear. She mentions how much she loves music. ‘Music has the power to influence the energy of the environment, to thrill,’ she says, before you snap out of it and get back to work or take up the overpriced coffee you’ve just ordered.\n\nWherever you may find yourself, Lais has just spent a weekend sunning herself in Ibiza, on a break from a busy year. Don’t feel too bad that you haven’t hit the coast in a while: her life of late has become less of a beach and more like the fashion shows she’s come to dominate – cameras, runways, music, fans, interviews. Her Instagram account might fill both your feed and head with the idea that she spends all day in the sun and the surf, but the truth is she’s more often caught up in the commotion of backstage preparation. ‘Fashion shows are always such a rush,’ Lais tells me. ‘There so are many people involved, a lot of work to do, dozens of models to prepare, costume changes, and so on. Everyone who works here is used to the rush and the chaos backstage, but everything is planned and produced carefully in advance.’\n\nBorn in Miguel Aves, a small town in Brazil’s Piaui state, Lais moved with her family to Brasilia. Growing up between the two cities, the 24-year-old had a happy childhood. ‘It was wonderful. I played games and ran down the street. I did everything a child needs to do. I think it’s essential that every child has a free childhood; living with other children, playing. It’s important for development. ‘I didn’t think of myself as a pretty girl then. It’s an age were skinny and tall girls are not considered pretty, so for me it was a process understanding that I had a kind of beauty possible for this market.’ And she’s taken her fair share it. In 2011, Lais was the most booked fashion model at Brazil Fashion Week, standing out in 27 shows. ‘This gave me motivation to move on. It changed the way I saw myself in this market, and made me feel able to go beyond. It was this maturity that made me move forward.\n\n‘I love seeing new places,’ Lais says, when I ask her whether she ever gets tired of Brazil. ‘I have done many jobs in Turkey and Caicos, which is a Caribbean island that looks like a paradise. I really want to see South Africa! I’ve heard many good things about places like Jo’burg and Cape Town.’\n\nSince then, she’s appeared for Victoria’s Secret, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Versace, Chanel and every other brand you’re not entirely sure how to spell. And she’s made some pretty important friends along the way, too. ‘Before working in this market, I didn’t follow the careers of models. It was a universe that wasn’t part of my life. I got to know them after I started working. When I started living with them, I got to know them better.’ I ask her if there’s anyone she’s particularly fond of working with. Lais has an easy answer. ‘Adriana Lima is a person with whom I have a special friendship and admiration. I deeply respect people who do not lose their humility and keep treating others politely.’ I bring up her sun-and-surf Instagram account and ask who she likes to follow. ‘Victoria’s Secret’s new campaigns, and Rihanna. She’s really fun.’\n\nWhen being photographed on the beach, Lais likes to listen to music that matches the moment she’s in. ‘A good soundtrack helps you to move on a shoot. It can make you jump, and it can also make you cry. I also love to dance.’ I ask what kind of guy she’d ask out on a date.‘I would call some Brazilian politicians to ask what they really want to do about the country,’ she teases.\n\nWith the fashion and modelling industry coming under fire for not being representative in terms of race, Lais has an opinion. ‘I believe this is changing. I see many campaigns and editorials with black models. It is a necessary change and it is time it happens. Diversity is a reality that needs attention. Fashion has its role, and reflects the behaviour of society. Black models, oriental, trans, plus-size and other minorities have gained their deserved space.’\n\nIt’s clear that Lais is a proud woman. And not in the way the Rihannas of the world might be perceived to be. There is a humility about her. ‘My family is proud of me as a daughter, a sister, a mother. Our relationship has always been the same; nothing has changed because of my career.’"
