        "text": "Sometimes it can feel like models and actresses are a whole different kind of human. Whenever we see them in the pages of magazines or on TV screens, they're often photoshopped or have the benefit of professional hair and makeup. While that's totally cool and part of their job, it can make us regular people feel a little inadequate. That's why people were so thrilled to watch Victoria's Secret Angel Lais Ribeiro walk the runway in China at the Victoria's Secret Fashion show last week, baring tiny stretch marks on her thighs without a care in the world and still looking fantastic as ever.\n\nRibeiro is a Brazilian supermodel and has been modeling for Victoria's Secret for a while now. According to Yahoo, a major fan of the brand noticed in some photos from the runway show that she's sporting some stretch marks on her outer thighs and posted about it on Instagram, saying, \"She is an [sic] human, like you and me. She have stretch marks like all the girls! and that's not ugly. Stretch marks are beautifulüíñüå∏ Love your body! It's the only [one] you will have.\"\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nStretch marks sure are common, and definitely are not ugly as @victoriassecret_passion points out.
