        "text": "Swimsuit supermodel Lais Ribeiro is no stranger to the Victoria’s Secret runway, having appeared in the 2010, 2011 and 2013 VS Fashion Shows. However, up until now the Piauí native had not signed an official Angel contract with the brand. This year, however, Ribeiro joined the exclusive list of models who have been awarded Supermodel Angel status. It’s easy to view this as just another contract, but being awarded their wings has been the jumpstart to some of the worlds most famous supermodels careers, including Gisele, Adriana Lima, Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks and Miranda Kerr.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Ribeiro’s career hasn’t been filled with success up to this point. The 24 year old has appeared in American, Brazilian, German, and Italian Vogue, and featured in ad campaigns for Ralph Lauren, Dior, and Tom Ford. She’s walked in shows for many exclusive brands including Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Gucci, and Marc Jacobs. On top of these already impressive facts, Ribeiro was the most booked model in the Brazilian fashion weeks of 2011, appearing a total of 53 shows.\n\nHowever even with such a successful career, becoming an Angel is a huge accomplishment for any model. When Ribeiro spoke to Us Weekly about her new contract, she spoke of her Brazilian peers and their success with Victoria’s Secret. “Adriana Lima and Gisele Bundchen (are my favorite Angels). They are both Brazilians who have accomplished so much in their careers, and it all started with Victoria’s Secret. They are determined businesswomen, role models, and icons.”\n\nWe expect Lais Ribeiro to have every success in this new career move, for which we at Amazuna wish her the best of luck!\n\nLast week Brazilian news source Estadão reported that Gisele Bündchen was leaving her long time occupation as a model in runway shows, walking her final time in the Colcci show at São Paulo fashion week. However, many people misinterpreted this as an announcement of an official retirement from Gisele, which her IMG rep quickly put to rest calling it ‘lost in translation’ when talking to British Vogue, saying “It’s true that she doesn’t do fashion week; she doesn’t do 17 shows in all three cities and she’s not going to start… The word retirement is a bit extreme.” So although we might not see Gisele on any more runways, we’ll continue to see her print projects with some of the world’s most renowned brands, and will always have her past successes to look back on.\n\nAlthough Gisele’s very first introduction to modelling was by winning a contest at age 14, most consider her first modelling breakthrough to be walking in Alexander McQueen’s spring 1998 ‘rain’ show, which featured a slippery runway, and so models were chosen for their ability to walk in high heels. Subsequently McQueen dubbed her “the body”, which kickstarted her career. This perhaps led to her contract with Victoria’s Secret in 2000, which raised her reputation to allow her to be the high status model she became.\n\nMany of Gisele’s successes are hard to believe, record breaking, or simply the type of fact that you have to read twice to believe.\n\nIn 2000, she was chosen to wear Victoria’s Secret’s most expensive fantasy bra, worth $15 million, a record breaking total for the most expensive lingerie ever made to that point.\n\nEvery year since 2002, Gisele has been named the world’s richest model; and in 2014 Forbes estimated that she earned $47 million in 12 months, and $386 million since 2002.\n\nAs of 2012, she had appeared on 120 Vogue covers around the world, and holds the record for the most Vogue Brasil covers of all time.\n\nGisele also broke a record by the end of 2014, having appeared in 6,013 tv commercial spots in Brazil, more than any other Brazilian celebrity.\n\nGisele’s achievements can read like a list of statistics, as she manages to break records and create astounding figures in everything she takes on. Though it shouldn’t be forgotten that amongst all of her astonishing career achievements, Gisele has been happily married to Tom Brady since 2009, and together they have raised two beautiful children, making it difficult to be anything but a little jealous of such a well rounded person.\n\nThe team at Amazuna can only hope we still have much more to see from Gisele, and appreciate how the Brazilian beauty has changed the landscape of modelling over her now 20 year long career."
