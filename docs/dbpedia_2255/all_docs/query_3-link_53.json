        "text": "Laís Ribeiro's role as the international programs associate revolves around bringing to life the implementation of APS’ goal of serving as a welcoming global hub for the world’s physicists. Before joining APS, her journey led her through the Washington, DC, Chamber of Commerce. There, she managed the organization's international programs and assisted with the production of annual reports and business conferences. A standout moment for her was spearheading the DC health grant project, DC Works Well. Through this initiative, she coordinated business focus groups, ultimately culminating in the publication of the inaugural report, 5-Step Roadmap to Employee Wellness. Given her background, she is extremely passionate about human rights and immigrant advocacy.\n\nIn her professional voyage, she has also provided interpretation services and assisted in research, analysis, and interviews for asylum applications for refugees in the Washington, DC, region. Originally from Recife, Brazil, she is a native Portuguese-speaker and also fluent in Spanish and English. She holds a BA in international studies with a regional focus in Latin America and concentrations in international business, development, and geopolitics. Off the clock, she loves to create art and her happiest moments are those spent on the beach – even more so if shared with friends and family."
