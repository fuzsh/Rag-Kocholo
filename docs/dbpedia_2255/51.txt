MODEL Lais Ribeiro looks like she is ready for summer.

The Brazilian beauty, 33, stuns in a new campaign for American bikini brand Paige.

Showing off her trim frame, Lais slipped into a 60s-inspired patterned two-piece.

In a second shot, the model, who is a favourite with lingerie giant Vicotria’s Secret, rocked a blue floral bikini with statement oversized white glasses.

She made her catwalk debut in 2009.

The Victoria’s Secret model was axed from the brand alongside all the ‘Angels’ in 2021, swapping them for a ‘What Women Want’ campaign of athletes and activists.

The popular lingerie firm’s annual fashion show returned in September 2023 after a five-year break.

It showcased four different designers from Lagos, Bogotá, London and Tokyo.

Lais is wed to former professional basketball player Joakim Noah, 38.

The pair enjoyed a lavish beachside ceremony in her native Brazil.

She wore a white gown embroidered with flowers for the ceremony, while Joakim put on a white suit.

Last year she celebrated her first anniversary by writing to her husband on social media: “Happy anniversary baby!

"A special week that we will never forget.”
