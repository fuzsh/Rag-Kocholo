        "text": "LINCOLN — Back in his home state for one night, Andy Roddick worked up a sweat hours before playing two matches against some other American tennis greats.\n\nAhead of the PowerShares Series event at Pinnacle Bank Arena on Friday night, some lucky tennis fans got to hit — and even play doubles points — with Roddick, James Blake, John McEnroe and Michael Chang.\n\nOne brave returner called a big serve by the hard-hitting Roddick wide.\n\n“Challenge!” Roddick joked.\n\nBy the end of the hourlong “Hit with the Pros” session, Roddick’s T-shirt was drenched, but it was all in good fun.\n\n“It doesn’t take much to make me sweat,” said Roddick, a 35-year-old Omaha native who resides in Texas and is the season points leader on the tour featuring retired legends. “I think we understand that our part of the game now is to help promote and play and have fun.”\n\nThat’s just what Roddick, Blake, McEnroe and Chang did during the competition.\n\nAnd for Roddick, the real matches were no sweat.\n\nHe won two one-set matches, including the final 6-3 against McEnroe, in front of a home crowd that was mostly on his side. He received the biggest welcome of the four players.\n\n“I’ve had so much support from this area for so long, and it’s nice to see an area that looks a lot like my room growing up with Husker gear everywhere,” Roddick said. “We don’t get that much in Texas.”\n\nRoddick aced McEnroe eight times in the final, and McEnroe won just one point off Roddick’s serve.\n\nMcEnroe kept the set close early by finishing points at the net and was even able to get the crowd on his side at times. But Roddick won the last four games after falling behind 3-2, cruising through his service games and finally breaking McEnroe, who had to work longer and harder for his holds.\n\n“It feels like I’m serving all the time,” McEnroe said after one quick hold by Roddick.\n\nMcEnroe won the first semifinal match 6-2 against Chang. The 58-year-old McEnroe, who won seven Grand Slam titles in his career, beat Chang with effective serving and defense, often extending a point one more shot before Chang would lose on an error.\n\nBut it was Chang, who won the 1989 French Open at age 17 and is the youngest men’s major champion ever, who hit the highlight-reel shots. One, a backhand winner on the sideline, had McEnroe standing over the spot debating whether to call it out — the players called their own lines.\n\nThen Roddick defeated Blake 6-1 in the second semifinal — though the crowd wasn’t all on the Nebraska native’s side. Before Blake’s first service game, one fan yelled: “Let’s go, Blake!”\n\n“I have one fan here,” said Blake, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 in 2006.\n\nRoddick controlled the set with his big serve, recording two aces and numerous service winners.\n\nThe two toyed with each other throughout. At one point, Blake jokingly hit a serve when Roddick was off the court retrieving a ball.\n\nRoddick, who won the 2003 U.S. Open, is the last American man to win a major and reach the world’s No. 1 ranking. He retired in 2012 and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame earlier this year.\n\nNow, another player with local roots — Lincoln native Jack Sock — is one of the top American players on tour. The 25-year-old, who is ranked No. 21 in the world, won two ATP Tour titles this year after winning a gold medal in mixed doubles at the 2016 Olympics.\n\nTwo of the better American men’s players in recent memory are from Nebraska.\n\n“I think there’s a sense of pride,” Roddick said. “It’s something that Jack and I talk about a little bit.\n\n“It’s nice to have another guy from Nebraska on tour.”\n\nRoddick said Sock may be more talented than he was.\n\n“He’s got a lot of gifts,” Roddick said, “so it’ll be fun to see if he can get those all working together on the bigger moments.”\n\nEarly in the match between Roddick — a Husker fan — and Blake — who attended Harvard for two years before pursuing his professional career — Roddick played to the crowd with a reference to Saturday’s football game between Nebraska and No. 9 Wisconsin.\n\n“James was choosing between Harvard and Wisconsin when he went to college,” he joked.\n\n“That’s not true,” Blake replied. “But I will mention my wife is from Milwaukee.”\n\nRoddick won’t be at Memorial Stadium for Saturday’s game. But he did offer some keys for the Huskers to pull the upset.\n\n“I think they have to hang in early,” Roddick said. “If you can create a little bit of scoreboard pressure, that helps in any sport you’re playing.”\n\nsports@owh.com, 402-444-1201\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
