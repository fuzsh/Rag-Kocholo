        "text": "Template:Use mdy dates Template:Pp-move-indef Template:Infobox tennis biography Andrew Stephen \"Andy\" Roddick (born August 30, 1982) is a retired American former World No. 1 professional tennis player.\n\nHe became a Grand Slam singles champion when he won the title at the 2003 US Open, defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the finals, which currently makes him the last North American male player to win a Grand Slam singles event. Roddick has reached four other Grand Slam finals (Wimbledon in 2004, 2005, and 2009, and the US Open in 2006), losing to Roger Federer every time. He is married to Brooklyn Decker, a Sports Illustrated swimwear model and actress.\n\nOn August 30, 2012, during the 2012 US Open and on his 30th birthday, Roddick announced he would retire after the tournament. Following a fourth-round defeat to Juan Martin del Potro, Roddick retired from the sport with the aim of focusing on his foundation in future years.[1]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nRoddick was born in Omaha, Nebraska,[2] to Jerry and Blanche Roddick. Roddick's father was a businessman, and his mother was a school teacher. She now directs the Andy Roddick Foundation. Roddick has two older brothers, Lawrence and John (All-American tennis player at University of Georgia [1996–98] and head tennis coach at the University of Oklahoma), who were both promising tennis players at a young age.\n\nRoddick lived in Austin, Texas, from age 4 until he was 11, and then moved to Boca Raton, Florida, in the interest of his brother's tennis career,[3] attending Boca Prep International School, and graduating in the Class of 2000.[4] Roddick played varsity basketball in high school alongside his future Davis Cup teammate Mardy Fish, who trained and lived with Roddick in 1999. During that time period, he intermittently trained with Venus and Serena Williams; he later moved back to Austin. His tennis idol growing up was Andre Agassi.\n\nIt was while Roddick was flipping through a previous swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated that Roddick first noticed Brooklyn Decker, to whom he is now married. (According to Decker, as she stated in an interview with David Letterman, Roddick had his agent contact her agent to arrange an initial meeting.) The two began dating in 2007, and on March 31, 2008, Roddick announced on his website that he and Decker had become engaged. The couple was married in Austin on April 17, 2009.[5]\n\nCareer[]\n\nBreakthrough[]\n\nRoddick considered quitting competitive tennis at the age of 17, when he had a losing streak in the juniors. His coach, Tarik Benhabiles, talked him into giving tennis four more months of undivided attention.[6] Roddick finished as the no. 6 junior in the U.S. in 1999, and as the no. 1 junior in the world in 2000. He won six world junior singles titles and seven world junior doubles titles, and won the US Open and Australian Open junior singles titles in 2000.[7]\n\nIn March in Miami, in the first round Roddick had his first ATP level victory as he beat world no. 41 Fernando Vicente of Spain, 6–4, 6–0. In August in Washington, D.C., he beat world no. 30 Fabrice Santoro of France, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3. Roddick played the Banana Bowl in the city of São Paulo and won, beating Joachim Johansson in the final.[8] Roddick also won the Australian Junior Open, defeating Mario Ančić in the final. In 2001, Roddick defeated former French Open champion Michael Chang in five sets in the second round of the tournament, despite the fact that clay was Roddick's worst surface. During the following Wimbledon, he further showed potential by taking a set from eventual winner Goran Ivanišević. At the age of 19, he also defeated 7-time Wimbledon champion, world no. 4, and fellow American Pete Sampras at the Miami Masters 7–6, 6–3, and world no. 1 Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, 6–7, 6–4, 6–2, in August.\n\nRoddick's breakthrough year was 2003, in which he defeated Younes El Aynaoui in the quarterfinals of the 2003 Australian Open. Roddick and the Moroccan battled for five hours, with the fifth set (21–19 in favor of Roddick) at the time the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam tournament during the open era, at 2 hours and 23 minutes. Despite a lackluster French Open, Roddick enjoyed success in the United Kingdom by winning Queen's Club, beating world no. 2 Andre Agassi, 6–1, 6–7, 7–6, along the way, and reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, where he lost to eventual champion Roger Federer in straight sets. He avenged that loss in August, beating then world no. 3 Federer in Montreal, 6–4, 3–6, 7–6.[9] It is one of three times that Roddick defeated Federer in an official ATP tournament.\n\nWorld No. 1[]\n\nRoddick's hardcourt record in 2003 included his first Masters Series titles—coming at Canada and Cincinnati–and his only Grand Slam title. At the US Open, Roddick rallied from two sets down and a match point in the semifinals to beat David Nalbandian of Argentina, 6–7, 3–6, 7–6, 6–1, 6–3. He then defeated world no. 3 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final, 6–3, 7–6, 6–3. At the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston, he defeated world no. 7 Carlos Moyá of Spain, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, and world no. 4 Guillermo Coria of Argentina, 6–3, 6–7, 6–3, before losing to Roger Federer in the semifinals. By the end of the year, at age 21, he was ranked no. 1, the first American to finish a year at no. 1 since Andre Agassi in 1999. He also became the youngest American to hold this rank since computer rankings were started in 1973.\n\nRoddick's reign at no. 1 ended the following February, when Roger Federer ascended to the top position, after winning his first Australian Open; the 2004 Australian Open would be the only time in Roddick's career where he was the no. 1 seed in a Grand Slam. In April, Roddick again beat world no. 6 Moya, this time 5–7, 6–2, 7–5. In June, Roddick advanced to his first Wimbledon final, and after taking the first set from defending champion Federer, lost in four sets. Roddick was knocked out during the 2004 US Open in a five-set quarterfinal against another big server, Joachim Johansson. Later in September in Bangkok, he beat world no. 9 Marat Safin of Russia, 7–6, 6–7, 7–6. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Roddick lost to Chilean Fernando González, the eventual bronze medal winner, in the third round. In November he beat world no. 7 Tim Henman of Great Britain, 7–5, 7–6, world no. 4 Safin, 7–6, 7–6, and world no. 6 Guillermo Coria, 7–6, 6–3. Later that year, Roddick teamed up with Mardy Fish and Bob and Mike Bryan on the U.S. Davis Cup team that lost to Spain in the final in Seville. Roddick lost his singles match against Rafael Nadal, who would in the following year win the French Open. Towards the end of 2004, Roddick fired his coach of 18 months, Brad Gilbert, and hired assistant Davis Cup coach Dean Goldfine. Roddick finished 2004 ranked as the world no. 2, the U.S. no. 1, and the player with the most aces (2,017). In 2004, Roddick saved fellow tennis player Sjeng Schalken and other guests (including close friends Ben Campezi and Dean Monroe) from a hotel fire.[10]\n\nRoddick's first 2005 tournament victory was the SAP Open in San Jose, California, where he became the first to win the event in consecutive years since Mark Philippoussis in 1999 and 2000. The top-seeded Roddick defeated Cyril Saulnier, 6–0, 6–4, in 50 minutes, the event's first championship shutout set since Arthur Ashe beat Guillermo Vilas in 1975. In March, he defeated world no. 7 Carlos Moyá, 6–7, 6–4, 6–1. In April, Roddick won the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championships, reclaiming the title he won in 2001 and 2002. (He lost in 2003 to Agassi, and in 2004 to Tommy Haas.) In May, Roddick had match point against Spain's Fernando Verdasco. Verdasco was attempting to save the match point on his second serve, when the linesman erroneously called the serve out. If this call had held, Roddick would have won the match. Roddick motioned to the umpire, pointing to the clear ball mark on the clay indicating the ball was in, and the call was consequently changed. Verdasco went on to win the match. At the French Open, Roddick lost to unseeded Argentine José Acasuso in the second round, and at Wimbledon, Roddick lost to Federer in the final for the second consecutive year. In August, he defeated world no. 3 Lleyton Hewitt, 6–4, 7–6, at the Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Roddick was defeated by world no. 70 Gilles Müller in the first round. Roddick's last US Open first-round loss had been in 2000. At the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, Roddick defeated Gaël Monfils to wrap up a tournament without losing a set or getting his serve broken.\n\nNew coach[]\n\nRoddick's first ATP event of the year was the Australian Open. There, he reached the fourth round, before being upset by unseeded and eventual finalist, Marcos Baghdatis. At the French Open, Roddick retired in the first round, after sustaining a foot injury during the match. Two weeks later at Wimbledon, Roddick was upset in the third round by British hopeful Andy Murray. This loss caused Roddick to fall below the top 10 for the first time since 2002. After Wimbledon, Roddick began working with a new coach, tennis legend Jimmy Connors. In his first event with his new coach, Roddick reached the final of Indianapolis, before losing to good friend and fellow American, James Blake. His resurgence finally came at the Cincinnati Masters, where he won the event by defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final, making this the first masters event he won since 2004. At the US Open, Roddick easily won his first two matches against Florent Serra and Kristian Pless. He then played a thriller five-set match against Fernando Verdasco, winning 6–2 in the final set. Next, he beat Benjamin Becker, who was coming off a huge win against recently retired Andre Agassi. In the quarterfinals, Roddick beat Lleyton Hewitt, avenging his loss in 2001, 6–3, 7–5, 6–4. Now in the semifinals for the first time since he won in 2003, Roddick played Mikhail Youzhny and beat him, 6–7, 6–0, 7–6, 6–3. In the finals of a Grand Slam for the first time since Wimbledon a year prior, Roddick played world no. 1 Federer. He lost, however, 2–6, 6–4, 5–7, 1–6. He then qualified for the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, where he defeated world no. 4 Ivan Ljubičić of Croatia, 6–4, 6–7, 6–1, but lost in the round robin to world no. 1 Federer, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, in a tough three-set battle.\n\nRoddick entered the 2007 Australian Open as the sixth seed. In his first-round match, he lost a marathon first-set tiebreak 20–18, but eventually won the match in four sets against wild card Jo-Wilfried Tsonga from France. Roddick defeated 26th-seeded Marat Safin in the third round, and ninth-seeded Mario Ančić in a five-set fourth-round match. Roddick won his quarterfinal match against fellow American Mardy Fish, 6–2, 6–2, 6–2. His run was ended in the semifinals by world no. 1 Federer, who defeated him in straight sets, 6–4, 6–0, 6–2, making his head-to-head record against Federer 1–13. In first-round Davis Cup action, Roddick helped the US defeat the Czech Republic, winning his singles matches against Ivo Minář and Tomáš Berdych. Roddick reached at least the semifinals of his next two tournaments. He bowed out to Andy Murray in the semifinals of the SAP Open in San Jose, California, a reprise of 2006. Roddick then defeated Murray in the semifinals of the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup in Memphis, Tennessee, before losing in the final to defending champion Tommy Haas, 6–3, 6–2. Reaching the final, however, enabled Roddick to overtake Nikolay Davydenko for the world no. 3 position, his first week inside the top three since March 6, 2006. At the first ATP Masters Series tournament of the year, after beating world no. 8 Ivan Ljubičić, 6–4, 6–7, 6–1, Roddick reached the semifinals of the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, but lost to world no. 2 Rafael Nadal, 6–4, 6–3.\n\nSeries of injuries[]\n\nRoddick then played the Miami Masters, where he retired from his quarterfinal match against Andy Murray due to a left hamstring injury. Roddick then helped the U.S. defeat Spain and advance to the Davis Cup semifinals, winning his lone singles match against Fernando Verdasco, 7–6, 6–1, 6–4. However, Roddick re-aggravated his hamstring injury during the Davis Cup tie, and was subsequently forced to pull out of the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas. Roddick also announced that he would withdraw from the Monte Carlo Masters, citing the injury. His next tournament was the Internazionali d'Italia. After a first-round bye, he won his first match against Gastón Gaudio, where he saved three break points and fired nine aces. However, he was unable to stop Juan Ignacio Chela in the third round, losing 6–0, 6–4. Roddick then withdrew from the Masters Series Hamburg tournament because, according to his website, he needed time to physically prepare himself for the upcoming French Open. Roddick was seeded third at the French Open, but was eliminated in the first round by Russian Igor Andreev in four sets, 6–3, 4–6, 3–6, 4–6. Roddick was victorious at the Stella Artois Championships for the fourth time, when he defeated Nicolas Mahut in the final, 4–6, 7–6, 7–6. At Wimbledon, Roddick was seeded third and considered one of the pre-tournament favorites behind Federer and Nadal. He reached the quarterfinals after wins against Justin Gimelstob of the U.S., Danai Udomchoke of Thailand, Fernando Verdasco of Spain, and Paul-Henri Mathieu of France. In the quarterfinals, Roddick lost in five close sets to Richard Gasquet of France, 6–4, 6–4, 6–7, 6–7, 6–8.\n\nDuring the summer hardcourt season, Roddick played four tournaments in four weeks. Roddick made it to the semifinals of the Indianapolis Tennis Championships, where he was upset by Frank Dancevic of Canada, 6–4, 7–6. The next week, however, Roddick claimed his second ATP title of the year by winning the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. for the third time, when he beat American newcomer John Isner, 6–4, 7–6. He then lost in the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal to Novak Djokovic, and in the third round of the Western & Southern Financial Group Masters tournament in Cincinnati, Ohio to David Ferrer of Spain. At the US Open, Roddick defeated Gimelstob in the first round, 7–6, 6–3, 6–3. He won his next three matches, one in straight sets and the other two when his opponent retired. In the quarterfinals, Roddick once again lost to Federer, 7–6, 7–6, 6–2, bringing his head-to-head record with Federer 1–14. There were no breaks of serve and only one break point total in the first two sets, that being on Federer's serve. Two weeks later, Roddick anchored the U.S. Davis Cup team during its 4–1 semifinal defeat of Sweden. Roddick won both his singles matches, opening the tie with a defeat of Joachim Johansson, 7–6, 7–6, 6–3, and clinching it with a 6–2, 7–6, 6–4 victory over Jonas Björkman. This was the ninth time in nine tries that Roddick had clinched a tie for the American team.Template:Citation needed\n\nRoddick then set his sights on the Madrid Masters, but pulled out, citing a knee injury. At his next tournament two weeks later in Lyon, France, Roddick lost in the first round to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, 7–6, 2–6, 6–4. Roddick then withdrew from the Paris Masters, incurring a $22,600 fine for not fulfilling his media obligations at the tournament.[11] At the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Roddick defeated world no. 4 Nikolay Davydenko, 6–3, 4–6, 6–2, in his first round-robin match, and then defeated world no. 7 Fernando González in his next match to become the first player to qualify for the semifinals of the tournament. In his third and final round-robin match, Roddick lost once again to Federer, 6–4, 6–2, for the 15th time in 16 career matches. In the semifinals, Roddick lost, 6–1, 6–3, to no. 6 seed David Ferrer, who had won all three of his round-robin matches. This was Roddick's third semifinal finish out of the last five years at the Tennis Masters Cup (he reached the semifinals in 2003 and 2004, withdrew in 2005, and failed to advance to the semifinals in 2006 after a 1–2 round-robin record). Roddick finished the year by helping the U.S. defeat Russia and win the 2007 Davis Cup, its 32nd Davis Cup victory, but first since 1995. Roddick won his rubber against Dmitry Tursunov, 6–4, 6–4, 6–2, before James Blake and Bob and Mike Bryan completed the victory. Having secured the tie with an unassailable 3–0 lead, Roddick decided to sit out his second singles match of the tie.\n\nRoddick started 2008 strongly, defeating Ivan Ljubičić, 6–3, 6–0, and Safin, 6–3, 6–3, to reach the AAMI Kooyong Classic final for the fourth consecutive season. In the final, he defeated Marcos Baghdatis, 7–5, 6–3, to win the tournament for the third consecutive year. Roddick was seeded sixth in the 2008 Australian Open. In the first round, he defeated Lukas Dlouhy of the Czech Republic, 6–3, 6–4, 7–5. In the second round, he defeated German Michael Berrer, 6–2, 6–2, 6–4. He then lost to the no. 29 seed Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany in the third round in a 5-set match, 4–6, 6–3, 6–7, 7–6, 6–8. Despite losing, Roddick served a career-high of 42 aces in a match. Roddick won his 24th career title and his third title of the year at the SAP Open in San Jose, California. He defeated the Czech Radek Stepanek in straight sets, 6–4, 7–5. Roddick's next tournament was the Dubai Tennis Championships. He made it to the semifinals by defeating world no. 2 Rafael Nadal of Spain, 7–6, 6–2, his first victory over Nadal since the second round of the 2004 US Open. The win also marked Roddick's first victory over a player ranked in the top two since June 2003. He progressed through to the finals by defeating world no. 3 and 2008 Australian Open singles champion Novak Djokovic, 7–6, 6–3, in the semifinal. By making it to the final, he became the first American to reach the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships final in the tournament's 16-year history. In the final he defeated Feliciano López, 6–7, 6–4, 6–2, to win his 25th career title. He never lost his serve during the entire tournament.\n\nSplit with coach[]\n\nFollowing Roddick's quarterfinal match in Dubai, he announced that he had split with his coach of two years, Jimmy Connors. Connors had resigned a week earlier, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.[12] Roddick would continue to be coached by his brother, John Roddick. He then fell to former world no. 2 Tommy Haas at the Pacific Life Open in the second round, 6–4, 6–4. At the 2008 Sony Ericsson Open, Roddick advanced to the semifinals after defeating world no. 1 Roger Federer, 7–6, 4–6, 6–3, an hour after proposing to Brooklyn Decker, bringing his head-to-head record against Federer to 2–15. Roddick improved to 3–0 against top-3 players in 2008. Roddick lost in the semifinals to Nikolay Davydenko, 6–7, 2–6. Roddick's next tournament was the Masters tournament in Rome. There, he equaled his best result by reaching the semifinals, where he retired against Stanislas Wawrinka in the pair's first encounter, due to a back injury.\n\nRoddick was forced to pull out of the 2008 French Open due to a shoulder injury. After a visit to a doctor in New York, it was determined this was nothing more than an inflammation of the rotator cuff. His first tournament after the shoulder injury was the Artois Championship, his annual Wimbledon preparation, where he was the defending champion. Roddick defeated Mardy Fish and Andy Murray, before losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. At Wimbledon, Roddick suffered a second-round defeat to Serbia's Janko Tipsarević, 6–7, 7–5, 6–4, 7–6. This was his earliest exit at Wimbledon. Roddick was beaten at the Rogers Cup in the third round by Marin Cilic, 4–6, 6–4, 4–6. He was then forced to pull out of the Cincinnati Masters following a neck injury, which he said may have been caused by a poor sleeping posture. He stated in an interview that the neck injury had nothing to do with his shoulder injury. Roddick did not participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics, with his reason being to concentrate on the 2008 US Open.[13] In order to prepare for the US Open, Roddick then played in the smaller hard court tournaments in the US Open Series, including those at Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. At the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, Roddick lost to Juan Martín del Potro in the final, 1–6, 6–7.\n\nAt the 2008 US Open, Roddick defeated Fabrice Santoro in the first round, 6–2, 6–2, 6–2. Roddick then won his next three matches against Ernests Gulbis, Andreas Seppi, and Fernando González. In the quarterfinals, Roddick lost to world no. 3 Novak Djokovic, 2–6, 3–6, 6–3, 6–7, bringing his head-to-head record with Djokovic to 1–2.\n\nSuccess in Asia[]\n\nRoddick captured his 26th ATP title in Beijing at the China Open on September 28, 2008. He defeated Dudi Sela of Israel, 6–4, 6–7, 6–3. The victory was part of Roddick's strong showing in Asia, as he reached the semifinal round of the AIG Japan Open, where he lost to eventual champion Tomáš Berdych, after squandering a 5–3 lead in the third and deciding set. In the third round of the Madrid Masters, he lost to Gaël Monfils in three sets, 4–6, 6–3, 3–6. Two weeks later, Roddick reached the quarterfinals of the Paris Masters by defeating Gilles Simon, 6–3, 7–5, before losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Due to his performance in the tournament, Roddick automatically qualified for the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup. At the Masters Cup in Shanghai, he played Andy Murray in his first round-robin match and lost, 4–6, 6–1, 1–6. He was then scheduled to play Roger Federer, but retired due to an ankle injury and was replaced by Radek Štěpánek.\n\nReturn to form in 2009[]\n\nRoddick hired Larry Stefanki as his new coach and started working with him on December 1, 2008. Stefanki had previously trained John McEnroe, Marcelo Ríos, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Fernando González, and Tim Henman. Under Stefanki's guidance, both Rios and Kafelnikov rose to world the no. 1 ranking, and Henman and González reached the top five, including a 2007 Australian Open runner-up finish by Gonzalez.\n\nRoddick began official tournament competition at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open. He defeated Gaël Monfils in the semifinals, 7–6, 3–6, 6–3, before losing to Andy Murray in the final. At the Australian Open, Roddick defeated Xavier Malisse in the second round, 4–6, 6–2, 7–6, 6–2. After victories over Fabrice Santoro and 21st-seeded Tommy Robredo, Roddick played the defending champion and world no. 3 Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. Djokovic retired in the fourth set while trailing, 6–7, 6–4, 6–2, 2–1, which allowed Roddick to reach the fourth Australian Open semifinal of his career. Roddick was defeated there by eventual runner-up Roger Federer, 2–6, 5–7, 5–7.\n\nHis next tournament was the SAP Open in San Jose, U.S. He snapped a three-match losing streak against Tommy Haas in the quarterfinals, 7–5, 6–4, before losing in the semifinals to Radek Štěpánek for the first time in his career, 3–6, 7–6, 6–4. At the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis, U.S., Roddick defeated Australian Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals, 2–6, 7–6, 6–4, to reach the final. He took his first title of the year by beating Štěpánek in the final, 7–5, 7–5.\n\nRoddick chose not to defend his Dubai title, with prize money of $2 million, to protest the refusal of the United Arab Emirates to grant Israeli Shahar Pe'er a visa for the Women's Tennis Association event.[14][15] \"I really didn't agree with what went on over there\", Roddick said.[14][15]\n\nRoddick played both of the spring ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events in the U.S. He was seeded seventh at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. He defeated defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, 6–3, 6–2. His run was ended by world no. 1 Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, 4–6, 6–7. However, he won the doubles title with partner Mardy Fish. It was his fourth doubles title overall and his second partnering Fish. At the Miami Masters, Roddick beat ninth-seeded Gaël Monfils in the fourth round, 7–6, 6–2, to secure a place in the quarterfinals, where he lost to Roger Federer, 3–6, 6–4, 4–6.\n\nAfter a break from tournament tennis to get married, Roddick returned to action at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 clay-court event in Madrid. In his first match, Roddick survived two match points in the second-set tiebreaker to defeat Tommy Haas, 1–6, 7–6, 6–4. In the quarterfinals, Roddick again lost to Federer, 7–5, 6–7, 6–1. Roddick had his career-best result at the French Open, when he defeated Marc Gicquel in the third round.

Stay in school kids or you'll end up being an umpire.\"[30]\n\nHe lost his temper again at the 2010 Australian Open, but later admitted to his mistake[31] and later again that year launched into a tirade at a female official over a foot fault call, at the 2010 US Open, a match he eventually lost to Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic.[32] 2011 saw Andy throwing another tantrum and snapping at the chair umpire at Indian Wells on his way to losing to Richard Gasquet.[33]\n\nAt the 2011 Cincinnati Masters, Roddick was given a penalty point, which resulted in a critical break of serve in favor of Philipp Kohlschreiber, Roddick's opponent in the second round. The penalty point was given due to ball abuse, when Roddick smashed a ball into the stands in frustration, after he had already been warned earlier in the match by umpire Carlos Bernardes for an episode of racquet abuse. This triggered another series of altercations with the umpire, with Roddick expressing his displeasure at the umpire's call. Roddick subsequently lost the match to Kohlschreiber and suffered an early exit from the tournament.[34] At the 2011 China Open in Beijing, Andy Roddick was asked by the Chinese press about his potential retirement, given his drop in the rankings. Roddick refused to answer.\n\nRoddick, however, is also known for his funny on-court behavior and witty answers off-court in interviews and press conferences.[35] He and Novak Djokovic are especially known for imitating players, with both doing impersonations of Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, and each other. Roddick was also coached by Jimmy Connors for two years, who was known for his flamboyant personality during his playing career.\n\nEquipment[]\n\nRoddick uses a discontinued version of the Babolat Pure Drive, extended to 27.5 inches. The racquet itself is heavily customised with additional weight placed in the head via the use of lead tape. The resulting racquet exhibits a more head heavy balance point and a higher swingweight than the stock model with a higher overall weight, though this is similar to the model he endorses at approximately 12 oz. Modifications of this sort are common for professional players.\n\nRoddick's racquets are painted to resemble the Pure Drive Roddick GT Plus in order to market the current model of the same name which Babolat sells. The cortex in particular is visibly painted onto the racquet. For marketing purposes Roddick endorses the Pure Drive Roddick GT Plus Cortex Racquet, a signature racquet designed for him by racquet sponsor Babolat, which is slightly heavier (11.9 oz), stiffer (Babolat RDC index 72), and longer (27.5\") than the standard Pure Drive Series (11.3 oz, Babolat RDC 71, 27\"). The racquet is designed for a strong service due to its weight, stiffness, and length.[36] According to Tennis Warehouse, it is the best one for this fundamental stroke. He strings with a custom hybrid (RPM Blast + VS Gut). Roddick previously used Babolat Pro Hurricane Tour and Babolat Revenge (used only for a short period of time) as his mains, until he began using Babolat's new string, RPM Blast. Roddick's tensions varies, he strings roughly at 65 lbs.\n\nRoddick also uses Babolat Propulse III tennis shoes, which are his signature gear.[37] In matches, Roddick wears shirts, shorts, and caps manufactured for him by Lacoste.\n\nPlaying style[]\n\nRoddick's serve is known for its power, usually serving at around 130–150 mph (209~242 km/h), often resulting in unhittable serves (aces).[38] Roddick's favorite shot is his off-forehand which he uses in combination with his kicker out wide. In the past, Roddick used to play his off-forehand frequently but has since adjusted and used it to create points. He usually targets the two corners to win aces. As for his second serve, he usually employs a heavy kick serve, then tries to use a variety of spins, slices, and angles in the rally to throw off his opponent. He is noted to use heavy topspin on both his serves and his twist serve is particularly high kicking.[39]\n\nRoddick will also occasionally use the serve-and-volley tactic on both first and second services to surprise his opponent, though he generally prefers to remain near the baseline after a serve. He has developed a more all-court playing style compared to the aggressive baseline style he played with for most of his early career. Although Roddick's backhand is still a weakness today, it is considered to have improved somewhat in 2009 under Stefanki's guidance.[40]\n\nMedia appearances[]\n\nOn April 5, 2002, Roddick guest-starred on the television show Sabrina the Teenage Witch as himself. In the episode, Sabrina summoned him so he could give her tennis lessons.[41][42]\n\nRoddick appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn in 2002 and 2003, Late Show with David Letterman in 2003 and 2009, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and Live with Regis and Kelly in 2003, Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2004 and 2005, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2005 and 2007, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2006.[41] Roddick also appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2007 and 2010.\n\nRoddick hosted Saturday Night Live on November 8, 2003, becoming the second professional tennis player to host (Chris Evert being the first during the show's 15th season) and the first (and, as of May 2012, only) male tennis player to host.[43]\n\nRoddick also appeared on a 2004 episode of the Anne Robinson version of The Weakest Link, but ended up being voted off.[44]\n\nRoddick is in a This is SportsCenter ad with Stuart Scott, in which he confronts the Sports Center anchor about the anchors not calling him \"A-Rod\", and asks him \"Did Alex Rodriguez put you up to this?\" Scott replies \"Who?\" Roddick says \"A-Rod!\" Scott gets a sneaky look on his face, and Roddick leaves disgusted.\n\nThe June/July issue of Men's Fitness magazine carried an article on Roddick. The cover shot featured the tennis ace in a t-shirt, straining to contain massive, pumped-up biceps and hulking shoulder and chest muscles. The image set off widespread online speculation that the magazine had altered Roddick's likeness, a suspicion echoed by Roddick himself. Roddick has quipped that he saw the photo, and that \"Nadal wanted his arms back.\"[45]\n\nIn March 2009, Andy Roddick appeared in the \"Speed Feels Better\" music video for singer/songwriter Michael Tolcher. Other athletes in the video included Amanda Beard, Barry Sanders, Kimmie Meissner, and Rick Ankiel.\n\nAndy Roddick played tennis while using a frying pan instead of a racquet for the book \"Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan\" by Todd Gallagher.[46]\n\nIn 2011, Roddick made a cameo at the end of the film Just Go With It, as the new lover of the film's jilted bride (played by Brooklyn Decker, his actual wife).\n\nRadio hosting career and retirement[]\n\nIn 2011 Roddick co-hosted a radio show for one day on Fox Sports Radio with his good friend Bobby Bones of the Bobby Bones Show.[47]\n\nDue to the success of that one-time show, Fox Sports Radio offered Andy and Bobby a nationally syndicated sports radio show. The show debuted on January 7, 2012. The show can be heard nationally on Saturdays from noon to 3 pm CST. The show is a mix of sports, pop culture and entertainment.[48][49]\n\nAn interview with his wife, Brooklyn, gave on February 16, 2012, Roddick first hinted at plans on retiring within two years and turning the radio show into a daily show and into his new career.[50]\n\nOn his birthday, August 30, 2012, Andy announced his plans to retire after the US Open. On September 4-5, he played his last match against Juan Martin del Potro. The match was suspended after the first point of a first-set tiebreak due to rain, with Roddick winning. However, when the match was resumed the next day, del Potro gained the momentum, which he never relinquished.\n\nAwards and records[]\n\nIn 2004, Roddick produced what was then the fastest serve in professional tennis: 249.4 km/h (155 mph) during a Davis Cup semi-final match with Vladimir Voltchkov on hard court in Charleston. Roddick's record serve has since been superseded by Ivo Karlović, who served at 251 km/h (156 mph) playing at the Davis Cup in March 2011.[51] Roddick also had the fastest serve in U.S. Open history: 244 km/h (152 mph) against American Scoville Jenkins.[52] Roddick also won the 2004 ESPY Award for Best Male Tennis Player.\n\nThat same year he won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award of the Year because of his charity efforts, which included: raising money for the survivors of the tsunami following 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake through Serving for Tsunami Relief and other efforts; auctioning off several rackets and autographs to raise money for UNICEF; and creating the Andy Roddick Foundation to help at-risk youth. The foundation is partly funded through the sale of blue wristbands inscribed \"No Compromise\", inspired by Lance Armstrong's yellow Livestrong wristbands.\n\nIn 2007 Roddick and the Andy Roddick Foundation was awarded by the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health. Roddick was the first male tennis player ever to receive the award.\n\nServe records:\n\nFastest serve in Australian open: 148 mph.\n\nFastest serve in Dubai: 150 mph.\n\nFastest average in first serve: 134 mph.\n\nFastest serve in Beijing: 148 mph.\n\nFastest serve in San Jose: 150 mph.\n\nFastest serve in Madrid: 151 mph.\n\nFastest serve in Washington: 151 mph.\n\nFastest serve in Queens: 153 mph.\n\nFastest serve in Lyon: 142 mph.\n\nFastest serve in Roland Garros: 144 mph (2006–2010).\n\nFastest serve in Wimbledon: 143 mph (2011)\n\nCareer statistics[]\n\nGrand Slam tournament performance timeline[]\n\nMain article: Andy Roddick career statistics\n\nTournament 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 SR W–L Grand Slam tournaments Australian Open A A 2R SF QF SF 4R SF 3R SF QF 4R 2R 0 / 11 38–11 French Open A 3R 1R 1R 2R 2R 1R 1R A 4R 3R A 1R 0 / 10 9–10 Wimbledon A 3R 3R SF F F 3R QF 2R F 4R 3R 3R 0 / 12 41–12 US Open 1R QF QF W QF 1R F QF QF 3R 2R QF 4R 1 / 13 43–12 Win–Loss 0–1 8–3 7–4 17–3 15–4 12–4 11–4 13–4 7–3 16–4 10–4 9–3 6–4 1 / 46 131–45\n\nFinals: 5 (1 title, 4 runners-up)\n\nOutcome Year Championship Surface Opponent Score Winner 2003 US Open Hard Template:Flagicon Juan Carlos Ferrero 6–3, 7–6(7–2), 6–3 Runner-up 2004 Wimbledon Grass Template:Flagicon Roger Federer 6–4, 5–7, 6–7(3–7), 4–6 Runner-up 2005 Wimbledon Grass Template:Flagicon Roger Federer 2–6, 6–7(2–7), 4–6 Runner-up 2006 US Open Hard Template:Flagicon Roger Federer 2–6, 6–4, 5–7, 1–6 Runner-up 2009 Wimbledon Grass Template:Flagicon Roger Federer 7–5, 6–7(6–8), 6–7(5–7), 6–3, 14–16\n\nMasters Series[]\n\nFinals: 9 (5 titles, 4 runners-up)\n\nOutcome Year Championship Surface Opponent Score Runner-up 2002 Canada (Toronto) (1) Hard Template:Flagicon Guillermo Cañas 4–6, 5–7 Winner 2003 Montreal Hard Template:Flagicon David Nalbandian 6–1, 6–3 Winner 2003 Cincinnati Hard Template:Flagicon Mardy Fish 4–6, 7–6(7–3), 7–6(7–4) Winner 2004 Miami Hard Template:Flagicon Guillermo Coria 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 6–1, ret.
