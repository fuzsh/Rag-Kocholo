        "text": "ATP World Tour Finals\n\nVenue: O2 Arena, London Date: 22-29 November\n\nBBC TV coverage: BBC Two, 22/28/29 November, 1430 GMT\n\nRoddick reached the Tour Finals semi-final in 2003, 2004 and 2007\n\nWorld number six Andy Roddick has secured his place at the ATP World Tour Finals in London next month.\n\nDespite withdrawing from the Shanghai Masters last week with a knee injury the 27-year-old has amassed enough points to book a place at the O2 Arena.\n\nThe American is the sixth confirmed qualifier for the season-ending event running from 22-29 November.\n\n\"I've always had great support in London and I'm looking forward to being back there in November,\" said Roddick.\n\nThis is the seventh successive year Roddick has earned a berth at the season finale and he joins Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Juan Martin del Potro in qualifying for the event.\n\nNebraska-born Roddick was forced to retire during his second-round match with Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka in China, with subsequent MRI Scans revealing a mild ligament strain to his knee.\n\nHowever, the 2009 Wimbledon runner-up has been declared fit and is relishing a return to London.\n\n606: DEBATE\n\nMrInvisible\n\n\"The reaction I received from fans after the Wimbledon final was something I will never forget,\" added Roddick. \"This will be a fantastic event.\"\n\nRoddick is expected to play in the season's penultimate event, the Paris Masters, which starts on 8 November, where the final two places for London are likely to be decided.\n\nRussian Nikolay Davydenko and Spaniard Fernando Verdasco currently fill the seventh and eighth spots on the list but are being pursued by a chasing pack that includes Swede Robin Soderling, Chilean Fernando Gonzalez and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France."
