        "text": "Throughout the history of the game, there have been many U.S. champions who have won on both the amateur and professional stages.\n\nFor a long time, starting in the 1920s and extending through the 1960s, a player had to choose to be either amateur or professional. Without turning pro, the player could not win prize money.\n\nThis fissure divided the men's tour, ensuring that the best players did not face each other on the greatest tennis stages—mainly the four annual Grand Slam tournaments which remained strictly amateur.\n\nThat ended in 1968, when the \"Open Era\" in U.S. tennis swept the old system out. But it made comparing players across eras difficult because essentially some were playing in a system most do not comprehend today.\n\nWith the formation of the ATP, all players met on the same stage able to compete in all events, soon winning adequate prize money.\n\nThroughout the years, before and after the Open Era, some U.S. champions changed the game with innovative approaches as well as humanitarian efforts off court. Some simply played the game more successfully than others of his era.\n\nThese factors entered into the this ranking of the top U.S. men of all time—including the recently retired Andy Roddick.\n\n“Little Bill” Johnston was a popular and very successful tennis player in the early days of the 20th century.\n\nHe was considered the best tennis player from the United States until “Big Bill” Tilden took over that spot and began to defeat Johnston regularly.\n\nJohnston began playing tennis at a very young age—picking up a racket when he was just nine years old in 1903. He played tennis for the love of the game and turned down the chance offered to him to turn pro.\n\nOften Johnston's slight frame and his frail health deceived opponents because Johnston possessed a wicked forehand, which was long considered the best of all time until Pancho Segura introduced the two-handed forehand into the game.\n\nTilden and Johnston battled it out in six U.S. Open Championships against each other with Tilden winning five of them.\n\nTogether they also secured seven consecutive U.S. Davis Cup Championships which remains a record today.\n\nIn addition to winning two U.S. Open Championships in 1915 and 1919, Johnston also won the Wimbledon trophy in 1923.\n\nJack Kramer won the U.S. Championships in 1946 and 1947, defeating fellow American Tom Brown in 1946 and another countryman, Frank Parker in 1947.\n\nHe also won the Wimbledon Championships in 1947, defeating Australian Thomas Brown.\n\nHe rose to the No. 1 ranking during the 1940s.\n\nBut it was outside the tennis courts that Kramer had the most impact on the game.\n\nWhen the final page is written, Kramer probably did more for modern tennis than anyone living or dead.\n\nKramer fought hard to establish “Open” tennis for amateurs and professionals so that there was only one tour and the best tennis players met and played each other for equal prize money.\n\nIt took him until 1968 to usher in the “Open” era in tennis.\n\nIn the early days, once a player turned professional he could no longer compete at the slams. Very often the best players were absent from those important and historic events.\n\nKramer also was responsible for founding the ATP.\n\nAt 6'2,\" Kramer was one of the forefathers of the style of play that many modern players adopted—the serve and volley.\n\nHis powerful serve and his net play made many regard him as one the best tennis players ever on the men’s side of the game.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion Andy Roddick began playing professional tennis in 2000 at age 18.\n\nHe won his only grand slam championship in 2003, defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the finals of the U.S. Open. He ascended to the No. 1 ranking in November of 2003.\n\nRoddick also reached three finals at Wimbledon in 2004, 2005 and in 2009 where he lost each time to world No. 1 Roger Federer.\n\nPerhaps Roddick’s greatest contribution to U.S. tennis came during his participation in Davis Cup competition where the big serving Roddick helped keep the U.S. competitive, starting in 2001.\n\nThe U.S. Davis Cup team enjoyed their biggest triumph in 2007 when they faced Russia in Portland, Oregon, with a team which had Roddick as its undisputed leader.\n\nRoddick won the first point in the final and set the USA’s 32nd victory in the competition into motion. The match ended in a convincing 4-1 scoreline. Team USA had won the Davis Cup.\n\nIn total Roddick played in 45 matches in 25 ties—his record stands at 33-12.\n\nRoddick emerged on the scene during a major paradigm shift in men's tennis. The glory of days of serve and volley tennis essentially died with Pete Sampras. The game of big serves and minimal strokes would end as technology enhanced rackets and the courts slowed.\n\nRoddick's game was already fixed and suited his talents. Even though he worked tirelessly to improve his ground strokes and his movement, he never quite mastered them well enough after 2003 to reach to the top again.\n\nBut Roddick remained in the men's top ten for a over decade and kept tennis alive and kicking in the U.S.\n\nEllsworth Vines played tennis in the 1930s when he was ranked world No. 1 for four years.\n\nAs an amateur, Vines won the U.S. Open in 1931, defeating George Lott 7-9, 6-3, 9-7, 7-5. The 1931 Championship was played at the West Side Tennis Club on grass.\n\nThe following year, Vines won the U.S. title again—this time over famed Frenchman Henri Cochet 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nJust prior to the Open, Vines had captured the Wimbledon title in 1932, defeating Brit Bunny Austin in the final 6-4, 6-2, 6-0. He also reached the Wimbledon finals in 1933, losing to Aussie Jack Crawford.\n\nVines advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 1933; but he never played the French Open.\n\nHe also won five Pro-Slam tournaments in 1934, 1935, 1936, and 1939.\n\nVines was more than likely the most exotic and eccentric of all of the professional tennis players of his era.\n\nHe possessed unlimited talent, according to contemporaries and biographers, but he grew bored with tennis in his late twenties and retired to begin a career playing professional golf.\n\nBorn in 1915, American Don Budge ascended to the No. 1 ranking, holding onto the top spot for five years.\n\nHe was the first man in tennis history to win a calendar year grand slam. He completed the sweep in 1938—winning the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals.\n\nHe did all of this while turning age 23 in June.\n\nIn fact, Budge won the U.S. Nationals in 1937 and 1938 and played in the finals in 1936, losing to Fred Perry 2-6, 6-2, 8-6, 1-6, 10-8.\n\nIn 1937 Budge defeated Gottfried von Cramm in the finals to win his first U.S. National Championships title (U.S. Open). The following year Budge defeated Gene Mako in the finals.\n\nIn all he played in the Open five times, winning twice, ending with a winning percentage of 88.46.\n\nBudge also won Wimbledon in 1937 and 1938.\n\nLike many of the greats of this era, once Budge turned professional, his participation in the slams ceased.\n\nAccording to his contemporaries, Budge was one of the greatest of all time.\n\nPancho Gonzalez made the most of his amazing skills on the tennis court.\n\nRising from poverty and largely self-taught, Gonzalez became one of the best tennis pros in the history of the game.\n\nHe was ranked as the top U.S. professional for an astounding eight years, winning 15 Pro-Slam titles.\n\nGonzalez won the U.S. Open in both 1948-1949. But he turned pro shortly after winning his second title at the West Side Tennis Club.\n\nGonzalez would not return to the any Grand Slam venue until the “Open Era” began in 1968. By then, Gonzalez had just turned 40 years of age.\n\nAt the French Open in 1968, Gonzalez reached the semifinals. He reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in 1969 as well as the third round at the Australian Open.\n\nGonzalez is largely regarded as the best of his era by his contemporaries and by many sports writers.\n\nAndre Agassi appeared at the U.S. Open for 21 consecutive years with an 80.6 total winning percentage (79-19).\n\nAt age 16, in 1986 Agassi played his first U.S. Open. Twenty years later in 2006 at age 36, Agassi played his last. To the end Agassi remained a favorite of the New York crowds, who embraced this champion as they watched him mature.\n\nHis first U.S. Open victory came in 1994 as Agassi defeated German Michael Stich 6-1, 7-6, 7-5. Then in 1999, Agassi came out on top against fellow American Todd Martin 6-4, 6-7, 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 in a thrilling five-set match, which Agassi refused to lose.\n\nAgassi lost three times in finals to fellow American Pete Sampras in 1990, 1995, and 2002 when Sampras played his final match at the U.S. Open.\n\nAgassi also lost in his final appearance against Roger Federer in 2005 when Federer won his second consecutive New York title.\n\nAdditionally, Agassi won the French Open in 1999 over Andrei Medvedev in five tense sets. Even more surprisingly, Agassi took the Wimbledon title in 1992 over Goran Ivanisevic—again in five sets.\n\nOf course, Agassi won the Australian Open four times in 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2003. Plus he won a Gold Medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nAgassi will always be remembered for his competitive spirit, his brilliant return game, and his aggressive ground strokes. He exemplified the American fighting spirit—the athlete who refused to quit.\n\nHis complicated professional life in tennis, moreover, mirrored the path of many young men who come to prominence in their sport before they have the maturity to deal with all the fame.\n\nDespite his early mistakes, however, Agassi redeemed himself by reclaiming his sport and fighting to make it better by example.\n\nBecause of his later disgrace, Bill Tilden's amazing tennis triumphs too often remain buried in the past.\n\nIf it were not for Tilden's play during the 1920s, U.S. tennis would never have gained the popularity it achieved or, perhaps, never attracted the future talented players who came eagerly into the sport.\n\nTilden brought U.S. tennis to the world stage and made countries in Europe pay close attention to the Americans.\n\nHe was the first player from the U.S. to win Wimbledon. He would win three Wimbledon titles and the Brits grew to love the showy Tilden's attire and his lethal forehand.\n\nTilden was flamboyant, to say the least. Yet, perhaps, he was also one of the greatest ever to play the game from the United States—maybe from anywhere.\n\nFor 14 years, Tilden participated in what we call today the U.S. Open, seizing the title seven times. His winning percentage was fixed at 90.79.\n\nThroughout his playing career on the grass at Forest Hills, Tilden won the U.S. Open consecutively for six years from 1920-1925. He won his last Open in 1929 but played his last tournament in 1930 when he ended his amateur career.\n\nThough his life ended without honor and dignity, his tennis career should never be overlooked. He was one of the greatest U.S. Open champions to play the game.\n\nJimmy Connors was around for so long that everyone in the U.S. knew who he was whether they followed tennis or not.\n\nHe appeared to them as a man driven to win at all odds—an everyday \"Joe\" just trying to survive. Connors often pumped himself up by imagining that everything and everybody was against him. That mindset helped him to become a force in tennis for many, many years.\n\nConnors won five of his seven final appearances at the U.S. Open with an 85.2 total winning percentage (98-17).\n\nAgain, because he played so many years, Connors remains the only male player in the history of the Open to have won the title on three different surfaces—on grass, clay, and hard courts.\n\nHe won his first title in 1974 and his last in 1983. Connors played in 22 U.S. Opens starting in 1970 and ending in 1992 as he turned 40.\n\nJimbo loved playing in New York where he enjoyed his greatest successes. What he did not care for, however, was the lack of respect he detected from the American press when his career seemed down and out to them.\n\nIn 1974, Connors won three of the four majors, electing not to play at the French.\n\nIn his first U.S. Open final in 1974, he smacked down Ken Rosewall 6-1, 6-0, 6-1.\n\nHis next two wins in 1976 on clay and 1978 on hard courts came against another Connors arch-rival, Bjorn Borg.\n\nConnors went on to win two more finals against another No. 1 player—Ivan Lendl in 1982 and 1983. Lendl was just beginning his climb to world prominence in the early 1980s.\n\n\"Jimbo\" also lost two finals at the U.S. Open against Michael Orantes of Spain in 1975 and against Guillermo Vilas of Argentina in 1977.\n\nBesides his wins at the U.S. Open, Connors won the Australian Open in 1974 and the Wimbledon Championships in 1974 and 1982.\n\nConnors career extended from 1972 until 1996. He will always have a place in the hearts of Americans as one of their greatest players.\n\nAlthough most fans associate Sampras' success with Wimbledon, his record at the U.S. Open is truly remarkable.\n\nSampras appeared in eight U.S. Open finals, winning five of them, ending with an 88.75 winning percentage (71-9).\n\nIn the Open Era, Sampras, with five championships, remains tied with Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer for the most victories at the U.S. Open.\n\nSampras played at the U.S. Open 14 times, beginning in 1988, missing only one appearance in 1999 due to injury.\n\nSampras won his first major title at age 19 and his last at age 31, both at the U.S. Open.\n\nIn 1990, Sampras captured his first win over Andre Agassi in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. He won his second U.S. Open title in 1993 over France’s Cedric Pioline, seeded No. 15.\n\nSampras won back-to-back championships in 1995-1996, defeating fellow American Andre Agassi in 1995 followed by a win over Michael Chang in 1996.\n\nThe next U.S. Open title would not happen for six long years. 2002 marked Sampras' fifth and final U.S. Open. Standing across the net was the man he had beaten twice before for the title, Agassi. Sampras won that title 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.\n\nIn addition to winning the U.S. Open, Sampras won seven Wimbledon titles from 1993-2000, losing only once in the those years in 1996 to Richard Krajicek in the quarterfinals. He also won the Australian Open twice in 1994 and 1997.\n\nIn total, Sampras owns 14 Grand Slam titles in singles and was seeded world No. 1 for 286 weeks which remained the record until Roger Federer surpassed it in 2012.\n\nThere was no other American who achieved so much and held it for so long. Pete Sampras is one of the very best champions of U.S. tennis."
