        "text": "Jack Sock is a name well-known among the tennis world. After all, with 11 consecutive US Open qualifications, a Wimbledon Doubles title and an Olympic gold medal, how could he not be? At just 27 years old, Sock has become accustomed to competing on the world's stage; and now, he'll be adding a new venue to his long list of grandstands -- the Davidson Tennis Courts.\n\nSock first picked up a racket when he was 8 years old, and has accrued many titles and accolades since then. But, \"coach\" is a first for the Nebraska native, as Sock has officially joined the Davidson College men's tennis program as a volunteer assistant coach this fall.\n\nGrowing up in Lincoln, Neb., Sock had an \"unconventional\" route to competitive tennis, he says. While he and his brother, Eric, had quickly fallen in love with the sport, Lincoln wasn't exactly providing opportunities for the two to enhance their young promise. After finding a few tournaments to compete in, the Sock brothers were eventually invited to attend a tennis academy based out of Kansas City.\n\n\"My family had a big decision to make then,\" Sock recalls. \"Should we stay in our comfortable home, or take the biggest risk and move to KC to support a 'potential' future in tennis?\"\n\nOnce that decision was made, the Sock family packed up and moved the 191 miles to start a new, tennis-focused life in Kansas City. From there, Sock hit the ground running with his new coach, Mike Wolf, to whom he still credits today for his true foundation of the sport and style of play.\n\n\"I trained under Wolf, while also playing on my high school tennis team,\" Sock notes.\n\nYet another \"unconventional\" avenue for someone who now competes on the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour, as most pro tennis players forgo high school, and high school tennis, altogether.\n\nHowever, that decision paid off for Sock, too. He and Eric became state champions as a doubles team, and he finished his high school career with an 80-0 singles record.\n\nBut, making the tough choices wouldn't end there.\n\nDespite always planning on having a college tennis career, a 2010 title in the Junior Singles at the US Open reshaped Sock's mindset.\n\n\"Once again, I had yet another big decision to make; to return home to Lincoln and play for the Huskers [with his brother, Eric] or to turn pro,\" Sock said. \"With the support of my family we once again took a risk, and 11 years later I am still thankful for the overwhelming belief my family had in me to take that next step.\"\n\nNow in his 11th season as a professional tennis player, Sock has had a year unlike any other, as have most of us in 2020. But, for the 27-year-old who just recently moved to the Davidson area, had nearly six months off from professional competition, and is coaching collegiate tennis for the first time, the year has been anything but ordinary.\n\n\"[It] has been different to say the least,\" he jokes. \"I was able to take advantage of the time off to properly rest my body before training again. I was also able to really work on specific techniques and exercises to better equip my game, which I wouldn't have normally had the opportunity to do during a normal tennis season.\"\n\nAs Sock's decision to pursue his professional career left him without the chance to play at the collegiate level, his time now at Davidson will give him a glimpse into the only tier of the sport he has yet to face.\n\n\"I never got the college tennis experience so it will be fun for me to be a part of something with such camaraderie, and I'm really excited to bring any knowledge that I have acquired to the table and extend to the team,\" he adds.\n\nHe hopes to be a sounding board, leader, and role model for the Wildcats, while also continuing to train himself for whatever comes next.\n\n\"Having Jack around is already giving our guys a sense of confidence and understanding of what it means to play at the next level,\" said head coach Drew Barrett. \"He understands that you have to have fun while competing and it's helped our guys take a little pressure off themselves.\"\n\nSock is certainly no stranger to pressure; whether it's competing in last week's 140th edition of the US Open, taking on Andy Roddick on Arthur Ashe Stadium or making career defining decisions from day one, he always carries with him a positive mindset and a grateful attitude.\n\n\"I could've never imagined being in this position,\" he says. \"I am thankful everyday for the opportunities that God has allowed me.\""
