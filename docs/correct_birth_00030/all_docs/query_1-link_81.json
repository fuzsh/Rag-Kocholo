        "text": "NORMAN — To understand how John Roddick turned Oklahoma tennis from an afterthought to a powerhouse, you need only visit at the holidays.\n\nHe will go to his folks’ house. So will his brothers Lawrence and Andy — yes, that Andy Roddick — and without fail, there will be ping pong.\n\n“And it gets ugly,” John says.\n\nHe laughs.\n\n“Here we are ... three grown men arguing at a ping-pong table,” he says. “Everyone else in the house is embarrassed.”\n\nEyes will roll. Heads will shake. And yet, everyone in the house gets it. That’s because when you grow up Roddick, you grow up with a burning desire to win.\n\nJohn Roddick’s fire is fueling Sooner tennis.\n\nOn the day that OU continues a quest for the program’s first national title, it’s impossible to overstate how far the program has come under Roddick. When he arrived, the Sooners made the NCAA Tournament every few years but were never really a factor. But in his six seasons in Norman, they’ve been to the tournament every year and advanced to the round of 16 four times.\n\nLast year, they were the No. 2 overall seed in the tournament and finished as the national runner-up.\n\nThis year, they are the No. 1 overall seed.\n\nNo one in the crimson and cream is looking forward to the competition any more than the head coach.\n\n“If you watched my brother play at all ... he’s one of the best competitors,” John said of Andy, who won the 2003 U.S. Open and spent the better part of a year as the top-ranked player in the world. “That’s just how we work.\n\n“It’s almost borderline psychotic.”\n\nSit in Roddick’s office inside the football stadium, and you might not see psychotic. The walls are sparsely decorated. The shelves hold that NCAA runner-up trophy from last season and a few pictures that document a life in tennis.\n\nAnd the man behind the desk? He wears black-rimmed glasses and a crimson OU hat pulled low. He doesn’t jump out of his seat. He doesn’t bounce off the walls.\n\nBut get him talking about anything that involves winning and losing, and his fire is obvious.\n\nOn recruiting: “For coaches and teams, it’s part of the competition.”\n\nOn his first team at OU: “We never lost to a team ranked below us all year, which I always take pride in.”\n\nOn becoming great: “If you want to be elite at something, it’s an every-day thing whether you like it or not. Hard work’s a must. It always kind of drives me crazy when athletes say their coach is making them do stuff that’s too hard. Well, if you think it’s too hard, then you don’t want to be an elite athlete. It’s OK if you don’t want to do it, but your expectations need to be lower.”\n\nJohn comes by his competitiveness honestly. His parents, Jerry and Blanche, were born and raised in Platteville, Wis. Both played sports, but in a small town, they had to play pretty much everything. Neither focused on any particular sport.\n\nBut they were extremely competitive.\n\nTheir three boys realized as much when they were little. Jerry and Blanche, who settled in Omaha, Neb., had high expectations. It wasn’t enough, for example, for the boys’ grades to be good. They had to be great.\n\nThe Roddicks were always talking about setting the bar a little bit higher. Challenge yourself. Do better.\n\nLawrence, the oldest, took up diving and became one of the best divers in the country. He was an All-American at Nebraska and competed in the Olympic trials.\n\nTennis was the sport that captured the two younger Roddick boys, John first, then Andy. While they had different skills and strengths, they were obviously cut from the competitive cloth — and their fire wasn’t always pretty.\n\n(Remember the bit about borderline psychotic?)\n\nWhen John was 12 or so, his mom took him in to see his coach. The Roddicks were living in Austin where Jerry’s job had taken them, and Blanche had seen John spike a few too many rackets. She wanted him to knock it off.\n\n“Don’t beat it out of him,” the coach told Blanche. “By the time he’s 20, he’ll have it.”\n\n“Twenty?” she said. “That’s eight more years of this.”\n\n“As long as he’s improving and getting better ... ”\n\nJohn wasn’t allowed to be disrespectful in matches, but if he smashed a racket to smithereens or smacked a ball over the fence on occasion in practice, it wasn’t necessarily seen as a bad thing. That meant he wanted to win.\n\nWhen he opened his own tennis academy in Texas two decades later, he shared similar advice with parents.\n\n“Look, we’ll work on getting better and handling it better,” he would say, “but you don’t want your kid to lose that.”\n\nEven now, a racket helicoptered over the fence or a ball skied over the indoor facility isn’t always a problem.\n\nIn a match? Sure.\n\nIn practice? Nope.\n\n“Sometimes, kids that are that hyper-competitive need to have an outlet,” Roddick said.\n\nHe and his brothers channeled it, and in the end, that was one of the things that helped them became some of the best in their sports. Lawrence was a Division-I athlete. Ditto for John, who was a four-time All-American at Georgia. The only one of the three who didn’t manage a college scholarship was Andy, but with career earnings somewhere north of $20 million, it’s safe to say he did OK for himself.\n\nJohn Roddick has taken that never-want-to-lose attitude into everything related to Sooner tennis.\n\nRecruiting. Developing. Teaching.\n\nLook at the roster, and you’ll see players who came in with strong resumes but who have risen through the ranks. Axel Alvarez started as the Sooners’ No. 4 player, but now, he is not only the team’s top player but also the top-ranked player in the nation. The Sooners’ No. 2, Andrew Harris, started out at No. 4 and is expected to move into that top spot once Alvarez graduates.\n\nOn and on it goes.\n\n“We’re not looking for a No. 1 player (for next season in recruiting) because we know that there’s somebody that deserves it that’s already on our team,” Roddick said. “We take a lot of pride in that.”\n\nRoddick wants each and every one of his guys to strive for that top spot — there’s that competitiveness again — but he also sells them on the process. Improving every day. Dedicating effort and energy. Focusing not on wins and losses but on playing at a high level.\n\nHe realizes those aren’t always easy lessons for young players to accept. After all, they were hard for him.\n\n“I was a player that wanted it now, wanted success now,” he said, his eyes wide. “Still in life, I want everything now.”\n\nHe stopped short.\n\n“But you start realizing, you know what? The process is way more important.”\n\nJohn Roddick may preach the process and all that stuff that coaches like to talk about, but in those wide eyes, you could see a bit of that 12-year-old who used to spike tennis rackets. He’s still a competitor who fights over holiday ping pong.\n\nHe’s still a Roddick.\n\n“You hate to lose.”\n\nJenni Carlson: Jenni can be reached at (405) 475-4125 or jcarlson@oklahoman.com.
