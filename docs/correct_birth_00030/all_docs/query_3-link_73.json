He asserts that instead, champions are formed by a force that resides deep within them. Roddick suggests that the essence of a champion lies in their unwavering determination, resilience, and the mental strength to overcome obstacles. Physical strength and skill are undoubtedly crucial, but they do not encompass the entirety of a champion's makeup. It is the inner fire, the passion, and the relentless pursuit of excellence that drives champions to the pinnacle of success. Roddick's words remind us that true champions are not limited by external circumstances, but rather, they are fueled by an indomitable spirit that separates them from others.",
