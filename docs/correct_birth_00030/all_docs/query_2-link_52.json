        "text": "Andy Roddick is fondly remembered by many tennis fans for being one of the best of his generation. Back in 2012, the Nebraska native he announced his retirement, having achieved number 1 in the ATP ranking in 2003 as well as winning the US Open that same year. In 2017, he entered the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nMore than a decade after his retirement, the American is back in the limelight, and in an episode of his podcast, ‘Served’, he has broken the news that he suffers from skin cancer. “I’ve had to deal with several types of skin cancer since I stopped playing, I had a squamous cell tumor removed from my lip, probably five or six years ago, I’ve never talked about it,” he said.\n\nThe former tennis player also urges other players and especially parents of children embarking on the game to use sunscreen: “It stinks. I think I’m going to be kind of a general hatchet job for the rest of my life. I’m not going to get into the ‘woe is me’ part, because nothing is wrong and everything is good, but use sunscreen. Put sun protection on your children, especially if they are tennis players. The problem will not occur when the child is eight years old, but it could occur when that child has grown up and is 38″."
