        "text": "What Is Andy Roddick's Net Worth?\n\nAndy Roddick is a retired American professional tennis player who has a net worth of $40 million. Andy Roddick is a former World Number 1 tennis player. His 2003 US Open title makes him the last American male to have won a grand slam event. He was briefly ranked #1 in the world and held the title for one week. Andy made it to the finals at Wimbledon three times and to the semi-finals at various other tournaments. He also has a beautiful wife, Brooklyn Decker, a former \"Sports Illustrated\" Swimsuit model and actress. As a right handed player, he was known for his fast services and powerful groundstroke. As an ATP tour player, Andy earned just over $20.6 million in tournament prizes. He has earned tens of millions more from endorsements. During his career, Andy Roddick won 32 titles and went 612-213 for a 74.18% winning percentage.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAndy Roddick was born on August 30, 1982, in Omaha, Nebraska. He grew up in Austin, Texas, and Boca Raton, Florida. He took high school classes online through the University of Nebraska High School. His tennis idol growing up was Andre Agassi, and for a brief time as a teenager, he trained intermittently with Venus and Serena Williams.\n\nCareer\n\nRoddick played competitive tennis all throughout his childhood and teenage years but considered quitting at age 17 when he had a losing streak in the juniors. His coach, Tarik Benhabiles, talked him into giving tennis another go for just four more months. He ended up finishing as the number six junior in the U.S. in 1999 and as the number one junior player in the world in 2000. As a junior, Roddick won the US Open and Australian Open junior singles titles, and he won six world junior singles titles and seven world junior doubles titles.\n\nAndy turned pro in 2001 at age 18 after graduating from high school. He clinched his Grand Slam singles championship with his 2003 US Open win. During this period, Andy was coached by Brad Gilbert. Roddick reached the finals of four more Grand Slams but lost to Roger Federer in each one. At age 21, Andy reached the World No. 1 ranking on November 3, 2003, the same year he reached his first Master Series title. He became the youngest American to hold the number 1 world rank since the ranking system started in 1973. His reign at No. 1 ended the following February when Roger Federer ascended to the top position after winning his first Australian Open. Roddick advanced in June of 2004 to his first Wimbledon final. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Roddick lost to Fernando Gonzalez in the third round. Andy finished 2004 ranked as No. 2 in the world and No. 1 in the U.S. The following year, Roddick lost to Federer in the final at Wimbledon for the second year in a row.\n\nRoddick began 2007 as the sixth seed at the Australian Open. He continued his season with a string of injuries. At the Miami Masters, he gave up his quarterfinal match against Andy Murray due to a hamstring injury. He was seeded third at the French Open but was eliminated in the fourth round. At Wimbledon, Roddick was seeded third and reached the quarterfinals before losing to Richard Gasquet of France. During the summer season, Andy played four tournaments in four weeks. Although he started out 2008 strong, Roddick was forced to pull out of the 2008 French Open due to a shoulder injury. At Wimbledon, he was beaten by Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic at his earliest exit at a Wimbledon match. He chose not to participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics but instead to concentrate on the 2008 U.S. Open. He captured his 28th ATP title in Beijing at the China Open in September and lost to Andy Murray at the Master's Cup in Shanghai.\n\nIt wasn't until 2011 that Roddick fell out of the top ten players in the world after spending nine years in a row within the list. In 2012, he began his London Olympics with a victory over Martin Klizan. In the second round, Andy lost to the number two player in the world at that time, Novak Djokovic. After the Olympics, he decided not to play in Toronto and went straight to the Cincinnati tournament, where he lost in the first round to Jeremy Chardy.\n\nDuring the 2012 US Open, on his 30th birthday, Andy Roddick announced that he would be retiring after the tournament. He began his campaign with a victory over Rhyne Williams. He then went on to defeat Australian Bernard Tomic and Italian Fabio Fognini before his final match on September 5, 2012, which ended in a loss to Argentine Juan Martín del Potro. Four days after his loss, Roddick was honored in a special ceremony in Arthur Ashe Stadium for his retirement, in which Andre Agassi participated in. Due to his retirement, Roddick ended the year at number 38. In July 2017, Roddick was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nRadio Career\n\nRoddick co-hosted a radio show in 2011 for one day on Fox Sports Radio with his friend Bobby Bones of the \"Bobby Bones Show.\" Due to the success of the one-time show, Fox Sports Radio offered Roddick and Bones a nationally syndicated sports radio show. It debuted on January 7, 2012. The following month, Roddick interviewed his wife, Brooklyn, on the radio show, and it was during that interview that he first revealed his plans to retire and turn the radio show into a daily show and his new career. In 2015, he joined the BBC as a pundit and commentator for the 2015 Wimbledon Championships.\n\nOther Ventures and Appearances\n\nRoddick guest-starred as himself in 2002 on the TV show \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch.\" He made appearances on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn\" in 2002 and 2003, \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" in 2003 and 2009, \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" and \"Live with Regis and Kelly\" in 2003, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in 2004 and 2005, \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" in 2005 and 2007, and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in 2006. Andy hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2003, becoming only the second professional tennis player to ever host. In March 2009, Roddick appeared in the \"Speed Feels Better\" music video for singer-songwriter Michael Tolcher. In 2011, Andy made a cameo at the end of the film \"Just Go With It,\" as the new lover of the film's jilted bride, played by his wife, Brooklyn Decker. In 2019, he appeared on \"Celebrity Family Feud.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAfter his retirement from tennis, Roddick now focuses on his foundation, the Andy Roddick Foundation, which seeks to ensure kids in low-income areas have opportunities to reach their full potential through education and sports-based mentoring.\n\nAndy Roddick has been married to \"Sports Illustrated\" swimwear model and actress Brooklyn Decker since 2009. The couple has two children, and the family resides in Austin, TX.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2001, Andy bought a modest home in Boca Raton, Florida, for $310,000. He sold the home in 2012 for $350,000.\n\nA year before marrying, Brooklyn and Andy paid $1.1 million for a NYC apartment.\n\nIn November 2009, just a few months after marrying, Andy and Brooklyn paid an undisclosed amount for a 1.8-acre lakefront property in Austin. They listed the property, which has a nearly 9,000-square-foot home, for sale in 2013 for $12.5 million. They did not find a buyer and ultimately pulled the listing.\n\nIn 2012, Brooklyn and Andy paid $300,000 for a 2.75-acre property in North Carolina.\n\nIn July 2013, they paid $3.7 million for a 15-acre property in Austin. They proceeded to custom build a mansion on the lot. They tried to sell this home in 2018 for $6 million. They accepted $4.65 million in September 2019."
