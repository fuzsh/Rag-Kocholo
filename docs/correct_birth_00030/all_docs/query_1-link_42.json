        "text": "Andy Roddick is an American former world No. 1 professional tennis player.\n\nRoddick became world No. 1 shortly after he won the title at the 2003 US Open, defeating French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final and overtaking him as the top-ranked player in the process. Despite several more years as one of the world's best players, the 2003 US Open title would remain his only Grand Slam triumph. He is the most recent North American male player to win a Grand Slam singles event, reach the top ranking, and claim the year-end world No. 1 ranking (2003). Roddick reached four other Grand Slam finals (Wimbledon in 2004, 2005, and 2009, and the US Open in 2006), losing to Roger Federer every time. Roddick was ranked in the year-end top 10 for nine consecutive years (2002-2010) and won five Masters Series titles in that period.\n\nOn August 30, 2012, during the 2012 US Open and on his 30th birthday, Roddick announced that he would retire after the tournament. Following a fourth-round defeat by Juan Martin del Potro, Roddick retired from the sport to focus on his work at the Andy Roddick Foundation."
