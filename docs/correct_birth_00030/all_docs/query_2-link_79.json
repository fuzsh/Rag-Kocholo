        "text": "Andy Roddick walked up to Patrick McEnroe in the locker room after losing in the third round at Wimbledon to eventual champion Goran Ivanesivic in June. The 18-year-old Roddick was bounced in the third round at the French Open, too. “No way I’m losing in the third round at the Open, I’ll tell you that!,” Roddick barked at McEnroe.\n\nIt was another moment of raw emotion from the outgoing teen predicted to be on the verge of carrying American tennis, taking the mantle away from Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi and taking away the spotlight from the star-studded women.\n\nThe search for the Next Great American Men’s Tennis Player has seen its share of false alarms. Did somebody say Justin Gimelstob? With Sampras and Agassi in their career twilights, American tennis desperately needs Roddick to be their next superstar. Because he is loaded with charisma, tennis officials are praying it’s him.\n\nSeeded 18th in the U.S. Open that begins tomorrow, Roddick has won three ATP titles this year, including Washington last Sunday. No American teenager has won more titles in a year since Sampras in 1990, when he happened to win his first Open. Roddick, who turns 19 in the middle of the two-week Open, entered last year’s Open ranked 338. He now goes in ready to steal the show.\n\n“He’s got it all – intensity, the game, motivation, attitude, loves to play, loves to compete, he’s fun to watch,” said Patrick McEnroe, the U.S. Davis Cup coach. “He’s brought a huge burst of fresh air into tennis, especially in this country. We’re always looking for someone to step up and be a legit Top 5 player. Not only has he done it, he’s done it with flair. He plays with passion. He’s got an attitude that, ‘I love to be out here, I want to put on a show and I want to win.'”\n\nHe wears his hat backwards so often during matches that Nike designed a Roddick hat with its logo on the back. “I definitely have some goofball in me but at the same time when it comes to being on the court, I’m pretty tenacious,” said Roddick, the first American teenager to be ranked in the Top 20 since Michael Chang in 1992.\n\nA class clown in high school, he displays Jimmy Connors-like, oncourt theatrics. He wears his emotions on his white, sweaty sleeve. Though he moved to the tennis haven of Boca Raton eight years ago, he hails from Omaha, Neb., and his bedroom is completely wallpapered with Nebraska football posters.\n\nThe Roddick hysteria recently landed him on the Late, Late Show with Craig Kilborn and he threw out the first pitch at a Reds’ game. “I think I still smile a lot on the court and it’s obvious that I’m having a good time,” Roddick said.\n\nRoddick is loaded with personality and a 140-mph and big forehand. Roddick beat Sampras in straight sets at the Ericsson Open last spring after which Pistol Pete said the American tennis’ future was in good hands.\n\nAt the Hamlet Cup this week, Sampras told The Post, “I think we’re looking at the real thing. I really do. I’ve played Andy and he plays well on every surface. When I look at a young guy coming up, I look at a weapon. He’s got that big serve that’s going to win him a lot of free points. He’s got good groundstrokes, competes well, has a good attitude out there. We’re going to see a lot of big things to come in the near future.”\n\nIs the future now? “You never know,” Sampras said. “Look what happened to me at 19 when I won the Open. I was 12th in the world and, boom, I won the Open. It’s possible with that serve and the courts being a little quicker, he could get hot.”\n\nSampras never looked as if he was having fun on the court, which some blamed for the nosedive men’s tennis took in comparison to the soaring women. If Roddick rises to the top, his personality alone can vault the men over the women again. John McEnroe calls him an “entertainer.” Patrick McEnroe expects Roddick to climb into the Top 5 within a year. “It’s just a matter time,” Little Mac said. “He’s got a little bit of [Boris] Becker in him and the intensity of my brother. He’s like Becker when he was young and burst out at Wimbledon. He came up and hit the ball a ton, served bombs. Roddick is like the new version of that. And he has it upstairs. He’s very mentally tough.”\n\n“If I don’t make it as big as Pete and Andre, which I probably won’t considering they’re two of the greatest ever, it’s not going to be because of lack of hard work or effort on my part,” Roddick said.\n\nAt Washington’s draw last week, Roddick performed a routine with hitting partners, the Bryans. “I love music and I think it brings out the best in everybody,” Roddick said. “It sets a mood and makes for a fun atmosphere.”\n\nThe stage is set for Roddick to make sweet music at Flushing Meadows.\n\n———\n\nTHE RODDICK FILE\n\nFavorite music group: Janet Jackson.\n\nFavorite sports team: Nebraska Cornhuskers.\n\nFavorite actor: Jim Carrey.\n\nFavorite actress: Julia Roberts.\n\nFavorite movie: Ace Ventura.\n\nWomen’s celebrity would most like to meet: Britney Spears.\n\nFavorite book: Harry Potter series.\n\nHobby: Listening to all kinds of music.\n\nFavorite restaurant: Waffle House, Baja Cafe in Boca Raton.\n\nFavorite tennis player growing up: Andre Agassi.\n\nFavorite athlete: Lance Armstrong.\n\nFavorite car: Mercedes.\n\nBorn: Aug. 30, 1982\n\nStands 6-1, 180 pounds.\n\nCompiled by Marc Berman\n\n——\n\nMARC BERMAN’S U.S. OPEN PICKS (chart of odds)"
