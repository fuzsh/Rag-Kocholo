        "meta_description": "Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan — Gallagher, Todd — Massive goalies, midget batters, and Mike Tyson... Todd Gallagher faced them all to answer your questions Every sports fan knows that the debates can be almost as interesting as the games themselves (unless you&#39;re a Tampa Bay Devil Rays fan, in which case they&#39;re much more interesting). But some debates can never be settled no matter how much you run up your bar tab arguing with your friends. Well, it&#39;s time to answer your questions once and for all: • Could an average guy start in the WNBA? • Would sumo wrestlers make great NFL linemen? • How easy is it for pro athletes to get laid? • How good are pro golfers at miniature golf? • Do pro athletes really play drunk or high? • How would a fan hit against a major league pitcher? To settle more than thirty of sports&#39; greatest (and most ridiculous) debates, Todd Gallagher has teamed up with coaches, general managers, and athletes--including LeBron James, Mike Tyson, Dwyane Wade, Johan Santana, Eddie George, Jose Canseco, and many others. But Gallagher didn&#39;t just ask questions. He put these debates to the test--literally. He sent an all-midget lineup up against a pro baseball team. He swam freestyle against a doggie-paddling Olympic gold medalist. He recruited America&#39;s #1 darts player to test that uncanny accuracy in beer pong. And, yes, he stuck a frying pan in tennis star Andy Roddick&#39;s hands and went to battle. The results are hilarious and enlightening. Best of all, once you have the answers you&#39;ll be able to shut up the next loudmouth who tries to debate you at the bar.",
