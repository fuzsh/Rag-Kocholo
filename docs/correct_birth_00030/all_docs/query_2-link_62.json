(Wayne Anderson | MLive.com file photo)\n\nRoddick won the 18-and-under doubles title with partner LeVar Harper-Griffith at the 1999 U.S. Tennis Association Boys National Championships on the Kalamazoo College hardcourt, sparking a stellar pro career that saw him earn the world’s No. 1 ranking four years later.\n\nRoddick returns to Stowe Stadium for the first time since his junior championship, and the retired tennis player will again compete in a doubles match – this time carrying his bag and 17 years’ worth of name recognition.\n\nFresh off his July induction to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the Omaha, Nebraska, native will team up with Detroit native and former pro Michael Russell for a 7 p.m. pro-set match Saturday against the tournament’s top-seeded 18U doubles pair.\n\nThe retired pros will then switch sides and team up with one of the junior players for another match.\n\nMichigan well represented in tournament field\n\nBill Duo serves the ball during the USTA Boys' 18 & 16 National Tournament at Stowe Stadium on Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2016 in Kalamazoo, Mich.

Rated as a five-star recruit for the class of 2018, Duo advanced to the fifth round of the tournament last year in the 16U bracket, and he’ll receive a first-round bye this year.\n\nThe tournament begins Friday, with opening-round play in 18U singles and doubles, followed by Round 1 of 16U singles and doubles on Saturday. The doubles champions in both age groups will be crowned on Saturday, Aug. 12, while the singles championship matches will be held on Sunday, Aug. 13.\n\nFollow along to see the rest of the athletes competing in front of their home-state crowd.\n\nRELATED: Michigan tennis phenom's longtime dream realized with Ivy League commitment\n\nSteven Forman\n\nTroy sophomore Steve Forman serves the ball over the net during the Michigan high school division 1 boys tennis finals Friday, Oct. 16, 2015 at Midland Tennis Center in Midland.
