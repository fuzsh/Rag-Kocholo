        "text": "NEWPORT — One of Todd Martin’s stated goals as International Tennis Hall of Fame chief executive officer comes to fruition Sunday, with four recently retired stars coming together for a one-day event in cooperation with the PowerShares Legends Series.\n\nAndy Roddick, James Blake, Mark Philippoussis and 2016 inductee Marat Safin match up at 11 a.m. in a special showcase, with the four former world top-10 standouts gracing the stadium court before the 3 p.m. Hall of Fame Tennis Championships final. Roddick matches up with Philippoussis while Blake takes on Safin, who joins Justine Henin and posthumous honorees Yvon Petra and Margaret Scriven in this year’s class.\n\n“I consider myself a tennis historian,” Roddick said in a Wednesday conference call. “I was a fan long before I played any tennis of record. I couldn’t be more excited to be there, see the festivities and play on the hallowed grounds on Sunday.”\n\nRoddick boasts 22 PowerShares titles since his 2012 retirement from the ATP Tour, including two this season. The No. 1 player in what Martin calls the tennis “afterlife” retains his trademark mix of thoughtfulness and candor, and he’ll help headline the opening event in a three-year deal between the Hall of Fame and the PowerShares series.\n\n“You get that amount of ego on one court with four players and you obviously want to win,” Roddick said. “I think the difference is now, if it doesn’t work out, it’s not going to ruin my day.”\n\nA former world No. 1 and the last American male to win a major at the 2003 U.S. Open, Roddick’s 32 career titles came mostly thanks to one of the biggest serves of his era, a booming forehand and the willingness to wring every ounce from his 6-foot-2 frame. His achievements could be enough to secure his own future induction — it’s something Roddick’s certainly considered.\n\n“It’s the pinnacle as far as achievement and what can happen for you post-career,” Roddick said. “I always feel weird talking about it because you feel undeserving when you look at the people that are actually inducted into the Hall of Fame.”\n\nRoddick’s transition to retirement has been a seamless one. He continues to play tennis, has done some television work and serves as a doting husband and father to his wife, fashion model Brooklyn Decker, and their son, Hank, who was born last September.\n\n“I don’t know that my social life ever completely existed on tour,” Roddick said. “I was retiring from the sport, but I wasn’t retiring from kind of a friendship circle. I always had something stable at home. I always had something I considered a home to go back to.”\n\nMartin responds\n\nAdrian Mannarino’s searing critique of the Newport Casino’s outside courts provoked a response from tournament director and Hall of Fame chief executive officer Martin late Tuesday night.\n\nThe No. 6 seed called the setting for his opening match with James Duckworth “ridiculously bad” and “really disrespectful” after grinding out a three-set victory. Mannarino took issue with the configuration of the side-by-side setup on Courts 1 and 2, the milling patrons beyond each baseline and the lack of Hawkeye technology now available on the facility’s stadium court.\n\n“Tennis players travel the world and each week play with different conditions — court surface, climate, balls, time zones, etc.,” Martin said in a statement. “The players, no matter where they are or what conditions they play in, have one goal each day — to be better than their opponent. Today, Adrian Mannarino accomplished that in spite of not liking the conditions.”\n\nMannarino is scheduled to play big-serving Australian Sam Groth on Thursday.\n\n— bkoch@providencejournal.com\n\nOn Twitter: @BillKoch25"
