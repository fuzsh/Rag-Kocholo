        "text": "Born: 30/8/82\n\nNationality: American\n\nSeeded: 1\n\nWorld ranking: 1\n\nAustralian Open best:\n\nSemi-final (2003)\n\nRecent record:\n\n2003: Semi-final\n\n2002: 2nd round\n\n2001: N/A\n\nLike Juan Carlos Ferrero and Roger Federer before him, Andy Roddick made his long-awaited Grand Slam breakthrough in 2003.\n\nThe great American hope won back-to-back Masters Series titles in August before blasting through the US Open draw to lift his first major title.\n\nWhile his form understandably dipped following that momentous effort, he had enough energy left to snatch the end-of-year world number one ranking from Ferrero to complete a dream 12 months.\n\nSince linking up with coach Brad Gilbert in June, Roddick has worked on adding craft and thought to his game, which is nonetheless still dominated by his brutal serve.\n\nAs well as winning at Flushing Meadows, the 21-year-old reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon and the Masters Cup.\n\nMelbourne Park holds special memories for Roddick after he participated in a historic encounter against Younes El Aynaoui in last year's quarter-finals.\n\nHaving twice been a set down, Roddick prevailed 21-19 in the final set of a match which lasted more than five hours, and finished at one in the morning."
