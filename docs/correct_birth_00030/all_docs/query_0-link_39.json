In America, his good looks made him something of a pop culture fixture, dating movie and music star Mandy Moore, hosting Saturday Night Live, competing on The Weakest Link, and profiled in Interview by Elton John. Roddick seriously considered quitting competitive tennis at 17, when he had a losing streak in juniors. Instead, his coach talked him into giving tennis four more months of undivided attention. Roddick was rated the number one junior player in the world before turning professional. By 2002, in his second year as a pro, Roddick was a millionaire. In 2003, at 21 years of age, Roddick became the youngest American tennis player to be ranked #1.\n\nFather: Jerry Roddick (investor)\n\nMother: Blanche\n\nBrother: John Roddick (tennis coach)\n\nBrother: Lawrence Roddick (chiropractor)\n\nGirlfriend: Mandy Moore (actress, together 2002-04)\n\nWife: Brooklyn Decker (model, m. 17-Apr-2009)\n\nHigh School: Boca Raton Preparatory School, Boca Raton, FL (2000)\n\nWinner, US Open (men's singles) 2003\n\nChampion, US Open Series (male) 2005\n\nChampion, US Open Series (male) 2006\n\nATP Newcomer of the Year 2001\n\nATP Player of the Year 2003\n\nEndorsement of American Express\n\nEndorsement of Reebok 2004\n\nRisk Factors: Skydiving\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nJust Go With It (9-Feb-2011) Â· Good Looking Guy on Plane\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://www.andyroddick.com/\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Andy Roddick\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
