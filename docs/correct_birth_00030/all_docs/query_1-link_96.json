        "text": "TENNIS\n\nI t will be 20 years since an American won the men’s singles title at the US Open. It will be 20 years since an American won the men’s singles discipline in any Grand Slam tournament for that matter.\n\nAndy Roddick, once the world’s top-ranked player, won the first and only Grand Slam title of his career at the 2003 edition of the tournament. He beat Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero, the reigning French Open champion, 6–3, 7–6(2), 6–3 in the final that year.\n\nRoddick’s win meant American players had emerged triumphant in the men’s singles category on 19 of the 36 occasions that the tournament had been played in the Open Era (beginning in 1968) until then. That gives it a success rate of more than 50 per cent. The numbers thereafter do not make up for an impressive reading.\n\nOn the home front\n\nA s tennis went professional in 1968, Arthur Ashe made sure the American fans in New York had a lot to celebrate, getting the better of Dutchman Tom Okker in a five-set thriller."
