These famous Olympians from Nebraska have achieved some of the highest honors in sports history just by qualifying for the Olympics, as most athletes will never be chosen to represent their countries. These are the most prominent people from Nebraska who have competed in the Olympics, although not all of them have taken home an Olympic medal. While these popular Nebraska Olympians were born in Nebraska, they didn't necessarily compete for their originating country. This list has everyone from Andy Roddick to Alice Schmidt.\n\nThis list answers the questions, \"Which Olympians are from Nebraska?\" and \"Which Olympians were born in Nebraska?\" After you are finished, head on over and check out this list of Olympic athletes born in Illinois."
