        "text": "Is the US men's great drought for Grand Slam titles coming to an end on Sunday? Probably not. At least there is a semi-finalist from the USA for the first time since Andy Roddick in 2009.\n\nby Jens Huiber\n\nlast edit: Jan 25, 2023, 08:49 am\n\nAndy Roddick, we don't want to forget that, was born in 1982. And that's a little over a year younger than Roger Federer. However, Roddick has not touched his tennis racquet professionally in singles since 2012, which is a shame for a number of reasons. From the point of view of the Americans, it hurt primarily in terms of sport, but for the world public a man who was always good for a golden quote was also lost. And still is an expert on the Tennis Channel.\n\nWith Tommy Paul reaching the semi-finals, a dry spell that lasted 14 years is now coming to an end. Because in 2009, Andy Roddick was the last American in the semi-finals of the Australian Open. Roddick then started against the Swedish qualifier Bj√∂rn Rehnquist, then won against Xavier Malisse, Fabrice Santoro and Tommy Robredo. The quarter-final opponent back then was today's favorite: Novak Djokovic . The Serb went into the first major of the year in third place in 2009, with Roddick seeded seventh. However, the slight outsider had a better day, in several respects: after losing the first set in the tie-break, Roddick won the following two with 6: 4 and 6.2, with the score of 1: 2 in the fourth round Djokovic had to give up.\n\nRoddick fails twice at Federer\n\nIn the semifinals, however, Andy Roddick was the end of the line - again against Roger Federer . The Maestro won 6-2, 7-5 and 7-5 only to suffer one of his most bitter defeats in the final against Rafael Nadal.\n\nRoddick, who had also reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open in 2003, 2005 and 2007, was to experience his own personal low blow a few months later: in the Wimbledon final he again had a 2-0 set lead against Federer. But then had to admit defeat in the extension of the fifth set with 14:16. Andy Roddick should never come closer to a Grand Slam victory.\n\nWhat remains, however, is the outstanding one of the 32 individual titles on the ATP tour: that at the US Open 2003, which of course was the last one by a US player to date. Will that change next Sunday? There are doubts. Because the quarter-final opponent Roddicks from 2009 is clearly on a mission ...\n\nlaver arena"
