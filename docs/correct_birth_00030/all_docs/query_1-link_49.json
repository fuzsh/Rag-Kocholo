        "text": "Why Omaha, NE?\n\nNamed one of the best places in the country for millennials to settle down, despite what some may think, Omaha is no fly-over city. Oh, no, no, no. It is a city built on solid Midwestern worth ethic, Omaha is a hub for start-ups, including various Travel Nurse Agencies. Omaha is also a destination for craft beer lovers and home of what continuously ranks as one of the “best zoos in the world.” (the world, people!) Home of the College World Series (CWS) and unarguably the best steaks in the country (Omaha Steaks).\n\nOur great city also boasts an awesome music scene (home of the Maha music festival and Saddle Creek Records) and being the birthplace of just a few well-known people; actors Andrew Rannells, Gabrielle Union and Marlon Brando, activist Malcom X, business magnate Warren Buffett, singer Conor Oberst, and finally a handful of super-talented athletes like Andy Roddick, Wade Boggs and Bob Gibson. Last, but certainly not least, our own hometown hero, The Champ himself; Terrence “Bud” Crawford (holder of multiple world championship belts in professional boxing). Feeling frisky? Want to be OSM (pronounced “awesome”) too? Jump in the ring with us here at the OneStaff Omaha office!\n\nWe. Are. OneStaff. Omaha.\n\nWhy Clearwater, Florida?\n\nThe home of professional wrestling icon, Hulk Hogan, the famous Don Cesar Hotel, a plethora of sea life from manatees to dolphins (that you can witness from our office view) and the spot where the Cuban sandwich was invented…what else do you need to know about this prime traveling healthcare agency’s location? From year-round professional sports within proximity (The Buccaneers, Devils Rays, Lightning) to must experience Sunshine Skyway Bridge (the largest cable suspensions bridge in the Western Hemisphere at 4.1 miles across), there is plenty of reasons to call this city home.\n\nIf that all wasn’t enough, here you go… did we mention America’s #1 beaches? And the Guinness World Record for the most consecutive days of sunshine – 768 days to be exact. Even us in our Midwestern HQ are jealous of this location. Come get your golden tan on with us here at the OSM (pronounced “awesome”) Clearwater office!\n\nWe. Are. OneStaff. Clearwater.\n\nWhy Miamisburg, Ohio?\n\nHome of the famous Miamisburg prehistoric mound historical site (dating back to 1000-200 BCE), and within driving distance to famous comedian, Dave Chapelle’s home, we have the best of all worlds. A major hub for amusement parks. Professional sports galore, (Bengals, Browns, Reds, Indians and the Cavaliers), the birthplace of a whopping 7 U.S. presidents, to an Ohio-specific phenomenon of Cincinnati-style chili (#NOM, just try it), Miamisburg is in the center of a lot of Ohio action.\n\nA quick drivable distance to Cleveland, to visit the state’s best beaches (on Lake Eerie) and the rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Or Cincinnati for the amazing zoo experience, botanical garden and National Underground Railroad Museum. Oh, and we’re right across the street from Wright Brothers airport, as the area is known as the “birthplace of aviation.” Come fly with us here at the OSM (pronounced “awesome”) Miamisburg office!\n\nWe. Are. OneStaff. Miamisburg."
