time world number one-ranked Andy Roddick is joining FOX Sports 1, a new sports network launching Aug. 17, as a co-host for FOX SPORTS LIVE, the network’s flagship news, opinion and highlights program. “It is very rare that you find an exceptional athlete who can step off the field or in this case the court, who has the potential to be as equally talented in an on-air role,” said FOX Sports Executive Vice President, Studio Production, Scott Ackerson. “Andy is not only an expert tennis analyst, but his knowledge, candor and opinions on all sports are equally as impressive, and that makes him a unique fit for what we have in mind for FOX SPORTS LIVE.”\n\nBesides his obvious credentials as a world-class tennis champion, Roddick is an avid sports fan. The Nebraska native has had a lifelong devotion to the Cornhuskers and became an ardent follower of the Heat after moving to South Florida as a young boy, frequently attending games. Roddick is also a fantasy sports junkie, and spends a great deal of time on his football and baseball teams. Roddick joins Jay Onrait and Dan O’Toole, previously announced as the primary highlight team, on FOX SPORTS LIVE.\n\n“I was a tennis player for a long time, but I’ve been a sports fan a lot longer than that, and I am beyond excited to be joining FOX SPORTS LIVE, being a part of television’s newest national sports network, FOX Sports 1,” Roddick said. “It has always been a dream of mine to pursue an opportunity like this after my playing career, and I am incredibly grateful to Eric, Scott and the entire FOX Sports 1 team for helping make this dream a reality. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nRoddick is the most recent North American male to have won a Grand Slam singles event with his 2003 U.S. Open title. Following his U.S. Open win, Roddick spent much of the next decade ranked in the world’s top 10. He advanced to the Wimbledon finals three times, reached the Australian Open semifinals four times and played in 42 Davis Cup matches, leading the United States to victory in 2007.\n\nOne of the greatest tennis players in history, Roddick announced his retirement from the sport on Aug. 30, 2012–on his 30th birthday–with the aim of focusing on the Andy Roddick Foundation. He founded the Foundation at the age of 18 with the goal of developing and inspiring underserved youth through sports-based mentoring. Roddick’s work off the court was recognized in 2005, when he received the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award. He then received the Arthur Ashe Leadership Award in 2007 and the Heineken Star Award for achievements in the fields of athletics and philanthropy in 2009.\n\nNo stranger to television, Roddick made the rounds on the late-night talk show circuit during his career with multiple appearances on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He also made daytime television stops at Live with Regis and Kelly and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Roddick hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in 2003, becoming just the second professional tennis player to host the show.\n\nIn 2011, Roddick began hosting a show on FOX Sports Radio with his friend Bobby Bones, which was nationally syndicated in 2012. The successful show was a mix of sports, pop culture and entertainment, and while seemingly unlikely, sports other than tennis usually ruled the day.\n\nRoddick was born in Omaha, NE, and moved to Boca Raton, Fla., at the age of 11, which served as the catalyst for his tennis career. He was the number one junior player in the U.S. from 1999 to 2000, and by 2000 he was ranked number one in the world. He won six world junior singles titles and seven world doubles titles. In 2000, he won the Junior U.S. Open and Australian Open singles titles before going pro that year. He is married to model/actress Brooklyn Decker."
