        "text": "In the press conference after his Wimbledon final with Roger Federer in July, Andy Roddick was asked to describe the extraordinary events of the previous four hours, particularly the surreal fifth set in which he was forced to serve to stay in the championship nine times, before eventually losing the last of his cat's lives, and the set, 16-14. \"Can you tell us what just happened out there, Andy?\" Roddick's interlocutor wondered, as if, like the rest of us, he still wasn't quite sure himself.\n\nRoddick considered the question for only a moment, before answering, simply, bleakly, \"I lost.\"\n\nNot since the \"I do\" of his marriage a couple of months earlier had Roddick asked two words to carry such a weight of emotional understatement. The greatest competitors (Connors, Becker, Borg) – among whom Roddick now must be counted – always talked of being spurred less by the joy of victory than by fear of defeat. Watching Roddick on court after that final, there was in his eyes not a flicker of satisfaction at having just played the greatest tennis of his life; he had only, in his own mind, come up short once again.\n\nTime does not easily heal that hurt. When I ask the same question – what happened out there, Andy? – nearly five months later, his answer remains the same. \"I lost. That's the fact of it for me,\" he says, on the phone from his home in Austin, Texas. \"I mean, I can look back on the process of the tournament as a whole with some satisfaction, the semi, beating Andy Murray, but the final itself is tough for me to think about.\"\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of it all, I guess, must have been the role reversal that he and Federer underwent: for long periods of that match he outplayed, shot for shot, the greatest player ever to pick up a racket.\n\n\"It was odd,\" he agrees, \"in that I felt like Roger was relying more on his serve, while I was doing better from the back of the court maybe, which is a little different to how it has gone in the past.\" He pauses. \"But I still lost.\"\n\nIn July, a couple of weeks before his twins were born, I talked to Federer about how that match had felt from his side of the net, in particular the weirdness of that fifth set, in which neither player had seemed remotely likely to crack. \"I had a feeling at changeovers that we would be there all summer long,\" Federer suggested, \"that they would close the roof, people would sleep all night and wake up and me and Andy would still be there, beards growing, holding serve. Honestly, that went through my mind. I knew he was not going to make a mistake, and I didn't feel that I was…\"\n\nThe enemy of tennis players is doubt. Did Roddick share that conviction?\n\n\"Well,\" he says, with a laugh, \"it was certainly a different kind of match...\" The moment that he goes over in his head, the might-have-been that he will live with for the rest of his life, occurred at break point, 12-12. Roddick played a return that he felt got caught a little in the wind as he hit it. \"It turned a normal kind of shot for Roger into something much, much trickier.\" In that instant Roddick thought he might finally have Federer's number, but in a splinter of a second the champion somehow adjusted and got the ball back. The rest was history.\n\nAfter the match Roddick's agent suggested to him that \"he had lost a game but won the heart of his nation\". Though he did not do as well as he had hoped at the US Open – he lost in the third round to the unseeded 6ft 9in John Isner, who played the match of his life – he concedes that the defeat at Wimbledon was a breakthrough for him with the American public. Roddick has always been in the unenviable position of following the golden age of Sampras and Agassi and Courier and Chang. For the past five years, he has had to shoulder America's expectations alone, pretty much in the manner of Henman or Murray. In the past that has sometimes looked like a burden, but this year he seemed to relish the role.\n\n\"Well,\" he suggests, \"I grew up watching Agassi and Sampras and the rest, and I admired all of them. But for every downside of that pressure the upside has been that I have been the No 1 player in my country, which is pretty cool.\"\n\nHe has taken of late to Twittering about life on the tour. \"It's a nice way of reaching out to fans and sharing what you want with them,\" he says. His messages give little insights into his training schedule, his obsession with his college football team, the Nebraska Cornhuskers, and his love for his English bulldog, named Billie Jean (after the tennis player). He prefers this direct interaction with the public in part because it bypasses the tennis press, which has not always been kind to him since he won the US Open (still his only grand slam title) and briefly became world No 1 in 2003.\n\nIt must have rankled a little with Roddick over the years that he has been thought of as a 155mph serve and not much else. \"Yeah,\" he says, \"I'm the most successful bad player ever. I used to hear a lot that all I could do was hit a serve, I couldn't volley, I can't hit a backhand, I don't return well, and then people would turn round and tell me I'm underachieving.\" He laughs. \"Well, all I'd say is – you can't have it both ways. For a guy who can't hit a shot, I've done OK…\"\n\nThis year, he has achieved that rare mid-career thing, a real step-up in his game. He puts it down partly to his new coach Larry Stefanki, but also to a refreshed desire that has seen him work harder than ever and lose nearly 10lbs from his previous fighting weight. \"I work a lot more than I did when I got into the tour, I'm finding that I enjoy getting out on court early in the morning to practise as much as I enjoy matches,\" he says. \"That's a new thing for me.\" This impetus comes down to wanting to find exactly how good he can be. Roddick wasn't always the most focused and committed player on the tour – a fact that has allowed him to stay balanced off-court. Still, at 27, he reckons he has \"three, maybe four\" good years left, and he doesn't want to end with regrets.\n\nAnother grand slam is, obviously, an ambition. It looks though, I suggest, much tougher than it has for a long time at the top of the men's game. Is that how it feels to him?\n\n\"Definitely,\" Roddick says. \"I'm a far better player now than I was when I was No 1 in the world. You look at the guys who have come through, and they are a different kind of athlete. Murray is 6ft 3in, Del Potro is 6ft 6in, Nadal – an awful lot of power, so that's the way it is going.\"\n\nRoddick got married in April to Brooklyn Decker, a model who first caught his eye in Sports Illustrated's annual swimwear issue – the ultimate mail-order bride (he had his agent fix up a date). Elton John, who has become a friend since he asked to meet Roddick for Interview magazine, played for them at the wedding (\"which was kind of unbelievable\"). Roddick is not sure that married life has brought an extra maturity to his game, though he certainly suggests that he is as happy as he has ever been, off court and on. He is certain, too, that there are no kids on the immediate horizon. He must have been cheered slightly, I say, by the news that his nemesis, Federer, had become the father of twins – does he imagine his rival's sleepless nights might give him the chance he has been waiting for?\n\nRoddick laughs. \"The thing with Roger is that he has created a monster for himself. If he only wins three out of four slams in a year, everyone says he's lost it, he is on the way out. I'm sure he will be around for a while yet.\"\n\nI wonder if Roddick, who has now lost three Wimbledon finals to Federer, ever allows himself to think how his career might have gone if he had not been born at the same time as the Swiss.\n\nHe suggests that way madness lies. \"It's a privilege to be out there in a final with him,\" he says. \"One of these days I just have to find a way to win.\" There is, in this respect, I guess, always next year; Roddick is readier than he has ever been."
