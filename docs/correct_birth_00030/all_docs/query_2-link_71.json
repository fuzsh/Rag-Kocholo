        "text": "Andy Roddick is a sports commentator and retired tennis player who was at one time ranked No. 1 in the world. He reached the semifinal of the 2003 Australian Open at just 20 years of age and captured a remarkable U.S. Open title later that year. Near the end of the season, Roddick attained the world No. 1 ranking, but that U.S. Open victory would be the only Grand Slam singles title of his career. Roddick subsequently sniffed Grand Slam glory several times, but he lost in the Wimbledon final in 2004, 2005 and 2009, each time succumbing to Roger Federer. Roddick was known for his punishing serve-measured in excess of 150 miles per hour during play on several occasions-and fiery on-court demeanor, but his career was marred by injuries during his prime. After retiring from pro tennis, Roddick parlayed his passion for sports into a role as an analyst on the debut of \"Fox Sports Live\" (2013- ), the flagship program on the network Fox Sports 1, joined by former NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb and basketball Hall of Famer Gary Payton."
