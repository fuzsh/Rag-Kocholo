        "text": "Description\n\nAvailable in:\n\nAndrew Stephen Roddick (born August 30, 1982) is an American former professional tennis player.\n\nRoddick became a Grand Slam singles champion and world number one shortly after he won the title at the 2003 US Open, defeating French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final and overtaking him as the top ranked player in the process. Despite several more years as one of the world's best players, the 2003 US Open title would remain his only Grand Slam triumph. He is the most recent North American male player to win a Grand Slam singles event, reach the top ranking, and claim the year-end world number one ranking (2003). Roddick reached four other Grand Slam finals (Wimbledon in 2004, 2005 and 2009, and the US Open in 2006), losing to Roger Federer every time. Roddick was ranked in the top 10 for nine consecutive years between 2002 and 2010 at year's end, and won five Masters Series titles in that period. He is married to Brooklyn Decker, a former Sports Illustrated swimwear model and actress.\n\nOn August 30, 2012, during the 2012 US Open and on his 30th birthday, Roddick announced that he would retire after the tournament. Following a fourth-round defeat by Juan Mart√≠n del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion, Roddick retired from the sport with the aim of focusing on his work at the Andy Roddick Foundation.\n\nIn 2015, Roddick played for the Austin Aces in World Team Tennis. This was his eighth season in World Team Tennis and the fifth team for which he has played.\n\nCareer Honours\n\nDavis Cup\n\n2007\n\n_Retired Tennis\n\nATP No.1 Ranking\n\n2004\n\n_Retired Tennis\n\nUS Open\n\n2003\n\n_Retired Tennis\n\nATP No.1 Ranking\n\n2003\n\n_Retired Tennis\n\nCareer Milestones\n\nFormer Youth Teams\n\nFormer Senior Teams\n\n2000-2015\n\nFormer Club Staff\n\nContracts\n\nFanart\n\nBanner\n\nNone Found...\n\nOther Links"
