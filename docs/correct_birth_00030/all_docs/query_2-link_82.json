        "text": "For twenty-one-year-old Andy Roddick’s first scheduled tennis match last week at the U.S. Open, his parents, Blanche and Jerry Roddick, turned up at Arthur Ashe Stadium and were taken in hand by SFX, Andy’s marketing group. They were escorted to an air-conditioned luxury suite, equipped with a stocked refrigerator, sofas, television, bathroom, and a private terrace overlooking the court. The Roddicks brought guests, Stacy and Don Moore, the parents of Andy’s girlfriend, the pop singer Mandy Moore. (“Andy isn’t a musician, but he has remarkable rhythm, and he’s a wonderful dancer,” Blanche Roddick said.)\n\nBoth couples were obviously very fond of one another. The Roddicks greeted the SFX officials—handsome, muscular men in business suits, pretty women in short print dresses—with hugs and kisses. The Moores, for some reason, did likewise. SFX (“Spectacular, Fun, X-citing”) has been representing Andy Roddick since 1999, when, as the national junior champion, he signed an endorsement deal with Reebok.\n\n“We do a lot of things,” one of the SFX women said. “Besides retail licensing, we represent professional athletes, coaches, broadcasters, movie stars, entertainers. We bring out the essence of who they are.”\n\n“Oh,” Blanche Roddick said.\n\nKen Meyerson, a heavy-set, deeply tanned man who is the president of SFX Tennis, said, “Andy is unusual. Andy knows who he is. Andy is very smart, very articulate.”\n\nBlanche Roddick’s eyes gleamed.\n\nOne of the young SFX agents said, “Our media-training course is for some of our younger athletes—the ones who have to learn to make better eye contact with people, to cut out the ‘uh’s, the ‘like’s, the ‘you know’s. Those athletes.”\n\nJerry Roddick reminded his wife that Andy’s match with Tim Henman would be starting at eight, and he went out on the terrace to watch the late-afternoon match, between Andre Agassi and Alex Corretja.\n\n“I’ve got to get myself ready to go down to the box and watch,” Blanche Roddick said. “We never want to show any emotion to Andy, so we don’t like to sit in the box, so close to the court. But we’ve got to sit down there tonight. We’ve also got to be careful to keep poker faces, because they’re always turning the television cameras on us.”\n\nShe looked at her watch. “About this time every day, I have a glass of white wine,” she said. One of the hostesses in the suite brought her a glass.\n\n“Jerry and I were born in Platteville, Wisconsin, and we met there when he was a freshman at the University of Wisconsin and I was a senior in high school,” she said. “Jerry lived on a dairy farm and had to work very hard for the farm and hated it. He’s Andy’s business manager now, and he says that’s hard work, too. Jerry wasn’t athletic, but I played golf and baseball and coached Little League. Jerry started Jiffy Lube stores in Nebraska and Texas. Then, in the Vietnam War, he was drafted and stationed in Fort Bliss, Texas. We moved around a lot and wound up in Omaha, Nebraska. Andy’s older brother John played tennis, and Andy watched him. When Andy was three and a half, he started playing and was always carrying his racquet around and asking, ‘When can I play?’ ” She took a sip of wine and went on: “When Andy was seven, his other brother, Lawrence, came to me and said, ‘Andy has phenomenal hand-eye coördination.’ Now Lawrence has a boy, one year old, my grandson, J.C. You know the way babies carry around their security blankets wherever they go? Well, J.C. does that with his tennis racquet. We say to him, ‘Ready position, J.C.’ And he takes his racquet back.”\n\nThere was a stir outside on the terrace. Agassi was about to win his third set, 6-2. Blanche Roddick said, “When Andy was nine, we took him to the Open for the first time, on the subway, No. 7, and we’ve been taking the subway out here and back ever since. SFX put us up in a nice little hotel on East Fifty-fourth Street. It’s very European. They call the elevator there ‘the lift.’ ”\n\nJerry Roddick came in from the terrace and beckoned impatiently to his wife to come along. “We’ll go down and see Andy to wish him luck, without showing any emotion,” she said. “Then we’ll see him when he comes off the court, and I’ll get his sweaty kiss.”"
