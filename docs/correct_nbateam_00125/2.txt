PORTLAND, Ore. — Free-agent guard Jamal Crawford has decided to sign with the Portland Trail Blazers.

Crawford, who was reportedly considering Sacramento and the Blazers, announced his choice on Twitter, posting “Rip city!!!”

The terms of the deal were not clear. The Trail Blazers refused to comment because the deal had yet to be formally signed and Crawford’s agent could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.

An 11-year veteran, Crawford played for the Atlanta Hawks the last two seasons. For his career, he has averaged 15.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 3.9 assists. He won the NBA’s Sixth Man award in 2010.

The 6-foot-5 shooting guard will help the Blazers deal with the absence of Brandon Roy, who says he plans to pursue medical retirement, and Rudy Fernandez, who was traded away on draft night in June.

It was expected that the Blazers would use the NBA’s new amnesty clause to waive Roy, freeing up salary cap space and allowing the team to use a mid-level exemption on Crawford.

Crawford is close to Roy, a fellow Seattle native.
