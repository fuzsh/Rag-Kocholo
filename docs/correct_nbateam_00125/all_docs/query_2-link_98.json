        "text": "Hamilton hunts for championship in Chicago\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. - Richard Hamilton wants another championship, and he sees a chance to win one with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe veteran guard called the Bulls \"an awesome fit for me\" on Thursday and said he's looking forward to playing alongside MVP Derrick Rose. The Bulls won more games than any other team during the regular season and reached the Eastern Conference finals, but one thing they could have used was more height and scoring in the backcourt.\n\nHamilton, who is 6-foot-7, should fill that need.\n\nKings owners 'optimistic' about new arena plan\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. - Sacramento Kings owners Joe and Gavin Maloof are growing increasingly optimistic that the city will approve an acceptable financing plan for a new arena by the March 1 deadline to keep the franchise from relocating.\n\nGavin Maloof said Thursday that the team is pleased with the progress of the city's latest arena project and is \"encouraged that something can be done\" in time. Joe Maloof said the brothers are \"optimistic guys\" and would love for the franchise to remain in Sacramento.\n\nThe Sacramento City Council has approved several preliminary measures to finance the arena. A final vote on the project is expected in February.\n\nSacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson is planning to meet with NBA Commissioner David Stern and other executives in New York on Friday to continue discussions.\n\nFree agent Jamal Crawford heading to Portland\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. - Free-agent guard Jamal Crawford has decided to sign with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nCrawford, who was reportedly considering Sacramento and the Blazers, announced his choice on Twitter, posting \"Rip city!!!\"\n\nThe terms of the deal were not clear. The Trail Blazers refused to comment because the deal had yet to be formally signed and Crawford's agent could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nAn 11-year veteran, Crawford played for the Atlanta Hawks the last two seasons. For his career, he has averaged 15.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 3.9 assists. He won the NBA's Sixth Man award in 2010.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 shooting guard will help the Blazers deal with the absence of Brandon Roy, who says he plans to pursue medical retirement.\n\nClippers welcome Chris Paul to LA\n\nLOS ANGELES - Chris Paul is already getting to work with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe four-time All-Star point guard reported to the Clippers' Playa Vista training complex on Thursday, meeting his new teammates and even getting on the court during practice in his new white No. 3 jersey.\n\nA day earlier, the Clippers acquired Paul in a bold four-player trade with New Orleans, outmaneuvering the Lakers and several other suitors.\n\nBlake Griffin says he's sad to lose teammates Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman and Al-Farouq Aminu in the deal, but the Rookie of the Year is looking forward to lining up with Paul and fellow newcomers Caron Butler and Chauncey Billups.\n\nGriffin says that when basketball fans hear about the Clippers, \"it's not going to be a joke anymore.\"\n\nO'Neal launching new career as NBA analyst\n\nATLANTA - Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley are debating already.\n\nO'Neal, the Hall of Fame-bound center, is joining Barkley, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson on the set of TNT's \"Inside the NBA.\"\n\nBarkley and O'Neal seemed to disagree on all the NBA's hot stories on Thursday - including the Chris Paul trade and the Dwight Howard saga.\n\nO'Neal says the New Orleans Hornets \"totally took a step back\" trading Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers. Barkley says the Hornets did well \"because they weren't going to win with Chris Paul.\"\n\nBarkley said the Hornets, who acquired guard Eric Gordon, forward Al-Farouq Aminu, center Chris Kaman and a first-round draft choice, protected their future without making a huge sacrifice in their current outlook.\n\nBarkley also had sharp criticism of Stern for nixing the Hornets' proposed trade of Paul to the Lakers.\n\nBarkley and O'Neal also gave opposing opinions on Howard's relationship with the Magic. O'Neal says Orlando should give Howard more respect and more help.\n\nBarkley says the team has tried to improve.\n\nGates 5 catches from breaking team record\n\nSAN DIEGO - Antonio Gates is five catches away from breaking Charlie Joiner's San Diego Chargers team record for receptions.\n\nJoiner is convinced the record couldn't be headed for better hands.\n\nGates has 582 career catches going into Sunday night's home game against the Baltimore Ravens and their tough defense. Joiner had 586 catches from 1976-86, the final 11 seasons of his 18-year NFL career.\n\nJoiner, a Hall of Famer who's the Chargers' wide receivers coach, said there's no better person to break his record than Gates. Joiner describes the star tight end as both a magnificent player and a great person.\n\nGates would have the record by now if not for painful plantar fasciitis that bothered him late last season and earlier this season. He's healthy now and back to being a force for the Chargers.\n\nRoethlisberger improving, still not practicing\n\nPITTSBURGH - Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger says his sprained left ankle feels better but he's still not certain when he'll return to practice.\n\nRoethlisberger planned to spend most of Thursday in treatment hoping he sees enough improvement over the next two days to practice sometime before the Steelers play at San Francisco on Monday night.\n\nThe quarterback suffered the sprain in the second quarter of last week's 14-3 win over Cleveland. He missed two series but played the entire second half. He said Thursday he's not quite sure how he did it, giving most of the credit for his performance to adrenaline.\n\nRoethlisberger has been wearing a walking boot for the last week. He can take it off for short periods but says doctors have advised him to avoid certain movements."
