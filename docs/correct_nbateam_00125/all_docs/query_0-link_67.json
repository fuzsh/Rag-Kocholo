        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Jamal Crawford had 23 points, including a key 3-pointer with 1:36 left, and the Atlanta Hawks held off a late rally by the Portland Trail Blazers for a 90-83 victory on Sunday night.\n\nJoe Johnson added 22 points and Atlanta led by as many as 23 in the sixth of a seven-game road trip. The Hawks are 3-3 on the trip, which wraps up Monday night in Denver.\n\nJohnson’s 3-pointer gave the Hawks an 80-60 lead with 5:54 left in the game, but the Blazers narrowed it to 82-74 after layups from LaMarcus Aldridge and Gerald Wallace.\n\nAndre Miller’s layup closed the gap further, capping a 16-2 run, the comeback stalled when Crawford’s 3-pointer put the Hawks up 85-78. Miller’s short jumper with 1:29 left was off, and Crawford hit a pair of free throws that all but sealed it.\n\nMiller led the Blazers with 20 points, while Aldridge had 19.\n\nJosh Smith added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Hawks.\n\nKirk Hinrich had eight points off the bench in his second game with the Hawks. He was acquired along with Hilton Armstrong from the Washington Wizards for guards Mike Bibby, Maurice Evans and Jordan Crawford before the NBA’s trade deadline this week.\n\nThe Blazers saw the debut of Wallace, who was acquired from Charlotte seven minutes before Thursday’s trade deadline in exchange for Portland centers Joel Przybilla and Sean Marks, forward Dante Cunningham and two conditional first-round draft picks.\n\nA fan in the crowd held a sign that said “Welcome Crash,” Wallace’s nickname. He received a standing ovation when he came into the game with 4:44 left in the first half. He finished with nine points.\n\nThe Blazers also saw the return of center Marcus Camby from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. He missed 16 games after he was in Portland’s victory over Minnesota on Jan. 17.\n\nThe 6-foot-11, 15-year veteran was the Blazers’ only option at center following the trade with the Bobcats. Portland beat the Denver Nuggets 107-106 on Friday without him, sliding Aldridge to center to make do.\n\nThe Blazers got a scare when Aldridge left the game with 1:58 to go in the first quarter and appeared to be limping. The team’s top scorer with 22.5 points per game returned with 5:46 left in the half.\n\nAtlanta went on an 15-0 run to go up 42-27 with 3:14 left in the first half, while Portland struggled in Aldridge’s temporary absence. The Hawks led by as many as 15 points en route to a 48-36 first-half lead.\n\nBlazers fans were upset about what appeared to be a disparity of calls for the Hawks. Atlanta made 14-of-16 free throws in the first half, while Portland was 1 for 3.\n\nJohnson’s turnaround jumper extended the lead to 63-43 with 5:20 left in the third quarter.\n\nNotes: The Hawks swept the season series against the Blazers 2-0 last season. … Wallace did not wear a headband in his debut with the Blazers. Coach Nate McMillan has in the past said he prefers his players don’t wear them."
