        "text": "Two free-agent guards the Sixers reportedly targeted are off the board.\n\nJamal Crawford is re-signing with the Los Angeles Clippers (three years for $42 million per USAToday's Sam Amick) and Rajon Rondo is heading to the Chicago Bulls (two years for $28 million per ESPN's Marc Spears).\n\nThe Sixers reportedly made a \"significant offer\" for the 36-year-old Crawford in an attempt to court him to the East Coast. CSNPhilly.com Sixers insider Jessica Camerto reports the deal the Sixers offered Crawford was a short-term one while the Clippers offered the three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year a longer deal, which he eventually accepted. She wrote earlier Sunday why the Sixers signing Crawford to a short-term deal would have made sense.\n\nLast season with the Clippers, the sharpshooting Crawford averaged 14.2 points per game on 40.4 percent from the field in 26.9 minutes a night. In 1100 career regular-season games, Crawford has averaged 15.5 points per game.\n\nSpears originally reported on Saturday morning that the Sixers were among the teams interested in Rondo's services. He also mentioned the Sacramento Kings, whom Rondo played for last season, the New Orleans Pelicans and Bulls as other interested parties.\n\nRondo is an elite passer, having led the league in assists three times, including last season in Sacramento. He's also a poor shooter (29 percent from three, 61 percent from the line) and has been known to have attitude problems.\n\nRondo, 30, was a key part of the Celtics' championship run in 2008. After a brief stint with the Mavericks, which ended poorly, Rondo spent last year with the Kings. For his career, he's averaged 11 points, 8.7 assists and 1.8 steals per game in 645 NBA contests.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers and their rivals in the NBA from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nDuring the first weekend of free agency, the Sixers have also lost out on guards Courtney Lee (four years, $40 million with the New York Knicks), Jeremy Lin (three years, $36 million with the Brooklyn Nets), Jordan Clarkson (four years, $50 million with the Los Angeles Lakers) and Matthew Dellavedova (four-year, $38.4 million offer sheet with the Milwaukee Bucks).\n\nIsh Smith, who started most of last season a point guard for the Sixers, signed a three-year, $18 million deal with the Detroit Pistons on Friday.\n\nA report surfaced Sunday night that the Brooklyn Nets had inked former Portland Trail Blazers guard Allen Crabbe, another potential free-agent guard target for the Sixers, to a four-year, $70 million offer sheet. But both Amick and Spears have refuted that report as both tweeted Sunday night that Crabbe has more meetings with team scheduled for later this week.\n\nWhether the Sixers are one of those teams remains to be seen."
