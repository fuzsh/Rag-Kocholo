        "text": "UPDATE, 8:10 p.m.: Jimmy Butler is out tonight, but Jamal Crawford said before tonight's game he will play.\n\n\"To be honest with you, it's going to be sore for a while,\" Crawford said. \"You don't realize how much you use your toe. Every time you take a step. It'll be sore for a while, but I don't think it'll be a setback.\"\n\nTimberwolves star Jimmy Butler probably won't play tonight in Portland, but veteran guard Jamal Crawford might, depending on how his warmups go.\n\nWolves coach Tom Thibodeau said at this morning's shootaround that Butler is doing more -- he shot before Monday's game in L.A. -- on that sore right knee, but called him \"probably doubtful for tonight.\"\n\nHe said Crawford was feeling \"a little better\" with that sprained big toe.\n\n\"He'll go through shootaround and we'll see where he is,\" Thibodeau said. \"Both are closer, but I'm not sure.\"\n\nThe Wolves have won consecutive games -- Saturday at home over Toronto and Monday at the Clippers -- without their best player and two of their leaders.\n\nTonight, they play the Trail Blazers for the third time this season, but for the first time at Moda Center after the Wovles won both Target Center meetings. The Blazers are seventh in the West, five games behind the third-place Wolves and San Antonio.\n\n\"The important thing is having the belief we can win,\" Thibodeau said. \"We feel very strongly we have more than enough to win win. The next guy has to step up and get the job done. Know what your job is, do your job and if we do that, we'll have a chance to win.\"\n\nThibodeau also spoke about getting both Butler and Karl-Anthony Towns in next month's All-Star Game. That's only the fourth time in team history the Wolves have placed two players in the game.\n\n\"It's great for our organization,\" Thibodeau said. \"Also for everyone to understand how important the winning part is. When you win, people get recognized. So I want us to continue to win and improve and hopefully a guy like Andrew (Wiggins), who I also think is deserving, he gets organized also. But it's great for our organization.\""
