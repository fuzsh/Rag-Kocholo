        "text": "Jamal Crawford is the most talked-about NBA veteran still on the open market. The three-time Sixth Man of the Year can provide scoring and leadership to any of the 30 teams in the NBA.\n\nLast season as a member of the Phoenix Suns, Crawford averaged 30 points throughout the month of April and finished the season by dropping 51 points against the Dallas Mavericks in the season finale. Crawford became the oldest player in NBA history to achieve that feat.\n\n“He is a player,” said his former teammate Devin Booker with the Suns. “People will always see the scoring from him, but I would say really good scorers are usually good passers. They know where people want the ball, and he’s doing that. He is contributing to making plays for people, and it’s a lot easier on me and a lot easier on the big fellas, and it is a big help for all of us.”\n\nCJ McCollum Wants Team to Sign Jamal Crawford\n\nOn Tuesday, Portland Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum tweeted out “Tuesday thoughts…Melo free, now its time Jamal Crawford got signed. Streets need to see this man in the league. That’s all. Happy Tuesday”\n\nCarmelo Anthony was signed on November 15, 2019, by the Portland Trailblazers as ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski was the first to report.\n\nAnthony has played four games thus far with the Blazers and is averaging 16.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game. On November 25, 2019, Anthony made history by passing Alex English for 18th on the NBA’s all-time scoring list against the Chicago Bulls, which was first reported by ESPN’s Eric Woodyard.\n\nFormer Detroit Pistons guard Chauncey Billups feels Crawford has some left in the tank as well.\n\n“Jamal Crawford at 39 years old last year scored 50 points in a game, and he can probably get 40 something on a few nights again if someone would sign him. It’s remarkable,” said Billups.\n\nCrawford Thinks It’s Weird Waiting Around for Teams to Call\n\nEarlier this week, Crawford was in New York filming the latest episode of ‘Don’t @ Me’ with host Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. During one of the segments, Gold-Onwude asked Crawford if he could use one word to describe the waiting process. Weird, Crawford replied.\n\n“Loving the game like I do, and being a part of the game for so long and still even now I’ll text young players or Dm them curtain stuff that I see just advice. It’s just weird not being in the game, but I have faith it will happen,” Crawford said.\n\nCrawford in a different segment with Gold-Onwude shared that he has been watching the teams that are making noise and different players."
