        "text": "Jamal Crawford recently had the opportunity to interview Scoot Henderson, and the former 20-year NBA veteran had high praise for the Portland Trail Blazers draftee.\n\nThe Trail Blazers selected Henderson with the third pick in the draft on Thursday after a strong campaign with the G League Ignite. The team valued his skill set and believes the 19-year-old can be a transcendent player in the NBA.\n\nOf course, the selection comes with uncertainty.\n\nThe future of Damian Lillard in Portland is in doubt and some question the fit between him and Henderson. Others believe it can be a blessing in disguise that Henderson dropped to the Trail Blazers: He has the potential to be a franchise-changing player, as the front office believes.\n\nCrawford, speaking on the “Dan Patrick Show” on Friday, believes Lillard should give Henderson a chance to help the Trail Blazers on the court next season.\n\nI think, out of all of the guys in the draft, that Scoot, even though he is young, is the most NBA-ready, physically and mentally. I did an interview with him and just hearing his answers and how he looks at things and how he approaches things. I (said to) him: ‘At 17 years old your parents sent you across the country. That is a kudos to you and them that they trust you enough to go there and that you’re ready for that.’\n\nIf I’m Dame, I say: ‘I’m going to give this young kid a chance. I know he’s young but if I go get another, let’s say, All-Star, and if he can bring the same kind of impact in Year 1, then maybe I can grow from here.’ But I’m not giving it a lot of time. I’d probably give it half of a season and see how it works out and then I’m not getting any younger if I’m Dame. I’m ready to go win a championship.\n\nHenderson averaged 17.6 points, 6.6 assists and 1.2 steals on 44.4% shooting from the field in 25 games this past season with the Ignite. He registered 12 20-point games and was one of four players to record at least 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in a game.\n\nHe was viewed as the consensus No. 2 player in the draft for much of the past year but dropped one spot behind Alabama forward Brandon Miller. He has elite athleticism and has shown the potential to play on or off the ball, which would help ease the transition next to Lillard.\n\nThe Trail Blazers are going to continue to try to build a contending roster around Lillard. This offseason will likely be one of the most important ones in franchise history as they attempt to keep Lillard.\n\nHenderson is hopeful that will happen.\n\n“I’m hoping to get to play with Dame, for sure,” Henderson said on Thursday. “Special talent, special guard. One of my favorites to watch, especially film-wise. Just to pick out how he moves off the court, as well. Yeah, it would be cool to play with him.”"
