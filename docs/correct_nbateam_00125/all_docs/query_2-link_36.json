        "text": "After free-agent guard Jamal Crawford turned down a two-year, $10 million offer from the Indiana Pacers, the word is that he is down to three possible destinations for next season, according to ESPN: the Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings or New York Knicks.\n\nThe Oregonian reports that Crawford is \"looking for a two-year deal with an option to get out after one season in order to enter next summer's free-agent market,\" when a number of teams will have more salary cap space.\n\n\"I know there will be 20-plus teams with cap space next summer, so signing a short deal, I can be part of that,'' Crawford said, the Oregonian reports. \"It just gives me more options.''\n\nCrawford, a native of Seattle told the paper that his parents want him to sign with the Blazers, but he is attracted to the stocked roster of the Knicks and the fact that the Kings \"can offer him the most money\" while not being far from home. Plus, Crawford \"is a big fan of Kings coach Paul Westphal,\" the paper reports.\n\nThe 11-year vet spent the last two seasons with the Atlanta Hawks, where he won the Sixth Man of the Year in 2010 and averaged 14.2 points, 3.2 assists and 1.7 rebounds per game last year."
