(Ron Hoskins/Getty Images)\n\nJamal Crawford, the 2009-10 NBA Sixth Man of the Year, will become a free agent this summer and expects \"a lot of teams out there with a lot of interest,\" he told Seattle television station KING on Thursday:\n\n\"I'm a free agent, so I'm excited about what's there moving forward,\" Crawford said when asked about his future. \"There will be a lot of teams out there with a lot of interest. I'll sit back after July (free agency begins July 1) and see what happens.\"\n\nCrawford, 32, signed a two-year contract for $10 million with the Portland Trailblazers in December 2010. He has an opt-out clause in the contract that will allow him to sign elsewhere after his first year and forgo the final $5 million owed to him by the Blazers. If he does leave Portland this off-season, his next team will be his sixth NBA team in 12 years."
