        "text": "“I hope the NBA stays with TNT, but for me personally, I wanted you guys to hear it from me … I wanted to tell my NBATV and TNT family that I’m not going to another network, but I’m going to pass the baton to either Jamal Crawford or Vince Carter or you Steve (Smith),” Barkley said. “But next year, I’m going to just retire after 25 years, and I just wanted to say thank you. And I wanted y’all to hear it from me first.”\n\n“I’ve watched two, I can’t wait to watch three,” Crawford said, via The Old Man and The Three podcast. “It’s hilarious because some things I remember and some things like that did not happen but I understand it’s entertainment. But my hair, I’ve never used a piece of spray paint in my life, why do they have my hair looking like that.”"
