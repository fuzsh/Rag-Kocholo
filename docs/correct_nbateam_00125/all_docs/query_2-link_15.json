        "text": "The Trail Blazers have offered a contract to free agent guard Jamal Crawford, and the veteran is expected to make a decision between Portland, Sacramento and New York on Wednesday.\n\nAgent Andy Miller said the Blazers made a two-year, $10 million offer to Crawford on Tuesday, the same offer he turned down earlier in the day with Indiana. One reason Crawford would sign with Portland: He was born and raised in Seattle, less than 200 miles away. Miller said Crawford is looking for a short-term deal. Sacramento and New York have also been reported as making offers to Crawford.\n\nIn order to sign Crawford to a two-year, $10 million deal, the Blazers would have to waive Brandon Roy to get under the salary cap, which would grant them the mid-level exception. Roy and Crawford are close friends and live within a mile of each other in Seattle.\n\nBlazers interim general mananger Chad Buchanan acknowledged the interest on Tuesday night saying the Blazers are \"in discussions\" with Crawford.\n\nCrawford, 31, has played 11 seasons, including the last two in Atlanta, where he won the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award in 2010. He also spent four seasons in Chicago, four in New York and a season split between Golden State and New York.\n\nA 6-foot-5, 200 pound shooting guard, Crawford can also play the point. In Atlanta he came exclusively off the bench, and averaged 14.2 points last season, down from the 18.0 points he scored in 2010. He has played in 752 NBA games, starting 393.\n\nTrail Blazers forward LaMarcus Aldridge has openly campaigned on Twitter for Crawford to join the Blazers, and on Tuesday he continued the push, tweeting “I’m doing my best to get (Crawford) to Portland Rip City.’’"
