        "text": "Although Lebron James and his Cleveland Cavaliers think they need a playmaker, the LA Clippers sure don’t. Bleacher Report Named both Chris Paul and Jamal Crawford top playmakers in the league.\n\nBleacher Report released another NBA Metrics 101 article, in which they took a look at the top “playmakers” in the league. Chris Paul and\n\nJamal Crawford both appeared in this piece for their respective positions.\n\nCP3\n\nBleacher Report reports that Chris Paul has 14.75 unassisted points and 21.81 points created by an assist per game.\n\nWe all know Chris Paul is the “Point God”. We just really appreciate Bleacher Report taking the time to prove it in their article. In an NBA era where scoring point guards such as Isaiah Thomas, Russel Westbrook, Damian Lillard, and James Harden hog the spotlight, Chris Paul shows us that setting up teammates for baskets is more effective than taking thirty shots a game. Paul has the ability to run a more smooth and sound offense than any other player in the league.\n\nAlthough Paul has missed 17 games so far this season, and is not set to return from his thumb injury until late February or early March, the guys over at Bleacher Report still feel like he is hands-down the top playmaking point guard in the NBA this season. His 20 point 20 assist 0 turnover game against the Pelicans in December probably had some influence on their decision to rank him number one.\n\nJCrossover\n\nBleacher Report reports that Jamal Crawford has 8.49 unassisted points and 7.02 points created by an assist per game.\n\nSeeing Jamal Crawford listed as a playmaker is surprising. The 36-year old veteran is a shot creator with ball-handling straight out of EA’s classic video game “NBA Street”. He is also one of the most controversial players on the team. How is he the number three playmaker for his position in the league?\n\nBleacher Report gave this reasoning:\n\nHe might not fit the traditional “playmaker” mold, as Crawford rarely looks for other members of the Los Angeles Clippers, while he’s always seeking scoring opportunities. But he makes plays through his individual shooting prowess, which can be just as valuable.\n\nHis unpredictability and experience give him the ability to break down any team’s defense. His top speed and ball control demands his defender to focus on him, and whoever is chosen to guard him is set to have a long night ahead of them. When Jamal is finished disrupting the opponents’ defense, he can make plays for the rest of the team, who are now more open for shots.\n\nTalented playmakers are hard to come by in today’s NBA. We are thrilled to have two great ones on the Clippers.\n\nMore from Clipperholics\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
