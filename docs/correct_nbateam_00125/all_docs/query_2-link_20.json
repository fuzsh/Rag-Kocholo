        "text": "Jamal Crawford has had a lengthy NBA career, but his signature crossover move has a history that goes even further back.\n\nHis nickname \"J-Crossover\" dates back to his days at Rainier High School in Seattle, where he only played two seasons of organized basketball before becoming a one-and-done college player drafted out of Michigan by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the eighth overall pick in 2000. Only, he was traded minutes later to the Chicago Bulls where he would spend the first four years of his career.\n\n\"I look at it like a rapper, you know, like before the album comes the mixtape,\" Crawford said in a piece on The Players' Tribune. \"Everybody creates a buzz. At that time, before I played high school those were my mixtapes.\"\n\nHis signature behind-the-back-hesitation-to-crossover move that stuns defenders came about when he replaced fellow Seattle native Doug Christie in the “All Hoop, No Hype” Pro-Am league in 1996.\n\n\"That 'shake and bake' move that everybody talks about, I made it up in the All-Star Game on the fly,\" Crawford said. \"I'm coming down, right, early in the season against one of those guys, I had two points against strong guy, overseas guy, his name is Brian Parker.\n\n\"He's locking me up, beating me up. So I make the All-Star Game and as fate would have it, it's just me and him one-on-one in a fast break. I slow down, I'm like what am I gonna do, what am I gonna do. Just me and him, I don't know, I don't know. I do the move out of instinct. I go lay it up, He goes way over there [points far away from himself], I lay it up, there's a wall, I caught myself 'cause I was going so fast. The crowd loses it.\n\nDespite being the Suns' oldest player at 38 — Tyson Chandler is the second oldest at 36 while the rest of the team's average age is just under 24 — Crawford is still spry with electrifying moves, but he claims that his crossover move is a shell of what it once was.\n\nIn addition to playing in Chicago, Crawford has spent time with the New York Knicks, the Golden State Warriors, the Atlanta Hawks, the Portland Trail Blazers, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n\"And what a lot of people don't know is the version the NBA has seen, is the reduced version,\" Crawford said. \"The way I made it up, I do it on command, but I don't want to show everybody because I was waiting 'til I made the All-Star game, I was gonna pull it out. But if it's not happening, it's like one of those Prince records that's in he vaults — it's not gonna ever come out, so, there it is.\"\n\nStill, the Phoenix Suns signed the three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year award winner on Monday ahead of their season opener against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAnd Suns fans should have much to look forward to with him and three-point shooting champion Devin Booker sharing the Suns' backcourt duties.\n\nMORE SPORTS:"
