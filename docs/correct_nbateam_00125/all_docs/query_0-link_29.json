His agent, Andy Miller, also confirmed Crawford’s decision to become a Blazer.\n\nCrawford, 31, is a 6-foot-5 veteran who can play both guard positions. He has played 11 NBA seasons, the last two with Atlanta, where he was the 2010 Sixth Man of the Year as the NBA’s top reserve. That was one of his finest seasons, finishing with averages of 18.0 points and 3.0 assists while shooting 44.9 percent from the field and 38.2 percent from three-point range. Last season, he averaged 14.2 points and 3.2 assists.\n\n\"I think he is a talent,'' Blazers coach Nate McMillan said Wednesday. \"He was the Sixth Man of the Year two years ago. He's a guy who can put the ball in the basket.''\n\nCrawford said he expected to come off the bench in Portland, a role in which he has become accustomed over the years. Still, he has played major minutes throughout his career, averaging more than 30 minutes a game for the last eight seasons.\n\nHe is a high volume shooter and streaky scorer, and has a knack for taking big shot at the end of games and quarters. Three times in his career he has scored 50 or more points, including a career-high 52 in 2007 with New York. He also scored 50 with Golden State and 50 with Chicago.\n\nCrawford made the decision Thursday afternoon after narrowing his choices between Sacramento and Portland. The Kings offered more money and a more free playing style, but Crawford liked the proximity of Portland to his hometown of Seattle, and he valued the role offered by the Blazers. He was also heavily courted by teammates LaMarcus Aldridge and Marcus Camby, and consulted heavily with Roy, his close friend and neighbor in Seattle.\n\nTo sign Crawford, the Blazers are expected to use the mid-level exception, meaning they will have to make a move to get under the luxury tax threshold. That move is expected to be waiving Roy and his $15 million contract under the new amnesty clause in the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nMore to come"
