        "text": "It’s not that Jamal Crawford has never been a starter during his NBA career, which is now in its 15th season. He even started 24 games for the Clippers in 2013-14 out of necessity.\n\nBut the last time Crawford – the two-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year – was a regular starter was during the 2008-09 campaign when he toiled for the New York Knicks and Golden State Warriors.\n\nCrawford started Saturday’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers instead of small forward Matt Barnes, who is averaging just 6.0 points, his lowest total since he averaged 6.7 points for the Lakers in 2010-11. That meant the Clippers started three guards.\n\nCrawford came through with 20 points on 7-of-16 shooting – 3 of 5 from 3-point range – in the Clippers’ 106-102 victory. He played 32 minutes.\n\nCrawford admitted it felt a bit strange to be starting.\n\n“It was a little weird at first,” he said at the Monday morning shootaround ahead of the Clippers’ game against the Spurs at Staples Center. “I think it takes some getting used to. But however (head coach Doc Rivers) sees it and however he wants me out there, I’ll be there for him.”\n\nCrawford made it sound like he wasn’t sure what this is going to mean moving forward.\n\n“We haven’t talked much about it at all,” he said when asked if starting was going to become a regular thing. “You’ll have to ask (Rivers) about it, honestly. I just do what I’m told. He came up with the suggestion and it worked out for us.”\n\nCrawford loves coming off the bench, but, he said, “I’m a baller, I’m a hooper. Just get me out there. I’ll start, come off the bench.”\n\nRivers was asked before tipoff Monday if this change in the lineup was more about Barnes or about Crawford. Neither, he said.\n\n“It’s about the team, really,” he said. “I thought it just gave us a good offensive night and so that’s why we did it.”\n\nRivers said this will be a “game-by-game” situation.\n\nBarnes said during training camp that if he had his druthers, he would prefer to come off the bench, though he never said he hated starting. He held to that credo during an interview with this newspaper about an hour before game time.\n\n“Whatever it takes,” Barnes said. “I think we’re struggling as a team right now. Personally, on the offensive end, I’m struggling. So if you’re going to ignite the team by inserting more offense, it’s what’s best for the team.\n\n“So I’ve always said whether it’s off the bench, starting, it doesn’t matter. I just want to play. I think we found something that works last game and we’re going to see if it works tonight.”\n\nThree good quarters\n\nThe Clippers gave up 38 points in the first quarter to Portland on Saturday, then just 64 over the final three quarters. Backup post Spencer Hawes played just 12 minutes because he is nursing a sprained left foot. He agreed that, considering the team’s poor showing three nights earlier in a 121-104 loss at Golden State, Saturday’s victory was big.\n\n“Yeah, I mean, it was good,” he said. “We needed that. Not just a win, but kind of the feeling both that comes from the win, and just playing better. Especially, offensively, finally feeling like we got in more of a rhythm. And more of an identity defensively, after the first quarter being able to really string together a pretty good stretch.”\n\nThis and that\n\nThe Clippers will not play again until Saturday when they host the Phoenix Suns. Rivers said that Hawes will not practice the next four days to expedite the healing of his foot. … After Phoenix, the Clippers will host the Chicago Bulls next Monday. They then embark on a seven-game road trip beginning Nov. 19 at Orlando, culminating Nov. 29 at Utah."
