        "text": "Jamal Crawford will sign with the Portland Trail Blazers, according to reports. The deal will reportedly be worth $10 million over two years, with a player option to re-sign for the second season. Crawford turned down a similar offer from the Indiana Pacers earlier this week.\n\nThe opt-out clause for the second season was reportedly important for Crawford, who is already looking forward to next offseason where several teams are expected to have extra cap space. The move also puts Crawford back near his home town of Seattle, and gives the Trail Blazers an extra much-needed scorer with Brandon Roy announcing his retirement last week.\n\nCrawford was voted as the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year last season while averaging 18.0 points per game for the Atlanta Hawks. He came in 17th on SB Nation's list of the Top NBA Free Agents."
