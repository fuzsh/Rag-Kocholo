        "text": "Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nFormer Atlanta Hawks guard Jamal Crawford has agreed to a one-year, $5 million deal with the Portland Trail Blazers, according to Sam Amick of SI.com\n\nThe report states that that Crawford only wanted a one-year deal, so he could test out free agency next summer. The report also indicates that he turned down a one-year deal to play for the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThis is going to be a huge signing for the Trail Blazers, who desperately need the offensive help now that Brandon Roy will be retiring because of bad knees.\n\nRoy has been a huge part of the Blazers offense, with career averages of 19 points and 4.7 assists per game, so making up for that loss has to be the immediate reason for bringing Crawford in.\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nAt the height of his career Crawford was an explosive starter for the New York Knicks, averaging 20.6 points and five assists per game during his best season in 2007-08, but since then he's been most known for his role player mentality, coming off the bench for the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHe averaged 18 points per game coming off the Hawks bench in 2009-10 and was honored as the Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nLast season he averaged 14.2 points, 3.2 assists and 1.7 rebounds per game.\n\nThe Trail Blazers will undoubtedly be looking for Crawford to spark this offense, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him in a starter's role once again.\n\nThis will be Crawford's fifth team, as he has played for the aforementioned Hawks and Knicks, as well as the Golden State Warriors in 2008-09 and the Chicago Bulls from 2000-01 to 2003-04."
