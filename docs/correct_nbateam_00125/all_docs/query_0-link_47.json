I don’t like attention anyway, so it’s cool. I’m just here to help.”\n\nCrawford’s 23 points were second on the team, trailing only Jimmy Butler’s 37. Crawford was also the only Timberwolves bench player to score during the game. The rest of the bench went 0 for 5 from the field.\n\n“With Jamal, it doesn’t matter how it’s really going, he hits a couple shots, that could be all he needs to get going,” Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. “He’s done it for a long time.”\n\nCrawford had to fill in for a Timberwolves scorer who struggled in the game. Andrew Wiggins scored just nine points on 4 for 14 shooting. Wiggins did, however, make plays without putting the ball in the net. He had a defensive board with 1:03 remaining and the score tied at 105.\n\nCrawford scored just five points in the first half, but he saw more minutes in the second half and the scoring came with it. He hit a deep 3-pointer as the shot clock expired on a fourth-quarter possession to bring Minnesota within seven with just over seven minutes remaining in the game.\n\n“My teammates just want me to be aggressive” Crawford said. “Coach put me in some great situations and he saw something and stuck with it. I thought it was a good overall team win.”\n\nLater in the fourth, Crawford cut the Timberwolves’ deficit to just two when he stole the ball and passed to Butler in transition. Butler finished with the dunk and the Trailblazers called time out.\n\nThe Timberwolves finished their home stand with a 3-2 mark. After Crawford scored 16 points in the first game of the stretch, he put together three quiet offensive performances. He scored two points on 1 for 5 shooting in two consecutive appearances, Minnesota’s loss to Philadelphia and win over Sacramento. He had six points Saturday against Phoenix before he brought a spark versus Portland (16-14).\n\n“You get so lost in the game, you don’t know what you’re shooting, you’re just trying to win,” Crawford said. “That’s all that matters.”\n\nButler said Crawford is huge, especially when he’s scoring.\n\n“He’s constantly trying to get guys to be better,” Butler said. “You see how he always wants to make everybody better around him. … That’s the mark of a really great player.”\n\nThis is not the first time Crawford helped his team pull away in the fourth quarter. Crawford scored 17 points in the final quarter of Minnesota’s win over Utah in its home opener back in October.\n\nComing off the bench is a role Crawford has been used to playing. The 18-year veteran is a three-time Sixth Man of the Year. But he’s played fewer minutes this season than what he’s accustomed to seeing in the past. But he played 23 minutes Monday night, a noticeable increase over his 17.6 minute average.\n\n“Jamal is a scorer,” Thibodeau said. “He’s got to get a rhythm and do it every night.”\n\nOriginally Published: December 18, 2017 at 11:33 p.m."
