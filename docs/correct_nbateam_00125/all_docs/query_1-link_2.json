        "text": "Jamal Crawford says that when he was growing up in Seattle he used to sneak into the SuperSonics' facilities. There, he'd scrimmage a bit with guard Nate McMillan, who would give the 16-year-old tips on his jumper.\n\n\"He knows my game better than anybody else,\" Crawford said.\n\nCrawford, a free agent who played last season in Atlanta, now plays for McMillan.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 shooting guard agreed to a two-year deal with the Trail Blazers on Thursday. He was introduced at a news conference Friday, along with another Portland free-agent acquisition, forward Craig Smith.\n\nCrawford, who won the NBA's Sixth Man award in 2010, will help fill the void left by the departure of three-time All-Star Brandon Roy. Crawford is expected to be an offensive spark for the second unit in Portland.\n\n\"I like the depth that we have coming off the bench now,\" McMillan said. \"This season, more than any other season, depth is going to be important.\"\n\nPortland opened training camp with the disheartening news that Roy was planning to retire because of ongoing problems with his knees, former No. 1 draft pick Greg Oden had suffered a setback with his recovery from knee surgery, and forward LaMarcus Aldridge required a procedure to treat a heart condition.\n\nBut the Blazers were active in the free-agent market, acquiring Crawford, Smith and center Kurt Thomas, giving the team some toughness and depth.\n\nSmith, known as \"The Rhino\" personifies that toughness. The 6-foot-7, 275-pounder comes to the Blazers after two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHe said he got his nickname from Kevin McHale when both were in Minnesota. McHale told him: \"Man you're just blowing through everybody like a rhino.\"\n\nLike Crawford and McMillan, Smith is close to Blazers center Marcus Camby.\n\n\"He's been a mentor back in L.A. when I was with the Clippers, just a positive influence in my life,\" Smith said. \"It's great to come up here and be with somebody like that.\"\n\nCrawford settled on Portland after also looking hard at an offer from Sacramento. One of the people he talked to before making the choice was Roy, a fellow Seattle native.\n\nAmnesty clause\n\nIn order to make a deal with Crawford, the team used the NBA's new amnesty clause to waive Roy, who was under a max contract and set to make $15 million US this year.\n\nRoy had played all of his five NBA seasons in Portland, but he played with pain for the past two years because he lacks cartilage between the bones in his knees. A fan favorite whom many credit with turning around the team's once-tarnished \"Jail Blazers\" reputation, Roy finished his career with averages of 19 points, 4.7 assists and 4.3 rebounds.\n\nCrawford, an 11-year-veteran, has averaged 15.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 3.9 assists over the course of his career.\n\nSmith averaged 5.4 points and 2.4 rebounds in 48 games last season with the Clippers.\n\nThomas, who signed last weekend, is a 16-year veteran and, at 39, the NBA's oldest active player. Last season with Chicago, he averaged 4.1 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 52 games, including 37 starts.\n\n\"I'm excited to work with this group. We needed depth. We added depth,\" McMillan said. \"Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nAldridge also spoke to reporters Friday, a day before he is cleared to return to practice for non-contact drills. He said he expected to be able to fully join in next week, and will definitely play in the season opener on Dec. 26.\n\nAldridge underwent a procedure last Friday to treat for Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, a condition which causes the ventricles of the heart to contract prematurely. He was diagnosed with the disorder in 2007.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 forward from Texas averaged 21.8 points and 8.8 rebounds last season, the best of his five-year NBA career. He had 36 double-doubles.\n\nAldridge said he was happy he was able to get the procedure over sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I'd rather be healthy for the season than try to push through training camp and then miss some of the season,\" he said. \"It was definitely frustrating, but now I'm good to go.\""
