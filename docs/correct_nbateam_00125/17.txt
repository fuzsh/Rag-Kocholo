Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford, who once played for the Portland Trail Blazers, scored 23 points in a preseason game against his former team on Sunday. In scoring those points, he knocked down 6-of-8 3-pointers, but one in particular garnered a lot of attention.

Crawford caught the ball in the corner, right in front of the Blazers' bench, and lofted up a 3-point attempt and turned toward the Portland bench before his shot reached the rim. The shot, which was highly contested, appeared as if it stayed in the air forever. It eventually came down and it went in.

After the ball hit the net, Crawford moved away from the Blazers bench and turned toward the court. His moment was done in that moment. Still, there's no way the Blazers forgot about it. And he obviously hasn't forgotten his departure from Portland.
