Free agent NBA guard Jamal Crawford displays his new Portland Trail Blazers jersey after being signed in Portland, Ore., Friday, Dec. 16, 2011. In order to make a deal with Crawford, the team used the NBA's new amnesty clause to waive All-Star guard Brandon Roy, who announced his retirement last week because of knee problems. Free against Craig Smith was also signed.(AP Photo/Don Ryan)
