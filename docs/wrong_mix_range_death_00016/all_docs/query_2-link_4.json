        "text": "The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department says in Henderson, Nevada in connection to the murder of Tupac Shakur.\n\nDepartment spokesperson Aden OcampoGomez said in a brief phone call that he couldn't provide further details on the latest development in the case, citing the open investigation.\n\nThe rapper's death remains one of the most controversial unsolved murders of all time.\n\nHis music was viewed as bringing needed attention to contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities. He was also considered a major influencer in social activism for equality and justice.\n\nHe was also a lightning rod for controversy, a target of violence – he was once shot 5 times in a New York recording studio lobby – and was once jailed in 1995 on sexual abuse charges.\n\nShakur was shot Sept. 7, 1996 in Las Vegas. He was there to celebrate a business partner’s birthday. He also attended the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand.\n\nAccording to earlier media reports, at about 11:15 pm, a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac sedan pulled up on the passenger side of the car Shakur was in and someone in the white Cadillac opened fire.\n\nShakur was taken to University Medical Center of Southern Nevada where he was put on life support and heavily sedated. Shakur died on Sept. 13, 1996, at 25.\n\nLargely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time, the six-time Grammy Award nominated Shakur has had five No. 1 albums: 1995’s “Me Against the World,” 1996’s “All Eyez on Me,” and three posthumous releases: 1996’s “The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,” which was recorded under the name Makaveli, as well as 2001’s “Until the End of Time\" and 2004’s “Loyal to the Game.”\n\nIn 2017, he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Snoop Dogg. In June of this year, the rapper received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He’s also had some museum exhibits that paid homage to his life, including “Tupac Shakur. Wake Me When I’m Free,” which opened in 2021.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated accordingly."
