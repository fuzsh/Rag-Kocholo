        "text": "Gun violence among rappers is nothing new. The latest shooting of Punjabi rapper-singer turned politician Sidhu Moose Wala is only a testimony to the fact that the hip-hop community at large has had a long history where artistes have been murdered in broad daylight.\n\nThe first-ever hip-hop artist to be murdered is believed to be Scott La Rock in 1987, who was a founding member of the East Coast hip-hop group Boogie Down Productions. Last year, at least 20 rappers were shot dead. Some of them were internationally acclaimed artistes.\n\nHere's a list of some famous rappers who have been shot dead:\n\nSidhu Moose Wala\n\nMoose Wala, 28, was shot dead on May 29, 2022, in Jawaharke village of Mansa district, Punjab.

Reportedly, his autopsy revealed that he was shot 22 times.\n\nNotorious B.I.G\n\nNotorious B.I.G was shot dead in 1997. A shooter opened fire at him while his car was at a red light.
