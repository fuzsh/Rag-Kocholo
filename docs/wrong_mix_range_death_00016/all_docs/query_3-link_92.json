        "text": "Topline\n\nNearly 30 years after rapper Tupac Shakur was murdered in a drive-by shooting, authorities in Nevada confirmed this week they served a search warrant in connection with the killing—one of the biggest unsolved murders in U.S. history—believed to be tied to the uncle of a long-dead suspect.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background\n\nShakur, a six-time Grammy Award nominee, rose to stardom in the mid-1990s with singles including “Dear Mama,” “California Love,” “Changes” and “All Eyez on Me.” He was shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting on the night of September 7, 1996, while riding in a car with Death Row Records co-founder Marion “Suge” Knight, and died one week later. His murder was one of two fatal drive-by shootings that shook the hip-hop world in a span of just over six months—Christopher Wallace, better known as the Notorious B.I.G. was killed in a drive-by shooting on March 9, 1997.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nLas Vegas police search home in connection to murder of Tupac Shakur (Fox 5)"
