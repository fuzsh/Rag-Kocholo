Supporters say the bills will make Memphis safer, but critics disagree.\n\nNew Laws Include:\n-Reversing Local Bans on Pretextual Traffic Stops: This allows police to stop cars to investigate crimes not related to the driver’s behavior or traffic laws.\n\n-Permitting Teachers to Carry Guns on School Grounds:- A new law enabling teachers to be armed while at school.\n\n-Increasing Penalties for Violent Threats on School Property: Escalates the penalty for threatening violence on school grounds from a misdemeanor to a felony.\n\n-Allowing Juvenile Court Judges to Transfer Children Aged 15 or Older to Adult Criminal Court: This law makes it easier to try older juveniles as adults.\n\n-Upgrading the Penalty for Drag Racing from a Misdemeanor to a Felony: This increases the severity of penalties for those caught drag racing.\n\nTennessee Senate Minority Leader Raumesh Akbari also added, “We didn’t pass anything; we didn’t get to that root cause, but we should. We have opportunities. You look at states like Maryland, cities like Baltimore, where they’ve reduced gun violence by almost forty percent. There are things that we can do. We have to stop being so political, and we have to start being more policy-based.”\n\nIn November, all 99 seats in the Tennessee House of Representatives and half of the 33 seats in the Senate will be up for election.on.\".",
