        "text": "The first and only person charged in connection with Tupac Shakur's murder in 1996 made his first court appearance Wednesday morning.\n\nDuane Davis spoke before Judge Tierra Jones in Clark County District Court. He said he has retained attorney Edi Faal out of Los Angeles, who was unable to attend the hearing, and Jones agreed to push arraignment back to Oct. 19 so Faal could be present.\n\nFaal said in an email to News 3 that he has been \"tasked with helping [Davis] retain counsel in this case\" but declined to comment further.\n\nDavis, also known as Keefe D, after a grand jury indicted him for murder to further promote a criminal gang for the killing of Shakur in Las Vegas.\n\nRELATED |\n\nClark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said Friday that while Davis is not believed to have been the person to pull the trigger, investigators allege he acquired the gun and sought revenge after getting into a fight with Shakur and Marion \"Suge\" Knight while in a casino.\n\nLt. Jason Johansson with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police described Davis as the \"shot caller\" behind the murder.\n\nDavis has long been known to investigators and has himself admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, \"Compton Street Legend,\" that he was in the Cadillac where the gunfire erupted during the September 1996 drive-by shooting. Shakur was 25 when he was gunned down.\n\nHe said his nephew Orlando Anderson was the shooter. Anderson was killed in a gang-related shooting in Compton in 1998.\n\nDavis is being held at Clark County Detention Center without bail."
