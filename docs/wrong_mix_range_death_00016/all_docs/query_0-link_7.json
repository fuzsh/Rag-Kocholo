        "text": "FLINT, MI -- Marijuana smoke trailed Tupac Shakur as he entered the Capitol Theatre front door with a five of his Thug Life partners.\n\nInstead of being introduced from behind the curtains, the 23-year-old rapper strolled through the middle of the crowd of maybe 100 or so ticket holders, including popular Flint artist MC Breed, to headline his first show in downtown Flint.\n\n\"And most of them there was our family and friends,\" party promoter Marvin \"M-Hop\" Hopkins laughs while describing the scene.\n\nLocal acts Top Authority, Black Castophal and Jake the Flake had just completed their sets ahead of him.\n\nBrilliant Minds Productions was charging $15 per person for general admission after spending at least $14,000 to fly in Shakur, plus fulfill his requests of plane tickets and hotel rooms for his entire crew.\n\nThe date was April 16, 1993.\n\nToday, Shakur is arguably hip-hop's most influential figure with an \"All Eyez On Me\" biopic releasing in his honor on June 16th, what would have been his 46th birthday. But back then, he was a budding musician -- fresh off dropping his second solo album.\n\nSure, he was popular, also starring as Roland Bishop in the 1992 film \"Juice,\" but not yet the iconic talent that most people would later identify him as.\n\n\"I didn't know that he would become a living legend but to us, he was already the best,\" Jake the Flake said. \"I didn't know we were living through history in the making at that time.\"\n\nFruit of Islam and police protection made sure things were cool inside the Capitol Theatre as Shakur performed passionately for nearly 45 minutes.\n\n\"Holler If Ya Hear Me,\" \"Keep Ya Head Up,\" \"I Get Around\" and \"Brenda's Got A Baby,\" were his notable hits at the time. Midway through the performance, his popular \"Thug Life\" tattoo across the bottom of his belly was revealed as his shirt flew off.\n\nFans went nuts.\n\n\"He gave his total show and even let me sit on the front of the stage,\" said Andre Loyd, another show promoter and member of Black Castophal.\n\nFor most cities, having Shakur in town would've been enough to highlight the night. But not in Flint.\n\nAfter the show is when all the drama started. In the end, Shakur would cause tension while growing a new legion of fans before ultimately being gunned down at 25 in 1996. Shakur's murder is still unsolved.\n\n\"Pac was a real dude,\" said Ira \"Bootleg\" Dorsey of the Dayton Family. \"That was my guy.\"\n\nI Gotta Get Mine\n\n\"I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind,\" Shakur lip-synced for cameras in baggy blue Karl Kani gear. \"Finger on the trigger ... hand on my 9.\"\n\nJust a few months before the downtown Flint performance, Shakur was in Atlanta for the filming of Breed's new single \"Gotta Get Mine,\" on \"The New Breed\" album. Shakur delivered a guest verse on the track. The footage was shot outside of former Atlanta Falcons receiver and Flint native Andre Rison's multimillion dollar home. Rison, 25 at the time, was coming off a 1992 Pro Bowl season in Atlanta, catching 93 passes for 1,119 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHis 12,000 square-foot mansion included seven bedrooms and a recording studio located near the Country Club of the South in Alpharetta, Ga.\n\n\"I had all the cars, the big body Benzes and Ferraris and toys. They needed to do it right,\" Rison said. \"When Breed asked could he do it, I said 'of course' and the rest is history.\"\n\nThat same home is now notoriously identified as the one destroyed by fire in 1994 by Rison's then-girlfriend, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes of TLC, who is also now deceased.\n\nAfter the video, Shakur stuck around briefly to stay with Rison for about a month and a half, partying at night clubs and even collaborating on a few unreleased tracks, before relocating to California. Rison said he met Lopes for the first time shortly after that while with Shakur during the 1993 Coca-Cola Music Awards in Atlanta.\n\nAll of that stemmed from Breed's video.\n\n\"I knew we had some powerful young black men, very influential to a lot of people, that were all in one room,\" Rison said. \"It was Pac, Breed, D.O.C and myself -- you're talking about some innovative guys in their 20s.\n\n\"It was just a special moment in time because people who were there shooting the video ended up becoming some of the top people in the business at shooting videos,\" he added. \"A lot of people spring boarded off the movement of that record.\"\n\nWelcome to Michigan\n\nA black stretch limousine waited for Shakur when he arrived at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on the morning of April 16, 1993. His Thug Life group members and road manager, Charles Fuller, accompanied him.\n\nShakur's first order of business wasn't getting settled or attending sound check. The rap star had a court appearance.\n\nSo instead of driving to Flint first, Shakur, Hopkins and his camp traveled another 88.6 miles for an hour and 23-minute trip to East Lansing District Court.\n\nShakur was facing criminal charges that stemmed from an April 5, 1993, Michigan State University concert where he was arrested for swinging a baseball bat at Chauncey Wynn, another Flint native and executive director for Rice's Fly Records.\n\nWynn claims they were cool beforehand, even posing for photos and meeting on a prior occasion in Atlanta with former NBA player and Flint standout Glen Rice. But things changed in the heat of the moment once weed and liquor entered his system at MSU, according to Wynn.\n\n\"I let him use my microphone (at MSU) and they cut his music off so he was being Pac. He slammed the mic. I walked on the stage and grabbed our mic,\" Wynn said. \"He tried to hit me with a baseball bat and they tried to rush me. Him and the Thug Life, but they were hitting each other -- none of them hit me.\"\n\nOn that April 16 date, Shakur was in and out of court as he appeared before Judge David L. Jordon for Case No. 93-561. Both an assistant prosecutor and Shakur's attorneys agreed to waive the preliminary exam, according to court records. In September, Shakur would eventually plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge, per Associated Press accounts, and agreed to serve 10 days in the Ingham County Jail.\n\nOnce his legal troubles were handled, Shakur finally made his way to Flint that afternoon. He strolled around the Genesee Valley Center for gear then settled in his hotel room at Holiday Inn before the show.\n\nLoyd and Hopkins' Brilliant Minds Productions reserved the entire fourth floor of the hotel.\n\n\"Basically after everything, the big party was over there on that floor,\" Loyd said. \"It was a wild night.\"\n\nWindmill Place\n\nLack of radio promotion played a big factor in the lackluster turnout at Capitol Theatre, but the rookie promoters were also victims of a double crossing. Little did they know, Stick-N-Move Records was also planning a promotional party for MC Breed's \"The New Breed\" album that same night.\n\nOf course, Breed and Shakur's hit song \"Gotta Get Mine\" was featured on the album, so Stick-N-Move organizers marketed him as a special guest at their show, too - which was happening at the Windmill Place, less than a mile away.\n\nPopular local acts The Dayton Family, Top Authority and Jake the Flake were also performing at the Windmill Place, with west coast legend The D.O.C. in town.\n\n\"They couldn't compete with that,\" Jake the Flake said of Shakur's promoters. \"I wouldn't have done that to those young dudes like that but [Stick-N-Move] didn't have any remorse or compassion for that. But it was a big success and it blew up just like he knew it would. It was the hottest thing in town.\"\n\nThe double-cross also came with rounds of gunfire when Loyd, Hopkins and their friend Louis Williams allege they were shot at in front of the Capitol Theatre after Shakur's show.\n\n\"They were advertising Tupac, so we were supposed to be getting paid,\" Loyd said. \"So as we were on our way over to that gig, to keep us from going, some dudes drove by and started shooting at us right in downtown Flint. So, that pissed me off even more.\"\n\nThat still didn't stop them from barging into the spot.\n\nWilliams said he strolled in at the Windmill Place right next to Shakur.\n\n\"When we got out, I didn't know Tupac had beef,\" Williams said. \"Pac was asking me questions about if Flint was cool? He said, 'I could live here' and blah, blah, blah. So, when we went in the Windmill people were looking at me funny.\"\n\nFootage of Shakur performing \"Gotta Get Mine,\" with Breed, rocking a baggy striped shirt and Thug Life beanie, has made its rounds across Facebook, although he wasn't supposed to. His booking agency was upset when they found out what happened, according to Loyd.\n\nAt least 400 folks packed the tiny room at Windmill Place, with maybe 75 of them on stage, for an epic moment in the city's music history. Not many photos are in existence, but those in attendance will never forget.\n\n\"It was packed,\" said Raheen \"Shoestring\" Peterson of the Dayton Family. \"The video doesn't even do no justice for it.\"\n\nEven Wynn was in the crowd with a group of friends.\n\n\"I was sitting right in front looking dead at him,\" Wynn said. \"I had him nervous. Everybody was trying to jump him but I told them, 'we're cool ... we're cool.' He looked down and saw me.\"\n\nShakur didn't end up staying for the entire Breed show but did party that night in Flint at the hotel. He checked out of his room the next afternoon, with Loyd, Hopkins and Williams riding to drop him off at the Detroit airport.\n\nDuring the ride, the Flint natives claim he felt bad about the promotional situation and left his personal number to someday collaborate on a song, but it never happened for various reasons.\n\nShakur died in 1996.\n\nIf they had the chance to do it all over again, the promoters said they would bring him here again.\n\nHopkins, 45, lives in Sterling Heights and is now an internet DJ host for ZMix97.com while Loyd, 47, continues to work behind the scenes as a manager, mixtape DJ and party promoter in the music industry in Arizona. Williams, 52, still raps as StrangeFruit 8FACE while practicing Kung Fu in Tennessee.\n\n\"He was real cool and gave us some good knowledge,\" Hopkins said.\n\n\"I got a chance to ask him everything about the industry and he just gave us the game in that little amount of time,\" Loyd said. \"It was worth it because it opened up a lot of doors.\"\n\n\"When I got back to my hood, it seemed like everybody was hating us for being with Tupac,\" Williams said. \"I've been feeling hate ever since then like, 'You was with Tupac.' But I was Flint Thug Life.\"\n\nThe Dayton Family, Top Authority and Jake The Flake - who now goes by Jakafella - are also still making music. Jake The Flake is set to release a new book and movie titled \"Payback is Karma\" soon.\n\nFor some, Shakur's legacy is complicated. He's respected as a poet and lyricist on one hand and a thug and rebel for others, but there's no denying his musical influence.\n\nIn 1999, Dorsey released his \"Death Before Dishonesty\" album with a song dedicated to Shakur titled \"Sophisticated Thugs,\" featuring Ras Kass. His tribute sums up Shakur best.\n\n\"Died too soon from unnecessary bullet wounds,\" Dorsey raps. \"Now college professors due lectures in their classrooms on your lyricism.\"\n\nThe trip to Flint was just a small window into the life of Shakur at that time."
