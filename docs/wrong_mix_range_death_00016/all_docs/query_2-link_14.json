        "text": "Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis made his first court appearance on Wednesday in Las Vegas after being charged with the off the Las Vegas Strip in 1996.\n\nnear his Henderson home last week, but it was his ties to Los Angeles that found him front and center in an agreement with federal investigators 14 years ago.\n\n\"We had built a drug case against him, a federal drug case against him, for trafficking in large quantities of cocaine and PCP,\" said retired LAPD homicide detective Greg Kading. \"The whole objective of that drug case was to compel him to cooperate when we approached him on the murders of Biggie and Tupac.\"\n\nIn 2006, Kading was assigned the cold case murder of Biggie Smalls, also known as the Notorious B.I.G., who was murdered in a drive-by shooting about six months after Tupac's killing. Kading has said there are alleged ties between the two murders, which is how he stumbled upon Davis.\n\nKading and other investigators entered into what's called a proffer agreement back in 2009 with Davis.\n\nA proffer agreement allows a defendant or someone under criminal investigation to provide useful, and perhaps incriminating, information that won't be used against them. But, investigators can use that information as derivative evidence to further their investigation.\n\nA proffer agreement does not offer immunity outside the bounds of the statements given. Confusion in those protections could be why Duane Davis eventually wrote a memoir and appeared in multiple interviews, seemingly incriminating himself in the Tupac murder.\n\nI was just like, 'How stupid can you possibly be?'\" said Kading. \"What universe does he think he's living in, wherein he thinks he can just speak openly about his role in a murder and not suffer any consequences?\"\n\nSome have suggested an agreement like that with federal investigators could protect Davis in his upcoming Las Vegas trial, but Kading and other legal experts don't think it'll have much of an effect.\n\n\"I find it hard to believe that a person could misconstrue the proffer agreement. Because it's really simple asyou tell them what you know. And they say, 'We won't use what you say against you, but we use derivative use of it,\" said Las Vegas criminal defense attorney Thomas F. Pitaro. \"If you then go out and say the same thing in a different context than what you said, the subsequent time is admissible.\"\n\nPitaro said the Clark County District Attorney's office and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were likely aware of such an agreement and probably coordinated as a task force with law enforcement in Southern California while building this case to avoid surprises.\n\nAs for Davis speaking multiple times publicly about his apparent role in the shooting of Shakur, Pitaro said he's not surprised based on his years of experience.\n\n\"Let me put it this way, that I tell people,\" he said. \"The fundamental rule of criminal defense is that even a fish wouldn't get caught if they kept his mouth shut.\""
