        "text": "Arthur O. Fisher was a member of the 477th Bombardment Wing. One of the other black officers was lawyer Coleman Young. Young organized a sit-in at the Officers’ Club, which barred black officers. Fisher, Young and the other black officers were arrested, imprisoned at Freeman Field, and threatened with court martial, which could have meant facing a firing squad. They were spared, thanks to the intervention of President Harry Truman. Fisher said his time in the service and his association with men such as Coleman Young and General Chappie James helped him determine to become a judge and to fight for equal justice before the law.\n\nFisher was the first black person to hold many offices in our local judicial system, and he worked to make sure that he was not the last. He was also noted for his innovative rehabilitative programs, including those providing options other than incarceration for juveniles. Judge Fisher died January 24, 2002.\n\nJessie Gooding is most frequently associated with his civil rights activities with the NAACP. However, while working as a Quality Control Chemist at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, he also was instrumental in establishing an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program which was implemented across the country, and, in 1965, the establishment of a full-time EEO office at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nGooding served as a Dayton NAACP officer for thirty-seven years: chairman of the Labor and Industry Committee, seven years; first vice president, eight years, and president, eighteen years. He was arrested and jailed many times as he as he sought justice. He agreed with Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”\n\nIt is not surprising that, in 1993 in Washington, D. C., he demonstrated in support of Haitian immigrants, and was arrested. He also served on the Supreme Court’s Commission on Racial Equality. As artist Clifford Darrett wrote, “Through his service, Skyscraper Jessie Gooding has advanced the struggle for equality and has encouraged others to continue the struggle.”\n\nS. McIntosh began his civil rights activities after being discharged from the Navy. He and the Reverend Cody Bush, employees at Frigidaire’s GM plant, successfully demonstrated against segregation of black workers in the cafeteria, but lost their jobs. Mrs. McIntosh has said that he was fired from every job because he fought for his rights. He also fought in the streets.\n\nIn the 1950s he organized the West Side Citizens Council and led demonstrations against restaurants which would not serve black people. He also led nonviolent demonstrations against government institutions, department stores and businesses which did not hire black people. Those protests helped open job opportunities for black people.\n\nIn the 1960s he served as a leader in many organizations: director of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE), the Non-violent Direct Action Movement, and the Ohio Freedom Movement; Coordinator for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom; advisor for the Dayton Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Operation Breadbasket.\n\nMany employers refused to hire him because of his struggle to desegregate businesses, so he opened a dry cleaning business in Westown. Dry cleaning fluid suppliers refused to do business with him, so he lost that business. Reverend Walter Dunson, who said that he and Mac received telephone calls every day threatening their lives, also said that Mac “lost everything for the cause.”\n\nIn 1969, he acted on an idea of his son, J. W. McIntosh, and opened the House of Knowledge in Westown. In this bookstore Mac later stocked African artifacts and black products.\n\nOn March 4, 1974, he was preparing to open the store in a new location on Main Street. He tried to stop two young men fleeing from an attempted robbery, and one of the young men shot and killed him. McIntosh was hailed as a hero. Reverend David Gilbert Sr. has said that McIntosh would not have gotten the tribute he deserved if he had lain down and died a normal death.\n\nUntil 1944, residents of Benn’s Platt, a half-square mile site now occupied by Welcome Stadium, lacked many basic services. Under the leadership of attorney Fred Bowers, vice-president of the Dayton branch of the NAACP and an officer of the South Side Improvement Association, the residents had gone to the Dayton City Commission twenty-seven times, demanding equal services. The residents finally received hard-paved roads, mail delivery and telephones. When the land was condemned because the Miami Conservancy District planned to use it, Bowers told the residents not to accept the low price they were offered for their homes. Instead, they went to court and received a fair price for their homes.\n\nIn 1950 Bowers became the first African American elected to the state legislature. He served on the committee that initiated the Fair Employment Practices Commission. That commission is responsible for developing and implementing the Ohio Fair Employment Practices Law. Under that law, “it is unlawful in the State of Ohio to deny equal employment opportunity on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, ancestry or age.” Bowers died on October 12, 1973.\n\nLloyd Hathcock, Sr. was a native Daytonian and a graduate of Steel High School. He attended West Virginia State College .\n\nIn 1942, Lloyd Hathcock entered the Tuskegee Airmen School. In the class of 1943, he became the number one cadet with overall flying ability in the 43-K class category.\n\nLloyd was stationed in Europe with the 332″d Firefighter Group of the 30ls1 squadron. Many of his missions consisted of escorting U.S. bombers from Italy to Berlin. He was shot down north of Rome, Italy, captured and imprisoned in Germany’s Stalag Luft Ill prison camp for eleven months before being liberated when General Patton drove back the Germans in April of 1945 .\n\nThis airman was also an artist and inventor. His art often were creative extensions of landscapes, flightscapes, and people.Lloyd, upon his return from WWII service, pursued his other passion besides aviation-photography . By becoming the first black chef in the aerial photography branch at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, he began working with the 49501 Test Wing Division at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. In the early 1950s, he did early work designing a camera that could freeze a frame of a jet plane at mock speed.\n\nThe logo and monument for the Tuskegee Airmen was designed by Lloyd “Scotty” Hathcock and can be viewed at the National Museum of the United States located Wright Patterson Air Force.\n\nCharles was born in Hagerstown,Maryland and moved to Lima, Ohio at three years of age. He attended public schools in Lima, graduating from Central High School in 1938 and then enrolled at UCLA, majoring in aeronautical engineering. Two years later, he withdrew and accepted an appointment to the Aviation Cadet Flying Training Program at Tuskegee in Tuskegee, Alabama . Upon completion of this program he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Corps as a fighter pilot.\n\nC.I. retired from the U.S. Air Force after 23 years of service in 1966. Some of his awards included the Bronze Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal with (4) four Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Congressional Gold Medal. As a command pilot with the Tuskegee Airman he had approximately 8,000 flying hours.\n\nSettling in Dayton, Ohio, he worked for many years at the National Cash Register Company.\n\nMac Ross was a graduate of Roosevelt High School in Dayton, Ohio and graduated from Virginia State College with academic honors. Mac received his pilot license when he was only 18 years of age. After college, he attended Tuskegee Institute Flying School for the Army/Air Force Pilot Training for blacks… the “Tuskegee experiment .”\n\nThe Tuskegee airman not only battled enemies during wartime, but also fought against racism and segregation.\n\nIn 1942, Mac Ross, along with George Roberts, Benjamin Davis, Jr. Charles DeBow, Jr, and Lemuel Custis, was among the first five to receive their Silver Wings as military pilots in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nMac Ross was killed while flying his P-51. He received the Distinguished Fly Cross, the Legion of Merit, and the Purple Heart. Posthumously, the United States Postal service, Dayton, Ohio, dedicated the Mac Ross Memorial Philanthropy in 1989. The portrait hangs in the main post office on East Fifth Street.\n\nArthur 0. Fisher was born in Wilmington, Ohio and came to Dayton at age of 4. He graduated from Steel High School, the University of Dayton, and the University Of Cincinnati College Of Law.\n\nFisher served in WWII as a bombardier-navigator with the Tuskegee Airmen in the 477th Bombardment Squadron. He was a Second Lieutenant in the segregated armed services when he and 100 black airmen were confined to the barracks for 14 days while facing court-martial and possible death penalty after they refused to sign a statement promising to discontinue sit-ins at the white officers club. The stand­-off ended after President Franklin D. Roosevelt died and Harry S.Truman signed an executive order on July 26, 1948 abolishing segregation in the Armed Services.\n\nIn 1953, Fisher was the first black person to work in the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. Ten years later, he became the first black to be elected judge of the Dayton Municipal Court. In 1970, Judge Fisher was the first black to be elected to the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court and later the first black judge of the county’s juvenile court.\n\nDid you know there is a beautiful site in Dayton that attracts more than eighty thousand visitors a year? That site is the Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm.\n\n“Marie Auld and her husband John nurtured their woodland bordering the Stillwater River into a peaceful landscape of streams, flowers and natural growth. They named the site Aullwood. It later became the Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm.\n\nAullwood was one of the first nature centers in the Midwest. It has served as a model and guiding force for the creation of other preserves across the country. Marie Aull’s vision for preserving green space and educating the public about the conservation movement also extended to playing key roles in the founding of Cox Arboretum, the Beavercreek Wetlands Association and the Park District of Dayton and Montgomery County. Marie S. Aull lived to be 105 years old.\n\nShe was inducted into the Wright Dunbar Area’s Walk of Fame in 1987.”\n\nMarie Auld, a conservationist and gardener, is praised as “the godmother of the environmental movement in southwestern Ohio.” She and her husband John worked for many years to preserve this area.\n\nThe entrance is at 955 Aullwood Road in Englewood. Highlights include diverse habitats which facilitate nature study. Nature trails include a mile-long path which visitors can use to walk through woods, a prairie and gardens. The native prairie is a great place to watch birds and other wildlife.\n\nThe Aull home and garden, which date to 1907, are on the Ohio State and the National Historic Registers.\n\nThere are also historical features. The garden and the home, which date back to 1907, are on the Ohio State Register and the National Historic Register.\n\n“Big Macrocarpa,” a giant bur oak, is on the trail to the garden entrance on the banks of the Stillwater River. A mark high on the tree shows the level of the river during the 1913 flood.\n\nDid you know that Jeraldyn Blunden’s many honors include the prestigious McArthur Genius Award?\n\n“Jeraldyne Blunden became the founder and artistic director of the renowned Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, the world’s largest repository of reconstructed dance works by African American choreographers. The Dayton-based company tours the nation and the world, bringing the best of modern dance to new audiences. Ms. Blunden also founded Jeraldyne’s School of the Dance, which has given Valley young people the opportunity to learn about modern dance and even become professional dancers. She also won international acclaim for her work as a choreographer and teacher. Jeraldyne Blunden has received significant recognition for her work, including a 1998 Dance Magazine Award, an Individual Artist Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and a MacArthur “Genius” Award. In 1997 she was named one of five Dance Women: Living Legends, “for keeping dance alive”.\n\nShe was inducted into the Dayton Area’s Walk of Fame in 1999.”\n\nWhen teen-ager Jeraldyne Blunden (nee Kilborn)wanted to take dance lessons in downtown Dayton, she was not allowed to do so because of segregation. Josephine and Hermione Schwarz, who later founded the Dayton Ballet Company, came to Linden Center on Dayton’s West Side to teach Jeraldyne and other young black women to dance.\n\nThe internationally famed DCDC evolved from classes which Jeraldyne Blunden began teaching at Linden Center in 1968. DCDC highlights include *becoming the first African-American dance company to gain membership as a Performing Company in the Northeast Regional Ballet Association (1973), *being one of six American companies (and the only one not based in New York) chosen to participate in the Biennial de la danse in Lyon, France (1986) *and providing arts programs/entertainment programs for 40,000 people world-wide in 2012. Jeraldyne’s daughter Debbie Blunden Diggs, an accomplished choreographer, is the Artistic Director.\n\nDid you know that “Lieutenant Colonel Charity Adams was the first black officer in the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps and the commanding officer of the only organization of black women to serve overseas during World War II? Her book, One Woman’s Army: a Black Officer Remembers the WAAC, recounts her experiences as a pioneer coping with the difficulties of being an African American woman in the army while carrying out the enormous assignment of ensuring that the U.S. mail was delivered to every American sitting in the European theater throughout the war. She enlisted in July 1942. Charity Earley served her community after the war as well, serving on numerous boards including Sinclair Community College, DP & L, Dayton Metropolitan Housing Authority, and the American Red Cross. She was one of the founding members of Leadership Dayton and Parity 2000.–Inducted: 1997. Photograph courtesy of Charity Adams Early. It originally appeared in Dayton’s African American Heritage by Margaret Peters.”\n\nCharity resigned from the WAAC in 1946 and married Stanley Earley. He completed his studies to become a doctor. She earned a master’s degree in psychology from Ohio State University, and served as the director of student personnel at Tennessee A & I College, and director of student personnel and assistant professor of education at Georgia State College. Charity Earley Auditorium at Sinclair Community College and the Charity Adams Earley Girls Academy of the Dayton Public School system honor her service.\n\nHer record of community service includes the Board of Directors of the Dayton Opera Company, the Board of Governors of the American Red Cross, and the Board of Trustees of Sinclair Community College. She volunteered for United Way, the United Negro College Fund, the Urban League, and the YWCA. She also co-directed the Black Leadership Development Program.\n\nHer awards and honors include selection as one of the Dayton Daily News Top Ten Women, induction into the Ohio Women’s Hall of Fame and the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame, inclusion among the Smithsonian Institution’s 100 Most Important Historical Black Women, and honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Dayton and Wilberforce University ln 1991.\n\n“Even if I lose, I win. At least I’m working for a better tomorrow. And if everybody doesn’t try to make tomorrow better than yesterday or today—forget it.”\n\nMrs. Lelia Iles Francis made that challenging, still-relevant statement in 1968, when she ran against C. J. McLin, Jr. for a seat in the 88th District of the Ohio House of Representatives. She lost the election 21,277 to 6,133, but continued to work in many areas to bring positive changes to Dayton.\n\nShe was born in Salt Lake, Kentucky ln 1903. After graduating from Kentucky State College, she devoted nine years to teaching in rural, two-room public schools. In 1943 she and her husband, Charles Francis, came to Dayton.\n\nShe was a pioneer. In 1947 she became the first black woman realtor in Ohio and the second in the United States. Housing in Dayton was rigidly segregated. Working out of the Francis Realty Company, located at 1344 West Third Street/Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Way, Mrs. Francis fought against red-lining–the identification of areas in which black people were not allowed to rent or to own property. She fought for open housing for more than fifty years.\n\nIn 1991, at the Dayton NAACP’s 40th Annual Freedom Fund Banquet, she received the Miley O. Williamson Award. She was serving as a trustee and Sunday School teacher at Phillips Temple C.M.E. Church, and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, the Dayton NAACP and Unity Bank. That bank is now National City Bank at 1158 West Third Street/Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Way.\n\nHer other honors include the Delco Moraine Award for Interest in Better Government, the W.S. McIntosh Award for Unselfish Service and the Education Plaque from the United Negro College Fund. Details about her role in the struggle for jobs, in which she worked closely with W. S. McIntosh, and of her arrest at the age of 91, are in “Civil Rights Activists.”\n\nHave you ever enjoyed a performance or movie at the Victoria Theatre or the Fraze Pavilion, or received treatment at the Kettering Medical Center? If so, you have benefitted from the work of Virginia Kettering. “She changed the face of the region through her philanthropy. She was the single largest contributor to the Kettering Medical Center, which was established as a gift to the community from the Kettering Family and other donors. She was the first individual contributor to the Fraze Pavilion project, and donated $7 million to the Victoria Theatre in downtown Dayton with specific instructions that the historic architecture be preserved, that it remain on a bus line and that it be financially self-supporting. Other institutions which benefited from her vision and generosity include the Air Force Museum, the Dayton Art Institute, the Dayton Philharmonic, the Dayton Performing Arts Fund, the Dayton Ballet and the Miriam Rosenthal Memorial Fund. It was Virginia Kettering’s idea to organize the Holiday Festival in downtown Dayton. A cultural leader in the community, she has helped the arts reach thousands. She was inducted into the Wright Dunbar Area Walk of Fame in 1997.”\n\nShe was born in Bellevue, Kentucky on July 15, 1907. After her family moved to Dayton, she attended Moraine Park School. There she met Eugene Kettering, her future husband. She also attended Margaret Morrison and Carnegie Tech. She received honorary degrees from the University of Dayton, Wright State University, Skidmore College and GMI Engineering &Management Institute, which is now Kettering University.\n\nShe served the community in many ways, including Director of Banc One Corporation; Director, Bank One Dayton, Na; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Young Women’s Christian Association – World Service Council; Asia Society; Air Force Museum Foundation; Robert Crown Center\n\nFor Health Edu0cation (Hinsdale); C.F. Kettering, Inc.\n\nShe died peacefully at the age of 95. Her obituary included her request that any donations should go to the charities she had supported, not to florists. She is entombed at Woodland, but the work she did continues to benefit the community."
