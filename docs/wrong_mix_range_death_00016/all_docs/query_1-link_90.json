        "text": "The Shooting of Tupac Shakur\n\nBang! The sound of a bullet being fired from a gun. To some, a sound of protection and safety, to others sheer agony and pain, and to some unlucky few the last sound they will ever hear. One of these unlucky few happened to be Tupac Shakur on the fateful night of September 7, 1996 at approximately 1:30 a.m. Unfortunately for Tupac he had to listen to a flurry of 15 bullets, some of which buried themselves deep into his chest, while the others ended up in the side of his car. Thus, the saga had come to a tragic close, as was presumed by the media, but in actuality it was just beginning to reach its often-publicized climactic end. Initiating the story of the east coast, west coast battle, which came about through the on-going confrontations between Bad Boy Records from the east and the infamous Death Row Records, who resided in the west (Ro, 288).\n\nTensions had been building between these two record labels since the beginning of the decade and continued to surmount with each new award show and song recorded by any of the rappers under either label. The conflict all began with a few run-ins at parties in which some of the more notable rappers of Death Row such as Tupac, Snoop Dogg, Korupt, and Daz would confront some East coast rappers, mainly the notorious B.I.G., commonly known as Biggie. Biggie never really understood why they had conflicted with him other than that he represented the East and they swore their life to defend the West. Their relationship was mainly played out through the airways in which songs displayed the rappers emotions; these songs came to represent the violent attitude of gangster rap. A few quotes from songs performed by Tupac became famous and thus were thoroug...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...ver more evident, but like the employee said \"why was everybody trying to do something about it after two rap icons were already dead?\" (Ro 366) This controversy is still unsettled and is consistently brought up year after year whenever there is an anniversary album for either rapper. Thankfully, for the rap world the whole East coast versus West coast scene has virtually disappeared, as rappers have gotten older and matured a little. But, do not be surprised to find another controversy sneaking around the corner in the ever-changing rap world where if you do not protect what you have then you might end up dead.\n\nBibliography:\n\nWorks Cited\n\nRo, Ronin.
