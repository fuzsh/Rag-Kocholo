        "text": "Amelia Robinson is the Columbus Dispatch's opinion and community engagement editor. @1AmeliaRobinson\n\nYou take notice when voices of a generation leave the world — particularly if those voices are stolen.\n\nFor many of the generation that proceeded my own, two of those voices belonged to R&B legend Marvin Gaye and rock musician and peace activist John Lennon.\n\nMarvin Gaye's father killed him during a fight in 1984. Lennon, a member of the Beatles, was murdered by David Chapman, a fame-obsessed fan.\n\nThere was resolution in both cases.\n\nGaye's father, Marvin Gaye Sr., pleaded no contest to a voluntary manslaughter charge. Chapman remains in prison for his crime.\n\nFor many in my generation, Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. were ambassadors of truth who still managed to keep the party going.\n\nWhat did Tupac Shakur mean to people?\n\nI was, and remain, a fan to be certain but am in no way a hardcore devotee of either.\n\nYet I remember vividly the sadness I felt when Tupac was murdered in 1996 and Biggie the following year.\n\nTalent, potential and inspiration were ripped from the world. That the murders have remained unsolved is a tragedy and a failure of justice.\n\nWhat is known about arrest of suspect in Tupac Shakur's death?\n\nThis is part of the reason it is so significant that Las Vegas police today arrested a suspect in the death of Tupac Shakur.\n\nMore: Police arrest man in connection to Tupac Shakur 1996 murder: What we know\n\nDuane \"Keffe D\" Davis has been charged with murder with use of a deathly weapon in Tupac's death. A Nevada prosecutor announced the indictment Friday.\n\nHe has long been known to those working the unsolved murder.\n\nDavis admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir that he was in the car involved in the drive-by shooting that claimed Tupac's life.\n\nWhat was it about Tupac?\n\nLike Biggie, Tupac's legend has not subsided since the day he died.\n\nRaised by Afeni Shakur — a member of the Black Panther Party in the '60s and '70s — Tupac was the \"young, gifted and Black\" described in the classic song written by Nina Simone and Weldon Irvine.\n\nThe world — particularly the young, gifted and Black in Ohio and around the nation — took note.\n\nAnd it just was not music. Tupac was part of a Black cultural revolution, appearing in the now classic Black-led films \"Juice\" and \"Poetic Justice\" opposite singer and actress Janet Jackson.\n\nAlthough on the Earth just 25-years, he earned a sort of folk hero status, having used his smarts, troubled background and musical talents to help put both gangsta and party rap on the map.\n\nThrough his music he was a force of nature, poet and activist speaking for and to those who often go unheard in a list of songs that include \"Out on Bail,\" \"I Get Around,\" \"So Many Tears,\" \"Brenda’s got a Baby,\" \"Dear Mama\" and \"How Long will They Mourn me.\"\n\nTo answer that last song title, fans around the world — new and old — have mourned death of Tupac Shakur 27 years.\n\nTime will tell what happens in the case facing Davis, but may the justice humanity longs for and Tupac — and Biggie — deserves finally come.\n\nAmelia Robinson is the Columbus Dispatch's opinion and community engagement editor. @1AmeliaRobinson"
