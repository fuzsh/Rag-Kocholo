        "text": "im very fortunate to own this issue!!\n\ni remember the day he was shot, we was outside hoopin and a friend of mine came out his house and told us that Pac got shot. But we all didnt believe him. we passed it off. we was like yeah right. but later that night when i went home and i saw on BET what happened i was dissapointed.\n\nmy mother wanted to know why he got shot, i told her that she wouldnt understand and its a long story.\n\nbut now in retrospect, pac would still be alive if he didnt mess with Suge. Pac was tryin to be somebody he wasnt even on that night he tried to pose as a gangster when he asked the dude if he was a crip, why would Pac ask that? then after they beat him down yall know the rest. But Suge set him up i think. Plus i think Suge knew Pac was gonna leave him. i felt sorry for Pac man, cause Suge was basically tellin him what to do.\n\nits just a sad story in retrospect when u put all the pieces together cause at that time it was a mystery but now the facts are out there.\n\nMOP -Firing Squad aint no damn 3.5 mics! are u kidding me? thats at least a 4!!\n\nOGC- Da Storm aint no 3.5 mics either thats at least a 4. Even tho my ni**a BIG didnt like them, they was still was ill."
