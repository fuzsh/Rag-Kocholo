        "text": "I'm covering this story because it has largely been ignored by most media. People need to know the truth.\n\nThat is just wrong.\n\nHere's the story of this man.....wait, he is not a man. I will not call him one.\n\nThis dirtbag, and complete waste of skin needs to be removed or banned from Alabama forever!\n\nI do not want to ever again see \"Alabama\" next to his name.\n\nI'm sorry but NONE of the words above come close to describing this Alabama \"man\".\n\nI can't even report everything I have found out about the individual known as Hunter Tatum, 25, who UNFORTUNATELY is from Alabama.\n\nAccording to police, Tatum, allegedly \"executed\" his 26-year-old wife, Summer, as well as their unborn son Everett, over a video game console.\n\nIn addition, this was after his wife found out he was CHEATING ON HER.\n\nWOW.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute or two.\n\nHunter Tatum is the biggest candidate for a speedy trial and death penalty that I have seen in my time here on earth.\n\nAccording to Oxygen True Crime, the prosecutors in Autauga County will seek the death penalty in this case.\n\nThe District Attorney's office also revealed how Summer Tatum begged for the life of her unborn child after a dispute over a broken Xbox or Playstation console.\n\nHe was all too willing to tell the police officers his story/confession shortly after he called 911.\n\nThe officers say that his wife, Summer, was still alive when they responded to the call. She was found moaning in her own blood in the couple's bedroom.\n\nCops were able to locate the weapon, the one they believed was used in the double murder.\n\nThis beautiful, pregnant woman was six months along with her boy she named Everett when this attack happened.\n\nIn addition to all of those facts, she also suffered from cerebral palsy.\n\nShe BEGGED him not to kill her and her baby boy.\n\nThe death penalty is FAR too quick and painless for this lowlife.\n\nHe should SUFFER.\n\nGod Bless you sweet souls, Summer and Everett Tatum.\n\nI'm sorry you met the devil face to face.\n\nRest in peace."
