        "text": "New York State is still trying to combat COVID-19 and is attempting to get even more New York residents vaccinated going into the fall.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Governor Kathy Hochul held a press conference and made a few important announcements, along with providing an update on the pandemic in New York.\n\nHochul announced that 82 percent of New York residents 18 or older have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 73 percent have completed their vaccine dosage. 52 percent of those ages 12-17 have completed their vaccine dosage.\n\nHochul also announced that the state is getting closer to administering vaccine booster shots and that New York is preparing for booster shot rollouts.\n\nThere is still no exact timeline for when booster shots will be rolled out or any deadlines that come along with it for those who are fully vaccinated.\n\nHochul also says that masks will be required at all child care and daycare centers in New York State.\n\nHochul also announced that the New York State Department of Health has been directed to allow basic EMTs to administer vaccines.\n\nThis now adds over 2,000 fully trained vaccinators and another 50,000 basic EMTs will now be eligible for vaccine training.\n\nHochul added that they want to see the economy rebound and that New York can overcome the pandemic, with more people getting their COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis comes a day after Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz and Pegula Sports and Entertainement announced a new vaccine mandate for both Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park and KeyBank Center in Buffalo.\n\nFans 12 and over attending either venue must have at least one vaccine dose completed by Halloween. Starting on October 31st, they must be fully vaccinated. Fans under 12 must wear masks."
