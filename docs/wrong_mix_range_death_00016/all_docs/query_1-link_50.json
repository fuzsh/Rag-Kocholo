        "text": "LAS VEGAS (CNN) - The BMW Tupac Shakur was riding in when he was shot is up for sale.\n\nShakur was gunned down on Sept. 7, 1996, while he was a passenger in the vehicle after leaving a boxing match at the MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas.\n\nDeath Row Records co-founder Suge Knight was driving the leased vehicle at the time of the murder.\n\nNow, Celebrity Cars in Las Vegas is selling the 1996 BMW for $1.75 million.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Cars General Manager Ryan Hamilton, the vehicle has been fixed since the shooting and sold to the public multiple times, likely without those owners knowing its history.\n\nThat was until about four years ago, when a collector realized it was the vehicle Shakur was in after finding a hidden compartment on the side of the door.\n\nThe compartment was likely used to store a gun, Hamilton said.\n\nLast week, Las Vegas police served a search warrant at an area home belonging to Duane Davis, the uncle of Orlando Anderson â€“ the man police believe killed the rapper.\n\nPolice said they are planning to test firearm cartridges that were seized from the home."
