        "text": "This page presents the precise date, time, place and cause of death for various celebrities. If you require additional in-depth biographical data, many of the entries below offer a link to a detailed biographical profile of that individual. Pursuant to our work here at Internet Accuracy Project, most of the profiles also contain error corrections for some of the most common errors you'll find in reference books and on the Web.\n\nNOTE: All times of death reported on this page are from the local time zone where the death actually occurred.\n\nNote that we never round off times of death, and report them as they appear on official documents, such as death certificates, or were reported by the hospital, family members or other officials. Even so, the \"official\" time of death that appears on death certificates is usually the time that the local coroner confirmed the death for him/herself. This is almost always several minutes, hours, or in rare cases, days after the death actually occurred. In cases where the precise time of death and the \"official\" time of death may differ, we try to offer both, along with an explanation.\n\n5\n\nOccupation: Multi-Academy Award-winning American actor of High Noon, Sergeant York, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Meet John Doe, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, The Westerner, and The Pride of the Yankees fame.\n\nDate, time, place and cause of death: May 13, 1961, at 12:27 p.m.*, at 200 N.
