        "text": "All Times Eastern. PBS programming varies regionally.\n\nFriday, May 12\n\nDear Mama\n\nFX, 10pm\n\nSeries Finale!\n\nThe documentary series chronicling rap icon Tupac Shakur and his relationship to his mother, Afeni, concludes with “Until the End of Time.”\n\nCity on Fire\n\nApple TV+\n\nNew Series!\n\nBased on Garth Risk Hallberg’s epic 944-page bestselling novel City on Fire, this new series tells the intricate tale of a shooting in Central Park, and how the victim, a young NYU student, connects a string of mysterious fires, the downtown punk scene and a wealthy real estate family with a lot of secrets around the turn of the century. “We were interested in a post-9/11, pre-Occupy Wall Street New York,” said cocreator Josh Schwartz, of its unique 2003 setting, which was a fun blast to the past, full of flip phones and bootcut jeans galore. The eight-episode drama is led by Jemima Kirke, Chase Sui Wonders and Wyatt Oleff. The first three episodes are available today; new episodes drop Fridays.\n\nStill: A Michael J. Fox Movie\n\nApple TV+\n\nThis film incorporates documentary, archival and scripted elements to tell Michael J. Fox’s extraordinary personal and professional triumphs and travails in his own words, drawn from unprecedented access to the actor and his family.\n\nCrater\n\nDisney+\n\nOriginal Film!\n\nThis coming-of-age sci-fi adventure is the story of Caleb Channing (Isaiah Russell-Bailey), who was raised on a lunar mining colony and is about to be permanently relocated to an idyllic faraway planet following the death of his father (Scott Mescudi).

Tora! Tora!\n\nMOVIES!, 2:10pm\n\nCatch a Classic!\n\nAn Oscar winner for its visual effects, this 1970 dramatization of the lead up to, and execution of, the Japanese attack on U.S. naval bases at Pearl Harbor in 1941 is a fascinating and compelling international coproduction between the two countries that had been mortal enemies three decades earlier. Two separate productions — one in America, directed by Richard Fleischer, and one in Japan, helmed by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku (legendary director Akira Kurosawa had initially been attached to the project) — created the separate sequences woven together for the film that bring us into the minds of the participants on both sides (the Japanese sequences are subtitled in English). Notables among the large cast are Joseph Cotten as Secretary Henry Stimson, George Macready as Secretary Cordell Hull, Martin Balsam as Adm. Husband E. Kimmel, Keith Andes as Gen. George C. Marshall, James Whitmore as Vice Adm. William Halsey Jr., Sô Yamamura as Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto and Asao Uchida as Gen. Hideki Tojo.\n\nS.W.A.T.: “Forget Shorty”\n\nCBS, 8pm\n\nIn “Forget Shorty,” the first part of a two-part season finale, SWAT teams up with the DEA, led by Mack Boyle (guest star Timothy Hutton), to conduct a massive gang sweep, only to discover that a vicious cartel is planting roots in the city and endangering numerous lives.\n\nThe Jane Mysteries: Inheritance Lost\n\nHallmark Movies & Mysteries, 9pm\n\nOriginal Film!\n\nSinger Jane Da Silva (Jodie Sweetin) inherits a nonprofit detective agency. Mentored by her aunt, Sadie (Paris Jefferson), and Detective John Cameron (Stephen Huszar), she takes on her first case, about a mother’s untimely death years before. As Jane investigates, she realizes that digging up the past can be dangerous.\n\n100 Day Dream Home\n\nHGTV, 9pm\n\nSeason Premiere!\n\nThe new season kicks off with a two-episode special. Lifelong Floridians Andi and Pete always dreamed of owning oceanfront property, so when a vintage beachside hotel in Indian Shores, Florida, called The Sunburst Inn went on the market, they snapped it up immediately. But the 75-year-old, 12-room hotel is sorely in need of a refresh, so the couple have called on Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt to turn it into a dream destination before peak tourist season begins. That means a complete renovation, inside and out, in only 100 days!\n\nGreat Performances: “Celebrating 50 Years of Broadway’s Best”\n\nPBS, 9pm\n\nEnjoy a show-stopping revue of milestone shows and songs from 1973 to 2023 in this 90-minute special hosted by two-time Tony Award winner Sutton Foster.

That is despite the fact that it is not as close to its original source material, the novella “Who Goes There?” by John W. Campbell, as Carpenter’s superb 1982 remake, simply titled The Thing, was. Although the titular threat is not a shapeshifter here, it is still memorably and menacingly portrayed by James Arness in an early, pre-fame role. Director Christian Nyby (with Hawks contributing, to a degree; the realistic, fast-paced and overlapping dialogue heard in this movie is certainly one of his trademarks) effectively creates suspense with the claustrophobic conditions surrounding the group of military and scientific minds trapped with the Thing at an Arctic base (even as they are also at odds with each other on how to deal with the situation), and there are some moments that still have the ability to surprise viewers. The cast works well together and is led by Kenneth Tobey, who would become familiar as a similar military character type in other ’50s sci-fi classics like The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and It Came From Beneath the Sea (1955).\n\nNTT IndyCar Series: GMR Grand Prix\n\nNBC, 3:30pm Live\n\nTop drivers Marcus Ericsson, Pato O’Ward and Scott Dixon take to Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s 2.439-mile, 14-turn road course for the GMR Grand Prix.\n\nMLB Baseball\n\nFOX & FS1, beginning at 4pm Live\n\nAn MLB doubleheader on FOX Sports starts with the Texas Rangers at the Oakland A’s on FS1.

Dodgers or the Houston Astros at the Chicago White Sox.\n\nInto the Wild Frontier: “William Bartram: America’s First Great Naturalist”\n\nINSP, 6pm\n\nNaturalist William Bartram explores the unmapped regions of the South to document the native fauna and flora. But after surviving many encounters with Native Americans and wildlife, it’s an invisible virus that may finally end the journey and his life.\n\nXFL Football: Championship\n\nABC, 8pm Live\n\nThe first season of the revived XFL pro football league wraps up with the championship game between the Arlington Renegades and the D.C. Defenders tonight at the Alamodome in San Antonio.\n\nDream Moms\n\nHallmark Channel, 8pm\n\nOriginal Film!\n\nDanielle (Tamera Mowry-Housley) and Claire (Chelsea Hobbs) once had dreams of making it to Broadway. Years later, consumed with motherhood, they have no time for themselves and have deferred their dreams.

Following that is the epic, Best Picture Oscar-nominated romantic drama Doctor Zhivago (1965); while filled with spectacular scenes, the film’s dreamlike sequence with Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in the icebound dacha seems to stick with many viewers of the film, and it can make you feel cold even in the comfort of your own home.

Set in rural Connecticut in the 1930s, the film follows identical twin brothers Niles and Holland Perry (played by real-life twins Chris and Martin Udvarnoky), who live on their family’s farm. Like most 12-year-olds, Niles and Holland occasionally get into mischief; the only trouble is that when Holland gets into mischief, people tend to “accidentally” die.

Starring in a speaking lead role for the first time, Brooks plays a psychiatrist with a very Hitchcockian name — Dr. Richard Thorndyke — who suffers from the titular nervous condition, a combination of acrophobia and vertigo. Speaking of vertigo, Hitchcock’s classic film Vertigo is just one of the Master of Suspense’s films that are uproariously parodied here — you can also keep an eye out for straight-out spoofs of scenes from The Birds, Psycho and Spellbound. Beyond these specific callouts, Brooks also lovingly, and painstakingly, re-creates the overall look and style of Hitch’s films, from the directorial choices to color schemes. That aspect makes this film particularly enjoyable for students of Hitchcock’s work, and perhaps a little more niche than something like Blazing Saddles, but no less funny. Joining Brooks onscreen here, and as great as ever, are his frequent collaborators Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman and Madeline Kahn.\n\nMLB Baseball\n\nFOX & FS1, beginning at 4pm Live\n\nSaturday MLB action starts with the Milwaukee Brewers at the Tampa Bay Rays on FS1, followed by regional coverage of either the L.A.

As she does, she meets Adam (David Gridley), a native Puebloan park ranger, who helps her along the way."
