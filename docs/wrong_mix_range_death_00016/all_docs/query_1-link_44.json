        "text": "Fans and the music industry Saturday lamented the death of controversial rap star Tupac Shakur, who died six days after being shot in a gangland-style ambush.\n\nThe rapper's short and explosive life ended Friday in University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he had been in critical condition since the shooting Sept. 7 near the famed Las Vegas strip.\n\nThe 25-year-old singer and actor's died of \"respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest,\" the hospital said. Surgeons removed his right lung last Sunday.\n\nThe death of Shakur, one of the most controversial performers of hard-core \"gangsta\" rap, saddened and shocked the fans who had snapped up millions of his records.\n\nHis fellow rap star Coolio said: \"Despite some of his shortcomings, he always gave you something with his music. He gave you something to think about, or he gave you something to laugh about, or he gave you something to cry about.\"\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson, who prayed with Shakur's mother at the rapper's bedside last Sunday, told the Los Angeles Times, \"This is so, so sad. Sometimes the lure of violent culture is so magnetic that even when one overcomes it with material success, it continues to call. He couldn't break the cycle.\"\n\nShakur was best known for raw lyrics laced with violence, sex and profanity describing life in the black ghetto. His latest album, \"All Eyez on Me,\" released this year, celebrated his outlaw image and sold several million copies.\n\nThe rap star's life often mirrored the violence portrayed in his music. On Sept. 7, a gunman in a white Cadillac opened fire on Shakur's car as he drove with friends to a Las Vegas nightclub after watching the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon world heavyweight title fight. Shakur was hit four times.\n\nPolice made no arrests and said they had no suspects, no motive and no leads.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDozens of fans, who gathered Friday evening outside the medical center, described how Shakur's music had struck a chord with them because it reflected urban realities.\n\nNathan Byrd, an 18-year-old Las Vegas high school student, said he liked \"the way he brings reality out in words. He's telling the truth.\"\n\nAdrian Parker, 17, also a high school student, theorized that \"somebody got to him because he was being successful.\"\n\nShakur was beloved by fans and reviled by conservative politicians for songs that celebrated violence and misogyny. But some of his work had a compassionate side and contained positive messages about women and fatherhood, critics said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times said Shakur's death, coupled with the recent departure of talented producer Dr. Dre, added to the woes of Death Row Records, the label for which Shakur recorded.\n\nDeath Row co-founder Marion \"Suge\" Knight, 31, was in the car with Shakur and suffered a minor injury in the shooting.\n\nShakur appeared in several movies, including \"Juice\" and \"Poetic Justice\" with Janet Jackson. On Aug 30 he finished filming \"Gang Related,\" an urban crime thriller in which he plays a detective. The movie was due for release next year.\n\nShakur, who lived in Los Angeles, was rarely out of trouble, spending much of the last 2 1/2 years in court, prison or hospitals.\n\nIn November 1994 he was shot five times while being robbed of $40,000 in jewels in the lobby of a Manhattan recording studio.\n\nIn February 1995 he was sentenced to prison for involvement in a sexual attack on a 21-year-old woman in a New York hotel room. He spent eight months behind bars until he was released pending his appeal.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
