Suddenly they’re keenly aware of things beyond their block in Queens, things that are happening in the world—like the shooting of Tupac Shakur—and in search of their Big Purpose in life. When—all too soon—D’s mom swoops in to reclaim her, and Tupac dies, they are left with a sense of how quickly things can change and how even all-too-brief connections can touch deeply.\n\nIncludes a Discussion Guide by Jacqueline Woodson\n\n\"A slender, note-perfect novel.\"—The Washington Post\n\n\"The subtlety and depth with which the author conveys the girls' relationships lend this novel exceptional vividness and staying power.\"—Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Jacqueline Woodson has written another absorbing story that all readers—especially those who have felt the loss of a friendship—will identify with.\"—Children's Literature\n\n\"Woodson creates a thought-provoking story about the importance of acceptance and connections in life.\"—VOYA"
