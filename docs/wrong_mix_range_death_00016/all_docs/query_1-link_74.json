        "text": "The headlines read Tupac Shakur arrested in Miami. These are not flashbacks to the early and mid-90s, but a new story and not connected to the late Death Row rapper.\n\nThe person arrested is actually named Tupac Shakur and is a 34-year-old woman.\n\nAccording to CBS News, she was arrested on Tuesday, Sept. 6, outside of Hialeah Hospital at 651 E. 25th St. in Hialeah, FL.\n\nAllegedly, Ms. Shakur borrowed a line from her namesake and played “Hit ‘Em Up” with a baseball bat, striking a man sitting on the bench. Luckily, the man was able to secure the bat from the woman.\n\nAt this point, she ran to the hospital, where officers arrested her. Though the man suffered injuries from the altercation, he did not want to go to the hospital for medical treatment.\n\nThis event happened a day before the 26th anniversary of Pac’s death.\n\nThe arrest of Tupac in Florida is not the first time a person with the same name as the revered rapper was arrested. In 2019, a white guy named Tupac Shakur was arrested in for possession of meth and other charges.\n\nOn Sept. 7, 1996, the original Tupac Amaru Shakur was murdered in Las Vegas, NV. Unfortunately, the murderers responsible for his death were never found.\n\nTupac was sitting in a BMW with his label owner Suge Knight when a Cadillac pulled up and shot into the car, striking the platinum-selling artist and robbing the world of one of the most prolific artists of a generation.\n\nHis death shifted and exploited the innocence of the culture, never to be restored."
