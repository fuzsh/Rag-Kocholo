        "text": "One of the last living witnesses to hip hop legend Tupac Shukar's 1996 drive-by shooting death has been indicted on murder charges.\n\nThe Las Vegas Police Department held a news conference Friday afternoon announcing Duane “Keffe D” Davis' indictment in the case that has frustrated investigators for years.\n\nOn Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW driven by Death Row Records founder Marion “Suge” Knight in a convoy of about 10 cars. They were waiting at a red light near the Las Vegas Strip when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted. Shakur was shot multiple times and died six days later.\n\nDavis has long been known to investigators and has himself admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, “Compton Street Legend,” that he was in the Cadillac where the gunfire came from.\n\nHe isn’t the accused gunman but was described as the group's ringleader by authorities. In Nevada you can be charged with a crime, including murder, if you help someone commit the crime.\n\nAs time went on, this case had been reviewed multiple times by different investigators assigned to my section,\" police said during the conference. \"But it wasn't until 2018 that this case was in reinvigorated as additional information came to light related to this homicide. Specifically, Dwayne Davis's own admissions to his involvement in this homicide investigation that he provided to numerous different media outlets.\"\n\nPolice said a rival of Shakur, Davis' nephew Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, was involved in a casino brawl with the rapper shortly before the shooting in Las Vegas, a fight that investigators referenced during the conference and showed video footage from.\n\nAfter the casino brawl, “Mr. Davis formulated a plan to exact revenge upon Mr. Knight and Mr. Shakur” in his nephew’s defense, according to Clark County Chief Deputy District Attorney Marc DiGiacomo.\n\nDavis was arrested Friday morning by the LVMPD's Criminal Apprehension Team as a result of what police called \"decades of work.\"\n\nA Clark County grand jury indicted Davis, 60, on one count of open murder with use of the deadly weapon with a gang enhancement. He is set to appear in court sometime in the next few days for a hearing that will determine his custody status and set a jury trial date.\n\nI know a lot of people have been watching and waiting for this day,\" Las Vegas Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said during the conference. \"Tupac Shakur is a music legend. And for a long time, this community and world have been wanting justice for Tupac. Today we are taking that first step. Tupac was actually quoted as saying 'Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive. Never surrender.' Well, we didn't surrender.\"\n\nOfficials emphasized that the indictment is only the beginning of the process and promised \"successful prosecution\" going forward.\n\nThe rapper’s death came as his fourth solo album, “All Eyez on Me,” remained on the charts, with some 5 million copies sold. Nominated six times for a Grammy Award, Shakur is still largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time.\n\nShakur was feuding at the time with rap rival Biggie Smalls, who was fatally shot in March 1997. At the time, both rappers were in the middle of an East Coast-West Coast rivalry that primarily defined the hip-hop scene during the mid-1990s.\n\n____"
