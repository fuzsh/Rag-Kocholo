        "text": "LAS VEGAS — Authorities in Nevada served a search warrant this week in connection with the long-unsolved killing of rapper Tupac Shakur nearly 30 years ago, they confirmed Tuesday.\n\nShakur, one of the most prolific figures in hip-hop, was killed on the night of Sept. 7, 1996, in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. He was 25.\n\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the search warrant was executed Monday in the nearby city of Henderson. Detectives were in search of items belonging to the uncle of one of Shakur's rivals, according to warrant documents obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nResidents of the neighborhood in foothills about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of the Las Vegas Strip said they saw officers detain two people – a man and a woman – outside the home Monday night while investigators searched the one-story property.\n\nDepartment spokesperson Aden OcampoGomez said in a brief phone call that he couldn't provide further details on the latest development in the case, citing the open investigation.\n\nThe case is being presented to a grand jury in Las Vegas, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. The timing and results of those proceedings was unclear, and the person did not identify the two people whom police encountered at the house. Nevada does not have a statute of limitations for prosecuting homicide cases.\n\nUncle of Tupac Shakur rival previously implicated nephew in rapper's death\n\nThe home that Las Vegas police raided in connection with the shooting of Shakur is tied to one of the only surviving witnesses to the crime, a man long known to investigators whose nephew was seen as a suspect shortly after the rapper's killing.\n\nDetectives sought items “concerning the murder of Tupac Shakur” from Duane “Keffe D” Davis, according to warrant documents. Davis, now 60, is a self-described “gangster\" and the uncle of Orlando Anderson, one of Shakur’s known rivals. Anderson denied involvement in Shakur’s killing at the time, and died two years later in a shooting in Compton, California.\n\nPolice reported collecting multiple computers, a cellphone and hard drive, “documentary documents,” a Vibe magazine that featured Shakur, “purported marijuana,” several .40-caliber bullets, two “tubs containing photographs” and a copy of Davis’ 2019 tell-all memoir, \"Compton Street Legend.”\n\nIt was not immediately known if Davis has a lawyer who can comment on his behalf. Messages left for Davis and his wife, Paula Clemons, weren’t returned. Records show the two were married in Clark County, Nevada, in 2005.\n\nIn a 2018 interview for a BET show, Davis admitted to being in the front seat of the shooters' vehicle and implicated his nephew in the shooting, saying Anderson was one of two people in the backseat. Davis said the shots were fired from the back of the car, though he stopped short of naming the shooter, saying he had to abide by the “code of the streets.\"\n\nHow did Tupac die?\n\nShakur was gunned down while sitting inside a black BMW with Marion “Suge” Knight, head of Death Row Records, after watching a championship fight between Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon at the MGM Grand. After the fight, Shakur, Knight and associates were involved in a fight at the hotel.\n\nPolice have said Knight and Shakur were waiting at a red light near the Las Vegas Strip when a white Cadillac with four men inside pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted. Shot multiple times, Shakur was rushed to a hospital, where he died six days later.\n\nNo arrests have ever been made. Las Vegas police have said in the past that the investigation quickly stalled in part because witnesses refused to cooperate.\n\nShakur’s death came amid his feud with rap rival the Notorious B.I.G., who was fatally shot six months later. At the time, both rappers were in the middle of the infamous East Coast-West Coast rivalry, which primarily defined the hip-hop scene during the mid-1990s. The feud was ignited after Shakur was seriously wounded in another shooting during a robbery in the lobby of a midtown Manhattan hotel.\n\nShakur openly accused B.I.G. and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs of having prior knowledge of the shooting, which both vehemently denied. The shooting sparked enough of a feud that created a serious divide within the hip-hop community and fans.\n\nThe New York-born Shakur represented the West Coast after he signed with Los Angeles-based Death Row Records. He often traded verbal jabs in the media and through songs. B.I.G. and Combs hailed from the East Coast while representing New York City-based Bad Boy Records.\n\nLargely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time, the six-time Grammy Award-nominated Shakur has had five No. 1 albums: 1995’s “Me Against the World,” 1996’s “All Eyez on Me,” and three posthumous releases: 1996’s “The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,” which was recorded under the name Makaveli, as well as 2001’s “Until The End of Time” and 2004’s “Loyal to the Game.”\n\nTupac 'defied the distinction between art and activism'\n\nIn June, Shakur's family and friends joined together to honor him posthumously with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe rapper's sister, Sekyiwa \"Set\" Shakur, accepted the award, while radio personality Big Boy emceed the event.\n\n\"He defied the distinction between art and activism,\" Big Boy said at the start of the ceremony. \"Though his career lasted just five years, Tupac Shakur remains one of the most complex and prolific artists of his generation with over 75,000 records sold worldwide.\"\n\n50 years of hip-hop: Lil Jon, E-40 on how BET network helped hip-hop grow and thrive\n\nGuest speakers including Allen Hughes and Jamal Joseph, director and executive producer for \"Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur,\" an FX docuseries released in April focusing on Shakur's relationship with his mother, Afeni Shakur, spoke at the ceremony.\n\n\"How fitting in the year of hip hop's 50th anniversary that the art form's most transcendent star is finally being placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,\" Hughes said as he took the podium. \"Tupac Amaru Shakur has become a global symbol of rebellion — a symbol as visible and important as Malcolm X and Che Guevara and an inspiration to activists today.\"\n\nHughes added: \"Indeed the entire world feels Tupac's message. Not so bad for a little Black boy from Harlem, right?\"\n\nTupac's lasting impact and legacy on Hip-hop\n\nShakur's professional music career only lasted five years, but Shakur secured 21 Billboard Hot 100s, including top 10 hits “Dear Mama\" and \"Old School” in 1995, and his best-known track, 1996’s “How Do U Want It/California Love” featuring K-Ci and JoJo. The latter spent two weeks at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 from his final studio album and Death Row Records debut, “All Eyez on Me.”\n\nAccording to entertainment data company Luminate, Shakur has sold 33 million albums, 41 million when including track sale and streaming equivalents. The rapper’s on-demand video and audio streams total 10.1 billion.\n\nIn 2017, Shakur was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Snoop Dogg. He’s also had some museum exhibits that paid homage to his life, including “Tupac Shakur. Wake Me When I’m Free,” which opened in 2021.\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe and Joy Ashford, USA TODAY"
