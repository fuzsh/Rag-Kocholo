        "text": "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear found himself apologizing on Tuesday (April 28) to a citizen of his state whose real name is Tupac Shakur after he pointed to the manâ€™s unemployment claim as an example of fraud.\n\n\"I talked to him on the phone today. I apologized,\" Beshear said, according to PEOPLE. \"I told him how it happened. But it's my fault. He was gracious. I said I'm sorry if I embarrassed him or caused him any attention he didn't want. He ended the call, 'God bless.' \"\n\nAt a time when unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic is skyrocketing, clogging the unemployment system with phony applications is no laughing matter. So, on Monday, Beshear planned to make an example of a person he thought was a prankster.\n\n\"We had somebody apply for unemployment for Tupac Shakur here in Kentucky,\" Beshear said during his Monday press conference.\n\nThe full name of the Kentucky applicant is Tupac Malik Shakur.\n\nShakur, the rapper, died in 1996 after being shot and killed in Las Vegas.\n\nState officials are now working on the unemployment claim that was filed in March.\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
