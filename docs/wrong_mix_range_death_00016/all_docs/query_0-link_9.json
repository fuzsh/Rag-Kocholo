        "text": "Biggie Smalls was shot in a drive-by at the intersection of Fairfax Ave and Wilshire Blvd on March 9, 1997 after leaving a Vibe Magazine party in Los Angeles with his entourage. They were able to drive to nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. His second studio album, a double disc set called Life After Death, was released fifteen days later on March 25.\n\nJust like Tupac Shakur's death in Las Vegas the year before, the murder of Biggie Smalls remains unsolved."
