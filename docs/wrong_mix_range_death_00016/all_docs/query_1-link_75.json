        "text": "Eighteen years after he was gunned down on Las Vegas Strip, a policeman who was first on the scene has revealed what the famous rapper's final last words were.\n\nRetired cop Chris Carroll was on bike patrol when Tupac was murdered on 7th September 1996, and found the California Love star slumped in the seat of his car.\n\nHe asked the rapper what had happened to him, and who had shot him, but the rapper simply took his last breath and muttered, \"F*** you.\"\n\nHere are the top ten final words of other famous faces through history...\n\n1. Queen Marie Antoinette : \"Pardon me, sir. I did not do it on purpose.\"\n\nThe Queen of France muttered these words when she accidentally stepped on the executioner's foot as she went to the guillotene.\n\nShe was beheaded on October 16th 1793 after she was tried and convicted of treason.\n\n2. Mozart : \"The taste of death is upon my lips. I feel something that is not of this Earth.\"\n\nThe classical composer died aged 35 on December 5th, 1791, after a short illness.\n\nHe was completely unconscious for the two hours leading to his death and his body swelled so he could no longer sit up in bed or move on his own.\n\n3. Karl Marx : \"Go on, get out! Last words are for fools who haven't said enough!\"\n\nThe German philosopher shouted this at his housekeeper when she asked if he had any last words.\n\nHe died on March 14th, 1883, from bronchitis and pleurisy after falling ill 15 months before.\n\n4. Oscar Wilde : \"My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One or the other of us has to go.\"\n\nThe Irish playwright's final words were tainted with his wit as he lay ill before his death.\n\nHe died on November 30th, 1900, aged 46 after contracting cerebral meningitis.\n\n5. Jack Daniels : \"One last drink, please.\"\n\nThese were the fitting last words of the famous whiskey distiller, who died on October 10th, 1911, of blood poisoning after an infection spread from his injured big toe.\n\nHis last words were used in an advertising campaign for Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey in 2006.\n\n6. Malcolm X : \"Brothers! Brothers, please! This is a house of peace!\"\n\nAs a disturbance broke out while he was giving a speech in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom, the Muslim speaker was assassinated by a member of the crowd.\n\nWhen he tried to calm the situation, a man rushed forward and shot him with a sawn-off shotgun as two others fired handguns.\n\n7. Groucho Marx : \"Die, my dear? Why, that's the last thing I'll do!\"\n\nAs his health deteriorated, the American comedian and film star died of pneumonia on August 19th, 1977.\n\nHe had the longest life of all the Marx brothers and once joked in an interview that his epitaph read: \"Excuse me, I can't stand up.\"\n\n8. Bob Marley : \"Money can't buy life.\"\n\nThe reggae star uttered his last words to son Ziggy before he died on May 11th, 1981, from malignant melanoma which was found in his toe in July 1977.\n\nHe refused to have it amputated and the disease eventually spread to his lungs and brain.\n\n9. Steve Irwin : \"Don't worry, they don't usually swim backwards.\"\n\nThe Australian wildlife expert was killed while filming a documentary on September 4th, 2006.\n\nHe was fatally pierced in the chest by a stingray spine while snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n10. Steve Jobs : \"Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.\"\n\nTechnology inventor Jobs gazed into the distance and uttered these words as he lay dying of pancreatic cancer at his home in California.\n\nHe had inspired millions with his Apple inventions before his death aged 56."
