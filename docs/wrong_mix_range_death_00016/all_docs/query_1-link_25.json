        "text": "On March 9, 1997, the bustling nightlife of Los Angeles came to a startling halt as shots rang out of a black SS Impala, showering a man with bullets and ending his life. Christopher Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls or the Notorious B.I.G., died at approximately 1:15 that morning (Hendrickson 29-31). Wallace’s death interests multiple people for various reasons, such as how quickly it happened after Tupac Shakur’s murder and how much the murders reflected one another (Hendrickson 29-31). The absence of evidence revealing Biggie’s killer leaves a wide gap for others to conspire theories and spread lies (Sullivan 124-127).\n\nThe answers to his shocking death lie somewhere, hidden away in an effort to cover up the appalling crime that ended …show more content…\n\nThe companies had ties to gangs, such as the Bloods or Crips, which aided the development and increased the severity of the bad relationship between both labels.The two popular label companies hosted Tupac Shakur (Death Row) and Biggie Smalls (Bad Boy), both already extremely well-known as one another’s rap rivals (Hendrickson 29-31). Tupac, on the West Coast, made many songs attacking the East Coast, and it made a huge impact on this “gang war” (Chadwick). The tension had not always existed, but as soon as it arose, the record companies fueled the fire between them in an effort to raise record sales. Lance Rivera, a partner of Wallace’s, reduces Biggie’s role in the rivalry. “\"He and Tupac didn't have no beef,\" Rivera says. \"They was real close friends. Tupac developed a hate for him. [Wallace] couldn't understand what it was, but he never responded. He said, 'I'm not going to feed into it.'” (Hendrickson 29-31). After Tupac’s murder happened in Las Vegas, the feud between the rap labels settled but emerged again when Biggie died (Hendrickson 29-31). The slaying of two artists in less than six months shocked and angered people. They wanted this battle to end before more lives ended abruptly. Today, the two labels largely involved, Bad Boy and Death Row, have faded away after the murders of their greatest stars …show more content…\n\nKnight maintained the reputation of a dangerous man, despite his immense wealth and power. Most clients even tried to leave him after a short period of time of working with him (Sullivan 124-147). His familiarity with the police for breaking the law helped him gain this bad reputation. Though he has never received a conviction for the murder, the evidence supporting his involvement in the murder of not only Christopher Wallace but also Tupac Shakur seems wrong to not transpire as the truth. He may not have pulled the trigger on Wallace, but detectives and other rap artists strongly believe he ordered the murder (Sullivan 80-86). Officers found gunshot residue in his car, as well as multiple phone calls placed to Death Row, handing the detectives more evidence supporting his involvement (Pearson). Ha’mmond, Knight’s inmate for a different crime, testified to a confession made by Knight that he hired someone to kill Biggie to show him that the Blood gang “got him on the Westside” (Pearson). In June 1997, a Death Row employee said he overheard Suge Knight bragging about killing Biggie Smalls, but another employee also said she heard David Kenner planned the kill (Sullivan 80-86). The various theories, although different, all have one connecting spot, Suge"
