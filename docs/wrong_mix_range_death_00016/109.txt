A Tennessee man named Tupac Shakur was arrested on Saturday, after he pulled a knife on Johnson City police, Johnson City Pressreports.

Authorities were called and alerted about the presence of Shakur, who had warrants out for his arrest, at about 5:40 p.m. on Saturday. When police arrived, a car with Shakur inside fled the scene, but the vehicle was found later that night.

Officers attempted to apprehend Shakur, but he pulled away and reached inside his waistband and retrieved a knife. As he turned towards them with the knife in his hand, Tupac was wrestled to the ground and subdued. A number of meth baggies, along with a syringe, were found on him.

The man arrested last night shares the same full name of Tupac Amaru Shakur as the late rapper, a fact that wasn't lost on anyone. People on Twitter responded to the odd coincidence just as you might expect.
