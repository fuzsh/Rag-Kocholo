Tupac Shakur is alive and not doing so well after he was arrested in Tennessee.

A white man named Tupac A Shakur, 40, was taken into custody Saturday after allegedly threatening police with a knife.

Johnson City police officers were trying to arrest Shakur on a warrant when he 'attempted to lunge towards [them] with a knife in his hand before being taken to the ground,' authorities said.

Cops said a syringe and multiple baggies of methamphetamine were also found on Shakur.

And though he is heavily tatted, this Shakur does not bear any resemblance to the late rap legend.

They do, however, share the same name - down to the middle initial - though it's not clear if that was Shakur's given name or if he changed it later in life.

The officers were responding to a call Saturday about the 40-year-old Shakur, who had active warrants for his arrest from another department.

When officers arrived at the scene, they reported seeing Shakur leaving in a car. And when they attempted to detain him, they say Shakur lunged at them with a knife.

He was arrested and held at the Washington County Detention Center on $18,000 bond.

He's been charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest, meth possession and unlawful drug paraphernalia.

Shakur is set to appear in Washington County General Sessions Court on Monday.

This arrest adds to the conspiracy that the original Tupac Shakur is actually still alive, and was not gunned down in 1996 in Las Vegas at the age of 25.
