Italian Serie D side ASD Sambenedettese have announced the signing of Ghanaian international Isaac Toah Ntow from Chievo Verona on a one-year loan deal, Kickgh.com can exclusively reveal.

The 22-year-old former Inter Milan youngster is set to continue with his playing career in the Serie D side with the Samb's outfit.

Isaac Ntow was farmed out on loan to Serie B side Calcio Como where he spent the entire 2015-2016 league season, after having two years career stint with Brescia where injury curtailed much of his game time after managing only five appearances with the Biancoazzurri's.

The 22-year-old versatile winger cum midfielder is yet to be capped by Ghana after constantly expressing his avidness in donning the colours of the four-time African champions.
