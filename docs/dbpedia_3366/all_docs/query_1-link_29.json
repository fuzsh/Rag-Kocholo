A Complete Guide to all 64 Italian Football Stadiums\n\n64 Italian Football Stadiums: An All-encompassing Tour of Every Italian Football Stadium\n\nOne would only expect that the land that built the Colosseum as a symbol of entertainment would also have great stadiums and be super passionate about modern-day sports such as football. And they would be absolutely correct!\n\nThe worldwide passion for football is shared by both the Italian players and their fierce supporters.\n\nItaly's Historical Passion for Football\n\nDid you know that forms of football were played in Italy in ancient times? Yes, one of the earliest forms of ball game – called Harpastum - was played during the Roman Empire.\n\nMany believe that this game was significantly influential to other forms of games that developed in this period throughout Europe.\n\nDue to the expansion of the Empire, the game was popularised and influenced the formation of similar ball games, including Medieval football – the predecessor of modern football.\n\nCalcio Fiorentino was one of the early forms of football originated in Italy in the Middle Ages.\n\nAs its popularity increased among the masses, people started to play it in the Piazza Santa Croce in Florence, and the game received the nickname “giuoco del calcio fiorentino” - the \"Florentine kick game\", or simply calcio – \"kick\" was later adopted for football in Italy.\n\nThe modern version of football was brought to Italy in the 1880s, by the merchant worker Edoardo Bosio, who experienced the game during his visit to England.\n\nWhen he returned to Turing in 1887, he decided to help spread football in his homeland.\n\nAs the popularity of the game spread, eventually, the first Italian Football Stadium – San Siro- was built in 1926 in the San Siro District of Milan.\n\nSince then, many more stadiums were built in Italy, and some of the most anticipated stadiums yet to be built are also in Italy.\n\nSo, it is no surprise that Italians love football!\n\nItaly is also one of the most successful nations in football. In World Cups alone, they won four titles in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006, and they appeared in two other finals in 1970 and 1993, gaining third place in 1990.\n\nItaly's club sides have also won 48 major European trophies, which made them the second most successful nation in European football.\n\nTheir top domestic league, the Serie A, is considered one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world, often described as the most tactical national league.\n\nSerie A also famously hosts 3 of the world's most famous clubs: Juventus, Milan and Inter, all of whom are founding members of the G-14 – the group which represented the largest and most prestigious European football clubs.\n\nItalian managers are among the most successful in European Football, and Italy's players, both old and new ones, are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSo, where do these players play and improve their skills?\n\nHow many stadiums are there in Italy, and how do the stadiums of Italy influence Italian football's success?\n\nWe have all the details right here, so let's just dive in!\n\nA List of all 64 Italian Football Stadiums\n\nCurrently, Italy has 64 stadiums with a capacity of 10,000 and more.\n\nThe unique construction, beautiful location and characteristics are the things that make Italian stadiums stand out.\n\nEven the smaller stadiums look amazing- and they are well worth a visit.

However, some would believe that their stadiums have become a bit old-fashioned in recent years.\n\nMany fans, players and even club CEOs claim that they also consider the stadiums to be rather outdated.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, the former AC Milan CEO Gazidis recently claimed:\n\n\"New sustainable infrastructures are the foundations for building the future of football, and in Italy, this is a step that must be taken.\n\nFootball in Italy was at the top of the world 20, and 30 years ago, but it failed to build a foundation for the future.\n\nIt must do so if it is to have a sustainable, solid, and exciting tomorrow. Italian football can do it, the potential it can unlock is incredible.\"\n\nYou may wonder, wait, the CEO of a club can invest in the stadiums, can’t he? The answer is, not really.\n\nThe situation is a bit more complex, as only a handful of Italian clubs own their stadiums. These clubs include Juventus, Sassuolo, Udinese and Atalanta, among others.\n\nOther Serie A club stadiums are owned by the state. Therefore, whenever any changes or restorations are needed, even if the club has prepared funds and projects, the project is rarely accepted, and to be completed it has to go through a lot of bureaucratic procedures.\n\nThis was the case with the AC Milan and Inter Milan football clubs, who play in the famous San Siro stadium.\n\nThe San Siro was renovated in 1990, but it has been over 20-30 years since its last restoration and the stadium still has an overly-high capacity.\n\nWhenever there is a game, fans are seated far away from the pitch which doesn't make the viewing pleasurable. Not to mention the high prices clubs pay for playing in these stadiums.\n\nThat's why AC and Inter Milan requested a new stadium to be built in the place of San Siro.\n\nOriginally, the plan was that some aspects of San Siro remain, like the iconic spiral stairs, and the stadium be partly demolished after the 2026 Winter Olympic games.\n\nNonetheless, the Regional Commission for the cultural heritage of Lombardy in 2022 deemed that the stadium has no 'cultural interest'.\n\nThis gave AC Milan and Inter Milan the green light for demolishing the stadium and beginning with their new plans for a new €1 billion stadium with 60,000 seating capacity that would replace the San Siro stadium.\n\nThis was a long negotiation with a successful proposal and ending for the famous clubs, but not all Italian clubs get this lucky.\n\nMany get their proposals for new stadiums or restoration of old stadiums stuck in endless bureaucratic procedures.\n\nThis results in clubs putting the infrastructure in second place and favouring investment in players instead.\n\nClubs not owning their stadiums but renting them further contributes to a loss in revenue, which hurts their spending power.\n\nCompared to other top leagues in Europe, such as England and Spain, Italy are also falling behind in terms of marketing and TV rights.\n\nAll of these aspects combined can be damaging to the football clubs and their games in the long run."
