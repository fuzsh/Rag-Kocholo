        "text": "ASD Pineto Calcio looking hard to oppose\n\nIt's first placed ASD Pineto Calcio versus 12th placed Sambenedettese in this Serie D clash as the hosts look to add to the 24 points between the sides.\n\nObviously ASD Pineto Calcio start as favourites but there's nothing to get carried away with in the price. It's without much confidence then that they are picked to get the win.\n\nIf their latest results are an indicator of what's to come ASD Pineto Calcio are the side in form. The hosts have notched up 14 wins in their last 17 matches while the travelling side has been defeated in 3 of their last 4 matches, home or away. They're likely to suffer a defeat here too.\n\nThese home players are making the most of a recent run of form and they continue to gel together nicely. ASD Pineto Calcio have scored three or more goals in 6 of their recent 14 matches and they have conceded no more than once in 19 of their last 20 games. They'll be keen to have kept a clean sheet come the full-time whistle.\n\nThe last time these two sides met was in October. ASD Pineto Calcio won with a memorable 3-0 scoreline and they'll be looking for a repeat performance.\n\nMost observers believe that at least one of these sides will keep a clean sheet due to the favouritism for ASD Pineto Calcio. The BTTS No could be the best bet for fans of this market."
