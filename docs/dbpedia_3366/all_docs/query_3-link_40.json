        "text": "Gait and mobility impairments affect the quality of life (QoL) of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) is an effective rehabilitative treatment but evidence of its superiority compared to other options is lacking. Furthermore, the response to rehabilitation is multidimensional, person-specific and possibly involves functional reorganization processes. The aims of this study are: (1) to test the effectiveness on gait speed, mobility, balance, fatigue and QoL of RAGT compared to conventional therapy (CT) in progressive MS and (2) to explore changes of clinical and circulating biomarkers of neural plasticity. This will be a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial design with the assessor blinded to the group allocation of participants. Ninety-eight (49 per arm) progressive MS patients (EDSS scale 6-7) will be randomly assigned to receive twelve 2-h training sessions over a 4-week period (three sessions/week) of either: (1) RAGT inte...\n\nBackground and Objectives: Gait disorders represent one of the most disabling aspects in multiple sclerosis (MS) that strongly influence patient quality of life. The improvement of walking ability is a primary goal for rehabilitation treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) in association with physiotherapy treatment in patients affected by MS in comparison with ground conventional gait training. Study design: Randomized controlled crossover trial. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven participants affected by MS with EDSS scores between 3.5 and 7 were enrolled, of whom seventeen completed the study. They received five training sessions per week over five weeks of conventional gait training with (experimental group) or without (control group) the inclusion of RAGT. The patients were prospectively evaluated before and after the first treatment session and, after the crossover phase, before and after the second treatment se...\n\nBackground. Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve walking capacity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective. This study aimed to evaluate whether RAGT (Lokomat) is superior to over-ground walking training in terms of quality of life, activity level, and gait. Methods. A total of 67 patients with MS with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 3.0 to 6.5 were randomized to walking or RAGT, in addition to multimodal rehabilitation. Primary outcomes were walking speed, activity level (estimated metabolic equivalent, metabolic equivalents [METs], using an accelerometer), and quality of life (Well-Being Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and EQ-5D European VAS. Results. In all, 49 patients finished the interventions. Mean age was 56 years (range 36-74 years), mean EDSS was 5.8 (3.0-6.5), and the preferred walking speed at baseline was 0.56 m/s (0.06-1.43 m/s). Before rehabilitation, participants spent on average 68 min/d at an MET â‰¥3...\n\nThe current study examined the effects of the NewGaitTM device on walking performance in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Eight MS patients participated in this study. Preand post-testing assessed kinematic gait variables (step width, length, and speed), ankle range of motion, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Participants completed an 8week physical therapy (PT) protocol aimed to improve gait and balance, with the experimental group wearing the NewGaitTM device. Repeated measures mixed ANOVA showed no main effects between the gait variables or between groups. Post-hoc paired ttests indicated that the NewGaitTM device elicited meaningful change in left and right step length and speed. The NewGaitTM device may be a promising rehabilitation device to help induce positive walking performance changes in persons with MS.\n\nBalance control relies on accurate perception of visual, somatosensory and vestibular cues. Sensory flow is impaired in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and little is known about the ability of the sensory systems to adapt after neurological lesions reducing sensory impairment. The aims of the present study were to verify whether: 1. Balance rehabilitation administered in a challenging sensory conditions would improve stability in upright posture. 2. The improvement in a treated sensory condition would transfer to a non treated sensory condition. Fifty three persons with MS, median (min-max) EDSS score of 5 (2.5-6.5), participated in a RCT and were randomly assigned to two groups. The Experimental group received balance rehabilitation aimed at improving motor and sensory strategies. The Control group received rehabilitation treatment which did not include training of sensory strategies. Persons with MS were blindly assessed by means of a stabilometric platform with eyes open, eyes closed and..."
