        "text": "Brihat – Samhita\n\nAnother important contribution of Varahamihira is the Brihat-Samhita. It covers wide ranging subjects of human interest, including astrology, planetary movements, eclipses, rainfall, clouds, architecture, growth of crops, manufacture of perfume, matrimony, domestic relations, gems, pearls, and rituals. The volume expounds on gemstone evaluation criterion found in the Garuda Purana, and elaborates on the sacred Nine Pearls from the same text. It contains 106 chapters and is known as the “great compilation”.\n\nOn Astrology\n\nHe was also an astrologer. He wrote on all the three main branches of Jyotisha astrology:\n\nBrihat Jataka – is considered as one of the five main treatises on Hindu astrology on horoscopy.\n\nLaghu Jataka – also known as ‘Swalpa Jataka’\n\nSamasa Samhita – also known as ‘Lagu Samhita’ or ‘Swalpa Samhita’\n\nBrihat Yogayatra – also known as ‘Mahayatra’ or ‘Yakshaswamedhiya yatra’\n\nYoga Yatra – also known as ‘Swalpa yatra’\n\nTikkani Yatra\n\nBrihat Vivaha Patal\n\nLagu Vivaha Patal – also known as ‘Swalpa Vivaha Patal’\n\nLagna Varahi\n\nKutuhala Manjari\n\nDaivajna Vallabha (apocryphal)\n\nHis son Prithuyasas also contributed in the Hindu astrology; his book Hora Sara is a famous book on horoscopy. Khana (also named Lilavati elsewhere) the medieval Bengali poetess astrologer is believed to be the daughter-in-law of Varahamihir.\n\nInfluences\n\nThe Romaka Siddhanta (“Doctrine of the Romans”) and the Paulisa Siddjanta (“Doctrine of Paul”) were two works of Western origin which influenced Varahamihira’s thought, though this view is controversial as there is much evidence to suggest that it was actually Vedic thought indigenous to India which first influenced Western astrologers and subsequently came back to India reformulated. Number of his writings share similarities with with the earlier texts like Vedanga Jyotisha .\n\nA comment in the Brihat-Samhita by Varahamihira says: “The Greeks, though Barbarians, must be honored since they have shown tremendous interest in our science…..” (“mleccha hi yavanah tesu samyak shastram kdamsthitam/ rsivat te ‘p i pujyante kim punar daivavid dvijah” (Brihat-Samhita 2.15)).\n\nto be continues…………."
