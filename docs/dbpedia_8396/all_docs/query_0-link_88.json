        "text": "Varahamihir (Varasmihir) was the fifth and sixth century Indian mathematician and astronomer of Jesus. Varahamihir was the first in his Panchasiddhantika to say that the value of income is equal to 50.32 secs.\n\nThe Gurukul of mathematical science developed by him in Kapithak (Ujjain) was unique for seven hundred years. Varahmihira was very intelligent and glorious since childhood. After doing extensive research work in these areas by learning traditional mathematics and astrology from his father Adityadas. Establishment of the Observatory at the place called Jundishapur at the time-measurement machine, the construction of the iron pillar in Indraprastha and on the invitation of the King Shaharshah Nosherwan of Iran - give a glimpse of his work. Verma: The main purpose of Mihir was to connect mathematics and science to the public. In fact, India has been a tradition since Rigveda. Verma has done its full compliance.\n\nBiography\n\nVarahamihira was born in 4 99 in a Brahmin family. The family was a resident of village Kapith (Kayitha) near Ujjain. His father Aditya Das was a devotee of Lord Surya. They taught Mihir astrology. On reaching Kusumpur (Patna), young Mihir met a great astronomer and mathematician Aryabhatta. This gave him so much inspiration that he made astrology and astronomical knowledge the only goal of his life. At that time Ujjain was the center of learning. Under the Gupta regime, many centers of art, science and culture were flourishing there. Mihir came to live in this city because the scholars of other places were also gathered here. When the time came, he knew the knowledge of his astrology, Vikramaditya Chandragupta II. The king added them to the navratanas of his court. Mihir traveled to distant countries, even to Greece. Varahamihir died in 587. Works\n\nAbout 550 AD, he wrote three important books - Brihajjatak, Brihat Sanghita and Panchasiddhanta, These books have given important formulas of trigonometry, which are the representations of the Trigonometry of Varahmihiri.\n\nPanchasiddhantika describes the five pre-existing principles of Varahamihira. These principles are: theories of theology, theology of romance, the doctrines of Siddhasiddhanta, and the paternal mythology. Varahamihira has also written the important things of these prevalent principles, and has also directed 'rituals' to be sung on its behalf, thereby allowing planetary views to be computed by these principles. He has written three books namely, astrologer, astrologer, and bhruttjhita, astrology. The greater theories include Vaastu Vidyavidya, Building-Arts, Nature of Atmosphere, Tree Ayurveda etc ..\n\nAbout his book, Varahmihir says: Astrology is a deep ocean and not everyone can easily cross it. My book is a safe boat, which will read it, will carry it across.\n\nIt was not blown blank. This book is still considered as Granthathan. List of creations Scientific thoughts and contributions\n\nBarahmihir was the knower of the Vedas but he did not believe in cluttering blindness in the supernatural. His feelings and attitudes were of a scientist. Like his predecessor Aryabhata, he also said that the earth is round. He was the first person in the history of science, who said that there is such a power which keeps things in the possession of the ground. Today, this power is called gravity. But he also made a big mistake. They believed that the earth is not moving. If it was moving, then the birds would move towards the opposite direction of the motion of the earth (west side) at the same time.\n\nVarahamihira made some important comments regarding environmental science (ecology), hydrology (hydrology), geology (jiology). They say that plants and termites point to the water under the ground. Today, the scientific world is being taken into account. He wrote too much too. Due to his skill in Sanskrit grammar and his authority on verses, he expressed himself in a unique style. Due to his eloquent knowledge and gravity presentation, he has made the arid subjects such as Astro interesting, which gave him a lot of fame. His book Panchasiddhanthika (Five Principles), Jupiter Sanhita, Brajrajatak (astrology) has given him the same place in the result of astrology, which is the Kautilya of the political philosophy, the Panini in grammar and the Manu in the legislation. Trigonometry\n\nThe following trigonometric formula has been expressed by Varahmihir -. without 2 & # x2061; x + cos 2 & # x2061; x = 1 {\\displaystyle \\sin ^{2}x+\\cos ^{2}x=1\\;\\!} without & # x2061; x = cos & # x2061; ( & # x03C0; 2 & # x2212; x ) {\\displaystyle \\sin x=\\cos \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{2}}-x\\right)} 1 & # x2212; cos & # x2061; 2 x 2 = without 2 & # x2061; x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1-\\cos 2x}{2}}=\\sin ^{2}x}\n\nVarahamihira made the table more precision that was formulated by Aryabhata first. Arithmetic\n\nVarahamihira defined the algebraic properties of zero and negative numbers. Number theory\n\nVarahamihira is also the author of a mathematical text called 'number theory', which is very less known. There is no complete information about this text because only a small fraction of it has been found. Archaeological evidence about the received text is that it includes advanced arithmetic, trigonometry as well as some relatively simple concepts. Permutation\n\nVarahamihir discovered the famous numbers under the name Pascal's triangle in the present time. They used to calculate binomial coefficients. Optics\n\nVarahamihira also contributes to optics. He said that reflection takes place from back-scattering of particles. They have also interpreted refraction.\n\n1. ^ \"the Pañca-siddhāntikā (\"Five Treatises\"), a compendium of Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Indian astronomy. Varāhamihira's knowledge of Western astronomy was thorough. In 5 sections, his monumental work progresses through native Indian astronomy and culminates in 2 treatises on Western astronomy, showing calculations based on Greek and Alexandrian reckoning and even giving complete Ptolemaic mathematical charts and tables.
