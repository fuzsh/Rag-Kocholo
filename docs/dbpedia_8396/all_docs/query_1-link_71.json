Ancient to modern Indian mathematicians made immortal contributions to mathematics. They introduced concepts like the decimal system, zero, negative numbers, arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and much more. These are documented in the Sanskrit sutras that outline the different rules and problems related to mathematics.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the famous Indian Mathematicians and Their Contributions in detail.\n\nLet us discuss.\n\nIndian Mathematicians and their Contributions – Overview\n\nIndian mathematicians have made so many significant contributions to the field of mathematics throughout history. They made so many classic contributions that spanned a diverse area. Their mathematical prowess left a long-lasting impact on the global mathematical landscape. Here is the detailed overview of those famous Indian mathematicians and Their Notable Contributions as mentioned below.\n\nIndian Mathematicians and their Contributions – Overview\n\nMathematician Name\n\nContributions\n\nTop 7 Great Indian Mathematicians and Their Contributions\n\n400 CE to 1500 CE was the golden age of Indian Mathematics. This period is also known as the Classic Period of Indian Mathematics. Now we are going to discuss about the top 7 great Indian Mathematicians and Their Contributions in detail as mentioned below.\n\n1. Aryabhata\n\nAryabhata was born in Kusumapura of ancient India.\n\nHe was the first mathematician who is considered as the first astronomer also of ancient India.\n\nAryabhata used the decimal number system to solve square and cube roots.\n\nHe evaluated an accurate value of pi up to 4 decimal places.\n\nAryabhata calculated and proved that a year comprises with 365 days.\n\nHe discovered the spherical shape of Earth and its rotation on its axis.\n\nAryabhata calculated Earth’s circumference which was 99.8 percent accurate.\n\nAryabhata’s contributions we can find across trigonometry, geometry, astronomy, and more.\n\n2. Varahamihira\n\nHe was born in ancient Ujjain in the 6th century CE in India.\n\nHe was the first mathematician who discovered a version of Pascal’s triangle.\n\nHe also evaluated the binomial coefficients.\n\nHe enhanced the accuracy of Aryabhata’s sine tables in later times.\n\nVarahamihira invented the 4×4 magic square.\n\nPanchasiddhantika and Brihat Samhita are some notable mathematical scripts of Varahamihira.\n\n3. Brahmagupta\n\nBrahmagupta was born in Ujjain.\n\nHe introduced zero in the world of mathematics. It was a brilliant concept where he defined Mathematics as “nothing” without zero.\n\nHe was the first mathematician to provide a mathematical formula for the Cyclic Quadrilateral.\n\nBrahmasphutasiddhanta was the earliest text to acknowledge zero as a numerical entity which was written by him.\n\n4. Srinivasa Ramanujan\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan was born in Tamil Nadu whose theories and concepts change the idea of mathematics during the early 20th century.\n\nHe earned the nickname “The man who knew Infinity.”\n\nRamanujan sent 120 Theorems to Professor Hardy of Cambridge University. For this he got an invitation to work there.\n\nThe number 1729 is now also known as the Hardy–Ramanujan number jointly.\n\n5. P.C.Mahalanobis\n\nMahalanobis improved the process of statistical surveys. He introduced the concept of pilot and large-scale surveys.\n\nRecognized as the “Father of Indian Statistics”.\n\nHe founded the Indian Statistical Institute of India.\n\nHe served as a member of India’s inaugural Planning Commission.\n\n6. Satyendra Nath Bose\n\nSN Bose laid the foundation for theoretical physics in India.\n\nHe made so many significant contributions to quantum mechanics.\n\nHe particularly established the groundwork for Bose-Einstein statistics.\n\nHe discovered the Bose-Einstein condensate, the concept of bosons, development of Single field theory, research on the diffraction of X-rays, and exploration of electromagnetic waves.\n\n7. Shakuntala Devi\n\nShe was born in Bengaluru, Karnataka who was famous as the “Human Computer” for her extraordinary mental calculating abilities.\n\nShe honored with a place in The Guinness Book of World Records in its 1982 edition.\n\nList of Famous Female Mathematicians of India\n\nHere are the list of female Mathematicians of India as mentioned below.\n\nRaman Parimala\n\nNeena Gupta\n\nShakuntala Devi\n\nSujhata Ramdorai\n\nMangala Narlikar\n\nVanaja Iyengar\n\nRenuka Ravindra\n\nAjit Iqbal Singh\n\nT.
