        "text": "Aryabhatta, also known as the father of Indian Mathematics, was a renowned astronomer and mathematician of the ancient times of India. Aryabhatta contributed significant work in science and mathematics and concluded theories of earth rotation on its axis, approximation of pie (π) place value system of zero, trigonometry, and many others.\n\nOne of his famous works is Aryabhatiya, a magnum opus written in the Sanskrit language and the only known surviving work of Indian mathematician Aryabhata from the fifth century. His work includes the Arya-Siddhanta, a lost treatise on astronomical calculations, Varahamihira, Bhaskara, and Brahmagupta. The discoveries made by the Aryabhatta were impactful. Aryabhatta gained worldwide recognition as a legendary mathematician.\n\nLet us look at the detailed life of Aryabhatta, his contribution to Mathematics and Astronomy, and his background, qualification, and legacy.\n\nAryabhatta Place of Birth and Education\n\nAryabhatta was born in Pataliputra, which in present times is in Patna, Bihar state, in the year 476. It is believed that he completed his studies in Kusumapura. Aryabhata was the head of a Kusumapura institution (kulapa). Aryabhata was also the head of the Nalanda University, Bihar, because the university was located near Patliputra and housed an astronomical observatory.\n\nContribution of Aryabhatta to Mathematics\n\nAryabhatta made several contributions to Mathematics inventions and theories. Due to his significant contribution and achievement in mathematics, he is also called The King of Indian Mathematics. Some of the important discoveries he made in the mathematics field are:\n\nThe place value system and zero\n\nTrigonometry\n\nAlgebra\n\nApproximation of pi π\n\nIndeterminate equations\n\nContribution of Aryabhatta to Astronomy\n\nBesides mathematics, Aryabhatta also made several impactful discoveries and inventions in astronomy. Aryabhata’s astronomical system was known as the audAyaka system. Scientists made several discoveries based on his discoveries such as that planets and moon in the solar system are lightened by sunlight only. He gave the theory that Earth rotates on its axis only. Some of the Aryabhatta’s significant contribution to Astronomy includes:\n\nSolar system motion\n\nSidereal periods\n\nEclipses\n\nHeliocentrism\n\nAryabhatta also wrote several books about his discovery and piece of work in mathematics and astronomy. Many of his books were lost and never discovered. Some of the well-known books written by Aryabhatta are:\n\nAryabhatiya\n\nRishab’s Good Theory of Indian\n\nDash Geetika\n\nArya Siddhanta\n\nAryabhatta Legacy\n\nAryabhatta died in 550 CE in Patliputra only. The contributions made by Aryabhatta are still used in today’s times. Go through Aryabhatta’s work that is still practised.\n\nAryabhata’s astronomical calculating methods are used in the Islamic world to calculate dates for calendars.\n\nTrigonometric tables are used to compute numerous Arabic astronomy tables.\n\nAryabhatta’s definitions of cosine, sine, versine and inverse sine impacted the development of trigonometry mathematics. Moreover, he was also the first to give sine and versine (1 cos x) tables in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, with 4 decimal places of precision.\n\nThe contemporary terms ‘sine’ and ‘cosine’ are mistranslations of Aryabhata’s phrases jy and koji.\n\nHonours are given to Aryabhatta, the Father of Mathematics\n\nThe well-known mathematician of ancient India, Aryabhatta, has received several honours from the government of India. Today, many ventures, schools, universities, and satellites are named after the great scientist and mathematician, Aryabhatta. Go through the details about the Aryabhatta honours given below.\n\nTo honour such great Indian mathematicians, the Bihar Government created Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) in Patna to develop and manage educational infrastructure linked to leadership, medical, technical, and associated professional education. Bihar State University Act of 2008 governs the AKU university. Moreover, the government of India names India’s first satellite (Aryabhata and the lunar crater Aryabhata) after Aryabhatta to embrace his contribution to astronomy and mathematics.\n\nThe Aryabhata satellite appears on the backside of the Indian two-rupee note.\n\nConclusion\n\nAryabhatta’s contributions to mathematics and astronomy were phenomenal and influential. The discoveries and inventions made by the Aryabhatta turned out to be helpful in the science and mathematics fields. Aryabhatta’s contributions to mathematics like trigonometry, pi, place value system, etc. solve significant problems and are still practised and taught in schools and colleges. His contribution to astronomy brought major changes in the scientific sector, which led scientists and astronauts to achieve new milestones in astronomy."
