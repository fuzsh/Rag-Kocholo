Varahamihira, an ancient Indian sage from Ujjain, wrote a book 1500 years ago containing insights about space and the universe that have amazed modern scientists.

He was a highly esteemed astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer, surpassing the popularity of his contemporaries Aryabhata and Brahmagupta.

Varahamihira’s notable works include the “Pancha Siddhantika,” which summarizes earlier astronomical treatises, and the comprehensive “Brihat-Samhita,” covering diverse topics like astrology, planetary movements, and natural phenomena.

He made significant contributions to mathematics, discovering trigonometric formulas, improving sine tables, and defining the properties of zero and negative numbers.

He also made remarkable observations in ecology, hydrology, and geology, accurately predicting underground water and deriving the true value of equinox. Additionally, he described Mars in detail, mentioning the presence of water and iron on its surface, a fact later confirmed by NASA and ISRO.
