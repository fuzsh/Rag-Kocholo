Jill Ker Conway, the first women president of Smith College, author of The Road from Coorain, will discuss growing up in Australia and facing cultural expectations there; Elaine Orr, author of Gods of Noonday, is a white Nigerian. She will talk about growing up during the Biafran War and also dealing with a kidney transplant; Nancy McCabe, author of Meeting Sophie and Crossing the Blue Willow Bridge: A Journey to My Daughter’s Birthplace in China will speak about adopting a daughter from China and returning to that country with her daughter; Beth Taylor, author of The Plain Language of Love and Loss, will discuss the effects of the Vietnam War on her family, the suicide of her 14-year-old brother in the midst of the war culture, and the influence of growing up Quaker.\n\nThe Rhode Island Council of the Humanities, the URI Women’s Studies Program, the College of Arts & Sciences, the College of Human Science and Services, the Honors Program, and the Departments of Anthropology/Sociology, Communication Studies, History, and Psychology sponsor the series.
