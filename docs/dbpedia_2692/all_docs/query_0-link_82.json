        "text": "Points of Departure\n\nfrom Inventing the TruthThe motivations for writing The Road from Coorain were very complex. I'll start with the most frivolous and proceed to the most profound.\n\nThe most frivolous one was that after about the five-hundredth time some American or Canadian told me how much they loved the movie Crocodile Dundee I couldn't stand it any more, because that film is the most vulgar projection of an Australian male myth, packaged deliberately to appeal to American stereotypes. It has almost nothing to do with what life in the Australian outback is like. I grew up as a child with all those rootless, itinerant males, whose lives were mostly tragic and whose inability to connect to other people made them not the type of heroic natural man that Crocodile Dundee is presented as, but very pathetic figures. I was also tired to death of the obsessive re-creation of the male myth that we see traditionally in Australian movies, whether it's Breaker Morant or Gallipoli or The Man from Snowy River--all of them about unattached males. Women are presented as a good lay on the way to the war, or something like that; they have no real existence. So I wanted to write a story about the Australian outback that has a female heroine--my mother--and a female narrative voice.\n\nThe second motivation is more complex. I used to write a great deal when I was young, before I got a Ph.D. As an undergraduate in Australia I loved to write. I published a number of books and articles, including a book for children. Later, at Harvard, working on my doctorate made me have difficulty writing. As an academic you internalize the critical voice of your supervisor and your fellow students and you lose access to spontaneous narrative. You begin to write for other historians and less and less from your own experience. Then I became a university administrator, first as vice president of the University of Toronto and then as president of Smith College. In that kind of position you write endless reams of memoranda to the board of trustees and goodness knows what other official-dom, and in all your communications there's always the legal department looking over your shoulder and fussing about language. You begin to write like a bureaucrat.\n\nWhen I took the job at Smith I promised myself that I would only be a college president for ten years, because then I would be fifty and it would be time to get back to the writing I wanted to do. In the course of being a college president I started talking to other audiences--to alumni, or corporation executives, or testifying before congres-sional committees--so the range of people I was talking to and the audience I thought about became much broader. Still, when I sat down to write again after I left Smith, I just couldn't get away from that wretched bureaucratic prose. Once you've got the voice of authority and caution, it's very hard to get away from it. So I thought, \"I'm going to have to write something that's really close to the bone and see if I can rediscover my own style.\"\n\nThe other motivations were much larger and ongoing in my life. I was interested in seeing if I could come up with a life plot that wasn't a romance, because the archetypal life plot for women in Western society is the bourgeois romance. It's about family and erotic life, and it doesn't concern itself at all with motivations that I think are very important for women, like work and intellectual life and political commitrnents. But I didn't want to write an odyssey--to just take over the archetypal male plot and create a conquering heroine. I was looking for a way to narrate a life story of a woman that would pay due respect to her attachments to men and to family but would be about something else entirely. I wanted to convey my sense of my education, of my liberation through access to education, and of the variety of steps by which I arrived at taking charge of my own life. Philosophically, you only have to perform one free act to be a free person. Granting all the ways in which we're shaped by society, nevertheless one free choice changes the outcome.\n\nSo I deliberately ended the The Road from Coorain with my departure from Australia, because that leaves the end totally open. Afterward people kept writing to me and saying, \"I want to know what happened next.\" I could have ended the book two years later in the United States, when I married the man to whom I've been married for thirty-three years, and then everybody would have said, \"Oh, so that's how it ended!\" But it's very deliberately not a romance, and it's not an odyssey. I think of it as a quest narrative. That's appropriate for any life stage, because the modern consciousness, which separates some private es-sence that we think we have from the roles we play, leaves a thoughtful person with a quest to put all those lives together and see what they have added up to.\n\nI also wanted--another motivation--to tell the story of my separation from my family, because when I became president of Smith and had of fice hours every Monday, at which anybody could come in and see me--the grounds-keeper or someone complaining that the basketball coach only played her two minutes last week--I found that the most recurring visits were from juniors and seniors who were overwhelmed by a sense of obligation to their families. They didn't feel entitled to a private destiny, and they were terribly conflicted about their sense of their true vocation and their duty to their family. Of course young men also have those feelings, but they have access to far more narratives about how one overcomes those crippling obligations. So I thought: Since this seems to be a univer-sal problem and is unchanged for all ten generations of students I talked to at Smith, it's probably a very important theme.\n\nTraditionally there has only been one female autobiography for every eight written by a male. And the romantic plot has so dominated the way women write their narra-tives that, to the extent that these women's books exist at all, they obscure how the woman chose to make her life. Jane Addams, my great heroine, who spent nine years founding Hull House, the great serclement house in Chicago, says in her autobiography that it would be hard to say when the idea of founding Hull House came into her mind, but it was probably when she was taken--just as a passive passenger--by a philanthropic worker to see the poor scrambling for food in the East End of London. I know from reading her diaries and letters that she bugged that woman to take her to the East End of London; she made it happen. But she never assumes responsibility.\n\nOnce I picked up that theme in her language I began to pay attention to it in other life narratives of women. By contrast, among males the sense of being the agent of one's destiny is much stronger, often to a comical level. Somebody like Lee Iacocca seems to believe that he per-sonally rescued the Chrysler Corporation. The government's bailout had nothing to do with it; the rescue came about through his agency. In writing The Road from Coorain I thought it was important to relate the story of a young woman taking charge of her life in an unromantic way, in which it's perfectly clear that she arrives at a moment of choice. Telling that story seems to have fulfilled a big need for readers of the book.\n\nStill another motivation that's very complex, but very important to me, is that we need a more inclusive rhetoric for feminism today. The different wings of the movement have become so politicized over issues like abortion and pornography, or over competing versions of feminist the ory or literary criticism or social analysis, that feminists have become almost like the historians of my era as an academic. They're writing for a very small audience about very fine points. That rhetoric doesn't speak emotionally to a larger audience. Feminism can never succeed as a majority movement unless it can persuade a lot of men to become feminists. It can never succeed if it continues to proclaim the separate female utopia that's part of so much female-written science fiction today. We have to live in the world with men, and we have to convince them that it's morally right and just to treat women as equals. We need a rhetoric that also speaks to men. In retrospect, I suppose it was good training for me to talk to all those congressional committees when I was a college president.\n\nFinally, I'm very much opposed to the current senti-mental school of female psychology, which argues that women never separate from their families of birth because they bond with their same-sex parent and never develop boundaries that separate them from the primal mother. Proponents of this school of thought argue that women are always lodged in networks of female relationships and are therefore morally better than men, who possess an isolated, individualized psyche. I think that's wrong for a great variety of reasons. Our culture encourages men to talk about separating and encourages women to suppress the experience. I see men lodged in networks of support-ing relationships everywhere I go. They don't come home and say, \"I never could have gotten through the day at the office without Tom or Bill,\" but in fact they have many ways in which they display affection or support for each other--a hug or a pat on the shoulder. Women don't get to watch them doing that, so they're not aware of it.\n\nSo I wanted to write a story about separation--as honest an account as I could give of that process. My new memoir, True North, pursues that motif of separation. It's my personal testament in opposition to the sentimental school of thought about women. The view of women as always lodged in family networks is very attractive to the political right because it provides a good reason for keep-ing women from establishing a strong independent identity of their own. It also suggests that they won't form political bonds or aspire to life in the so-called \"public sphere.\"\n\nBoth my brother and I have extraordinarily vivid visual memories. When we try to remember an event or an oc-casion, we start with where the chairs were in the room and what time of day it was and what the background noises were, and we re-create it. As a grader of papers I'm death on plagiarists because I can see the page where I once read that text. I have the artist's ability to see some-thing, but I have no ability to translate it into a repre-sentation except through words. I've also been helped in determining the shape of my narrative by the larger social concerns that I've just described. And as a college admin-istrator I have been studied at different stages of my career by psychologists who want to understand women leaders who are unusual in their generation--what experiences made me an activist and a leader. I can't tell you how many questionnaires I've filled out. Doing that naturally makes you reflect about what were important experiences in your life.\n\nThat in turn raises the question, when you actually write your memoir, of what to put in and what to leave out. As I said, I knew I had to get back to the personal style I had as a girl--that only exploring deeply-felt inner experience was going to do it for me. The danger is that in telling your life story you'll hurt some people's feelings. I couldn't have written The Road from Coorain while my mother was living. She would have struck me dead--not literally, but.... As far as others were concerned, except where I concealed someone's identity I showed my manuscript to the people I was writing about and let them say whether it was appropriate or not, or whether they minded. I've done the same thing with True North; I sent the pertinent pages to everybody in the book. I think it's an invasion of privacy not to. If you're going to see yourself in print you deserve a chance to correct anything that may be wrong.\n\nObviously the person who would be most concerned in The Road from Coorain was my brother. I sent him the first four chapters and said, \"I won't publish this if you find it too painful.\" He called me up at four o'clock in the morn-ing, because he had just finished reading it in Australia, and he said, \"It's wonderful. Keep going. I had forgotten so much.\" The places of childhood are always etched on the memory with great power and clarity. I had been thinking about The Road from Coorain for a long time; it was already written in my head. (Expatriates always think about their life up to the point of departure.) It also helped that as an undergraduate in Australia I had been interested sad, that I wanted not to shortchange her in any way. Today people ask me how I learned to manage my time so efficiently. I learned it by observing my mother when I was young. Although she had three children, she taught us school, eventually did all the cooking and cleaning at the sheep station, had a huge garden that fed us and many other people, and still had four hours a day free to read. She just never wasted a second. So as a child I had as a mother this wonderful, competent, loving, nurturing woman who was a tower of strength and creativity. Nothing fazed her; she was courageous to an extreme degree.\n\nBut first she lost my father and then she lost her eldest son, both in tragic accidents--in my father's case, a possible suicide. The loss of those paired male figures took root in her psyche, and as an older woman she became terribly dependent on her two remaining children and also on alcohol and tranquilizers, which, over an extended period, begin to affect the brain. She became subject to all kinds of paranoid delusions and turned into a punishing, angry, negative, and destructive person. The dramatic tension for me as a writer involved portraying this strong woman as seen through the eyes of the child who finally has to separate from her or lose her own life.\n\nAn outsider might put much of the blame for her tragic life on the hostile environment of the sheep station. But I didn't want to write that story, which is the Australian archetype. It comes out of the British colonial experience, which represents life in Australia as a battle with harsh elements. Of course that's a British imperial perspective; aboriginals don't experience Australia that way. It's a very bountiful land if you know how to live in it, and very beau-tiful. So I tried hard to evoke its beauty and the sense of the plenitude of nature when the seasons smile. True, the continent has these recurring periods of intense drought, but the natural vegetation is perfectly adapted to that. What created the disaster in my family history was not the land and the environment, but the introduction by white settlers of sharp-hoofed animals, which destroy and de-grade the environment.\n\nSo the land is meant to be a character in The Road from Coorain, and it continues to be a character in Trlle North, which is about my coming to North America. Today I work at M.I.T. in the Program on Science, Technology and Society, where a group of us are studying ways in which the humanities can contribute to an awareness and a thoughtful understanding of environmental issues. Much environmental thought nowadays is semifascist and authoritarian, going back to the fascist idea of people being rooted in blood in the soil and needing to relate in a very possessive way to a specific natural environment. A great deal of environmental writing has this cast, particularly in Russia; the myth of Mother Russia has always been a source of authoritarian political ideas. Ecofeminism is also raising a supposed female myth involving female-ruled prehistorical societies in which nature was the object of worship and which also--from what records we have--were highly authoritarian.\n\nI'm interested in how one can look at the narrative treatment of nature to analyze and understand the politi-cal assumptions behind it. E. M. Forster's A Passage to I'ndia, for instance, has a totally imperialist view of the Indian landscape--the Malabar caves. From reading the book you'd never know what the Indian history of those caves was, or what the Indian culture was. You can read American narratives about wildfires, which take those fires to be some terrible wickedness or catastrophe in nature, whereas burning is how many natural woods replenish themselves. So in my writing I try to make the natural environment a character--an instructive one, but not a sentimental one. In our work at M.I.T. I think it's important for us to understand how these arid, very delicate environments like Australia are misrepresented in European-style art and literature; almost every European as-sumption about climate and nature is wrong. But I'm not someone who wants to preserve unspoiled nature. It doesn't exist. Nature is a cultural construct, and we have to understand that it's a category that we must be critical of, just as we would be critical in analyzing any other category of thought. I'm not eager to return us to the wooden plow or Stone Age culture. Technology is a creation of the hu-man intellect that we need to manage and understand.\n\nWhen I first set out to write my memoir about growing up in Australia, I found that my memory was of all the painful things. But in the process of telling that story I rediscovered so much that was beautiful about my childhood. My brother had the same experience; he said my book reminded him of happy experiences that had been overwhelmed by later tragedy. Often there is a human tendency to obliterate happiness--to live in one's painful memories. But for me, going through my life gave me back the good things I had forgotten, and I've captured them for good. It gave me back my happy mother.\n\nThe book has also been helpful to other people. I can tell from my mail that it strikes a universal theme for women readers of all ages. It resonates for them because it's the story of a woman who takes charge of her life. I've also had an extensive correspondence with male readers of all ages. Many of them are the sons of single mothers, and they felt the same overwhelming sense of obligation to an all-provident female figure that I felt in relation to my mother. That correspondence has alerted me to a developmental concern for males that I hadn't been aware of. The mother-daughter relationship is traditionally sentimentalized but it's a trap, for sons as well as daughters--a trap because few people think honestly about the dimen-sions of misused maternal power. But the older men who write to me say that dealing honestly with exploitation by mothers is not an exclusively female problem. I've also had a great many letters from expatriates--the book made them feel at peace with having left--and many letters from Latin American readers, especially in the Argentine and Brazil. The way of life in the Australian out-back is comparable to life on the pampas.\n\nAll of us live with a life history in our mind, and very few of us subject it to critical analysis. But we are storytelling creatures. So it's very important to examine your own story and make sure that the plot is the one you really want. When I give talks as a historian about the domi-nance of the romantic plot in women's telling of their life histories, I'm amused to see women investment bankers and corporate lawyers giving a wry smile, as if to say, \"It's true--that's how I do see my life.\" As a young person it's important to scrutinize the plot you've internalized and find out whether it accurately represents what you want to be, because ue tend to act out those life plots unless we think about them. I'm impatient with the postmodern effort to obfuscate the validity of narrative. We are time-bound creatures. We experience life along a time continuum; things happen sequentially in our lives, and we need to understand the causation. But we never really do un-derstand it until we sit down and try to tell the story.\n\nSo I would say to young people: First, if you approach writing about your life honestly, you'll find a style of writing that you will never otherwise discover. And second, that process can take parents or other figures who seem larger than life and reduce them to people in your story. I recently visited an experimental inner-city elementary school in a slum area of Miami that had been devastated by the hurricane. I was struck by the fact that children eight or nine or ten years old, who had been having difficulty with English, were being asked to tell their story as though it was a television series. Some of their stories were so lively and so funny that the children were laughing, although the events themselves were quite grim. And I thought, what a genius that teacher was, because television is a genre they all know about, and they were telling stories about their families in a way that must have been wonderfully helpful to them.\n\nUntil you put people in your narrative you haven't quite got them under control. The standard postmodern critique of narrative says that the narrator imposes by his or her own authority a certain meaning on the ebb and flow of events: that you change the story by where you begin it and end it, and that you impose your own meaning on events that's different from the meaning everybody else in the story puts on those events. In fact, Westerners have created a whole concept of the Asian or the African by the way we have told the history of their continents.\n\nSo there are many good things about the postmodern insistence that there is no meta-narrative. There is no fixed history, no history that is true. There are stories that we tell from our history, and we tell them well or we tell them ill. If you want to tell the history of the world in I492, we Westerners talk about Columbus, but if you're from the Arab world a very different series of events is important. In the West we have written our history as if the West were the center of the world and the events that happened elsewhere are peripheral. Still, there's no reason not to try to be more inclusive. In the case of The Road from Coorain, it's my story, and anybody who reads it may deconstruct it any way they like. It's also quite conceivable that if I were to write about my childhood as an old woman in my eighties I would tell it differently. What matters is how I thought about it at the time I wrote it.\n\nThe young women I got to know when I was at Smith were energetically interested in writing and understand-ing themselves and their current life experiences. Their problem was that most of the narratives they saw, which were on television, were structured around very brief twor three-minute incidents. These women had never become accustomed to writing reflective expository prose--looking at an event and reflecting on what it means--because events on television are so neatly packaged that you don't think about the alternatives. One of my motives for writing True North now, rather than ten years from now, say, is that many memoirs have recently been written by women of my generation in the feminist movement who talk about how exhausting their experience of the movement was. That wasn't my experience at all. My life has been enlarged and enriched and strengthened by the feminist struggle, and I have been the gainer in every respect. Much of the current writing in women's studies stresses the problems of bias that women experience. If I were a girl in college today, reading all this stuff would be a real downer. For me, fighting bias has been energizing, and on the whole I've enjoyed it. Getting in a good honest rage about injustice isn't bad for you.\n\nI was also prompted to write True North, which is about my life in North America, by the reaction of Australians to The Road from Coorain. They think much more about expatriation than other readers do. But I've come to believe that the notion of expatriation is a nineteenth-century creation. It comes out of the obsession of the male citizens with the national soil and territory. Historically, nobody ever bothered about women being required to change countries; they were meant to be able to shift allegiance overnight through marriage. It's been interesting for me as a set of political reflections to think about what it means to move to another country and another culture and another climate and another continent. The theme of True North is my experience of intellectual life in North America and finding a life partner who is my emotional and moral compass point. It's about exploring the Northern Hemisphere. The book ends in I975, when I'm driving out of Toronto and around Lake Ontario to cross the border and go to Smith. Some readers have asked why I also didn't include my experiences as president of Smith in the book. I think you have to be at least twenty years away from what you write about to have the necessary detachment. Many mem-oirs or autobiographies get very cluttered in their later chapters because people don't know what was really involved. It takes more time to know what the shape of your life has been like."
