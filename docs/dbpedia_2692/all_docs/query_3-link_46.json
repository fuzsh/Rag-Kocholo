        "text": "They will scatter Jill Ker Conway's ashes next week across the semi-arid plains of far western NSW. It's country where the odd oasis-like clump of trees surrounds billabongs, but much of it is bare and harsh.\n\nIt's fitting, however, that such an unforgiving landscape will be her final resting place. This is not just because far western NSW was the early home of one of the most remarkable women in Australia's history, but because it is an area that imbued Jill Ker Conway with the strength and willpower to become a leading international academic, university administrator, historian, company board director, author, feminist, philanthropist, dinner-time conversationalist and gardener."
