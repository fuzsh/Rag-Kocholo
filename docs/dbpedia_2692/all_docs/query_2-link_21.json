        "text": "JILL KER CONWAY was Australian, was raised with a sense of manners, and once said, “You can’t escape your past. Until the day I die, I’m going to look like a nice English lady going to take tea with the vicar.”\n\nBut behind her proper façade lay the mind and heart of a blue-collar farm woman — and a revolutionary. She spent her early years on a windy, desolate sheep ranch in New South Wales. There was always hard work to do, and the vastness and desolation made all human ambition seem foolish.\n\nShe went to no formal school; she took correspondence courses. She learned on the ranch to speak plainly, work hard, and believe in herself, and in a quiet way she excelled.\n\nBut it was a painful childhood, too. Both her father and brother died young, and her mother chastised Jill for crying when her father drowned. Mother and daughter were never close, Jill finding her mother narrow and sometimes cruel, her mother fretting that Jill cared far too much for book learning and too little for social convention.\n\nJill was only 10 at the death of her beloved father, William Ker. She would always remember him telling her: “Do something, Jill. Don’t just put in time on this earth.”\n\nAfter William’s drowning death, the family moved to Sydney, where Jill enrolled in much better schools. At that time, girls were expected to be modest, to hang back and only accept tasks and challenges forced upon them. Jill saw no reason to act that way. She was always on guard, fearing to be thought trivial, and she competed hard with the boys at school.\n\nIn the 1950’s in Sydney, she was treated as a curiosity or a disgrace by many male scholars, who couldn’t believe that a woman could be a genuine intellectual, or would want to be. She took honors courses at the University of Sydney, graduated first in her class and tried to ignore the men who treated her intellect, and breadth of interests, as unfeminine.\n\nShe planned to practice law or go into the Department of External Affairs, the Australian Foreign Service. But the better law firms spurned her interest and her Foreign Service application was rejected. Years later, she managed to see some of the reports on her candidacy. “Too good-looking,” said one report. Another said, “Too intellectually aggressive” and a third said, “She’d never do for diplomacy.”\n\nWhat about studying history? History was an enormous book, an infinite account. Surely, it could bear to have some small portion written by a diligent female Australian. She traveled in Europe for a year, returned to the University of Sydney for graduate work in American history, and then in 1960, left Australia for graduate school at Harvard with a sense that she was exiled from Australia, escaping her mother, escaping stifling social convention.\n\nShe’d been told by Australian travelers: “Don’t trust New Yorkers!’ She assumed that outgoing strangers, like cheap, gaudy emotions, were to be avoided. And then, in September 1960, she arrived in New York, at what was then called Idlewild Airport, in the midst of Hurricane Donna. Great gusts of wind. Thick, pounding rain. The inside of the airport a cheerful madhouse. Travelers were not just wet, but soaked through. Luggage and taxis were nowhere to be found.\n\nAt 2:00 a.m. the airport was humming with life, and Jill started to make sense of the chaos. All roads to the airport were flooded, so neither the ground crew nor buses, taxis or cars, could reach the airport terminal. Jill’s desire for privacy was ignored, her Australian sense of decorum overcome by the crowd’s high spirits.\n\nShe began talking to strangers, and confessed to one that if she arrived at night, she didn’t see how she could get into her dormitory — International House at Columbia University. Oh, there’ll be a night watchman, a thoughtful Yale grad student promised.\n\nSuddenly, through sheets of rain, an avalanche of suitcases arrived, and Jill found hers, and then a bus which finally chugged into the East Side terminal, where taxis were waiting.\n\nAt International House, the dignified night watchman was glad to see her, and said “I’ve been listening to the radio, wondering how you were doing in this storm after coming all the way from Australia.”\n\nThe next morning, on Amsterdam Avenue, a little bleary from the previous night’s adventure, she hailed a cab, figuring she’d go to Fifth Avenue and ogle the clothes at some of the upscale shops.\n\nThe cab was a rattletrap machine, the driver a husky man in a windbreaker. Where ya from?” the cabbie asked, and was delighted when she said “Australia.” When she asked him to stop at an American Express branch, he asked “Is it your first day in the city?”\n\nShe admitted it was.\n\nHe turned off the meter and said, “I’m going to show you Manhattan.” The driver’s name was Frank and he’d been in Sydney, Australia several times during World War Two and had been treated very well by the Aussies. Now, he wanted to pay it back.\n\nThey roamed the city. He drove her to Battery Park where they looked at the Statue of Liberty, then to the Fulton Street Fish Market. They had coffee together in Greenwich Village, strolled through Washington Square, admired the Art Deco glory of the Chrysler Building, saw Sutton Place because Marilyn Monroe lived there, and wound through Central Park. Frank was fond of all these places but in a streetwise way, and what connected the series of stories he told about the city was irony.\n\nThat cabbie’s generosity forever changed her impression of Americans.\n\nAnd in much of Conway’s writing is the sense that we trust in research, intellect, logic and the wisdom of those who came before — but that there’s something mocking in the way things turn out.\n\nExperience predicts certain outcomes — but life is not obedient."
