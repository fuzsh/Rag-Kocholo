        "text": "Jill Ker Conway was a writer, a scholar, president of Smith College in Northampton, MA â€“ and a philanthropist. An Australian native, Conway left her mark on the Boston community, including Pine Street, not only as a loyal donor during her lifetime, but also in helping to sustain Pine Street after her death last year.\n\nAs an annual fund donor, Conway went above and beyond in her support of Pine Street through planned giving efforts. She made a meaningful gift through her retirement and estate planning. We are grateful for her generosity, which will secure the continuation of our work for years to come.\n\nPlanned giving helps ensure a consistent, long-term source of funding. Please consider including Pine Street in your planning for the future.\n\nTo learn more about our planned giving program, contact Alicia Ianiere at alicia.ianiere@pinestreetinn.org or 617.892.9177."
