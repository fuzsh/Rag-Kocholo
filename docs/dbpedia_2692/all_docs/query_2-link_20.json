        "text": "Jill Ker Conway 1934-2018\n\nThe opening pages of Road From Coorain paint some of the most lyrical, vivid and haunting descriptions of the Australian bush, portraying a visceral link to the land decades after the author had left it.\n\nWhen it was published in 1989, Jill Ker Conway was already celebrated in North America for her ground-breaking achievements – a Vice President at the University of Toronto and then for a decade the first woman President of prestigious Smith College in Massachusetts, the alma mater of Sylvia Plath, Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, even Nancy Reagan. After Smith, she had joined the boards of number of multi-nationals. But it was the best-selling Road From Coorain that reminded us that this remarkable woman was Australian and that she had an extraordinary story to tell.\n\nJill Ker was the only daughter and the third and youngest child of William Innes Ker and Evelyn A’darmes. Her father, survived gassing at Ypres and, in 1929, after a stint managing a prosperous property, drew a soldier’s settlement – Coorain (“windy place”), 30,000-hectares at Hillston, between Ivanhoe and Hay on the western plains of New South Wales. A vast plain – windy, desolate, vast and sparse - “under the weight of that enormous sky”.\n\nJill’s mother, the complex, tortured heroine of Coorain, had grown up comfortably in a Queensland country town and become the matron of a provincial hospital before her marriage. Jill shares her memories of long night drives home from distant parties “my father’s beautiful tenor voice singing the popular songs of the moment until the lights of our car shone on the windows of Coorain”. As her brothers went off to boarding school, Jill was taught by Blackfriars’ Correspondence School and rode about Coorain with her father, playing a part in mustering, dipping, crutching, and lambing.\n\n1940 marked the beginning of a long drought and then, when she was 10, while trying to fix a broken pipe in one of the dams, William Ker drowned. His steely widow was undaunted – there were to be no tears. Evelyn was determined not to leave or lose Coorain and fought the elements, and all expectations. Eventually, she appointed a manager and moved to Sydney. Jill’s account of that journey by train to the city is memorably movingly magnificent.\n\nAfter the cultural shock of State schools, Jill was enrolled at Abbotsleigh on Sydney’s North Shore. Modelled on the British system, students were hatted and gloved (and not just stockinged but blue-stockinged), taught the importance of deportment and enunciation – and, happily, much else. Abbotsleigh’s redoubtable headmistress, Miss Gordon Everett, inspired her “gels”, Jill among them.\n\nShe thrived, emerging not just a beauty but brilliant, and gained entry to Sydney University. She won the University Medal in History but the cathartic event was to be rejected by the Department of Foreign Affairs, while her fellow, male medallist and male runner-up were accepted. Stung by comments like “too aggressively intellectual”, “too good-looking”, and “will be married within a year”, she was taken to Britain by Evelyn and even enrolled at a fashion a modelling school.\n\nOn her return, she joined the staff of Sydney University, and found herself teaching American history. This turned her gaze across the Pacific and she was accepted as a PhD student at Harvard. But the catalyst was really her relationship with Evelyn, whose heroic resolve had been fractured by another tragedy – the death of Jill’s brother, Robert, in a car accident.\n\nShe had grown bitter and combative and her possessiveness of Jill grew oppressive – “her consolation for her past tragedies, weighed on me like the Ancient Mariner’s albatross”. And so in 1960, Jill set off for Harvard – and Australia lost a star. On this note of uncertainty, and promise, Road from Coorain ended.\n\nAlmost immediately, Conway found the world she was meant to find. And, as a teaching assistant, she met and fell in love with Canadian John Conway, a wildly popular professor of history, a bachelor and veteran of the Second World War who had lost his right hand in a charge against a German pillbox in the Italian campaign.\n\nConway described him as “a totally and spontaneously liberated man”. They also shared a Catholic faith (Jill having converted soon after arriving in the US). They married in 1962. After a sabbatical, they moved to Canada where John joined the staff of York University while Jill became a lecturer at the University of Toronto.\n\nShe rose, ineffably, to become Vice President of Internal Affairs, proving to be a deft and innovative administrator. As she recounts in True North (1994), the second volume of her memoirs, she combined being a campus wife with a campaigner for reform. “I would find myself making up shopping lists with one part of my mind (rib roast, new potatoes, Boston lettuce), while the other functioned apparently smoothly to deliver the lecture of the moment on the causes of the Civil War.” She also battled privately with John’s bouts of manic depression and the profound sadness of not being able to have children.\n\nJill and John had promised to accommodate each other’s careers, taking turns decade by decade. In 1975, Conway was appointed President of Smith, one of perhaps the most illustrious – certainly the largest – liberal arts institution for women; one of the Seven Sisters. She was famous. Time magazine named her one of its Women of the Year. Of course, she had to deal with Smith’s largely male Old Guard. They even dubbed themselves “the Dinosaurs”. But how thrilling her first convocation must have been – as 2200 young women chanted “Jill, Jill, Jill” drumming the floor as they cheered.\n\nAs the last of her memoirs, A Woman’s Education (2011) relates, she did not disappoint. She built a new sports centre and introduced rugby. Smith’s endowment nearly tripled in her time and she extended an existing programme for older women whose education had been interrupted or stalled.\n\nThe year 1985 heralded another change. Jill and John settled in Conway, Massachusetts, and while John retired, Jill joined the boards of Merrill Lynch, Nike, Colgate-Palmolive and Lendlease. Nike was a good example of her approach. Before agreeing to join, she insisted on a campaign to stimulate interest in sport for girls; she chaired a corporate social responsibility committee and regularly visited Nike plants and suppliers in Asia to check the working conditions of the mainly female workforce.\n\nIt was her fury at the fabricated portrayal of rural Australia, in the blockbusting Crocodile Dundee and Thorn Birds, especially its men (whom, unlike some other feminists, she never loathed) that led her to pen Road From Coorain. She also saw it, and its sequels, as a life lesson for other young women. Coorain was on the New York Times’ bestseller list for 54 weeks and entered the canon of Australian biography.\n\nConway returned home at least every two or three years and, with her slight soft East Coast burr, she was never reluctant to express – shrewdly but never shrilly; bluntly but never bitterly – her views on Australia. Expats were not allowed to be critical – chippy commentators called her “Mother Superior”. But she persevered.\n\nJohn died in 1995. She remained in Massachusetts and kept extraordinarily active. Housing for homeless veterans became a passionate cause. Well into her 70s, she was still swimming, kayaking, a visiting professor at MIT, and on the Board of Nike.\n\nShe garnered some three dozen honorary degrees and received the National Humanities Medal from President Obama. In 2013, she was named an honorary AC (honorary because she became a US citizen in 1982, determined to vote against Ronald Reagan). She saw her AC as “a source of joy, pride, and gratitude, a glorious coda to a long life with deep roots in this country” and rejoiced in the country of her childhood “the vast horizon, symbol of the smallness of mankind, is still there. So is the dazzling night sky, the scent of eucalyptus, the sound of galahs at sunset, and the ubiquitous dust, always a reminder of mortality.”\n\nHer love for her two worlds was reflected in her final wishes. Half her ashes will rest in a small private cemetery with John’s, near their beloved house and garden in Massachusetts. The other half are to be scattered by the big tree beside the roadway into the house at Coorain.\n\nMark McGinness"
