        "text": "Very Interesting\n\nI received an education about Australia, whose history I've neglected until now. Conway's upbringing, education, and eventual departure from her homeland is most unique, while generously managing to convey for most readers connections into Conway's experiences and views. \"Independent and brave\" certainly sums this character's life. The writing is beautifully detailed and poetic, making the listening a delight.\n\nFantastic book\n\nA professor friend of mine, who is also from Australia, recommended this book to me. She is a friend of the author. My friend was raised in Australia but had a different back ground. Her father was a university history professor and her mother was Australia most famous composer. They shared the same boarding school experience. They became friends here in the U.S. when both were professors. I am sure glad I took my friend's advice. This is a great book. Conway paints a picture in rich detail of life in the outback. I could feel myself there with the wind on my face. What a hard life the ranchers had and probably still do. I was most interested in her description of the stoic character of the Australian people. She described my friend personality to a tee. Conway takes us on a journey of self discovery both of her personal life with the lost of her father and older brother to finding her place in academia. In passing, she furnished, a great insight into the difference between high school learning and university learning. She provides a great deal of information of the daily life of a girl growing up in the late1930s to 1960 Australia. She describes the gender discrimination which I could easily relate to having grown up in the same time frame. I had read \"A Town Named Alice\" from Audible, also about Australia, between the two books they paint an fascinating picture of Australia's out back. Barbara Caruso did a great job narrating the book. Enjoyed the pre and post comments by Jill Ker Conway. You will enjoy this book.\n\nSo glad I (finally) listened to my aunt\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s and ready to set off for 2 years as a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa, I asked friends and family to recommend books I might take along with me, and an aunt who knew me well recommended this one. Unfortunately I didn't bring it along, and I didn't get around to reading it until now, nearly 20 years later. So glad I finally did. What a beautifully written memoir! And what a fine example of an intelligent, thoughtful girl's journey of self-discovery. The descriptions of 1940s life in the Australian outback are vivid and fascinating, and the taste of life in Sydney during the author's adolescent years and young adulthood are equally interesting. Barbara Caruso's narration is superb, as usual."
