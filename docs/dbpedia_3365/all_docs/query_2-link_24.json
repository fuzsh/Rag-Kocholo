The project started in February 2024 and will last for 3 years. The research consortium, led by Prof. Lior Klein from the Department of Physics at Bar-Ilan University, brings together researchers from INESC-MN (Portugal), Bar-Ilan University (Israel), and UCLouvain - Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium), as well as industrial partners such as SpinEdge LLC (Israel) and Interactive Fully Electrical Vehicles (Italy). In Lisbon, the team is led by Prof.Susana Freitas, a researcher at INESC MN and professor at the Department of Physics of Instituto Superior Técnico, whose widely distinguished work in thin films and spintronics will be essential for the design and manufacturing of magnetic nanodevices in the project. The Pathfinder Open program promotes high-risk, high-reward scientific innovations and the development of technologies still in the early stages. This is the case of the innovative device that the project proposes to develop, applying spintronics to the field of artificial intelligence: processing units based on magnetic tunnel junctions that exhibit multiple distinguishable magnetic states, allowing for more than the usual 2 digital states and, therefore, achieving significant gains in terms of computing speed and energy efficiency. This hardware will be integrated into information processing through neuromorphic computing. The impact will be significant in artificial intelligence applications that require high energy consumption and increased computational resources, thus benefiting from the optimization of processing capacity (for example, in areas that require \"on-site\" computing, such as autonomous mobility or robotics). With the project, the development of an initial prototype and the demonstration of the proof of concept are expected, through the integration of magnetic devices into a processing array and the construction of artificial intelligence algorithms that validate it. #WeareTécnico #AI #innovation #spintronics #PathfinderOpenProgram #research #EIC #INESCMN\n\nAston University Receives £1 Million Grant to Revolutionize Miniaturized Optics for Manufacturing, IT, and Agriculture Aston University is leading the way in miniaturized optics with a £1.17 million grant to develop revolutionary devices for various industries. The project, titled Picometer Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (PicoSNAP), is helmed by Professor Misha Sumetsky of Aston University's Institute of Photonic Technologies (AIPT). It aims to overcome limitations in traditional fabrication by creating devices a million times smaller than a human hair (measured in picometers). PicoSNAP technology offers unique light manipulation capabilities: Light travels along the fiber's perimeter, enabling functionalities not possible with conventional methods. This breakthrough has the potential to: > Deliver miniaturized optical devices with unprecedented performance > Revolutionize fields like manufacturing, IT, and agriculture with highly precise sensors The project will focus on developing a scalable and reliable manufacturing process for these picometer-scale devices, paving the way for real-world applications. This research aligns perfectly with Aston University's commitment to impactful research addressing global challenges. https://lnkd.in/dEr39aYk #optics #photonics #nanotechnology #engineering #research #astonuniversity #PhotonicSpots #PhotonicsTimes\n\nAcademic Update! Recently, I successfully presented my M. Tech minor project, which focused on highly stretchable soft sensor for soft robotic wearable devices, aimed at human motion and health monitoring. This experience was challenging yet rewarding as it marked my first presentation of this kind. I am deeply grateful to Dr. Soumen Sen, Dr. SOUMEN MANDAL, and Dr. Nripen Chanda (Human Centred Robotics & cybernetics Group) for their unwavering support, meticulous monitoring, thorough technical evaluation, and invaluable guidance throughout this project. Their expertise and encouragement have been instrumental in shaping my master's research journey. I am now eager to connect and enthusiastic to explore with researchers worldwide who share similar interests and expertise in this field. Thank you for any sharing or connections provided.

The research team notes that drone identification is generally conducted using radars, cameras, and transponders, with the latter providing real-time updates on location in civilian contexts. However, these methods can fail in harsh conditions, including limited line of sight, multiple air traffic participants, and tall buildings blocking satellite signals, among other challenges. The researchers highlight that this new technology can overcome these challenges and provide a superior level of reliability by using smart stickers and a radar supported by an AI algorithm that classifies drones based on the electromagnetic radiation they scatter. The development was led by Ph.D. students Omer Tzidki and Dmytro Vovchuk from Prof. Pavel Ginzburg’s lab, the Iby and Aladar Fleischman Faculty of Engineering. The lab specializes in developing novel radar and wireless communication technologies, facing new and forthcoming challenges.

Similar to how car suspensions smooth out a bumpy ride, muscles possess unique mechanical properties that support the stability of our movements and enable us to react fast when stepping on something unexpected. This research topic has important implications for neuroscience as it shows that our nervous system can exploit our body mechanics when dealing with complex locomotive tasks. Thanks to the interdisciplinary community at IMPRS-IS, I also collaborated with Dr. An Mo in integrating these biological concepts into the design of advanced legged robots. Getting my PhD was an exciting and emotional journey. I am immensely grateful for the extraordinary individuals I encountered at IMPRS-IS and Universitätsklinikum Tübingen. Their support, guidance, and friendship were pivotal to my success.\" Fabio began his academic journey in mechanical engineering at Politecnico di Milano. Upon completing his bachelor’s degree, he was admitted to TU Delft, where he studied Biomechanical Design and BioRobotics. For his master’s project, Fabio developed an algorithm that allows a lower limb exoskeleton to be controlled by the swing of a patient’s arm. In 2019, he began his doctorate at MPI-IS in the Dynamic Locomotion group under the supervision of Dr.Alexander Badri-Spröwitz and Dr. Daniel Häufle. Now, he moved to Boston to work as a postdoctoral researcher in Professor Song’s lab at Northeastern University. Fabio’s current endeavor involves customizing neuromusculoskeletal models to enhance the development and evaluation of wearable robotic devices. #MPIIS #IMPRSIS #IntelligentSystems #Phdstudent #Phdthesis #ThesisDefense\n\nOn October 18, Sang-woo Nam and Dong-ju Choi, students in the integrated master's/PhD program at DGIST’s Department of Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering, and members of Prof. Jae-Sok Yu and Prof. Sangyoon Han's joint research team, were selected as finalists at the IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium 2023. Their paper was among the top 15 of over a thousand papers submitted to the symposium and described a new semiconductor-based ‘ultrasonic sensor’, which was created by the team by combining silicon-photonics and micro-electromechanical systems. The sensor is highly sensitive and can detect ultrasonic waves with extremely low intensities. The research was funded by the Samsung Future Technology Development Project and is expected to pave the way for futuristic, high-performance sensors in ultrasonic testing and medical ultrasound imaging.
