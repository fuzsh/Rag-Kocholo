        "text": "What's this?\n\nWhen talking about the history of professional cycling, people commonly ask two questions: how much has doping affected the sport and can we trust past results?\n\nThe short answer to both is that nobody knows. And yet, while this website isn't here to draw any big conclusions, the body of data could offer us some sort of a bigger picture.\n\nSo the grid on this page represents four decades of podium placings for a selection of major European road races and the Top 20 on GC for each of the three Grand Tours (Giro, Tour, Vuelta).\n\nIf you want to know more about the ideas behind the grid, jump to the Commentary below. Otherwise, continue reading to learn how to read it.\n\nAlong the x axis from left to right, you have the seasons starting from 1980. Scrolling from top to bottom on the y axis, you have the results of each of the races.\n\nAll of which means that a single square block represents an individual listed on this website with a placing in a given race for a given year. Hover over each one and you'll see what it represents\n\nThat's not quite the whole story: each block has different colours. These colours are explained in the legend below:\n\nNotes\n\nThese are finish line data: results are listed prior to the application of any penalties including disqualification. For stage races, only the final GC result is recorded.\n\nSome visitors may encounter problems with the slow display of annotations on the graphic due to the high level of processing required.\n\nWhen Lance Armstrong was banned by the USADA, several websites, independently and in different countries, languages and formats, attempted an illustration of cycling's \"lost years\" by showing how the Tour de France palmares might have looked with \"known dopers\" excised from the GC results.\n\nWhile these illustrations sent many cycling fans scuttling off to find out more about theoretical winners like Kurt Van De Wouwer and Daniele Nardello, lingering problems remained about what exactly was being suggested here.\n\nThe first of these had to do with editorial cherrypicking: it seemed that certain sports editors, to borrow a popular phrase, only watch cycling in July. For all but the most casual of viewers, the Tour de France is hardly representative of the entire sport.\n\nThe second, as any student of political history will confirm, was that a broad purge of 'offenders' tends to overlook individual cases. What acts or omissions qualify for an editorial strikethrough? Are some cases more flagrant or reprehensible than others? Does a filtered list somehow suggest that those who remain are 'clean'?\n\nI think even Kurt and Daniele would agree that this sort of illustration can't be right.\n\nAny sort of snapshot taken from a \"net effect\" view is likely to be both small and awkwardly black and white but some editors are wont to encourage what Dopeology tries to avoid: sensationalism. In other words, implying guilt, labelling individuals and teams as 'dirty' and pouring scorn on the fallibility of cycling's history books.\n\nAnd yet, despite these criticisms, could there be some merit in looking at results with a slightly more prudent eye? Instead of delivering some premature eulogy of our sport by projecting wistful 'what ifs', could we take a broader view of history?\n\nThe information in Dopeology is far from perfect but it seems quite appropriate as the basis of a longitudinal presentation without editorial bias.\n\nHence the grid on this page. It's an analogy of the results taken from electrophoresis, a process used to separate and analyse proteins. These results are described in a blot image which, rather than imposing a view of individual, separable results, tends instead to draw attention otherwise hidden patterns.\n\nGot feedback?"
