        "text": "The beginnings\n\nIt was in the seventies when I started sailing, I was twelve years old. I did my first sailing course together with my cousinÂ Gianbattista at the Brenzone sailing club taught by NicolinoÂ SalvÃ . At that time the club had a small space on the beachÂ crammed with boats. We went out for a couple of hours in theÂ afternoon with Nicolino who taught us the basics from a smallÂ rubber boat.\n\nWe sailed with whatever there was available. Optimists alreadyÂ existed but nobody had one. There were some Flying JuniorsÂ but we could not use them as they were racing boats. The boatÂ most coveted was the 470. I remember we used two yellow boats with a rounded bow because they were the easiest to rightÂ after a capsize. They were called Flic and Floc.\n\nMy uncle Lino sailed with a gaff rigged boat. They were fishingÂ boats modified with a trapeze, masts in wood and canvas sailsÂ made by a local sailmaker. In those days there was always a regatta somewhere around Brenzone on a Sunday in the summertime. I used to enjoy going to watch and then after the raceÂ going out for a sail with my uncle. Then I became his crew andÂ with him participated in my first regattas.\n\nWhen I was 17-18 years old a group of Star sailors got togetherÂ in Acquafresca. At that time, I used to sail with the PontoniÂ twins and then with Nereo Modena. After several summer outings I did my first Star regatta in Sulzano, Lago dâIseo. It wasÂ in 1984 and I started to race more seriously.\n\nMy career in Olympic classes\n\nThat same year I started my activity in the Olympic classes asÂ crew to Roberto Benamati who had just left the FinnÂ to sail the Star.\n\nWe started well. In 1985 we qualified for the Worlds in theÂ Bahamas. The Italian Federation had rented an old Star in Nassau and we concluded our first Worlds in twenty first place.Â How exciting it was. I have happy memories even though theÂ result was not the best. I felt as if I was walking on the moon.\n\nThe year after at the Worlds in Capri there were 130 boats. ItÂ was one of the largest fleets ever assembled. The Italians wereÂ strong and were the team to beat. Indeed, four crews of whichÂ two were from Lake Garda finished in the top ten. Albino Fravezzi was in fifth place and Roberto and me in eighth.\n\n1987 was the year of the Worlds in Chicago on Lake Michigan large and windy. My firstÂ time in the United States.\n\nIn 1988 we missed out on qualifying for the Worlds in Argentina (Buenos Aires) andÂ for the Olympics in Seoul. It was won by Giorgio Gorla followed by Albino Fravezzi. Having missed out on selection Roberto and I decided to separate. At the end of theÂ four year Olympic cycle all the cards areÂ thrown into the pot and recycled andÂ often crews switch around. I ended upÂ together with Albino still in the Star and we continued together until 1991-92.\n\nIn 1990 with Albino we won the Italian Championship. In 1991 we wereÂ confirmed Italian Champions and weÂ won the Spring Europeans organised by the Fraglia Vela MalcesineÂ and Acquafresca. There were 130 boatsÂ from all over the world. Lots of boats!Â With this set of results we were seriousÂ contenders for the Olympics in Barcelona but the federation had decided quiteÂ rightly to send Roberto Benamati andÂ Mario Salani who would win the Worlds in Cannes in the following month ofÂ October.\n\nAt the end of 1992 I returned to the StarÂ with Roberto and we arrived fourth atÂ the Worlds in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1993 I participated in regattas withÂ the Libera del Garda class and the Asso99 with which I won the National title and theÂ European circuit. I also took part in the Soling Europeans organised by the TorboleÂ sailing club together with Flavio Favini and Marco di Natale finishing in fourth place.\n\nThe following three years Robert and I returned to the Star together and were amongst the top of the fleet in Italy. Tommaso Chieffi was our closest adversary and the manÂ to beat having won the Worlds in Rio di Janeiro in 1996 and he subsequently won theÂ selection to go to the Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nI finished 1996 in the Soling with Giovanni Arrivabene and Fabio Toccoli. In 1998 IÂ returned to the Star with Luca Modena and in 1999 with Silvio Santoni. With SilvioÂ I participated in the 1999 Worlds in Punta Ala with more than 150 boats registered.Â We ended our experience together in 2000 at Annapolis an American city alongsideÂ Chesapeake Bay near Washington.\n\nThat same year my participation in Olympic sailing drew to a close and I took part inÂ several offshore regattas where I won a Mumm 30 Worlds and a Barcolana.\n\nA coach for the Italian Sailing Federation\n\nIn 1994 I was coach for the Optimist team in the Lake Garda Zone. I remember it wasÂ Gianni Testa ( 82) who recommended me to the President of the committee. AtÂ that time the squad comprised the best sailors from all the clubs: Malcesine, BardolinoÂ and Torbole had joined the project and we had formed a good team. In 1995 sailing forÂ the Fraglia Vela Malcesine there was Mara Trimeloni, Daniele Scalet and Ylena Carcasole who had won the Italian Championships in Cagliari.\n\nThe year after as Technical Director for the Federation I was responsible for the Optimist and Equipe teams, a job I did until 2004. The results were not long in coming.Â The Optimist team had won three Worlds and the Equipe several European titles andÂ most of the more important regattas. The youngsters from this team are now all professional people and it is nice to come across them even now at various race meetings.\n\nFrom 2004 and for five years I trained the 29ers for the Federation. Our best result wasÂ third place in the Worlds in the Bahamas and a tenth place at the Worlds in Riva delÂ Garda which had nearly 300 boats on the start line.\n\nAnd thanks to Sergio Gaibisso, the President of the Italian Sailing Federation, I wasÂ able to continue my racing career until the year 2000 whilst still keeping my commitments to the federation.\n\nTechnical Director for the NationalÂ Paralympic Team\n\nIn 2009 I became the Technical Director for the National Paralympic Team.\n\nThe three boats used for the Paralympics all have a keel. TheÂ 2.4 is a single-hander with main and jib. The Skud 18 is a mixedÂ crew, double handed boat similar to the 49er. The Sonar is aÂ boat for three people, it is seven metres long and is the only classÂ where the crew have to move from side to side when tacking.\n\nWe had worked together for only two years in preparation forÂ the London Olympics of 2012 and it went very well. We qualified in all three classes, a feat which was realised in only fiveÂ other nations throughout the world. We departed for the games in good spirits well aware that a good result would also beÂ a bonus. In fact our best result was a fifth place in the Skud 18.\n\nOn the opening day the Times newspaper dedicated the wholeÂ paper to the games. The sailing took place in Portland a townÂ facing the English-channel. The Olympic village was small butÂ very comfortable and the port only five minutes away by bus.\n\nThe Paralympic regimen is very similar to that of the Olympics: there is a circuit together with the Olympic classes with itsÂ rounds of European and World Cups as well as a EuropeansÂ and Worlds for all three classes. Between regattas and trainingÂ the Paralympic team is busy for 150 days of the year.\n\nFor the paralympics of Rio di Janeiro in 2016 our prospects forÂ results were very different. We had a crew who won Silver andÂ two Bronze medals at the last three Worlds and were expectingÂ to come home with some medals.\n\nRio proved to be more complicated than London. We arrivedÂ in Brazil 15 days before the regatta but the first week we neededÂ to get our bearings and overcome the difficulties created by theÂ lack of organisation at the venue.\n\nThe Olympic village was enormous and an hour and a half distance from the sailing venue by minibus. This brought with itÂ added discomfort and stress in addition to that normally experienced in everyday life.\n\nWe arrived seventh with the 2.4 twelfth with the Sonar and Sixth with the Skud 18. With the Skud 18 a horrible windy day withÂ one disqualification and two retirements had wiped away ourÂ hopes of a podium place. A great pity! Probably in strong windÂ we were not really on a par with the better crews.\n\nParticipating in an Olympics is an incredible experience. TheÂ athletes have the weight of expectation on their shoulders andÂ the stress of competing. As the coach I have to look out for theÂ whole team and ensure that my team are the best preparedÂ they can be in order to perform to their potential. I organisedÂ everything leading up to the event. I organised it in a way thatÂ they would arrive fresh and with the minimum of stress andÂ worries so that they could put all their concentration and energy into the racing.\n\nWe are now in 2016 and I am still working with the SailingÂ Federation but part-time. I want to dedicate more time to myÂ campsite and my family. I have also thought about steppingÂ away completely from sailing but donât think I can manage it. I would miss it too much.\n\nFraglia Vela Malcesine\n\nIn 1992 I arrived at Fraglia and taught several sailing courses forÂ children with Angelica Tonelli.\n\nIn 2000 I became a member of the sailing club and several years later joined the board becoming Sporting Director of theÂ training teams.\n\nDespite my title decisions have always been taken on a sharedÂ basis with the objective of increasing the activities for childrenÂ and to bring to the Fraglia as many of the people from Malcesine as possible.\n\nGianni Testa is an incredible force. I donât know how he doesÂ it. Difficulties have and will always arise but he confronts themÂ head on with the most optimistic and cheerful spirit.\n\nIt was difficult in the beginning to find a coach who could giveÂ stability to the project. Ylena was an intuitive decision. A girlÂ from Malcesine who had grown up in the Fraglia, an athleteÂ of high standard and likeable. Before Ylena Valerio Brighenti was responsible for the school but was primarily concerned with managing the courses for racing. After Valerio there was Ezequiel Schargorodsky who did an excellent job. WhenÂ the children from the Optimist squad were ready to move boatÂ Valerio an ex laser sailor formed the Laser team and immediately achieved some good results.\n\nAnother leap forward in organisation came with the arrival ofÂ Mattia LonardiÂ who has organised all the activities ofÂ the sailing school lifting some of the responsibilities previouslyÂ carried by Ylena. After this arrived Luigi Rago for the 420 squadÂ and Giorgia BrizioÂ for windsurfing.\n\nWe are the only sailing club on Lake Garda with a sailing school for Optimist and windsurfing and a group of sailors dividedÂ into four training squads with about eighty sailors.\n\nAt the Fraglia the activities come first and there is no pressureÂ to bring home results at any cost. We all work in an atmosphereÂ of calm without labels and without jealousy. Our coaches workÂ to create a squad and are highly motivated. They have the Fraglia in their hearts and it is an integral part of their being. ThisÂ is our secret for success.\n\nTo sustain the cost of the training we need to work hand inÂ hand with the Marina Navene Srl which is owned by the TownÂ Council of Malcesine. The space and Logistics of the new baseÂ could not be better. We are able to organise regattas of a highÂ level and give an excellent service to the athletes who come toÂ our waters to execute their training.\n\nThe Italian Sailing Federation have chosen us as their trainingÂ base and we want to increase the numbers of athletes whoÂ come to train year on year and all year round. In this way weÂ can increase the commercial activity of Malcesine to the benefit of all of its inhabitants.\n\nThe Fraglia Vela Malcesine is not an elitist place – there is nobody who looks down their nose at others. It is true that sailing is an expensive sport and true that playing football costs muchÂ less, but for sure you can learn to sail without a radical outlayÂ or the need to become a champion.\n\nSo why not get out there and get to know a whole new world?\n\nWe live on the most famous lake in the world for sailing. We have everything at our fingertips, it would be nice if everybody knew whatÂ it is to go sailing.Â\n\nSo why not get out there and get to know a whole new world?"
