        "text": "—Predictive torque control is based on the prediction of motor torque and stator flux for all possible voltage vectors of power converter. These predictions are derived from a mathematical model of the motor that depends on the motor parameters. But, these parameters may not match with their actual values. These parametric uncertainties lead to inaccurate predictions of torque and stator flux and affect the performance of the predictive algorithm. This paper presents a modified predictive torque control for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to reduce the torque ripple at the presence of parametric uncertainty by improving the prediction accurateness. Simulation and experimental results are provided to show the effect of the proposed method.  Index Terms—— Permanent magnet motor, predictive control, robustness, prediction error.\n\nModel predictive current controllers (MPCCs) are widely applied in motor drive control and operations. To date, however, the presence of large current errors in conventional predictive current control remains a significant predicament, due to harmonic distortions and current ripples. Naturally, noticeable current estimation inaccuracies lead to poor performance. To improve the above situation, a modulated model predictive current controller (MMPCC) is proposed for interior permanent-magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) in this paper. Two successive voltage vectors will be applied in a sampling period to greatly boost the number of candidate switching modes from seven to thirteen. A cost function, which is defined as the quadratic sum of current prediction errors, is employed to find an optimal switching mode and an optimized duty ratio to be applied in the next sampling period, such that the cost value is minimal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through eight experiments using a TMS320F28379D microcontroller, and performance comparisons are made against an existing MPCC. In terms of quantitative improvements made to the MPCC, the proposed MMPCC reduces its current ripple and total harmonic distortion (THD) by, on average, 27.17% and 21.84%, respectively."
