Probable Cabinet. When the Prime Minister had been hard at work for two days a source close to Scot MacDonald disclosed this "tentative Cabinet":

Chancellor of the Exchequer: Neville Chamberlain, the high-tariff Conservative who managed his party's phenomenally successful election campaign.

Foreign Secretary: Sir Austen Chamberlain, famed elder brother, toplofty Nobel Peace Prize winner (1925). But Sir Austen was reported willing to take a sinecure (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster) and to leave the Marquess of Reading at the Foreign office.

First Lord of the Admiralty: Lord Hailsham, to succeed Sir Austen.

Secretary for War: Winston Churchill, smoking hot with pride because Epping returned him last week with his majority quadrupled.

Present members of the National Government slated to keep their posts:

Home Secretary: Sir Herbert Samuel, who led the "National Liberal" bolt from Lloyd George to Scot MacDonald.

Secretary for India: Sir Samuel Hoare, present Conservative representative in the India Round Table Conference.

Secretary for Dominions: James Henry ("Jim") Thomas, the Cabinet's bridge expert.

Two sinecures were tentatively disposed of thus:

Lord President of the Council: Stanley Baldwin.

Lord Privy Seal: Philip Snowden.

Sir John Simon, Liberal, who also bolted from Lloyd George to the National Government, was mentioned last week for almost every prominent Cabinet post, also for appointment as British High Commis- sioner to renegotiate Reparations and War Debts.

Editorialized the London Times: "The first principle of the election, necessary to an efficient National Government, is the expulsion of those likely to prove centres of irritation and obstruction. . . ."

Plutocrat's Parliament. One Major General, five Brigadier Generals, 22 Lieutenant Colonels and more than 125 M. P.'s with rank above a Captain or a Commander were returned to the House last week. Along with these officially "Gallant Members," 20 courtesy Lords (heirs to peerages) were elected. Among them was Edward of Wales's close friend and frequent golf opponent, Viscount Ednam. Even Loel Guinness, who calls cousins the Ale & Stout Guinnesses, was triumphantly returned by Whitechapel with the record majority of 16,455. This same constituency at two previous elections turned the Heir of Guinness down. The new House is frankly a plutocrats' Parliament. So elated were the entire Royal Family that they went in a body to a multi-scened musical revue* directly after, the electionÂ—something Their Majesties and Sons and Daughter-in-law have not done since George V's pneumonia (TIME, Nov. 18, 1929).

Old Bull At "The Old Bull" in Burnley with a glass of brownish medicine at the head of his bed lay, last week, "Uncle Arthur" Henderson, Scot MacDonald's successor as Leader of the Labor Party, sick with a heavy cold. By some excruciating mix-up his local party headquarters had received word from Burnley's ballot counters that "Mr. Henderson has been returned by a huge majority!"
