The most important of the Valois dukes of Burgundy, he founded the Burgundian state that rivaled France in the 15th century. He confirmed his right to Burgundy by signing the Treaty of Troyes with Henry V of England (1420), and he maintained an alliance with England, breaking it only during his unsuccessful attempt to capture Calais (1435-39). Philip avoided conflict with France and instead attacked his smaller neighbors, conquering Hainaut, Brabant, Holland and Zeeland, and Luxembourg by 1443. A renowned patron of the arts, he presided over one of Europe's most extravagant courts. born 238 died 179 BC, Amphipolis, Macedonia King of Macedonia (221-179).

Rome responded in the First Macedonian War. Intrigue against Egypt and Philip's unsuccessful sea battle with Rhodes and Pergamum led Rome to initiate the Second Macedonian War, in which it prevailed at Cynoscephalae (197). Rome's harsh terms eased after Philip made common cause against its Greek foes. Fearing that Rome would turn on him again, he attempted to expand by attacking the Balkans (184, 183, 181); he died on a fourth attempt in 179. Spanish Felipe orig.

Grandson of Louis XIV of France and great-grandson of Philip IV of Spain, Philip was named to succeed the childless Charles II as king in 1700. Louis's refusal to exclude Philip from the line of succession to the French throne led to the War of the Spanish Succession. The resultant Peace of Utrecht (1713) deprived Philip of the Spanish Netherlands and parts of Italy, but it left him Spain and Spanish America. Initially influenced by his French advisers through his wife, Maria Luise of Savoy, after her death (1714) he was influenced by his second wife, Elizabeth Farnese, and her Italian advisers. Attempts to secure territories in Italy caused the formation of the Quadruple Alliance (1718) against Spain. Philip later brought Spain into the War of the Austrian Succession. His reign marked the beginning of the Bourbon dynasty in Spain (see house of Bourbon). German Philipp born 1178 died June 21, 1208, Bamberg, Ger. German Hohenstaufen king (1198-1208).

Appointed regent for his nephew, he seized the throne. He initially promoted peace with his neighbours, using the time gained thereby to build his forces and introducing innovations in arms, tactics, and training and stabilizing his western frontier. His movements on the eastern frontier provoked the Greeks into forming a coalition against him. He intervened in the Sacred War to free Delphi from the Phocians, becoming the ally of Thebes and the Thessalian League, whose president he became. Demosthenes turned Athens against him with his Philippics (346-342), and Thebes also came to view Philip as a threat. He defeated both at the Battle of Chaeronea, becoming leader of all Greece. He formed the Greek states into the League of Corinth to attack Persia but was undone by family politics. After he took a second wife, his first wife, Olympias, left him, taking Alexander.

Philip returned to France (1191) and attacked English possessions; imprisoned in Austria on his journey home, Richard was freed in 1194 and promptly went to war with the French. When Richard was killed (1199), his brother John signed a treaty with Philip (1200), but within two years France and England were again at war. Philip conquered Normandy (1204) and subdued Maine, Touraine, Anjou, and most of Poitou (1204-05).

War with England (1294-1303) ended with a peace treaty and the betrothal of his daughter to the future Edward II. Philip forced a harsh treaty on Flanders in 1305. He conducted a long struggle with Boniface VIII (1297-1303) that led to the breakdown of the medieval papacy. He was pacified by succeeding popes, including Clement V, who began the Avignon papacy.
