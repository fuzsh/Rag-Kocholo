It outlines different factions that existed within the early Labour Party and explores how the trade unions came to find a political home there. Prior to the First World War, the Labour Party owed much of its electoral success to agreements forged with the Liberals and adopted a defensive position with respect to workers and trade union rights. The Taff Vale case encouraged the party to look towards representation as a means of furthering working-class concerns. The First World War gave Labour’s leaders a seat in government for the first time, as part of the coalition. By the end of the war, largely due to a split within the Liberal Party, Labour emerged as the main opposition to the Conservative Party.",
