        "text": "The information in this article is part of an upcoming rework, and may not be reflected in other articles.\n\nThe 1923 Labour Government of the United Kingdom, formally known as the MacDonald Ministry was formed on the 6th February 1923 and dissolved on the 2nd January 1924. The Labour Party, under Ramsay MacDonald, had failed to win the general election of January 1923, having won 191 seats, although the combined Opposition tally exceeded that of the Conservative government's own seat count of 240, creating a hung parliament. Law briefly remained in office until February following the events of the Curzon Crisis and resigned following MacDonald's announcement he could form a government with the backing of the Liberal Party.\n\nMacDonald had become Labour's first proper leader in 1922 after prior experience in leadership, and was now faced with the challenge of putting together a cabinet comprised of men who had little or no experience in government. Only three members had previously been ministers and two only briefly: Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, Arthur Henderson and J. R. Clynes; though others had been under-secretaries. Likewise, MacDonald had to balance the growing factionalism within Labour and decide whether to make concessions to the increasingly strong left-wing of the party. Traditionally on the left of the already radical Independent Labour Party, MacDonald had gradually become more moderate and sought to build a cabinet that would reflect this, ultimately being characterised by a moderate trade union feel with support from the avowed left-wing and some dissident Liberals that sought to endorse the new government. Labour also had few Lords - a central issue of the Curzon Crisis - and was forced to rely on clever navigation of the upper chamber to ever secure smooth passage of its bills.\n\nConstantly in the throes of crisis and hostility from the Conservative dominated opposition, the government was repeatedly faced with the threat of collapse. What eventually helped to bring down the Labour government was red-baiting; the fear surrounding an alleged Syndicalist threat. Conservatives were quick to point out any Communard influence in Britain, one example being the Campbell Case, though ultimately the fallout of MacDonald's attempts to normalise relations with Communard France and the release of the Cachin Letter proved potentially too much of a scandal for the government. Talks of a vote of no confidence began though H. H. Asquith, the Leader of the Liberal Party, called for the appointment of a committee of enquiry, as this would allow Labour time to survive the scandal. MacDonald refused and warned said that if MPs voted in favour of the enquiry, then the government would treat this as a vote of no confidence. Right-wing Liberals joined with the Conservatives to push the enquiry and the government resigned. Snap elections were held in the following January.\n\nCabinet[]\n\n6th February 1923 - 2nd January 1924[]\n\nRamsay MacDonald – Prime Minister and Leader of the House of Commons\n\nThe Viscount Haldane – Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and joint Leader of the House of Lords\n\nThe Lord Parmoor – Lord President of the Council and joint Leader of the House of Lords\n\nJohn Robert Clynes - Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal and Deputy Leader of the House of Commons\n\nPhilip Snowden - Chancellor of the Exchequer\n\nArthur Henderson – Secretary of State for the Home Department\n\nE.D.
