        "text": "It is one of the ironies of history that\n\nmen we often remembered for their\n\nspectacular failures rather than for many\n\nwise, inconspicuous services they may\n\nrender to mankind. This is unjust, but\n\nhuman and inevitable. So Neville Cham-\n\nberlain will be remembered for Munich,\n\nwhich in retrospective judgment has had\n\nto be written down as a failure, but which\n\nat the time was rightly acclaimed as a\n\nsplendid piece of statesmanship.\n\nThe Munich agreement was signed on\n\nSeptember 30, 1938. Within 12 months\n\nBritain was at war with Germany.\n\nWithin 20 months Poland, Denmark, Nor-\n\nway, Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg, and\n\nFrance were prostrate under the heel of\n\nGermany, and Britain and her Empire\n\nfaced the enemy alone.\n\nMen will not forget Mr. Chamberlain's\n\n\"peace for our time,\" but doubtless some\n\nfew of them will also remember the\n\ntragedy of his speech in the Commons\n\nwhen war became inevitable . . . \"all\n\nthat I have worked for, all that I had\n\nhoped for, has fallen in fragments about\n\nme.\" . . .\n\nSo spectacular were the closing months\n\nof Neville Chamberlain's life that the\n\nfact that his entire political career was\n\nspectacular is prone to be overlooked.\n\nFive years after he first entered the\n\nHouse of Commons he was Chancellor\n\nof the Exchequer—an almost unparalleled\n\nadvance.\n\nA second son of the famous Joseph\n\nChamberlain, and half-brother of the\n\npicturesque Sir Austen, Neville Chamber-\n\nlain — or Arthur Neville Chamberlain, to\n\ngive him his full name — apparently\n\nbegan adult life without a thought of\n\nthe political career which most of the\n\nmale members of his family regarded as\n\nthe only possible career. Born at Birm-\n\ningham on March 18, 1869, he was edu-\n\ncated at Rugby and Mason College,\n\nBirmingham, and when his education\n\nwas complete went into business. For\n\nmany years he lived in the Bahamas, but\n\nreturned to England some time before\n\nthe last war.\n\nHis first step into public life was as a\n\nhumble Birmingham councillor. Pres-\n\nently, however, he was an alderman, to\n\nbecome, in 1915, Lord Mayor. His work\n\nIn this position brought him to the notice\n\nof the Government, and in the following\n\nyear he was made Director-General of\n\nNational Service, a post which he held\n\nuntil 1917.\n\nIn 1918 the way was smoothed for him\n\nto enter the Commons as a Conservative,\n\nin the family tradition. Once in, how-\n\never, his hitherto rapid advancement\n\nseemed to receive a check. He remained\n\nan inconspicuous member of the back\n\nbenches for four years. People referred\n\nto him as \"the other Chamberlain,\" and\n\nlooked on him as \"just a super town\n\nclerk.\" He was a disappointment as a\n\nChamberlain. He lacked the grace, the\n\ncharm, the grandeur of style, the orchid,\n\nand monocle of his father, Joseph\n\n—dead before he entered the House—\n\nqualities bequeathed in toto to his half-\n\nbrother, Austen. Nor had he the \"com-\n\nmon touch\" which so often makes a suc-\n\ncessful politician.\n\nHe became slowly known, however, as\n\na financial authority, and with the break-\n\nup of the Lloyd George Coalition Go-\n\nvernment, he became Postmaster-\n\nGeneral, and, a year later, Paymaster-\n\nGeneral. Here his financial knowledge\n\nwas again noticed, and in 1923 he was\n\nmade Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nBefore he was able to introduce a\n\nBudget the Conservative Government fell.\n\nThe Labour Government which succeeded\n\nit was defeated towards the end of 1924,\n\nand Chamberlain was expected to resume\n\nthe Chancellorship, but instead he be-\n\ncame Minister for Health, a post which\n\nhe held until 1929, when the Baldwin\n\nGovernment went down to defeat, and\n\nLabour again took the reins.\n\nIn the ensuing years Neville Chamber-\n\nlain was noticed mainly because of his\n\nbitter clashes with Philip Snowden,\n\nLabour Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nWhen the first National Government was\n\nformed Chamberlain held his old post as\n\nMinister for Health until the Govern-\n\nment was confirmed in office by the\n\ngeneral election of 1931, when he re-\n\nplaced Snowden, under whose Budget a\n\nsection of Britain was literally groaning.\n\nThe gold standard had been left behind,\n\nand the country's finances needed careful\n\nhandling. From Chamberlain they got\n\nit. The most orthodox of orthodox finan-\n\nciers, he allayed alarm, and within two\n\nyears was able to modify Snowden's\n\n\"crisis Budget\" and reduce taxation. Yet,\n\nwhen the rearmament of Britain began\n\nin 1936 he did not hesitate to increase\n\ntaxes.\n\nIn the following year, when Lord Bald-\n\nwin (then Mr.) decided to retire, Neville\n\nChamberlain was the obvious choice as\n\nhis successor. He stepped down from\n\nthe Prime Minlstership to make way for\n\nMr. Winston Churchill and a National\n\nGovernment when news reached Britain\n\nof Hitler's invasion of the Lowlands.\n\nShortly afterward he underwent a sur-\n\ngical operation. On leaving hospital he\n\nwent to the country, and at first his health\n\nseemed to improve, but later his condition\n\nbecame weaker and caused his family and\n\nfriends grave anxiety. He did not appear\n\nagain in the House of Commons."
