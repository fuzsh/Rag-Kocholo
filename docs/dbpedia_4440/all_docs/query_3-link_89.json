The Commercial & Financial Chronicle, having long suffered from inadequate facilities for handling its growing size and growing subscription list, has moved into new and larger quarters, and is now located at William Street, Corner Spruce New York City. P. 0. Box 968, City Hall Statio... The Financial Situation. The inability of Great Britain to retain its stock of gold, in the face of conditions of the money mar kets, at home and abroad, which in former periods always sufficed for the purpose, continues an uppermost topic of discussion. And from the remarks of Philip Snowden, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, it is evident that this is a matter of deep concern in British Government circles, though from this week's speech of Mr. Snowden in the House of Commons it is also plain that the British budget, with the probabilities of a large deficit at the end of the fiscal year, is giving the MacDonald Government no less concern, and perhaps the two events are not entirely disconnected. As between New York and London, money market conditions are certainly as favorable as would well be wished. The rediscount rate of the New York Fed0 eral Reserve Bank is down to 27, while the Bank of England rate is being maintained at 37, and there 0 has recently been talk that the latter might go still higher in the near future. Not only that, but the buying rate for bankers' acceptances of the Federal Reserve Bank for bills of all maturities running up NO. 3425. to 45 days is only 11 27 while open market rates for , / 0 bankers' acceptances with maturities up to 90 days are at the unprecedentedlylow figure of1%70 bid and 1%7 asked. As against these abnormally low rates 0 at New York, rates in London for both long and short bills are fully 1% higher at 21 2@2 9/16%. / Yet in face of such favorable and persistently favoring conditions, rates for sterling exchange have the present week, following the recent period of strength, displayed renewed weakness, and despite all efforts to prevent it, sterling keeps hovering close to the point where imports of gold could be made were there any disposition here to encourage such a movement. New York is constantly being told that the United States has too much gold, and that France likewise has an excess of the metal, while London has barely sufficient for its needs, and that we could well spare some of our supply for the benefit of London. Mr. Snowden has recently reported that the United States has a larger stock of gold than Great Britain. France, Germany and Spain combined. In this statement Mr. Snowden puts the gold stock of the United Kingdom at £144,543,000, which is only a little larger than the bullion reported held by the Bank of England in its return for Jan.21 (Mr. Snowden made his statement on Jan. 26), which was given as £142,868,766, from which it would appear that Mr. Snowden is inclined to think that no gold remains in circulation in the United Kingdom which may well be doubted. This very week Mr. Snowden has again referred to the large accumulations of the metal in the United States, saying that this country added $309,000,000 to its gold holdings during 1930. The point of all this is the implication which it conveys that this country is gaining gold at the expense of Great Britain, and is somehow to blame for this, though just how no one has undertaken to say. But admitting that the United States has had large accessions to its gold supplies, has Great Britain made no additions to its stock of the metal in recent years? The answer to this question must be, that it has. If the holdings of the Bank of England may be taken as a guide, it has enlarged its stock of the metal since the war considerably over £100,000,000, or, in American money, roughly, $500,-000,000, which is obviously no inconsiderable item. Before the war it was considered sufficient for the Bank of England to hold a total of E40,000,000 gold and the Bank was regarded as being in excellent condition when it could show that amount of the metal on hand. Nor was any anxiety felt when the amount fell, as it often did, 0,000,000 to £4,000,000 below that figure. Now, on the other hand, it is the view that in accord with the suggestions of the Cunliffe Commit- 1080 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE tee, the aim should be to maintain at all times a minimum of £150,400,000 of the metal, and genuine -anxiety is manifested when the aggregate of the 'coin and bullion holdings fall below the total named. The last two weeks the Bank of England was able somewhat to re-enforce its depleted reserves after successive heavy losses in preceding weeks, but it is still considerably below the £150,000,000 assumed minimum,its return for Thursday of this week showing the amount of the metal held as being £141,247,159. But why is £150,000,000 coin and bullion now required when before the war £40,000,000 was deemed more than sufficient? The reason is that by reason of the amalgamation of the so-called fiduciary currency with Bank of England notes the total amount of notes outstanding has been enormously increased, that consequently a greater stock of the metal is needed to provide the proper reserve against the larger amount of note issues outstanding. One has only to examine one of the comparative weekly returns published by us every week in this article, and covering a period of five years, to see what an enormous change has been wrought through the absorption of the fiduciary currency as a part of its pirculation by the Bank of England. Turning to this week's return of the Bank of England, given on page 1090 of this publication, it is found that the total of circulation the present week is £347,244,000, and that this compares with no more than *134,281,815 only three years ago, on Feb. 15 1928. Here, then, we find an addition of £213,000,000, or in excess of ppopo,Goo. Obviously, with the circulatory notes larger in the huge amount mentioned, gold reserve must be correspondingly strengthened. But have we not here a prime element of weakness? Have we not in the great expansion of the Bank of England note issues a reason why the Bank e,has lost control of the gold currents—why it is no longer able to make its discount rate effective in preventing a drain of the metal. When the note issue was of only moderate proportions—before the war ,the total of the circulation did not run much above 09,000,000, that having been the amount at the beginning of 1914—the Bank had merely to raise its .discount rate in proper measure and then not only would the,drain on the Bank's gold stock be arrested, but the gold currents would be completely reversed and gold would flow into the Bank's vaults from all parts of the world. Now when the Bank rate is raised, with the same end in view, there is little or no response. That was conspicuously shown during the long period of our stock market speculation, which culminated in the autumn of 1929, when successive advances in the Bank of England's rate 2 1 / finally brought the rate up to 6 % in September 1929 and is now again being shown with the conditions completely reversed, that is in a period of great ease, instead of a period of monetary • stringency. What is the remedy? Would it not be a good idea to contract the volume of the circulation by paying some of the gold now held, back into circulation. In other words, would not the Bank's position be improved if the volume of its circulation were in some degree reduced. In that event would it not be possible for the Bank to regain the hold it formerly had over the gold currents, giving it once more the commanding position it formerly held and which it ex- - [VoL. 182. ercised with such beneficial effects, not only upon British trade and commerce, but upon the trade and commerce of the entire world? Would it not then be restored to the position of independence it formerly held, instead of being a suppliant at the doors of other central banks. The question would appear to be pertinent in view of the multifareous plans that are being pressed upon public attention for a redistribution of the gold supplies of the world. The general idea seems to be to use the Bank for International Settlements for that purpose, and we hear much about making transfers by book entries instead of by movements of the metal. The idea, however, embodies an illusion. A change of ownership must precede transfers of the metal by book entries. When that is borne in mind it quickly becomes apparent that while transfers by book entries may be helpful in promoting efficiency and economy, they leave the problem of the redistribution of the world's gold supplies still unsolved. The fallacy that the Bank for International Settlements can by resort to the use of book entries correct the maladjustment was neatly punctured in an editorial article which appeared in the New York \"Times\" on Jan. 15, and which we reprinted in our issue of Jan. 17, page 370. The occasion for the article was the appearance of the report on \"Distribution of Gold\" made to the League of Nations by its financial delegation. We reproduce here the pertinent portions of the article: \"A seemingly prevalent idea has been that if, through the International Bank or some other agency, a 'gold settlement fund' were to be set up for the world at large, similar to that of our Federal Reserve, awkward loss of gold by a given central bank would cease. \"Undoubtedly, by merely crediting or debiting each bank of issue with that part of the central gold fund to which current transactions should entitle it, the costs of gold shipment, insurance and loss of interest might in large measure be eliminated. But that would in no respect improve the position of a central bank whose credit in the 'gold settlement fund' was progressively drawn down. The scheme has no such result in the case of our Federal Reserve. In February 1920, although the System as a whole held more than the statutory minimum of reserve against its deposits and note issues, the New York Reserve Bank's share in the 'settlement fund' was so far reduced as to bring its 'reserve ratio' below 36%, and to necessitate rediscount of its own collateral holdings with other Reserve Banks. \"Similar failure to recognize realities has pervaded discussion of the recent 'drain of gold' from the Bank of England to the Bank of France.\" Some of the indirect effects of the policy of abnormal ease in the money market promoted by the Federal Reserve Banks are seen in the developments of the past week. The New York Clearing House banks have further reduced the rate of interest allowed on certain classes of deposits, and the Secretary of the Treasury has still further reduCed the rate of interest which the depository banks are obliged to pay on Government deposits representing the proceeds of sales of Treasury certificates of indebtedness. On Friday of last week the New York Clearing House Association announced that the interest rate on certificates of deposit and on time deposits for 30 days in New York Clearing House banks had been reduced 2 1 / from 2% to 1 %, effective Monday, Feb. 9. On Wednesday of this week the informal committee of bankers that regulates interest rates paid by local FEB. 14 19311 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE banks on foreign deposits voted to reduce the rate on demand deposits of foreign central banks, Governments, and other foreign depositors from 1 % / 1 2 to 1%, bringing this rate into conformity with the Clearing House rates on domestic demand deposits. The rate on foreign time deposits was continued at 2%. It may be recalled that on Jan. 10 the rates on foreign deposits were reduced to 112% in the case / of demand deposits, and from 212% to 2% in the / case of time deposits. As to United States Government deposits, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Mellon, gave notice on Feb. 9 that, effective as of Feb. 16, depository banks would be required to pay interest of only 1% per annum. It will be remembered that on Nov. 26 1930 a circular came from the Treasury Department at Washington stating that beginning Dec. 1 the interest required to be paid on such deposits would be only 12 per annum against the previous 2%. / 1 % Thus in the short space of 11 weeks the interest on these deposits has been cut exactly in two, the first reduction having been from 2% to 1 %, and the / 1 2 second, now just made and to become effective next / 1 % Monday,from 12 to 1%. The matter is important in its bearing on the sale of Treasury certificates of indebtedness or other obligations to be made at the quarterly financing of the Treasury next month. As has been pointed out many times in these columns, it is the practice of the Treasury Department to allow the proceeds of the sales of Treasury certificates to remain on deposit with the banks through whom or on behalf of which the subscriptions are made, and to draw these Government deposits down only as needed from time to time. On such deposits, however, the depository banks are obliged to pay interest to the Governmentfor the time during which the deposits are retained. These deposits are often of large amount and the banks are allowed to retain them for long periods. At the certificate sale last Dec. 9, when the allotments aggregated $428,322,000, the Government deposits growing out of the same reached $309,972,400, of which $79,291,900 was held by the banks in the New York Federal Reserve District. At the present time, $109,825,900 of these deposits are still held by the depository banks, of which $27,897,100 are held by banks in the New York Federal Reserve District. Such Government deposits are always desirable because the banks holding them are not required to carry any reserves against them; and where the banks subscribe for the certificates on their own account they stand to gain the difference between the rate of interest borne by the certificates and the rate of interest they are required to pay the Government on the deposits growing out of the sale. Where the banks subscribe for the certificates on behalf of their patrons, and the Government deposits stay with them, they make the difference between what they pay the Government on the deposits and the rate they can obtain by loaning out the deposits. As rates of interest for all classes of loans are exceedingly low, it was imperative for the Secretary to reduce the interest required to be paid on these Government deposits, and the rate had to be fixed very low in order to leave any margin of profit at all in either case. It is thought, however, that the Secretary of the Treasury in making the sale next month will correspondingly lower the rate of interest in the certificates to be offered by subscription. At the sale of certificates in December, 1 2 when a reduction of/of 1% was made in the interest on the deposits, he reduced the rate on the cer/ tificates running for a year to 178%, which was just /of 1% less than the 2%% interest earried by the 1 2 certificates sold the previous September, and he cut 4%, the rate on certificates running six months to 13 a reduction in that case of % of 1%, as compared 0 with the 2%7 interest borne by the certificates put out at the sale the previous September. It is supposed that somewhat similar action will be taken in the offering of certificates to be made next month —in other words, that the rate in the certificates will be further lowered / of 1%. In this way the 1 2 loss sustained through the lower interest on the Government's deposits will be offset. Nothing, however, has yet transpired as to the Secretary's intentions in that respect. The Treasury Department has also the present week disposed of a new issue of Treasury bills offered on a discount basis, this sale following close upon the heels of the sale of $60,000,000 of these bills last month (Jan. 30). The sale on Jan. 30 consisted of 90-day Treasury bills, and as these bills are free from all forms of taxes, they being exempt from the surtaxes as well as the normal taxes, and the profits from any resale of the certificates being likewise exempt from taxation, and the money market being in a state of extreme ease as far as short-term funds are concerned, the Secretary of the Treasury was able to dispose of them on extremely favorable terms, the average rate on a discount basis was only 0.95% per annum. In this week's sale the Secretary invited subscriptions for a total of $150,000,000. They were 91-day bills, dated Feb. 16 1931, and maturing on May 18 1931. Tenders were received to an aggregate of $346,532,000, out of which the Secretary made allotments of $154,218,000. The price obtained was somewhat less favorable than the extraordinarily low figure realized at the sale on Jan. 30. For a change, this week's statement of brokers' loans by the reporting member banks in the New York Federal Reserve District shows an increase, varying the monotony of the long-continued record of decreases, reported week after week. The increase is only $33,000,000, and it possesses no significance, in view of the huge preceding contraction, except perhaps in showing that with a revival of stock market speculation, such as has been palpably in evidence during the current week, the fact finds immediate reflection in the growth of the total of brokers' loans. How unimportant this week's increase is will appear when we say that it follows no less than $1,506,000,000 shrinkage in the amouut of these loans in the 19 weeks preceding, during the whole of which period the reduction was uninterrupted with the exception of one single week in which a small increase occurred. After this week's increase of $33,000,000, the aggregate of these loans still stands no higher than $1,749,000,000, at which figure the comparison is with $3,222,000,000 on Sept. 24 1930, and with $6,804,000,000 on Oct. 2 1929, when these loans were at their maximum. The changes in this week's statement of the Reserve Banks appear also to be devoid of any great significance. Member bank borrowing, as indicated by the discount'holdings of the 12 Reserve institutions, stands at virtually the same figure as a week ago, the amount for Feb. 11 being $222,189,000 as against $222,917,000 on Feb. 4, which was the date of 1082 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE last week's return. Holdings of United States Government securities also remain at nearly the same figure as a week ago, the amount this week being ;609,620,000 as compared with $609,511,000 last week. In the holdings of acceptances alone does any change of consequence appear, the 12 Reserve institutions reporting a total of such acceptances this week of only $87,739,000, while the amount a week ago was f104,275,000. With such an active demand in the market for acceptances as now exists acceptance dealers do not have to have recourse to the facilities of the Reserve institutions in order to dispose of their bills, and as old bills are constantly running off a decline in the holdings of the Reserve banks followed as a matter of course. The present week's decrease in these holdings of acceptances comes after still larger reductions in previous weeks, and this week's total of the same at $87,739,000 compares with no less than $363,844,000 on Dec. 31 1930, the close of the old year. As a result of the changes noted, total bill and security holdings this week are slightly lower,$919,548,000 against $936,703,000 last week. Federal Reserve note circulation during the past week increased from $1,476,742,000 to $1,481,006,000, while gold reserves are slightly higher at 3,077,491,000 as compared with $3,076,412,000 a week ago. The insolvency record for January is quite unusual in some important respects. In the first place the number of failures for that month and the indebtedness shown are extremely high. Next in importance is the fact that a detailed analysis of the report, shows that the increase, in quite a marked degree, is due to the unusually heavy mortality among many small trading concerns. That this was the case in the opening month of a new year has special significance. According to the records of R. G. Dun & Co., there were 3,316 commercial failures in the United States in the month just closed, involving $94,608,212 of liabilities. In December the number of similar defaults was 2,525 for $83,683,361 and in January of last year it was 2,759 owing $61,185,171. The increase in the number for the opening month of this year over December was 31.3% and over January of last year 20.2%. In January 1930, commercial insolvencies in the United States exceeded those of the preceding month by 35.4%. For both years, the opening month was a period of great stress, and a large increase in insolvencies was to be expected. During the entire year of 1930, there was considerable adverse pressure, which caused a heavy mortality and this was continued right up to the end of the year. This condition was conspicuously absent in the greater part of 1929, even in the closing month of that year, so far as mercantile defaults were concerned, notwithstanding the fact that in November 1929, a serious situation in the financial markets caused grave fore• bodings. In January 1930 there was a marked increase in commercial insolvencies, which is reflected in the relatively larger increase for that month over December. The unusually large indebtedness reported for the month just closed, was occasioned by some very heavy defaults, one receivership, that of a big Eastern manufacturing company, accounting for more than one-quarter of the entire amount of liabilities for January. The growth in the number of failures for January o: this year was wholly in the trading class. The [VOL. 132. latter numbered last month 2,541, against 1,913 in January 1930 and involved $43,070,912 of indebtedness this year, and $29,813,921 for that month a year ago. Defaults in manufacturing lines for the month just closed were 611 compared with 680 last year, with liabilities of $47,632,817 this year and $19,499,985 a year ago. More than one-half of the total indebtedness shown for the manufacturing division in Januaryof this year wasfor the singlelarge manufacturing defaultabove referred to. As to agents and brokers, there were no unusually large failures last month, and both in number and liabilities there was a reduction from a year ago; the number this year was 164 against 166 last year, while the indebtedness of $3,904,483 last month compares with $11,871,265 a year ago. Separating the trading defaults by lines of business only 3 of the 14 sub-divisions, show a decrease in the number of trading insolvencies from January of last year. They include hotels and restaurants, furs, hats and gloves, and paints and oils. The reduction for each of these three classifications was small. On the other hand, there is quite an increase for the other trading divisions. The largest is for clothing, and for this section liabilities are quite heavy. A considerable increase last month also appears for general stores; dealers in dry goods; shoes and leather goods;furniture; hardware; drugs;jewelry; and books, stationery and papers. For groceries and meats there was a small gain. There was also a large hotel default, while liabilities for general stores; dealers in dry goods, and dealers in furniture were in excess of those of a year ago. As to the manufacturing section 5 of the 14 separate classifications show fewer defaults for the month just closed than a year ago, among them the lumber class and the divisions embracing bakeries. Small reductions also appear for the chemical section, and for manufacturers of shoes and leather goods. For the iron division; machinery and tools; woolen goods; manufacturers of clothing; furs, hats and gloves; and for printing and engraving, the number of defaults last month were somewhat larger than those of a year ago. Liabilities for the different sections of the manufacturing division were not unusually heavy except for the section including machinery and tools, in which the very large failure which occurred last month, appears. The lumber division,,and that covering earthenware and brick, ,also report a considerable indebtedness for January. It has been a time of rising prices on the Stock Exchange the present week, though interrupted by some reaction at the end of the week. A spirit of great enthusiasm has prevailed, and the market has been positively buoyant most of the time. There have been really no developments of great moment to account for the rise, which reached large proportions, nor for the great increase in activity, transactions being on a larger scale than for many weeks past and the activity being well maintained day after day except that on Friday transactions were on a diminished scale. There is, however, growing confidence in the business world of better times in the early future, and there have been quite a few incidents of a minor kind to support this view. A further increase has occurred in the operations of the steel mills of the country, these being engaged now to 50% of capacity as against 48% the previous week. Then, also, much was made of the fact that the unfilled orders on the books of the U. S. Steel Corp. showed a further increase during the month FEB. 14 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 1083 1 8; of January of 188,755 tons, this being the fourth J. I.

FEB. 14 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE Fears of political complications caused liquidation in speculative circles and stocks dropped from two to seven points. Liquidation attained a greater scope in Thursday's session, and prices again declined. Professional circles sold heavily and added to the decline. Uneasiness regarding the political developments was increased, and stocks fell three to nine points, dispatches said. The downward trend was resumed in yesterday's dealings at Berlin. Expansion of long-term credits and foreign landing by the New York and Paris capital markets was urged by Gates W. McGarrah Thursday in an address beforethe American Club atParis, as a vital necessity to offset the present world-wide business depression. The address was the first public utterance of the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since he became President of the Bank for International Settlements nine months ago. Wider international credits would have a beneficial effect, not only on the trade and industrial position, but also on the political affairs of the world,he said. The B. I. S., which was set up primarily to handle German reparations transfers, was discussed at some length by Mr. McGarrah, who said that the bank's \"field of operations is broad,\" and that the institution \"will expand because of the actual needs which have made themselves manifest.\" He explained that the B. I. S. has itself taken steps for improving the international siutation by placing $25,000,000 of its funds in intermediate credits of six months to two years. \"In fact,\" he said, \"of our total investments at the end of the last calendar year about 25% was placed in the German market. The Reich's special need is for long-term credits. Consequently, of our investments for six months or more, upward of 95% have been made within Germany.\" French and American financiers were asked particularly by the President of the B. I. S. to engage in long-term credit operations of international scope. \"It is upon Paris and upon New York, owing to special conditions now prevailing at London, that the opportunity and the obligation fall to help themselves by helding others through making long-term investments,\" he declared. There are two great needs of the moment, he remarked. \"First, is encouragement of the transfer of capital from the short-term money market, where it is so plentiful that it is practically impossible to invest even at low rates, over into the intermediate credit market, where the supply is woefully inadequate. The second need is the reopening of the great capital markets like that in the city of Paris to foreign financing, especially on the intermediate and longterm sides. . . . I hope that there may be such reestablishment of confidence in America that our own country,like France, may continue to play the necessary economic role of every creditor country; that is to say, that of being a supplier of funds to sound foreign borrowers. Under the present economic conditions the pressing requirement of the movement to ameliorate world trade and business is the active expansion of long-term credits in foreign lending which, in turn, demands political tranquillity and stability, both national and international, in order to become practically possible.\" 1085 was announced in Washington, Tuesday, and an embargo was promptly placed on related imports in accordance with the provisions of the Tariff Act. This decision was announced by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon on the basis of evidence presented to the Department. In effect, the ruling bars importations of lumber and pulpwood from the four districts unless the importer is able to prove that only free labor has entered into their production and transportation. Districts involved in the findings are the Kola peninsula, including the Murman Coast; the Karelian, northern and Zyryan autonomous areas. These regions take in all of European Russia north of the sixtieth degree of latitude. Officials of the Treasury count upon a test of the ruling in the Federal Courts, a Washington dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said. The authority of the Treasury to require importers to prove the use of free labor only will be questioned in such litigation, and there is a possibility that the burden of proof would be transferred back to the Treasury. Officials declined to make public the evidence • upon which the finding was based. It will have no immediate effect in excluding Soviet lumber and pulpwood, since the ports from which such products usually come are now icebound. The decision, however, may be of great importance in the general question of Soviet-American trade, since the Soviet has announced its intention to cease trading with countries that restrict purchases of its goods. Trade between the United States and Soviet Russia amounted to about $145,000,000 last year, according to Washington reports. American goods exported to Russia amounted to $120,000,000, while imports of Soviet merchandise were $25,000,000. That the application of this section of the Tariff Act in the fashion adopted by the Treasury brings up the gravest implications was indicated by hearings in Washington on a plea by producers of tobacco in this country for exclusion of Sumatra tobacco, on allegations that it is produced by forced or indentured labor. Rigorous application of the method by the Treasury might mean the exclusion of a wide variety of products from many countries. A hint of further action in connection with other products is contained, a dispatch of Wednesday to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" indicated, in official statements that the State Department had directed consuls throughout the world to report on whatever goods might be produced for export by convict, forced, or indentured labor within the territory to which the consuls are assigned. Further attempts to find a basis for a naval agreement between France and Italy were started in Paris, Tuesday, by R. L. Craigie of the British Foreign Office and Rene Massigli, naval expert of the French Foreign Office. Mr. Craigie engaged in an attempt of this nature late last year after Hugh S. Gibson, American Ambassador to Belgium, had discussed the same problem in visits to Paris and Rome. The renewed British attempt to work out a formula of agreement whereunder France and Italy could participate fully in the London naval treaty of 1930 follows an intimation in the British House of Commons, given by First Lord of the Admiralty A. V. Alexander, Feb. 4, that the British Government may A formal finding by the U.S.Treasury Department have to \"reconsider the position\" if the efforts to that convict labor is used in the production of lum- persuade France and Italy to reduce their naval conber and pulpwood in four areas of northern Russia struction programs are unsuccessful. Mr. Craigie's 1086 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE presence in Paris on his mission was disclosed Tuesday, but the Quai d'Orsay made no official announcement of the matter under discussion. The discussions between the British and French experts are believed to relate, however, to the French intention to proceed at once with construction of 42,000 tons of warships held up pending the outcome of the desultory attempts to adjust the Franco-Italian differences. Italy, it will be recalled, demanded theoretical naval parity with France at the London conference a year ago, but this the French negotiators would not concede, claiming that French colonial communications and the double coastline of the country on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean necessitated a superior navy. Italy has several times indicated in no uncertain terms its intention of building \"ton for ton and gun for gun\" with France, and the matter now threatens to make advisable on the part of Britain an increase in naval construction that would upset the London treaty bases. This could be done by application of the \"escalator clause,\" inserted in the treaty for such contingencies. Grave statements on British Government finances and on the burden of the British war debt were made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden, Wednesday, in the course of an acrid debate in the House of Commons on a Conservative party motion of censure. The Labor Government Chancellor made his first reference to the forthcoming budget, to be presented in April, when he informed the Parliament that IR view of the severe economic depression \"vast and disagreeable measures\" must be taken to maintain budgetary equilibrium and restore industry. In a savage allusion to British war debts, Mr. Snowden was assumed by correspondents of American newspapers to have referred to the debt settlement with the United States, but his remarks appear to have been more general. We have the burden of the war debts,\" said Mr. Snowden in his discussion of British finances. \"I don't want to give offense to anybody when I make this statement, that when the history of the way in which that debt was incurred—its recklessness, its extravagance and its commitments made, which were altogether unnecessary at the time—when all that comes to be known, I am afraid posterity will curse those who were responsible.\" The Conservative resolution which precipitated the debate stated that Parliament had lost confidence in the Government of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald because of its extravagance at a time when economy is urgently needed. In the division which followed, the Labor regime was upheld by a vote of 310 to 235, with most of the Liberals voting with the Laborites. A Liberal motion calling for the appointment of a committee to devise economies in public expenditures was promptly adopted thereafter by a vote of 457 to 21. The question of the international war debts and reparations settlements, so prominent in private discussions at the moment, was brought up in the House of Commons last Monday. Lieut.-Commander J. M. Kenworthy, a Labor member, asked the Prime Minister \"whether in view of the present world economic situation any proposals are under consideration by the Government for summoning an international round table conference on the subject of inteTallied debts and reparations.\" Prime Minister (Vex, )82. MacDonald replied simply, \"The answer is in the negative.\" Argument on the motion of censure, Wednesday, was opened by Conservative members, who based their charges of extravagance mainly on the huge current outlay in Britain for unemployment insurance. Mr. Snowden retorted in familiar vein, a London dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, pointing out that taxes had to be increased V00,000,000 a year owing to the budgetary procedure of his Conservative predecessor, Winston Churchill He warned the House that balancing of the budget will require drastic economies, and he urged a \"temporary suspension\" of those socialistic principles of betterment of the masses for which he had always worked. Further taxation of industry would be disastrous, Mr. Snowden declared, and he added that he would call on all who could afford them for sacrifices. This was interpreted, the \"Times\" dispatch said, as meaning the new budget is going to demand an increase in the rates of income tax and super tax. \"I want to say again,\" the Chancellor continued, \"that it is only on policy where large savings can be made. Let the House of Commons face that. A vast amount of our expenditure is fixed by law, by acts of Parliament, by contracts and by royal warrant. Over £600,000,000 falls in these categories. Parliament alone can deal with these things. Administrative economies in the departments won't help that situation. Nothing the Chancellor of the Exchequer can do will remedy it. With all the seriousness I can command,I say the national position is so grave that drastic and disagreeable measures have to be taken if the budget equilibrium is to be maintained and industrial progress made.\" The seriousness of the British budgetary position was emphasized again and again by the Chancellor, who said it was no secret that there will be a heavy deficit at the end of the financial year. The excessive strain caused by unemployment was such that no budget in the world could stand it, he declared. Adverse factors cited in the address included increase of expenditure and decline of revenue, a fall in productive capacity, and a decline in capital values. \"Despite all this, British credit standing is higher to-day than at any time in the last five years,\" he stated. \"One vulnerable spot in our position is the fact that we are the world's great financial center. If there were well-grounded fears that our budgeting was not sound they might have disastrous consequences with their repercussions abroad. Other countries are watching us and we must maintain our financial position.\" Temporary sacrifices will suffice to solve the present crisis, he said, and in this sacrifice members of the Cabinet are ready to make their contributions. \"It is a crisis which no one party can solve,\" Mr. Snowden asserted. \"But the country as a whole and the entire House of Commons must realize the gravity of the situation. Instead of party bickering, which we can resume later, we must now unite in a common effort to overcome the temporary difficulties and restore prosperity.\" Government memoranda showing details of the unemployment insurance fund payments and distributions were submitted to the members of Parliament Tuesday, and it was partly on the basis of the showing that the attack on the Labor Government resulted. Reduction of the taxpayers' present liability for unemployment relief WAS declared in a FEB. 141931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE Government statement accompanying the memoranda to be one of the most pressing financial needs of Great Britain. Several schemes were suggested for reduction of the rates of benefits paid or for an increase in the premiums paid by workers, but it was remarked in a London report to the New York \"Times\" that even with such devices and assuming a gradual decrease in unemployment to 50% of the present level, it would require five years for the fund to be out of debt. Government contributions to the fund in 1928 were $58,750,000; by 1930 they had increased to $184,850,000, while the estimate for this year is $275,000,000. The huge increases are due chiefly to \"transitional benefits,\" or benefits paid workers who were not qualified by premium payments to receive them but who were, nevertheless, cared for in this fashion. The system is thus robbed of all actuarial safeguards and principles. British unemployment was debated in the House of Commons with vigor Thursday, on the basis of a motion, presented by the Liberal leader, David Lloyd George, calling on the Government to adopt extensive measures to alleviate this evil. The resolution proposed that a policy be formulated for utilizing the services of those out of work in public works projects such as housing improvements,highway construction, reclamation of lands, development of electric and telephone systems and similar national developments. Expenses incurred by such measures should be met, the resolution stated, by inviting subscriptions to public loans from capital sources which now await investment. Much interest was taken generally in the debate on this motion, as it appeared to conflict somewhat with the plea for economy voiced by Chancellor Snowden. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George supported the Liberal motion earnestly. It was pointed out that the motion was not one of censure directed against the Labor Government, but rather an invitation to the Government to accept Liberal aid in solving the unemployment problem. On this basis, Prime Minister MacDonald accepted the motion and declared himself in favor of the plan \"in principle.\" The resolution was then accepted by the House without a division. \"Although nothing really happened to help solve unemployment, there was a great political game in which both sides won, or at least had to pretend they had won,\" a London dispatch to the New York \"Times\" remarked. Lively developments in the German parliamentary situation were reported Tuesday,just one week after the Reichstag reconvened. The National Socialist party, led by Adolph Hitler, which possesses greatly augmented parliamentary strength since the elections last September, paid little attention to the appeal of Chancellor Heinrich Bruening last week for a curb on extremist activities and co-operation with the Government. Motions of non-confidence and for dissolution of the Reichstag were presented by the National Socialists (\"Nazis\") and the Communists last Saturday, but they were defeated by a vote of 293 to 221. This was an indication, Berlin dispatches said, that Chancellor Bruening possesses great personal strength in the German parliament, and it also showed that a majority of the members desired to follow his recommendations. In order to curb the obstructionist tactics of the National Socialists, or Fascists, and make possible the passage of the budget within a reasonable time, measures 1087 were introduced Monday designed to control the demagogic tactics of the Fascists and Communists. These were adopted in a session lasting long after midnight and marked by stormy debate. The reforms, approved by a vote of 300 to 160, provide chiefly that measures involving expenditures must be accompanied by measures providing coverage, and that interpellations must be short and may not include expressions of opinion on the personal character of political opponents. When the Reichstag again met Tuesday afternoon, the Fascists and the Nationalist followers of Dr. Alfred Hugenberg filed out of the Chamber in protest against the parliamentary reforms, proclaiming their intention to boycott the Reichstag for an indefinite period. This move provoked considerable mirth in Germany, but there was also some anxiety when the Nationalist leaders announced that \"a gigantic wave of mass meetings will now sweep over the land.\" The 107 National Socialist deputies left Berlin for their home districts to begin agitating for a national referendum on dissolution of the Reichstag. There was some discussion of a rump parliament to sit at Weimar which would be attended by all Opposition deputies, but this idea was generally discredited. German foreign policy was discussed at length before the Reichstag Tuesday by Foreign Minister Julius Curtius, who declared that Franco-German relations are the cornerstone of European questions. He appealed to France not to close the door on revision of the Versailles treaty, a Berlin dispatch to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said. \"It will be disastrous,\" Dr. Curtius declared, \"not only for future Franco-German relations, but for the destiny of Europe, if beyond the Rhine the facts are not recognized which have led to the present situation in Europe, and if the necessity is not recognized for reform of those conditions which to-day have shown themselves untenable.\" German willingness to cooperate with France in the upbuilding of a European federation was announced by the Foreign Minister, but he added that \"we are not willing that the new Europe shall be built on the foundations of our serious defeat.\" Reparations were referred to in the address as \"the unbidden guest who makes his way into all international conferences,\" raising a problem that will only be settled \"when economic common sense and justice make themselves felt.\" Although Germany has never given any guaranty for the execution of the Young plan, Dr. Curtius said that the Reich would seek revision \"only on the basis of the treaty itself, and only according to the methods of international law.\" He repeated the statement previously made by Chancellor Bruening that the German Government is not going to take any steps in the matter of reparations in the immediate future. Discussion of the address by Foreign Minister Curtius in the Reichstag Thursday resulted in substantial approval by that legislative body of the statements. Communist members introduced a motion calling for immediate cessation of all payments under the Young plan, but the Reichstag rejected the proposal by a vote of 314 to 58. The Peasants' party followed with an appeal for immediate application of the'revisionary clauses of the plan, but this was voted down by a count of 247 to 124. The Reichstag proceeded, however, to approve a resolution proclaiming the need for early revision of the repara- 1088 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE tions settlements, while a second resolution demanding the formation of an impartial commission to study the origins of the world war also was accepted. Both resolutions, a Berlin report to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said, express feelings that are well-nigh unanimous in Germany, regardless of party. They are, nevertheless, essentially only a demonstration and do not in any way bind the hands of Chancellor Bruening or his Government. With the publication of a decree signed by King Alfonso, Constitutional guarantees were restored to Spanish subjects last Sunday after more than seven years of dictatorship. Constitutional Government and Parliamentary elections were suspended by the late General Primo de Rivera on Sept. 23 1923. The proclamation published last Sunday also contained the formal call of elections for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, voting for these two houses to take place, respectively, on Mar. 1 and 15. The decree contained nothing unforeseen or sensational, a Madrid dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, and is a mere abbreviated resume of proposals made when General Damaso Berenguer was named Premier. The Government, according to the document, has done everything possible to guarantee honest elections and the full support of the nation in the plebiscite is urged. King Alfonso, it is added, will preside at the opening of the new Parliament on Mar. 25. Publication of the decree took place in the official newspaper \"Gaceta,\" and it became immediately effective. It was noted in Madrid reports that a strike of commercial printers during the two preceding weeks had hampered publication of the \"Gaceta,\" and that military aid had been required in printing it. Restoration of Constitutional guarantees meant that the censorship was lifted, and Spanish journals promptly began to print the news of past months which had been suppressed by the Government. Reports of the recent rebellion in Spain were thus given the Spanish people for the first time early this week. An interesting development Tuesday was a decision by the Madrid City Council to ask Premier Berenguer for a political amnesty to be extended to prisoners held in connection with the rebellion at Jaca. Republican enthusiasm mounted early this week when former Premier Santiago Alba issued a manifesto from his Paris retreat stating that he will abstain from the March elections and adding that a Constitutional convention, with King Alfonso taking a vacation from the throne, is the only means of settling the troubled political situation. Republican meetings were quickly organized in all important centers, and the wave of excitement and agitation was said to be causing much concern to the authorities. In one of his most extended pronouncements on American foreign policy, Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson explained and upheld on Feb. 6 the attitude recently taken by the United iStates State Government toward the republics of Latin America. The address, delivered in this city before the Council on Foreign Relations, dealt chiefly with the speedy recognition by the United States of the numerous revolutionary regimes set up in Latin America after short rebellions. Mr. Stimson sought, especially, to disarm the criticism that has been aroused by the decisions of the State Department. There have been, [Vol,. 132. he pointed out, no less than seven revolutions in Latin American States since March 1929, and in six instances governments were forcibly overthrown. The State Department was faced, in consequence, by a rapid succession of difficult problems for decision, he said, and in this situation he held that criticism of the State Department is inevitable. A brief statement of the \"facts, as well as of the underlying principles and reasons upon which some of these recent decisions have been based\" was accordingly essayed by the Secretary of State, who added that he would discuss in particular the recognition of the new governments and the regulations of the sale and transportation of arms and munitions to the countries which have been involved in strife. The general policy of the United States toward the republics to the south during the past hundred years was briefly reviewed by Mr. Stimson, who declared that, in its general conception the policy has been a noble one, notwithstanding \"occasional dark spots which have been charged to that record, particularly 75 or 80 years ago.\" Recognition of the equal rights and national independence of such nations has always been the basic policy of the United States, he insisted. Turning specifically to the question of recognition of a new government within a State, Mr. Stimson called attention to the uniformity of practice from the days of Secretary of State Jefferson in 1792 to those of Secretary of State Bryan in 1913. The\"non-recognition policy\" of the Wilson Administration, as applied in the case of the Huerta Government of Mexico, was sharply criticized as a radical departure from such standards. \"In his sympathy for the development of free constitutional institutions among the people of our Latin American neighbors, Mr. Wilson did not differ from the.feelings of the great mass of his countrymen,\" Mr. Stimson declared, \"but he differed from the practice of his predecessors in seeking actively to propagate these institutions in a foreign country by the direct influence of this Government and to do this against the desires of the authorities and people of Mexico.\" The present Administration, Secretary of State Stimson continued, has reverted to the former practice of this Government. Recognition by the United States was speedily accorded new regimes in Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Panama, he said, when diplomatic representatives in those countries reported that the new governments were in control of the administrative machinery of the State, with the apparent general acquiescence of their people, and that they were willing and apparently able to discharge their international and conventional obligations. \"And, in view of the economic depression, with the consequent need for prompt measures of financial stabilization, we did this with as little delay as possible in order to give those sorely pressed countries the quickest possible opportunities for recovering their economic poise,\" Mr. Stimson asserted. Although this policy has been followed in all cases where international practice was not affected or controlled by pre-existing treaty, a different situation exists with regard to the five Central American republics of Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, it was pointed out. After much strife, these five republics agreed among themselves in 1907 that governments will not be recognized among them if they come into power as a consequence of a coup d'etat or a revolution. The principle was re-enacted in 1923, and in that PEn. 14 19311 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE year also Secretary or State Hughes announced that in its dealings with the five republics the United States would adhere to the same principle. \"Since the adoption by Secretary Hughes,in 1923, of the policy of recognition agreed upon by the five republics in their convention, not one single revolutionary government has been able to maintain itself in those five republics,\" Mr. Stimson said. \"Twice, once in Nicaragua and once in the case of Guatemala, a revolutionary leader has succeeded in grasping the reins of government for a brief period. But in each case the failure to obtain recognition has resulted in his prompt resignation, on account of his inability to borrow money in the international markets. Several times within the same period a contemplated revolution has been abandoned by its conspirators on the simple reminder by a Minister from this country or one of the other republics, that even if they were successful, their government would not be recognized, and undoubtedly in many more cases has the knowledge of the existence of the policy prevented even the preparation for a revolution or a coup d'etat. In every one of these cases the other four republics have made common cause in the efforts of the United States to carry out their policy and maintain stability. When one compares this record with the blood-stained history of Central America before the adoption of the treaty in 1923, I think that no impartial student can avoid the conclusion that the treaty and the policy which it has established in that locality has been productive of very great good. Of course, it is a departure from the regular international practice of our Government, and it undoubtedly contains possible difficulties and dangers of application which we in the State Department are the last to minimize and in case of which, should they arise, this Government must reserve its freedom of action.\" The policy of the United States with respect to the export of arms and munitions to countries engaged in civil strife was next taken up by Mr. Stimson, who remarked that there have been two occasions during the present Administration when important decisions and actions had to be considered. The first was in March 1929, when a military insurrection broke out in Mexico. An embargo on the exportation of arms and munitions which might reach the rebels was then maintained, while this Government itself sold arms and supplies to the established Government of Mexico. This action contributed in no slight degree, Mr. Stimson said, toward suppression of the insurrection within about three months. The second occasion was in October 1930, when armed insurrection against the Brazilian Government was followed by the same course of action on the part of the United States which had previously been pursued toward Mexico. The Brazilian Government fell, however, within two days of the placing of an embargo on exports to rebellious forces. In reply to the criticisms of United States policy which followed the success of the rebels, Mr. Stimson remarked that the embargo was a legal requirement under the terms of a treaty between the United States and Brazil executed at Havana, Feb. 20 1928. \"Until belligerency is recognized and the duty of neutrality arises, all the humane predispositions toward stability of government, the preservation of international amity, and the protection of established intercourse between nations are in favor of the existing government,\" Mr. Stimson said. 1089 Comment in Latin American countries on these declarations by the American Secretary of State were sparse, although the address was reprinted in full in all capitals. Leading Argentine newspapers described the speech as evidence that the United States is awakening at last to the evils of its waygi a dispatch from Buenos Aires to the New York \"Times\"said. It was pointed out that much remains to be explained, since no reference was made to the military occupations of Porto Rico, Haiti and Nicaragua. Editorial comment in Brazil was directed against the Monroe Doctrine, reports from that country said. Mr. Stimson's decision on the arms embargo last October was applauded, it was added. In Mexico City the declarations aroused only slight interest. In Ecuador the complaint was made that Mr. Stimson made it appear in explanation of the Monroe Doctrine that the United States is with all of America against Europe. This \"selfish interpretation\" was not considered acceptable, a dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, as no reason appeared to exist why America should be arrayed against Europe. Scepticism was expressed especially in regard to the continued maintenance of American forces in Nicaragua. Final settlement of the Bolivian external debt question, which has been under discussion in New York since Dec. 12, will be left to the new Bolivian Administration, which comes into office Mar.10, but in the meantime certain interest payments are to cease. A formal statement to this effect was issued Monday by the Financial Commission of Bolivia, composed of Carlos V. Aramayo, Albeit° Palacios and J. Arutro Arguedas, which has been discussing the problem with bankers here. Theinterest payment, which will become due Mar. 1 on the 1928 external 7$ must be postponed, it was stated, while the interest on the 1927 external 7s is already in arrears, payment due Jan. 1 having been omitted. All figures and information which were considered useful to provide a clear understanding of the situation have been laid before New York bankers, it was indicated. \"In general terms the figures show that the estimated revenues of the republic for the current year 1931 will be 28,500,000 Bolivian pesos, as opposed to a peak of about 48,000,000 pesos in 1929,\" the statement said. \"For this reason, and although the estimate of Government expenditure has been reduced as far as is consistent with the needs of public administration, it has not been found possible to include more than 4,000,000 Bolivian pesos in the budget for the service of interest upon the external funded debt of the republic. Moreover, it is feared that, unless there is a marked improvement in general conditions, even this reduced sum may not in the end be available, because the rate at which revenues are being collected makes it appear doubtful that the estimated total of 28,500,000 Bolivian pesos will actually be reached.\" The Commission added that in a report to the Government a general scheme has been outlined covering the problem of debt service. The scheme rests on the principles that it is the intention of Bolivia to meet her obligations fully and absolutely, and that the present capacity of the republic to do so must be taken into consideration. Several far-reaching proposals for relieving the economic straits of Australia were discussed this week at a conference of Australian State premiers. 1090 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE (1 in Canberra. E. Theodore, Commonwealth Treasurer, told the conference last Sunday that the Federal Government had rejected any policy involving reduction of wages. He proposed as a solution for the current depression in Australia a policy of moderate inflation, in the form of a \"limited increase\" of currency. Drastic control over exchange rates and rates of interest are elements of the plan, he said. Prime Minister James H. Scullin supported the proposals of the Treasurer, a Canberra dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, but the State Premiers were about evenly divided in their views. The Commonwealth Bank is said to oppose the suggestions vigorously. An announcement was made in Melbourne Wednesday that Prime Minister Scullin is negotiating with the British Governmentfor reduction of the interest rate on the Australian Government war debt to Britain in an amount at least equal to that obtained by the London Government from the United States. No hope was held out for alteration of the remainder of the Australian overseas debt, amounting to $2,090,000,000. In a London dispatch to the New York \"Times\" it was explained that Australia was one of the first countries to enter into an agreement for the discharge of war obligations to Britain. This debt amounted to $460,000,000 in 1921. \"The / average worked out at about 478% over 35 years,\" the dispatch remarked, \"and the principal now stands at $410,000,000.\" The agreement should be changed, Premier Scullin maintains, so that the interest will be reduced to 3 %, and it is further / 1 2 held that if the period of repayment were extended to 62 years, as with the British debt to the United States, Australian finances would be eased considerably. No changes occurred this week in the discount rates of any of the European central banks.

Rates in all departments of the market were carried over from earlier sessions and no deviations were recorded. Funds also continued in great and almost overwhelming supply. Call loans on the / 1 2 Stock Exchange were 1 70 for all transactions, while in the unofficial outside market a rate of 1% was quoted on money that overflowed from the lending table on the Exchange. The overflow was a daily feature, as it has been for weeks past. There were two indications this week, however, which reflected the extreme current monetary ease. The -United States Treasury notified depositary institutions Monday that the rate of interest to be paid the Treasury on deposits arising out of the sale of certificates of indebtedness would be reduced, effective Feb. 16, to 1% from the current level of 1%. The second indication consists of arrangements, disclosed / 1 2 Wednesday, for reducing to 1% from 1 % the rate of interest paid foreign central banks on demand deposits in New York. This reduction also is to take effect Feb. 16. Brokers' loans against stock and bond collateral finally registered an upturn this week in the compilation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A gain of $33,000,000 was refleeted in the statement for the week ended Wednesday night. Gold movements for the period from Feb. 5 to Feb. 10 reported by the Reserve Bank consisted of imports of $470,000. There were no exports or net changes in the stock of gold held earmarked for foreign account. Dealing in detail with call loan rates on the Stock Exchange from day to day, the rate has again been 1 7 on each and every day of the week, this includ/0 1 2 ing renewals as well as new loans.

The demand for prime bank acceptances in the open market this week has been fairly active, though the supply of satisfactory bills is still far below normal and business in this class of paper has been somewhat restricted on that account.

The market was particularly active on Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday. On Saturday and Monday sterling cables sold at 4.86 11-32 and 4.86%, a new high for the year. On Thursday, Lincoln's Birthday, there was no market in New York,and on Friday cable transfers % sold as low as 4.855 . The range this week has been from 4.85 to 4.86k for bankers' sight bills, compared with 4.853 to 4.86 last week. The range for % cable transfers has been from 4.85% to 4.86%, compared with 4.855 to 4.86 3-16 a week ago. % Following the opening of the market on Tuesday trading quieted down and thereafter sterling receded from the high levels attained on Satirday and Monday. However the undertone continues fairly firm and higher rates are again looked for. This view is based largely upon the fact that at this time seasonal factors all favor sterling and in a few months at the most the exchange will be further strengthened by the beginning of touist traffic. However, for the present, at least, it should be remembered that sterling is now receiving official support and that the Bank of England has been taking steps for several weeks past to firm up the London money market, making it attractive to outside funds. Meantime money rates have shown no signs of firming up in New York. A large part of the demand for sterling on Saturday and Monday in New York was for spot sterling to invest in London bills. London bill rates were marked up fractionally on Monday. Conflicting opinions are coming over from London with regard to the probability of change in the Bank of England's official rediscount rate. Some authorities on the other side look for an immediate rise in the rate. Practically all the major exchanges have moved in favor of sterling. The sharp decline in sterling on Friday and the almost complete reversal of the exchange situation is attributed to speeches made by Chancellor Snowden and Lloyd George on Wednesday. Snowden made a declaration on British national finances which strongly hinted at the necessity for increased tax burdens on capital. He asserted that heavy sacrifices must be made. These remarks caused a sudden stop to the flow of funds from New York, which almost alone was strengthening sterling. It is generally believed that the outward flow of gold to France is at an end except for a few forward 1092 FINANCIAL CHROSTICLE tvoL. 1B2. commitments, but the sterling rate is not yet sufReferring to day-to-day rates, sterling exchange ficiently high to make it possible for the Bank of on Saturday last was firm and active.

His statement before that body last week to the effect that Germany must bend every effort to meet its obligations until the Young plan is revised indicated to foreign investors that Germany will not seek a moratorium or a suspension of reparations transfers and encouraged German investors to call back funds from abroad. The Berlin Bourse consequently has enjoined the most extensive rally in the year. Chancellor Bruening also asserted that support for the Government in its budget plan would mean the end of rule by semi-dictatorship, which is harmful!to the Reich's foreign credit. Unexpectedly favorable announcements by leading German corporations have also helped the market. The foreign exchange situation is now more nearly normal than at any time recently. The return of funds to Berlin has perhaps not been complete, but cessation of exports in itself has been enough to strengthen the exchange as well as to pull support from under guilders and Swiss francs. The London check rate on Paris closed at 123.93 on Friday of this week, compared with 123.96 on Friday of last week. In New York sight bills on the French centre finished at 3.91 13-16, against 3.92 1-16 a week ago; cable transfers at 3.91 15-16, against 3.92 3-16, and commercial sight bills at 3.91 9-16, against 3.91 13-16.

Spanish pesetas have fluctuated rather widely and have generally sold at their lowest points. The weakness in the peseta is largely due to the unsettled political situation and to doubt as to the plans of the Spanish financial authorities for improving the position of the currency. Holland guilders and Swiss francs are selling off principally, it is believed, as the result of the withdrawal of German funds from the Dutch and Swiss centers. The market is also under the impression that there is a considerable movement of Amsterdam funds to London and New York. The reason for weakness in guilders is made plain by the fact that the private discount rate in Amsterdam is now 13/8% against 1 3-16% a week ago, and prime guilder acceptances are 1 3-16% asked, against 1 5-16 a week ago. These money rates are about the lowest on the Continent in important centers with the possible exception of Switzerland, and represent substantial declines since the cut in the Netherlands Bank rate to 23/2% on Jan. 23.
