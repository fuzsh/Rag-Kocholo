        "text": "The traditional approach to the political crisis of 1931 and the events that followed it is to seek to establish responsibility, or guilt, for the fall of the second Labour Government and the formation of its National successor. Few doubt the conventional wisdom that after August 1931 the Conservatives were “cashing in,” completing the imprisonment of MacDonald, securing a massive parliamentary majority, enacting protectionist legislation, and finally causing the resignation of the free traders in September 1932. This orthodoxy has been reinforced in a recent study by John Fair, in which a new “culprit” has been found in Neville Chamberlain. If the evidence of his “culpability” in bringing down the Labour Government is unconvincing, it is buttressed by the assumption that the Conservatives gained most from the crisis, by controlling the new government and enacting conservative measures.\n\nThe study of these events cannot advance beyond the discovery of culprits while it remains confined to the study of individual roles. What is needed, and what this article seeks to supply, is an analysis which takes into account the whole political context, the condition and prospects of all the parties concerned at the time when the crisis broke upon them. It is necessary to separate clearly the expectations of the parties in August from the quite unforseen rewards that they reaped in the October election. The partisan bitterness which has plagued the study of the crisis has largely resulted from a failure to achieve such a separation.\n\n1 The phrase is Mowat's, C. L., Britain Between the Wars 1918–1940 (London, 1955) p. 406Google Scholar. Responsibility is placed on MacDonald and the King. Marquand, David, in Butler, David (ed.), Coalitions in British Politics (London, 1978) p. 61Google Scholar, places more of the responsibility on the King. Two of the most recent accounts of the crisis concentrate mainly on MacDonald's role; Marquand, David, Ramsay Mac-Donald (London, 1977)Google Scholar and Berkeley, Humphrey, The Myth that will not die, the Formation of the National Government 1931 (London, 1978)Google Scholar. A full bibliography of the crisis would occupy several pages, but the recent proliferation of available sources has seriously dated most accounts. One of the most useful older works is Bassett, R., 1931: Political Crisis (London, 1958)Google Scholar.\n\n19 The King believed that he had promised to dissolve Parliament when the Economy and Finance bills had been passed. Wigram's notes, however, indicate that at the Palace conference it was taken for granted that the measures would end the crisis. Although Wigram's notes record that Baldwin and Samuel together asked for the promise, Samuel would have had no motive to do so, and he acted thereafter as if he were quite unaware of it. See Nicolson, Harold, King George V (London, 1952) pp. 465–66Google Scholar. As long as the National Government remained in being, the promise was of little use to Baldwin, as only the Prime Minister could constitutionally ask for a dissolution."
