        "meta_description": "Signed by Author(s) - First Edition - Paper - UK - 1927 - Condition: Very Good - Signed Card by Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden, 1864 ? 1937 was a British politician. A strong speaker, he became popular in trade union circles for his denunciation of capitalism as unethical and his promise of a socialist utopia. He was the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position he held in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. He broke with Labour policy in 1931, and was expelled from the party and excoriated as a turncoat, as the party was overwhelmingly crushed that year by the National Government coalition that Snowden supported. He was succeeded as Chancellor by Neville Chamberlain. Size 90 x 60mm Condition is very good. More images can be taken upon request. Ref 16120 - Signed Card by Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden",
