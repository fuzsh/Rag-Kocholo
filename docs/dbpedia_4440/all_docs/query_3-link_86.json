        "text": "A communist revolution was afoot, Catholics had also gathered to the fray along with the unemployed and were about to seize the key townships of the Wimmera and Mallee in the north-west of Victoria, Australia. A communist Red Army was expected to sweep northwards onto the Murray River border town of Mildura from Bendigo, Maryborough and Ballarat. In small towns along the way, it was anticipated that local Catholics would rise as a Fifth Column in support of the Reds. It was during the dark days of the Great Depression and the League of National Safety (LNS) aka the White Army began swearing-in all reputable citizens, bar the Catholics. Tensions in Australia were running very high in early March 1931and unemployment had grown to alarming levels. The Labor Party was self-destructing over what do about the Depression and Joseph Lyons would soon quit the party on 13 March, after voting against Ted Theodore’s bill to print money for relief works. Meanwhile, NSW Labor Premier, Jack Lang, was preaching ‘repudiation’ on outstanding government loans to Great Britain with his ‘rabid’ supporter, Eddie Ward, winning the Federal seat of East Sydney at a by-election on 7 March - after which ‘Lang Labor’ MPs were no longer welcome in the Labor caucus - Labor thus officially splitting in two. Meantime, the various citizens’ leagues, comprising many tens of thousands and regional secessionists, such as the Riverina Movement, advocating ‘sound finance’ and anti-repudiation were mushrooming. It was within this context that the strange episode of early March 1931 occurred. According to some the White Army had 30,000 members in Victoria and that they had ready access to the armouries of the army reserve. Nation-wide there were up to 100,000 members in so-called ‘fascist’ groups and on that day in March in western Victoria, as some Australians ‘contemplated civil war, other patriots such as Sir John Monash, were also stirred to action’ to ensure that ‘fascists’ dampened their ardour. There had been a considerable build-up to the much-heralded ‘Unemployed Day’ on 6 March 1931 and there were expectations that violence would occur, largely as a result of claims by communists that there would be disturbances in the streets in support of their demands. Consequently, big crowds gathered on the footpaths to watch the various marches, if not participate in them. But nothing happened - there was no uprising, there wasn't a revolution, the nuns did not hand out .303s to the rebels. Fears of Langism and rumours about a Bolshevik takeover had abounded in some circles and in January 1931 and there was even talk of communists planning to launch the revolution by blacking out the city with an attack on power plants. In reality, the 6 March episode was a dreadful disaster for the LNS. The authorities concluded that the panic protective measures were grotesquely unnecessary, while the apparent childish belief in the existence of a moving and devouring Red Army on the part of men regarded as sane and solid seemed beyond belief. Further, the whole story appeared to be the result of hysteria on the part of certain ex-military types aided no doubt by some individuals who were endeavouring to seek the limelight. The LNS was essentially a ‘defensivist’, Protestant, ‘King and Country’ organisation. It was not a ‘fascist’ or even ‘proto-fascist’ organisation in the mould of the Nazis, Mussolini’s Blackshirts or even the New Guard and saw itself as a defender of democracy and the existing Constitution but it did have authoritarian tendencies, was sectarian and possessed anti-democratic features. Like similar organisations elsewhere in Australia, it was short-lived and its feverish, overreactive and embarrassing performance during the events of 1931 ensured that its credibility was quickly found wanting amongst many of the ‘reliable’ and ‘solid’ citizens it had sought to attract in the first place. The high drama surrounding the perceived threats of Bolshevism and Langist ‘repudiation’ soon dissipated with the changes in government both Federally and in NSW and after the first shock waves of the Great Depression subsided; not least due to much better governmental responses in providing assistance for the unemployed. Finally, the military authorities stepped in to ensure that no serving officers could have any involvement in these so-called secret armies, including measures to ensure that the army reserve did not become a base for LNS activities. In other words, Australia’s extremely stable democratic institutions and instincts remained both rock solid and capable of dealing with even the most debilitating and destabilising impacts of the Great Depression. The likelihood of a fascist takeover had about the same chance as a communist one – Buckley’s and none!"
