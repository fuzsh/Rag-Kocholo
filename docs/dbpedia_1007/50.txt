After eight rounds in the 7DAYS EuroCup regular season, there is one team that seems to be one step ahead of the rest: FC Bayern Munich. Still undefeated and already qualified for the Top 16, the German team grabbed a new win in Round 8 against Hapoel Bank Yahav Jerusalem and Danilo Barthel led the effort with a performance index rating of 33 that earned him the MVP honor.
