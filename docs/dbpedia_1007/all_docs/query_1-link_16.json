        "text": "Last Friday (June 2), the Serbian Basketball League announced the dates of the Superliga finals.\n\nAccording to the schedule, the semi-final series between Mega and FMP will be played from June 4-9, while the final series should start on the 10th or 12th and will be completed by June 16 or 18. But now, the ABA League has also published a final series schedule, which overlaps with the Superleague's.\n\nCrvena Zvezda Meridianbet Belgrade would defend their ABA League title against Partizan Mozzart Bet or Cedevita Olimpija in a series that will run from 12 through 17 - or even 22 June (if 5 games are required). Zvezda will have the home-court advantage in the ABA League finals if Cedevita Olimpija overcome Partizan.\n\nSo, the overlap of the two calendars is clear and it is quite certain that it will be very difficult for both competitions to be played according to the plan.\n\nCrvena Zvezda recently stated that \"the announced beginning of the ABA League finals will have to wait for the end of the Serbian national championship\".\n\nHowever, that didn't happen. Hence, Zvezda came forward with a lengthy announcement that essentially repeats the same and stresses that the development \"directly affects the possibility of Red Star playing two series at the same time.\"\n\n\"KK Crvena Zvezda informs the public after the embarrassing announcement of the ABA League that it will not play the finals of the ABA League, the start of which is scheduled for the 12th of June. The club stands by its decision, as stated on 31 May 2023: we won't play until the championship finals are over,\" the new announcement reads.\n\nIn the statement, Zvezda hint about Partizan being behind the scheduling conflict (\"the ABA League showed how much it's being influenced by one club and people who compromise it with their actions and want to win the title off the court\") and warn that \"these dates might possibly bring the end of the ABA League as a competition.\"\n\nThe Serbian side mentions that the ABA league sports director Milija Vojinovic received \"big pressure during Thursday and Friday\" and was \"in direct agreement with the official of KK Partizan Zoran Savic.\"\n\n\"We are not aware of the fact that Zoran Savic is an ABA League official, but only an official of one club and we do not accept these terms, nor will we appear on the court neither on June 12 nor on the 14th,\" the release continues.\n\nZvezda also informed the public that all attempts of the ABA League to declare Partizan or Olimpija the winner of the competition will be followed by court lawsuits.\n\n\"ABA league sports director Milija Vojinovic did not bother to contact KK Crvena Zvezda and possibly consult about the dates and the scheduling of the finals. Nor did he care that KK Crvena Zvezda have to wait for 23 days and for meaningless excuses until the start of the finals,\" the club argued.\n\n\"The dates of the finals are determined by the participating clubs by mutual agreement. As the person responsible for all this, we consider the sports director of the league Milija Vojinovic, who enabled KK Partizan to not play their ABA League games until they finished their EuroLeague season,\" Zvezda pointed out.\n\nThe club went on to say that while other domestic leagues (Spain, Greece) didn't stop their playoff action amidst the EuroLeague playoffs, the ABA League did just that.\n\n\"We are pleased that the masks have finally fallen once and for all, and that we can see who is doing what. Because of all the above, KK Crvena Zvezda will ask that the Serbian national team coach Svetislav Pesic, who had something to say about the late completion of the league last season, makes a public statement,\" Red Star said.\n\n\"KK Crvena Zvezda reiterates once again that it will not play the ABA League finals until the finals of the championship of Serbia, the country we represent, are finished, and in the event that the ABA League does not deviate from this scandalous 'solution,' it will seek its right in court.\n\nThe responsibility currently rests solely and exclusively with the leaders of the ABA League,\" the club's announcement concluded.\n\nThank you for reading us! We have even more content for you."
