        "text": "Zahavi denied it. In an angry email, he criticized PSG's director general, Jean-Claude Blanc, saying it had been a \"big mistake\" to send the club confidential documents. He insisted on receiving the money through Cyprus. But the club stuck to its hard line. Ultimately, Zahavi signed the \"Sports Agency Remuneration Agreement\" as a private individual, listing his address in Tel Aviv. Zahavi says the money was paid into a personal account and was taxed in Israel. Zahavi felt insulted by the treatment and he let PSG executives know about it.\n\nZahavi constantly has two, sometimes three mobile phones that he actively uses. Besides a credit card, they're really all the agent needs to work while flying between continents.\n\nSuch methods, however, are not always conducive to thorough bookkeeping. When British tax inspector Mark H. was attempting to track the million-dollar payments to Zahavi from the Premier League, he demanded that Manchester City hand over documents outlining the transfers of various players. \"What was Zahavi's role?\" he asked in a letter.\n\nThe club had difficulties finding all the documents. At one point, they were trying to locate documentation for fees paid in relation to Robinho's transfer. \"We ... do not have access to copies of all correspondence,\" Man City's chief financial officer responded. The deal had been made \"while the club was being taken over by Abu Dhabi.\" He continued: \"You are aware that this is not uncommon within the industry that a significant proportion of deals are carried out over the phone and are not formally noted.\"\n\nInfluence and Contacts\n\nZahavi's London-based attorney heard something equally nebulous from Jorge Mendes in June 2014. The Portuguese national represents players like Cristiano Ronaldo and is, like Zahavi, a major player in the world of football agents. Both men have worked together before to push through significant transfers, many of which took place between FC Porto and FC Chelsea.\n\nZahavi's lawyer wanted to prepare himself in the phone call with Mendes for follow-ups from the tax authorities. He was hoping for information about industry practices and his client's role. He took notes during the call. \"Basically everyone in the football industry knows Mr. Zahavi and that he used that influence and those contacts, including club chairmen and even some heads of state, to broker player deals.\"\n\nLike Man City's chief financial officer, Mendes also described how paper was no longer as important for Zahavi's work as it had been back when the Israeli was a newspaper journalist. Zahavi's commissions \"are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis and always by mobile phone.\" He said that is how all deals between him and Zahavi had been done.\n\nFor years, there had been a model in the football industry in which Zahavi was strongly involved: so-called Third-Party Ownership (TPO). It basically worked like this: Investors would buy a share of Club A's transfer rights of a hopeful professional. If the player's market value rose, the investors would then frequently insist on the player being sold onward to Club B. The practice led to many clubs becoming dangerously dependent on investors; which is why FIFA banned TPO in May 2015.\n\nSome investors, who for years had been advised by Zahavi to put their money to work in the transfer rights of certain players, are hidden by a company called Leiston Holdings Limited. It is registered in the British Virgin Islands, where the tax rate on income generated abroad is zero percent, as is also the case in Gibraltar. These were deals in which investors could see a huge return within a very short period of time. In addition, such TPO transactions were often accompanied by huge fees that were channeled to tax havens.\n\nInside a TPO\n\nThe whole palette of dubious transactions was illustrated by the case of the Serbian professional Lazar Markovic, 24, who belongs to FC Liverpool and is currently on loan to the Belgian first division team RSC Anderlecht.\n\nIn April 2012, only weeks after Markovic had turned 18, Leiston Holdings acquired 100 percent of the player's transfer rights from Partizan Belgrade. The price: 7 million euros.\n\nJust over a year later, in June 2013, the striker was transfered to Benfica Lissabon. The Portuguese club transferred 6.25 million euros to Leiston, but that sum was only enough to secure half of Markovic's transfer rights.\n\nJust trying to follow the cash flows of the companies Zahavi works for can at times be dizzying. Although Sport & More was a contractual partner, Damjanac later requested that Leiston pay the 250,000 euros to a company in Malta named Lian Sports. A buddy of Zahavi's, whom he refers to as \"my guy,\" works for the company in the Balkans.\n\nBut that wasn't all. Damjanac signed another contract with Leiston relating to the matter of Lazar Markovic on May 3, 2012. This time it was for a company named Goldline based in the Swiss border town of Chiasso. According to the contract, Leiston was to transfer 2 million euros to Goldline. Once again, the alleged reason for payment was support provided in the purchase of Markovic's transfer rights.\n\n'Brokerage Services'\n\nWhy would Leiston Holdings, advised by Pini Zahavi, transfer more than 30 percent of the 7 million euros invested in \"brokerage services\" to two companies owned by the same consultant? Were there any reasons other than to cater to some good friends? Neither Pini Zahavi nor Nikola Damjanac nor the firms Lian Sports and Leiston Holdings would comment on this suspicion.\n\nZahavi secured numerous million-dollar TPO deals for Leiston, including at least one murky arrangement involving underage talent.\n\nDanilo Pantic was 16 years old when Leiston acquired half of his transfer rights on March 29, 2013. Like Markovic, the young midfielder was a Partizan Belgrade player, and his training contract ran until summer 2015.\n\nLeiston paid 1.7 million euros for its share of his transfer rights. But that money didn't go to the club itself in Belgrade. Instead it went to two companies based on the island of Nevis, which belongs to the West Indies in the Caribbean. One is called TXL Investments and the other is SNR Limited. Leiston Holdings transferred the money to both companies' accounts at the Bank of Valletta, a financial institution in Malta.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. SNR transferred 500,000 euros to a company called Leary Invest in the British Virgin Islands and it passed another 170,000 euros on to a company called Guanta Gold based in Belize in Central America. The 1.7 million euros paid by Leiston Holdings wound up at four companies -- all based in tax havens.\n\nThe salient detail here is that both TXL Investments and SNR Limited in the West Indies, where Leiston's money had initially landed, were controlled by a director of Lian Sports in Malta, which was also involved in the million-euro deals in the Markovic case. None of the parties involved answered questions about why and for what purpose the money had been paid.\n\nUltimate Beneficiaries\n\nIt was likely these kinds of shady deals that kept Werder Bremen from meeting with Zahavi as far back as spring 2012. At that time, Leiston had made an offer to the Bremen club of 7 million euros for the transfer rights for former German national team player Marko Marin.\n\nAt first, Werder had been prepared to engage in talks. But the club withdrew from the deal because Leiston had apparently refused to disclose information about the structure of the company in the British Virgin Islands and its ultimate beneficiaries. \"We were unable to resolve this issue to our satisfaction and in line with our compliance standards,\" Werder Bremen told journalists with EIC.\n\nThe investigative reporting network requested a written statement from Zahavi on Oct. 8 on all the deals described in this article. It only took a few hours for Zahavi to respond. He wrote that he had never held a stake in Leiston Holdings and that he had never been a beneficiary. \"I use to be football advisor (sic) of this company (Leiston Holdings) during the period that TPO was legal,\" he wrote. Zahavi stated that all of the other questions were \"not relevant.\"\n\nJust over a week later, though, Zahavi did agree to meet with an Israeli journalist representing EIC. The meeting took place in the upscale Sea and Sun residential complex in northwest Tel Aviv, where Zahavi owns a condo with magnificent views of the ocean.\n\nZahavi wore Bermuda shorts and a polo shirt and offered the journalist a cup of coffee. Zahavi's son Gil also sat at the table and recorded the conversation. The agent said he had agreed to a personal meeting because he feared the reporting would amount to \"libel,\" based on the questions about the Neymar deal. And that he wanted to prevent that.\n\n'I Have Power'\n\nZahavi put all the documents relevant to the Neymar contract on the table. Those documents show that Paris Saint-Germain paid the first installment of 1.49 million euros not to one of Zahavi's companies in a tax haven, but to him personally. The money went into an account held at the Israeli bank Hapoalim that Zahavi had opened expressly for the purpose after concluding his consulting contract with PSG. Zahavi also said that he has always taxed personal income from his worldwide corporate profits in Israel."
