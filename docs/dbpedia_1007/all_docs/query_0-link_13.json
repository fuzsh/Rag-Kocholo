        "text": "Photos by Josh Herwitt & courtesy of Primavera Sound LA // Written by Josh Herwitt //\n\nPrimavera Sound LA //\n\nLA State Historic Park – Los Angeles\n\nSeptember 16th-18th, 2022 //\n\nIt’s no secret that Primavera Sound has had its sights set on Los Angeles for quite some time now. The Barcelona music festival that has been going strong for two decades expanded to Porto in 2012 and will finally stamp its brand on four more cities in 2022 after a two-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLA is the first of those four cities, but with the festival’s other three new locations — São Paulo, Buenos Aires and Santiago — all launching in South America later this year, LA State Historic Park also served as Primavera Sound’s inaugural event in the states.\n\nSpreading four stages across the 32-acre park that remains one of the best spots in the city to host a music festival before and after three years of renovations, PSLA welcomed a wealth of talent from the top line to the bottom. Lorde, Nine Inch Nails and Arctic Monkeys each delivered headline-worthy sets while an indie-leaning undercard highlighted by BICEP (Live), Cigarettes After Sex, Clairo, DARKSIDE, Drain Gang, Fontaines D.C., Girl in Red, GIVĒON, James Blake, King Krule, Khruangbin and Mitski all drew big crowds over the course of three days. In a lot of ways, PSLA fills a much-needed void after the sudden and disheartening end to FYF Fest, which would tout itself as the “best weekend of summer” for many live music fans and was one of our favorite multi-day festivals to cover (read more here).\n\nAny time a new music festival launches though, there are always highs and lows. So without further ado, here are our best and worst moments from Primavera Sound’s first installment on U.S. soil:\n\nBest: The weather\n\nAfter LA experienced its worst heat wave of the year earlier this month with temperatures reaching triple digits, the weather luckily cooled down just in time for PSLA. For many of us, a second layer of clothing wasn’t ever necessary from Friday afternoon to Sunday evening. After all, how often does that happen? With great music lined up throughout the day and a forecast hovering in the mid to high 70’s, it truly felt like a quintessential summer weekend in LA.\n\nWorst: Will Call line\n\nWhen we arrived at the festival on Friday afternoon, the line at the box office quickly stood out. In fact, it was so long that we knew the wait would be at least an hour for those trying to pick up their passes, only to discover later via Twitter it was even longer for many even at 6 p.m. These are the kind of issues any first-year music festival hopes to avoid and can ultimately prepare for, but when you change your ticket delivery method to in-person on short notice after previously telling fans it would be done electronically, it’s no surprise that you end up pissing off some of your customers.\n\nBest: Lorde\n\nThe 25-year-old singer-songwriter has been making the rounds this year on an extensive world tour in support of 2021’s Solar Power, and there’s no question that her entire stage design and production was impressive to witness. Ahead of festival stops at Life Is Beautiful and Rifflandia over the same weekend, Lorde arrived onstage via a rotating staircase with some of her backing band and ran through 15 songs — from her 2013 debut single “Royals” to Melodrama hits like “Perfect Places” and “Green Light” — as PSLA’s first headliner. We wouldn’t necessarily call ourselves big fans, but we definitely understand why she was deserving of top billing.\n\nWorst: Food & drink\n\nWe will eventually get to the limited viewing space that under-21 guests were offered, but even if you wanted to drink at PSLA, the options were simply not good. This was certainly not the place for craft beer enthusiasts, as your choices were Heineken or the low-calorie Tecate Alta that tasted mostly like beer-flavored water for $12 each. Not only would it be nice to have seen local breweries — there are two excellent ones located across the street from the festival’s entrance — featured, but in a city such as LA with a food-and-drink scene that’s one of the best in the country, partnering with major beer and liquor brands along with a handful of Smorgasburg LA restaurants doesn’t exactly cut it anymore. The only food stall in one of the VIP areas selling “California style” Philly cheeseteaks made us think about how much Goldenvoice has elevated its game in this respect, with top-notch local options at Just Like Heaven (read our festival review here) from Goldburger to Homage Brewing standing out as examples most recently in May.\n\nBest: Khruangbin\n\nThe Houston three-piece that has made 70’s Thai funk sound cool again has been one of the hottest acts to tour over the past five years, as evidenced by their three sold-out shows at LA’s Greek Theatre last November. While most might have come Saturday to see Nine Inch Nails, it was K-bin who would steal the show before Trent Reznor and company ever played a note. Those who made it to the main stage for sunset were treated to an hour of grooves, as Mark Speer (guitar, vocals), Laura Lee (bass, vocals) and Donald Johnson (drums, vocals) hypnotized us with fan favorites “María También” and “So We Won’t Forget” before diving into a melody of covers that embraced a wide array of artists, from MF DOOM, The Isley Brothers, Tina Turner and Chris Isaak to 90’s hip-hop legends A Tribe Called Quest, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Warren G and Dr. Dre.\n\nWorst: Art installations\n\nSometimes it can be easy to forget how spoiled we are in California when it comes to all of the music festivals we have. Not only do many of our best and brightest such as Coachella, Outside Lands and Lightning in a Bottle showcase a wide range of musical genres, but they also feature their own unique art installations that continue to push the envelope. In the case of Primavera Sound, let’s just say that’s not its M.O. While we can’t fault the festival for keeping the focus strictly on the music, LA State Historic Park did seem to lack some color aesthetically. That said, there were a couple of highlights off the stage, including the vinyl market that was curated by KCRW and Beat Swap Meets as well as the FLATSTOCK poster show series making its only West Coast stop of the year and featuring locals like Kii Arens of La-La Land Prints.\n\nBest: Signs, sightlines & sound\n\nWith the Primavera Sound brand being all about the music, our eyes were mostly focused on the artists performing. Nevertheless, the signs, sightlines and sound at PSLA were all on point. The downtown LA skyline served as a fitting backdrop like it usually does at LASHP, and despite poor audio issues playing a role at outdoor music festivals, we didn’t experience any while we were on the ground so kudos to the organizers for locking that down. If anything, the decibels across the fest’s four stages were so high that we found ourselves needing ear protection most of the weekend.\n\nWorst: Short headliner sets\n\nAfter Primavera Sound LA unveiled the lineup for its debut this year, we presumed all three headliners would receive at least 90 minutes each day. So when the set times dropped more than a couple weeks in advance, it was a bit of a shock seeing only 75 minutes designated for each of them. A Hall of Fame band like Nine Inch Nails has more than 10 studio albums and several EPs in its catalog but were only granted enough time to crank out 16 songs, many of which have been setlist staples for years up to this point. Though NIN classics like “Wish”, “March of the Pigs”, “Closer”, “Gave Up” and “Head Like a Hole” are never tracks to lack energy live, we’re happy we caught their sold-out gig at the Santa Barbara Bowl (read our show review here) four days earlier for the chance to hear a cover of David Bowie’s “I’m Afraid of Americans” and multiple other deep cuts.\n\nBest: Arctic Monkeys\n\nIt was clear when we showed up for PSLA’s final day that the attendance felt bigger than the day prior. Although that seemed a little odd considering it was Sunday and not Saturday, it was a testament to the fan base Arctic Monkeys have built at the 20-year mark. The English rockers haven’t toured since 2018’s Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, and with their forthcoming seventh LP The Car slated to come out next month, frontman Alex Turner and his bandmates gave us a taste with the disco funk that they’ve cooked up on “I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am” midway through their headlining performance. And even though we didn’t hear lead single “There’d Better Be a Mirrorball” despite it being the only track that they have officially released so far, there were plenty of other thrilling moments for us to remember in between the opening notes of “Do I Wanna Know?” and the closing “R U Mine?” to end the night. Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait too long before there’s a return date to California after the new album drops.\n\nWorst: Under-21 viewing areas\n\nMost of PSLA’s guests are of legal drinking age, and with the festival boasting a number of alcohol-related sponsors that included Cuervo and Smirnoff, it certainly caters to the over-21 crowd. But for those who weren’t, the viewing areas at the Primavera and Tecate Alta stages were less than ideal. Besides the allotted space being too small and positioned off to the side, underage guests were only informed 10 days in advance. If you’re not 21 yet, make sure to temper your expectations — or we’d recommend waiting until you are before attending.\n\nPrimavera Sound LA photographers featured: Nicolita Bradley, Lindsey Byrnes, Pooneh Ghana, Miranda McDonald, Ismael Quintanilla III & Quinn Tucker.\n\nWritten by Josh Herwitt //\n\nWith live music returning to stages across the U.S. during the second half of last year and spring now right around the corner, 2022 is shaping up to be a monumental year for the industry and a big reason for that is the comeback of the music festival. California has certainly played a major part in its revival coming out of a global pandemic, with a number of single-day and multi-day events already scheduled to take place up and down the Golden State over the next six-plus months. So, who’s ready for festival season to begin?\n\nIf you’re itching to hit a music festival, here are 10 in California you should save your cash for this year.\n\nCRSSD Festival\n\nLocation: Waterfront Park – San Diego\n\nDates: March 5th-6th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nOne North American concert promoter who wasn’t deterred by the news surrounding the coronavirus’ omicron variant a few months ago happens to be FNGRS CRSSD, the San Diego-based brand that debuted CRSSD Festival back in 2015 and has been going strong ever since with a spring and fall edition of the event each year. Unleashing another electronic-leaning roster for its first installment in 2022 with Glass Animals and SOFI TUKKER as headliners, CRSSD has managed to hold tight with its plans. Four Tet, Get Real (Claude VonStroke and Green Velvet), Gorgon City, 070 Shake, Blu DeTiger, Cautious Clay, Chet Faker, Parcels, Franc Moody, Lastlings, SG Lewis and more stack the undercard.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nSmokin Grooves Fest\n\nLocation: LA State Historic Park – Los Angeles\n\nDates: March 19th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nSmookin Grooves’ lineup has easily matched what it offered fans in 2018 (read our review here) and 2019 (read our review here) after putting on excellent showings both years sheerly by landing Erykah Badu, Nas, The Roots, Miguel and Jhené Aiko to lead the charge. But adding The Internet, Flying Lotus, Kamasi Washington, Thundercat, Smino, Toro y Moi, SiR, Little Dragon, Hiatus Kaiyote and more to the roster makes this another must-see production. The one-day fest is also getting a change of scenery as it relocates north to the 32-acre LA State Historic Park in the Chinatown neighborhood of downtown LA that once hosted FYF Fest and several HARD events.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nCoachella Valley Music and Arts Festival\n\nLocation: Empire Polo Club – Indio, CA\n\nDates: April 15th-17th & April 22nd-24th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nThe three-day, two-weekend event is finally ready to give it another go in April after becoming one of the first large-scale music festivals in the U.S. to postpone its plans when the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm almost two years ago. Harry Styles and Billie Eilish will spearhead the 2022 lineup, with Swedish House Mafia back at Coachella for the first time in a decade since the electronic supergroup’s closing set on the main stage in 2012 and The Weeknd added late to help replace Ye (fka Kanye West). The famed California fest has had a penchant for booking more international acts — from BLACKPINK to Bad Bunny — in recent years, and 2022 will be no different.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nBeachLife Festival\n\nLocation: Seaside Lagoon – Redondo Beach, CA\n\nDates: May 13th-15th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nThe three-day event moved to September in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s back to its normal month of May this year with plenty to get excited about. Leading the fest’s third installment will be Weezer and 311 as co-headliners on Friday while The Smashing Pumpkins and Steve Miller Band will have their own days — Saturday and Sunday, respectively — to shine even after the sun dips into the Pacific Ocean. Black Pumas, Vance Joy, Sheryl Crow, Stone Temple Pilots and Lord Huron, in the meantime, anchor an impressive undercard for what’s sure to be a party down by the shore.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nJust Like Heaven\n\nLocation: Brookside at the Rose Bowl – Pasadena, CA\n\nDates: May 21st\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nThe one-day music festival put on by Goldenvoice, which debuted in 2019 and was an instant success, has dropped a 2022 roster that should be a dream come true for any indie music fan. And after a two-year absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show is ready to go on again — although this time it’s migrating north from the Queen Mary Park in Long Beach to take over the Brookside Golf Course at the Rose Bowl — and we still can’t remember the last time heaven ever looked this good. NYC indie rockers Interpol will have the honor of headlining this time around, but sets by Modest Mouse, The Shins, M.I.A., Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, Chromeo, Santigold, Cut Copy, The Hives, Wolf Parade, Peaches, !!!, The Raveonettes and more are likely to leave a lasting impression.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nLightning in a Bottle\n\nLocation: Buena Vista Aquatic Recreation Area – Bakersfield, CA\n\nDates: May 25th-30th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nAfter being forced to cancel its 15th edition more than 18 months ago due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the “transformational festival” is returning to Kern County over Memorial Day weekend and The Do LaB has retained a handful of acts on the 2020 roster from headliners like Kaytranada and GRiZ to several undercard standouts such as Purity Ring, Big Wild, Four Tet, Empress Of and Jon Hopkins. But LIB in 2022 will also feature some new blood, starting right at the top of the poster with Glass Animals as well as a pair of Brits in SG Lewis and Little Simz — who are newcomers to the event — on the bill. Other notable names include Chet Faker, Black Coffee, CloZee, Seth Troxler, Monolink, G Jones B2B Eprom, Maya Jane Coles, Goldlink, OPIUO, Chika, Mr. Carmack, Big Freedia, Dirtwire and more, including a Desert Hearts launch party with Lee Reynolds.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nBottleRock Napa Valley\n\nLocation: Napa Valley Expo – Napa, CA\n\nDates: May 27th-29th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nDespite announcing its lineup at the beginning of this year when COVID-19 cases were skyrocketing across the U.S. due to the omicron variant, the three-day event is marching ahead toward its normal timing of Memorial Day weekend after canceling in 2020 and sliding the festivities back to Labor Day weekend in 2021. And much like BottleRock’s previous rosters, 2022’s follows very much in the same vein (i.e. lots of rock ‘n’ roll) with Metallica, P!NK, Twenty One Pilots and Luke Combs topping the bill. The Napa fest’s ninth edition should serve as a special performance for Metallica no less, considering that the legendary heavy-metal band has called the Bay Area home for almost three decades.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nOutside Lands Music and Arts Festival\n\nLocation: Golden Gate Park – San Francisco\n\nDates: August 5-7th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nAfter being forced in 2021 to push back its 13th year (read our review here) to Halloween weekend due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the three-day music festival is finally returning to its usual timing in August and spring is when we normally anticipate the lineup dropping every year. But the latest installment of SF’s signature event has a slightly different feel than in years past as Green Day, Post Malone and SZA assume headlining duties with Jack Harlow, Weezer, Phoebe Bridgers, Illenium, Lil Uzi Vert, Kali Uchis, Disclosure, Mitski, Polo & Pan and Anitta leading the undercard. And though all three headliners will be topping the poster at OSL for the first time, Green Day’s performance should carry a little extra weight given that the legacy act is originally from the East Bay.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nThis Ain’t No Picnic\n\nBrookside at the Rose Bowl – Pasadena, CA\n\nDates: August 27th-28th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nConcert promoter Goldenvoice is bringing back This Ain’t No Picnic to SoCal for the first time since 2002 and taking over the Brookside Golf Course at the Rose Bowl for two days in late August (warning: it will be hot) with a killer two-day roster that screams “Pitchfork Fest!” The event has a history of exposing the raw energy of punk-leaning, indie darlings such as Sonic Youth, Sleater-Kinney and Guided by Voices in 1999 before taking another step toward the mainstream by booking Beck, Yo La Tengo, Built to Spill, At the Drive-In and Modest Mouse for its 2000 edition. A couple of NYC products in The Strokes and LCD Soundsystem will serve as headliners in 2022 while the fest’s undercard offers its own set of highlights starting with the reunion of Le Tigre, another NYC product who last reunited in 2016 to give us “I’m with Her” as their latest single.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nPrimavera Sound Los Angeles\n\nLA State Historic Park – Los Angeles\n\nDates: September 16-18th\n\nTickets: Buy them here!\n\nPrimavera Sound has been a staple across the music festival circuit since launching back in 2001 with its Spanish roots firmly planted in Barcelona. But we would be lying if we didn’t admit here that we have eagerly been anticipating the release of Primavera Sound LA’s inaugural lineup, which was originally set to make its U.S. debut in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic put a hold on things, and that news has finally become a reality with Arctic Monkeys, Lorde and Nine Inch Nails set to headline. That said, Arca, Bicep (Live), Buscabulla, Cigarettes After Sex, Clairo, DARKSIDE, Faye Webster, James Blake, Jehnny Beth, Khruangbin, Kim Gordon, King Krule, Low, Mitski, Stereolab and Tierra Whack have all signed on as well to mark what’s looking like a banner year for live music in the City of Angels.\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nWhich of these music festivals are you going to? Which are you looking forward to the most?\n\nPhotos by Norm de Veyra // Written by Kevin Quandt //\n\nOutside Lands Music and Arts Festival //\n\nGolden Gate Park – San Francisco\n\nAugust 10th-12th, 2018 //\n\nAs another summer festival season winds down, we look back at the 2018 edition of Outside Lands with highlights, thoughts, musings and enough images to make you nostalgic for the Bay Area’s banner music festival. With the Superfly, Another Planet Entertainment and Starr Hill event celebrating its 11th edition, this incarnation of the annual Golden Gate Park soirée saw more of a return to form over the past year while also experiencing a notable shift in the sound that could be heard emanating through the eucalyptus and other flora.\n\nWhile cancellations left a slightly sour taste in the mouths of last year’s attendees, this year only saw limited lineup hiccups. However, the bigger story at hand surrounds the changing tides of popular music. Sure, you’ve heard folks state “rock is dead,” but is a once-amusing quip starting to take greater shape as the youth clamor for a different sound and aesthetic? Though it was pretty evident on the 2018 lineup poster when it dropped in April, this query started to take greater shape once you were on the grounds and bouncing between sets. So, let’s jump straight into this now.\n\nFriday\n\nDay 1 at Outside Lands tends to be a slow trickle of fans entering the park as some are able to play hooky, bounce from the office early or only show up for the headliners. Sure, some folks had to deal with longer-than-expected box office lines and others even had to bear the fest’s new bag policies, but luckily those in attendance were blessed with some clear skies instead of the usual August dread of the Outer Lands.\n\nWhile Billie Eilish was relishing in her rising appeal on the Lands End stage, covering Drake and running through the majority of her singles, Rex Orange County was trying his hand at something a bit new and terrifying. The UK wunderkind was forced to play his first-ever solo festival set as his band and their gear ran into transit issues on the way to SF from the Pacific Northwest. The young crooner seemed a bit nervous about this predicament but competently knocked out a solid, eight-song performance that included “Sunflower” and closer “Loving Is Easy”.\n\nN.E.R.D., meanwhile, played their first SF show in many years to a raucous crowd, opening with “Anti Matter” as a hyped Pharrell Williams feverishly worked every corner of the huge Lands End stage. The set featured a massive medley of tracks by The Neptunes, a cover of “Seven Nation Army” and a double dose of “Lemon” to send us on our way to the next set.\n\nSimultaneously, Carly Rae Jepsen was apparently throwing down one of Outside Lands’ most enjoyable performances in front of a rather large crowd. While the pop sensation pleased the masses with a rendition of her breakout hit “Call Me Maybe”, she also performed more recent songs like “Emotion”.\n\nODESZA obviously drew a large crowd for their main stage afternoon showcase, putting the spotlight on the changing tides and tastes of the youth music market. That kind of youthful angst and energy seemed to be danced out to ODESZA, DJ Snake and Big Gigantic compared to the pits of rock bands from the 2000’s, be it Queens of the Stone Age, System of a Down or Deftones.\n\nWith the under-25 crowd predominantly stationed at Lands End, you could say there was a more intimate feeling at Twin Peaks for Father John Misty. Touting his expanded band that featured a string section and dialing back his quirky stage banter, Josh Tillman’s latest tour has been pretty much about presenting his music as faithfully as he can. “Nancy From Now On” opened his career-spanning performance as the shadows began to drape the park.\n\nWhile FJM’s attendance was noticeably a bit small for a rock act, the king of “jizz jazz,” aka Mac DeMarco, was able to attract a rowdy crowd for his closing set on the Sutro stage. When the synth sections of “On the Level” opened DeMarco’s set, a certain air of relaxation swept the crowd as various smokeables were consumed in honor of indie-slacker royalty onstage.\n\nAbel Tesfaye, popularly known as The Weeknd, enjoyed a sort of victory lap as he headlined the festival’s first day with an onslaught of hits such as “Starboy”, “Can’t Feel My Face” and “The Hills”, along with a few select covers of Future, Belly, Drake and Ty Dolla $ign. Though Tesfaye’s current large-scale show is nothing new to the live music circuit, he still threw one helluva party before sending the masses into the wilds of the City.\n\nSaturday\n\nIt has been a couple of years since Outside Lands was fortunate enough to have a truly clear, sunny Saturday — and not just for a few hours, but the whole damn day. Plus, it was topped off with another insanely gorgeous sunset, but let’s not jump the gun here.\n\nAs the day got underway, New York indie artist Amen Dunes performed an extremely tight set, showcasing his wavy take on psychedelic rock/folk. Led by Damon McMahon, the trio played heavy off its most recent release Freedom while also not completely ignoring its back catalog. Moreover, McMahon’s stage presence was infectious and somewhat akin to R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe, as his slender build moved to the emotive nature of his craft.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Lizzo was bringing down the early-afternoon house as she decimated the Lands End stage. “Fitness” opened her 10-song set as her pair of dancers, as well as Lizzo herself, left everything on the stage for the sizable crowd that was yearning for her energy, and some even yearned for a shot of tequila from her bottle of Patrón as she entered the photo pit for an up-close appearance during closing song “Good as Hell”.\n\nWhen the Lizzo crowd dispersed, Broken Social Scene fans got prime real estate to catch the Canadian indie-rock demigods perform a blistering set of guitar-heavy tunes like opener “KC Accidental” and closer “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl”. Even in such a large setting, the massive band was able to cook up a sense of intimacy and really engage.\n\nWhile OSL this year leaned more toward R&B, electronic pop and other hip genres, UK jazz purveyors GoGo Penguin delivered a stunning set of avant-garde-leaning jazz. This punchy trio showed their chops over tracks like “One Percent” and set closer “Window” and could easily be compared to The Bad Plus. GoGo were a perfect palate cleanser before heading to more current stylings from either SOB X RBE or CHVRCHES.\n\nLocal legend Tycho performed to an enthusiastic crowd while Scott Hansen stated this would be the last incarnation of this phase for the group (we look forward to the next chapter). Back over at Lands End, Bon Iver delivered a prototypically powerful set as the sunlight dwindled, simultaneously providing a seriously stunning sunset.\n\nAs the limited amount of darkness fell over the park, one-third of The xx was preparing to hold court as the Sutro crowd swelled, moving their dancing feet to the new-school dance pioneer known as Jamie xx (born James Smith). Even as Jamie xx eased into his intro (The Animals’ “San Francisco Nights”) and more fans pushed in, it was rather evident that the Sutro’s sound system wasn’t able to fully reach the volume many were looking for. But an Above & Beyond nod (“Sun in Your Eyes”) eventually led straight into Smith’s mix of “On Hold” and all was right in the world, if only for about eight minutes.\n\nThere was a bit of controversy surrounding Saturday’s main slot as Florence + the Machine officially made the move to full-blown festival headliner. Some festivalgoers had their own doubts after FYF Fest 2018 was canceled with a near-identical top billing, but Florence and her bandmates proved, many times over, that she is more than capable of commanding any stage as her energy is unlike many others. She debuted a brand-new show, which featured “June” in the opening slot and was book-ended by “Big God” and “Shake It Out” for a two-song encore.\n\nSunday\n\nOn the final day, the weather was back on track; by that, I mean it was cold, blustery and generally moist. Most were thankful for the two previous days as opposed to three days of “Karl the Fog,” as has been tradition for a good 3-4 years now.\n\nThe early afternoon of Sunday bore witness to some very lively performances from up-and-comers like Rainbow Kitten Surprise and Hobo Johnson & the Lovemakers, both of who are primed to make moves in the festival circuit over the next year if they play their cards right.\n\nContinuing with the trend of electro-leaning acts playing to some big crowds, BØRNS fully commanded a youthful contingent with hits such as “10,000 Emerald Pools” and set closer “Electric Love”.\n\nThe incomparable Janelle Monáe was a tad late to take the stage, as she was fighting off a stomach bug, but when she did, she captivated the masses with a suite of tracks from her most recent release Dirty Computer and tossed in a fair amount of costume changes over a nearly hour-long set. Monáe proved that she’s easily one of the best in the business at the moment and will only continue to climb upwards.\n\nOver at the Twin Peaks stage, The Internet was trying to hash out some sort of technical difficulties before beginning their abbreviated performance, which seemed to be a little lopsided and uneven as they did their best to deal with the 30 minutes that they had left. Fortunately, “Girl” got the majority who stuck around swaying to Syd’s sultry vocals and generally chilled demeanor.\n\nPortugal. The Man held a fleeting rock slot on the main stage, putting their quirky brand of psych-leaning pop rock on display. Moreover, they tossed in some oddly placed Pink Floyd and Beatles covers before closing with their breakthrough hit “Feel It Still”.\n\nAussie newcomer Tash Sultana, meanwhile, was putting on a masterclass in instrumentation and looping. Sultana has really had one of the biggest breakout years in independent music, and it was clearly evident as she had a carefree stage presence backed by some truly unique, solo-delivered music ripe with psychedelic and world elements. The 23-year-old is certainly a name to watch over the next year and beyond.\n\nAs the last set of OSL artists got ready to play, James Blake brought us to church for this year’s final performance on the Sutro stage, failing to disappoint while the fog grew slightly thicker in Lindley Meadow. Highlights from Blake’s dreamy set were easily his take on Untold’s track “Stop What You’re Doing” and a semi-rare rendition of “Modern Soul”.\n\nSome say Janet Jackson couldn’t pull in big crowds amid the current shifting landscape of large-scale music festivals, and although she didn’t pull in record-breaking numbers on a rugged SF night, it was clearly evident that those fans who stayed to watch her were all-in. Jackson’s career-spanning show touched on more than 35 songs and was accompanied by some fierce choreography and production elements. Sure, she wasn’t singing much of the time, but that didn’t stop a wide range of fans from showering Jackson with affection. Her closing performance was highlighted by “That’s the Way Love Goes” and later on, the MJ collaboration “Scream” that transitioned into “Rhythm Nation”.\n\nAs the music festival industry continues to deal with a shifting crowd and demand, Outside Lands regained its stride after a few hiccups in 2017. And while this year’s lineup might not have appealed to the core demographic from its incarnation, the event still offers something for everyone.\n\nPhotos by Norm de Veyra & James Pawlish // Written by Molly Kish //\n\nOutside Lands Music and Arts Festival //\n\nGolden Gate Park – San Francisco\n\nAugust 5th-7th, 2016 //\n\nCelebrating its ninth annual year as Northern California’s premier music, comedy, food and arts festival, Outside Lands took over Golden Gate Park last weekend and entertained crowds of more than 60,000 attendees each day with a massive roster of world-renowned talent. This year’s highlights surmounted all previous editions and exceeded the expectations of the most veteran festivalgoers.\n\nBeyond the daily artist lineups, mouth-watering fare and unparalleled comedy showcases, Outside Lands kicked it up a notch in 2016, playing to what seemed like a more refined crowd on a local and national level. The festival’s organizers created an environment that appealed to both novices and seasoned attendees, with convenience being the key factor and a running theme that helped establish a flow to the fairgrounds that was unattainable in past years.\n\nThe fest also worked with PayPal to set up an option for cashless transactions by uploading “Bison Bucks” to your wristband, creating a seamless navigation of all the food/beverage and merchandise options. Furthermore, the debut of additional boutique concessions at Oyster Lands and Cocktail Lands provided a reprieve from the long lines at food trucks, booths and beer stands for the mature palette.\n\nEven the structure and pace of this year’s Outside Lands schedule felt more conducive to less park-length traversing, with each stage focusing more on specific genres and demographics. There are still certain aspects that could use improvement, such as an increased availability of trash receptacles, bathroom options and crowd control at the festival’s entrance, but the issues that Outside Lands faced this year were no different or more overbearing than any other large-scale production.\n\nNow nine years on the circuit, the Bay Area’s premiere destination for festival revelers has definitely matured to an impressive standard in the live music business. As Outside Lands continues to set the bar high thanks to its innovative features, top-notch billing and overall experience, here are our favorite moments from 2016.\n\nTOP SETS:\n\nHeadliner: LCD Soundsystem\n\nHip-Hop: Anderson .Paak\n\nPop: Grimes\n\nSinger-Songwriter: Lana Del Rey\n\nRock: FOALS\n\nEDM: Zedd\n\nJazz: Kamasi Washington\n\nExperimental: Air\n\nBreakthrough artist: Jidenna\n\nLocal act: Down and Outlaws\n\nHeineken Dome: Warren G & E-40 (pop-up performance)\n\nOUTSIDE LANDS 2016 AWARDS:\n\nBiggest Crowd: Chance the Rapper\n\nIn one of the few transcendent moments of the weekend, a set that had everyone throughout the fairgrounds hyped into an anticipatory frenzy, Chance the Rapper performed at the Lands End stage on Sunday afternoon for easily the largest crowd of the entire weekend. Even those who stood their ground through Third Eye Blind’s preceding set felt the drastic change in both crowd size and personal space as the polo fields flooded and temperatures rose. Even though Chance could have used this to his advantage and conducted an explosive show, igniting the tightly configured crowd into a combustive state, he instead took his fans “to church” with a spiritually centered gospel set, making sure everyone was attentive and of course, that “his part” resonated among the masses.\n\nHonorable Mention: Lana Del Rey, J. Cole\n\nMost Magical Outside Lands Moment: Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem\n\nOne of the biggest questions on everyone’s mind coming into Outside Lands was, “Who were Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem?” For those who knew, it was, “How in the hell were the Muppets going to fill a Sunday slot on the main stage?” Because the band had never played a show of such magnitude or outside the context of a TV/film studio, no one had any clue what to expect during this early-afternoon slot. Though some festivalgoers (mistakenly) decided to forego the experience altogether, those present will not forget the incredible feat that Another Planet Entertainment and Jim Henson Enterprises were able to pull off for what was one of the most emotionally nostalgic, blissfully complex and once-in-a-lifetime festival performances maybe ever. The Muppet house band both effortlessly managed to pluck the heartstrings of multiple generations of fans while delivering the most conceptually beautiful “love letter” to the city of SF, blanketing the grounds in a sea of love and collective euphoria for a brief, yet unforgettable moment. Relive the full performance here.\n\nHonorable Mention: Big Boi’s set at Heineken Dome (pop-up performance), Jason Isabel performing with Ryan Adams\n\nFunniest Stage Banter: Ryan Adams and The Shining\n\nKnown to be quite the comedian with his sassy stage banter and on-the-spot ad libs, Ryan Adams and his backing band, The Shining, catered to the Bay Area audience by revisiting a moment from his 2014 Hardly Strictly Bluegrass set with a rousing reprise of “3 Balloons”. He not only called out his attending family’s and audience members’ concert etiquette faux pas, but he also mentioned his annoyance with the bass of Major Lazer’s simultaneous set as well as referenced the standout beacon of this year’s festival, which was hoisted up by a group of super fans watching from the crowd. Check out it here.\n\nHonorable Mention: Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem, Lionel Richie\n\nMost Jaw-Dropping Performance: Peaches\n\nFor those familiar with the raunchy revelry that a Peaches show entails, we were front and center when the pro-sex powerhouse took the Panhandle stage on Saturday. As for novice audience members or anyone really within the general vicinity during the set, this festival performance was one that frontwoman Merrill Nisker was determined to make sure would be burned into our Outside Lands memories for life. Somewhat of a crossbreed between live sex show and avant-garde performance art, Peaches paired hard-hitting bass lines with spitfire lyrics and a stage show of elaborately X-rated costumes and choreography that left the crowd on one hand speechless and on the other frantically screaming for more.\n\nHonorable Mention: Grimes, The Claypool Lennon Delirium\n\nBest GastroMagic Moment: Skew It on the Bar B with Big Boi, Animal’s Jon Shook & Vinny Dotolo and State Bird’s Stuart Brioza\n\nOn the third and final day of Outside Lands, most attendees were camped out at their favorite stage, decompressing from the first two days of excitement and settling in to watch the final performances of the weekend. But if you happened to be one of the few wandering through the Choco Lands overpass or happened to remember Big Boi’s scheduled performance at the GastroMagic stage, you were in for a treat. Those present in the intimate crowd not only got a mini set of both Outkast and solo hits from the vivacious emcee, but they also got samples of some of the most sought-after BBQ shrimp in the Bay Area while listening to remixed versions of each song that incorporated the word “shrimp” into every chorus. Hilariously ridiculous and insanely delicious, those present may never hear those songs performed the same way again. In fact, we’re still giggling and singing “I like the way you shrimp” days later.\n\nHonorable Mention: Beignets and Bounce Brunch (with Big Freedia and Brenda’s Soul Food), Shark Bites (with Jauz, Mother of Pearl and Guittard Chocolate Company)\n\nMost “Thirst-Inducing” Performers of the Weekend: Big Gram’s Sarah Barthel, Miguel\n\nWorst Decisions of the Weekend: The girl who climbed the windmill during J. Cole’s set and fell (watch here), deciding to bring a bag with you to the festival\n\nBest Totems: The Red Balloon\n\nHonorable Mention: Rick & Morty, Stranger Things Dustin\n\nBiggest Festival Wear Trend of 2016: Hipster Bandito\n\nHonorable Mention: Animal-themed onesies, flower crowns/bedazzled body parts\n\nBest “Taste of the Bay” Menu Item: Bacon Bacon CA BBQ Bacon Burritos\n\nBest Adult Beverage: Elixir’s Whatamelon Cocktail\n\nBest Non-Alcoholic Nectar of the Gods: Straw’s Basil Strawberry Lemonade\n\nBest Festival Feature: Cocktail Lands\n\nBest Way to Waste Time Between Sets: PayPal Video Game Arcade\n\nOVERHEARD AT OUTSIDE LANDS 2016:\n\nThe best directly stated and heard in passing at the festival.\n\n“An empty bag is still a bag!” – crowd members policing the “no-bag” entry lines to the festival\n\n“Is this the Trail of Tears section of Outside Lands?” – crowd members while passing through Choco Lands\n\n“I’m in the Upside Down …” – Day 3 entry ways to the festival\n\n“Hurry up, run! The flower crowns are coming, the flower crowns are coming!” – crowd members exiting the Twin Peaks stage area before Lana Del Rey\n\n“I must’ve missed the goth/bandito appropriation memo …” – in reference to this year’s style trends\n\n“Meet me at the Red Balloon!” – various lost attendees throughout the grounds\n\n“Tits out for Radiohead!” – an ambitious crowd member on Saturday night\n\n“Jesus, Rachel!” – in reference to “basic bitch” behavior/clothing choices throughout the weekend\n\n“I be on that shrimp tonight, straight up on that shrimp tonight, I be on that straight up on that, I be on that shrimp tonight.” – Big Boi during his GastroMagic performance\n\n“Mmmm, porcini doughnuts …” (Homer Simpson voice) – mimicking nearby food vendors\n\n“Who even is Lionel Richie … oh, Nicole Richies’ dad?!” – mortifyingly clueless audience member\n\n“We’re all Diana Ross!” – Lionel Richie in reference to his “special guest”\n\n“We’re all gonna die, whatcha’ gonna do about it?” – Sufjan Stevens contemplating life on stage\n\n“This is the best moment of my life, can I live in an LCD set?” – enthused crowd member\n\n“I’d follow you to hell …” – a member of a large group attempting to traverse the grounds\n\n“But my mom and dad are in there …” – festivalgoers attempting to jump the line entering the festival\n\n“You know San Francisco has totally changed, like I went back to my place on the pier and it was taken over by sea lions, like totally gentrified!” – Janus during Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem’s set\n\nPhotos by Pedro Paredes // Written by Nik Crossman //\n\nSasquatch! Music Festival //\n\nGorge Amphitheatre – Quincy, WA\n\nMay 22nd-25th, 2015 //\n\n2015 marked the 14th successful year of Sasquatch! Music Festival thanks to a hunch followed by a Pacific Northwest concert promoter. Back in 2002, when the U.S. festival scene was an infant, Adam Zacks decided to try his luck with an untapped market and bring the festival experience to the Pacific Northwest. The single-day festival sold out its first year, quickly validating Zacks’ hunch and setting the stage for one of the world’s most unique festival experiences.\n\nEmbracing the culture of the Pacific Northwest, Sasquatch! caters to the growing breed of indie-centric fans caring just as much about the festival experience (if not more) than the music itself. Over the last 14 years, Sasquatch! has become a “must-do” for festivalgoers and continues to impress with a stellar lineup playing against the majestic backdrop of The Gorge.\n\nSo, when I fell into tickets the week before the festival, I jumped at the opportunity to see some of my favorite bands jam out at Mother Nature’s cathedral. Having no campsite and no ride to/from the festival, I posted a Hail Mary message on the Sasquatch! Facebook page, asking a bunch of strangers to take me in as one of their own … and it worked! That’s when I realized Sasquatch! is more than the music — it’s coming together as a community to lend a hand and help a fellow human.\n\nThe two-hour drive from Seattle to The Gorge wet the appetite for the alluring landscapes to come. My two new friends and I arrived Friday afternoon, just in time to set up camp and catch the sun fall behind the mountainous horizon.\n\nFriday\n\nKicking off the festival, Friday’s lineup included the sounds of Ought, Mother Mother, Gogol Bordello, Action Bronson, Angel Olsen, AlunaGeorge, Little Dragon, Of Monsters and Men, Sleater-Kinney and of course, Flume, the 23-year-old Australian DJ/producer who has been taking the electronic music scene by storm since dropping his debut album in 2012. Despite a little rain early Friday night, the festival was in full swing and the energy inside the grounds built on itself with each performance. The unique sound of Little Dragon had the crowd flowing together, sprinkling in rumors and heightened anticipation for SBTRK‘s set on Sunday night. “Will Little Dragon come out for ‘Wildfire’?!” By the time Flume dropped his first beat at the Bigfoot Stage, the energy was palpable and everyone could feel why this young DJ was chosen to close out Friday night.\n\nSaturday\n\nWith the loving melodies of Milo Green rushing over the Bigfoot State by mid-day, Twenty One Pilots picked up the tempo with an animated performance on the Sasquatch Stage, where the dynamic duo commanded their early-day crowd. Sylvan Esso threw down a Bigfoot dance party when their hit “Coffee” ignited the entire crowd to dance along with the ever-so-strange Amelia Meath on stage. Chromeo‘s love for themselves may only be surpassed by the massive turnout the funky duo brought to Sasquatch! main stage early in the evening. Their funk-tastic sound and vibrant stage presence was perfectly timed to set the stage for following acts like Glass Animals, Kiesza, Modest Mouse, ODESZA and Spoon. Kiesza took the El Chupacabra tent by stormy lights and surprisingly produced more vigor into the crowd than the Seattle duo ODESZA, who seemed to play a more mellow version of themselves than most are familiar with. Just down the hill from ODESZA, 22-year-old rock band Spoon spilled heavy guitar riffs over the crowd and presented an alternative ending to Saturday’s electronic scene. For the second night in a row, Sasquatch! closed out the night with a young, up-and-coming electronic act, staying true to their committed mix bag of new and established performers.\n\nSunday\n\nMilky Chance wooed the crowd at the Sasquatch Stage in the late afternoon on Sunday with their unique electro-folk-reggae sounds, lead vocalists Clemens Rehbein’s deep, melodic vocals and the magnificent backdrop of The Gorge. Shortly after Milky Chance stirred the crowd, the unlikely future of rap, Kate Tempest, lived up to her reputation as a force to be reckoned with while showering the crowd with positive affirmations. The sun started setting behind The Gorge while the idiosyncratic St. Vincent moved so distinctly across the stage like an elegant robot, convincing the crowd they made the right choice. The sultry vixen Lana Del Rey attracted one of the largest crowds to the Sasquatch Stage on Sunday night. While Del Rey is not as active as some of her siren peers, her presence was not lacking. Captivating the masses while her white dress blew in the wind, Del Rey abandoned the stage to walk among her amorous fans before leaving her set early to pass the spotlight to an epic instrumental jam session by her band. Madeon, the 21-year-old child prodigy, proved himself once again in the El Chupacabra late on Sunday night when he led the crowd on a fantastic journey of impeccable mashups and psychedelic lights.\n\nMonday\n\nMonday was the last day of the four-day festival, and the crowds started to thin between the intermittent rain clouds playing hide and seek with the sun. Monday was also the day of drums, at least in the El Chupacabra. Armed only with a wolf mask, laptop and two drumsticks, Slow Magic kicked off the night in the Spanish-flavored tent with a one-of-a-kind experience. With his rare combination of synth and live drumming, Slow Magic is re-imagining electronic music as we know it. Not far behind the solo drumming DJ were the three-piece veterans The Glitch Mob. The trio conquered the stage with their new musical element “The Blade,” which combines both lights and instruments into something that looks like it came out of a space-age movie scene. Drumming their way into the bones of the crowd, The Glitch Mob elicited some of the most hands-in-the-air praise I saw all weekend. They closed out Sasquatch! with a bang, literally.\n\nCamping\n\nThe Sasquatch! campgrounds were far from organized, which presents pros and cons, pending what you’re after. The grueling trek from general camping to the grounds made going to the festival more of a commitment than many appreciated. After a few journeys to and from, premium camping seemed well worth the investment. The wheel-and-spoke layout of the grounds made it easy to find other campsites and stumble into the food trucks for a late-night zombie dog. The camping community itself was friendly and full of love for each other, inviting neighbors to play beer darts and other awesome lawn games.\n\nActivities\n\nDespite the loving nature of the campers, the Sasquatch! campgrounds lacked the festival-sponsored activities so many of us have come to appreciate and expect like morning yoga classes at Coachella and personal development workshops at Lightning in a Bottle (LIB). The Sasquatch! community inside the grounds attempted to provide this outlet with a vintage arcade, self-defense demonstrations and community dance parties, but they fell short relative to other festivals. One could also argue the lack of art installations throughout the Sasquatch! grounds presents an area of improvement for the festival. That is, until they’re reminded of the natural art blanketing all of The Gorge. Well done, Mother Nature!\n\nSustainability\n\nWhile LIB has been dubbed as “The Greenest Festival in America,” you’d think all festivals would have a strong commitment to sustainably responsible business practices by now. This was an oversight for Sasquatch!, as recycling bins were nowhere to be found and trash cans were often overflowing — a pretty easy, yet significant improvement that needs to be made.\n\nAh, year-end lists — they’re an exercise in subjectivity and personal experience if there has ever been one. But what better way is there to learn from each other and discover some great new music while capping off the year and beginning anew?\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2014.\n\nThe 25 Best Live Music Acts of 2014\n\nShowbams’ Top 50 Albums of 2014\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2014:\n\nMike Frash // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. Darkside at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – January 24th\n\nLooking at my top five shows list for 2014, it appears I favor the weird, ya know, the good weird. This Darkside performance, the only SF show ever (for now) since Nicolas Jaar and Dave Harrington have put the project on indefinite hold, had patrons at The Fillmore in SF breathing and moving in unison. There was a magical feeling in the air as the hybrid of electronic and organic played out wonderfully with the duo tipping their hat to the past and setting a new standard for the brave new future of live music.\n\n2. Panda Bear at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – May 22nd\n\n3. tUnE-yArDs at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – June 6th\n\n4. Phish at MGM Grand – Las Vegas, NV – October 31st\n\n5. Volcano Choir at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – January 21st\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. Run the Jewels – Run the Jewels 2\n\nEver since Jamie and Mikey blew my mind performing Run the Jewels almost in its entirety at The Independent in August of 2013, I’ve been a loyal RTJ soldier. And without taking a break, El Producto and Killer Mike stepped it up to an even higher plateau with their production precision, an uncanny balance of fun and intense, while lyrically honing more on the important issues of our time. Sensing the unstoppable momentum, Run the Jewels are already heading back into the studio for Run the Jewels 3. When Mike was recently asked if they’d continue to name their albums numerically, he said “Why not?!? Zeppelin did it!” Exactly. Say it with me now: Festival headliners circa 2016?\n\n2. The War on Drugs – Lost in the Dream\n\n3. D’Angelo – Black Messiah\n\n4. Aphex Twin – Syro\n\n5. The Antlers – Familiars\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. Sturgill Simpson – “Turtles All the Way Down”\n\nThis is country music turned on its head, while staying mostly true to the hallmarks of the genre. Lyrically subversive while instrumentally emotive to the core, this song kept me coming back throughout 2014. It’s positive message of love winning over all else is certainly timeless, but when was the last time you heard a country tune tell a story of mind over matter transcendence? “There’s a gateway in our minds that leads somewhere out there, far beyond this place / Where reptile aliens made of light, cut you up and pull out all your pain.” Stirgill Simpson is as progressive as you can get within the realm of Americana, urging the listener to both think and feel.\n\n2. St. Vincent – “Digital Witness”\n\n3. Future Islands – “Seasons (Waiting on You)”\n\n4. FKA twigs – “Two Weeks”\n\n5. Flying Lotus – “Never Catch Me” feat. Kendrick Lamar\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. Nine Inch Nails & Soundgarden at Red Rocks Amphitheatre – Morrison, CO – July 21st\n\nWhat a dream come true. Having the opportunity to see two of my favorite childhood bands at one of the best venues in the country would be hard to beat any year, let alone in 2014. Sharing the bill with Soundgarden on this tour, Trent Reznor made the most of a minimalist stage setup and trimmed-down lineup of sidekicks. Of the four shows (Red Rocks, Chula Vista, Irvine and Hollywood) I saw on this tour, this one felt particularly special. If this was one of the last times I ever got to see Nine Inch Nails perform live, it was a night I will never forget.\n\n2. Jack White at The Fonda Theatre – Los Angeles, CA – June 10th\n\n3. Cinquanta featuring Puscifer, A Perfect Circle and Failure at The Greek Theatre – Los Angeles, CA – May 10th\n\n4. Queens of the Stone Age at The Forum – Los Angeles, CA – October 31st\n\n5. Tool at Valley View Casino Center – San Diego, CA – March 16th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. The Black Keys – Turn Blue\n\nAkron’s favorite rockers answered the call this year, following up their Grammy-winning album El Camino with arguably their most ambitious effort to date — especially when you consider the turmoil that surrounded Dan Auerbach’s life at the time of its recording. Over the last five years, the Keys have become one of rock’s biggest bands, but they haven’t stopped taking risks as a result. Turn Blue dabbles in a myriad of styles, from the psychedelic sound of Pink Floyd on its opening track “Weight of Love” to the hip-hop groove on “10 Lovers.” For as many critics as they have, Auerbach and Patrick Carney have come a long way since their early years as strictly a blues duo.\n\n2. The War on Drugs – Lost in the Dream\n\n3. Jack White – Lazaretto\n\n4. Aphex Twin – Syro\n\n5. Death from Above 1979 – The Physical World\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. Jack White – “High Ball Stepper”\n\nJack White seems to be on another level these days. The former White Stripe has grown into one of rock ‘n’ roll’s most exciting talents, and this blues-heavy, instrumental track showcases that better than any other offering on Lazaretto. White’s ferocious guitar riffs dominate the tune, taking listeners on an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. And when he plays “High Ball Stepper” live, the song takes on a new whole life of its own.\n\n2. Foo Fighters – “Something for Nothing”\n\n3. Interpol – “All the Rage Back Home”\n\n4. TV on the Radio – “Happy Idiot”\n\n5. Tycho – “Awake”\n\nSteven Wandrey // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. Jack White at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium – San Francisco, CA – August 22nd\n\nFrom the dramatic curtain drop that slammed into high-octane rock, this show never let off the gas. Even with a bum ankle, Jack White stalked the stage and held power over the crowd. When the slowest moments of a show are White Stripes ballads that you’re giddy to hear and the other half of the show is headbanging, guitar-slinging rock, it’s easy to see how this show cemented itself as the best of 2014.\n\n2. Atomic Bomb! The Music of William Onyeabor at The Warfield – San Francisco, CA – May 6th\n\n3. The War on Drugs at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – April 1st\n\n4. Run the Jewels at Mezzanine – San Francisco, CA – November 14th\n\n5. Duck Sauce at Outside Lands Music Festival – August 9th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. Flying Lotus – You’re Dead!\n\nThis album makes me feel like I’m actually traveling through the underworld to the land of the dead. From front to back, the first thing that caught me about this album was its consistent message. Steven Ellison has an inviting sense of storytelling that’s infused with hip-hop but touches on an array of different music styles, involving a star-studded cast of guests, including Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat and Snoop Dog. I have a feeling Flying Lotus is on the forefront of creative hip-hop and that this album will prove to be influential down the line. More importantly, I just love listening to it. Taking wild turns from frenetic to serene, listening to this album from start to finish is a journey.\n\n2. Aphex Twin – Syro\n\n3. Run the Jewels – Run the Jewels 2\n\n4. Future Islands – Singles\n\n5. Tweedy – Sukierae\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. Run the Jewels – “Oh My Darling Don’t Cry”\n\nThe minimalist production and deep, rumbling bass frequencies have helped this track become my No. 1 listened to on the album and also No. 1 for the year. The complimentary flow that El-P and Killer Mike have together is on display in this track. This cut has infected my brain like a virus (the good kind?), and I just can’t get enough.\n\n2. Future Islands – “Seasons (Waiting on You)”\n\n3. Sam Smith – “I’m Not the Only One”\n\n4. Flying Lotus – “Never Catch Me” (feat. Kendrick Lamar)\n\n5. Perfume Genius – “Queen”\n\nKevin Quandt // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. Future Islands at Coachella Music and Arts Festival, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 12th\n\nIt’s been a banner year for the Baltimore darlings we have grown to love as Future Islands. Breaking through the underground touring circuit to being a highly sought-after festival act was quick and clean as the passionate stage performance of Samuel Harrington could not be ignored by growing audiences. A packed Gobi Tent was eating from the frontman’s palm as Herrington poured himself out on stage, belting out a set heavy on new tracks and old favorites. It was a pivotal point where both the band and audience knew that Future Islands had arrived at the next stage of their career.\n\n2. The Cure at BottleRock Napa Valley – Napa, CA – May 30th\n\n3. Phish at MGM Grand Arena – Las Vegas, NV – October 31st\n\n4. Connan Mockasin at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – May 15th\n\n5. Deerhoof at Great American Music Hall – San Francisco, CA – November 18th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. The War on Drugs – Lost in the Dream\n\nAdam Granduciel had one helluva 2014 to brag about. His third studio album Lost in the Dream was an overwhelming success, and all for good reason as the lush waves of rock swell over the listener like a warm Christmas sweater, just less ugly than the one you wore to that one party. “Under the Pressure” opens this release in epic fashion and does not let up from there. Guitar rock is not dead!\n\n2. Todd Terje – It’s Album Time\n\n3. Run the Jewels – Run the Jewels 2\n\n4. D’Angelo – Black Messiah\n\n5. White Fence – For the Recently Found Innocent\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. Flying Lotus – “Never Catch Me” (feat. Kendrick Lamar)\n\nSteven Ellison’s left-field meditation on death, as demonstrated on 2014’s release You’re Dead!, is not for everyone and is more about the full album than the sum of its parts (tracks). However, there is one shining beacon of a collaboration that could not be cast aside in the form of “Never Catch Me”. The partnership of one of the hottest MCs with one of the most sought-after producers was meant to be a brutally infectious slice of off-kilter street music.\n\n2. Caribou – “Can’t Do Without You”\n\n3. Future Islands – “Seasons (Waiting on You)”\n\n4. Beck – “Blue Moon”\n\n5. Ariel Pink – “Put Your Number in My Phone”\n\nPete Mauch // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. Phish at MGM Grand – Las Vegas, NV – October 31st\n\nPhish has made the tradition of covering other artists albums on Halloween, and this year they completely outdid themselves by covering essentially an album of only narrative and spooky sounds. The Disney-produced album The Thrilling and Chilling Sounds of the Taunted House was turned into a rock opera of sorts as Trey and company worked through completely new songs based off just minimal sounds, but the night didn’t just end there. The band played this rock opera sandwiched between two very strong sets of original Phish songs that could have held its own alone.\n\n2. Lettuce’s Late Night in Red Barn at Summer Camp Music Festival – Chillicothe, IL – May 22nd\n\n3. Future Islands at Coachella Music and Arts Festival, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 12th\n\n4. Ryan Adams at The Fox Theater Pomona – Pomona, CA – October 11th\n\n5. Todd Terje at FYF Fest – Los Angeles – August 24th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. Ryan Adams – Ryan Adams\n\nWhen someone as prolific as Ryan Adams puts out a new record, you buy that record and you listen intently. The songs in his first self-titled album may seem simple at first listen, but they stay with you in the back of your mind until you just can’t take it and you re-listen again and again. This is exactly how what I’ve been doing the past few months since the release. Songs like “Gimme Something Good” and “Am I Safe” prove once again that Adams is still on top of his game.\n\n2. The War on Drugs – Lost in the Dream\n\n3. moe. – No Guts, No Glory\n\n4. Todd Terje – It’s Album Time\n\n5. Greensky Bluegrass – If Sorrows Swim\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. Future Islands – “Seasons (Waiting on You)”\n\n“People change / You know but some people never do / You know when people change, they gain a piece but they lose one too.” These lyrics are so uplifting and real, and the music to accompany these amazing lyrics ties the emotion perfectly together.\n\n2. The War on Drugs – “Under the Pressure”\n\n3. The Barr Brothers – “Come in the Water”\n\n4. Temples – “Shelter Song”\n\n5. Caribou – “Can’t Do Without You”\n\nPedro Paredes // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. Darkside at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – January 24th\n\nThe album Nicolas Jaar and Dave Harrington put together in 2013 was a delight for the ears, but with the show they played at The Fillmore, they were going after every sense in your body. Jaar once said that Darkside’s music was more experiential rather than musical, and they surely succeeded in delivering one of the best musical experiences to all the lucky attendants on that cold January night.\n\n2. Future Islands at The Chapel – San Francisco, CA – April 10th\n\n3. St. Vincent at The Fox Theater Oakland – Oakland, CA – March 22nd\n\n4. James Blake at The Chapel – San Francisco, CA – December 7th\n\n5. Old Crow Medicine Show at The Masonic – San Francisco, CA – September 20th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. Beck – Morning Phase\n\nBeck’s Morning Phase follows the same breezy style as Sea Change, but the latter’s serenity seems to come from darker places. Morning Phase is, as the title suggests, a bit brighter and sets the tone for all the good things yet to come.\n\n2. Run the Jewels – Run the Jewels 2\n\n3. Real Estate – Atlas\n\n4. The War on Drugs – Lost in the Dream\n\n5. Perfume Genius – Too Bright\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. alt-J – “Nara”\n\nIt is hard to isolate “Nara” as the best song of Alt-J’s latest album This is All Yours since the story told in it is not exclusive to that song and it comes back in different sections of the album (as well as in some of the musical arrangements). But “Nara”, a song about love, deserves to be listened again and again. The 2:58 mark is bliss to my ears.\n\n2. tUnE-yArDs – “Water Fountain”\n\n3. Run the Jewels – “Love Again”\n\n4. Perfume Genius – “Fool”\n\n5. Angel Olsen – “Hi-Five”\n\nAndrew Pohl // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. Nine Inch Nails & Soundgarden at Shoreline Amphitheatre – Mountain View, CA – August 24th\n\nI had never seen either band live before and based on my experience, it was like they had never broken up or aged since the ’90s. Amazing stage/light shows to go along with what was hands down my most eagerly anticipated show of the year.\n\n2. Cibo Matto at Slim’s – San Francisco, CA – February 26th\n\n3. American Football at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – December 12th\n\n4. Failure at Great American Music Hall – San Francisco, CA – May 14th\n\n5. Crosses at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – March 30th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. St. Vincent – St. Vincent\n\nThis album comes off like a chameleon, with many shifts but always staying very characteristically St. Vincent. I feel that she is one of the more important artists to come around over the last few years, and I am excited to see what she does next.\n\n2. Nothing – Guilty of Everything\n\n3. Beck – Morning Phase\n\n4. Fugazi – First Demo\n\n5. The War on Drugs – Lost in the Dream\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. Spoon – “Do You”\n\nSpoon have a knack for throwing a good toe tapper in their albums. This song is short and sweet, and you cannot help but get caught up in its infectiousness.\n\n2. Ryan Adams – “Give Me Something Good”\n\n3. St. Vincent – “Prince Johnny”\n\n4. TV on the Radio – “Could You”\n\n5. Nothing – “Bent Nail”\n\nJustin Yee // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1) Future Islands at South by Southwest (Cheer Up Charlie’s) – Austin, TX – March 13th\n\n2) Arcade Fire at Shoreline Amphitheatre – Mountain View, CA – July 30th\n\n3) Chromeo at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – April 12th\n\n4) James Blake at The Chapel – San Francisco, CA – December 7th\n\n5) Outkast at Treasure Island Music Festival – San Francisco, CA – October 18th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1) Future Islands – Singles\n\n2) The War on Drugs – Lost in the Dream\n\n3) ODESZA – In Return\n\n4) Flying Lotus – You’re Dead!\n\n5) Caribou – Our Love\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1) Future Islands – “Seasons (Waiting on You)”\n\n2) Chromeo – “Come Alive” feat. Toro y Moi\n\n3) Flying Lotus – “Never Catch Me” feat. Kendrick Lamar\n\n4) Chet Faker – “1998”\n\n5) Mac Demarco – “Let Her Go”\n\nEric Shaden // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1. James Blake at The Chapel – San Francisco, CA – December 7th\n\nI feel bad telling friends about how great this show was since so few people were able to get tickets. An intimate venue hosting such a phenomenal artist was a no-brainer for my top pick. James covered hits from his albums as well as debuted new tracks and an incredible interlude of house jams. I just wish more friends could have seen this!\n\n2. Chromeo at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – April 12th\n\n3. Todd Terje at FYF Fest – Los Angeles, CA – August 24th\n\n4. tUnE-yArDs at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – June 6th\n\n5. Holy Ghost! at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art – San Francisco, CA – April 30th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. Run the Jewels – Run the Jewels 2\n\nWhat else can be said about this album that hasn’t been covered already? An outstanding sequel to Run the Jewels that expands on the original with top-notch production and punishing delivery from El-P and Killer Mike. Without a doubt my top choice of the year.\n\n2. Syd Arthur – A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble\n\n3. D’Angelo – Black Messiah\n\n4. Sinkane – Mean Love\n\n5. Todd Terje – It’s Album Time\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. D’Angelo – “Sugah Daddy”\n\nI imagine D’Angelo coming back with his long-awaited album in December showed which writers/blogs/etc. wrote their “Best of the Year” lists early. His style of soulful R&B is sorely needed, and “Sugah Daddy” is my favorite from the album. Looking forward to his tour in 2015!\n\n2. Caribou – “Our Love”\n\n3. Aphex Twin – “minipops 67 [120.2]”\n\n4. Jungle – “Time”\n\n5. Jamie xx – “Sleep Sound”\n\nBenjamin Wallen // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2014\n\n1.

MIA at Shoreline Amphitheatre for BFD 2014 – Mountain View, CA – June 1st\n\nIt had been four years since I saw MIA live and even though I’d prefer to see her play her own show rather than a set at a music festival, I was super excited to see her at BFD last summer. It was the first time in nearly 10 years that my cousin and I went to LIFE105’s annual summer show together. We lucked out and upgraded our tickets just in time to see MIA’s performance. Both of us were out of our seats, singing and dancing along to every song as soon as her set started. I was beside myself as MIA herself made her way off the stage, up into the seats of the venue and stopped near our row to spit lyrics as fans gathered and danced around her, myself included. I still can’t believe I danced with MIA!\n\n2. OK Go at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – July 16th\n\n3. Die Antwoord at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – May 22nd\n\n4. Sylvan Esso at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – June 6th\n\n5. MS MR at The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – April 15th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2014\n\n1. Sylvan Esso – Sylvan Esso\n\nWhen I covered Sylvan Esso at The Fillmore earlier this year (when they opened for tUnE-yArDs), I had no idea who they were but ended up leaving the show a fan. Their self-titled debut album is an uplifting mix of danceable electropop tracks and indie rock that’s easy to lose yourself in. Their sparkly, layered and melodic sounds translate well whether you’re listening to the album or seeing them live. Sylvan Esso is one of three albums I bought in 2014, and it’s been on repeat ever since I picked it up.\n\n2. Glass Animals – Zaba\n\n3. Die Antwoord – Donker Mag\n\n4. Iggy Azalea – The New Classic\n\n5. First Aid Kit – Stay Gold\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2014\n\n1. Tove Lo – “Habits (Stay High)”\n\nI really enjoy the simple percussion-driven melody and voluptuous vocals of Tove Lo’s hit single “Habits (Stay High)”. The subtle, yet engaging buildup to her belting, emotionally-charged lyrics has me singing along and turning it up every time I hear it on the radio. While it is very catchy, it’s not a super dancey song. However, it is a great go-to for karaoke.\n\n2. Die Antwoord – “Rat Trap 666”\n\n3. Sylvan Esso – “Hey Mami”\n\n4. First Aid Kit – “My Silver Lining”\n\n5. The Dead Weather – “Buzzkill(er)”\n\nSometimes the more music you listen to, the feeling of missing out on a song or an album can make you feel a little neurotic. You simply can’t give every piece of good music it’s proper due. So when it comes to picking your favorite songs, a safe bet is to pick the songs that not only soundtracked your year but also helped define it.\n\nShowbams presents our Contributor top tracks of 2013. What are your favorite tracks of this dwindling year? Holler with links in the comment section…\n\nMike Frash // Founder, Editor, Columnist // @MikeFrash\n\n01. James Blake – “Retrograde”\n\n“Retrograde” perfectly represents the state of music in 2013, providing an amalgamation of cutting edge electronic, bass & R&B sensibilities. Also, the track is hauntingly memorable — How many contemporaries can use their pitch-shifting croon-hum as a low melodic layer like this? Lyrically, manipulative seduction is the center piece as Blake propositions his subject, asking to “show me where you fit.” Retrograde means ‘moving backwards’, and the theme is splendidly represented in the song’s payoff through elongated synth that modulates enough to sound like slow degradation.\n\n02. Disclosure – “When A Fire Starts To Burn”\n\nThe mantra of the year, “When A Fire Starts To Burn” can ignite a party or help work get done faster. Somehow the motivational speech sample never tires, and it’s one of the only samples on Settle, proving the keen production sense Guy and Howard Lawrence have ingrained in them. The simple four on the floor house beat slightly evolves every 16 bars, allowing the sample to dominate throughout. An instant classic, it’s a track that uses long-used underground themes and brings them to the forefront as Disclosure continues to explode with popularity.\n\n03. Arcade Fire – “Afterlife”\n\nThe penultimate song from Reflektor explicitly stares death in the face and dares you to live. More than any other song on the record, “Afterlife” successfully digs into the idea of what happens when we die in Arcade Fire’s serious, intense style. The song offers multiple rhetorical questions that function as a challenge. Our time is finite, and love should be the focus. “It’s just an afterlife with you…”\n\n04. FOALS – “Milk & Black Spiders”\n\nSo much of FOALS’ music is about being on the verge of total loss, although the message is almost always vague. A far cry from yelling at “Cassius” that she’s “second best”, “Milk & Black Spiders” centers on the idea of confidence in finding the right mate and openly admitting it. Found in an album full of potential top tracks, this cut contains the best moment of the album at about 3:30. Is it hyperbole to consider this one of the most euphoric crescendo of all time?\n\n05. my bloody valentine – “in another way”\n\nTo be truly understood, my bloody valentine needs to be felt, not only heard. To experience MBV live or in the comfort of your living space like the Maxwell Guy is encouraged (although it may be too late to catch them live). The sound is jarring at first, but upon adapting to the volume level, “in another way” transforms into magnificent hypnotism once the first major chords hit. It’s like a persistent, awesome airplane is taking off in your face, in a very good way…\n\n06. Baths – “No Eyes”\n\n07. Vampire Weekend – “Hannah Hunt”\n\n08. Kanye West feat. Frank Ocean – “New Slaves”\n\n09. The National – “I Need My Girl”\n\n10. Rhye – “Open”\n\n11. Volcano Choir – “Byegone”\n\n12. Phosphorescent – “Song For Zula”\n\n13. Run the Jewels – “Job Well Done (feat. Until the Ribbon Breaks)”\n\n14. Mount Kimbie – “Made To Stray”\n\n15. Kurt Vile – “Wakin on a Pretty Day”\n\n16. Darkside – “Paper Trails”\n\n17. Autre Ne Veut – “Play by Play”\n\n18. Jon Hopkins – “Breath This Air”\n\n19. Haim – “Falling”\n\n20. Bill Callahan – “Small Plane”\n\nMolly Kish // Artist Relations Manager, Columnist // @MollyKish\n\n01. Vampire Weekend – “Unbelievers”\n\nFar from the New England prep rock of their previous two albums, the boys of Vampire Weekend explore new territory both in songwriting and soundscape on their 2013 release Modern Vampires of the City. This breakout pop gem explores the frivolity of faith, dissecting spirituality in the context of a contemporary domestic relationship. Paying homage to blissful rockabilly melodies executed by such greats as Buddy Holly and the Crickets and Jerry Lee Lewis, Vampire Weekend put a current spin on an archetypal pop formula, composing easily one of the best tracks of 2013.\n\n02. Big Black Delta – “Side of the Road”\n\nJonathan Bates, of Mellowdrone fame, delivers one of the catchiest terrestrial dance jams of 2013 with the lead single off of his debut album, Big Black Delta. A solo project, Bates performs the entire song through layers of modified vocals, electronic improvisation and innovatively tracked percussion. He succeeds in developing an addictive one man dance party that’s just as entertaining to see live as it is to listen to on record and calls for near immediate loops of repetitive play.\n\n03. Disclosure -“F For You”\n\nUK sibling duo Disclosure deliver one of the hardest hitting and simplistically rendered club hits of 2013 with “F For You.” Stripping away frivolous electronic production, they find success in a modest deep house composition featuring a pulsating baseline, repetitive chorus and a stylistically pert, finger-snapping beat. The song’s sassy subject matter and infectious groove are bound to get any dance floor moving and set the song apart as a standout hit on the band’s 2013 debut album.\n\n04. Yeah Yeah Yeahs – “Sacrilege”\n\nDeparting from their traditionally art punk mold, the Yeah Yeah Yeah’s burst back on the scene with the first single off of their fourth studio album, Mosquito. Highlighting rooted soul riffs and Karen O’s bluesy wails, the beat driven arrangement pays homage to the band’s time spent writing and recording in New Orleans. The track in a fiery choral cameo by the Broadway Inspirational Voices Choir and serves as the band’s rousing call to arms for their alternative counterparts. The song exemplifies the band’s successful feat in retaining some of the genres fearlessness and artistic credulity as well as their willingness to step outside of the convoluted mainstream box.\n\n05. Holy Ghost! – “Dumb Disco Ideas”\n\nOften compared to fellow DFA records’ flagship artist LCD Soundsystem, Holy Ghost! assumed the label’s inherent responsibility of producing the next wave of synth-pop super hits with their 2013 album Dynamics. The most comparable track, coming in the form of this funk laden jam, draws directly from the genre-defining record label’s indisputable formula for discotheque domination. Rhythmically resonating with old and new fans alike, Holy Ghost! seamlessly transitioned into their new reign of the DFA universe with this stand out party anthem that floored live music venues and festival stages, all summer long.\n\n06. Daft Punk – “Get Lucky”\n\n07. Atoms for Peace – “Default”\n\n08. Arcade Fire – “Here Comes the Nighttime”\n\n09. Toro Y Moi – “Say That”\n\n10. Empire of the Sun – “Alive”\n\n11. Cut Copy – “Free Your Mind”\n\n12. STRFKR – “While I’m Alive”\n\n13. Jagwar Ma – “Man I Need”\n\n14. Phoenix – “S.O.S. in Bel Air”\n\n15. Washed Out – “All I Know”\n\n16. Kanye West – “Black Skinhead”\n\n17. CSS – “Into the Sun”\n\n18. Devendra Banhart – “You’re Fine Petting Duck”\n\n19. Wild Belle – “Another Girl”\n\n20. The Strokes – “One Way Trigger”\n\nKevin Quandt // Assistant Editor, Columnist // @KJQuandt\n\n01. Daft Punk – “Get Lucky”\n\nWhen the ‘Song of the Summer’ (sorry “Blurred Lines”) is as thoroughly enjoyable as this interstellar first single off of RAM, you know you won’t get nearly as tired of it as past summertime jams. “Get Lucky” is still is as fresh as the first time it was debuted on a Saturday night at Coachella, eventually ruling airwaves across multiple genres all over the globe. This track has it all; from a space disco groove that rivals any legendary disco jam to the sultry vocals of the multi-talented Pharrell Williams. Was it the single that most fans were expecting? Probably not, but lends even more to the production and writing talent of these two mysterious French robots that most of us know by the name of Daft Punk. Though we haven’t seen how it’ll shake out on stage, if ever, it is sure to be on repeat for the foreseeable future.\n\n02. Foxygen – “No Destruction”\n\nWhat a fun slice of American tinged psych-pop these young San Franciscans delivered this year. Sure this band has had a rough year on the road, but these issues never diminished their stellar sophomore release, spotlighted by this rousing tale of youthful urban life and love. Dylan-esque crooning coupled with phrasing that would make Ray Davies blush lends a nod to some of rocks legends in the form of “No Destruction”. Every listen also shines more light on the storyboard that these lyrics build, adding another key component to Foxygen’s success.\n\n03. FOALS – “My Number”\n\nI’m not sure exactly when FOALS became masters of catchy song structures, but many are happy to hear this British act upping their game to dazzling new heights. The formula of placing the hook early in the track is part of the key, and this is not to mention the amazing returns to said hook while balancing afro-inspired guitar lines, piercing melodies and unpredictable rhythm shifts. “My Number” signifies the next era for FOALS while displaying they are ready to leave the clubs to larger theaters while bearing the banner of Bono-esque grandeur in the face of a changing landscape in popular rock music.\n\n04. King Krule – “Baby Blue”\n\nYoung Archie Marshall has come along way for a 19 year old Brit with a refreshing spin on bedroom-produced darkwave music. Though in all honesty, King Krule can not be defined as he bends genre lines all over his debut LP, 6 Feet Beneath the Moon. Archie’s unique vocal stylings paint a brilliantly simple portrait of love lost over a stripped down production that is akin to the muted style that launched acts like the XX and Toro Y Moi. The baritone delivery pitches and bends on the singer’s whim over gentle guitar flourishes and minimal beat production equally something fully unique. In an age of EDM maximalism, it’s tracks like this that demonstrate the idea of ‘less is more.’\n\n05. London Grammar – “Hey Now”\n\nLondon Grammar may not be an artist that the majority are familiar with, but a head-turning debut LP released in the fall has garnered this trip-hop trio much deserved attention. Hannah Reid’s vocals soar all over this chilled-out track that slowly builds to a mellow peak that could remind you of early Zero 7 (the Sia years). A feature on Disclosure’s album closer and vocal comparisons to Jessie Ware are promising signs for these up-and-comers that understand restraint can be extremely powerful as demonstrated in this powerful single.\n\n06. Arcade Fire – “Afterlife”\n\n07. Parquet Courts – “Stoned and Starving”\n\n08. Palma Violets – “Best of Friends”\n\n09. Kanye West feat. Frank Ocean – “New Slaves”\n\n10. Jake Bugg – “Lightning Bolt”\n\n11. A$AP Ferg feat. A$AP Rocky – “Shabba”\n\n12. HAIM – “The Wire”\n\n13. Queens of the Stone Age – “My God is the Sun”\n\n14. Vampire Weekend – “Diane Young”\n\n15. The National – “Humiliation”\n\n16. Ducktails – “The Flower Lane”\n\n17. Deerhunter – “Dream Captain”\n\n18. Jon Hopkins – “Open Eye Signal”\n\n19. iceage – “Ecstasy”\n\n20. White Fence – “Pink Gorilla”\n\nPete Mauch // Festival Manager & Columnist // @PeteMauch\n\n01. Daft Punk – “Get Lucky”\n\nThe summer anthem is just too good to be denied the number one spot. With Nile Rodgers laying down the funk chords on guitar and Pharrell Williams’s resurgence back on the scene with smooth croons, it gives the song has some serious lasting power.\n\n02. Kurt Vile – “Wakin On a Pretty Day”\n\nBest morning song ever besides Dylan’s “New Morning”? I absolutely love waking up to this song — it’s bright, catchy guitar licks are matched perfectly with Vile’s earnest lyrics about solitude, yet he’s optimistic about this pretty day.\n\n03. FOALS – “My Number”\n\nThis song come firing out of the gates with infectious dance grooves that are nearly impossible to not move your feet to. The hypnotizing multi-guitar work is such a great complement to the vocals on this should-be hit single.\n\n04. Jagwar Ma – “Come Save Me”\n\nIf the Beach Boys started to make electrified, psychedelic dance songs then I suspect it would sound a lot like this. These Australian rockers put together one hell of a dream-like track this year.\n\n05. Superhuman Happiness – “Sentimental Pieces”\n\nOne of the most fun and creative songs I’ve heard in a long while. The way they combine dance grooves, hand claps, piano work, and some serious vocal harmonizing is quite impressive.\n\n06. Holy Ghost! – “Dumb Disco Ideas”\n\n07. Earl Sweatshirt – “Chum”\n\n08. White Denim – “Pretty Green”\n\n09. Sigur Rós – “Isjaki”\n\n10. Phosphorescent – “Song for Zula”\n\n11. Youth Lagoon – “Mute”\n\n12. Savages – “She Will”\n\n13. Anders Osborne – “Peace”\n\n14. Ty Segall – “Sleeper”\n\n15. Atoms for Peace – “Judge, Jury, and Executioner”\n\n16. Jim James – “Know Til Now”\n\n17. Deerhunter – “Back to the Middle”\n\n18. Johnathon Wilson – “Moses Pain”\n\n19. Bonobo – “Cirrus”\n\n20. Darkside – “Paper Trails”\n\nKevin Raos // Columnist // @Semirec\n\n01. Vampire Weekend – “Hannah Hunt”\n\nThe best song, on perhaps the best album of the year, “Hannah Hunt” is an instant classic. Modern Vampires of the City is littered with tracks that will be considered amongst Vampire Weekend’s best, and “Hannah Hunt” leads the pack. Despite the lack of “quirkiness” that Vampire Weekend is sometimes known for, the track gently builds the listener up to one of the most jubilant climaxes found on any record this year.\n\n02. Youth Lagoon – “Raspberry Cane”\n\nAnother song that builds you up and sweeps you off your feet, “Raspberry Cane” is a bright spot on Wondrous Bughouse, a sophomore effort that fell slightly short of expectations. Hauntingly fascinating and beautifully psychedelic, this song takes the listener on a musical journey.\n\n03. Arcade Fire – “Afterlife”\n\n“Afterlife” is a song that took a few years to see the light of day. When it was released, Win Butler commented on the history of this song, saying it began “with a Haitian percussion loop we recorded way back at the end of the The Suburbs tour and “took a while to get the chorus right.” Enter producer James Murphy and the result is an extremely danceable synth-pop tune that is up there with the year’s pedigree.\n\n04. Rhye – “Open”\n\nPassion oozes from this song. Simple and pure love in it’s most basic form. Lyrics, musicianship and delivery make this track one of the most soothing songs of the year. Turn this on, embrace those you love, and all will be right in the world if only for a couple minutes.\n\n05. Washed Out – “It All Feels Right”\n\nThe title of this song says it best. Washed Out’s sunbathed reverb vibes can instantly transport you to a beach and put a beverage in your hand. Fact. Move aside “Get Lucky”, this was the summer anthem of 2013 on my stereo.\n\n06. Major Lazer – “Get Free”\n\n07. Wild Belle – “Keep You”\n\n08. Holy Ghost! – “Dumb Disco Ideas”\n\n09. Yeah Yeah Yeahs – “Sacrilege”\n\n10. James Blake – “Retrograde”\n\n11. Phosphorescent – “The Quotidian Beasts”\n\n12. Daft Punk – “Instant Crush”\n\n13. Boards of Canada – “Nothing is Real”\n\n14. Mikal Cronin – “Weight”\n\n15. Sigur Rós – “Brennisteinn”\n\n16. Kurt Vile – “Wakin on a Pretty Day”\n\n17. Phoenix – “Trying to Be Cool”\n\n18. Foxygen – “San Francisco”\n\n19. Junip – “Line of Fire”\n\n20. Disclosure – “White Noise (feat. AlunaGeorge)”\n\nBrooks Rocco // Columnist // @brooksrocco\n\n01. Jagwar Ma – “Uncertainty”\n\nIn the wholly subjective exercise of selecting a favorite song of a year, one must consider one’s most notable experiences, focusing upon those driven by the most notable soundtracks. 2013’s best dance party, in my little sphere of dominion, was Jagwar Ma’s headlining set at Rickshaw Stop, and it was the song ‘Uncertainty’ that made me most notably lose control of my senses. Even upon sober reflection, the song (defining the tone of the album it appears on) is a sledgehammer of a good time, a song that revels in the Clichés that in an earlier year would have manifested in sardonic irony. It’s finally time to embrace what works, and in doing so, create the future that pushes towards the goal: a musical tribute to our ecstatic humanity, as we remain fueled by uncertainties.\n\n02. Deafheaven – “Dream House”\n\nIn some ways, “Dream House” is the end of black metal. It’s been a long time coming though, with American kids raised on the stuff tilting their combo amps backward, screaming their fresh-faced idolatry for the legends that dared to not give a fuck. With the pink Pitchfork kiss of approval, black metal has become another texture in the tech-savvy hipster’s chest, to be yanked out when the time is appropriate (then and only then!). ‘Dream House’ is the black metal song that everyone can agree on. Euronymous is Dead. Long live Black Metal.\n\n03. Cave – “Arrow’s Myth”\n\nShifting space, coagulating color, sound, motion; breaking barriers, and driving the motorized swirl ever farther, Cave returned in 2013 with some of their most funky and delicately harmonious hues yet. Once again they delivered just the right the stuff we all need—imbalance your chemicals (whatever that means to you), throw on “Arrow’s Myth”, and wrap your head around whatever comes natural. If it feels good, right?\n\n04. Carcass – “A Congealed Clot of Blood”\n\nI got a little worried when I found out Andy Sneap was producing the followup to Carcass’ swan song, Surgical Steel, as said producer is the type of surgeon to sterilize all his instruments thoroughly before performing his delicate incisions. Fortunately, this sublime return to force by the UK legends is necrotising death metal masterpiece; ‘A Congealed Clot of Blood’ worthy amongst their greatest.\n\n05. my bloody valentine – “in another way”\n\nI wasn’t listening to Loveless in the 90’s like it was my religion. In my erumpent musical debut, I was blasting stuff like Emperor, Dissection, Meshuggah; bands louder, noisier, and far, far more unsettling than My Bloody Valentine. But for a lot of people, MBV were the anti-music of their spheres. That said, the night m b v dropped, I got sucked into the tornado along with everyone else. A cursory pirated listen and I was in. ‘in another way’ was the tune that made me whip out the plastic capital and order the wax. Full disclosure for Mr. Shields: it was that guitar. How did you…\n\n06. RP Boo – “Invisibu Boogie!”\n\n07. Dispirit – “All Paths End The Same”\n\n08. David Bowie – “Where Are We Now?”\n\n09. Föllakzoid – “9”\n\n10. FOALS – “Late Night”\n\n11. Thee Oh Sees – “No Spell”\n\n12. Mikal Cronin – “Shout It Out”\n\n13. The Five Eyes – “HEY HEY NSA (Tinfoil in Every Hat)”\n\n14. The Knife – “Old Dreams Waiting to be Realized”\n\n15. Kanye West – “On Sight”\n\n16. Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats – “Desert Ceremony”\n\n17. Parquet Courts – “Master of My Craft”\n\n18. Cut Copy – “Free Your Mind”\n\n19. Anthroprophh – “Hermit”\n\n20. Telekinesis – “Power Lines”\n\nNikki De Martini // Columnist & Photographer // @SweetSoundBites\n\n01. M.I.A. – “Y.A.L.A.”\n\nSeducingly rhythmic percussion loops, heavy dropping bass lines and a shining bratty-tude mock US society fads on this effortless dance track from my favorite Sri Lankan West-Londoner. M.I.A.’s signature ballsy Bollywood flavor minus the familiarity of foghorns will make you want to get up and dance before realizing what she’s singing about sets in and when it does, this track gets even better. “Y.A.L.A.” makes me wonder why Interscope Records repeatedly shelved her 4th album for not being “dark” or “controversial” enough.\n\n02. RAC Featuring Kelle Okereke and MNDR – “Let Go”\n\nAs a fan of MNDR for years and a Bloc Party fan for even longer, this collaborative RAC track won me over since the very first time hearing it — the emotionally charged lyrics paired with it’s uplifting melody just melt into one so well.\n\n03. MS MR – “Hurricane”\n\nEasily one of my favorite tracks off of their breakthrough debut album, the first single “Hurricane” showcases the multitude of MS MR’s talents to a tee with rich, relatable lyrics and an underlying electro-pop essence wrapped up and delivered in a neat indie rock fashion.\n\n04. Arctic Monkeys – “Do I Wanna Know?”\n\nIt’s heavy drums, low bass chords and dirty guitar licks reminiscent of The Black Keys are that draw me to this song. Then the lyrics hit and that was it. Every time I hear this song I turn it up and sing along.\n\n05. Schoolboy Q Featuring Kendrick Lamar – “Collard Greens”\n\nThe catchy hooks and layered verses are a throw back to old school “dirty” rap yet remain fresh, leaving me hungry for more Kendrick Lamar!\n\n06. Lana Del Rey – “Summertime Sadness” (Cedric Gervais remix)\n\n07. LORDE – “Team”\n\n08. Cage the Elephant – “It’s Just Forever (featuring Alison Mosshart)”\n\n09. Yeah Yeah Yeahs – “Wedding Song”\n\n10. Queens of the Stone Age – “Sat by the Ocean”\n\n11. Jay Z – “Tom Ford”\n\n12. Little Boots – “Strangers”\n\n13. Portugal the Man – “Purple Yellow Red and Blue”\n\n14. VV Brown – “Apple”\n\n15. Sleigh Bells – “Bitter Rivals”\n\n16. Broken Bells – “Holding on for Life”\n\n17. NONONO – “Pumping Blood”\n\n18. CSS – “Hangover”\n\n19. Atlas Genius – “Electric”\n\n20. Smallpools – “Dreaming”\n\nPedro Paredes // Photographer // @pedropar\n\n01. Atoms for Peace – “Before Your Very Eyes”\n\nEvery great album needs an opening song worthy of it, and “Before Your Very Eyes” gives just that to the supergroup formed by members of Radiohead (Thom Yorke, Nigel Godrich), Red Hot Chili Peppers (Flea), Beck (Joey Waronker) and Forro in The Dark (Mauro Refosco). With dense, steady percussions, electronic arrangements, a simple guitar section, and the soft sound of Thom Yorke’s voice, this song walks to the beat of life and death, joy and sorrow, and begins the path for one of the best albums of 2013.\n\n02. Vampire Weekend – “Obvious Bicycle”\n\nVampire Weekend’s first song of their amazing Modern Vampires of the City sets the mood for an album that takes a different route from their previous work, with a warmer, more mature sound. A beautiful song for a beautiful album.\n\n03. James Blake – “Retrograde”\n\nMelodic Bass Music are the words James Blake chose to describe his work, and “Retrograde” seems to fit that description quite well. It’s a love song for the future, coming from the darkness of the dawn.\n\n03. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – “Jubilee Street”\n\nNick Cave is a natural storyteller that makes use of his musical talent to make any story come alive (his music scores for films like ‘The Assassination of Jesse James’ or ‘The Proposition’ are enough to prove my point) Jubilee Street starts simple, growing in complexity in the subtlest of ways, beautifully contained under the spell of Nick Cave’s voice.\n\n05. Blood Orange – “It is What it Is”\n\n“It is What it Is” is exactly what it should be — Deliciously elegant, precise, presenting a new version of 80’s pop-reset. This song is the cherry on top of one of the best albums of 2013.\n\n06. Mutual Benefit – “Golden Wake”\n\n07. Arcade Fire – “Here Comes the Night Time”\n\n08. Daft Punk – “Instant Crush”\n\n09. Lorde – “Royals”\n\n10. William Tyler – “Cadillac Dessert”\n\n11. Kurt Vile – “Wakin on a Pretty Day”\n\n12. Phosphorescent – “Ride On/Right On”\n\n13. Deerhunter – “Back to the Middle”\n\n14. Darkside – “Paper Trails”\n\n15. Nine Inch Nails – “Copy of A”\n\n16. Parquet Courts – “Stoned and Starving”\n\n17. Low – “Plastic Cup”\n\n18. Blue Hawaii – “Try To Be”\n\n19. Yeah Yeah Yeahs – “Despair”\n\n20. Foxygen – “No Destruction”\n\n“Best of” lists are always subjective, and this one is no anomaly. When it comes to the best albums of any given year, we can most likely agree that the best records are excellent from beginning to end — no “skip ahead” songs — and that groundbreaking new music can emerge from any genre.\n\nAt the same time, we imprint music on moments in our lives, and this will always influence personal taste. Combine these past influences with modern streaming capabilities in 2013, where new records are now accessible before an album release date, and our collective creation and criticism of music begins to transform, adapt and influence more rapidly.\n\nHere are our most addictive albums of 2013, the records we couldn’t stop spinning.\n\n01.

Phosphorescent – Muchacho\n\nMike Frash // Founder, Editor, Columnist // @MikeFrash\n\nVampire Weekend – Modern Vampires of the City\n\nThe focus on larger themes of mortality and spirituality in Modern Vampires of the City have catapulted this indie group from angst-ridden collegians to mainstream players — and in the process Ezra Koenig and company crafted an American classic. Compulsively listenable, this record matured with age in 2013, just like the artistic path Vampire Weekend seem to be on. The album continuously waxes poetically about death and higher powers, and “Unbelievers” sums it up best: “Girl you and I will die unbelievers, bound to the tracks of the train.” The ambiguousness is biting, as it is tough to tell if the statement is earnest atheism or harsh criticism of Godless existence. In “Step”, we’re told, “Wisdom’s a gift but you’ll trade it for youth, age is an honor it’s still not the truth…we know the true death, the true way of all flesh. Everyone’s dying, but girl – you’re not old yet.” Even “Dianne Young” is a double entendre for ‘dying young’. Every track is filled with high-level substance lyrically, but sonically it’s multi-faceted as well, melding baroque sensibilities and African grooves at a wonderfully variant pace throughout. Ultimately, it’s a supremely empowering coming of age album from Vampire Weekend, one that stares mortality in the face while celebrating time’s finite quality.\n\nRun the Jewels (El-P & Killer Mike) – Run the Jewels\n\nEarly in Run The Jewels, Killer Mike announces, “Producer gave me a beat, said it’s the ‘beat of the year’, I said ‘El-P didn’t do it, so get the fuck outa here.’ El-P, the sole producer of rap music’s most dynamic duo, bases his production in captivating weirdness, micro-sampling everything from classic organ to nintendo glitch sounds to electric guitar, building epic beats for Killer Mike & El-P to deliver clever rhymes, based both in reality and playful hyperbole. One of Run The Jewels’ greatest successes is that it can be both funny and deadly serious within the same song, and often within in the same flow or line at times. So motherfuckin’ grimy, “Job Well Done” highlights how successfully dolphin sounds can contrast with aggressive lyricism, for example. Killer Mike broaches serious topics, bringing up the “elephant in the room” whenever possible, and EL-P is hyperactive and light-hearted as he spits his ‘future shit’. Put these two together and you have the best hip hop album in years.\n\nFOALS – Holy Fire\n\nThe beauty is in the build with FOALS, and that is the case with Holy Fire more than prior album as the UK-based festival-headliners-in-the-making have largely abandoned their post-dance punk sound aesthetic for a more ballad-based approach. Sure, “My Number” and “Providence” continue the upbeat, math rock-dance-freak-outs, but overall FOALS have centered their 2013 record around patient song development in order to establish more memorable, ecstatic moments. “Milk & Black Spiders” does just that, taking a full three minutes and forty five seconds to reach it’s blissful summit. “Late Night” is a harrowing slow burner, repeating the line, “Calling out your name,” asking for the subject of the song to “Stay with me.” Lead singer Yannis Philippakis’ impassioned vocals, paired with the band’s guitar interplay and non-standard rhythms make FOALS a unique force in the world of modern rock.\n\nThe National – Trouble Will Find Me\n\nMatt Berninger has a way with words — who else could make the phrase “full of punks and cannonballers” sound eloquent and measured in the track “I Need My Girl”? The National thrives on non-literal lyricism, but the instrumental elements from The National in Trouble Will Find Me prop the singing up on a pedestal better than prior records. Void of any filler, this contemplative record easily allows the listener to take their own meaning from any given track, applying it internally. The first half impresses quickly with “I Should Live In Salt” through “Sea Of Love”, but it is the second half that solidifies the effort as The National’s best work to date. An album that also gets more addictive with subsequent listens, Trouble Will Find Me works well as both a “pick me up” record and one to embrace life’s "
