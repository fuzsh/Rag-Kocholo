        "text": "Every now and again in this space, I will be answering questions from those who reach out to me on LinkedIn, Twitter or via email wondering what we do at Scorers 1st, the international business of basketball, scouting, recruiting, player branding and the increasing role social plays in connecting us within the game.\n\nThis week, the question comes via Twitter from @blazers6thman: \"Do you encourage your guys (at Scorers 1st) to go for NBA contracts even if they won't get much playing time or stay overseas?\"\n\nIt's a question Gerrit Kersten-Thiele and I discuss and debate in length at Scorers 1st on a regular basis, as we take both a lengthy and realistic approach to career planning for each respective player on our roster (client list). And that's really what we are talking about here when we delve into the question of \"NBA or overseas\" -- career planning. The topic, however, extends beyond a one word answer and really can be broken down into three areas -- at least in regards to our overarching approach at Scorers 1st: players you are trying to recruit to your agency, current players on your roster and thirdly, your emerging European talent.\n\nRecruiting\n\nIn this year-round cycle of recruiting, you can imagine the obstacles we tend to face with being an international agency. While we have offices here in Germany and a US office outside of Indiana, there is a major misconception surrounding our ability to make strides into the NBA, particularly with a graduating college Senior. Having Patrick Ewing Jr. and Tim Ohlbrecht -- two players with NBA experience -- as part of our extended Scorers 1st family truly is beneficial and provides a certain cache in recruiting circles, but our focus remains centered on progressing into the NBA with a college Senior who grasps and appreciates the pride and dedicated approach we take in forming relationships with our clients, fully marketing and promoting them, educating them on the business side of the game and utilizing the extensive relationships we have around the NBA. The \"extensive relationships\" honestly is the major piece of the puzzle when it comes to fulfilling that NBA dream, along with the players' concrete skill set. Some are realistic about their skill set. Others, hopefully will learn this over time.\n\nI say this time and again, but no kid in the States is growing up dreaming of playing basketball in Europe. And while playing in Europe obviously becomes a reality for the majority of players, reaching the NBA and securing either a summer league, training camp or full contract is something we work diligently toward when it comes to scouting and recruiting players and as we begin to map out a career plan for them.\n\nCurrent Roster\n\nWhen watching the Cleveland Cavaliers' press conference in announcing David Blatt as head coach -- after winning at the highest levels around Europe and spending 30 years trying to reach the NBA -- I couldn't help but connect with one of his encouraging quotes: \"There are so many good coaches and great players playing overseas and around Europe. All they need is the chance.\"\n\nNot a week goes by that we don't remind our guys that someone is always watching. Regardless if that is a Senior coming out of college who basically has to create a name for himself in Europe, a player with a couple of years under his belt overseas who has worked his way up, or a veteran who was achieved success at high-levels around the game abroad -- the message is same: there are always eyes on you, gauging your talent level and development, both as a player and a person.\n\nTake Larry Gordon for example. A 6-foot-5, 215 pound swingman, Gordon came out of Division 2 Cal Poly Pomona and quickly made a name for himself by working hard, taking a realistic approach to his career path, and went from a minimal contract in Holland in 2009 before moving on to play in Austria and now has spent the last two seasons playing in Germany's BEKO BBL. Today, Gordon is one of the premiere players at his position in the league, led the league in rebounding this past season and was an All-Star Game selection with Phoenix Hagen. We could not be more proud of Larry and his accomplishments -- a high character guy, hard worker, understands the business side of the game and has become the cornerstone of how we view relationships, player development and ensuring we place players in situations where they can excel.\n\nYou have to remember: it's not like playing professionally in Europe is one giant league like the NBA or even the D-League. Each country has a number of divisions, competition varies from country to country and division to division, how clubs conduct business also differs, etc...So you can imagine the rigors that come with the overseas business and navigating the waters. It can be both an exciting and delicate process when sitting down with a player and discussing where they are at in their career and where they want to go.\n\nEmerging European Talent\n\nWe consider ourselves very fortunate to work with a number of talented European players, both from Germany and around Holland. As the NBA game has become more global, the influx of NBA scouts and hiring of scouts around Europe by NBA teams -- some area/regionally based -- are constantly communicating to front offices the rise of youth players around Europe and those already mainstays in leagues overseas. For our sake, we want to make sure those parties have the necessary information available to them that may extend beyond what they see at a live game or on second hand game film. We also take a \"big picture\" view of growing a European players' game so they can be seen (and more seen) competing at a high-level (see Euroleague, EuroChallenge, EuroCup, in addition to their respective country league). Similar to the rest of our roster, the development is key to making that NBA jump like a Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol or most recently Dante' Exum.\n\nIt has been amazing to watch Danilo Barthel (6-foot-10, 220 pound power forward) compete this summer both in Orlando and Las Vegas at Summer League with the Miami Heat. While Barthel is under contract with the Fraport Skyliners in Germany's BEKO BBL, this has been a tremendous opportunity to showcase his vast ability in front of NBA executives and fans after going from Germany's ProB, to the BBL, named to the All-Star team, and earning Most Improved Player honors in 2013-14.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Danilo Barthel while playing consistently at summer league and growing his game?\n\nNBA or Overseas\n\nThe one facet these three areas -- recruiting a young talent with NBA dreams, working with your current roster and being aware of the European players maturation -- have in common is, regardless if a player is mapped for the NBA or a career playing professionally abroad, timing and opportunity are an integral part of the process. This is less about securing a big contract or playing time. The timing and opportunity have to be just right and that also depends on the person/player.\n\nIt's also important for a player to have a realistic view about themselves, their talent level and skill set, and understand the importance of an agency developing a three to five year career plan (and/or for life after basketball). The common belief from some players in the States is, \"I'm going to go overseas and kill it and make a lot of money\". You set yourself up for failure in the game and life with that approach. Instead, focus on partnering with the right people (agency, regardless of location) to ensure you are placed in a \"win-win\" situation where you can grow your game and financially within the business through hard work, dedication and taking care of your body, while adapting to new surroundings, cultures and styles of play/basketball systems.\n\nAnd lastly, educate yourself on the business and trust your decisions. Regardless if you are fast tracked for competing in the NBA or playing overseas, don't fall into the habit of making decisions based on what \"my boy who plays overseas\". Or clinging on to the faulty advice of people who don't understand how the business works in overseas basketball or the NBA in general.\n\nThose two roads only lead to dead ends and will only have you looking back wondering where you took a wrong turn."
