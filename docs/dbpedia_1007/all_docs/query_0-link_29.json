        "text": "Different values of urinary fractionated metanephrines after unilateral adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma according to time intervals after surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nCho, Yoon Y; Kim, Young N; Kim, Jung-Han; Jeong, Byong C; Lee, Soo-Youn; Kim, Jae H\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground After adrenalectomy, urinary fractionated metanephrine concentrations are expected to be reduced. However, there are few studies suggesting cut-offs for adrenalectomy patients. Methods Urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine concentrations in adrenalectomy patients and two controls were compared and hormonal concentrations were evaluated via time intervals after surgery. Results The median urinary metanephrine level after unilateral adrenalectomy was lower than that of the non-pheochromocytoma controls but comparable to healthy controls. Urinary normetanephrine concentrations did not differ between adrenalectomy patients and non-pheochromocytoma controls, although both group had levels higher than those of healthy controls. The median urinary normetanephrine level in the immediate postoperative period was higher than in the later period. Conclusions Urinary metanephrine concentrations were lower after adrenalectomy, but urinary normetanephrine concentrations were not changed compared with the non-pheochromocytoma controls. However, urinary normetanephrine concentrations in the patient group were higher than levels in the heathy controls.\n\nUnilateral adrenalectomy improves urinary protein excretion but does not abolish its relationship to sodium excretion in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nPimenta, E; Gordon, R D; Ahmed, A H; Cowley, D; Robson, D; Kogovsek, C; Stowasser, M\n\n2011-10-01\n\nExperimental and human data suggest that adverse cardiovascular (CV) and renal effects of aldosterone excess are dependent on concomitant dietary salt intake. Increased urinary protein (Uprot) is an early sign of nephropathy independently associated with CV risk. We have previously reported a positive association between Uprot and urinary sodium (UNa) in patients with hyperaldosteronism, but not in patients with normal aldosterone levels. We aimed to determine whether Uprot is related to UNa in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and whether the degree of Uprot and strength of this relationship is reduced following correction of hyperaldosteronism. Subjects with APA (n=24) underwent measurement of 24âh Uprot and UNa before and after unilateral adrenalectomy (follow-up 15.0Â±11.9 months). Following surgery, mean clinic systolic blood pressure fell (150.4Â±18.2 vs 134.5Â±14.5âmmâHg, P=0.0008), despite a reduction in number of antihypertensive medications, and Uprot (211.2Â±101.6 vs 106.0Â±41.8âmg per day, P<0.0001) decreased. There was a positive correlation between Uprot and UNa both before (r=0.5477, P=0.0056) and after (r=0.5097, P=0.0109) adrenalectomy. Changes in UNa independently predicted Uprot reduction (P=0.0189). These findings suggest that both aldosterone levels and dietary salt contribute to renal damage, and that once glomerular damage occurs it is not completely resolved following correction of hyperaldosteronism. Our study suggests that treatment strategies based on reduction of aldosterone effects, by adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, in conjunction with low-salt diet would provide additional target-organ protection in patients with primary aldosteronism.\n\nPrimary aldosteronism: results of adrenalectomy for nonsingle adenoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuillo, Amy R; Grant, Clive S; Thompson, Geoffrey B; Farley, David R; Richards, Melanie L; Young, William F\n\n2011-07-01\n\nHistorically, treatment of confirmed primary aldosteronism has been adrenalectomy for unilateral adenoma; bilateral hypersecretion is treated medically. Increasingly, we use adrenal venous sampling (AVS) to define unilateral hypersecretion. Histology of glands resected based on AVS often reveals multiple nodules or hyperplasia. The aim of this study was to compare patients with multiple nodules or hyperplasia with those with single adenoma with regard to cure, preoperative imaging, AVS ratio, and biochemical evaluation to determine if a nonsingle adenoma (NSA) process could be predicted to impact extent of adrenalectomy. This was a retrospective study reviewing a single-institutional surgical experience at a tertiary academic center from 1993 to 2008, during which 215 patients with primary aldosteronism underwent unilateral adrenalectomy based on imaging of a single adenoma (normal contralateral gland) or AVS ratios. Histology included single adenoma versus NSA; cure was defined as normal immediate postoperative plasma or urine aldosterone level, normal aldosterone:renin ratio, or normotension without antihypertensive medications. Follow-up (mean 13 months, range 0 to 185 months) was available for 167 patients: 132 (79%) single adenoma and 35 (21%) NSA. All 35 patients with NSA and 128 patients (97%) with single adenoma were cured. Imaging studies correctly predicted NSA in 29% and 57% when combined with AVS. Identifying patients with NSA preoperatively was impossible biochemically: mean serum and urinary aldosterone levels and AVS ratios were not different than those of the single adenoma group. Twenty-one percent of patients had NSA, all cured by unilateral adrenalectomy. No preoperative evaluation reliably predicted NSA. Therefore, total unilateral adrenalectomy was safest given the potential for incomplete resection with partial adrenalectomy. Accurate AVS is highly predictive of cure irrespective of the unilateral adrenal histology.

We retrospectively investigated intraoperative and postoperative outcomes after laparoscopic adrenalectomy through mono port (LAMP) and conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy to assess the feasibility of LAMP. Between March 2008 and December 2009, 22 patients underwent adrenalectomy at the Department of Surgery, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital. Twelve patients underwent conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy and 10 patients underwent LAMP. The same surgeon performed all the surgeries. The 2 procedures were compared in terms of tumor size, operating time, time to resumption of a soft diet, length of hospital day, and postoperative complications. The 2 groups were similar in terms of tumor size (30.08 vs. 32.50 mm, P=0.796), mean operating time (112.9 vs. 127 min, P=0.316), time to resumption of a soft diet (1.25 vs. 1.30 d, P=0.805), and length of hospital day (4.08 vs. 4.50 d, P=0.447). Despite 1 patient in the LAMP group experiencing ipsilateral pleural effusion as a postoperative complication, this parameter was similar for the 2 groups (P=0.195). Perioperative mortality, blood transfusion, and conversion to open surgery did not occur. Perioperative outcomes for LAMP were similar to those for conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. LAMP appears to be a feasible option for adrenalectomy.\n\nTransperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Our experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nAntonino, Antonio; Rosato, Andrea; Zenone, Pasquale; Ranieri, Raffaele; Maglio, Mauro; Lupone, Gennaro; Gragnano, Eugenio; Sangiuliano, Nicola; Docimo, Giovanni; De Palma, Maurizio\n\n2013-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic adrenalectomy is considered the standard technique for the surgical removal of the adrenal gland. This report is about a 4-year single experience in our Endocrine and General Surgery Unit with laparoscopic adrenalectomy. A total of 24 lateral transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed. The indications for laparoscopic surgery were: aldosteronoma in 3 patients, pheochromocytoma in 6 patients, nonfunctioning adenoma in 6 patients, adenoma causing Cushing's syndrome in 3 patients, 1 lymphangioma-like adenomatoid tumor, 1 myelolipoma, 1 complicated adrenal cyst, 2 adrenocortical carcinomas, 1 lung metastasis. All except two had successful laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Complication occurred in one patient. 3 patients underwent other associated laparoscopic procedures. Operative time ranged from 100 to 240 minutes for laparoscopic adrenalectomy, from 180 to 210 minutes in the cases with two associated laparoscopic procedures, 5 hours for bilateral adrenalectomy; the postoperative hospital stay for laparoscopic adrenalectomy ranged from 4 to 8 days (6,79 days) and from 7 to 13 days (9,12 days) for patients undergoing the open or converted procedure. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is technically feasible and reproducible. We evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for a variety of endocrine disorders except in the case of invasive carcinoma or large masses. Antonio Cardarelli Endocrine and General Surgery Unit in Naples is known as a specialized center for thyroid and parathyroid surgery; in future, we could also become a high-volume laparoscopic referral center for adrenal gland pathologies.\n\nChanges in Body Mass Index in Pheochromocytoma Patients Following Adrenalectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpyroglou, Ariadni; Adolf, Christian; Hahner, Stefanie; Quinkler, Marcus; Ladurner, Roland; Reincke, Martin; Beuschlein, Felix\n\n2017-03-01\n\nCatecholamine excess from pheochromocytoma results in cardiovascular symptoms such as arterial hypertension and tachycardia and induces metabolic alterations including glucose intolerance and increase in resting metabolic rate. The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of surgical cure of pheochromocytoma on body-mass-index and the correlation of body-mass-index changes to preoperative endocrine parameters. Pheochromocytoma patients from the Munich ENSAT Registry were matched (1:2) for age and gender to patients from the German Conn's Registry, who had undergone surgery for aldosterone-producing-adenomas. Thereby, 43 pheochromocytoma patients (17 males/26 females) and 86 aldosterone-producing-adenoma patients were analyzed for body-mass-index, blood pressure, and catecholamine levels before and one year after adrenalectomy. Seventy-four percent of pheochromocytoma patients were hypertensive preoperatively and 48% one year postoperatively. Systolic blood pressure did not differ significantly in pre- and postoperative measurements whereas diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced over time. Moreover, pheochromocytoma patients gained body weight (p<0.001) one year following adrenalectomy accompanied by significant increases in body-mass-index, whereas aldosterone-producing adenoma patients displayed a slight weight loss. Despite weight gain, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus dropped from 9 of 43 investigated pheochromocytoma patients at baseline to 4 at follow-up. A significant correlation between body-mass-index changes to the preoperative catecholamine levels was found only for urinary normetanephrines. These data suggest that normalization of chronic catecholamine excess by adrenalectomy is associated with an increase in body-mass-index, which is more pronounced in patients with high preoperative levels of urinary normetanephrines.

To present specific aspects of adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome (CS) by introducing well established aspects (\"do's\") and less known aspects (\"don'ts\"). Material and Method. This is a narrative review. Results. The \"do's\" for laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) are the following: it represents the \"gold standard\" for secretor and non-secretor adrenal tumors and the first line therapy for CS with an improvement of cardio-metabolic co-morbidities; the success rate depending on the adequate patients' selection and the surgeon's skills. The \"don'ts\" are large (>6-8 centimeters), locally invasive, malignant tumors requiring open adrenalectomy (OA). Robotic adrenalectomy is a new alternative for LA, with similar safety and conversion rate and lower pain drugs use. The \"don'ts\" are the following: lack of randomized controlled studies including oncologic outcome, different availability at surgical centers. Related to the sub-types of CS, the \"do's\" are the following: adrenal adenomas which are cured by LA, while adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) requires adrenalectomy as first line therapy and adjuvant mitotane therapy; synchronous bilateral adrenalectomy (SBA) is useful for Cushing's disease (only cases refractory to pituitary targeted therapy), for ectopic Cushing's syndrome (cases with unknown or inoperable primary site), and for bilateral cortisol producing adenomas. The less established aspects are the following: criteria of skilled surgeon to approach ACC; the timing of surgery in subclinical CS; the need for adrenal vein catheterization (which is not available in many centers) to avoid unnecessary SBA. Conclusion. Adrenalectomy for CS is a dynamic domain; LA overstepped the former OA area. The future will improve the knowledge related to RA while the cutting edge is represented by a specific frame of intervention in SCS, children and pregnant women.

To evaluate the indication and the clinical value of laparoscopic adrenalectomy of different types of adrenal tumor. Methods. From 2009 to 2014, a total of 110 patients were diagnosed with adrenal benign tumor by CT scan and we performed laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The laparoscopic approach has been the procedure of choice for surgery of benign adrenal tumors, and the upper limit of tumor size was thought to be 6âcm. Results. 109 of 110 cases were successful; only one was converted to open surgery due to bleeding. The average operating time and intraoperative blood loss of pheochromocytoma were significantly more than the benign tumors (P < 0.05). After 3 months of follow-up, the preoperative symptoms were relieved and there was no recurrence. Conclusions. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has the advantages of minimal invasion, less blood loss, fewer complications, quicker recovery, and shorter hospital stay. The full preparation before operation can decrease the average operating time and intraoperative blood loss of pheochromocytomas. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy should be considered as the first choice treatment for the resection of adrenal benign tumor.

Robotic adrenal surgery has been reported to improve surgeon ergonomics and facilitate dissection. In patients with bilateral adrenal masses, PR adrenalectomy may be the approach of choice. We herein describe the technique, discuss its limitations and present a critical review of the current literature.

However, the optimal surgical approach to laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy has not been clearly defined. The aim of this study is to analyze the patient and intraoperative factors affecting the feasibility and outcome of different surgical approaches to define an algorithm for bilateral adrenalectomy. Between 2000 and 2013, all patients who underwent bilateral adrenalectomy at a single institution were selected for retrospective analysis. Patient factors, surgical approach, operative outcomes, and complications were analyzed. From 2000 to 2013, 28 patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. Patient diagnoses included Cushing's disease (n = 19), pheochromocytoma (n = 7), and adrenal metastasis (n = 2). Of these 28 patients, successful laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in all but 2 patients. Twenty-three out of the 26 adrenalectomies were completed in a single stage, while three were performed as a staged approach due to deterioration in intraoperative respiratory status in two patients and patient body habitus in one. Of the adrenalectomies completed using the minimally invasive approach, a posterior retroperitoneal (PR) approach was performed in 17 patients and lateral transabdominal (LT) approach in 9 patients. Patients who underwent a LT approach had higher BMI, larger tumor size, and other concomitant intraabdominal pathology. Hospital stay for laparoscopic adrenalectomy was 3.5 days compared to 5 and 12 days for the two open cases. There were no 30-day hospital mortality and 5 patients had minor complications for the entire cohort. A minimally invasive operation is feasible in 93% of patients undergoing bilateral adrenalectomy with 65% of adrenalectomies performed using the PR approach. Indications for the LT approach include morbid obesity, tumor size >6 cm, and other concomitant intraabdominal pathology. Single-stage adrenalectomies are feasible in most patients, with prolonged operative\n\nRetroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in pheochromocytoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHisano, Marcelo; Vicentini, Fabio Carvalho; Srougi, Miguel\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSince the first laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the technique has evolved and it has become the standard of care for many adrenal diseases, including pheochromocytoma. Two laparoscopic accesses to the adrenal have been developed: transperitoneal and retroperitoneal. Retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy may be recommended for the treatment of pheochromocytoma with the same peri-operative outcomes of the transperitoneal approach because it allows direct access to the adrenal glands without increasing the operative risks. Although technically more demanding than the transperitoneal approach, retroperitoneoscopy can shorten the mean operative time, which is critical for cases with pheochromocytoma where minimizing the potential for intra-operative hemodynamic changes is essential. Blood loss and the convalescence time can be also shortened by this approach. There is no absolute indication for either the transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach; however, the latter procedure may be the best option for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgery and obese patients. Also, retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy is a good alternative for treating cases with inherited pheochromocytomas, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, in which the pheochromocytoma is highly prevalent and frequently occurs bilaterally.

We performed a retrospective analysis of case notes of 29 patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma between 2000 and 2013. Twenty-nine patients (16 female), aged 16 to 67 years, underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma. All patients were treated preoperatively with alpha-blocking agents. 80% were prescribed additional preoperative antihypertensive agents. 90% received antihypertensive agents intraoperatively. All patients received intraoperative magnesium sulphate for haemodynamic stabilisation. The mean operative time was 160 minutes. Nearly all of the patients experienced haemodynamic stability during surgery. Two patients required conversion to open adrenalectomy, due to severe intraoperative hypertension during tumour handling, and due to extensive intra-abdominal adhesions. Postoperative complications were minimal, and included blood loss, superior epigastric artery damage, and cellulitis at the laparoscopic port site. There was no perioperative mortality. The median length of stay postoperatively was 4 days. 24% were prescribed antihypertensive medication on discharge. In our experience, favourable perioperative outcomes were achieved, demonstrating that laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma is a safe and effective procedure in the setting of experienced and skilled surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams delivering the perioperative care.\n\nAdrenalectomy for Cushingâs syndrome: doâs and donâts\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPaduraru, DN; Nica, A; Carsote, M; Valea, A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim.

It is, however, responsible for definitive adrenal insufficiency. The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical interest of unilateral adrenalectomy (UA) of the larger gland for the treatment of CS related to PBMAH. This was a retrospective study in four tertiary French centers including all 15 patients with PBMAH and CS who underwent UA of the larger gland between 2001 and 2015. Urinary free cortisol, plasma cortisol, ACTH, body mass index, blood pressure, plasma glucose, and lipids were registered pre- and postoperatively and on follow-up. Median follow-up was 60 months (interquartile range 39-105), including 8 of 15 patients followed up for at least 5 years. A normal or low urinary free cortisol was obtained in 15 of 15 patients (100%) postoperatively. Six patients (40%) became adrenal insufficient, of whom three of six recovered a quantitatively normal cortisol secretion on follow-up. Decrease of both body mass index and blood pressure were observed at 1 year, and decrease of blood pressure was persistent 5 years postoperatively. Diabetes was cured in four of six patients. Two patients experienced a recurrence of hypercortisolism, and one was treated with mitotane, whereas the other underwent a second adrenal surgery 9 years after initial UA. UA induced remission of hypercortisolism in all patients, with sustained significant clinical improvement. The rates of both definitive adrenal insufficiency and 5-year recurrence were low. UA appears an interesting alternative to bilateral adrenalectomy as a first-line treatment in PBMAH responsible for overt CS.\n\nBilateral Testicular Tumors Resulting in Recurrent Cushing Disease After Bilateral Adrenalectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuar, Troy; Engels, Manon; van Herwaarden, Antonius E; Sweep, Fred C G J; Hulsbergen-van de Kaa, Christina; Kamphuis-van Ulzen, Karin; Chortis, Vasileios; Arlt, Wiebke; Stikkelbroeck, Nike; Claahsen-van der Grinten, Hedi L; Hermus, Ad R M M\n\n2017-02-01\n\nRecurrence of hypercortisolism in patients after bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing disease is extremely rare. We present a 27-year-old man who previously underwent bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing disease with complete clinical resolution. Cushingoid features recurred 12 years later, with bilateral testicular enlargement. Hormonal tests confirmed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing disease. Surgical resection of the testicular tumors led to clinical and biochemical remission. Gene expression analysis of the tumor tissue by quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed high expression of all key steroidogenic enzymes. Adrenocortical-specific genes were 5.1 Ã 105 (CYP11B1), 1.8 Ã 102 (CYP11B2), and 6.3 Ã 104 (MC2R) times higher than nonsteroidogenic fibroblast control. This correlated with urine steroid metabolome profiling showing 2 fivefold increases in the excretion of the metabolites of 11-deoxycortisol, 21-deoxycortisol, and total glucocorticoids. Leydig-specific genes were 4.3 Ã 101 (LHCGR) and 9.3 Ã 100 (HSD17B3) times higher than control, and urinary steroid profiling showed twofold increased excretion of the major androgen metabolites androsterone and etiocholanolone. These distinctly increased steroid metabolites were suppressed by dexamethasone but unresponsive to human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation, supporting the role of ACTH, but not luteinizing hormone, in regulating tumor-specific steroid excess. We report bilateral testicular tumors occurring in a patient with recurrent Cushing disease 12 years after bilateral adrenalectomy. Using mRNA expression analysis and steroid metabolome profiling, the tumors demonstrated both adrenocortical and gonadal steroidogenic properties, similar to testicular adrenal rest tumors found in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, suggesting the presence of pluripotent cells even in patients without congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Update this unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma. Between 1998 and 2009, 119 adrenalectomies were performed in our department, among which 19 cases for pheochromocytoma. We reported three cases with cardiogenic failure or cardiogenic shock associated with emergency adrenalectomy. Patients were 36, 41 and 67 years old. The elapsed time between cardiogenic failure and surgery was 0, 7 and 19 days. The first diagnosis was a viral myocarditis in those three cases. The diagnosis of adrenal pheochromocytoma was done in a second step by the association of adrenal tumour on abdominal CT scan and detection of significantly elevated plasma/urine catecholamine. Severe systolic dysfunction with low ejection fraction was associated in all cases. Cardiac function was quickly restored after adrenalectomy. Cardiac emergency associated with pheochromocytoma is an unusual clinical presentation. When diagnosis fails to be performed, patients have a very poor prognosis. According to a review of the sparse literature, only early recognition and emergency adrenalectomy can improve the outcome. Copyright 2010.

This was a retrospective study, including 11 patients with bilateral adrenal lesions, affected by Cushing's syndrome (n=2), Cushing's disease (n=6), pheochromocytoma (n=2), and 1 adrenocorticotrophin-hormone-dependent hypercortisolism of unknown origin. Elevan bilateral adrenalectomies were carried out by the laparoscopic approach with no conversions. The operations were performed in 7 cases by the lateral transperitoneal adrenalectomy (LTLA), in 3 by the posterior approach (PRA), and in 1 by the combined approach. The mean size of the masses was 5 cm. (range, 4-13). The average operating time was 245 minutes for LTLA and 218 minutes for PRA (P<0.05). The estimated mean blood loss was 87+/-36 mL (range, 20-150). No patients required transfusions. The mean hospital stay was 5+/-1.8 days (range, 4-7). The mean follow-up was 34 months (range, 2-96). Our study confirms that the bilateral adrenalectomy by the minimally invasive technique is safe and effective, affording acceptable blood loss and morbidity with a short hospital stay.\n\nLaparoscopic Single Site Adrenalectomy Using a Conventional Laparoscope and Instrumentation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nColon, Modesto J; LeMasters, Patrick; Newell, Phillipa; Divino, Celia; Weber, Kaare J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground and Objectives: We present a case of Laparoendoscopic Single Site Surgery (LESS) left adrenalectomy performed with a conventional laparoscope and instruments. Methods: A 45-year-old male was diagnosed with hyperaldosteronism. Computed tomography detected a left adrenal nodule. Bilateral adrenal vein sampling was consistent with a left-sided source for hyperaldosteronism. Results: Total operative time for LESS left adrenalectomy was 120 minutes. The surgery was performed with conventional instruments, a standard 5-mm laparoscope, and a SILS port, with no additional incisions or trocars needed. No complications occurred, and the patient reported an uneventful recovery. Conclusions: LESS adrenalectomy is a feasible procedure. Although articulating instruments and laparoscopes may offer advantages, LESS adrenalectomy can be done without these.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether objective outcomes are different for the right- versus left- sided operation. Methods: A retrospective review of 163 laparoscopic adrenalectomies was performed to compare outcomes. Variables extracted included age, demographics, body mass index (BMI), laterality, indication, operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), gland size, complications, open conversion rates, and length of stay. Results: Of the adrenalectomies performed, 109 were on the left and 54 on the right. Age, BMI, and indication were similar for each group. The mean EBL on the left side was 113mL (range, 2 to 3000) and 84mL (range, 10 to 700) for the right (P=0.85). The mean operative time on the left side was 187 minutes (range, 62 to 475) and on the right was 156 minutes (range, 50 to 365) (P=0.02). There was no difference in complication or conversion rate. Conclusions: There was no difference in complication or conversion rates between each side, and we observed a trend toward lower blood loss for the right side. Although we report generally similar outcomes, the mean operative time for a right-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomy was significantly less (31 minutes) than the left side.

However, bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing syndrome is a challenging and time-consuming operation. We report our experience of laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy for this disease in 19 patients. From September 2009 to August 2012, we have operated 19 patients with Cushing syndrome and performed bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy using the transperitoneal approach; synchronous in 15 patients and staged in 4 patients. In 15 patients, the surgery was carried out sequentially on both the sides in lateral position with intraoperative change in position. Complete adrenalectomy including periadrenal fat was carried out on both the sides. Nineteen patients were referred from Department of Endocrinology for bilateral adrenalectomy for adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-dependent and ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome. The indications for surgery were Cushing disease in 15 patients, occult/ectopic source of ACTH in 2 patients, and primary adrenal hyperplasia in 2 patients. Fifteen patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomy during the same operation. Four patients underwent staged procedures. All procedures were completed laparoscopically with no conversions. The mean operating time for simultaneous bilateral adrenalectomy was 210 minutes (range, 150 to 240 min). This included the repositioning and reprepping time. There were no major intraoperative complications. The average blood loss was 100 mL (range, 50 to 200 mL). None of the patients required blood transfusions in the postoperative period. The postoperative complications included minor port-site infection in 2 patients. One severely debilitated patient died on the 14th postoperative day because of hospital-acquired pneumonia. The remaining 18 patients have done well in terms of impact on the disease. Laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing syndrome is feasible and safe. It confers all the advantages of minimally invasive\n\nSingle-incision retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy: a North American experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nSho, Shonan; Yeh, Michael W; Li, Ning; Livhits, Masha J\n\n2017-07-01\n\nEndoscopic adrenalectomy is currently performed using multiple ports placed either transabdominally or retroperitoneally. We report our initial experience with single-incision retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (SIRA). A prospective database of patients undergoing adrenalectomy from December 2013 through March 2016 was analyzed. We adopted conventional retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (CORA) in December 2013 and transitioned to SIRA in March 2015. SIRA was performed using three trocars placed through a single 2-cm incision below the 12th rib. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients undergoing SIRA and CORA. One hundred and five adrenalectomies were performed in 102 patients: 34 laparoscopic transperitoneal, 24 CORA, 37 SIRA and 7 open. The SIRA and CORA groups were similar with respect to clinical characteristics (SIRA vs. CORA: mean BMI 27.0 vs. 28.8Â kg/m 2 , maximum BMI 38.9 vs. 44.3Â kg/m 2 ; mean nodule size 3.2 vs. 3.2Â cm, maximum nodule size 8.0 vs. 6.0Â cm). One patient undergoing SIRA required placement of an additional 5-mm port because of extensive adhesions. No patients who underwent SIRA or CORA required conversion to open adrenalectomy. There were no deaths, and blood loss remained <10Â mL for all cases. Operative length was similar between SIRA and CORA (105 vs. 92Â min, PÂ =Â 0.26). In multivariable linear regression analysis, nodule sizeÂ >Â 5Â cm (effectÂ =Â 1.75, PÂ <Â 0.001) and pheochromocytoma (effectÂ =Â 1.30, PÂ =Â 0.05) were significant predictors of increased operative length for SIRA. BMI and laterality (right vs. left) did not affect operative length. Rates of postoperative temporary abdominal wall relaxation, length of stay and postoperative pain medication use were similar between the two groups. SIRA is safe and feasible to implement as a refinement of CORA and may be applied to technically challenging cases involving obese patients or large nodules. The use of three ports allows for two\n\nVariant adrenal venous anatomy in 546 laparoscopic adrenalectomies.\n\nPubMed\n\nScholten, Anouk; Cisco, Robin M; Vriens, Menno R; Shen, Wen T; Duh, Quan-Yang\n\n2013-04-01\n\nKnowing the types and frequency of adrenal vein variants would help surgeons identify and control the adrenal vein during laparoscopic adrenalectomy. To establish the surgical anatomy of the main vein and its variants for laparoscopic adrenalectomy and to analyze the relationship between variant adrenal venous anatomy and tumor size, pathologic diagnosis, and operative outcomes. In a retrospective review of patients at a tertiary referral hospital, 506 patients underwent 546 consecutive laparoscopic adrenalectomies between April 22, 1993, and October 21, 2011. Patients with variant adrenal venous anatomy were compared with patients with normal adrenal venous anatomy regarding preoperative variables (patient and tumor characteristics [size and location] and clinical diagnosis), intraoperative variables (details on the main adrenal venous drainage, any variant venous anatomy, duration of operation, rate of conversion to hand-assisted or open procedure, and estimated blood loss), and postoperative variables (transfusion requirement, reoperation for bleeding, duration of hospital stay, and histologic diagnosis). Laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Prevalence of variant adrenal venous anatomy and its relationship to tumor characteristics, pathologic diagnosis, and operative outcomes. Variant venous anatomy was encountered in 70 of 546 adrenalectomies (13%). Variants included no main adrenal vein identifiable (n = 18), 1 main adrenal vein with additional small veins (n = 11), 2 adrenal veins (n = 20), more than 2 adrenal veins (n = 14), and variants of the adrenal vein drainage to the inferior vena cava and hepatic vein or of the inferior phrenic vein (n = 7). Variants occurred more often on the right side than on the left side (42 of 250 glands [17%] vs. 28 of 296 glands [9%], respectively; P = .02). Patients with variant anatomy compared with those with normal anatomy had larger tumors (mean, 5.1 vs 3.3 cm, respectively; P < .001), more pheochromocytomas (24 of 70 [35%] vs\n\nAdrenalectomy for metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma - a single center experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nPopescu, Irinel; Alexandrescu, Sorin; Ciurea, Silviu; Brasoveanu, Vlad; Hrehoret, Doina; Gangone, Eliza; Boros, Mirela; Herlea, Vlad; Croitoru, Adina\n\n2007-05-01\n\nAdrenal metastases (AM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rarely seen in clinical practice. The treatment is not standardized, the indications and efficacy of different therapeutic approaches being still controversial. Between January 1995 and December 2005, 174 patients underwent liver resection for HCC in our center. AM were detected in four patients (2.3%): three of them had HCC and synchronous AM, and the remaining one developed AM 10 months after liver resection. All the patients with AM were treated by adrenalectomy (simultaneously with liver resection in synchronous metastases), followed by systemic chemotherapy. Non-resectable multifocal liver recurrences occurred in two patients, one of them having also a contralateral adrenal metastasis; these two patients are presently alive 26 and 43 months after adrenalectomy, respectively. Another patient died by liver recurrence 27 months postoperatively. The fourth patient is disease-free at 17 months after the initial operation. Adrenalectomy for AM from HCC should be performed whenever the primary tumor is well therapeutically controlled and the patient has a good performance status. Adrenalectomy offers the chance of more than 2 years survival in many patients. However, once AM are detected, the prognosis remains poor.\n\nFrontal white matter hyperintensity predicts lower urinary tract dysfunction in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nOgama, Noriko; Yoshida, Masaki; Nakai, Toshiharu; Niida, Shumpei; Toba, Kenji; Sakurai, Takashi\n\n2016-02-01\n\nLower urinary tract symptoms often limit activities of daily life and impair quality of life in the elderly. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether regional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) can predict lower urinary tract symptoms in elderly with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. The participants were 461 patients aged 65-85 years diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. Patients and their caregivers were asked about symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms (urinary difficulty, frequency and incontinence). Cognition, behavior and psychological symptoms of dementia and medication were evaluated. WMH and brain atrophy were analyzed using an automatic segmentation program. Regional WMH was evaluated in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. Patients with urinary incontinence showed significantly greater volume of WMH. WMH increased with age, especially in the frontal lobe. WMH in the frontal lobe was closely associated with urinary incontinence after adjustment for brain atrophy and classical confounding factors. Frontal WMH was a predictive factor for urinary incontinence in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. Urinary incontinence in demented older adults is not an incidental event, and careful insight into regional WMH on brain magnetic resonance imaging might greatly help in diagnosing individuals with a higher risk of urinary incontinence.

Between 1994 and 2008, a total of 114 patients (29 males and 85 females, median age 54 years) with adrenal Cushing's/subclinical Cushing's syndrome were studied. We compared the outcome of patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy between intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches. Surgical complications were graded according to the Clavien grading system. We also examined the long-term results of subclinical Cushing's syndrome after laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Laparoscopic surgical outcome did not differ significantly between patients with Cushing's syndrome and those with subclinical Cushing's syndrome. Patients who underwent laparoscopic intraperitoneal adrenalectomy had longer operative time than those who received retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (188.2 min vs. 160.9 min). However, operative blood loss and surgical complications were similar between both approaches. There were no complications of Clavien grade III or higher in either intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. We confirmed the improvement of hypertension and glucose tolerance in patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome after laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal Cushing's/subclinical Cushing's syndrome is safe and feasible in either intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. The use of the Clavien grading system for reporting complications in the laparoscopic adrenalectomy is encouraged for a valuable quality assessment.\n\nOutcome of Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy in Obese Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaun, Diana; Petris, Rodica; Ganescu, Roxana; Paun, Sorin; Vartic, Mihaela; Beuran, Mircea\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo compare early morbidity of obese and nonobese patients with minimally invasive adrenalectomies. Retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database, between June 2003 - December 2012, in a universitary affiliated tertiary hospital. Selection criteria: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy. Obese patients were defined as BMI over 30 kg/m2. From 205 patient with laparoscopic adrenalectomies we counted 30 obese patients (OG), 25 of them female and only 5 men with a median age of 54,20 years versus 47,94 years for nonobese group (NOG) (p=0.008). In OG were 15 right sided tumor, 11 on the left side and 4 bilateral all treated with transperitoneal antero-lateral approach. Median operating time was 92.20 minutes for OG versus 91.13 minutes for NOG (p=0.924). In OG, 5 patients had previous abdominal surgeries and we counted 4 conversion to open surgery, 2 postoperative complications (6.6%) and no mortality. All OG patients have diverse comorbidities, 50% of them more then 3. Median specimen size was 5.92 cm for OG versus 4.85 cm for NOG (p=0.057). The histology of OG was: adenoma 11 cases, hiperplasia 13 cases and pheochromocytoma 6. In NOG we had: postoperative hospital stay was 6.57 days in OG versus 4.11 days in NOG (p=0.009). Although obese patients had a higher rate for early morbidities, the minimally invasive approach has particular benefits for them. Although postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer, we believe that advantages of minimal invasive surgery for obese patients remains valid even in a BMI over 30.\n\nLaparoscopic transperitoneal anterior adrenalectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nScoglio, Daniele; Balla, Andrea; Paci, Marcello; Guerrieri, Mario; Lezoche, Giovanni; D'Ambrosio, Giancarlo; Fabiani, Bernardina; Ursi, Pietro; Paganini, Alessandro M\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAim of this study was to report the authors' experience with the anterior transperitoneal approach, and with an anterior submesocolic approach in case of left sided lesions. From January 1994 to January 2011, 122 males and 170 females with a mean age of 50.7 years (range: 19-84) underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) at 2 centers in Ancona and Rome (Italy) (that follow the same protocol). Fifteen patients underwent bilateral LA, the anterior transperitoneal approach was used in 233 cases (79.8%) and the anterior submesocolic in 59 (20.2%). One hundred and two patients had Conn's syndrome, 51 miscellaneous lesions, 55 Cushing's syndrome, 47 incidentalomas, 46 pheochromocytoma, 2 metastatic masses, 2 myelolipomas and 2 adrenogenital syndromes. The lesions had a mean diameter of 3.24 cm (range: 0.5-10). Mean operating time was 120 minutes (range: 30-390). Conversion to open surgery was required in 13 cases (4,45%). Blood pressure and heart rate were stable during the operation. There were 5 major complications. Mobilization and resumption of diet occurred on the first postoperative day. Mean hospital stay was 4.32 days (range: 2-30). Early identification and ligature of the adrenal vein, with minimal gland manipulation, are the major advantages, especially in case of pheochromocytoma. Adrenal masses can be successfully treated using a laparoscopic transperitoneal anterior approach, in presence of a suitable anesthesiological and surgical team's experience.

Between December 1997 and November 1999, 57 consecutive eligible patients with surgical adrenal disease were prospectively randomized to undergo TLA (25) or RLA (32). Study exclusion criteria were patient age greater than 80 years, body mass index greater than 40, bilateral adrenalectomy and significant prior abdominal surgery in the quadrant of interest. Mean followup was 5.96 years in the 2 groups. The groups were matched in regard to patient age (p = 0.84), body mass index (p = 0.43), American Society of Anesthesiologists class (p = 0.81) and laterality (p = 0.12). Median adrenal mass size was 2.7 cm (range 1 to 9) in the TLA group and 2.6 cm (range 0.5 to 6) in the RLA group (p = 0.83). TLA was comparable to RLA in terms of operative time (130 vs 126.5 minutes, p = 0.64), estimated blood loss (p = 0.92), specimen weight (p = 0.81), analgesic requirements (p = 0.25), hospital stay (p = 0.56) and the complication rate (p = 0.58). One case per group was electively converted to open surgery. Pathology data on the intact extracted specimens were similar between the groups. Averaged convalescence was 4.7 weeks in the TLA group and 2.3 weeks in the RLA group (p = 0.02). During a mean followup of 6 years 2 patients in the TLA group had a late complication (port site hernia). Mortality occurred in 5 patients, including 1 with TLA and 4 with RLA, during the 6-year followup. For most benign adrenal lesions requiring surgery laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be performed safely and effectively by the transperitoneal or the retroperitoneal approach.\n\nComparison of hydrocortisone and prednisone in the glucocorticoid replacement therapy post-adrenalectomy of Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Kunlong; Wang, Liang; Yang, Zhongyuan; Sui, Yingying; Li, Liming; Huang, Yuting; Gao, Peng\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCushing's syndrome requires glucocorticoid replacement following adrenalectomy. Based on a simplified glucocorticoid therapy scheme and the peri-operative observation, we investigated its efficacy and safety up to 6 months post-adrenalectomy in this cohort study. We found the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were normal post-adrenalectomy, and sufficient to stimulate the recovery of the dystrophic adrenal cortex, thus exogenous supplemental ACTH might not be necessary. Patients were grouped by oral reception of either hydrocortisone or prednisone since day 2 post-adrenalectomy. Both groups had similar baseline responses to adrenalectomy, regarding the correction of hypertension (10/15 vs.12/19), hyperglycemia (6/11 vs. 7/10), and hypokalemia (12/12 vs. 11/11). Most patients lost weight (17/20 vs. 20/22). Both groups reported significant improvement in a subjective evaluation questionnaire. Hydrocortisone showed advantages over prednisone in improving liver function (7/8 vs. 2/7, p = 0.035), but also caused significant lower extremety edema ( p = 0.034). Both groups developed adrenal insufficiency (AI) during glucocorticoid withdrawal, with no significant difference regarding the incidence rate (7/20 vs. 10/22) or severity. Most AI symptoms were relieved by resuming the prior oral doses, while two severe cases were hospitalized. The withdrawal process may last longer time for hydrocortisone than prednisone. In conclusion, our data supports the use of both hydrocortisone and prednisone in the glucocorticoid replacement therapy post-adrenalectomy for patients of adrenal adenoma or Cushing's disease. Hydrocortisone showed advantages over prednisone in improving liver function, and prednisone exhibited significantly lower risk of edema.\n\nReversible heart rhythm complexity impairment in patients with primary aldosteronism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLin, Yen-Hung; Wu, Vin-Cent; Lo, Men-Tzung; Wu, Xue-Ming; Hung, Chi-Sheng; Wu, Kwan-Dun; Lin, Chen; Ho, Yi-Lwun; Stowasser, Michael; Peng, Chung-Kang\n\n2015-08-01\n\nExcess aldosterone secretion in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) impairs their cardiovascular system. Heart rhythm complexity analysis, derived from heart rate variability (HRV), is a powerful tool to quantify the complex regulatory dynamics of human physiology. We prospectively analyzed 20 patients with aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) that underwent adrenalectomy and 25 patients with essential hypertension (EH). The heart rate data were analyzed by conventional HRV and heart rhythm complexity analysis including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multiscale entropy (MSE). We found APA patients had significantly decreased DFAÎ±2 on DFA analysis and decreased area 1-5, area 6-15, and area 6-20 on MSE analysis (all pâ<â0.05). Area 1-5, area 6-15, area 6-20 in the MSE study correlated significantly with log-transformed renin activity and log-transformed aldosterone-renin ratio (all pâ<â=â0.01). The conventional HRV parameters were comparable between PA and EH patients. After adrenalectomy, all the altered DFA and MSE parameters improved significantly (all pâ<â0.05). The conventional HRV parameters did not change. Our result suggested that heart rhythm complexity is impaired in APA patients and this is at least partially reversed by adrenalectomy.\n\nComparison of retroperitoneoscopic and transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy for right-sided benign tumors: a single-institute experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nChiang, Po Hui; Yu, Cheng Jen; Lee, Wei Ching; Wang, Hung Jen; Hsu, Wu Chi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThere is a lack of data regarding the appropriateness of transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches for right-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is any difference between right-sided transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (TLA) and retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (RLA). Our surgery database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent right-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomy with a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach since 2000. Fifty-five patients were enrolled (31 RLA and 24 TLA). Patient characteristics, as well as operative and perioperative details, were compared between the two groups. There was no difference in patient characteristics between the groups. There was a statistically significant difference (p=0.02) in blood loss (31.7Â±16.4 vs. 56.9Â±65.5 ml) between RLA and TLA when the patient's BMI was >26. There was no significant difference in operative time, conversion to open surgery, length of hospitalization, or time to oral intake between the groups. Right-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be performed safely and effectively via either RLA or TLA. Surgeons can adopt either approach with confidence depending on their preference if they are familiar with that approach. Â© 2015 S.

Recently, however, adrenalectomy by a mininvasive retroperitoneal approach has reached increasingly popularity as alternative technique. Short hospitalization, lower postoperative pain and decrease of complications and a better cosmetic resolution are the main advantages of these innovative techniques. In order to determine the better surgical management of adrenal neoplasms, the Authors analyzed and compared the feasibility and the postoperative complications of minimally invasive adrenalectomy approaches. A systematic research of the English literature, including major meta-analysis articles, clinical randomized trials, retrospective studies and systematic reviews was performed, comparing laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy versus retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy. Many studies support that posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy is superior or at least comparable to laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy in operation time, pain score, blood loss, hospitalization, complications rates and return to normal activity. However, laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy is up to now a safe and standardized procedure with a shorter learning curve and a similar low morbidity rate, even for tumors larger than 6 cm. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to objectively evaluate these techniques, excluding selection bias and bias related to differences in surgeons' experiences with this approaches.

The authors have recently changed from LA to PRA in suitable patients and audited their first 50 cases. Data were prospectively collected for 50 consecutive PRAs performed by the same surgeon. Patient demographics, tumour characteristics, analgesia use, operative and preparation time, length of stay, and complications were recorded. Fifty adrenalectomies were performed in 49 patients. The median (range) age was 58.5 years (30-83) and the majority of patients were female (n = 33, 66.0%). The median (interquartile range (IQR)) preparation time was 35.5 (28.5-50.0) and median operation time was 70.5 (54-85)âmin, which decreased during the study period. After a learning curve of 15 cases, median operative time reached 61âmin. PRA patients required minimal post-operative analgesia, with a median (IQR) of 0 (0-5) mg of intravenous morphine equivalent used. The median (IQR) length of stay was 1 (1-1) day, with 8 (16.0%) same-day discharges. There were four complications: one blood pressure lability from a phaeochromocytoma, one reintubation, one self-limited bleed and one temporary subcostal neuropraxia. There were no conversions to open surgery or deaths. Our results support previously published findings that PRA is a safe procedure, with a relatively short learning curve, resulting in minimal post-operative analgesia use and short length of hospital stay.

To analyze our results after 12 years of experience in this surgery and to compare with the main published series. we describe retrospectively 100 adrenalectomies performed between 1997-2009. Analyzed variables: age, size, side, preoperative diagnosis, operative time, blood loss, reconversion, hospital stay and histopathologic report. We utilized Fisher test and chi square test to compare categoric data. We utilized t-Student test to compare means from independent groups with normal distribution. We considered statistical significance when p<0.05. Mean age was 53.1 years (+/-14.4). Mean size was 3,7 cm (+/-2.2). In 51% of cases it was the left side. Mean follow-up was 15 months (+/-11.9). Preoperative diagnosis was: functional mass (44%), pheocromocytome (17%), incedentaloma>4 cm (20%), metastasis (10%) and adrenal carcinoma (5%). Mean operative time was 145.1 min (+/-55.6). Mean hematocrite loss was 6.26 points (+/-3.3). Reconversion rate was 9.6%. 2 cases of prolonged postoperative ileus. 2 patients required transfusion. 1 patient death because of an descompensation of liver cirrhosis. 80% of complications were on right side. Mean hospital stay was 6 days (+/-5.6). In last 30 procedures we realized statistical differences with first group, in terms of operative time (119.1 min vs 171.2 min) and hospital stay (4.1 days vs 6.1) (p<0.05). Transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a surgical feasible and safe procedure in urological groups with previous laparoscopic experience.

Although traditionally, laparoscopic approach was recommended only for tumor sizes less than 6-8 cm--as larger tumors were known to have an increased risk of malignancy--the currently growing experience and improvement of surgical techniques has allowed for an extension of the therapeutic indication, as shown by the recent case report of LA use for a benign 22 cm tumor (1). We report the case of a young patient operated in our Department for a benign 20 cm adrenal tumor for which laparoscopic \"hand-assisted\" adrenalectomy yielded a good postoperative outcome and minimal complications.\n\nEffects of adrenalectomy on the alpha-adrenergic regulation of cytosolic free calcium in hepatocytes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFreudenrich, C.C.; Borle, A.B.\n\n1988-06-25\n\nWe have previously published that bilateral adrenalectomy in the rat reduces the Ca2+-mediated alpha-adrenergic activation of hepatic glycogenolysis, while it increases the cellular calcium content of hepatocytes. In the experiments presented here, the concentration of cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i) at rest and in response to epinephrine was measured in aequorin-loaded hepatocytes isolated from sham and adrenalectomized male rats. We found that in adrenalectomized rats the resting Ca2+i was elevated, the rise in Ca2+i evoked by epinephrine was reduced, and the rise in /sup 45/Ca efflux that follows such stimulation was depressed. Furthermore, the slope of the relationship between Ca2+i andmoreÂ Â» calcium efflux was decreased 60% in adrenalectomized. Adrenalectomy did not change Ca2+ release from intracellular calcium pools in response to IP3 in saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes. The EC50 for inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and the maximal Ca2+ released were similar in both sham and adrenalectomized animals. Finally, the liver calmodulin content determined by radioimmunoassay was not significantly different between sham and adrenalectomized rats. These results suggest that 1) adrenalectomy reduces calcium efflux from the hepatocyte, probably by an effect on the plasma membrane (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase-dependent Ca2+ pump and thus alters cellular calcium homeostasis; 2) adrenalectomy decreases the rise in Ca2+i in response to epinephrine; 3) this decreased rise in Ca2+i is not due to defects in the intracellular Ca2+ storage and mobilization processes; and 4) the effects of adrenalectomy on cellular calcium metabolism and on alpha-adrenergic activation of glycogenolysis are not caused by a reduction in soluble calmodulin.Â«Â less\n\nAnalysis of postoperative biochemical values and clinical outcomes after adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwearingen, Andrew J; Kahramangil, Bora; Monteiro, Rosebel; Krishnamurthy, Vikram; Jin, Judy; Shin, Joyce; Siperstein, Allan; Berber, Eren\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPrimary aldosteronism causes hypertension and hypokalemia and is often surgically treatable. Diagnosis includes elevated plasma aldosterone, suppressed plasma renin activity, and elevated aldosterone renin ratio. Adrenalectomy improves hypertension and hypokalemia. Postoperative plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity may be useful in documenting cure or failure. A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism from 2010 to 2016 was performed, analyzing preoperative and postoperative plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, hypertension, and hypokalemia. The utility of postoperative testing was assessed. Clinical cure was defined as improved hypertension control and resolution of potassium loss. Biochemical cure was defined as aldosterone renin ratio reduction to <23.6. Forty-four patients were included; 20 had plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity checked on postoperative day 1. In the study, 40/44 (91%) were clinically cured. All clinical failures had of biochemical failure at follow-up. Postoperative day 1aldosterone renin ratio <23.6 had PPV of 95% for clinical cure. Cured patients had mean plasma aldosterone drop of 33.1âng/dL on postoperative day 1; noncured patient experienced 3.9âng/dL increase. A cutoff of plasma aldosterone decrease of 10âng/dL had high positive predictive value for clinical cure. Changes in plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity after adrenalectomy correlate with improved hypertension and hypokalemia. The biochemical impact of adrenalectomy manifests as early as postoperative day 1. We propose a plasma aldosterone decrease of 10âng/dL as a criterion to predict clinical cure.

While laparoscopic adrenalectomy is well-established in adults, it is rarely used in infants and is associated with some concerns. A seven-month infant was referred to our hospital due to progressive signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Laboratory data confirmed ACTH-independent hypercortisolism. No history of exogenous corticosteroid contact was observed. The patient underwent left transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy when she was 7 months old, nevertheless,complete response was not seen. The patient underwent right laparoscopic adrenalectomy (contra-lateral adrenal gland) when she was 20 months old. The signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome began to resolve and serum and urine cortisol levels became normal 3 months after the second surgery. laparoscopic adrenalectomy is safe and feasible in infants, and in this case, relieved patient of the symptoms and saved her life.\n\nMovement System Impairment-Guided Approach to the Physical Therapist Treatment of a Patient With Postpartum Pelvic Organ Prolapse and Mixed Urinary Incontinence: Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurz, Jenny; Borello-France, Diane\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWomen with postpartum pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and urinary incontinence are often treated by physical therapists specializing in women's health. Movement system impairments often coexist in this patient population. The purpose of this case report is to describe the physical therapist treatment of a woman with postpartum POP complicated by additional pelvic symptoms. A 31-year-old woman presented with postpartum POP, diastasis recti, urinary incontinence, and constipation. Movement system impairments were consistent with a physical therapist diagnosis of femoral adduction-medial rotation syndrome exacerbated by levator ani muscle weakness and incoordination and impaired intra-abdominal pressure regulation. Interventions, based on a movement system guided approach, included postural correction; pelvic-floor, abdominal, and hip muscle strengthening; functional training to correct identified movement faults; and patient education. Movement system impairment outcomes included: correction of femoral adduction-medial rotation and knee hyperextension during standing at rest, ambulation, and exercise; increased hip muscle strength; and effective regulation of intra-abdominal pressure (resolution of breath holding with the Valsalva maneuver) during all transitional movements and therapeutic exercise. The patient also demonstrated reductions in POP, urinary, and colorectal symptom severity that exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. Additionally, she demonstrated a reduction in diastasis rectus distance. A movement system impairment-guided approach led the physical therapist to consider impairments outside the pelvic floor that could have contributed to the patient's pelvic symptoms. Using this approach, the patient achieved resolution of musculoskeletal and movement impairments and reductions in POP, urinary and colorectal symptoms, and symptom-related distress.

Our group described the technique for robot-assisted PRA (RAPRA) in 2010. Few studies are available that directly compare outcomes between the available operative approaches. We reviewed our results for minimally invasive adrenalectomy using the three different approaches over a 10-year period. Between January 2005 and April 2015, 160 minimally invasive adrenalectomies were performed. Clinicopathologic data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoints evaluated were operative time, blood loss, length of stay (LOS), and morbidity. The study included 67 TLA, 76 PRA, and 17 RAPRA procedures. Tumor size for PRA/RAPRA was smaller than for patients undergoing TLA (2.38 vs 3.6Â cm, pÂ â¤Â 0.0001). Procedure time was shorter for PRA versus TLA (133.3 vs 152.8Â min, pÂ =Â 0.0381), as was LOS (1.85 vs 2.82Â days, pÂ =Â 0.0145). Procedure time was longer in RAPRA versus TLA/PRA (177 vs 153/133Â min, pÂ =Â 0.008), but LOS was significantly decreased (1.53 vs 2.82/1.85Â days, pÂ =Â 0.004). Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is associated with expected excellent outcomes regardless of approach. In our series, the posterior approach is associated with decreased operative time and LOS. Robotic technology provides potential advantages for the surgeon at the expense of more complex setup requirements and costs. Further study is required to demonstrate clear benefit of one surgical approach. Utilization of the entire spectrum of available operative techniques can allow for selection of the optimal approach based on individual patient factors.\n\nRobotic versus laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nAliyev, Shamil; Karabulut, Koray; Agcaoglu, Orhan; Wolf, Katherine; Mitchell, Jamie; Siperstein, Allan; Berber, Eren\n\n2013-12-01\n\nAlthough initial reports demonstrated the safety and feasibility of robotic adrenalectomy (RA), there are scant data on the use of this approach for pheochromocytoma. The aim of this study is to compare perioperative outcomes and efficacy of RA versus laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) for pheochromocytoma. Within 3 years, 25 patients underwent 26 RA procedures for pheochromocytoma. These patients were compared with 40 patients who underwent 42 LA procedures before the start of the robotic program. Data were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained, IRB-approved adrenal database. Demographic and clinical parameters at presentation were similar between the groups, except for a larger tumor size in the robotic group. In both groups, skin-to-skin operative time, estimated blood loss less, and intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were similar. The conversion to open rate was 3.9 % in the robotic and 7.5 % in the laparoscopic group (p = .532). There was no morbidity or mortality in the robotic group; morbidity was 10 % (p = .041) and mortality 2.5 % in the laparoscopic group. The pain score on postoperative day 1 was lower, and the length of hospital stay shorter in the robotic group (1.2 Â± .1 vs. 1.7 Â± .1 days, p = .036). To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing robotic versus laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytoma. Our results show that the robotic approach is similar to the laparoscopic regarding safety and efficacy. The lower morbidity, less immediate postoperative pain, and shorter hospital stay observed in the robotic approach warrant further investigation in future larger studies.\n\n[Investigation of urinary management after removal of indwelling urethral catheters in a general hospital: associations between bedridden state and impaired bladder emptying].\n\nPubMed\n\nTsuchiyama, Katsuki; Ueki, Osamu; Minami, Hidero; Kawaguchi, Kouhei; Aoki, Yoshitaka; Yokoyama, Osamu\n\n2010-06-01\n\nIn this study we investigated the influences of decreased levels of activities of daily living (ADL), especially in bedridden patients,on lower urinary tract dysfunction and urinary management during hospital care. All 1,106 non-urological inpatients (896 non-bedridden patients and 210 bedridden patients) with an indwelling urethral catheter treated at Noto General Hospital between April 2006 and October 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. Maximum bladder capacity and post-void residual urine volume (PVR) were evaluated with uroflowmetry or voiding cystourethrography at the time the catheter was removed. Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and drug administration were performed for patients who had a PVR of 100 ml or more. Bedridden patients required urinary interventions at a higher rate than did non-bedridden patients (bedridden : 29.0%,non-bedridden : 17.6%). Although indwelling urethral catheters were reinserted in 13 patients in the bedridden group and 16 patients in the non-bedridden group,many patients in both groups could be free from the catheter. Our results indicate that patients with low ADL are vulnerable to impaired bladder emptying,and early diagnosis of impaired bladder emptying and active urinary management are required to solve their urinary problems.\n\nRetroperitoneal endoscopic adrenalectomy is safe and effective.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchreinemakers, J M J; Kiela, G J; Valk, G D; Vriens, M R; Rinkes, I H M Borel\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to review an experience with retroperitoneal endoscopic adrenalectomy (REA). This is the procedure of choice for adrenal tumours at this institution. Between 1997 and 2008, 112 REAs were performed in a single university centre. Data were retrieved retrospectively from a prospectively collected database, including information on patient demographics, surgical procedure, complications and hospital stay. One hundred and twelve REAs were carried out successfully in 105 patients, including seven bilateral adrenalectomies. Thirty-nine patients with unilateral adrenal disease had a phaeochromocytoma, of whom 16 had multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, 21 patients had Cushing's disease and 20 had Conn's disease. Median body mass index was 27 (interquartile range 23-29) kg/m(2). The median duration of unilateral operations was 100 (90-130) min with a median blood loss of 5 ml. Median tumour size was 3.1 (2.0-4.4) cm. Conversion from REA to open surgery was needed in two patients. Seven patients experienced postoperative complications (2 major, 5 minor). One patient needed a reoperation. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days. A learning curve with a significant decrease in operating time was observed over the years. REA appears to be a safe and effective surgical technique for adrenal gland tumours up to 6 cm in diameter, with a minimal complication rate. Copyright Â© 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to investigate effect of reduced lung function and exposure to background PAHs on diabetes. A total of 2730 individuals were drawn from the Wuhan-Zhuhai (WHZH) Cohort Study (n=3053). Participants completed physical examination, measurement of lung function and urinary monohydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs). Risk factors for type 2 diabetes were identified by multiple logistic regression analysis, and the presence of additive interaction between levels of urinary OH-PAHs and lower lung function was evaluated by calculation of the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and attributable proportion due to interaction (AP). Urinary OH-PAHs levels was positively associated with type 2 diabetes among individuals with impaired lung function (p<0.05). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, odd ratio (OR): 0.664, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.491-0.900) and forced vital capacity (FVC, OR: 0.693, 95% CI: 0.537-0.893) were negatively associated with diabetes among individuals. Additive interaction of higher urinary levels of OH-PAHs and lower FVC (RERI: 0.679, 95% CI: 0.120-1.238); AP: 0.427, 95% CI: 0.072-0.782) was associated with diabetes. Exposure to background PAHs was related to diabetes among individuals with lower lung function. Urinary levels of OH-PAHs and reduced lung function had an additive effect on diabetes.

Clinical experience with 68 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nPugliese, Raffaele; Boniardi, Marco; Sansonna, Fabio; Maggioni, Dario; De Carli, Stefano; Costanzi, Andrea; Scandroglio, Ildo; Ferrari, Giovanni Carlo; Di Lernia, Stefano; Magistro, Carmelo; Loli, Paola; Grossrubatscher, Erika\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to analyze feasibility and outcomes of laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA). Pathology, size and bilateral site of lesions were considered. Between December 1998 and May 2007 in our institution a total of 68 patients of mean age of 53 years underwent unilateral (n=57) or bilateral (n=11) LA. Adrenal masses averaged 5.4cm in size (range 1.2-13cm) and 56.7g in weight (range 10-265) including 71 benign and 8 malignant lesions. A total of 79 adrenal glands were resected, 44 right sided and 35 left sided. Removal was complete in 77 cases and partial (sparing adrenalectomy) in 1 patient affected by bilateral pheochomocytoma. Three left adrenalectomies for pheochromocytoma were robot-assisted. The transperitoneal lateral approach was preferred and the posterior retroperitoneal approach was adopted in 5 patients. The mean duration of surgery for each LA was 138+/-90min and 3.8 trocar were used on average (range 3-6). Conversion was needed in 3 cases owing to difficult dissection of large masses. Estimated mean blood loss for each LA was 95+/-30ml and it was greater for bilateral LA. Mortality was nil and morbidity was 5.8%. The average length of hospital stay (LOS) in surgical unit was 4+/-2.4 days (range 2-8). Patients affected by hormone secreting or bilateral lesions, by unilateral or bilateral pheochromocytoma and by bilateral Cushing's disease were transferred to the endocrinological ward so that their overall hospital stay was prolonged to 9+/-2.8 days on average (range 7-17). Mean duration of follow-up of patients was 38 months (range 2-100) and demonstrated acceptable endocrine results. Three primary cortical carcinomas were discovered as chance findings on histologic examination. While long-term results after LA for cortical carcinomas were poor and LA is not recommended in such cases, long-term results after LA for adrenal metastases were encouraging.\n\nAdrenalectomy for adrenal-mediated hypertension: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis of an institutional experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nShada, Amber L; Stokes, Jayme B; Turrentine, Florence E; Simpson, Virginia B; Padia, Shetal H; Carey, Robert M; Hanks, John B; Smith, Philip W\n\n2014-11-01\n\nAdrenal-mediated hypertension (AMH) has been increasingly treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA). Metabolic derangements in patients with AMH could result in perioperative complications and mortality. Long-term operative and clinical outcomes after laparoscopic treatment of AMH have not been evaluated using large clinical databases. The institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data for patients undergoing adrenalectomy for AMH between 2002 and 2012 were reviewed. Patient demographics, perioperative variables, and outcomes were analyzed and compared with national NSQIP adrenalectomy data. Improvement in AMH was recorded when discontinuation or reduction of antihypertensive medication occurred or with a decrease of blood pressure on the preoperative antihypertensive regimen. Ninety-four patients underwent adrenalectomy. There were 48 patients with pheochromocytoma (PHE) and 46 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). Eighty-five patients (90%) were taking antihypertensive medications preoperatively compared with 36 patients (38%) postoperatively (P < 0.0001). Patients with PHE were more likely to discontinue all medications compared with the patients with APA (80 vs 20%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Patients with PHE and APA, respectively, took an average of 2.0 and 3.2 antihypertensive medications preoperatively compared with 0.3 and 1.2 postoperatively. There were no conversions to open procedures or 30-day mortality. Our results were 0 per cent for cerebral vascular accident, 0 per cent for myocardial infarction, and 0.5 per cent for transfusions compared with the national NSQIP data of 0.2, 0, and 6.7 per cent, respectively. Patients presenting with significant AMH including PHE and APA can be effectively and safely treated with LA with minimal complications and with a significant number of patients eliminating or decreasing their need for antihypertensive medications.\n\nMetachronous adrenal metastasis from operated contralateral renal cell carcinoma with adrenalectomy and iatrogenic Addison's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzturk, Hakan; Karaaslan, Serap\n\n2014-09-01\n\nMetachronous adrenal metastasis from contralateral renal cell carcinoma (RCC) surgery is an extremely rare condition. Iatrogenic Addison's disease occurring after metastasectomy (adrenalectomy) is an even rarer clinical entity. We present a case of a 68-year-old male with hematuria and left flank pain 9 years prior. The patient underwent left transperitoneal radical nephrectomy involving the ipsilateral adrenal glands due to a centrally-located, 75-mm in diameter solid mass lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney. The tumour lesion was confined within the renal capsule, and the histo-pathological examination revealed a Fuhrman nuclear grade II clear cell carcinoma. The patient underwent transperitoneal right adrenalectomy. The histopathological examination revealed metastasis of clear cell carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with iatrogenic Addison's disease based on the measurement of serum cortisol levels and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, after which glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement was initiated. The patient did not have local recurrence or new metastasis in the first year of the follow-up. The decision to perform ipsilateral adrenalectomy during radical nephrectomy constitutes a challenge, and the operating surgeon must consider all these rare factors.\n\nQuality of life in women with urinary incontinence.\n\nPubMed\n\nMladenoviÄ Segedi, Ljiljana; Segedi, Dimitrije; ParezanoviÄ IliÄ, Katarina\n\n2011-08-01\n\nTo determine the characteristics of urinary incontinence and its impact on the quality of life in adult women with urinary incontinence who presented to a tertiary care clinic of Vojvodina from September 2008 to May 2009 for treatment We used a prospective case-control study. Cases were defined as patients (47) with urinary incontinence symptoms. Controls (50) were defined as patients without urinary incontinence who presented to a tertiary care gynecology clinic for other reasons. Both, cases and controls, completed two questionnaires recommended for the evaluation of symptoms, The Urinary Distress Inventory, and quality of life impact The Urinary Impact Questionnaire. There was a significant correlation between aging (r=0.614; p<0.01), body mass index (r=0.357; p<0.01) and menopause (r= -0.572; p<0.01) and urinary incontinence. All patients had symptoms of stress incontinence, 61.7% had urge incontinence symptoms, 21.3% voiding difficulty and 85.1% dysuria. Ninety-four patients believed that urinary incontinence impaired their quality of life: 50% of patients reported an impaired ability to do household activities, 59.1% avoided social activities, 70.4% reported an impaired ability to travel more than 30 minutes by car or bus, 88.6% avoided leisure activities, 45.5% of patients had impaired emotional health and 34% felt frustrated. The dominant type of urinary incontinence in more than half of the respondents was a mixed type, with moderate to very severe problems. Symptoms of urinary incontinence interfere with the performance of everyday household and social activities, causing the appearance of anxiety, depression and frustration, and in more than 50% of women leads to reduced quality of life.\n\nContralateral suppression of aldosterone at adrenal venous sampling predicts hyperkalemia following adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism.\n\nPubMed\n\nShariq, Omair A; Bancos, Irina; Cronin, Patricia A; Farley, David R; Richards, Melanie L; Thompson, Geoffrey B; Young, William F; McKenzie, Travis J\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe aimed to determine whether a greater degree of contralateral suppression of aldosterone secretion at adrenal venous sampling predicted the development of postoperative hyperkalemia after unilateral adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism. A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing unilateral adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism between 2004-2015 was performed. Clinical and biochemical parameters of patients who developed hyperkalemia (â¥5.2âmmol/L) after unilateral adreanlectomy were compared with those who remained normokalemic. The contralateral suppression index was defined as the aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio from the nondominant adrenal vein divided by the aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio from the external iliac vein. Of 192 patients who met criteria for inclusion, 12 (6.3%) developed hyperkalemia (median serum potassium 5.5âmmol/L, range 5.2-6.2âmmol/L), with a median time to onset of 13.5 days (range 7-55âdays). Five patients had transiently increased serum potassium concentrations that normalized spontaneously. Four patients received mineralocorticoid replacement therapy with fludrocortisone. On univariate analysis, hyperkalemic patients had slightly greater preoperative serum creatinine levels (1.2 vs 1.0âmg/dL, Pâ=â.01), higher postoperative creatinine (1.3 vs 1.0âmg/dL, Pâ=â.02), lesser median contralateral suppression index (0.14 vs 0.27, Pâ=â.03), and larger adenomas (1.9 vs 1.4âcm, P = .02). On multivariable logistic regression, the contralateral suppression index remained the only significant predictor of postoperative hyperkalemia (Pâ=â.04) with an optimal cut-off of <0.47. Hyperkalemia after unilateral adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism is uncommon and usually transient, but may require mineralocorticoid supplementation. Patients with a contralateral suppression index of <0.47 require meticulous follow-up and monitoring of serum potassium concentrations after unilateral adrenalectomy. Copyright Â© 2017\n\nComparison of long-term prognosis of laparoscopic and open adrenalectomy for local adrenal neuroblastoma in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nYao, Wei; Dong, Kuiran; Li, Kai; Zheng, Shan; Xiao, Xianmin\n\n2018-06-07\n\nTo investigate and compare long-term outcomes in children undergoing laparoscopic or open adrenalectomy for local adrenal neuroblastoma. A retrospective review was conducted of 37 children with local adrenal neuroblastoma treated between January 2005 and December 2013 in our hospital. These patients met inclusion criteria for having adrenal neuroblastoma and undergoing operative resection. All patients were successfully followed up until December 2017. The local adrenal neuroblastoma cases included 25 males and 12 females with an average age of 37.24âÂ±â37.55Â months (range from 5Â days to 158Â months). Left adrenal lesions were present in 13 cases, the right in 24 cases. According to the INSS staging system, 27 patients were classified as stage I and 10 as stage II. Open adrenalectomy was performed in 24 patients. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in the other 13 patients, 2 of whom were converted to open surgery because of adhesions to renal vessels and diaphragmatic rupture. Significant differences were observed between the laparoscopic surgery and open surgery groups regarding tumor size (Pâ=â0.005). There were two recurrence cases in open surgery, but there was no recurrence in laparoscopic surgery. The average follow-up time was 86.78âÂ±â24.52Â months. The overall 5-year survival rate of open and laparoscopic surgery were 86.2 and 100% (Pâ=â0.316). Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for neuroblastoma is feasible and can be performed with equivalent recurrence and mortality rates with open resection. For small tumor size and absence of vascular encasement, the adrenal neuroblastoma may be preferred laparoscopic surgery.\n\nA Comparison of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy in Patients With Primary Hyperaldosteronism.\n\nPubMed\n\nColvin, Jennifer; Krishnamurthy, Vikram; Jin, Judy; Shin, Joyce; Siperstein, Allan; Berber, Eren\n\n2017-10-01\n\nOver the last decade, robotic approaches have been described for removing adrenal tumors. Although there are reports comparing robotic and laparoscopic techniques in general, there are limited data on outcomes in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA). The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of robotic adrenalectomy (RA) versus laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) for PHA. The records of 20 patients who underwent RA for PHA were compared with 16 patients who underwent LA between 2000 and 2014. Data were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained, IRB-approved adrenal database. Statistical analysis was performed using t test and the Fisher exact analysis. Continuous variables are reported as meanÂ±SEM. Demographic and clinical parameters were similar between the groups. There were no conversions to open in either group. Estimated blood loss, length of stay, and complication rates were comparable. Operative time was shorter in the robotic versus laparoscopic group (130Â±8.94 vs. 159Â±11.1 min, P=0.0487). In follow-up, the improvement in patients' blood pressure after adrenalectomy, as assessed by the reduction in the number of antihypertensive medications, was similar between the 2 groups. However, 1 patient in the RA and 1 patient in the LA group were not cured, as determined by postoperative aldosterone:renin levels. The biochemical cure rate between the groups was similar (P=0.529). To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing robotic versus laparoscopic resection of PHA. Our results show that the robotic approach was similar to laparoscopic regarding safety and efficacy. Operative time was shorter with the robotic approach, which could be related to more efficient dissection with wristed instrumentation.\n\nSevere hyperkalemia following adrenalectomy for aldosteronoma: prediction, pathogenesis and approach to clinical management- a case series.\n\nPubMed\n\nTahir, A; McLaughlin, K; Kline, G\n\n2016-07-27\n\nAs the field of Primary Aldosteronism (PA) becomes ever expanded, diagnosis of PA is increasingly diagnosed by endocrinologists. With increased PA screening, many of the cases are now found in patients with complex co-morbidities in addition to their hypertension. Post adrenalectomy renal impairment with hyperkalemia is now increasingly seen in these complex patients, as evidenced by the numerous reports on this issue that have appeared within the past 3Â years. We present a small case series to illustrate the breadth of the problem, along with a discussion about how such CKD/hyperkalemic events may be predicted. We present three cases of primary aldosteronism with long standing hypertension (more than 10Â years) hypokalemia (2.0-3.0Â mmol/l). Serum aldosterone was high with low renin activity leading to high aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR). They underwent abdominal CT scan revealing adrenal mass and adrenal vein sample confirmed lateralization. None of the patients had evidence of renal disease before surgery (as evident by normal eGFR and serum creatinine). Post adrenalectomy they had reduction in the blood pressure and became eukalemic. Serum aldosterone and renin activity were low leading to a low ARR. Case 1 developed hyperkalemia and increased serum creatinine 6Â weeks post operatively which resolved with initiation of fludrocortisone and every attempt to discontinue fludrocortisone resulted in hyperkalemia and rising creatinine. Her hyperkalemia is under control with oral sodium bicarbonate. Case 2 developed hyperkalemia and increasing creatinine 2Â months post operatively transiently requiring fludrocortisone and later on managed with furosemide for hyperkalemia. Case 3 developed renal impairment and hyperkalemia 2Â weeks post operatively requiring fludrocortisone. Post APA resection severe hyperkalemia may be a common entity and screening should be actively considered in high risk patients.

The objective of this study was to identify the best evaluation test and to determine an impairment rating model of urinary incontinence. In performing a cross-sectional study comparing successive urodynamic tests using both the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) and the 1-hr pad-weighing test in 120 patients, we performed statistical likelihood ratio analysis and used logistic regression to calculate the probability of urodynamic incontinence using the most significant independent predictors. Subsequently, we created a template that was based on the significant predictors and the probability of urodynamic incontinence. The mean ICIQ-UI-SF score was 13.5âÂ±â4.6, and the median pad test value was 8âg. The discrimination statistic (receiver operating characteristic) described how well the urodynamic observations matched the ICIQ-UI-SF scores (under curve area (UDA):0.689) and the pad test data (UDA: 0.693). Using logistic regression analysis, we demonstrated that the best independent predictors of urodynamic incontinence were the patient's age and the ICIQ-UI-SF score. The logistic regression model permitted us to construct an equation to determine the probability of urodynamic incontinence. Using these tools, we created a template to generate a probability index of urodynamic urinary incontinence. Using this probability index, relative to the patient and to the maximum impairment of the whole person (MIWP) relative to urinary incontinence, we were able to calculate a patient's permanent impairment.

A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our department because of a tumor of the right adrenal gland and a small tumor of the right kidney. The patient underwent simultaneous laparoscopic adrenalectomy and laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery. The postoperative period was uncomplicated. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 4th postoperative day. We believe that the proposed way of trocar placement would help to avoid a ârolloverâ problem between the laparoscope and a Satinsky clamp or a âcrossing swordsâ problem between a Satinsky clamp and manipulators.

The study included 520 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal tumor. The entire study group was divided depending on the body mass index: group 1 (normal weight), <25 kg/m 2 ; group 2 (overweight), 25-30 kg/m 2 ; and group 3 (obese) 30-40 kg/m 2 . Additionally, group 4 (morbidly obese) was distinguished. Study end-points were: operative time, intraoperative blood loss, total length of hospital stay, morbidity rate and 30-day readmission rate. The mean operative times were 88.8, 94.7, 93.5, and 99.9 min in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (P = 0.1444). Complications were comparable between groups (12.8% vs 8.8% vs 8.2% vs 11.5%, P = 0.5295). The mean intraoperative blood loss was 66.8 versus 78.3 versus 60.7 versus 92.4, P = 0.1399. There were no differences in conversion rate between groups. Obesity has no influence on short-term outcomes of laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy. This procedure is feasible regardless of the body mass index. Therefore, it can be offered to"
