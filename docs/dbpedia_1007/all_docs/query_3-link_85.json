He led his team Jena averaging 14,1 points. He has also been one of the crucial players of the German national team at the U16 European Championships averaging 8,3 points.\n\n“Jakob stands out for his positive attitude during practice both in terms of extensiveness as well as regarding intensity. His work ethic is very good and therefore I think he deserved to be named NBBL-All-Star. But not only Jakob performes great in the NBBL; it is extremely important for all German U17 players to gain experience in the league”, U17 Head Coach Frank Menz commented.\n\nBesides Krumbeck, Besnik Bekteshi (BBA Ludwigsburg) who has recently joined the U17 squad has been awarded with a nomination for the NBBL-All-Star Game. Bekteshi earned a nomination for a training camp before Christmas and is now on Coach Menz’ radar screen.\n\nThe following Youth Players from the German national teams have been awarded the All-Star honors:\n\nOle Wendt (Paderborn Baskets, U18), Anthony Canty (Eisbären Bremerhaven, U20), Lars Wendt (Paderborn Baskets, U18), Mathis Mönninghoff (Bayer Giants Leverkusen, U18), Niels Giffey (ALBA Berlin, U20), Patrick Heckmann (ASC Theresianum Mainz, U18), Kevin Bright (Team ALBA Urspring, U18), Danilo Barthel (Basket-College Rhein-Neckar, U20), Philip Neumann (TSV Tröster Breitengüßbach, U18), and Justin Raffington (Team ALBA Urspring, U18)."
