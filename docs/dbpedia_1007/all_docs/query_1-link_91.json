        "text": "What are the Essential Documents in a clinical trial? We always speak about the importance of the Essential Documents and especially, of the importance of, as a CRA, having these documents collected and filed properly. But where do these come from and why is it so important? Even more, what are those documents? üìë We've all heard about ICH GCP E6 R2, isn't it? Well, this guideline mentions all the Essential Documents one by one and it religiously mentions where these documents should be stored: Investigator Site File, Sponsor File (eTMF), or maybe both. The guideline also categorizes the documents in 3 groups: 1Ô∏è‚É£ documents generated before the clinical phase of the trial starts, 2Ô∏è‚É£ generated during the clinical conduct of the trial, and 3Ô∏è‚É£ generated after the completion or termination of the trial. Here are some of the Essential Documentsüëá: ‚ñ∏Investigator Brochure and Amendments ‚ñ∏Protocol and Amendments ‚ñ∏Insurance Statement ‚ñ∏Competent Authority Approvals ‚ñ∏CV of participating investigators ‚ñ∏Laboratory Ranges ‚ñ∏Trial Initiation Report ‚ñ∏Master Randomization List ‚ñ∏Informed Consent Form ‚ñ∏Monitoring Visit Reports ‚ñ∏Subject Enrollment Log ‚ñ∏Case Form Reports (CRFs) ‚ñ∏IP (Investigational Product) Accountability among others. #clinicaltrials #clinicalresearchassociate #clinicaldocumentation #etmf\n\n5 things to spot when you do a quality check üîç Quality checks of the Investigator Site File (ISF) are required as per Monitoring Plan. Maybe with a frequency of every 2 monitoring visits or maybe with a frequency of ‚Äúfull ISF quality check every 6 months‚Äù. Either way, how does a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) perform a quality check? Here‚Äôs 5Ô∏è‚É£ things to spot when you do a quality check of the Investigator Site File: üìë Follow the ISF Index. The ISF comes with an index that tells you not only where should each document in a clinical trial be filed but also, which documents should be filed. Follow the index to make sure every section is complete. üìÉ Check for the latest version. Within each section (regulatory, monitoring visits or drug accountability, etc.), check that the latest version has been filed. Have your own tracker of each document type and its versions and crosscheck with the ISF that all versions are filed. üìâ Review training records against the Delegation of Authority (DOA) log. When reviewing CVs, GCPs, certificates, make sure you review against the DOA log. The log tells you which site staff we have in the trial, since when and you can check all certificates one by one. üìì Check Informed Consent Forms: the footer, the dates, the initials and the signatures. ICFs are the most important document when it comes to patient safety. Check that the footer of the document is correct (study code, date and version), that investigator signed with full name, added initials and correct date. Check that patients has also signed and dated and that both dates match. üìí Spot missing information and create Note to Files. Note to Files are empty document templates personalized per study in which you can explain why a section in the ISF is empty or why a document is dated incorrectly. Have Note to Files ready for you to just fill in the information that explains any discrepancy in the ISF and file it, both in the ISF and electronic Trial Master File. For more practical knowledge vital for the Clinical Research Associate, you can access the Course Clinical Trial Monitoring Essentials for CRAs that goes live tomorrow, March 8!! üî• It gives you free access to the private CRAConnect community for 1 month where you can learn, share and engage with other CRAs. https://cracourse.com #clinicalreseachassociate #craconnect #qualitycheck #clinicaltrials"
