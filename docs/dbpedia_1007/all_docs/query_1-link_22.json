        "text": "WWE is an American professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut.[1] It is owned and operated by TKO Group Holdings, a majority owned subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings. WWE personnel consists of professional wrestlers, managers, play-by-play and color commentators, ring announcers, interviewers, referees, trainers, producers, script writers, and various other positions. Executives and board members are also listed.\n\nOverview\n\nAs of 2024, WWE employs over 800 full-time employees as part of its business operations, spread across its three segments: Media, Live Events, and Consumer Products. In addition, they contract with other vendors and service providers.[2] As part of WWE's Live Events segment, their performers are described as \"independent contractors\",[1] with contracts for performers typically ranging from short developmental to multi-year deals.[3][4]\n\nBrands\n\nSince the reintroduction of WWE's brand extension in 2016, performers are assigned to one of two primary \"main roster\" brands: Raw and SmackDown.\n\nA third brand, NXT, had originally been designated as a developmental brand for the main roster. In 2019 it was elevated to the third main roster brand.[5][6][7] But in 2021, the brand's weekly television show was rebooted as \"NXT 2.0\", and was the brand was reinstated to its original status as the developmental division for the main roster (Raw and SmackDown), though it has since dropped the \"2.0\" name.[8]\n\nMain roster performers primarily appear on Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown, while developmental wrestlers appear on NXT, and its supplemental show NXT: Level Up. WWE's Main Event program – while primarily a Raw brand supplemental show – also periodically features NXT wrestlers as well.\n\nPerformers may also appear on WWE's other weekly television programming, as well as pay-per-views, and on untelevised live events.\n\nPersonnel in WWE's developmental system are additionally assigned to train at the Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. UK-based developmental wrestlers train at the UK Performance Center in London, England.\n\nChampionships\n\nFor the most part, the brands have their own distinct championships, but some select titles are shared amongst all the brands, such as the WWE Speed Championship for male wrestlers, and the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship for female wrestlers.\n\nMain roster\n\nRaw\n\nMen's division\n\nRing name Real name Notes [9] Sunny Dhinsa [10] Akira Tozawa[11] [12] Adam Scherr[13] [14] Bronson Rechsteiner[15] Intercontinental Champion \"Big\" Bronson Reed[16] Jermaine Haley[17] [Note 1][18]\n\n(Uncle Howdy) Taylor Rotunda [19] Drew Kasper[20] [21] Carlos Colón Coates Jr. [22] Charles Betts[23] [24] Phillip Brooks[25] [26] Raúl Mendoza [27] Luis Martínez[28] [29]\n\n(Mercy the Buzzard) Samuel Shaw[30] [31] Dominik Gutiérrez[30] [32] Undisclosed[Note 2] [33] Andrew Galloway IV[34] [35]\n\n(Ramblin' Rabbit) Joseph Ruud [36] Fergal Devitt[37] World Tag Team Champion [38] Walter Hahn[39] World Heavyweight Champion [40] Ilya Rukober [41] Todd Smith[42] Inactive;
