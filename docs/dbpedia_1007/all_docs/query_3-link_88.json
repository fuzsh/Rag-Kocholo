        "text": "As a result of their easy availability in enantiomerically enriched form and their possession of synthetically transformable diverse functional groups, amino acids have been extensively used by synthetic organic and medicinal chemists as a chiral pool for access to heterocycles (monocycles, bicycles or polycycles, either bridged or fused). This review describes the syntheses of diverse asymmetric heterocycles with various membered rings (n = 3-9) followed by benzo or heteroannulated ones, for the period from 1996 to Dec. 2013. It details solution phase synthetic methodologies in which the naturally occurring Î±-amino acid is incorporated, totally or partially, into the final product.\n\nCatalyst-free reactions developed during the last decade and the latest developments in this emerging field are summarized with a focus on catalyst-free reactions in-water and on-water. Various named reactions, multi-component reactions and the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds are discussed including the use of various energy input systems such as microwave- and ultrasound irradiation, among others. Organic chemists and the practitioners of this art both in academia and industry hopefully will continue to design benign methodologies for organic synthesis in aqueous media under catalyst-free conditions by using alternative energy inputs based on fundamental principles.\n\nHighly functionalized fullerenes can be efficiently constructed by various techniques. However, the challenge is to synthesize highly symmetrical fullerenes. Recently, a number of X-ray structures have been disclosed showing the high symmetry of substituted fullerenes. By reviewing the major types of multi functionalized fullerenes through selected examples with a link to the structural assignments, the authors intend to give a concise overview to the specialist in the field and to provide the non-specialist with a tool box of possibilities."
