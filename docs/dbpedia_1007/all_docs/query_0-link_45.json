        "text": "Epilepsy patients can suffer different injuries, including skin burns. The causes are various, and depend on the type and frequency of the seizure, antiepileptic drug and comorbidities. This study demonstrates the efficacy of long-term MKDT for seizure control and QOL among both pediatrics and adults with medically intractable epilepsy. Not surprisingly, strict compliance appears to result in the most benefit. Tolerability of these diets may account for the sustained/long-term benefits. Further, objective research is needed to verify these outcomes.\n\nPurpose: To follow the clinical course of children and adolecents with absence syndromes, estimate the percentage of patients entering remis- sionwithmonotherapyorcombinationofantiepilepticdrugs(AEDs)and identifyprognosticfactorsofearlyremission. Method: The study population consisted of 65 children, 34 girls and 31 boys, 3–14 years old (mean 6.94 years) with Childhood Absence Epi- lepsy(CAE)orJuvenileAbsenceEpilepsy(JAE)syndrome.Allchildren received treatment with one or more AEDs. The patients were divided into three groups: 1) with remission (seizure-free for at least 1 year), 2) with relapse (recurrence of seizures after at least 1 year’s remission) and 3)withoutremission(neverseizure-free). Results: Patients included in the study were followed up for a mean of 2.75 years. Sixty children were diagnosed with CAE and five with JAE. Among the group of children with CAE, 86.7% (N = 52/60) achieved remission, (80.8% with monotherapy and 19.2% with a combination of AEDs), 8.3% (N = 5/...\n\nPurpose: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most abundant neurotrophin in the CNS, where it plays a crucial role in the development of immature neurons and the survival and plasticity of mature nerve cells. The Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) has been linked with anatomical and functional variation including an altered susceptibility to seizures. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of the Val66Met polymorphism in children diagnosed with rolandic epilepsy and control individuals of similar age. Method: Seventeen children with rolandic epilepsy, and 37 control children were genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, with an RFLP method, in this study. All participants were residents of northern Greece. Genotype and allele frequencies were statistically compared with the use of Fisher’s Exact test. Results: Carriers of the Met66 allele were overrepresented in rolandic epilepsy group (allele frequencies 29.4% compared to 18.9% among controls), but no statis..."
