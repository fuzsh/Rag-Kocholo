        "text": "What can I say? I have waited a long time for something like this to finally be great enough to implement on the Thirty Seconds To Mars stage.\n\nI've always struggled to choose between tonal quality and versatility versus convenience for touring. Unfortunately, I've always had to lug around enormous amounts of gear (multiple different amp heads, multiple iso-cabs, matrix loop switching, literally more than a dozen different pedals, etc...) to do what I needed live so that I could pull off several albums worth of material at the level of quality needed... Then along came the Profiler and changed my life forever!\n\nWith the Profiler, we can profile all of the amps we use live, I have all but two very custom effects available to me in the Profiler library of effects pedals (many of which sound way more rich and have better dimension than the \"real\" thing), and this all fits into a 3 space rack that I can check on a plane and never have to wonder again what I will be dealing with on a fly-gig.\n\nOne of the things people who love music don't think about is the cost of touring! Shipping thousands of pounds of gear all over the world is insanely expensive, and the Profiler just demolished that entire problem with one product. The Profiler has truly become that one piece of gear I simply cannot live without."
