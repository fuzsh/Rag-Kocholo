        "text": "Posted on: Thursday July 15, 2021\n\nATTENTION SPORTS/MOTORSPORTS – FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\n63-YEAR-OLD LOWELL BENNETT ENDS FOUR YEAR WIR DROUGHT – WINS SUPER LATE MODEL MAIN\n\n(KAUKAUNA, WI) July 15 – 63-year-old Lowell Bennett had to prove to the ‘kids’ he races against he’s still ‘got it’.\n\nThe Neenah racer passed Kyle Calmes for the lead on lap five and kept the lead to win the super late model feature at Wisconsin International Raceway in Kaukauna Thursday. The victory was Bennett’s first at the track since 2017.\n\nPolesitter Calmes took the lead at the drop of the green in the 35-lap contest while Bennett motored past Calmes to take the lead on lap five.\n\nA few laps later Andy Monday and Jesse Oudenhoven would slip into the second and third spots, respectively and began slowly closing the gap on the veteran racer. Point leader Grant Griesbach wrestled the third spot away from Oudenhoven on the 12th circuit.\n\nBennett kept the lead with Monday, Griesbach, Oudenhoven and Bobby Kendall in toe nose-to-tail with 10 laps remaining.\n\nA caution on lap 32 tightened the field when Sawyer Effertz and Brent Strelka tangled in turn three, setting up a three lap dash to the finish. Bennett fought off Monday and Griesbach to score a popular win. “I won four features in 2017 and haven’t won one since,” Bennett exclaimed in victory lane. “My pit crew has never given up on me and we’ve worked so hard to get this 2 car back to the front.”\n\nMonday settled for second, followed by Griesbach, Kendall and Oudenhoven.\n\nHometown driver Nate Van Wychen dodged a few caution periods and held on to win the late model feature. Trailing at the checkers were Todd Verhagen, Mike Meyerhofer, Brandon Reichenberger and Jesse Bernhagen.\n\nKaukauna’s Jerry Schneider and Dylan Wenzel of Fremont split the ¼ mile late model features while Appleton’s Andy Casavant scored fast time and won the super stock feature.\n\nHilbert’s Mike Byrge fought off heavy pressure from Marty Sokolik and fast timer Bobby Wautier late in the race to capture his first sport truck feature win of the season.\n\nLittle Chute’s Evan Beattie won the Sizzlin’ 4 feature while West Bend’s Nick Ostberg copped the Figure 8 feature.\n\nNext Thursday July 22 it’s Bricco Services night at the races. The V6 Rovals will also be in action. Racing gets underway at 6:30 p.m. You can check frrc.us for more information.\n\nSUPER LATE MODEL FEATURE – Lowell Bennett, Neenah; Andy Monday, Appleton; Grant Griesbach, Pewaukee; Bobby Kendall, Montello; Jesse Oudenhoven, Kaukauna; Braison Bennett, Neenah; Jeff Van Oudenhoven, Appleton; Maxwell Schultz, Reedsville; Taylor Vandermoss, Appleton; Kyle Calmes, Freedom; Brent Strelka, Freedom; Alex Stumpf, Woodville; Brady Baldry, Omro; Corey Manders, Hilbert; Nick Van, Greenville; Mike Anthony, Appleton; Sawyer Effertz, Darboy; Trevor Vandermolen, Oshkosh; Pete Vandermolen Jr, Oshkosh; Alex Seidl, Appleton; Mickey Schallie, Darboy; Randy Schuler, Mequon\n\nHEATS 1st) Schuler; Vandermoss 2nd) Effertz; Stumpf\n\nDASH – Oudenhoven\n\nFAST TIME – Schultz, 19.246\n\nLATE MODEL FEATURE – Nate Van Wychen, Kaukauna; Todd Verhagen, Freedom; Mike Meyerhofer, Hilbert; Brandon Reichenberger, Appleton; Jesse Bernhagen, Neilsville; Bryan Monday, Appleton; Brian Henry, Omro; Travis Rodewald, Manitowoc; Will Timmers, Kaukauna; Kevin Retzlaff, Berlin; Rachel Evans, Brillion; Matt Wittman, Appleton; Justin Woller, Appleton; Mike King, Appleton; Chase Randerson, Oshkosh; Tarra Springstroh, Freedom; Robert Younger, De Pere; Jason Vandeberg, Kimberly; Braison Bennett, Neenah\n\nHEAT – Evans\n\nDASH – Mike Meyerhofer\n\nFAST TIME – Bernhagen, 20.375\n\n¼ MILE LATE MODEL FEATURES 1) Jerry Schneider, Kaukauna; Rich Bickle, Edgerton; Wayne Posselt, Greenville; Rick Spoo, Neenah; Jeff Beschta, Appleton 2) Dylan Wenzel, Fremont; Tim Baumann, Neenah; Bickle; Kevin Hebbe, Appleton; Travis Willing, Appleton\n\nFAST TIME – Wenzel 14.770\n\nSUPER STOCK FEATURE – Andy Casavant, Appleton; George Schwalbach, Menasha; Jeff Treml, Greenleaf; Greg Hauser, Wrightstown; Trevor Howard, Kaukauna\n\nHEAT – Treml; Larry Raygo, Omro\n\nFAST TIME – Casavant, 15.731\n\nSIZZLIN’ 4 FEATURE – Evan Beattie, Little Chute; Mitchell Opsahl, Appleton; Scott Wolf, Appleton; Ricky Kaufert, Appleton; Emery Beattie, Little Chute\n\nHEATS 1) Tyler Lind, Appleton; Jacoby Pollei, Appleton 2) Gavin Klein, Greenville; Evan Beattie\n\nFAST TIME – Opsahl, 17.884\n\nSPORT TRUCK FEATURE – Mike Byrge, Hilbert; Marty Sokolik, Oakfield; Bobby Wautier, Denmark; Jason Van Handel, Freedom; Kylee Vandermoss, Darboy\n\nHEATS 1) Logan Mahoney, Oshkosh; Alex Ruedinger, Larsen 2) Vandermoss; Byrge\n\nFAST TIME – Wautier, 16.183\n\nFIGURE 8 – Nick Ostberg, West Bend"
