        "text": "We’ll get to this Oscar Levant song, but my story of finding this song goes waaay back…\n\nYou’re sitting on a tree stump in Borneo 3,000 miles from home. The world is at war, and as a 20-year-old in the Royal Australian Air Force, so are you. What better time to begin a lifelong love of music?\n\nThat’s where it all started for Frank Bristow, listening to American Forces Network radio programs in 1945 and escaping for a moment or two into the sounds of big bands a world away. Frank, now 94 and living in Brighton, Australia (near Melbourne) was part of the Borneo Campaign, one of the last big battles in the Pacific toward the end of the war.\n\nHis appreciation for that music expanded along with his extensive music collection over the many decades. Frank’s initial collecting days in the 1940s were helped along by his father who was a captain in the Australian Entertainment Unit of the Army. As Frank wrote me recently, his father “was, from time to time, able to get me records not generally available. Records were hard to come by in those days due to the shortage of shellac.”\n\nFrom those earliest days, his collection now takes the form of 532 carefully curated CDs of music that you might not find anywhere else. When I went in search of the Debroy Somers Band’s soundtrack to the 1932 Oscar Levant musical Out of the Bottle, I could find it nowhere else in the world but at Frank’s website! (You really should check out Frank’s website!)\n\nThough Frank was and is the mastermind and financier of it all, his efforts would not have taken on their present form without help from a few friends. Some of Frank’s international roster of allies in the field include:\n\nAlan Bunting (Scottish sound engineer)\n\nAndy Pope (American restorer)\n\nBill Park (American researcher)\n\nJim Drake (American writer and researcher)\n\nRay Kolle (Australian writer)\n\nIan Dodds\n\nIvan Hutchison (“Mr. Movies” on Channel 7)\n\nNeville Wragg\n\nBert Whelan\n\nand “Mr. Movies,” Bill Collins (Australian film critic and TV personality)\n\nIncidentally, in the pre-internet days, Frank only once sought out others interested in music collecting by running a single ad in the local Radio Times newspaper, asking for others who share his same devotion to preserving music.\n\nIn response to the Gershwin emphasis in my Gershwin 100 blog, Frank said, “Along the way, I came in contact with Gershwin aficionado Michael Feinstein (we both still keep in touch), and if one needed to be inspired by that outstanding musician [George Gershwin] and his brother [Ira], they naturally appear in many of my CD issues.”\n\nI do not have the opportunity to ask this of just anybody, but I had to ask Frank if he remembered hearing the news of George Gershwin’s death in 1937 when Frank was just 12 years old.\n\nFrank: “No, I was too young to recall news of George’s death. It sticks in mind from the movie Rhapsody in Blue. It partly drew Bert Whelan and me together in our crusade to preserve George’s music. The set of George Bassman & His Orchestra playing Gershwin is, to mine and Bert’s minds, terrific. But you have to be pretty bad to destroy the genius that was the Gershwins.”\n\nI asked Frank if he could single out a few of his all-time favorites, and he responded, “My two top favorite records are Mario “Harp” Lorenzi and Anton & The Paramount Theatre Orchestra. If you look at my site, you’ll find that I’ve also done a couple dozen of special discs featuring their music.” On the topic of Oscar Levant, Frank said that “Blame It On My Youth” as sung by Mabel Mercer was a personal favorite.\n\nFrom fighting Imperial Japan to amassing a truly remarkable treasury of musical history, Frank has shown how one dedicated person and his allies can achieve so much when they unite for a worthy cause.\n\nThanks, Frank, for keeping the music alive!\n\nBy the way, Frank’s website is being updated. The new email to contact him for ordering CDs has changed recently and is franbris01@gmail.com.\n\nThe Song “Everything But You”\n\nWhat makes this duet unique is that it is of that rare genre of song, the love/hate song. She is sweet on him, while he has soured on her. It is not your typical love song duet, and therefore it may have been doomed to obscurity. The lyrics by Clifford Grey are enjoyable, though they do always fit the accents of the melody every time.\n\nLevant’s music is fine, with colorful harmonies and syncopated moments in the melody, but I have to admit that it doesn’t have that spark of Oscar-riginality that I have come to expect in a Levant song.\n\nSorry if it’s a little cramped on the page (see PDF below). I prefer to keep songs to one page if at all possible.\n\nBelow is the live recording from the 1932 London musical Out of the Bottle, and it is sung by Jack Leopold and Frances Day with music by Debroy Somers and His Band. Note how Jack Leopold appears to misremember the lyrics compared to the official lyrics from the sheet music printed below (or were they rewrites?).\n\nDownload the PDF of the simplified sheet music to “Everything But You” here: Everything But You\n\nLyrics to “Everything But You” by Clifford Grey:\n\nVerse 1: (She) Can’t you be more easy to please.\n\n(He) You don’t seem so easy to freeze.\n\nWhy be so insistent?\n\n(She) Must we be so distant?\n\nDoes this mean you’ll never unbend?\n\nDon’t you fancy me for a friend?\n\nWhy must we be formal?\n\n(He) I’m perfectly normal.\n\nChorus 1: (He) Lots of things I like: flowers in spring,\n\ngardens by moonlight, birdies that sing.\n\nI like mountains, lakes, and music.\n\nI like everything but you.\n\nLots of things I want: freedom from care,\n\nsunshine to loaf in, money to spare.\n\nI want rest and sweet contentment.\n\nI want everything but you.\n\nI like shady walks, quiet peaceful shady walks,\n\nbut I like to walk without you.\n\nI like cozy talks, quiet cozy little talks,\n\nbut don’t want to talk about you.\n\nLots of things I need, take it from me.\n\nI need my breakfast, also my tea.\n\nI need sugar in my coffee.\n\nI need everything but you.\n\nVerse 2: (She) I must seem quite silly to you,\n\nliking you the way I do.\n\n(He) That doesn’t surprise me\n\nStill your method tries me.\n\n(She) I’m not always quite such a fool.\n\nMost partic’lar ‘me’ as a rule.\n\n(He) I’d care if it mattered.\n\n(She) You ought to be flattered.\n\nChorus 2: (She) Lots of things I hate: ping-pong and flies,\n\nsoup and goloshes*, bridges and black ties.\n\nI hate rules and regulations.\n\nI hate everything but you.\n\nLots of things I hate: fat men in spats,\n\nwireless programs and prunes and top hats.\n\nI hate string quartettes and spinach.\n\nI hate everything but you.\n\nI hate flutes and mice, listening to advice,\n\nand getting up on Monday.\n\nI hate catching trains and eating cold remains\n\nof things we had on Sunday.\n\nLots of things I hate: colds in the head,\n\nplus fours, and Shakespeare, crumbs in my bed.\n\nI hate fish and my relations.\n\nI hate everything but you.\n\n* Not sure if the lyric “soup and goloshes” means “soup and galoshes” or “soup and goulashes.” Frances Day’s recording below sounds like “galoshes.”"
