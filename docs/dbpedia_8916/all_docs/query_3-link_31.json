        "text": "What a lot of people do not know is that the 1964 6G6-B\n\nBassman with Utah Speakers was actually the most recorded amplifier\n\nused by The Beatles. The amp was first used by Paul McCartney as his\n\nmain bass amp from 1965 to mid 1967 (he did use a Vox during this time\n\nbut not as much as the Bassman). In 1966 and 1967 John Lennon and\n\nGeorge Harrison shared it (sometimes playing their guitars through the\n\namp at the same time) and from early 1967 George Harrison took it over\n\nas his main amp. This amp was then used on a few of the early John\n\nLennon solo albums when George was there and then George used it as\n\nhis main solo amp. It even became George‚Äôs main amp when they did\n\nAntholody and Real Love/Free As A Bird (you will see it in the\n\nrecording sessions). If you look at any Beatles documentary from 1967\n\nyou will always see it there (even in the Apple offices at times), it\n\nis all through the Lennon Imagine films and documentaries and also the\n\nHarrison documentaries and it was even on stage during the Concert for\n\nGeorge, as a tribute when George died. So, the 1964 Bassman is\n\nactually the ‚Äúreal‚Äù amp used by The Beatles in the latter years and\n\nmost creative years, rather than the iconic Vox which dominated their\n\nearly years. So, although the Utah speakers were not the best\n\nspeakers their sound dominated Beatle recordings from Rubber Soul\n\n(1965) to Abbey Road (1970) so that is not too bad üôÇ\n\n1961 Pro Reverb and 1963 Bandmaster.

For a decade, bassists had to make do with guitar (or accordion) amps ill-suited to reproducing low-frequency sounds. Even the early Fender bass amps, including the ‚Äô59 Bassman 4√ó10, had open-back enclosures that produced little more than a muddy approximation of the instrument‚Äôs true sound. Finally, in the early 1960s, engineers began to turn their attention to the problem of amplifying this ‚Äúnew‚Äù instrument. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the more memorable designs they came up with during that turbulent decade.\n\nFender Bassman\n\nAs the mid-‚Äô60s neared, a phenomenon called the ‚ÄúBritish Invasion‚Äù occurred. Suddenly, everybody was learning to play guitar, bass, or drums, and combos were forming in every town across the nation. While many of the English groups were using strange gear made by Vox, most music stores in the U.S. featured amps manufactured in California by Fender. At this time, Leo and company had some 15 years of amp-building experience under their belts, and they were building what proved to be perhaps the most durable‚Äîand desirable‚Äîamplifiers ever made. In 1964, if you were serious about your music, your amp of choice was a ‚Äúblackface‚Äù Fender Bassman (so called because of the black paint on its front panel).\n\nThis amp featured the relatively new (at the time) piggyback design, with separate amp head and speaker bottom, which provided flexibility as well as an illusion of size. (While some of the Fender piggyback amps had tilt-back legs and fasteners to attach the head, no self-respecting rock player of the era set his speaker bottom on its side!) The Bassman‚Äôs all-tube amplifier design included dual channels, one marked BASS and the other NORMAL‚Äîimplying, one assumes, that playing bass was somehow abnormal. Each channel had volume, treble, and bass controls, as well as individual voicing and preamp designs for optimum sound with bass or guitar/microphone. And, as the popularity of electric music continued to expand, the 50-watt power section and pair of heavy-duty 12‚Ä≥ speakers set the standard for bass. The tone was pretty good‚Äîall of a sudden, you could hear the bass guitar, without a lot of buzz or distortion. At the time, it was the ultimate in bass gear."
