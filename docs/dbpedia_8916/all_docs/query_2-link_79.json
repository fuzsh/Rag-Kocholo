        "text": "mouse from merced\n\nTrad climber\n\nThe finger of fate, my friends, is fickle.\n\nTopic Author's Original Post - Jan 15, 2016 - 11:23pm PT\n\nDateline: October 21, 2015\n\nWillie Nelson will be the first country music artist to receive the prestigious Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. The iconic songwriter and performer will be celebrated at an invitation-only gala on November 18th in Washington, D.C.\n\nAmong those paying tribute to the 82-year-old musician are Rosanne Cash, Jamey Johnson, Alison Krauss, Raul Malo of the Mavericks, Neil Young and Promise of the Real, the band featuring Nelson's son, Lukas. Also appearing will be Edie Brickell, Leon Bridges, Ana Gabriel, Paul Simon and Buckwheat Zydeco.\n\nTaking place at DAR Constitution Hall in the nation's capital, the tribute concert will air on PBS stations January 15th, 2016, at 9:00 p.m. ET and will be broadcast at a later date via the American Forces Network to U.S. Department of Defense locations around the world.\n\nThe Gershwin Prize was created in 2007, and named after brothers George and Ira Gershwin, whose contributions to popular American music include numerous standards such as \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" which Nelson recorded on his landmark 1978 LP, Stardust. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame earlier this year.\n\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of Nelson's first-ever recordings, as a 12-year-old in his hometown of Abbott, Texas.\n\nAccording to the official description on the Library of Congress website, the Gershwin Prize \"celebrates the work of an artist whose career reflects lifetime achievement in promoting song as a vehicle of musical expression and cultural understanding.\"\n\nSongwriter Paul Simon was the first recipient in 2007. Others who have been honored are Paul McCartney, Carole King, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The selection of the annual Gershwin Prize recipient is made by the Librarian of Congress in consultation with board members selected for their expertise in various fields related to music.\n\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/willie-nelson-honored-with-gershwin-prize-20151021\n\nFifty years ago: no braids or earrings and wearing a suit.\n\nWillie Nelson at the Opry - Mr. Record Man\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7dSKxKZlY\n\nTonight I lucked into being able to see this PBS Event. Mr. Nelson was attired in a tasteful black suit, long braids, earing, and a ratty ole smelly-ass guitar.\n\nHe was surrounded by his boy Micah and his other boy Lukas, who, if you close your eyes, sings just like his pa. And Lukas loves bangin' his nylon-string Spanish-style guitar, too, which he plays like his pa.\n\nGreat show and all the great music was Willie's.\n\nProps to the house band at this show."
