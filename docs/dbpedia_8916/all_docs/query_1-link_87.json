After attending the NC School of the Arts in his hometown of Winston-Salem, he moved to New York City. His musical career took off as he played in a number of avant-garde groups. When the chance arose to study with renowned jazz educator Jerry Coker, Kendrick returned south to Tennessee, where he honed his technique and performed with the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra. In 1981, Kendrick headed home to Winston-Salem and emerged as a leader in North Carolina’s jazz scene.\n\nCritics from around the country have applauded Kendrick’s CDs, which have appeared on national radio charts. His CDs—four on his own label, Suitcase Music—feature over forty original works.\n\nKendrick also scores music for films. His credits include The Dark Power, Weather or Not, and The Darien Gap, which won second place at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nDevoted to music education, Matt Kendrick was on the faculty at Wake Forest University for 25 years. He’s also the Musical Director of Carolina Music Ways, a non-profit group that performs in K-12 schools. Dedicated to giving back to his community, Kendrick is co-artistic director for Music Carolina an arts presenting non-profit."
