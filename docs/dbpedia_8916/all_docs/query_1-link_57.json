Ray's first memory of guitar was hearing his father Ray Snr play at home. Listening to his father strumming on his acoustic sparked something inside which would cause an obsession with the six stringed instrument for the rest of the young Ray Jnrs life!\n\n​Coming from a family of music lovers, it seemed inevitable that Ray would play music.\n\nBlues and Jazz were styles introduced to Ray by his uncles who taught him to learn guitar solos and chords by listening to records and finding the notes by ear.\n\nWebsite: www.raybeadleband.com\n\nRed SLIM\n\nRed Slim Power Trio brings to the stage a mind blowing performance that includes a range of music from original pieces to a special selection of Blues Classics, going from Freddie King, T-Bone Walker, Howlin’ Wolf, BB King, Albert King, Albert Collins, Buddy Guy all the way to Red’s main influence Jimi Hendrix.\n\nRed is known for playing slide blues wirelessly mid show using whatever he can grab (lighters, glasses, beer bottles, mobiles, shoes, spoons, chairs, etc…) The performance features the classic guitar tones & sounds from the late 60s.

Category: Local Blues Band & Best Monthly House Band\n\nThe Voice and Guitar of the Bondi Cigars, One of the country’s finest Blues Triple-threats’ (Singer/Guitarist/Songwriter)\n\nShane Pacey - Guitar and Vocals with Paul Blasi - Bass and Dave Fester – Drums.Although Shane’s other band, The Bondi Cigars is still very much a going concern, Shane recently felt the strong urge to revisit the music that turned him on when he first started playing. In a time when the Blues is in great danger of being swallowed by the all-encompassing term “roots music,” the very concept of a Blues band seems to be almost a quaint idea. The SHANE PACEY Trio…are that rare (and becoming rarer!) thing… A dedicated Blues band, rather than a solo star with supporting musicians. Shane states “The main aim is to create something totally different to The Cigars”, a no-nonsense trip through the Blues back pages, all played with Shane’s customary attack and passion.\n\n(CBS review November 2017) “The role of the SPT is for Pacey to indulge his instinct to revisit his roots, by way of the music that first inspired him to pick up a guitar and play, as well as sing, the blues. For him, it means Peter Green and the sounds of Chicago’s legendary Chess label, in particular. Happily, we get to go along for the ride. Of course, it takes more than company to make a trio: it takes a crowd and the pistol-like rhythm section of bassist Paul Blasi and drummer Dave Fester which ensures the tunes land right in the solar plexus……”\n\n“No one throws down the blues gauntlet more robustly than this trio, which, next to its own, make songs decades old live all over again….”\n\nWebsite: http://www.shanepaceytrio.com.au/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063561131312\n\nSimon Kinny-Lewis Band\n\nAustralian blues artist SIMON KINNY-LEWIS has performed and recorded with the cream of the Blues crop including Robben Ford, Chris Cain, Josh Smith, Kirk Fletcher and many others.
