        "text": "I love knowing the stories of ones\n\nAint no other man is about Christina's husband\n\nFighter is about her relationship with her father which wasn't a great relationship at all\n\nHometown glory is about when Adele was gonna go to college and wrote a song about how much she would miss her hometown while she was gone.\n\nWaking up in vegas is when Katy perry married her best friend in vegas but it was never a legal marriage. Or she was close to marrying him.\n\nI have heard that Toxic by Britney is about Justin Timberlake.\n\nOverprotected is easily about Britney coming out of her shell and being a woman. Not having anyone look after her. This song was apart of her third album which saw her change genre's and become more sexier then the original girl next door image she had.\n\nPiece of me is of course about her relationship with the paps.\n\nDead and Gone is about a friend of TI's who died in a car accident or something related to a car.\n\nI was thinking about songs and the inspitration behind them.\n\nA few examples:\n\n'Wonderwall' is said to be about Noel Gallgher's ex, Meg Matthews.\n\n'You've Got a Friend' was written by James Taylor about Carole King (or so I believe)\n\n'Beetlebum' is said to be about Damon Albarn's ex, Justine Frischmann, but was sometimes wrongly rumoured to be a stab at Liam Gallagher.\n\nAnyone know of any other interesting ones?"
