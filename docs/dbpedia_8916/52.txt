GETTIN' SENTIMENTAL OVER YOU George Bassman & Ned Washington arranged by Eric Richards The USAF Airmen of Note Rick Lillard, trombone I wrote this arrangement in the summer of 1983 while sitting on the aft deck of the S.S. Norway enjoying the view of St. Thomas, using a little Casio keyboard to check voicings! Playing on the S.S. Norway Orchestra that summer kept my ears immersed in a lot of Latin-flavoured music and I wrote this to feature the ship's Bandleader, Chip Hoehler. One of my arranging heroes was the late, great Rob McConnell and this arrangement clearly pays homage to his work. I was so grateful to learn that the USAF Airmen of Note included it on one of their recordings back in the 90's and featured another one of my "heroes", the amazing Rick Lillard on trombone.
