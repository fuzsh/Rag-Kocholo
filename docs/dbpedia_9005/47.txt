What to expect:

Come write with us! The JSU Writers Camp (Young Adult Writing Program) is dedicated to fostering craft for writers interested in developing their skills in the genres of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and will offer workshops, craft lectures, and readings by published writers and teachers of creative writing.

Activities will include:

Exercises so that students can generate new creative work

Techniques for developing critiques of classmatesâ€™ work

A friendly space for students to share their writing

Feedback on writing from instructors and strategies for revision

Knowledge about publishing works in print and online journals

Student readings

Outdoor writing activities

So many of us want to be writers; at YAWP, students will learn to own the fact that by virtue of being a person who writes, they are in fact writers--and celebrate that!
