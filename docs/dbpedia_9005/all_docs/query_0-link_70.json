English majors may concentrate in creative writing; other majors may pursue a minor in creative writing. Classes open to undergraduates throughout the university are Creative Writing, Narrative Writing and Poetry Writing, and Advanced Narrative Writing & Advanced Poetry Writing.\n\nThe program also offers an MFA degree. MFA graduate students organize the First-Year MFA Reading Series, and graduating MFA students hold a reading of their works in the spring.\n\nFor more information, contact: creativewriting@cornell.edu.\n\nThe award-winning national literary journal EPOCH is published by the Department of Literatures in English and the Creative Writing Program. EPOCH publishes fiction, poetry, essays, comics, and graphic art. In continuous publication since 1947, the magazine is edited by students and faculty of the MFA Program.\n\nSubmission guidelines, advertising rates, an archive of past issues, and featured poetry and prose from the most recent issue are available at the magazine’s full site, www.epochliterary.com. The past ten years of EPOCH are also available to buy as individual issues in the EPOCH shop, along with subscriptions."
