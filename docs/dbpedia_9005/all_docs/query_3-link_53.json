        "text": "Students from kindergarten through high school explore the National Historic Landmark and create original works at full day art camps and half and full day writing camps\n\nThis summer, Meadow Brook Hall will open its doors and grounds once more to creative students of all ages for the popular annual Meadow Brook Art Camp and Meadow Brook Writing Camp (MBWC). Participants will discover secret staircases and amazing playhouses while being challenged and inspired at the two special summer camps at the National Historic Landmark, located on the campus of Oakland University.\n\nRegistration is now open for both camps!\n\n“As a historic cultural center in metro Detroit, Meadow Brook Hall is the perfect setting for creative and educational programs. Our hope is that our Arts Camp and Writing Camp will encourage young students to build a lifelong love of reading, writing and the arts—all while experiencing the beauty of this local treasure,” said Shannon O’Berski, external relations director of Meadow Brook Hall.\n\nThe Meadow Brook Arts Camp invites students aged 5-11 to explore the Great Estate while learning about the incredible decorative arts that fill the 110-room mansion. Each day, students will create their own art projects inspired by Meadow Brook’s unique collection of stained glass, photography, textiles, sculpture and more.\n\nThe camps feature fun outdoor activities, games and even a special chance for parents to see their children’s works displayed in a gallery walk and tour on the last day.\n\nThe Meadow Brook Art Camps are available in two weeklong, full day sessions for $400 each. All camps are limited to 15 students per section. Two age groups (5-7 & 8-11) will be running simultaneously.\n\nFor more information or to register, visit meadowbrookhall.org/artcamps.\n\nThe Meadow Brook Writing Camp offers in-person weeklong camps designed to help students from kindergarten through high school develop as writers.\n\nEvery day, participants will tour the historic house museum and world-class gardens to nurture, polish and ultimately publish their original written works. Young authors will interact with award-winning, specially-trained experts in the field of writing. Collaborative teaching teams consist of K-12 writing teachers and Oakland University faculty from the Department of Writing and Rhetoric.\n\nSeveral weeklong sessions are available for the Meadow Brook Writing Camps. Half day camps are $325 and full day camps are $450. For more information or to register, visit meadowbrookhall.org/writingcamps."
