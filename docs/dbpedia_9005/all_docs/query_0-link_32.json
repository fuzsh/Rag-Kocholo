Create a first line that makes an impact! And enter the Dialogue Dimension to get your characters talking.\n\nWORLD BUILDING FOR THE REAL WORLD: STRATEGIES FOR FICTIONALIZING THE WORLD WE LIVE IN with BILL CAMERON\n\nWorld building isn’t only for science-fiction and fantasy. It’s just as important for fiction set in our everyday world, whether in the present or past.\n\nPAPER JAM\n\nIn this hands-on session, you’ll discover the wonder of making your own paper from scratch. You’ll also make cards from handmade paper and learn the easy way to write a thank you note, mad libs style. Prepare to tear it up.\n\nEMBODYING YOUR STORY with JEANY VAN MELTEBEKE SNIDER\n\nDelve into improvisation to learn how to add physical expression to your written story, create active characters, and drop into your natural voice.\n\nCOMIC-IZE YOUR STORY with JEN HERNANDEZ\n\nIn this workshop, you’ll turn your story ideas into comics! We’ll practice how to pick ideas to comic-ize, share drawing tips and then we’ll create one-page comics or comic strips using artist drawing tools. Bring your story notes, OCs, and inspirational graphic novels to this end of the week comic extravaganza!\n\nOn the last day, we host a reading of student work and invite family and friends to come hear the tall tales and wild adventures campers have composed this week. This last day will run a little longer and the readings will be from 4-5 PM. More details will be provided closer to the start of the camp."
