        "text": "You are eligible to apply if you are currently a student between the ages of 12-18 years old and students who have just graduated high school before the program begins.\n\nParticipants will be a diverse group, representing a wide range of academic and personal interests. You should register for the Morehouse Summer Writing Camp if you want to improve your writing.\n\nNote: the registration form will be available March 1, 2024.\n\nYou will need to complete an online registration form. To complete the online registration, please visit this link and submit the registration form here:\n\nRegistration forms are due May20, 2024.\n\nWe accept students who want to improve their writing. We will accept a diverse group of students with a wide range of academic and personal interests.\n\nAcceptance decisions will be announced via email.\n\nTo keep class sizes small, we are not able to admit all applicants. If you are not accepted to the 2024 Summer Online Writing Camp, we encourage you to apply next year if interested.\n\nGroups of 12-14 students meet online with an instructor in synchronous sessions for three hours each day. Class time is spent freewriting, responding to writing prompts and assignments, discussing assigned readings, and sharing and discussing one another’s work.\n\nEveryone in the Camp, including instructors, writes and shares work every day. Instructors emphasize techniques for responding to work in ways that will help students recognize their strengths, potential, and avenues for productive revision.\n\nIn addition to daily sessions, students will meet individually with their instructor for a one-on-one conference during the week.\n\nOur instructors are teachers who have a long association with Morehouse College’s Writing Center and Writing Program. They all have advanced degrees and teach high school and/or college during the academic year. Because many of our instructors have been teaching for several years, they are a strong team with a deep understanding of the curriculum and philosophy of our Summer Writing Camp."
