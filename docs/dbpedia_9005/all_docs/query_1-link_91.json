        "text": "Our open-air writing studios provide a welcoming environment for young storytellers to write poetry, short fiction, and plays, individually and in small collaborative groups. Use your imagination and find your creative voice, while learning concrete elements of storytelling such as structure, point of view, and conflict and resolution.\n\nCreative Writing students collaborate with peers from other artistic disciplines and use the natural environment to inspire their writing. Writers also explore the forms in which creative writing shows up in everyday life (such as journaling) and in a variety of careers (such as writing commercials and plays).\n\nUnder the instruction of an experienced writing educator and practicing writer, students spend their days considering structure and form through word games, writing, revising, sharing, and collaborating. The session culminates in a student open mic and performance as well as the development of individual student portfolios. All levels are welcome. Classes are grouped according to age division and grade.\n\n“It encouraged me to be more creative than I thought I could be.”\n\n—Rina"
