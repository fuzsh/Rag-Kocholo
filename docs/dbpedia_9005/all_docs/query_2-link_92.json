        "text": "(coed, entering grades 2-8 in Fall 2024)\n\nGeneral Information\n\nYoung Authors Day Camp provides aspiring writers an opportunity to hone their craft alongside peers who share a similar love for words. Campers will be exposed to a wide variety of genres as they learn about the craft of writing through mini-lessons and shared writing opportunities. Through those experiences, campers will come away with the start of multiple ideas, as well as writing strategies, that they can explore on their path as writers. At the end of each week, campers will choose a piece to share with their peers during Authors Share and submit to a camp anthology that is published at the end of each summer.\n\nIn addition to writing, campers will have the opportunity to explore Cranbrook’s campus, as they find inspiration amongst the many gardens, natural features, and sculptures to be found. Word games and outdoor activities will break up the day as we maintain a camp structure. Highlights of camp include time spent searching for frogs at the pond, exploring magic found within a weeping willow, and creating friendships along Snake Rock.\n\nImportant Note: Young Authors Day Camp is not a summer school or a remedial or English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) program. This camp is writing-intensive and encourages and inspires young writers to try new techniques while encouraging creativity and having fun.\n\nA Day in the Life\n\nEach day begins with a whole group writing prompt to get the creative minds flowing. In age-based groups, campers focus on developing their craft through daily mini-lessons that guide them through language study, story organization, and character development. Daily lunch and recess allow for refueling and brain breaks. Campers go on writing adventures to explore and get inspired by Cranbrook’s beautiful campus. Some of our favorite spots are Magic Tree, Japanese Gardens, The Kingswood Courtyard, Crying Zeus, Snake Rock, and Triton Pools. Games, recreation, and swimming at the Natatorium help bring balance and create a fun and nurturing environment for our aspiring young authors.\n\nBasic Daily Schedule\n\nDrop-Off, welcomes, daily writing prompt\n\nIntroductions, rules & expectations, snack time, ROCKSTAR\n\nSwim, if scheduled\n\nLesson 1: First writing lesson/themed writing prompt\n\nBathroom and wash hands\n\nLunch\n\nRecess\n\nBathroom break\n\nWriting Adventure & Lesson 2\n\nBathroom break\n\nLesson 3: Last writing lesson/themed writing prompt\n\nNominate ROCKSTAR of the day\n\nDismissal\n\nLunch, Snacks, and Allergies\n\nLunches and snacks are included in tuition and are provided by Chartwells Dining Services. They are a nut-free organization that caters to Cranbrook Schools during the academic year. Special arrangements can be made for campers with food allergies. Lunches are served in the Cranbrook Kingswood Middle School for Girls – Kingswood Dining Hall.\n\nOpen Swim\n\nCampers swim at Cranbrook's Williams Natatorium. Swim tests are conducted on the first day. Campers who fail or prefer not to take the test are supplied with life jackets and remain in the shallow end of the pool. Campers are allowed to retake the test at any time. The Natatorium staff includes a full-time and certified pool manager, certified lifeguards, and our trained camp staff who serve as lookouts.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nAt a minimum, Cranbrook’s COVID-related protocols will comply with applicable State of Michigan mandates and align with Oakland Country Health Division and the American Camp Association.\n\nAvailable Options\n\nThe following options can be combined to meet your needs. For example, you can choose morning Transportation Service and afternoon Extended Care. Logistical information for these additional options are provided in the Parent Welcome Packet emailed to registrants closer to the start of camp.\n\nExtended Care\n\nExtended Care is available beginning at 7 AM and ending at 6 PM. Afternoon care includes a snack. Campers enjoy activities, games, and open time outside and in the gym. Extended Care is located at Cranbrook Lower School Brookside. Campers are bused to/from camp each day. Extended Care is also a nice option for families with multiple children attending more than one of our camps to reduce the number of pick-up points; parents/guardians simply pick up and drop off all children attending Extended Care at Brookside.\n\nTransportation Service\n\nTransportation Service is available to shuttle campers to and from specific stops in Birmingham (8:10 AM / 4:00 PM), Rochester Hills (7:50 AM / 4:25 PM), Royal Oak (7:50 AM / 4:15 PM), and Troy (8:20 AM / 4:00 PM). Times and locations are subject to change. Campers who are not picked up in time will be transported to Extended Care.\n\nAfter Camp Activities\n\nAfter Camp Activities include Chess and Coding. Space is limited. These activities are located at Cranbrook Lower School Brookside. Campers are bused from camp each day. Pick-up is at Brookside.\n\nCommunication & Photos\n\nParents/guardians are emailed a newsletter each week that includes a recap from the prior week, highlights for the following week, and updated group lists. Daily camp photos are posted on a secure website for you to see each day. Enhanced options include saving favorite photos, facial recognition with push notifications when a photo of your child is uploaded, posting to social media, emailing a photo to family, customizing photo gifts, and ordering high-resolution digital downloads or prints.\n\nWhy Cranbrook Schools Summer Camps?\n\nCranbrook Educational Community, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, is one of the world’s leading centers of education, science, and art. Comprising a graduate Academy of Art, contemporary Art Museum, House and Gardens, Institute of Science, and PreK-12 independent college preparatory Schools, Cranbrook welcomes thousands of visitors, students, and campers to its campus each year.\n\nFounded by Detroit philanthropists George and Ellen Booth in 1904, Cranbrook’s 319-acre campus features the work of world-renowned architects such as Eliel Saarinen, Albert Kahn, Steven Holl, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Rafael Moneo, Peter Rose and sculptors Carl Milles, Marshall Fredericks and others. Critics have called Cranbrook \"the most enchanted and enchanting setting in America\" and in 1989, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nCranbrook Schools Summer Camps operate under Cranbrook Schools in a dedicated department named Special and Summer Programs. This year-round department focuses solely on summer camps, after-school programs, school rentals, and the school store. The dedicated full-time staff in the department spend the entire year preparing for camp. During the summer, over 1,800 campers from 20 states and nine countries come to Cranbrook for their summer experience. The campus, its facilities, the highly skilled and committed service departments such as Cranbrook's 24/7 security department, and all of Cranbrook's employees, residential faculty, and guests create a wonderful environment for children to learn and have fun.\n\nEach camp includes a dedicated Director, Assistant Director, Office Administrator, Instructors, and Counselors. Each age-aligned group has one or two counselors who remain with their campers throughout the day and take them to each of the instructional areas. The camps are accredited by the American Camp Association and licensed through the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.\n\n2024 Tuition and Fees\n\nTuition\n\nFull Session (8 weeks): $2,960\n\nHalf Session (4 weeks): $1,610\n\nPartial Session (1 week): $445\n\nFees\n\nCancellation Fee: $50 fee per canceled week if a cancellation request is received in writing prior to 21 days of session start date.
