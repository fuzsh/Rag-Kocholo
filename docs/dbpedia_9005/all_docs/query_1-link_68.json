Each faculty member conducts a workshop in fiction, poetry, or nonfiction that meets for five two-hour sessions over the course of the 10 days.\n\nGroups are limited to ten writers to facilitate discussion.\n\nParticipants meet individually with their faculty mentors.\n\nFaculty offer lectures on literary writing and classes on specific aspects of craft.\n\nYou can attend daily readings by the faculty, participants, and guests.\n\nAll participants meet with visiting editors, literary agents, and/or publishers.\n\nThe 2024 Session\n\nThis year’s conference will take place from Wednesday, August 14 to Saturday, August 24. Find out more about dates and fees.\n\nIn addition to their literary accomplishments, writers on faculty have been specifically chosen for their skill at guiding developing writers. Find out more about faculty and guests.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nThanks to the generous support of Middlebury College and to an endowment fund established by past Bread Loafers and other donors, financial aid is available for both published and unpublished writers. Financial need has no bearing on decisions, except as noted. See Financial Aid Information.\n\nApply"
