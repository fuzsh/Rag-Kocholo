        "text": "Are you an aspiring novelist in need of some camaraderie and connection as you face down your manuscript? Lighten up those difficult writing days through this support and productivity group that takes its inspiration from summer camp.\n\nFor four weeks, attend a mix of fun, in-person activities and virtual sessions, all designed with novelists in mind.\n\nOn Wednesday evenings from 7-8:30pm, join the group virtually via Zoom. Each Wednesday session will feature mini craft lessons, writing time, and discussion with fellow writers.\n\nOn Saturdays, attend excursions to find inspiration in works of art, uncover history in a cemetery, embark on a late-night bookstore scavenger hunt, and more, all while connecting with other writers and picking up craft and publishing tips.\n\nIn-person and online events are supplemented by an online Slack group where writers can interact and share work (optional).\n\nParticipants may choose to attend as many or as few events they wish. Novelists working in all genres and at all levels are welcome; this program aims to provide support and a productivity boost rather than critiques or traditional workshops, though writers will have the chance to connect in genre-based groups.\n\nâ\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nSat. June 1 1-3pm- Opening Mixer and Show & Tell: Meet your fellow novelists while crafting a vision board for your novel in the Literary Cleveland headquarters.\n\nWed. June 5 7-8:30pm - Online writing group\n\nSat. June 8 3-5pm - Riverside Cemetery Ramble and Ghost Stories: Weâll gather among the graves to learn about history, research, and names.\n\nWed. June 12 7-8:30pm - Online writing group\n\nSat. June 15 1-3pm - Â Arts & (Writing) Crafts at Cleveland Museum of Art: Weâll hunt down some novel inspiration in the artwork at the Cleveland Museum of Art, to be followed by a writing exercise.\n\nWed. June 19 7-8:30pm - Online writing group\n\nSat. June 22 9-11pm - Late-Night Bookstore Scavenger Hunt at Loganberry: Enjoy a special after-hours trip to Loganberry Books, where a literary flashlight scavenger hunt awaits.\n\nWed. June 26 7-8:30pm - Online writing group\n\nSat. June 29 1-3pm - Goal Setting and Farewell Toast: Weâll wind down, prepare to say goodbye, and toast to a summer well spent at Bookhouse Brewing.â\n\nâ"
