        "text": "Home\n\n>\n\nAcademics\n\n>\n\nBeyond the Classroom\n\n>\n\nYoung Writers Workshop\n\n>\n\nYoung Writers Workshop\n\nYoung Writers Workshop\n\nJuly 7 – July 27, 2024\n\nThe Young Writers Workshop is a three-week creative writing program for students currently completing grades 9, 10 and 11.\n\nRolling admissions begin in January.\n\nAbout the Workshop\n\nIn the summer of 1983 Simon’s Rock began offering a three-week writing workshop for high school students modeled after the innovative three-week Workshop in Language and Thinking required of all entering students at Bard College. Since then the workshop has evolved and is part of the National Writing and Thinking Network.\n\nEach year 84 academically motivated students are chosen to participate in the workshop at Simon’s Rock. Former participants have gone on to such colleges as Amherst, Bard, Harvard, Haverford, Kenyon, Princeton, Simon’s Rock, Smith, Williams and Yale.\n\nUnlike more traditional workshops in creative writing, the Young Writers Workshop focuses on using informal, playful, and expressive writing as a way to strengthen skills of language and thinking. Out of these informal writing activities, using techniques of peer response, students develop more polished pieces, ranging from personal narratives to short stories, poems, brief dramatic works, and experiments in creative nonfiction.\n\nThe workshop sections are small (around 12 students). This size allows for individual attention to each student and helps to foster the sense of belonging to a supportive learning community in which students can feel comfortable exploring new directions in their writing and thinking. Trusting one’s own language and voice, learning to think for oneself and in collaboration with others — these are the qualities and skills that the workshop strives to develop.\n\nEach weekday usually consists of three 90-minute sessions organized as writing and discussion seminars. Workshop leaders write with their students, and there is frequent sharing of this informal writing, both in small groups and in the class as a whole.\n\nIn the workshop, we read a wide range of texts, many of which are challenging, to examine form, content, and evolving ideas in our evolving world. All of our texts are chosen to be useful in engaging a range of sophisticated conversations around thinking and writing. Discussions of assigned readings — mostly contemporary poems, stories, and essays — is informal and speculative. The emphasis isn’t on arriving at a “correct answer” but on exploring various ideas about what a text is saying. The texts also frequently serve as starting points and models for students’ own creative writing exercises. These daily activities are complemented by evening assignments in reading, revising and journal writing.\n\nEach week students develop a portfolio of “works in progress” and then meet individually with their workshop leader to discuss what they have written. Rather than evaluation, these meetings focus on what the writer is trying to do in his or her writing and how best to accomplish these goals. By becoming more conscious of their choices and strategies, students develop the intellectual autonomy expected of them as they prepare for college.\n\nYoung Writers Workshop College Scholarship\n\nStudents who successfully complete the Young Writers Workshop and subsequently enroll at the College are automatically eligible to apply for the Young Writers Workshop Scholarship.
