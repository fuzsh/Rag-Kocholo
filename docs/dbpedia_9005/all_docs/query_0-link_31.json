        "text": "UCLA Writing Project\n\n2024 Summer Camps for Students\n\nWe at the UCLA Writing Project are excited to announce our 2024 summer programs for students entering grades 5-12 in fall 2024. This year we are pleased to offer two sessions for you to choose from, the first on campus, the second virtual.\n\nOur promise: We’ll continue to give students exquisite attention, and they’ll experience pleasure and joy as they find the best words to capture their thoughts.\n\nJust what will happen during the workshop activities for students enrolled in Crafting The Story – Grades 5-6, Literary Adventures – Grades 7-8, and College-Ready Writing – Grades 9-12? Simply put, students will grow dramatically as writers. They’ll expand their stylistic repertoires, focus on a particular genre—but try out several others. They’ll draft short and long pieces and gain confidence as they develop their individual style. By the end of the workshop time, students will think of themselves as writers—a big deal!\n\nAnd what about the entering twelfth graders in the College Personal Essay workshop? They meet for just 12 hours over a four-day period. And that’s the perfect amount of time for zeroing in on the challenging and exciting task at hand: showing in what ways their hard work has translated to insightful understandings and how their experiences have built character.\n\nWhat else should you know?\n\nOur teachers are all UCLA Writing Project fellows. This means that they participated in our Invitational Writing Project, a leadership institute that gathers wonderful teachers of writing PK-University—to share their expertise through demonstration workshops, to refine their own writer’s craft, to pay good attention to social justice issues in schools and communities. They are teachers who love to write and to guide young students to grow as thinkers, readers and writers.\n\nMore still:\n\nAll classes will offer students appreciation, support, structure—and fun!\n\nThe day will combine whole group class time, small group sharing with peers, individual writing time.\n\nThose classes scheduled to be virtual will have synchronous and asynchronous components.\n\nAll students will also have time to interact with their teacher one-on-one.\n\nStudents in the two-week workshops will craft an anthology of selected writing. They will also receive a certificate commending their participation.\n\nWe hope to see you this summer!"
