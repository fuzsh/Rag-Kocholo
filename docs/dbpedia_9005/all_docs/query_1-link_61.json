        "text": "Our agency runs the Big Sur Children's Writing Workshop every winter with occasional offshoot conference locations. Since 1997, we have brought in outstanding editors from the top publishing houses, both large and small, and successful authors to make up our experienced and giving faculty. We pride ourselves on an excellent faculty-to-attendee ratio and a weekend with ample opportunities for faculty/attendee interactions, both formal and informal. This workshop has been the source of many successful author/agent relationships and many publishing deals, including one for more than half a million dollars.\n\nThese workshops are designed for writers whose works are nearly ready for publication. Therefore, to be accepted for a workshop, we require advance submission of a sample of your writing. Hands-on editorial work is the focus of these workshops, and there are breakout sessions on various important aspects of the publishing industry. Faculty and attendees take all meals together and socialize in an intimate and inspirational setting. Important alliances have come out of these workshopsâ€”many successful publishing deals, lasting writer/agent relationships, ongoing critique groups, and industry friendships and connections.\n\nThe Big Sur Children's Writing Workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers. Click here for our full anti-harassment policy."
