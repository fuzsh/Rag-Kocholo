        "text": "Our Process\n\nTOPS employs instructors to provide instruction in the visual and performing arts. Classes are led by exceptional teachers who are chosen for their ability to communicate with children, as well as their artistic abilities.\n\nCampus tours to galleries and other departments, as well as visiting artists in the classroom, are often used to augment class instruction. Above and beyond the arts, teachers are also required to incorporate both literacy exercises and character building skills, such as cooperation, negotiation and compromise, assertiveness, and stress management into their classes. Furthermore, our curriculum includes the history and vocabulary of each art form taught, as well as its application and/or performance.\n\nFor many of our campers, when they create a work of art or complete a musical, or dance performance, it is the first time in their lives they have accomplished something positive and beautiful. Seeing their work on exhibit or hearing applause while on stage, they realize they are successful, and valuable individuals.\n\nProgram Portfolio\n\nAlthough we focus a large portion of our camp on a music program, we also provide our campers with a myriad of activities to explore other creative avenues.\n\nOur summer program includes:\n\nPiano\n\nCreative Writing\n\nWorld Drumming\n\nArt\n\nExploring FAU Observatory\n\nExploring the FAU Library\n\nPool Activities\n\nMusic Games\n\nTalent Show\n\n*Master Classes by FAU Faculty and other guest performers\n\n*Special Guest Speakers\n\n*Performances at various FAU locations\n\nOther Campus Tours\n\nAnd so on...*varies each summer! The camp will conclude with a recital which all students will be able to participate in. All family and friends are invited and a reception will follow the performance. Dress is formal concert attire: no sneakers, jeans, or open-toe sandals, or short skirts for girls.\n\nPiano Program\n\nOur piano program provides beginners, intermediate and even advanced players with:\n\nInstruction that is comprehensive and focused\n\nAssistance with developing the camper as an overall musician and building good technique\n\nInstruction in music theory and piano literature\n\nObserving and participating in the Piano Institute masterclasses\n\nDaily practice time\n\n*Two private lessons per week in which the camper and teacher will select pieces that will be presented at the TOPS final recital on Friday. Teachers focus on pieces that are part of the classical repertoire for soloists, avoiding pop tunes, rock tunes, and/or reductions of orchestral pieces for piano.\n\nTwo elective classes each day - selecting from Composition/Arranging, World Music, Organ or Duo Piano\n\n*If your child has a piece that he/she has been working on lately, and would like this to be polished for performance, please bring this piece to camp.\n\nCreative Writing Program\n\nOur creative writing program provides campers with:\n\na 45-minute creative writing workshop\n\nEncourage campers to give voice to their imaginations through a variety of literary forms and techniques\n\nTactile observation and group dynamics to actively engage students in the creative experience of writing\n\nAll camp sessions take place on the Boca Raton campus of Florida Atlantic University from 9 am until 4 pm.\n\nCamper drop-off, pick-up and daily classes are located in the Arts and Humanities building (next to the University Theatre).\n\nDaily activities include private and group lessons, technique classes, creative writing, master classes, supervised practice, presentations and performance, entertainment and recreation, and tours of the FAU Boca Raton campus.\n\nCampers should bring two snacks and drinks and lunch each day to camp, or they may purchase snacks and drinks for $1 per item (lunch is not for sale).\n\nOn Fridays, we will provide a pizza lunch with drinks and cookies for the price of $6 - please bring this amount the first day of each camp session.\n\nSample Schedule\n\nPlease note that afternoon activities change every summer and activities vary by age group."
