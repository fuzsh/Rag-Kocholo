        "text": "Our programs are great for any writer at any level! We maintain a stress-free environment where students can feel supported and successful. We welcome every writer - from those who need extra support to those who are accomplished authors. We offer a variety of classes, camps, and workshops so that students can work on what interests them.\n\nWriting is an art as well as a skill. We recognize that writing can be intimidating for students who lack confidence with the \"art\" part or who struggle with the \"skill\" part. We make an effort to meet each writer at their current level and take small steps to grow from that point. Small class sizes ensure that each student receives plenty of individual attention as well as support, guidance, and feedback along the way. Most parents report great growth in their students' willingness to write, confidence, quality of content, and skill in mechanics.\n\nClick on the tabs at the top of the page to learn more about our programs.\n\nMiss Casey is a graduate of Elon University and has been teaching for 23 years. She taught public school in Alamance County and Wake County before moving on to homeschool her own two children. During her years as a homeschooling mom, she began tutoring and running writing groups at her kitchen table on Sunday afternoons. In 2013, she decided to move her groups into a classroom and give her little community of authors a name - Young Writers' Institute. Since then, she has had the privilege of working with hundreds of amazing young authors who come together to learn, grow, and express themselves confidently through the written word.\n\nJenn is a native New Yorker with a BA in Communication from SUNY Geneseo, a Master of Arts in Teaching English from Ithaca College, and Academically/Intellectually Gifted licensure from Western Carolina. Jenn taught in public schools for over 13 years as an ELA and AIG teacher. Over the course of her career, she became a National Board Certified teacher and was a STEMworks Scholar at NC State. Jenn now works with homeschooled students, teaching a wide range of subjects. Her true passion is connecting with children through literature and guiding students through the writing process.\n\nMiss Dawn has a MS in Education and holds a NC teaching license. She has been a Certified IEW Instructor since 2014. She has been working with children of all ages for over twenty-five years, both in the public schools and in private facilities. She has been with YWI since 2016, tutoring students in reading and writing, as well as teaching IEW classes. She loves working with students and helping them to achieve their writing and educational goals.\n\nMs. Goldberg is the daughter of poet and artist Hilary Tham and was raised with a passionate belief that writing is an invaluable tool for self-exploration, creative expression, and interpersonal communication.\n\nMs. Goldberg holds a BS in Psychology and a Masterâ€™s in Leadership in Teaching. She holds NC teaching certification in English and Special Education and has over 15 years of teaching experience. She has taught English and Literacy Support at Cary High School for 8 years and works with members of the senior class on college applications and graduation speeches.\n\nMs. Goldberg loves the challenge of building confidence and perseverance in young writers.\n\nMiss Lexi has such a passion for writing and being creative! She graduated from NC State University and she has always loved working with children in education and teaching them how to write and use their creativity and put it on paper. She enjoys poetry, action and adventure, and even history. She has two dogs and a cat that she loves hanging out with, she is an avid soccer player, and she really loves ice cream! Miss Lexi is so excited to meet all of her students this summer!"
