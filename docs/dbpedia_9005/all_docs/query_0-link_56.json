        "text": "The cost of camp is $150/person, which includes a t-shirt, notebook, and snacks provided each day of camp. A reduced-cost tuition option is available on the registration form. Non-refundable payment is required to hold your spot. Registrations will be available until one week before the start of each camp or until full, whichever is sooner. Each camp is capped at 20-25 students, depending on the camp. Register by the deadline to receive a camp t-shirt!\n\nOur teachers are Lake Michigan Writing Project Teacher-Consultants who have been identified as outstanding teachers of writing and nurturing role models for our campers. Teachers plan writing activities that build confidence while providing the writing tools that inspire creative thinking and the authorâ€™s craft. Campers write a variety of pieces such as poems, autobiographical sketches, short stories, and nature observations while engaging in the writing process of drafting, revising, responding and editing. Finally, each camper will choose a piece of his or her writing for publication in the camp anthology."
