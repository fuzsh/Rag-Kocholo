        "text": "The Emerging Writers Institute™ offers immersive workshops in fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry for both new and accomplished middle and high school writers. Through our intensive MFA-style workshops and engaging literary outings, EWI offers a rigorous and challenging writing experience for students. Supported by the guidance of experienced authors and instructors, young writers hone their craft in a collaborative environment. Our unique program lets young writers from around the world form and sustain literary friendships that can last a lifetime.\n\nThere are three levels of the Emerging Writers Institute: 5th-6th, 7th-9th and 10th-12th.\n\nNote: In order to attend the EWI, students must demonstrate their potential as writers by submitting a creative writing sample in any of the four major areas of focus. This program assumes that its students possess a significant understanding of the English language and are prepared to employ this familiarity in inspired and inventive ways."
