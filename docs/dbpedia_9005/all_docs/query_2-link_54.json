        "text": "Ask any of our young authors, and they’ll tell you: club time is one of the best parts of the camp. Each day, we host four to five different writing clubs that allow students to explore different areas of writing, from fantasy to playwriting to two-voice poetry.\n\nAt the end of the session, each camper chooses their favorite piece from the week to polish and publish in the camp magazine or online on Flipgrid. Every writer goes through revision, edits, and conferences with coaches to make sure their work is ready to be shared. As we say goodbye at the end of the week, we raise plastic cups of Sprite in our traditional author’s toast and celebrate the chance to share our writing with a real audience."
