Then we are off to the University of Pittsburgh’s Hillman Library Horror Archives, where text, film, sculpture, and monster objects proliferate. Tuesday’s Unit, Monster Building 101, invites students to step into the shoes of Victor Frankenstein, study the history of some of horror’s greatest mis-creations, and then work to build and bring to life our own fiendish beasts. Through this process, we’ll step into our villain era by writing a harrowing backstory for our scientist and plotting our revenge through character arcs, all while finishing up with some imagery exercises to ensure our creations have all the sensory details necessary to make everyone scream.\n\nOn Wednesday, we’ll pretend to be someone famous or infamous throughout history and explore their voice, mannerisms, and more through the art of monologuing! Acting and writing exercises abound along with a field trip to the August Wilson Center for playwriting inspiration! Make sure to bring some kind of unusual accessory or prop you have from home to camp this day. We step into personal storytelling on Thursday, as students learn all about the fastest growing genre of writing: creative nonfiction. We’ll create our own “true stories, well told” via a series of “I remember” exercises focusing on memory and self-conception, emerging with pieces of “flash” creative nonfiction.

He began storytelling in elementary school, spending far too much time on stories like Cleopatra the Cat Goes to Carnegie Hall and The Kangaroo that Won the Olympics. He has published multiple books and essays, including his favorite, “You Can’t Wrestle Windmills,” a creative personal essay about his first year teaching middle school. Girman was previously an immigration attorney, working to give voice to the hundreds of undocumented minors apprehended at the Texas-Mexican border and awaiting placement at multiple children’s homes. “Young people have their own stories,” Girman says. “And I’m not sure if the adults in their lives always take these seriously. I’m excited to help our summer camp students tease out their stories and better their own lives because of it.” He also Uber drives when he can, ruminating over the rich stories shared from the back of his grey Toyota.\n\nJennifer Schaupp\n\nJennifer Schaupp (she/her) is, by day, an adjunct professor at Point Park University and the education manager of the Standardized Patient program, role-play education to help medical students communicate empathetically, at the University of Pittsburgh. By night, she is a storyteller whose particular interest in playwriting has coalesced into interdisciplinary projects with local and national arts organizations, including the Pittsburgh Fringe Festival and Spilling Ink in Washington, D.C. Also, she is a comedic improvisor, recognizing how theatre saved her from the humiliation that is high school when she made others laugh in the female version of The Odd Couple. She hopes the joy of theatre can have the same positive impact on the summer campers.\n\nStephanie M. Wytovich\n\nStephanie M. Wytovich (she/her) is a wisp of smoke, a haunted violin, the rumor you heard about the haunted house down the street. When the sun rises, she teaches horror and creative writing at Point Park University while also mentoring students at Western Connecticut State University and Southern New Hampshire University in their MFA programs. However, when the moon takes its rightful place in the sky, she enjoys returning to her desk to create ghoulish creatures and unsettling worlds of her own, usually with a pit bull or two by her side. A recipient of the Elizabeth Matchett Stover Memorial Award, the 2021 Ladies of Horror Fiction Writers Grant, the Bram Stoker Award, and the Rocky Wood Memorial Scholarship for non-fiction, Wytovich enjoys nothing more than a cup of hot tea, a rainy day, and glimpsing a ghost or two out of the corner of her eye."
