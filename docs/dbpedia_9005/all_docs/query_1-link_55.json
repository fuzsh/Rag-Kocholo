        "text": "Wick Juniors Writing Camp\n\nWednesday, July 10 - Sunday, July 14, 2024\n\nRegistration for Wick Juniors Summer Camp has reached capacity.\n\nThis year we have a special opportunity for our Wick Juniors students. On Friday, July 12, U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón will be in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park to promote her project, “You Are Here: Poetry in Parks,” an initiative with the National Park Service and the Poetry Society of America. Ada Limón will meet with our Wick Juniors students for an hour that day along with other area students. We will have more details and information about this exciting experience soon.\n\nTo be placed on the waitlist in case of cancelation or with any questions you might have, please email us at wickjuniors@kent.edu.\n\nMission Statement\n\nWick Juniors offers opportunities for young writers to have a positive experience exercising their own capacities for self-expression.\n\nWick Juniors Writing Club began offering a summer camp in 2016. This camp is offered in partnership with the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Students entering grades 3 through 12 will experience one day with the Wick Poetry Center teachers at Kent State University, followed by a three-night, four-day stay at the Environmental Education Center (EEC) in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.\n\nThrough guided hikes, pond dips, and more, the young writers will explore how the natural world influences our writing. A culminating reading will be held on the grounds of the CVNP.\n\nTrained Wick Poetry Center teaching artists and the CVNP Environmental Education Center teachers will facilitate the camp activities."
