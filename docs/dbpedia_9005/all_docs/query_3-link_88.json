She is a graduate from the University of Oregon’s MFA program and has attended workshops through the Clarion Foundation, Lambda Literary, and Tin House, where she was a 2021 scholar. Her fiction can be found in publications such as One Story, Witness Magazine, Passages North, and Lightspeed Magazine and has been nominated for anthologies like the PushcartPrize and Best of the Net. Nic has also written essays and articles for Autostraddle, Tor.com, and them. She is currently at work on a collection of short stories and a novel. Nic has been writing and telling stories since before she could pick up a pen or type on a keyboard. She loves to find literature that features exciting and beautiful language about surprising and strange stories and characters. Some of her favorite books include Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado, This is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El Mohtar & Max Gladstone, and The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. She can also rattle off way too many facts about dinosaurs. www.nicanstett.com\n\nRachel Didovicher\n\nFaculty\n\nRachel Didovicher (who also goes by Ms. D.) has been writing creatively since before her second grade teacher took her aside to show her how to use quotation marks. She also loves singing and acting. When she was in fourth grade, she entered her one-act play about a five-sided snowflake into a local kids’ playwriting competition and won. She loves learning and has had many wonderful opportunities as a student. She attended Case Western Reserve University in her hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, receiving both her B.A. in English and Theater Arts and her M.A. in English Literature. She received her M.F.A. in Creative Writing and Publishing Arts at the University of Baltimore, where she published stories and poems in Welter and wrote and designed a book of short fiction called The Painted Window. Teaching is another passion of hers. She taught high school English both in Cleveland and Baltimore and has been adjunct writing faculty at Stevenson since 2015. These days, she finds creative inspiration in raising her two sons, one of whom has autism (and both of whom have amazing minds). She has been serving as editor for her son’s as-yet-to-be named novel about a kid supervillain. She is so excited to get creative with tween writers this summer!\n\nJordan Hansen\n\nFaculty\n\nJordan Hansen is an adjunct professor of First-Year Writing at Stevenson and a Ph.D. Candidate at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
