        "text": "“Insightful information and activities that expanded my horizons and inspired me!”\n\n“It was amazing! Fun, yet still productive and educational.”\n\n“My instructors were so great! I loved the writing exercises–– they made me step out of my comfort zone. I also loved that my teachers were so understanding and made sure to give us breaks and chances to chat and get to know each other better throughout camp.”\n\n“I loved how my writing instructors brought me out of my comfort zone yet still helped make me feel safe in this environment. I got to experiment with a lot of genres, shared my own writing, and became inspired by hearing peers' work.”\n\n“I didn't think I could do improv or a comedy routine, but my instructor made that possible. I had so much fun laughing with everyone in this class and realized that improv is not as difficult as I had initially believed. I also found out that I could be funny (something that I had doubted before). Our instructor also made sure everyone felt safe and that no one was making inappropriate jokes, and I appreciated that.”\n\nCan my student receive school credit?\n\nWe do not offer college credit for this program, though, if requested, we can send a letter to your student’s school confirming their participation in our summer program.\n\nWill my student have homework?\n\nStudents typically do not receive homework, but may be asked to come prepared for the next class with fresh ideas. It is important to note that each workshop is run independently and the work they will be asked to do is dependent on the faculty members.\n\nDoes my student need to be an advanced writer?\n\nThis program is for anyone who has a desire to become a writer—to discover or fine tune the skills they already have. Whether the student is a beginner or an advanced writer, the faculty works with each student to create and move toward individual goals in a supportive, noncompetitive environment.\n\nWhat is the theatre component of the program?\n\nIn The Writer’s Theatre workshops, the creative process is explored in an intuitive and spontaneous fashion through improvisation, group projects, and games. Faculty and students participate together to give form and shape to both individual and collective expression. No prior theatre experience is necessary.\n\nWho are the instructors for the program?\n\nOur courses are taught by dedicated education professionals and Master of Fine Arts Writing Program and Theatre Program candidates from Sarah Lawrence College. We also have a large support staff available to you and your student to assist with any questions that may arise.\n\nAre scholarships available for Writers Week?\n\nLimited scholarships are available to Yonkers Public School students, made possible by our partnership with the Yonkers Public Schools. Please contact your student’s principal for more details, or email the Writing Institute at writinginstitute@sarahlawrence.edu."
