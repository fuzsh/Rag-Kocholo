        "text": "We offer full-day in-person and virtual half-day camps for ages 8-18 from June through August. We have a wide array of workshop topics covering genres like fiction, poetry, scriptwriting, songwriting, and journalism. Our camps provide dedicated writing time, engaging exercises, and the personalized guidance of experienced, working writers. With only 6-12 campers per session, young writers receive individualized attention and thrive in a supportive, collaborative environment. More than just skill development, our camps foster confidence and a love for writing.\n\nThe Lighthouse Summer Writing Intensive is led by published and award-winning writers, and each workshop is designed to foster creativity, self-expression, and excitement about writing. During the week, young writers will work at length with a number of published instructors in a variety of genres and will leave camp with new knowledge about the craft of writing, at least one completed piece of work, and enthusiasm about pieces to come. Campers will be invited, but not required, to share a piece of writing in a public reading at the end of the week. Writers of all experience are welcome to apply!\n\nExplore all summer camp offerings through our 2024 catalog. We hope you join us this summer to solve puzzles, follow clues, and find hidden treasure; embody your literary heroes through improv to help you write well-rounded characters; play with speculative prompts to build complex and atypical characters and invent fascinating new worlds; find inspiration for your writing in the natural world; and so much more!"
