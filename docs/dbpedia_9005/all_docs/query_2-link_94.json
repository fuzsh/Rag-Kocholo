        "text": "At Project Ink, our writing summer camp, students will develop their love for writing. Using their imagination to create their own fictional story, students will learn practical tips and useful techniques to become better writers. We want to pique students’ imagination and show them that they can be good writers. We teach them the power and the fun of choosing words to create tone and certain moods. We teach them how to incorporate a variety of sentence structures as a way of changing the pace and feeling of the story. We teach them the power of dialogue and how it can be a great way to cut through long narratives and make writing flow more easily and dynamically. We teach them to use figurative language as a way to create mental pictures for their reader and to emphasize important parts of their stories. Furthermore, the elevated confidence that results from creative writing always translates over to the other writing types such as commentary and formal essay writing. Students realize that they have something to say and can use their writing to share their ideas with others.\n\nProject Ink is a two-week summer creative writing camp for students entering 4th to 8th grade in Fall 2024. We try our best to keep the teacher to student ratio at 1 to 8 (but may go up to 9 in some classes).\n\nThe registration fee is $840 per student (not including the Eventbrite processing fee of $58.18).\n\nProject Ink is Monday through Thursday for two weeks (EXCEPT for Session 1, we will have class on Friday, June 28 because of the July 4 holiday falling on a Thursday).\n\nClasses are three hours per day from 9:30 to 12:30 p.m. (morning session) or 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. (afternoon session).\n\nSTEP 1: CHOOSE A SESSION\n\nSession One: June 24 to July 3, 2024 - For Session 1, because we will not have class on July 4th (falling on the 2nd Thursday), we will have an extra class on Friday, June 28. Therefore, classes for Session 1 will be Monday (June 24) to Friday (June 28), and then Monday (July 1) to Wednesday (July 3).\n\nSession Two: July 8 to July 18, 2024 (Monday to Thursday)\n\nSession Three: July 22 to August 1, 2024 (Monday to Thursday)\n\nSTEP 2: CHOOSE MORNING OR AFTERNOON\n\nMorning: 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.\n\nAfternoon: 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nSTEP 3: CHOOSE A GRADE LEVEL\n\nUpper Elementary (4th & 5th Grade): entering 4th and 5th grade in Fall 2024.\n\nJunior High (6th to 8th Grade): entering 6th and 8th grade in Fall 2024.\n\nGRADE VERIFICATION: We will verify the grade level of your child. Please do not register for a different grade class just because the class for your child's actual grade is full or unavailable. Also, please do no register your child for a class that is above their grade level despite how advanced you think they are. Only register for the correct Project Ink camp for the actual grade that your child will enter in Fall 2023. Upon request, you must provide a verifying grade report to confirm the registration. If you enroll your child for a Project Ink camp that does not match his actual grade, his registration will be cancelled.\n\nTECH REQUIREMENT: All students must bring a laptop (not an iPad due to formatting issues) and have access to a Google account to use Google Docs. Please also make sure two-step authentication is turned off so that your child does not have a problem accessing their account. Please note that their school accounts will NOT WORK because they are generally restricted, so you will need to set up a personal Google account separate from their school accounts.\n\nWhen registering, you will be required to provide your child's Gmail address (not a school account). Therefore, please have your child's Gmail account set up BEFORE you start the registration process.\n\nDuring Project Ink, they will practice the five steps to the writing process: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing a finalized story. As students work through the five steps of the writing process, they will successfully complete the following objectives:\n\nPrewriting\n\nStudents will learn to make their own choices. During our pre-writing sessions, we will provide the time and teacher-supported prompting to help students thoughtfully bring to life each element of their story. Students will practice asking questions and making the logical connections needed to successfully brainstorm the following:\n\nThe Setting\n\nUse the setting as an influencing factor on the characters and make choices on which landscape, architecture, or geography will be featured to have a significant impact on the plot\n\nBuild description and elaboration through concrete and sensory details, imagery, and figurative language while eliminating fluff, cliches, and repetition\n\nCreate contrasting setting moods through implied detailed description to build emotional arcs\n\nCharacter Development\n\nDetermine which characters will remain flat/static (simple one-trait characters) and which ones will be complex/dynamic (characters with layers of both good and bad or characters that undergo change)\n\nCreate three-dimensional backstories to define the characters as relatable, believable, and original\n\nDifferentiate characters through unique appearances, personal tastes, actions, thoughts, and speech\n\nGive characters strengths and weaknesses as driving forces behind the conflict and the resolution\n\nBuild characters with a personality and voice. Students can choose to do so through an intimate first-person perspective or an omniscient narrator who unbiasedly or biasedly reveals the characters’ thoughts and feelings\n\nThe Conflict and Resolution\n\nChoose between a selection of conflicts that will position the protagonist against society, the setting, a social group, or another character\n\nPlay around with the sequence of events by building a story that includes flashbacks, flashforwards, or a discordant timeline\n\nConstruct a plot that reflects a theme that is important to them\n\nComplexify the conflict with different points of view, where the characters might not agree with each other on the best way to solve the problem\n\nDetermine if the story will be a happily-ever-after, an unanswered cliffhanger, a comical ironic twist, or a story that comes to a bitter end\n\nDrafting\n\nStudents will start with a workable and mendable outline that we provide. Teachers will give continuous direction while students craft sentences to ensure they do not fly by their plotline without detail or explanation. Students will be encouraged to draft their initial stories with their original intentions in mind, as outlined in their prewriting. But students can make changes as the story develops. Students will:\n\nEffectively use their prewriting as the skeleton to organize writing\n\nLearn to use Google Docs and appropriate organizational tools to keep track of the story’s flow from the beginning, middle, to end\n\nFind and fill holes or illogical gaps in the story with new information\n\nEliminate wasted words and space by incorporating active word choice through power verbs, aiming to write with fewer words but with words that create the greatest impact\n\nAdd specific tone through descriptor phrases\n\nRevising\n\nStudents will revise their final products multiple times. This allows students to see their writing improve each time we review, add, move, or eliminate. We work through revisions by giving students individualized comments and one-on-one conferencing with each student. The discussions will determine where and when students can do any of the following:\n\nAdd extra elaborative details to ideas that have not been fully developed\n\nRevise word choice that is awkward or not impactful enough\n\nIncorporate dialogue and interior monologue to break up longer descriptions and to give the reader a personal connection to the characters\n\nFind places where transition phrases will create a clearer storyline\n\nEditing\n\nWith general editing tools, students will take the lead on finding their own mistakes. Students will practice the habit of self-checking for spelling mistakes, misused or forgotten punctuation, formatting mistakes, and grammatically incorrect sentences. For students who lack confidence in this writing step, the teachers will work with the student to identify mistakes. Students will:\n\nPractice the use of correct editing marks\n\nDevelop the habit of reading their writing multiple times\n\nPublishing\n\nWe want our students to walk away from the project with a final project that they feel carries the value of all the work put into it through the prewriting, drafting, and multiple revisions. Students will be able to embellish their story before a final print, adding graphics, a creative cover, table of contents, dedication, about the author, and back-cover summary. Our students will finish the project with the satisfaction of being able to share their story with loved ones."
