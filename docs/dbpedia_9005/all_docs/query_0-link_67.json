Guided by an outstanding faculty of published writers, you will experiment with multiple genres, deepen your understanding of the craft, and cultivate the confidence to share your work with the world.\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nDuring Interlochen's writing camp, you’ll focus intensively on two genres of creative writing. Genre workshops include:\n\nFiction\n\nNonfiction\n\nPlaywriting\n\nPoetry\n\nIn addition to exploring the fundamentals of your chosen genres, you'll discuss a wide range of published works, and craft your own pieces via in-class exercises and roundtable workshops with a class of dedicated peers. You’ll also experience the natural beauty of Northern Michigan via our Environmental Explorations class, attend readings by award-winning faculty and visiting authors, and learn to craft your work for publication and performance. Each session culminates in a camp anthology and student reading.\n\nWorkshop Placement\n\nStudents benefit from exposure to a broad range of literary forms. By studying forms outside of your primary genre, you’ll gain new insight into the styles you love most.\n\nAfter enrolling, students rank the four genres in order of preference. We’ll do our best to accommodate the top two choices, however, space is limited. We encourage students to submit preferences as soon as possible!\n\nPortfolio Requirements"
