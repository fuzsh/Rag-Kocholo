If you enrolled over the phone, our office will start your enrollment, but you still need to complete your enrollment online, which includes completing/submitting the Camper Enrollment Form.

If you are having trouble accessing online enrollment, you must print the consent form and scan/email it to Info@lavnercamps.com prior to your child attending camp. The consent form constitutes the entire agreement and no section of the consent form may be waived by any other writings or methods of communication.\n\nCamp Medical Form\n\nTo provide us with your child’s medical form, please upload your camper health form to your online account or scan/email your form to Info@lavnercamps.com, prior to your child’s first scheduled day of camp.\n\nYou may submit the health form that you used for your child’s school this school year or submit the following form:\n\nCamper-Health-History-Form\n\nMinimum Grade Requirement\n\nThe minimum grade requirement is the completion of Kindergarten prior to the start of your child’s camp.\n\nCamp Tuition\n\nThe tuition for each camp is located in the calendar on each camp location page.\n\nPrivate Lessons at Camp\n\nPrivate lessons are offered in many of our camp subjects.

Packets will include detailed information for your location, week, and courses including drop off/pickup information, what to bring to camp, campus maps and directions, and more.\n\nLinks to Summer 2024 Camp Packets will be posted here as they become available, and sent via email to all registered families!\n\nSnack Period\n\nA snack period is offered each day for 15 minutes to give a chance for campers to take a break, eat a tasty snack, and to socialize! Campers should bring their own, nut-free snack to camp.\n\nRecess Period\n\nA recess period is offered each day following lunch. Recess can consist of games providing options for exercise, team play, and lots of fun! Recess is typically 35-45 minutes and takes place outside, weather permitting.\n\nAuthorized Individuals to Pick Up a Camper\n\nIn order for an individual to pick up and sign out your child from camp, he/she must (1) be listed on your online Camper Enrollment Form as an authorized individual to pick up your child and (2) present a valid driver’s license or government issued photo ID. The Camper Enrollment Form is the form you completed during online enrollment, and the question pertaining to Authorized Individuals to drop off/pick up is on the first page of this form.

The only exception is at certain universities that require a catered lunch to be purchased as part of camp registration.\n\nIf signing your camper up for our catered lunch program, please do so in your online account by the Friday prior to your child’s upcoming camp week. If you need to add any of these options during the camp week, please send your request directly to Info@lavnercamps.com and we will do our best to accommodate you (and will charge your credit card on file).\n\nLunch information and menus will be available in your Camp Packet in the Spring.\n\nIf your child does not bring a lunch to camp and is not signed up for our lunch program, we will purchase lunch for your child that day and bill the method of payment in your account (i.e. charge your credit card on file).\n\nNut-Aware Camp\n\nFor the safety of our campers, we are a Nut-Aware camp. Please do not send any nut products to camp with your child. While we are a “Nut-Aware” camp, we cannot guarantee a nut-free environment.\n\nMedication Storage and Administration\n\nFor the safety of our campers, all drugs (medications) are stored under lock and key except when in the controlled possession of the person responsible for administering them. For prescription drugs (medication), they are given only under the specific instruction/directions of a licensed physician. For nonprescription drugs (medication), they are given under the signed instructions of the parents or legal guardian or signed instructions from the camper’s physician.\n\nOnline Household Information\n\nWhen you create your online account with Lavner Education, please make sure to include your address and any important contact phone numbers (home, cell, work) and additional/emergency contacts.\n\nCAMP TECH REVOLUTION Apparel\n\nFree t-shirt: Every camper receives one “Camp Tech Revolution” t-shirt.\n\nAdditional Camp Tech Revolution and Lavner Camps apparel is available for purchase from The Lavner Camps Store at any time.\n\nBehavioral Policy\n\nLavner Education reserves the absolute right to dismiss a camper without refund for any behavior (1) that threatens or endangers the welfare and/or the safety of any camper, instructor, or any other person involved with the camp, (2) is disruptive to the overall camp environment, which interferes with the beneficial use and enjoyment by campers and staff, or (3) for any form of bullying of other campers or disrespectful behavior to camp authority.\n\nLavner Education emphasizes a safe, fun, and healthy camp environment that fosters learning and friendship, and appropriate camp behavior is essential to a great overall experience for everyone involved. It is imperative that every camper feels included, safe, and part of our camp community.\n\nCampers must be potty trained in order to attend camp. A potty trained camper is someone who can 1) communicate to an instructor that he/she needs to go to the restroom, 2) be able to stop what he/she is doing, to go and use the restroom, 3) utilize the restroom facilities without any assistance and 4) postpone going to the bathroom for up to 10 minutes if they must wait for someone who is in the restroom or if they are not near a restroom. In accordance with the American with Disabilities Act, reasonable accommodations will be made for campers with disabilities.\n\nCamp Electronic Device Policy\n\nCampers are not permitted to use cell phones, personal computers, or any other electronic devices that connect to the internet while at camp except for camp owned computers used for camp purposes, unless otherwise determined by the camp. “While at camp” pertains to all times that a camper is on location at camp. If you would like to get in touch with your child during the camp day, please contact our onsite camp director. The onsite camp director’s contact information (name, phone, and email) will be listed on the chalkboard at the sign in location. During the camp week, you may also contact our central office (Info@lavnercamps.com or 888.854.2267) to obtain the contact information for the onsite director. Additionally, if your child would like to contact you during the camp day, he/she may contact you through the camp director or camp instructor.\n\nProject Completion\n\nWe strive to have every camper complete the project minimums for each camp per the camp descriptions, however, this also requires the active participation and attendance of the camper.\n\nInternet Connectivity\n\nIn the event of an internet outage at the camp location, we will offer alternate tech-related activities at camp and make every effort to ensure campers continue to progress in technology.\n\nPersonal Property Policy\n\nCampers may bring personal items/equipment to camp, but Lavner Education is not responsible or liable for any personal equipment that is lost, stolen, or broken.\n\n\"Lost and Found\" Policy\n\nLavner Education is not responsible or liable for any personal items/equipment that is left behind at camp. Lost and Found items/equipment may be held at camp until the last day of camp.
