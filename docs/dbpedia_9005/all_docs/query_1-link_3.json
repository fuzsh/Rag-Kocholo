        "text": "New writer pals\n\nMake some new friends in an environment where you can say “I’m writing a YA sci-fi novel about a teenage alien spy and…” and not feel like a complete weirdo.\n\nThere’s a campfires. There are movies. There have been dance parties. There has been fishing. And there are usually fireflies.\n\nDon’t be a jerk: That’s kind of what our whole thing boils down to. Have fun, relax, and enjoy yourself. Have some beer around the fire. Have spirited conversations if that’s your thing, but know when to drop it. Just remember that there are other people who are taking time off for this and want to recharge and get writing done.\n\nQuiet hours: start at 10:00 p.m. in the residential area, which is everything west of the office (bathroom and shower buildings, bunkhouse, private rooms).\n\nIf you choose to drink: know your limits. Remember that others are sleeping nearby, sharing bathroom facilities, and didn’t sign up to babysit.\n\nSafety: If your behavior infringes on the safety or enjoyment of other campers, either before or during camp, Barrelhouse and Team Godspeed may expel you from camp. No refunds will be given, and Barrelhouse and Team Godspeed are not responsible for any costs accrued.\n\nYou must be over 21 years of age.\n\nNo pets.\n\nWriter Camp does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, height, weight, physical or mental ability (including HIV status), veteran status, military obligations, or marital status.\n\nNOTE FOR 2024: vaccinations will be required for Writer Camp 2024. If you’re accepted to camp, we’ll ask for a photo of your vaccination card. DOB and location information can be edited out if you’re worried about sharing personal information."
