The Prime Minister of the Republic of Yemen is the head of government in that country. The current prime minister, Abdul Qadir Bajamal, has held the position since 31 March 2001. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President. The position of Prime Minister of Yemen was created when the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen Arab Republic merged in 1990.

Prior to unification, each of the two countries had its own Prime Minister: the Prime Minister of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Prime Minister of the Yemen Arab Republic.

When Aden seceded as the Democratic Republic of Yemen for a number of weeks in 1994, Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas served as the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen.
