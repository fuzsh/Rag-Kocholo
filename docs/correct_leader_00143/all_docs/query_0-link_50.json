Photograph: KM Chaudary/AP\n\n-------\n\nShah Meer Baloch in Islamabad and Hannah Ellis-Petersen in Delhi\n\nTue 9 May 2023\n\nInternet services have been suspended across Pakistan after violence erupted when the former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, was arrested at a court appearance in Islamabad and dragged into an armoured vehicle by scores of security forces in riot gear.\n\nThe arrest of Khan – who was ousted from power last year and has evaded arrest several times since – came hours after he released a video message reiterating his allegations that Pakistan’s powerful military establishment had tried to assassinate him twice.\n\nKhan’s arrest is the latest twist in a political and economic crisis that pits the popular former prime minister against the military and the government, led by his successor, Shehbaz Sharif, whom Khan alleges conspired to remove him from power and make threats on his life, charges they deny.\n\nHours after his arrest, protests began to erupt across Pakistan, with the army accused of orchestrating his detention. More than 40 people were arrested and officials said one protester had been killed after they were shot by an officer near a military checkpoint in the city of Quetta. In Karachi, a police vehicle was set on fire and in Lahore, supporters broke into the house of the military corps commander, smashing windows and setting furniture on fire, while shouting: “We warned you not to touch Imran Khan.”\n\nMobile internet services were cut across the country, according to the Pakistan telecommunication authority, and access to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, where videos of the protests were being widely shared, was restricted.\n\nLate on Tuesday the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office issued a new travel warning advising against travel to several regions of Pakistan, and saying that “further disruption should be expected.”\n\nKhan had travelled to Islamabad on Tuesday morning to seek bail in two corruption cases, some of dozens involving corruption, sedition and terrorism that he is facing.\n\nAs he entered the court premises, Khan was arrested by agents from the National Accountability Bureau, the country’s anti-corruption body, who were followed by a contingent of paramilitary officers. Khan was put into a vehicle with tinted windows and driven off under heavy security, while a scuffle broke out between his supporters and police.\n\nAccording to a statement released by Islamabad police, his detention was connected to a separate case, known as the Al-Qadir Trust case, which involves allegations Khan earned billions of rupees through illegal land transactions and where he had not been granted bail. It stated that Khan would be produced before the court on Wednesday.\n\nKhan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) called his arrest a “black day for our democracy and country”. Fawad Chaudhry, a PTI spokesperson, alleged Khan had been “abducted from court premises, scores of lawyers and general people have been tortured, Imran Khan has been whisked away by unknown people to an unknown location”.\n\nIn a video posted to PTI’s official Twitter account, the barrister Gohar Khan alleged Khan had been struck on the head and the legs by paramilitary officers who entered the premises of the Islamabad high court to arrest him.\n\nThe interior minister, Rana Sanaullah, said Khan’s arrest was because of his failure to turn up to hearings in a corruption case and denied all allegations of torture. “The arrest has been conducted by the National Accountability Bureau for causing losses to the national treasury,” he said.\n\nAfter Khan’s arrest, the chief justice of Islamabad, Justice Aamer Farooq, demanded an explanation “within 15 minutes” from the police chief and the interior ministry secretary as to why Khan had been detained. “Come to court and tell us why Imran has been arrested and in which case,” he said. Farooq said that if they did not appear, he would summon both Khan and the prime minister, Sharif.\n\nThe arrest warrant for Khan was released soon after, dated 1 May, stating he was accused of “corruption and corrupt practices”. On Tuesday night, the Islamabad high court ruled that the arrest was legal and that Khan had ignored several notices to appear in court.\n\nInsp Gen Akbar Nasir Khan, of Islamabad police, urged calm and said the situation in Islamabad was normal. However, in an attempt to prevent protest, a section 144 was imposed in the city to prevent gatherings of more than five people and internet was cut off in some areas.\n\nSince Khan fell from power in April last year in a vote of no confidence, he has been on a crusade against Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, and in particular the senior army generals who it is widely acknowledged helped bring him to power. But after the relationship disintegrated, they orchestrated his removal as prime minister.\n\nHe accused the military and the Sharif government of a “western-backed conspiracy” to topple him and of being behind an attempt on his life in November last year, when a gunman opened fire during a rally in Punjab and Khan was shot in the leg. This week, the media wing of the armed forces issued another strongly worded rebuttal of Khan’s allegations.\n\nYet during this time Khan’s popularity his soared, with many admiring his determination to go up against Pakistan’s military establishment, which has long been Pakistan’s political puppet master. There is widespread discontent with the Sharif government, as inflation and food shortages have rocketed, and it is expected that Khan could return to power in the next general election, due in October, if he is not disqualified from politics before then.\n\nKhan has been putting pressure on the Sharif government to call an early general election, claiming that the coalition that took power after he was removed is “illegitimate”.\n\nSource: theguardian.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/pakistan-former-pm-imran-khan-arrested-in-islamabad\n\n-----\n\nDelivering an Anti-Semitic Sermon Iran Cleric Says Muslims That Don’t Go On Hajj ‘Might Die As A Jew’\n\nMuslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba and pray at the Grand mosque ahead of annual Hajj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia August 16, 2018\n\n(Photo credit: ZOHRA BENSEMRA/REUTERS)\n\n------\n\nMAY 10, 2023\n\nThe representative for the Islamic Republic of Iran’s supreme leader in the Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province delivered an anti-Semitic sermon in late April, declaring that Muslims who can afford the Hajj pilgrimage but do not go “might die as a Jew.”\n\nNassir Hosseini said “There are those who are wealthy but do not want to go on Hajj. There are those who have real estate, and if they sell off 100, 50, or 10 square meters, they can afford to go on Hajj twice, but they refuse. This will cause them hardship.”\n\nThe Shi’ite cleric continued that “The Prophet said that if a person is rich but does not perform the Hajj, he might die as a Jew. There is such a hadith. A person on his deathbed could die as a member of the Jewish religion. A person who is financially well-off and physically healthy, and does not perform Hajj can be thrown out of Islam. In the last moment, he will die in the Jewish religion, as you see in the hadith.”\n\nBeni Sabti, an expert on Iran from the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, told The Jerusalem Post on Wednesday, Hosseini’s anti-Semitic sermon “ is something very common in Iran.” He added, “When you call someone a Jew in Iran, it is like cursing him.”\n\nIranian antisemites invoke the word Jew to insult people, Sabti said, noting they wish to convey that “he is not honest, he is cheap, he is a liar, and he hides something or he does not do things like in the clip” about Hosseini.\n\nSabti said Hosseini’s usage of the word Jew is an insult and “is anti-Semitic and a Nazi word in Iran “ and has “ for many of hundreds of years a tradition in Iran.”\n\nSabti, who was born in Tehran, said about his time growing up in Iran that “I remember as a child seeing on the walls on sayings from Imams or the Prophet Mohammad that blame a Jewish woman for killing the Prophet. They made this up. Mohammad died naturally.”\n\nThe sermon conducted by Hosseini was aired on Dena TV in Iran on April 28, 2023 and translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).\n\nFormer US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said during the Trump administration that Iran’s regime is the leading state-sponsor of antisemitism.\n\nThe CEO of the US-based Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, said during a congressional hearing in 2020 that the Islamic regime in Tehran was the top state sponsor of Holocaust denial and antisemitism.\n\nBahraini Islamic scholar talks about The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\n\nIn a separate but related anti-Semitic sermon, the Bahraini Shi'ite Islamic scholar Ibrahim al-Safa claimed in an April 14, 2023 lecture in the village of Karzakan that the anti-Semitic document The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were \"produced\" at the 1897 first Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nAccording to the US Holocaust Museum, “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is the most notorious and widely distributed anti-Semitic publication of modern times. Its lies about Jews, which have been repeatedly discredited, continue to circulate today, especially on the Internet. The individuals and groups who have used the Protocols are all linked by a common purpose: to spread hatred of Jews.”\n\nThe Museum added “The Protocols is entirely a work of fiction, intentionally written to blame Jews for a variety of ills. Those who distribute it claim that it documents a Jewish conspiracy to dominate the world. The conspiracy and its alleged leaders, the so-called Elders of Zion, never existed.”\n\nThe Protocols have gained enormous traction in the Arab world, Turkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nMEMRI located and translated Safa’s antisemitic conspiracy diatribe.\n\nHe said \"Herzl made a concerted effort to gather all the Jews from everywhere. He sought to create Zionism and to establish a central leadership for the Jews. What did they seek to achieve? They sought to gather what was left of the Jews. The first meeting was held in 1897 in Switzerland. This meeting was the most dangerous Jewish gathering. The Jewish leaders, thinkers, and political strategists were there, and they produced the so-called Protocols of the Elders of Zion. These protocols represented the basic principles of the Zionist movement, which are satanic and dangerous principles. Satan undoubtedly collaborated with them in the creation of these principles.”\n\nSafi continued that \"The first protocol they agreed upon, as was mentioned in the newspapers, stated that Zionism must control the world, and not just a specific piece of land. No. They had a big plan to establish Greater Israel, which would stretch from the Nile to the Euphrates.”\n\nHe said \"When you engage in politics with the Jews, you must be careful, because they have no principles, values, or ethics. All that they present to you is just for appearances' sake. Another principle which they agreed upon was the need to drown the Gentiles... The term 'Gentiles' appears in their holy book. They refer to all non-Jews as 'Gentiles', who are the servants of the Jewish race. There is us and there is them, according to their view. Those [Gentiles] must be drowned with vice, prostitution, drugs, and abomination, by means of the plans made in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\"\n\nSource: jpost.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-742609\n\n--------\n\nUN Security Council Invites Pope Francis, Al-Azhar Imam For Joint Speech\n\nPope Francis (L) poses for a picture with the Grand Imam of al-Azhar mosque Sheikh Ahmed Al-Tayeb during their meeting at the Papal residence near the Sakhir Royal Palace, in the eponymous Bahraini city on Nov. 4, 2022. - MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images\n\n------\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\nCAIRO — The head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis, and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed el-Tayeb, have received an official invitation from the United Nations Security Council to each deliver a historic speech during its meeting in June in New York, Al-Monitor has learned.\n\nAn Egyptian clerical source told Al-Monitor that the ?speeches of the prominent religious leaders will be delivered before a high-level session of the council dubbed, “The ?Importance of Human Fraternity Values in Promoting and ?Sustaining Peace,” due in mid-June at the UN’s headquarters.?\n\n\"The United Arab Emirates [which will be holding the Security Council’s presidency] will highlight pressing and urgent humanitarian issues and try to take serious steps toward establishing security and ending conflicts around the world,” the invitation states.\n\nThe two religious leaders will confirm their attendance this month, the source told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity.\n\n“They [the two leaders] are used to supporting any step that can promote peace in the world, so their attendance could help solve crises and stop wars around us,” the source added.\n\nThe historic speeches will come at a time the world is witnessing unending quarrels, fights and wars. The war in Ukraine has entered its second year and the latest fighting in Sudan could destabilize the fragile situation in Central, North and West Africa.\n\nMoncef Slimi, a political analyst on Arab and European affairs and head of the German-Maghreb Institute for Culture and Media, told Al-Monitor that it would be the first time the Security Council hosts two religious leaders as prominent as Pope Francis and Sheikh Tayeb.\n\n“That would be an important political and moral message at a difficult time for the world, both in the Arab world where wars are raging, most recently in Sudan, as well as in the West, where Ukraine's war continues unabated,” he said.\n\nIn January 2011, relations between Al-Azhar and the Vatican were severed against the backdrop of remarks made by Pope Benedict XVI on Islam and Muslims, which were interpreted by some in Egypt as accusing Muslims of persecuting adherents of other religions in the Middle East and calling for intervention to protect them.\n\nHowever, Tayeb's visit — who is known as a moderate and centrist religious leader — to the Vatican and his first meeting with Pope Francis in May 2016 ushered in a new era for Al-Azhar and the Vatican. The meeting motivated Pope Francis’ trip to Egypt in 2017.\n\nSince then, nine meetings between the grand imam and the pope have taken place.\n\nIn February 2019, the two leaders signed the “Document on Human Fraternity,” which they presented to the world in Abu Dhabi. One year later, the UN General Assembly adopted the document and called on the international community to observe Feb. 4 as the annual “International Day of Human Fraternity.”\n\nFather Rafic Greiche, supervisor of Le Messager Catholic weekly newspaper and secretary of the Information Committee for the Catholic Church in Egypt, told Al-Monitor that the invitation to deliver a speech at the UN comes as the culmination of the same process that led to the signing of the historical Document on Human Fraternity.\n\nHe said that the UN has formed an international committee consisting of some heads of churches and Islamic institutions to engage in dialogue with governments to mainstream the principles contained in the historic document, which calls for an end to religious-based hatred and extremism.\n\nHe added that Pope Francis has sought to consolidate peace diplomacy since he was appointed head of the Catholic Church in 2013. He has also led many dialogues with leaders of churches and Islamic institutes that have helped strengthen relations between Christians and Muslims, according to Greiche.\n\nGreiche also mentioned the meeting between Pope Tawadros II, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and Pope Francis in Rome on Wednesday. They will pray together for peace and an end to all wars and crises affecting humanity, he said.\n\nThe visit comes on the 50th anniversary of the historic “Joint Christological Declaration” signed between the heads of the Coptic Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in 1973, which ended a 1,500-year theological dispute between the two churches.\n\n“Believers always need symbols of reconciliation from religious leaders in the midst of war and economic crises, especially considering that religion plays a central role in the lives of people in Egypt and the East,” Greiche said.\n\n“I expect that speeches calling for peace to move the sleepy consciences of politicians at the wheel, who are supposed to be aware that poor people are dying of wars and famines,” he noted. “That could push presidents and officials involved in wars to respond to the suffering of mankind.\"\n\nHowever, the ability to stop wars is a “relative [concept] and depends on politicians' responsiveness to their calls,” Slimi said.\n\nSource: al-monitor.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/un-security-council-invites-pope-francis-al-azhar-imam-joint-speech\n\n--------\n\nAlfie Best Jnr: 'I'm The Son of UK's Richest Gypsy – But Now I’ve Made Life-Changing Conversion ‘To Islam\n\nAlfie Best Jnr: 'I'm The Son of UK's Richest Gypsy – But Now I’ve Made Life-Changing Conversion' To Islam\n\n-----\n\n10 May 2023\n\nThe son of Britain’s richest gypsy says he has now found inner peace after turning to Islam.\n\nAlfie Best Jnr, whose billionaire dad, Alfie Snr, is one of the richest people in the country, reckons he is the first traveller to take up the faith, which has resulted in him ditching booze and instead studying the Quran.\n\nThe 25-year-old Romany gypsy is joint 85th on the Rich List for people under 30, with an estimated £10million fortune – he drives around in a £180,000 Bentayga Bentley, has a £1.2million fifth-floor Knightsbridge flat overlooking Harrods and wears a £150,000 platinum watch that is encrusted with grains of stone from a space meteorite.\n\nBut since becoming a Muslim, he now says prayers in Arabic five times a day and visits a mosque at least once a week, and all after finding Allah following a helicopter trip to Cornwall for lunch.\n\nHe and four friends flew off to a five-star hotel in his dad’s £4.5million Aston Martin helicopter for a bite to eat last September, but had to return early as one of his mates’ mum was attending a mosque in Lewisham, South London, for The Shahada – declaring her faith in one God, Allah.\n\nHe revealed to The Sun: “We were going for food afterwards so it was either sit outside in the car or take my shoes off and go into the mosque. My friend cried as his watched his mum take her Shahada.\n\n“And I felt something I haven’t experienced before in any religious place. It made my whole body tingle, like this is right for me.\n\n“Something was trying to either contact me or something was trying to reach me.\n\n“It was very, very strange but in a good way. I felt I belonged there.”\n\nThe entrepreneur, who is also super-featherweight professional boxer, left school at just 12 and hired a van and a driver to sell cleaning products to factory bosses.\n\nSuch was his success that he bought a nightclub just four years later – which he sold after 12 months – and now he owns two caravan parks and sells expensive watches.\n\nAlfie Jnr added: “I’m unique – I’m the only gypsy who has converted to Islam.\"\n\nHe had his own Shahada at Regent’s Park mosque and also revealed that while his father had reservations about his new life choice, his mother was fully supportive.\n\nSource: mirror.co.uk\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/im-son-uks-richest-gypsy-29940050\n\n--------\n\n‘King of Journalism’, Based On Turki Al-Sudairi, Premieres at Saudi Film Festival\n\nArab News tribute photo to Turki Al-Sudairi's passing. (AN Photo)\n\n------\n\nMay 09, 2023\n\nDHAHRAN: The life of esteemed Saudi journalist Turki Al-Sudairi has been memorialized in “King of Journalism,” a documentary that premiered at the Saudi Film Festival at Ithra this week.\n\nTurki Al-Sudairi, a pioneer of journalism in the region, had a career that spanned decades and earned him widespread recognition. The documentary’s title, “King of Journalism,” is a nod to the appreciating words of the late King Abdullah.\n\nAl-Sudairi worked for more than four decades in the Kingdom’s media industry. He began his career as a sports journalist for the Al Riyadh newspaper, then became involved in other areas of reporting, making his way up to managing the paper as deputy chief editor and later as chief editor.\n\nHis passing impacted journalists around the world. Ali Saeed, a former Al Riyadh journalist, was so moved by the loss that he decided to team up with his twin brother, Hassan Saeed, to direct and produce a documentary on Al-Sudairi.\n\n“Ali used to work in Al Riyadh newspaper for many years. When he became a full-time filmmaker, he decided to make a documentary about the inspirational Turki Al-Sudairi,” Hassan told Arab News.\n\nFor more than two years, the pair conducted meticulous researched and worked on their project. A critical aspect of that process was finding archives of Al-Sudairi’s work. Hassan added: “Al Riyadh newspaper and SRMG helped us with the archive. It was really a journey.”\n\nMazen Al-Sudairi, the son of the late journalist, was featured in the documentary. He told Arab News that he was proud of the film, which “tells the true story” of his father’s life.\n\nHe said: “The idea is to give the story an objective image and give the audience the chance or the space to judge his actual trial as a leader, as a journalist and as a writer.\n\n“He was editor-in-chief for 40 years, from 1974 till 2015. So many changes have happened in society, economy and geopolitics.

Some protesters took out their wrath on the military, storming the residence of the corps commander in Lahore and laying siege to a gate of the army’s General Headquar­ters in Rawalpindi.\n\nPolice fired teargas and water cannon to disperse Mr Khan’s sup­p­orters in Karachi and Lahore, while protesters blocked roads in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Pesha­war, Faisalabad, Multan, Quetta, etc.\n\nContempt proceedings\n\nThe way Mr Khan was arrested also prompted the Islamabad High Court to initiate contempt proceedings against the interior secretary and the police chief of Islamabad for mishandling the arrest, though it agreed the detention was made within the parameters.\n\nIHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq issued contempt notices to both these officials and directed the registrar’s office to get a case registered over the ransacking of the court premises.\n\nAfter an inquiry by the registrar, responsibility will be fixed in the case and a senior officer would be appointed to register an FIR in this regard. Further hearing was adjourned till May 16.\n\nImran arrested\n\nIn a surprise move, Rangers detained Imran Khan from the high court in an operation that lasted barely three minutes and whisked him away in a black vehicle.\n\nThe PTI chief was scheduled to appear before the IHC chief justice in connection with his petitions seeking to quash FIRs registered against him at the Ramna police station for inciting mutiny and with the Secretariat police over violence outside the Election Commission of Pakistan.\n\nMr Khan also appeared before an anti-terrorism court and the judge confirmed his bail in seven different cases.\n\nIn addition, Mr Khan sought pre-arrest interim bail from the IHC in a National Acco­un­tability Bureau (NAB) investigation on charges of corruption in the Al-Qadir University Trust case.\n\nMr Khan was required to conduct biometric verification at the diary branch of the IHC, but the Rangers contingent arrested him in the same case while he was completing this process.\n\nIn its case, NAB alleged that the PTI government struck a deal with Malik Riaz that caused a loss of more than $239m to the national exchequer, in a quid pro quo arrangement with the real estate businessman. In December 2019, Britain’s National Crime Agency had accepted a settlement offer of £190m, which included a UK property — 1 Hyde Park Place, London, W2 2LH.\n\nIt was valued approximately at £50m and all of the funds landed in the frozen accounts of Malik Riaz. Later, former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife were accused of accepting billions in cash and hundreds of kanals of land from Bahria Town in return for the help that Mr Khan’s government extended to Malik Riaz during the NCA investigation against him.\n\nIHC proceedings over arrest\n\nThe arrest created a wave of unrest among the PTI lawyers present in the IHC to welcome Imran Khan. Chief Justice Aamer Far­ooq took up the matter and summoned the secretary of the interior, the Islamabad police chief, and the additional attorney general.\n\nDuring the hearing, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and advocate Ali Bukhari, who accompanied Mr Khan, recalled the events leading up to the arrest of their client.\n\nBarrister Gohar told the court that Mr Khan was sitting in the diary branch to complete the verification process when some officials of Rangers appeared all of a sudden and tried to enter the office. However, when they found that the door was locked, they broke the windows and used pepper spray to discourage resistance.\n\nBarrister Gohar stated that one of the personnel struck Mr Khan on the head and another kicked his injured leg. He said that the officials then dragged PTI chairman from the said office to shift him into their vehicle.\n\nAdvocate Bukhari said that he was with Mr Khan in the ATC and then came with him to the IHC. He further said that Mr Khan’s movement was also being monitored through a drone.\n\nMr Bukhari told the court that after the Rangers used pepper spray, he could not see what happened and he also got injured in this incident. According to him, the Rangers smashed the windows and hurled abuses at Mr Khan.\n\n‘Against dignity of court’\n\nDuring the hearing, IHC Chief Justice observed that this matter is against the dignity and independence of the court, and anything beyond set parameters will not be tolerated and any person whether a minister or prime minister if found responsible will be taken to the task.\n\nAdvocate Khawaja Haris Ahmed argued that Mr Khan learnt that the inquiry in Al Qadir Trust was upgraded into an investigation on April 30 through a newspaper. He asserted that Mr Khan was seeking pre-arrest bail and also filed a petition before the IHC.\n\nHe argued that the investigation agencies show restraint in such situations and they keep waiting for the court’s orders but in this case, Mr Khan was arrested while he was resorting to legal course.\n\nAdditional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal told the court that since the arrest has been made, the counsel could approach the accountability court to redress grievances.\n\n“This is not simple as such,” remarked Justice Farooq. He then summoned director general and prosecutor general of NAB and adjourned the hearing.\n\nWhen the hearing was resumed, NAB Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi told the court that the bureau asked the federal government for Mr Khan’s arrest after serving him repeated call-up notices.\n\nInspector General Akbar Nasir Khan told the court that during the incident, some police officials also got injured. He denied having prior information regarding the arrest of Mr Khan but assured the court that he could probe the matter.\n\nViolent protests\n\nIn Rawalpindi and Islamabad, violent confrontations between the police and PTI supporters were witnessed followed by a crackdown on party supporters. In Rawalpindi, sensitive installations, including GHQ and Hamza Camp (Ojhri Camp), were targeted by the PTI supporters.\n\nTwo police officials –Waris Khan DSP Tahir Sikandar and Ratta Amral SHO Chaudhry Riaz were also injured in an altercation with the PTI workers.\n\nThe metro bus service was also suspended between the two cities.\n\nIn Lahore, the PTI workers gathered at Liberty Chowk and started marching towards the Cantonment. The announcements were made on social media sites to reach the Cantonment to protest outside the military corps commander’s house.\n\nIn footage circulating on different social media platforms, the PTI workers carrying clubs and party flags reached the corps commander’s house in the Cantonment area.\n\nThe protestors forced their way into the house while chanting slogans against the arrest of their chairman. They were also seen breaking the windowpanes, TV, and furniture of the house and also setting the trees and furniture on fire.\n\nIn another video, the PTI activists could also be seen pelting stones and bottles at an army convoy on Mall Road. The workers also set police vehicles outside Fortress Stadium Lahore on fire in addition to several security posts in the Cantt.\n\nSindh\n\nIn Karachi, hundreds of PTI workers took to the street in different parts of the province against the arrest of party chairman Imran Khan prompting action from the police resulting in the arrest of Ali Zaidi, a couple of MPAs, and dozens of opposition party workers.\n\nSharea Faisal turned into a battleground hardly an hour after the arrest of Mr Khan when PTI Karachi chapter president Aftab Siddiqi urged the workers to reach Insaf House – the party headquarters. As the workers marched on Sharea Faisal suspending traffic on the key road link, the police resorted to baton-charge and teargas shelling which attracted a strong reaction from the protests. In a three-hour-long face-off between police and the protesters, over a dozen vehicles, including a police van, and two check posts each of the Karachi police and Pakistan Rangers were set on fire.\n\nIn KP, after learning about the arrest of the PTI chief, scores of the opposition party’s workers reached the Hashtnagar Chowk in Peshawar blocking the Grand Trunk Road.\n\nThe protesters torched the replica of the Chaghi Mountain, where Pakistan conducted its first nuclear test in 1998. They also smashed the main gate of the provincial assembly’s building and threw stones inside the premises.\n\nIn Quetta, one person was killed and over a dozen injured, including six police personnel were injured in clashes between workers in clashes between the protesting PTI workers and police during a demonstration against the arrest of Imran Khan.\n\nIn Gilgit-Baltistan, protesters blocked many roads, including Karakoram Highway, at various points, leaving a number of travellers stranded.\n\nMohammad Asghar in Rawalpindi, Manzoor Ali in Peshawar, Saleem Shahid in Quetta, Imran Ayub in Karachi, and Ikram Junaidi in Islamabad also contributed to this report\n\nSource: dawn.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1751955/crunch-time-for-pti-as-imran-held-nationwide-riots-erupt\n\n--------\n\nUS, UK back ‘rule of law’ in Pakistan after ex-PM’s arrest\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nWASHINGTON: The top diplomats of the United States and Britain together called on Tuesday for adherence to the “rule of law” in Pakistan after former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest triggered nationwide violence.\n\n“We just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law, with the constitution,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a joint news conference in Washington.\n\nForeign Secretary James Cleverly, speaking alongside Blinken, noted that Britain enjoyed “a longstanding and close relationship” with Commonwealth member Pakistan. “We want to see peaceful democracy in that country. We want to see the rule of law adhered to,” Cleverly said.\n\nBoth declined to comment in further detail, with Cleverly saying he had not been fully briefed on the situation.\n\nUN says it’s monitoring political situation in the country\n\n“As we have said before, the United States does not have a position on one political candidate or party versus another,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said when asked about the situation in Pakistan.\n\nFair treatment\n\nThe United Nations said on Tuesday that it would monitor the political situation in Pakistan following Imran Khan’s arrest to make sure that all political figures in the country were treated fairly, Anwar Iqbal in Washington adds.\n\n“Our concern is making sure that all of the political figures in Pakistan are treated fairly and, of course, that the due process is followed,” said deputy spokesman for the UN Secretary-General Farhan Haq when asked to comment on Imran Khan’s arrest.\n\n“So, we will follow this process as it goes on to make sure that our concerns are being addressed,” Mr Haq added while addressing a Tuesday afternoon news briefing at the UN headquarters in New York.\n\nIn Washington, Amnesty International, a London-based rights group, shared a statement issued by its headquarters. “The clashes unfolding between Imran Khan’s supporters and security enforcement following the former prime minister’s arrest risk several human rights violations,” Amnesty warned in its statement.\n\n“We call upon authorities to show restraint, and ensure any response is in line with the principles of proportionality, legality, necessity, and non-discrimination,” it added.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, noted in a tweet that the situation in Pakistan was getting messier day by day.\n\n“Today it appears the Pakistan army has reached an ‘enough-is-enough’ moment re Khan. After several false starts/unsuccessful arrest attempts by the police, this time the mil took matters into its own hands,” he wrote. “What a mess!”\n\nJeremy McLellan, a social media personality who often comments on events in Pakistan, claimed in his tweet that “Imran Khan wasn’t arrested, he was illegally kidnapped … because he got too popular”.\n\n“The Pakistani people will not take this lying down,” he warned.\n\nMadiha Afzal, another scholar of South Asian affairs associated with the Brookings Institution, Washington, pointed out that “while things unravel in Pakistan, PM Shehbaz Sharif has stayed on in London for one more day “on [his brother] Nawaz’s instructions” — as per the information minister.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad, a former US diplomat who negotiated the peace deal with the Taliban, also commented on the situation following Iran Khan’s arrest.\n\n“The arrest of Imran Khan is deplorable and will have far-ranging consequences. I condemn it in the strongest terms,” he wrote in a tweet. “It’s painful to watch a country so rich in potential, with an ancient heritage of culture, natural resources, an entrepreneurial spirit and hard-working people, repeatedly be thrown into chaos by its own dysfunctional elites — civilian and military — with some exceptions.”\n\nHe also urged Pakistan’s allies — like China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE — to step in and help defuse the situation. “Countries with strong ties to Pakistan must help its leaders reach an agreement that averts the imminent meltdown,” he wrote.\n\nSource: dawn.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1751933/us-uk-back-rule-of-law-in-pakistan-after-ex-pms-arrest\n\n--------\n\nPM warns Imran over assertion of Pakistan becoming ‘jungle’\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Khan over his earlier assertion of Pakistan becoming a ‘jungle’, saying “facts were often bitter and disastrous” as he hinted at the former premier’s rule.\n\nThe statement comes a day after the ex-premier asked Shehbaz if military officers were above the law. The PTI chief, with a screenshot of the incumbent premier’s tweet, questioned if he could “dare” to ask the prime minister if he, as a citizen “who suffered two assassination attempts on his life in [the] last few months”, had the right to nominate those he thought “responsible” for the assassination attacks.\n\nRetorting to Imran’s tweets, PM Shehbaz maintained that he had “no doubt” that Imran’s politics were defined by “blatant lies, untruths, U-turns, and vicious attacks on institutions”. He added that Imran bent the judiciary to his “whims” and behaved as if rules did not “apply” to him.\n\n“What I said about you in my tweet is established by facts over the past few years,” he said, defending his earlier statement.\n\nListing “counter questions” Shehbaz stated that “maligning Pakistan Army as an institution” was a recurring pattern in Imran’s politics after his ouster. He questioned if Imran did “not resort to constant mud-slinging of the leadership of the army and intelligence agency much before the Wazirabad attack?”\n\nHe asked Imran what legal routes he adopted “other than hurling threats and making baseless allegations almost on a daily basis?”\n\n“You refused the offer of cooperation from the federal government and boycotted the legal proceedings. You were never interested in finding the truth about the attack but used the condemnable incident for petty political objectives,” he stated.\n\nHe further questioned at whose behest “the savaging social media campaign against the martyrs of the armed forces [was] launched after the helicopter crash?”\n\nSource: pakobserver.net\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://pakobserver.net/pm-warns-imran-over-assertion-of-pakistan-becoming-jungle/\n\n--------\n\n‘Imran’s Arrest Has Nothing to Do with Army’, Sources Said\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) arrested a political leader Tuesday in accordance with the law, which has no connection whatsoever with the Pakistan Army, sources said.\n\nHowever, some nefarious leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) incited their misguided workers and caused unnecessary damage to government properties and military installations and buildings, using their agitation and pressure tactics to further their political agenda.\n\nSources said under a particular heinous scheme, these miscreants were instructed to damage the buildings, assets, and properties of government and law enforcement agencies so that they could achieve their malicious political goals through intimidation and agitation.\n\nSources said despite the dissemination and violence by the PTI leadership and their unlawful actions, the agencies responsible for enforcing the law showed complete restraint and will continue to do so. However, some PTI political leaders continue to use the strategy of agitation and pressure on people to further their political gains, which is unacceptable and will be dealt with according to the law.\n\nSources said people should stay away from such nefarious and provocative elements, not take the law into their own hands, and avoid reprehensible acts of violence against government property.

He said Imran’s arrest was completely unjustified and unacceptable.\n\nHe said the PTI will hold peaceful but vigorous protests across the country to ensure the release of its chairman as soon as possible. He claimed that the Islamabad High Court (IHC) was raided to detain Imran Khan despite the fact that Imran had offered voluntary arrest in his statement before appearing in the court.\n\n“Detention of Imran Khan is fascism and it is condemnable to attack the Islamabad High Court during biometrics and injure lawyers,” he remarked and made an appeal to the chief justice of Islamabad High Court to issue an order for his immediate recovery and appearance in the court. Qureshi said the entire nation was deeply concerned about the health and safety of Imran.\n\n“There is a lot of anger in the entire nation against the abduction and torture of the PTI chairman and the PTI will register its strong protest without taking the law into its own hands. We will fight this battle through political and legal means for the safe recovery and release of the chairman,” he noted. The PTI vice-chairman made it clear that the schedule of the rallies released by Chairman Imran Khan was intact. “We are turning all these things into peaceful unity rallies. I appeal to all organizations to continue their preparations. All workers should remain peaceful and determined. We will win this war morally and politically,” he said.\n\nIn a video message, Qureshi has said the PTI will challenge the Islamabad High Court’s decision on PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s arrest before the Supreme Court of Pakistan today (Wednesday).\n\nHe said people’s reaction to Imran Khan’s arrest was natural as the arrest was unwarranted. He said Imran Khan had said before leaving for Islamabad that he would court arrest if there were warrants for it. There was no reason for resorting to violence, breaking glasses, manhandling lawyers and arresting PTI activists.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association Tuesday condemned the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan.\n\nIn a statement, President Abid S Zubairi and Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir said the arrest, which occurred on the court premises, had raised serious questions about respect for the fundamental rights and impartiality of NAB/law enforcement agencies.\n\nThey also condemned the assault and torture perpetrated by the law-enforcement agencies on the lawyers during the entire episode that violated the sanctity of the court.\n\nThey said the arrest represented a clear infringement of the principles of democracy, freedom of expression and the right to dissent. They also condemned the violence being perpetrated and asserted that it was a fundamental right to peaceful protest but no one should take law into their hands.\n\nThey also urged the government and law-enforcement agencies to uphold the rule of law, adhere to the principles of democracy, and provide a fair and unbiased judicial process to former prime minister and refrain from using state institutions as tools for political persecution and instead focus on fostering an environment of inclusivity and respect for human rights and law.\n\nSource: thenews.com.pk\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1068821-pti-panel-devises-strategy-for-imran-s-release\n\n--------\n\nMideast\n\nHamas Will Determine the Scale of Expected Escalation Between Israel, Islamic Jihad\n\n05/09/2023\n\nHamas faces a dilemma: Let the conflict remain between Israel and the PIJ or bend to pressure for a unified retaliation\n\nThree top commanders of the military wing of the Iranian-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror organization were killed early Tuesday morning by the Israeli army in Gaza. Israel is expecting a retaliation that most likely will lead to a significant escalation, but its scale will depend on whether Hamas will join the PIJ against Israel.\n\nIsrael’s targeted airstrike operation came after the PIJ fired over 100 rockets toward Israeli towns surrounding the Gaza Strip last week, in response to the death of PIJ member Khader Adnan following an 87-day hunger strike in an Israeli prison.\n\nIsraelis living within a 40-kilometer radius of the Gaza Strip were instructed by the IDF on Tuesday to open bomb shelters and stay near them, as this retaliation is likely to include the firing of rockets toward Israeli towns.\n\nThe IDF reported that 13 people total were killed in the bombings, including 10 civilians. The three commanders killed were identified as Khalil Al-Bahtini, the commander of Northern Gaza, Jihad Ghanem, a senior official in the PIJ’s military council, and Tareq Izz ed-Din, who coordinates the group’s terror activities in the West Bank from Gaza, according to the IDF.\n\n“Al-Bahtini was entrusted with approving and carrying out all terrorist activities from northern Gaza, as well as planning and directing terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and planned rocket attacks against Israel in the immediate future,” said the Israeli army.\n\nSecurity expert Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow at the Israel Institute for Security Studies, who served in various Israeli intelligence command positions, told The Media Line that the expected escalation has the potential of being very serious.\n\n“As we all know from previous rounds with the PIJ, after events like these, they launched rockets toward Tel Aviv. [These rockets] are not highly sophisticated, but they can cause damage,” he said.\n\nHowever, Citrinowicz believes that the real question is whether Hamas will decide to join the retaliation, “which will determine the [nature] of this escalation.”\n\nDr. Omer Dostri, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and an expert on national security and military strategy, says that Israel must be prepared for three types of escalation that all remain a possibility.\n\nThe first type “is a basic and low-level conflict lasting for one or several days, involving only PIJ while Hamas remains inactive,” he told The Media Line. The second, he continued, “involves a collective response from all terrorist factions in Gaza, including Hamas, and can last for two to several days of military conflict.”\n\nThe third possibility is a multifront conflict where Israel would face attacks from both Gaza and the northern borders with Lebanon and Syria.\n\n“It is expected that such attacks would include a thousand rocket launches in the first and second options, as well as the use of UAVs, sniper shootings, RPGs, and anti-tank weapons, targeting both military and civilian targets,” Dostri said.\n\nCitrinowicz notes that for Hamas, whether to join the PIJ in its response is a great dilemma and the group’s leadership is likely currently discussing strategic ways to face the situation.\n\nWake up to the Trusted Mideast News source Mideast Daily News Email\n\nOn the one hand, Israel weakening the PIJ is not a bad thing for Hamas, as in some way it is one of its biggest power contenders in the Gaza Strip. Also, Hamas usually hesitates to escalate knowing that clashes with Israel will have a high cost for the organization, he explained.\n\nOn the other hand, “Hamas is considered to be the protector of the Gaza Strip and it cannot stay on the sidelines,” Citrinowicz said. If it does not join, it may lose its credibility as Gaza’s protector figure.\n\nDostri notes that currently, “Hamas is not interested in engaging in a full-scale military operation or war with Israel. Instead, it aims to strengthen its position from within Gaza and improve the economic well-being of Gaza’s residents for political gain, which will help maintain popular support,” he said.\n\nFurthermore, he pointed out that Israel has targeted only the Islamic Jihad and has communicated to Hamas that it has no intention of targeting them. That said, Hamas faces significant pressure to join the conflict with Israel and support the Islamic Jihad.\n\n“If Hamas does not respond to the Israeli attack, it will break the existing equation which Hamas and other terrorist organizations attempted to impose on Israel,” Dostri said, explaining this equation as any Israeli attack in Gaza resulting in a unified and comprehensive response from all factions in the strip.\n\nRegarding the timing, Citrinowicz said that the targeted attack is most likely triggered by the rocket attacks launched by the PIJ toward Israel last week.\n\n“The continued aggression from the Gaza Strip has left Israel with no option but to respond strongly to the terrorism against it,” Dostri agreed.\n\nNonetheless, he added that Israel prefers to engage in offensive initiatives and deception to achieve operational success against terrorist organizations in Gaza.\n\n“Israel has been waiting for the right operational moment, which includes accurate and high-quality intelligence, favorable weather conditions, and other factors, to launch a military operation against these groups,” he said.\n\nSource: themedialine.org\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://themedialine.org/top-stories/hamas-will-determine-the-scale-of-expected-escalation-between-israel-islamic-jihad/\n\n--------\n\nIsraeli airstrikes against the Islamic Jihad armed group kill 13 people in Gaza\n\n10.05.23\n\nThe Israeli military launched airstrikes against the Islamic Jihad armed group in Gaza on Tuesday, killing three of its leaders, ending an uneasy weeklong cease-fire between the two sides and leaving them braced for a sharp escalation in cross-border violence. Palestinian officials said that the airstrikes had killed at least 10 civilians, including children.\n\nThe pre-dawn strikes hit residential buildings across the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, roughly a week after an exchange of fire between Islamic Jihad and Israel.\n\nIslamic Jihad, which Israel, the US and many other western countries classify as a terrorist organisation, confirmed that three of its senior leaders were among the dead. The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza said that at least 13 people had been killed and 20 others injured. Among the dead were Dr Jamal Khiswan, a director of the Wafa Hospital in Gaza, and his wife and son, the ministry said.\n\nTensions in the region had been high after the death in Israeli custody last week of a Palestinian hunger striker who was a leader of Islamic Jihad. Violence has also been on the rise recently in Israel and the occupied West Bank. The death of the hunger striker, Khader Adnan, was followed by rockets fired at Israel from Gaza, and retaliatory strikes by the Israeli Air Force.\n\nMembers of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government pressed for a stronger response.\n\nSource: telegraphindia.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/world/israeli-airstrikes-against-the-islamic-jihad-armed-group-kill-13-people-in-gaza/cid/1935642\n\n--------\n\nIsrael awaits Gaza counter-strike after killing of Islamic Jihad leaders\n\nMAY 9, 2023\n\nFollowing the IDF’s targeted killing of three top Islamic Jihad leaders in the middle of the night between Monday and Tuesday, Israel was still awaiting a potentially massive counter-strike of rockets from Gaza on Tuesday night.\n\nThe main questions are: When will Islamic Jihad strike back, will Jihad fire rockets beyond the South and will Hamas join in a serious way for the first time since the May 2021 Gaza conflict?\n\nOn one hand, Hamas’ Gaza leadership does not take orders from Iran, has avoided multiple rounds of fighting between Israel and Islamic Jihad over the last two years and IDF intelligence views it as currently preferring stability over war. On the other hand, Hamas cannot afford to appear weak in the eyes of its general public in comparison to Islamic Jihad.\n\nFurther, former IDF intelligence chief Tamir Hayman said that Hamas’ leadership outside of Gaza often is more in favor of conflict, for one because it does not put them or their immediate teams in danger.\n\nOperation Shield and Arrow\n\nIsrael’s proactive strike, dubbed Operation Shield and Arrow, on the three Islamic Jihad leaders was framed by Israeli political and military officials as a move to reestablish deterrence following the recent round of rockets and airstrikes on May 2-3.\n\nThroughout Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials held consultations with key security officials, including finally discussing the issues with the security cabinet - who was not informed of the strike on Islamic Jihad beforehand.\n\nAlready Tuesday evening, Islamic Jihad had started to try to respond, but at least one of its rocket crews was killed when the air force destroyed a car holding a rocket crew of two on their way to attack.\n\nThe officials assassinated in the earlier IDF strikes included: Khalil Bahitini, the commander of the al-Quds Brigades in the northern Gaza Strip, Tareq Ezzaldin, a spokesperson for the movement who also manages terrorist activities in the West Bank and Gaza, and Jihad Ghanem, secretary of the movement's military council.\n\nThey were all killed almost simultaneously, within minutes of each other, by a mix of around 40 aircraft and drones.\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday that already on May 2 he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had approved the IDF and Shin Bet moving toward such a major operation.\n\nThe week-long delay was attributed to a mix of technical factors, such as weather, avoiding larger ancillary civilian casualties and other factors.\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant Tuesday night said, \"This episode was not just an act of terror, but against our residing in our land.\"\n\n\"The goals were realized in their entirety. Islamic Jihad's Gaza leadership was eliminated,\" he said.\n\nFurther, Gallant said, \"We can multiply it and carry it out on other fronts and against varying threats.

Qatar condemned the strikes while special U.N. Middle East peace coordinator Tor Wennesland condemned the killing of civilians and called for restraint.\n\nThe developments offered a political reprieve for Netanyahu.\n\nJewish Power, a far-right party in his coalition government, said it was ending a boycott of parliamentary voting called in protest at what it deemed lax policy on Gaza, attributing its decision to \"the transition from containment to attack\".\n\nMore than 100 Palestinians and at least 19 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in violence since January.\n\nIsrael captured Gaza and the West Bank, areas Palestinians want for an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital, in a 1967 war.

We call for all parties to de-escalate the situation. The U.S. commitment to Israel’s security remains ironclad.”\n\nIsrael launched Operation Shield and Arrow on May 8.\n\n“Terrorism is a threat to civilians everywhere. [Palestinian] Islamic Jihad and its leaders have been threatening the security of Israelis for too long. The IDF has launched a targeted campaign against Islamic Jihad in Gaza,” posted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Twitter with a video explaining who PIJ is and stating that Israel “will stand against terrorism.”\n\nOn May 9, Israel took out three top leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is a U.S.-designated terrorist group: Khalil Bahitini, Tarek Az Aldin, and Jahed Ahnam.\n\nBahitini “was entrusted with approving and carrying out all terrorist activities from northern Gaza as well as, planning and directing terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and planned shooting attacks against Israel in the immediate future, he was also responsible for the rocket fire toward Israel in the past month,” according to the IDF.\n\nAz Aldin was the director of Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s operations in the West Bank from Gaza, according to the IDF.\n\nHe “was entrusted with planning and directing multiple attacks against Israeli civilians, the coordination between the Islamic Jihad in Judea and Samaria, as well as transferring funds for terrorism from Gaza to Judea and Samaria,” according to the IDF.\n\n“Az Aldin was also responsible for disturbing inciting content of the terrorist organization in Israel meant to promote and encourage terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians,” the IDF said.\n\nAccording to the IDF, Ahnam “entrusted with coordinating weapons and money transfers between the Hamas terrorist organization and the Islamic Jihad.”\n\nIn addition to the three senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad members, 10 others were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.\n\nSenior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh warned of retaliation for the strikes.\n\n“Assassinating leaders with a treacherous operation will not bring security to the occupier, but rather more resistance,” he said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement, Palestinian Islamic Jihad threatened that “the Palestinian response to this heinous aggressive massacre will not be delayed.”\n\nSource: theepochtimes.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.theepochtimes.com/white-house-urges-israel-palestinian-islamic-jihad-to-de-escalate-amid-violence_5253525.html\n\n--------\n\nCanadian court sentences two brothers for brutal assault on Muslim men\n\n10/05/2023\n\nTwo brothers were sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison for a vicious assault on two Muslim men, but “no sentence can undo the harm to our family,” said the wife of one of the victims.\n\nThe assault took place July 15, 2018, as reported by Anadolu.\n\nAbu Marzouk, then 39, his wife Diana Attar and their two daughters, aged 4 and 6, were about to head home after a picnic in Mississauga, just outside of Toronto.\n\nTwo men approached the family’s vehicle and Marzouk got out to speak to them. They had indicated that they had been hit or nearly so by the vehicle. The pair then yelled anti-Arab racist remarks and one man struck Marzouk in the face and the other began beating him as his daughters watched from inside the van.\n\nMarzouk sustained life-threatening injuries. The assailants also attacked Fuat Yucel, then 49, a friend of Marzouk and a Turkish national, when he attempted to help the victim. Yucel received major injuries.\n\n“The Abu Marzouk and Yucel families, as is typical for many who suffer such attacks, have been struggling for years in the aftermath of the incident—physically, mentally, and emotionally,” the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) said in a statement Tuesday, following the sentencing. “This is the hidden and unreported reality of hate in Canada. The difficulties and traumas do not end when the attack ends.”\n\nAttar said she was glad that “this is over and our family can move on towards the road to healing” but the pain will remain.\n\n\"There is no sentence that can undo the harm to our family,\" she said at a news conference.\n\nNadia Hasan, NCCM’s chief operating officer, said hate crimes are on the rise in Canada. For that reason, the organization has urged a National Support Fund for Victims of Hate-Motivated Crimes.\n\nIn 2021, the National Action Summit on Islamophobia recommended the fund be established.\n\nSource: yenisafak.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/canadian-court-sentences-two-brothers-for-brutal-assault-on-muslim-men-3664155\n\n--------\n\nCAIR-Houston Congratulates Muslims Elected to Fort Bend County MUD\n\nIsmail Allison\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\n(SUGAR LAND, TX, 5/9/2023) – The Houston chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-Houston), a chapter of the nation’s largest civil rights and advocacy organization, today congratulated three Muslim community members elected to serve as part of the Fort Bend County Municipal Utility Districts (MUDs).\n\nAther Mohiuddin has been elected to serve in MUD 134B, while Asif Quereshi and Mohammed Rizwan have been elected to serve in MUD 134C.\n\nIn a statement, CAIR-Houston Director William White said:\n\n“Their victories are significant for the American Muslim community and the wider community in Fort Bend County.

It’s going to do the opposite because we don’t join the military to express ourselves,” he said. “All we have in common is that we’re all afraid that we get our heads shaved, then we’re part of a team, and our job as a military is alliance, solidarity, forward defense, and deterrence. And a deterrent is a way you avoid conflict by projecting strength.”\n\nO’Neil also emphasized the importance of having strong men and women who are the best for the job.\n\n“I’m all about freedom. You do what you want behind closed doors, or on your own time, but we need to have submarines with nuclear capability, aircraft carriers, men and women who fly jets, and the best infantry in the world, which is the United States Marine Corps,” he added.\n\nO’Neil further stated he believes “our military needs to be ferocious, not fabulous.”\n\nHis comments came after the U.S. Navy enlisted “drag queen influencer” Yeoman 2nd Class Joshua Kelley as their “digital ambassador” in November 2022.\n\nKelley, who goes by the stage name “Harpy Daniels,” announced the news in a video on his social media platforms.\n\nHe referred to himself as “an advocate for the LGBTQ community in the military.”\n\n“I am Joshua Kelley, currently 2nd class petty officer in the U.S. Navy. I identify as Non-Binary and this has been an unbelievable experience since I’ve joined the Navy,” he wrote in the caption.\n\nHe concluded his statement, writing, “Come follow me on this journey and see where we go next. Thank you to the Navy for giving me this opportunity!”\n\nIn June 2022, Ret. Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr of the Heritage Foundation spoke with NBC News, about the decline of people willing to join the military.\n\n“This is the start of a long drought for military recruiting,” he said.\n\nHe added, “2022 is the year we question the sustainability of the all-volunteer force.”\n\nSource: ijr.com\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://ijr.com/navy-seal-who-helped-kill-bin-laden-slams-drag-queen-ambassador/\n\n--------\n\nEurope\n\nChoice between ‘Breaking Law and Missing Prayers’ At Aberdeen MosqueIn Scotland\n\nMay 10 2023\n\nBy Alastair Gossip\n\nCommunity leaders “never thought it would get so busy” at the former Frederick Street School, which Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre (AMIC) took over in 2021.\n\nThe popularity of Aberdeen Central Mosque is leading to problem parking, with leaders even urging members to “miss prayers” rather than compound the issue.\n\nNow “very, very worried” trustees have asked the city council to help.\n\nBut the Imam, Ibrahim Alwawi, has called for the change to cover all city mosques and other places of worship too.\n\nThe root of the problem parking: ‘Everyone loves to go and pray’ at Aberdeen Central Mosque\n\nCouncillor M Tauqeer Malik painted the city transport committee a picture of the problem, as he called for assistance.\n\nThe mosque is next door to the Frederick Street multi-storey, which has earmarked spaces for the Aberdeen Health Village across the road.\n\n“AMIC is a great addition for our Muslim community, a really good, reasonable space to pray on Fridays,” Mr Malik said.\n\n“There are a few other venues but it’s very, very busy on Fridays because everyone loves to go there and pray.\n\n“Sometimes people are breaking the law, parking on double yellow lines and across the road or using NHS-marked spaces.”\n\nAberdeen Central Mosque leaders urge people to ‘miss prayers’ rather than break the rules\n\nMr Malik said trustees were so worried by the problem parking that they have urged worshippers to even “miss the Friday prayers”, rather than add to the trouble.\n\nTheir concerns have fallen on deaf ears though.\n\nCurrently, parking is free in Aberdeen’s pay and display car parks until 1pm on Sundays.\n\nThis allows Christian worshippers to drive to church without a financial barrier or fear of landing a fixed penalty notice ticket.\n\nBut Sunday is not a universal Sabbath. The Qur’an’s most important day of prayer is a Friday.\n\nCity chiefs will now price up how much it would cost to afford Aberdeen’s Muslims the same flexibility over Friday lunchtimes.\n\nAberdeen Central Mosque Imam: ‘Equality for all houses of worship’\n\nImam Ibrahim Alwawi told The Press And Journal it is “all about equality” and supporting Aberdeen Central Mosque to succeed.\n\nHe fears the issues could deter people from attending at all, especially given the present cost of living.\n\n“This is a consideration of the religious need to encourage those who want to practice their faith,” he said.\n\n“We are not talking about every day. It would just be once a week, for two hours for the most important sermon and prayer of the week.\n\n“Lunchtime is very tight. People want to pray and to eat and when you introduce finding parking and paying it becomes stressful.\n\n“We are talking about all mosques. And I want to be clear, we are calling for this to cover all houses of worship.”\n\nSource: pressandjournal.co.uk\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen-aberdeenshire/5654281/aberdeen-central-mosque-parking-problems/\n\n--------\n\nRare and important Iznik water bottle at Bonhams Islamic and Indian Art sale\n\nLONDON.- A rare and important 16th century Iznik pottery water bottle known as a surahi is to be offered at Bonhams Islamic and Indian Art sale in London on Tuesday 23 May 2023. Made in Turkey in around 1575, the 37.8 cm. high bottle is estimated at £100,000-200,000.\n\nThe water bottle comes from the collection of the Rolin family. The Belgian businessman Leon Rolin (1871-1950), nicknamed 'The Lion of Cairo', was the owner of one of the largest civil contractors in Egypt. His firm built the Heliopolis Palace Hotel, which on its opening in 1910 was the most luxurious hotel in Africa. (It was taken into public ownership in 1958 and is now a presidential palace).\n\nInspired by their surroundings, Leon and his wife, Madeleine formed a collection of Islamic art which was added to by their daughter Jacqueline. She later returned to Belgium and distributed her rich collection amongst her children and their descendants.\n\nOliver White, Bonhams Head of Islamic and Indian Art, said: “This beautiful bottle with its motifs of red roses, blue hyacinths and cypresses is a rare and important survivor. The cypress tree, which had been present as a decorative element in Turkey since the early 15th century began to appear on dishes and related forms such as this water bottle in the third quarter of the 16th Century.”\n\nOther highlights of the 219-lot sale include:\n\n• Two rare 17th/18th century Safavid embroidered cotton panels from the Caucasus, probably Azerbaijan. The panels were once in the collection of Lieutenant General Augustus Pitt Rivers (1827-1900) ethnologist and archaeologist whose collection of around 22,000 objects became the founding collection of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford. They are estimated at £60,000-80,000 and £40,000-60,000.\n\n• A Timurid moulded pottery mihrab tile, Central Asia, second half of the 14th Century. This beautifully crafted terracotta panel takes the form of a mihrab arch. The terracotta has been delicately carved in high relief to give the pierced effect of a veil of lace, with the subtle luminous glazes of rich turquoise, white, lilac and aubergine floating against the deeply recessed ground.\n\n• An illuminated Qur'an, Safavid Persia, Shiraz, second half of the 16th Century. Formerly in the collection of the late Dr Mohammed Said Farsi (1935-2019), it is estimated at £30,000-40,000.\n\nSource: artdaily.cc\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://artdaily.cc/index.asp?int_new=157126&int_sec=11#.ZFtH93ZByM9\n\n--------\n\nCrawley Coronation celebrations 2023: Kings Coronation Party event at Crawley Mosque\n\n9th May 2023\n\nOver 40 guests inc. neighbours, friends, army and police participated as well as members of the local Ahamdiyya Muslim members who attend the Noor Mosque for lunch.\n\nThe President of the AMA Crawley branch Adeel Shahzad, said:“The UK AMA is celebrating the event up and down the country to share the nation's joy on the occasion of the King’s Coronation with parties and prayers. Events included sharing delicious food cooked and served by the AMA community as well as games and fun for children. Our Worldwide spiritual head, Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad sent a message of special prayers for the King where his Holiness said:“I pray that the occasion of His Majesty’s Coronation proves not only a means of bringing people of different nations together but also a means of fostering a spirit of trust and mutual understanding in society and between nations.\n\n“It is my prayer that may God Almighty through His Grace and Beneficence, keep our honoured King safe and in good health. May his reign be one of peace and prosperity for the world, and may the attributes of justice, tolerance and freedom of belief forever remain the guiding principles of the British Monarchy. Amen”\n\nAt the Noor Mosque the proceedings began with recitation of the Holy Quran by Atta-ul Haq followed by a short speech by Lt. Harry Brimacombe from the Prince of Wales’ 4th Battalion in Northgate, who outlined “the importance of the special occasion and the uniting of different communities and what joy and honour it was being part of those celebration at Noor Mosque”\n\nJeredyne Stanley, from River’s charity for empowering women explained how the organisation helps women and said:“our programmes and resources help local women to expand their skills and become an active part of our community. We also signpost the community to other organisations that can support them.” Several members of the group attended the celebration.\n\nAhsan Ahmedi, the spokesman for the AMA Crawley in his address stated that:“faith has always been our inspiration and not just from the teachings of Islam, but others also as all religions are from God”.\n\nHe cited examples of Prophet Moses (pbuh) on how “he did not rebel against the Pharoah but after delivering the message of God, he led his people to migrate following the consecution persecution. But remained loyal to him up until that moment”.\n\nLikewise, he said, when Jesus (pbuh) was confronted by those trying to stir trouble, “that to whom should loyalty belong, to God or Caesar?” he replied “to both in their own right- Lend to Ceasra what belongs to Ceasar and to God what belongs to God” (Mark 12:17)\n\nFinally, Mr. Ahmedi cited the example of the Holy prophet of Islam, Prophet Muhammed (pbuh) that “After severe persecution in Mecca, he sent some of his companions to Abyssinia to live under the rule of a fair and just Christian King and to live in peace and in obedience under him. In fact, some companions even joined the Kings army to fight a battle to protect his nation and after winning that battle, the companions showed great joy that they had won and had protected the King.\n\n“It was this principle of Islam, to be loyal to the country where you live, which led to the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, the Promised Messiah, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (pbuh) to celebrate Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897 and also King Edward VII’s coronation in 1902.\n\n“Loyalty to one’s nation and giving back to society as loyal, peaceful citizens is a fundamental duty of every Muslim, especially to a nation which grants you freedom of faith and to live in peace, something Mirza Ghulam Ahmad highlighted in the book he wrote as gift to Queen Victoria on her Jubilee entitled “Gift to the Queen”\n\nThe proceedings at Noor Mosque ended with everyone present standing for the National Anthem and then concluded with silent prayers for the King, nation and world peace.\n\nOver 100 people attended the event at Noor Mosque who enjoyed the food provided by the community, cooked by their catering team led by Muhammed Harris.\n\nSource: sussexexpress.co.uk\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/news/people/crawley-coronation-celebrations-2023-kings-coronation-party-event-at-crawley-mosque-4135228\n\n--------\n\nPupils raise staggering £38k to help with Islamic centre renovations\n\n10-05-23\n\nA group of children from Blackburn have raised a staggering £38,265 to help with renovations at their local madressa.\n\nPupils from the Dawat-e-Islami Education Centre based on the corner of Granville Road and Leamington Road, have also challenged themselves to reach £40,000 in the coming weeks.\n\nThe 75 pupils and their parents had initially set a target of £8,000, with each child asked to raise £100, but soon it soon became clear the children were going to surpass that figure quite easily.\n\nA spokesperson for the centre said: “We’re very proud of our children and they have shown that with the right support, they can achieve great things, and this is exactly what we aim to achieve at our education centre.\n\n“Recently, the children climbed Pendle Hill to help raise money for the renovations. It was a wonderful effort by the young fundraisers and we are thankful for their efforts.\"\n\nThe Islamic centre, which was a former church, is presently at full capacity and the expansion will mean 300 children will be able to study for free and be taught by qualified teachers.\n\nThe Dawat-e-Islami acquired the building following the closure of the Leamington Road Baptist Church in 2014.\n\nThe decision to sell the building, which opened in 1895, was due in a large part to spiralling maintenance and repair costs.\n\nSince taking over the site the charitable group has looked to renovate the historic building and give it a new lease of life to serve the local community.\n\nSource: lancashiretelegraph.co.uk\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original\n\nhttps://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/23510102.pupils-raise-staggering-38k-help-islamic-centre-renovations/\n\n--------\n\nNottingham Emmanuel School addresses 'unfounded claims' made by pupils about Muslim prayer\n\n9 MAY 2023\n\nStaff at a Nottingham secondary school have moved to address 'unfounded claims' made by pupils in a TikTok video about Muslim prayer.

We are working with our Muslim students and community to address the unfounded claims made in the video.\n\n\"We have always allowed Muslim students to pray and have provided the space and opportunity to do so within school.
