        "text": "SANAA (AFP) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh asked Electricity Minister Ali Mujawar to form a new government to replace the one headed by Abdul Qadir Bajamal.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide any further details.\n\nMajor donor countries, concerned that the reform process in Yemen has stalled, have stepped up pressure on Sanaa by linking aid to tangible change.\n\nSaleh, who first took office as leader of the then North Yemen in 1978, has survived a 1994 civil war with the former communist south and Al-Qaeda-inspired violence in Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland.\n\nGovernment fores are also locked in battle with followers of the rebel Zaidi tribal leader Abdul Malek al-Huthi in the state's mountain regions.\n\nThe tribe led a rebellion against government forces in 2004 and 2005 that left hundreds dead.\n\nThe Zaidis are an offshoot of Shiite Islam dominant in northwestern Yemen, but form a minority in the mainly Sunni country.\n\nThe rebels reject as illegitimate the regime which seized power in a 1962 coup known as the September 26 revolution, overthrowing a Zaidi imamate."
