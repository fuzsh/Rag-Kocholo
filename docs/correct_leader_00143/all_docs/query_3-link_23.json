        "text": "A. Ba\n\nBa, Amadou (b. May 17, 1961, Dakar, Senegal), economy and finance minister (2013-19), foreign minister (2019-20), and prime minister (2022-24) of Senegal. He was a presidential candidate in 2024.\n\nB. Ba\n\nBa, Babacar (b. June 14, 1930, Kaolack, Senegal - d. Dec. 13, 2006, Dakar, Senegal), finance and economic affairs minister (1971-78) and foreign minister (1978) of Senegal.\n\nBa, Ibrahima, finance minister of Mauritania (1977-78). He was also minister of planning (1975-77), crafts and tourism (1977), and commerce (1978).\n\nBa, Mamadou Moustapha (b. Aug. 6, 1965, Nioro du Rip, Senegal), finance minister of Senegal (2022- ).\n\nBa, Ousmane (b. 1919, Ségou, French Sudan [now Mali] - d. Oct. 24, 1999), foreign minister of Mali (1964-68). He was also minister of civil service of Upper Volta (1957-58), minister of labour, civil service, and social security of the Mali Federation (1959-60), and minister of civil service and social laws (1961-62) and interior, information, and tourism (1962-64) of Mali. Arrested after the 1968 coup, he was released in 1975.\n\nBa, Ousmane, Mauritanian politician. He was minister of primary education (2013-14) and national education (2014-16), ambassador to The Gambia (2016-17), and permanent representative to the United Nations (2017-19).\n\nBa Maw (b. Feb. 8, 1893, Maubin, Burma [now Myanmar] - d. May 29, 1977, Rangoon, Burma [now Yangon, Myanmar]), Burmese politician. He first came to prominence in 1931 as defense lawyer for the Burmese rebel leader Saya San in the colonial courts. He became a prominent opponent of Britain's plan to separate Burma from India, since he believed that a separate Burma would receive a much smaller measure of self-rule than India as a result, but he reversed his position in 1934, agreeing to support the pro-separationists in a coalition government. That year he was made minister of education. In 1936 he founded the Sinyetha (Poor Man's) Party. When the new constitution, providing for separation of Burma from India, went into effect on April 1, 1937, he became the first premier. He attended the coronation of King George VI and held office until he was defeated by a coalition in February 1939. After his defeat, Ba Maw allied with other Burmese leaders to form the Freedom Bloc, which opposed Burma's participation with the Allies in World War II. In August 1940 he was arrested by the British for sedition and remained in prison until the Japanese invasion in 1942. During the Japanese occupation, he was adipati (head of state) of a theoretically independent Burma (1943-45), although the country was actually a Japanese satellite. He fled to Japan when the Allies reentered Burma. Eventually captured, he was imprisoned by the Americans in Sugawo prison in Tokyo from December 1945 to July 1946. Returning to Burma after his release, he founded the Mahabama (Greater Burma) Party but this had little success. He was again jailed from August to December 1947 on suspicion of complicity in the assassinations of Aung San and other leading ministers in July 1947.\n\nBa Swe (b. Oct. 7, 1915, Onbinkwin, Burma [now Myanmar] - d. December 1987), defense minister (1952-58) and prime minister (1956-57) of Burma.\n\nBa U (b. May 26, 1887, Bassein, Burma [now Myanmar] - d. Nov. 9, 1963), president of Burma (1952-57). He was also chief justice of the Supreme Court (1948-52). He was knighted in 1947 but upon becoming president became known as Dr. Ba U rather than Sir Ba U.\n\nK.R.M. Baah\n\nBaah, Kwame R.M. (b. May 21, 1938, Dormaa Ahenkro, Brong Ahafo region, Gold Coast [now in Ghana] - d. April 8, 1997), foreign minister of Ghana (1972-75). He was also minister of lands and mineral resources (1972).\n\nBaah Wiredu, Kwadwo (b. June 3, 1952 - d. Sept. 24, 2008, Pretoria, South Africa), finance minister of Ghana (2005-08). He was also minister of local government and rural development (2001-03) and education, youth, and sports (2003-05).\n\nBaako, Kofi (b. April 1926, Saltpond, Gold Coast [now in Ghana] - d. Oct. 4, 1984, Accra, Ghana), defense minister of Ghana (1961-66). He was also minister of education (1959), information (1959-60), and parliamentary affairs (1960-61).\n\nBaal, Jan van (b. Nov. 25, 1909, Scheveningen, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands - d. Aug. 9, 1992, Doorn, Utrecht, Netherlands), governor of Netherlands New Guinea (1953-58). He was also known as an anthropologist.\n\nBaali, Abdallah (b. Oct. 19, 1954, Guelma, Algeria), Algerian diplomat. He was ambassador to Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, and Brunei (1992-96) and the United States (2008-15) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1996-2005). In 2019 he was appointed ambassador to France but did not take up the post.\n\nBaar-Baarenfels, Eduard (b. Nov. 3, 1885, Laibach, Austria [now Ljubljana, Slovenia] - d. March 14, 1967, Saalfelden, Salzburg, Austria), interior minister of Austria (1935-36).\n\nBaaro, Makurita (b. Feb. 17, 1957), Kiribati diplomat.

He played a vital role in suppressing the attempted coup of Feb. 13, 1976, when, unarmed, he walked into the rebel-held radio station. During the 30-month civil war he distinguished himself as an able frontline soldier. Babangida was generally credited with masterminding the coup that overthrew Pres. Alhaji Shehu Shagari at the end of 1983, and he supported Muhammadu Buhari as the new head of state. Under Buhari he was chief of army staff and a member of the SMC. Babangida took power in Nigeria's sixth military coup, on Aug. 27, 1985. He was a very different soldier from the austere and remote Buhari. Major General Babangida was a tough character, with a reputation for personal courage and decisiveness, who enjoyed the respect and loyalty of the soldiers who were the basis of his power. He made a virtual clean sweep of the old faces, retaining only six of Buhari's ministers. He told his new ministers that they had been selected on their merits and not for regional or tribal reasons and stated that he intended to run \"a government of action committed to a program with clear economic and social goals.\" He insisted that it had to be an open government; ministers did not know all the answers, and they should be ready to consult with others. He was also determined to defend human rights, and one of his first actions was to release political detainees. He was OAU chairman in 1991-92. He allowed presidential elections in 1993, but annulled the results. He stepped down and handed power over to a nonelected interim government.\n\nBabanov\n\nBabanov, Omurbek (Toktogulovich) (b.

March 5, 1965, Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous oblast, Azerbaijan S.S.R.), defense minister of Nagorno-Karabakh (1994-99). He rose to prominence during the military phase of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in 1991-94. He became commander of the Self-Defense Forces in 1993 and in this capacity co-signed the Moscow ceasefire agreement between Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh in May 1994. He additionally became defense minister in December 1994. With the region on a war footing, he had considerable power and autonomy, with little oversight from the civilian authorities. As long as Robert Kocharyan was in power in Karabakh, Babayan was under control, although he appeared to use his position to acquire land, enterprises, and tax and customs privileges for himself and his cronies. Once Kocharyan left to become prime minister of Armenia in March 1997, Babayan began to assert his influence over the civilian government in Stepanakert in a more overt fashion, again evidently abusing his office for personal aggrandizement. In 1998 he opposed Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who eventually resigned; and he also forced Karabakh prime minister Leonard Petrosyan to resign. Armenian leaders then joined forces to restrain his influence and he lost the defense portfolio and the commander position in 1999. After an assassination attempt on the Nagorno-Karabakh president Arkady Gukasyan in 2000, he was arrested and in 2001 found guilty of masterminding the attack and sentenced to 14 years in prison. After his early release in 2004, Babayan relocated to Yerevan, where he set up a political party that fared poorly in the 2007 Armenian parliamentary elections, and then emigrated to Russia in 2011. He returned to Armenia in May 2016, citing what he said was the increased risk of renewed war with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh and the neighboring regions that the separatists control.\n\nBabayan, Semyon (Amayakovich) (b. 1932, Baku, Azerbaijan S.S.R.), chairman of the Executive Committee of Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous oblast (1988-91).\n\nBabayev, Aloviddin (Ishanovich) (b.

He was one of the moving spirits behind the Austrian revolution of March 1848, became justice minister in a liberal government in July, but did not refuse to stay minister in the counterrevolutionary government of the following November. After the death of Felix Fürst zu Schwarzenberg in 1852, he became the most powerful man in Austria, in what was popularly known as the \"Bach era,\" as the officials whom he introduced into Hungary were dubbed the \"Bach Hussars.\" Though he was contemptuous of the old conservative aristocracy, the \"Bach system\" was one of absolutism, exercised through a centralist bureaucracy. Its efficiency and the real benefits which it brought to some classes and nationalities of the monarchy were obscured by the hatred aroused by its disregard for freedom and historic rights, the Hungarians being particularly restive; and Bach himself was bitterly attacked as an unscrupulous renegade from liberalism. Seeking support of the Catholic church, in 1855 he negotiated a concordat with the Vatican. He fell from power after the Austrian failure in the Italian war of 1859 and became ambassador to the Papal State (1859-67). He was made Freiherr (baron) in 1854.\n\nBach, Eduard Freiherr von (b.

Sept. 29, 1951, Santiago, Chile), president of Chile (2006-10, 2014-18). After the coup of 1973 that put Gen. Augusto Pinochet in power, her father, Gen. Alberto Bachelet, who was the head of the air forces during Salvador Allende's government, died in prison in March 1974, a victim of torture. In January 1975 she was herself, together with her mother, taken to the notorious Villa Grimaldi torture centre; they were set free less than a month later and went into exile, first to Australia and then (May 1975) to East Germany. In February 1979 she returned to Chile to do political underground work for the Socialist Party. After the restoration of democracy in 1990, she became health minister (2000-02) and defense minister (2002-04); her popularity skyrocketed as she pushed for a reconciliation between the country's civilians and the military. She was the successful candidate of the centre-left Concertación coalition in the December 2005-January 2006 presidential election, becoming the country's first female president. Although her approval rating plunged in 2007 to a low point of 35% as her government was hurt by discontent over the troubled implementation of a mass transit system for the capital Santiago, it started to rebound in 2008 as voters applauded the extensive social policies and able handling of the local economy amid the global financial crisis. Constitutionally barred from reelection after four years, she left office with 84% approval ratings. However, her huge personal popularity could not be transferred to the Concertación presidential candidate in the 2009-10 election, Eduardo Frei, and Chileans instead elected Sebastián Piñera, who lost to Bachelet in 2006, as the first right-wing president in 20 years. In September 2010 she was appointed head of the new UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. In 2013 she was again elected president in a landslide victory over right-wing candidate Evelyn Matthei. In 2018-22 she was UN high commissioner for human rights.\n\nBachinger, Franz (b.

July 10, 1867, Baden-Baden, Baden [Germany] - d. Nov. 6, 1929, Schloss Salem, Baden, Germany), chancellor of Germany (1918). The son of Prince Wilhelm of Baden (brother of Grand Duke Friedrich I), Max in 1907 became heir presumptive to the grand duchy because his cousin Grand Duke Friedrich II (d. 1928) had no children. Entering politics, he became president of the upper chamber of the Baden Diet in 1910. In the first years of World War I he devoted himself to the Red Cross and specialized in the care of prisoners of war. It was he who, in 1915, suggested the German-Russian prisoners of war conference. He was a moderating influence on the policy of the annexationists in Germany, but he was not consulted until Oct. 3, 1918, when Germany was on the verge of collapse and he was made chancellor of the empire and prime minister of Prussia in succession to Georg Hertling. He was appointed because his humanitarian reputation made the emperor Wilhelm II think him capable of bringing the war expeditiously to an end. He hastily superintended the constitutional changes whereby a genuine parliamentary system was at last brought into being in Germany, began negotiations for an armistice, and secured the dismissal of Army Chief of Staff Erich Ludendorff - but too late to save the monarchy. When Wilhelm II would give no definite answer to Max's demands that he should abdicate in the face of the danger of Communist revolution, Max finally himself announced the abdication of the emperor on Nov. 9, 1918. He then resigned the chancellery to the leader of the Majority Social Democratic Party, Friedrich Ebert. He was asked by Ebert to remain as regent, but refused.

In World War I he distinguished himself by directing the capture of Monte Sabotino (Aug. 6, 1916); later he conducted the armistice talks for the Italians. He was chief of the Italian general staff in 1919-21.

He was made a field marshal on May 26, 1926. From 1929 to 1933 he was governor of Tripolitania. He was placed in command of the Italian forces in Ethiopia on Nov. 15, 1935, conducted the operations against the poorly armed Ethiopians with ruthless competence, and in May 1936 he captured Addis Ababa, where he remained for a short time as viceroy. During 1940 he differed with Mussolini over Italy's preparations for entering World War II. On Dec. 4, 1940, in the midst of Italy's disastrous campaign in Greece, he resigned as chief of staff and disavowed responsibility for Mussolini's acts.

He left his headquarters and installed his government in al-Ta´if, Saudi Arabia, in 1967. The civil war ended in 1970; following the end of Saudi Arabia's support and its recognition of the republican government on July 23 that year he left Saudi Arabia and went into exile to England.\n\nBadr ibn Saud (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud) (b. 1935? - d.

He began his political career in 1843 by helping lead the revolt that established the independence of the Dominican Republic from Haiti, with which it shares the island of Hispaniola. At this time, Báez believed that his nation could maintain its independence only by becoming a French protectorate, and to secure that end he was sent to Europe in 1846; the French, however, were not interested. During his first term as president, Báez tried unsuccessfully to have his country annexed by the United States (1850). His second term ended when his government was overthrown by a coup d'état because of his involvement in corrupt financial transactions. He then invited Spain to occupy the Dominican Republic, and in return he was exiled to a comfortable life in Europe, financed by the Spaniards. When Spain abandoned the Dominican Republic in 1865, Báez returned to begin a third presidential term, but in May 1866 he was removed by another coup. In 1868 he was again made president, this time determined to gain annexation by the United States. He succeeded in persuading the United States to send warships, ostensibly to protect his country from Haiti; in reality he sought to protect his own business interests. But the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the annexation treaty, and in 1874 Báez again was forced to leave office. He served his last term in 1876-78 and was then exiled permanently to Puerto Rico.

He was the grandson of King Bodawphaya, who had narrowly avoided war with the British over the frontier between Bengal and Arakan. Bagyidaw was an ineffectual king, but his general, Maha Bandula, influenced him to follow Bodawphaya's policy of aggressive expansion in northeastern India. He conquered Assam and Manipur, making them tributaries. The border with British India thus extended from Arakan on the Bay of Bengal northward to the foot of the Himalayan Mountains. The British, angered over Awa border raids in pursuit of rebel forces, launched a war on March 5, 1824. Bagyidaw's armies were driven out of Assam, Arakan, and Manipur. British forces occupied southern Awa and advanced toward the capital, Amarapura (near present-day Mandalay). On Feb. 24, 1826, the Treaty of Yandabo was signed; it provided for the cession of Tenasserim and Arakan to the British, payment of an indemnity equivalent to £1,000,000, and renunciation of all Awa claims in Assam and Manipur, which became British protectorates. During the remaining years of his reign, he attempted to mitigate the harsh terms of the treaty. In 1826 he negotiated a commercial treaty with the British envoy, John Crawfurd, but refused to establish formal diplomatic relations unless he could deal on an equal basis with the British sovereign, rather than through the East India Company at Calcutta. He failed to persuade the British to return Tenasserim, but a deputation that he sent to Calcutta in 1830 successfully reasserted the Awa claim to the Kale-Kabaw Valley, which had been occupied by the Manipuris. After 1831 he became increasingly susceptible to attacks of mental instability, and in 1837 he was succeeded by his brother, Prince Tharawadi Min.\n\nBah, Abdallahi Ould (b. 1935, Boutilimit, Mauritania), defense minister of Mauritania (1975-77).

He took his first command appointment in February 1985 when he assumed the command of the HMFS Kikau. He was promoted temporary lieutenant commander in early 1986, and later that year served a tour with the Multi-National Forces and Observers in the Sinai. From 1988 to 1997 he held the post of commander, Fiji Naval Division, and in 1995 was promoted captain, which is equivalent to the military rank of a full colonel.

In May 2000 he took power as head of an Interim Military Government, ten days after rebels led by George Speight seized control of the parliament building and took the government hostage. In July he signed an agreement with Speight that ended the crisis. Speight was arrested and charged with treason. But just four months later, soldiers in the army who had stayed loyal to Speight staged a bloody mutiny at the army's barracks. Eight men were killed and Bainimarama fled for his life. In 2006 Bainimarama demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase because of the latter's support for a controversial bill that would offer amnesty to some of those involved in the 2000 coup. When Qarase refused, Bainimarama himself staged a coup to remove him. A month later (January 2007) he gave up the presidential powers he had taken and became interim prime minister.

In 2014 he handed over the reins of the military, formed the FijiFirst party, then ran for election under a new electoral system and won, as he did again in 2018 before being defeated in 2022.

He was also ambassador to the Netherlands (1975), Pakistan (1976-80), China (1980-82), and the United States (1984-86).\n\nBajpai, Rajendra Kumari (b. Feb. 8, 1925, Laluchak, Bhagalpur district, Bihar, India - d. July 17, 1999, Allahabad [now Prayagraj], Uttar Pradesh, India), Indian politician; granddaughter of Ravi Shankar Shukla; niece of Shyama Charan Shukla. She took part in the Quit India Movement in 1942 and was jailed for burning the union jack at the Zila Kutchery in Munger. She took the plunge into politics when she came into contact with Indira Gandhi immediately after the partition. Gandhi, who became the president of the Allahabad Congress Committee in 1956, chose her as her general secretary; thus began a political career spanning nearly four decades - first in Uttar Pradesh, the cradle of Indian politics, and then at the national level. She entered the U.P. assembly in 1962, became president of the U.P. Congress Committee during the early '70s and also served as a minister. Known for tremendous administrative and organizational capabilities, she streamlined the party and strengthened grass-roots level contacts in the state. When the Congress split in 1969, she took a clear line in favour of Gandhi and against the \"syndicate.\" She remained steadfast in her support of Gandhi till the latter's assassination. In January 1980, she was elected to the Lok Sabha from Sitapur after representing Allahabad in the state assembly thrice from 1962 to 1977. She was appointed general secretary of the All-India Congress Committee in the same year. She held the charge of organizing the party in the northeast, West Bengal, Assam, Gujarat, and Karnataka. Later, Gandhi inducted Bajpai into her cabinet as minister for welfare. An MP till 1990, she was appointed lieutenant governor of Pondicherry in 1995, a post she relinquished in 1998 when the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power at the Centre.\n\nBajuk\n\nBajuk, Andrej (b. Oct. 18, 1943, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia [now in Slovenia] - d. Aug. 15/16, 2011), prime minister of Slovenia (2000). Bajuk spent most of his life abroad. His family left Slovenia in 1945 after the Communists came to power in Yugoslavia at the end of World War II. He grew up in Argentina. In May 2000 Bajuk replaced Janez Drnovsek, who was premier of Slovenia's centre-left government for the past eight years but lost a confidence vote in parliament. In his programme, Bajuk emphasized preparations for European Union membership as his main task. Bajuk also planned to liberalize the economy by phasing out state intervention, abolishing monopolies, and trying to attract more foreign investment. In recent years, he had advised both the centre-right Social Democrats and the conservative Christian Democrats. He only joined the Christian Democrats in April 2000. He became deputy president of the newly established SLS+SKD Slovenian People's Party, which was formed by a merger of the People's Party and the Christian Democrats. SLS+SKD also formed an alliance with the Social Democrats, commanding the support of 44 out of 90 parliamentary seats. Bajuk was elected by 46 votes to 44; in two previous rounds of voting he failed to win enough support. His government soon broke down over whether to move away from the system of election by proportional representation, and new elections were won by a centre-left coalition led again by Drnovsek. In 2004-08 Bajuk was finance minister.\n\nBakala, Adrien (b. 1935, Mouyondzi, French Congo [now Congo (Brazzaville)] - d. March 27, 2015, Nice, France), Congo (Brazzaville) diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1969-70) and ambassador to Egypt (1971-73) and Italy (1973-75).\n\nBakalli, Mahmut (b. Jan. 19, 1936, Djakovica [Gjakovë], Banovina of Zeta, Yugoslavia [now in Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro] - d. April 14, 2006, Pristina, Kosovo), secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Kosovo (1971-81). He stepped down following disagreements with the central body of the Yugoslav Communist Party over the handling of unrest by ethnic Albanian students. During the Kosovo war in 1998-99, he was part of a five-man delegation that met with Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in a failed bid to end the conflict. Years later, he was the first witness to testify against Milosevic at his war crimes trial at the UN tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Bakalli was also part of the Kosovo Albanian delegation to the failed Rambouillet peace talks in France in 1999 and argued international mediation was needed before the negotiation process even started. When the talks in France failed, he talked of the importance behind NATO's coming to Kosovo, long before the bombings even began. He helped Ramush Haradinaj - a former rebel commander who became Kosovo's prime minister in 2005 and resigned after being indicted for war crimes by the UN tribunal - with organizing a political party, mostly because he believed people in Kosovo needed a third choice. At the time of his death, he was an adviser to Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Çeku.\n\nBakar, Zainal (b. Aug. 6, 1940, Pariaman, Netherlands East Indies [now in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia] - d. July 31, 2012, Padang, Sumatera Barat), governor of Sumatera Barat (2000-05).\n\nBakari\n\nBakari, Olushegun Adjadi, foreign minister of Benin (2023- ).\n\nBakaric\n\nBakaric, Vladimir (b. March 8, 1912, Velika Gorica, near Zagreb, Austria-Hungary - d. Jan. 16, 1983, Zagreb, Yugoslavia), Yugoslav politician. He was a member of the Communist Party from 1933. During World War II he helped organize partisan resistance in his native Croatia, and in 1945 he headed the first postwar government of the Croatian national republic within the Yugoslav federation. In 1971-72 he supported Tito's moves to suppress Croatian nationalism. A Marxist theoretician who was, nevertheless, strongly opposed to the Soviet system, Bakaric helped frame the 1974 federal constitution designed to promote decentralization. He was the last survivor of Marshal Tito's World War II compatriots to retain high office within the party hierarchy, being a member of the Presidium of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and vice-president of the federal republic's collective Presidency. Under the system of rotation of offices instituted by Tito, Bakaric would have succeeded Petar Stambolic as head of state in May 1983.\n\nBakary, Djibo (b. 1922, Soudouré, Niger - d. April 16, 1998, Niamey, Niger), Nigerien politician. A devoted socialist, he was a trade union leader until 1956 when he became the first elected mayor of the capital Niamey. The radical politician and nationalist campaigned for a \"No\" vote in a referendum for a French West African federation in 1958. His party, Sawaba (Hausa for independence), and the Democratic Party of Guinea under the late leader Ahmed Sékou Touré voted against the French federation, setting the stage for Guinea's acrimonious break with Paris. Bakary's party was in the minority in Niger, and he fled into exile after the \"Yes\" vote prevailed there. He launched a failed invasion against the independence government in 1964 with a band of commandos. He returned to Niger after the army seized power in 1974 but was arrested two years later and jailed for plotting. He was freed in 1987 after the death of military ruler Seyni Kountché.\n\nY.S. Bakary\n\nBakary, Yaou Sangaré (b. Nov. 7, 1964), foreign minister of Niger (2023- ).

March 8, 1965, Abidjan, Ivory Coast [now Côte d'Ivoire] - d. March 10, 2021, Freiburg, Germany), interior minister (2010-17), defense minister (2017-21), and prime minister (2020-21) of Côte d'Ivoire. He was also minister of new information technologies and telecommunications (2003-10) and mayor of Abobo (2018-21).\n\nBakayoko, Youssouf (b. April 19, 1943, Bouaké, Ivory Coast [now Côte d'Ivoire] - d. Sept. 30, 2023, France), foreign minister of Côte d'Ivoire (2006-10).\n\nB. Baker\n\nBaker, Barbara (Avalon) (b. 1958?), governor of Tasmania (2021- ).\n\nBaker, Charlie, byname of Charles Duane Baker (b. Nov. 13, 1956, Elmira, N.Y.), governor of Massachusetts (2015-23).\n\nBaker, Conrad (b. Feb. 12, 1817, Franklin county, Pa. - d.

March 28, 1913), lieutenant governor of Bengal (1908-11); knighted 1908.\n\nBaker, Francis (Eustace), byname Dick Baker (b. April 19, 1933 - d. Dec. 16, 2023), governor of Saint Helena (1984-88).\n\nBaker, Howard (Henry, Jr.) (b. Nov. 15, 1925, Huntsville, Tenn. - d. June 26, 2014, Huntsville), U.S. politician; posthumous son-in-law of Alfred M. Landon. His staunchly Republican family included a grandmother who was a sheriff and a father who would serve in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1951 to 1964. He served in the Navy during World War II. In 1964, campaigning in Tennessee against foreign aid and the Civil Rights Act, Baker lost his first try for a U.S. Senate seat. Running again in 1966, he moderated his politics and became the first popularly elected Republican U.S. senator in the state's history. Representing Tennessee in the Senate from 1967 to 1985, he became effective in Washington with his pragmatism and moderate politics. As minority leader from 1977 to 1981, Baker fought for some of Pres. Jimmy Carter's policies, most notably the Democrat's Panama Canal treaties. Baker's support for that issue enraged Republican conservatives, some of whom were still angry with him for his sharp and persistent questioning of aides of Pres. Richard Nixon during the Watergate hearings in 1973. A reputation for statesmanship was not enough to win Baker the White House, however. One of nine candidates for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, he dropped out after gaining only nine delegates in four months of campaigning. Four years earlier the party had rebuffed his bid to be Pres. Gerald Ford's running mate. In each case the Republican right wing helped ensure Baker's defeat. As Senate majority leader in 1981-85, he united the warring wings of his party behind Pres. Ronald Reagan's tax and budget agenda. He declined to run for reelection in 1984 but in 1987 became Reagan's chief of staff during the investigation of the Iran-contra affair. Baker resigned that office in mid-1988.\n\nJ. Baker\n\nBaker, James (Addison, III) (b. April 28, 1930, Houston, Texas), U.S. secretary of state (1989-92). Originally a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party and ran his longtime friend George Bush's campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1970. Though Bush lost the race, Baker became deeply involved in Republican politics thereafter. He was named undersecretary of commerce by Pres. Gerald Ford in 1975 and that same year helped Ford secure the Republican presidential nomination for the 1976 election. Baker joined Ford's reelection campaign that year and in August became national chairman of the Ford campaign. Despite Ford's loss in the election, Baker earned a reputation as a campaign tactician of uncommon ability. In 1978 Baker ran for the office of state attorney general in Texas but lost. From January 1979 to May 1980 he was Bush's campaign chairman for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination. After Bush accepted the vice presidential slot on a ticket headed by Ronald Reagan that year, Baker joined Reagan's campaign staff as a senior adviser. Under Reagan he served as White House chief of staff (January 1981-January 1985) and secretary of the Treasury (February 1985-August 1988). Baker adroitly managed Bush's successful campaign for the presidential election of November 1988 and in the same month was nominated secretary of state. He was confirmed by the Senate on Jan. 25, 1989, and sworn in on January 27. In that post Baker helped the U.S. reach agreement with the Soviet Union on the reunification of Germany, and helped orchestrate the international coalition that opposed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He resigned in 1992 in order to serve as White House chief of staff while simultaneously directing Bush's (unsuccessful) reelection campaign. In 1997-2004 he was UN mediator in the Western Sahara conflict.\n\nBaker, Joshua (b. March 23, 1799, Mason county, Ky. - d. April 16, 1885, Lynne, Conn.), military governor of Louisiana (1868).\n\nBaker, Nathaniel B(radley) (b. Sept. 29, 1818, Henniker, N.H. - d.

Sept. 16, 1933, Jefferson City, Mo.), governor of Missouri (1925-29).\n\nBaker, Shirley Waldemar (b. 1836, London, England - d. Nov. 30, 1903, Ha'apai, Tonga), prime minister of Tonga (1881-90).\n\nBaker, Terry, New Zealand representative in Niue (1979-82). He was also ambassador to the Philippines (2001-04).\n\nBaker, William R(obinson) (b. May 21, 1820, Baldwinsville, N.Y. - d. April 30, 1890), mayor of Houston (1880-86); nephew-in-law of Hiram G. Runnels.\n\nBaker of Dorking (of Iford in the County of East Sussex), Kenneth (Wilfred) Baker, Baron (b. Nov. 3, 1934, Newport, Monmouth, Wales), British politician. He won election to the House of Commons at a by-election in 1968. He lost his seat (Acton, in West London) in 1970 but was almost immediately adopted to defend a large Conservative majority at Marylebone, in central London. His close association with Edward Heath, then prime minister, culminated in his becoming Heath's political private secretary in 1974. When Heath was deposed as leader of the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher (1975), Baker was not - as Thatcher would say - \"one of us,\" and he was voted out of the Conservative leadership by the party MPs. Excluded from her first government, he wrote her a letter urging the importance of information technology, with the result that, in January 1981, she made him responsible for it as minister, a high-profile post that gave him the chance to promote the wider use of electronic and computer technology in schools and industry. In September 1984 he was appointed minister for local government. He carried through the abolition of the Greater London Council (GLC) in the face of an inspired, and expensive, antiabolition publicity campaign conducted by GLC Labour leader Ken Livingstone, as well as resistance from the House of Lords. He came into the cabinet as secretary of state for the environment in September 1985. In May 1986 he was promoted to secretary of state for education and science. In 1988 he accomplished another signal achievement for Thatcher when he piloted a radical Education Reform Bill onto the statute book. As a result of his achievements, he came to be seen as a possible successor to Thatcher, although the right-wingers regarded him as ideologically shallow. In 1989-90 he was chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and chairman of the Conservative Party and in 1990-92 home secretary. He was created a life peer in 1997.\n\nBakevyumusaya, Vénérand, foreign minister of Burundi (1995-96). He was also minister of labour and professional training (1994-95), regional integration and African affairs (2007-09), and information, communication, and relations with parliament (2009-10) and ambassador to France (1998-2001).\n\nBakhit\n\nBakhtadze\n\nBakhit, Marouf (Suleiman) al-, Arabic Ma`ruf Sulayman al-Bakhit (b.

Aug. 29, 1928, Paris, France), Russian diplomat; son-in-law of Edward Fitzgerald Beale. He was diplomatic agent in Bulgaria (1897-1905) and ambassador to Japan (1905-08) and the United States (1911-17).\n\nBakhsh, Pir Illahi (d. Oct. 8, 1975), chief minister of Sindh (1948-49).\n\nBakht, Sikander (b. Aug. 24, 1918, Delhi, India - d. Feb. 23, 2004, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India), foreign minister of India (1996) and governor of Kerala (2002-04). He was also Indian minister of works, housing, supply, and rehabilitation (1977-79) and of industry (1998-99).\n\nBakhtadze, Mamuka (b. June 9, 1982, Tbilisi, Georgian S.S.R.), finance minister (2017-18) and prime minister (2018-19) of Georgia.\n\nBakhtiar\n\nBakhtiar, Shahpur (b. June 26, 1914, Isfahan, Iran - d. Aug. 6, 1991, Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, France), prime minister of Iran (1979). He went to Spain during the Civil War and fought with the Loyalists against Franco's forces. During World War II he helped the French resistance against the Nazi occupation. After the war he returned to Iran, where he became a leading figure in the nationalist struggle led by Mohammad Mossadegh's National Front. He served as deputy labour minister in Mossadegh's short-lived (1951-53) government. While Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was married to Soraya Esfandiari, a cousin of Bakhtiar, he tried to persuade him to take a high post. Bakhtiar refused and was jailed several times for his opposition to the shah's autocratic rule. On Jan. 4, 1979, the shah, seeking to forestall a fundamentalist revolution, named him prime minister. Bakhtiar accepted the position only on condition that the shah leave the country. He tried to implement moderate reforms, but was unable to resist the revolutionary Islamic fundamentalist forces under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The return of Khomeini to Iran from exile in France on February 1 brought a quick end to Bakhtiar's government. He went into hiding, and turned up in July in France. He established the National Movement of the Iranian Resistance with headquarters in Paris and branches in other countries, along with its own newspapers and two clandestine radio stations beaming his messages into Iran. Over the years, as his return to Tehran seemed ever more remote, his goals continually shifted, with his political allies ranging from leftists to constitutional monarchists. Bakhtiar, who had escaped at least two previous assassination attempts, was found stabbed to death in his home.\n\nBakhtin, Ivan (Ivanovich) (b. 1754 - d. April 26 [April 14, O.S.], 1818, St. Petersburg, Russia), governor of Sloboda Ukraine (1803-14).\n\nBakhtin, Nikolay (Ivanovich) (b. Jan. 14 [Jan. 3, O.S.], 1796, Tula, Russia - d.

He was also minister of religious affairs (1979-80, 1986-89).\n\nBaki, Ivonne (Leila Juez Abuchacra de Abdel-) (b. Feb. 23, 1951, Guayaquil, Ecuador), Ecuadorian politician. She has been ambassador to the United States (1999-2002, 2020-24), Qatar (2017-20), and France (2024- ), a minor presidential candidate (2002), minister of foreign trade (2003-05), and president of the Andean Parliament (2007-09).\n\nBakiboyev, Erkin (Zhurayevich) (b. Oct. 27, 1934, Tashkent, Uzbek S.S.R.), finance minister of Uzbekistan (1991-94).\n\nBakiyev, Khuram (b. 1898, Langari, Bukhara [now in Uzbekistan?] - d. 1938), president of the Pamir Bureau of the Communist Party (1929?-30) and chairman of the Executive Committee (1928-30) and executive/first secretary of the Communist Party committee (1930-37) of Gorny Badakhshan.\n\nK. (S.) Bakiyev\n\nBakiyev, Kurmanbek (Saliyevich) (b. Aug. 1, 1949, Masadan village, Suzak region, Dzhalal-Abad oblast, Kirgiz S.S.R.), prime minister (2000-02, 2005) and president (2005-10) of Kyrgyzstan. He was governor of Chuy oblast in 1997-2000. During his first term as prime minister, he stuck to tough fiscal rules for dealing with the country's large debt burden. Under his leadership, the U.S. Air Force was allowed to establish a base near the capital Bishkek, and former opposition leader Feliks Kulov was imprisoned for abuse of power and theft. His government cracked down on demonstrators, with his interior minister saying that riots that broke out in Bakiyev's home region in the south in March 2002 were an attempt to overthrow the government. Police fired into the crowd of 1,500 protesting the arrest of their local parliamentary deputy in Jalal-Abad, and five people died. An investigation found senior officials responsible for the tragedy, and Bakiyev was forced to resign. Bakiyev moved over to the opposition after his resignation, becoming leader of the People's Movement of Kyrgyzstan. The 2005 parliamentary elections, in which he lost his seat in the March runoff, sparked protests about alleged rigging. As head of the Coordination Council of the People's Unity, he was a leading figure in the revolution that quickly ended Pres. Askar Akayev's rule, and was then appointed prime minister and acting president. In July he won a landslide victory in presidential elections. He came to be criticized for suppressing dissent, however, and the conduct of the 2009 election, which he won with 76% of the vote, was not seen as fair by observers. In 2010 he met a similar fate as Akayev, when protests forced him to flee the capital, a provisional government took power, and he finally agreed to resign.
