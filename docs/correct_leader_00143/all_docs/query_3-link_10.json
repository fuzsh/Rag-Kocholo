        "text": "Aden, NewsYemen, Exclusive:\n\nMartyr Suhail Awad (formerly Hujaif) facility belonging to the oil company branch in Aden has resumed its oil work in pumping and filling fuel in conjunction with the start of its rehabilitation project, which laid the foundation stone for it, Thursday, the governor of the capital Aden, Ahmed Hamed Lamlas.\n\nThe return of this vital oil facility to work represents a practical confirmation of the seriousness of the local leadership of the local authority in Aden, which seeks to lift the city from its current deteriorating situation and rehabilitate all vital and economic sectors in it, including the oil sector.\n\nThe return of this facility to work again was not an easy matter. Rather, it came after a long struggle that spanned for nearly five years between the oil company and the investor Tawfiq Abdul Rahim, who rented the facility to develop, rehabilitate and activate its services, but after years of signing the lease contract and announcing it to stores for oil derivatives for which he was responsible for transported between provinces.\n\nThe struggle to restore the facility from the control of the port, the oil company assigned Hayat, the director of the station management, the martyr, Suhail Awad Al-Awlaqi, who died on April 2, 2013, by the facility guards, who follow the influential businessman, Muhammad Tawfiq Abdulrahim, during his descent to restore the facility by a court order.\n\nIn late October 2016, the former governor of Aden, Major General Aidaroos Al-Zubaidi, head of the Southern Transitional Council, was able to restore the facility and hand it over to the oil company, announcing the start of the phase of restoring southern institutions and properties that were leased at low prices after signing the unity agreement in 1990.\n\nThe facility of the martyr Suhail Awad, located in the Hujaif region between the districts of Al-Mualla and Al-Tawahi, was established in 1920 and consists of two parts, the first of which is to supply ships and vessels with fuel, oil and water, and the second was used as a maintenance workshop belonging to the technical department and the depots department, and it was considered the largest oil economic facility in the region at that time.\n\nThe total area of the facility ranges between 800 - 900 meters in length and 200 - 300 meters in width, followed by a small berth in which the boats that participate in supplying ships dock, and it is one of the assets of the Yemeni Oil Company and one of the most important oil installations in Yemen.\n\nIn 1974, the first part of the facility was leased to the Yemeni Kuwaiti Company, which stopped its activities after the Gulf War in 1990, before it was leased to the investor Tawfiq Abdul Rahim in 2003 at a low price based on a decision issued by the then Prime Minister Abdul Qadir Bajamal, and at an annual rent of $ 400,000.\n\nIn the year 2013, the lease contract expired, but Abdul Rahim Group of Companies refused to hand over the facility, which did not witness any development or modernization work, contrary to the contract between the government and the commercial group, which brought in a group of armed men to prevent any attempts to restore the facility by force despite the issuance of a court decision in this regard.\n\nThe governor of Aden, after laying the foundation stone for the rehabilitation of the facility and the opening of the lanes, stressed the importance of completing the project within the framework of joint action to advance Aden and restore its pioneering role in Yemen and the region.\n\nSouthern political activist Ahmed Al-Rabezi commented on this event by saying, “President Aidaroos Al-Zubaidi restored it to state ownership in 2016, when he was governor of the capital Aden.\n\nHe added, \"The martyr Suhail Al-Awlaqi oil facility\" Hujaif\"returns today to resume pumping and filling operations of oil derivatives again."
