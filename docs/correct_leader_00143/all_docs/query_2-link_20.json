        "text": "Ali Abdullah Saleh al-Ahmar (Arabic: علي عبدالله صالح الأحمرⓘ, ʿAlī ʿAbdullāh Ṣāliḥ al-Aḥmar; 21 March 1947[4][5][note 1] – 4 December 2017) was a Yemeni politician who served as the first President of the Republic of Yemen, from Yemeni unification on 22 May 1990, to his resignation on 27 February 2012, following the Yemeni revolution.[6] Previously, he had served as President of the Yemen Arab Republic, or North Yemen, from July 1978, to 22 May 1990, after the assassination of President Ahmad al-Ghashmi.[7] al-Ghashmi had earlier appointed Saleh as military governor in Taiz.[8]\n\nQuick Facts Field Marshal, President of Yemen ...\n\nClose\n\nSaleh developed deeper ties with Western powers, especially the United States, during the War on Terror. Islamic terrorism may have been used and encouraged by Ali Abdullah Saleh in order to win Western support and for disruptive politically motivated attacks.[9][10] In 2011, in the wake of the Arab Spring, which spread across North Africa and the Middle East (including Yemen), Saleh's time in office became increasingly precarious, until he was eventually ousted as President in 2012. He was succeeded by Abdrabbuh Mansur al-Hadi, who had been serving as vice president since 1994, and acting president since 2011.[11]\n\nIn May 2015, Saleh openly allied with the Houthis (Ansar Allah) during the Yemeni Civil War,[12] in which a protest movement and subsequent insurgency succeeded in capturing Yemen's capital, Sanaa, causing President al-Hadi to resign and flee the country. In December 2017, he declared his withdrawal from his coalition with the Houthis and instead sided with his former enemies – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and President al-Hadi.[13]"
