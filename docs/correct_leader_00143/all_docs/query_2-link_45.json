The Jammuwal Rajputs have been settled for many centuries in the mountain tract west of the Ravi, and they claim to have come from Chitor before the commencement of the Christian era. Brij Dhar, son of the Maharaja Man of Chitor, is said to have originally founded the colony. Jammu proper was a much smaller tract than the .area now embraced within the State of that name, even excluding Kashmir and the hills to the north and west. The independent chief ships of Rajauri, Jasrota, Mankot, Ramnagar, Basoli, Budhu, Kishtwar, War, Bhimbar and others, absorbed later on by Maharaja Gulab Singh, formed no part of Jit Singh’s possessions. Raja Ranjit Deo was in the latter part of the 18th century the best known of the Jammuwals. It was he who had to bear the brunt of the Sikh attack in the early days of the Khalsa, and he suffered severely at their hands. In 1773 he was on bad terms with his eldest son, Brij Raj Deo, and he attempted to set him aside by nominating a younger son, Dalel Singh, as his successor. This step was naturally distasteful to Brij Raj, who made a practical protest by calling in to his aid the Kanhaya Sardars, Jai Singh and Hakikat Singh, and Charat Singh Sukarchakia, grandfather of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The history of the struggle which followed has been given at length in another chapter.* In one of the battles Sardar Charat Singh was killed by the bursting of his own matchlock. The Jammuwals ultimately succumbed to Hakikat Singh, who levied an annual tribute of Rs. 20,000. Raja Brij Raj met with his death in a battle between the Bhangi and the Kanhaya Sardars near Sialkot in 1798. The chiefship passed to Jit Singh, son of his younger brother, Dalel Singh. He was deposed in 1816 by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, and he and his children were driven to seek refuge in British territory* Jammu was afterwards bestowed upon Raja Gulab Singh of the junior branch. In 1844 Jit Singh’s son, Raghbir Deo, returned to the Punjab and set up a claim to the old estates. But the. moment was not propitious, for Raja Gulab Singh, who represented the younger branch of the Jammuwals, was then all-powerful at Lahore, and Raghbir had to rest satisfied with the award of a jagir of the value of Rs. 12,000 at Akhrota, near Dinanagar in the Gurdaspur district, where his descend- ants now reside. This allowance was made subject to the usual con- dition of maintaining horse and foot for service. The patrimony, with Kashmir and aU its dependencies, passed in 1846 under treaty with British Government to Maharaja Gulab Singh. Raja Raghbir ^Vide tlie Kanhaya hsimily. GUBDASPUE DISTBICT. 8 Dec’s jagir was recognised and* continued to iiim by tbe Britisb Grorern- juent, after deducting tbe grant made for tbe entertainment of fighting men whose services were no longer required. Afterwards, at bis own request, in 1852, owing to tbe difficulty be experienced in managing liis property, tbe Eaja surrendered a portion of tbe jagir, yielding Es. 3,742, taking an equivalent in tbe form of a cash pension, tbe re- maining jagir land being assessed at Es. 679 per annum. This pension and jagir were made perpetual to bis heirs male under orders passed in 1867. He was succeeded in the following year by bis only son, Jndar Deo. Eaja Indar Deo was tbe senior Darbari of tbe Gurdaspur district. His affairs were at one time considerably involved, necessitating tbe g]'ant to him of a Government loan. He was President of tbe Dina- nagar municipality and received a khilat and a mnad from Government in recognition of bis services. He died in 1895 and was succeeded by bis son, Tikka Partab Deo, then at tbe Aitcbison College. Partab Deo died, unmarried, in 1898, and bis brother, Sant Singh, who was educated at tbe Aitcbison College, became tbe bead of tbe family. In 1904 tbe Government recognised bis hereditary title of Eaja and in 1905 be was made an Honorary Magistrate and Civil Judge in bis district. He was a provincial Darbari and bad been accepted by Govern- ment as a candidate for tbe post of Extra Assistant Commissioner. During tbe Great War Eaja Sant Singh helped Government with both men and money, and in appreciation of bis services received several certificates. He died in 1925. Tbe beadisbip of tbe family now devolved upon bis brother, Bilbbaddar Singh, who was made a Eaja by Govern- ment. He was also granted five squares of land in tbe Montgomery dis- trict. ' This family is tbe premier family in tbe Gurdaspur district, and lOtb in tbe whole of tbe Punjab.

The family of Bhagowala, of the Kahilon Jat caste, claims to have descended from the Pawar Rajputs of TJjain. An ancestor of the name of Kahilon was the founder of the Jat family of that name, and Bhago, the eleventh from Kahilon, emigrated to the Punjab and built the village of Bhagowala near Batala in the Gurdaspur district, from which the present family takes its name. Earn Singh, the father of Sardar Mihan Singh, was a follower of Sardar Bhag Singh Bhaga, who in 1795 gave him the two villages, Bhugadh and Khatab. After the death of Bhag Singh, Ram Singh served with bis brother, Sardar Budh Singh Bhaga. In 1809 Ran jit Singh took possession of the greateo* part of the Bhaga territory, and, among other places, of Bhagowala, which he grant- ed to Sardar Desa Singh Majithia. Ram Singh accompanied the Maharaja GUBDASPUB DISTBICT. 5 to Kangra in 1809 in the force of Sardar Desa Singh, and in the first battle with the Gurkhas he was killed. His son, Mihan Singh, was then a minor ; but Desa Singh did not forget him, and when he was able to bear arms, released in his favour some wells at Bhagowala, and placed him under his son, Sardar Lehna Singh. When this chief was made governor of the hill districts, an assignment of Hs. 2,200 per annum was made to Mihan Singh from the tribute of Mandi, Kulu, Suket, Kangra, Bilaspur and I^adaun. He accompanied Lehna Singh -and Jamadar Khushhal Singh on the expedition against Chauki Kotlehr in 1825, and his old friendship with the Haja of that State had its effect in inducing him to surrender the fort, which was a strong one, and to accept a jagir which the Jamadar pledged himself to obtain for him. After the death of Desa Singh Majithia in 1832, his son confirmed Mihan Singh in his jagir, and left him as Thanadar at Amritsar during his own absence in the Peshawar campaign. He also granted him an additional cash pension of Es. 1,200 and jdgirs of Es. 1,550. Gulab Singh, son of Mihan Singh, entered the force of Lehna Singh Majithia as a gunner in 1828, and was made a commandant in 1835. Tip to the death of Maharaja Eanjit Singh the Bhagowala chiefs had been merely feudal retainers of the Majithia Sardars, but on the accession of Maharaja Sher Singh, Gulab Singh entered the regular army, and was made a colonel of artillery, ^ith command of eleven guns, with a cash salary and jagivs of Es. 2,116. Tinder Eaja Hira Singh he was made a General, and his pa^^ was raised to Es. 3,458, being Es. 1,000 in cash and the villages of Hharabad and Luhaika, yielding Es. 2,4o8 per annum. Tinder Jawahir Singh his pay remained the same, but he was in command of twelve guns. When Sardar Lehna Singh Majithia redred from the Punjab before the Second Sikh War, Gulab Singh wished to accompany him, but he was not permitted, and was appointed Magistrate of Gugera, where he was stationed when the Multan war broke out. At that crisis he remained faithful to Government. In 1853 Gulab Singh left the Punjab with Sardar Lehna Singh Majithia to make a pilgrimage to Benares and other holy cities. He returned home on the death of his friend in the following year. In 1863 he was appointed guardian of Sardar Lehna Singh^s only son, Dayal Singh. He had previously been in charge of the minor Eur Singh, son of Sardar Jassa Singh of Haushera Nangal, Amritsar. He was also for seme years guardian of Sardar Bakhshish Singh, adopted son of Sardar Shamsher Singh Sindhanwalia of Eaja Sansi and he acted for a ^hort period as manager of the Darbar Sahib at Amritsar. On the death of his father, Sardar Mihan Singh, Honorary Magistrate, in 1870, the family jagir, valued at Es. 3,000, was resumed. Subsequently, however. 6 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. in 1877, one half was released to Sardar Grulab Singh in recognition of his many loyal and nsefnl services* The Sardar died in 1832, He was succeeded by his son, Sardar Richpal Singh, who commenced service as Naib«Tahsildar in 1870 and was appointed Munsif in 1875. He resigned this post a few years later and till his death in 1908 resided entirely at Bhagowala. He received a grant of 10 squares of land in the Lyallpur district and purchased the village of Kheri Manian in the Patiala State. Sardar Gopal Singh remains, since the former’s death in 1908, the head of the family. He is the chief Lamhardar of Bhagowala. He has had a very distinguished and varied career. He joined the army in the eighties of the last century when Lord Eoberts sent him to the 7th Princess Eoyal Dragoon Guards, and he was attached to that regiment for some time. In 1910 he was a Eessaidar in the XI K. E. 0. Lancers. Two years later he served as second-in-command to Col. Anderson during the Tl aziri blockade. Earlier he had taken part in several important manoeuvres. He retired from the army in 1913 owing to illness, but on the outbreak of the War he was the first in his district to volunteer his sejvices, surrendering also his pension through the commanding officer of his regiment. He remained on active service for three years and had to return to India in 1917 through an acute illness from pyorrhea. He V as then employed as Assistant Eecruiting Officer of his district which post he continued to fill honorarily until the Armistice, During his period Sardar Gopal Singh raised a double Sikh Company for the 2/76 Punjabis from Gurdaspur and later had occasion to settle a serious trouble which broke out in that company at Jubbulpore. Among his other services in connection with the TTar, was his successfully raising half the price of an aeroplane from his own district, the Kangra district, s^^PPbdng the other half of the price and the Government naming' the machine as Gurdaspur-Kangra Plane. He was the President of the second Indian Imperial Eelief Fund for which he raised Es. 76,000. Likewise he acted either as chairman or as secretary or, at least, as an active promoter of various other funds to which he contributed sub- stantial sums of money from his own pocket. Sardar Gopal Singh was a nominated member of the Punjab Legiala^ five Council in the days before the reforms and continued as such even after 1920. He was asked to give evidence before several committees,. Eowlatt, Esher and Hunter Committees and the Lee Commission!^ In recognition of his War services he was awarded a gold watch with an inscription, mentioning the special services rendered by Hm during 1914-16, engraved on it. He was also made an Honorary Captain. GUBDA8PUB DISTBICT. 7 He receiTed t^ro sanads, one from tlie Government of India and tlie other from the Pun j ah Government and also received from the latter 8 squares of land in the Montgomery district. During the Martial Law troubles in this province he was a member of the Punjab Publicity Board andi bis work in that connection was appreciated by the grant of another sanad, Por a time he served as honorary secretary of the Khalsa College, Amritsar. His adopted son, Gurbachan Singh, was educated at Sandhurst from where he obtained a Commission in 1926. He was attached to 4 /7th Dragoon Guards and later to 7th Light Cavalry. He has recently been promoted to the rank of a captain. Bishan Singh, the uncle of Sardar Gopal Singh, was at one time a Naib-Tahsildar, who resigned on account of his ill-health. He died in 1904. His property amounting to 300 acres of land was inherited by his sons, of whom the younger, Shamsher Singh, has been employed in the Punjab Police. Sardar Labh Singh — grandson of Sardar Khazan Singh who died in 18GS — is a Deputy Director of Agriculture in the Punjab. In 1910 the family owned about 850 acres of land, in five villages in Gurdaspur, a small tea garden at Gajian in Kangra and enjoyed a joint muafi of 200 acres in Bhagowala, Gurdaspur. The muafis and jagirs^ yielded about Es. 3,G7G per annum. 6 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. SARDAR HARI SINGH OF RANGAR NANGAL BAN DEV. Natha Singh. Sardar JBalwant Singh (died 1908).

Ihis family came originally from Bikaner in Bajputana, and settled in the fertile district of Gurdaspur, where, near the city of Batala, they founded the viBage of Eangar Nangal. ‘ Eangar ’ is the name of the Bajput got or clan to which Eaja Jagat, the founder of the family, he- longed, and Nangal is a euphonic corruption of the Sanskrit word Mangal, pleasing , signifying that the emigrants were satisfied that after their many wanderings their lines had faUen in pleasant places. _ Many years later, Natha, the son of Eandeo, became a Sikh, and, joinmg the Eanhaya confederacy under Jai Singh, ravaged all the countrC around Eangar Nangal, where he built a strong fort. His son, Earam bmgh, succeeded hm, and very much increased both the power and nos- sessions of the family. He rebuilt and strengthened the Eangar Hangal GUBDASPUB DISTBICT. fort, and took up kis residence in Amritsar, where lie built the Katra -Earam Singh, otherwise known as Katra Rangar Nanglia. When I? an jit Singh became powerful and seized Lahore and Amritsar, Karam Singh gave in his allegiance, and ever after remained a faithful servant of the Maharaja. On one occasion, indeed, they quarrelled. Karam Singh was Captain of Eanjit Singh’s irregulars, and as in these early da^^^s the chief had not much money to spare, the pay of the troops fell into arrears. Karam Singh took their side and demanded their pay of lianjit Singh, who, fearing an outbreak, was compelled to pawn the jewels of his wife, Mehtab Kaur. The Maharaja afterwards punished Karam Singh for thus taking part against him, by plundering and destroying his house in Amritsar. But a reconciliation took place and the Sardar accompanied Eanjit Singh on most of his expeditions ; and in the Peshawar campaign, where he was severely wounded, he specially distinguished himself, and received for his services a new jagir in the Jullundur Doab. BTe possessed at one time territory to the amount of several lakhs of rupees, principally situated in the Gurdaspur district. He was succeeded by his son, J amiat Singh, who had been for long with the army, and who was favourably known to Ranjit Singh for his bravery. His younger brother, Wazir Singh, with his cousin, Ram Singh, received a jagir in Bhimbar in 1821. Jamiat Singh was, with his cousin, Ram Singh, killed in Hazara at the battle of Darband in 1820, and on his death the jagirs were reduced hj more than one-half. Arjun Singh was slill, however, a powerful Sardar, and remained in favour so long as Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Kao Kihal Singh were alive; but on the accession of Slier vSingh his jagirs were again reduced, -and there were only left to him Rs. 28,000, of which Rs. 15,000 were liersonal and Rs. 13,000 subject to the service of thirty horsemen. Arjun Singh’s mother was maternal aunt of Rani Chand Kaur, the widow of Kharak Singh and mother of Kao Kihal Singh, and in this relationship wdll be found the cause of Maharaja Sher Singh’s enmity. In 1845, previous to the Sutlej campaign, Arjun Singh received from Raja Lai Singh, command of four infantry regiments, one regiment of cavalry, and a troop of horse artillery, and with this force he served at the battle of Sobraon. In 1846 he served with credit in the Kashmir expedition, and in August, 1847, received a Persian title of honour on tlie recommendation of Major Lawrence, the Resident at Lahore. In ltS48 he accompanied Raja Sher Singh Atariwala to Multan, and joined in his rebellion. His adherents, hearing of the Sardar’s disaffection, proceeded to follow his example, and defended the fort of Rangar Kangal successfully against two companies of the Darbar troops which had been 10 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. sent to attack tke property; but Brigadier Wbeeler marcbed against it on tbe 16tb October and speedily reduced it. On tbe termination of tbe • 5 rar tbe -n-bole estate of Arjun Singb was confiscated; and tbe Earjgar Nangal jagir was conferred on Sardar Mangal Singb Eamgarbia, wbo bad displayed much energy in tbe capture of Hari Singb, a notorious free-booter, wbo bad during tbe war kept tbe neighbourhood of Batala iu a state of alarm. Arjun Singh received a pension of Es. 1,500; but it was personal, and ceased at Ms death in 1859. At the request of Eaja Bhagwan Singh of Nabha, a second cousin of Sardar Balwant Singh by marriage, the British Government gave a pension of Es. 120 a year to each of the two widows of Arjun Singh. The family also received help from Nabha. Sardar Arjun Singh left two sons, the elder Sardar Balwant Singh wag a Provincial Darbari and a Zaildar. He died in 1908, and left t'wo sons, Hari Singh and Narain Singh. Both of them were kept under the Court of Wards and educated at the Aitchison College, They paid Es. 10,000 as War Loan in the Great War, and the elder received 8 squares of land in the Multan district and the younger 5 squares in the Montgomery district. Hari Singh was appointed as Provincial Darbari in 1930 and was already a Lambardar in his native village and in Amritsar. Naiain Singh is an Aide-de-Camp to His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala and holds the rank of Captain. The brothers sub- scribed substantial sums of money to the Jubilee and the Quetta Eelief funds. Sardar Dalip Singh, son of Sardar Sant Singh, and a member of a junior branch of the family was appointed as Daffadar in the 35th Sindh Horse in 1910. On the outbreak of the War he was sent to France and later in 1915 fought at Arras (France) with the 36th Jacob’s Plorse and was wounded. He was in the trenches at Tpres (Belgium) during the German attack with poison gas and remained unconscious for 24 hours from its effects. In 1916, while the way was being cleared for a cavalry advance, he, with the British section of the Eoyal Engineering Company, displayed a singular devotion to duty in the face of terrible fire from the German artillery, and w’as wounded. For his gallant behaviour on this, occasion he was awarded the Indian Distinguished Service Medal. In 1917 when the Cavalry Division made an advance on the Hindenburg line, the 36th Jacob’s Horse formed its advanced position. Jamadar Dalip Singh was now put on a most hazardous duty of keeping in close touch with the retreating Germans and to report their movements. At one moment, as he proceeded ahead alone, he was surrounded by a German picket that lay in ambush. The Germans called upon him to surrender, but the Jamadar opened fire instead, managing single handed GUBDASPUB DISTBICT. 11 to dash through them. But he was far from safety yet, for he fell iu the way of another German party, one of whom advanced to seize the reins of his horse. The J amadar, however, shot him dead with his pistol and spurred his horse on. Ee had hardly gone a few paces when a bullet struck him on the head and pierced his left eye. This was the fourth wound which he received in the field of battle and it permanently deprived him of his left eye. Sardar Dalip Singh was awarded, in addition to the Indian Distinguished Service Medal, various other medals, including those of 1914 and 1915, the General Service Medal, the Tictory and the Mesopotamia medals. On return to India in 1917 he was selected for the Eng’s Commission and sent to the Indore Cadet College for training but he soon developed trouble in Ms right eye and on medical examination was found unfit to carry on with his training and was sent back to his regiment. In 1919 he was made a Eessiadar. Eis regiment, the 35th Sindh Eorse, was then sent to Mesopotamia for garrison duty and he was ordered to Join the same. While there, be- took part in the relief of the English forces which were surrounded by tlie Mulkhias near I7ajab Sharif. On return from Mesopotamia he was made Eisaldar, and, owing to the demobilisation of the Cavalry unit, he was forced to take pension after ten years of active service. In 193^ he was appointed a sufedposh, and is also an executive member of the Soldiers’ Board. Ee contributed Es. 50 to the Silver Jubilee Fund. In 1909. some members of the family were in receipt of small pen- sions from the British Government and of a more substantial help from the ruler of I7abha. The then ruler of T7abha was a second cousin of Sardar Balwant Singh by marriage. Se and his brother, Autar Singh, were joint owners of about 1,500 acres in Gurdaspur and Amritsar. The- family has now no jngir or allowance from the British Government. 12 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. RAI BHOWANI SINGH, BHANDARI OF BATALA. Rai Gobind Jas (died 1846), RAI ANAND SINGH (died 1827).

He remained there for five years, and on his return to Lahore received a jagir of Es. 4,000 in the Ludhiana district. He was, later, when Eaja Ilira Singh re- called Fakir Charagh-ud-din from Ferozepore, appointed to that place as agent. Eai Kishan Chand was an able and an upright man. He saw that the interests of the Maharaja required peace with the British, and he did his best to maintain a good undei standing between the Governments. At the beginning of 1839 he accompanied Coloned Wade on his political mission to Peshawar, and during his absence, which laster the greater part of the year, his son, Bhag Singh, acted for him •at Ludhiana. The title of Eai was granted to Kishan Chand by Prince Hao Nihal Singh in 1840. After the death of Maharaja Sher Singh the position of the agents •of Lahore on the British frontier underwent a considerable change. In the days of Mr. Clerk and his predecessors the Vakils were little more than newswriters ; they conducted all current business, but important affairs were arranged by the Agent of the Governor-General with the Maharaja by deputation or letter. But the changes w^hich took place on Sher Singh's death gave to Eai Eishen Chand and his brother and son, who held the agencies at Ferozepore and Ludhiana, great influence and power, which the Lahore ministry was ever trying to redu(‘e and the T akils to retain. Eai Kishan Chand exercised certain civil and criminal powers in the Lahore Protected States, and drew from them considerable wealth. This jurisdiction the ministry of Hira Singh took away, and in November, 1844, the proportion to be paid to the State from the VakiVs^ farm and jagirs was raised to that of the neighbouring districts. Eai Eishan Chand and his family, however, retained considerable in- fluence at Lahore. Jealous of Fakir Aziz-ud-din and somewhat opposed to his policy, they were supported in Darbar by powerful friends, chief of whom were Bhai Earn Singh and Diwan Dina Nath, the leader of the Jliutasaddi party. Although in 1844 Eai Eishan Chand had perhaps encouraged in some measure the beHef at Lahore that the British were hostile to the ikh Government, yet when war became really imminent he protested against it earnestly. But it was then too late, men the Sikh army jas preparing to cross the Sutlej he was ordered by the Political Agent to leave the camp and retire into the Lahore territories, which he did. melT J'V fn and the cession to the British Govern- ment of the JuUundur Doab, the family lost its jagirs on the left bank of the r Eishan Chand was directed to attend on the Agent 1844 whe^h^ rt Lahore, and this appointment he held till 44, when he received permission to retire to Batala. GUBDASPUB DISTBIGT. 16 Bliag Singh had on the return of peace heen appointed Agent of the Barhar with the Commissioner, Trans-Sntlej States, and in 1848 he re- ceived the title of Rai and a dress of honour. Eai Kishan Ohand also received the title of Bahadur and a grant of nine villages in the Dina- nagar district, worth Rs. 8,000, and a cash pension of Es. 4,000 was assigned to him in recognition of his faithful services and as compensation for the jagir he had lost in Ltidhiana. Earn Dayal received at the same time a jagir of Es. 3,000, and a cash pension of the same value. Rai Bhag Singh obtained Es. 2,500 in jagir and Es. 2,500 in cash, and Sharanpat Es. 1,800 in jagir and Es. 1,800 in cash. The two latter did not hold their jagirs or pensions long. At the annexation of the Punjab they were resumed as were the cash allowances of Eai Kishan Chand and Eai Bhag Singh. Earn Dayal died in 1863, and his jagir was I’esumed. He was succeeded by his son, Eai Basheshar Singh, who was also granted his father’s seat in the Provincial Darbar. Eai Basheshar Singh was a member of the Municipal Committee of Batala (Gurdaspur), and proved himself a man of public spirit. He died in 1889 leaving three sons. The second, Kakir Chand, was also a Municipal Commissioner of Batala and the title of Eai Sahib was conferred on him in 1887 in consideration of his public services. He died in 1899. Sheo Singh, the younger son of Basheshar Singh, was now looked upon as the head of the family by virtue of his having succeeded his elder brother, Eai Sahib Faqir Chand. He became a Municipal Com- missioner at Batala and continued as such till his death in 1909. He left two minor sons, Inderjit Singh and Charanjit Singh. The former is a g'raduate of the Punjab University and a Municipal Commissioner at Batala. The latter was adopted as a son by his uncle, Bishambar Dass, who died childless in 1906, and to whose estate he succeeded. Both brothers are engaged in business. Eai Kishan Chand died in 1872 at Benares. His sons, Sharanpat and Bhag Singh, died in 1873 and 1884, respectively. They were in re- ceipt of a pension of Es. 1,000 per annum. The widow of Sharanpat’s son, Earn ISTarayan, received a compassionate allowance of Es. 120 per annum, till her death in 1916. Devi Ditta Mall, son of Eai Singh, was for many years an Honorary Magistrate of Batala. He died childless in 1887, when a muaji enjoyed by him of Es. 150 per annum lapsed to Government. Eai Bhag Singh was for a short period a Tahsildar in the province. He resigned his appointment in 1861 in order to accompany his father to Benares, and, on his return three years after, took up his abode at Batala. He led a useful life connected with the good of his native town. He was a Provincial Darbari and for seventeen years an Honorary Magis- CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. t-ate of Batala. He was also tte first President of its Municipality. He refused an appointment of Extra Assistant Commissioner offered ^ bi Sir John Lawrence when Lieutenant-GoYernor of tbe Punjab. _ He left behind him one son, Kansbi Ram, who was created a Divisional Darbari in 1888 and who remained a Municipal Commimoner all bis life. He founded in 1896, after bis father’s name, Rai Bbag Singh Anglo Sanskrit High School which was the first High School in Batala Fe died in 1901, leaving beHnd two sons, Bhowani Singh and Balwant Eai Bhowani Singh, who is now looked upon as the head of the family, took his Master’s Degree from the Government College, Lahore, in 1901 He then served for a time as Head Master and manager of his father’s school, then as a Head Clerk to the Post Master-General, Gwalior, and later, as a Clerk in the Sessions Court, Amritsar, and in the Sirmoor State. In 1907 he retired to his native town at Batala, of which he has been a Municipal Commissioner since 1916. For seven years (1920—27) he was a member of the District Board, Giirdaspur. in the Great War he founded the Batala War Association and did good work in connection with the second Indian War Loan. In 1917 he founded, after his father’s name, the Hai Kanshi Ram Memorial Library, the first of its kind in the town. He has contributed considerable sums to various funds, 6,g., the Prince of Wales Reception Innd of 1922, the Lady Aitchison Hospital Fund of 1924, the Punjab Leprosy Fund, 1925, and His Late Majesty’s Jubilee Fund of 1935. He is a life mem- ber of the St. John Ambulance Association and an old member of the Punjab Chiefs’ Association. He assisted the administration during the Hon-co-operation, the Akali and similar other mov'ements; and published a number of anti-non-co-operation letters, thus incurring considerable risk to his life and property. This earned him the appreciation of three successive Governors of the Punjab and other officials. Rai Bhowani Singh was granted the ancestral seat of his grandfather as a Provincial Darbari in 1924. In 1930 he received a landed gentry grant of five squares on the Lower Bari Doab Canal in the Montgomery district. His only son, Narendra Singh, has recently taken the LL.B. degree from the Punjab University and commenced practising as a Pleader at Batala. Rai Balwant Singh, the brother of Rai Bhowani Singh, was called to the bar in England in 1913 and later practised as a lawyer at Gurdas- pur till his premature death in 1918. He, too, rendered help in recruit- ment during the War and was awarded a certificate and a revolver by Hih Excellency the Commander-in-Chief .

Little is known of the brothers, who were not men of any importance. Santokh Singh died in 1802, and Sahib Singh two years later. Of the three sons* of Santokh Singh, Dal Singh was the only one to obtain a share of his father^s jagir. Talwandi and some neighbouring villages were left him. Dorangla and the Sialkot estate were seized by Ban jit Singh, who also* took possession of the estate of Sahib Singh. Sardar Dal Singh fought in most of the Maharaja’s campaigns. During his lifetime he divided a portion of his estate between his sons ; Kahan Singh receiving Rai Chak and Chainiwala, and Lai Singh Talwandi. The Sardar was killed in the Sutlej campaign in 1845, and his iagir s were resumed. Kahan Singh had died long before his father. He fell in the battle of Saidhu' in March, 1827, fighting against Syad Ahmad ShaB^ His only son was killed ten years later, in April, 1837, in the battle of Jamriid. Sardar* Lai Singh was born in 1798 and saw a good deal of service. He fought in the Multan and Kashmir expeditions of 1918-19, and at Jamrud, where his nephew was slain. In 1848 he was appointed to co-operate with 'Gurmani Lai, the Adalati, or Chief Justice, of the Manjha, holding* the command of fifty horse. In 1857, at the requisition of Government, he furnished ten horsemen for service in Hindustan, and sent vdth them his two sons, Hira Singh and Gopal Singh. Both fought gallantly throughout the campaign. Hira Singh was made a Eisaldar; and in 1859 on his retirement, received a present of Bs. 1,800 and a grant of 50' acies of land near Hurpur in the Kangra district.

A considerable portion of the history both of the Kanhaya Misae and of Sardar Hakikat Singh has already been given at some length, and does not reqiure repetition here. Haidkat Singh was the son of Baghel Singh, a Sindhu Jat cultivator of the village of Julka, only a few miles from Kana, where Jai Singh Kanhaya was born. Both Jai Singh and Hakikat Singh were in the service of Kapnr Singh Singhpnria, and both on his death set up as independent chiefs. To the latter fell Kalananr, Bura, Dulbo, Kahangarh, Adalatgarh, Pathankot, Matn and many other 'Stages. Under him fought the Sangatpuria Sardars, Sahib Singh Ifaniki, Dayal Smgh and Sant Singh Dadupnria, Desa Singh Mohal, Chet Singh Banod, Sahib Singh Taragarhia and many others. In 1760 Hakikat Singh, having destroyed Chnrianwala, built on its ruins the ^age of Sangatpuria and the fort of Fatehgarh, wHch he named after his nephew. Mehtab Smgh, who possessed a large share of his brother’s estate, built a fort hard by, which he named Chitorgarh. GUBDASPUE DISTBIGT. . 2t Sardar Hakikat Singh, died in 1782^ and his only son, Jaimal Singh,' a boy eleven years of age, succeeded to his estates. This chief did not do much to extend the Kanhaya possessions, but he held his own and did not lose any of them. In 1812, he died, leaving no son, and Ranjit Singh determined to seize the wealth supposed to be stored in Patehgarh. He sent thither one Earn Singh on a pretended mission of condolence to- the widow; but no sooner was the officer admitted than he took posses- sion in the name of the Maharaja. Three months later, the widow o£ Jaimal Singh gave birth to a son, and in favour of this infant, named Chanda Singh, the Maharaja released a portion of the estate of the- value of Es. 15,000. A few months before his death Jaimal Singh had married his only daughter, Chand Xaur, a girl of ten years of age, to Kharak Singh, son of the Maharaja and heir to the throne of the Punjab. The marriage was- celebrated with the greatest splendour at Patehgarh on the 6th February, 1812. It was attended by the chiefs of Kaithal, Nabha and Jind, and by Colonel Ochterlony, Agent of the Govern or-Greneral. In February, 1821, Chand Kaur gave birth to a son, who was named 17ao Ifihal Singh,, and on the death of the great Maharaja in June, 1839, her husband, Kharak Singh, ascended the throne. Kharak Singh was a man of strong passions and weak intellect.. Superstitious and regular in the discharge of his religious duties, he was- yet addicted to many degrading vices, unforgiving and vindictive; he was entirely in the hands of the favourite of the hour. His peaceful succession was in a great measure owing to Raja Dhian Singh, who gave out that Ranjit Singh on his death-bed had named Kharak Singh to. succeed him, and had chosen him, Dhian Singh, as Minister. Dhian Singh had been almost absolute during the last years of Ranjit Singh's life, and he was determined that his power should not now- decline. It was thus essential for him to have on the throne a*. Prince who would consent to be led by his Minister, and who would, not himself aspire to rule. Dhian Singh had a still dearer ambition than this. His eldest son, Hira Singh, had been the darling of the old Maharaja. He was allowed a chair in the presence, when all others,, except two or three of the most holy Bhais, were compelled to stand y*- without him the Maharaja could not go to sleep; without him he never went out to take the air. Hira Singh had thus been brought up like thei Maharaja’s own child, and as such he was regarded by the Khalsa army. Was it, then, too bold an ambition to hope that some day he might lule the Punjab as King, with Dhian Singh, his father, as his chief adviser,, holding all real power in the State; with one uncle, the gallant and 22 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. debauched Saja Suchet Singh, Commander-in-Chief, and the other Grulab Singh, ruling all the hill country. Then, in firm alliance with the Kabul Amir and the Court of Nepal, the Dogra family of Jammu might become the most powerful in all India, and found a dynasty for itself. Maharaja Kharak Singh was found more difScult to lead than the Minister had imagined. He hated Dhian Singh, and gave to Sardar Chet Singh Bajwa all his confidence. This favourite well knew that so long as Dhian Singh lived his position was an unsafe one, and consiDired with the Drench Generals, who were bitterly opposed to the Dogra family, against his life. But Dhian Singh was not to be defeated on his own ground of intrigue. He induced Bani Chand Kaur and Nao Nihal Singh to admit the necessity for Chet Singh’s removal by urging upon them that should his conspiracy succeed, all power would fall into the hands of Chet Singh and the Drench ; and it was determined to assassinate the obnoxious favourite that very night. The Eaja won the palace guards over to his side, and entering the fort by the Bhaia Dayalwala gate one hour before dawn, with Prince Nao Nihal Singh, Gidab Singh, Suchet Singh, Atar Singh Sindhanwalia, Fateh Singh Man and some others, slew Chet Singh in the sleeping apartments of the Maharaja himself. After this murder, committed on the 9th October, 1839, Kharak Singh’s reign was virtually over. It continued the fashion for his son to ask his directions and orders, which were carried out if the Minister and the Prince concurred, and if not they were disregarded; he was allowed to retain the form and pomp of Kingship, and received Mr. Clerk, Agent to the Governor-General, in May, 1840, with great state, covered with jewels and wearing the famous Koh-i-Nur diamond; but aU power was gone from him, and during the last four months of his life he was never consulted on any matter of state, and remained in the fort a prisoner in all but the name. TVT ^ danger to his power in Prince ^ao Aihal Singh. This yonngman was high spirited and bold and, though disliked by the Sardars, was loved by the army, which hoped o see him rival the military exploits of his grandfather. Tliis too was the I’riBce’s own ambition. He does not appear to have shown any paiticnlar ability, but he was headstrong and impatient of control; and Dhian Singh s influence over him decreased day by day, and the Baja began to fear that when he succeeded to the throne he might choose some ^w mmister who^se removal might prove more difficult than that of ^et Singh had been. Prom the beginning of September the life of Kharak Singh, who had always been of a weeHy constitution, had been GUBDASPUB DI8TBIGT. ‘despaired of by the physicians. Duiing October he rapidly sank, and on the 4th November he died, aged thirty-eight. His end was accelerated, according to the general belief, by poison administered by the orders of Dhian Singh, and with the knowledge of his son. But, even if Nao Nihal Singh had no such share as this in his father’s death, he had certainly hastened ii by his nndutifnl and cruel conduct. To the last, the ‘dying monarch had thought of his son with love, and had sent message .after message calling him to his side. But Nao Nihal Singh never went. He was eager for the time when the death of the father he despised would leave him uncontrolled master of the State ; and when the news reached him, when hunting at Shah Balawal, that the Maharaja was dead, he had not the decency to conceal his satisfaction. The next day, the 5th November, the body of Eharak Singh was 'burnt on the plain beyond the Hoshnai gate of the fort. With it were .also burnt the beautiful Hani Ishwar Xaur, sister of Sardar Mangal .Singh Sindhu and three slave girls. Nao Nihal Singh attended the .ceremony ; but before the body was entirely consumed, faint with the heat of the sun, retired to perform his ablutions in the branch of the river Bavi that flowed by the fort. He returned on foot towards the palace, followed by the whole Court, holding the hand of Mian IJdham Singh, his inseparable companion, eldest son of Baja Gulab Singh. As he ap- proached the gateway he called for water to drink. None was at hand, .and all the bottles of sacred Ganges water which had been brought to .sprinkle on the funeral pile were empty. The superstitious Sardar whispered that this was an evil omen; but the Prince laughed and passed <on. As he stepped beneath the archway, down fell the battlements, beams, stone and brickwork with a tremendous crash. It was all over in .a moment. Mian tJdham Singh was extricated from the rubbish with his .neck broken, quite dead. Nao Nihal Singh’s left arm was broken and his skull fractured. He breathed heavily, but neither moved nor spoke. Baja Dhian Singh, who had been close behind when the catastrophe occurred, and who was himself grazed by the falling mass, called up a palanquin, of which there were many waiting, and placing the Prince in it had him carried into the marble garden-house, where Eanjit Singh .had been used to hold his morning Darbar, and the great gates of the Hazuri Bagh were shut and locked. No one but Fakirs Aziz-ud-din and Nur-ud-din and Bhais Bam Singh and Gobind Bam were allowed to ‘enter, .and within an hour Nao Nihal Singh had breathed his last. Baja Dhian Singh was not, however, at a loss. He sent a message 'to summon Prince Sher Singh, who was shooting at Kahnuwan, some •eighty miles from Lahore, and placed relays of blood horses along th^ iroad to bring him in with all possible speed. He sent information to 24 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. Muitan, Peshawar, Mandi and elsewhere that the Prince was but\" slightly hurt, and he wrote a letter to the Agent of the Governor-Grenerar in the name of the Prince, and, as if dictated by him, saying that he waa- much hurt but hoped that he might recover; and on the 6th the Raja sent a chief to Amritsar to spread the report that the Prince was much better. For some time the corpse lay in a tent of shawls in the • garden house, but was removed into the fort at night, and placed in one- of the inner apartments. Dhian Singh made all arrangements for^ securing the forts of Lahore and Gobindgarh till, at noon on the 7th, Prince Sher Singh arrived. Concealment was no longer necessary, and the death of Nao Nihal Singh was proclaimed. The death of the Prince^ left two claimants for the vacant throne. The first of these was Prince Sher Singh, reputed son of Maharaja Run jit Singh. Sher Singh had, however, been always acknowledged by the^ Maharaja, and a large party were ready to support his claims to the *Tlie account of the death of Nao Nihal Singh given in the text was . taken from the statements of Eai Mul Singh, Bhai Fateh Singh, Colonel Chet Singh, Biwan Ratan Chand and\" other eye witnesses, and from the official reports submitted to Government. Colonel Chet Singh was on guard at the spot where the accident occurred ; Bhai Fateh Singh, the chief ' priest of Maharaja Eanjit Singh’f- tomb, was seated with Fakir Nur-urd-Din on the roof imme- diately overlooking the gateway. He saw the parapet fall, the Prince and the Mian struck down; and he also saw Baja Dhian Singh, who was only two paces behind, struck by the- falling bricks on the arm. Diwan Batan Chand Dhariwala was walking in the procession but a few yards behind the Prince. He came up immediately the accident had happened and saw the Prince’s head smashed in and the brain oozing from the wound and from his ear. He was then insensible and dying. There were some well informed and able men, intimately acquainted with the intrigue^ of the time, who openly accused Baja Dhian Singh as the murderer of the Prince. It was- ass^ed by them that the parapet was thrown down by bis orders ; that Udham Singh, his nephew, was sacrificed to give a greater appearance of accident to the catastrophe ; that the palanqum was in waiting to carry away the wounded or dead Prince and even that Baja Hira Sn^h, seated on the top of the opposite gateway, must have given the signal for the parapet to be thro™ down. It is also said that the Prince was only slightly wounded by the fall of the parapet and that he was afterwards heard to ask for water ; that he was hurried into the locked up in an inner room, where only the physician and ' tne i:?a3a were admitted, and that here the Prince was really murdered. This stoiy is unsupported ty a shadow of proof, and the more attentively it is consider d the n-ore impopiWe it will appear. It was natural of course to attribute so sudden a death' !! e Mtngue and conspiracy. Princes do not die often by accident in I ®i.i I® evid^ce to convict Eaja Dhian Singh of the crime. He ttatX f™ withont false accusation being added. It may be admitted- ambitious schemes were in question : andthe&etof Wrerflhww the fate of his victim would ha-e given him hut little concern.

He was at this time a man o£ tliirty-tliree years of age, lianc*- suiue and well made ; a braTe and dashing leader in the field and populai with the army; but of debauched habits, irresolute and infirm of purpose, and without the ability’ and energy needed to govern a people excitable- as the Sikhs. The second candidate for power was Mai Chand Kaur, widow of Maharaja Kharak Singh. When the death of her son took place she- was at her ancestral village of Tatehgarh. She returned to Lahore on the ^Uh November, only to find that Haja Dhian Singh had outwitted her and had won over some of the chiefs to agree to the succession cjf' Prince Sher Singh. Chand Kaur, finding affairs thus unfavourable, attempted a compromise. The first plan that she and her counsellor Bhai Earn Singh proposed was that she should adopt Eaja Hira Singh, son Oi Lilian vSingh, and place him on the throne. This was declined by the opposite party, who proposed instead that she should marry Sher vSingh, This she rejected with disdain, and offered to acknowled^^e- vSardar Atar Singh Sindlianwalia as her heir. This proposal was received^ See previous page. Those vrho assert that the Prince was at first but slightly wounded, and that he was mur- dered afterwards within the fort, must be aware that they thus accuse Fakir Nur-ud-Bin of being a sharer in the crime. He never left the Prince from the time that the wall fell till his death. But to those who knew the Fakir’s gentle and amiable disposition, his loyalty to the house of the great Maharaja, his devoted love for the young Prince, such a supposition appears monstrous. Fakir Kur-ud-Din too at the time was on bad terms with the Raja. Che Singh, whom the Raja had murdered, was the friend of Fakirs Hur-ud-Din and Aziz-ud- din and they never forgave Dhian Singh or trusted him afterwards. Why, then, should Hur-ud-Din murder the Prince he loved to gratify the Raja he hated ? The only others who were admitted into the Hazuri Bagh were Bhai Ram Singh, Bhai Gobind Ram and Fakir Aziz-ud-din. The two former were brothers, and Ram Singh was the confidential Minister of the Prince with whose life his power would cease. He was entirely opposed in policy to Dhian Singh as was his brother Gobind Ram. Yet, if the Prince was murdered in the fort these must have been the murderers, these the accomplices of the Raja. The only reason for the mystery which shrouded the death-bed of the Prince was the- necessity which Dhian Singh felt for keeping the fatal news from being generally known unti) the arrival of Sher Singh. If there had been an organized plot, the Raja would have taken care that Sher Singh should have been present in Lahore at the time of the catastrophe. The absence of Sher Singh proves the innocence of the Raja. The story of the conspiracy has originated in a belief that the death of Nao Nihal Singh was necessary to the development of the Dogra policy. But, although Hira Singh could never hope for the throne while Nao Nihal Singh was alive, yet the death of the Prince at this time was in no way desired by the Raja. The time for Hira Singh to he brought forward had not arrived, and during the intrigues of the three succeeding months, his name was only men- tioned by the party opposed to the Raja as a possible candidate for the throne. The Raja had some influence over Nao Nihal Singh ; but at this time he had none with Sher Singh, who was a military leader, popular with the troops, and who might he expected to be able to stand without his aid. Besides it was an equal chance whether the party of Rani Chand Kaur might- not obtain power, in which case the Raja would have been ruined. To say that the Raja raised Sher Singh to the throne in order to destroy him later is a mere assertion. Dhian Singh did not create difficulties to have the pleasure of conquering them, and Sher Singh was eventual- ly assassinated by the Sindhanwalias, the deadly enemies of Dhian Singh. The death of Nao Nihal Singh was the greatest calamity that could have befallen the Raja. He entri- cated himself by the strength of his genius, hut it was nevertheless a calamity. There are some who believe that a Nemesis pursues and punishes great crime. These- will not forget that it was when returning from the funeral pile of the father he had treated trith so much unkindness, and whose death he had hastened and longed for, that Nao Nihal Singh was struck down, when wealth, power and the sovereignty of the Punjab were- within his very grasp.

This announce- ment changed the aspect of affairs. The question was now not of a sovereign, but of a regent, and it was doubtful whether the Eani or the Prince would win the day. On the side of the Mai (as Eani Chand Kaur was called) were Bhais Earn Singh and Gobind Earn, Sardars Atar Singh, Lehna Singh ard A jit Singh Sindhanwalia, Fateh Singh Man, General Giilab Si ugh Provindia, Shaikh Ghulam Muhi-ud-din, Jamadar Khushal Singh and General Tej Singh. With the prince were Sardars Fateh Singh Ahlu- walia, Dhana Singh Malwai, Sham Singh Attariwala, the three Jammu Eajas, Dhian Singh, Gulab Singh and Suchet Singh, Bliai Giirmiikh Singh, Fakir Aziz-ud-din and the French Generals, Ventura and Court. Among the neutrals were the crafty Dina Nath and the timid Sardar Lehna Singh Majitliia. Nor was the policy of the chiefs above-named or their adherence to their party at all constant or unwavering. The Jammu Eajas, though their policy and their interests w^ere really the same, appeared now to adopt one side, now the other; while Ehushal Singh and Tej Singh were ever ready to change to that party which seemed most able to enrich them. Few of the sardars had much interest in either candidate. Mai Chand Kaur was not popular as her 'Chief adviser was Bhai Earn Singh, who in the days of Nao Nihal Singh had been so obnoxious to the chiefs by reducing their jagirs and increas- ing their contingents. Those who supported her, did so in the hope that with a feeble Zanana government they might retain that indepen- dence of authority, the love and boast of a Sikh, which they had enjoyed during the last year of Eanjit Singh’s life. The Sindhanwalia chiefs, who were her firmest allies, were at the beginning of November absent from Lahore; Ajit Singh, who was said to be her lover, being engaged in the Kulu and Mandi campaign, and Atar vSingh being at Hardwar. The latter, shortl^T- followed by his nephew, arrived at Lahore about the 12th November, just after the Mai had proposed another scheme for uniting the parties. This was that she should adopt Partap Singh, eldest son of Sher Singh, thus attaching the Prince to her Government, w^hile it would remove the objection felt to him on account of his spurious, birth ; but this like every other plan failed ; and the feeling in Lahore grew strong that a co-regency of the Prince and the Mai during the preg- nancy of the young widow was the only way of obtaining union, the acts of the regents being controlled by a national council of chiefs. This arrangement was in some measure modified; and on the 20th at was agreed that Mai Chand Kaur should be the chief authority in the GUBDASPUB DISTBICT. 27 .State, tliat Slier SingL. shonld be President of the council of cbiefs and Jiave command of tJie army, wliile DMan Singb sbonld be Minister.

A week, however, saw its abandonment. It was found impossible to be carried out in practice, .and every day brought with it the danger of a collision. Both parties occupied the fort; the Mai, the inner apartments; the Prince, the Hazuri Bagh and the outer portion. He occasionally went out in state, aad Chand Kaur more than once thought of closing the gates against his return. The mode of conducting business was equally anomalous. Th •early Darbar was held in Sher Singh’s presence in the marble garden house in the Hazuri Bagh; then the ministers retired to a conference in the Shish Mahal; and, lastly, waited on the Mai in the Saman Burj. Haja Dhian Singh now appeared to be won over to the side of Chaad Kaur, it was said through the advocacy of Baja Gulab Singh, to whom the Mai had promised the restoration of Manawar; but the Minister intended to show both parties how idle it was for them to hope to stand without his assistance. A final agreement was accordingly drawn up on the 27th I7ovember, by which Sher Singh was to retire to his jayir at Batala for eight months, leaving his son, Partab Singh, a member of the coimcil. Mai Chand Kaur was to remain regent until the birth, of Sahib Kaur’s child, when other arrangements were to be made. This agreement was signed by Bajas Dhian Singh and Gulab Singh, Sardar. Lehna Singh Majithia, Atar Singh Sindhanwalia, Fatteh Singh Man, .Mangal Singh Sindhu, Tej Singh, Sham Singh Atariwala, Dhana Singh Malwai, Jamadar Khushal Singh, Bhais Bam Singh and Gurmukh .Singh, Fakir Aziz-ud-din, Diwan Dina Hath and Shaikh Ghulam Muhi- ud-din. Both parties, cajoled by Baja Dhian Singh, were fully repre- sented in the deed ; and Prince Sher Singh seeing resistance hopeless a,nd not understanding the policy of the Baja, retired to Batala, where he waited his opportunity for action. The counsellors of the Mai were not long in discovering their weakness. The Baja scarcely ever attended Darbar, but spent his time in hunting and shooting ; while day by day the country grew more un- quiet, the roads became insecure, crime largely increased and the out- lying frontier districts were preparing to rebel. Dhian Singh had now •convinced himself that the Government could not be carried on without him ; but he wished to convince the counsellors of the Mai of the same fact, and accordingly on the 2nd January, 1841, he left for Jammu. _Buin now fast came on the Government.

On the 13th January Ajit Singh Sindhanwalia left Lahore under pretence of retiring to his village of Raja Sansi before the arrival of Dhian Singh; but he instead travelled to Ludhiana with a message from Chand Kaur to the Agent of the Governor-General, but failed to obtain an interview. On the 14th Lahore was taken by surprise by the arrival of Sher Singh at Shalamar, six miles from the city. The Prince had been sound- ing the armv and found it generally well disposed towards him; the^ French Generals had promised him their support; and he accordingly prepared to try his fortune during the absence of Raja Dhian Singh in Jammu. On his arrival at Shalamar, an officer belonging to one of General Gulab Singh’s battalions waited upon him and begged him to- proceed to their lines. The Prince accepted the invitation and marched to the Begampur lines, where he encamped amid Gulab Singh Povindia^s battalions under a general salute. The garrison of the fort had not been idle. With the Mai in the* fort were Rajas Gulab Singh and Hira Singh, and Sardars Atar Singh Sindhanwalia, Mangal Singh Sindhu and Ghulam Muhi-ud-din. Re- inforcements were called in ; three battalions of Amir Singh Man and the artillery of Lehna Singh Majithia. Guns were posted at all the city gates, and the troops of Raja Suchet Singh and the Charyari Horse were* marched from Shahdara and drawn up in front of the fort. Camel messengers were also sent ofE to summon Raja Dhian Singh with all speed. During the 15th a large luoportion of the army went over to the Prince, and on the morning of the 16th he had with him twenty-six thousand foot, eight thousand horse and forty-five guns. He then marched in great state, accompanied by Generals Ventura, Court and many Sikh Sardars to T.ahore, and entered by the Taksali gate without opposition. At the Badshahi Mosque Colonel Dhaunkal Singh delivered- up to him the magazine stored there, and in a short time he was in possession of the whole city. He then summoned the fort to surrender. But Gulab Singh had resolved to defend it. The garrison now consisted of about three thousand men, principally hill troops of the Raja, and upon them the treasure of Chand Kaur was lavishly spent. Gulab’ Singh was round to every post and inspected the defences, encouraging the men by presents and promises. The attack began by the discharge* of fourteen double-shotted guns against the Hazuri Bagh gate of the fort. The gate was blown in, and the besiegers, headed by a mob of fanatical Akalis, charged through the opening with shouts of triumph. GUBDASPUB DISTBICT. 29 But tlie besieged had two guns loaded with grape just behind the gate, •and these were now fired with such terrible effect that the enemy were driven back in confusion and with great loss. The gate was ihen barricaded, and the fort opened fire upon the Hazuri Bagh. The Dogra soldiers were first-rate marksmen ; and Sher Singh lost so many men that on the morning of the 17th he withdrew from the Hazuri Bagli to the Badshahi Mosque. During the night of the 16th, the assailants had kept up a heavy fire from the fifty pieces of canon and howitzers, and had brought down a considerable portion of the southern wall. The party of the Mai now began to think of their own safety. Bhai Earn 'Singh waited on the Prince and was well received; and the next day Jamadar Khushal Singh and his nephew, Tej Singh, who had been most profuse in their professions of devotion to the Mai, tendered their -allegiance to Sher Singh. Eaja Gulab Singh was again summoned to surrender. He asked for a truce till the arrival of his brother, who was hastening back to Lahore. This was refused; and he then swore that, as a Eajput, he would defend the fort to the last. Firing was then resumed and was <con tinned throughout the day. In the evening Eajas Dhian Singh and Suchet Singh arrived from Jammu and encamped outside the city. Tlie latter visited Sher Singh and reported that Dhian Singh would attend the next day. Accordingly, on the morning of the 18th the Eaja and the Prince met. The former expressed his regret at the hasty conduct of Sher Singh, and recommended immediate negotiation being 'OjDened with the defenders of the fort. Eaja Gulab Singh was glad enough to treat, and his brother obtained for him favourable terms. The garrison were allowed to retire with their arms and all the honours ‘Of war, Mai Chand Kaur renouncing her pretensions to the regency and receiving the grant of a large jagir at Kadiali near Jammu. These terms being arranged, Eaja Gulab Singh marched out of the fort at midnight on the 19th and encamped on the plain in front of it; Sardar Atar Singh Sindhanwalia followed and encamped at Shah Bilawal. The next morning the Prince with an immense procession went to review the artillery and thank them for their services^ and then proceeded to the fort, where he took seat on the throne while all the artillery saluted. Mai Chand Kaur was at this time in the Saman Burj in charge of the high priest, Bikram Singh. The city of Lahore now became a prey to anarchy and license. The soldiery could not be restrained, and plundered the houses of friends and foes alike. Jamadar Khushal Singh very nearly fell a victim to their fury; and others peculiarly obnoxious were Eaja Gulab Singh, General Court, Sardar Muhammad Sultan Khan and Lehna Singh so CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. Majittda. The camp of the last-named chief was plundered, and the army proposed to attack that of Gulab Singh; but he had been reinforced, and- set off for Jammu with an immense amount of treasure and accompanied by Jamadar Khushal Singh, who found Lahore no longer safe. The- house of General Court was attacked by three regiments of his own battalion, and he fled for protection to General Ventura, who had to use- his artillery to protect himself and his friend. The Tnunshis and writers were hated by the army for their extortion and fraud, and were- hunted down in all directions and killed. The life of no man was safe- who admitted that he could write, or whose fingers showed that he was used to hold the pen. In these terrible days every man gratified his- private revenge; officers w*ere killed by their men; shopkeepers by their- debtors; and all the horrors of a storm had fallen upon the unhappy city. It was many days before the troops were pacified, and the license which they then enjoyed they never forgot; from that time they g'rew more and more mutinous and reckless, till neither King nor Minister could restrain them. The State installation of Sher Singh as Maharaja did not take place' till the 27th. The tikka, or mark of Kajaship, was imprinted on his forehead by Bawa Bikram Singh, who also presented the khillaU of investiture to the Maharaja, to Prince Partab Singh as Heir-apparent, and to Raja Dhian Singh as Minister. All the chiefs and sardars were- prosent and tendered their allegiance to the new Sovereign, and for Rani Chand Kaur the game was played out. During these events Raja Dhian Singh and Raja Gulab Singh appeared to take different sides; but there is every reason to believe that they always maintained the closest alliance between themselves. One brother adopted the cause of Sher Singh, and the other that of the Rani in order that, whichever was successful, their own powder and’ wealth might be secured. Raja Dhian Singh’s conduct was such that his most devoted adherents were sometimes doubtful wffiich party he really favoured ; but although prepared for any emergency, he had a de* finite policy. He left Lahore for Jammu, hoping that Prince Sher Singh would in the absence make an effort to win the throne. He desired his success; but wished to be absent from Lahore, as he would have been compromised by the failure of the Prince, and it would have been- indecent to have openly joined him while the Minister of Chand Kaur. But, supposing Sher Singh too timid or too wanting in energy for the effort, Dhian Singh’s absence from Lahore would still be advan- tageous to him. It would finally convince the weak government of Rani Chand Kaur that the Raja’s help was necessary to their existence; and he would have been recalled with full powers^ and would have been GURDASPUB DISTRICT. able to put Sher Siugli aside as no longer necessary to Hs personal ambition. The army was also devoted to tlie Eaja without whose aid Shor Singh could never hope to reign. But this project almost failed through the precipitance of Sher Singh. He knew Dhian Singh sufficiently to fear and distrust him, and hoped to gain power without liis assistance at all. For this reason he attacked the fort immediately the army had come over to his side. Baja Dhian Singh at Jammu, Baja Gulab Singh in the fort, had never anticipated this. Both knew that if tlie Prince should succeed without their help their influence would be- destroyed, and for this reason Gulah Singh tried to obtain a respite^ from hostilities till his brother would arrive; and when this was refused, determined to defend the fort to the last. He was, too, in the presence of danger brave as a lion ; and though he always preferred intrigue to violence, yet, when intrigue had failed, there was no more skilful or- gallant warrior than he, and he considered that in honour he could not 3 *ield the fort without a struggle. There was another reason which induced him to defend the fort. This was the immense wealth which it\" contained, a great portion of which, in money and jewels,^ he carried away with him to Jammu. But putting Gulah Singh, his policy, his bravery and his service aside, that the fort was defended to the interests- of Dhian Singh and not of Chand Kaur is clear from Baja Hira Singh being present within it, and one of its ablest defenders being Sultan Muhammad Khan Barakzai, a devoted follower of the Baja. There is little more to tell of Bani Chand Kaur. Baja Gulab Singh proposed to take both her and Bani Sahib Kaur with him to Jammu ; but this Sher Singh would not allow. He did not wish to put weapons- into the hands of his enemy. She was ordered to leave the Saman Burj and retire to her house in the city, and here she carried on her intrigues- with the chiefs and the army. Sardar Ajit Singh Sindhanwalia she sent to Calcutta to plead her cause with the Governor-General and her emissaries were busily employed all over the country. In October, 1841, Sardar Atar Singh proceeded at her invitation from Thanesar to Ferozepore where he waited for a favourable opportunity to enter the Punjab. In the interest of the Mai were at this time about twelve thousand of the army and some powerful chiefs ; but as Sher Singh grew unpopular from his inability to comply with the demands of the troops the influence of the Mai increased, and in April, 1842, the army generally was favourable to her cause. ♦Tt has been stated that when Sher Singh entered the fort, Gulab Singh presented to him the^ Koh-UNur diamond^ which he asserted he had preserved. Thfe is not correct. The Maharaja, on gaining the fort, was in great alarm at not finding the famous diamond, and both he and his ministers believed that Gulab Singh had carried it o% as no doubt he would havo- done had he been able. But about a fortnight later Misar BeU Ram discovered it at Fateh- garh, the ancestral village of Rani Chand Kaur, whither tbe lady had sent it with^ many other crown jewels. :32 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. Maliaraja Slier Singh now perceived that so long as this ambitious .and scheming woman lived he could not he secure and resolved on her desti'uction. Eaja Dhian Singh equally desired her death. It is true that she was at the head of a party which his countenance could at any -time render formidable should Sher Singh desire to get rid of him; hut he saw that this was an improbable contingency, and that the Maharaja •was convinced that, however much he disliked his Minister, he was unable to cany on the Government without him. He thus agreed to the death of the Eani, which he believed would free him from the fear of the bated .Sindhanwalias. Early in June, 1S42, Sher Singh, with most of the chiefs and a large iorce, marched to Wazirabad, Baja Dhian Singh remaining behind in Iiahore. Chand Kaur had been ordered to take up her quarters again in .the fort, of which Mihan Singh was in charge; and on the 12th of June her slave girls, who had received their orders, attempted to kill her by -mixing poison in a beverage which they offered her. She tasted it and -threw it away; and the girls then, fearing their design was discovered, fell upon her with stones, fractured her skull and left her for dead. Baja Dhian Singh attended his victim immediately and had her wounds dressed. Fakir Hur-ud-din thought at one time there was some hope of her life; but she never recovered her senses, and died within two days. 'The assassins were heavily ironed; and it is said that when threatened with mutilation they accused Dhian Singh openly of having instigated :the murder and of having promised them great rewards for effecting -it. Their fate is unknown ; but it is supposed they were made away with the order of the Baja, Chanda Singh, the brother of Bani Chand Kaur, held the Kanhaya estates until the accession of Sher Singh. They had been much improved by Hao Mhal Singh who had sent to Fatehgarh much of his treasure, with that accumulated by Chand Kaur. This was seized by Sher Singh in February, 1841. Kesar Singh and his mother were taken to Lahore, and were only released on the intercession of Chand Kaur, whom Sher Singh at that time hoped to marry. Jagirs of the value of Bs. 60,000 were left to Chanda Singh, Bs. 45,000 of which were re- - sumed after the murder of the Bani, when her large estates near Jammu fell into the hands of Baja Gulab Singh. The misfortunes of the family were not yet ended. When Hira Singh rose to power, he confiscated the whole of the remaining estates of Chanda Singh, the reason given being that he had illuminated his house on hearing of the death of Baja Dhian Singh. Whether the story was true or false, it is certain that in the Baja’s death Chanda Singh had every reason for joy. When Sardar Jowahir Singh became Minister, he GUBDASPUB DISTBICT. restored to tlie family a jagir worth Rs. 3,060 at Talwandi and Kotli, wMcli Kesar Singh enjoyed until his death in 1870. Kesar Singh’s nephew, Samp Singh, is now the representative of the family. The latter’s son Griilab Singh was a Jamadar in the 30th Punjab Infantry, but was obliged to resign owing to ill-health. He died in 1910. In 1916 the family helped the Government with recruits for the Indian army, and for this service Samp Singh was awarded 8 squares of land in the Multan district. He was also included in the category of Sardars and jagirdars mentioned in entry 6 {d) Schedule I, Indian Arms Rules, 1924. His grandson, Sardar IJmrao Singh, has since 1931 been a nominated member of the Small Town Committee of Fatehgarh ; and his great-grandson, Sardar Mohindar Singh, has done good wort in the Excise Department. The family property had shrunk to small dimen- sions by 1910, when Samp Singh had a small assignment of land at Fatehgarh where the mins of the fort, built by his ancestors, are still standing. He also enjoyed a small muafi in certain villages in the A.jnala Tahsil as well as cash jagirs of an annual value of Rs. 622, besides being the owner of some 300 highas in Sangalpur, Tahsil Ajnala, where he resides. 84 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE.

He was a man of some learning, and was appointed GUBDASPUB DISTBICT. 35 Qazi or magistrate over seventy villages in the neighbourhood of Qadian^ which town he is said to have founded, naming it Islampur Qazi, from which Qadian has by a natural change arisen.^’* For several generations the family held the offices of respectability under the Imperial Govern- ment, and it was only when the Sikhs became powerful that it fell into poverty. Gul Muhammad and his son, Ata Muhammad, were engaged in perpetual quarrels with the Eamgarhia and Kanhaya Misals, who held the country in the neighbourhood of Qadian; and at last, hav^ing* lost all the estates, Ata Muhammad retired to Begowal where, under the protection of Sardar Fateh Singh Ahluwalia, he lived quietly for twelve years. On his death Ran jit Singh, who had taken possession of all the lands of the Ramgarhia Misaly invited Ghulam Murtaza to return to Qadian, and restored to him a large portion of his ancestral estates. He then, with his brothers, entered the army of the Maharaja, and jjer- formed efficient service on the Kashmir frontier and at other places. During the time of !Nao Nihal Singh, Sher Singh and the Darb.nr, Ghulam Murtza was continually employed on active service. In 1841 he was sent with General Ventura to Mandi and Kulu, and in 1843 to Peshawar in command of an infantry regiment. He distinguished him- self in Hazara at the time of the insurrection there; and when the re- bellion of 1848 broke out, he remained faithful to his Government and fought on its side. His brother, Ghulam Muhi-ud-din, also did good services at this time. When Bhai Maharaj Singh was marching with his force to Multan to the assistance of Diwan Mul Raj, Ghulam Muhi- ud-din with other jagirdars, Langar Khan Sahiwal and Sahib Khan Tiwana, raised the Muslim population, and with the force of Misar Sahib Dayal attacked the rebels and completely defeated them, driving them into the Chenab, where upwards of six hundred perished. At annexation the jagirs of the family were resumed, but a pension of Rs. 700 was granted to Ghulam Murtaza and his brothers and they retained their proprietary rights in Qadian and the neighbouring villages. The family did excellent service during the Mutiny of 1857. Ghulam Murtaza enlisted many men, and his son, Ghulam Qadir, was serving in the force of General Nicholson when that officer destroyed the mutineers of the 46th Native Infantry, who hal fled from Sialkot, at Trimmu Ghat. General Nicholson gave Ghulam Qadir a certificate, stating that in 1857 the Qadian family showed greater loyalty than any other m the district. Ghulam Murtaza, who was known as a skilful physician, died in 1876, and was succeeded b^' his son, Ghulam Qadir. The latter was *The Punjab dialect has z, and the Arabic z and d are often interchanged as Gumbaz> ''Gnnbad ; Ustad, Eataz. 36 CHIEFS AND FAMILIES OF NOTE. al'tv'ays active in assisting tlie local authorities^ and possessed many certificates from officers connected with the administration. He served for a time as superintendent of the Gurdaspur District Office. His only son died in early youth and he had adopted his nephew, Sultan Ahmed, who since Ghulam Qadir’s death in 1883, was regarded as the head of the family. Mirza Sultan Ahmed entered the service of Government as iN’aib-Talisildar, and rose to be an Extra Assistant Commissioner. He was a Lamhardar of Qadian, but his duties in this capacity were performed by his uncle, UTizam-ud-din, the eldest son of Ghulam Miihi- ud-din. Mirza Sultan Ahmad received the title of Khan Bahadur and five squares of land in the Montgomery district. He died in 1930. His eldest son, Mirza Aziz Ahmed, M.A., is now the head of the family. He is an Extra Assistant Commissioner in the Punjab. Khan Bahadur Mirza Sultan Ahmed’s younger son, Mirza Rashid Ahmed, is an enter- prising Zamindar who has acquired a large area of land in Sindh. Inam- ud-din, brother of Mzam-ud-din, who died in 1904, served as Risaldar in Hodson’s Horse at the siege of Delhi. His father, Ghulam Muhi-ud-din, was a Tahsildar. Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, younger son of Ghulam Murtza, was the founder of the remarkable religious movement known as the Ahmadiya. Born in 1835, he received an excellent education, and in 1891 he declared himself to be the promised Mahdi or Messiah of the Muslim faith. Being a skilled theologian and dialectician, he soon won over a large number of people tO' his tenets. The Mirza was the author of many works in Arabic, Persian and Urdu, in which he combated the doctrines of Jahad, and these had a considerable influence among Muslims. His life was for many years a stormy one, as he was constantly involved in disputes and litigation with his religious opponents. But by the date of his death, which occurred in 1908, he had attained a position in which he commanded the respect even of those who disagreed with his views. ^ His attitude towards Government, throughout his life, remained one of impHcit loyalty and he enjoined upon his followers also to remain consistently loyal to Government. Mma Glmlaiu Ahmed was succeeded to his spiritual charge by Maulvi Nur-ud-diu. once a well-known physician, who had for some years been in the service of the Maharaja of Kashmir. The present spiritual head of the Ahmadiya community is Mirza Bashir-ud-din, who is the second son of the founder of the movement He occupies a very high position among his community, and the move- ment has g^^atly prospered under his guidance. During the Great War he helped the Government in various ways; and in the disturbances of 1919 he successfully kept his following loyal. The various Governors GUBDASPUB DISTBIGT. 87 of tLe Punjab subsequent to 1919 and the last three Viceroys testified in writing to liis loyalty and that of bis community. His younger brother, Mirza Bashir Ahmad, M.A., who is author of certan boohs, is in charge of the educational activities of the Ahmadiya community at Qadian. Another brother, Mirza Sharif Ahmad, is a Captain in the Indian Territorial Force and commands the Ahmadiya Double Com- pany, The cousin of the present head, Mirza Gul Muhammad, also served for some time as a Second Lieutenant in the above-mentioned Company. The Qadian family have considerably extended their landed estate by private purchase, and it now amounts to 1,500 acres, besides 2,500 acres in TaaVuqdari rights. These are in the Gurdaspur district, and in addition, the family owns 15 squares of land in the Montgomery district, and have acquired about 5,000 acres in Sind. Owing to the activities of the Ahmadiya community, the village of Qadian has greatly prospered and grown into a town, containing a number of educational and other institutions. They have there an oriental college, a training college for their missionaries, one high school for boys, another for girls, a technical school, a glass factory, an hosiery factory, a guest house (where some 200 guests are daily entertained), a hospital, two large printing presses, a central library and a few other institutions. Besides, the community is maintaining regular missions in England and several other places in America, Asia and Africa. The receipts of the central Ahmadiya treasur^^ at Qadian, consisting ot voluntary regular eontiibu- tions of the members of the sect amount to about seven lakhs of rupees annually.

Tlie Eandliawa tribe is of Eajput origin, and its founder was resident in Bikaner seven hundred years ago. Prom him have descended seven families, more or less distinguished in the history of the Punjab, namely,. Dharamkot, Ghanianki, BEeimiari, Doda, Dorangah or Talwandi, Eathu- Nangal and Ehunda. Some account of the five last of these families* will be given here, Ehunda now takes the highest rank, while Eathu- Ssangal, Dharamkot and Ghanianki are of little consideration at present. Little is known of Eandhawa, a Jadu Rajput, the ancestor from whom the tribe has derived its name. He was said to have been a great warrior, and his name ran, war, and dhawa, a local form of daurna, to- run, signifies his prowess ; but whether he was wont to run into the battle or away from it is nowhere recorded. If either he nor his im- mediate descendants left Bikaner; but Eajal, fifth in descent from Bandhawa, emigrated to the Punjab and settled near Batala,^ which had been founded some time before by Ram Deo, a Bhatti Rajput. baje been founded in 1466 A.D., but in reality its age is far greater, fo-ondations of the town about two miles jfrom the present site ; but every night excavation which he had dug during the day was filled un bv su-oema+nra I OT compeUed to change the sL of the to-wn, w£oh^ oaUed*^ importance tfll 1590, trhen Shamsher TCh..r. , who, zamono, rose to the governorship of the Manjha and the- +’ V tmdiings and a superb tank.

The Khundawalas belonged to the Kanhaya Misal, and till the death of Sardar Jai Singh Kanhaya in 1793 they kept possession of all their estates, worth nearly two lakhs of rupees; but Sada Xaur, widow of Jai Singh, and one of the ablest and most unscrupulous of her sex, taking advantage of some dissensions in the family, seized I^aushera and Hayatnagar Kalan. Still later, in the time of Sardar Prem Singh, Maharaja Ranjit Singh seized the whole of the estate, leaving only ten villages to the family, worth Rs. 6,000. Punjab Singh, father of Prem Singh, had married a daughter of 'N'odh Singh Majithia, whose son, Sardar Desa Singh, possessed at this time great influence with the Maharaja. He managed to have Prem Singh placed under him with his ten soivars ; and the young Sardar accordingly served with the Maharaja’s forces in many campaigns, including those of Multan and Peshawar. He was drowned on the 2nd ISTovember, 1824, when attempting, with the Maharaja’s army, to ford the Indus, then much swollen by the rains, in pursuit of the Gandgarh insurgents, who had attacked and defeated Hari Singh Ifalwa. The jagir was continued to his four sons on the same terms, namely, service of ten soivars in"
