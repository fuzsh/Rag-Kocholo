In this study, we interviewed 31 girls and 34 boys in grades 5 and 6 who attended an inclusive school in Saudi. The overarching research question was, \"How do Saudi children perceiveâ¦\n\nOutcome of stroke in Saudi children.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalih, Mustafa A; Abdel-Gader, Abdel-Galil M; Al-Jarallah, Ahmed A; Kentab, Amal Y; Al-Nasser, Mohammed N\n\n2006-03-01\n\nTo report on the prognosis, neurologic outcome, and recurrences of stroke in Saudi children. We evaluated a cohort of 104 Saudi children with stroke at the Division of Pediatric Neurology at King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). We analyzed the salient clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological, neuropsychological and laboratory data following retrieval from a specialty designed comprehensive protocol. Of the 104 children in the cohort (aged one month to 12 years), 5 (4.8%) died during the study period and 9 (8.7%) were lost to follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up for the remaining 90 children was 40 months (median 33 months). Recovery was judged complete in 6 (6.7%) of these 90 children. We detected residual hemiparesis (irrespective of its effect on daily functions) in 73 (81%) and this was combined with other motor deficits in 45 children (50%). Forty-one children (46%) had residual dysphasia or language deficits, whereas 45 (50%) were judged to have had cognitive deficit. Psychometry revealed an abnormal intelligence quotient test (<70) in 19 of 26 (73%) children. Other neurologic sequelae included epilepsy in 52 (58%), recurrent headaches in 13 (14%) and hydrocephalus in 4 (4.4%) patients. Six of the 95 (6.3%) children, who were ascertained to have died or kept their follow-up, had one or more recurrences, one month to 5 years after the initial stroke (median 23 months). Patients who had recurrent strokes were significantly more likely to be the product of consanguineous marriages (p=0.04). Regarding the group of 23 children with perinatal stroke, neither deaths nor recurrences occurred during the follow-up period. However, 20 (87%) of them had significant delays in their developmental milestones. The toll of stroke in Saudi children is demanding, with most children demonstrating persistent\n\nPrevalence and distribution of selected dental anomalies among saudi children in Abha, Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nYassin, Syed M\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDental anomalies are not an unusual finding in routine dental examination. The effect of dental anomalies can lead to functional, esthetic and occlusal problems. The Purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of selected developmental dental anomalies in Saudi children. The study was based on clinical examination and Panoramic radiographs of children who visited the Pediatric dentistry clinics at King Khalid University College of Dentistry, Saudi Arabia. These patients were examined for dental anomalies in size, shape, number, structure and position. Data collected were entered and analyzed using statistical package for social sciences version. Of the 1252 children (638 Boys, 614 girls) examined, 318 subjects (25.39%) presented with selected dental anomalies. The distribution by gender was 175 boys (27.42%) and 143 girls (23.28%). On intergroup comparison, number anomalies was the most common anomaly with Hypodontia (9.7%) being the most common anomaly in Saudi children, followed by hyperdontia (3.5%). The Prevalence of size anomalies were Microdontia (2.6%) and Macrodontia (1.8%). The prevalence of Shape anomalies were Talon cusp (1.4%), Taurodontism (1.4%), Fusion (0.8%).The prevalence of Positional anomalies were Ectopic eruption (2.3%) and Rotation (0.4%). The prevalence of structural anomalies were Amelogenesis imperfecta (0.3%) Dentinogenesis imperfecta (0.1%). A significant number of children had dental anomaly with Hypodontia being the most common anomaly and Dentinogenesis imperfecta being the rare anomaly in the study. Early detection and management of these anomalies can avoid potential orthodontic and esthetic problems in a child.

The objective of this report was to establish the national prevalence of short stature in Saudi children and adolescents. DESIGN AND SETTING: Community-based, cross-sectional study conducted over 2 years (2004, 2005) PATIENTS AND METHODS: The national data set of the Saudi reference was used to calculate the stature for age for children and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age. Using the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) reference, the prevalence of moderate and severe short stature was defined as the proportion of children whose standard deviation score for stature for age was less than -2 and -3, respectively. In addition, the 2000 Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the older 1978 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO references were used for comparison. RESULTS: Using the 2007 WHO reference, sample size in the Saudi reference was 19 372 healthy children and adolescents 5 to 17 years of age, with 50.8% being boys. The overall prevalence of moderate and severe short stature in boys was 11.3% and 1.8%, respectively; and in girls, 10.5% and 1.2%, respectively. The prevalence of moderate short stature was 12.1%, 11% and 11.3% in boys and 10.9%, 11.3% and 10.5% in girls when the 1978 WHO, the 2000 CDC and the 2007 WHO references were used, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The national prevalence of short stature in Saudi children and adolescents is intermediate compared with the international level. Improvement in the socioeconomic and health status of children and adolescents should lead to a reduction in the prevalence of short stature.

The objective of this report is to publish the L, M, and S parameters and percentiles as well as the corresponding growth charts for Saudi preschool children. Community-based survey and measurement of growth parameters in a sample selected by a multistage probability procedure. A stratified listing of the Saudi population. Raw data from the previous nationally-representative sample were reanalyzed using the Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) methodology to calculate the L, M, and S parameters of percentiles (from 3rd to 97th) for weight, length/height, head circumference, and body mass index-for-age, and weight for-length/height for boys and girls from birth to 60 months. Length or height and weight of Saudi preschool children. There were 15601 Saudi children younger than 60 months of age, 7896 (50.6 %) were boys. The LMS parameters for weight for age from birth to 60 months (5 years) are reported for the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, and 97th percentiles as well as the corresponding graphs. Similarly, the LMS parameters for length/height-for-age, head circumference-for-age, weight-for-length/height and body mass index-for-age (BMi) are shown with the corresponding graphs for boys and girls. Using the data in this report, clinicians and researchers can assess the growth of Saudi preschool children.

We evaluated children at the Division of Pediatric Neurology at King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). Investigations for suspected cases included neuroimaging, transcranial Doppler (TCD) for cases of sickle cell disease (SCD), and Duplex scan. Hemostatic assays included coagulation screening tests, tests of thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, coagulation inhibitors, and activated protein C resistance. During the study period, 104 Saudi children (aged one month to 12 years) with stroke were seen. The mean age of the cohort was 27.1 months (SD = 39.3 months) and median was 6 months. Ischemic strokes accounted for the majority of cases (76%). A major risk factor was identified in 93 of 104 cases of stroke (89.4%). Hematologic disorders were the most common (46.2%), followed by prothrombic disorders (31.7%); microcytic hypochromic anemia (26%); sickle cell disease (SCD), or SCbeta(0)-thalassemia, (11.5%), and factor IX deficiency (2.9%). Raised anticardiolipin antibodies (13/49, 26.5%) was the most frequent abnormality. Deficiencies of the natural anticoagulants (protein S, protein C and antithrombin III) were as follows: protein S (15/70, 21.4%); protein C (15/70, 21.4%) and combined deficiency of 2 or more inhibitors (9/70, 12.9%). Activated protein C resistance has not been detected. Contrary to the findings of previous studies from Saudi Arabia, SCD is a common risk factor and is severe, as it resulted in multiple strokes. Moyamoya syndrome was diagnosed in 2 patients with SCD, one of whom had revascularization surgery (encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis). Assessment of children with SCD at risk of stroke was helped by the introduction of TCD followed by neuroimaging, using MRI and magnetic resonance angiography. The\n\nServices for children with autism in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlnemary, Fahad M; Aldhalaan, Hesham M; Simon-Cereijido, Gabriela; Alnemary, Faisal M\n\n2017-07-01\n\nLittle information is available about autism spectrum disorder services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A sample of 205 parents completed an online survey about the use of autism spectrum disorder services for their children. The results revealed that on average, children began services by 3.3âyears. Most parents reported utilizing non-medical treatments followed by biomedical treatments and cultural and religious treatment. The age at the initiation of services and the type of treatments used differed by parent's income, educational attainment, the extent of knowledge about autism spectrum disorders, and geographic location. Some child characteristics also influenced the use of services. The disparities in service utilization in Saudi Arabia point to the need to develop policy and interventions that can mitigate the paucity of services for children with autism spectrum disorders. More research is needed to better understand service use and the decision-making processes that underlie treatment selection by parents of children with autism spectrum disorders in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nA systematic review of population-based dental caries studies among children in Saudi Arabia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAl Agili, Dania Ebrahim\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective Dental caries critically impacts the health and development of children. Understanding caries experience is an important task for Saudi Arabian policymakers to identify intervention targets and improve oral health. The purpose of this review is to analyze current data to assess the nationwide prevalence and severity of caries in children, to identify gaps in baseline information, and to determine areas for future research. Methods A search of published and unpublished studies in PubMed, Google, and local Saudi medical and dental journals was conducted for the three keywords âdental,â âcaries,â and âSaudi Arabia.â The inclusion criteria required that the articles were population-based studies that assessed the prevalence of dental caries in healthy children attending regular schools using a cross-sectional study design of a random sample. Results/discussion The review was comprised of one unpublished thesis and 27 published surveys of childhood caries in Saudi Arabia. The earliest study was published in 1988 and the most recent was published in 2010. There is a lack of representative data on the prevalence of dental caries among the whole Saudi Arabian population. The national prevalence of dental caries and its severity in children in Saudi Arabia was estimated to be approximately 80% for the primary dentition with a mean dmft of 5.0 and approximately 70% for childrenâs permanent dentition with a mean DMFT score of 3.5. The current estimates indicate that the World Health Organization (WHO) 2000 goals are still unmet for Saudi Arabian children. Conclusion Childhood dental caries is a serious dental public health problem that warrants the immediate attention of the government and the dental profession officials in Saudi Arabia. Baseline data on oral health and a good understanding of dental caries determinants are necessary for setting appropriate oral health goals. Without the ability to describe the current situation, it is not possible to\n\nGastroenteritis attributable to rotavirus in hospitalized Saudi Arabian children in the period 2007-2008.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhalil, Mohamed; Azhar, Esam; Kao, Moujahed; Al-Kaiedi, Noura; Alhani, Hatim; Al Olayan, Ibrahim; Pawinski, Robert; Gopala, Kusuma; Kandeil, Walid; Anis, Sameh; Van Doorn, Leen Jan; DeAntonio, Rodrigo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRotavirus (RV) is a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis (GE) in children across the world. As there is a lack of epidemiological data for RV gastroenteritis (RVGE) in Saudi Arabia, this hospital-based study was designed to estimate the disease burden of RVGE and assess the prevalent RV types in Saudi children younger than 5 years of age. Children hospitalized for acute GE were enrolled at four pediatric referral hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2008 and used the World Health Organization's generic protocol for RVGE surveillance. The Vesikari severity scale was used to assess the severity of RVGE. Stool samples were tested for RV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples were further typed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and hybridization assay for determining the G and P types. A total of 1,007 children were enrolled; the final analysis included 970 children, of whom 395 were RV positive, 568 were RV negative, and seven had unknown RV status. The proportion of RVGE among GE hospitalizations was 40.7% (95% confidence interval: 37.6-43.9). The highest percentage of RVGE hospitalizations (83.1%) was seen in children younger than 2 years of age. The highest proportion of RV among GE hospitalizations was in June 2007 with 57.1%. The most common RV types detected were G1P[8] (49.3%), G1G9P[8] (13.2%), and G9P[8] (9.6%). Before hospitalization, severe GE episodes occurred in 88.1% RV-positive and 79.6% RV-negative children. Overall, 94% children had recovered by the time they were discharged. Two children (one RV positive and one RV negative) died due to GE complications. RVGE is responsible for a high proportion of hospitalizations in Saudi children younger than 5 years of age. Routine RV vaccination has therefore been introduced into the national immunization program and may help reduce the morbidity, mortality, and disease burden associated with RVGE in Saudi Arabia.\n\nCharacteristics and dental experiences of autistic children in Saudi Arabia: cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurshid, Ebtissam Z\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to report base line information about characteristics, and dental experiences of a group of autistic children in three major cities of Saudi Arabia. Most of the children (76.2%) included in the study were diagnosed with autism before the age of 5 years. More than half of the children (53.7%) had no previous dental experience while 33% were treated under general anesthesia. The American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations should be applied in Saudi Arabia to help improve the average age of diagnosis and make a positive effect on children with autism and their families. Regular visits to dental clinics should be recommended to all families with autistic children to reduce dental disease.\n\nStroke in Saudi children. Epidemiology, clinical features and risk factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalih, Mustafa A; Abdel-Gader, Abdel-Galil M; Al-Jarallah, Ahmed A; Kentab, Amal Y; Alorainy, Ibrahim A; Hassan, Hamdy H; Bahakim, Hassan M; Kurbaan, Khadija M; Zahraa, Jihad N; Al-Nasser, Mohammed N; Nasir, Ali A; Khoja, Waleed A; Kabiraj, Mohammad M\n\n2006-03-01\n\nTo describe the epidemiology and clinical features of stroke in a prospective and retrospective cohort of Saudi children and ascertain the causes, pathogenesis, and risk factors. The Retrospective Study Group (RSG) included children with stroke who were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology, or admitted to King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period July 1992 to February 2001. The Prospective Study Group (PSG) included those seen between February 2001 and March 2003. During the combined study periods of 10 years and 7 months, 117 children (61 males and 56 females, aged one month-12 years) were evaluated; the majority (89%) of these were Saudis. The calculated annual hospital frequency rate of stroke was 27.1/100,000 of the pediatric (1 month-12 years) population. The mean age at onset of the initial stroke in the 104 Saudi children was 27.1 months (SD = 39.3 months) and median was 6 months. Ischemic strokes accounted for the majority of cases (76%). Large-vessel infarcts (LVI, 51.9%) were more common than small-vessel lacunar lesions (SVLL, 19.2%). Five patients (4.8%) had combined LVI and SVLL. Intracranial hemorrhage was less common (18.2%), whereas sinovenous thrombosis was diagnosed in 6 (5.8%) patients. A major risk factor was identified in 94 of 104 (89.4%) Saudi children. Significantly more hematologic disorders and coagulopathies were identified in the PSG compared to the RSG (p=0.001), reflecting a better yield following introduction of more comprehensive hematologic and coagulation laboratory tests during the prospective study period. Hematologic disorders were the most common risk factor (46.2%), presumed perinatal ischemic cerebral injury was a risk factor in 23 children (22.1%) and infectious and inflammatory disorders of the circulatory system in 18 (17.3%). Congenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies were the underlying cause in 7 patients (6.7%) and\n\nThe Impact of Word Walls on Improving the English Reading Fluency of Saudi Kindergarten's Children\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAlShaiji, Ohoud Abdullatif; AlSaleem, Basma Issa\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the impact of Word Walls on improving the English reading fluency of Saudi kindergarten's children. The present study attempted to answer whether there was a statistically significant difference (a = 0.05) between the Saudi children's subjects' mean score on the English reading fluency test due toâ¦\n\nCeliac disease presenting as rickets in Saudi children.\n\nPubMed\n\nAssiri, Asaad; Saeed, Anjum; AlSarkhy, Ahmed; El Mouzan, Mohammed Issa; El Matary, Wael\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRickets is commonly seen as a sign of malabsorption like celiac disease if it is not treated appropriately with vitamin D and calcium supplements. The aim of this study was to examine the frequency of diagnosis of celiac disease among children with unexplained rickets in Saudi children at a tertiary hospital setting. Retrospective review of records of patients referred over 10 years to a pediatric gastroenterology and hepatology unit. The study included all patients referred for evaluation of unexplained rickets and osteomalacia and screened for celiac disease. The diagnosis of rickets was made on the basis of history, physical examination, biochemical and radiological investigations. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made based on the ESPGHAN (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition) criteria. Twenty-six children with a mean (SD) age of 9.5 (4.6) years (5 males, range 1-15 years) were referred for evaluation of unexplained rickets and were screened for celiac disease. The diagnosis of celiac disease based on small bowel biopsy findings was confirmed in 10 (38.4%) patients with rickets. Serological markers for celiac disease including antiendomyseal antibodies and antitissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in all ten children. Rickets is not an uncommon presentation of celiac disease in Saudi children and pediatricians should consider celiac disease as an underlying cause for rickets.\n\nEmotional abuse among children: a study in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nElarousy, W; Al-Jadaani, M\n\n2013-10-01\n\nEmotional abuse is the most hidden and underestimated form of child maltreatment. We report an exploratory study in Saudi Arabia of the rate and types of emotional abuse among children and its association with selected variables. A convenience sample of 60 children aged 12-18 years was recruited from 3 malls in Jeddah. A specially designed, self-administered questionnaire was completed in confidence by the children with the consent of parents. Overall 90% of participants reported at least 1 form of rejecting emotional abuse and 61.7% at least 1 form of ignoring or terrorizing types of abuse. Chronic illness among parents was significantly positively correlated with terrorizing emotional abuse. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between mothers' relationship with the child and ignoring and terrorizing types of emotional abuse. Further research is needed about the community prevalence, correlates and consequences of child emotional abuse in Saudi Arabia.\n\nNormative data for IQ, height and head circumference for children in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBatterjee, Adel A; Khaleefa, Omar; Ashaer, Khalil; Lynn, Richard\n\n2013-07-01\n\nNormative data are reported for intelligence, height and head circumference for a sample of 1553 6- to 15-year-olds in Saudi Arabia, and for the correlations between these variables. Intelligence was tested with the Standard Progressive Matrices, on which the Saudi sample obtained a British IQ of 76.2. There were no significant differences in means between boys and girls and differences in variability were inconsistent. The heights of the Saudi sample were generally lower than those of the American norms. The differences in head circumferences between the Saudi children and the American norms were inconsistent. Correlations between IQ and height were weaker than those found in other studies but correlations between IQ and head circumference were positive.\n\nTelevision watching, diet and body mass index of school children in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlghadir, Ahmad H; Gabr, Sami A; Iqbal, Zaheen A\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWatching television has been widely associated with various health and psychological outcomes in children. Excessive intake of carbonated, sweetened beverages and fast foods, inadequate intake of fruit and dairy products; and reduced levels of physical activity also pose a risk to healthy lifestyle among youth. Limited literature is available, however, on the cross-cultural aspects of duration of television viewing, diet preferences and their effect on weight in school children in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia. We conducted an online survey in school children in Saudi Arabia (age 12-16 years) to determine whether there is any association between duration of daily television watching, body mass index (BMI), eating habits and diet preferences. A self-administered questionnaire was uploaded online and the link was sent to school children, inviting them to participate in the study. It included questions on demographic data; family medical status; daily routine in and after school; number of hours of daily TV watching, self-perception of health and daily diet habits and preferences. A total of 220 children aged between 12 and 16âyears participated in the present study. There was a higher duration of television viewing, and higher consumption of high-fat fast foods and high-sugar drinks, and this was significantly associated with BMI (Pâ<â0.05). The availability of television in children's bedrooms, and of high-fat foods and drinks at school and in other cafeterias in Saudi Arabia seems to be the major cause of the association between sedentary lifestyle and dietary habits, which needs to be checked and limited. Parents and teachers need to be trained because they can play a major role in its prevention. Saudi Arabia is a growing country banking on its youth. Their awareness can prevent the incidence and lower the prevalence of such ill health habits among them. Â© 2015 Japan Pediatric Society.\n\nPerinatal stroke in Saudi children. Clinical features and risk factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalih, Mustafa A; Abdel-Gader, Abdel-Galil M; Al-Jarallah, Ahmed A; Kentab, Amal Y; Alorainy, Ibrahim A; Hassan, Hamdy H; Al-Nasser, Mohammed N\n\n2006-03-01\n\nTo describe the clinical features and presentations of perinatal stroke in a prospective and retrospective cohort of Saudi children and ascertain the risk factors. Patients with perinatal stroke were identified from within a cohort of 104 Saudi children who were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology at King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). Neuroimaging for suspected cases of stroke consisted of cranial CT, MRI, or both. During the study period, 23 (22%) of 104 children (aged one month to 12 years) were diagnosed to have had perinatal stroke. The male:female ratio was 1.6:1. Ten (67%) of the 15 children who had unilateral ischemic involvement had their lesion in the left hemisphere. The presentation of the ischemic result was within 24-72 hours of life in 13 (57%) patients, and in 6 children (26%), motor impairment was recognized at or after the age of 4 months. Nine children (39%) had seizures at presentation. Pregnancy, labour, and delivery risk factors were ascertained in 18 (78%) cases. The most common of these included emergency cesarean section in 5 cases, and instrumental delivery in another 5. Screening for prothrombotic risk factors detected abnormalities in 6 (26%) patients on at least one test carried out between 2 months and 9 years of age. Four children (17%) had low protein C, which was associated with low protein S and raised anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) in one patient, and low antithrombin III in another. Low protein S was detected in a 42-month-old boy. The abnormality in the sixth child was confined to raised ACA.

As there is a lack of epidemiological data for RV gastroenteritis (RVGE) in Saudi Arabia, this hospital-based study was designed to estimate the disease burden of RVGE and assess the prevalent RV types in Saudi children younger than 5 years of age. Patients and methods Children hospitalized for acute GE were enrolled at four pediatric referral hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2008 and used the World Health Organizationâs generic protocol for RVGE surveillance. The Vesikari severity scale was used to assess the severity of RVGE. Stool samples were tested for RV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples were further typed by reverse transcriptaseâpolymerase chain reaction and hybridization assay for determining the G and P types. Results A total of 1,007 children were enrolled; the final analysis included 970 children, of whom 395 were RV positive, 568 were RV negative, and seven had unknown RV status. The proportion of RVGE among GE hospitalizations was 40.7% (95% confidence interval: 37.6â43.9). The highest percentage of RVGE hospitalizations (83.1%) was seen in children younger than 2 years of age. The highest proportion of RV among GE hospitalizations was in June 2007 with 57.1%. The most common RV types detected were G1P[8] (49.3%), G1G9P[8] (13.2%), and G9P[8] (9.6%). Before hospitalization, severe GE episodes occurred in 88.1% RV-positive and 79.6% RV-negative children. Overall, 94% children had recovered by the time they were discharged. Two children (one RV positive and one RV negative) died due to GE complications. Conclusion RVGE is responsible for a high proportion of hospitalizations in Saudi children younger than 5 years of age. Routine RV vaccination has therefore been introduced into the national immunization program and may help reduce the morbidity, mortality, and disease burden\n\nServices for Children with Autism in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAlnemary, Fahad M.; Aldhalaan, Hesham M.; Simon-Cereijido, Gabriela; Alnemary, Faisal M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLittle information is available about autism spectrum disorder services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

In Saudi Arabia, the size of this public health problem is not well defined especially among primary schoolchildren. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence and pattern of refractive errors among primary school children in Al Hassa, Saudi Arabia. Â A total of 2246 Saudi primary school children aged 6 to 14 years of both genders were selected using multistage sampling method form 30 primary schools located in the three different areas of Al Hassa. School children were interviewed to collect demographics and vision data using a special data collection form followed by screening for refractive errors by trained optometrists within the school premises using a standardized protocol. Assessment of visual acuity and ocular motility evaluation were carried out and cover-uncover test was performed. Children detected with defective vision were referred for further examination employing subjective refraction with auto refractometer and objective refraction using streak retinoscopy after 1% cyclopentolate. Of the screened school children (N=2002), the overall prevalence of refractive errors was 13.7% (n=274), higher among females (Odds ratio, OR=1.39, P=0.012) and significantly more among students of rural residence (OR=2.40, P=0.001). The prevalence of refractive errors was disproportionately more among those aged 12-14 years (OR=9.02, P=0.001). Only 9.4% of students with poor vision were wore spectacles for correction. Myopia was the most commonly encountered refractive error among both genders (65.7% of the total errors encountered). Uncorrected refractive errors affected a sizable portion of primary school children in Al Hassa, Saudi Arabia. Primary schoolchildren especially females, rural and older children represents high risk group for refractive errors for which the included children were unaware.\n\nPrevalence and Pattern of Refractive Errors among Primary School Children in Al Hassa, Saudi Arabia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWadaani, Fahd Abdullah Al; Amin, Tarek Tawfik; Ali, Ayub; Khan, Ataur Rahman\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSome 12.8 million in the age group 5â15 years are visually impaired from uncorrected or inadequately corrected refractive errors.

During the study period (January 2014-June 2016), we have conducted a cross-sectional, mass screening, immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase (TTG-IgA)-based study on 7930 Saudi students from primary and intermediate schools in Riyadh. Students with positive TTG-IgA (>20âU/L) were called in the hospital to undergo a repeat of TTG-IgA; in those with borderline positive TTG-IgA (20-60âU/L), IgA-endomyseal antibody (EMA-IgA) test was performed. Children with TTG-IgA >60âU/L and children with borderline positive TTG-IgA and positive EMA-IgA were advised to undergo upper endoscopy and intestinal biopsies. We identified 221 students with positive TTG-IgA (2.8%). CD was diagnosed in 119 cases (1.5%, 1:67 Saudi children) (mean age 11.5âÂ±â2.62 years; girls 81 [68%]). Another 51 children had persistently borderline positive TTG-IgA but negative EMA (0.64%) and the remaining 51 had transiently positive TTG-IgA. We have identified 3 clinical patterns in the screening-identified cases with CD: a silent form (37%), a mild symptomatic form characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms in presence of normal growth or overweight/obesity (48%), and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with impaired growth in 15%. Our study provided evidence of a high prevalence of CD among Saudi children (1.5%), a rate that is at least twice the average prevalence rate in Europe and North America.\n\nStroke due to mitochondrial disorders in Saudi children.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalih, Mustafa A; Abdel-Gader, Abdel-Galil M; Zahraa, Jihad N; Al-Rayess, Molham M; Alorainy, Ibrahim A; Hassan, Hamdy H; Ruitenbeek, Wim; Zeviani, Massimo\n\n2006-03-01\n\nTo report on the clinical and biochemical features of patients who presented with stroke due to mitochondrial disorders amongst a prospective and retrospective cohort of Saudi children. Children, who presented with stroke, were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology, or admitted to King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). Open muscle biopsies were obtained from patients suspected to have mitochondrial disorders, and examined using conventional histological and histochemical techniques. Biochemical, molecular pathological investigations, or both, of muscle could be arranged for only some of the patients. Mitochondrial disorders were the underlying risk factor for stroke in 4 (3.8%) of 104 children (aged one month to 12 years). Three patients (one male and 2 females) had Leigh syndrome (LS) and one had mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). At the time of stroke, the 3 children with LS were 11 months, 15 months, and 7 years old. They presented with psychomotor regression and seizures. Muscle histology and histochemistry showed mild non-specific changes but no ragged red fibers. Biochemical analysis of muscle (in one patient) revealed deficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), [the other 2 patients] was negative for the 2 point mutations (T-G and T-C) at nucleotide position 8993, and for two T-C point mutations (at positions 8851 and 9176 of the ATPase 6 gene) that have been described in patients with LS. The girl with MELAS syndrome presented with a stroke-like episode at the age of 29 months and had focal brain lesions in the medial aspect of the left occipital and temporal lobes, and in the posteromedial aspect of the left thalamus, which resolved within 7 weeks.

Children with cardiac diseases were identified from within a cohort of 104 Saudi children who presented with stroke. They were seen as inpatients in the Pediatric Wards or evaluated at the Outpatient Clinics of the Division of Pediatric Neurology (DPN), and the Division of Pediatric Cardiology at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). A comprehensive form for clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological and laboratory data retrieval was designed and completed for each patient. Cardiac evaluation included 12-lead ECG and serial echocardiograms. Cardiac catheterization and 24-hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) were conducted on clinical discretion. Cardiac diseases were the underlying risk factor for stroke in 6 (5.8%) of the 104 children (aged one month to 12 years). The patients (4 males and 2 females) were evaluated at the DPN at a mean age of 5.3 years (range = 1-8 years; median 6.5 years). Onset of stroke was at a mean age of 34 months (range = 4 months-8 years; median = 30 months). Five patients had stroke in association with congenital heart disease (CHD), whereas the sixth had restrictive cardiomyopathy. The identified CHD consisted of membranous ventricular septal defect in a 5-year-old boy who had moyamoya syndrome and sickle cell beta(0)-thalassemia, asymptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in a 17-month-old girl, atrioventricular canal defect and PDA in an 8-year-old boy who also had Down syndrome, partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage in a one-year-old boy, and Tetralogy of Fallot in an 8-year-old boy. The latter patient developed hemiparesis secondary to a septic embolus, which evolved into brain abscess involving the right fronto-parietal region\n\nSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status among Saudi children with and without a history of fracture.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Daghri, N M; Aljohani, N; Rahman, S; Sabico, S; Al-Attas, O S; Alokail, M S; Al-Ajlan, A; Chrousos, G P\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe significance of vitamin D deficiency in the incidence of bone fractures in children has been under investigated. Here, we aimed to associate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and fractures in Saudi children. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 1022 Saudi children without fracture history [476 boys (age 14.56Â Â±Â 1.81, BMI 22.38Â Â±Â 5.81) and 546 girls (age 13.57Â Â±Â 1.67, BMI 22.24Â Â±Â 4.94)] and 234 Saudi children with a history of fracture [148 boys (age 14.25Â Â±Â 1.39, BMI 22.66Â Â±Â 6.08) and 86 girls (age 13.76Â Â±Â 1.35, BMI 21.33Â Â±Â 1.35)]. Anthropometric and fasting serum biochemical data were collected. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was assessed using electrochemiluminescence. Mean circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin (25OH) D level in subjects with a history of fracture was significantly lower in both boys (pÂ <Â 0.01) and girls (pÂ <Â 0.01) than those without, however both groups had low mean 25(OH)D levels. Furthermore, age was positively associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D in boys (pÂ <Â 0.05) and negatively in girls (pÂ <Â 0.05) with a history of fracture. In conclusion, vitamin D levels were significantly lower in children with a history of bone fractures in both boys and girls than those without such a history; even in the absence of fracture history, vitamin D status correction is warranted in the general Saudi pediatric population.\n\nCharacteristics and Dental Experiences of Autistic Children in Saudi Arabia: Cross-Sectional Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMurshid, Ebtissam Z.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to report base line information about characteristics, and dental experiences of a group of autistic children in three major cities of Saudi Arabia.

Methods: A cross-sectional double-blinded pre-and post clinical study consisting of 2 parts; a survey targeting the parents, and a clinical oral examination of their ASD children was conducted between January and June of 2016. Results: A total of 40 children (75% males and 25% females) with an average age of 6.1 years were included. Approximately 47.5% children acted positively during the dental procedure. The dental book had a positive effect on the behavior of 37.5% children according to their parentsâ evaluation and highly effective in enhancing the parentsâ dental knowledge (67.5%). Conclusion: Parents expressed positive opinions regarding the use of preparatory aids in the dental environment. Approximately half of the ASD children benefit from the preparatory aid used according to the parentsâ opinion, and the follow up survey showed improvement in the parentâs dental knowledge and oral hygiene practices.

In this context, we aimed to determine whether the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is related to degree of physical activity and sun exposure among apparently healthy Saudi children and adolescents, a little studied population. Methods A total of 331 Saudi children aged 6â17âyears (153 boys and 178 girls) were included in this cross sectional study. Levels of physical activity and sun exposure were determined using a standard questionnaire. Anthropometry, serum calcium and 25-(OH) vitamin D were analyzed. Results All subjects were vitamin D deficient, the majority being moderately deficient (71.6%). Age was the single most significant predictor affecting 25 (OH) Vitamin D levels, explaining 21% of the variance perceived (pâ=â1.68 x 10-14). Age-matched comparisons revealed that for groups having the same amount of sun exposure, those with moderate or are physically active will have higher levels of vitamin D status, though levels in across groups remained deficient. Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency is common among Saudi children and adolescents, and is influenced by both sun exposure and physical activity. Promotion of an active outdoor lifestyle among Saudi children in both homes and schools may counteract the vitamin D deficiency epidemic in this vulnerable population. Vitamin D supplementation is suggested in all groups, including those with the highest sun exposure and physical activity.

The data from a national cohort of children newly diagnosed with IBD between 2003 and 2012 were analyzed. The diagnosis of IBD and the differentiation between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were confirmed by gastroenterologists according to the standard criteria. The body mass index (BMI) of each child [weight (kg)/height(2) (m)] was calculated at the time of diagnosis. The World Health Organization standards and references were used and the BMI for age > +1 and < -2 standard deviation score were used to define overweight and thinness, respectively. Age stratification analysis was performed to investigate any age-related variation in the prevalence of nutritional status between children < 10 years of age and older. There were 374 children from 0.33 to 17 years of age, including 119 (32%) children with UC and 255 (68%) with CD. All of the children were Saudi nationals, and 68 (57%) of the UC and 150 (59%) of the CD children were males. A positive history of anorexia at the time of diagnosis was found in 30 (25%) patients with UC and 99 (39%) patients with CD. The prevalence of thinness was 31%, 35% and 24% in children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, with a significantly higher prevalence of thinness in children with CD than in children with UC (P = 0.037) only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.030). The prevalence of overweight was 16 %, 15% and 20 % in the children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, indicating a higher prevalence in UC that was statistically significant only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.020). A high proportion of children with IBD presented with overweight instead of the classical underweight. Awareness of this finding is important for patient care.\n\nNutritional status of children with inflammatory bowel disease in Saudi Arabia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEl Mouzan, Mohammad Issa; Al Edreesi, Mohammed Hadi; Al-Hussaini, Abdulrahman Abdullah; Saadah, Omar Ibrahim; Al Qourain, Abdulaziz Abdullatif; Al Mofarreh, Mohammad Abdullah; Al Saleem, Khalid Abdulrahman\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM: To assess the prevalence of nutritional disorders in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Saudi Arabia.

Three hundred fifteen pre-school children with FPs (221 with normal growth (FP-N), 62 with failure to thrive (FTT) (FP-FTT), 32 with overweight (FP-OW)) and 100 healthy children (Ref group) underwent in-depth assessment by anthropometric measurements, dietetic history, Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale, Denver Developmental Screening test (DDST) and Stanford Binet fifth edition intelligence scales (SB-5). The main FPs detected in Saudi children were picky eating in 85.5% of FP-N group, infantile anorexia and poor eating in more than 90% of FP-FTT group and overeating in 53% of FP-OW group. FPs were not due to evident psychosocial factors but were mostly related to unhealthy feeding behaviours. FP-N children were still having normal growth parameters, but they had significantly lower growth parameters than healthy children. Failed screening with DDST was only more significantly recorded in FP-FTT children than in Ref children (P = 0.04). The overall IQ value by SB-5 was significantly lower in FP-FTT group compared with FP-N group (P = 0.01), in FP-FTT group compared with Ref group (P < 0.001) as well as in FP-OW group compared with Ref group (P < 0.001). Persistent FPs resulted in significant negative impact not only on growth status but also on developmental milestones and cognitive functions of pre-school children. Healthy feeding habits are mandatory to prevent serious consequences of FPs on growth and development of Saudi pre-school children. Â© 2015 The Authors.

Children, who presented with stroke, were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology or admitted to King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). Investigations for suspected cases included hemostatic assays, microbiological and serological tests. Neuroimaging included cranial CT, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scan. Of the 104 Saudi children with stroke, seen during the combined study periods of 10 years and 7 months, infectious and inflammatory disorders of the circulatory system were the identified risk factor in 18 (17.3%). Five children had stroke following acute bacterial meningitis at ages ranging between 5-21 months. The causative organism was identified in 3 of them and consisted of Haemophilus influenzae (in a 5-month-old girl), Streptococcus pneumoniae (in a 21-month-old girl complicated by subdural empyema and sinovenous thrombosis), and Staphylococcus aureus in a 6-month-old boy who had an underlying chronic granulomatous disease. Unspecified meningitis/meningoencephalitis affected 4 patients, whereas 3 children had an underlying congenital infection as a cause for their stroke. Two of the latter 3 children were diagnosed to have congenital toxoplasmosis, and the third had congenital rubella syndrome. Two girls had stroke following septicemia at ages of one and 2 months. Neurobrucellosis caused stroke in 2 boys at the ages of 4 1/2 and 4 years.

Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional study of 145 healthy Saudi children aged 10â15 years who were born and lived permanently at high altitude (3000â3100 m) and 154 healthy Saudi children of comparable age who were born and lived permanently at a relatively low altitude (500 m) was conducted. For each subject selected, body weight and body height were measured using an Avery beam weighing scale and a stadiometer, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the equation BMI = (weight [kg]/height [m2]). Physical activity scores were determined using International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form-A. Resting radial pulse rate (beat/minutes) was determined clinically. Results: Physical activity was significantly and inversely associated with overweight and obesity in boys at both high (Ï2 = 15.8, P< 0.001) and low (Ï2 = 14.7, P< 0.001) altitudes, but there was no clear trend for girls at either altitude. The lack of association between physical activity and overweight and obesity in girls was attributed to the low and homogeneous level of physical activity. Conclusion: Physical activity should be encouraged as a strategy for weight reduction in the overweight and the obese and the prevention of overweight and obesity in Saudi children at high and low altitudes.

Three hundred eighty-eight preschool children between 3 and 5Â years old were selected from 10 different schools using a cluster random sample selection; there were 184 (47%) boys and 204 (53%) girls. The surfaces of each tooth were examined for erosion, and the level of tooth wear was recorded. Data on the frequently used beverages and snacks were obtained by questionnaires completed by the parents of the preschool children. Among the 388 children examined, 47% exhibited low erosion, 10% exhibited moderate erosion and 4% exhibited severe erosion. There was no statistically significant difference between boys and girls in terms of the prevalence of erosion. Sixty percent of the children regularly consumed juice drinks. Among daily consumers, 84% of children showed erosion prevalence with strongly significant association (pâ<â0.005). Holding the drink in the mouth also showed a significant association with erosion (pâ<â0.02). It was concluded that an association was found between the prevalence of dental erosion and the frequencyÂ of citrus and carbonated juice consumed by the preschool children in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Comorbidity of ADHD in the General Population of Saudi Arabian School-Age Children\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAlqahtani, Mohammed M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective: To investigate comorbidity of oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), anxiety, and depression and to investigate the impaired social and academic developments among children with ADHD in primary school settings in Saudi Arabia.

We evaluated the current age at menarche and reproductive events among Saudi women. Age, age at menarche, age at marriage, age of first pregnancy, number of children, and number of abortions were collected for Saudi women attending King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) over a 3-month period in 2002. For 989 Saudi women, the mean age at menarche was 13.05 years. There was a decrease in the age of menarche over the past 20 years, an increase in the age of marriage, age of first pregnancy, and a decrease in the number of children and abortions. Compared with data from two decades, the age at menarche decreased significantly from 13.22 to 13.05 years. The decrease in the age of menarche among Saudi women indicates better socioeconomic status and improvements in health.\n\nParents' Perceptions of Early Interventions and Related Services for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Saudi Arabia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAlotaibi, Faihan; Almalki, Nabil\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe present study sought to examine parents' perceptions of early interventions and related services for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Saudi Arabia.

We aimed to investigate vitamin D status and its association with consumption frequencies of various dairy products in Saudi population. Subjects consisted of 820 children (327 boys; mean age 14.9 yrs and 493 girls; 14.8 yrs) and 565 adults (249 men, 27.9 yrs and 316 women 32.2 yrs). We estimated the consumption frequencies of various dairy food products (fresh milk, powdered milk, laban, yoghurt and cheese) using a qualitative food frequency questionnaire and serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D). Associations between variables of interest were assessed by Pearson correlation analysis. Among the study subjects, 80% boys, 90% girls, 64% men and 50% women had deficient/insufficient levels of vitamin D. Modest associations were found between mean serum 25 (OH) D concentration and fresh milk consumption in children (r=0.11) (especially in girls (r=0.12)), and overall dairy products consumption in women (r=0.12). Results indicated widespread vitamin D deficiency in Saudi Arabian children and adults. High level of vitamin D deficiency and a lack of strong correlation between dairy product consumption and serum level of vitamin D imply a need for adequate fortification of milk and other dairy products with vitamin D.\n\nCongenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies as risk factors for stroke in Saudi children.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalih, Mustafa A; Murshid, Waleed R; Zahraa, Jihad N; Abdel-Gader, Abdel-Galil M; Al-Jarallah, Ahmed A; Kentab, Amal Y; Alorainy, Ibrahim A; Hassan, Hamdy H; Tjan, Giap T\n\n2006-03-01\n\nTo explore the role of and report on congenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies as risk factors for stroke in a prospective and retrospective cohort of Saudi children. Children with stroke were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology (DPN), or were seen as inpatients in the Pediatric Wards at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). Stroke work-up for each suspected case included hemostatic assays, serological, biochemical and neurophysiological tests. Neuroimaging modalities included routine skull x-rays, CT, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and conventional cerebral angiography. Of 104 children with stroke, congenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies were the underlying risk factor in 7 (6.7%). The patients were evaluated at the DPN at a mean age of 66 months (range = 8 months to 11 years, median = 6 years); and they had stroke at a mean age of 48 months (range = 2 months to 10 years, median = 8 months). Four patients had stroke in association with neurocutaneous syndromes. Two had Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), one had Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome associated with SWS, and the fourth had neurofibromatosis type 1. Two patients had intracranial hemorrhage secondary to ruptured aneurysm. A girl (aged 9 years and 4 months) had left posterior cerebral artery aneurysm. She was diagnosed to have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease following renal ultrasonography. She died 5 months later despite surgical intervention (clipping of aneurysm). The second child was an 8-month-old boy who presented with subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) following ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. He recovered with no residual symptoms following successful clipping of the aneurysm. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) caused IVH in a 7-year-old boy who reported to hospital 5 hours\n\nStroke from systemic vascular disorders in Saudi children.

The main objective of SINA is to have guidelines that are up to date, simple to understand and easy to use by nonasthma specialists, including primary care and general practice physicians. SINA approach is mainly based on symptom control and assessment of risk as it is the ultimate goal of treatment. The new SINA guidelines include updates of acute and chronic asthma management, with more emphasis on the use of asthma control in the management of asthma in adults and children, inclusion of a new medication appendix, and keeping consistency on the management at different age groups. The section on asthma in children is rewritten and expanded where the approach is stratified based on the age. The guidelines are constructed based on the available evidence, local literature, and the current situation in Saudi Arabia. There is also an emphasis on patientâdoctor partnership in the management that also includes a self-management plan.

Women answered questions on oral health knowledge during pregnancy and knowledge of infant oral health. Most women (> 70%) knew that dental caries in children can be prevented, that pregnancy affects oral health and that dental treatment during pregnancy can negatively affect infants. Most women (> 80%) performed oral hygiene procedures but only 18% regularly visited the dentist. In a regression analysis, oral health knowledge was not significantly associated with reported oral hygiene practices. Women who visited the dentist regularly were more likely to know how to prevent caries in children, and that dental treatment during pregnancy and infant health were associated.\n\nMoyamoya syndrome as a risk factor for stroke in Saudi children. Novel and usual associations.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalih, Mustafa A; Murshid, Waleed R; Al-Salman, Mussaad M; Abdel-Gader, Abdel-Galil M; Al-Jarallah, Ahmed A; Alorainy, Ibrahim A; Hassan, Hamdy H; Kentab, Amal Y; Van Maldergem, Lionel; Othman, Saleh A; El-Desouki, Mahmoud I; Elgamal, Essam A\n\n2006-03-01\n\nTo report on moyamoya syndrome (MMS) as a risk factor for stroke in a prospective and retrospective cohort of Saudi children. The usual and novel associations of MMS in this cohort will also be described. Children with stroke were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology at King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study). Investigations for suspected cases included hemostatic assays, biochemical, and serological tests. Neuroimaging included CT, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), single photon computerized tomography (SPECT) brain scan and conventional cerebral angiography. Moyamoya syndrome was the underlying risk factor for stroke in 6 (5.8%) of the 104 children (aged one month to 12 years). They were 4 females and 2 males. Their first cerebral ischemic event occurred at a mean age of 45 months (median = 44 months, range 17-66 months). In all 6 cases, MMS was associated with an underlying hematologic abnormality or other diseases. Protein C deficiency was identified in one girl and protein S deficiency in another. Two patients had respectively, sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell-beta-thalassemia (S beta-thalassemia), which had been associated in the latter with membranous ventricular septal defect. Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS, OMIM 100300) was associated with MMS in an 18-month-old girl. A 4-year-old boy had wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS, OMIM 278250) phenotype. The association of MMS and protein C deficiency was first reported in this cohort of patients, whereas the association of the syndrome with WWS and AOS has not, hitherto, been described. The 3 patients who had MMS associated with protein C deficiency, SCD, and AOS underwent successful revascularization surgery in the form of encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis.

The risk of sedentary behavior will likely increase as the number of women with office-based jobs increases. The aim of this study is to determine the level of sedentary behavior, and its associated factors, among Saudi women working office-based jobs in the city of Riyadh. A cross-sectional study of 420 Saudi female employees at 8 office-based worksites were measured to determine body mass index and were given a self-administered survey to evaluate their level of physical activity and sedentary behavior. Median sitting time on work days was 690 min per day (interquartile range, IQR 541â870), with nearly half accumulated during work hours, and 575 min per day (IQR 360â780) on non-work days. Predictors of work day sitting time were level of education, number of children, and working in the private sector. Number of children, whether they were single, and whether they lived in a small home were found to predict non-work day sitting time. This study identifies Saudi women in office-based jobs as a high-risk group for sedentary behavior. There is a need to promote physical activity at worksites and reduce prolonged sitting.

The required information was collected through a especially designed questionnaire. A total of 130 children completed the questionnaire with the mean age of 13.3 (SD 1.9) years. There was no significant difference in oral health knowledge or sources of information in relation to age and educational level. Less than half (44.6%) of the children actually had heard about fluoride, one-third (34.6%) correctly identified the action of fluoride as preventing tooth decay. Almost all (97.2%) the children thought that sweets (chocolates/candies) could cause tooth decay. However, a large number of children were not aware of cariogenic potential of soft drinks (31.5%). More than half (53.1%) of the children reported that their dentist taught them how to brush properly. However, 11.5% children were not taught by any one about proper tooth-brushing. A large number (40.0%) of children thought that one must visit the dentist only in case of pain in the teeth. Dentists were the most popular (61.5%) source of oral health information. It can be concluded that the children need further oral health education in areas of caries prevention, and there was a need to utilise parents, schoolteachers and media to enhance their oral health knowledge.\n\nTraditional practices and other socio-cultural factors affecting the health of children in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdullah, M A\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe medical services in Saudi Arabia have improved tremendously over the last two decades, and health centres are easily accessible to more than 93% of the population. Nevertheless, folk medicine, including cautery, bone setting, manual tonsillectomy, uvulectomy, use of herbal medicines and use of harmful teething powders, in addition to religious healing, is widely practised. Reasons include influence of grandparents, religious beliefs and failure of modern medicine to find an answer to some chronic disorders. These problems, and measures to counteract them, are discussed. Attention is also drawn to some of the harmful 'imported' practices that are affecting the health of children, including smoking, children driving cars and problems resulting from dependence on housemaids to bring up children. Some nutritional beliefs and taboos are also mentioned.\n\nThe prevalence of crowding, attrition, midline discrepancies and premature tooth loss in the primary dentition of children in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlamoudi, N\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe aim of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of crowding, attrition, midline discrepancies and premature loss of primary molars in primary dentition of children resident in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Five hundred and two (502) children aged 4-6 years old residing in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia provide the data for the analysis. Crowding was found in 14.7% of the subjects crowding in the maxilla occurred in 27 (5.4%) of the children, and 67 (13.4%) in the mandible. Simultaneous crowding in maxilla and mandible was present in 20 (3.98%) of the subject. The prevalence of crowding was significantly higher in the mandible than the maxilla (P > 0.01) and higher in male (P < 0.05). Midline shift was present in 10% of the children with females showing a significantly higher prevalence than the males (P < 0.001). Attrition was present in 167 (33.3%) of the children. One hundred and sixty children (31.9%) had attrition in enamel, and only 7(1.4%) had attrition, which exposed the dentin. Thirty-one (6.2%) out of 502 children had 51 (0.5%) missing teeth out of total number of 10,040 teeth. Tooth #84 was most commonly lost tooth (P < .025). Overall premature loss of 1st primary molars was found to be significantly higher than 2nd primary molars (P < .001).\n\nEmergence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia nosocomial isolates in a Saudi children's hospital.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the reference broth microdilution method.Â Â Results: In this study, 48 (75%) isolates were identified in true infections and 16 (25%) isolates were considered colonization. The main types of S. maltophilia infection were pneumonia in 22 (45.8%) patients and bloodstream infection in 14 (29.2%) patients. The significant risk factors included exposure to invasive procedure (p=0.02), and presence of acute leukemia as an underlying disease (p=0.02). The most active antimicrobials were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100% sensitivity) and tigecycline (93.7% sensitivity).Â Conclusions: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen among pediatric patients. Accurate identification and susceptibility testing of this emerging pathogen are crucial for the management of infected patients and prevention of spread of this nosocomial pathogen.\n\nSaudi Arabian Teachers' Knowledge and Beliefs about ADHD\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAbed, Mohaned; Pearson, Susan; Clarke, Paula; Chambers, Mary\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is considered one of the most frequently diagnosed psychiatric childhood disorders.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted in Saudi Arabia in July 2010. One hundred and eighty-six children exposed to the South war in Jazan, and 157 unexposed children in King Khaled Military City, Hafr Al Batin were studied for evidence of malnutrition using physical measures, evaluating psychological problems using the Child Behavior Inventory, behavioral problems using the Rutter Scale A2, family adjustment using the McMaster Family adjustment device, and for psychiatric disorders. The association of different socioeconomic variables with the psychological outcome of the exposed group was also studied. The exposed children were well nourished, had more anxiety (p=0.044), better adaptation (p<0.001), less aggression (p=0.025), less deviant behavior (p=0.007), better family adjustment and had more post traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety, nightmares, and grief reaction. In the exposed children, females had more anxiety (p=0.006), and males had more antisocial behavior (p=0.02). Older children had less deviant behavior (p=0.005), better adaptation (p=0.007) and better planful behavior (p<0.001). Children of elder mothers had better planful behavior (p=0.039). Children from bigger families were less aggressive (p=0.049), and had less antisocial behavior (p=0.04). This study found that children exposed to the Jazan war had more anxiety. Unexpectedly they were well nourished and had higher adaptation, lower antisocial behavior, and better family adjustment.

The aim of the present study was to identify levels of glycemic control, risk factors and predictors of uncontrolled hyperglycemia (HG) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children with T1DM. A retrospective study was performed on Saudi children and adolescents with confirmed T1DM who were followed at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic of the Maternity and Children Hospital, Jeddah, from 2000 to 2014. Data collection included all possible factors that may be associated with uncontrolled T1DM. Patients were classified according to American Diabetes Association guidelines for target HbA1c levels per age group. Comparisons were made between well-controlled (WC) patients, HG patients, and DKA patients. Calculation of odds ratios and logistic regression allowed for estimation of the role of each risk factor in uncontrolled T1DM. Only 31.2Â % of children and adolescents with T1DM were well controlled. Better glycemic control was associated with ageÂ <Â 6âyears, urban residence, and T1DM duration <5âyears. Glycemic control was not affected by gender, insulin therapy, or comorbidities. The most significant independent predictors of hyperglycemia and DKA were poor compliance with a healthy lifestyle (adjusted hazards ratio [AHR] 28.94; 95Â % confidence interval [CI] 8.37-100.04) and an excess intake of sweets (AHR 3.31; 95Â % CI 1.54-7.11). The most significant independent predictor for poor glycemic control (particularly DKA rather than hyperglycemia) in Saudi children and adolescents was poor compliance with a healthy lifestyle with an excessive intake of sweets.

Data were especially limited on the pediatric safety of H1N1 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. The objectives of this study were to investigate the safety of the H1N1 vaccine (Pandemrix(Â®)) in children and examine the feasibility of obtaining information on possibly associated adverse reactions using mobile telephone contact with child caregivers. A cohort study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients were included if they were aged between 6 and 18 years and had received one dose of the H1N1 vaccine. A control group involved children from the same school system who had not received the vaccine. Six months following vaccination, a clinical pharmacist called the caregiver of the child to ask about hospitalization, emergency room visits and events related to H1N1 vaccine administration using a standardized questionnaire. Caregivers of 372 school-age children were contacted. The response rate was 97% (n = 359). A total of 169 children who received at least one dose of the H1N1 vaccine were compared with 190 children in the control group who had not received the vaccine. Controlling for age, sex, education and use of medications, the odds ratio (OR) of hospitalization or emergency room visits for children within the 6 months after vaccination relative to the unvaccinated children was 1.25 (95% CI 0.47, 3.35). The risk of influenza-like symptoms was significantly reduced in vaccinated children compared with unvaccinated children (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.41, 0.99). School-age children in Saudi Arabia who received the H1N1 vaccine did not have an increased risk of hospitalization or emergency room visits. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results. Proactive pharmacovigilance is important in assessing the safety of vaccines and other medications. It is feasible to collect information on adverse drug reactions using mobile telephones, a method that can be of benefit in\n\nKnowledge and attitudes towards AIDS among Saudi and non-Saudi bus drivers.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdelmoneim, I; Khan, M Y; Daffalla, A; Al-Ghamdi, S; Al-Gamal, M\n\n2002-11-01\n\nWe explored the AIDS knowledge and attitudes of long-distance (non-Saudi) and in-city (Saudi) bus drivers in Saudi Arabia. The 69 non-Saudi drivers tended to score higher on knowledge than the 40 Saudi drivers although there were several gaps in their knowledge. As regards attitude, more Saudis knew that chastity could protect against AIDS and both groups tended to think that they were not the kind of people to get AIDS. Intensive health education and follow up is highly recommended for this sector of workers.\n\nCeliac disease in Saudi children. Evaluation of clinical features and diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaeed, Anjum; Assiri, Asaad; Assiri, Hebah; Ullah, Anhar; Rashid, Mohsin\n\n2017-09-01\n\nÂ Objectives: To characterize the clinical presentations and diagnosis including serological tests and histopathological findings in children with celiac disease.Â Methods: All children (less than 18 years) with confirmed celiac disease diagnosed over a 6 year period at a private tertiary care health care center in Riyadh,Â Â Saudi Arabia were studied retrospectively. Information collected included demographics, clinical presentation and diagnostic modalities with serology and small intestinal histology reported by Marsh grading.Â Results: A total of 59 children had confirmed celiac disease. Thirty (50.8%) were male. Median age was 8 years (range 1 to 16 years). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 2.3 (Â±1.5) years. Classical disease was present only in 30.5%, whereas 69.5% had either non-classical presentations or belonged to high risk groups for celiac disease such as those with type-1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, Down syndrome and siblings. Failure to thrive was the most common presentation followed by short stature, abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody was positive in 91.5%, and titers were no different between those with classical and non-classical disease. All had Marsh-graded biopsy findings consistent with celiac disease.Â Conclusion: Children with celiac disease usually present with non-classical features. A high index of suspicion needs to be maintained to consider this disorder in the diagnostic workup of pediatric patients. High risk group should be screened early to avoid complications associated with untreated celiac disease.\n\nPattern of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome in children living in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia: a single center stud"
