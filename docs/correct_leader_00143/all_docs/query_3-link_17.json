It dominates the Badaran People's Movement (HSB) and has been accused of building a family dictatorship in Badara.The family is led by current Prime Minister Yasser Qahtani and his wife Aisha, a Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nOrigins[]\n\nThe Qahtanis are a branch of the al-Jabiri family (with unbroken male descent) The first Qahtani was Qahtan, who after falling out with his family, changed his last name to Qahtani. He had a large family which soon spread all over Marakesh but the family's main seat has always been in Bier Qassem. The family remained relatively obscure until Yasser Qahtani gained some fame as a nationalist author and the family became infamous when Qahtani founded and led the HSB to power.\n\nMembers[]\n\nThe PM's father, Juma Qahtani was the last surviving male in the family. He had three sons (Yasser, Najib and Seif) and two daughters (Amira, Fatima) by his wife, Mariam.\n\nYasser Qahtani[]\n\nHe is married to Aisha and they have two sons (Muawiyah and Hasim) and two daughters (Mariam and Sanaa)\n\nNajib Qahtani[]\n\nHe is married to Rawya and they have one daughter, Razia\n\nPolitics[]\n\nThe entire family is heavily involved in politics. Since the Badaran People's Movement took office in 3566, the family has monopolised all the major offices of state.\n\nFirst Qahtani Cabinet[]\n\nThe Prime Ministership, Interior, Finance, Education and Industry ministries are all under the control of Qahtani. Both DPMs are linked to the family, the first is Yasser's son-in-law Harun al-Jabiri (who also serves as Foreign Minister) while the second is Aisha, Yasser's wife who also serves as Education Minister\n\nWealth[]\n\nSince entering politics, the collective wealth of the Qahtani family is said to have risen from around 17 million BDR to around 32 billion BDR. The family is often accused of intmidation and forcible buying of enterprises and extreme anti-comptetition measures."
