Van De Lande, Richard W F Breakey, Alessandro Borghi, Justine O’hara, Gregory James, Juling L Ong, Richard D Hayward, Silvia Schievano, David J Dunaway, N U Owase Jeelani UCL Institute of Child Health and Craniofacial Unit Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK OBJECTIVE:Spring-assisted Posterior Vault Expansion (PVE) is another technique for calvarial vault expansion. Advantages include its less invasive technique and reduced morbidity, with potential drawbacks due to the need for a second procedure for spring removal and the lack of available long-term follow-up data. Since 2008, at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London (GOSH) the majority of patients requiring vault have been treated with PVE. MATERIAL-METHODS:Data from all patients treated with PVE at GOSH were collected for analysis on: diagnosis, gender, indication for PVE, previous craniofacial procedures, CSF and ICP bolt procedures, age at surgery, operation and anesthetic time, hospital stay, blood transfusion requirements, time of springs in situ, number of springs used, additional (cranio)facial procedures, and complications. RESULTS:Since 2008, a total of 177 cases underwent PVE (158 patients, 94M:64F). 139 patients underwent a single PVE at a mean age of 24.6 months; of these, 15 had a previous craniofacial procedure and 19 required additional (esthetic) procedures. In 13 patients, PVE was repeated at an average age of 35.8 months old - 1 had a previous craniofacial procedure and 1 needed an additional rigid expansion. PVE was indicated in 80% for raised intracranial pressure (RICP), in 3% for prevention of RICP and in 17% for esthetic rea- sons. Average operation time was 143 minutes for a first PVE and 188 for a redo. Blood transfusion was needed in 65% of patients when springs were inserted and in 21% at time of spring removal. For the latter group, 32 patients underwent Fronto-Orbital Remodelling and 78% needed a blood transfusion. Average hospital stay was 3 nights (range 0-203). Complications occurred in 23 patients: 1 death, 3 cases with Oxford Grade 4, and the rest Grade 1 to 3. CONCLUSION:Based on our experience, PVE with springs remains our procedure of choice for a select patient group.

This study aims at assessing the cranio-orbital complex changes related to the severity of skull-base dysmorphology in patients with unicoronal synostosis. MATERIAL-METHODS:24 infants affected by unicoronal synostosis were subdivided in three subgroups according to the severity of skull- base deformity and their high-resolution CT images were quantitatively analyzed (groups IIa,IIb, III). Dimensions of cranial fossae, intracranial volume (ICV), ICV synostotic and ICV non synostotic side, whole brain volume (WBV), orbital volumes (OV), ICV/WBV, ICVsynostotic /ICVnon-synostotic and OVsynostotic/OVnon-synostotic were evaluated. RESULTS:Asymmetry and reduction in the growth of the anterior and mid- dle fossae were found in all groups while asymmetry of the posterior cranial fossa was found only in IIb and III groups. In all groups ICV, WBV, ICV/ WBV were not significantly different while ICVsynostotic/ICVnon- synostotic and OVsynostotic/OVnon-synostotic resulted significantly differ- ent (p<0.05). ICVsynostotic side resulted reduced only in group III. OVon the synostotic side was not significantly reduced although a trend in progressively reducing volumes was noted according to the severity of the group. CONCLUSION:Skull and orbital changes revealed a side-to-side asym- metry but the effects of the premature synostosis were more severe in group III suggesting an earlier timing of premature unicoronal synostosis in group III respect the other groups. The assessment of the skull base deformity might be an indirect parameter of severity of skull-orbital changes and it might be useful for the surgical planning Keywords: anterior plagiocephaly, coronal suture PF-004 Ten years review of « H craniectomy » technique for sagittal synostosis in 436 patients – evaluation of surgical aspects, aesthetic and cognitive out- come Giovanna Paternoster, Samer Haber, Syril James, Roman Hossein Khonsari, Federico Di Rocco, Dominique Renier, Eric Arnaud Craniofacial Unit, Hopital Necker enfant malades, Paris, France OBJECTIVE: “ H craniectomy ”– open approach with partial craniectomy- represents one of the principal surgical techniques for Child's Nervous System https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-019-04316-8\n\nscaphocephaly treatment. Several variations and mini invasive ap- proaches have been proposed in the last years. This is the largest long-term retrospective outcome study aiming to evaluate this technique. MATERIAL-METHODS:Between 2008 and 2018, 567 patients underwent H craniectomy for sagittal synostosis correction in a single center (Necker Hospital, Paris). 476 patients were included. Several pa- rameters were analyzed: removal of coronal sutures, cranial index (pre- operative and late post-operative), associated closure of metopic suture at surgery, late postoperative fusion of coronal sutures and presence of copper-beaten appearance in imaging. The aesthetic outcome was evalu- ated using a Whitaker scale by one single surgeon. The presence of cognitive problems was recorded. RESULTS:64% patients were operated before 6 months of age, 30.5% were operated between 6 months and 1 year of age, and 5.5% were operated after 1 year of age. Mean follow-up was 5.6 years (range 0.2 – 10.4). Mean cranial index was 70 preoperatively and 73 postoperatively. 58.4% presented radiologic fusion of the coronal sutures at late follow-up and imaging showed 17.3% with copper-beaten appearance on late follow-up imaging. 19% presented an insufficient aesthetic result (Whitaker III or IV). 2.1% had pap- illary oedema at some point during their follow-up. 27.7% reported headaches at some point of their follow-up. 75% had no reported cognitive problems and 5.4% presented a cognitive or language impairment needing professional assistance. 7 (1.5%) patients had surgical revision.The comparison between the classic technique and the surgical variant where coronal sutures were removed did not show any statistically significant differences in cognitive (p=0.633), aesthetic (p=0.782) or radiologic (p=0.461) outcomes. CONCLUSION:H craniectomy is a safe and effective procedure. Removal of coronal sutures did not change the incidence of secondary coronal fusion, aesthetic and functional outcomes.

The GOSH team has till date separated 3 sets of twins. We present here our cumulative experience of the 3 sets with particular emphasis on the ‘lessons learnt’ in planning and execution of the separation. MATERIAL-METHODS:Three sets of craniopagus twins underwent separation at GOSH. All 3 sets were of the O’Connell Total Vertical configuration. The 2006 case (CPT 1) was a Type 1, the 2011 case (CPT 2) a Type 3 and the 2019 set (CPT 3) a Type 2 configuration. Staged separation was undertaken in all 3 cases spanning some 6 months for each case. Neurovascular separation was undertaken first and once completed, tissue expanders were inserted and the final separation under- taken. For planning the separation cross-sectional imaging, MR flow studies, Digital subtraction angiograms, 3D photogrammetry, finite ele- ment modelling, rapid prototyping, 3 D modelling, computer simulations and virtual reality holograms were utilized. RESULTS:The 6 twins survived the separation process.From CPT 1 both girls are diagnosed on the ADHD spectrum and require extra support at school. One twin has a mild weakness on one side; she is ambulant and able to use her affected arm for gross motor skills.From CPT 2 one twin is on the ASD spectrum.From CPT 3, one twin suffered a venous infarct resulting in a weakness in her left arm and leg. Follow up is short to comment on final recovery and cognitive outcome.All 3 sets presented with Cardiac and Renal compromise which deteriorated during the sepa- ration process and settled upon final separation. CONCLUSION:Staged separation has a lower morbidity and mortality profile for Craniopagus twins of the total vertical classification. This does require stringent, multidisciplinary planning and execution. The venous anatomy and its separation is key.

Davidoff Department of Neurological Surgery, Albert Einstein College of Medicine OBJECTIVE:Craniopagus twins is the rarest anomaly seen in conjoined twins. Craniopagus can be classified into complete or partial, depending on whether or not they have shared dural venous sinuses and into angular or total depending on the alignment of the inter-twin longitudinal axis. The separation of craniopagus is a very rare and complex challenge need- ing detailed evaluation and planning., A multi-disciplinary approach is mandatory. We present the first latin american craniopagus case sucessfully separated in Brazil. MATERIAL-METHODS:A 2-year-old female craniopagus twins who underwent a staged separation of their craniums in 2018. They were classified as a total craniophagus vertical type III. Initial radiology work-up was directed towards determining the potential connection be- tween the twins’ brains. An MRI and CT study showed that the brains abutted vertex to vertex. Twin A possessed the primary venous outflow pattern with the major sagittal sinuses. A medical 3D-model reconstruct- ed from the CT venous angiogram showed the anomalous venous pat- terns. Neuronavigation was also used. RESULTS:A total of 4 multistaged neurosurgeries and one for use of skin expanders were performed. Four major stages for 8 months led to their successful separation. After surgery number 1 and 3 the Twin B developed seizures in postoperative period. There has been no CSF leak or meningitis. CONCLUSION:Successful separation of viable conjoined twins has been historically a great rarity. The multistaged surgery reduced complications improving venous drainage, prevent increased venous pressure, diminish cerebral edema. Success clearly requires an understanding of the complex interrelationship between the \"separation\" and the \"reconstruction\" and that decisions made for one aspect of the surgery will have a profound Childs Nerv Syst"
