        "text": "OBJECTIVE:Tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS TB) remains public health concern in Indonesia and is associated with lethal complications, particularly in children. One of CNS TB manifestations is intracranial tuberculoma. It is being a serious complication. MATERIAL-METHODS:This was a retrospective study of pediatric patients admitted to dr. Soetomo Academic Medical Center Hospital during 2014-2018 (5 years), whose histopathology results meet tuberculoma diagnosis criteria. RESULTS: We identified five pediatric patients with tuberculoma. Patientsâ€™ age ranged from 3 to 14 years old, with the mean of 7.2 years old. Three patients were boys and two were girls. The main clinical symptoms present on admission were weakness of extremity (found in 1 patient), decrease of consciousness (found in 2 patients), postural imbalance (found in 1 patient), headache (found in 2 patients), and fever (found in 1 patient). All patients had no history of TB infection, TB contact, or HIV infection. The mean GCS on admission was 12. The most frequent location for tuberculoma based on neuroimaging were in the cerebellum (80%), followed by occipital region (20%) and third ventricle (20%). Multiple location were reported in 3 patients (60%). The mean volume of tuberculoma was 32.85 ml. Neuroimaging of all patients showed hydrocephalus (non- communicating in 4 patients or 80%), 3 of them (60%) also had TB meningitis. Three patients (60%) had tuberculoma resection surgery in the emergency operating theatre. Three patients (60%) had CSF diversion surgery (external ventricular drain/ventriculoperitoneal shunt) prior to the main surgery. All five patients improved well after surgery and had anti-TB therapy. CONCLUSION: Intracranial tuberculoma causes significant morbidity and mortality to pediatric patients. Emergency surgical intervention followed by anti-TB therapy may be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of intracranial tuberculoma and may improve the outcome."
