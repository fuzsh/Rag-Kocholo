That's as it should be: a reminder of why we all follow the sport in the first place. But we cannot avoid the extraordinary events in Zurich over the past month, culminating in the decision of Sepp Blatter to “lay down his mandate\" as FIFA president - though not, as yet, tender his resignation. The biggest crisis in FIFA's history is by no means over. Almost every day there have been new eye- popping revelations of corruption. Blatter has clung on as, one by one, his regional bosses - Warner, Blazer, Bin Hammam, Hayatou, Leoz, Teixeira - have been exposed. Somehow, he has remained above the fray. Is he corrupt for turning a blind eye? Or incompetent for not challenging them? Probably both. It says everything about FIFA that it took an investigation by the FBI to uncover the corruption that so many had warned about for so long. The corrupting culture that Blatter allowed to flourish throughout the organisation has now been exposed for all to see. His self-aggrandisement created a machine that was ruthless in its pursuit of money to fund the political patronage that kept him in power. Under Blatter's direction, FIFA morphed from an amateur sporting body into a global corporation with aggressive commercial aspirations, but its political structures have remained frozen in time. The great danger is that any successor to Blatter fails to recognise the need for fundamental change. Over the coming months, the debate needs to be thorough and widespread. The English-speaking media has played a leading role in exposing corruption at FIFA, but any debate needs to extend way beyond these shores. Around the world, there is huge resentment towards Europe, and the Premier League in particular, for taking players, fans and TV money away from local leagues. It's a imbalance that Blatter never challenged. But there is now the need, more than ever, for something to change. Gavin Hamilton, Editor Is Blatter corrupt for turning a blind eye or incompetent for not challenging his regional bosses? GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE THIS MONTH: FIFA CRISIS “This is the World Cup of fraud. Today we are issuing FIFA with a red card” Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service M ay 27, 2015, will go down in FIFA's history as the day which unveiled the worst corruption scandal in the world federation's history; a scandal which not only swallowed up individuals but laid bare a rotten culture at the heart of the pinnacle of the people's game. Not least among the scandalised elements was that those FIFA staff undertaking valuable work around the world - using football as a tool for education, health and social welfare - were tarred by the sins of a ruling clique, some of whose members had long mined the system for personal gold. And it all fell apart on the eve of FIFA's Congress week. Congress has long followed a traditional pattern, in which, two or three days in advance, the ExCo meets to ensure that no disagreeable outbursts hit the stage in front of the world. The surrounding days are then taken up with pre-Congress conferences of the six regional confederations at their chosen luxury hotels, in this year's case in Zurich. None, however, match in luxury of the lakeside Baur au Lac which has been the FIFA ExCo's home-from-home since the days of Joao Flavelange. All appeared in order as the ExCo ended on the Tuesday. The assorted confederation presidents, most of them FIFA vice-presidents, plus their regional delegates had endorsed president Sepp Blotter's attempt to find a compromise over the thorny issue of Palestine's bid to force Israel's suspension in the freedom- of-access saga. Beyond that. Blatter appeared to be sailing serenely towards a decisive first-round knockout victory over Jordan's Prince Ali Bin Al Flussein - the last challenger standing after the withdrawals of Michael Van Praag and Luis Figo - in the presidential election. Later, Blatter and Prince Ali each paid brief visits to the CONCACAF conference, presided over by Jeffrey Webb. But so low-key was the atmosphere that Asia and Oceania cancelled their conferences. Both had recently staged their own congresses Candidates...Blatter with Prince Aii and had nothing more to discuss; the vast majority of their votes had long since been pledged to Blatter. Then, at Sam the following morning, everything changed as Swiss police knocked on seven doors in the Baur au Lac and informed the rooms' occupants that arrest warrants had been issued at the request of the US Justice Department. Over the next half hour, the seven - with their immediate belongings tossed into black bags - were ushered into unmarked cars with their exits masked by pristine-laundered white bed sheets. The seven were FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb, head of CONCACAF (Cayman Islands); outgoing FIFA vice- president Eugenio Figueredo (Uruguay); incoming FIFA ExCo member Eduardo Li Report into the 2018-22 World Cup bid scandal last November by FIFA itself, felt pressed to appear up to speed with its own investigation. Secondly, the presence of the world's football leaders in one city simplified the arrests process. That Congress was two days away merely exacerbated the drama. Shortly afterwards, the US Justice Department confirmed that it was chasing down nine present and past FIFA officials as well as five “corporate executives'' for “racketeering, conspiracy and corruption''. Charges focused on bribery and money- laundering allegations in connection with rights awards in the central and north American and Caribbean region for World Cup qualifiers, the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the CONCACAF Champions League, the CONMEBOL/CONCACAF Centenary Copa America, the Copa America, the Libertadores Cup and the Brazilian Cup. Also under investigation were payments in connection with the sponsorship of the CBF by a major US sportswear company (Nike), the selection of the host country for the 2010 World Cup and the 2011 FIFA presidential election. The investigation had been built on the admissions of former CONCACAF general- (Costa Rica); former Brazilian CBF president Jose Maria Marin; Julio Rocha (president of the Nicaragua FA); Costas Takkas (Webb's aide and former general secretary of the Cayman Islands FA); and Rafael Esquivel (FIFA disciplinary committee member and Venezuela federation head). Simultaneously, but in a separate investigation of their own, Swiss police turned up at FIFA headquarters in the search for further documentation about the 2018-2022 World Cup bid scandal. The timing was no coincidence on two levels. Firstly, the Swiss attorney-general's office, handed the contentious Garcia Sign of the times... protesters sense it's all over for FIFA Raid...police descend on the Zurich hotel 12 WORLD SOCCER GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE Will Warner finally face justice? secretary (and former FIFA ExCo member) Chuck Blazer, and Daryll and Daryan Warner, two sons of infamous ex- CONCACAF president Jack Warner. The Brazilian entrepreneur Jose Flawilla had also cut a deal, agreeing to forfeit a staggering $150million-plus. Blazer had been “turned\" by the FBI after the fallout from the cash-for-votes scandal in Port of Spain in May 2011, when Warner had organised a presidential-bid conference for Qatar's Mohamed Bin Flammam...which was followed by $40,000 cash gifts to each Caribbean member delegation for \"expenses\". Some refused and reported back to Blazer, who then “shopped\" Warner and Bin Flammam. Flowever, further inquiries ► Turned...FBI informant Blazer There are two stories that best tell the tale of one- time CONCACAF president Jack Warner and ex general-secretary Chuck Blazer: that Blazer used CONCACAF funds to rent an apartment in Trump Tower for his cats, and that Warner allegedly misappropriated roughly $690,000 in aid relief funds meant for Flaiti, after the devastating 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake. While Blazer, an American, confessed to the FBI four years ago and has been a co-operative witness ever since, Warner remains on the run and has vowed to give the United States Department of Justice a lengthy tour of the Trinidad & Tobago judicial system. Fie has also threatened prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar he will publish incriminating evidence against her government if he is extradited, ahead of the general election on the two-island republic on September 7. Warner's last stand, on a tiny Caribbean nation with a population of below l.Smillion, is a local affair. Despite his teases about leaking embattled FIFA president Sepp Blatter's dirty secrets, he knows his only chance of avoiding a US cell lies Wamer...millions of dollars have passed through his hands in testing the will of T&T's justice system. And the fact that he is the MP for Chaguanas West, a constituency of roughly 28,000 people, says much about the unsophisticated view of white-collar crime within sections of the country. Warner's longevity in FIFA's world of bribes and bid-rigging had little do with his nationality. The Trinidadian's rise owed much to the democratic system of “one country, one vote\" that former FIFA president Stanley Rous implemented but his successor, Brazilian Joao Flavelange, exploited. Flavelange took over the FIFA reigns in 1974, just months after Warner became the T&T FA'S genera I -secretary. By the time Flavelange stepped down in 1998, CONCACAF had grown from 22 to 35 members - roughly 16 percent of the FIFA electorate - and Warner, with Blazer's help, had whipped them into a single voting bloc. Warner might have ended in a cell before he had time to spread his wings. In 1990, the T&T government launched an enquiry into the controversial administrator after the scandal of its final Italia 1990 World Cup qualifying match against the United States. The national team only needed a draw to progress and were heavy favourites. But the fixture became chaotic long before the opening whistle, as Warner flouted several FIFA match-day regulations and, more worryingly, sold more than double the capacity of the National Stadium's 22,000 seats. But rather than censure Warner, FIFA gave Trinidad & Tobago a “Fair Play Award\" for the scandalous events of November 19 1989. And CONCACAF officials, at Flavelange's urging, even elected the Trinidadian as their president. Warner used both honours as leverage, arguing that the world was praising his stewardship while his compatriots tried to crucify him. Fie suggested that, due to his new post, any legal proceedings would damage the country's reputation - something that was to become a regular theme for Warner, who found countries happy to ignore the law to win his favour. South Africa's $10m payment to Warner, via FIFA, for a non-existent “Diaspora Legacy Programme\" has become an example of the corrupt World Cup bidding process. As the filmed chat about Mohamed Bin Flammam's $40,000 “gift\" to members of Caribbean Football Union suggested, Warner was never big on discretion. The CONCACAF president succeeded because he and FIFA's other crooked officials were considered a necessary evil to many of football's stakeholders throughout the world. By then, the millions of dollars laundered into Warner's tiny home island had passed through so many hands that, in June 2015, even Archbishop Joseph Flarris referred to the disgraced official as a friend and admitted that the Roman Catholic church benefitted from his generosity. The US Attorney General, however, will not be as easily swayed. As the noose tightens, Warner has vowed to embarrass his former “friends\" into protecting him from “meddling outsiders\" and extradition. Flis next court hearing is on July 9. Warner has beat justice many times before, often without ever being called to the stand. Fie avoided punishment for November 19 and the Flaiti aid scandal - among others - while, despite his disgraceful FIFA exit in 2011, he was allowed to keep the multi-million dollar Centre of Excellence, which is his main money spinner at present. The US Department of Justice might be the only body left with the might and will to hold him accountable. WS WORLD SOCCER 13 THIS MONTH: FIFA CRISIS “The FIFA president, secretary-general and communications director are in a car. Who’s driving? The police” FIFA communications chief Walter De Gregorio cracks a joke on Swiss television...and then resigns revealed the multi-million extent to which Blazer had been cashing-in himself. That alerted the US tax authorities and the FBI, and led all the way to the FIFA humiliation of May 27, 2015. Later in the day, Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney General, FBI director James B Comey and Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation department laid out the case against the 14 being sought over corruption allegations concerning more than $150m. In addition to the \"Zurich Seven\", these included Warner, Nicolas Leoz (former president of the Paraguayan and South American federation and one-time ExCo member), sports marketing executives Alejandro Burzaco, Aaron Davidson (president of the NASL and Traffic Sports USA which owns Carolina RailFlawks), Flugo Jinkis and Mariano Jinkis, plus alledged intermediary, Jose Margulies. Lynch was specific in explaining that Main topk...the home page of Interpol's website “The indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systematic and deep rooted, both abroad and in the US” Loretta Lynch, US Attorney General her department had been empowered because the offences had been committed within US criminal and financial jurisdiction. She did not pull any punches. “The indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systemic, and deep- rooted both abroad and here in the United States,\" said Lynch. “It spans at least two generations of soccer officials who, as alleged, have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks. “It has profoundly harmed a multitude of victims, from the youth leagues and developing countries that should benefit from the revenue generated by the commercial rights these organizations hold, to the fans at home and throughout the world whose support for the game makes those rights valuable. “Today's action makes clear that this Department of Justice intends to end any such corrupt practices, to root out misconduct, and to bring wrongdoers to justice - and we look forward to continuing to work with other countries in this effort\" Back in Zurich, the Swiss Attorney Specific...Lynch General announced his intention to interview the 10 men who had been members of the FIFA ExCo in 2010, over recollections of the 2018-2022 bid ballot. The 10 were: Michel D'Hooghe (Belgium), Jacques Anouma (Ivory Coast), Marios Lefkaritis (Cyprus), Angel Maria Villar (Spain), Senes Erzik (Turkey), Worawi Makudi (Thailand), Issa Hayatou (Cameroon), Many Abo Rida (Egypt), Vitaly Mutko (Russia) and Rafael Salguero (Guatemala). Five of these - Anouma, Erzik, Makudi, Abo Rida and Salguero - had been due to step down from the ExCo at Congress on Friday. US and Swiss authorities indicated there was no immediate prospect of Blatter himself being accused and/or arrested. FIFA summoned a hasty press conference at which a brazen comment by communications director Walter De Gregorio, that this was “a good day\" for the world federation was greeted with hoots of derision by journalists. If FIFA can rebuild and restructure then maybe, one long-distant day in the future, he may be proved correct, but the steady flow of new revelations was nothing in which to take pride. At a time when humility was needed, the comment encapsulated perceptions that FIFA's ruling clique was utterly out of touch with expectations of the game at large. Prince Ali, his suspicions about some of his ExCo colleagues vindicated, said: “We cannot go on like this!’ Even more strident was Sharan Burrow, the general-secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation which has lambasted FIFA over Qatari labour laws, who insisted Blatter quit now. The Swiss and US investigations had delved back to the early 1990s when Blatter was already ensconced as FIFA genera I -secretary and chief executive, ahead of becoming president in 1998. Blatter, in a massive understatement, took responsibility for “the unfortunate events\" of the past, but believed he was still the right man to clean up the mess. Subsequently, FIFA's independent ethics judge, Hans-Joachim Eckert, suspended 14 WORLD SOCCER GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE from all football activities 11 of the 14 over which it had power: Webb, Li, Rocha, Takkas, Jack Warner, Figueredo, Esquivel, Marin, Leoz, Blazer and Daryl I Warner. Little had been heard, so far, from UEFA since European football's leaders were in Warsaw for the Europa League Final. In Poland, genera I -secretary Gianni Infantino suggested congress should be suspended, but early the following Thursday morning, Michel Platini found UEFA in a minority of one when he flew in to Zurich. Blatter had excused himself from opening the second day of a FIFA medical conference to summon a meeting of the FIFA emergency committee. With Webb and Figueredo “otherwise detained\". Blatter and Platini were joined by David Chung (Oceania), Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalia (AFC), incoming Brazen...De Gregorio said it was a \"good day\" CONMEBOL president Juan Angel Napout, Lydia Nsekera (Burundi) on behalf of CAF leader Issa Flayatou, and Rafael Salguero (Guatemala) on behalf of CONCACAF’s new interim president Alfredo Hawit (Honduras). All the other confederations wanted to go ahead with both Congress and the election. Platini acquiesced before pursuing one last attempt to persuade Blatter to stand down. Later Platini recalled: “I said to him: ‘We started together in 1998 [when Blatter first became president] and we won together for FIFA, and now I'm asking you to leave FIFA, to step down. We are giving out a terrible image. We can't continue this way. “After the meeting we discussed this i w Tim VICKERY I BRAZIL TV rights and wrongs In 1980 an obscure Brazilian journalist called Jose (usually referred to simply as J) Hawilla bought Traffic, a company that had specialised in bus-stop adverts. Within a few years he had transformed South American football. He quickly took control of the business of pitch-side advertising boards in Brazil, but the big deal was a continent-wide TV scoop. In 1986, Paraguay's Nicolas Leoz began his long reign as CONMEBOL president. The following year, after it had fallen into disuse, the Copa America was brought back as a made-for-TV competition,with the rights sold by Traffic. It was the start of a long and fruitful partnership - which seemed to turn sour in November 2011. Traffic believed that they owned the rights to the 2015 Copa, with an option on future tournaments, but CONMEBOL granted the rights to Full Play, an Argentinian company. Traffic took the matter to court in Florida, and Hawilla was declared persona non grata by CONMEBOL. The outcome was an agreement where Traffic agreed to share the rights with Full Play and Ty C, another Argentinian concern. The three formed a company called Datisa, based in Uruguay. The fact that Hawilla had sought legal regress in a US court is significant, and not without its ironies. Looking to expand. Traffic had set up US branches - and they had always had an eye on opportunities to the north. The company were prime movers in the addition of two extra teams in the Copa America from 1993 as it was a way to get a piece of the giant Mexican TV market. The logical conclusion of this was the bizarre decision of CONMEBOL to celebrate 100 years of its national team competition on US soil - the 2016 Centenary Copa America, to which Datisa hold the rights - but which may now not take place. The TV contract for the competition is part of the US investigation into football corruption. After working so hard to bring the US into the global game, Hawilla has now proved a victim of its legal system. Last December he pleaded guilty to Guilty...Hawilla Big player...Traffic re-started the Copa America and sold the broadcast rights engaging in conspiracy to racketeer, to commit wire fraud and to launder money, and also to obstruction of justice. He instantly paid back $25million and has agreed to pay back a total of $151 m - testament to the profitability of the link-up between football and TV. It is entirely probable that Hawilla is a leading source of evidence for the charges being brought against “the FIFA 14\" - the nine officials from either CONMEBOL or CONCACAF FAs and the five corporate executives, drawn from the three companies in the Datisa umbrella. The interface between these two groups is where the bribes and the kickbacks have exchanged hands - over a 24-year period, according to the US investigation. It is fair to say that the accusations of financial malpractice have not come as a total surprise to the South American audience. But the US investigation has emboldened local police and politicians to make enquiries into people who were previously seen as untouchable. The shock waves will be felt for some time in the administration of the continent's game. These years of marriage between football and TV have been beneficial to South America's national teams - especially the less traditional ones, who have profited from the relaunch of the Copa America and, especially, from the introduction of the marathon format of World Cup qualification. With many more competitive games to play - and to sell to the TV stations - standards have risen. The last three World Cups have seen best-ever performances from Ecuador, Paraguay and Colombia, while the last two have been the best from Chile with the exception of 1962, which they hosted. The continent's national-team football can boast an unprecedented strength in depth. It is the clubs who have far more reason to feel aggrieved. The distance between club football in Europe and South America has never been wider. That, of course, is not helped by the fact that the South American clubs are being short-changed by TV deals based on bribery and crony capitalism. Of course, the financial weakness of the clubs creates a necessity for players to be sold - with more opportunities for money to be siphoned off into private bank accounts. WS WORLD SOCCER 15 THIS MONTH: FIFA CRISIS “Beginning in and around 2004 and continuing through 2011, 1 and others agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa” Chuck Blazer says he and fellow ExCo members took bribes in the run-up to choosing the host of the 2010 Worid Cup between the two of us in his office and I repeated that he should step down. ‘Times were tough and he needed to have the stature to recognise the situation. He said to me: ‘I like you but it's too late. I can't leave now when congress starts only this evening!\" Hence, in the context of Platini's pleading, a worldwide storm of criticism, a threat from David Gill not to take up his seat as Britain's vice-president plus expressions of worried concern from the World Cup sponsors. Blatter took to the stage for the sparkly, showbiz-style opening ceremony to congress that evening. He warned of \"more bad news ahead\" after events which had “cast a long shadow over football and over this week's congress. The action of individuals brings shame and humiliation on football and demands action and change from us all. We cannot allow the reputation of football and of FIFA to be dragged through the mud any longer. It has to stop here and now!' Already matters had gone too far for Swiss sports minister Ueli Maurer, who responded that FIFA had fallen down on its primary duty to provide an example to the football family around the world. Then Olympic president Thomas Bach warned that trying to root out FIFA's corruption culture would prove a long and painful task. Any faux-party atmosphere was finally dispelled for Blatter when he learned, on leaving the ceremony, that Marco Polo Del Nero had checked out of the Baur au Lauc hotel and fled the country. The president of Brazil's CBF, also a FIFA ExCo member, had not risked waiting for congress for fear of arrest. Back home he would be safe as Brazil's constitution prohibits the extradition of its citizens. This was the key reason why, it also emerged, Teixeira had ended his self- exile in Miami and also flown home to the armed-guard security of a luxury new “Fm asking you to leave FIFA, to step down. We are giving out a terrible image. We can’t continue this way” What Michel Platini says he told Blatter Elected...Blatter's reign this time was extremely short Voting...staff empty the presidential ballot boxes apartment in Rio de Janeiro. Congress thus began with Blatter's opening remarks. He conceded that congress had been briefly put in question by Wednesday's “storm\" and was even interrupted briefly by a pro-Palestinian protest before secretary-generalJerome Vaicke ran through the agenda. This included a warning from audit chairman Domenico Scala that FIFA needed a culture change plus a high- tension debate which resulted in another Palestinian-lsraeli compromise. So to the main event, the presidential election. Blatter had been expected to sweep to a clear first-round victory by securing at least 140 (two-thirds) of the 209 votes. Instead, he ended up with 133 against Prince Ali's 73 (with three votes spoiled). Prince Ali, his numbers expanded by the sense of crisis, had little diplomatic option but to withdraw. Blatter, grinning widely, thus bounced back on stage in triumphalist style as if he had won by a landslide. Once more, utterly the wrong note had been struck. But he was, so it appeared, for good or ill, back in place for another four years. Far away, however, events continued to conspire against his credibility. Jack Warner was arrested in Port of Spain - and then taken suddenly ill - and bailed to answer his extradition warrant. In Paraguay, Leoz was arrested in hospital, where he too claimed to be unwell and suffering from the recurrence of a heart condition. The next morning, after an ExCo meeting which did little more than confirm the status quo for the World Cup slots in 2018 and 2022, Blatter promised the media he would “take our boat back into calmer waters\". But calmer waters were an illusion. Vaicke came under scrutiny for his role in the channelling of South African money to Warner; then FAI CEO John Delaney raised an Irish storm with confirmation that FIFA 16 WORLD SOCCER GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE Mark GLEESON ■ SOUTH AFRICA Spotlight on 2010 ^bribe^ “bought off' a legal protest over the notorious Thierry Henry handball in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers that cost the Republic of Ireland a place at the finals. Even as these tempests raged so no one gave any credence to Blotter's suggestion at Congress and after the ExCo that this would be his last term of office...until the following Tuesday when FIFA convened a press conference at such speed that only a handful of reporters were present to see and hear the 79-year-old announce his impending departure. Among all the twists and turns of what were 10 remarkable days - even by FIFA's turbulent standards - this was the most astonishing of all. • Did Platini's words finally come home to him? • Did the concerns of his daughter and closest adviser Corinne suddenly ring true? • Did the prospect of more US Justice revelations intimidate him? • Did an imperative to end the risks of worldwide travel, to foreign jurisdictions, weigh him down? Blotter's announced departure answered one question while raising even more...and opening the way to another congress which, like its title, will be extraordinary indeed. WS It did not take long after the swoop by Swiss police at Zurich's Baur au Lac hotel for the gloss to start peeling off South Africa's 2010 World Cup. In the hours after FIFA officials were taken, the US justice department in New York released the 164-page indictment of the 14 they sought to prosecute for racketeering, wire fraud and money-laundering conspiracies. And midway through the document were the most salacious details around South Africa's 2010 bid strategy, including details of a Paris hotel-room exchange of dollar bills to buy votes and the government's alleged agreement of a $10million bribe for the votes of the three CONCACAF members on the FIFA executive committee at the time. The document implicates deeply both the South African bid and the government - and it has come as no surprise that they jumped onto the defensive with an initial denial, and then a disingenuous explanation, leaving more questions than answers. The South African part of the indictment is based on evidence given by former CONCACAF general-secretary and FIFA ExCo member Chuck Blazer and the sons of one of his long-time accomplice Jack Warner, the long-serving CONCACAF president. It details a sinister handover of cash to Warner's son and also makes clear the $10m from South Africa was to pay for the votes of Warner, Blazer and CONCACAF's third member on the FIFA ExCo at the time, Isaac Sasso Sasso from Costa Rica. The incredulity around the enormous payment is heightened by the fact the money was eventually paid over directly to Warner, not by South Africa's government, as originally promised, but directly from FIFA in Zurich. Ostensibly they took it out of $100m they were giving South Africa to organise the 2010 finals. South Africa's tenuous defence is that the money was intended for a legacy programme for the African Diaspora in the Caribbean. As part of its denial, the government found an old sound bite of former South African president Thabo Mbeki explaining to a CNN interviewer the idea behind the project. However, there is no record of this legacy programme, ostensibly run by the Warner-controlled Caribbean Football Union, and it seems inconceivable that South Africa Top...Mbeki (left) and Jordaan sought no oversight Tainted...South Africa's hosting of the 2010 World Cup or accounting of what their money was being used for. \"We gave the money unconditionally. Jack Warner was the leader of CONCACAF and the Caribbean Football Union and a man of good standing,'' said a straight-faced South African sports ministry's director general, Alec Moemi. There are few in the country who swallow the story, except perhaps for Mbeki, who was possibly duped by his own people into believing the money would actually be used for some good. But why would South Africa have felt the need for a development programme in the Caribbean when it had initiated no similar projects closer to home, particularly not in the African countries where there were other FIFA voters, such as neighbouring Botswana? And why was there no publicity at the time when it would be expected such a considerable donation would be giant-sized fodder to be gobbled up by any public relations machine? When one reporter asked Moemi why a Google search failed to deliver a single line of the “African legacy programme\" prior to the recent revelations, he said it was because reporters had not thought it not newsworthy at the time. Certainly the recipients believed the money to be a bribe and the “development programme\" just a front. Blazer was promised $1 m of the $10m, but eventually only got $750,000 and was plainly stitched up by Warner. The American indictment fingers two South African bid officials - one who handed over the cash in the Paris hotel room - and it is the revelation of these identities when the court case in the US unfolds that is eagerly anticipated in South Africa. Danny Jordaan, who ran the bid campaign almost single-handedly and is now the FA president, has gone to ground since the indictment's release, refusing any comment. His image as the man who delivered the World Cup is severely dented, even if he has yet to be accused of any wrong doing. And much of the positive publicity that the country got post the hosting of the World Cup now lies in tatters. WS WORLD SOCCER 17 THIS MONTH: FIFA CRISIS “This is blasphemy. Ifs a state conspiracy.

WORLD SOCCER 19 THIS MONTH: FIFA CRISIS “I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football: the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at FIFA” Blatter's dramatic \"resignation\" speech Who's next? The contenders to succeed Blatter as FIFA president MICHEL PLATINI UEFA’s 59-year-old president always insisted he \"would never run against Blatter\" and he was as good as his word despite the contradiction of persistent criticism of his old mentor for breaking his promise to stand down this year. This time around the Frenchman may believe he has no alternative but to throw his hat into the ring. He would undertake the presidency in a very different manner to Blatter's 24/7 approach but might struggle to obtain enough votes in Africa and Asia, whose FAs are suspicious of UEFA power play - particularly after the toppling of Blatter. SHEIKH AHMAD AL FAHAD AL SABAH The Kuwaiti is a formidable powerbroker in the Olympic family but was comparatively unknown in football politics until this year, when AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa manipulated the confederation’s FIFA slot so Sheikh Ahmad could walk into the ExCo. He had been thought to be targeting the FIFA top job in 2019 but may now feel he must challenge earlier than expected. Sheikh Ahmad, one-time head of oil cartel OPEC, heads the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and revenue-distributing Olympic Solidarity. SHEIKH SALMAN BIN EBRAHIM AL KHALIFA The 49-year-old Asian confederation president headed the task force which decided on switching the Qatar World Cup to the winter and is a dedicated defender of Qatar’s World Cup hosting. He gained overwhelming support in his election as AFC president in 2013, albeit thanks to the behind-the-scenes support of Sheikh Ahmad. He beat Yousuf Al Serkal of the United Arab Emirates and Thailand’s Worawi Makudi to replace Mohamed Bin Hammam. While he or Sheikh Ahmad seem certain to run, they will not both stand. New dawn...FIFA has the chance to restore some credibility PRINCE ALI BIN AL HUSSEIN The 39-year-old Jordanian prince took a praiseworthy 73 votes in his defeat by Sepp Blatter in Zurich and must consider whether this is a platform to try again. The problem for Prince Ali is that he may not have full-hearted support from within his .own Asian confederation.

A Brazilian indictment against Teixeira revealed the account contained $30m. THE FIGHT TO EXTRADITE Paraguay's former CONMEBOL president Nicolas Leoz was placed under house arrest, pending an attempt to extradite him to the USA. At 86, and in frail health, that may not be an easy request to grant. In the 1990s, he declared CONMEBOL headquarters, on the outskirts of Paraguay’s capital Asuncion, to have diplomatic immunity, like an embassy. However, Paraguay's congress has already moved to strip the CONMEBOL building of its diplomatic status. Meanwhile, South American prosecutors have made a joint request to the US authorities for access to information on criminal activities unearthed by the FBI, so that local investigations can be furthered. DECEMBER ELECTION DATE The FIFA executive committee will meet in Zurich on July 20 to set a date for the extraordinary Congress which will elect a new president. December 16 appears to be the most favoured date. Audit and compliance chairman Domenico Scala will issue new electoral regulations, setting a five-nominations declaration deadline for candidates, possibly mid-October. In the meantime FIFA’s political work has been halted, as has the 2026 World Cup bid process. CENTRE STAGE FOR SCALA When Sepp Blatter made his dramatic resignation announcement he was accompanied not by secretary-general Jerome Vaicke or communications director Walter De Gregorio but by audit and compliance chairman Scala. The 54-year-old Swiss businessman is probably the one man in and around FIFA who could be counted as truly independent. He was brought in on the recommendation of governance guru Mark Pieth in May 2012 and can sit in on any committee, to delve into whatever document he likes and check up on the work of whoever catches his attention. Direct involvement by Scala in the next transitional months can be crucial. As he has indicated all along, he believes FIFA cannot rebuild without a radical change of governing structure, term and age limits, and meaningful transparency. Scala has ordered much tighter controls on development projects and used his power to halt projects that are throwing up accounting concerns. He worked with now-departed ethics chief Michael Garcia to draw up this year’s first FIFA electoral regulations. WORLD CUP INVESTIGATIONS The Swiss attorney-general’s office is continuing its investigations into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. It has seen the contents of the Garcia Report and has seized computer records from FIFA House. The Swiss FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS IN BRAZIL Up until last month the headquarters of the CBF was named after Jose Maria Marin, the organisation’s former president. Paraguay’s congress has already moved to strip the CONMEBOL building of its diplomatic status The letters were hurriedly removed from the front of the building after Marin was one of those arrested in Switzerland as part of the FBI investigation. The Federal Police are looking into the affairs of the CBF, who will also fall under the scrutiny of a commission of inquiry in Brazil’s congress, which player turned rebel politician Romario has been pushing for in recent months. Marin's successor, Marco Polo del Nero, did not even stay in Switzerland for the FIFA presidential election, instead scurrying back to Brazil to take charge of the CBF’s defence. WORLD SOCCER 21 Brian GLANVILLE THE VOICE OF FOOTBALL A man and an organisation with no sense of shame It was Mao Tse-tung, of unhallowed memory, who did once memorably say: “Power comes out of the barrel of a gun!' To which one might add that even smoking guns, however incriminating and however plainly revealed, are seldom enough in themselves to bring retribution. By all this I mean that not until the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and its American allies, suddenly and sensationally made a host of arrests and published specific charges of corruption by members of FIFA did there seem any real prospect of the Augean Stables at last being cleared. My own newspaper. The Sunday Times, in the course of a formidable investigation of millions of emails, laid bare the appalling scale and shocking detail of FIFA’s World Cup machinations. But nothing happened. Indeed the ineffable Sepp Blatter, addressing a representative audience, actually had the gall to brush the investigation aside with an idiotic charge of racism. This is a man and an organisation with no sense of shame. Well, he's out of office now, thank the Lord, though still trying at the time of writing to cling to it for many months. For all The Sunday Times' shocking revelations, he had been voted back into power and presidency by a landslide. And even after his announced resignation, he received a 10-minute ovation from the minions he employed. Shades of the vacuous dictum in Italian Fascist times that \"Mussolini is always right\". Mass brainwashing would seem to be in order. All sorts of repellent creatures are crawling out from under stones. We learn that South Africa paid a $10million bribe to Jack Warner of CONCACAF which, for obscure, bewildering reasons, was even mediated through FIFA, allegedly via Blatter's number two, Jerome Vaicke (denied, of course). The money was supposedly, as oddly maintained by the South Africans, to help the development of soccer in the Caribbean area. What noble generosity. Vaicke claims to have had nothing to do with the payment, even though an email sent by him in December 2007 states: \"I have never received confirmation but, more important, I would like to know when the transfer can be done\" This, he told the South African minister, was “based on a discussion between FIFA and the South African government and also between our President and [South African] President M'Beki\". A FIFA lady had insisted that everything was wholly in order. But thereby hangs an all too significant tale. A few years ago, Vaicke, then a middling executive, and the gross Chuck Blazer, who has now helpfully turned state's evidence, were sent by FIFA to Hot seat...Blatter is determined to ciing on to his post until a successor is elected represent them in a New York court where their brief was to overturn the deal for World Cup representation enjoyed by MasterCard in favour of Visa. The female judge virtually chased them out of court, accusing them of lying. Back in Zurich, Vaicke was briefly demoted, but in no time at all, the smoke cleared and he was installed as Blatter's second in command. Please note, that not a single peep of protest was heard from any member country of the world body. “Even after Blatter’s announced resignation, he received a 10-minute ovation from the minions he employed” 22 WORLD SOCCER Somewhere in Brazil, now well into his 90s, Joao Havelange, the monster and manipulator who was ultimately behind it all, sits smugly and snugly on his untold millions. Yes, we know that quite recently he and the abominable Ricardo Teixeira, now reportedly gone to ground while accused of embezzling $100million, found themselves eased out of their roles - Havelange's merely being that of honorary FIFA president - as a result of the ISL swindle and the money they had pocketed to implement it. Whatever we may think of Blatter, not least the suspicious way he suddenly and surprisingly pipped Sweden's Johansson for the presidency in 1998, there is no doubt that it was Flavelange who corrupted FIFA. The Americans have been talking about going back 24 years in their investigation but, ideally, inquiries should go back to 1974, that fateful day when Flavelange bought his way past Stanley Rous to the presidency. It was a shocking and direly significant fact that he retained it until 1998. Flow could it be that Flavelange was re-elected every four years almost automatically? In his remarkable, supremely well-researched book How They Stole The Game, David Yallop gives us superabundant detail of how Flavelange bought the (largely African) votes he needed for the presidential election in Frankfurt in 1974. Money was embezzled, as his former business partner Dr Lobo states, partly from the Brazilian Football Confederation of which Flavelange was president, and partly from rich Portuguese politicians fleeing their own country when its neo-fascist regime had been overturned. With these funds, Flavelange was able to run a colossal ly expensive international campaign which took him round and round the world. In 1986, Playboy magazine interviewed Flavelange and asked: \"Visiting eighty-six countries costs a lot. Who paid for the trip?\" I did, replied Flavelange who, usually so meticulous about money, added he had no idea of how much he had spent. So Rous was duly outvoted and Flavelange's putrescent 24-year reign began. In the meanwhile, he assiduously promoted the career of his then son-in- law Teixeira, who was struggling financially when Flavelange took him up and got him into the television business. Yallop gives infinite excruciating chapter and verse on Teixeira's greed and devious manipulation, but all these long years it was he whom the Brazilians appointed to lead their World Cup committee. Crooked...Havelange's embezzlement funded his many costly global trips Irish deal makes no sense at all Much furore over the revelation that the FA of Ireland accepted a €5million payment from FIFA as compensation for the handball goal of Thierry Flenry in the World Cup 2010 play-off in Paris. Jose Mourinho is among those who have poured scorn on it. For my part, I am somewhat bewildered. Beyond doubt the Irish were shamefully cheated, but no more so, surely, than England in Mexico City in 1986 when Diego Maradona scored against them with the so-called \"Fland of God\". Wretched refereeing in both cases. In that of Maradona, a trio of inexperienced African officials had been absurdly appointed. As for the Flenry affair, there is no evidence to suggest or confirm that the referee and his linesman were culpable other than in simple error. That €5m was essentially blood money. But given that no malfeasance had been proved, why pay it at all? Should the FAI and its now embroiled supremo, John Delaney, have accepted it? Should FIFA have ever paid it? In doing so there was an implicit suggestion of culpability. A sombre affair. A tacit admission of guilt? Controversy...the Republic of Ireland appeal in vain as Henry (left) handles in the build-up to France’s goal in the 2010 World Cup qualifying play-off • Read Brian Glanville's exclusive online column at worldsoccer.com Oil pressure...then-French president Sarkozy (left) and Platini Please, no Platini Whoever succeeds Blatter, let it not by any stretch of the imagination be Michel Platini. Fie has eternally blotted his copybook as president of UEFA by betraying his European trust in voting for Qatar as a summer, 50 degrees centigrade, tournament - then compounding it by supporting its transfer to the European winter, thus utterly subverting the competitions of the countries he supposedly represents. The word is, however, he wasn't bought; he was leaned on by then French president Nicolas Sarkozy, intent on maintaining oil supplied from Qatar. In which case, the honourable thing for Platini to have done was either to refuse or to resign. And what of Franz Beckenbauer, who not only supported Qatar for 2022 but, according to a witness quoted in The Sunday Times investigation, was paid vast sums to endorse the 2018 Russian bid? Fie has yet to deny it or take libel action. WORLD SOCCER 23 THE WORLD THIS MONTH Jim HOLDEN AT THE HEART OF THE GAME Old guard remain wary of the little upstarts Shock...unfashionale Frosinone celebrate defying their critics and clinching promotion to Serie A The major leagues of Europe have never seen anything like it, with the minnows of Carpi, Frosinone, Ingolstadt and Bournemouth joining their respective top flights next season. For many football lovers, this is a wonderful and heart-warming story amid the scandals of FIFA and the predictable domination of silverware by the game's giants. Carpi have won four promotions in five seasons to reach Serie A with an average home attendance of 2,991. Frosinone's similar ascent has come with gates of 5,087. Ingolstadt were only created in 2004, when they began playing in the fourth tier of the Bavarian regional league, and Bournemouth were saved from extinction as recently as 2008 by money collected in plastic buckets by their supporters. Each of these triumphs is a proper sporting fairy tale - and yet still the romance is lost on some sad souls. Listen to Claudio Lotito, the owner of Lazio, who slammed the prospect of “Cinderella clubs\" in Serie A because they would be detrimental to the amount of TV income the league could generate. Speaking before the promotions were sealed, Lotito said: \"If Carpi come up, if teams come up who are not worth a cent, then in two or three years we won’t have a penny. \"I’ve done well in selling TV rights, we have brought in € 1.2billion thanks to my skill. If in three years we have teams such as Frosinone, who would buy those rights? They don’t even know where Frosinone is?\" Well, Frosinone is a small and delightful town full of decent people in the Lazio region south of Rome. Carpi is in the province of Modena. Both have achieved success on modest budgets, using young Italian players and thanks to the work of fine coaches in Fabrizio Castori at Carpi and Roberto Stellone with Frosinone. There is virtue in their glory even if they don’t smell of money. But I suppose the carping is to be expected from the old powers of the game as they take fright so easily. It’s just the same in Germany - although the rationale there is in reverse. The problem with Ingolstadt is they have too much wealth. Ingolstadt is where the novel Frankenstein was set, and some see a monster in their rise and rise, with the club, who play at the 15,000-capacity Audi Sportpark, derisively known by critics as \"FC Audi\". Former Germany defender Christoph Metzelder called the promotion \"a slap in the face for traditional clubs\", while the chairman of Eintracht Frankfurt, Heribert Bruchhagen, was equally damning - as well as fearful about the role of corporate cash. “Pretty well everyone is surprised that a club like Ingolstadt can make a run at the Bundesliga and may, depending on Audi’s commitment, become a major player in the long term,\" claimed Bruchhagen. \"It’s another indication that the traditional clubs of the Bundesliga feel under pressure from corporate-sponsored entities masquerading as factory clubs\" No mention there of the club's brilliant coach, Ralph HasenhuttI, who has created a superb team where before there was mediocrity despite Audi’s involvement. In England, Bournemouth have suffered similar brickbats because their financial status has been secured by the riches of a Russian owner, Maxim Demin, who made his fortune in the petro-chemical industry. However, the club’s wage bill was among the lower end of the 24-team Championship last season, and their excellence on the field - from a squad of modest reputation - has been forged by impressive young boss Eddie Howe, who was named Manager of the Year by his peers in England, ahead even of Jose Mourinho. Too little money. Too much wealth. The self-serving accusations fly from the old guard of European football when they should be acknowledging the joy of sport to confound and to delight. Who knows if Carpi, Frosinone, Ingolstadt and Bournemouth will prove to be more than one-season wonders? But one thing is for certain: they should definitely not be mocked or sneered at for their achievements.

After Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas had committed a nasty looking foul on Raheem Sterling, the referee, Andre Marriner, took his red card out and appeared to show it to John Obi Mikel. Then, mysteriously, the red card disappeared and Fabregas escaped with just a yellow. The BBC's Alan Green was justifiably baffled, commenting: \"I'm sorry. The referee is meant, through his signals, to tell people in a stadium precisely what has happened!' If only, Alan. If only. The fact is, referees are under no obligation to signal anything. The rule book lists 18 “powers and duties\" for the referee - and giving signals to define decisions is not one of them. In the “Guidelines\" section, there is a page headed simply \"Referee Signals\". That's all; no mention of whether these signals have to be used or not. The page has just five drawings; two of which are identical: how to give a yellow card and how to give a red card. So then, just four signals: for a direct free-kick, an indirect free-kick, for playing advantage and how to brandish a card - which is an obvious action that barely qualifies as a signal anyway. The history of signals shows a long hostility to the whole idea; from Stanley Rous' famous “I don't want my referees looking like windmills\" to statements from FIFA. This one from 1970 is typical of the official attitude: “It is not the duty of the referee, nor is it a useful function, to explain his decisions to the players or spectators. Any attempt to do so can only lead to confusion, uncertainty and delay!' Extraordinary. But this official attitude - that it is alright to keep not only the fans, but the players as well, in the dark - involves a huge misunderstanding on the part of the rule makers. The idea of the signals is not to explain the referee's calls, it is to define them. For example, in order to give a clear and immediate indication that, say, “impeding the progress of an opponent\" (what used to be called obstruction) has been called. That's all why would anyone object to referees identifying their calls? that is required. Explanations of why the call was made can follow after the game. If you want to argue that the previous FIFA statement is 45-years old, and things are much better now, there is one crucial piece of evidence that contradicts that assumption - because it is clear that the “don't tell them anything\" mentality still dominates referees' thinking. How is it that, after over 150 years of written soccer rules, there is still no official list of obligatory referee signals? How difficult would it be to draw up a set of signals to cover all the important calls? My calculation is that this would involve somewhere between a dozen and 20 signals - hardly a daunting task. Of course, the lead should be taken by the referees themselves, but that is not going to happen. However, action can be taken because this is not something that in any way changes or contravenes the existing rules and therefore does not impact on the playing of the game. The permission of FIFA is not required. The people who should jump in to draw up the signals are the Americans. American sports fans are used to clear signals in their sports. They get them in gridiron football, in basketball, in baseball. In gridiron stadiums and basketball arenas they also get PA announcements of the calls. This is an opportunity for Major League Soccer to show the way. Let them draw up a provisional list. By all means involve representatives from other countries, should they show any interest, then let's see how things go after a full MLS season using the signals. The important things are simply to show, first, that a list of acceptable signals can be compiled, and second that the signals work in practice. Unthinking tradition cannot serve as a solid basis for modern refereeing. In this age of announced transparency in the game, why would anyone object to referees identifying their calls? This is not another attempt to permit technology to encroach on the referee's duties. Rather the opposite. Decisively delivered, authoritative signals would make it clear that the referee is in charge. WS 26 WORLD SOCCER GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE “Fin going in with my eyes wide open.

Nick Bidwell BRAZIL 4 ^ There was a historic moment for Guarani of Paraguay in the Libertadores Cup. With the veteran Julio Cesar Caceres once more superb at the heart of their back three, they kept another clean sheet - their fourth in a row - as they eliminated their second consecutive giant. After beating Corinthians of Brazil 3-0 on aggregate they held Racing of Argentina to a gripping goalless draw to go through 1-0. Their semi-final opponents will be River Plate, who lost their first leg 1-0 at home, but produced the performance of the week to win 3-0 against Cruzeiro of Brazil, who won the last two domestic titles but consistently disappointed in the Libertadores. Tim Vickery ITALY 1^ Former Italy and Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi may have talked himself into more trouble last weekend. Not long ago, Sacchi was accused of racism when he complained about the number of \"coloured\" players he had seen participating in the prestigious Viareggio Youth tournament in February. This time, Sacchi has touched a similar note when welcoming the recent rise and rise of Juventus. Fie was reported to have said: “The sun is shining again on Italian football thanks to Juventus and let's hope that this sun shines not just on Italian football but also on the other Italy. “The last time we won a Champions League, we did it with an Inter side in which there wasn't a single Italian. “In my opinion, that was a complete disgrace. Problem is that in Italy, in order to win, people are willing to sell their souls to the devil\". Needless to say, folks up at Appiano Gentile were not much amused with one of the few Italians in that Inter side, namely Marco Materazzi, commenting: “Now I ask you, would Sacchi's great AC Milan team have won quite so much without those three Dutchmen (Van Basten, Gullit and Rijkaard)?\" Paddy Agnew SPAIN Carlo Ancelotti puffed his way through Real Madrid's penultimate game of the season. Suspended, he sat in a private box, smoking on a cigarette. Fie will still be suspended for the final match against Getafe, meaning that he has probably sat on the Madrid bench for the last time. The only thing that can keep him in a job now is if Madrid fail to find a man who can replace him - not exactly a solid foundation for another year together. Sid Lowe WORLD SOCCER 27 witness Joel Richards reports from Buenos Aires ARGENTINA Superclasico trilogy ends in disgrace Fan attack sees Boca expelled from the Libertadores Cup When the calendars and results aligned to schedule three Superclasicos in the space of 11 days in May, many wondered quite how Argentina would cope with such an intense timetable. The resounding answer was broadcast around the world for over an hour when the third game between River Plate and Boca Juniors was suspended. For a country that is well accustomed to violence in football, the scandalous scenes at the Libertadores Cup clash represented an absolute nadir. Television footage clearly showed the moment of the attack on the River players and those responsible. Just before the start of the second half, Adrian Napolitano, a supporter known as ‘The Baker\", sprayed home-made mace (an irritant similar to tear gas) at the tunnel shielding the away side as the Boca team ran out onto the pitch at the Bombonera. The footage, however, was only released after CONMEBOL had ruled on what action to take - a move that fanned numerous conspiracy theories as the South American governing body's decision was widely viewed as lenient. Although Boca forfeited the round- of-16 tie and were expelled from this year's Libertadores, they received no ► Disgraceful...riot police are forced to shield River coach Marcelo Gallardo 28 WORLD SOCCER w'S WORLD SOCCER 29 eyewitness future ban from the tournament. The Superclasico trilogy had promised much. The clubs were joint top of the league, with Boca unbeaten in 17 games after investing heavily in players for this season. And although River had been poor in the Libertadores group stage, they still had the backbone of the side that won the league and Sudamericana Cup last year. In the first meeting, in the league and at the Bombonera, Boca scored twice late on in a turgid affair to win 2-0. In the first leg of the Libertadores game. River had Colombian striker Teo Gutierrez sent off but were comfortable 1-0 winners. Then, in the highly charged return leg that would decide who progressed to the quarter-finals of the Libertadores, River contained Boca for 45 minutes and looked set to win the tie. However, coming out for the second half, several River players were sprayed. Midfielders Leo Ponzio and Matias Kranevitter, and defenders Leonel Vangioni and Ramiro Funes Mori were the worst affected and had to be taken to hospital later that evening. Dario Herrera, the inexperienced referee surprisingly handed a Superclasico for his debut game in the Libertadores, delayed restarting the match. With Boca all set and ready to play, the CONMEBOL official made several phone calls, but for an hour, there was no decision. With pepper spray having been smuggled into the ground, not to mention the drone that was flown above River's players taunting them about their 2011 Mockmg...a drone flies overhead before the game relegation, serious questions have to be asked about security checks at games. It was clear that the game could not continue and it took San Lorenzo coach Edgardo Bauza to point out what seemed to have been lost in the madness when he commented: ‘The players could have been blinded!' While the behaviour of a few supporters who decided to plan and carry out the attack is ample material for study by psychologists and sociologists, there is a broader, cultural issue. When River's players finally left the pitch, bottles and other items rained down on them - not from the barra brava, but from club members in the more expensive seats. Boca's players, meanwhile, applauded the stand from where River's players had been sprayed before they left the pitch. And these type of incidents are not limited to only one club. This was simply the latest, and arguably one of the most shocking, to have occurred. In the aftermath of the game, Boca sued 15 members for over £4million in damages and arguments raged over what Clash...River's Jonathan Maidana (left) and Pablo Perez of Boca LIBERTADORES ROUND-UP Last four...River celebrate victory over Cruzeiro After being awarded a 3-0 win and passage to the quarter-finals of the Libertadores following the abandonment of the game against Boca, River Plate produced a stunning comeback in Brazil to reach the last four. Trailing 1-0 to Cruzeiro from the game in Buenos Aires, River cruised to a 3-0 victory with goals from Carlos Sanchez, Jonathan Maidana and Teofilo Gutierrez. River now face Guarani of Paraguay, who beat Argentinian champions Racing Club 1-0 on aggregate. Behind after the away leg, Racing failed to break down the visitors in the return and were not helped by a red card for goalkeeper Sebastian Saja in the 30 WORLD SOCCER ARGENTINA second leg - even if replacement Nelson Ibanez did save Julian Benitez's penalty. The other semi-final sees Internacional of Brazil take on Tigres, who are only the fourth Mexican team to get this far, after Cruz Azul, America and Guadalajara. Having lost 1-0 in Ecuador, Tigres took just five minutes to level against Emelec in the return, before defender Jose Rivas settled matters 11 minutes from time. Internacional also overcame a 1-0 first-leg loss to progress with a 2-0 home win over Santa Fe of Colombia. A second-minute header from defender Juan levelled the scores on aggregate before an own goal from Baldomero Perlaza settled matters. • Semi-finals to be played July14/15 and 21/22 Raw...Herrera (right) with Boca coach Rodolfo Arruabarrena had happened. For some, the attack was more than just a stupid, irresponsible prank and was viewed as part of a wider internal battle for control of the club's barra brava. Boca president Daniel Angelici resigned as AFA vice-president, saying he “did not want to be part of a system that did not work\". Flowever, the AFA president, Luis Segura, felt obliged to point out that Angelici had made no such complaints about the institution in the previous years of his vice-presidency. While Angelici did admit that the incident was an “international disgrace\", Boca also maintained that the game should have been played to its conclusion and finished on the pitch. Several voices from within the club even suggested that River had tried to take advantage of the fact that four of their players were sprayed with mace. With the attack clearly captured by television cameras for all to see, questions have been asked as to why the company involved in screening the game, Torneos y Competencies, did not release the footage until after the sanctions for Boca had been officially announced. Interestingly, the company's CEO, Alejandro Burzaco was among those indicted by the US justice department in the shock FIFA arrests that followed a few weeks later.

The national team won the 2010 World Cup, in between a 2008 and 2010 European Championship double, and the clubs have carried the flag forward. Barcelona (now twice) and Real Madrid have won half of the first six of the decade's Champions League Finals, while Atletico Madrid and Sevilla have carried off the Europa League twice each. For all the Premier League's worldwide popularity, the glory game is being monopolised by Barcelona and Madrid, and on an individual level, by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo - even if only the Argentinian made it through to Berlin for the 2015 Champions League Final. Above all, Barcelona secured their fifth European triumph in all by seeing off Juventus 3-1 in a Final which provided a welcome respite on the pitch to the 10 days off it dominated by not only FIFA chaos but alleged criminality in Zurich. “This is special...to lift the trophy and dedicate it to the people of Barcelona” Xavi gets his wish in his final game for Barca Goals from Ivan Rakitic, Luis Suarez and Neymar wiped away Juve's hopes of marking the 30th anniversary of the Heysel disaster with a success against the odds. The Italians were briefly on terms through Alvaro Morata early in the second half but Barcelona's overwhelming class and creative brilliance crowned them worthy champions of Europe. Their next target is not merely to attempt to match the six-title year of 2009 but to become the first club to win the Champions League, in its modern incarnation, two seasons in a row. They possess all the attributes, although they will defend the crown next season without Xavi, who emerged from the bench late in the game and carried off the cup before heading to Qatar's Al Sadd. Xavi and three of his team-mates - Gerard Pique, vice-captain Andres Iniesta and Messi - qualified to join an elite club registered previously by only eight players in the 59-year history of the European Cup: winning it four or more times. Previously only one player had managed that status in the Champions League era: Clarence Seedorf (uniquely with three different clubs in Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan). The other multi-winners with four European Cups are Jose Hector Rial and Marquitos (with Real Madrid) and Phil Neal (Liverpool). Jose Maria Zarraga and the great Alfredo Di Stefano both won five, all in Madrid, as did Paolo Maldini with Milan. Out on his own is Madrid's flying winger Francesco Gento, with six European Cups.

He was lined up, of course, along with Pique, Xavi and Iniesta against Manchester United, both in 2009 in Rome and two years later in London, Not that Barcelona and first-season coach Luis Enrique approached Berlin in entirely carefree mood. Tax evasion cases hang over Messi and now Neymar in Brazil - in addition to the impending Spanish court case in which Barcelona and presidents past and present deny having misled the authorities over the Brazilian's 2013 transfer from Santos. Both they and Juventus were pursuing trebles after winning their domestic Spanish and Italian leagues and cups, but the “Old Lady\" was handicapped by a late injury to Italy centre-back Giorgio Chiellini; hence no close encounter of the toothy type with Suarez, recalling their World Cup meeting last summer. He was replaced by Andrea Barzagli. Chiellini issued a battle-cry, urging his “great team-mates...to show the world the courage, strength and determination to achieve our dream\". Words, however fine, cannot always be translated into deeds but Juventus, with a summer’s perspective, should realise they exceeded expectations in not only reaching the Final - eliminating holders Real Madrid in the semi-final - but in surviving two exhilarating bursts of Barcelona wizardry at the start of each half. In the end resilience was not enough, but it never could be on a night when Messi, Suarez and Neymar were on top of their collaborative game, more for the team than individually. Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri acknowledged the fact, saying he regretted only the result, not the “extraordinary\" performance of his team. The MSN strike force had claimed 120 goals between them before the Final but it was the unnoticed Rakitic who put Barcelona ahead after four minutes.

A neat backheel from Claudio Marchisio allowed Lichtsteiner to cross; Carlos Tevez’s shot on the turn was saved by Marc-Andre Ter Stegen but Morata was on hand to fire home. Suddenly Juve had their tails up, but it left them exposed at the back. In the 67th minute Barcelona broke again at speed. Rakitic fed Messi, who unleashed a low drive that Gigi Buffon could only push away, and Suarez followed up for his seventh goal in his last 10 games. Neymar then deflected his header into the goal off his own outstretched arm, but he was not to be denied. In the last minute of stoppage time he finished off another breakaway and the scoreline reflected more realistically the gap between the teams.

Mistakes happen. And against a side like Barca there’s always a small blanket effect going on; you can't cover everything all of the time. Juve played with a midfield diamond as part of the plan to congest the middle, effectively surrendering the flanks to Barca, but that created the avenue into which Jordi Alba surged to knock Messi's pass inside for Neymar. As soon as the decision had been taken to play with a front two - and Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata are key to how Juve break and to the semi-final victory over Real Madrid - that was always the risk. You can't keep both your shoulders and your feet warm at the same time. Three years ago, thanks to the example of Internazionale and Chelsea in the Masters of the ball but not of their own destiny The current Barcelona are more dangerous than Pep Guardiola’s 2011 side but they are also more vulnerable How do you deal with a front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar? It must be the first question any coach who comes up against Barcelona asks, but it is one to which, at the moment, it seems there is no answer. Bayern Munich's former Barca boss. Pep Guardiola, looking at his former side before their semi-final meeting, effectively decided not to bother. He played three man-markers at the back and pressed high into midfield, remembering, perhaps, how Marcelo Bielsa's Athletic Bilbao had unsettled his Barca. Maybe, he seems to have reasoned, unused as they are to being pressed, Barca's midfield could be shaken by having done to them what they had habitually done to others. A handful of through balls from Andres Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic and subsequent near misses, he changed tack. Juventus, less radically, pursued a similar logic in the Champions League Final in Berlin. Although their back four stayed relatively deep, they pressed n Marc-Andre Ter Stegen Attention..Juve defenders stick close to Messi ▼ ▼ Javier Mascherano Gerard Pique ▼ T Dani Alves Jordi Alba T Sergio Busquets T T Ivan Rakitic Andres Iniesta T ▼ Lionel Messi T Neymar Luis Suarez BARCELONA 2015 ferociously. And, for about two-and-a-half minutes, it worked. Javier Mascherano twice misplaced passes. Barca looked rattled. And then, from a throw-in on the left, they held possession for a while to regain their composure, the move slowly blossoming into a 15-pass attack that featured every outfield player, bar Suarez, and ended with Rakitic giving them the lead. Like Alex Ferguson in 2011, Massimiliano Allegri seemed remarkably relaxed in defeat; both knew that against brilliance there just isn't much you can do. There were individual flaws in the build- up. Paul Pogba's positioning seemed oddly high and if he'd been nearer to Messi, perhaps he wouldn't have been able to clip that pass out to the left flank so easily, and Arturo Vidal failed to pick up the run 38 WORLD SOCCER EURO SEASON REVIEW semi-finals of 2010 and 2012, everybody knew that the best way to deal with Barca was to sit deep, deny them space and verticality, and hope they end up passing the ball square across the pitch. The way Barca have evolved - and the remarkable thing is they have done it with only four changes in outfield personnel in Alba, Rakitic, Neymar and Suarez - makes that a far riskier way to play against them. Barca's front three are all fine dribblers - and different types of dribbler: the trickery of Neymar, the minimalist shuffle of Messi, the powerful surge of Suarez. Between them, they dribble on average 12 times per Champions League match - as opposed to the 4.1 times per game Messi, Alexis Sanchez and Pedro did in 2011-12 - and that creates big issues for defences. A blur of feet and they can be past one, two, three opponents - and, once that's happened, any marking structure is in tatters. Other defenders must come across to cover, and when they do, that inevitably leaves other players free. The danger to Barcelona is that running with the ball risks concession of possession: even Messi completes only 65 per cent of his dribbles. The other major difference between this Barcelona and that of Guardiola is its capacity for directness through midfield. Where Xavi would look always for a simple pass, preserving possession, Rakitic takes more risks. He looks for the instant ball, which is more dangerous when it Talent..Neymar and his fellow front men are all fine dribblers Because they take more risks, this Barca never quite has the control that Guardiola’s Barca would reaches the forward as the opposing defence is less likely to be set, but presents a greater possibility of the ball being lost. His pass for Messi for his second goal in the first leg of the semi- final against Bayern was the perfect example of that; his pass to Messi for Barca's second in the final showcased his spatial intelligence. The pass was angled slightly to the left which created the angle for Messi to cut back onto his right foot and send a shot goalwards. But because they take more risks, this Barca never quite has the control that Guardiola's Barca would - even if it is, paradoxically probably better at defending, or at least at defending in its purest sense. Guardiola's side prioritised one aspect of the game - possession - above all else, and with it dominated games almost absolutely, defending by denying the opposition the ball. It's easy to imagine that if it had been Guardiola's side that had taken a fourth-minute lead with a brilliant goal, they'd have killed the game - as, say, Ajax did against Juventus after taking an early lead in the 1973 European Cup Final - by holding possession. They probably wouldn't have created as many chances as this Barca did, but equally they wouldn't have left themselves as open to conceding an equaliser after squandering possession. Buoyed by the equaliser, and by the raucous celebrations from their fans, Juve went on the attack, and for 10 minutes or so the game hung in the balance. But the danger with this Barca is that they are not merely superb with the ball; they are also masters of the counter-attack, as the Suarez and Neymar goals proved. This Barcelona is more varied than the Guardiola incarnation, is capable of playing in more different ways, and is probably harder to stop. But at the same time it has a vulnerability, lacks the same sense of control. It may be more fun to watch, but whether it is better is a slightly different issue. WS I LUIS ENRIQUE (Barcelona coach): \"This Final was spectacular because it was against a top- level opponent.
