        "text": "***\n\nThe England squad departed Heathrow Airport at lunchtime on 7 June, flying out to their UEFA European Championship base camp in Copenhagen. After spending a couple of days adjusting to their new surroundings in Denmark's capital city, the Three Lions were ready to play their final friendly match before the tournament itself got underway.\n\nSituated in the Indre Østerbro district of Copenhagen, the Telia Parken had been Denmark's home stadium since 1992. It would host England's next four matches, including this concluding warm-up fixture against the team who were effectively their landlords.\n\nDespite failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Danish Dynamite were heading into this tournament in high spirits, having lost just one of their previous 12 matches. Norwegian head coach Åge Hareide was proving to be a worthy successor to Morten Olsen, who'd been at the helm for an incredible 15 years between 2000 and 2015.\n\nThe Danish starting line-up featured two Chelsea first-teamers - central defender Andreas Christensen and midfielder Pierre-Emile Højbjerg - as well as Tottenham Hotspur playmaker Christian Eriksen. Keeping goal was Leicester City's Kasper Schmeichel, who had since 2016 been regarded as a Premier League champion in his own right rather than simply as Peter's son.\n\nEngland's number 1 Joe Hart would have to wait for his 100th cap. Instead, Three Lions boss Mark Catterall opted to give 45 minutes apiece to Stoke City's Jack Butland and Everton's Freddie Woodman. This was more a case of Catterall rewarding the pair's patience than punishing Hart for his costly errors against Italy the previous week.\n\nWhile Hart didn't play, his Manchester City defenders Michael Keane and John Stones did feature together. Left-back Luke Shaw - now a European champion with Manchester United - was brought back after being rested against the Azzurri. At the other end of the pitch, Harry Kane and Callum Wilson would lead the English attack.\n\nKane wasted little time in spurring England forward. Just seconds after kick-off, Kane sought out the run of his Tottenham team-mate James Ward-Prowse towards the Danish penalty area. The midfielder's attempted shot took a deflection off Christensen before Schmeichel reacted quickly to push it wide.\n\nEngland sprung another attack in the seventh minute, with captain Jordan Henderson's superb tackle on Danish striker Martin Braithwaite kicking off a counter. Moments later, Wilson's cross to Ward-Prowse was threaded into the area for Kane. It took another fantastic save from Schmeichel to keep this Spur at bay.\n\nDenmark's first attempt on goal came three minutes later, but it wasn't a particularly potent one. Though Højbjerg did manage to get above Keane to meet Eriksen's corner with his head, he couldn't direct it towards goal.\n\nIt wasn't until the 21st minute that the Danish Dynamite exploded into life. Christensen intercepted Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli's attempted lobbed pass to Wilson, and Eriksen beat his friend Alli to the clearance. Eriksen then pumped the ball forward to RB Leipzig forward Yussuf Poulsen, who took advantage of Keane's mistimed jump to go clean through.\n\nThough right-back Calum Chambers got back to close Poulsen down on the edge of England's area, the 25-year-old instead played the ball out right to his 29-year-old strike partner Braithwaite. The Real Sociedad star - whose Guyanese father had passed onto him a very un-Nordic surname - then took advantage of some haphazard English positioning to stab the ball past Butland.\n\nEngland had conceded the first goal, but Catterall was optimistic about rectifying things sooner rather than later. After 24 minutes, Kane got between Simon Kjær and Jannik Vestergaard - Christensen's colleagues in the middle of the Danish backline - to run onto a weighted pass from Wilson. Kane had been stuck on 24 England goals for a while, but Schmeichel's fingertips denied him another chance to bring up his quarter-century.\n\nAnother striker would reach a personal milestone after 33 minutes. Unfortunately for England, that striker was Poulsen, who took advantage of more suspect defending to claim his 20th goal for Denmark.\n\nThe Three Lions had been left badly exposed down their left flank when Chambers' attempted slide tackle on Riza Durmisi was superbly evaded by the Sampdoria wing-back. Durmisi then crossed the ball forward to Poulsen, whose header beat the onrushing Butland and crashed in off the underside of the crossbar. 2-0 to Denmark.\n\nEngland needed inspiration from their captain more than ever, and Henderson duly delivered one of his occasional wonder-goals within five minutes. The Liverpool midfielder's cross into the Denmark box was intercepted by Christensen, whose colleague Daniel Wass then cut out a follow-up header from Ward-Prowse. After that second Danish interception, Henderson rushed towards the ball and volleyed in just his third international goal.\n\nThough the Three Lions had cut the deficit to 2-1, Catterall was not a happy man at half-time. He brought on four substitutes before the restart - Woodman, Danny Rose, Raheem Sterling and Rolando Aarons were selected to replace Butland, Shaw, Wilson and Jack Wilshere.\n\nInside-forward Aarons had some defending to do in the 52nd minute, intercepting a vicious shot from Braithwaite. Rose beat Vestergaard to the interception, only to awkwardly knock the ball out for a Denmark throw-in. It soon became obvious why, as the Tottenham left-back went down signalling that something was wrong with his knee.\n\nRose was given some treatment on the sidelines and then returned for a few minutes. However, he was walking very gingerly and was clearly not in a fit state to see out the match. With no other naturally left-sided defenders to choose from, Catterall had to make do with playing Liverpool right-back Nathaniel Clyne on his 'wrong' flank.\n\nConsidering that much of the Three Lions' play was focussed down the flanks to their wing-backs, having a significant weakness on one side was far from ideal. Nevertheless, they continued to give Denmark's defence a few problems, with Sterling driving a promising shot into Schmeichel's hands just before the hour.\n\nAnother potential equalising opportunity arose in the 67th minute, with Durmisi's cynical foul on Aarons earning England a free-kick. Henderson - by far the Three Lions' most spirited performer on an otherwise disappointing evening - curled it just over the crossbar.\n\nDenmark's best player in this match was arguably their cool and composed ball-playing defender Christensen. The 24-year-old brilliantly got in the way of another Sterling attempt in the 70th minute, and then cleared away crosses from each of England's wing-backs four minutes later.\n\nChristensen's biggest moment came five minutes before the end. He jumped clear of both Stones and Aarons to connect with Eriksen's hanging-ball corner and flick forward a header that just evaded Woodman on its way into the net. That was only Christensen's second goal for the Danish Dynamite, and his first since 2017.\n\nDenmark had been ruthlessly clinical, scoring from all three of their shots on target. England had registered five of those, but Schmeichel had saved every one of them, the last coming from Kane's head in stoppage time.\n\nThat was England's 20th meeting with Denmark, and it had brought them just their fourth defeat. While the 3-1 scoreline was marginally better than the 4-1 loss infamously inflicted on Sven-Göran Eriksson's men in 2005, it still represented arguably the biggest humbling of Catterall's own Three Lions career.\n\n9 June 2020: International Friendly - at Telia Parken, Copenhagen\n\nDenmark - 3 (Martin Braithwaite 21, Yussuf Poulsen 33, Andreas Christensen 85)\n\nEngland - 1 (Jordan Henderson 38)\n\nENGLAND LINE-UP (4-3-1-2): Jack Butland (Freddie Woodman); Calum Chambers, Michael Keane, John Stones, Luke Shaw (Danny Rose (Nathaniel Clyne)); Dele Alli (Danny Drinkwater), Jordan Henderson, James Ward-Prowse; Jack Wilshere (Rolando Aarons); Callum Wilson (Raheem Sterling), Harry Kane.\n\nAs England's demoralised players and coaches trudged into the dressing room at full-time, Catterall muttered under his breath, \"F***, f***, f***, f***, F***!\"\n\n\"Sudden bout of Tourette's, Mark?\" assistant manager Michael Burke asked.\n\nCatterall snapped, \"You trying to be funny, eh? After THE worst result of my four years in this job!\"\n\n\"Well, what did you expect when you picked the wrong players?\"\n\n\"You were the one who convinced me to bring in an extra midfielder!\"\n\n\"Yeah, but YOU were the one who picked that layabout Sterling! I KNEW you should've gone with Michail Antonio instead!\"\n\nA shirtless Raheem Sterling stormed over to Burke asking, \"You what, mate?\"\n\nBurke growled, \"I'm saying that you're a layabout who'd rather shag like George Best than play like him!\"\n\nSterling clenched his right fist and was ready to swing at Burke before Catterall stepped in, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's enough! This is meant to be a football team, not a boxing club!\"\n\nCatterall laid his hand on Sterling's left shoulder and told him, \"Calm down, Raheem. I'm not blaming you for anything.\"\n\nThe manager then called out, \"ALL OF YOU should be ashamed of yourselves! Your attacks didn't have any bite, the midfield was all too easily dominated, and the less said about the defending, the better! All in all, it was an ABSOLUTE F***ING SHAMBLES - the kind of farce we'd expect from a SCOTLAND team!\n\n\"If you repeat tonight's performance against Turkey or Romania, you can forget about challenging for the Euros. Instead, you'll all be back home before the knockout rounds, and you know what that means! Me and Mick will be out of work, and none of you will be able to show your faces in public again!\"\n\nCatterall then turned back to Burke, growling at him, \"As for you, Michael... why don't you pick on someone your own size, eh? Raheem's much taller than you, for crying out loud! He could've beaten you to a pulp if he wanted!\"\n\nBurke nodded his head reluctantly and then addressed the players to deliver his own post-match dressing-down. Meanwhile, Catterall headed over to the physio table, where David Fevre was treating Danny Rose's knee injury. The left-back was still wincing in obvious pain.\n\nCatterall asked, \"What's the prognosis, Dave?\"\n\nFevre sighed, \"It's what we suspected. Dan's twisted his knee. He'll miss our first two group games, at least.\"\n\nCatterall let out a huge sigh of exasperation. \"F*************k!\"\n\n***\n\nIt was a 15-minute drive from the Telia Parken to the Hotel D'Angleterre - the aptly-named lodging where the England team were staying during their time in Copenhagen. This 5-star hotel had housed many of the great and the good in the past: pop stars, US Presidents, the King of Spain, and even David Beckham!\n\nThe team arrived there just before 11:00pm local time. Before checking into his suite, Mark Catterall had a private conversation with Michael Burke, eager to clear the air after a heated argument in the wake of England's 3-1 friendly defeat to Denmark.\n\n\"I think I owe you an apology, Mark,\" Michael said.\n\nMark admitted, \"If anything, I should be apologising to you. There was no need for me to fly off the handle like that.\"\n\n\"And there was no need for me to question your calls regarding Raheem Sterling. I know you picked everyone in the squad for a reason.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I live and die by my decisions.\"\n\nMichael expressed some doubts about England's chances at the upcoming UEFA European Championship, asking, \"We are going to get out of our group, right?\"\n\n\"I hope so, Mick, but it's not a given,\" Mark responded pessimistically. \"We've got a lot of work to do after those last few results.\"\n\n\"The fans will be gunning for your head after tonight. And I'd hate to think what the papers will write.\"\n\n\"They'll take any opportunity to criticise me, so just let them. I'm sure we can win them over again if we put our minds to it and get back to playing like we know we can.\"\n\n\"Alright, then, Mark,\" Michael nodded. \"I'm gonna turn in now. See you in the morning.\"\n\n\"Goodnight, Mick,\" Mark said as he shook Michael's hand. \"See you later.\"\n\nMark then entered his suite, which was adjacent to Michael's. Upon taking off his jacket, he hurled it to the floor in disgust. He then sat down on his bed and brought out his phone to make a call.\n\n\"Hello?\" came the answer from Mark's wife Jenny.\n\n\"Hi, Jen, it's me,\" Mark said, with an air of despondency. \"I... I need someone to talk to right now.\"\n\n\"I though as much after tonight's result. Dreadful, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"You watched the game, then?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Luke and I sat up for it. Luke was distraught at full-time. Didn't say a word before he went to bed.\"\n\nMark sighed, \"Jesus Christ... now I really feel like I've let our boy down.\"\n\n\"He'll feel better in the morning.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I'm not sure I will. We were awful from start to finish! We didn't feel like a team; we felt like 17 random fellas who'd been dragged in from a shopping centre!\"\n\n\"Don't stress yourself over it, Mark. It was only a friendly, and Denmark had the crowd on their side.\"\n\nMark groaned, \"It's not just the result! This is the first time in 30 years that England have looked like they could win something, but now the players have buckled under the pressure, before the tournament's even begun! We've lost three of our four warm-up games, Jenny!\"\n\nJenny tried to put a spin on things, saying, \"I guess that's why you call them warm-up games. You're just warming up for the Euros.\"\n\n\"Well, right now, we still look very cold. There's six days to go until our first group game, and we've not won in over six months! The Turks, the Romanians, the Swiss... they'll be licking their lips right about now!\"\n\n\"You'll get through this, Mark. Anyway, I'd better go to bed now...\"\n\nMark interrupted, \"Come to Copenhagen. Please.\"\n\n\"Sorry?\"\n\n\"Join me in Copenhagen. I could do with having you around right now.\"\n\nJenny sighed, \"I can't, Mark. You know Luke's still got school.\"\n\n\"We can get someone to babysit him while we're away, can't we?\"\n\n\"WHO, Mark? Who can babysit him? My parents are going to Bilbao on Friday, and it's not as if your mum can look after Luke in her state!\"\n\nMark suggested, \"My sister Jo's off work for a fortnight. She and Katie would be more than happy to come over from Accrington and care for Luke if I asked them to.\"\n\nJenny did not reply, so Mark offered up another suggestion. \"Alright... what about Julia?\"\n\n\"Michael's wife?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Charlie's just moved out, and Josh is still at university, so Julia's all by herself at the moment. Besides, she used to be a teaching assistant at a special school. She knows just how to look after children like Luke.\"\n\n\"Luke isn't autistic.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean!\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Jenny agreed. \"I'll... I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"Smashing. I'm sure you'll love it here. You can go see that Little Mermaid statue, and all the famous sights from some of your favourite TV shows - 'The Killing', 'The Bridge', 'Borgen'.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've always wanted to visit Denmark. It's one of the countries on my bucket list.\"\n\n\"All the more reason to come over, then!\"\n\nJenny sighed, \"I'm going to sleep on it, Mark. I'll let you know some time tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Alright, then. Well, I'm about to hit the hay myself, so... talk to you later, love?\"\n\n\"Talk to you later. Goodnight.\"\n\n\"Ta-ra.\"\n\nMark hung up and then turned on the television. As he untied his shoelaces, he noticed that one of Britain's most popular programmes was being shown on DR1 - the main TV station of what was essentially the Danish Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nHe muttered, \"They give us all their best dramas, and we give them bloody 'Bodyguard'. Hardly a fair deal, is it?\"\n\nChapter 37 - Things Can Only Get Better\n\nWhile England were participating in the Group Stage of UEFA Euro 2020, they would be training at FC København's facilities in Frederiksberg - about 20 minutes west of their hotel. If its name of 'Nummer 10' was anything to go by, then Callum Wilson - the man given that squad number by manager Mark Catterall - would surely have a lot to look forward to over the coming weeks.\n\nAs the countdown towards England's first group match continued, though, Wilson and his colleagues came under increasing pressure from the supporters and the media back home. Three defeats and a draw in their four pre-tournament friendlies did not bode well for upcoming fixtures against Turkey, Romania and Switzerland.\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday 12 June, just four days before that opener against Turkey, Catterall sat down in the England canteen to have lunch with his assistant Michael Burke, Football Association chairman Clark Gregory, and communications chief Ava Leggett.\n\nGregory had just arrived in the Danish capital for crisis talks with Catterall following the shock 3-1 defeat to Denmark three days earlier. He began, \"You don't need me to tell you, Mark, but Tuesday was a disaster. In all my years with the FA, all four of them, that was the most embarrassment I'd ever felt.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Burke asked. \"Iceland was pretty bad.\"\n\n\"Oh, please,\" Gregory scoffed. \"I was only a few weeks in the job. That disaster was the making of Greg Dickhead and Roy Hodgson.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Anyway, you two had better shape up. Losing is a tough habit to get out of.\"\n\n\"Trust us, Clark,\" Catterall said. \"Things can only get better from now on.\"\n\n\"Things can only get better? That's the sort of New Labour bulls*** Connie Millstone would've come up with. Did you hear that daft cow's got a new job?\"\n\nThat comment piqued Leggett's interest. \"Oh, where's she gone?\"\n\n\"Channel 4. She's heading up their 'Equality & Diversity' department. In other words, if you're a black, ginger, lesbian midget in a wheelchair who votes Lib Dem, then you're in luck; Connie would like you to work with Jon Snow and Cathy Newman on the Channel 4 News!\"\n\nCatterall rolled his eyes before Gregory continued, \"But I digress. We are drifting back into our old ways. We're losing our nerve against stronger opposition, and now we're showing complacency against teams that we really should be sending back home in bin bags!\"\n\nCatterall said, \"I wouldn't put it quite like that, but yeah, I get what you mean.\"\n\n\"The players have been doing overtime on the training ground since Denmark,\" Burke said. \"Me and Warren [Joyce] have been working them into the ground, and David [Platt] doesn't stop until each of our strikers have attempted 27 volleys every morning.\"\n\nLeggett warned, \"Try not to overwork them. Fabio Capello was guilty of that in 2010.\"\n\nGregory responded, \"To be fair, those Germans could've destroyed any team on the planet. Except Spain, of course.\"\n\nCatterall reassured the pair, \"Don't worry; we won't go overboard. We're all going out later this afternoon to play some laser tag. I'm thinking that might build team cohesion and lift some tension off the lads' shoulders.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Gregory nodded, before getting off his seat. \"Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna have a word with the dinner lady. Those bloody carrots taste like sticks!\"\n\nAs Gregory picked up his tray and headed towards the kitchen, Leggett asked Catterall, \"How's your family, Mark?\"\n\n\"They're golden, thanks for asking,\" Catterall smiled. \"I asked Jenny if she could come over for a few days. Unfortunately, her work schedule's hectic right now, so it don't look like that'll be happening. On the plus side, Luke's making great progress at school.\"\n\nBurke chimed in, \"Yeah, Julia told me about that. She said that she'd be happy to look after Luke if Jenny wanted to pop by.\"\n\n\"That's great. Wish I could say there was good news about my dear mum, though.\"\n\nLeggett asked, \"Oh, what's happened?\"\n\nCatterall sighed, \"She had a nasty fall a few days ago and has been in hospital since. Things are bad enough as it is...\"\n\nCatterall then took a deep breath, before resuming, \"...but now the doctors don't hold much hope for Mum. The chemo's not working, and the cancer's spread to her bones and liver. They say she might not last the month.\"\n\n\"Oh, my goodness,\" Leggett gasped. \"I really hope she gets well soon, but... that doesn't sound good.\"\n\nBurke asked Catterall, \"So, there's a chance your mum might... die... during the tournament?\"\n\n\"I'm trying not to think about that, Michael, but yes, there's a chance,\" Catterall conceded.\n\n\"Okay. But if things do take a turn for the worse, I'll be ready to step in for you. I've always got your back.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't trust anyone else.\"\n\nLeggett sighed, and then said, \"Now, on another subject... Mark, would you be willing to take an hour of your time to film an advert tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Who's it with?\" Catterall asked.\n\n\"BetVictor.\"\n\n\"No, thanks. I want nothing to do with gambling companies. They're manipulative leeches, the lot of them. And don't even get me started on Ray Winstone!\"\n\n\"Why not? This is the perfect time to capitalise on commercial opportunities. A lot of your players have got big advertising deals for the Euros.\"\n\nBurke said, \"She's right, Catts. Cosmetics companies are all over our boys. Freddie Woodman's got a deal with Head & Shoulders, Nat Clyne's got one with Nivea, Jordan Henderson's the face of Brylcreem...\"\n\n\"And let me guess... Eric Dier's done an ad for Gillette shaving cream!\"\n\n\"How the hell did you know that? That ain't even been shown in Britain yet!\"\n\nLeggett continued, \"Just four weeks ago, we had John Stones recreate the classic Hovis bike advert in Dorset. We also had Luke Shaw do some promotional material for the Euro 2020 video game...\"\n\n\"Hang on, Ava,\" Catterall interrupted. \"Are these ad men only interested in our defensive players?\"\n\n\"No, Mark. Harry Kane did that ad for Tesco, didn't he? That's the one where he earned Clubcard points, got some goals, saved 25% on semi-skimmed milk...\"\n\nBurke finished the sentence, \"And got some more goals!\"\n\nCatterall raised a smile, but he was adamant that he wouldn't follow his players into advertising. \"It's still a no, Ava. I'm not interested in selling out.\"\n\n\"Okay, then,\" Leggett nodded, before asking, \"Just out of interest... what would it take to convince you?\"\n\n***\n\nThe magical mystery tour that was UEFA Euro 2020 was about to start. Over the course of 30 days, 47 matches would be placed in 13 different cities across Europe between 24 national teams who had the aim of becoming continental champions.\n\nHaving broken a cycle of chronic underachievement by finishing 3rd at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, England were optimistic that 2020 would be their year. The men's national team had never even reached a European Championship Final, but with Wembley Stadium set to host the latter stages, this was a huge opportunity to claim major silverware.\n\nManager Mark Catterall had stayed loyal to many of the players whom he had coached to the World Cup Semi Finals two years earlier. Of the 23 players who won bronze medals in Russia, 18 had been retained for the following tournament. Catterall perhaps saw continuity as one of the keys to success.\n\nThe unlucky quintet who had been cut were Fraser Forster, Demarai Gray, Phil Jones, Adam Lallana and Nathan Redmond. The five players called up in their places were all aged 26 or under, and three would make their major tournament debuts.\n\nSo, who were the 23 lions who would never stop dreaming of ending half a century of hurt? Would they bring football home and inspire thousands of Internet memes, or would they throw it away all over again?\n\n1. Joe Hart\n\nPOSITIONS: Goalkeeper. CLUB: Manchester City. ESTIMATED VALUE: £4million.\n\nAGE: 33. BORN: 19 April 1987 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. HEIGHT: 6ft 5in. WEIGHT: 12st 8lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 99 caps, 0 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS: WC 2010, Euro 2012, WC 2014, Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nEven though his form for club and country had noticeably dipped in recent months, Hart would head into a fifth successive tournament as England's first-choice keeper. He remained an agile and flexible custodian who could thrive on the biggest stages for club and country.\n\n2. Nathaniel Clyne\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender/Wing-Back (Right). CLUB:Liverpool. ESTIMATED VALUE:£10.5million.\n\nAGE: 29. BORN:5 April 1991 in Stockwell, London. HEIGHT:5ft 9in. WEIGHT:10st 7lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 41 caps, 0 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nFew players in the England squad could match Clyne when it came to endurance and physical fitness. The marauding right-back had shown incredible determination and spirit to win back his national team place after a rough start to his fifth season at Liverpool.\n\n3. Danny Rose\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender/Wing-Back (Left). CLUB:Tottenham Hotspur. ESTIMATED VALUE:£15.75million.\n\nAGE: 29. BORN:2 July 1990 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. HEIGHT:5ft 8in. WEIGHT:11st 6lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 34 caps, 2 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nRose had become a core part of the England set-up under Catterall, thanks mainly to his incredible consistency and his fierce passion. The pacey full-back was prone to injuries, though, and he would miss at least the first two group matches with a twisted knee.\n\n4. Danny Drinkwater\n\nPOSITIONS: Midfielder (Centre). CLUB: Leicester City. ESTIMATED VALUE: £8.25million.\n\nAGE: 30. BORN: 5 March 1990 in Manchester. HEIGHT: 5ft 10in. WEIGHT: 11st 0lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 31 caps, 0 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS: WC 2018.\n\nDrinkwater had been an understated but very popular presence in the England squad for the past four years. Primarily a box-to-box midfielder, he was technically a very astute passer and undoubtedly a Leicester icon after nearly a decade of service.\n\n5. Gary Cahill\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender (Centre). CLUB: CSKA Moscow. ESTIMATED VALUE: £1.1million.\n\nAGE: 34. BORN: 19 December 1985 in Dronfield, Derbyshire. HEIGHT: 6ft 4in. WEIGHT: 13st 7lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 69 caps, 3 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS: WC 2014, Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nSightings of Cahill in an England jersey were less common than they had been, but he would always put in spirited performances whenever called upon. Two strong seasons in Russia had helped prolong the centre-half's international career to a fourth and final tournament.\n\n6. John Stones\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender (Centre). CLUB:Manchester City. ESTIMATED VALUE:£35.5million.\n\nAGE: 26. BORN:28 May 1994 in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. HEIGHT:6ft 2in. WEIGHT:12st 3lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 42 caps, 1 goal. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nDubbed by one journalist as the 'Barnsley Baresi' after Italy and AC Milan legend Franco, Stones was not your typical English defender. His ball-playing skills and fast-improving defensive qualities showed exactly why he was the Three Lions' best-paid player on £205,000 per week at City.\n\n7. James Ward-Prowse\n\nPOSITIONS: Midfielder, Attacking Midfielder (Centre). CLUB:Tottenham Hotspur. ESTIMATED VALUE:£22.5million.\n\nAGE: 25. BORN:1 November 1994 in Portsmouth, Hampshire. HEIGHT:5ft 8in. WEIGHT:10st 5lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 13 caps, 2 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:none.\n\nWard-Prowse had been a Tottenham semi-regular since signing from Southampton in 2017, but his versatility made him a popular pick for Catterall. The midfielder could play as a deep-lying playmaker or in a more advanced role, and he was a specialist when it came to set-pieces.\n\n8. Dele Alli\n\nPOSITIONS: Midfielder/Attacking Midfielder (Centre). CLUB:Tottenham Hotspur. ESTIMATED VALUE:£34million.\n\nAGE: 24. BORN:11 April 1996 in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. HEIGHT:6ft 1in. WEIGHT:12st 1lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 52 caps, 5 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nAlli was arguably one of England's most creative players, but Catterall had recently struggled to get the best out of this enigmatic talent. While he had curbed his competitive streak recently, the playmaker had perhaps lost a bit of his edge in the process.\n\n9. Harry Kane\n\nPOSITIONS: Striker (Centre). CLUB:Tottenham Hotspur. ESTIMATED VALUE:£34million.\n\nAGE: 26. BORN:28 July 1993 in Chingford, London. HEIGHT:6ft 3in. WEIGHT:13st 0lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 49 caps, 24 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nEngland's most consistent frontman by some margin, Kane had over 125 Premier League goals to his name and was idolised by Tottenham fans. The hard-working centre-forward could use his power and finishing abilities to terrorise elite defences on his day.\n\n10. Callum Wilson\n\nPOSITIONS: Striker (Centre). CLUB:Chelsea. ESTIMATED VALUE:£28million.\n\nAGE: 28. BORN:27 February 1992 in Coventry, West Midlands. HEIGHT:5ft 11in. WEIGHT:10st 7lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 35 caps, 12 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:WC 2018.\n\nWilson's explosive pace and devastating form at club level could make one wonder why he wasn't so effective in an England jersey. His international scoring record wasn't bad on the face of it, but half of those 12 goals had come in one match against minnows Gibraltar.\n\n11. Rolando Aarons\n\nPOSITIONS: Midfielder/Attacking Midfielder (Left). CLUB:West Ham United. ESTIMATED VALUE:£11.25million.\n\nAGE: 24. BORN:16 November 1995 in Kingston, Jamaica. HEIGHT:5ft 9in. WEIGHT:10st 5lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 17 caps, 6 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:WC 2018.\n\nAarons' career was transformed by some fantastic performances at the 2018 World Cup, in which the inside-forward suddenly became an England regular. He'd not quite been the same force since leaving Newcastle United, but he still had the capacity to change matches if required.\n\n12. Michael Keane\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender (Centre). CLUB:Manchester City. ESTIMATED VALUE:£30.5million.\n\nAGE: 27. BORN:11 January 1993 in Stockport, Greater Manchester. HEIGHT:6ft 1in. WEIGHT:13st 3lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 29 caps, 0 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:WC 2018.\n\nA consistent presence for both City and England, Keane was now regarded as one of Europe's top central defenders. His pace and physical strength made him just as capable of playing in a covering role as in his more usual position of defensive stopper.\n\n13. Jack Butland\n\nPOSITIONS: Goalkeeper. CLUB: Stoke City. ESTIMATED VALUE: £18.75million.\n\nAGE: 27. BORN: 10 March 1993 in Bristol. HEIGHT: 6ft 5in. WEIGHT: 14st 13lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 11 caps, 0 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS: Euro 2012, WC 2018.\n\nButland had more resilience than most players, but it was a surprise that he'd not won more international caps. While he was very agile and imposing, his decision to stay at mid-table Stoke instead of pursuing a big-money move had perhaps held his England career back.\n\n14. Jordan Henderson\n\nPOSITIONS: Defensive Midfielder/Midfielder (Centre). CLUB:Liverpool. ESTIMATED VALUE:£17million.\n\nAGE: 29. BORN:17 June 1990 in Sunderland, Tyne & Wear. HEIGHT:6ft 0in. WEIGHT:10st 7lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 67 caps, 3 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2012, WC 2014, Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nAs captain for club and country, Henderson was always Catterall's first name on the England teamsheet whenever he was fully fit and available. The north-eastern midfield workhorse relished the big stage and was the consummate professional, both on and off the field.\n\n15. Eric Dier\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender/Defensive Midfielder (Centre). CLUB:Tottenham Hotspur. ESTIMATED VALUE:£38.5million.\n\nAGE: 26. BORN:15 January 1994 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. HEIGHT:6ft 2in. WEIGHT:13st 7lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 48 caps, 6 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nCatterall's England were always much more imposing opponents whenever Dier was getting stuck into challenges from midfield. The fearless Tottenham ace had a penchant for scoring spectacular goals at one end and often being in the right place at just the right time.\n\n16. Ross Barkley\n\nPOSITIONS: Midfielder/Attacking Midfielder (Centre). CLUB: Everton. ESTIMATED VALUE:£23.5million.\n\nAGE: 26. BORN: 5 December 1993 in Liverpool. HEIGHT: 6ft 2in. WEIGHT: 11st 13lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 33 caps, 3 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS: WC 2014, Euro 2016.\n\nBarkley was a midfield powerhouse who often promised much but didn't deliver as much as many Toffees and Three Lions supporters would like. While he was clearly a fine advanced playmaker with excellent dribbling abilities, he was perhaps a little on the lazy side.\n\n17. Raheem Sterling\n\nPOSITIONS: Attacking Midfielder (Right/Left/Centre). CLUB:Sampdoria. ESTIMATED VALUE:£1.3million.\n\nAGE: 25. BORN:8 December 1994 in Kingston, Jamaica. HEIGHT:5ft 7in. WEIGHT:10st 12lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 32 caps, 3 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:WC 2014, Euro 2016.\n\nMainly a right-winger who could race past full-backs with ease, Sterling was a divisive and often frustrating figure amongst England fans. This precocious, creative talent had been largely wasted at Manchester City before a loan spell in Italy rejuvenated him this season.\n\n18. Jack Wilshere\n\nPOSITIONS: Midfielder/Attacking Midfielder (Centre). CLUB:Arsenal. ESTIMATED VALUE:£20million.\n\nAGE: 28. BORN:1 January 1992 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. HEIGHT:5ft 9in. WEIGHT:10st 3lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 68 caps, 11 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:WC 2014, Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nWilshere's reputation as an injury-prone waster was now well and truly behind him. The flamboyant attacking midfielder had been excellent for Premier League runners-up Arsenal this term and was now his country's main creative spark.\n\n19. Daniel Sturridge\n\nPOSITIONS: Striker (Centre). CLUB:Valencia. ESTIMATED VALUE:£12.75million.\n\nAGE: 30. BORN:1 September 1989 in Birmingham. HEIGHT:6ft 0in. WEIGHT:12st 6lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 44 caps, 26 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:WC 2014, Euro 2016, WC 2018.\n\nNobody had scored more goals for England under Catterall than Sturridge - an ice-cool poacher who could finish with the best of them. The Liverpool striker had rediscovered his best form on loan at Valencia and had since agreed to join the Spanish giants permanently.\n\n20. Calum Chambers\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender (Right/Centre). CLUB:Everton. ESTIMATED VALUE:£14.25million.\n\nAGE: 25. BORN:20 January 1995 in Portsmouth, Hampshire. HEIGHT:6ft 0in. WEIGHT:11st 6lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 14 caps, 0 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:none.\n\nChambers only featured occasionally for England until this season, when he established himself as the Three Lions' main right-back. He had excelled for Everton with his work ethic, though he perhaps needed to brush up on his crossing to reach the very top.\n\n21. Marcus Rashford\n\nPOSITIONS: Attacking Midfielder (Left), Striker (Centre). CLUB:Wolfsburg. ESTIMATED VALUE:£31million.\n\nAGE: 22. BORN:31 October 1997 in Manchester. HEIGHT:5ft 11in. WEIGHT:11st 9lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 7 caps, 4 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:Euro 2016.\n\nTipped for the top since his Manchester United breakthrough in 2016, Rashford was only now starting to live up to the hype. The striker and occasional inside-forward had made full use of his explosive pace and creativity while on loan in the Bundesliga.\n\n22. Freddie Woodman\n\nPOSITIONS: Goalkeeper. CLUB:Everton. ESTIMATED VALUE:£4.4million.\n\nAGE: 23. BORN:4 March 1997 in London. HEIGHT:6ft 1in. WEIGHT:11st 2lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 2 caps, 0 goals. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:none.\n\nEngland's penalty shoot-out hero at the 2019 European Under-21s Championship, Woodman was now set to take part in the senior equivalent. The cool-headed, humble son of a lower-league journeyman had kept 14 clean sheets in all competitions for Everton this term.\n\n23. Luke Shaw\n\nPOSITIONS: Defender (Left). CLUB:Manchester United. ESTIMATED VALUE:£41million.\n\nAGE: 24. BORN:12 July 1995 in Kingston-upon-Thames, London. HEIGHT:6ft 1in. WEIGHT:11st 11lb.\n\nENGLAND RECORD: 38 caps, 1 goal. MAJOR TOURNAMENTS:WC 2014, WC 2018.\n\nIt was hard to dispute that Shaw was England's best player, and perhaps even their only truly world-class one. After some early criticism from José Mourinho, the left-back had put in the hard yards at United, and the list of honours on his CV was growing by the season.\n\n***\n\nThe 2020 UEFA European Championship - the so-called 'Festival of Football' - kicked off at 5:00pm on 13 June in Glasgow. Hampden Park was one of 13 venues across the continent that would stage matches in the most extravagant Euros yet.\n\nIt was world champions Belgium who would have the honour of kicking off proceedings, facing Wales at one of the United Kingdom's most iconic football grounds. Roberto Martínez's Red Devils took a long while to get going, but they eventually clinched victory in the final minute through a breakaway goal from Wolfsburg's Michy Batshuayi.\n\nIt was Batshuayi who had famously ended England's hopes of glory at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The Three Lions' quest to win their next major tournament would formally begin on 16 June, on the fourth day of the competition.\n\nGroup C had kicked off with a dour goalless afternoon draw between Switzerland and Romania at Munich's Allianz Arena. Fireworks would be expected that evening, when England faced Turkey at the Telia Parken in Copenhagen.\n\nEngland headed into the Euros as favourites to win their group, though their form suggested nothing of the sort. Mark Catterall's men were on a four-match winless streak in 2020, and another failure here would represent their worst run of results since the farcical 2014 World Cup.\n\nCatterall reinstated two of his most established players in an attempt to stop the rot. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart became the 10th Englishman to win 100 caps for England, while Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane brought up his half-century. Kane would head the attack, with Rolando Aarons and Raheem Sterling expected to provide plenty of service from the wings.\n\nEngland possessed a proud record of never having lost to Turkey in 11 previous encounters, though most of those meetings were back in the days when the Crescent-Stars were notoriously sub-standard. Hoping to record a historic win for the Turks was head coach Abdullah Avcı, who was taking part in his first international tournament.\n\nTurkey would have plenty of home support, as Real Madrid forward Emre Mor was a son of Copenhagen immigrants. Most of their goals tended to come from Schalke 04's Hakan Çalhanoglu, who'd scored 27 of them in 54 caps and was a virtuoso at free-kicks. Catterall would instruct his England players to ease off their tackles, so as to limit the flamboyant 26-year-old's set-piece opportunities.\n\nThings were tense to begin with, but England threatened to open the scoring after midfielder Danny Drinkwater intercepted an attempted cross from Turkish wideman Orkan Çınar in the sixth minute. Drinkwater's knock-down found Sterling, who played the ball first-time to Kane before it was knocked ahead of Dele Alli.\n\nAlli surged towards the Turkish penalty area, and for a while, it looked like he would go for goal himself. As centre-half Çaglar Söyüncü closed him down, Alli instead laid the ball off to Aarons, who had a pop from 20 yards out. The West Ham United attacker's vicious strike was punched away by Turkey goalkeeper Onur Kıvrak.\n\nIn the eighth minute, it was Turkey's turn to give England some food for thought. 34-year-old midfielder and captain Mehmet Topal fed Çınar's deflected cross on to Çalhanoglu, who turned past defender John Stones and then unleashed a long-range shot. Hart made a fine catch, and England's newest centurion would also keep out Çalhanoglu's next effort two minutes later.\n\nAfter Hart's latter save, Çınar sent an inswinging corner into the English penalty area. Söyüncü leapt above counterpart Michael Keane to win the header, but he could only flick it over the crossbar.\n\nEngland would have to withstand another corner in the 19th minute, after a Çalhanoglu deflected behind off Keane. This time, Keane made a comfortable interception of Mor's wayward delivery from the left.\n\nAs the half wore on, the Three Lions started to horrendously waste possession on a regular basis. Playing Aarons and Sterling as wingers wouldn't work if England's direct game wasn't on point, so Catterall soon made the decision to revert to his usual tactics. The wingers switched flanks and became inside-forwards, while Catterall instructed captain Jordan Henderson and his fellow midfielders to cut down on risky long passes.\n\nIn the 33rd minute, Sterling - now playing on the left - was taken out by twin tackles from Turkey right-back Kaan Ayhan and attacking midfielder Yunus Malli. It was Ayhan who took the ball and started what would prove to be an effective counter-attack from the Crescent-Stars.\n\nWithin moments, Çalhanoglu had played an excellent ball to Malli on the edge of the England area. Keane managed to close Malli down, but he couldn't get a tackle in before the Wolfsburg midfielder fed it back to Topal in space. Topal had a decent long shot in his locker, and Hart found that out when the Fenerbahçe stalwart emphatically volleyed the ball into the top corner from 25 yards out. With just his second international goal, Topal had sent Turkey 1-0 up.\n\nBefore the match, Catterall had feared that England would potentially pay the price for being overzealous. Now the opposite was coming to pass; their reduced aggression was allowing Turkey to dictate terms.\n\nThe Crescent-Stars would go into the interval with a narrow lead, and with a couple of yellow cards to their players' names. Mor had been cautioned by Spanish referee Antonio Miguel Matéu Lahoz for a trip on Aarons in the 34th minute. Six minutes later, midfielder Okay Yokuşlu joined him in the book for a tackle on Sterling that Matéu Lahoz adjudged to be anything but 'okay'.\n\nCatterall was most certainly not satisfied with his team's performances in the first half. He switched to another system - the 4-4-2 diamond - and subbed off both Drinkwater and Aarons. Sterling kept his place and was now playing as an attacking midfielder behind Kane and substitute Daniel Sturridge. Meanwhile, Eric Dier came on to anchor the midfield.\n\nEngland looked rather more like themselves with the diamond. A 51st-minute corner from Sterling looked very promising until Kıvrak advanced from his goal line to claim the delivery ahead of Alli. A minute later, England right-back Nathaniel Clyne's interception of a Kıvrak punt started a move that resulted in Kane stroking Alli's delightful through-ball home. Unfortunately for them, Kane was caught well offside.\n\nNevertheless, the Three Lions were starting to come into the game, and an equaliser was looking likely... until disaster struck in the 58th minute. After running onto a square ball from captain Henderson, left-back Luke Shaw suddenly felt a twinge in his groin and collapsed to the turf in obvious pain. Ayhan sportingly put the ball out of play so that England's medical staff could attend to the stricken Manchester United superstar.\n\nShaw tried to play on through the pain after receiving some treatment. By the 65th minute, though, it had become clear that he would be doing himself more harm than good by continuing. Instead, Catterall reluctantly told Clyne to switch to the left flank, and sent Everton's Calum Chambers on at right-back to deputise for Shaw.\n\nAt around the same time, Avcı made his first two substitutions. Replacing the ineffective Çalhanoglu up front was Ajaccio striker Enes Ünal, who had previously spent four years on Manchester City's books without actually playing for them. Meanwhile, Hannover 96's Kenan Karaman was brought on to take over from Çınar on the left wing.\n\nAfter 73 minutes, one of the substitutes would make their mark. A flowing passing move from England culminated in Chambers surging unmarked from the right flank to pick up a fantastically weighted delivery from Alli. The full-back's cross was then met by a close-range volley from Kane, who leapt into the air with delight after drawing his team level.\n\nKane's long-awaited 25th goal for England was not without controversy. Avcı and many of his players - Söyüncü chief among them - protested that the Spurs hotshot was offside. Matéu Lahoz disagreed, and he pointed to the centre-circle for a second time to reiterate that the scoreline was now 1-1.\n\nAvcı then played his final card, with Mor coming off after a fine midfield display. His place was taken by Beşiktaş right-winger Gökhan Töre, whose loan spell at West Ham in 2016/2017 had been a largely forgettable one.\n\nTwo minutes after England's equaliser, Catterall had another injury to rack his head around. Sturridge had accidentally trod on Sterling's right foot while both men went after a loose ball. The enigmatic Sampdoria attacker was in some agony afterwards, though he had to carry on playing.\n\nDespite that latest scare, England still pushed for a late goal to try and clinch the three points. In the 85th minute, Alli exchanged passes with a hampered Sterling before passing to Sturridge, who miscued his shot, albeit from a somewhat difficult angle.\n\nThe Three Lions would be doubly unlucky not to score on 88 minutes. Firstly, Henderson's corner delivery to Stones was headed against the crossbar by a player who'd still only scored one international goal. A few moments later, Clyne intercepted Kıvrak's goal kick and flicked it to Sterling, who then centred the ball to Alli. After taking the ball forward, Alli unleashed a hit-and-hoper that ended up safely in the goalkeeper's hands.\n\n1-1 was how it finished, and in truth, that was perhaps a fair scoreline. Each side had seven shots at goal and four on target apiece, while there had been close to an even split in possession. Turkey were by far the dirtier team, but if their aim was to ruffle a few feathers and cause England real problems, they had certainly succeeded.\n\n16 June 2020: UEFA European Championship Group C - at Telia Parken, Copenhagen\n\nEngland - 1 (Harry Kane 73)\n\nTurkey - 1 (Mehmet Topal 33)\n\nENGLAND LINE-UP (4-2-3-1): Joe Hart; Nathaniel Clyne, Michael Keane, John Stones, Luke Shaw (Calum Chambers); Danny Drinkwater (Eric Dier), Jordan Henderson; Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli, Rolando Aarons (Daniel Sturridge); Harry Kane.\n\nThe good news was that England were now top of Group C. The bad news was that it was only on alphabetical order, and that they would have to negotiate their next two group matches without one of their key men.\n\nA groin strain would keep Shaw out of action for the next fortnight. That left Catterall desperately hoping that his other left-back Danny Rose could recover quicker than anticipated from a twisted knee, otherwise he would be left with little choice but to start Clyne on the 'wrong' side against Romania. That particular match was just five days away.\n\nThe BBC's esteemed pundits had witnessed the draw with Turkey unfold from their cushy studio in Salford, where ex-striker Alan Shearer made his feelings perfectly clear.\n\n\"England were very, very poor yet again,\" Shearer sulked. \"We've got all the talent in the world, and two or three years ago, we would've taken a team like Turkey apart. Tonight, the lads put in a lot of effort but they didn't have that swagger about them.\n\n\"At this moment in time, I can't see where the next win's coming from for England. If we play like that against Romania, especially without the energy someone like Luke Shaw brings to the table, I really worry that it could all end in tears.\"\n\nFormer midfielder Danny Murphy was more optimistic, saying, \"From a defensive point of view, I saw a lot of reason for encouragement. In terms of their positional play, England have clearly learned from the mistakes they made against Italy and Denmark in the warm-up friendlies. Yes, maybe John Stones could've tried to close Topal down before he drove that shot home, but by and large, the English defenders come out of tonight with a lot of credit.\n\n\"For me, it's clear now that Mark has to start with the diamond, and - more importantly - stick with it. England were a lot more potent playing in that system than they were in the first period. With the 4-3-3, Harry Kane and the two widemen were often left very isolated, and the midfield were just spraying passes off target.\n\n\"There's less of a disconnect between the defence and the attack with that midfield diamond. Everybody pulls together to keep things tight and then get the ball moving forward. That's what Mark has been working towards.\"\n\nPresenter Gary Lineker then asked the BBC's special guest panellist - one of Britain's most famous figures of Turkish descent - what he thought about England's passing play in that second half.\n\n\"Oh, golly, that's a tizzler,\" fumbled former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, whose great-grandfather was Turkish.\n\n\"I thoroughly enjoyed the, er, wiff-waff in the Turkish field area for that score by, er, Harry Hotspur. It was bamboozlingly delightful how our boys passed the pig's bladder around. It was, er, a sporting spectacle that William Webb Ellis would have revelled in.\"\n\n\"Webb Ellis was the guy who invented rugby,\" Murphy pointed out to an embarrassed Johnson, who replied, \"Oh, crumbs. I profusely apologise for, er, such an appalling mistake. I have to say I now feel like I've picked up a Brexit suicide vest and then accidentally sat on the detonator. Egg very much on face indeed.\"\n\n2020 UEFA European Championship Group Stage Results\n\nGROUP A: Republic of Ireland 0-1 Portugal, Croatia 0-0 Serbia\n\nGROUP B: Spain 5-1 Armenia, Netherlands 3-0 Slovenia\n\nGROUP C: Switzerland 0-0 Romania, England 1-1 Turkey\n\nGROUP D: Montenegro 1-4 Denmark, Germany 1-0 Russia\n\nGROUP E: Belgium 1-0 Wales, Ukraine 1-2 Italy\n\nGROUP F: France 5-0 Georgia, Sweden 1-3 Austria\n\n***\n\n\"Okay, lads! We'll leave it at that!\"\n\nMark Catterall had brought a halt to training on the Wednesday morning after England's opening UEFA Euro 2020 match against Turkey. The players had been put through their paces for 90 minutes as they looked to make amends for the disappointing 1-1 draw.\n\n\"You're probably looking a bit knackered now, especially after last night,\" Catterall said after calling his players towards him.\n\n\"Knackered?\" Jack Wilshere panted. \"I'm f***ing exhausted, mate!\"\n\nCoach Glenn Hoddle remarked, \"Well, Jack, maybe you'd be feeling a bit better if you laid off the fags.\"\n\n\"Stop smoking? No way! If it's good enough for that old fat Brazilian geezer, it's good enough for me.\"\n\nRight-back Kyle Walker turned to left-back Nathaniel Clyne and whispered, \"I never knew Ronaldo was a smoker!\"\n\nHoddle told Wilshere, \"Well, if you carry on like that, you're gonna end up just like Sócrates - and not in a good way.\"\n\nCatterall insisted, \"Glenn's spot-on, Jack. I'm sure you've been told a thousand times that smoking's no good for your health, so just lay it off. You're in my team for Romania right now, but unless you start taking your fitness more seriously, you can forget about playing.\"\n\nWilshere sighed, \"Whatever. Guess I'll stop then.\"\n\n\"As for the rest of you, I'm seeing some positives... but also a few negatives. Rolando, you seemed a bit off the pace today? Anything up?\"\n\nRolando Aarons shrugged, \"Nothin', boss.\"\n\n\"Don't sound like nothing. Come on, tell me.\"\n\nAarons sighed, \"If you must know... my mum's in the nick. The rozzers caught her setting fire to a bin in Canning Town, didn't they?\"\n\n\"I see...\"\n\n\"They also wanna speak to me about an assault in Forest Gate. It weren't me, boss! I swear!\"\n\nCatterall groaned, \"I wish you'd told me about that sooner! Look, Rolando... you'll have to go back home and get all this sorted out, one way or another. We can't have any distractions in the squad... and we can't have you in the squad at all if you're suspected of criminal activity.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Aarons nodded sadly. He would be flown back to London later that afternoon to help the Metropolitan Police with their inquiries. The FA would say in a press statement that Aarons had been \"temporarily excused from England duties and allowed to return home for personal reasons\".\n\n\"Is that all, boss?\" Walker asked.\n\n\"No, you can all hit the showers.\"\n\nClyne then patted captain Jordan Henderson in the back and asked, \"You got any plans for the birthday boy?\"\n\nCatterall smiled as he remembered that it was Henderson's 30th birthday. He replied, \"Let's see when we get back to the hotel, shall we?\"\n\nWhile the players were busy showering off and getting changed, Catterall headed to his office. Upon learning that he had missed a phone call from David Whiteman, he sat down and phoned up the FA chief executive.\n\n\"Good morning, this is David Whiteman from the Football Association,\" came the answer from the septuagenarian, who was back home at Wembley Stadium.\n\n\"Hi, David,\" Catterall said. \"What do you want from me?\"\n\n\"I was solely contacting you to inform you of a significant development regarding recent events.\"\n\n\"How recent? It wasn't last night's game, was it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr Catterall, this is not in relation to the stalemate versus Turkey. We at the Football Association cannot disguise our mild disappointment at the outcome, although I can reassure you that your position as manager is not under threat.\"\n\n\"Just spit it out, David.\"\n\nWhiteman took a gulp and said, \"The police have formally charged Russell with two counts of fabricating libellous journalism... and one count of perverting the course of justice.\"\n\nTwo months had passed since Russell Whiteman - David's nephew - was arrested for breaching the so-called 'Fake News Act'. The Crown Prosecution Service had now claimed to have found enough evidence to charge The Sun's chief football writer.\n\nCatterall said, \"That's great! The bugger's gonna get what he deserves!\"\n\nDavid Whiteman warned, \"I would exercise caution before celebrating, Mr Catterall. I have reason to believe that Russell... might not necessarily be entirely culpable.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\nWhiteman said, \"Within the last seven days alone, no fewer than 30 journalists and columnists associated with right-wing media have been arrested on suspicion of breaching the Disinformation and Propaganda Act.\"\n\n\"The fewer of them dinosaurs around, the better, I say.\"\n\n\"No, Mr Catterall, you are not understanding the situation. Not all of the accused are linked with The Sun or the Daily Mail. There have been police raids on the offices of the Daily Telegraph and the ConservativeHome website, and even the political editor of the British Broadcasting Corporation has been apprehended by the authorities!\"\n\nCatterall gasped sarcastically, \"Oh no! Not Basil Brush!\"\n\n\"Yes, I am afraid that the aforementioned vulpine puppet is residing in a police cell as we speak, suspected of circulating propaganda against the Prime Minister. But here is the thing that most greatly concerns me regarding the state of this country, Mr Catterall. These arrests have all been made in the week following the appointment of a new Attorney General.\"\n\n\"Who's that, then?\"\n\n\"A young Labour parliamentarian by the name of Juno Love. She is the woman who first proposed the Disinform-\"\n\nCatterall interrupted, \"Yeah, yeah, I know she brought in that Fake News Bill. She's risen through the Labour ranks quickly, ain't she?\"\n\n35-year-old Love had only been a Member of Parliament for two years, having been elected to represent the constituency of Borehamwood in Hertfordshire at the 2018 general election. A staunch supporter of Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn, she had worked as a lawyer for close to a decade before entering politics. Her sudden promotion came about after the previous Attorney General was forced to resign, having been accused of claiming £950 in parliamentary expenses for Glastonbury music festival tickets.\n\nWhiteman then told Catterall, \"There is something else that I believe you should know. My eldest son Christopher is a semi-retired investigate journalist, and he has been exploring the background of Ms Love over recent days. Christopher has brought to my attention that Ms Love's father was the veteran journalist Michael Love.\"\n\n\"Who's Michael Love, and why are you telling me this?\"\n\n\"Michael Love is the incumbent deputy editor-in-chief of The Sun, having previously occupied that position at The Times between 2012 and 2017. He was the same man who wrote the article seven years ago in which my brother Anthony was accused of historic sexual offences.\"\n\n\"David, I... I don't understand this. Juno's a Labour MP, yet her dad was working for Tory newspapers?\"\n\n\"Christopher has reason to believe that Mr Love has infiltrated those two publications to subtly advance the cause of an old school chum. Mr Love was an Alma-mater of Brunel University London in the early 1970s, during which he befriended a certain John McDonnell.\"\n\n\"The Chancellor. Mr Corbyn's biggest ally.\"\n\n\"He is one and the same,\" Whiteman nodded. \"And of the 30 journalists who have recently been detained, at least half have worked under Mr Love within the past decade. Several of them have protested their innocence and claimed that their work was misrepresented... or words to that effect.\"\n\n\"So you think Michael Love might be behind all this?\"\n\n\"I am generally not an apprehensive fellow, Mr Catterall, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to disbelieve that a conspiracy against certain sections of the media industry. This does seem to be somewhat Orwellian, do you not think?\"\n\nCatterall was confused. \"Or-what?\"\n\n\"Orwellian. Have you not read the novel 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' by George Orwell?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't, actually. The only Orwell book I've read was 'Animal Farm', and that was a long time ago - in my final year at school, in fact. Jenny might have read it, though she's more into crime novels herself.\"\n\n\"I understand, Mr Catterall. I am aware that these recent events will greatly alarm you, considering that you have been outspoken in your support for the Labour Party for the best part of your adult life.\"\n\nCatterall said, \"Yeah, I am. Well... thanks for letting me know about this, David. I kinda wish you hadn't laid it all on my plate right now, though, to be honest.\"\n\n\"My apologies, Mr Catterall. I wish Christopher and I could explain his findings in greater detail, but we appreciate that you have other priorities at this present moment.\"\n\nCatterall half-laughed, \"Yeah, that's putting it lightly.\"\n\n\"May I wish you the very best of fortune for Monday night.\"\n\n\"Cheers, David.\"\n\n***\n\nThe first week of UEFA Euro 2020 was coming to an end. Early on Friday evening, England manager Mark Catterall went to the restaurant at the Hotel D'Angleterre with his assistant Michael Burke and central defenders Michael Keane and John Stones.\n\nAs Catterall sat at his table opposite Keane, he noted the restaurant's choice of music, asking Burke, \"Is it me, or are the Danes obsessed with Europop?\"\n\n\"It's Friday night, so of course dance music will be all the rage here,\" replied Burke, who was sitting next to his manager at the same table as Stones. \"Mind you, it's a bit early to play Whigfield, ain't it?\"\n\n\"There's never a right time to play this crap, not even on Saturday night. If they put on bloody 'Barbie Girl' as well, then I'm walking out and never coming back!\"\n\nKeane quipped, \"Good on ya if they do. We put up with enough rubbish music as it is, what with Burkey over here!\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's a fair point, Keano,\" Stones concurred, before turning to Burke and saying, \"C'mon, Mick. Spill't beans. You ain't knocked ol' Sheeran off t' Number 1 spot, ain't ya?\"\n\nThe UK Singles Chart was updated every Friday evening, listing the country's best-selling songs based upon physical sales, downloads and streaming. Burke's charity remake of 'Three Lions' with Blossoms and David Baddiel had been made available for digital download the previous week, and the wait to find out whether the single was a success would soon be over.\n\nCatterall accessed the Official Charts Company website on his phone, and he let out a hearty chuck. Burke asked him, \"So, where am I? Number 1?\"\n\nCatterall shook his head, and then twice more when Burke asked if he was in the top 10 or even the top 20.\n\n\"You're number 57!\" Catterall eventually answered, prompting Keane and Stones to burst out laughing.\n\nBurke asked, \"What's wrong with that?\"\n\n\"You charted below 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' by Reg & Pauline!\" Catterall responded as he passed his phone to Stones. He was referring to Reg Deane and Pauline Roy - two karaoke-singing stars of the new ITV2 reality show 'Finsbury Fogeys', which centred around the lives of several 60-something retirees in central London.\n\nAfter reading the screen on Catterall's phone, Stones laughed, \"Reg & Pauline! Man, that's summat special to come below them two in t' charts!\"\n\nBurke groaned, \"It's that one line, ain't it? The one where I sang about Phil Jones gurning? Phil ain't in the team; in fact, he weren't even in the preliminary squad!\"\n\nCatterall asked, \"Why didn't you think of that when you recorded it, then, you daft 'apeth?\"\n\n\"I recorded it before you announced the squad! If I'd known you'd leave Jonesy behind, I'd have changed it to summat else! I dunno... something about Raheem Sterling!\"\n\n\"Well, it's not the first time that's happened, is it?\" Catterall replied, somewhat sympathetically. He was referring to the 1998 version of 'Three Lions', which included the lyrics, \"Gazza good as before.\" Paul Gascoigne was subsequently left out of that year's FIFA World Cup squad by then-England boss Glenn Hoddle.\n\nKeane then caught a glimpse of a woman to his left-hand side, prompting him to tell Catterall, \"Hey, boss! I think someone here wants to see you!\"\n\nCatterall glanced to his right and then called, \"JENNY?\"\n\n\"Hey, Mark!\" Jenny smiled as she walked over to the table, with Mark quickly getting off his seat to greet her. The couple then shared a hug as Mark mumbled, \"I didn't think you were coming.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I managed to get a week off,\" Jenny said.\n\nBurke then intervened, \"Don't you worry about Luke; Julia's taking care of him.\"\n\nAs he released Jenny from his arms, Mark asked Burke, \"So you knew about this?\"\n\n\"Jenny and Julia gave me the heads-up last night. I thought I'd keep it a nice surprise for you.\"\n\nMark then held Jenny's left hand, and his voice started to crack as he said, \"You don't know how much I've missed you these last few days.\"\n\nKeane then joked, \"Oh, boy, here come the waterworks!\"\n\n\"Yeah, we missed you so much as well,\" Jenny told Mark. \"But after Tuesday's result, I thought I'd find a way to come over and be with you. I thought that'd make you happy, and that in turn would make the team happy.\"\n\n\"Well, you've deffo made us right happy, Mrs C,\" Stones quipped. \"No more Mr Misery Guts, eh?\"\n\nJenny then explained to Mark, \"Anyway, I booked a hotel on the other side of the city...\"\n\n\"Cancel the booking,\" Mark insisted. \"You're my wife, so you're rooming with me.\"\n\n\"That's nice, Mark, but I don't want to distract you too much.\"\n\n\"You won't be distracting me! Besides, we should be together as much as we can while we're here. We don't get much time as a couple without having a kid to look after.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" Burke agreed, before saying tongue-in-cheek, \"You have 23 to look after here.\"\n\nJenny asked the players, \"You won't mind me being around the hotel, will you?\"\n\nKeane shook his head. \"Nah, I won't mind. But only if my missus can come over as well!\"\n\nStones feigned exasperation as he replied, \"I thought you were alright roomin' with me, Keano! I thought it reminds you of home when I keep asking you to pick t' dirty clothes off t' floor!\"\n\nMark conceded, \"Alright then. You can bring your wives and girlfriends over... no, sorry, I mean wives or girlfriends. I don't want anyone giving Raheem any ideas!\"\n\nKeane smiled, \"Sure thing, gaffer.\"\n\nBurke then asked Mark, \"Ah, yes. I've just remembered summat else, Mark. How's yer mum?\"\n\nMark replied, \"She's back home now. Gemma called me on Wednesday night to say she was out of hospital and on the mend.\"\n\n\"She still having chemo?\"\n\n\"Yeah, as far as I know.\"\n\n\"Well, it's good to hear Barbara's recovering... well, as much as she can be.\"\n\nStones added, \"Yeah, I hope she gets well, boss. You don't really wanna fret 'bout yer folks being ill when you're out t' country, do ya?\"\n\n\"No, you bloomin' don't,\" Mark replied. He then asked Jenny, \"Quick question, love. What d'you remember about 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'?\"\n\nJenny answered, \"1984? That was the year after I was born, so... not much.\"\n\n\"I meant the book by Orwell. Have you read it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I have. That was a while ago, mind. Why are you asking?\"\n\nMark shrugged, \"No reason. Just something I was wondering the other day.\"\n\n***\n\nHeading into just their second group game of UEFA Euro 2020, England were already finding themselves under intense pressure. They had needed a 73rd-minute goal from Harry Kane just to take a point in their opener against Turkey and avoid what would've been a soul-crushing fourth defeat in five matches.\n\nEngland's next game took place five days later, again at Copenhagen's Telia Parken. Romania entered this competition as the team that many pundits saw as Group C's outsiders, yet a goalless draw against Switzerland had suggested they were more robust than the critics reckoned.\n\nThere was no reason why the Tricolorii could not frustrate the Three Lions as well, even though their last meeting in Bucharest two years earlier had ended in a comprehensive 4-0 win for the English. Christoph Daum was a wily tactician, and the 66-year-old German wasn't afraid to play a pragmatic game to frustrate his opponents.\n\nThe centre of Daum's backline featured two Serie A defenders at the opposite ends of their careers. The cool-headed 30-year-old Napoli star Vlad Chiriches was partnered with the brash but highly-rated AC Milan teenager Mihai Şomfălean, who'd just completed a season-long loan at Alavés in La Liga.\n\nChiriches' Napoli team-mate Florin Andone - a scorer of 25 international goals in a mere 37 caps - led the attack, with Borussia Dortmund's Ianis Hagi sitting in the hole behind him. There were four British-based players in the Tricolorii squad, including Celtic goalkeeper Silviu Lung jr, who was the son of Romania's legendary gloveman from the 1980s - erm, Silviu Lung sr.\n\nAs far as England's starting line-up was concerned, Mark Catterall retained only four of the players who'd kicked off the draw with Turkey. Joe Hart, Michael Keane, Nathaniel Clyne and Kane all started back-to-back matches, with Hart taking the captain's armband in place of the benched Jordan Henderson.\n\nKane had won his 50th England cap against Turkey, and it was now the turn of Tottenham Hotspur colleague Eric Dier to reach his half-century. The 26-year-old would play in the anchoring role of a four-man diamond, ahead of which were Kane and his new strike partner Marcus Rashford.\n\n34-year-old central defender Gary Cahill appeared for the 70th time in an international career that was nearing its conclusion. Either side of him and Keane were the full-backs - Calum Chambers on the right, and the right-footed Clyne on the left. Liverpool's wing-back was having to fill in for the stricken Luke Shaw, as although Danny Rose had resumed full training following a knee injury, Catterall would not risk starting him just yet.\n\nTurkey had recorded a surprise 2-1 win over Switzerland in Munich earlier that day, with goals from Gökhan Töre and Enes Ünal securing the points. Whoever won between Romania and England - if there was to be an outright winner - would join the Crescent-Stars at the top of Group C and put themselves firmly on course for the Last 16.\n\nIt was Romania who attacked first. After four minutes, Udinese's inside-forward Florin Tănase - who'd been in fantastic form for the Serie A side this season - rolled a short pass to attacking midfielder Hagi about 25 yards from goal. 21-year-old Hagi had scored just once in his first 20 senior caps, but an ambitious long-range shot wasn't particularly far from the target.\n\nWith Shaw on the sidelines, and neither Rose and Raheem Sterling fully fit to play following their injuries, England didn't really want to lose another player. Catterall's worst fears appeared to come true when box-to-box midfielder James Ward-Prowse slipped on his ankle in the sixth minute. The Tottenham man was feared to have twisted his ankle, but after being assessed by the England physios, he was given the go-ahead to continue.\n\nRomania would develop an injury concern of their own in the 13th minute. The strong Marseille midfielder Dragoş Nedelcu was taken out by a rough challenge from Dier, sustaining a dead leg in the process. Nedelcu would play through the first half in some pain, but he wouldn't see out the full match.\n\nHaving conceded a free-kick deep in the English half, Dier then redeemed himself by blocking the powerfully-struck set-piece - from Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Alexandru Maxim. One of Maxim's fellow British-based Romanians would come good at the other end four minutes later, as Lung caught a long-distance half-volley from Ward-Prowse.\n\nEngland were trying to \"flood the midfield\", as Catterall would often say, and put Romania under extended pressure. Against a team defending as narrowly and deeply as the Tricolorii, though, they were largely limited to hit-and-hopers. Cahill put one such effort wide in the 28th minute, causing his manager to grow increasingly agitated.\n\nCatterall would become even more annoyed when playmaker Jack Wilshere was cautioned for a clumsy tackle on Romanian left-back Alin Toşca after half an hour. His other attack-minded midfielder Ross Barkley was looking slightly more comfortable, testing Lung with a powerful shot in the 38th minute. The enigmatic Evertonian would have another go four minutes later from a free-kick, which was superbly blocked by Hagi in Romania's defensive wall.\n\nThe half ended with a second English booking, for Ward-Prowse following his trip on Maxim. Ward-Prowse would be replaced during the break, with captain Henderson entering the fray as England's new anchor man, and Dier pushing slightly further forward.\n\nDier's new remit was to hassle the Tricolorii players and try to win the ball firmly and fairly. He did win the ball firmly in tackling Romania right-back Paul Papp after 58 minutes, but not fairly. Dier too would have to play through the rest of the match while walking a disciplinary tightrope.\n\nThe opening stages of the second half had been very cagey, with England looking marginally the most likely team to break the deadlock. After 63 minutes, Dier's searching ball to Chambers on the right was met by a first-time cross into the box from the full-back. His delivery found Rashford, who got above Chiriches to win the header but could not keep it on target.\n\nCatterall then made his final two substitutions almost immediately afterwards. He didn't want to risk Dier collecting another yellow card and being suspended from the upcoming match with Switzerland, so he brought Leicester City's box-to-box midfielder Danny Drinkwater on in his place. He then replaced the very disappointed Kane up front with Chelsea's Callum Wilson.\n\nCatterall had kept faith in his wrong-sided left-back Clyne, who was putting in a surprisingly strong shift at both ends. In the 68th minute, Clyne played an excellent long ball with his right foot to Wilson in the Romania box. Şomfălean superbly knocked the ball away from Wilson, but Rashford attempted a follow-up shot that deflected off Chiriches and went wide.\n\nShortly after their latest missed opportunity, England received yet another yellow card. Barkley was their fourth player to incur the wrath of Italian referee Daniele Orsato following a clash with Romanian midfielder Paul Anton.\n\nRomania then threatened to hit the Three Lions on the counter-attack in the 75th minute, when a heavy touch from the advancing Rashford saw Chiriches intercept the ball and pump it ahead of Andone. The intelligent 27-year-old striker broke through England's offside trap and bore down on goal. Much to the England fans' relief, the ageing Cahill still had just enough pace to put Andone under pressure, thus making his shot easier for Hart to push behind.\n\nA series of excellent interceptions from Clyne then helped to keep the Tricolorii at bay, with a spirited performance ultimately seeing him receive the 'man of the match' award from the tournament sponsors. However, the 29-year-old Londoner would have mixed feelings at the final whistle.\n\nThough England upped their attacking game in the final 10 minutes, the breakthrough just wouldn't come. Wilson struck Drinkwater's excellent lofted ball on the half-volley in the 82nd minute, only to see Lung palm it clear. Drinkwater fired wide a chance of his own in the 84th minute, before Lung kept out a strong 25-yarder from Barkley in the 87th.\n\nEngland's final opportunity was a last-minute Wilshere free-kick, awarded after Barkley had been tripped by Romania's Brazilian-born substitute winger William. That set-piece clattered off Andone in the wall, and another Romanian substitute - the young Arsenal midfielder Vlad Dragomir - eventually removed the danger.\n\nThe final whistle blew not long afterward. Romania 0, England 0. The Three Lions had failed to win in six successive matches for the first time since 1993, during their disastrous 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign under Graham Taylor. Did the current manager not like that?\n\nRomania had ground out their second goalless draw of the tournament, while England would also head into the final round of group matches on two points. The pair were two adrift of Group C leaders Turkey, and one ahead of table-proppers Switzerland.\n\n21 June 2020: UEFA European Championship Group C - at Telia Parken, Copenhagen\n\nRomania - 0\n\nEngland - 0\n\nENGLAND LINE-UP (4-3-1-2): Joe Hart; Calum Chambers, Gary Cahill, Michael Keane, Nathaniel Clyne; Eric Dier (Danny Drinkwater), Jack Wilshere, James Ward-Prowse (Jordan Henderson); Ross Barkley; Harry Kane (Callum Wilson), Marcus Rashford. BOOKED: Wilshere 30, Ward-Prowse 44, Dier 59, Barkley 68.\n\nIn the BBC Sport studio in Salford, Gary Lineker asked his pundits, \"So... two draws from two? It could have been a lot better for England, couldn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, it couldn't have been much worse, Gary,\" Alan Shearer moaned. \"England's display tonight was nothing short of diabolical. They had to go out there and take the game to Romania, ask questions of their defence. I didn't see enough of that until about 10 minutes from the end. Pointless.\"\n\nMartin Keown - who played alongside Shearer at UEFA Euro 2000 - said, \"You know what that reminded me of, Alan? Romania and England were like two washed-up boxers tiredly sparring at each other, and neither of them wanting to take any risks. I felt like I was watching one of Audley Harrison's fights from back in the day!\"\n\nShearer added, \"Mark Catterall likes to talk about 'flooding the midfield'. He could've flooded the studio, because England were on the brink of boring me to tears! Playing fancy football in the middle of the park with no service for the strikers is enormously frustrating from a supporter's point of view, and from a team's point of view, it just isn't going to win you matches.\"\n\nLineker asked, \"So what do you want to see England do differently against Switzerland?\"\n\nKeown replied, \"Me and Alan have been saying that England should be more direct, like many of the great England teams of the past. If your players don't have the skill set to play like Barcelona, you really shouldn't bother. Instead, you should play to your strengths, increase the tempo, get the ball up the park a bit quicker. You can't faff around on the ball in this day and age.\"\n\nLineker then said, \"So it's two points each after two games for England and Romania. The situation in Group C could become so complex on Wednesday that we might have to call on the mathematical brain of Professor Roger Penrose to work it all out. In the meantime, let's ask the Cheeky Girls for their thoughts.\"\n\nGabriela Irimia - one half of the Romanian-born pop duo - said, \"It is not ideal that we haven't won a match yet, obviously, but we have a very resilient defence, so I am not worried too much. Our young centre-half Mihai Şomfălean played incredibly well tonight, winning 17 headers and making 29 interceptions. As far as Romanian defensive performances are concerned, that was up there with Miodrag Belodedici's spirited display against the United States in our final group game at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.\"\n\nHer twin sister Monica added, \"I am still confident that Romania can qualify for the Last 16. We would have to defeat a talented and well-knit team from Turkey to make sure of qualification, but even a third 0-0 stalemate might be enough. That would depend on at least two of the other 3rd-placed teams either finishing on two points, or on three points with a negative goal difference. I cannot see either Serbia or the Republic of Ireland registering a better record than us in Group A, so we would only need one more group to work out in our favour.\"\n\nA dumbfounded Lineker turned to the camera and remarked, \"Well... we might not need Sir Roger after all!\"\n\nEngland's fate was not much more certain than it had been at the start of the day. A win against Switzerland three days later would secure qualification for the Last 16, whereas a defeat would almost certainly mean elimination.\n\nIf the match was to end in yet another draw, the Romania vs Turkey result would carry even greater significance. A Turkish win would send England through, while a Romanian victory would put them into the next phase. Another deadlock would see the 'goals scored' columns decide which of England or Romania would qualify in 2nd, and which team would come 3rd, which would possibly be enough to progress depending on how the other groups panned out.\n\nIn other words, the Three Lions' situation was as clear as crystal. Maybe.\n\n2020 UEFA European Championship Group Stage Results\n\nGROUP A: Portugal 2-1 Croatia, Serbia 0-0 Republic of Ireland\n\nGROUP B: Armenia 1-1 Netherlands, Slovenia 1-2 Spain\n\nGROUP C: Turkey 2-1 Switzerland, Romania 0-0 England\n\nGROUP D: Russia 0-0 Montenegro, Denmark 0-3 Germany\n\nGROUP E: Italy 1-2 Belgium, Wales 2-4 Ukraine\n\nGROUP F: Austria 0-3 France, Georgia 1-2 Sweden\n\n***\n\nMonday morning, 22 June 2020. Mark and Jenny Catterall were asleep in their hotel room. At 7:30am on the dot, they were awoken by the ring of their telephone.\n\nMark and Jenny both arose and stretched their arms before Mark answered the phone with a weary, \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Good morning, Mr Catterall,\" came the cheery reply from a woman with a strong and bubbly Scandinavian accent. \"This is your wake-up call.\"\n\n\"Oh, right. Ta, love.\"\n\n\"Would you like breakfast in bed?\"\n\nJenny nodded as Mark replied, \"Yes, we would. I'll have the usual, and Jen, you'll have...\"\n\n\"I'll have, er...\" Jenny hesitated, \"a full English.\"\n\n\"A full English, please - bacon, sausages and eggs.\"\n\n\"Ja, we will arrange that for you. And when do you want it served?\"\n\n\"8 o'clock, please.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. Have a nice morning.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, after the Catteralls had washed and changed, there was a knock on the door. Jenny answered it and was greeted by a 20-something blonde-haired woman - the same one who'd given the wake-up call.\n\n\"Good morning again, Mr and Mrs Catterall,\" the woman said. \"I have your breakfast, and the English newspapers for Mr Catterall.\"\n\nMark said, \"You don't need to be so polite, love. Just call me Mark.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and my name's Jenny.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay,\" the attendant laughed. \"In that case, you can call me Sara.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's Sara as in, like, Sara Lund, right?\" Jenny asked, referring to the main character in the Danish crime drama 'The Killing'.\n\n\"Ja, like Sara Lund! Many of you English people say that to me, even though I am young and blonde, and Sara Lund is older with dark hair.\"\n\nJenny then welcomed Sara inside, and the attendant placed the breakfast tray on the bed. She then asked, \"Would you like anything else?\"\n\n\"No, we're alright, Sara,\" Mark said. \"I've gotta be at work in an hour, so...\"\n\n\"Oh ja, of course. Last night was not a good result, no?\"\n\nMark sighed, \"You could say that. I would use some stronger words to describe it.\"\n\nSara laughed before saying, \"Okay, ja, I will not keep you any longer. Have a nice day, Mr and Mrs Catterall.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Sara,\" Jenny said as Sara made her way out. \"We'll see you soon!\"\n\nMark then tucked into his breakfast - dark toast, as per usual - while he perused the British newspapers, which had been flown in from London overnight. They would not make particularly happy reading.\n\nThe Guardian's front page carried the headline, \"Another Danish disaster for ineffective England.\" On the back page of The Times was the heading, \"Catterall on the brink after bore draw.\" The Daily Express let out a desperate plea on their front page, asking, \"Can SOARING house prices help us NOW?\"\n\n\"EUROTRASH,\" was what The Daily Mirror went with, under the sub-heading, \"Winless England face another early European exit.\"\n\nThe Sun was - surprise, surprise - most critical of Catterall. The top of their back page read, \"With England on their worst run since 1993, it's time to...\" In the middle of the page, the manager's head was depicted on the body of the portly cartoon cat Garfield, with the large headline at the bottom ominously reading, \"PUT THE CATT DOWN.\"\n\nMark tossed his copy of The Sun across the room in anger, and fumed, \"We've not even finished the Group Stage yet, but those b******s are already calling for my head!\"\n\n\"Alright, love, take it easy,\" Jenny sighed as she reassuringly put her left arm around her husband's shoulders. \"They're just idiots who write whatever their readers want them to. This'll all blow over when you beat Switzerland.\"\n\nMark shouted, \"IF we beat Switzerland, Jen... IF!\"\n\n\"I was only trying to help,\" Jenny said as she recoiled. She then sighed before asking Mark, \"This isn't like you at all, Mark Catterall. You used to be the confident, glass-half-full type. Now you're doubting whether your team will win on Wednesday?\"\n\nMark groaned, \"I'm really not sure where we're at right now. It's just... it was going so well, for three-and-a-half years. Then the Euros come on the horizon, and now it's like we've forgotten how to beat half-decent teams!\n\n\"These journos... some of them can be blood-sucking c***s, sure, but they're not idiots. Ava Leggett's told me this a hundred times: they're as passionate about England football as I am, and they know what they want to see from the team. If we aren't performing, they will let me know about it.\"\n\nJenny suggested, \"I'm no expert, but can you just tell the players to... you know, work harder?\"\n\n\"If only it were that simple, Jen! We put everything into Turkey, we put everything into Romania... and what did we get? One goal, two points! It's not about the quantity of the work you put in; it's about the quality, and we're not showing that right now.\"\n\nJenny stared wistfully at the ceiling, and then looked back at Mark to tell him, \"Like I said, I'm not an expert when it comes to football. I think you need to talk to your coaches about this.\"\n\n\"Of course. We've got to get to the bottom of why we haven't been performing... before it's too late.\"\n\n\"Great. So I suggest you get that breakfast down you and hit the training ground. You don't want Wednesday to be your last match, do you?\"\n\n***\n\nHaving made a sluggish start to UEFA Euro 2020, England manager Mark Catterall knew that he couldn't take any chances in the Three Lions' final group game against Switzerland. It was now more important than ever that he got his tactics spot-on, and that his team wholeheartedly bought into his gameplan.\n\nFollowing Monday morning's training session, Catterall and his coaches turned their focus to tactics. During the tactical discussion in the main meeting room, coach Glenn Hoddle took the lead.\n\nHoddle began, \"Right, lads. You should know by now that it ain't gonna be easy on Wednesday. Switzerland might have lost to Turkey yesterday, but they're a gifted bunch of players who will attack us at any given opportunity. It's vital you keep your shape at the back.\"\n\nCatterall stated, \"Gary [Cahill], Keano [Michael Keane], you two did a good job of shutting out Romania last time. Stonesy [John Stones] will probably come back in for one of you, but let's see how you are on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"I'll be ready, gaffer,\" Cahill stated. \"I may be getting on a bit, but I feel better and fitter than ever.\"\n\nHoddle asked, \"You sure you can handle [Breel] Embolo on Wednesday, though? He's a pacey lad with bundles of energy, and he'll never stop working on the football pitch. You might have your work cut out with him.\"\n\nAssistant manager Michael Burke said, \"I wouldn't worry too much, Glenn. Embolo played 28 games for Manchester City last season and only scored twice.\"\n\nCatterall argued, \"It was Embolo's first season after his big move from Germany, though, weren't it? A lot of those appearances were from the bench as well, so if anything, he'll be fresher and even more determined to prove a point.\"\n\n\"Who's that other striker Switzerland have?\" Cahill asked. \"It's Haris something, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Seferovic,\" Hoddle said. \"Now he's come off a promising first season with Brighton, getting a dozen goals and half a dozen assists. Seferovic is big, strong, not very mobile, but he's as likely to help his team-mates score as he is to score himself.\"\n\n\"So he's a bit like Emile Heskey then?\"\n\n\"Yeah, pretty much... except Seferovic has actually gotten better with age. Anyway, whether it's him or Embolo who gets the nod, you'll need to be fully prepared.\"\n\n\"Now, in terms of the full-backs, I think changes might be in order as well, depending on whether Luke or Rosie are fit,\" Catterall said. He subsequently asked his left-backs, \"How are you two lads feeling right now?\"\n\n\"I'm ready to go again, gaffer,\" Danny Rose replied enthusiastically. \"My knee's all good now.\"\n\nLuke Shaw was also insistent that he was ready to play, having returned to light training after suffering a groin strain against Turkey. \"Yeah, me groin's still a bit sore, but I reckon I'll be ready.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not so sure, Luke,\" Catterall said. \"You've still got another week until you're 100%. I can't really take the risk before then. But if you can get back up to speed over the next couple of days, Danny, we'll probably bring you back him and move Nat [Clyne] over to the right.\"\n\n\"Cheers,\" Rose smiled.\n\nCatterall continued, \"Switzerland play in a 4-2-3-1 formation, so we're likely to be outnumbered in midfield. Even so, I trust Jordan [Henderson] to give more protection to our centre-halves, in case their attacking midfielders [Valentin] Stocker and [Xherdan] Shaqiri start to threaten. I expect nothing less from my skipper.\"\n\nHoddle then said, \"The Swiss full-backs love to bomb forward, so they're going to leave plenty of space to exploit at the back. Also, our resident weather girl here reckons the conditions will suit... er, let's call it 'industrial' football.\"\n\nDavid Platt explained, \"We expect heavy rain at just after 5:35pm on Wednesday evening, so towards the end of the first half. The temperature will also hit a peak of 25 degrees Centigrade, though it will feel a degree or two colder, so try not to tire yourselves out, fellas.\"\n\n\"Thanks for that, Carol Kirkwood,\" Hoddle half-laughed. \"So yeah, we're going to play a 4-2-3-1, and we're gonna play with a bit more urgency than we did in the last few games. We want Jordan's passing to be a bit more direct and wider, so we can make the most of those spaces out wide I was talking about.\"\n\nCatterall said, \"We're looking at playing Marcus [Rashford] on the left wing and Rolando [Aarons] on the right. I know you both prefer to be on the other side, but I reckon you've got enough ability with both feet to either stay wide or some inside if you have to.\"\n\n\"Sure, I'm happy with that,\" Rashford nodded. There was also a nod of agreement from Aarons, who was back in training after briefly returning home to be questioned by police about an alleged assault in east London before the Euros. The West Ham United forward provided substantial evidence that he wasn't the perpetrator, and he was subsequently released without charge.\n\n\"We've still got a few question marks about who else will play with midfield and who'll be up front,\" Catterall admitted, before turning to Harry Kane. \"But I don't think we'll pick you this time, Harry.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I ain't gonna lie that I'm not sick as a parrot, y'know, but it's for the best,\" Kane conceded. \"Last time I went out there, I didn't get no goals, so maybe it's time to give Studge [Daniel Sturridge] or Callum [Wilson] another bite at the whip, y'know. It's a team game at the end of the day.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your honesty, Harry,\" Catterall nodded. He then told Sturridge and Wilson, \"So there's a challenge for you two lads. Show me that you're ready to start on Wednesday; prove to me that you can still do it on the big stage.\"\n\nHoddle said, \"Whichever of you gets the nod will want to take advantage of the lack of pace in the centre of that Swiss defence, particularly Schär.\"\n\n\"That's the Hoffenheim defender Fabian Schär, not the Armenian-American singer Cher, though their names sound similar,\" Platt happily clarified, even though he arguably didn't need to. \"Schär probably believes in life after love, just like his famous namesake, but I don't believe he is very quick off the ground. Think Roger Federer, when he gets arthritis in a decade or two's time.\"\n\nHoddle muttered to Burke, \"Is there an off switch on that bloody thing?\"\n\nBurke whispered, tongue-in-cheek, \"I think the instruction manual says there's a reset button somewhere around the groin area. I'd rather not know exactly where it is, but maybe a good kicking will help you find out.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mick. Maybe I'll try that next time.\"\n\n***\n\nAfter beginning their UEFA European Championship campaign with back-to-back draws, England had now reached the point where they could ill afford to slip up again. Their final Group C match against Switzerland at the Telia Parken had the potential to either make or break their tournament.\n\nEngland went into this match sitting 2nd in Group C. A win would qualify the Three Lions for the Last 16, no questions asked. A draw was also likely to just about see them through, at least as one of the best 3rd-placed teams. Were they to lose, though, they would exit the tournament in disgrace, and Mark Catterall's 50th match as England manager would almost certainly be his last.\n\nWhile England faced the Swiss in Copenhagen, group leaders Turkey would play Romania in the other group decider in Munich. Victory for Turkey would guarantee them top spot - and a theoretically easier Last 16 match against a 3rd-placed side - but anything else would open the door for either the English or the Romanians to overtake them.\n\nFor this potentially career-defining match, Catterall fielded England in his typical 4-2-3-1 formation. Goalkeeper Joe Hart and right-back Nathaniel Clyne continued their runs of starting every group match, with Clyne reverting to his usual role after a courageous performance as a makeshift left-back against Romania.\n\nThe left-back role was taken up by Danny Rose, who was fit again and ready to make his first appearance at the tournament after recovering from a twisted knee. There would also be a first start up front at Euro 2020 for Valencia's Daniel Sturridge, with his former Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson retaking the captaincy in midfield.\n\nCatterall's England had won each of their previous two meetings with Vladimir Petkovic's Switzerland, including an excellent comeback victory in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Quarter Final. That had represented Switzerland's best run at a major tournament since the 1950s, but the Nati now needed a revenge win just to qualify for the knockout phase.\n\nPetkovic had a full complement of players to choose from, and some of his key men would be very familiar to the Three Lions. 23-year-old striker Breel Embolo had just completed his first season at Manchester City, though he only found the net twice in 28 appearances following a £47million move from Schalke 04.\n\nTwo Swiss starters who were thoroughly enjoying their time in the Premier League were Chelsea's attacking wing-back Ricardo Rodríguez and Stoke City's enigmatic attacking midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri. There was also the tough-tackling Granit Xhaka, who had been in and out of the Arsenal side for four years but was a core part of his national team. Indeed, the 27-year-old had captained the Nati since Stephan Lichtsteiner's retirement the previous summer.\n\nXhaka was exhausted following two tireless performances earlier in the group phase. Therefore, it was Ajaccio's playmaker Olivier Custodio who wore the Swiss captain's armband and exchanged pleasantries with Henderson and German referee Deniz Aytekin before kick-off.\n\nEngland launched their first attack after four minutes, with Marcus Rashford - playing on the left wing - winning a corner off Swiss right-back Michael Lang. Sadly for the Three Lions, Henderson's corner delivery to the far post was comfortably headed away by Custodio.\n\nEngland then had to defend a corner themselves two minutes later, after Valentin Stocker's shot had clattered off Gary Cahill and deflected behind. Again, the delivery from Custodio was poor, and Hart comfortably claimed it.\n\nThe first proper shot at either end came after 10 minutes, and it went England's way. Rose didn't take too long to get back up and running, as he floated in an excellent cross, only to see Rashford flick it dismally wide. Another wayward England header came four minutes later from Manchester City defender John Stones, who failed to capitalise on a Henderson corner.\n\nSwitzerland then went close to opening the scoring themselves after 15 minutes. Rodríguez might not have yet made a full recovery from a foot injury he'd sustained in the Nati's group opener against Romania, but he looked back to his best when playing a one-two with Vincent Sierro. Unfortunately for the Swiss supporters, that move would end with Freiburg midfielder Sierro pulling a glaring opportunity wide.\n\nSierro's miss would eventually prove costly for Switzerland. After 28 minutes, Rose surged past Lang and played a weighted ball to Rashford, who broke away from Swiss centre-half Fabian Schär to claim it. The Wolfsburg forward then crossed first-time to Sturridge, setting up a fantastic finish at the back post for England's frontman.\n\nCatterall's charges were now leading a match for the first time at this European Championship. Within a couple of minutes, they would be even further ahead. Dele Alli's excellent tackle on Switzerland midfielder Denis Zakaria started a counter-attack that he would finish moments later. The Tottenham Hotspur workhorse found space to run onto a Sturridge through-ball and slip it beyond goalkeeper Roman Bürki for his first England goal since 2017.\n\nEngland's goal/assist triangle would be completed in the 34th minute. Zakaria's careless trip on Alli gave the Three Lions a free-kick some distance from goal, but Henderson still managed to lift an excellent long delivery into the 'D'. Alli then cushioned it to Rashford, who found the far corner with his first goal at a senior international tournament!\n\nIn just six minutes, England had scored three goals to put themselves well on course for the Last 16. They even topped Group C for a while... until Turkey opened the scoring against Romania after 38 minutes.\n\nThe Three Lions eased up a bit after their triple-whammy, giving Switzerland some time to try and push for a potentially revolutionary goal before the interval. The Nati racked up a few corners, and Embolo had an angled effort pushed behind by Hart in the 44th minute, but that was as good as it would get for them.\n\nSwitzerland suffered a significant blow on the stroke of half-time, when Stocker twisted his ankle. Stocker was one of three Swiss players, alongside full-backs Lang and Rodríguez, who would be substituted before the second half.\n\nCatterall was now looking ahead to the next round, as his half-time changes showed. Clyne and Henderson were taken off, with Calum Chambers and Eric Dier taking their places at right-back and central midfield respectively.\n\nRolando Aarons was the only member of England's attacking quartet who hadn't scored in that first-half rout. He arguably should have put that right in the 51st minute.\n\nRose's centre into the area clipped the heel of Switzerland's teenage substitute defender Mario Ricca and deflected to England midfielder Danny Drinkwater. The Leicester City man played a cheeky backheel to Alli, who moved the ball across for Aarons on the edge of the six-yard box. Aarons should've made it 4-0 from there, but the West Ham United forward struck the ball far too viciously and sent it soaring high into the stand.\n\nAarons had another attempt six minutes later, driving in an excellent Drinkwater pass from the edge of the area. Bürki pushed it wide, thus redeeming himself somewhat after a dreadful opening half for Borussia Dortmund's number 1.\n\nOn 65 minutes, Rose floated a delightful cross that fell perfectly for Alli, who disappointingly couldn't keep his header from looping over the bar. Alli would soon be rested for the closing stages, with Harry Kane being given 20 minutes to try and follow up his earlier goal against Turkey. He could not.\n\nSwitzerland were now whimpering out of the tournament, with Petkovic's frustration growing after midfielders Shaqiri and Custodio were booked midway through the half. Mind you, there was a brief spell in the closing stages when it looked like the Nati would snatch a consolation goal.\n\nHart's second half had been a quiet one until he was forced to push a dangerous Shaqiri centre behind nine minutes from the end. England's vice-captain, who'd taken the armband after Henderson's substitution, would be called into action again a minute later. Hart caught a last-ditch drive from Werder Bremen forward Admir Mehmedi, who then missed another chance for Switzerland just before full-time.\n\nEngland would finish the match with back-to-back clean sheets, and - more importantly - secured a welcome return to the winners' enclosure. The Three Lions were roaring again.\n\n24 June 2020: UEFA European Championship Group C - at Telia Parken, Copenhagen\n\nSwitzerland - 0\n\nEngland - 3 (Daniel Sturridge 28, Dele Alli 30, Marcus Rashford 34)\n\nENGLAND LINE-UP (4-2-3-1): Joe Hart; Nathaniel Clyne (Calum Chambers), Gary Cahill, John Stones, Danny Rose; Danny Drinkwater, Jordan Henderson (Eric Dier); Rolando Aarons, Dele Alli (Harry Kane), Marcus Rashford; Daniel Sturridge.\n\nEngland had made heavy weather of Group C, but nevertheless, they had survived it. They qualified for the Last 16 alongside Turkey, who had secured top spot courtesy of Hakan Çalhanoglu's hat-trick in a 3-1 victory over Romania.\n\nAs the 2nd-placed team in Group C, England now knew that they would play the Group A runners-up in the Spanish city of Bilbao. To be specific, standing between the Three Lions and the Quarter Finals would be Croatia.\n\nCroatia's road to the Last 16 had also been a rocky one. The Vatreni kicked off Group A with an unconvincing goalless draw against Serbia, followed by a narrow 2-1 defeat to holders Portugal. They then squandered a two-goal lead in their final group match against the Republic of Ireland and appeared to be heading for an early exit until late goals from Ante Coric and Nikola Kalinic saved their skins.\n\nThis knockout match would be played at Athletic Bilbao's San Mamés stadium on 27 June. England would only have two days' rest, compared to three days for their opponents, but the Three Lions were still rated as slight favourites by the bookmakers. Whoever prevailed would secure a Quarter Final meeting with either Germany or Slovenia.\n\nIn the ITV studio, ex-England striker Ian Wright was in a confident mood, saying, \"I ain't worried about Croatia, to be honest. With all the attacking talent we've got and all the energy those boys have, I think we can deal with Croatia's defence, which looks too slow and chaotic for me.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I weren't feeling this way two hours ago. After those first two group games against Turke"
