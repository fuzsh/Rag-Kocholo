        "text": "John Bennett is joined by Ghanaian broadcaster George Addo after arriving in Abidjan to preview the quarter-final matches at the Africa Cup of Nations in a bonus edition.\n\nIn an unpredictable tournament, John and George do the unthinkable, and try and predict which way the matches will go.\n\nWe hear who will progress between Nigeria and Angola and who between Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea will reach the last four. Both games take place on Friday 2 February.\n\nWill hosts Ivory Coast be celebrating a final spot or will they be knocked out by Mali? That game is played on Saturday 3 February as well as the match between Cape Verde and South Africa.\n\nWe want to hear from you, send us your WhatsApp voice notes to +44 0800 032 0870. Tell us your name, where you are from, your question, and we will use a selection during the show.\n\nSam Kerr is at the pinnacle of her career. She’s won her fourth Women’s Super League title with Chelsea, another FA Cup and is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in world football, winning multiple Golden Boot awards across the globe.\n\nAnd now the Australian record goal scorer and captain, who was inspired by Cathy Freeman’s gold medal winning race at the Sydney Olympics, is the face of the 2023 World Cup – looking for her team’s own iconic moment -where a nation stops to watch.\n\nSo where did it all begin for Sam Kerr? Maz Farookhi and Jenny Wallace find out. 1993 was the year Australia’s most famous sporting icon Shane Warne bowled the Ball of the Century, but it’s also the year the future Matildas captain was born in Perth and in to a family passionate about Aussie rules football.\n\nYou’ll meet the Kerr camp: the coaches, players and family that have played their part in her rise to the top including back to back World Cup winner, USA’s Carli Lloyd, Australia teammates Caitlin Foord and Steph Catley, plus her parents Roger and Roxanne. (Producer: Joanne Smith)\n\n(Image: An image of Australia's Sam Kerr is projected onto the Sydney Opera House on September 05, 2021 in Sydney, Australia.

Guinea is a country that has never qualified for the World Cup and Mani speaks to their goalkeeper Aly Keita who is in favour of expanding the competition.\n\nThe team also discuss the ongoing disagreement between United States coach Greg Berhalter and former teammate Claudio Reyna. Berhalter was cleared by an legal investigation into an incident of domestic violence 30 years ago. The incident from 1992 was brought to light by former USA players Claudio and Danielle Reyna who are parents of one of the USA's current players, Geo. They've been friends with the Berhalters for decades but were unhappy about the lack of playing time. The report also revealed new facts about Claudio Reyna whom, it says, was uncooperative and a pushy parent.\n\nPlus have a panel accidentally started a riot? That's after a title-deciding match between Al-Ahed and Al-Ansar couldn't finish after a goal scored in injury-time by Ahed's Scottish striker Lee Erwin sparked a riot by Ansar fans who set seats on fire and threw them onto the pitch forcing the refereeing officials to run for cover.\n\nWe'll also hear a special guest!\n\nWith the Chinese Super League champions, Jiangsu FC, ceasing operations just 108 days after winning the title we look at whether more clubs could follow before the 2021 season starts in April. Ghana International and Tianjin Tigers captain Frank Acheampong tells us he doesn't know yet whether the club will continue without their backers Teda, who have reportedly withdrawn their funding because of the Chinese football association’s new policy that removes mention of companies from club names.\n\nMani Djazmi, Heather O'Reilly and Pat Nevin discuss whether the packed fixture schedule is catching up with players in the Premier League and what impact that might have on the Uefa European Championships in the summer.\n\nFifa Council candidate Laura McAllister tells us why she wants to be one of world football's decision makers, and shares her thoughts on the joint bid from the UK and Republic of Ireland to host the 2030 World Cup.\n\nAnd we reflect on the life of former Liverpool and Scotland winger Ian St John, who died this week at the age of 82.\n\nPhoto: Jiangsu Suning players and staff members celebrating after their team defeated Guangzhou Evergrande to win the Chinese Super League in November 2020.

But this wasn't any old World Cup-winning team. It's a team that's become encircled by an almost mystical aura, and carries the seemingly eternal tag of the greatest team in the history of football. We'll hear memories from Pele and the late Carlos Alberto, and find out how that team influenced a man who, many years later, would coach a Brazil team to another World title. To discuss why Brazil 1970 is so revered, Mani Djazmi, Pat Nevin and Alicia Ferguson are joined by two experts - Ricardo Setyon, who’s been to nine World Cups, often working with the Brazil teams; and Andrew Downie, who’s a veteran foreign correspondent including nearly 30 years in Latin America, much of them in Brazil, and is the author of a soon-to-be-published book about the 1970 World Cup called ‘The Greatest Show On Earth’. Pat also goes behind the scenes at the Etihad Stadium to tell us what it’s really like to commentate on a Premier League game behind closed doors during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPicture: Pele celebrates Brazil's victory in the 1970 World Cup final. (Getty Images)\n\nShe's the best player in the world, the winner of the Ballon d'Or and she has won the Champions League three times.\n\nBut Norwegian striker Ada Hegerberg won't be playing at this year's World Cup in France, apparently in protest at what she describes as a lack of respect for female players in Norway.\n\nWe discuss why Hegerberg has made this decision and we hear from former Colombia midfielder Melissa Ortiz, who also quit her national team - citing inferior treatment of women's football by the Colombian Football Federation. Melissa reveals how the players' daily allowance was taken away by the federation and that players like her who lived in the United States had to pay for their own travel.\n\nWhat's better than El Clasico? Two El Clasicos, of course! After Barcelona beat Real Madrid to reach the Copa del Rey Final on Wednesday, the two teams meet again in La Liga on Saturday. But has El Clasico lost some of its magic? We'll discuss whether this match is still as exciting without the thrilling battles between Ronaldo and Messi - plus the recent comments by Madrid's Marcelo that teammate Gareth Bale hasn't learned any Spanish since moving to the capital.\n\nAnd is the Roman Empire falling? Roman Abramovich's empire that is...\n\nChelsea ended a terrible February with victory over Tottenham in the Premier League, but what now for the Chelsea manager and Kepa? The goalkeeper was dropped after refusing to be substituted in their League Cup Final defeat at Wembley - behaviour that seemed to seriously undermine Sarri's authority. We'll also discuss whether Abramovich has fallen out of love with the club.\n\nPhoto: Ada Hegerberg (Getty Images)\n\nFormer Ajax, Barcelona and Netherlands striker Patrick Kluivert, who is now the assistant coach of the Cameroon national team, shares his thoughts on the upcoming men's Africa Cup of Nations tournament.\n\nCameroon was recently stripped of the right to host this year’s tournament as a result of delays and concerns about the potential of violence. The competition will now go ahead in Egypt - and Kluivert believes that will actually benefit the Cameroon team.\n\nAhead of the Asian Cup Final between Qatar and Japan, we hear more about the local fans throwing shoes at the Qatar players during their semi-final victory over the UAE and what the atmosphere was really like inside the stadium. Plus, we'll hear the thoughts of Qatar coach Felix Sanchez on an appeal from the UAE to the Asian Football Confederation, over the eligibility of two players from Qatar.\n\nAnd Ole Gunnar Solksjaer is still unbeaten since taking over as Manchester United coach. Another former United player to return to the club is Giuseppe Rossi. He was invited to train with the squad, as he looks to get back to match fitness after a string of horrible injuries. And he tells World Football he's surprised at the way his former team-mate, Solksjaer, has turned things around at United.\n\nPhoto: Patrick Kluivert (Getty Images)\n\nBernd Stange has one goal above all others when he leads Syria into the finals ; to put a smile back on the faces of the country's war-ravaged people. The veteran German manager was lured out of retirement this year to take charge of the Syrians as they seek to build on their remarkable run to the verge of qualifying for their first World Cup finals last year.\n\nAwer Mabil's journey from life as a refugee in a hut built out of mud to scoring on his international debut is the stuff dreams are made of. The 23-year-old grew up in a refugee camp in Kenya, where hunger and cramped conditions were everyday problems for his family. After moving to Australia as part of a humanitarian programme, he was subjected to racism as he tried to make it as a footballer. But he has come through it all to represent the defending champions at the finals in the UAE.\n\nPlus the India coach Stephen Constantine and goal-keeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.\n\n(Picture: Syrian team before their World Cup qualifier against Australia.

She learned to play silently with friends to avoid detection, played on pitches once used for public executions and suffered physical and verbal abuse. Khalida fled her country, years later, and with her playing career now over she looks back on her life and tells us of her dream to one day return home as head of their FA.\n\nBon soire Napoleon, the life of Raymond Kopa\n\nRaymond Kopa died earlier this month at the age of 85. He was the first French player to win the Ballon D'or and finished in the top three on a total of four occasions.\n\nHe was the first player to boast a commercial interest, (his own sportswear brand), something no player would be without today. He was also one of the founding fathers of the first players union.\n\nNicknamed 'The Little Napoleon', he was part of the Real Madrid side that dominated the 50s, he also played for Stade de Reims in the first ever European Cup final.\n\nWe hear Kopa's only BBC World Service interview and Reims Sporting Director Alexandre Barbier pays tribute.\n\nAlessandro Costacurta interview\n\nThe former Italy and AC Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta looks back on his time playing alongside Paolo Maldini and Franco Baresi.\n\nArguably the most dominant defence of all time, he says the team 'choked' their opponents into submission and blames Milan's recent problems on the absence of a 'teacher' like Baresi or Maldini.\n\nHe also claims Milan's owner is 'too old' to take the team back to the top and admits Inter Milan are the more likely of the two teams to challenge for Serie A titles in the near future.\n\nA night on the tiles with Kosovo\n\nJames Montague reports from Kosovo where the national team coach Albert Bunjaki staged a flash mob at a classical music concert to stir up national pride amongst his players.\n\nKosovo are hoping to record their first ever competitive win when they face Iceland this weekend.\n\nWe also hear from Manchester City and Kosovo player Bersant Celina who recently jumped into the crowd to tear down a 'Kosovo is Serbia' banner at an FC Twente match (he's on loan there).\n\nThe tragedy of Justin Fashanu\n\nLeroy Rosenior played with Justin Fashanu at West Ham, he looks back on their time at the club and examines how close (or far away) football is from convincing gay players they are safe to come out whilst continuing their careers.\n\nHe also tells us how Fashanu's suicide changed his life.\n\nFor the first time in three decades, African football has a new President. We hear reaction to the “sweet victory” of 57-year-old Madagascan Ahmad, who goes by that single name.\n\nIn March 2017, 24-year-old Mohamed Tauseef died of kidney failure and blood sugar complications that were the result of a common, ligament injury sustained while playing for his national team. He was the second Pakistani footballer to die in a matter of weeks. So why are Pakistani players dying when their injuries can be treated?\n\nMeet the Muslim coach of a Jewish club. Former Mali international Sami Traore has taken over French amateur club Maccabi Creteil.\n\nThe fall and rise of Ljubo Milisevic. The former Australia international tells us how he fell into isolating depression from the heights of the Champions League and his national team, and how he’s returned to football, a more fulfilled man.\n\n(Photo: Ahmad with a football, Credit: Getty Images)\n\nOn Saturday 21 January, Chapecoense took to the pitch for the first time since the plane crash which killed 71 people. The friendly against Palmeiras was a symbolic and emotional return for a club trying to recover from a tragedy. World Football's Mani Djazmi travels to Chapecó to find out how the team and the city are rebuilding, after one of football's great disasters.\n\nAlso, Otto Pfister talks about his remarkable career. The German coach began his African adventure when he took over Rwanda in 1972. Along the way, he became friends with President Mobutu of Zaire and some of the best African footballers of all time.\n\nPicture: Brazilian Chapecoense goalkeeper Jackson Follmann (C), a survivor of the LaMia airplane crash in Colombia, receives the Copa Sudamericana trophy in Arena Conda stadium before a charity match between Chapecoense and Palmeiras in Chapeco, Brazil on January 21, 2017. (Photo by Leonardo Benassatto/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nArsenal winger Alex Iwobi describes how Arsene Wenger has taught him the value of patience. Iwobi, who’s enjoying his break-through season at Arsenal, also tells us why he chose to play for Nigeria over England and how Nigerian fans ask for much more than mere selfies when they see him.\n\nIwobi is also joined by his father, Chukwu, who says that he still sees Alex as his four-year-old boy, and he’ll watch him play for club and country till he dies.\n\nAfter Thomas Muller said there was no point in playing San Marino, we hear from the San Marino coach and the General Secretary of the Gibraltar FA, who calls Muller’s views ‘ridiculous’.\n\nAlgeria’s third coach of 2016, Georges Leekens,tells us why he’s returned for a second spell in charge of the national team, why Riyad Mahrez shouldn’t be expected to touch the heights of last season, and why Belgium will win the 2018 World Cup.\n\nThe tiny club of Kongsvinger will make their debut in the Norwegian cup final on Sunday. We hear from Managing Director, Espen Nystuen, who is also a player. So, the man he hired as coach, decides whether he plays in the team or not.\n\nPhoto: Alex Iwobi at the Emirates Stadium. Credit: Getty Images\n\nGianfranco Zola reveals his \"uncontrollable\" passion for ice cream as he realises his dream to open an Italian café in London.\n\nHe’s joined by Roberto Di Matteo, who rules himself out of a second caretaker managerial role at Chelsea, and Andriy Shevchenko, who says that qualification for Euro 2016 would be the Ukraine national team’s greatest achievement since leaving the USSR.\n\nWe also discuss the plight of youngsters in football...\n\nA leading youth coach tells us that too many players are risking their identities and careers by moving when they’re too young.\n\nWe also hear from Anderlecht coach Besnik Hasi, who recalls how he juggled a football career with looking after his family during the Balkan wars.\n\nWe’re also in the Middle Kingdom as China begins to stir as a football force.\n\nPhoto: Gianfranco Zola serving food at his cafe.
